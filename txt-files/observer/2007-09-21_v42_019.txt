Moreau celebration continues on campus 
Basilica mass marks beatification of founder of Holy Cross order 
By GENE NOONE News Writer 
The beatification of Father Basil Moreau was celebrated Thursday at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart with a mass of thanksgiv­ing and the installment of a statue of Moreau in the Basilica's northwest chapel. 
The mass marked the first campus cele­bration of Moreau's beatification since the official ceremony last Saturday in Le Mans, France. 
University President Father John Jenkins presided over the mass. Also in attendance were Cardinal Roger Mahony, the archbish­op of Los Angeles, Bishop Ponen Paul Kubi, the bishop of Mymensingh, Bangladesh, and members of the Holy Cross community.

Saint Mary's representatives recall Le Mans, France ceremony 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 
Traveling to France for the beatification of Father Basil Moreau was a "once in a life, time experience," said Saint Mary's senior Haley Nickell. 
Nickell was one of several Saint Mary's representatives who traveled to Le Mans, France for the beatification of Father Basil Moreau last Saturday. 
"I learned a great deal .about where the Sisters of the Holy Cross come from and a lot about their history," Nickell said. "I now have a much greater appreciation for them and what they do for us."

Students attend class at ND, SMC in exchange program

for Saint Mary's senior Kristina Ramos, commuting to her "International Migration and Human Rights" class requires a 20-minute bike ride twice a week. Ramos is one of more than one hundred Saint Mary's students and more than 60 Notre D.ame students who commute across State Road 31 to take classes away from their home campus. 
Ramos said the Notre Dame soCiology course appealed to her, and she enrolled in it because Saint Mary's had no similar course offerings. Ramos also has completed several Center for Social Concerns seminars through the co­exchange program. 
"I like new experiences so I'm glad that I am taking a course over there," Ramos said. 
Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students are able to take class­es at both campuses through a co-exchange program. Lora Spaulding, the assistant regis­trar at Notre Dame, said 63 Notre Dame students and more than 100 Saint Mary's students currently participate in the program. 
"The benefit for the student is to try classes not available on the home campus," Saint Mary's registrar Lorraine Kitchner said. 
Through the exchange pro­gram, Kitchner said, students can also observe how each campus operates. 
Ramos agreed that the cam­pus cultures of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's are distinct. "[Notre Dame] is a lot bigger," Ramos said. ''I'd say it's an environment that cultivates more stress ... it's more of a serene feeling at Saint Mary's."

Yon1 Kippur observed by Jevvish community 
Day of Atonement calls for abstinence from work, 25 hours offasting, continuous prayer 
By ROHAN ANAND News Writer 
At sundown tonight, several Jewish members of the Notre Dame community will cele­brate Yom Kippur, also known as the Day of Atonement ­one of the holiest and most solemn days of the year for followers of the Jewish faith. 
Those who celebrate the annual holiday must abstain from work, fast for 25 hours and pray continually until sun­set the following day. 
Freshman Patrick Abrams is Jewish and a member of the marching band, but he will not be playing at the Michigan State game so that he can observe the Sabbath and attend services. 
"Hank Greenberg, the first basemen for the Detroit Tigers, skipped playing in a World Series game because of Yom Kippur," Abrams said. "It's a Holy Day and an obliga­tion that I feel is right to do, and the University has been

Reinstate Taco Bell on can1pus 
This Sunday, stop by your local Taco Bell and grab some free nachos between the hours of 2 
p.m. and 5 p.m. Why, you ask, is the bennvolent Bell offering frne, delieious nachos? 
Because it's 
Nacho Day. 
"We like to 
call it Na-Cho 
day -as in 'not 
your day,"' 
Taco Bell 
spokesman Will 
Bortz said. 
"The chips are 
down, and wn 
want everyone 

to know we have your back. To the 
students, we're saying, 'lley guys, 
you've been at the top, and while it 
might lw a little bit rough this 
year, you can still havn some free 
food." 

In light of the football tnam's rPcnnt struggles. many have turned tlwir backs on tlw Irish. Wn havn btwn ridiruiPd in tlw media world. dnsnrtnd by fair wnathnr fans and lauglwd at by our nrw­mins.

Or pt~rhaps guacamole. And our nwssage to you is this: Hninstatn Taco Bell on campus. 

Where did we go astray, you ask'! Why would we ever let such a nne and distinguished maker of succulent Mnxican food products out of the reach of our Flex Point swipe cards'! In August 2004, the University decided not to renew the athletic department's yearly sponsorship agreement with Taco Bell, citing ethical concerns. 
Why. you ask, should we rein­state the beloved T-Bell on cam­pus'? Because it's American, that's why. 
Putting T-Bell back in LaFortune would create jobs for Americans. It would help to battle the late-night monopoly Sbarro currently enjoys and bn~ak its hegemonic strangle­hold on the 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. con­sumer demographic. It would also foster further free trade and free enterprisn, two economic princi­ples this great nation was built upon. And most important, it would put Taco Bell products in our stomachs and smiles on our faces. 
Enough is enough. In the words of last year's The Shirt-Taco Bell, this is the day and you are the team. Or at least you should be. 
Taco Bell has stood by us when no one else would. It is time we stood by them.

Tvvo math scholarships avvarded 
Pair ofSaint Mary's students given $220,000 grants from Luce Program 
By KATLYN SMITH News Writer 
The Clare Boothe Luce Program, which encourages women to pursue higher edu­cation in science, mathematics and engineering, recently awarded two Saint Mary's stu­
dents scholar­ships for their achievements and interest in mathematics. 
The Luce Program, part of the Henry Luce Foundation, bestowed grants totaling $220,000 to juniors Courtney Parry and Theresa Klinkhammer. 
The award will 
cover all tuition and fees for the remaining two years of the students' undergraduate career. 
Parry plans to attend gradu­ate school and teach mathe­matics at the collegiate level. She encouraged other women to consider entering the field of mathematics. 
"Mathematics is a unique, interesting, and multi-faceted field with many different career options," Parry said. 
"Approach the field of mathe­matics as you would approach a problem -be open to trying different strategies, don't be intimidated by the possibilities and always believe in yourself and your mathematical abili­ties. " 
Parry said her professors at Saint Mary's have encouraged

her interest in math. 
"The profes­sors enable the student to see the con­nection between the math courses and other fields of study," she said. 
The scholar­ship enabled Parry to per­
form research over the sum­mer, and she will deliver a presentation as part of the Pi Mu Epsilon student lecture series in November. Her focus will involve her general research on how mathematics is present in nature. 
Klinkhammer, a mathemat­ics and philosophy major, said she has studied math because of its ability to challenge her mind. Klinkhammer also stud­ied abroad in Rome.

Klinkhammer said she appreciates the "unique one­on-one attention with the pro­fessors" at Saint Mary's. 
"Every professor is willing to spend any time with you," she said. 
The Luce Program invites colleges and universities to submit grant proposals to the fellowship program. The schol­arships supported by the grant assist Saint Mary's College chemistry, computational mathematics or mathematics majors. 
With additional funds sup­plied by Saint Mary's, the scholarships will cover tuition and fees, a book allowance and opportunities to engage in summer research projects, professional development activities and community out­reach. 
Luce, the founder of the scholarship program and the first woman elected to Congress from Connecticut, was a long-time friend of Sister Madeleva Wolff, the third president of Saint Mary's College. 
Luce is the late widow of Henry Luce, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of Time, Inc.

$20 million to be used for malaria research 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame has received a $20 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to support research aimed at eval­uating existing malaria control programs and designing improved methods for malaria control. 
The five-year program will be directed by Frank Collins, George and Winifred Clark Professor of Biological Sciences and director of Notre Dame's Center for Global Health and Infectious Diseases. The research effort will include partners in Indonesia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia, as well as researchers from the Swiss Tropical Institute, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and Durham University. 
The College of Engineering also will play a significant role in the project.

field studies, gathering huge amounts of data, developing appropriate data bases, data analysis and management methods, geographical informa­tion systems, maps, data quality assessment, modeling and sim­ulation -all activities that will involve, to a very large extent, contributions from the College of Engineering," Collins said. 
More than one million people die of malaria each year, the vast majority being infants and very young children. 
Collins indicated that the con­sortium will develop and stan­dardize methods for effectively measuring the rates of malaria parasite transmission by mos­quitoes. 
"We'll have a whole series of end points, from direct meas­ures of the mosquito carrying the parasite to indirect meas­ures of the rate at which people become infected," Collins said. "There's a huge amount of standardization to be done." 
A second research effort will focus on evaluating some of the more standard approaches to malaria control in different set­tings where the transmission rates are different. 
"The two most widely used malaria control interventions today are insecticide-impreg­nated bed nets or houses whose walls have been sprayed with insecticides, more commonly referred to as 'indoor residual spray,"' Collins said. "We're going to evaluate these inter­ventions in a number of differ­ent transmission environments, from really low transmission to really high transmission. And, these interventions themselves will be implemented in multiple different ways."

The campus celnbration gave thosn who could not make the trip across the Atlantic thn opportunity to 

honor  Moreau  and  his  
achievement  for  the  
Congregation  of the  Holy  

Cross. 
A highlight of the mass was the blessing by Cardinal Mahony of a new statue of Moreau. 
The statue, a full body bronze sculpture about six feet tall, was designed and carved by world famous Los Angeles sculptor Hobert Graham. 
Graham, known for his bas­rnlinf piecns, sculpted the Franklin D. Hoosevelt Momorial in Washington, D.C., the Dukn Ellington Monumnnt in Cnntral Park in New York City and the Olympic Gateway at the Los Angoles Memorial Coliseum for the 1984 Olympic Games. 
The statue of Moreau was installed in the northwest apsidal chapel across from the statue of Holy Cross' other beatified member, Blessed Broth{lr Andre Bnssette. 
The installment of the stat­ue in the Basilica was part of the larger beatification cele­bration, which took place mostly in France. 
Thosn who wnnt to Le Mans as part of the University dele­gation returned earlier this week. 
Fathnr Edwin Obermiller spent oight days in France and served as a chaplain and guide for the 55 Notre Dame studnnts who were part of the beatilkation events. 
"The beatification honors our past and allows us to look to the future with grnat excitement and hope," Obermiller said. "It was an amazing experience, and I was thrilled to be with so many of our Notrn Dame stu­dents at the beatification." 
The 55 Notre Dame students were part of more than 4,000 people who attended the nearly two-hour beatification mass, Obermiller said. 
Also at the mass were 30 bishops and archbishops, two cardinals, 260 priests who eo­ceh~brated the mass, and the prime minister of France and his wife. 
"Many of the students expressed that by being at the beatification and meeting so many of the Holy Cross reli­gious from around the world that it allownd them to realize how much bigger Holy Cross is beyond the campus of Notre Dame," Obermiller said. 

Othnr beatification events included a mass at the Church of the Visitation in Le Mans where Moreau was ordained in 1821 and a multilingual praynr vigil at Notre-Dame de Sainte-Croix, the parish where Moreau's tomb is locat­ed. 
Obermiller said the beatifi­cation has allowed the com­munity to pause at the start of the school year and reflect on Moreau's spirit, wisdom and grace as the founder of Holy Cross.

Corp. to shutter prostitution windows 
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands -A non-profit corporation has purchased a large number of the buildings where prostitutes pose in win­dows in Amsterdam's Red Light district, the eity said Thursday, in a deal that may lead to a third of the windows being shuttered. 
The move is intended to break a logjam in an multi-year effort by the city to cut back on the windows, which it says are a magnet for <Time and money laundering. 
Mayor Job Cohen said the move was not intended to get rid of prostitution entirely, since it is part of the area's history and a major tourist draw for the city. 
Monks march to protest military rule 
YANGON, Myanmar -Nearly 1,000 Buddhist monks, joined by thousands of their countrymen. marched in Myanmar's largest eity Thursday in the biggest challenge in at least a decade to the iron-fisted junta, a show of strength rare under military rule. 
Authorities normally quick to crack down hard on dissent left the marchers alone, apparently wary of stirring up further prob­lems. The monks said they would march again next week. 
Processions of monks converged from vari­ous monasteries around Yangon in the early afternoon at the golden hilltop Shwedagon pagoda, the country's most revered shrine. They prayed there before embarking on a more than three-hour march through Yangon in steady rain, gathering supporters as they went. 
Monks at the head of the procession carried religious flags and an upside-down alms bowl, a symbol of protest.

Dole lettuce recalled for E. coli 
SALINAS, Calif. -Much of the lettuce in a salad mix Dole Food Co. recalled from stores in Canada and the U.S. this week was grown in the same Central California region that produced the spinach involved in a deadly E. coli outbreak last year. 
Romaine and green leaf lettuce from the fertile Salinas Valley, known as the nation's "Salad Bowl," made up part of Dole's Hearts Delight mix, company officials said Wednesday. The salad bags were recalled in Indiana and eight other states after a sample taken from a store in Canada tested positive for E. coli. 


Bush challenges Dems on insurance 
WASHINGTON -President Bush chal­lenged Democrats on Thursday to quickly renew a popular children's health insurance program and accused them of "putting poor children at risk" for political purposes. 
The State Children's Health Insurance Program is set to expire Sept. 30. Democrats are pushing for a $35 billion spending incre~se. But Bush has threatened to veto it and has proposed a $5 billion increase. 
Some Democrats, he said, believe they can score political points by sending him a bill they know he will veto. 
The president urged lawmakers to send him a simple, temporary extension that would give lawmakers more time to work out their differences over a long-term renewal.

Mental hospital becomes development 
INDIANAPOLIS -Residential and commer­cial development of a 150-acre site once occu­pied by the former Central State Hospital is expected to begin in the spring. 
Developers presented a 34-page plan to city officials Wednesday, calling for about 330 homes, restaurants, shops and offices to be built on the grounds of the former Indianapolis westside mental hospital that closed in 1994. 
"It was a blank sheet. Nobody really knew what to do with it," developer Mike Higbee told members of the Metropolitan Development Commission, which still must approve the plan.

Protesters gather to supportJena Six 
College students demonstrate, listen to Sharpton, Jackson speak in Louisiana 
Associated Press 
JENA, La. -Drawn by a case tinged with one of the most hated symbols of Old South racism -a hang­man's noose tied in an oak tree -tens of thousands of protesters rallied Thursday against what they see as double standard of prose­cution for blacks and whites. 
The plight of the so­called Jena Six, a group of black teens initially charged with attempted murder in the beating of a white classmate, became a flashpoint for one the biggest civil-rights demon­strations in years. 
Old-guard lions like the Revs. Jesse Jackson and AI Sharpton joined scores of college students bused in from across the nation who said they wanted to make a stand for racial equality just as their parents did in the 1950s and '60s. 
"It's not just about Jena, but about inequalities and disparities around the country," said Stephanie Brown, 26, national youth director for the NAACP, who estimated about 2,000 college students were among the throngs of most­ly black protesters who overwhelmed this tiny cen­tral Louisiana town. 
But the teens' case galva­nized demonstrators as few legal cases in recent years. 
The cause of Thursday's demonstrations dates to August 2006, when a black Jena High School student asked at a student assem­bly whether blacks could sit under a shade tree that was a frequent gathering place for whites. He was told yes. But· nooses appeared in the tree the next day. Three white stu­dents were suspended but not criminally prosecuted. LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters said this week he could find no state law covering the act. 
Brown said the Jena case resonates with the col­lege-aged crowd because they aren't much older than the six youths charged. Many of the stu­dent protesters had been sharing information about the case through Facebook, MySpace and other social­networking Web sites. 


Jackson, who led a throng of people three blocks long to the court­house with an American flag resting on his shoul­der, likened the demonstra­tion to the marches on Selma and the Montgomery bus boycott. But even he was not entirely sure why 
Jena  became  the  focal  
point.  
"You  can  never  quite  

tell," he said. "Rosa Parks was not the first to sit in the front of the bus. But the sparks hit a dry field." 
The noose incident was followed by fights between blacks and whites, culmi­nating in December's attack on white student Justin Barker, who was knocked unconscious. According to court testimo­ny, his face was swollen and bloodied, but he was able to attend a school function that same night. 
Six black teens were arrested. Five were origi­nally charged with attempted second-degree murder _ charges that have since been reduced for four of them. The sixth was booked as a juvenile on sealed charges. 
Martin Luther King Ill, son of the slain civil rights leader, said punishment of some sort may be in order for the six defendants, but "the justice system isn't applied the same to all crimes and all people." 
People began massing for the demonstrations before dawn Thursday, jamming the two-lane highway lead­ing into town and parking wherever they could. By midmorning, state police estimated the crowd at 12,000 and growing. Organizers said it eventual­ly swelled to as many as 50,000. 
Demonstrators gathered at the local courthouse, a park, and the yard at Jena High where the tree once stood (it was cut down in July).

CAIRO -Al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden called on Pakistanis to wage a holy war against President Gen. Pervez Musharraf in a new recording released Thursday, saying his mili­tary's siege of a militant mosque stronghold makes him an infidel. 
The storming of the Red Mosque in Islamabad in July "demonstrated Musharraf's insistence on continuing his loyalty, submissiveness and aid to America against the Muslims ... and makes armed rebellion against him and removing him obligatory," bin Laden said in the message. 
"So when the capability is there, it is obligatory to rebel against the apostate ruler, as is the case now," he said. 
Bin Laden's voice was heard over video showing previously released footage of the terror leader. The video was released Thursday on Islamic militant Web sites and first reported by Laura Mansfield, an American ter­rorism expert who monitors militant message traffic. 
The message, titled "Come to Jihad," was the third from bin Laden this month in a flurry of videos and audiotapes marking the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. 
Maj. Gen. Waheed Arshad, a Pakistani army spokesman, said the army will continue its fight against terrorism, regardless of any threats. 
"We have the aim and objective, as our national duty, to eliminate terror­ists and eradicate extremism. The Pakistan army will continue to carry out its role against terrorists wherev­er they are found, whether in the tribal areas (of northwest Pakistan) or elsewhere." 
"Such threats issued through videos or in any other way cannot deter us from fulfilling our national duty," he said.

IN BRIEF 
Wall Street falls after high streak 
NEW YORK -Stocks retreated Thursday as Wall Street took a breather from this week's recent rally, sobered a bit by mixed earnings reports, a tumbling dollar and surging oil prices. 
Wall Street had driven the Dow Jones industri­als up more than 400 points in the two days fol­lowing the Fed's half-point rate reduction, so it was to be expected that investors would eventu­ally stop to cash in gains. 
So when a few major companies, particularly Bear Stearns & Cos. and Circuit City, posted wider-than-expected drops in third-quarter prof­it Thursday, Wall Street's giddiness following the Fed's rate cut waned, and nervousness resur­faced about how long it might take for the econo­my and corporate America to rebound from the recent market turmoil. 
"Historically, after the Fed eases, the market takes about a month to figure out whether the casing was a good thing or a bad thing," said Brian Gendreau, investment strategist for lNG lnvnstment Management. 
Loonie value the same as dollar 
NEW YORK -For the first time since Gerald Ford was president, the loonie can buy as much as the greenback. 
The U.S. dollar's recent decline against the Canadian dollar, the curo, and even the Indian rupee, means Americans will pay more for imports and trips to Paris, Rome, Bangalore and Toronto. It also may drive overseas demand for U.S. goods and help raise profits at U.S. multinational corporations. 
The U.S. dollar reached 1-to-1 parity against the Canadian dollar Thursday for the first time since November 1976. That means one Canadian dollar now buys one U.S. dollar, so a bottle of maple syrup could cost an American as much in Toronto as it does in New York. 
A lower dollar makes U.S. exports more competitive, which is good news for American manufacturers but spells rising prices for imports to the U.S. 


Congress investigates home loans 
Bush calls market 'unsettling,' plans to modify FHA loans to refinance homes 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The 
American dream of owning 
a home has turned into a 
nightmare -not only for 
homeowners, but also for 
politicians and regulators 
under pressure to ease the 
credit crunch. 
President Bush, at a news 
conference Thursday, was 
confronted by questions 
about whether the country 
was headed toward reces­
sion. Bush acknowledged 
"some unsettling times" in 
the troubled housing and 
credit markets, but said he 
believed the economy was 
still on solid ground. 
Also on the hot seat, 
Federal Reserve Chairman 
Ben Bernanke was pumped 
for answers at a congres­
sional hearing about what 
regulators could do to help 
struggling homeowners. 
The housing slump, the 
worst in 16 years, is likely 
to drag on well into 2008, 
when the nation will be vot­

who appointed the judge," Dieter said. 
Dieter expanded this theory to illustrate what he called tho "strange and absurd" nature of the death penalty. lin provided nconomic and moral arguments to support his assertion. 
California currently has 660 inmates on death row, Dieter said. and the state executes one person every two years. It costs substantially more to hold death row inmates than inmatos with life sentences due to extra court and appeals costs, Dieter said, and that cost is usually paid by the taxpayers. Dieter said this money could be "redis­tributed into law enforcement and other ways to make socie­ty safer." 
An audience member asked what Dieter would say to those who do not believe the death penalty is morally wrong. He responded that the death penalty is economically inefficient and said "the bur­den lies with those who say that the state has a right to take life." 
Dieter said 3,300 people are on death row, yet some of the worst people in American society -Eric Rudolf, Ted Kazynski, and Charles Cullen -received life sentences. lie also gave examples of inno­cent people who were con­demned to death, such as Anthony Porter, whose convic­tion was later overturned. 
Senior Shannon Heabe attended the lecture and said it "stressed the need to look at a more comprehensive pic­ture."

Rather sues CBS in name of journalism 
Former news anchor files $70 million suit 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK-Dan Hather said Thursday that the undue influ­ence of the govnrnment and large corporations ovnr newsrooms spurred his decision to file a $70 million lawsuit against CBS and its former parent company. 
"Sonwbody. sometime has got to take a stand and say democra­l~Y cannot survive, much less thrive with the level of big corpo­rate and big government interfer­Pnce and intimidation in news." ho said on CNN's "Larry King Live." 
In tlw suit. filed a day earlier in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. Rather claimed CBS and Viacom Inc. used him as a "scapegoat" and intentionally botched the aftermath of a dis­credited story about President Bush's military service to curry favor with the White House. He was removed from his "CBS Evening News" post in March 2005. 
"They sacrificed support for independent journalism for cor­porate financial gain, and in so doing, I think they undermined a lot at CBS News." he told King. 
Hather didn't mention other instances in which he believed news organizations bowed to cor­porate and government pressure. 
CBS spokesman Dana McClintock did not return an after-hours call seeking comment Thursday. lie has called Rather's complaints "old news" and said the lawsuit was "without merit." A spokesman for Viacom declined to comment. 
Journalism ethics scholar Bob StePln said Hatlwr would have a difficult time proving that the White llouse or other political operatives exertnd undue influ­ence on CBS. 
"It would be naive for us to believe that there was no influ­ence from powerful institutions and individuals on journalism," said Steele, a scholar at the Poynter Institute, a journalism foundation in St. Petersburg, Fla. 

Still, he said: "For the most part, the journalists who run news organizations and who report the news fight hard to pro­tect the independenee of the jour­nalism. and most of the time suc­ceed." 
Hather narrated the September 2004 n~port that said Bush dis­obeyed orders and shirked some of his duties during his National Guard service. It also said a com­mander felt pressured to sugar­coat Bush's record. 
The story relied on four docu­ments, supposedly written by Bush's commander in the Texas Air National Guard, the late Lt. Col. Jerry Killian. Critics ques­tioned the documents' authentici­ty and suggested they were forged. 
A panel selected by the net­work to investigate the story determined that it was neither fair nor accurate. CBS fired the story's producer and asked for the resignations of three execu­tives because it could not authen­ticate documents used in the story. Rather was forced out of the anchor chair he had occupied for 24 years. 
On CNN, Rather dismissed the panel's review, claiming it was not impartial. 
"This was in many ways a fraud. It was a setup," he told King. 
Louis D. Boccardi, the retired chief P.J{ecutive of The Associatf~d Press who made up the two-man investigative panel with Hichard Thornburgh, the former U.S. attorney general, defended the panel's work Thursday night. 
"Our report was independent, and it speaks for itself," he said, echoing comments made by Thornburgh on Wednesday. Both declined to eomment further.

New casinos threaten bingo 
Allure of gaming prizes diminishes popularity of classic game 
Associated Press 

WATEHTOWN, Mass. Pauline LaCava can rattle off locations of bingo games that closed in her hometown as fast as she can scan her bingo sheet, dabbing pink ink marks on numbers as they're called at Saint Patrick Church in Watertown. 
"There used to be one every night of the week," said LaCava, 80, seated at the rear of the Catholic church base­ment, where the night's top prize will be $330. "I definitely feel the casinos hurt bingos. Foxwoods has the bingo every day and every night." 
Bingo had been a reliable source of revenue for churches, schools, youth sports leagues and veterans' organizations since the early 1970s. The games have been on the decline for several years, in part because of aging players, smoking bans and the lure of Keno and casinos. 
Now, bingo players and the organizations that benefit from the games in this area worry that proposed casinos would be the final blow. 
Gov. Deval Patrick on Monday announced he wants to license three resort casinos in Massachusetts in a bid to gen­erate $450 million in annual tax revenue. The licenses would be put up for bid in a competitive process open to Indian tribes and casino com­panies. 
"It will close us down," said the He.v. Francis Daley, pastor of Saints Martha and Mary Church in Lakeville, which bor­ders Middleborough. the town in which the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe wants to build a $1 billion casino. "We cannot compete with their prizes." 
The Thursday night game attracts 120 players, raising $40,000 per year for the church, helping pay bills at a time when overall contributions to Catholic churehes are down. 
Bingo revenue in Massachusetts is at a 32-year low, according to the charitable gaming division of the Massachusetts Lottery. Gross revenue last year was $102 million, the lowest since 1974. the third year of legalized bingo in Massachusetts. It was $252 million in 1993, but has slid every year since. 
Organizations get less than 20 percent of the gross revenue after paying out prizes, expens­es, and 5 percent state tax. 
Bingo organizers who see the effects elsewhere say they have reason to worry. 
In Connecticut, Foxwoods Resort Casino opened a bingo hall in 1986, and its full casino in 1992. Mohegan Sun opened four years later. From about that point, charitable bingo revenues have fallen. Gross revenue from charitable bingo fell from $34.6 million in 1995 to $23.7 million last year, according to Connecticut's Division of Special Hevenue. 

In the Catholic Dioceso of Buffalo, N.Y., bingo receipts fell by 36 percent from 2000 to 2006, including a 9.6 percent drop last year, said spokesman Kevin Keenan, who blamed Canadian casinos and a work­place smoking ban. 
In Ohio, the Aquinas Central Catholic School in Steubenville, located near two West Virginia casinos, eliminated bingo two years ago after a drop in atten­dance. 
"Slot machines, craps and blackjack _ on a relative scale _ are very exciting and are going to draw people away from bingo," said Dartmouth College economics professor Bruce Sacerdote, who co-wrote a 2005 report examining the eco­nomic impact of legalized gam­bling in Massachusetts. 
The Massachusetts casino debate reignited this year after the Mashpee Wampanoags won federal recognition as a tribe, bought land in Middleborough and unveiled plans for a resort casino to compete with Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun. The Aquinnah Wampanoag Indians have declared that they'll open a casino if their Mashpee counterparts do the same. 
Several other commercial casino proposals have been floated, but the Legislature still needs to approve expanded gambling before a full-scale casino can be built. 
But even without legislative approval, recognition gives. tribes the right to operate bingo parlors, and the Mashpee Wampanoags have said they'll do that in Middleborough if they can't build a casino. 
The Massachusetts Catholic Conference, which represents the state's four bishops, urged the Legislature to reject the plan. In a statement Monday, it said casinos will create addict­ed gamblers and that "the harm will reach far beyond individual gamblers by affect­ing their spouses, children, dependents, employers and the community in which they live.

IRAQ 
Cholera outbreak prompts health concerns 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -The World Health Organization con­firmed on Thursday the first cholera case in Baghdad since 2003, raising fears the disease is spreading from the north of the country where it has struck more than 1,000 peo­ple. 
A 25-year-old woman from eastern Baghdad was found to have cholera after she turned up at a hospital with severe diarrhea, said Dr. Naeema al­Gasseer, the WHO's represen­tative in Iraq. 
Cholera is a gastrointestinal disease that is typically spread by drinking contaminated water and can cause severe diarrhea that, in extreme cases, can lead to fatal dehy­dration. 
The disease broke out in Iraq in mid-August, but had been confined to northern 
Iraq, affecting the provinces of Sulaimaniyah, lrbil and Tamim, which is home to the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. At least 10 people have died, accord­ing to WHO. 
Several suspected cholera cases also have been reported in Diyala province, north of Baghdad, but al-Gasseer said none had been confirmed. 
Cholera is endemic to Iraq, with about 30 cases registered each year. But the last time there was an epidemic in the country was in 1999 when 20 cases were discovered in one day, said Adel Muhsin, the Health Ministry's inspector­general. 
Al-Gasseer said health authorities were concerned the disease could spread because of the movement of people within Iraq's borders. Hundreds of thousands of dis­placed people have been forced to flee their homes 
because of violence. symptoms of cholera such as

Muhsin confirmed such con­cerns were holding up the border shipment but said he was told the problem was solved and that the chlorine would arrive soon. Chlorine will be added in higher doses to Baghdad's water supply as a precaution against cholera, Muhsin said. 
His teams recently tested drinking water across the cap­ital and discovered chlorine levels on 20 locations were inadequate to prevent cholera. Also, several ice factories were closed in Iraq because of cholera concerns, he said. 
The Health Ministry would continue checking drinking water in all Iraqi cities, Muhsin told The Associated Press, and teams would inspect ice factories and ice cream make.rs.

Neptunehaswarm South Pole 
Associated Press 
PARIS -Scientists say that Neptune, one of the coldest planets in the solar system, has a surprising warm spot ­relatively speaking. 
An international team of astronomers has found that Neptune's south pole is warmer than other parts of the planet. 
-Temperatures at its south pole are about 18 degrees warmer than elsewhere on the planet -not much for a plan­et with an average tempera­ture colder than 320 degrees below zero. 
The apparent reason is that the south pole has been in the summer sunlight for about 40 years. 
Neptune is nearly 2.8 billion miles away from the sun. A Neptunian year -the time it takes to orbit the sun -is equivalent to about 165 Earth years. 
One result of that has been to expose Neptune's southern pole to the sun for nearly 40 years, warming it up. Because it is so far away, Neptune gets only l/900th of the sunlight that Earth receives, but it still appears to have had a signifi­cant impact. 
An array of scientific organi­zations announced the findings Tuesday, including the govern­ment-funded CNRS research body in France and ESO, the European Organization for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, whose telescope in Chile was used. 
"Neptune's south pole is cur­rently tilted toward the sun, just like the Earth's south pole is tilted toward the sun during summer in the southern hemi­sphere," astronomer Glenn Orton, lead author of the find­ings, said in an ESO news release. 
"On Neptune, the Antarctic summer lasts 40 years instead of a few months, and a lot of solar energy input during that time can make big tempera­ture differences between the regions in continual sunlight and those with day-night vari­ations," he said. 
The heat has, in turn, defrosted methane normally trapped as ice in the planet's atmosphere, releasing it as gas, the CNRS said. It said there is eight times more methane over the south pole than in the rest of the planet's atmosphere. 
The abundance of gaseous methane in Neptune's strato­sphere had gone unexplained until now, it added. 
Episcopal bishops seek to keep Anglican role 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS-Episcopal bishops met privately for seven hours Thursday with the arch­bishop of Canterbury, trying to preserve the church's role in the Anglican family despite Episcopal support for gays. 
The denomination is the Anglican body in the U.S. and has a more liberal view of Scripture than most Anglicans overseas. Tensions over Bible interpretation erupted in 2003, when Episcopalians consecrat­ed the first openly gay bishop, 
V. Gene Robinson of New Hampshire. 
Archbishop Rowan Williams, the Anglican spiritual leader, has been struggling to keep the 77 million-member Anglican Communion from breaking apart _ an effort he has called "exhausting." Unlike a pope, Williams doesn't have direct authority to force a resolution. 
Colorado Bishop Robert O'Neill, who briefed reporters after the meeting, called the conversation "open and forth­right," but provided few specifics. 
But Canon Jim Naughton, a spokesman for the Diocese of Washington, said Williams had suggested that Episcopalians "needed to exercise greater concern" for unity. 
The archbishop also asked Episcopal leaders "how far they were willing to go" to ful­fill demands from Anglican leaders that they roll back their support for gays and les­bians. 
Williams "made it clear that he believed the Episcopal Church had acted preemptively in consecrating Bishop Robinson," Naughton said.

Meteorite crashes near Lake Titicaca 
Associated Press 
LIMA, Pnru -P!lruvian 

astronomers said Thursday 
that evidence shows a mete­
orite crashed near Lake 
Titieaca over thn weekend, 
lnaving an elliptical crater and 
magnetic rock fragments in an 
impact powerful enough to 
rngister on snismic charts. 
As other astronomers learned more details, thny too said it appears likely that a lngitimatn nwtnoritn hit Earth on Saturday -an rare occurnnce. 
The Earth is constantly bom­barded with objecl<i from outer space, but most burn up in the atmosphere and never reach the planet's surface. Only onn in a thousand rocks that poo­ple elairn arn meteorites turn out to bo rnal, according to Jay Melosh, an export on impact cratc\rs and professor of plane­tary scienc~e at the Univnrsity of Arizona. 
Melosh was skeptical at lirst, initially calling it a "non-metn­oritn" and suggesting that the crater might have possibly como from bPlow as a vokanic eruption. Tlwn seientists loarrwd of morn dntails about tho cratnr, as well as witrwss dnscriptions of a thundorous roar and a rain of smallnr roc~ks corning down. 
"It begins to sound more likely to me that this object could indeed be a meteorito," Melosh said Thursday. 
Such impacts arc rare, and astronomists still want to do other tests to confirm tlw strike. 
Other details don't add up, tlwy said -such as witness aceounts of watnr in the muddy crater boiling for I 0 rninutns from thn heat. Meteorites are actually cold when they hit l~arth, astrono­mists say, since tlwir outer lay­ers burn up and fall away hefom impact. 
l:xpert.s also puzzlnd over daims that 200 local residents wnrn sicknrwd by fumes from the crater. Doctors who exam­ined them found no evidence of illness relatnd to the mete­orite, and one suggested a psy­chosomatic reaction to the sight and sound of the plung­ing meteor. 
More details emerged when astrophysicist Jose Ishitsuka of Peru's Geophysics Institute reachnd the site about 6 miles from Lake Titicaca. lie con­firmed that a meteorite caused a crater 42 feet wide and 15 feet dcwp. the institute's presi­dent, Honald Woodman. told Tlw Associatnd Prnss on Thursday. 
lshitsuka recovered a 3-inch magnetic fra~-,rment and said it contained iron, a mineral found in all rocks from space. The impact also registnred a magnitude-1.5 tremor on the institute'r; seismic equipment -that's as much as an explo­sion of 4.9 tons of dynamite, Woodman said. 
Local residents described a fiery ball falling from tho sky and smashing into the desolate Andean plain. 
Doetors told an Associated Press Tcdnvision News camera­man at the site that they had found no sign of radioactivn contamination among families living nearby. But they said they had taken samples of blood, urine and hair to ana­lyze. 
Pnasants living near the crater said they had smelled a sulfurous odor for at least an hour after the metnorite struek and that it had provoked upset stomachs and headaches. But lshitsuka said he doubts rnports of a sulfurous smell. 
Metnor expert Ursula Marvin said that if pnople were sick­ennd, "it wouldn't be the mete­oritn itsnlf. but tlw dust it rais-Ps.'' 
A meteorite "wouldn't get much gas out of the narth," said Marvin. who has studied the objects sincn 1961 at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Obsnrvatory in Massachusetts. "It's a very superficial thing." 
Teacher pleads guilty to sex charges 
Associated Press 
SALT LAKE CITY -A man honored as among the best teachers in Utah pleaded guilty Thursday to felony sex charges involving 11 students at his suburban classroom. 
Frank Laine Hall, 37, who taught l'irst grade in the Salt Lake City suburb of Hiverton until his arrest last March, could get up to 30 years to life in prison, prosecutor Rodwicke Ybarra said. 
Hall pleaded guilty to 10 counts of attempted aggravat­ed sex abuse of a child and 
one count of sex abuse of a child in a plea agreement that dismissed tive other eounts of aggravated sex abuse of a child, Ybarra said. 
The agreement will ensure that he must register as a sex offender for life, Ybarra said. 
In court Thursday, Hall admitted he touched the stu­dents inappropriately, Ybarra said. 
The former teacher didn't respond to an e-mail Thursday sent through his animated class Web site, which is still up but appears dated. His lawyer, David 
Finlayson, refused to take any calls from The Associated Press. 
llall remains free on $500,000 bail until his sen­tencing Nov. 14. 
Hall was aecusod of putting his hand inside the pants of three girls at Hosamond Elementary School in Hiverton. Then eight other students came forward with similar accounts, Ybarra said. 
Authorities were tipped by the parents of one student, and school ofl'icials said they immediately barred Hall from the classroom.

CAMBODIA 
Suspect charged with war crimes 
Detention center will have amenities 
Associated Press 
PHNOM PENH -The top Khmer Rouge suspect awaiting trial before a U.N.-backed geno­cide tribunal will get cable TV and regular visits from doctors while in detention -amenities out of reach for most impover­ished Cambodians. 
Former Khmer Rouge ideolo­gist Nuon Chea -who is 82 and in declining health from a stroke was arrested Wednesday and flown to Phnom Penh, where he was charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
Nuon Chea spent his first night in a detention cell at the tribunal headquarters on the outskirts of the capital, tribunal spokesman Reach Sambath said Thursday. 
We have been informed by medical doctors and detention guards that he is in good spirits. He is in "good health for an eld­erly person," the spokesman said, adding that it was impor­tant to "provide the best servic­es we can" so he stays healthy enough to face trial. 
The tribunal is investigating abuses committed when the communist Khmer Rouge held power from 1975-1979. The Khmer Rouge's radical policies have been blamed for the deaths of 1.7 million of their countrymen from starvation, overwork and execution. 
Nuon Chea has denied any responsibility for the regime's mass brutality, though he has said he was ready to face the tribunal. He made no comments upon his arrest Wednesday, but his son indicated Nuon Chea would cooperate with the panel. 
"My father is happy to shed light on the Khmer Rouge regime for the world and people to understand," Nuon Say said. 
Nuon Chea joined the Khmer Rouge in the 1950s in its forma­tive stages as the country's underground communist party, later becoming its chief political ideologue and right-hand man to Pol f>ot. 
Nuon Chea is the second, and highest-ranking, Khmer Rouge leader detained to appear before the panel. 
Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Ouch, who headed the for­mer Khmer Rouge S-21 torture center, was charged on July 31 with crimes against humanity. Prosecutors have recommended three other suspects for trial, but have not named them pub­licly. 
Ouch has told investigators that Nuon Chea had "direct command" over S-21, where many purged communist cadre were detained, tortured and executed. 
Reach Sambath said both sus­pects' cells were equipped with cable television and a radio. Nuon Chea has previously told journalists he spends most of his time listening to radio news or watching English soccer, including his favorite team liverpool. 
Nuon Chea will be given three high-calorie meals a day to ensure he stays healthy, and four Cambodian doctors, five nurses and an ambulance will be available around-the-clock for both men, the spokesman said. 
"Cambodian people in general do not get the kind of services they are getting," Reach Sambath said. "But we want them to live as long as possible so that they .can defend them­selves and confront the law." 
Chum Mey, 77, one of the few survivors of S-21 prison, recalled his brutal incarcera­tion. 
He was tortured, shackled in a tiny cell with a small ammuni­tion box to use as a toilet and given a twice-daily ration of porridge consisting largely of water and a few grains ofrice, he said. 
"But I do not envy them," he said of the defendants. "If we do not give them good services, they could fall ill. If something worse than that happens to them, it will be very frustrat­ing." 
Tension high after shooting 
Commission investigates why security company opened fire 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Bush on Thursday refused to criticize a U.S. security company in Iraq accused in a shooting that left 11 civilians dead, saying investigators need to determine if the guards violated rules gov­erning their operations. 
Bush said he expected Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki would raise the shooting by agents of Blackwater USA when they meet next week at the U.N. General Assembly. 
Al-Maliki has urged the U.S. Embassy to find another security firm to protect its diplomats, say­ing he cannot tolerate "the killing of our citizens in cold blood." He called the shootings a "crime" and said they had gener­ated "widespread anger and hatred." 
"Obviously, to the extent inno­cent life was lost, you know, I'm saddened," the president said at a wide-ranging news conference. "Our objective is to protect inno­cent life. And we've got a lot of brave souls in the theater work­ing hard to protect innocent life." 
Officials of Blackwater, the Moyock, N.C.-based company, say its employees acted appro­priately in response to an armed attack Sunday against a State Department convoy. Blackwater is the main provider of body­guards and armed escorts for 
U.S. government civilian employ­ees in Iraq. 
In a telephone conversation on Monday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice asked al-Maliki to delay any initial action to the shooting and that any permanent measures be held up until all the facts were known, a senior State Department official said, speak­ing on condition of anonymity to provide details of the private dis­cussion. 
Maliki, however, insisted on taking a stronger line and warned that continued use of the contractors would further inflame tensions, the official said. Blackwater's operations in Iraq were suspended, prompting the U.S. embassy in Baghdad to ban all road convoys by diplo­mats and other civilian person­nel outside the heavily fortified Green Zone. 
A U.S.-Iraqi commission is looking into the shooting. 

The shooting is the latest source of tension between Baghdad and Washington as Bush presses ahead with the Iraq war despite strong opposi­tion across the United States and in the Democratic-led Congress. A week ago, Bush announced gradual cutbacks in U.S. forces from the current peak of 168,000 soldiers. Even so, the plan would leave 130,000 U.S. troops or more in Iraq next sum­mer. 
Bush acknowledged Baghdad would not meet the goal he set last January for Iraq to take over security in all of its 18 provinces by November. 
"Achieving those goals have been slower than we thought," Bush said. But he said the goals were still worth pursuing. 
"Part of the reason why there's not this instant democracy in Iraq is because people are still recovering from Saddam Hussein's brutal rule," Bush said. "Sort of an interesting comment, I heard somebody say, 'Where's Mandela?' Well, Mandela's dead because Saddam Hussein killed all the Mandelas." 
It was a reference to the charismatic former leader of South Africa who helped recon­cile his country after decades of racial division. Mandela is still alive. 
On another foreign policy issue, Bush said he took serious­ly threats by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. "This is a person that consistently talks about the use of force on Israel, for example, and Israel is our very firm and strong ally," Bush said. 
He was asked about a recent statement by France's foreign minister that the international community should prepare for the possibility of war in the event Iran obtains atomic weapons ­although the official later stressed the focus remains on diplomatic pressures. 
"I have consistently stated that I am hopeful that we can con­vince the Iranian regime to give up any ambitions it has in devel­oping a weapons program, and do so peacefully," Bush said. "That ought to be the objective of any diplomacy." 
He also defended the decision of New York officials to deny Ahmadinejad permission to lay a wreath next week at ground zero -site of the detroyed World Trade Center. "I can understand why they would not want some­body that's running a country that's a state .sponsor of terror down there at the site," the pres­ident said.

SACRAMENTO -About 
56,000 lunch boxes distributed 
by California in an effort to 
promote healthful eating may 
contain lead, and state offi­
cials Thursday urged con­
sumers not to use them. 
Tests found elevated levels 
of lead in three of the boxes, 
which were made in China 
and given out at health fairs 
and other events, said officials 
of the state Department of 
Public Health. They carried a 
logo saying, "Eat fruits and 
vegetables and be active." 
"Certainly it's unfortunate 
that an item we're using to

be a potential health hazard," 
the department's director, 
Mark Horton, told reporters in 
a conference call. 
A test by the Sacramento 
County Health Department in 
July indicated the boxes con­
tained lead, he said. Several 
weeks of more sophisticated 
testing confirmed the presence 
of lead "in multiple parts of the box," including the logo, he said. 
Asked why it took so long to issue a warning to the public, Horton said: "I think we took the appropriate steps based on the information available to us

Gallery owner Anne Brown said she never tried to verify that O'Donnell had taken the photos because she accepted his word. 
But the Kennedy photo was actually taken by United Press International photographer 
Stan Stearns  - the  most

snapped.  
O'Donnell's  son,  Tyge  

O'Donnell, blamed his father's dementia for the error, sug­gesting he mistakenly claimed to have taken Stearns' photo and several others because he had trouble remembering which pictures were his. 
When Stearns saw his photo on O'Donnell's obituary, he said he was shocked. Stearns and his former UPI colleagues immediately began calling other retired photographers and news organizations to correct the error. 
O'Donnell took publicity photos of presidents and his­torical events for the U.S. Information Agency, which offered the images to foreign media. 
He was never an official White House photographer, a position that did not exist until the Johnson administration. But he did work in the White House, under several adminis­trations, and the National Archives has presidential pho­tos that are listed as being taken by him. 
Heather Graulich, who researched O'Donnell's photo­graphs for an article for the National Press Photographers Association, said there is no evidence that he falsely made any claims about photographs before 1994, about the time his family has said he began having trouble with his mem­ory. 
Because the government owned all the negatives to his States. No evi­
dence has sur­

faced that proves he was not at Kennedy's funeral. 
"The problem with famous events is there may have been any number of photographers clicking away," Natanson said. "And there may be a consid­erable number of images that are very close to each other of virtually the same moment." 
In the case of the salute photo, it is clear that the one distributed with O'Donnell's obituary was actually taken by Stearns, said Ken Johnston, director of histori­cal content for the Corbis photo archive, which includes all the UPI photos. 
But a number of historical photos either lack credits or have incorrect credits, he said. 
Hal Buell, a retired head of photography for The Associated Press, said that in the days before photos regu­larly carried credits, images sometimes got mixed up, and occasionally even the photog­raphers disagreed about who took a particular shot. 
On a big story like the Kennedy funeral "the film would all get dumped into one basket," he said. "The need for speed was critical and people would move very quickly." 
Family and friends have said O'Donnell would want to be remembered as a peace activist who also took noted photos of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a young Marine photographer at the end of World War II. 
O'Donnell falsely claimed one panoramic photo from Japan as his own, his son said, but the family bas the negatives to the other photos, which appeared in a 2005 book published by Vanderbilt University Press.

Global warming: The upside 
TODAY'S STAFF

Julie Grisanti Scene Viewpoint Michelle Fordice Kara King 
They've done it. After years of coming up short, Looten Plunder, Hoggish Grnedly, and Verminous Skumm have done what they set out to do. They've defeated Captain Planet. For years they had one goal and one goal only ... pollution. These eco-villains never had any monetary goal, no method to their madness .... They just wanted to pollute -plain and simple. They poured toxic sludge on baby seals, Smooth as Silk released poisonous gasses into nurs­eries and stuffed landfills full of non­biodegradable materials. Finally, they've achieved their goal: Global warming. And we couldn't be happier. 
Global warming is the hottest (pun intended) thing to land in the U.S.-no, the world, since the old Heartland closed up and gave way to Michiana's number one bar/nightclub. Unfortunately, many are failing to appreciate said hotness. People everywhere are complaining about this "warming trend". Notre Dame has even pledged to fight global warming in its new commercial. Such a commo­tion hasn't been raised over an issue like this since Ricki Lake hung up her mic. But unlike that tragic moment, global warming has tremendous upside. 
The best thing about global warming is that it, like the inability to understand the appeal of Drew Barrymore, is global. 



Global warming doesn't discriminate, it affects everyone. Having something awe­some in common will help unite people of all nations. No longer will Eskimos and Jamaicans clash over climatic differ­ences. Instead they'll come together to construct killer sand igloos and stuff like that. Russians and Americans will be able to look past that "Cold" War non­sense and set aside their differences ... it'd be like the end of Rocky IV except without the crappy sequel(s). But per­haps most important of all, Africans and Asians will fmally have something to talk about at barbeques.(lt's about time!) 
Global warming not only heats up the party, but also it cools down the griev­ances that could potentially stand in the way of a global mega bash (GMB). The kick butt-ness of this party is almost inconceivable to the human mind. Picture the resulting love child of a three­some involving World War II, Woodstock and Mardi Gras, multiply it by infinity and you've got roughly 1/3 of the GMB. 
Not only does global warming facilitate gargantuan galas, it will also help squash the lamest thing on campus outside of Jimmy Clausen's haircut ... the career fair. The career fair sucks. To get any sort of job you've either got to be faker than lieutenant Dan's legs or be a com­plete douche bag. No one likes to stand in line hearing the same joke about how dressed up everyone is, wearing an uncomfortable suit and holding a leather folder that will serve no other purpose in life except to talk to some recruiter who looks like he's trying to sell ice to Eskimos. Those dudes rattle oil' more awful jokes than Carlos Mencia in a three hour special. The days of the career fair making students feel like crap about their preparedness for the future are nearing their end. Global warming will solve this problem by making careers out of what used to be strictly summer jobs. 

Year-round warm weather will create year-round demand for life-guards, ice cream shop cashiers, dog-walkers, land­scapers and countless others. The transi­tion from college employment to perma­nent career would be seamless. Instead of slumping over your cubicle's desk, fill­ing out pointless spread sheets and get­ting Lumberg's coffee, students will be able to lounge in their guard tower, tell little kids what to do and scope out fly honeyz. 
This proves beyond a reasonable doubt that global warming is both a reality and a blessing. Global warming has been sci­entifically verified by the Kessler and research team in Bellevue, Wash. Now people everywhere will be able to save money on firewood, birds will save on their yearly travel bills, bears will be hangin' out all year round and penguins suck anyway. Take that AI Gore!

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
CIA, Raytheon's place at ND debated 
Country does not surpass God 
Country, God, Notre Dame. Perhaps tllis should be the new sequence of our University's age-old maxim. Because, as Nic Ponzio wrote in his letter ("Keep the career fair unrestricted," Sept. 19), refusing organizations with policies at odds with our University's mission statement "would infringe upon our duty to pay service to  our country." We must, therefore, place our obligations to the state above any sort of pursuit of justice and the common good. 
Unfortunately for Ponzio's argument, our nlission statement makes no mention of any requirement for our University to lay down its principles at the hands of the state. In fact, it seems to say the opposite. 
It says we, as a University, should try to become more aware of the injustices that are a crushing burden for so many in the world. It does not say to ignore these injus­tices when they are committed by our own government or the corporations which support our military-industrial complex. It does not say to work for justice until such a quest finds you questioning your own government and those connected to it. It does not say that the common good means the good of the state. 
I am also concerned that Ponzio, and perhaps others, do not understand the depth to which both the CIA and Raytheon contradict our University's nlission. Ponzio would have us think that the manufacturing of deadly weapons only constitutes a "small aspect" of Raytheon's work. Unfortunately, this assumption could not be fur­ther from the truth. The Army Times Publishing Company, a leading military and government news publisher, found that 96.1 percent of Raytheon's revenues came from military contracts with the Department of Defense. Last year the company's revenues came to $20.2 billion. Consequently, Raytheon received over $19 billion in one year alone in arms production -hardly a small aspect by any stretch of the imagination. 
The resume of the CIA is scarred with torture, forced disappearance and the oper­ation of secret prisons. Just today, The Economist raised concerns about the "black sites" where detainees are held by the CIA, the existence of which President Bush admitted last year. Oddly enough, Ponzio accepted such evidence as valid yet still believes that our mission to support the government supercedes such scandalous injustice. 
If Ponzio delved deeper into Notre Dame's history, he would find a story of another student protest against the CIA. In 1968, pressure from students forced the University to reevaluate its position on campus recruitment. But while students dur­ing the height of the Vietnam era questioned the morality of involvement with such an organization, Ponzio might refer to such actions as "asinine and ignorant." I would say these actions are worthy of a more serious, mature reflection. 
While Ponzio hopes to keep the Job Fair "unrestricted," regrettably, the only restriction at yesterday's event was imposed against student free speech. A total of six Notre Dame students, including myself, were kicked out of the event by NDSP officers for handing out information on the CIA and Raytheon. As individual stu­dents, we are apparently not allowed to express our concern for issues that form the cornerstone of our University. It seems as though Nic Ponzio is not alone in his view. 
Country, God, Notre Dame indeed.

Women's Soccer: Thanks for support 
Dear Students, 
On behalf of my staff and the entire women's soccer team, I wanted to thank you for your attendance and support so far this season. We would like to especially thank the "mob" from O'Neill Hall who came out in full force for our game against Princeton Friday night. Know that your support and encouragement does not go unnoticed by our team. 
With that said, we could use even more of you in the stands this weekend. We open up Big East play on Friday at 7:30p.m. against DePaul, and then take on nationally-ranked Penn State on Sunday at 12:30 p.m. The Penn State game, televised live on ESPNU, is a rematch of last year's NCAA quar­terfinals, and we need a huge crowd there to create an imposing atmos­phere for the Nittany Lions. Don't underestimate the impact you can make for us, as we take on a team looking to avenge their loss to us. 
I appreciate your continued support throughout the season and look for­ward to seeing you on Friday and Sunday. Go Irish!

women's soccer coach

Organizations not to blame 
The ostensible target of the Sept. 19 article entitled "Recruiters incompatible with Notre Dame mission" is the CIA and Raytheon. However, many of the criticisms go dis­turbingly deeper than just a preemptive attack on these organizations. The over arching criticism is that "these organizations are founded on the propagation of a society that creates and consumes violence." Which of the companies visiting for the Career Expo is not supported by our society? Regardless of our society's alleged addiction to violence, you cannot blame organizations for being supported by that society. 
The specific criticism of Raytheon is that their "profit increases only as American actions take the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians." This is not an argument against Raytheon as a specific organization, but an argument against capitalism. As long as wars are fought and armies armed, there will be a need for weapons and arma­ments. Let me be the first to be thankful that companies are willing and able to provide our armed forces with the highest technologically advanced weaponry available. 
As for the CIA, they are condemned for "their morally questionable involvement in the War on Terror." Last time I checked, the CIA was not a lone rebel government agency single-handedly fending off those who would slaughter us in the name of Allah. It seems to me that the authors have a broader beef with our foreign policy than the CIA finds itself a part of. 
Basically, the authors of this piece have used the presence of the CIA and Raytheon on campus as a whipping boy for our society, economic system and foreign policy. At the best, this is misleading, and at the worst, it is dishonest. Putting their blatant disdain for our way of life aside, let's take the authors' arguments at face value for a minute. Unfortunately, we will eventually have to venture out beyond Our Lady's University, and when we do, we will not have Father Jenkins to tell us which jobs we should and should not consider. Consider, though, that in his inaugural address Father Jenkins asked, "If we are afraid to be different from the world, how can we make a difference in the world?" If we truly do want to make a difference in this world, wouldn't it make much more sense to send out Notre Dame graduates to every possible place in order to make a positive impact by bringing our unique combination of morals and education to bear in a range of settings and situations? 
Our goal should not be to shelter Domers from the big bad world but rather to send out graduates to these "morally troubling" institutions so that we may make a positive impact in the world against the Trinity Evils: Society, Economy and Foreign Policy. 
Drew Clary junior abroad Sept. 20 

Show school spirit 
Dear fellow students, 
I would like to encourage everyone to be as pumped up for tllis weekend's game as you could ever be. It's been over a year since we've had a truly electric atmosphere on this campus and our team needs us more than ever. So here's how it goes: Go nuts. Be crazy. Pop some blood vessels ifyou have to. Just cheer your butt off, as it's really not too hard. Same goes for you, alums. As important as it is we're all wearing The Shirt today to show solidarity, it's slightly more important we go crazy when the game is actually happening. 
I would also like to encourage the Notre Dame Stadium ushers to stop throwing out innocent, legal students from the stadium, especially when their only infraction is trying to get others excited. I know plucking students out of their seats for public intoxication is akin to shooting fish in a barrel, but I'm sure one of the thousands of older alumni coming in for the senior alumni game could use your assistance in finding their seats. 
Thank you.

Jones' departure leads to embarrassment 
As everyone knows, Demetrius Jones has departed for Northern Illinois University. Now it is being reported that Notre Dame is refusing to release him from his scholar­ship, which will require that he pay tuition when he enrolls at NIU. Athletic Director Kevin White explains this by saying, "We don't believe his departure was handled appropriately." Granted, Jones may have acted immaturely, as 19-year-olds do some­times. But would it be too unreasonable to expect a Christian university to forgive the rash, emotional actions of a kid who has just suffered serious disappointment? I am not asking the University to sacrifice anything; I am just making the relatively undemanding suggestion that Notre Dame not take actions motivated primarily by spite. The football team's performance on the field has been embarrassing. It might be wise for the athletic department to not embarass the University off the field as well, especially when it would cost them virtually nothing.

In his track "Mutually Exelusive," it's almost impossible to not be rmnindnd of Oasis, with tho samn <tit-rock sound and lyrics. Bonds approach to writing music has served him well. 
"It's rn&lly interesting how this wholn inspiratio)1 things works," Bond said, "It's always important not to force a song. It will come when it's ready. If I don't l'nel tlw emotion, what's the point'?" 
This "wait-and-see" approach has worked won­ders for his music. Unlike so many bands in today's pop-scene, Bond's music sounds inspired. tran­scending the power chord progressions wreaking havoc in modnrn rock. But this talent can't be attributed solely to luck -Bond has spent years gntting it right, and music has long been a part of his lifo.

"My morn actually caught me watching the sym­phony when I was three or four years old," Bond said. "She went to the change thn channel, and I startnd crying." 
Not a typil:al response from most toddlers. Th~n again, Bond is anything but typical. His first guitar carne as a gift from his uncle at the agn of s1wtm, and immediately Bond was in love.

Now as an adult. Bond keeps his skills sharp with a show at least overy few weeks, while trying to bal­ance the rnst of his interests. Unn of these interests? Notre Dame. 
"I never really paid much attention to Notre Dame until I met two of my best friends in college," Bond said. "They were both die-hard Notre Dame fans. I started following the team a little and eventually made my Jirst trip to campus. I was in awe. I just totally identified with everything about the school. The way they treated their athletes, their standards, their mission, everything." 
But beyond this passion for the university, Bond's love for music is paramount.)le puts his whole heart and soul into his sound, and for good reason. "I don't understand the power of music, but I'm in awe of it, and I'm constantly humbled by it," Bond 
Dramatic? Perhaps. 
But mostly, it's the 
truth, and a musician 
with Bond's dedication 
and scope is a breath of fresh air in today's relatively stale and commer­cialized pop-music scene. As Bond said, "Truly inspired music sounds inspired." Yes, yes it does. 
The Surreal McCoys 
Bond will open for the Surreal McCoys, a high­octane combination of The Clash-meets-Johnny Cash. 
"It's kind of the twang of country music with the thrash and intensity of punk rock," said Shawn Ryan, one of the McCoys. "And it's a whole lot of fun to play." 
The combination is evident in "The Velvet Rope of Your Heart," one of the McCoys' original tunes: "Can't substitute love for addiction I Can't feed you truth when you're starving for fiction I That's just not part of my program anymore." 
The McCoys debuted three new original songs Thursday night in a show in Michigan and will have a slew of new covers in their repertoire for the gig at Simeri's tonight. Still, they're all about the audi­ence involvement. Ryan said he encourages full par­ticipation, even a little stage-hogging from the women in attendance. 
It was back in 1991, while Ryan was a Notre Dame Law School student, that the band first coalesced. The group includes five NDLS alumni -among them, three double domers. 
In 1992, after Ryan's graduation, the band split up. A decade later, with members living near each other again, they revived the group and even made an appearance on National Public Radio in December 2005. 
They attracted a following on the message boards of NDNation.com, where Ryan posts, and where he first listened to Bond's demo tape before asking the musician to open tonight.

"Right with the World" is a sentimental song of hope, and "Dear God" sounds like the Irish pop band The Corrs. Funky tunes like "Australia" pop up without warning. The Elders weave back and forth between joy and pain with effortless strength. 
Tickets for the show are available at the DPAC box office. Tickets cost $28 for regular admission, $24 for faculty, staff, and seniors and $15 for students.

OBSERVER GRAPHIC I Madeline Nies 

By MICHELLE FORD ICE  
Assistant Scene Editor  
The Department of Film, Television  
and Theatre and the Notre Dame  
iNDustry Alliance continue their  
annual tradition of bringing film  
industry leaders to Notre Dame  
tonight, with a panel of three screen­ 
writers to speak at the DPAC.  
Larry Karaszewski, Jim Jennewein,  
and Stephen Susco will share their  
knowledge of film writing.  
Speakers will present clips they  
chose from their films and speak  
about their experiences with writing  
and developing ideas, but will concen­ - 
trate on interacting with the audience  
and taking questions. FTT faculty  
member Ted Mandell, who helped to  
organize the event, remarked that  
students will "learn a lot."  
The event is aimed at all Notre  
Dame students, not just FTT majors.  
The iNDustry Alliance is made up of  
Notre Dame alumni with careers in  
the film industry, including a wide  
range of majors. With these events  
(last year they brought director Tony  
Bill), they hope to expose Notre Dame  
students to career possibilities.  
Acclaimed screenwriter Larry  
Karaszewski is a South Bend native  
(he graduated from Riley High School)  
who worked as an on-air film critic  
for WNDU and a comedy writer for  
the Peabody Award-winning local tele­ 
vision show "Beyond Our Control."  
Along with his writing partner Scott  
Alexander, he has built a successful  
career in screenwriting. Together they  
have won a Golden Globe and a  
Golden Satellite Award for "The  
People vs. Larry Flynt" as well as a  
special Writers Guild award for their  
work with civil rights and liberties.  
Jim Jennewein, a 1977 Notre Dame  
graduate, has worked as both an  
advertising and film writer. Working  
on movies such as "Richie Rich," "The  
Flinstones" and "Major League II,"  
Jennewein has over 17 years of film  
writing experience. Jennewein. about  
to publish his first book, a comedy  
adventure for young adults, can also offer advice to aspiring authors.  ...  
Stephen Susco, a 1995 Notre Dame  
graduate, launched himself into suc­ 
cess with his first produced script for  
the "The Grudge," which ultimately  
grossed over $300 million worldwide.  
He has also written scripts for "The  
Grudge II," "The Forge of God" and  
"Crawlspace." He is currently produc­ 
ing three films, which he helped to  
write, "The Dibbuk Box," "Zero. Dark.  
Thirty" and "RED."  
The talk at 7:30 p.m. is a _free, but  
ticketed event in the Browning  
Cinema at the DPAC. Tickets can be  
requested from the DPAC ticket office.

CiallS. 
The Elders, that's what. 
Their sound is infectious. With lilting melodies and a jamming bass, The Elders manage to fuse Irish musical style with American folk­rock. Put simply, these rock­ers kick arse. 
The Elders are most often found play­
groups like Asleep at the Wheel. Tommy Shaw Band and The Rainmakers. 
Formed in Kansas City, Kan., the band has toured all over the U.S., including Denver, Chicago, and New York. They even took their act to Ireland in 2003 and got in touch with their roots. Theband includes five Kansas musicians, guitarist Steve Phillips, bassist Norm

Associated Press 

BUFFALO, N.Y. -Kevin Everett will be transferred Friday morning to a Houston hospital to begin the next phase of his reha­bilitation, less than two weeks after the Buffalo Bills tight end sustained a 
life-threatening  spinal  
cord injury.  
And  doctors  said  

Thursday they believe he will be walking within weeks perhaps sooner. 
"Soon ... they're going to stand him up," Dr. Barth Green told The Associated Press, shortly after dis­cussing Everett's condition with Bills orthopedic sur­geon Dr. Andrew Cappuccino. "They're very 
very soon  ...  in the next  
days  or  weeks,  not  
months."  

Eric Armstead, a partner of Everett's agent Brian Overstreet, said Everett was going to Houston's Memorial Hermann Hospital and would be traveling by private plane. 
"I talked to him today, and he's very excited," Armstead said. 
The prognosis is remark­able after Everett arrived at Millard Fillmore Gates Hospital paralyzed from the neck down after being hurt while making a tackle in Buffalo's season opener against Denver on Sept. 9. Doctors initially expressed fears Everett would never 
Green is chairman of the neurological surgery department at the University of Miami school of medicine and has received regular updates from Everett's doctors on the player's progress. 
"Now that doesn't mean he'll be walking normally, but standing up and hold­ing his own weight," Green said. "I think the future for him is very bright." 
"He's strong, you all, I'm telling you he's strong," Everett's mother, Patricia Dugas said. "Kevin's going to get up walking and take care of his business like he always has. I don't think life is going to change that much." 
Bills spokesman Scott Berchtold said the team had no update on Everett's status. 
Everett makes his offsea­son home in Houston, where many of his family members and friends live. 
Green suggested Houston would be the best place to move Everett because it's important for the player to have his fam­ily and friends nearby. 
"I love the Buffalo peo­ple, and I'll hate to leave them," Dugas said. "But -­it'll be good that we can be closer to home for all our family to come over and see him because they're worried about him.... He wants to see his family, too." 
IN BRIEF 

Landis found f!Uilty, forfeits Tour title and gelstwo-year ban PARIS-The verdict said "guilty." 
Like so much else in the confusing, contentious Floyd Landis doping case, though, none of the answers are really that simple. 
Landis lost his expensive and explosive case Thursday when two of three arbitrators upheld the results of a test that showed the 2006 Tour de France champion used synthetic testosterone to fuel his spectacular comeback victory. 
The decision means Landis, who repeatedly has denied using per­formance-enhancing drugs, must forfeit his Tour title and is subject to a two-year ban, retroactive to Jan. 30, 2007. 
Not that it changes his opinion of who the rightful winner was. "I am innocent," he said, "and we proved I am innocent." The majority of the panel dis­agreed. 
NFL confiscates and destroys
Patriots videotapes 
NEW YORK -The NFL has received and destroyed all materials it requested from the New England Patriots concerning videotaping of opponents' sidelines. 
A league statement Thursday said the team was in compliance with a request for tapes and other docu­ments. 
"The Patriots have fully cooperat­ed and complied with the require­ments of the commissioner's deci­sion," the statement said. "All tapes, documents and other records relat­ing to this matter were turned over to the league office and destroyed, and the Patriots have certified in writing that no copies or other records exist. 
"League policies on in-game video­taping and audio communication will continue to be closely monitored and strictly enforced with all 32 teams." 
Feds bust house filled with 
steroids in New Jersey 
NEWARK, N.J. -Federal agents on Thursday seized more than 40,000 doses of illegal anabolic steroids from a central New Jersey home they said was being used as a factory. ­
The manufacturing was done in the basement of the Sayreville home of Alfred Scarpa, an electrician who was arrested by the Drug Enforcement Agency, authorities said. 
.....

Scarpa, 34, admitted he was involved with buying, making and selling steroids, according to a crimi­nal complaint filed in federal court. He was ordered held without bail. 
A message seeking comment from Scarpa's lawyer was not immediately returned. 
DEA agents also seized $56,000 and two semiautomatic handguns at the home, where the basement was filled with "tubs, bottles, vials."

Wright throws for 275 yards and two TDs, Miami holds A&M to 38 yards in first half 
Associated Press 

MIAMI -For one night, everything worked for the Miami Hurricanes, who finally got that signature win the pro­gram has craved for a couple of years. 
Kyle Wright threw for 275 yards and two touchdowns, Graig Cooper scored twice and the Hurricanes stymied No. 20 Texas A&M's high-powered offense in a 34-17 victory Thursday night. 
The win was only Miami's second in its last nine games against a ranked opponent dating to the end of the 2005 season. 
And it was never in doubt. 
The Hurricanes (3-1) held 
the Aggies (3-1) to 38 yards in the first half yards in taking a 24-0 lead, ensuring their final Thursday night game at the venerable Orange Bowl would be a memorable one. 
"It was a Thursday night game, prime time, so the nation got to 

come out and see what we really have as a University of Miami football team," Hurricanes coach Handy Shannon said. "I'm pleased with the victory, but I just said in the locker room ... we'll come back Sunday and get ready for our next opponent, which is Duke." 
Wright completed 21 of 26 passes, finding Cooper with one scoring throw and Chris ZelJner with another late in the third quarter to push the lead to 31-0. Sam Shields had six Matt Szymanski's 32-yard field goal with 11 :40 left. 
By then, the outcome was decided, and the Miami mood was so joyous that university president Donna Shalala was posing for photos with smiling guests on the sideline as the clock ticked down. 
"We just got beat, got beat by a better team," Texas A&M coach Dennis Franchione said. 
Miami scored 10 points ofT three Texas A&M turnovers in 
·the final 3:40 of' the hall'­more midweek magic for the Hurricanes, who won their final 10 Thursday games in the Orange Bowl. And Wright may have played the best game of' his Miami career, too. On their first possession, Wright and the Hurricanes

snap, a new

Texas A&M's three leading rushers -McGee, Mike Goodson and Jorvorskie Lane -came into the game averag­ing a combined 235 yards, a big reason why the Aggies' were ranked fifth nationally in rushing offense with nearly 300 yards per outing as a team.

Towles has career night in Cards win 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS -J.R. Towles jus­tified his jump from Class A to the major leagues in one bril­liant game. 
Towles went 4-for-4 with a franchise-record eight RBis and the Houston Astros reached season highs in runs and hits in an 18-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday night. 
"I can't even describe it," Towles said. "This is the last thing I thought would happen. Coming up to the big leagues was pretty impressive and this is beyond words." 
It also was the most lopsided victory ever for Houston, one more than the previous mark. 
Towles hit a two-run double off Braden Looper (12-11) in the second to open the scor­ing. He added a two-run sin­gle in the fourth, an RBI dou­ble in the sixth and a bases­loaded walk in the eighth before hitting his first career homer in the ninth off Aaron Miles. 
Miles, an infielder, was on the mound because the Cardinals were short on pitch­ers after allowing 10 or more runs for the second time in four games. They also went 10 innings to beat the Phillies 2-1 on Wednesday night. 
"We've been beaten bad before," Miles said. "Every team has. You come in the next day and have a short memory and come in positive and try to win a ballgame." 
Towles, a 23-year-old catch­er, began the year at Single-A Salem and was among the September callups, going 3­for-13 with one RBI in five games before Thursday. Interim manager Cecil Cooper wasn't planning on having Towles in the lineup on Friday, but that's out the win­dow. 
"It takes some guys two weeks to get that," Cooper said. "I was going to sit him tomorrow but I don't think I can do that now." 
His record-setting night came in the opener of a four­game series matching out-of­the-running teams that com­bined for the last three National League pennants and 10 of the last 13 NL Central 
· titles. 
The Astros finished with 23 hits and won for the fifth time in 15 games. They surpassed their previous bests for runs 
(15) and hits (22) established

Polamalu wouldn't say so, but the read-between-the-lines analo­gy is that Tomlin is making fewer suggestions and taking less of a role in dictating the game plan than Cowher did. 
Like Tomlin, Cowher also was a defensive coordinator before becoming a head coach. 
"I think he (Tomlin) has so much respect for Coaeh LeBeau, rightly so, that he just said, 'Hey, do what you do best,"' Polamalu said. 
Tomlin confirmed that. 

"We have players here that have been acquired to fit that scheme and what they do, they do well," Tomlin said. "That's coach­ing to me, putting your players in a position to do well. It's no ques­tion that we have people that have continuity with the scheme. ... I have a lot of respect for Coach LeBeau." 
Among LeBeau's other new looks thL'i season is moving defen­sive end Brett Keisel around, giv­ing him more freedom to make plays in a defense in which the outside linebackers get much of the pass rush responsibility. 
The cornerbacks have been more active as pass rushers, too, as evidenced by the fact that the Steelers' 10 sacks are divided among nine players. Last year, the Steelers had only 39 sacks all season.

Big East play begins on road 
By PAT O'BRIEN and 
ELLYN MICHALAK 
Spons Writers 
After going 1-2 this past week­end in Santa Clara's Bronco Invitational, the Irish will take the road again -but this time they hope to bring home more than one win. 

The Irish upset No. 22 Santa Clara after losing to California and UC Santa Barbara last weeknnd and are ready to start conference play at Pittsburgh and West Virginia. 
"We were disappointed to come back with only one win, but we felt good about the win against Santa Clara," coach Debbie Brown said. "Coming back and winning a game against a tough team after being down 0-2 for the weekend really showed the team's character. We are looking forward to this weekend because I feel we have prepared well to face our Big East opponents." 
Notre Dame is led by sopho­more outside hitter Megan Fesl and senior captain outside hitter Adrianna Stasiuk. Fesl has recorded 141 kills and 103 digs this year, while Stasiuk has notched 129 kills and a team­high 137 digs. 
Sophomore outside hitter Serinity Phillips has also played well -compiling 130 kills and 63 digs of her own. Senior setter Ashley Tarutis has helped with a team-high 407 assists.

Freshman libero Angela Puente has added 125 digs, while classmate Kellie Sciacca has 101 kills. 
Last season the Irish fell 3-1 to the Panthers. The Panthers cur­rently hold a season record of 6­7 and arc coming off a 0-3 loss to No. 5 UCLA and a 3-0 victory over Cal State Northridge. This season the Panthers have dropped 0-3 decisions to both No. 10 Michigan and No. 15 San Diego. 
"Pittsburgh is a very strong team that has always played very well," Brown said. "They have beaten us the past couple of years, but our motivation is strong, and we are hoping to win against them this weekend." 
The Panthers am led by junior outside hitter Kelly Campbell and senior outside hitter Diana Andreyko with 187 and 177 kills, respectively. Sophomore libero Michelle Rossi paces Pitt with 216 digs and freshman set­ter Emily Burke has 512 assists this season. 
The match against West VIrginia leatures a Mountaineer team with an 8-3 reeord that lost to Notre Dame 3-0 last year. They have beaten Buffalo, Canisius and Akron this year, but were on the losing end against Butler, Marshall and Pepperdine. The Mountaineers have not faced a current top-25 team this year. 
"West VIrginia has a team with a few very good seniors, so they have good experience," Brown said. "Playing on the road is always tough, but we are looking to go 2-0 on the weekend."

NFL 
47-year old kicker 
returns to Falcons 
Associated Press 
FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. ­Morten Andersen has got this down pat. Sit out training camp. Watch the first two games on television while sip­ping on some nice, cold brews. Then report to the Atlanta Faleons armed with plenty of old-man jokes. 
"It's Yogi Berra," Andersen quipped. "It's deja vu all over again." 
For the second year in a row, the Falcons sent out a belated call to Andersen to rescue their sorry kicking game. He was more than happy to help out, because this puts the 4 7 -year­old freak of nature another sea­son closer to his ultimate goal: playing until he's 50 and pass­ing George Blanda as the oldest player in NFL history. 
"This is what I was meant to be doing," Andersen said. "This is my calling." 
He's already the leading scor­er in NFL history, an ambition fulfilled last season after he was called in by the Falcons to replace Michael Koenen, who missed six of eight field goal attempts in the first two games. 
This time, it was another untested kicker who flopped. 
Looking for someone with a stronger leg who might be around a few years, the Falcons decided to go with 23­year-old Matt Prater, even though he had never kicked in the NFL and only joined the team before its final preseason game. 
The lack of experience showed when Prater made one of four attempts in the first two games, his fate sealed when he shanked a 26-yarder against the Jacksonville Jaguars last Sunday. It didn't take long for the Falcons (0-2) to dig up Andersen's number. 
"I was just sitting on the couch with some of my neigh­bors Sunday evening, having a couple of cold ones," he said. "The next thing I know, my phone rang. It was personnel asking, 'Can you come in tomorrow?' I told them, 'Not too early, I hope."' 
Andersen ran through a quick tryout at the Falcons' complex on Monday afternoon and agreed to a contract by that evening. He joins a team rocked by the Michael Vick dogfighting saga and that has scored only 10 points heading into Sunday's home opener against Carolina {1-1). 
"I was excited to hear about Mort," Falcons center Todd McClure said. "We all know what he's done for us in the past with the kieking game. We need to score points when we can get them." 
This is Andersen's third stint with Atlanta. lie is best remem­bered for making the kiek that sent the Falcons to their lone Super Bowl during the 1998 season, but his career appeared over -just 77 points shy of career scoring leader Gary Anderson -when no one called heading into 2005. 
Andersen sat out an entire season but keeping himself in shape, he also kept pestering the Falcons, having settled in Atlanta during his first go­round with the team. 
When Koenen, who still han­dles the Falcons' punting, struggled as a kicker at the start of last season, Mr. Reliable came to the rescue. Andersen made 20 of 23 attempts (one was blocked) and all 27 extra points, replacing his near-namesake at the top of the scoring list with 2,445 points.

Mets give up leads, lose in 10 innings 

Associated Press 
MIAMI -The New York Mets twice blew a three-run lead, and they might be about to blow the NL East. 
With closer Billy Wagner out because of back spasms, the Florida Marlins took advantage to rally in the ninth inning, then scored in the 1Oth on Dan Uggla's RBI double to beat New York 8-7 Thursday night. 
The Mets' lead was cut to 1 1/2 games by second-place Philadelphia, which rallied past Washington 7-6. New York led by seven games on Sept. 12 but has lost six of their past seven. 
"Things are not going our way," center fielder Carlos Beltran said. "It seems like every team comes back on us real easy." 
The latest loss was filled with bad vibes for the Mets. 




You've worked hord on your educotion, novv let GE he!p you bui!d your career_ GE has o wodd-renovJned leodership h.:dning program ond was nomed Best Company for Leaders by Chief Executi\le Magazine in 200/. \Ne invite you to invest in yourself with a career in engineerinq, finonce, manufacturing, soles and mmketing, hurncm resources, or information technology. 


Minus Wagner, New York gave up three runs in the ninth that forced extra innings. Starter Tom Glavine, unbeaten since July 2, failed to hold a 3-0 lead. Right fielder Lastings Milledge was ejected after he flied out in the seventh. Reliever Aaron Heilman was hit by a ball thrown from the stands in the eighth. 
"We're in a rut right now," Glavine said. "There are a lot of crazy things happening. We seemed to have a little bit of everything go wrong." 
Even so, the Mets scored four times in the ninth to take a 7-4 lead, keyed by pinch-hitter Marlon Anderson's three-run double. 
"After we scored four in the ninth, I was saying, 'We've got this one,'" Beltran said. "But we didn't." 
Florida outhit the Mets 21-9, 
and five hits and three runs came off Jorge Sosa (9-8), who failed in a bid for his first save of the season. 
Wagner said his upper back bothered him before the game. He received treatment, but when he tried to warm up for the ninth, he was able to throw only one pitch. 
"It locked up again, and I just couldn't do anything,'' Wagner said. "It stinks. It's my job. I should be the one out there either getting it done or not get­ting it done." 
Wagner said his status is day to day. 
Jeremy Hermida led off the bottom of the ninth with a sin­gle and Miguel Cabrera dou­bled. Alfredo Amezaga's grounder scored a run, and another run came home on Mike Jacobs' infield hit. 
Cody Ross' fly ball landed a foot fair for a double, and the tying run scored on Matt Treanor's groundout. 
Hanley Ramirez led off the Florida lOth with an infield sin­gle, his 200th hit of the year. Uggla then doubled off the scoreboard and was mobbed by teammates as the dazed Mets walked off the field. 
Taylor Tankersley (6-1) pitched a scoreless 1Oth for the Marlins, who broke a four-game losing streak. They improved to 1-5 in Miami against the Mets this year. 
"For us to affect their season -­is huge,'' Jacobs said. "The way we won today, and the team we beat, make it doubly special." 
Moises Alou hit a two-run double in the Mets first to extend his hitting streak to 24 games, the longest of his career and the longest in the NL this year. 
But the Mets lost Milledge in the seventh, when the excitable outfielder was ejected by plate umpire Jim Joyce for arguing about balls and strikes after a flyout. Milledge went into the dugout, then came back onto the field to yell at Joyce and had to be restrained by coach Rickey Henderson. 
Milledge declined to talk to reporters after the game. 
The visitors had plenty of sup­port from the crowd of 15,132. Fans chanted "Let's go Mets!" beginning in the first inning, and when David Wright dou­bled home a run in the third, there were chants of "M-V-P! M-V-P!"

Clark is also aware of the troubles his teams have had with the Scarlet Knights. In his seven years at Notre Dame, Clark has managed only a 1-3-1 record against Hutgers ­induding a 2-1 overtime loss in last year's Big East tournament. 
Af'tnr Friday's tilt with Hutgnrs, Notn~ Dame will traV£~1 to Philadnlphia to take on No. 23 Villanova. The Wildcats havn won l'ivn consecutive games aftnr a 2-1 loss at Hichmond to opnn tlw snason. 
Two of thosn wins came in the prestigious Duke/Adidas Classic, when Villanova defeat­ed North Carolina State and then No. 2 Duke -pnrl'ormanc­es that left an impression on Clark. 
"If you go down to that tour­nament and win two games, you're a good team," Clark said. "It's as simple as that." 
A major reason for the Wildcats' impressive start has been their defense, which has­n't allowed a goal in the team's past four games. Senior goal­keeper .Jason Friel -one of the team's 11 returning starters ­has bonn especially impressive, compiling a 0.60 goals-against

like diches," Waldrum said. "It's more like just having that focus all the way through." 
Senior midlielder and captain Amanda Cinalli echoed Waldrum's feelings. 
"Collectively, we just need to stay more composed around the goal," she said. "We are creating those opportunities, and we had plenty of them. It's good that we're getting in our offensive end and getting those chances, but we just need to be more composed around the goal and finish those, whether it's with power or finesse." 
The Irish converted plenty of scoring chances in their last two games against the Blue Demons, whom they beat twice, 6-0 and 5­0, in 2005. DePaul is 2-5-1 and tied Northern Illinois 1-1 at horne in their last game. Going into Friday's game, Notre Dame has not lost to a Big Ea'it opponent at horne in 72 games. 
Notre Dame defeated Penn State 4-1 last season in the NCAA quar­terfinals. The Nittany lions are 4­2-1 entering Sunday's game and recently beat Bucknell 5-1 on the road. 
Although he is aware of the weapons both teams possess, Waldrum said he will not create a team-specific game plan. 
"I think right now we've got to get ourselves playing our way first before we can really try to game plan for anybody else," he said. "As a coaching staff we'll have some reminders for how we want to deal with certain players on the team, but right now I think the focus has been on us." 
Waldrum said that fitiluro to pay close attention ha'i eost the team so far. 
"Seeing the ball, you get relaxed, and you think, 'Well this is coming to me,' and for a moment you don't really eoncen­trate on the llight of tlm ball," he said. 
Waldrum also said scoring opportunities were squandered when the offense hurried. 
"We had a couple chances where players in and around the box could have settled and con­trolled the ball and then taken the shot," Waldrum said. "Instead of doing that, they rushed it and tried to hit it frrst time." 
The Irish face the same affiietion on defense. Bad passes in the defensive third and lack of eoncen­tration by the keepers have cost the team goals. Of the 13 goals scored against the Irish, Waldrum said the coaching staff counted eight that could be attributed to a miscue by Notre Dame. Despite the mistakes, Wald&urn said the talent is in plaee to succeed. 
"All the players have the ability to do it," Waldrum said. "It's just being engaged and focused and the little things." 
The Irish are still plagued by inconsistency at keeper. Senior Lauren Kara'i and froshman Nikki Weiss split time against Princeton last Friday, but Weiss played the entire Oklahoma State game Sunday. 
"We've thrown it back up in the air again, and we're going to see at the end of the week," Waldrum said. "That part still unli>rtunately has not got solved fi1r us eornplete­1y." 
Karas has allowed four goals and 2.24 goals per game, while Weiss ha'i let in fiw goals and 1.42 goal<; per gamn. 
Hegardlnss of the team's ques­tion marks, Waldrum remains confident. 
''I'm still convinced we're going to be a good hmrn," he said. "I believninit."

The Chicks, similarly, wish to go into the game with a positive frame of mind. 
"We have a really positive out­look for this season," Lewis senior captain Alexandra Persley said. "Things didn't go too well for us last year, but we have some key players back from abroad and an impressive freshman class." 
While she refused to comment specifically on their match-up with Welsh Family, Persley remarked on the Chicks' overall preparations. 
"We've brought in some great new coaches and we've been practicing hard for three weeks now," Persley said. 
As both teams prepare for their game on Sunday at Hiehle Field, Bushelle keeps the big picture in mind.

Carroll should present a for­midable challenge, particularly for the Zahm defense. Sophomore Jon Sarna will guide an offense that isn't afraid to stray from the inter­hall norm of smash mouth, run-first football. 
"We'll move the ball around, spread out our offense and pass the ball," senior captain wide receiver Kyle Kownacki said. "We aren't afraid to run it, either. We have a very ver­satile offense." 
For the spread offense to be successful, senior offensive linemen James Geyer, Jesse Greenwood and Mike O'Connor will have to protect Serna. Geyer and fellow senior defen­sive linemen Ben Gern and Milo Dodson will look to spend some quality time. in the Zahmbies' backfield blowing up plays. 
While the potential outcome is in doubt, one thing is certain: Carroll has earned the respect of the Zahm captain. 
"Every year I've been here, they have been pretty solid. Traditionally they hadn't been, but this senior class is really good," Wieland said. "It should be a pretty good battle." 
Knott vs. Siegfried 

This week's season opener between Mod Quad rivals Knott and Siegfried has more on the line than a 1-0 start to the sea­son. 
The game, which is usually scheduled as each dorm's opener, is one of the events in the Planner Cup, in which the two dorms compete for the naming rights of the slope behind Grace and Planner halls. Siegfried looks to repeat as winners this year and ensure that the slope retains its title as the "Siegfried Slope." 
Siegfried is very confident heading into the season after a strong performance last ye·ar. In addition to their 16-6 victory over Knott, the Ramblers made the playoffs, but lost in the semifinals.

This uncertainty in Sorin's passing game means a lot of opportunities for sophomore running back Hobert Gallic. 
"We are looking to establish the run more than in years past," Hove said. 
Senior outside linebacker Chris Schwarher and senior safety Mark Dummett lead the tough defense. They hope to help the Otters maintain their proud tradition of strong

"I feel confident th at  our

The oll'ense. and the offensive linn in particular. is a big focus for St. Ed's this year, according to coach Cameron !Iogue. 
"Our offensive line is huge this year. We are going to score a lot of points," Hogue said. 
With inexperienced freshman Matt Abeling at quarterback, St. Ed's intends 4-0 in the regu­
lar season but fell in the first round of the playoll's to Siegfried. 
As for returning players, the Knights have a lot of experi­ence in their secondary and linebacker positions to provide thn team with a "Keenan defense !that] wrecks people," junior captain Pat Burns said. 
However, the class of 2011 puts in their two cents towards the team too. 
"We have good freshmen on our offensive line," Burns said. "They should surprise a lot of people." 
A powerful force, Keenan hopes to use this to their advantage in Sunday's game. Keough, however, feels they should not be underestimated. 
Carroll vs. Zahm 
Sunday's 3 p.m. matchup between Carroll and Zahm pits a pair of teams looking to build on a season that saw both teams make the playoffs ­only to lose in the opening round. 
Zahm is especially anxious to get back on the field after its season ended with an agoniz­ing loss to Morrissey, the even­tual champion.

Now is not the time for quitters 
While making th11 long drive baek from Ann Arbor last week. I was listening to the Boston College-Georgia Tech game on the radio. As the game wound 
down and the Eagles elaimcd vic­tory, the announeer started read­ing through their next 


few games. Chris Khorey
"They've got Army, UMass and Sports Editor Bowling Green. Then they go to Notre Dame. 
"I don't think they'll be chal­lenged in any of those games." Army, UMass, Bowling Green 
-and Notre Dame 
That's what three embar­rassing losses have done to the Irish. Suddenly they are lumped in with the worst of the serviee academy teams, a MAC school, and a team from Division 1-AA. 
The rest of America has given up on this team and this school. ESPN is laughing. Taco Bell feels so bad that they're giving away free nachos to make Irish fans feel better. 
But here at Notre Dame, people don't give up so easily. 
There are nine games left in the season, and some of them may be ugly. 
But this campus cannot quit on this team. 
Pep rallies may have a dif­ferent atmosphere than they have in the past. Instead of bning about getting pumped up for victory, they will be more about getting through adversity together. More like "Notre Dame, Our Mother" than "Notrn Dame Victory March," if you will. 
Hallies cannot beeome morgues. The team will be there regardless, so which will motivate them more -stu­dents cheering their entrance or a bunch of empty seats? 
The same thing needs to happen in the stadium on Saturdays. The Stadium needs to be full and enthusiastic at every positive play. 
At the very least, there's not much else to do on a home game Saturday. But more importantly, the Irish family has to be there for the stu­dents that work every day to represent this University on that field. 
Of course, that brings up the other side of the coin -the team. 
The only reason this campus 


-Persons without authorization are not permitted on the field -No cans br glass bottles arc permitted in the stadium -The use of intoxicating substances is strictly prohibited -Throwing objects in the stands or onto the field is prohibited -Please, do not bring stadium chairs, scat backs or other oversized or 
noise-producing items into the stadium -Limited use of cameras, portable/handheld televisions and portable radios is permitted -In accordance with a St. Joseph County ordinance, there will be no smoking 
allowed in any part of Notre Dame Stadium -All persons are subject to search, which includes clothing, jackets, bags and purses (Violators are subject to ejection from the stadium and may have future ticket privileges revoked) 
would evor quit on this team is 
if the toam quit on tho season. 
Losing can be tolorated if the 
players are giving their all on 
every play of overy game. 
But being resigned to defeat, giving up on a play, or watch­ing the quarterback get saeknd whnn you could have prevented it is not aeeeptablo. Nor is laughing on the side­lines while your team is get­ting killed. 
There were disturbing signs of quitting during the Michigan game. Hopefully, Charlie Weis' "back to training camp" approach will adjust the attitude a little, but really, this team's attitude is its own responsibility. 
There are nine fifth-year seniors and ten true seniors on scholarship on this team. For all but a couple of them, this is their last season of col­lege football -and it might be their last season of football. period. 
They need to step up. In their play on the field, of  course, but much more impor­tantly, in their leadership in the locker room. The young players that make up so much of this team need someone to turn to, and "leading by exam­ple" isn't going to cut it. 
And for the younger players that have been thrust into aetion this season, there's no longer any reason to be nerv­ous. They've already lived through the worst, now they need to make things better. It's time to play like a champion. 
This season may live in infamy in Notre Dame history, but that's no reason to quit. 
It's time to circle the wag­ons. No one cares what ESPN says. No one cares about the ugly slats. Even the win-loss rocord doesn't really mattor anymore. 
The only thing that will make the rest of this season worth playing is for this entire campus to stand up and say, "We won't quit. We're going to get better." 
Because at Notre Dame, peo­ple are loyal "what tho' the odds be great or small." The odds may be great right now, but this team has talent and the coaches have very good track records. Through hard work and perseverance the Irish will be champions again -and soon.

Charlie Weis's suc­cess in his first 23 games as Notre Dame head coach suddenly seems like a distant memory. Five straight ugly losses, including three to open this sea­son, raise disturbing questions. Has he lost this team?  Jimmy Clausen has been doing his best in a very bad situation. He's completed over fifty per­cent of his passes when he's not getting sacked -but he's been on his back far too often. He needs to make reads more quickly. and get the ball out of his hands.  Notre Dame's awful rushing stats are mis­leading -the Irish are averaging around 80 postive rushing per game, but their slats have been killed by sacks. Even so, Notre Dame has been unable to achieve a consistent running attack this year.  When Notrn Dame has dropped back to pass this season, something bad has happened morn ofl.en than not. Between mceivers not getting open, an offensive line that can't bloek and a freshman quarterback learning as he goes, the passing game has been ugly.

Grimes brothers renew family, school rivalry 

By JAY FITZPATRICK Associate Sports Editor 
In 2003, St. Martin De Porres High School had two standout wide receivers. Both were two­sport athletes. Both caught touchdown passes in the Michigan Division-8 Championship game. 
And both were named Grimes. 
For three seasons, Notre 
Dame wide receiver David Grimes and his older brother -Spartans red-shirt junior wide receiver Carl Grimes ­played together at De Porres. 
"It was pretty cool to look over [to the other side of the field] and your big brother's right there," David Grimes said. "We already spend all hours of our lives together, why not do it on the field?" 
Now in college, the Grimes brothers will stand on opposite sidelines for the third time as their teams face off. 
The Grimes brothers were dominant as wideouts for De Porres. In his senior season,. Carl Grimes was De Porres' top offensive threat, accumulating 1,200 yards of total offense ­including 614 rushing yards on 69 carries-while missing five games with a bruised foot. 
Carl Grimes also amassed 514 receiving yards on only 28 catches in De Porres' 12-2 championship season in 2003. 
His younger brother was no slouch either that season, hauling in an 80-yard touch­down pass in De Porres' 20-9 win over Beal City in the title game. 
David Grimes was named an honorable mention all-confer­ence his junior season, while Carl Grimes was named to the all-state, all-Detroit and the all-Metro teams in his senior season. 
But despite the lengthy list of accolades, David Grimes said his big brother was more important to him as a brother than as a teammate. 
"[Carl helped me growl not just as a wide receiver but as a person," David said. "At a young age, he was the male figure in my life and I give him all the compliments and thanks in the world for that." 
Before signing with Michigan State as a senior, Carl Grimes was listed as a SuperPrep All­American and a top-1 0 recruit by the Lansing Journal (No. 5), Detroit News (No. 6) and Detroit Free Press (No. 9). Carl Grimes redshirted in 2004 with foot problems and has seven catches for 45 in his two full seasons at Michigan State. 
David Grimes said even though his older brother went to Michigan State, he is not a Spartans fan. 
"1 wanted for him to do good, but when I made my decision to come to Notre Dame, I knew that we would be in a rivalry pretty soon so I didn't want them to be that successful," David Grimes said. 
Notre Dame's Grimes came into his own during his senior season as starting wide receiv­er and defensive back for De Porres. He was first team on the Detroit Free Press all-state dream team as a wide receiver in 2004, catching 48 passes for 800 yards and eight touch­downs. He also made 41 tack­les and five interceptions. 
David Grimes led De Porres back to the championship game, but the team fell 14-7 to Unionville-Sebewaing -this time in Division 7. David played well in the title game and returned a fumble 36 yards for De Porres' only score. 
Even though David Grimes has great respect for his broth­er, he knew that after high school he wanted to branch out and make a name for himself. 
"I didn't want to go to Michigan State to be 'Carl's lit­tle brother,"' David Grimes said. "I wanted to develop my own identity." 
And Carl Grimes was willing to help. 
David Grimes said his big brother left the decision entire­ly up to him and did not try to convince him to go to Michigan State. 
The younger Grimes was recruited beginning in 2004 by Notre Dame under then-head coach Tyrone Willingham. After Willingham's firing, Charlie Weis continued the recruiting process. 
David Grimes said Weis was the most important factor in his decision to join the Irish. 
"He called me one day. He gave it to me real," David said. "He said, '[You're] gonna work and I plan on winning. And if you're on board, you're on board.' And that's all I needed to hear.'' 
Despite the rivalry, David Grimes said his family still roots for both brothers to do well. 
"My mother and my family seem not to show any side," he said. "They would prefer it just to be a good game. My mother predicted that the first time we played it would go to overtime and it did." 
With nail-biting finishes in 2005 and 2006, David Grimes said, emotions run even higher knowing that his brother is standing on the other sideline. 
"It was pretty exciting to look over and see your brother," he said. "Obviously the first year, they won and it wasn't too exciting. But the second year it was pretty damn awesome."

Dantonio prepares to face Irish for first time 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Editor 
Mark Dantonio may be in his first year as Michigan State's coach, but he is well acquaint­ed with the rivalry between Notre Dame and the Spartans. 
Dantonio spent six years as an assistant for Michigan State from 1995-2000, and knows anything can happen when the two teams battle, regardless of their records entering the game. 
"[Notre Dame has] excellent coaching, they have tradi­tion," Dantonio said. "They're backed into a corner a little bit. They have a rivalry with us, they played us last year here and you guys know the score on that one. And so it's a traditional rival. Any time you have a rival game, we need to be prepared." 
Dantonio. who coached Cincinnati for the past three seasons, replaced John Smith, who led the Spartans during their 44-41 win at Notre Dame in 2005 and their 40-37 loss to Notre Dame in 2006 at Spartan Stadium. 
Last season's loss devastat­
ed the Spartan faithful. 
Michigan State led by 17 at 
halftime but could not hold off 
the surging Irish in a driving 
rainstorm. The loss spelled 
the end for Smith, who was let 
go at the end of the season, 
and left the Michigan State 
program in disarray. 
Dantonio said Saturday is a big step in bringing the pro­gram back to national promi­nence. 
"But a lot of that I think 
rests with, as I said before, we need to continue to win the respect back of our fan base and the people," Dantonio said. "And that is an ongoing thing.... Our reputation is not built as of yet. We need to continue to do that. So we need to constantly remind ourselves of that. Stay grounded and understand what we have to accomplish. It's long term, though.'' 
Last Saturday, the Spartans defeated Pittsburgh 17-13 to improve to 3-0 this season, but, Dantonio said, his team must improve if it wants to stay undefeated. 
"From my perspective, ... we could have played better on Saturday. And we played a pretty good Pitt team. They played very square," Dantonio said. "You have to give Pitt a lot of credit. They had been working on that formation and those play scenarios since last spring from what I under­stand. They had not shown any in the prior two [games]. You know, they played very well defensively. Pitt's a much improved football team. But if you look at the game, we were our worst enemy at times. And my message to our team will always be about us, how we play. So we'll be pre­pared." 
After leaving Michigan State in 2000, Dantonio became the defensive coordinator at Ohio State and won a national title in 2002. Dantonio's defenses at Ohio State performed well -the Buckeyes ranked sec­ond in the nation in scoring defense in 2002 and were tenth overall in 2003. 
In 2004, Dantonio took over Cincinnati's program. He led the Bearcats to a 30-11 upset victory over then-No. 7 Rutgers last season. Cincinnati's defense ranked 27th in the nation in rushing last season, and the Bearcats finished 7-5. 
Dantonio's reputation as a solid defensive coach will be on the line against a sputter­ing Irish offense. The Spartans have allowed 88.7 rushing yards per game and 198 through the air. Notre Dame has averaged negative ­
4.7 yards rushing and 119.7 passing. But unlike Smith, Dantonio is reserved when he talks about Notre Dame. 
He is preparing his team for the Notre Dame of old, even though Notre Dame lost to Georgia Tech 33-3 at home to open the season and has dropped its last five home games against Michigan State. Despite Notre Dame's strug­gles, Dantonio said his team can't underestimate the Irish -especially since the game is at Notre Dame Stadium. 
"I think without question [Notre Dame] plays a home game where they were not successful, go away and play in two difficult environments. Now they get an opportunity ­to come back home," Dantonio said. "And it's always more special when you're playing at home. It's very difficult to win away games.... But I expect Notre Dame to be emotional. I expect them to be ... well prepared and eager to play."
