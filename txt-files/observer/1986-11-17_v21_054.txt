U.S. should send no more arms to Iran, Shultz says 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Secretary of State George Shultz said Sun­day the United States should make no more arms shipments to Iran, contending "I don't see any need for further signals" of U.S. good faith to moderate Iranians. 
Meanwhile, John Poindexter, President Reagan's national security adviser, said the U.S. arms embargo against Iran still stands and said he remains optimistic that more hostages may be released by pro-Iran forces in Lebanon. 
But Robert McFarlane, former national security ad­viser who made at least one se­cret trip to Iran, said his con­tacts among moderate Iranians are in danger of being killed now that his efforts have been made public. 
Senate Democratic leader Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V., urged the administration to state publicly that there would be no more arms shipments to Iran "or any other terrorist state." A congressional inves­tigation into administration dealings with Iran, which Reagan denies were direct negotiations for the release of hostages, is to begin this week. 
President Reagan, returning to the White House from Camp David, brushed aside a reporter's question as to whe­ther he had stopped arms ship­ments to Iran, saying, "I told you the truth once." The pres­ident did not pause as he es­corted Nancy Reagan into the White House.

Complacency can be a virtue before frantic senior year 
Complacency. 
I do not think that complacency is such a nasty word. We all feel complacent with what we ·are doing or where we are going at some time. As a matter of fact, complacency is what a great deal of people long for in their lives, all of their lives. 
Personally, I do not feel complacent about most of the things that I do. Maybe it is because I have read too many of the autobiographies lining modern bookshelves (i.e. Iacocca, Yeager, etc.). I feel like there is always a better way to do something than the way I happened to have done it. I always believe that there is room for improvement in what I do, new places about which to learn. 
I have learned a great deal about com­placency in society from my reflections on my hometown. Coming from New Orleans, I was one of few people from my high school who wanted to go "away" to college. When I said that I wanted to go to Notre Dame, many people asked me why I would want to leave such a great town. In New Orleans there is an abun­dance of rather raucous fun, great food, friendly people and consistently warm weather. 
I was often told by friends in New Orleans that I could get just as good an education at LSU as I could at Notre Dame. In some ways agree with them; if one applies himself, there is no limit to what one can learn despite the reputation of a university. However, I still decided to go to Notre Dame and publicized my reason for doing so as a desire to chase a dream. Now, I would like to believe that I was confusing a dream with the desire to do something differ­ent and to break out of the complacent mindset that I felt was prevalent in my hometown. 
When I came to Notre Dame, I certainly did find a new way of life. I met myriads of different people from all over the country. There were different lifestyles, different manners of speech and different nationalities under the Dome. I experienced snow and learned to get along with­out all of the rich, spicy food. I found out that the grass was not necessarily greener in the other fellow's yard but rather that there was another yard out there to explore. 
I am a junior now. I have been here for over two years and have learned the ropes. I have made many friends; I have made some enemies. Nevertheless, as I commented to someone this weekend after listening to a group of seniors sentimentalize, I am cloaked in the complacency of being a junior. 


This year is not the one in which I will set the stage for an onslaught of grey hair. I will begin to think of a career, but I really feel no pressure. As a junior, I am sitting back and watching many of my senior friends frantically pull out their hair and wonder what they are going to be doing ten years from now. For the first time in my life, complacency is not so bad. 
I have grown up since I came to Notre Dame. The complacent attitude I once thought I hated does not seem so bad to me now. I still believe in doing things better and getting different perspectives and striving to be the best; but, for the brief time that I have as a junior, I do not mind being somewhat complacent. 
The folks in New Orleans had a good point. A certain brand of complacency is not so bad. I am going to enjoy this good thing while I have it; it seems like it will be terribly hard to leave.

5 new members added to Board of Regents 
By MARILYN BENCHIK Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
Five new members were added to the ranks of the Saint Mary's College Board of Regents this year, including Sister Rose Anne Schultz, who was appointed acting chair­man. 
Other new members include Sister Geraldine Blume, Geral­dine Corbin, Virginia Collins and Rebecca Hetland. 
Schultz said she is optimistic about the role of the Board in implementing the basic values of the College. 
"At Saint Mary's, we're proud of the academic excel­lence, and the fact that as we meet the graduates a few years after they leave Saint Mary's, it's quite clear they're being strong Christian witnesses." 
"It is more difficult each year as more people move into the market place to maintain that Christian witness. We keep strengthening that at Saint Mary's," Schultz said. 
Schultz said she also intends "to expand the multi-cultural dimension at Saint Mary's in the faculty and the student body." She said she realizes this has to be a long-term plan, however. 
"Regents are elected for a 
three-year term, and they are 
eligible for a second three-year 
term with the following excep­
tions: the president of the 
Alumnae Board who serves a 
one-year term, the student 
regent who is selected for a 
one-year term, and the presi­dent of the College, who is a member for as long as the in­dividual holds the title," said William Hickey, president of the College. 
Collins, president of the Alumnae Association this year, said Hickey and Schultz act as ex-officio members to the Board. 
"That means you're a mem­ber by title with a vote. You can attend all of the committee meetings and vote at all of them or pick out one or two of interest to you," said Hickey. 
Collins' chief goals for her term include "increasing alumnae awareness of the needs and situation of the Col­lege as it is today and encour­aging expanded Alumnae par­ticipation." 
The Board is composed of seven different committees: the Committee on Education, Finance, Student Life, Devel­opment, Regents, Investment and Mission. 
"The Regents Committee presents the names of the nominees each year, and the Mission Committee's function is to become aware of the ways in which the College is imple­menting the mission of the Sisters of the Holy Cross," said Hickey. 
Hickey said the Mission Com­mittee is temporary and has existed for only two years. 
Hetland is the student repre­sentative for the Board this year. 
The student regent is chosen by a process in which "a letter goes out from the Dean of Stu­

dents, Sister Karol Jackowski, to second-semester juniors, and any student who is inter­ested in being considered for the position has to submit an application in which she indi­cates why she wants to be a regent and how she might rep­resent the students," said Hick­ey. 
"I would say they're looking for a good academic record but also a lot of involvement in dif­ferent activities. They're looking for a student who would represent a good percentage of the student body," said Het­land. 
Hetland serves on the Stu­dent Life Committee and the Mission Committee for the Board. "I believe in the goal of the institution as a women's

tion, and I wanted to become a regent because I'd like to see the College grow in this mis­sion.'' 
Sister Geraldine Blume's long-term goal for the Board is to "contribute to the better­ment of the College as a Cath­olic women's college." 
Blume is the principal of the Academy of the Holy Cross (an all-female secondary school), and she works on the Education Committee for the Board. 
"There is a compatible rela­tionship between an all-girls' Catholic high school and an all­womens' Catholic College," she said. 
Geraldine Corbin, a Saint Mary's alumna, is a Program Development Specialist for Continuing Education at Geor­gia State University. She is ser­vmg on the Education Committee. 
"I'd like to serve the College in helping them meet future goals, particularly in the area of diversification. 
"I think the current admin­istration, faculty and student body may be articulating the need for diversification now," she said. 
"Diversification in a Catho­lic women's college would have to be within limits. Beyond (the obvious) designations, there's room for diversification in race, culture and religion. 
"Diversification touches all of us; it is part of a well­rounded education. This should be an understanding of our own enrichment and growth," Cor­bin said.

Before the two were driven away from the mall in separate police cars, Mcintosh leaned out the window of his car and yelled "I love you!" to Lopez. 
They were scheduled for ar­raignment in federal court Monday on charges of hijack­ing, escape and kidnapping, said Inspector Louis Stefanelli of the marshal's office. 
Mcintosh and Lopez worked together at the country-club style federal prison at Pleasan­ton and often were seen walking together and holding hands, which is allowed there, said Warden Rob Roberts. 
Federal authorities said Mcintosh was arrested at Merksamer Jewelers and Lopez was picked up in a nearby store at the Birdcage Walk shopping mall in Citrus Heights, about 10 miles north­east of downtown Sacramento. 
"We caught them completely by surprise," said Chief Dep­uty Marshal David Stanton. "We'd been trailing them and had some very good leads due to the photograph that was out. We found out they'd been in the mall area and were going to return." 
Marshals said they traced the couple to the store by mon­itoring a checking account that Mcintosh kept under the alias Lyle Thompson. They said they were alerted when a $4,600 check to the jewelry store cleared the bank Thursday. 
Prosecutors said they feared Mcintosh, 43, might have had access to as much as $2 million. He pleaded guilty earlier this year to state charges in an $18 million San Francisco-based futures scam and was finishing a federal sentence for wire fraud before serving four years on the state conviction.

Congress can build on good and learn from bad 
There is an old theory concerning the voting tendencies of the American people. It has been proven true on in­numerable occasions in the long history of our great Republic. It is one of the things that has made America what it is: the most powerful and respected free country in the world. It holds that just as movement any further in one ideological direction would begin to seriously endanger the future of our great democratic Republic, the people of America begin to move in another. 
John Jaspers 
guest column 
No revolution can last forever, nor would we want it to. In 1949, the Chinese communist revolution succeeded in putting China firmly on the path to per­manent national independence. Not content with this, Chairman Mao tried to keep the People's Republic of China in a state of perpetual revolution. At first this led to progress, but the end result of permanent revolution was chaos. 
Only since 1979, with the coming-to­power of Deng Xiao Ping, has the era of revolution in China been perma­nently put to rest. By keeping and build­ing on what was good in the revolution and discarding what was not, the Chinese have since begun the new Long March to national development. 
For six years, the "Reagan Revolu­tion" has spread throughout the land. Though this "revolution" is on a com­pletely different level than the Chinese one, the revolutionary lesson of the Chinese still holds. In these six years, much good has been done. But also, much bad has been done. It is time to recognize and build on the good, while discarding the bad. 
We have built up the nation's strength. The American Navy, in par­ticular, is much more capable of car­rying out its primary mission, the securing of the seas, than it was before. The Army and the Air Force are also stronger. But some of the central prob­lems of our defense have gone virtually ignored. 
For the last six years, the present administration has been gleefully throwing buckets of money down the bottomless and wasteful pit of Star Wars research for already almost ob­solete B-1 bombers, a DIVAD <Divisional Air Defense) system that even Secretary of Defense Weinberger 
Doonesbury 
ultimately came out against, and the "Peacekeeper" M-X missile (by the way, the original justification for the M-X was that the old Minutemen were too vulnerable to Soviet surprise attack in their silos.) All the while we have neglected to think about how we would repulse a conventional Soviet attack against our European or Asian allies. 
Even more worrying, we have yet to work out an effective strategy for the use of U.S. forces in limited situations. Remember, Vietnam was not the only place we pulled out of in defeat-it wasn't very long after the truck bombing in Beirut that U.S. forces left that country too. In neither of these cases were American troops defeated on the field of combat. They were defeated by the lack of an effective strategy. Six years ago we had no effective strategy for these situations and today we still do not. 
The economy today is better in some ways than when President Reagan en­tered office, but worse in others. Yes, except for the 1982 Recession, we have enjoyed moderate and slow growth in our economy. A much-needed tax reform was finally, after much presidential pressure and almost heroic persistence, signed into law a few weeks ago. But here too, problems, big problems, have been created or gone unaddressed. 
The first is the national debt. When running for office, President Reagan promised to balance the federal budget. Since then, his administration has run up more debt in six years than all of the previous administrations did in the prior 204. Are "Borrow and Spend" policies any better than "Tax and Spend" ones? 
Our international trade position has 
been seriously weakened in the last six 
years. For the first time since World 
War I, we are a debtor nation. In 1980, 
America was still the world's biggest 
creditor. We are now the world's big­
gest debtor. 
President Reagan must be credited 
with holding the line on protectionism. 
Without his personal political bravery, 
we might well have had a catastrophic 
protectionist trade bill throw us into an­
other depression. Remember, it was a 
protectionist trade bill, and the trade 
war that followed, that threw the U.S. 
and the world into the Great Depression 
in the 1930s. 
Still, the trade issue must be dealt with. The present administration is not giving effective leadership in the struggle to make America competitive again. It seems as if the present admin­istration is willing to let America go from an industrial economy to a "hamburger economy." This is beneath America's dignity. A country backed only by a hamburger economy cannot stand tall in the family of na­tions. With half the population of America, Japan graduates twice as many engineers. But we have more fast-food joints. Who is ahead? This is a situation that can no longer be ig­nored, as it has been these last six years. 

On a Catholic campus, the abortion issue is an important one. President Reagan has frequently stated his oppo­sition to abortion. This is apparently sufficient to garner him many Catholic votes. However, he has done nothing about it. Does it make any difference what a man's personal views are if he does absolutely nothing about them? 
A week ago Tuesday the American people went to the polls. Recognizing that the group that had CO!lle to power in 1981 had· gone far enough, they decided to change the course. The people they elected, a Democratic majority in the House and Senate, will begin to lead the nation down a new course. 
They will begin to discard what is bad in the present administration. But they will build upon the good achieved in Ronald Reagan's presidency, as he prepared for a peaceful, well-earned re­tirement after a long second career devoted to public service. In two years' time, we as American citizens will .select a man (or a woman), to fill the office of the Presidency of the United States when Ronald Reagan is no longer able to. That man (or woman) will then proceed to lead America on a new course. 
President Reagan's Old Guard has served the Republic well, but in Janu­ary of 1989, it will be time for a new generation of leadership to take the helm and lead America to her rendez­vous with destiny.

Dear Editor: 

Our response to Rich Coglianese's Nov. 10 Viewpoint article, "Elections May be Demise of 'Reagan Revolu­tion'," will contain no personal slurs against members of the Supreme Court or Republican Senators. Unlike Coglianese, we feel that slurs of this type have no place in a supposedly thought-provoking article. 
The majority of those people who ex­ercised their right of suffrage in the past election willingly chose to put an end to the so-called "Reagan Revolu­tion." Unsatisfied with what the Republicans did while in control of the Senate, the voters cast their ballots for many Democrat Senate candidates thus giving control of the Senate to the Democrats. 
The vote is in. The count is tallied. The American people have spoken. Nov. 6, 1986, is not a day that will live in infamy, but rather one that will be remembered as the day when the majority of those who cared enough to 
Garry Trudeau 

vote chose to place the Senate in the hands of those capable of producing the desired results. 
We have presented our opinion of Decision '86 devoid of any vicious com­ments about the personal lives of mem­bers of the government of the United States. Coglianese, we wish we could say the same thing about you.

It usually starts in the classroom. Profes­sor such-and-such will say some­thing like, "I'm sure you've all checked the syllabus, and you've noticed that you have an eight­page paper due on Monday.

"Sure!" you answer, "No prob­lem daddy-a. I like typing till my fingers are numb and my brain is whipped cream. I like to write and read and write and read and learn and scream and learn!

We don't have any tests in that class ... pass me another Lite Beer from Miller and no I'm not drinking too much and it wouldn't be any of your business if I was, okay?" I'm learning about possible places to sleep, like the lunch table. They told me to budget my time; well I'm overdrawn, boys and girls. 
I have, however, managed to come up with a few semirealistic tips to counter stress: 
I. First of all, don't relax and breathe slowly for ten minutes. You're likely to fall asleep and then you won't get anything done. A better way to qo is to not breathe at all. After holding your breath for ten minutes you'll turn blue and faint. Saying, "Sor­ry, I was unconscious so I couldn't do my paper" has proven to be an airtight excuse time and time again. 
2. 
Do-crazy things. Hold your roommates hostage. Dress up like the Pope. Eat in the dining hall. Consider celibacy. After a couple weeks ofstunts like these you'll be carted off to the psych department for testing and ob­servation. Remember "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"? Being declared legally insane might seem rash, but you'll end up that way by the end of exam week anyway, so why not get it over with? 

3. 
Drink heavily and in the company of friends who say things like "You can study tomor­row. You're coming to Bridgett's NOW!" 

4. 
Graduate. (see "Do Crazy Things" above) 

5. 
Keep repeating cliches like, "I can't do any better than my best" and "Human beings need to sleep and dream to survive." They are, of course, baldfaced lies, but they really work. 


Finally, always remember that grades are certainly not the end of the world. My grade point average does a great deal to sup­port this, because it stinks and the world is still standing. Stress is something we all have to live with. So pass me another Jolt and give me a 4:30a.m. wake-up call.

In ad-dition to these events there will also be a Lock-Up this Tuesday and Wednesday, an Aerobathon sponsored by the Hall Presidents' Council this Saturday, a 5K run and possibly a Senior Bar Night. However, according to program Vice-Chairman Mike May, most of the money is expected to come from the door-to-door collec­tions being taken by dorm sec­tion leaders. 

The goal for this year's fundraiser was set for $10,000. Last year Notre Dame raised $7,000 for the United Way, but Father Theodore Hesburgh feels that the newgoal is realistic since it means a donation of two dol­lars per student which is "only the cost of two beers at Senior Bar." 
May stressed that United Way is a very effective agency since it contributes to so many charities: American Red Cross of St. Joseph County; Big Brot­herSIBig Sisters of St. Joseph's County; Cancer Society of St.

New Touche Ross chairman brings Notre Dame background to office 
By BUD LUEPKE 
Copy Editor 
The three-hour drive from Detroit to Notre Dame is a familiar one to Daniel J. Kelly. He has made the trip perhaps a hundred times. But to Kelly, who recently was elected chair­man of the board of the ac­counting firm of Touche Ross & Co., the step back to Notre Dame is a small but important one because of the strides he has made since his graduation from the school in 1957. 
Kelly, who graduated magna cum laude as an accounting major in what was then called the College of Commerce, left Notre Dame to become a junior member of the accounting and auditing department of George Bailey & Co., an ancestor of what is now Touche Ross. 
Last week, Kelly returned to Notre Dame to recruit business students for Touche Ross and to take in a football game. "I love this place," says Kelly. "It's like coming home." 
Kelly, a past president of the Notre Dame Club of Detroit, particularly loves Notre Dame accounting students. 
"We try very hard to recruit here," he says. "I'd like to get all of them." Kelly says all the Big Eight accounting firms find Notre Dame students at­tractive because "the students here are some of the most in­telligent in the country and a lot of the students come from business-oriented families." 
Kelly says Notre Dame ac­counting students have always done well at his firm and he primarily recruits those stu­dents. But he adds that his firm is also looking at MBA and Law students with business back­grounds. "We have on one oc­casion hired an English major," says Kelly. "But they have to be interested in being a CPA." 
It is a curious act of fate that in the 29 years since his gradua­tion from Notre Dame, Kelly has simply moved from one side of the hiring table to the other. But that simple move en­tails a path of many steps and much success. 
When Kelly began as a junior accountant, George Bailey & Co. had only a few offices with its main office in Detroit. It was only nine years old and was years behind other firms in the competitive business of wooing clients. 
In 1966 Kelly was made a partner and two years later was put in charge of the ac­counting and auditing depart­ment of the Detroit office. During Kelly's rise in the com­pany, the accounting firm itself was emerging in the business world. In 1960 after two mergers with firms in Canada and England, the firm became Touche, Ross, Bailey & Smart; and in 1969 the final modified version, Touche Ross, was adopted. 
At age 37, Kelly became re­sponsible for the entire man­agement of the operations of the Detroit office and is pres­ently responsible for the direct 
management of the Detroit, Ann Arbor, Lansing and Toledo offices. Last month Kelly was chosen to chair the board of directors of the national oper­ation of Touche Ross, now based in Manhattan. 
Although his increased role at the firm leaves less time to return to his alma mater, Kelly says his career has been "en­joyable and satisfying from a professional standpoint." 
With reason, he speaks en­thusiastically of his job and company. Of his company's eighth rank in a list of largest 
U.S. accounting firms, he says, "On a dollar-volume basis, we feel like we're seventh and not too far from sixth," says Kelly. "But size doesn't really mat­ter. What matters is quality of service and people." 
As evidence of this quality, Kelly says Touche Ross is the fastest growing accounting firm of the Big Eight. Its rev­enues increased 98 percent from 1980 to 1986 and in the past two years the firm has gained more than 50 major clients with base audit fees greater than $100,000. At 92.4 percent, the client retention rate of Touche Ross ties for first within the Big Eight. 
Boeing, Sears, Chrysler, American Motors, Macy's, Pil­lsbury and Prudential Insur­ance are a small sampling of the company's major clients. 
Touche Ross serves its foreign clients through Touche 
Ross International, an organi­zation of 54 member firms in ninety countries. Kelly is also a member of the board of governors for this international arm of Touche Ross. 
Kelly, whose community ser­vice responsibilities comprise a list as large as that of respon­sibilities to his firm, has remained close to Notre Dame. He has sent three daughters to Saint Mary's College and la­ments that work schedule will allow him only three home foot­ball games this year. 
In high school, Kelly knew "it would be a great thing to go to Notre Dame. You always wanted to come to Notre Dame." For Kelly, who has risen to prominence in a growing Big Eight accounting firm, not a whole lot has changed.

Overseas McD's 
find problems 
McDonald's is emphasizing its expansion overseas. Busi­ness Week notes, however, that the restaurant chain has been having problems moving its famous mark of consis­tent quality across oceans. 

Alex VonderHaar 
Business Bits 

Last year, nearly 40 percent of new McDonald's outlets 
opened outside the U.S., giving foreigners 220 more places 
to taste America's most popular food. From Tokyo to 
Thailand, Switzerland to Singapore, Big Mac attacks now 
occur at over 2000 eating houses abroad. 
Ray Kro~ built his empire around a management style 
that marned the advantages of size and the spirit of 
entreprenurialism. This feature has been McDonald's big­
gest challenge in foreign markets. 
McDonald's must find new franchisees who share its 
obsession with standardized procedures. At the same time, 
the company has to continue to make itself seem small to 
promote individualism, a task made increasingly difficult 
by international expansion. 
So the chain has loosened its reigns to encourage testing 
of local market tastes. 

For example, some outlets in Brazil sell a soft drink containing guarana, an Amazonian berry. Diners in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand enjoy milk shakes flavored with durian, regionally considered to be an aphrodisiac. 
Quality control has reached its greatest lengths with the golden French fries. Employees have helped Thai farmers cultivate Idaho potatoes. 
Political problems, in contrast, have not been so easy to adjust to. In volatile areas, McDonald's is a target be­cause it is viewed as an exporter of American lifestyle. 
With Filet-0-Fishes and Quarter Pounders frying in 7000 stores already in this country, McDonald's key to future growth is foreign expansion. To be successful could be even tougher than maturing from one shop in the 1950's to a model multinational in the 1980's. 
 A poor advertising environment is the explanation The Wall Street Journal gives for the latest market failure of Time Inc. The magazine publisher has decided not to release Picture Week after more than a year of market testing. 
In its most extensive effort to decide on launching a new publication, Time spent $15 million experimenting with editorial and design changes as well as giving advertisers free space. These trials, however, represented only thir­teen cities beginning in September 1985. 
Company spokesmen said it would cost over $100 million to successfully market the magazine nationwide, and they added "it would be unwise to invest more than $100 million in the launch of a major weekly in the face of the continuing softness in national advertising and an uncertain economic environment." 
Picture Week was expected to perform well as a fast­paced photo newsweekly with a minimum of text. But during the market test, its stories mimicked those of People, and Time did not need two of its magazines com­peting for the same customers. 
Bruce A. Barnet, in charge of publishing, was disap­pointed: "We know we're putting out a good magazine, but the timing is poor." 
The failure of Picture Week exemplifies the change in the advertising market recently. Media ranging from newspapers to national television networks are predicting flat revenues for years to come. 
 In case you thought that silver and gold were the only precious metals, think about the recent trading in platinum, a material used in jewelry and strategic weap­ons. Growing concern about South Africa, the supplier of 85 percent of the free world's annual production of 2.7 million ounces, has prompted a big price jump. 
The current price of near $600 an ounce is double that of last year. This, in turn, has sparked a great search for· the metal. "At no time has there been this much attention to platinum exploration in Canada," according to John McGoran, president of a Vancouver mining company. 
At least a dozen companies are looking coast to coast in Canada, a nation currently with only one mine (in On­tario). One optimistic expert told The Wall Street Journal that "when everyone starts looking for a metal, the tradi­tion is that it is found in large abundance." This could bring the price back down again, eventually resulting in bankrupt mining concerns. 
Interestingly, South Africa is also the world's largest supplier of gold, but its price has not risen as sharply as that of platinum.

playing from the 18 than the nine." 
Despite the two mishaps, however, Notre Dame got the play it wanted when Beuerlein fired a pass toward tight end Joel Williams, who was open and streaking into the end zone. But in a scene that will linger for a long time in the memories of Irish fans, the ball glanced off Williams' hands as Penn State cornerback Gary Wilker­son made the hit from behind. 
"I thought I was going to get it," said Williams, "but (Wilkerson) timed it pretty well and he broke it up before I could get a firm grip on it." 
Then, in a bizarre conclusion, Beuerlein sat back in the pocket for an eternity on fourth down waiting for someone to get open. Nobody did, however, leaving the senior signal-caller to helplessly toss the ball to tailback Mark Green in the right flat, ten yards from paydirt. 
"I know now I should have thrown the ball in,'' said Beuer­lein. "I really just could not find anybody open in the end zone." 
That Beuerlein was so frustrated on the last posses­sion was ironic considering the relative ease he had shown ear-

Notre Dame basketball 'rehearses,' crushes Yugoslavians by 21 points 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
Notre Dame's 89-68 victory over Sibenik of Yugoslavia was more of a dress rehearsal than a basketball game. 
And as such, it showed that the Irish don't quite have all their lines memorized, but it did give the supporting cast a chance to get used to the stage lights. 
Donald Royal portrayed his role as one of the leading actors by scoring 19 points and pulling down 11 rebounds, as four-of­five starters scored in double figures. Gary Voce, moving from a supporting role to a leading man this season, had 11 points and 12 rebounds, but picked up his third and fourth fouls early in the second half, something that will be critical starting opening night. 
The Irish jumped off to a 16-0 lead with just five-and-a-half minutes gone in the opening half and never looked back. Royal had five points in the early explosion with both field goals coming on offensive rebounds. Then, with 10:33left in the half and Notre Dame up, 
lier in the game in passing through the Nittany Lion defense. 
Down 10-6 at the half, Beuer­lein directed his team to its only lead of the day when he connected with wide out Milt Jackson on a 50-yard bomb that set up a 14-yard Brown touch­down reception. The drive, which went 92 yards in six plays, put the Irish on top, 13­10. 
That drive was followed in the fourth quarter by a 10-play, 64-yard march that put the Irish back in the game after Penn State's John Shaffer had increased his team's margin to 24-13 with a one-yard plunge. Here, Beuerlein strikes to

23-5, Irish head coach Digger Phelps sent in the supporting cast, featuring four freshmen, for his starters. The subs put in a little more than six minutes and when they were replaced, the score stood at 31-12. 
"I thought we jumped out pretty well," said Phelps. "We needed to go against somebody besides ourselves. I was con­cerned about early rebounding in the game. But I thought we did a good job of pressuring the ball, and we boxed out very well early. We did a lot of good rebounding earlier in the game, and we just dominated from the start. 
"I just wanted to play the freshmen to give them a taste and see what they could do. I thought (Scott) Paddock did some good things and I thought Jamere (Jackson) did some good things." 
The second half offered more of the same. Phelps subsituted freely throughout the half, both situationally and en masse. Paddock saw time with the first squad, mainly because of Voce's foul trouble. 
Along with the Voce fouls, the Irish, who crashed the boards 
flanker Ray Dumas and Jack­son moved the Irish into posi­tion where, once again, Brown took the ball in for the score to make it 24-19. 
A two-point conversion at­tempt by the Irish failed when Penn State linebacker Pete Gif­topolous ( 11 tackles) picked off Brown's option pass to Beuer­lein. 
Penn State, meanwhile, was able to have a successful day offensively despite a sub-par game by star running back D.J. Dozier, who picked up only 77 yards on 17 carries. Dozier bunched up 26 of those yards on a drive in the first quarter that put the Lions up 7-0 after consistently, also ran into rebounding problems in the second half. Phelps indicated that someting in the 86-87 Irish script has to be fine tuned. 
"We have to rebound with consistency," said Phelps. "If we can't rebound, then we've just got to press people, and we didn't do that tonight. I just wanted to see how well we could play man-to-man ­forced the kids to play man to man -and we didn't want to press tonight because I wanted to see what we could do with post defense. 
"I thought Voce got a Iitle sloppy in the second half. That's going to be a concern for us -how well we can play good post defense and how well we rebound in key situations. If we learn to adjust those two things, then we'll be able to compete." 
But Friday night's game was more than a basketball exhibi­tion, it was an exhibition of friendship between two countries. Phelps spoke highly of the Sibenik club and the Yugoslavian love of basketball, saying, "it's made their nation more unified." 
fullback Steve Smith went in from the one-yard line. 
Then, Shaffer was able to use the big play to generate some offense in the third period, linking up with split end Ray Roundtree on a 37-yard touch­down bomb that put Penn State back on top at 17-13. 
All of this still may not have been enough for the Lions if it were not for some critical first­half mistakes that enabled them to keep the Irish off the board. Three fumbles by Beuerlein, one deep in Irish ter­ritory just before the half that was converted into a Massimo Manca field goal, particularly hurt Notre Dame.

"I refuse to classify these athletes as losers," said Irish head coach Lou Holtz. "We have had some bad breaks.

SMC swimming opens year, downs N.orth Central, 72-22­
:7 
By JANE SHEA 
Sports Writer 

The Saint Mary's swim team traveled to Chicago on Friday, where it beat North Central by a score of 72-22. 
This was the Belles first meet of the season and, according to Coach Nancy Jo Kuzmitz, it was a good meet because it ex­emplified the team's potential for the season. 
"I am fairly impressed with our times, however, there are areas of needed improve­ment," said Kuzmitz. 
Saint Mary's took first place in all the events except two, where it took second. 
The Belles were successful in the 200-yard free relay, with senior captains Mary Fisher and Patty Juckniess, along with freshmen Julie Courtney and Erin Tierney. Their time was 1:49.83.

"The blocked punt was prob­ably the key play of the game," Gilboy added. "It gave us a 9-0 lead at halftime, which was vir­tually a gift." 
Flanner head coach Jim Fitzgerald agreed, saying that it gave the momentum to Stan­ford. 
"The drive at the end of the half hurt us," Fitzgerald com­mented. "We would have been happy going into halftime scoreless, but it just wasn't meant to be." 
That quick outburst was all Stanford needed, as its defense, affectionately known as the "Dirtbag D," controlled the rest of the game. 
"Our linemen put tremen­dous pressure on the Flanner 
Saint Mary's also swam well in the 200-yard medley with a time of 2:05.80. The team was made up of Juckniess, Tierney, senior Margaret Mannion and sophomore Tanya Reeves. 
Both relay teams made the cut-offs for the nationals. 
Other first-place finishers for the Belles were sophomore Peggy Halloran, who swam in the 500-yard free with a time of 6:00.34, Tierney, who swam in both the 50-and 100-yard free with a time of 0:26.36 and 0:59.72, respectively, and Courtney, who swam in the 200­yard free with a time of 2: 15.82. 
Juckniess in the 100-yard back, Mannion in the 100-yard breast and Reeves in the 200­yard IM were also winners. 
The two second places were captured by Halloran in the 1,000-yard free with a time of 12:29.26, and Reeves in the 100­yard fly with a time of 1:08.0. 
quarterback, especially in the second half," Gilboy contin­ued. "They really made it tough to throw, which allowed our linebackers and defensive backs to cover their receivers well." 
The Stanford offense really began to role on its first pos­session of the second half, as the Martin-to-Landry combina­tion clicked several times, and running backs Bill Marvel and Jack Gleeson chipped in to drive the ball to the Flanner four-yard line. The drive stalled there, and Stanford settled for a 21-yard field goal from Sanchez, making the score 12-0. 
The "Dirtbag D" then took control. Flanner tried to get its offense untracked by going on fourth-and-four from its own 40, but Stanford rose to the oc­casion. The Stanford defense rose to the occasion all game long, giving up only one first down. 
"Our defense played really well all year long,'' said Gilboy. "We gave up only six points in seven games. When you can do that, you are going to win a lot of ballgames." 
The "Dirtbag D" set up the game's final score, as Tony Vil­lanueva recovered a fumble at the Flanner 32. 
After Gleeson moved the ball up to the 19, Tomko ran a nifty reverse 16 yards for the touch­down. ·

ND volleyball takes NSC tournament, extends streak to 15 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
Apparently somebody forgot to teach the Notre Dame vol­leyball team about fatigue. Be­cause of this "omission" the Irish continue to roll through their best season ever, with hopes to nab a bid to the NCAA tournament. 
This weekend the Irish traveled to Chicago and easily swept their four opponents to win the North Star Invitational. No more than six hours after winning the championship game on Saturday afternoon, the Irish were back on the court of the ACC to battle the Univer­sity of Rhode Island. Notre Dame rolled over Rhode Is­land, 15-0, 15-3, 13-15, 15-6, to take its fifth victory in 28 hours. 
With the victory, the Irish notched their 15th consecutive win and brought their season record to 31-6, both school records. 
The weekend, possibly the best in Notre Dame volleyball history, began Friday night as Notre Dame defeated Val­paraiso and Dayton. 
The Irish handled Valparaiso for the second time this season, sweeping it, 15-9, 15-2 and 15-2. Sophomores Mary Kay Waller and Zanette Bennett led the Notre Dame offensive attack with 11 and 10 kills, respective­ly, while Waller recorded three solo blocks and four block as­sists to pace the Irish defense. Freshman setter Taryn Collins continued to be a sparkplug, registering 32 assists, six digs and three kills. 
In the Dayton match, juniors Gretchen Kraus and Kathy Baker celebrated their birthdays with a bang as the Irish defeated the Flyers 15-5, 15-11 and 15-11. Baker recorded 13 kills in only two games while Kraus had 10 kills and four blocks. Sophomore Whitney Shewman turned in one of her best all-around performances of the season with nine kills, 10 digs and three service aces. 
On Saturday the Irish first faced Cleveland State and con­tinued their winning ways, 15-3, 15-3 and 15-2. Shewman paced 

Pats pull off miracle finish 
Associated Press 
Irving Fryar's 25-yard touch­down catch as time expired gave the New England Patriots a dramatic 30-28 victory Sun­day over Los Angeles and spoiled a rather incredible debut of Rams' rookie quarter­back Jim Everett. 
Fryar, who had caught a six­yard touchdown pass to pull the Patriots to within 28-23 with 
7:06 to play, came down with the winning score in a crowd of players in the Rams end zone. The play started with three seconds left. 
Patriots' receiver, Stanley Morgan, went high with a group of Ram defenders and tipped the ball, but Fryar hauled it in to give the Patriots the victory. 
"It's called a 'Miracle Right,' " a beaming Patriot Coach Raymond Berry said of the catch. 
"I was just trying to stay in the end zone," said Fryar, who'd lost two fumbles earlier in the game. "Stanley tipped it but I didn't see that. I just got there and it was in my hands." 
The victory gave the Patriots an 8-3 record and kept their first-place hopes alive in the AFC east. The Rams are 7-4 and a half game behind San Francisco in the NFC west.

Notre Dame with nine kills and three aces, while sophomore Maureen Shea led the defense with nine digs and three blocks. It was a true team effort as everyone, except injured 

Art Lambert 
senior Karen Sapp, saw playing time, and 10 players re­corded kills. 
The Irish wrapped up the tournament in convincing fas­hion, destroying DePaul, 15-1, 15-0 and 15-5. It was the fourth Notre Dame sweep of the weekend, and its 19th of the season. 

Bennett was named the tournament MVP and Irish Coach Art Lambert was honored as the North Star Con­ference Coach of the Year. Col­lins, who recorded 126 assists for the five tournament matches, was named to the all­tournament first team, and Waller, Shea and Baker were second-team selections. Baker recorded 20 kills while playing in only five games, her best performance of the season. 
The Irish returned to the ACC Saturday night to finish out the weekend against the Univer­sity of Rhode Island. Showing no signs of fatigue after a busy two days of volleyball, the Irish won their fifth match of the weekend, defeating the Rams 15-0, 15-3, 13-15, 15-6. 
Notre Dame came out on fire in game one, running the score to 12-0 behind kills by Waller and Bennett. After the teams traded side-outs, Collins set up Shea twice for kills and junior Kathleen Morin put the match away with a kill for the 15-0 Irish victory. 
Notre Dame was still hot in game two, as it took a quick 5-0 lead before Rhode Island got its first points of the night. Col­lins and Cunningham, the Irish freshmen, made several out­standing saves and digs as Notre Dame won handily, 15-3. 
"Those first two games were the best we've played, ever," said Lambert, who was obvi­ously a very happy and relaxed man after seeing his team easily defeat every opponent over the weekend. 
"We have not been able to sustain a great level of play like that. That was the first time we've done that for two games." 
Rhode Island battled back in the third game to win a tight battle, 15-13. Game four was another blow-out as the Irish roared back behind the kills of Bennett and Waller to win it, 15-6. 
"We rested everybody well today," said Lambert, explain­ing why his team did not falter against Rhode Island after the four North Star Invitational matches.

Inside Monday 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
So close, but so far away. 
That phrase summarizes more than just Notre Dame's 24-19 loss to Penn State Satur­day. It's more like this season's theme. 
Saturday, the Irish came six yards and five points short of victory, an all-too-familiar tale. While it may be unfair to single out one play in any game, the Irish have been vic­timized all year by the lack of a clutch play. 
In the opening game against Michigan, a field goal goes inches wide, and Notre Dame loses, 24-23. The following week at Michigan State, the Irish trail, 20-15, but are driving with

Satuday's loss to Penn State followed the same script. The Irish took over at their own 20 with 2:29 left to play. Quarter­back Steve Beuerlein, showing coolness under pressure, com­pleted five straight passes despite a heavy Lion rush. Sud­denly, Notre Dame was at the Penn State six with just over a minute to play. Notre Dame fans pleaded with their squad to pull out the last-second vic­tory which had eluded them all year, but it was not meant to be. 
Just two plays later, a first­and-goal at the six had become third-and-goal at the 18. Beuer­lien dropped back again, fired to Joel Williams at the goal line, only to see the ball go off Wil­liams' fingertips as he was hit by Penn State safety Gary Wilkerson. 
The Irish still had one play left, but with all his receivers covered in the end zone and the Lion rush closing in, Beuerlein dumped off to Mark Green, who slipped and fell at the 13. An­other Irish comeback had fal­len short. 
"Real close is the story of my four years here," said Beuer­
