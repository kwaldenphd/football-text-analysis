News Brief§ 
By The Ohsener and The Associated Press 
A Notre Dame stud«:!nt and a local woman were robbed at gunpoint early last Sunday morning. Greg Gross, a senior, said that he and the woman were walking along the 800 block of Corby Street around 12:45 a.m. when two black males, one holding a gun, told the two to give them their money. Gross said that the men ran away with the woman's purse when a group of people ap­proached the four. He said that the woman, who wished to remain nameless, had "around four or five dollars" in her purse. Gross reported the incident to the South Bend police. -The Observer 
Brother William Mewes. a Holy Cross brother 
from Notre Dame, has been appointed state coordinator for the In­
diana Nuclear Weapons Freeze campaign. He previously coor· 
dinated the campaign in Indiana's Third Congressional District. 
Mewes described the campaign as a "grassroots movement" which 
seeks to halt the production and deployment of nuclear weapons 
and delivery systems in both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. He expects to 
collect several thousand signatures in a statewide petition drive 
which ended yesterday. Mewes, citing opinion polls which showed 
78/ support for a nuclear weapons freeze resolution, said his main 
goal is to convince Indiana legislators that their constituents favor 
the freeze. Both Sen. Richard Lugar and Rep. John Hiler oppose a 
weapons freeze, while their November opponents, Democrats Floyd 
Fithian andJack Bodine favor it. Copies ofthe petition will be given 
to all four men, as well as President IR.eagan. Mewes said the group 
plans to reintroduce a freeze resolution in the Indiana state 
legislature. A similar measure was defeated earlier this year. Mewes 
described the resolution as non-binding, and requiring the com· 
pliance ofthe Soviets. -The Observer 
The Swedish navycontinued its search for a foreign 
submarine in Hors Bay yesterday for the llth day, but the nation's 
top military man said the likelihood was increasing that it had 
escaped into the Baltic Sea Navy spokesman Capt. Sven Carlsson 
said there had been no "firm indication" ofthe sub's presence in the 
waters offthe Musko Naval Base since Friday. "It could still be there, 
but the likelihood is gradually decreasing," said Gen. Lennart Ljung, 
the armed forces commander-in-chief There was also no further 
word of a second sub the navy said it detected outside the entrance 
to the bay last Thursday. Ljung said Sunday it might have been the 
first sub after it made its escape. -AP 
More than $1 million a minute is being 
spent worldwide on the military,.;with nuclear stockpiles exceeding 50,000 weapons, according to a study by a coalition ofarms control groups. The study, "World Military and Social Expenditures, 1982," charges that nuclear and conventional arms races have wasted resources without enhancing international security. International nuclear stockpiles have mushroomed to represent the equivalent of 
3.5 tons of TNT for every person on earth -a total representing more than 1 million times the explosive power of the Hiroshima bomb, the study said. "Under its heavy military burden, the global economy has suffered," writes the author of the study, Ruth Leger Sivard. "The diversion of resources from civilian needs is a silent killer, curbing productivity and development, and adding more mil­lions to the hundreds of millions of people who lack the most basic necessities of life." Sivard is director of a non-profit research or­ganization named World Priorites. She was formerly chief of the economics division of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. -AP 
Police yesterday detained one of two men 
accused of taking 11 people hostage and collecting a 5400,000 ran­som after stealing 550,000 from a blown-open safe in a bank in Koblenz, West Germany. Officials said the bank robber was seized in the industrial city of Bochum. The Cologne-based radio station Deutschlandjunk quoted Koblenz police headquarters as saying 5280,000 was found on the suspect. The two men vanished Wednes­day after a 19-hour drama that began when the two men robbed the bank in Koblenz, police said. The gunmen seized the hostages, col­lected the ransom, and released thei1r captives later after a wild car chase and a shootout with police, who then lost track of them, offi­cials said. -AP 
A task force investigating the deaths of seven 

people who took cyanide-laden Extra-Strength Tylenol reported no progress in its inquiry yesterday and declined to say whether it had any new leads. Chicago police are working with the force of more than 100 investigators from federal, state and local agencies, but are also conducting their own probe into the death of the seventh vic­tim. They said there wa~ "nothing new" in their effort. "Things are quiet," Sgt. Michael Invergo said. Meanwhile, a Chicago man who became the first person arrested in connection with the investiga­tion remained in the Metropolitan Correctional Center yesterday on a federal extortion charge. U.S. Magistrate Olga Jurco set bond at 
S100,000 for Jerome Howard, 20, who allegedly tried to extort S8,000 from a hospital with threats to "put cyanide in every bottle of Extra-Strength Tylenol to see what it will do." Howard has been dismissed as a suspect in the seven deaths which occurred between Sept. 29 and Oct. 1, officials said. -AP

A few modest proposals 
Do you ever get frustrated? No, not that kind of frustration, but the kind you get from the annoyances of day-to-day life. During my years here at Notre Dame I've seen more then my fair share offrustration. There are a number of deficiencies on this campus that, if cor­rected, would make life more pleasant for us all. 
Take the Engineering Auditorium. A more uncom­fortable facility is hard to imagine. What kind ofa place is that to watch a movie? The slant ofthe floor is so slight that ifsome tall oafsits in front ofyou, you're out ofluck. Just sitting in that place is bad enough. The seats are medieval horrors that, during the course of a two hour movie, slowly reduce your backside to mush. Now that they have chosen to overcrowd the place, the tem­porary desks littering the aisles threaten one's physical safety. How much would it cost to install some modern padded seats? The ones in the Annenberg Auditorium would do just fine. And while they are at it, they could fix the bulbs in the projectors so that the films don't go from yellow tint to blue tint with each successive reel. 
Another improvement sorely needed is a bus shelter at the Library. While I don't use the shuttle myself, each winter the sight ofgaggles ofshivering Saint Mary's stu­dents breaks my heart. After a steamy study session in the library, its downright un­healthy to stand in the blowing cold. The shelter by the Grotto has been a success. The time has come to repeat it. 
Perhaps the Physical Plant Department could purchase some satellite photos of this campus. Then they could come up with a master plan for the many paths and sidewalks which skewer the campus. As it stands now, many of the routes take one on a journey to nowhere. 
Now, of course, there are a few contributing problems. For a group of people sup­posedly in the prime of health, students are a lazy bunch. The only people who never trample the grass seem to be the elderly members of our community ­the people who could understandable take the shot­
cuts. 
The busy, booming Notre Dame campus is always changing in layout. So predicting the next meandering of the masses is a dubious art at best (like weather forecasting). However, it would be far better if the Physical Plant Department gave the lazies convenient pathways, as opposed to combatting them with silver posts and strategic pine trees. Think of all the money that could be saved on the acres of turf rolled out for graduation. 
I don't really understand the registration process either. It consists mostly of picking up some computer cards from one nice lady and giving them to another. What does this accomplish? No matter what you do, you still end up prowling crowded hallways on campus, and mark sensing until your fingers fall off. Even better is the confirmation process. For two semesters now my finalized schedule has been sent to me days after the

Have you ever been drenched by a sprinkler late at night? I have. These merciless things revolve in search of the unsuspecting. Why do they squirt at night, and why are they always on after it rains? (Ofcourse, muddy lawns do discourage the shortcutters.) 
The bookstore has security gates through which patrons pass, and security guards to examine the patrons as they pass, so why can't you buy your books and your sundries at the same time? It is senseless to have to line up twice, when once would suffice. And why do they have all those birthday cards for people 
who are old? Most of the trade is for roommates and friends.

been on for several weeks. One ofthe best days was last week when the temperature outside was around eighty degrees. On the other hand, the heat in the dorms is spot­ty at best. I can remember shivering in November, and baking in April. Such treat­ment should be reserved for TV dinners. A nice moderate 
dosage  of  this  heat year- 
round  would  make  life  
much more pleasent.  

The aforementioned sidewalks are lovely and pa~­toral avenues during the spring, summer, and fall. But come winter, they become trecherous pathways of peril. The snowplows tear about in a crazed manner. Nothing stops them, not students, not buildings, not even the ubiquitous silver posts. When the thaw hits in spring, mounds of razed turf, battered bicycles, and other carnage litter the campus. Do they have to drive as if the campus were the Baha 500? 
Well, these are just a few modest suggestions. The cost of implementing any of them would be small, yet would improve all of our lives. Besides, if nothing is done to change these problems, Notre Dame may find itself the victim of one Andy Rooney's crotchety ram-. blings.

Senate told 
Rectors oppose partyreforn1s 
ByDANKOPP 
StaffReporter 
The majority of rectors surveyed opposed the Student Senate's sec­tion party proposal, said Student Body Vice-President Bob Yonchak at last night's Student Senate meeting. 
Yonchak is the co-author of the proposal to allow well regulated sec­tion parties in the dorms. "Most of the rectors I've talked to hate it so far. They doubt the control aspect. They feel the majority of students are responsible but there are a few who would wreck the parties," Yonchak said. 
"There is also a big problem with the drinkin~ a~l· in lnd.ana. Thr l ni­versity is already sticking its neck out in allowing unuerage llrinkmg in party rooms," Yonchak added. 
"It just doesn't look like we have 
the rectors' backing," Yonchak said. 
Senior Class President Mark Mai 
commented, "They're worried 
about alcohol abuse and. then they 
don't go for something like this,

Emphasizing that the United States and other countries "had to change from looking at war as a solu­tion to conflict," Rose and Dan Lucey, founders of the movement for a National Peace Academy, spoke in Hayes-Healy Auditorium last night on the need for the establish­ment ofa National Peace Academy.

Reagan accuses Demosagain 
DALLAS, Tx. (AP) -President Reagan, campaigning for Texas Republicans, aimed another shot at Democrats yesterday before return­ing to the White House to work on what aides insist will be a "non­partisan" speech on the economy. 
In a speech prepared for delivery to a Republican rally, the president called Democratic critics of his economic plan "Monday morning quarterbacks" with no alternative to offer. 
"We have pulled America back from the edge of disaster," he said, contending that the economic dilemma was caust:d by those "who are now our biggest critics." 
The rhetoric y::sterday followed the pattern White House aides have said will characterize presidential speeches in the final three weeks of the midterm election campaign ­blame the Democrat~ for economic hard times and accentuate any positive economic developmenrs. 
"Our program is beginning to work," said Reagan, citing declining interest rates and soaring stock prices. The president said he shares the "ache and frustration" of the growing numbers of people who can'tfind work, but added that there is no quick, easy cure. 
Republican political strategists fear the nation's I 0.1 percent un­employment rate -the highest in 42 years-will be uppermost in the minds of voters when they go to the polls Nov. 2. If that assessment is correct, Republicans could lose the congressional gains of their I980 election triumph.

only war monuments and "no in­dication of symbols of peace in the United States", the Luceys stated that this Peace Academy would be an independent, multi-disciplinary organization at the graduate and post-graduate level. It would feed in­to all sectors of society, public and private, Rose Lucey said. 
Referring to the tact tnat I':J otner colleges had a department of peace studies, the Lucey's asked why Notre Dame did not have one. 
The Luceys' idea of a National Peace Academy is not new. Since 1793 there have been 140 bills presented in Congress for the es­tablishment ofa peace academy, but these bills "never came out of com­mittee," Dan Lucey said. 
In early 1982 the Senate held hearings on the bill, which was sup­ported by a diversified group of people from presidents ofmajor uni­versities to bishops and political leaders. As a result, the Senate voted in favor of bringing this bill to the 

commercial enterprises on campus. 
"The University owns all the land 
around the campus to keep out busi­
ness establishments -we are sur­
rounded by a moat." 
"The nearest commercial establishment is King's Cellar," Burke said. 
It was also announced at the meeting that tickets for the Novem­ber 8 "Chicago" concert are now on sale at the Student Union Record Store and at the A.C.C. In addition, Freshmen Registers may be picked up Tuesday and Wednesday from 6

floor in April 1982. 
"But because of all the debates going on in the Senate on the budget and the filibustering on school prayer, our bill has not gotten to the floor," he said. 
Currently, the "bill is being bottled up by Senator Howard Baker, the majority leader, who makes up the Senate calandar," Dan Lucey said. 
"Although we don't believe that 
Baker is  against  the  bill,  he does  
determine  which  bills  will  be  
dicussed," he said.  

Although there is no hope of the bill being passed in this congres­sional session, "we now hope to at­tach the bill as a 'rider' onto another bill in the special session that begins Nov. 29," Dan Lucey said. 
Advocating that "peace has to be a vital part of our lives," Rose Lucey suggested that the students look at their own major and ask themselves what they are learning and how it will affect the peace ofthe world.

Residents panic 

Lebanesesearchrefugeecarnps 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -The Lebanese army surrounded the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Chatilla yesterday, conducting house-by-house searches for guns and demolishing shacks built with­out building permits. 
Panicked camp residents reported that men in civilian clothes had entered the camps overnight, leading away several people. Lebanese paramilitary security forces attempting to calm the resi­dents said the men were plainclothes policemen, and that no further camp searches would be allowed by people out of uniform. There was no explanation for the 
searches  being  conducted  after  
nightfall.  
As  the  army searched  the  cy.ro  

camps where hundreds of Pales­tinian refugees were massacred last month, Western diplomats reported that a new contingent of 400 Italian 
troops will be sent to Lebanon tomorrow to join the existing multi­national peacekeeping force. The new contingent would bolster the American, French and Italian peacekeeping force to 4,200 men. The Lebanese government re­quested the force after the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in Sabra and Chatilla Sept. 16-18. Lebanese security sources reported Sunday that Christian 'militamen were filtering into Mos­lem neighborhoods and have kid­napped dozens of leftists in the past week. Lebanese Moslem leaders claim 150 people have been kid­napped by the militiamen in recent days. The paramilitary security forces in Beirut issued a statement late yes­terday saying the abductors were plainclothes policemen arresting wauted criminals. The military prosecutor in charge ofi t nvestigating the massacre in the two camps said yesterday that a total of 328 bodies had been recovered and 991 people are still missing. 
Prosecutor Assad Germanos said some of the missing are presumed dead and buried in underground bunkers where they sought refuge to escape the killers and others may have been abducted by the assassins. 
The Lebanese army, which took up positions in west Beirut after Is­raeli troops pulled out Sept. 28, has been sweeping the area for arms left behind by Palestine Liberation Or­ganization guerrillas and Lebanese leftists, It also has been rounding up suspected criminals and illegal aliens, including Palestinians with-

"I don't think you really under­stand the problems people are involved in unless you are in touch with them," Weissert said. "A book may give you the theory, but you need to be in touch to really under­stand." Kevin Hayes, a senior, said "I ex­pected to learn about life in an urban setting, and find out the differences between that and my own suburban life. Their worries are different. While we worry about whether there is gas in the car, or whether to cut the grass instead of playing golf, they worry about how they will get food on the table, and where it will come from." "I wanted to get my feet wet in the world of social justice," said senior Dan Keusal. "I wanted to see the dif­ferent ways people were alleviating

Leslie LeMay, a veteran of two

the idea that people are not fighting 
against their situation. I think they 
are fighting more than we who are 
so concerned about social justice." 
"It made me realize," said Hayes, 
"that these people's problems are

SAPBdiscusst~s frosh elections 
The Observer Atweekly meeting 
By MARY ANN POTTER 
News Staff 
The Saint Mary's Board of Gover­nance discussed Freshman Council elections and Student Activities Programming Board events at a meeting Sunday night. 
Electaons Commissioner !\tonica Gugle reported that campaigning tor 21 Freshman Council candidates hegan Sunday night and will end tomorrow. Elections will take place on Thursday in each ofthe residence halls. 
The Student Activities Program­ming Board will hold its tlrst Cot: feehouse of the year tomorrow at the Saint Mary's clubhouse, with the Jim Coors Band scheduled to hegin playing at 9:00 p.m. The SAPB also is sponsoring the movie Arthur tomor­row at 7 and 10 p.m. in Carroll Hall. 
Student Body President Kathleen Murphy is enthusiastic about the 1982-1983 school year. "The Board is working very hard. l think the stu­dents have an overall good feeling ahout the school." !\lurphy said that she has been receiving mostly positive reactions from students. 
"This is not denying that there are areas that could he improved, but we are working within our means to achieve that improvement," she ex­plained. 

Murphy would like to see more participation in student activies. "We like to offer these activities and have the students take part in them." 
!\lurphy explained that the main concern of the board is to do the hest job possihle to insure that stu­dents are well represented. In order to achieve this the Board hopes to keep communication lines open within the board and hetween the hoard and students. 
In Third World 
Prof stresses ethical development 
Goulet feels that growth schemes have ignored traditional cultural aspects of Third World countries while increasing the dependence of those nations on the West. 
Speaking of the "Matthew Arnold Syndrome," Goulet qumed the Vic­torian poet, saying that less developed countries ( LDC's) are "wandering between two worlds. one dead, the other powerless to be born." Goulet says that while LDC's have emerged from their traditional past, they have not yet found an effective path for the future. The reason for this, accord­ing to Goulet, is that the leadership of many LDC's feels torn between the desire for membership in the global economic community and 
the wish to maintain individual na­
tional character. 
Goulet pointed out that there are

A Notre Dame economics profes­sor, in a critique of development policies in the Third World, said the means as well as the ends of those policies must be evaluated to insure that they are ethically sound. 
Professor Denis Goulet, in a lecture entitled "Obstacles to World Development: An Ethical Reflec­tion," outlined tlaws in contem­porary strategy. 
Citing "a fundamental distortion between goods and the good life," Goulet, an expert in international economics, said that current development programs have too of­ten stressed the importance of 
modern consumer goods, while ignoring their harmful effects on un­derdeveloped societies. 
conflicting opinions within the Third World, with some leaders call­ing for a basic restructuring of the world economic system while others advocate the alleviation of immediate needs. The central role of heavy industry in the development of LDC's is also being re-evaluated. 
While Goulet thinks that the failure of Western industry-based developent schemes has con­tributed to the Third World dilem­ma, he also emhasizes the domestic shortcomings of LDC's. These in­clude corruption. widespread apathy, excessive traditionalism, and a shortage of effective leader­ship.

Research Update 
Two Swedes and an Englishman shared the 
Nobel Prize for Medicine on Monday for their research into a group of body chemicals that affect human ills ranging from arthritis and high blood pressure to asthma and painful menstruation. The prize was awarded to Sune Bergstrom and Bengt I. Samuelsson of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm andJohn R. Vane of the Wellcome Research Foundation in Beckenham, England, who all happened to be in Boston at the time. Their research has delved into the workings and chemistry ofa perplexing group ofsubstances called prostaglan­dins, which are similar to hormones. Scientists believe they may be able to treat a variety of stubborn disorders by manipulating these substances, found throughout the human body and the animal 
world. All three men are in Boston this week to speak at scientific meetings held as part of the bicentennial celebration at Harvard Medical School. They sipped champagne together in a medical school lecture hall, and Bergstrom promised they would hold "a joint symposium" to figJre out how to spend the $157,000 prize money. "It's certainly most gratifying that your colleagues value the work that you have been fighting with for the past 35 years," said Bergstrom, 66, who is sometimes called the father of prostaglandin chemistry. The three had shared the 1977 Albert Lasker Basic Medi­cal Award, given by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundaton in New York, for their research. -AP · 
The technology is available to station a series 
of giant mirrors in orbit to reflect sunlight and illuminate U.S. population centers at night, a space agency study reports. Even if such a massive project received approval, the cost and complexity would delay its implementation until the next century, officials said . The study said the idea is economically feasible, but gave no price­tag. The report said sections of the mirrors could be ferried up in a series of space shuttle flights and .assembled in orbit by astronaut construction crews. The research was conducted by John E.

Economic Update 
An icy Stretch Of Water above Alaska named Diapir Field may hold the biggest reserves ofoil and gas found in the United States in 14 years. The oil industry is gearing up for the 18 million­acre lease sale this week, which could bring in a record S 3 billion in bids. Many oil company officials believe the lease sale yesterday in Anchorage, Alaska, may be the most lucrative of the 41 sales to be offered in Interior Secretary james Watt's leasing program. Watt, who has been attacked for the program offering virtually the entire 
U.S. coastline for drilling over the next five years, is hoping the ping the successofthe sale will silence critics. "What we need is a big one -something that will show that the oil industry wants this land," Watt has said. The Diapir Field, named for the type of geological formation, lies at the top of Alaska just offshore from the Prudhoe Bay field, the 1968 discovery that supplies the country with 18 per­
cent of its domestic oil production. Diapir's proximity to the Prudhoe field and the Alaska oil pipeline is the reason the oil in­dustry is excited. The Interior Department puts the chance of find­ing commerical quantities ofoil and gas at 99.3 percent. It estimates that Diapir holds 2.4 billion barrels ofoil and 1.8 trillion cubic feet of gas. -AP

With its digital time display, calen­dar, alarm and stopwatch, it looks at first glance like many other modern wrist waches. But it has features rivaling even those of Dick Tracy's famous watch: a tiny, all-channel, black-and-white VHF and UHF television set and an FM radio. 
Ti1e new TV-radio-wrist watch, which weighs less than two ounces, is the latest brainchild of Seiko, the world's largest manufacturer of timepieces. 
To make the watch as thin as pos­sible, Seiko developed a radically new liquid-crystal television screen in place ofthe conventional cathode ray tube. 
The antenna is incorporated into the headphones that are needed to hear programs, and power is provided by two AA batteries in a separate power pack that can be carried in a shirt pocket. 
Because the liquid-crystal screen draws much less power than an ordi­nary television picture tube, the tiny 
batteries  provide  five  hours  of  
viewing time.  
The  TV  watch  will  soon  be  

available in Japan for about S400, but will probably not be sold in the United States until 1983, and then only when the FM component has been redesigned to deal with the large number of U.S. stations. 

Unemploymentproblems 
Mistnanagetnent hurtsUJorkers 
By MILTON MOSKOWITZ 
Special to The Observer 
Many of the biggest companies in America are no longer the sources of employment they once were. 
Pan American World Airways had more than 40, ')00 persons on its payroll at the start of the 1970's. It's now down. to 30,000 -and it plans to lop oil' another 5,000 by the end ofthe year. 
International Harvester used to have more than I00,000 employees around the world. It's now below 65,000. 
U.S. Steel has 140,000 employees, down sharply from the 200,000 for­merly on the rolls. 
Litton lndust '-:s, one of the ear­
liest conglomerates, has cut back 
from 118,000 to 76,000 employees. 
Firestone Tire once had jobs for 
105,000 persons. Today, it employs 
73,000. 
Labor unions negotiating on be­half of their members are painfully aware of these job reductions. They realize that companies are coming to the bargaining table with the threat to shut down plants if employees ask for more money. But it's clear. in the cases cited above and in many others, that reason the companies are doin~ so poorly is not because th~·,· han· ton many 
employees or because they have lazy employees who won't work. They're suffering because of dumb management. 
It wasn't Pan Am employees who decided to buy National Airlines. It wasn't Litton employees who bid badly on shiphuilding contracts and went on mindless searches for com­panit:sio acquire. It wasn't Firestone factory workers in Akron who decided to stick with bias-belted tires in the face of evidence indicat­ing the superior performance of radials. 
In the end, though, workers bear the brunt of these management failures. They lose their jobs. Ten years ago, in a statement that ap­peared in tht· -\.kron Beacon-Journal, Peter C. Bommarito, then president of the United Rubber Workers, termed the stubborness of the U.S. tire makers in resisting radials "the greatest financialfaux pas in the his­tory of the rubber industry." Bom­marito was right. Michelin, a French company, came along and beat Firestone to a pulp. Bommarito said in 1972: "Please, gentlemen, the workers in your plants should not be blamed for your errors in judg­
ment." 
They weren't blamed. They just 
IoM their joh:.. ;'l;o passengercar tires 
are bem~-t made anvmore in Akron. 
For years, while these dumb mistakes were being made in the ex­ecutive suites, companies were ur­ging their employees to work harder to improve productivity and propagandizing them with argu­ments for free enterprise. One ofthe best comments l have ever seen on 
these employee communications program was made a couple of weeks ago by Larry Ragan, publisher of the Ragan Report, a newsletter that goes to many companies. 
Ragan said: "I have never run into an employee who has been excited with the question: 'What is a fair rate ofprofit my company should be ear­ning?' Nor have I ever encountered an employee who, learning that the company's profit is 6. 5 percent, has said, 'Wow, think of that; and all this time I thought it was 2 5 percent .. .' 
"To ask workers to produce bet­ter or more is to imply blame ­blame upon them for not working harder; and no matter how clever the message, no matter how bright the headlines, no matter how coor­dinated the audio visuals and the films and the cute poscers posted in the plant, the program won't wash because it shifts responsibility from management to workers -and that's not where it belongs."

Reagan increases aid to reactionaries in Central America 
While the nation's attention has been focused on such trouble spots as Lebanon and Poland, the Reagan Administration has dramatically escalated its short-sighted and dangerous policies in Central Amerij::a. Having defined the regions a vital to our na­tion's geo-political interests, the administra-
T.J. Conley 
Eye on the Amer:cans 

tion continue~ to funnel huge sums of military aid to repressive regimes, not only ensuring increased violence and repression but also further destabilizing an already critical situa­tion. 
In Guatemala, for example, the Reagan Ad­ministration proposes to resume military aid cut off under President Carter due to the regime's atrocious record on human rights. Not only has there been no improvement in the situation, but both The New York Times and Amnesty International have recently reported that the government of President Rios Montt is pursuing a "scorched-earth" 
policy reminiscent of Vietnam, systematically destroying Indian villages and massacring their inhabitants in order to isolate the guer­rillas from their bases of support. This has resulted in over 500,.000 people left homeless and countless others, including many women and children, brutally murdered. It is to this government that the Reagan Administration proposes to resume military aid, and to which it hJS sold Jeeps, trucks and helicopter parts, 
circumventing congressional scrutiny by reclassifying them as "non-military" equip­ment. 
In El Salvador, the administration continues to provide massive amounts ofaid despite the fact that the newly elected government of Al­varo Magana has shown no evidence of being able to control the "security forces" as they systematically murder civilians in an atrempt to weaken support for the guerrillas. Since 
1980, roughly S600 million in direct U.S. aid has been sent to El Salvador, while another S350 million is scheduled for next year. 
But perhaps the most disturbing and in many ways most significant development has been the Reagan Administration's attempt to establish Honduras as a substitute for direct United States involvement in Central America. 
U.S. military assistance received by Hon­duras has increased from S5. 5 million in 1981 to S32.3 million this year with another S36.3 million scheduled for next year. This does not include the over S50 million delivered in economic aid last year, nor the 521 million spend by the U.S. to upgrade and enlarge air­field facilities. 
It would appear that President Reagan wishes to ignore the fact that last November the Honduran people elected the first civilian government to rule that country in a decade, for he has consistently sought to strengthen the most reactionary forces within the Army in an effort to "regionalize" the war in El Sal­vador and destablize the leftist government in neighboring Nicaragua. 
There has been frequent coordination be­tween Salvadoran and Honduran troops along their common border during offensives against Salvadoran guerrillas, as well as well­documented claims that Honduran forces have actively participated in massacres of civilians along the Rio Sumpa which divides the two countries. Some Honduran officers support the anti-Sandinista camps whose members ar .e responsible for over 200 civilian deaths in the last several months within Nicaraguan territory. Many observers expect these same rightist guerrillas to invade Nicaragua on a large scale in coming months. The Honduran army has turned a blind eye to these camps. Thus the Reagan Administra­tion seeks to further its perceived interests in the region by turning the democratically elected government ofHonduras into a facade for a new military dictataorship which will then support its efforts at escalating the con­flicts within the region. Yet, they seem to have ignored the inherently destabilizing effect of pouring massive amounts of money into the military of the poorest country in Central America. While certainly far from tranquil, Honduras has traditionally been relatively stable compared to its embattled neighbors. But now, in the name of combatting com­munist intervention, the Reagan Administra­tion is in fact creating a situation which can only further destabilize the region and add more fuel to the conflagration. Apparently, 
the president has not learned the dangers of trying to pacify a region through a repressive, right-wing government. 

New Senior Bar is only cosmetic solution 
Like the proverbial dead horse, the social life at N.D. is the recipient of many a flogging here on the pages ofThe Observer. Not being one to make waves, I dutifully accept my turn at the whip. The target of my lashes is specifi­cally the administration's attitudes toward the problems here. 
Robert Wack 
Both Sides 

The fact there are problems here is as go0J as established. How to go about solving them is a completely different matter. The students usually favor whatever is most expedient. The less mess and fuss, the more fun for everybody. The administration. on the other hand, tends toward the cosmc[lc solutiOn. 
whatever looks best to the Alumni. The new Senior Bar is a perfect example ofboth desires being fulfilled. 
Last year when talk first began circulating about the construction of a new bar,-the campus was abuzz about the possibilities for enhancing social life here. When we arrived this fall, no one could say a bad word about the place. For once, the administration and the students were both pleased at how they had attempted to solve a problem. The students got their quick fix, no pain, no wait. The ad­ministration got its new building with its in­creased revenue potential. Everyone was happy, for awhile. 
Now. two months after its opening. the new ~enior Bar has barely a~ much respect a~ the old one. ~eniors can be heard grumbling about how dull it i~. and about how it's no fun. 
and on and on. 
It has become painfully obvious that con­structing a new building to drink in is not going to make Senior Bar or campus social life any better. That type of approach completely ignores the fundamental problem that Notre Dame students do not know how to have fun on campus. 
Can you blame us? For three years, we have been shuffling from dorm to dorm drinking beer in basements, and now senior year we have one more building to do it in, except now it is supposed to be fun. Ifyou think about it, what's at Senior Bar that you cannot find at any given dorm party (aside from exteriors)? 
This is not to slight the efforts ofthe student manager~. They Jo the 1>. 't they can and ~hould he praised. l'nh>rtunately, there is no­thing they can do aboUI the attitudes people bring in with them. Many t1nd it hard to loosen up socially with security mingling in the crowds. For others, the atmosphere is just too tame. Has anyone danced on a table yet in Senior Bar? That may sound stupid, but it's that kind ofexcitement that dissipates the ten­sion students seek to release on weekends. 
So, what is the administration supposed tn do? For starters, they have to start recognizing the fact that there are some very deep, fun­damental social problems on campus. Under­grads live for three years with every possible restriction on how they unwind on the weekends, and then they are called alcoholics and degenerates when they go ahead and have fun in the only ways they know how. The ad­ministration has got to look beyond what is going to look good to what is going to work best for us, the students. 

P.O. BoxQ Missing: raising questions about American foreign policy 
DearEditor: 
"On 12 Sept. 1973, a young American 
journalist came across evidence of covert 
United States involvement in the overthrow 
of Chilean President, Salvador Allende. Five 
days later, Chilean soldiers dragged Charles 
Horman from his home in Santiago. His fami­
ly never saw him again -Universal Pictures 
and Polygram Pictures present a Costa­
;avras film: Missing." The above is a short publicity piece put out by the makers of the movie Missing, which CILA is showing on campus tonight 
and tomorrow night. So what? Movies come and go, some of them blockbusters, and no­thing ever changes. Right? Maybe that is right, but if it is, then it's disturbing. This movie should change things, if only a little, by. helping us to look at ourselves as our neighbors do. We as a people need to take a good look at the United States and how we as a nation treat the countries around us, and specifically how we treat the people in those 
countries. 
The movie, which is based on the book, 
The Execution of Charles Horman by 
Thomas Hauser, raises issues both specific 
and general. Specific questions regard the al­
leged involvement of the American govern­
ment through its representatives in the American Embassy in Santiago, in the execu­tion ofan American citizen in Chile on Sept. 18, 1973. 
Was Charles Horman pointed out to the 
Chilean military by U.S. embassy officials 
who feared that he knew too much? Did em­
bassy officials know that Charles was to be 
executed and did they in fact okay the ex­
ecution? The film does not answer these 
questions; rather, it states emphatically that 
we should ask these questions of ourselves, 
ofour government. 

It has been nine years. So maybe we should forget about it; what's done is done. Right? Yes, but then it is not all in the past. Missing asks general questions about American foreign policy and how it is imple­mented, how we protect our "way of life." These are important questions that are very 
relevant to us today. Charles Horman was 
one ofthousands ofpersonsexecuted, and it 
is not something that happens onlv in Chile. 
But a clear understanding of what happened in Chile nine years ago could help us to guide ourselves through what is fast becom­ing another crisis point, Central America. Before we can face what is before us in Central America and understand how our neighbors perceive us, we must honestly face up to our past in Chile and in the rest of South and Central America. 
In the closing notes of his book, Thomas Hauser states, "1. grew up with an abiding faith in America. It is, in my estimation, the greatest country in the world -not for its wealth of military might but because its people have achieved a balance of security, freedom, and human rights unmatched in history. The preceding pages have been written, not to cast doubt on this country or the men and women who serve so well in our military and diplomatic corps, but rather in the belief that only by self-analysis of this kind can we purify our government and make it better." 
This week we will have a chance to ask a few questions. The movie Missing will be showing in the Engineering Auditorium tonight and tomorrow at 7:00, 9:1 5 and 
II :30 p.m. Admission is S I. On Thursday, Thomas Hauser will speak in the Library Auditorium at H p.m. Go to the movie. Think about it, and talk about it with vour friends. Then come to the Library Auditorium on Thursday with lots of questions.

After Saturday, senior Mike Johnston has enabled the torch to. burn even brighter with his field goals of 29, 42 and 32 yards -the latter coming with only II seconds left as it provided the winning 16-14 margin. For the season he is 9-of-9 in field goals.
