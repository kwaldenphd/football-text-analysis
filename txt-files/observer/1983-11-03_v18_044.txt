issues ofinternational affairs, and his involvement with the Advisory Council will he an inspiration to all of the members ofthe council." 
Dean Rusk, William Rogers and Alexander Haig Jr. have also joined as founders of the coucil. Other original members of the advisory group include Joseph Cardinal Ber· nardin. Archbishop of Chicago; His Eminence lakovos, Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church of North And South America; and Sen Alan]. Dixon ( D.-lll). 
The first meeting of the Advisory · Council will take place in Chicago on Wednesday, Nov. 9. Council members will. consult regularly thereafter to identify cases, projects and other specific needs for religious believers behind the Iron Curtain. 
"Members .of many religious denominations arc harassed and dis­criminated against. their places of worship. theological study and tools of religious practice limited. and their applications for emigration routindy subjected .to long delays and in many cases denied. This is a continuing tragedy." Percy said. 
The council will advise Percy on matters ofconcern to co-religionists in Eastern Europt· and the Soviet Union. Projects to receive the coun­cil's attention include responses to the anti-Semitic campaign in the Soviet llnion, the continuing harass­ment ofCatholic priests in Lithuania 
and  recent  press  reports  of  a  
renewed  tax  on emigrants  from  
Romania.  


The calender should he returned by late November. 
Barbara Racine. manager of the Shaheen Bookstore at 'Saint Mary's, has recieved a request from the producers ofthe calendar to sell it at the _bookstore. A representative from a women's hall at Nl>tre Dame: told her that the calendar was a "fund-raiser sponsered hy the hall to raise montv for charity." However. 
Racine said the woman never gave her name or the: names of the: hall or charity. 
Racine told the woman she would "think about it," hut t·xprc:sscd con­cern that ''it might turn out to he: a pin-up calendar. and those aren't the values we support at Saint Mary's." She also added "Selling that kind of calendar would he like stocking 
Playgirl." 
Hoeler proposed that she thought the calender would he a popular item and should he sold in the bookstore. Both Hocter and 
Racine stressed that the calendar will have to he "in good taste." The bookstore maintains the policy of examining merchandise before ordering it, and Racine plans to con­
tinue this policy. 
Complaints were voiced at the meeting concerning the inadequate business hours of the First Source I3ank branch in the Haggar College Center. When asked by a Board member why they were bdng "so 
stingy with their hours," Hoeler ex­plained that the hank was working on an extension ofbranch hours. She: added that the twenty-four-hour tel­kr will not he: installed until.fanuary. 
Signups begin this week .for the Oxfam Fast in the Saint Mary's dining hall. "We'd like to have as much par­ticipation as possible." said Katie Hoban. who presented the Program­ming Committee report. 
The Du Lac Review Committee will continue analyzing exactly what rights students have. The Commit­
tee is planning a public hearing on DuLac. The: committee also intends to clarify exactly how much power the administration has over student activities both on campus and off. "I would like to know how far (the power) extends and to make sure it 
• is clear to the students," said Gleason. 
A blood drive has hec:n scheduled for Nov. I 0. I I. and I2. Signups for the drive will begin Wednesday. 
On Nov. 9. an art print sak will he held in the LcMans lohh)· from I 0 a.m.-4 p.m. Ten percent of the profits will go to the SMC Student Government.

Dean Roemer to speak to Judicial Council 
ByJOSEPH MURPHY 
News Staff 
Dean of Students James Roemer 
will speak at the Judicial Council's 
workshop for all board members 
Tuesday to "tell what our role is," 
said Judicial Coordinator Bob 
Gleason at last night's meeting ofthe 
council. 
Chuck O'Malley, a member of the 
Special Events Committee which is 
planning the workshop said, "It 
gives the judicial board members 
who have not been that active a 
chance to see what goes on in a trial. 
They will be better prepared when 
they present their cases. It gives 
them an idea of what their respon­
sibilities are." 
Also discussed at last night's 
meeting was the problem of low at­
tendence on the part of council members at the meeting. Gleason began the meeting by saying, "It looks like our attendence is a little low this e\ening." Ten of the 28 members were not present. Gleason commented. "It's just natural be­cause people forget or have too 
much work to do." 
To alleviate the problem the 
publicity committee will send flyers 
to remind members of meetings. 
He stated the five committees 
which comprise the council are 
making progress. 
As coordinator of the judicial council, Gleason has overall control. "I do not want to make this a one man show," he said. Glc:ason said he wants students to contact the coun­cil if they have suggestions and he requested all council members to at­tend future functions.

Ronald Reagan's political fallout 
For thl· first time since Lyndon Johnson's Administration. American troops arc engaged in a';tual fighting in two areas -Lebanon and Grenada. For a president who wants a second term this is dangl·rous !'>tuff politically. Ronald Rl·agan knl'W it when he made the Grenada decision. Is the political fallout of hoth wars likely to doom him or re-elect him? 
Max Lerner The Max Lerner Column 
It lkpt·nds on how he handles the political potl·ntials ofthl·two military operations. Thus far. l'Specially on Grenada, he has had lu<:k and shown skill. 
The luck lay in tht· fortuitous timing of the (in·nadian operation, which happennl to ovt·rlap with the hloody Beirut massacre, and its success gave tht· American people a chance 
to halance their grief with some positive news, and retrieve their damaged self­confidence. 
The skill lay in managing a political-military operation which -despite the foul up by in­telligence -did achieve its objectives at a small cost in casualties. 
The risks were there. A hastily contrived operation can abort, as Jimmy Carter's hostage rescue mission did. A military disaster could have become a political disaster. Reagan was able to mix pride and buoyancy with sadness hy JOtmng Grenada with Lehanon in his accounting to the people. 
Do these two operations add up to a new "Reagan Doctrine." Reagan critics would like to attach a catch name to his foreign policy, as they did to his economics. · 
But the Lebanon and Grenada inteCY-entions are too dissimilar to form a "Doctrine." On Grenada, Reagan is attacked for doing too much too fast, on Lehanon for doing too little too slowly. In one case the American military faced a Cuban force that fought stubbornly but had no anti-aircraft missiles, in the other it would face a Syrian force equipped with the latest Soviet missile technology. 

If there were a Reagan Doctrine in force on Lebanon now, instead of an appeasement operation to hand over power to Syria by a power-sharing plan, America would find some way of striking at the jugular, which is Syria, and changing the new power balance that As­sad profits from. 
But this could involve an expanded war, and would kiU Reagan's re-election chances. Which is why it is not beingseriously studied. 
Yet even if there is no Reagan Doctrine the president has changed the face and climate of American foreign policy with the Grenada operation. The "resoluteness" which he ­promised turns out to be something other than rhetoric. 
The support which the Grenada policy is getting may portend a better chance for a Reagan election victory than I have given him. All he needs to do, at some point, is to pull the Marines out ofLebanon with some face-saving honor, and patch up cosmetically the damage the A merican image is suffering in Lebanon. 
Walter Mondale says we should have asked permission from all the Contadora countrit"S before moving, and that Reagan's action "undermines our ability to effectively criticize what the Soviets have done." 
He must have been talking to his old men­tor, Jimmy Carter, because it is the same tender-minded hogwash that brought the decline of American power and prestige un­der Carter, and would do so again under his former assistant and disciple. 
Happily John Glenn has had the sense to bide his time and keep hi'i tongue on Grenada 

Notre Dame's duty to disclose investments 
The most continmdingquestion ofthe issue of where: and how Notre: Dame: invests its $l';O million t·ndowmc:nt is why Notre: Dame: dot·s not makt· puhlk its investmt·nt porttlio. Notn· Dame: claim~ to support the Sullivan prindpks, guidelint·s for companies investing in racist South Afrka. llowt·vt·r by rdusng to disclose its invt·stmc:nt~. tht· llniversity makes hoth disnts~ion ahout and verification of this alkgnl support impos~ihk. 
Michael Skelly 
Back again 
lkason~ li>r not disclosing art· apparently not li>rthcoming, hut tht· most obvious one is that Notrt· Dame: has somt·thing to hide. If in fal'l tht·rt· is nothing to hide, why not disclose: tht· investnll'nls and c:xonc:ratt· Notre: Dame: of 
all charges of investing in companies engaged in ethically questionable practices. 
The: University's failure to disclose its in­vestments tlic:s in the face of a university's central purpose: -to freely discuss and criticize. To quote: a prominent spokesman on the: role: of the university, Father Theodore 
llc:shurgh, "universities have no monopoly on the misuse offreedom, hut few institutions on earth nc:c:d the: climate of freedom to the: ex­tent that universities do, whatever the: risk in­volved." 
In Th£' Heshurgh Papers, he says that "the: univt-rsity has always hc:en dedicated unique­ly to criticism of itsc:lf and everything else, evL·n, or perhaps especially, in the case of the Catholic university." Sadly enough this is not the: case: at Notre Dame:. Numerous other Catholic and secular (heaven forhid!) schools havt· disclosed their investment portflius and opt·nt·d them to public scrutiny. This fact has not penetrated the: cloud of moral superiority that hangs over the Administration Building, and Notre Dame remains characteristically behind the times. 

Notre Dame still prefers to have its invest­ment decisions made by a handful of ad­ministrators, tucked safely away from costly ethical considerations. Students, faculty and even alumni are denied a forum to criticize these investments. Information about them is simply not to be: had. 
Notre Dame students have a right and a responsibility to know where the money that helps finance their education comes from. By refusing to disclose, the University is denying its students an opportunity to deal on a per­sonal level with some of the most important questions of o.ur day, namely those: of formulating a system of responsible capitalism, influencing and overcoming sys­tems of exploitation (such a~ those in apart­
heid South Africa) and acting ethically in the corporate world. This denial makes Notre Dame's claim of offering students a morally based education smack of moralistic pooh-palling. , 
"We should involve students in every legitimate way to the extent that they arc: wil­ling to assume responsibility, as well ao; to assert their rights," says Hesburgh. If Notre Dame refuses to disclose where its money is invested, how arc students ever going to begin to assume: responsibility, let alone assert their rights? 
Is Notre Dame hiding something from us then? Is the administration simply afraid of criticism? Or arc: investments beyond the: pale ofstudent criticism? If the answer to all these questions is no, then the only question is, "Why not disclose?" "As a professional class of university men and women," Besburgh wonders, "do we effectively bring to our times the wisdom, the insight, the courage, and the moral judgment that should charac­terize our profession?" Do we, Notre Dame?

Mourners pay Halas tribute 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO George Musso, Hugh Gallarneau, Bill Osmanski, George McAfee, George Blanda, Sid Luckman, George Connor, Ed Sprinkle -they're just some of the old Bears in a last lineup to pay final respects to their coach, George Halas. 
A viewing was held Wednesday night for "Papa Bear" Halas, who died Monday of cancer at age 88. Crowds began collecting several hours early outside the North Side funeral home to pay homage to the man who pioneered the National Football League as owner-coach of the Chicago Bears. 
Team officials said donations will go to the Brian Piccolo Cancer Research Fund, which com­memorates the Bears' courageous running back who died of the disease in 1970. 
Fuaeral services Thursday at St. Ita's Church were expected to draw hundreds ofpeople. 
jerry Vainisi, named Bear general manager in one of Halas' last club­associated acts, said NFL commis­sioner Pete Rozelle and virtually all club owners were expected to at­tend the funeral. 
He said the Bears had considered wearing black arm bands, "but we decided Mr. Halas would not have wanted that." 
Mayor Harold Washington re­quested a special session of the city council to honor Halas, Vainisi said, but the Bears asked that such honors come later. 
Mike Ditka, the Bear alumnus who was hand-picked by Halas two years ago to coach the team, said players will be bussed to the funeral services and then return to Lake Forest for practice. 
"It will be interesting to see how we will react (against the Los An­geles Rams Sunday)," said Ditka "We've tried to dedicate the year to him. But unfortunately that's kind of shallow when you have the kind of record ( 3-6) we have." 
Art Rooney, Pittsburgh Steelers' owner and one of Halas' oldest friends, may have summed it up best: 
"He had a great life. I'm sure he 

1ad the life he wanted." 

Referees' strike continues 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Picketing referees, led by union chief Richie Phillips, handed out whistles to fans going in­to last night's Celtics home opener and later entered Boston Garden amid scattered applause. 
"Blow your whistle on scab -eferees," said one sign carried on ihe picket line outside Boston Gar­den before the Celtics' game with the Milwaukee Bucks. 
"The whistles are just another gimmick to call attention to our position," said veteran referee Ed Rush. 
Prior to the start of the game, the Celtics announced twice over the public address system that anyone "throwing an object or blowing a horn or whistle will be ejected im­mediately." 
The referees have been without a 

contract since Sept. I, and the 
league has used substitute referees 
since the exhibition campaign. 
Boston was the fifth site that the 

union referees had picketed since 
the regular season began last Friday. 
They earlier picketed games in 
Philadelphia, New York, In­
dianapolis and East Rutherford, N.J.

First round playoff action begins Sunday in men's interhall football 
By TOM ANTONINI 
.\Jwrls lflriler 

With the compktion of the rq~ular season on tht· Thursday hdi>re Onohn hrcak. six tcams arc now st.·t for tht· 19H.~ mcn's intt·rhall li>othall playoffs. Ill-ginning this Sun­day Dillon, Flanncr, Alumni, Sorin, Stanli>nl, and Howard will hcgin postst.·ason action to dctermint· this yt·ar's intcrhallchampion. 
Tht· playoff pi<:turc was very mu<:h in douht up until thc last four games of tht· rt·gular st·ason, which turnt·d out w he dd(:nsivc hattlcs li>r thc most part. Two of the gamt.·s, Stanford vs. Alumni and Zahm vs. Holy Cross, cndcd in scorckss ties. In othn at·tion, Howard nippcd St. Ed's 2-0 ami Sorin hlanknl Pangborn 
6-0. 
Both Dillon and Howard reccivcd hycs for thc first round of thc four­round tournamcnt. With a perfcct 5­0 record on thc scason, Dillon gaincd thc first hyc. Howard ticd Stanford for thc second best record with a 3-0-1 mark hut was given the hyc aftcr an arbitrary drawing. The first-round games will fcaturc Flan­ncr going against Alumni and Sorin facing Stanford. 
Alumni cnters postscason play with a 2-0-2 mark and must facc a tough Flanncr squad which is 4-1. Hanner's only loss of the year was a -~-0 ddcat against Dillon. Sincc thcn. Flanncr has shut out Off-Campus I 5­0 and hlastcd Gra<:e 22-7. Tht• win­ncr of thc gamc will face Dillon, winner of 19 games in a row and un­scorcd upon in its fivc gamcs this year. Either possibility, the matchup of rivals Alumni and Dillon or a Dillon-Fianncr rematch, should provide somc fireworks. 

Sorin lost its first game of the season hut turned things around in time to make the playoffs. After tying St. Ed's, Sorin went on to defeat Car­roll and Pangborn in eonsecut ive shutouts. They will have to fact: an unbeaten Stanford team ( 3-0-1 ) in round one. The winner will face Rockne Division champ Howard. 
Flanner will meet Alumni this Sun­day at I:00 on Stepan North followed by the Sorin-Stanford game which is schedulcd for 2:00. The site of the championship game on November 20 is still in qucstion. hut hopes remain high that the game will he played in Notrc Dame Stadium.

idt·ntical sn>re. 
With last night's victory, P.E. im­
provnl its rt·cord to 5-1, earning the 

best rccord in tht· kaguc. Tcam cap­
tain Kim Zcrr t·mphao;izt·d tcam cf­
fort as tht· key to P. E.'s success. 
"Wt· put it all togt·thn and I can't 
think ofanything that wt·nt wrong in 
tht· game," she said. 

P.f..'s scoring drivt· camc during 
tht· st-cond half. t•fft'l'tivdy shutting 
out Farky. "We were up for the 
gamt·, Wt' knew we could win and 

wt· fc:lt whot·vt·r playt·d well would 
win tht· gamt·." said Zcrr. 
On Sunday, P.E. will face a tough ·l-1 Lewis squad. Znr dot·s not plan to t·hangt· game stratt·gy for Sunday and said P.E. can win. "ifwe don't gct cocky, and play a good gamc." 
Farley, last ycar's champion, saw ics re<:ord drop to 2-:\ and its chanccs for t.·ompt·tition in thc playoff~ fadc. Sharon Zot·hlcr, Farley tt·am captain, said yt·stt·rday's gamc hurt tht· tt·am badly and that "had hrt·aks may cost us tht· playoffs." 
Zochkr wao; disaprx>inted with the outcomc oflast night's gamt· and with l'arky's scason. "I think wc'rc a hcttcr tcam than thc record shows," shc said. 
Zot·hkr blames last night's loss on tht· tcam's inconsistcncy. To prepart· for thl'ir rcmaining games, the team will be working on eve!'Y play and on improving its intensity. Zochler said the team plans to enter its last two games with the same en­thusiasm as it would if it were going to thc playoffs. 
Although P.W. improved its record to 3-3 yesterday, P.W. ath­ktic commissioner Cathy Schafcr said it is imrx>ssible for P.W. to be includcd in the playoffS. "Therc is no way for us to get in the playoffs, but it doesn't bother us. We're a good team and we'rc happy we did as well a-; wc did," shc said. 

P.W. scored on Badin during the second half and Schafer was pleased with Cathy Swanson's performance lao;t night. Swanson played both of­fcnsivc and dcfcnsivc positions last night and St·hafer said her perfor­mance helped motivate the team. 
St·hafer attributes P.W.'s success this season to thc playt.•rs' dedication to football. "They really enjoy what they're doing and they like to play togethcr," she explained. 
Schafer is looking forward to the tt·am's match against Lewis ncxt wcck. and anticipatcs a victory. "Thcy'rc pumpcd to play Lewis and it will be an emotional high for the season," said Schafer. 
Badin, 0-6 this season, will not participatc in the playoffs this ycar. After last night's 8-0 loss, team cap­tain Sally Esrx>sto said there is a sig­nificant lo~s of team spirit. "Now, evcryone just wants to gct the season over." she said. 
Esposto said therc werc several players who wcren't present at the gamc and thc dcfensc madc some mistakes. In light of Farlcy's loss last night, Esrx>sto will not prcdict how Badin will do against thcm next week.

Are the Irish really this good? 
Do you realize that t~1e 1983 season is almost over ~ and nobody really has any idea how good the Notre Dame football team is? Oh, sure, many people have their · 
opinions. but none ofthem are based on good evidence. M · k S 111 ­
•van 

On one side, you have those people who feel that __l__e__U_________., C'$1­Notre Dame is not nearly as good as its 6-2 record Sports Editor ~·II.. would indicate. They make their judgements from a iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii..;,:;;;;~;;:~·=~;j
pair of games that were played almost six weeks ago, and the fact that the Irish have yet to beat a team with a winning record. But then, how many good teams did North Carolina beat as it moved up to the No. 3 srx>t in the nation? 
Obviously, one person who is a member ofthis group is Doug Looney ofSports Illustrated. Unimpressed by a convincing Irish win over Southern Cal, he accused the Notre Dame defense ofbeing too slow, Steve Beuerlein ofbeing unable to read complex defenses, and the team ofrelying too much on Allen Pinkett. 
Looney was probably too harsh on the team. After all, 
he was making judgements from just one game -one 
that was playcd on a very slick field. However, there are 
many other people who share his doubts about this 
Irish team. 

The Irish have yet to beat a team that has won more than it has lost. They have gone through periods ofplay when they can do nothing on offense against an over­matched team (for instance, thc second quarter against South Carolina). They just have not proved themselves on the field against a good team. 
On the other hand, there are people who feel that Notre Dame has regrouped and is now rolling toward a lx>wl game. The players and coaches feel this way. "In my opinion, wc are playing some of the best football in the country right now," says Pinkett. The fact that Notre Dame has thc third best defensc in the country this wcek and one ofthe top offenses would seem to back up this thinking. 
The final three games of the season will give thc answer. I had said earlier in thc season that the game against Miami was the most important game for Notrc Dame in the last three years. The next two games against Pitt and Penn State, together, will be just as im­rx>rtant. 
The loss to Miami hurt the team more than people realize. Ifyou wonder why Notre Dame isn't moving up the ranking.-; very fast, the Miami game is the answer. Thc team looked so had that people cannot forgct it. Five wins would normally help make people forget, but critics like Looney see the weak opponents and refuse to bt:lieve that the team could have improved so much. 
The effect ofthe Miami game on the students has not 
completely worn off, either. The crowd participation 
has gotten better, but there is still some intensity and 
excitement that is lacking. Wins in the next two gamcs 
will create a lot ofintensity for the Air Force game, but 
there is no use thinking about Air Force and Pcnn State 
with a tough oprxment like Pitt ahead. 
Now that the Pitt game is on CBS, however, thc Irish 
have an excellcnt opportunity to erase some of thc 
doubts. They have an opportunity to partly redeem 
themselves for their performance against Miami. Thc 
players know this. They have to redeem thcmselves on 
the field, though. 
Another thing that the players realize is that a major 
bowl bid is in their own hands. If they bcat Pitt, then 
beat Penn State, then beat Air Foret:, thcrc will bc many 
happy people around campus. However, the students 
have been conditioned not to gct their hopes up too 
high. The past two years have becn markcd with con­
tinual disappointments, so they have come to expect 
that the disappointments will continue. 
I'll admit that I'm an eternal optimist, but I feel that the disappointments may bc coming to an end. I've al­ways felt that the tcam had thc talent. Judging from tht· prescason (X>lis, there wcrc a lot ofso-called "cxperts" who felt the samc way. It wa'i dcsirc that I felt wao; lack­ing. Now it appears that the players have the desire. 
The players seem to have rcachcd the saturation point as far as outside prcssure is concerncd. It is not affecting them like it used to. They arc worrying about just the opponcnt and not the oprxmcnt and the outside pressure. One more loss will reduce thc fun that thcv are now having. though. . 
Pitt is going to want revenge, which makes Notrc Dame's job harder, but, if thc Notrc Dame players have any character or any pride, they will be ready for the fired-up Panthers by being even more fired up. 
They have a chance in the next three games to gain a great deal of rcspect and they can't let this oprx>rtunity slip away. They already blew a big chance whcn they lost to Miami. Respect, a high ranking. and a bowl hid­these last three games mcan so much. Wc'll see if they are up to the challenge.
