WVFI approaching goal of FM signal 
By JASON WILLIAMS 
Associate News Editor 
WVFI has got their foot in the door. and hupefully the oppor­tunity for them to go FM will not be slammed in their face·. A simple phone call to a Notre Dame alumnus could land WVFI at 105.5 on the FM dial, according to Station Manager Steven Sostak. 
"We had this guy's number laying around for a year and a half and we decided to give him a call to see what he could do," Sostak said. "It turns out he was waiting for us." 
The number belonged to Dennis Kelly, a 1976 graduate and former WSND employee. He now works as a communica­tions lawyer in the District of Columbia. 
Kelly is helping WVFI iron­out the legal aspects of making the AM-FM transition pro bono. 
"If this goes through he will end up saving us probably $10,000," Sostak said. 
"He's already saved us four or five grand plus he's using inside connections to help us out." 
Much of the cash necessary for WVFI to make the switch involves research in order to find an available frequency. Kelly has done this without pay. 
Another big chunk of money is required to purchase FM transmitting equipment. WVFI has already discussed the pos­sibility of Student Senate help­ing the station out with some of these costs, Sostak said. 

A disc jockey at WVFI anticipates the station receiving authorization for an FM signal. Dennis Kelly, a NO alumnus and former employee of the station, has offered his services to obtain the signal. 
"The Student Senate had their budget committee meeting Saturday. I talked it over with Dave (Hungeling) and he said it sounds like a great idea," he said. "The thing is we have to act now because an opportunity like this doesn't come along very often, and this is by far the best opportunity we've ever had." 
WVFI has yet to make contact with the administration with its plans, but Sostak said he has high hopes for making the tran-

sition work. 
"This whole thing is still in the proposal stages," he said. "But I think if the administra­tion, student government and WVFI all pitch in we should get it done." 
Currently. WVFI is preparing applications to submit to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is standard procedure. 
WVFI is hoping to switch over to a "Class D low power non­commercial FM broadcast fre­quency," 105.5 MHz. The power output would be 10 watts, allowing approximately a five-mile listening radius from the antenna, which would ide­ally be placed on top of LaFortune, according to Sostak. 
It will take the FCC four to six months to process WVFI's ap­plication once it is received, and with the administration's approval WVFI could be operat­ing on an FM frequency as early as the spring semester of 1995. 


Student budget to offer 'fun' 
By KATE CRISHAM Assistant News Editor 
Student Body President and Vice President David Hungeling and Matt Orsagh ran on a plat­form of delivering fun to the Notre Dame student body. 
And to many, it seems like they might be able to deliver it. 
The 1994­95 student government budget, which was released this weekend, has allocated $70,500 in funds to make ND "more fun, more interesting, and more educa­tional," according to student government Chief of Staff Tyler Farmer. 
"We've cut the extraneous expenses," said Farmer. "In response to the dramatic events of this past February, we requested a large part of our funds to be allocated for the entertainment of the stu­dents." 
The Office of Student Activities has allocated $10,000 for a concert fund. According to Farmer. student govern-

No band to play at AnTostal 
By ROB ADAMS 
News Writer 
The An Tostal Concert. ten­tatively scheduled for April 23, has been canceled because there is not a band selected by the SUB Music Committee and within the Committee budget that can make it to South Bend on that date, according to Bethany Riddle, head of the committee. 
"Essentially, we checked out every possibility," said Riddle, "but there aren't many bands touring right now. Plus, that is a very busy college weekend, so all the campuses are fighting for the bands." 
The Committee was consid­ering the Violent Femmes, a Milwaukee band whose style would create an almost assured sellout, but the Femmes turned the offer down. 
After discussing what bands to bring in for over two months, the Committee decided on the Violent Femmes in early March and placed a bid of $15,000 along with offering to pay pro­duction costs. The Femmes nor­mally collect between $18,000 to $21,000. 
The first bid was turned down because it was not enough money. and the Committee countered with a $17,000 bid plus production, provided that the show sold out, but that bid was rejected as well. 
In a last-gasp effort, the Committee allocated extra funds in order to offer $20,000 plus production to the Violent Femmes, and that bid was turned down before Easter. 
"What makes me angry is that our middleman told us that the Femmes had stated they would take any venue if the price is decent and it's not out of their way. We offered the money, and they are going to be at Valpo on the 19th and they're heading for Iowa. So they must have changed their mind," said Riddle. 
Preliminary planning for the AnTostal show began as early as last fall, when the Committee was looking ahead to bands that were going to be releasing new albums and setting up spring tours. 
The actual planning began in January, when the Committee drafted a list of about thirty possibilities. By late February, that list was shortened to five bands: Lemonheads, Phish, B­52's, Arrested Development and the Violent Femmes. 
The Lemonheads could not perform because the location was out of the way, Phish and Arrested Development asked for a fee beyond what SUB could offer (in the $25,000 to $30,000 range), and the B-52's ended their tour before April. The Violent Femmes were left. 
Riddle said that the Music Committee does not need to be allocated more money in their budget. 
"The problem is not with the budget. Ten dollars is cheap for a concert ticket and Stepan is not a band venue," said Riddle. "No bands have ever complained about the sound, and I don't know much about sound, but if the Indigo Girls decided to use part of their Stepan show on their live album, it can't be that bad." 
There are other bands which may have been a possibility for AnTostal, but the Committee decided against making a bid for them, because of the fact that they probably would not sell many tickets. 
"We're dealing with a super conservative campus and we probably could bring some other bands in, but we have to find a band that the campus would pay to see," said Riddle. 
Riddle said that, although it has not happened for Notre Dame, college campuses have to worry about developing a reputation for not selling a lot of tickets. 
"Big Head Todd <:arne here, sold 800 tickets. and then head­ed for Marquette and a sold-out show," said Riddle. 
Riddle said that Notre Dame needs to be able to raise ticket prices and sell more tickets in order to have good shows in the future. 
''I'd like fifteen-dollar tickets to be standard, because that would be $27,000 for a sellout crowd at Stepan. If we can get students aware of the fact that we need to charge 12 to 15 bucks a ticket to bring in the bands we want, maybe we'll be able to bring in better bands," she said.

INSIDE COLUMN 
No thin' better than bein' a slob 

I can't remember exactly when during my freshman year I became a slob or if the transformation was a fast or slow process; but, on April 11, 1994 I am ready to admit that I am one. There was once a time when I made my bed at least five times a week, put my clothes in the clos­et and emptied out the trash. The sink in my room was once immacu­late, the dishes were always clean and the odor was never unpleasant. 
Living in a triple is an easy way to conform to a messy lifestyle. I was the first to cross the line and my roommate made the switch shortly after I did. I never thought the third room­mate, otherwise known as our maid, would give in to our piggish lifestyle, but she is now in full force. And this is when the problems began... 
We now wash our face, clean the floor, and pick up minor spills with the same washcloth, that we all share. The fresh bar of dial soap appeared to have grown into the sink and we are afraid to remove it because of the fungus growing on top of it. We are now proud owners of sea monkeys that float in our unwashed dishes. There is a tremendous pile of clothes on the floor and I won't even begin to talk about our multi-purpose sink. 
One day, when we were brave enough to open the refrigerator that was filled with fat-free ranch dressing, garlic pickles, and Ortega salsa, an overwhelming odor plunged forth. After regaining consciousness from the smell, we hired an exterminator to come and dispose of our miniature "Land of the Lost." 
As a symbol of our slovenliness, my room­mates and I hung our filthiest article of clothing, which happened to be an old formal date's tee­shirt that had fulfilled its purpose in life as a door mat, outside our room to serve as a ban­ner of our foul existence. 
I believe the most horrific experience, howev­er, had to be the foul odor of spoiled milk. Apparently, I had forgotten an old bowl of frost­ed mini-wheats. The odor was so nasty that it filled the room and we had no clue where it was coming from. Could you imagine our surprise when the plumber came and told us our sink was not backed up? 
As I look back I remember our friends always being in our room. Now I have noticed that no one comes near our room at all. It is even hard for me to stay in there for long periods o time. However, I have no desirable urge to start cleaning and I have no regrets about my transformation. 
But, alas, it is getting warm enough to open the windows and air out this fimilar place I call home. Maybe even a few of our friends will dare to enter our room again. 
Even so, there is no reason to be clean! I con­clude that I am not alone in my belief; if there is ever a time to be a slob that time is now, and I am taking full advantage of it. I know when I return home I will be back to my orderly self again. But in the mean time, I will try to ignore the order, only wear clothes on the top of my laundry pile, and make sure there is always a frre path leading to my door.

Clinton's friend: Trading not wrong 
WASHINGTON 
The man who urged Hillary Rodham Clinton to get into the cattle futures market in the late 1970s said Sunday there was nothing wrong with him plac­ing some orders for her with a broker. "I can find no regulations of the. Chicago Mercantile Exchange covering 1978 and '79 that make it improper for one private citizen to call in an order for another private citizen," James Blair said in a telephone interview. Clinton accepted Blair's suggestion to get into the cattle futures market shortly before her husband was elected governor of Arkansas and went on to turn a $1,000 initial investment into nearly $100,000 in a little over a year. During the time of the trading, Blair was outside counsel for Tyson Foods Co., Arkansas' biggest employer. 

Anti-terrorist official murdered 
CAIRO 
The Islamic fundamentalist Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya, or Islamic Group, claimed responsibility Sunday for a rifle and grenade attack that killed Egypt's top anti-terrorism official. The group also threatened further assaults on intelligence and law enforcement officials in its state­ment, which was faxed to a Western news agency. The killing Saturday night was the most daring operation car­ried out in Cairo in the two-year campaign by Muslim radicals to overthrow the secular government and turn Egypt into an Islamic state. The government had claimed to have curbed the extremists, but the attack showed they could strike in the capital and kill the man assigned to destroy them. The victim, Maj. Gen. Raouf Khayrat, 48, was deputy chief of state security intelligence in charge of religious terrorist activities. Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfy, speaking Sunday at Khayrat's funeral, said: "The terrorist operations only increase the police determina­tion to confront terrorism." The Islamic Group has been blamed for much of the violence. It also claimed responsi­bility for a bombing of a suburban Cairo bank.

Cobain's widow reads suicide note 
SEATTLE 
Kurt Cobain's widow read parts of his suicide note in a angry, profane taped message to thousands of Nirvana fans gathered for a candlelight vigil Sunday. Cobain, 27, whose anguished lyrics had helped sell millions of records featuring Nirvana's guitar-gritty sound since 1991, was found Friday in the home he shared with wife Courtney Love and their toddler daughter. He died of a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head, a one-page note nearby, authorities said. "I haven't felt the excitement for so many years," Love read. "I felt guilty for so many years. The fact is I can't fool you, any one of you. The worst crime is faking it." Love interrupted her narrative to add: "No, the worst crime is leaving." "I don't have the passion any more," Cobain wrote, and borrowing from a Neil Young song, added, "It's better to burn out than to fade away." But Love added on tape to the crowd: "Don't believe that, it's bull---." 
Schindler's wife honored for help 
LOS ANGELES 
During the bleakest years of World War II, Emilie Schindler risked her life to help her husband, Oskar, save hundreds of Jews from Nazi death camps. She bought medicine and food on the black market. And when her husband was arrested by Nazi officials, she negotiated his release. The story of Oskar Schindler, a German en­trepreneur who saved 1,200 Jews by employing them in his factories, became famous with Steven Spielberg's Academy Award-winning film "Schindler's List." The story of his wife is not so widely known. Her efforts were acknowledged during a ceremony Sunday at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Musuem of Tolerance. She, in turn, lit a flame in the Center's courtyard in memory of the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust. It was one of several Holocaust remembrances held around the country for Yom Hashoa, which was Wednesday. "For what I did, I did not expect any reward," Mrs. Schindler said through an interpreter. "I just did what (one does) when others are in trouble, when other people are murdered."

regarding nuclear weapons is the permanent renewal of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995. The NPT, Holum said is the most im­portant tool in nuclear arms control. It urges every nuclear and non-nuclear nation to com­pletely forego the option of nuclear weapons in armed con­flicts and place nuclear fa­cilities under international con­trol in a permanent end to the nuclear arms race. 
The primary advantages for nations willing to relinquish their nuclear option are inter­national security with non­nuclear neighbor countries, fis­cal "sanity," a lessening of the threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction in war, and economic trade advantages, said Holum. 
Measures such as the NPT and other non-proliferation treaties are the main tools the Clinton administration has used in arms reduction. 
"Arms control is my job, as well as my mission," said Holum, who stated that the true strength in bringing about the reduction and ultimate elimina­tion of nuclear weapons is in the hands of concerned citi­zens.

News Writer 
The danger and uncertainty of nuclear proliferation was the topic of David Kay's keynote address for the conclusion of the "Bombs, Carrots, and Sticks: Economic Sanctions and Nuclear Non-Proliferation" con­ference. 
Kay was a first hand witness to the scale of the Iraqi nuclear arms development program. As head of the IAEA Weapons Inspection Team, he and a group of other United Nations delegates investigated bases and possible production sights in Iraq. 
He and his inspection team discovered a huge program for the construction of nuclear devices even though Iraq had denied any such project. 
"They had invested between 10 and 12 billion U.S. dollars from 1981 to 1991. Iraq had 20,000 people working on their nuclear program. They were within 18 months of having a nuclear device and only four years away from the ability to produce 20 devices a year," said Kay. 
"The situation in Iraq showed the inadequacy of intelligence and international inspection," he continued. 
Kay said that the discoveries in Iraq pointed to the failure of the policy of nuclear non-pro­liferation. 
He pointed out that the U.S. is incapable of stopping other nations from acquiring the technology necessary for the construction of a nuclear device.

"The computers used to pro­duce America's first atomic bomb and thermonuclear devices are five times weaker than a Macintosh powerbook," said Kay. 
"We have a real lack of mili­tary and diplomatic answers for the problem of proliferation at this time," he added. 
The use of economic sanc­tions to stop nuclear prolifera­tion will not work, he argued. He said that the impact of such measures was slow in handling the situation. 
Kay also pointed out that the adoption of sanctions against a country is often seen as an act of war. 
Plus, economic sanctions hurt those people who exist at the margins of a country rather than those who should be pun­ished. People of wealth and power continue their lives un­scathed, while the common class suffers from the damage inflicted by the sanctions, said Kay. 
At the conclusion of his lec­ture, Kay turned his knowledge and experience from the inspections in Iraq towards the current situation in North Korea. 
"There is a 70 percent chance of an armed conflict on the Korean peninsula in the next nine months. This is the most dangerous national crisis since the Cuban Missile crisis," warned Kay. 
He said that the U.S. must develop some effective method of dealing with these situations since nuclear proliferation seems to be the trend of the future.

MEXICO CITY 
Thousands of people marched across Mexico City on Sunday in the largest show of support yet for the Zapatista rebels, who launched an uprising Jan. 1 in southern Mexico. 
The march was held to mark the 75th anniversary of the death of revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, for whom the rebels are named. It began in Chiapas, covering 460 miles to Mexico City. Thousands joined in. 

"Zapata lives!" protesters shouted as they walked two miles to a rally on the main square, the vast Zocalo. The procession of about 30,000 peo­ple was led by Indians in Aztec headdresses dancing to drums, followed by block after block of peasants. 
A revered combatant of the 1910 revolution, Zapata was assassinated on April 10, 1919. His death is commemorated each year by Mexico's ruling party as well as opponents of the government, both of whom battle for his legacy. 
The rebellion led by Zapata was prompted by land disputes similar to those that provoked the Indian uprising in Chiapas, where rebels are calling for greater democracy and land reform. 
More than 145 people died in the Chiapas uprising before a Jan. 12 cease-fire. Rebels have since suspended peace talks, following the assassination last month of the ruling party's presidential candidate.

Redbud activities planned 
By ANNE DELANEY 
News Writer 
Celebrating its twentieth ses­sion Redbud Fine Art Workshops will be offered by Saint Mary's College once again from May 16-28. 
With four intensive work­shops in a two-week session, this year's Redbud will consist of classes in acting, ceramics, printmaking/book arts and sculpture. Students have the opportunity to concentrate in one of these areas enriched by group and open critiques. 
The session focuses on the surrounding resources the Redbud Trail Camp provides. The majority of the work is done outdoors with an empha­sis on the environment as a medium of sources. This or­ganic focus permits students to 
CAMPUS BRIEF 
attain what they need from what is available in nature. 
It is a holistic, integrated ex­perience of continuity. not only in the concentrated area but personally as well, said Julie Tourtillotte of the Saint .Mary's art department. Spontaneity is encouraged and much interac­tion between workshops is fa­cilitated. The interaction is due greatly to the small class size, generally five to eight students, and the common surroundings. 
"It is a time for complete fo­cus on what you're do­ing ... there are no distractions or external responsibilities. All you have to worry about is yourself, your work and gaining insight from both," said two­time veteran and Saint Mary's senior Colleen O'Rourke. 
Classes are designed as a variation from the traditional way of teaching, especially because of the environmental focus. 


Redbud Trail Camp, the natu­ral preserve that Saint Mary's has rented for 20 consecutive years, is located in Buchanan, Michigan. It was started in 1975 by Sister Rose Ellen Morrissey, who felt a need for students to be broadened out­side of school. 
The camp has furnished cab­ins and a main lodge with din­ing facilities and instructional spaces. There are also recre­ational facilities which include a volleyball court, soccer field, swimming pool, nature trail and ping-pong table. 
The program offers three transferable credits. There are no prerequisites for the pro­gram, and applicants need not be art majors nor students at Saint Mary's College. The only requirement is that applicants be 18 years old. 
A dinner with activities and a display of artwork on May 22 from 1-7 p.m. will be open. 
Interested applicants should contact Julie Tourtillotte at 284-4631.

Earth Week designed 
to improve awareness 
By KATE CRISHAM 
Assistant News Editor 
The third annual Notre Dame Earth Week, sponsored by Students for Environmental Action, com­menced this weekend with a tree planting on Saturday and an opening mass celebrated by Father Tom McDermott in the Lyons Hall chapel on Sunday. 
This year's Earth Week will feature a wide variety of activities, including movies, an Environmental Forum, and a lecture by Greenpeace activist Christopher Childs, in an effort to increase environ­mental awareness at Notre Dame. 
"It should be a really good week," said Students for Environment Action President Chad Clay. "A lot of people have put a lot of hard work in putting it together." 
Clay said the lecture by 
Childs, who was voted the 1993 campus lecturer of the year. should be one of the highlights of the week. 
"He's a really renowned speaker. and he gives a great presentation;" said Clay. "He should add a lot to the week." 
Clay hopes that the Earth Week will help educate the Notre Dame community on their responsibilities to the environment. 
"It's a chance to give some presentations to the student body," said Clay. "There are lots of resources students can make use of." 
Clay believes that there has been a substantial increase in environmental awareness among the student body in re­cent years. 

"The recycling bins in LaFortune and recycling the napkins in the dining hall are just a few of the changes we've seen in the last couple of years," he said. 
Preacher calls for legal drugs 
By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
President Clinton didn't like it when his surgeon general raised the possibility of legaliz­ing drugs. On Sunday he heard similar advice from the pulpit of his wife's church. 
The Rev. 
W a I t e r Shropshire Jr., a minister at the Foundry United Methodist Church, said such a step might "make a safer environment for all of us." 
If doctors could write pre­scriptions for narcotics, addicts could "obtain it cheaply and (they) would not have to go out and arm themselves to obtain the money," Shropshire said in a sermon on Christian fellow­ship. 
When asked what he thought of Shropshire's comments, Clinton said, "I disagree."

Chemicals threaten workers 
By DAVID BRISCOE 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Chemicals, mostly from in­dustrialized countries, are causing disease and death in the developing world and the problem is worsened by the buildup of chemical waste, a 
U.N. study says. 
The study released Sunday by the International Labor Organization estimates that up to 2 billion of the world's 3 bil­lion workers are exposed to growing numbers of possibly harmful chemicals in the work­place. 
Most are in the Third World, but danger zones range from banana plantations in Costa Rica to skyscrapers in New York, where office workers' health may be affected by emis­sions from machines, furniture and even "toxic rugs." 
The report notes the wide benefits of chemicals but says they are too often misused, par­ticularly in the Third World. It also cites the possible long­term danger from chemicals whose harmful effects are not yet fully known. 
"Basically, we live in a chem­ical world," said Isaac Obadia, ILO safety and health officer. Production has doubled since 1985, he said, with close to 10 million natural and man-made chemicals. 
"Lack of training, lack of knowledge, lack of regulatory controls make it a much more the waste to the Third World, serious problem in developing the report said. countries," he said, adding that the biggest risk is from pesti­The report was prepared for cides. an international conference

Senate group declares Haiti presidency vacant 
By MICHAEL NORTON 
Associated Press 
PORT-AU-PRINCE 

A breakaway group of Haitian senators hostile to the return of exiled Presid,ent 
Jean-Bertrand  Aristide  
declared  the  presidency  
vacant Sunday.  

The symbolic move lacked support from Haiti's lower house of Parliament and the international community. 
But the leader of the anti­Aristide senators hinted it had backing from those who top­pled the nation's democrati­cally elected leader in a 1991 coup. 
"We have weighed our deci­sion and waited for the right moment. This is not an isolat­ed act. It has whatever force is necessary behind it," Sen. Bernard Sansaricq told The Associated Press. 
The Senate group voted 11-0 to annul a June 1993 parlia­mentary act reinstating Aristide as president. The sen­ators also urged Supreme Court Chief Justice Emil Jonassaint to become provi­sional president, designate a premier and hold new elec­tions. 
Although the vote is symbol­ic without broader parliamen­tary support, it cements divi­sions in the Senate. It is another obstacle to a U.S. plan for Aristide to broaden his support in Parliament. The 
U.S. Embassy's deputy chief of mission, Vicki Huddleston, briefly attended Sunday's ses­sion at the rundown Legislative Palace in Haiti's capitol. 
As Parliament emptied, 40 school-children chanted on cue: "Down with the embargo! Down with Aristide!" 

Violence abates in Rwanda 
By PAULINE JELINEK 
Associated Press 
KIGALI, Rwanda 

Fires burned on the outskirts of the devastated capital of Rwanda and hundreds looted aid warehouses as fighting abated Sunday after three days of savagery. At a hospital in Kigali, doctors claimed, soldiers slaughtered at least 100 patients in their beds 
Relief officials estimate as many as 10,000 people have been killed in Kigali alone. The fighting -the result of a decades-old struggle between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups -has forced hundreds of Europeans and Americans to flee the country, many for neighboring Burundi. 
Foreigners were leaving by air from Kigali airport or by convoy to Bujumbura, Burundi's capital. 
President Clinton said Sunday in Washington that "the last of the convoys containing all Americans who wish to leave has either passed into Burundi or is about to pass into Burundi." About 250 Americans, mostly missionaries and aid workers, were in Rwanda. 
In Kigali, Eric Bertin, a co­ordinator for the French Doctors Without Borders, said when he and colleagues arrived at a hospital Sunday, they found patients they had treated the day before had been killed by soldiers overnight. 
He estimated that at least 100 people were murdered, many in beds in tents set up around the hospital. 
"We have decided it is no use 
to work here anymore," Bertin said. "It is useless to cure someone who is going to be killed anyway. They were just lying in their tents dead." 
Elsewhere in the city, bodies were strewn in the streets. Fighting had raged since the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi J uvenal Habyarimana and Cyprian Ntaryamira -died in a suspi­cious plane crash on Wednesday on return from a conference in Tanzania aimed at ending ethnic strife in their countries. 
The Rwandan government said the plane was shot down by unidentified attackers. U.N. officials were prevented from going to the crash site. 
In the rampage that followed, residents were dragged from their homes and shot to death or hacked to pieces. The acting prime minister was slain as she sought refuge. Aid workers, priests and nuns were targeted in the massacres. · 
Gangs armed with knives, guns and machetes went house to house at night demanding food, money and alcohol, according to foreigners who fled Kigali. 
Outside the capital, fighting has pitted the Hutu-dominated army and the mostly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
The two sides reportedly agreed to a cease-fire on Sunday, but its effectiveness was in doubt. 
"Both parties reached an agreement on a cease-fire and apart from some sporadic gun­fire, it seems to be respected," Col. Luc Marchal of the Belgian 
U.N. contingent in Kigali told Belgian television network RTBF.

U.S. bombs Serb adva11tces Clinton: Planes ready 
By SRECKO LATAL Associated Press 
SARAJEVO 
Two U.S. F-16 fighter jets bombed targets near the be­sieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde on Sunday after Bosnian Serb forces overran government defenses to reach the outskirts of the town. 
It was the first NATO attack on ground positions in its 44­year history. In February, NATO jets downed four Serb planes violating a "no fly zone" over Bosnia, which has been convulsed by civil war since se­ceding from Yugoslavia two years ago. 
NATO headquarters in Naples, Italy, said the planes were U.S. F-16Cs based in Aviano, Italy, and said the at­tack was requested by U.N. peacekeepers in Gorazde be­cause of the Serb advance. 
"The United Nations made it absolutely clear that there were 
U.N. personnel in Gorazde, that an attack on the town would be interpreted as a clear violation of the rules," President Clinton told reporters in Washington. 
"We said we would act if we were requested to do so. We have now done so and will do so again if we are requested." 

were hit. Bosnian Serbs accused NATO of hitting civilian targets. 
"NATO aircraft fired four missiles at civilian targets," Gen. Milan Gvero, deputy com­mander of the Bosnian Serb army, was quoted as saying by the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA. He said there were civil­ian casualties but did not elabo­rate. 
"With this action NATO has committed open aggression against the Serb people, by at­tacking civilian targets far from the front," said a statement from the command of the Herzegovina Corps, which has been besieging Gorazde. 
The statement, carried by SRNA, said the air strikes were carried out against targets in a mountainous region seven miles southwest of Gorazde. 
A U.N. source in Belgrade, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bosnian Serbs responded with anti-aircraft frre. 
U.N. officials said three to five bombs were dropped. 
Earlier Sunday, U.N. aid offi­cials painted a picture of grow­ing chaos as Serb forces pushed toward the outskirts of Gorazde.

"The situation in the town is very calm right now," Olivier Van Bunnen, a representative of Doctors Without Borders in Gorazde, told The Associated Press via ham radio four hours after the bombing.

NCAA tournament creates security, scalping problems 
In the wake of the chaos after winning the 1992 NCAA basketball tournament, offi­cials at Duke University saw campus safety as a main con­cern during this year's tour­nament and championship game. 
Before the game, police fo­cused on preventing the set­ting of bonfires, issuing cita­tions or arresting students caught lighting fires on cam­pus. 
For the 1992 game, an offi­cial university-approved bon­fire event was held, but there were no such plans for this year's game. 
Previously, students had been able to set bonfires with little risk of punishment, yet this year, police cracked down to control the pre-game and post-game festivities. 
Another problem facing the university during the NCAA tournament was the preven­tion of ticket scalping for the championship game held in nearby Charlotte, North Carolina. 
With more than 600 student tickets made available by the university and prices reaching upwards of $1000, the univer­sity acted to maintain fairness and legality in the selling of tickets to students and fans.

'Narcissistic reasoning' complaint contra the GSU? 
Dear Editor: 
In his letter of March 23, "Graduate Student Union needs refocusing, " Elgin Anderson claims to be supported by "the majority of us" in stating that "graduate students are being grossly misrepresent­ed" by the GSU. The manner in which he puts forward this "majority" opinion merits careful analysis, because its implications stretch far beyond his spe­cific disagreement with the GSU. His letter involves much broader issues such as the place of minority voices on this campus and the real nature and purpose of graduate study. 
Toward the beginning of the letter, Mr. Anderson states that he is "(s]peaking not only for [him]self. but for the majori­ty of Aerospace and Mechanical engi­neering graduate students." By the next paragraph, however. his speaking posi­tion has expanded to represent an unspecified "majority of us." 
What began as a view held by some students in a particular department is thus attributed to an "us" that slides over to include the rest of the graduate students as well. And in his conclusion, he explicitly opposes this "most of us" to "a complaining, self-serving minority." 
He has already identified this self-serv­ing minority: it consists of "radical femi­nists[and] the gay/lesbian movement." 
It is easy to figure out the identity of Mr. Anderson's "majority." Not femi­nist, ergo male; not gay or lesbian, ergo heterosexual; not a minority, ergo white. In effect, Mr. Anderson's complaint against the GSU is that it is not governed solely by a white, heterosexual, male agenda. And when a spokesman for this "majority" dismisses minority concerns as irrelevant, one can't help wondering exactly who is being self-serving here. 
In projecting his own self-servitude on to a so-called radical minority, Mr. Anderson makes statements that border on the bizarre. He writes, for instance, that "the majority of us do not have time to complain about being victimized by the mainstream." By definition, the majority is the mainstream; what his argument amounts to, then, is that the majority doesn't complain about being victimized by the majority. 
The narcissism behind such reasoning would be laughable if it weren't also dangerous. For it presents a particular white, male, heterosexual position as the only natural one, the only possible one, and indeed, the only "real" one. When Mr. Anderson says that he "re­sent[s] having to take time out from real work" to write his letter, he implies that the minority concerns he opposes are unreal. 
Unsurprisingly enough, he can then dismiss the very possibility that dis­crimination against minorities takes place: "It's not discrimination. It's life. It's something adults have to deal with." On Mr. Anderson's terms, the ex­perience of discrimination is not a part of real, adult life. 
He thus characterizes students involved with minority issues as shift­less, immature malcontents who have no "real" work to occupy themselves with, in contrast to the productive and hardworking majority: "Most of us," he writes, "have very difficult programs and are focused on our specific research problems and on graduating on time. We also have professors, advisers, and sponsors who rightfully expect our work to come first." 
This is a slur against the academic commitment and capabilities of gradu­ate students involved with minority issues; a slur against their graduate advisers, who are characterized as being willing to accept slipshod and incompetent work; a slur against the overall quality of the Graduate School, which is represented as having at least some programs that are soft, easy to complete without rigorous effort. 
It is worth pointing out that this slur rests ultimately upon a false definition of what constitutes academic work. Research in the humanities and social sciences frequently deals with issues of gender, race, and/or sexual preference. The involvement of many graduate stu­dents with the way gender identities are played out on campus is a direct exten­sion of their professional lives, and is indispensable to their academic train­ing. 
By pooh-poohing the value of debates about these issues, Mr. Anderson negates the diversity of the academic endeavor. Here as throughout, he takes his own experience as a white, hetero­sexual, male graduate student in an engineering discipline and sets it up as normative, as the only correct way of being and studying.

relieving freshman Joy Bat­tersby in the first game. She struck out four over two in­nings, but it was the defensive heroics of centerfielder Amy Rueter that preserved the win for the Irish. 
In the bottom of the seventh 
and the score tied 1-1 and Titan runners on first and second, Rueter made a diving catch and was able to 

catch the Stephanie 
runner off Pinter second base for a double play to end the inning. 
In the top of the eighth, Rueter made a key sacrifice to advance runner Jenna Knudson into scoring position for fresh­man Elizabeth Perkins. With Knudson home and Perkins on first, Hayes ripped a triple to score Perkins and give the Irish a 3-1 cushion. 
Later, in the home half of the eighth . Rueter made an over­the-shoulder catch on the warning track for the last out of the game. 
"We wouldn't have been in a position to win that first game if it hadn't been for Amy Rueter's defense and her performance at the plate," Miller said. 
Kobata started the next game, and earned her third perfect game of the year. Titan batters were stymied as Kobata punched out nine over six in­nings. 
"I was disappointed that I didn't get the perfect game Sat­urday, but I really tried not to

think about that Sunday," Ko­bata said "I didn't have that many strikeouts. The defense made outstanding plays. Our offense and defense looked really strong." 
While Kobata was silencing the opponent's bats, the Irish hitters were dominating the opposing pitchers. 
Senior first baseman Stephanie Pinter had nine hits in the four weekend games, in­cluding a four-for-four perfor­mance in Sunday's second game. She drove in nine runs and had two doubles. 
"Stephanie really drove the ball all over the park this week­end," Miller said. "She had all different varieties of hits and hit all kinds of pitches. It was just an outstanding weekend for her." 
Career home-run leader Hayes ripped her ninth round­tripper of the season with a two-run shot in the first game against Evansville. She had seven hits and drove in four runs. 
The Irish must hope they can play with the same muscle Tuesday when they host DePaul in a doubleheader at Ivy Field. The Blue Demons are currently ranked second in the NCAA Mideast regional poll. 
"DePaul might be the best team in the region," Miller says of Tuesday's foe. "They run a lot; they have a lot of speed. Our key is going to be keeping them ofT the bases." 
For the Irish to win, Miller knows the Irish must keep hit­ting like they did in Detroit, where they banged out 42 hits over the four games. 
"Keeping those hits will be a big factor if we are going to win this game, " Miller says. "But the game is winnable for us if we hit like we did this week­

Olazabal shocks Masters field

Associated Press 
AUGUSTA, Ga. 

The Masters. Another foreign champion. A player of enor­mous talent finally realizing unfulfilled promise. 
The story line held ~;~p. Just substitute the name Jose Maria Olazabal for Greg Norman. 
This was to be the Masters that Norman finally won, but it became the major Olazabal finally won. The Spaniard stumbled over the last two holes, but so did Tom Lehman and Larry Mize. 
Olazabal's solid closing round of 69 on Sunday gave him 279 for 72 holes, two strokes ahead of Lehman and three ahead of Mize, the winner here in 1987. 
Playing in the same group with Lehman and just behind Mize, Olazabal scrambled when he had to, tamed the tricky Augusta greens and never cracked in the pressure down the stretch. He didn't make a bogey until he hit a poor chip on the 17th. 
Olazabal all but closed it out by rolling in a 40-foot eagle

putt on the par-5 15th after his second shot barely cleared the water and didn't roll into the pond as others had all week. 
Lehman, who shot 72, made a great run at a 20-foot eagle try on the same hole but left it just short. He fell to the ground and pounded the rock-hard Augusta green with his fists in disap­pointment. 
His last shot to put pressure on Olazabal came at 18, but he missed a 20-foot par putt after driving into a sand trap. 
Olazabal, who started the day 6 under, one stroke behind Lehman, birdied Nos. 2 and 8 on the front nine -both par 5s -and then ran off six consecu­tive pars before his eagle. 
Olazabal took home $360,000, Lehman earned $216,000 and Mize collected $136,000. 
It was the sixth time in seven years a non-American walked off with the championship. It was the 1Oth victory by a for­eign golfer here since Gary Player started the streak in 1978, a streak that includes Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer and Nick Faldo -all of whom won twice -and Sandy Lyle and Ian Woosnam. 

Norman, the Australian who has won a ton of money but has let a slew of major champi­onships slip away from him, could have shaken his label as the shark without the killer instinct. Instead, he closed hor­ribly, shooting 77 in the final round to finish at 292, 13 strokes behind. 
Tom Kite finished fourth at 5­under-par 283. 
Jay Haas, Loren Roberts and Jim McGovern finished at 3­under-par 285. Corey Pavin and Ernie Els were at 286. Ian Baker-Finch of Australia, John Huston and Raymond Floyd fm­ished at 287. Tom Watson was at even par 288. 
In hot, humid conditions, with annoying gusts of the wind that bedeviled the course all week, Olazabal, 28, was every bit the champion he had yet .to prove he was. 
He won the British Amateur and then turned pro in 1985 when he was just 19 years old. Big things were expected, something on the scale of the five major championships won by his countryman, Ballesteros.

Wo01en's tennis beats Tennessee Irish bounce back from losses last week 
By KATE CRISHAM Sports Writer 
The 13th-ranked Notre Dame women's tennis team got back on the winning track this week­end, defeating 29th-ranked Tennessee 6-2 on Sunday. 
Notre Dame was able to bounce back from last weekend's grueling loss­es to #14 Clemson and #1 Georgia. The win improved Notre Dame's

"It was definitely a good match," said head coach Jay Louderback. "We had some tight singles matches. and we won all of them except one." 
The Irish were without the services of senior Lisa Tholen and freshman Erin Gowen, who were injured in the Clemson match. 
"It was good we won after the singles, so we didn't need to use Lisa," said Louderback. "Hopefully, she and Erin will be back before the Indiana match." 
The Irish were led by 13th­ranked Wendy Crabtree, who defeated Paul Juels 6-4, 6-4 at number-one singles. 50th­ranked Holyn Lord defeated Emily Fisher 6-4, 7-5 at num­ber-two singles, while junior Laura Schwab was defeated 5­7, 4-6 by Kristen Bachochin at number-three singles. Senior Christy Faustman pulled out a tough 3-6, 6-2, 6-0 match at number-four singles, while sophomore Sherri Vitale de­feated Tu Mai 6-1, 6-4 at num­ber-five singles.

McDaniel, Miami, Gophers shut down Notre Dame 
Celtics win on road 
Associated Press 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 

Dino Radja had 25 points and 10 rebounds, and Xavier McDaniel scored 13 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter as Boston beat Detroit 116-111 Sunday night. 
The loss was Detroit's fifth straight. 
The Celtics made their first five shots of the second half to take a 68-61 lead. Detroit came back behind two 3-pointers by Joe Dumars, but Radja's inside game helped Boston gain an 88-85 advantage after three quarters. 
McDaniel scored six straight points at the start of the fourth quarter to give Boston a nine­point lead, but Detroit pulled to 110-107 with 2:18 left on two free throws by Terry Mills. 
That's as close as the Pistons got, however. 
Lindsey Hunter scored 22 points for Detroit, while Mills and Cadillac Anderson had 21 each. 
The Celtics scored the first seven points of the game before Detroit came back to tie it at 
13. Detroit took a brief lead in the second period on a pair of 3-pointers by Mills, but Boston rallied to take a 58-54 lead at halftime.

Doubles teams weak point 
By PHIL LANGER Sporu Writer 
The 16th-ranked Notre Dame men's tennis team went 0-2 this weekend as it faced No. 10 Miami and 26th-ranked Minnesota. 
The Irish woes began on Saturday when the Hurricanes took advantage of the strug­gling doubles teams of Notre Dame to win 4-3. It wasn't the first time that the doubles point proved crucial in a Notre Dame match. 
The Irish have had their share of 4-3 losses and all of them simply come down to the fact that the three doubles teams, which were a triple threat early in the season, are presently lacking in the basic fundamen­tals. 
The sole doubles win went to sophomores Mike Sprouse and Jason Pun who defeated Fine and Leisink of Miami 8-4 at No. 2 doubles. 
"We definitely need to keep getting the doubles point," 
Freshman Ryan Simme stat­ed, "It will continue to be the deciding factor in a lot of matches against top teams be­cause our singles line-up is good enough to split with any­one." 

The singles line-up did indeed split, with Sprouse, Pun and senior Todd Wilson all proving victorious. Sprouse defeated Ray Schot 6-3, 7 -5; Wilson beat Tymen Leisink 7-6, 6-4; and Pun defeated Chris Chiang 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. 
The story on Sunday was alto­gether different when Minnesota won 5-2. True, the doubles teams did indeed falter against the strong serve and volley play of the Golden Go­phers, but the singles line-up could only pull off two wins at No. 1 and No. 6 singles. Con­sistent warhorse Jason Pun beat Dam Koen 6-3, 7-6 and fifth-year senior Andy Zurcher pulled off the thrilling three set­ter against Paul Pridmore 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, 6-4. 
The Golden Gophers, the big ten champions, thus finally got their wish and upset the Irish who have kept them out of the NCAA tournament the last three years. Hope when the Go­phers travel to South Bend later this spring for the NCAA tour­nament they will not be as for­tunate. 
Notre Dame head coach Bob Bayliss could only hope for the future as he reflected on the weekend losses. 
"Hopefully this will be a wake-

up call for us and prove to be something positive. I'm really proud of Andy [Zurcher]. He played despite an extremely painful foot. The man respon­sible for that was trainer Jim Ross. 
"Jason Pun was outstanding at No. 6 singles and hopefully his consistency will rub off on his teammates. We know indi­vidually the things we need to do and I think its possible to makeup the ground necessary."

Miller, Graham might not be on fall roster 
By MIKE NORBUT Assistant Sports Editor 
Lou Holtz dropped some 
shocking news at Saturday's 
scrimmage. 
Following the second scrim­mage of spring drills, Notre Dame's coach announced that seniors Mike Miller and Tracy Graham will not be with the Irish for the remainder of spring practice or in the fall. 

"I do not anticipate Michael Miller or Tracy Graham being with us," said Holtz. "I don't want to say anything else. I don't anticipate them repre­senting Notre Dame. They-weren't at practice and I don't anticipate them being at prac­
tice." 

Miller was not in uniform Saturday after suffering a slight injury in Friday's workouts. Graham did dress but did not leave the sidelines. 
"It's a complicated story but it's nothing bad," Miller said. "We're going to have a long talk today and I hope it all gets worked out." 
Prior to spring drills, Miller was penciled in as a starter alongside Derrick Mayes in the Irish receiving corps. Graham had been one of many consid­ered to fill holes in the Irish secondary. 
When asked about the impact of losing the two seniors Holtz showed little remorse. 
"It does nothing," he said. "Takes two names off the depth chart." 
Along with the Miller-Graham story, Holtz expressed concern about the possibility of having the annual Blue-Gold Game. 
"I can't call it off," Holtz said. "I have to get permission from some other people. I don't see how we can have a spring game." 

Many injuries over the week­end contributed to Holtz's spec­ulation that there may not be a spring game in two weeks. Along with the losses of Miller and Graham, the Irish offensive line suffered decimating in­juries. 
While offensive guard Mark Zataveski has missed the past few practices, both offensive tackle Jim Kordas and guard Will Lyell went down with injuries in Saturday's scrim­mage. 
The only quarterback to see playing time in the scrimmage was freshman Tom Krug. Ron Powlus watched, in full pads, from the sidelines. 
The defense continued to show their dominance over the offense in Saturday's scrim­mage. 
Free safety Bobby Taylor and outside linebacker Bert Berry each had an interception off of Krug, while defensive ends Brian Hamilton, Germaine Ilolden, and Alton Maiden, along with linebackers Lyron Cobbins and Jeremy Nau, recorded sacks in the contest. 
The only offensive highlights were a 45-yard touchdown run by tailback Randy Kinder and a 15-yard touchdown pass from Krug to fullback Marc Edwards. 
Friday's practice looked more like a circus than a practice, as coaches of high schools and small colleges from around the nation gathered for a coaches' clinic this weekend. Their presence increased the inten­sity of each drill along with building up the pressure to per­form for each player. 
Kobata perfect for Irish 
By MEGAN McGRATH Sports Writer 
Most pitchers would be satis­fied to throw one no-hitter a weekend. 
When that no-hitter was marred only by one error, any pitcher would be delighted to be that close to perfection. 
Not Notre Dame's Terri Ko­bata. 
The sophomore All-America candidate responded to missing a perfect game Saturday after­noon to Evansville by turning around and tossing a perfecto at Detroit Mercy in the night­cap of a doubleheader. 
Kobata won three out of the Notre Dame softball team's four weekend games in a dominating performance as the Irish opened Midwestern Collegiate Conference play at Detroit. 
On Saturday, Notre Dame easily took two from Evansville 8-1 and 9-0. 
Sunday, they survived a close first game against Detroit Mercy by scoring twice in the top of the eighth to win 3-1, and then went on to triumph 8­0 in the second game. 
"Terri threw the strongest of the season so far," said coach Liz Miller. "She did a better job of working the batters and making them go after bad pitches. She was very strong and had great control." 
Kobata tossed her ninth ca­reer no-hitter in the second Evansville game. The only thing keeping it from being a perfect game was a controver­sial dropped third strike that junior catcher Sara Hayes over threw to first. Kobata struck out six over five innings in that performance. 
Sunday afternoon Kobata won both games of the double­header against Detroit Mercy,

Notre Dame takes four from Xavier 
Offense key to wins 
By JENNY MARTEN Senior Sports Writer 
Sometimes, it's hard for a team to bounce back after being swept by a team like Miami. The team's confi­dence level drops until it can reassert itself by beat­ing up on another team. 
Last week's 5-3 come from behind victory over Toledo wasn't reassuring enough, but the Irish baseball team is ready to roll after domi­nating Xavier in four games this past weekend. 
"We are swinging the ball with confidence. We are baserunning with confi­dence. Our pitchers are 

see IRISH I page 13 
By DYlAN BARMMER Sports Writer 

At the outset of the 1994 season, the concern regarding the Notre Dam·e baseball team seemed to center on solidify­ing a young pitching staff. The squad had lost several quality pitchers, including Chris Michalak, the winningest pitcher in Notre Dame history, and flame-throwing David Sinnes, who owns the school's strikeout record. 
So the question of the day seemed to be, "How will Notre Dame's pitching hold up?" 
The answer may be found in two words: Pat Murphy. 
The Irish head coach is known for his knowledge in all areas of the game, but pitch­ing is certainly his passion. 
Murphy has pitched extensive­ly both in college and in the minor leagues, and he is even in the process of producing an instructional pitching video. 
So it may very well be be­cause of Murphy that names such as Henebry, Schmalz, and Mohs are becoming household names to Irish baseball fans. At the begin­ning of the year, the casual Irish fan may said, "Henebry, Schmalz, and Mohs? Aren't they a law firm?" 
They aren't, but the three freshman pitchers have cer­tainly shown some malicious­ness in prosecuting opposing batsmen this season, as evi­denced in their performance in Notre Dame's sweep of MCC
