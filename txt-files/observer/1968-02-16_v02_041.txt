Sr. Grace Revealed The Merger Secret 
By PAT COLLINS 

Sister Mary Grace remained vocal in spite of the Board's official silence. As we sat in her first floor Le Mans Hall office, the deposed president gave the following account of her dismissal. 
"Mother Olivette called me into her office and said, 'Sr. Mary Grace, the Holy Ghost has finally come. I've decided to appoint Fr. McGrath as presi­dent and get you a job teaching history at the Uni­versity of Lima, Peru.' 
"But I told Mother Olivette that I didn't want to teach at the University of Lima. And she said that she could get me a job studying the growth of women in Latin America. I told her I didn't want to do that, and that I really wasn't qualified for that job since it should be done by a team of sociologists. 
"I see the whole thing as a power struggle. I kept asking Mother Olivette to form the Lay-Religious Board. For, really, that's all this interim board was to do. But Mother Olivette wanted control of the Col­lege. And she's not qualified. She's a missionary nun 
with a nursing degree.... Some of us are made for 
working in the bushes of Africa and some of us are 
made for working in schools. I think Mother Olivette 
has the authority to tell me things like what habit to 
wear. ..but not to tell me how to run the school. 
"The Board thought that it could get me to resign 
and that I wouldn't say anything about it. But I just 
couldn't resign. I had to stand up for St. Mary's ..." 
In this last remark one begins to catch a hint of what Sr. Mary Grace feels is the central issue in her dismissal: merger with the University of Notre Dame. 
On November 29th, shortly after Sister Mary Grace refused to resign from the presidency, she called a 
faculty meeting at_ SMC where she emphasized her administrative ability and even had Dr. Jordan testify to her administrative ability. Dr. Jordan also indicted 
the Holy Cross nuns for lack of professionalism in their dealings with both Sister Mary Grace and him­self. 
Also implicated in the Sister Grace affair was No­tre Dame president Theodore Heshburgh. Both the jobs offered to Sister Mary Grace by Mother Olivette (Lima and South America) were in places in which Father Heshburgh has great influence. 
But when the new board met, they denied the merger implications saying that the matter of merger was never considered. Fr. McGrath also said that there was "no conspiracy" involved. 
Yet, the charges of Sister Mary Grace remain un­
challenged by the SMC leaders and even thougl1 
merger may not have been the reason for which she 
was fired, her remarks did surface a scheme neither 'school wanted out. 
Carter Asks For "Courtesy" 
According to Bruce Carter, 
son of Prof. Henry Carter of the 
Department of Languages, "Pro­
bably every colleRe in the United 
States, except Notre Dame and · 
St. Mary's, has free tuition for 
sons of faculty." 
Carter, a sophomore in the 
College of Arts and Letters, ad­
mits that sons of faculty pay less 
tuition than other students; but 
objects to Notre Dame's proce­
dure of partial repayment. "Free 
tuition, he says, "is a cou'rtesy 
Notre Dame should extend to 
the members of its faculty.'' 
Notre Dame's vice-president 
for Business Affairs, Rev. Jerome 
Wilson, C.S.C., disagrees. "The 
tuition for any boy coming here 
is $1800," he says. "That applies 
es to sons of faculty as well. The 
son of a faculty member however 
"can apply for a grant of $1800 
a year. Then, to keep it for the 
next three years, he has to work 
at a regular student job beginning 
in his sophomore year.'' 
Carter recently lost his own 
grant because he refused to con­
tinue working in the Archives. 
''I'm typing out that Bishop 
Blanc of New Orleans paid twen­
ty piasters for somebody to polish 
a doorknob." The work is what 
he calls "very menial, very tir­
ing." 
But Carter objects less to the type of work than to its reward. Of the $1800 he receives from the university, he has "to work off a little over $200 of it, twelve hours a week, at about 95 cents an hour.'' 
According to Fr. Wilson, "it all depends on how you choose to look at it. The student can say he's working for less than a dol­lar per hour and paying part of his tuition; or he can say that he's making $5 per hour and pay­ing it all.'' 
An attempt to organize the 
"twelve or fifteen" faculty sons 
failed when Carter was unable to 
secure a list of their names from 
Mr. Joseph O'Brien, Director of 
Personnel. Every other faculty 
son Carter has contacted agrees 
with him that "the system is 
really a pain" and that "Twelve 
hours a week is really a lot of my 
time.''

Editor: 
As a witness to the Black Power debate between Dr. Silver and Mr. Ron Karenga, I did feel that Mr. Karenga's comments and attitudes toward the African student were grating to my sense of values, but the booing and catcalling of Mr. Karenga by a 
large number of students, was the ugliest, most frightening in­dictment of latent white preju­
' dice I've ever seen. You didn't understand what he was saying, but in acting like a mob, you illustrated his whole point. Whitey cannot bear to see a black man stand up and say: "Man, I don't buy your set of values; I got my own black values." Thus when Mr. Karenga would not even argue with a brother-African in front of white men, it conflicted too greatly with your European sense of politeness and honesty and you 
 reacted by hooting him off the stage. Feeling sorry for the black­Rhodesian, some of you shout­ed "he's a human being!", which I understand means that despite being black, he has our sense of values. Is not Mr. Karenga a human being too, and deserving of our respect? To respect only those Blacks who have our set of Euro-american values is not even close to Christianity. "Do not even sinners do the same?" 
One more question. Would you have rushed to the defense of the Rhodesian if he had not been Black? That, likewise is an illustration of the reality behind Mr. Karenga's attitudes toward paternalistic white liberals.
