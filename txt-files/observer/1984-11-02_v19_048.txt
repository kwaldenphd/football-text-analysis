David predicts passage of Dry Driving Club resolution 
ByMARYCAROLCREADON 
StaffReporter 
A resolution calling for the forma· tion of a Dry Driving Club will be presented to Student Senate at its Monday meeting, said Cathy David, student body vice president, who is confident the measure will pass. 
A student participating in a Dry Driving Club may receive free coffee or soft drinks at a restaurant or bar, after agreeing to refrain from alco­hol so to drive others in his group home. 
Marquette University instituted such a program this year to help reduce the number of alcohol­related accidents in the Milwaukee area. 
"The resolution \\ill pass easily," said David. "We think it's a great idea, and the recent focus on drunk driving has caused us to take a more responsible look at what we must do . about it. We are all touched by drunk driving. There have already been three bad accident~ this year at school and we can no longer just stand by," she said. 
David and Rob Bertino, student body president, plan to meet with South Bend Mayor Roger Parent soon to discuss plans for starting the club. David said they will be calling on the Five Points taverns to seek sponsorship by Corby's, Kenny and Nickie's, Bridget's and the Com­mons. 
They also hope to have Senior Bar, H.I.'s, Chip's and the Marriott and restaurants such as Azar's and Denny's sponsor the program. 
David said she and Bertino will ex­plain to bar and restaurant owners that the sponsor's fee of S85 to help cover promotional expenses is a "material commitment that they can make to the community against drunk driving." 
David said she believes the Gover­nor's Task Force To Prevent Drunk Driving will be very supportive of the club as will such national organi­zations as Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Students Against Drunk Driving. 
"The administration will probably support the program, too," she said. "It's becoming a real problem with everyone going off campus. The so­cial life has turned." 
Approximately 25,000 deaths result from alcohol-related traffic accidents each year, and among per· sons under the age of 24, drunk driving is the leading cause of death in this country, according to infor­mation David received from Don Todd, dub founder. 
She hopes students will be sup­portive of the club, and she srud she is not worried about people abusing the program since Todd claims no one has abused the system else­where.

With oll prices down to less than S29 a barrel and natural gas prices stabilizing after five years of sharp increases, Americans seem to be losing some of their zeal for conserving en­ergy, according to newly released government figures. A report by the Energy Information Administration says per capita U.S. energy consumption dropped only 2.4 percent in 1983, compared with an­nual declines of 4 percent to 7 percent in the previous three years. The report was issued just as the Organization ofPetroleum Export­ing Countries concluded an emergency meeting in Geneva, Switzer­land, where the cartel made cosmetic cuts in oil production in an effort to prop up their posted price of S29 a barrel against discounts of Sl.50 to S2 discounts offered by many producers. -AP 
Continuing a trendbegun in the 1960s, Americans are becoming less mobile, with the percentage making both short and long moves declining, the Census Bureau reported yesterday.

Twenty years ago, the bureau said, one American in five was changing residences annually. Since then, the number has declined steadily. -AP

The conservative coalition between young and old 
One ofthe most historically significant aspects ofthis election year is the conservative coalition formed be­tween the younger generation and the older genera­tion. The middle-aged generation, a product of the social protests and liberal lifestyles of the 1960 s. have awoken to find themselves outflanked and outnum­bered. 
The conservative character of today's young genera­tion mystifies those middle-aged former-rebels who fought to alter the moral fabric ofour nation. As college students, they protested against the social evils they found embodied in business, politics, and law-reject­ing the status quo and fighting for an ideal world. But 
things  have  changed.  In  our  day college  students

Why?  

It seems today's young generation has been shaped by an environment paralleling that of the 1930s and 40 s -an environment rocked by economic depression, international embarrass­ment, and an unpromising future. Ironically, it seems the social changes wrought by the middle-aged genera­tion itself helped shape this

the 1930s. In 1980 inflation was out of control. The young generation watched as inflation diminished the standard ofliving of American families. 
How would they buy homes with a 21 percent prime interest rate? How would they be able to afford driving cars while at the mercy of high-priced Arab oil? They faced a future without promise. 
The young generation of today also saw the United States internationally embarrassed and helpless. They watched as Iran held America hostage, manipulating 
American leaders, and leaving the U.S. mired in im­potence -an impotence af­firmed by a failed rescue mission.

The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor byJapan, a back­ward island nation, shocked an economically resurgent American nation, and with the fall ofEurope, the United States seemed left to facejapan and Germany alone. Out of this international embarrassment and portending danger rose an angered America. 
By the end of World War II, this generation had reached maturity. It was molded by the hunger and poverty of the Depression, the embarrassment and helplessness of Pearl Harbor, and the terror of world aggression. It is this ger.c:ration, economically insecure and overbearingly indiviualistic, that built the booming economy of the 19S0s and 60 s. 
The recession of the 197u ~. with its rising un­employment, 13 percent inflation, and 21 percent in­terest rates, fostered economic insecurity among young people in much the same way as the Depression had in 
produced for both men and women, and with the break­down offamily life has shaken the young generation. 
The young people of today, hardened by economic despair, by national humiliation, by the threat of war, and by social revolution, have been forced into maturity -prematurely. For the first time in American history a generation faces the prospect of a standard of living less than that of their parents. 
Fueled by their past, young people today are am­bitious and hardworking. They refuse to accept mediocrity. They are people dedicated to insuring themselves of a world that is economically, politically, and socially secure. Young people today have placed their confidence in their own abilities. They are dedi­cated to solving problems and controlling their own destinies. 
The middle-aged generation wonders why college students today do not protest anymore. Well, maybe it's easier to protest for the whales when unemployment is 4 percent. When my generation gets it there again, maybe the protesters will return.

Judicial Council tries to organize 
By BOB MUSSELMAN . 
News Staff 
The Judicial Council spent its weekly meeting last night in the Nieuwland Science Hall doing the same thing it did at the council's last meeting -establishing committees that will function for the rest of the year. 
At the council's last meeting, co­ordinator Bill Bergamo asked mem­bers to sign up for four committees established at the beginning of the year, but few bothered. Poor atten­dance was cited by Bergamo as the main reason for the low response. 
Eighteen members attended yes­terday's meeting, while only ten were present at last week's meeting. 
"If we don't get them organized and going soon, we might as wellbag the whole year," said Bergamo. He said the council needs to "prove to the campus that we are a working body and can get something done." 
Bergamo reminded the council he would be "leaving in December, hopefully," because of graduation. An assitant coordinator, who would succeed him, should be chosen soon so that he or she can "get used to the job before I take off," he said. 
Bergamo said he was preparing an application which would give the applicant some idea of the coordina­tor's job responsibilities, which he said was lacking in the past. He said this year's initial "power conflicts" may have resulted from a misun­derstanding as to what the coordina­tor was actually supposed to do. 
Specifically, he said the coordinator must represent a stu­dent who appears before Associate Vice President for Residence Life John Goldrick when requested to do so. For that reason, the coordinator must "know the rules around here." 
In addition, the coordinator oc­cupies a seat on the Student Senate and the Campus Life Council, and is 
responsible  for  holding  weekly  
meetings  and  overseeing  council  
projects.  

ND to install 8 profs in academic chairs 
Speclal to 1bcObserver 
In 1510, at England's Cambridge 
University, the first endowed profes­
sorship was established. Notre 
Dame did not have one until more 
than 450 years later. 
On Nov. 8, however, Notre Dame 
will install eight professors in 
endowed academic chairs, bringing 
the total number so honored to 32, 
including five persons holding 
chairs as visiting professors. Another 
13 chairs are fully funded with oc· 
cupants being sought. 
The eight chairs and their oc­
cupants to be honored by a banquet, 
preceded by a celebration of Mass, 
are as follows: 
The 
John J. Cavanaugh Professor of Humanities, Frederick Crosson of the Department of Philosophy. 

The 
Frank M. Freimann Professor Physics,John Dow. 

The
John Cardinal O'Hara Profes­sor ofPhilosophy, Ernan McMullin.

The

White Professor ofArts and Letters, Maureen Hallinan ofthe department ofsociology. 
The price tag for endowed profes­sorships has doubled from 1500,000 to II million -over the years, but the attraction for donors has remained strong. Since 196 7 when Notre Dame announced its first endowed professorship, the Universityhas made endowed chairs a cornerstone of faculty develop­ment, and its greatest success came during "The Campaign for Notre Dame" between 1975 and 1981 when 14 endowed professorships were filled and another 15 fully funded. 
Endowed chairs both enhance the academic enterprise and relieve a financial burden. They allow depart­ments either to recruit outside scholars preeminent in their field or to recognize the highest level of scholarship and teaching among their own faculty. (OfNotre Dame's 27 chairs with permanent appoint­ments, 1 7 candidates came from without the University and 10 were promoted from inside.) And be­cause endowed professorships are supported not from operating monies but from invested funds, they remove some of the most ex­pensive senior faculty positions from dependence on income such as tuition and tie them to appreciating 
funds.

Doctors to search for human heart 
! 
if baboon heart fails in Baby Fae 

Associated Press 
LOMA UNDA, Calif. -Baby Fae was "doing great" yesterday as she neared the end ofher first week with a baboon's heart, while doctors said if she eventually rejects the organ, they will seek a human heart before another baboon donor. 
The 3-week-old, who received the controversial and historic transplant last Friday to replace her fatally un­derdeveloped heart, was in serious but stable condition yesterday, said spokesman Dick Weismeyer. 
She was "sucking on a pacifier, moving around, very active," he said. "She slept good (and) had pain medication only once during the night, and (there were) no signs of rejection." 
Baby Fae is the world's longest-lived survivor of an animal-to­human heart transplant, having surpassed the previous three and a half day record ofa South African ac­countant who received a transplanted chimp's heart. 
With Baby Fae showing no "ominous" signs ofrejection, "we're hoping things w~ll move very smoothly through this period," said Dr. David Hinshaw, a surgeon. 
Ifsigns of rejection develop, doc­tors will increase Fae's dosage of cyclosporine, an anti-rejection drug, Hinshaw said, noting that another transplant would be considered only if rejection cannot be con­trolled. 
Although obtaining a human donor would be difficult, "we would make every effort to seek such a heart," and would only use another baboon heart if a human heart was unavailable, Hinshaw said. 
Asked if Baby Fae's parents have consented to a second transplant of any kind, he replied: "I don't know whether they've been asked that." 
,Meanwhile, pediatrics chairman o~· David Mace said some news or­ganizations have tried offering money to Lorna Linda University Medical Center workers to learn the identities of Baby Fae and her par­ents, who have insisted on anonymity for themselves and the child. 
Mace said he understood that the National Enquirer had offered S10,000 for the information, but the tabloid's editor, lain Calder, denied the offer had been made. 
Curfew imposed in Franklin, Tenn. 
Associated Press 
FRANKUN, Tenn. -Authorities declared a state of emergency yes­terday after a Halloween night of es­calating violence between blacks and whites injured nine people, one ofthem seriously. 
Officials imposed a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and assigned 55 officers from town, state and county law enforce­ment agencies to patrol the streets during those hours. Normally, only 12 officers are on duty then. 
A series of shootings and beatings spanned a 3-hour period Wednesday night within a 12-square-block area of downtown in this Nashville sub­urb dotted with Victorian-style homes, antique stores and brick walkways. · 
Police said the violence was sparked when a .16-gauge shotgun was fired from a car into a crowd of people outside a black nightspot at about 11 p.m. Wednesday. 
Four blacks were injured in the shooting. In apparent retaliation a short time later, police said, two white men were shot, two others beaten and one man, Donald Donoho, was pulled from his car and beaten with bricks and rocks when he drove through a predominantly black section oftown. 
Donoho was listed in guarded condition with head injuries at a Nashville hospital. 
Police arrested two white teenagers, Dirk Pewitt, 18, and Usa Palmer, 19, who they said were in the car from which the initial shots were fired, and two white juveniles who were not identified. 
Pewitt was booked on four counts of assault with intent to murder and held on 150,000 bond. Palmer and the two juveniles were booked on accessory charges. She was held on S10,000 bond and the juveniles were released to their parents' cus­tody. 
Police arrested three other people on weapons charges. 
Franklin, with a population of about 13,000 people, is about 1 5 miles from Nashville. Police Chief Dave Lewis said it is "a calm, quiet town."

Bmgioli said the students' support of the freeze places them in agree­ment "with Walter Mondale's posi­tion on the issue. This indicates to me Notre Dame students are sup­porting Ronald Reagan on the basis of something other than the major issue of our time." 
Of the voters, 55.8 percent favor the administration's overall foreign policy with 43 percent opposed, which Healy called "pretty good numbers." 
Healy did question the objectivity of the referendum's wording. "The referendum didn't have anything about Reagan's ecomonic pro­grams" which he said a big majority agree with. Healy also said the ques­tion on weapons in space should have clarified the weapons as defen­sive. 
The students supported by 89.7 percent to 7.9 percent putting con­trols on emissions to limit acid rain. 
Many of the voting percentages did not add up to 100 percent be­cause some students voted for write­in candidates and abstained on particular issues. 
In the final days of the campaign, Brogioli said he will be in Michigan campaigning for Mondale where polls indicate Mondale has a chance for victory. 
Healy predicted Indiana will be the first of 50 states to re-elect Reagan with Minnesota as a toss-up. 
Ebsen, who played millionaire hillbilly Jed Clampett on the long­running program, has recorded a radio spot for Kulp's opponent, Re­publican Rep. Bud Shuster. It was broadcast for the first time this week. 
"He's not the kindly oldJed Clam­pett you saw on the show," Kulp, a Democrat, said yesterday. "I've worked so hard on this campaign. It's none of his business and he should have stayed out of it." 
Ebsen says in the commercial that Kulp, who played zany secretary Jane Hathaway, is "too liberal."

Soviet press suggests U.S. involvement in Gandhi's death 

Assocated Press 
MOSCOW -The Soviet press yes­terday indirectly linked the United States to the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, saying the slaying was inspired by those who "preach gangsterism in rela­tions between states." 
Official comment on the slaying Wednesday in New Delhi stopped short of directly stating that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had en­gineered the killing. 
But stories on the state-controlled radio, in newspapers and by the offi­cial news agency Tass reported Mrs. Gandhi's assassination in connec­tion with charges that the United States conducts a policy of "state­sponsored terrorism." 
The reports blamed the killing on "India's opponents abroad," and accused the CIA of supporting Sikh separatists in an alleged effort to overthrow the New Delhi govern­ment. Mrs. Gandhi was shot to death by Sikh members of her own secur­ity detail. 
In Washington, the State Depart­ment said it was formally protesting what it called Soviet attempts to link 
the United States to the assassina­tion. 
"We strongly resent the Soviet al­legations that the United States, and specifically the CIA, were involved in, or inspired, this act of political terrorism," said spokesman Alan Romberg. 
"We reject in the strongest possi­ble terms the outrageous Soviet aile­gations. They are absurd and irresponsible," he said. 
The most strongly worded sug­gestions linking the CIA to the slaying came from the state-run Radio Moscow in English-language broadcasts. 
The "gangsterism" phrasing is fre­quently used in attacks on the United States.

Thousands of Poles mourn slain pro-Solidarity priest 


WARSAW, Poland -Thousands of Poles mourned a slain pro-Solidarity priest at his Warsaw church yester­day, and a group of Solidarity ac­tivists from Gdansk called a one-hour strike on Saturday to protest his kidnap and murder. 
After first announcing that the priest, Jerzy Popieluszko, would be buried on Saturday in a Warsaw cemetery, church officials said he would be laid to rest instead at St. Stanislaw Kostka Church, where he had served. 
Popieluszko's coffin was to be brought to the church today to rest on the altar until the funeral, church officials said. 
The body of Popieluszko, 37, was pulled from a reservoir .in northern Poland Tuesday, 11 days after he was abducted Oct. 19. Three secret

The St. Stanislaw Kostka Church fence was ringed by thousands of burning candles and covered with flowers yesterday, All Saints' Day, a holiday in this predominantly Roman Catholic country. 
The primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, visited Popieluszko's gravesite with church officials fol­lowing a midday Mass at which he called Popieluszko an apostle of peace. 
"We should remember that Christ's call that 'blessed with a clean heart is one who makes peace and who suffers for justice' fits so well to the late Father Jerzy Popieluszko, who is dear to our 
Lech Walesa hearts," the primate said.

Notre Dame's 'home-away-from home' has been Meadowlands: good to Irish, who have outscored foes, 126-10, there 
By THERON ROBERTS 
Sports Writer 
There is no place like home, except ifyou happen to be 
the Notre Dame football team. Then, you could say there is 
no place like Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands complex 
in East Rutherford, NewJersey. 
Notre Dame's home-away-from-home serves as the "home" game for many of the Irish subway alumni and Eastern fans. Ofthe over 70,000 spectators expected to come close to filling Giants Stadium on Saturday, many promise to be supporting the Irish. 
Notre Dame has been quite successful playing at the New Jersey complex, with a better won-loss percentage for games played there than even on the familiar turfof Notre Dame Stadium. On the four occasions the Irish have played at the Meadowlands, the opponents have fallen to defeat every time. Maybe the competition from the two service academies, namely Navy and Army, has not been keen, but the record speaks for itself. 
"Notre Dame has played the best of its games there," says Irish head coach Gerry Faust. "But I don't think you can judge other teams by that (the fact that the Irish are unbeaten at Giants Stadium). This Navy team is a good team -they can put points on the board. They will be looking to score, and they are potent offensively." 
Potent offenses are one thing that Notre Dame has not encountered at the Meadowlands. In the four meetings, Army and Navy have managed only ten points, while the Irish have tallied 126. "We've had good success playing in Giants Stadium before," Faust says, "partly because there are bound to be a good number of Notre Dame fans there. But, other than that, it's just like playing at any other place." 
That statement by the Notre Dame coach may be refuted, however. Giants Stadium has artificial turf, a surface on which the Irish have been effective -especially Faust-
coached teams. In the ten games Notre Dame has played on 
carpet since the I98I season, it has posted a 7-2-1 record. 
Success at the Meadowlands has also been effective in 
helping past Notre Dame teams get back on track after 
struggling through the early part of a season. In I977, the 
Irish defense rose to form to hold the Cadets from Army 
scoreless, as Notre Dame outscored its opponent by more 
than ten points for the first time in the season, 24-0. 
Following that game, ·the team established itselfas a 
contender for the national championship. 
After suffering two straight dismal performances against Arizona and Oregon in I982, the Notre Dame offense needed a shot in the arm, and got it in the form of an Irish victory over the Middies at the Meadowlands. Although Navy had more success than usual against Notre Dame, the Midshipmen still scored only ten points. But those ten points in the 27-10 Notre Dame victory have been the only points put on the board against the Irish at Giants Stadium. 
The points were not rightfully earned, however. Navy scored its touchdown against Notre Dame's second defensive unit. The Midshipmen could not move the ball against the Irish first-team defenders, who picked offsix Tom Tarquinio passes and held the Navy rushing offense to 73 yards. 
"I don't think that the teams go into the games there with the idea of not trying to win," Navy head coach Gary Tranquill states. "I think that Notre Dame has a few better players." 
In the lastest Irish showdown at the Meadowlands, Notre Dame definitely had the talent advantage, destroying Army, 42-0. The contest last season was over just after it started, with Notre Dame exploding for 21 quick first-quarter points before the Cadets had a chance to catch their breath. 
It was the third-straight victory for the Irish, with all of those wins coming on the road. "It's good to regain confidence in ourselves like we have," said a contented Faust after the victory. "Playing in a place like this is almost like being home, and that helped us, too." Momentum after that game was to be short-lived, however, as, two victories later, Notre Dame resumed its recent end-of-season demise with three losses. 
For the Devine-coached Irish of 1980, momentum was not only short-lived, but ended after a 33-0 victory over Navy at the Meadowlands, when Georgia Tech tied the heavily-favored Irish, 3-3. 
Jim Stone ran for 21 1 yards in the Navy game, continuing the success ofNotre Dame running backs in rushing on the artificial turf at Giants Stadium. Jerome Heavens began the tradition by carrying the ball 34 times for 200 yards in 1977. Allen Pinkett has been responsible for some pretty impressive numbers in the last two Notre Dame games at the· Meadowlands. He rushed for I32 yards last season against Army, and had 129 yards in 1982 against Navy as a freshman, while filling in for the injured Phil Carter. 
The possibility ofanother good showing by the Irish in their New Jersey stomping ground was heightened by the I.SU win last week. The team now has a chance to build its momentum as Notre Dame teams have in the past when playing in Giants Stadium, and could have a good head of steam when it begins to prepare for the Penn State game which is two weeks away. 
"I hope our team isn't going to be looking to far ahead," warns Faust. "The men at the service academies don't know what the word 'quit' is. They are playing good football and are on an upswing."· 
The Naval Academy has had good success in playing the good teams close, that is, except for Notre Dame, which has beaten the Midshipmen in 20 consecutive games. Combine this dominance with the Notre Dame success at the Meadowlands, and it would appear that the "home" crowd may see the Irish go back above .500 for the season.

Joe Howard 
Senior shows that big not always best 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
The cliche that "good things come in small packages" has certainly seen its share of use. But, in certain situa­tions, its use is very appropriate. And anyone who knows anything about Notre Dame football would have to agree about the value of Notre Dame's own "Small Wonder," Joe Howard. 
Since his first starting role against Navy in the seventh game of 1981, Howard has been an integral part of the Irish football squad. And, as oflast season, he even turned in the football cleats and donned basketball shoes to put his talents to work for the Irish basketball team. 
But, after seeing Howard perform over the years, it may come as a surprise to hear that he almost wasn't offered a scholarship at Notre Dame. "I was the last freshman recruit to receive a scholarship," says the S-9, 171-pound senior. "Most recruits receive their offer when they visit the school. It was not until the day before the signing date that (former) Coach (Greg) Blache came to my house and told me that Notre Dame had a scholarship for me. I think they looked at my size as a handicap. but I really believe that in sports a lot dt:pends on how much heart and determination a person has, not their size." 
Howard has certainly proven that by being small in stature, one can still stand tall on the platform ofsuccess. But, although he has accomplished many things during his football career, results are not nearly as important to him as simply having had the chance to play. "Success is not winning or losing," states the Clinton, Md., native. "For me, it's being happy with what I've had the opportunity to accomplish and knowing that when I leave, I will have left a part of me here." 
A big part of Howard certainly will be left behind. Few can forget his 96-yard touchdown reception from Blair Kid against Georgia Tech in 1981, the longest pass in Notre Dame history. Then, in 1982, there was the flea flicker in the 31-16 upset of then-No. 1 Pittsburgh. Howard pulled in Kid's 54-yard toss for a touchdown on the play. In 1983, Howard had a 67-yard reception against Air Force which ranked as the longest completion ofthe season. 
But, despite all ofthese memorable accomplishments, one other moment stands out even more in Howard's mind. "When I returned the kickoff 56 yards against USC my freshman year, it meant a lot to me," he says. "It really got me going. Up until then I hadn't played the way I knew I could. I was the smallest guy and was a bit

season, but the long-dormant rushing attack is finally starting to 
get on track. 
The Irish have abandoned the !-formation in favor ofthe 
double-tight end, single-back formation. This new alignment has 
provided tight end Ricky Gray with more playing time, and the 
senior responded by catching four passes for 3 5 yards last week. 
"We're forcing defenses to play us honestly," says Faust, "because we're not having to depend on the strong side of the line when we use a double-tight end set. We simply had not been running the football very effectively, and the changes have paid off." The changes paid off in a big way against LSU as ND rushed for 202 yards against a defense that had allowed only 
90.4 yards per game on the ground in its five previous games. 
Tailback Allen Pinkett had his best game ofthe season last week, picking up 162 yards on a school record-tying 40 carries, and scoring two touchdowns. Pinkett raised his season numbers to 653 yards rushing on 177 carries (3.7-yard average) and 10 TD's. Seniors Chris Smith ( 44 carries for 179 yards, 4.1-yard average) and Mark Brooks ( 26 rushes for 100 yards and a 3.8-yard average with three ID's) continue to split time at the fullback spot. 
Despite their recent success on the ground, the Irish figure to match Navy's passing attack with an aerial show of their own. Quarterback Steve Beuerlein has completed 98 of 158 passes this season (62 percent), a pace that would set a school record for completion percentage. Beuerlein has thrown for six touchdowns so far this season, but has made some costly mistakes -namely 12 interceptions. Nonetheless, he is 17th in the NCAA quarterback rankings, with a 129.7 rating. 
Irish flanker Milt Jackson, who has 22 catches for 275 yards and four touchdowns this season, will most likely miss the game with a bruised collarbone suffered against LSU. Withjackson out, Beuerlein will throw primarily to senior split endJoe Howard, freshman split end Tim Brown ( 18 catches for 202 yards), and senior tight end Mark Bavaro ( 2 5 receptions for 288 yards and one touchdown). Pinkett, who has caught 15 passes for 177 yards and one touchdown, will be another ofBeuerlein's favorite targets. 
The Navy defense has been very generous to opposing offenses this season, giving up 368 yards per game. Leading the Midshipmen on defense will be linebacker Mike Taylor ( 62 tackles), safety Marc Firlie (54 stops and three interceptions), and linebackerJim Dwyer ( 39 tackles). Tackle Eric Rutherford leads the defensive front with nine tackles for lost yardage. 
intimidated by all the veterans. After that run, though, I felt like I fit right in." 
In his first start the following weekend against Navy, Howard made everyone aware ofhis newly-found confidence. In that game three seasons ago, Howard pulled in five receptions for 1 1 5 yards, including one for a 52-yard touchdown. He also scored a touchdown on the ground as he ran the last leg ofa reverse into the end zone. 
In the two following years against Navy, Howard also had some noteworthy successes. He started all games in 1982 except the Navy contest, but he still made his appearance felt as he came off the bench, making three catches for SO yards despite nursing a thigh injury. In last season's game at Notre Dame Stadium, Howard ran four end-around plays. The longest went for 30 yards on the first play of the game. That same afternoon he demon­strated his throwing ability as he connected with Milt jackson for a 29-yard touchdown. 
Heading into this season, Howard ranked fifth on the all-time Notre Dame receiving chart with 72 receptions for 1,451 yards and seven touchdowns. Through the first eight games, he has pulled in eight receptions for 128 yards. Although he has never led the squad in receptions in any ofhis three seasons, his career average per reception stood at 20.5 yards coming into this campaign, best among the current receivers and second-best in Irish history. 
Howard has also served as a kickoff and punt returner. Entering the 1984 season, he averaged 23.3 yards per kickoff return and 6.9 yards per punt return. This year he has returned one kickoff for 17 yards and seven punts for a 9.9-yard average. His 24-yard punt return against South Carolina has been the longest for the team this year. 
Making catches and returning kickoffs and punts makes Howard a very visible figure on the field. But even when he isn't directly involved with a play, he takes great pride in performing his assigned duties. "Making good blocks or being in the right place are important to a team," he says. "When I do what I'm supposed to and we score, it makes me feel good. I like to make sure that I do the little things even though a lot ofpeople don't always notice." 
When Howard showed up on the basketball court a week after the Liberty Bowl, a lot ofpeople certainly noticed. His 14-point debut performance against Holy Cross was hardly a little thing and it quickly made everyone aware ofhis presence. He was one ofjust four Division I athletes playing both football and basketball in '83-'84. 
   Middies 
Only once this season have the Midshipmen surrendered less than two touchdowns in a game, and the Irish offense should be able to put plenty ofpoints up on the board, as long as it avoids turnovers. 
The kicking games and specialty teams: 
Saturday's game will feature two of the nation's outstanding placekickers in Navy's Todd Solomon and Notre Dame'sJohn Carney. Solomon, a junior, has been successful on 12 of 15 field-goal attempts, including a long of 52 yards against Princeton which set a Navy record. He has also hit on 13 of 14 extra points. Carney has been just as consistent, converting 1 1 of 12 field-goal attempts, the longest being a 48-yarder against South Carolina. The obvious conclusion is that both ofthese teams are tough to keep off the scoreboard so it is not surprising that neither team has been shut out this season. 
Punter Mike Viracola continues to be a pleasant surprise for the Irish this season. In eight games he has punted 32 times for 41-yard average, and has been effective at pinning the opposi­tion inside its own 20-yard line. Navy's Mark Colby has punted 34 times for a 39-yard average. 
Notre Dame's return teams have been impressive all season. The Irish rank 26th in the nation in kickoff returns with a 21-yard average, while Howard has been the best punt-return man with a 1 0-yard average, including a long of24 yards. Navy's Eric Wallace, a senior defensive back, has been an elusive return man with a kickoff-return average of 3 7 yards, including a 97-yard TD runback. Wallace also averages 11 yards per punt return, with a long of 32 yards. 
The keys to the pme: 
Notre Dame should have few problems winning this game, provided it sets the proper tone in the early going. The Irish have the advantage in personnel, but Navy is a big-play team, so the pressure falls on Notre Dame's defense. The Irish must stop the Navy passing game early and take charge ofthe game defensively. IfNO's defense can shut down the Midshipmen, it will take a lot ofpressure off the Irish offense. 
Offensively, Notre Dame's line needs to get offthe ball quickly in order to establish the running game. Look for the Irish to run early, and then pass when the offense gets estab­lished. Notre Dame has the size on the offensive front, but it needs to show some speed as well. Ifthey do, it can put some big numbers on the scoreboard. 
Joe Howard 

"Coming out ofhigh school I was recruited more for basketball than football," says the point guard who averaged 5.5 points per game in his 23 appearances. "I had to make a decision between the two and it was kind ofhard for me. But in the long run, I felt there were more smaller guys getting into football than into basketball. 
"When I was given the opportunity to play here, I felt like a kid with a new toy. I missed playing basketball so it was a great feeling to get out again, especially to play for the school. I had played at the 'Rock' (Rockne Memorial gymnasium) but it wasn't the same." 
Being a small man on the basketball floor, Howard relies on quickness and on an especially keen ability to set up plays. His 76 assists was second highest on the team. "Everybody got more alert when I was out there," he says. "I hit people all over the place until they got used to me. Unless they were wide-open, they weren't expecting the ball. It was hard at first, but they adjusted well." 
Howard says his teammates' help and acceptance played a big role in his being able to contribute. "Everyone was so helpful. They took me in and helped me to learn the plays and the basics of Coach Phelps' system." Being honored as the team's most inspirational player gives some idea of the respect his teammates have for him. 
As far as this coming season is concerned, ''I'm just trying to get

through football," Howard says. "I would like to play, but I'm not 
going to say right now." 
As a senior this year, Howard hopes that he has been an exemplary leader for his teammates. "I'm not a real 'rah-rah' type leader," he says. "I lead more by example. I always try to give 1 10 percent, because ifI don't, it will look bad for theyounger guys. I want them to see that it's important to always give your best." 
Despite the lack ofgreat team success over his years here at Notre Dame, Howard is impressed with how head coach Gerry Faust has handled the situation. "Seeing how he is always so p.>sitive is a big help for me," he says. "He never quits on us. He is aJways behind us. He has handled pressure from so many people better than most ofus can from just one person." 
Whether he makes it into the pro ranks or not, Howard hopes, one day, to pass on to others his keys to success. 
"My major is sociology and I'd like to give'back to society what it has given to me," he says. "There are a lot ofkids who think they can make it through life on sports alone and that's the wrong idea. I'd like to help make sure that ifkids want to go to college and play football and other sports, that they realize they must keep their priorities straight." 
A lot of what makes Joe Howard successful isJoe Howard himself. He may be small physically, but his attitude makes his potential limitless. "A lot ofpeople think that football and basketball are not for small guys, but I don't believe that," he says. "I can do anything I want to so and I try to prove it. IfI can't do something, I'll be the first to admit it, but not before I try it first."

The Kicking Game 
Carney and Viracola have been pleasant surprises as they handle chores steadily 
ByJOE BRUNETII 
Sports Writer 
No one will contest the fact that the 1984 season has 
been a bumpy road for the Notre Dame football team, but a 
kicking game that entered the season as a big question mark 
has seen only smooth sailing since the season began. 
The kicking duties, for which sophomore kickerJohn Carney and senior punter Mike Viracola were responsible, was an area that was suspect coming into this season, not because the players lacked the ability to do the job, but because Carney and Viracola had been virtually untested in a game situation. Carney handled the kickoffduties as a freshman last year, but he never attempted a field goal or a PAT during the 1983 campaign. Viracola was also essen­tially untested in the punting department, attempting just four punts last season. 
However, any doubts have now been squelched, and head coach Gerry Faust has called the kicking game a "pleasant surprise." 
Carney came to Notre Dame as an "invite-on" who had been recruited for his punting, not his placekicking, because the coaching staffhad told him that the kicking duties.were wrapped up by Mike Johnston. During the preseason practices, thoug..;, the business major earned the kickoffduties because ofhis ability to hit the ball deep into the end zone. What followed was an outstanding perfor­mance as he hit 43 ofhis 59 kickoffs into the end zone, allowing only 25 ofhis kicks to be returned. His excep­tional performance earned him a monogram, but not a scholarship. 
"Some people expected that I would get a scholarship (after last year), but after talking to the coaches I under­stood the situation," comments the Cardinal Newman High (West Palm Beach, Fla.) graduate. "They said I had to do the full job of kicking. You don't give someone a scholar­ship for kickoffs because it isn't really a major part ofthe 

John Carney N D placekicker 
game. The deal was that if 1did well my freshman year I would be eligible for a scholarship, but that I had to win the starting kicking job to get it." 
After winning the starting job this year, Carney was granted his scholarship one week prior to the Purdue game. No one can complain that he isn't worth it after only missing one field goal this year. The sophomore has hit on 11 of 12 field goals with his only miss coming against South Carolina from 39 yards. He is also an impressive 6-of-6 from the 40-to 49-yard range. 
"I'm pretty satisfied with my performance," says the soft-spoken Ohio resident. "Everybody hates to miss. So far we've had very consistent holds and snaps by Mike Viracola and Kevin Kelly and the blocking has been great. Every­thing has just been going smoothly, and I think everyone involved in the kicking game is pretty excited about how things are going." 
The starting job was not handed to Carney after last year's performance. He and Pat Chura were involved in an 
intense kicking duel during last year's spring drills and this 
year's preseason. Carney feels that this intense competition 
has definitely helped his performance. 
"The competition between Pat and me has helped my 
kicking game tremendously," says Carney. "Pat's best 
attribute is his consistency and he showed me that last 
spring. That's one ofthe things that pushed me all through 
the summer to work hard so that I could get to a position 
where I was consistent enough to compete with him. He's a 
helluva kicker. He is one ofthe reasons I am doing 
somewhat sqccessful now. I think that he could start at any 
NCAA college around the country." 
When preparing for a field goal, Carney tries not to let 
outside factors affect him, and he tries to concentrate on 
certain things when preparing for the kick. "You can't let 
outside factors bother you as far as thinking 'this is a 
needed three points' or 'this will win the game' or 'we need 
this to get our momentum going.' None of those factors 
help put the ball through the uprights," says Carney. "The 
thing that helps put the ball through the uprights is keeping 
your head down and really concentrating on what you are 
doing. 
"I try to recite in my head to bend and to keep my head 
down," continues the Dillon resident. "These are some of 
the things I do when I kick fairly decently. I didn't do them 
when I missed the field goal against South Carolina. I just 
went through the motions and didn't really get into the ball 
and bend." 
Besides attributing some ofhis success to Chura, the humble sophomore also gives last year's kicker Mike Johnston a lot ofcredit. "Last year I called him (Johnston) the silent teacher because he doesn't talk a lot when he is kicking or practicing," says Carney. "Just to watch him I learned a lot. His concentration is really intense and he is really smooth. It can be the first or the 50th kick of the day and he has the same amount of concentration amd the same swing of his leg." 
 
Carney's kicking partner, Viracola, is in his fifth year at 
Notre Dame and his first year in the MBA school. He 
entered Notre Dame both as a punter and a wide receiver, 
but a torn groin muscle in the early stages ofhis freshman 
season kept him out ofaction for both his first and second 
seasons under the Dome. 
"The injury affected me both mentally and physically, and as a sophomore it still bothered me mentally," explains Viracola. "I had two doctors tell me that I would never kick again. That combined with the fact that I was a walk-on made it difficult to come back. So I went to a kicking specialist and he helped get my confidence back up.'' 
Prior to Viracola's junior year he was told he wasn't going to make the travelling squad, but he did, in fact, suit up for every game and served as Blair Kiel's backup for the season. Heading into his senior season, the coaching staff told him that he would eventually take over Kiel's punting duties becasue they wanted Kid to concentrate on only playing quarterback. But, after Steve Beuerlein beat out Kid for the quarterback spot at the M1ami game, the coaches didn't want their captain sitting on the bench. Once again, Viracola was relegated to the backup role. 
After not receiving a scholarship in either his junior or senior year, Viracola was disappointed. "I thought that I should have had the scholarship definitely my senior year, if not my junior year, because I was the back-up, I travelled when I was told I wouldn't travel, and I was there in case anything happened to Kid." 
After the end ofhis senior season last year, the coaching stafftried to entice Viracola to stay an extra year and use his last year ofeligibility by giving him a scholarship. He accepted. "I was planning on going to MBA or Law School anyway," he explains. "When the scholarship v."a5 oJfered to me I decided to go ahead and take it because I could go to MBA school and it would be paid for." 
The scholarship was a major motivating factor in Viracola's decision to complete his last year of eligibility, but the Texas resident was also driven by his desire to prove himself. "A real motivating factor for me to come back was that I had a lot to prove not only to myself, but also to a lot ofpeople," comments Viracola. "IfI hadn't had the chance to come back I would have never known ifI could do it. I would have felt inside that I could have, but I never would have been able to say that I did. 
"I would have rather taken the chance ofhaving a lousy year and saying that I wasn't cut out to do the job than not to do it at all. I have proven what I set out to prove to myselfand to others." 
Coming into this year Viracola had only punted four times for a 34-yard average, and had not really proven himself to the coaching staffand earned its confidence, so he worked extensively on his consistency. "The coaches had never seen me under fire so I had a lot to prove to them so that they would relax. You can't have the coaches wondering what kind ofkick you are going to have every time," he says. "Ifl kick the ball 40 or 45 yards then I have done my job. That's something that I have accomplished excegr for the setback in the Miami game. I didn't like 

Mike Viracola ND punter 
averaging only 35 yards but that's something you have to live with. 
As I see it, that's my fumble or interception for the year, and I just 
had to bounce back and not let it affect me." 
If the coaching sta1I had any doubts about Viracola's punting 
ability, those doubts surely have been removed by now. The 
185-pounder has a 40.9-yard average through the first eight games 
of this season. Ifit weren't for the Miami game, he would be 
averaging almost 46 yards per kick. 
Although Viracola boasts an impressive average he does not 
worry about his average. His main concern is his contribution to 
the team. "I've set out to do what I wanted to do and that's to help 
the team," he explains. "If I start worrying about my average, then I 
get away from my original responsibility to the team, and that's 
when you mess up your concentration and then you get the 10­
and 15-yarders." 
Viracola also has the responsibility ofholding the ball for Carney, which he enjoys because it gives him an added chance to contribute. "The holding is something I enjoy doing and it is something that is key to the team," says Vira~ola. "If the holder doesn't get the ball down, the kicker doesn't do well. Ifl can make John relax so he doesn't have to worry about the ball getting on the tee, then he can just concentrate on his kicking. I'm helping him out which is essentially helping the team out." 
There is no mistaking the fact that the Irish kicking game has helped the team out much more than most people thought.

Life after Carter-Mondale has been good 
As a Ut:mocrat, I know the Carter-Mondale team gave a lot to America: five economic pro­grams, 12.4 precent inflation, 21.5 percent prime rates and 7.5 percent unemployment. When these two economic wizards left us, everything was rising, except our national 
Joseph Murphy 
here I stand 
sptrtt (and the growth of real per capita 
income which was a negative .6 of on-e per­
cent). 
Today, the lesser half of that team is back 
carrying the same inflated political football for 
big goverment. Vice President Mondale il­
lustrates the danger of playing football with­
out a helmet -he has become the Dizzy 
Warrior. 
Mr. Vice President, if you have the answers to pur nation's problems, why in your four year huddle with Jimmy Carter did you not give him any? 
You claim you are not now the same man you were under Carter, that you have matured and are ready to be our quarterback; however, you are today following the Carter-Mondale game plan. 
In 1984, you continue to talk offairness and compassion, but what is so fair and compas­sionate about double-digit inflation, rising in­terest rates and rising unemployment which your five ecomonic programs brought us? 
Vice President Mondale, inflation hurts those on a fixed income the most-the elderly, the poor and the minorities. A president must know this and prevent inflation from occur­ring. President Reagan does and has. 
You say the Reagan recovery has been built on record deficits; however, over the last 20 years you democrats have amassed a trillion dollar deficit for America, and all you brought us was economic chaos. 
Mr. Vice President, your new realism of 
1984 means higher taxes in 1985. These taxes 
would end the Reagan relief, and return us to a 
more equal society -one where everyone is 
poor and unemployed. 
To quote President John F. Kennedy: "An 
economy hampered by restrictive tax rates 
will never produce enough revenue to bal­
ance the budget -just as it will never produce 
enough jobs or enough profits. In short, it is 
the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too 
high today and tax revenues are too low -and 
the soundest way to raise revenues in the long 
run is to cut rates now." You've obviously 
been listening to the wrong Kennedy, Mr. 
Vice President. 
In our hearts we know your wrong. If 
Reagan's economic program has been unfair 
to some -your many have been unfair to all. 
You told the poor to help themselves, and they did -to our wallets. President Reagan is helping the poor help themselves, but not at the expense of working men and women. In­stead of just expanding the welfare system, the President has expanded the economic sys­tem. 
By creating six million new jobs in the last 21 months, President Reagan has provided the poor with an opportunity no amount of gov­ernment handouts possiblely could. Vice President Mondale, your intentions may have been good, but your impact sacked the Ameri­can people. 
After your loss, you'll probably be able to find a job (hopefully. not in government) thanks to Reagan's flourishing recovery. 
In foreign affairs though, you'll get the American team rolling · problem is we'll land in the wrong endzone. Under Carter, you ex­perienced it all: the Russian invasion of Af­ghanistan, the failure of your own democratic senate to ratify the SALT II Treaty, the fall of pro-American regimes in Iran and Nicaragua to anti-American forces. 
Mr. Vice President, you proudly say you have been involved in every arms limitation treaty since you came to Washington. Then you should know, as every president and even most senators (especially the late Scoop Jack­son) know, the Soviets have violated many provisions ofyour agreements. 
You complain of CIA booklets in Nicaragua, but had you acted to save the Somoza regime there would be no need for covert aid to over­throw the Marxist-Leninists now in control. 
President Reagan sees The Bear and knows its power. Thanks to the President, El Salvador has not become another communist country like your Nicaragua. Supporting Notre Dame graduate President Duarte of El Salvador, Ronald Reagan's economic and military aid have given Duarte the time to create a climate for peace. Today negotiations between the rebels and Duarte are underway. Human rights are improving rapidly. That is a fact, and a president must know this. 
The Bear has attacked our Pope, holds the Pope's homeland hostage and has struck down a civilian aircraft. A president must grasp the reality of these actions. 
Though we did not build the Berlin Wall, we can help tear it down. Peace through Strength is our motto since your peace through weakness failed to keep the Bear in his territory. We're gradually putting the Rus­sians back in their cage. 
Mr. Vice President, I could go on about President Reagan's successes, but Tbe Obseroer has a limit on "space" (just like you do). 
As I write, the pages of history are being written on the fall of your liberalism. The Carter-Mondale administration was its last chapter, and your 1984 campaign its final footnote. 
Your own teammates (such as Hart and Hol­lings) tried to take the ball from you, but you had a big blocker (Tip O'Neill). Your game plan was not to pick up the ball and run up the field with it· but break left. 
You should have quit while you were be­hind. When you left in 1980, the fans were just booing, now they're going to throw you out of the stadium. We give you our thanks for at least you played the game honestly. 
To the American fans, I say this election will mark not only the Gipper's last victory, but hopefully the first ofmany for the Gipper's sol­diers ofopportunity. 
In Congressman John Hiler, the Third Dis­trict of Indiana has such a winner. After first being elected in 1980, John Hiler has helped bring over 40,000 jobs to his district by sup­porting lower taxes which continue to booster the economy of Indiana and the na­tion. The ripple effect of these new jobs im­proves the lives of all Hoosiers and for this reason alone John Hiler deserves re-election. 
While his opponent has been throwing wild jabs at the Congressman, John Hiler has been bringinghome jobs for the people. What more can we ask? 
To my fellow democrats, I urge you for the sake of our party and our country to trust the powers of government to those who have proven most responsible. We cannot afford a replay of the late I 970's. 
In four short years with President Reagan, we have replaced excuses for why goverment does not work with leadership that works. Our cause for optimism comes from a faith, not in Mondale's big government, but in our­selves. The future demands a new destiny. Our hope for progress rests with those who have brought us back to life after Carter­Mondale and given us a renewed optimism. 
So my friends, get out of the stands and on to the field. Win one not only for the Gipper, but all people. The game has just begun.

President Reagan's.policies on Central America 
The real problem effecting the United States in Central America is not the absurd spectre of Soviet tanks rolling across Mexico into Texas. No, the real problem is the paranoia and militarism of Ronald Reagan and his administration. Beyond the emotionalism 
Richard Pilger 
guest column 
of Reagan's attempts to justify his views on Central America lie few if any facts. Further, if Americans are sincere when they claim their chief virtue to be a belief in freedom and democracy, there is no way for us to make a country's popular preferance for the commu­nist ethic ofeconomic parity throughout their society into a moral aberration. 
There is no convincing evidence of Soviet intervention in El Salvador. The President has relied on the white paper "Communist Inter· ference in El Salvador" in claiming such a Rus­sian connection. That document was destroyed by critical analysis that left the State Department admitti,.ng to its contrived and misleading nature. Reagan then trotted out some blurry 1V footage of an alleged smug­gling run by communist ships. Also presented was the correspondence of serial numbers on 
U.S. made rebel weapons to those on weapons we lost in Vietnam. It was not stressed that communist Vietnam put those weeaons on the open market long ago. In short, every piece ofproof that Reagan tries to put forward of an expanding Soviet military influence is weak if not perjurious. Even Reagan's third ambassador to El Salvador, Thomas Pickering, admitted "no single piece of evidence pre·

sented here could be called a smoking gun or 
silver bullet." 
In Nicaragua , the "freedom fighters " 
against the internationally recognized govern­
ment are mainly propagandized bandits, many 
of whom were mainstays of the Somoza fam­
ily's brutal grip on that country as members 
and executives of the National Guard and 
moneyed elite. They fled to Honduras when 
the Somoza regime was overthrown because 
they were responsible for the most savage 
atrocities Nicaragua has ever known. They 
were then recruited and funded by Reagan's 
CIA to " harass" the communist government 
in Managua, but despite official claims to the 
contrary the action was turned into a full-scale 
war waged by land, air, and sea to topple the 
legal government. 
Recent disclosure of the military methods promoted by Reagan's CIA illuminate the moral indifference of America's influence , as does Reagan's endorsement of completely illegal mercenary operations organized here to support the insurgents. This escalating in­terventionism, carefully controlled by the CIA because the contras proved ineffective, has been condemned by the World Court which ordered its stop and declared its illegality. To avoid the Court's order Reagan petulantly or­chestrated our sudden denial of its authority, thus showing the world his brand of integrity. 
His administration ha<; also turned a cold shoulder on the peace efforts of the Con· tadora nations meeting in Panama. 'lbey came out with a peace draft acceptible to all parties which needed only minor refinements before everyone would sign it. Suddenly Reagan's ad­ministration couldn't stomach it. After years ofpaying lip service to the Contadora process, when the reality of peace presented its ugly head, Reagan made sure his State Department threw a wrench in the works with haggling over petty but delaying details. 
Because of a production error, a guest column in yesterday's Viewpoint section by PeterS. Brown was improperly printed. The Observer will reprint this column at a later date. 
Since Reagan took office our military pres­
ence in Hoduras has leapt dramatically. The 
'"Big Pine" manoeuvres involving thousands 
of U.S. troops operating there have been 
scheduled almost continuously into 1988; " 
requiring" a permanent force of roughly 2000 
troops and complex infrastructure of roads , 
ports, air-strips and static defenses, and effect­
ing a semi-permanent troop presence of 
thousands more. Honduras borders on both El 
Salvador and Nicaragua. 
A comparison to the buildup in Vietnam 
cannot be avoided with trite dodges and 
phases such as "Vietnam Syndrome"which im­
ply some misfunction in a nation trying to 
avoid repeating a tragic and complex mistake. 
And the fact remains that Reagan has always 
asserted the dim notion that we should or 
even could have won that war. 
Reagan cannot divorce ideal communism's nature from the distorted version foisted on a credulous world by McCarthy, Stalin and the Gang of Four; its real nature, its chief and driving force derives from properties far dif· ferent than any demonic powers ofsome"Evil Empire." No, the power comes from the eco· nomic fairness ideal communism affords. It was no Soviet weapon that propelled the Viet Cong and NVA to triumph, it was the deter­mination of the Vietnamese populace to achieve social justice that enabled them to press on in the face of staggering losses. Whe­ther or not Vietnam is now a fair state, its ex­ample and that of Russia, France and the U.S. 
prove that oppression will ferment revolu­tions. 
Reagan does not understand this reality. He seeks only to address symptoms of the ram· pant ecomomic disparities in Central America. Ifht: truly sought peace in the region he would sincerely press to strip tt ': privileged oligarchies of their fabulous wealth

and stranglehold on the peasants. But Reagan 
does not understand poverty or its causes. He 
cannot accept the obvious necessity of fairly 
redistributing wealth here or anywhere in the 
world. He turns a blind eye on the long history 
of abuse that has whipped Salvadorans into 
rebellion, just as he blinds himself to the 
similarity of our own revolution to those of 
communist states. 
Reagan's main criticism of Nicaragua is the 
"undemocratic" nature of its government. 
Well ofcourse a government that has recently 
emerged from a bloody revolution isn't going 
to be a perfect democracy, but neither is the 
U.S. (which had no real constitution for over a decade after the Declaration of Independence ). The only right we have to influence the emerging governmental system of another country is the "right" ofsuperior force. Surely we are growing out of that pretense. 
Perhaps the best example of Reagan's reck­lessness came with Mexican President Miguel de Ia Madrid's visit to Washington in May. He told Congress that Central American prob­lems cannot be so"lved militarily and are the result of "economic deficiencies, political backwardness and social injustice that have af­flicted the countries of that area. We, therefore, cannot accept its becoming part of the East-West confrontation, nor can we ac­cept reforms and structural changes being viewed as a threat to the sel·urity interests of other countries of the hemisphere." This from a man supposedly under the guns ofa horde of Soviet dupes. Obviously his background and position make his attitude far more plausible than the one Reagan inflicted on us a week 
later when he again raised the tired image of Soviet proxies on our border.

Associated Press 
KANSAS CllY, Mo. -Whether the NCAA gets back in the football tele­vision business may depend on the outcome ofa lawsuit the NCAA isn't even directly involved in, a spokes­man said yesterday. 
A ruling Wednesday by a federal judge in New Mexico, however, seems to hand the NCAA one of its few victories in the three-year legal battle over control of college foot­ball telecasts. Judge Juan Burciaga, reversing an order he made in 1982, said the NCAA can offer a television plan to its member schools as longas 
it follows guidelines established by . the U.S. supreme Court in its ruling 
injune. 
Burciaga also affirmed the NCAA's 
right to ban schools from appearing 
on television if they are found in 
violation of rules. 
However, many observers feel a 
suit filed by the Association of Inde­
pendent Television Stations Inc. has 
raised questions that must be an­
swered before any group can try to 
administer college football telecasts. 
"The NCAA football television 
committee met today by conference 
call and agreed not to pursue the de­
velopment of a future television

and digging, and I think we have the best serving team in the conference. There are five girls who can serve aces at any time." 
In addition, as opposed to last year's team, this 1984 squad has a lot ofdepth which has allowed Goralski to make multiple substitutions throughout the season. Against Marion the Saint Mary's coach started a different line-up in each of the five games. 
Enthusiasm for the game is also much more evident this year. "Everybody wants to play and wants to win. They're going to play their hardest (against Marion)," Goralski said. 
This "great attitute" along with their improving volleyball skills are what Goralski thinks could carry the team into the final match against the probable opponent, host Franklin, which is ranked first overall in the conference and eighth in the nation. 
Saint Mary's was not playing on an even keel Monday night as is evident in the lopsided scoring in the five games. 
In the first game, the Belles were often caught off guard as Marion placed the ball well, keying on open Saint Mary's court. And the Lady Titan's blocking stifled the Belle's hitting game. After the score was knotted at 3-3. Saint Mary's was unable to put any more points on the board. 
In the second game of the match, it looked as if Marion would domi­nate once again as they jumped out to a quick 4-0 advantage. The Belles, however, regrouped and chipped away at the Marion lead. With the score 6-9, Marion --and sophomore Patty Williams behind the serving line --Saint Mary's rallied off five consecutive points to take the lead. 
Freshman setter Anne Williard as­sisted available front-row hitters and also had some nice defensive saves. Senior Ann Boutton and sophomore Mary Reidy led the offensive attack as senior Molly Baker capped off the victory with a couple kills for the final two points of the game. 
Once again the Lady Titan block­ing dominated. In game three the Belles were unable to get any momemtum going. Marion was led by 5'10" hitter Kim Ruster, who was deadly up at the net. Her spikes were hard hit and strategically placed. In­effective passes from the Saint Mary's back court also made it diffi­cult for setter sophomore Mary Dilenschneider and Williard to set up the plays. Marion built up an in­surmountable lead before taking the game 15-1. 
In the fourth game the Belles would evened the score but not without fighting for every point and an eventual dramatic finish. Saint Mary's started off by taking a com­manding 7-1 lead on some nifty set­spike combinations by Williard and Boutton. 
The Belles kept plugging away and built up a 13-4 lead. When it looked as ifthe Belles would wrap it up, the Lady Titans posted ten un­answered points to pull ahead 14­
13. Boutton then blocked for a Saint Mary's sideout and on the next play stopped a Ruster spike to shift the tide back on the host side. 
At 14-14 Boutton slammed down a kill, and Dilenschneider handed Marion an unreturnable serve for points I 5 and 16. 
The title game of the match proved to be just as exciting. But with the Belles sitting on match point at 14-10, they committed some unforced errors and were unable to hang on, surrendering to a disappointing 18-16 defeat.

Suglich, injured early, adjusts well to collegiate volleyball 

By CHUCK EHRMAN 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame volleyball and the Lambert Era. 
Aprogram on the rise, building for the future. Expectations of bigger and better things loom further down the road and it may only be a matter oftime. 
Recruiting is the key. And Coach ~t Lambert already has one class of recruits tucked away under his bell, his stepping stones for the seasons to come. One such scholarship player is freshman setter Jill Suglich, from 
~. \ 
the south side ofChicago. 
With the end of the volleyball season near, Suglich has worked her way into a shared starting role at the setter position with junior Mary Mclaughlin. "It's great to be playing," she said. "I was looking to play as a freshman. Coach Lambert
' . I ~ .. said that the team was in a building 
1,' year so playing time was a good pos­
,\. 
! \ sibility." 
;l 
'\! But Suglich has struggled along 
the way. "She had a slow start, as yotJ 
expect any freshman to have," said 
Lambert. The college game proved 
to be a learning experience, a big 
switch from high school. "On the 
college level it's more of a mental 
game," . said Suglich. "There was 
more to learn than I thought. More 
strategy. And it's more competitive." 
As if learning a new system was not enough, misfortune struck Suglich in early August when she suf­fered Achilles tendonitis, a nagging injury that bothered her. for a month. The injury restricted her playing time, but Suglich bounced back, and since that time the nifty 5'8" playmaker has done well. 
The Notre Dame volleyball team will be looking forward to her con­tinued fine play as it travels to the Pittsburgh Volleyball Tournament this weekend to go head-to-head with some of the best teams in the country. South Carolina and Penn State join the Irish and Pitt at the two-day event.

'·) Stingy Gallagher stops 
-~ ; 
offenses cold at goal
l
,, . ' 
By KEVIN HERBERT 

Sports Writer 
Patti Gallagher, the junior goal­tending sensation for Notre Dame's field hockey team, has closed the door on opposing offenses during the last 10 games, with the Irish pos­ting a record of 9-1 from those con­tests. 
On the fourth day of practice, Gallagher had the misfortune ofpul­ling a quadricep muscle in her leg, which sidelined her for the duration of the pre-season. She was fortunate enough, however, to be healthy by the time of the first game, but obvi­ously not as sharp as she could have I,. been had she been able to practice. 
Gallagher allowed 10 goals in the first eight games as the Irish got off to a slow 4-3-1 start. 
Gallagher's confidenced in­creased, and she said, "The Western Illinois game was the turning point ofmy season. That was the first game I felt that I played to my full poten­tial; it gave me a lot ofconfidence." 

The victory against Southern Illi­nois put the Irish over .500 with a record of 4-3·1, and from that point on the Irish field hockey team has been rolling. 
In the I 0 games following South­ern Illinois, Notre Dame has compiled a 9-1 record, winning the last five games. 
Gallagher has allowed only three goals in these games for an in­credible goals against average of.30 
\ --more than four times less than her I GAA in the first eight outings. I Gallagher said her coach and 
\ 
teammates have contributed to her success. "Jill Undenfeld is an excel­lent coach," she said. "Not only can she teach the fundamentals to us, but she also has the ability to keep the team's intensity level and spirit at apeak. 
"Our offense and defense has also been outstanding this year. They have been able to control play thereby limiting the opposition's shots on goal. 
"That makes my job a lot easier," she said. 
Gallagher is enthusiastic about the prospects for next season. 
"We should have an awesome season next year. We have nine start­ing juniors returning from this year's team." 
Personally, Gallagher said her "main goal (next year) is to keep my GAA under 1.00 because if I can achieve this it will show that I have played good consistent hockey." 
Gallagher is from Bishop Kenrick High School in Norristown, Penn. As a freshman at Notre Dame, she was captain ofthe undefeated junior var­sity field hockey team. 
Gallagher has started the last two seasons at goalie for the varsity squad, and this year she is co­captain. 
With Gallagher starting in goal next season, the Irish are looldng forward to another banner season, perhaps doing better than this year's 13-4-1 record. 
Notre Dame's final games of the 1984 season will be played this weekend in the St. Louis Tourna­ment. Also scheduled to compete are: Southwest Missouri State, West­ern Illinois, Louisville, Dayton, SIU Carbondale and St.Louis. 
Sports staff meeting 
There will be a mandatory meeting of all mem­bers of the Obseroer sports staff on Tuesday, No­vember 6, at 6:30 p.m. in the Obseroer office. Anyone who would like to write sports for the rest of the year must attend. If, for some very good rea­son, you cannot make the meeting, contact Mike Sullivan by Monday afternoon. The coverage of winter sports will be discussed as well as improve­ments in the current coverage. 
Suglich she spent four years as a var­sity starter in her high school pro­gram. 
And her four years there were dandy indeed. Her freshman season brought her Rookie of the Year recognition. And she added to this by earning MVP honors in her final three ~easons. 
But then it was good-bye high school, hello college. 
Now out under the Dome, Suglich has adjusted. "She is really doing well now," said Lambert. "She's blessed with tremendous athletic ability. She has a lot of desire and she's beginning to be a good setter. In fact, I think she can be a great one." 
Continued success depends on time and determination in a de­manding program. It is practice, practice, and then more practice. "It's like a full time job," Suglich said. "We practice up to four hours a day." But all the hard work has paid off and she has started to reap the fruits of her labor. She has learned a good deal about strategy, knowing what to do and when to do it. An­ticipation and reaction. Good vol­leyball intuition. 
As a setter, Suglich must run the team and put things in action. Said Kathy Morin, fellow freshman and outside hitter: "She's a smart player and a hard worker. She has the abil­

ity to run the team. She's a leader."

Zahm Hall earns spot 
with five other teams 
in Sunday's playoffs 
By BRIAN McCARlHY 
Sports Writer 
Zahm Hall, who has not made the interhall football playoffs since 1970, fulfilled coach John Looney's preseason predictions beating Holy Cross, 21-0, two weeks ago to ensure itself a spot in post-season play. 
Seeded fourth, Zahm faces fifth­seeded Howard Sunday at 1 p.m. on Stepan field. The winner takes on first-seed and unbeaten Sorin in the second round next Sunday. (The top two seeds do not have to play in the opening round.) 
The second game Sunday features what could be an emotional rematch between third-seeded Morrissey and sixth-seeded Dillon at 2 p.m. Dil­lon handed Morrissey its only loss of the year, a 16-0 defeat in the second week of the season. The survivor takes on second-seeded Stanford the following Sunday. 
Quarterback Mark Palaski scored one touchdown and passed to Phil Kelleher to lead Zahm two weeks ago against Holy Cross. Steve Dombrowski scored the third touchdown as Zahm, the only team whose playoff hopes were in doubt heading into the final week's games, finished the regular season with a 3­1 record. The team grabbed the Leahy division wildcard berth. 
In other games during the week before break, Grace's Jim Book booted a 35-yard field goal with six seconds to play to beat Dillon, 5-3. Grace winds up 2-3, and Dillon enters the playoffs with a 3-2 record as the wildcard team from the Par­seghian division. 
Sorin downed Howard, 8-0, to end the regular season unbeaten, untied and unscored upon at 4-0 and win the Rockne division. Howard finishes 2-l-l to earn the Rockne division wildcard berth for the playoffs. 
Pairings on page 15 
Morrissey upended Ott-Campus, 10-0, to top the Parseghian division. Flanner pounded Keenan, 28-0, to finish 3-2 while Keenan dropped to 1-3-1. Carroll and St. Ed's appropri­ately battled to a scoreless tie as they both end up l-2-1 on the year. 
Alumni edged Cavanaugh, 7-0, to wind up with a 2-1-1 slate, while Cavanaugh finishes without a win in four games. 
In seeding the teams in the playoffs, teams were assigned two points for a win, one point for a tie and zero points for a loss. Each squad's winning percentage was de­termined by dividing its total points earned by its total possible points. 
The first-place teams from each of the three divisions were seeded first through third according to their winning percentages. The three wildcard teams were seeded fourth through sixth in the same manner. 
SMC volleyball team plays in NAIA tonight 
By KELLY PORTOLESE 
Sports W'riter 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team, coming off a close loss to Marion College last Monday, takes on the Lady Titan..'l again tonight in the opening round of the NAIA tourna­ment. 
"We are looking forward to it. The girls really want to win that match," said second-year coach Brian Goralski. 
The Belles played uninspired vol­leyball Monday, losing a five-game, two-hour and 40-minute match 3­15, 15-10, 1-15, 16-14 and 18-16. 
Goralski said because of Fall break, it was 11 days since the team had played together, and he does not think it played up to full potential. 
That's why Goralski stresses tonight's game, to be played at Franklin College in Franklin, Ind., just south ofIndianapolis. The game is at 8 p.m.

Hockey team starts new season sporting renewed varsity status 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
After a one-year absence, var­sity hockey will again make its debut at Notre Dame. 
"I'm very excited about the start of the new season," said 17­year Head Coach Charles "Lefty" Smith. "Going back to varsity makes it even more special." 
For 1 S years hockey had operated as a varsity sport, but last year it was demoted to club status. A Division I independent, Penn State will provide the Irish leers with their first opposition of 1984-85 as the Nittany Lions invade the ACC today and tomor­row for 7:30p.m. contests. 
"We're pretty pumped up to play," said junior co-captain Bob Thebeau. "We've been working hard so long in practice. Now we want to go against someone besides ourselves so that we can reilly see what we can do. This first series of the season is a pretty important one for us." 
Notre Dame returns 14 starters from last year's squad, which compiled an impressive 23-5-1 mark while competing in the Central States Collegiate Hockey League and against various Division II varsity oppo­nents. Six freshmen also have worked their way into the start­ing line-up and are expected to step in and contribute.

Penn State, on the other hand, finished the 1983-84 season with a 23-1 S-1 record. The highlight ofits season came in March when the Lions won the National Club Team Championship in Tucson, Ariz., by defeating the Arizona Wildcats, 7-5. 
Penn State returns to action 
with 16 members from last year's team, including three of its top four scorers. Lynn Sipe led the way last season with 33 goals and 52 assists. 
When the Irish and Lions met last February in Johnstown, Penn., the two teams tied 4-4 the first night, but Notre Dame came away with a 6· I victory in the se­ries finale. 
"It was a very good series last season, but poor officiating and poor conditions at the arena took a lot away from it," said Smith. "Conditions will be different here, so we are expecting some good games this weekend." 
Since tryouts began the first week of October, Smith has got­ten four solid weeks of intense, hard work from his crew in prep­aration for the season opener. 
In putting lines together this season, Smith has tried to set up a balanced attack that will combine both speed and finesse.

ND wins season's final soccer game 
ByPHRWOLF 
AssistantSports Editor 
Rich Herdegen, playing in his last collegiate soccer game, scored half of Notre Dame's goals as the Irish defeated Valparaiso in overtime, 6-4, yesterday. 
Herdegen scored the first two goals and the final insurance goal in overtime for the Irish. The three­goal outing was Herdegen's third in his four years at Notre Dame and his only hat trick of this season. 
The Irish ended the season with a 12-6-2 record after yesterday's game. The win was Notre Dame's 14th consecutive victory over the Crusaders, whom the Irish have out­scored, 92-10, in eight seasons. 
It was the Crusaders who got on the scoreboard first yesterday, however. They began the game with a lot of enthusiasm and were able to 
maintain possession of the ball in Notre Dame's halfofthe field for the first few minutes ofplay. 
Less than two minutes into the game, Valpo was ahead, 1-0. The goal came when Irish goalkeeper Dan Coughlin slipped while attempting to make the save. The shot was·from only 10 yards in front of the goal, where the field was particularly muddy. 
Most of the field, in fact, was ex­tremely wet, which hindered play for the entire game. Several large puddles caused the ball to stop sud­denly and unexpectedly many times, and the mud made it difficult for the players to run. 
The Valparaiso goal brought the Irish to life, and they began to domi­nate play. The offense generated several scoring opportunities, and kept the pressure on the Crusaders' goal. 
Herdegen tied the game for the Irish with the first of his three goals. The play actually began with a foul called against Notre Dame. 
The Valpo goalkeeper was trying to gain possession ofthe ball in front ofhis goal when Tom Daley kicked it out of his grasp. lbe referee called a foul on Daley and awarded the Crusaders a free kick. The keeper kicked the ball only about 2S yards, however, and it came right to the feet of Herdegen. The Irish tri­captain blasted a shot from 20 yards that whizzed past the surprised goaltender. 
Less than two minutes later, Her­degen scored his second goal to give Notre Dame a 2-1 advantage. 
The Irish then launched several shots at the Crusaders' goal, only to be turned away by excellent saves or

Campaign Director Rollins: The college vote is key 

Reagan-Bush Campaign Director Ed Rollins 
Twenty years ago, when he was elected student body president at Chico State [California] University, Ed Rollins never dreamed he'd end up in ch~rge of a national political campaign. But, to­day, that's exactly where he is, manning the position of Campaign Director for the Reagan-Bush '84 Committee. 
His candidate is one of the most popular incumbents ever to seek reelection, and has maintained a wide margin in the polls since the campaign's inception. by his own admission, Rollins' philosophy had been "to stay out of the way" and allow the President to relate directly with the nation·s people. 
But Rollins has maintained tight control over the cam­paign, vanquishing the possibility of complacency so thoroughly that fourteen hour days are a matter of course for his staff. He realizes that a can­didate named Ronald Reagan is the best asset the Republican party could hope to have, and is attempting to parlay Reagan's popularity into a sanguine future for the GOP... 
Most Republican strategists agree that the party is broaden­ing its base, most significantly among young people, where the President's support is strongest of any age group. Rencently, Rollins took time todiscuss the importance of the college-age vote and its implications. 
0: How important is the youth vote to the President's reelection? 
Rollins: I think the most im­portant factor that is out there today is among young voters. There's a tremendous number of young voters, first time voters, second time voters, who are identifying with this president, and they in turn are going to vote Republican, maybe for the first time. 
Historically, young voters either have not voted or have been more liberal and have voted Democratic in greater numbers than they have Republican. These young voters want a strong economy, want less govern­ment interference in their life and basical1y stand for the same kind of patriotic values the President does. 
0: Why is the President so popular among young peo­ple? 
R: I think the most impor­tant thing people a little older have to remember is that many of these young people have never seen a successful president. There have been four failed presidencies in a row, the definition of failure being that the American public has chosen not to re­elect them or something catastrophic has happened in their term. This is the presidency that has worked. 
If Ronald Reagan wants to walk away from the Oval Of­fice next January 20th, if he chose not to seek re-election, there is no question this term would go down and this presidency as one of the great ones in history. He turn­ed the economy around, he built America's defense strengths, he made America proud again. I think compar­ing him with Jimmy Carter or to one of the other presidents that proceeded Carter, Ronald Reagan is head and shoulders above those peo­ple. And I think that, for young people, this is the president they will measure other presidents by. 
0: Will college students who are supporting the Presi­dent vote for other Republicans? 
R: If they vote for this presi­dent, they may very well vote f-or a Republican con­gressman. I think there is just a great opportunity with the baby boomers who are going to be the dominant political force for the rest of their lifetime, to vote independent or Republican and move for Democrats the first cou­ple of times they have voted. Then, as they get a little older, start making some money, start having a family, start philosophically changing a little, then they may in mid-40's change and vote for Republicans. 
But I think the fact that they are willing to vote for Republicans the first time out of the box and the second time is very encouraging, because I think there is a tendency there, a trend there that they may vote for other Republicans, and stay Republican. 
0: It has been said that young people support Ronald Reagan on the basis of style, not substance. Is this true? 
R: I think all the rhetoric about Ronald Reagan being

away from the old line liberal policies ~of the Democratic party. 
Q: Will this trend lead to the Republicans becoming the majority party? 
R: I think the encouraging thing is that many of the young voters who vote Republican this time may not register as Republicans. They may register as In­dependents, but I think that any good Republican can­didate will always have the opportunity to go get them again. 
What traditionally has hap­per'led is younger voters have thought of themselves as Democrats and have voted 
Reagan vs Mondale 
Who will decide our future? 
ByFrankGregorsky 
If your question is, "Who understands the future?," then Walter Mondale can't hold a laser beam to Ronald Reagan. 
Sen. Gary Hart was accurate last winter in saying his jousting match with MondaJe was "acontest between this party's future and its past.'' In their party, the past and Walter Mondale won, and the Democrats now face a future bleak for the kind of welfare-state worldvlew the Mondale coalition possesses. let'slook at taxes, small business, unions, space and foreign policy. 
1)Seven years ago, Ronald Reagan grasped the shift from Keynesian tax theories toJack Kemp-style incentlvism, mean­ing that tax policy must stimulateeconomic growth before it redistributes income. yet this Insight has passed Walter Moo­dale's team by. 
The Mondale tax plan is straight out of the 1930s: by hiking penaltieson those whosave, inYeSt and innovate, it will preempt more wealth than It raises for government. When shown real figures on how the Reagan-Kemp tax cuts increased revenues from the rich during 1982-83with lower rates, Mondale liberals say, "Maybe so, but we want the symbolismofa morestiffly graduated tax rate scale." 
2) A counterproductive Mondale worldview also gives short shrift to small business, whose annual start-ups are doubletheir 19741evel and six times t~r 1950 numbers. Outof fNefY six new enterprises in 1983, five Were started by women. Americans in the 1980s don't just want toget a "bigger piece ofthe pie," they want to bake their own pies. 
But the Mondale tax scheme is a daggeraimed at the heart of small business job creation. Its dilution of Indexation and upper-bracket surcharge will hurt unincorporated enterprises, whose proprietors pay taxes on the personal rate scale. 
3)The flip-side of that is organized labor, with itsartificially-high wages and anti-technology biases. Union membership has 
fatten from 27.3% of it, is willing to stick with Ronald Reagan. 
yet the union leaders are inhock to the Democrats, and Mon­
date has happily stuck himself with their job-destroying 
"domestic content" legislation and steel import quotas. 
The Mondale agenda thus rewards big labor and hurts small 
business, and destroys or preempts jobs in the process. 
4) And what of space? If any one word Is the future, It's "space." Mondale is anti-space. He tried tokill the Space Shut· tie during 197().72, and hasnoroom for space in his 1984 agen­daThe leadership on space commercialization and space ex· ploratlon is all coming from President Reagan. 
5) Finally, there's foreign policy. Both the Mondale and Hart wings of the Democratic Party wallow in Vietnam-era quagmires.They want to"blameAmerica first." Everytime the Sandlnistas, Colonel Qaddafi or Lebanese terrorists do something bad, It'ssomehowthe President's fault. Mondale's partywould hamper thegrowth of U.S. power and put its faith in U.N. resolutions and unverifiable arm pacts. 
Under Reagan, Amerlca has put Vietnam behind ItThere are 
"lessons" to be learned from Iran, Afghanistan, and Grenada, 
but too many Democrats stopped learning that day in April ·1975 when Saigon fell to the Communists. 
Reagan understands both world ·realities and the re­
juvenatorypowerofAmerican capitalism; he knows the secrets 
ofU.S. success in the 19tlls and 1990s.On his good days, Walter 
Mondale can peep through to the 1970s. The res~ ofthe time, 
he's stuck somewhere in the 1930s. 
(Frank Gregorsky, 29, Is the author of "What's The Matter With Democratic Foreign Polley?," published by the American Conservative Union, and edits the weekly BULLETt N of the 
House Republican Study Committee. 
-Ed Rollins 
an image candidate is just a bunch of bunk. Ronald Reagan has turned the direc ... tion of this country around, he has reset the national agen­da. The Democrats themselves are now talking about deficits and balanced budgets which before was heresy. Mondale is now talk­ing about peace through strength in his commercials. That was the Reagan slogan four years ago and the Republican slogan for many years that he (Mondale) belit­tled several months ago. 
0: Are young people turn­ing conservative on other issues as well? 
R: I think realistically the young people today are going to be a different kind of voter, in the sense that they may not agree in all the social pro­grams of the President. My estimation is that the young voter are going to become more and more conservative on fiscal policy and foreign policy, and probably a little more libertarian on the social issues. 
Many of them have grown up in a more libertarian en­vironment, where its kind of where you do your thing, I do my thing. So I think some on some of the harder, more con­servative social issues they may not totally agree. But they are not saying that if you disagree with me on one issue. I can't vote for you. I think they're open-minded and I think they are going to vote for the individual. 
0: Why did this trend sur­prise all the so-called ex­perts? 
R: There's a whole emerg­ing voter group out there that very few political scientists, behaviorists, or political col­umnists really haven't handl­ed. The young voters are so­meone who really have created a new political en­vironment out there. As a Republican, I think it is very encouraging.

Ronald Reagan: Born in the USA 
by Daniel Schnur 
Carleton College 
'The issue will be Ronald Reagan', says one state cam­paign official. 'He's the col­ossus. ReaQan is the can­didate, Reagan is the plat­form, and Reagan is the only issue to the average voter'. 
Every electiofl is, to a cer­tain extent, is a referendum on the incumbent. But, more than any president seeking re-election since Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan is dominating the national agenda. 
His control, his effect on the mood of the electorate is almost total. And the mood is so positive that even Walter Mondale's own adv1sors are who engineered this nation's economic recovery. Worst of all, though, he must somehow convince the voters of this country that they should prefer him over the man who has somehow rekindled the patriotic spirit in their souls. And all the doom and gloom on God's earth won't convince people that feeling pride in their country is a bad way to live. 
Witness last summer's Olympic Games. Four years ago, when the United States hockey team captured a gold medal at the 1980 Olympics, observers philosophized that the resulting outbreak of 
There is an enthusiasm ... that has been absent since the days of Kennedy and Roosevelt 
admitting that their only chance lies with the possibili­ty of some huge Reagan gaffe, that would turn what is now a popular mandate bordering on landslide into a reasonable fascimile of a two-man race. 
The task facing Mondale is a formidable one. Not only must he face a popular in­cumbent, but the president patriotism was the cry of a country desperately sear­ching for something, anything to cheer. 
The national celebration this summer, on the other hand, was of a decidedly dif­ferent nature. This time, the cheers were not a release of pent-up frustration and im­potence, but the congratula­tions and celebrations of a confident people who knew that these gold metals were not a fluke, but a symbol of a renewed American deter­mination and self-respect. 
Cynics accused Reagan of capitalizing on the Olympic spirit, as if he deserves no credit for the rebirth of na­tional pride that happened to occur during the four years of his presidency. 
But the people know the truth. At every stop he makes, in every town he visits, there is an enthusiasm, an adula­tion for the man that has been absent for a sitting president since the days -of Kennedy and Roosevelt. 
Four years ago, people 
were  saying  that  the  
presidency  was  too  big for  
one man.  

The re-election of an in­cumbent president, which had once been almost a foregone conclusion, had been upset in two successive elections. The American peo­ple, who had seen their trust in the incumbencies of Lyn­don Johnson and Richard Nixon rewarded with Vietnam and Watergate, were disillu­sioned, and turned out both Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter in short order. 
That disillusionment is gone. There is no talk now that the presidency is too large a duty for one man. One

In order to understand "Nancy with 'the Laughing Face"' you must also realize her strength of character. She has involved herself exten­sively in foster care and anti­drug programs. She is therefore far more than a smiling figurehead and White House hostess. She has played a major role in the development of Ronald Reagan into the man he is to­day ... the fortieth president of the United States. 
The President sees Nancy clearly as his mainstay. There's nothing he does not tell her. "As far back as I can remember in the marriage, anything that happens ... the first thought in my mind-the first image in my mind-is that 'I'm going to tell her about it"'. 
As first lady, Nancy effec­tively balances the dual role as wife and White House hostess. "When we first mov­ed into the White House, my instinct was to make it home for my husband. Until that was accomplished, I didn't feel ready for other things." 
"I had no idea ...that being first lady was a full time job. The demands on my time are enormous, but so are the rewards. The opportunity to get things accomplished from this position is very gratifying." 
It has been a time when she has come to better understand the problems of the country. But even prior to this time, when Reagan was Governor of California, Nan­cy wrote a syndicated column during the Vietnam war and donated her salary to the Na­~ional League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Action in Southeast Asia. 
Mrs. Reagan also became the moving force behind the highly acclaimed Foster Grandparent Program, because she realized that the "elderly have so much to give and so do these handicapped children. The Foster Grand­parent Program just gives them a way to make the ahppy exchange." She also continues to work to bring the project to a national level and to promote private funding in local communities. 
Another interest area of Mrs. Reagan's is the fight against drug abuse. Among other projects she has nar­ratec.i a two-hour documen­tary on the subject for public television. She remarks, "I have seen the ravages of drug abuse and the sadness of children who think there's no point in living, who don't know there's a whole rich and wonderful world out there­kids who have in a way given up on the world before they even got to know it." 
And she hopes she and Ron can have an influence on this next generation. "I think he's (Reagan) the best man for the job and he will have a chance to continue what he started. I don't think we've had a continuity really since Eisenhower. Just as people get use to somebody, they're gone. It makes it difficult." 
She applies this ·th~ory to her own life, "you have to keep pushing it. You can't let it die. I feel, and I hope I'm right,... You like to think you contributed something." 

man has mobilized the American people to revive the sagging economy. One man has led the movement that has restored America's place in the world. 
And that man is being rewarded for his feats by a grateful nation. They know that the same man who brought America back will take it even further, and if the referendum on the Gipper would be put to a voice vote, the ayes would surely wake up the echoes. 

The Reagan Record 
Inflation: 
The President's anti-inflationary policies have reduced the rate of inflation to less than four per· cent for two consecutive years-a truly spectacular achievement. 
Job Creation: 
The President's economic recovery has created 6.5 mHiion new jobs. More Americans are working to· day than ever before. 
Productivity: 
Worker productivity under President Reagan rose over three percent in 1983 ·the largest gain in eight:.. years. As a result, real wages have risen more than three percent during the past two years. 
Defense and Arms Control: The Reagan Administration is rebuilding our defenses to keep America safe, while at the same ·. time pursuing the most ambitious arms reduction policy-the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks. 
Women's Advancements: 
During his first two years in office, President 
Reagan appointed more than 1400 women to im· 
portant government positions, including Sandra 
Day O'Connor: to the Supreme Court, Elizabeth' 
Dole as Secretary of Transportation, Margaret 
Heckler as Secretary of Health and Human Ser­
vices, and Jeane Kirkpatrick as US Ambassador to 
the United Nations. Under President Reagan, the· 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
recovered more back pay awards for job 
discrimination against women than the previous 
Administration.

Energy Independence: 
The vulnerability of the U.S. economy to the whims of OPEC is a thing of the past. Under President Reagan, U.S. oil production is up, while the price of Imported oil and the proportions of imports to total consumption is down. 
Crime: 
Under President Reagan, the crime rate dropped seven percent last year ·the biggest drop in a generation. The rate of serious crime fell by four percent In 1982, and five percent during the first six months in 1983. Reagan has proposed legislation to compensate the victims of crime. 
Ally Relations: 
American leadership at the Williamsburg Summit in the spring of 1983 marked the beginning of world economic recovery. The seven nations present agreed to a common program to combat inflation, resist protectionism, and aid developing nations.

mate says "George has done a helluva job ... You cannot find any instances in three and one-half years of backbiting, of second guess­ing, of that sort of thing. He has played the role of vice president as well as anybody I've ever seen.' In March 1981, for example, 
the attempted assassination 
of Reagan thrust Bush for­

period may have done more 
than anything else to cement 
his reputation. Last year, he

Que to his strong perfor­mance as vice president, Bush is considered an early front-runner in the race for the nomination of the Republican party in 1988. But for now, Bush has chosen to focus his attention on the job at hand ... the reelection of Ronald Reagan.

Ronald Reagan has selected more women for policy-making positions during his first two years in office than any of his predecessors. All told, women hold more than 1 ,600 positions in the White House and throughout the Executive Branch. 
Soon after Reagan's elec­tion in 1980, the first woman ever to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor, was appointed. He is also the first president to have three women serve in his cabinet at the same

Equal rights: the real story 
Since being elected, the Reagan administration has 
vigorously supported legal and economic equality for all women. 
Reagan has stated that women should be protected against discrimination in all forms, but that these protec­tions should take the form of specific legislation. He believes that legal equity should be guaranteed, but the power to establish that equity should be left with the elected representatives of the people. 
He has also called for and produced stronger enforce­ment of protections already written into the statutes. At his direction, Justice Department workers active­ly enforce possible viola­tions of equal rights legisla­tion passed In the past. 
In 1981, Reagan created the Task Force on Legal Equity for Women to work with the Justice Department in finding and catatogtJing gender-biased laws and rules, so that they can be ef­fectiv!ly changed or eliminated. As a result, more progress has been made to correct gender· biased federal statutes than in any previous administra­
-tion. Ttre Task Force also recommended internal reviews within the ad· ministration to determine possible bias in its own regulations, a recommenda· tlon all 42 federal depart­ments have followed. He has endorsed 122 changes in federal law recommended by his task force on legal equity to remove provisions that discriminate against women, and another project has sparked forty-two of the fifty states into examining their own laws to identify and eliminate gender­discriminatory language. Individual Retirement Ac­countg (IRA) rules have been liberalized, In order to recognize the value of non­working spouses to provide greater retirement savings, the President has proposed raising the spousal IRA limit 
from $2,250 to $4,000. The ..marriage tax penalty" also has been greatly reduced-a great savings to lower­Income families with two breadwinners. 
In addition, since Presi­dent Reagan took office, women have benefited, as llave all Americans, from lower taxes, reduced infla­tion, lower interest rates, and, most importantly, more job opportunities. He has also reduced the marriage tax penalty, virtually eliminated the estate tax, expanded savings oppor­tunities for spouses, put teeth into child support en­forcement legislation, and worked for pension equity for women. 
"We must work together to ensure women can par­ticipate in our national life in the manner they choose and that they are treated equally", he has said. "We, in this administration, are committed to eliminating, once and for all, all traces of unjust discrimination against women." 
women in positions of great responsibility can be glean­ed from his own words:

leader not because she was a woman, but because she was the best person for the job,' Reagan said. 'There was no tokenism or cynical 'symbolism'. She became a leader of her party, and prime minister of Great Bri· tain because she was judg­ed by her peers to be a superior leader. And that is how the first republican woman president will do it.' 
'The women who have ad­vanced in the Republican party, coming up through the ranks, and doing it by merit. These women are changing America, and they are changing it for the bet­ter. The American people recognize this and will sup­port such a woman when she runs for President of the United States.

People, not symbols 
You know, there's just no way we can win. 
Back in the 1960s, adults looked down at 
students for protesting. Then, in the '70s, when 
young people were apolitical, they made fun of us 
for being apathetic. 
So now we're turning conservative, and they're 
giving it to us with both barrels. We're selfish. 
We're shallow. We're greedy. We're short-sighted. 
We're stupid. 
Don't we know that kids are supposed to be 
liberals? 
No, we don't know we're supposed to be liberals. We're not supposed to be liberal any more than we're supposed to be conservative or moderate or anything else. 
Today's college students are informed and open-mincad and concerned. And we're definitely not interested in fitting in with anybody's twenty year old stereotypes about what we're supposed to be. 
We're not ·interested in conforming with party labels anymore. Maybe a few more young people are turning Republican, but most of us consider ourselves Independents. With a capital'!'. 
Yes, we're supporting Ronald Reagan this time around. There are six million more jobs than there were when he took office, jobs that we're going to need when we graduate. And we're a lot more con­fident about the future, and a lot more sure of ourselves, than we were four years ago. Reagan deserves credit for that. 
But that doesn't me~n that we're necessarily Republicans forever. Our grandparents voted for FOR in 1932 and voted Democrat for the next forty­five years. Most of us are not making that kind of commitment and we never will. 
Maybe we'll be voting Democrat ourselves ·in four years. Maybe not. But neither party's going to be able to take us for granted, because we'll vote for people and for ideas, not for donkeys and elephants. 
Why not? 
In 1980, about forty percent of the eligible voters between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four voted. That means that sixty percent did not. 
Why not? Officials from both parties are predicting a bet­ter youth turnout Tuesday. But not that much bet­ter. 
Why not? 
Think about it. Most of us will wait in line forhours for tickets to a concert or football game. But we're not going to take ten minutes or so this Tuesday to decide who's going to run our nation for the next four years. 
Why not? 
Think about it. In four years, almost all of us will be finished with school and have jobs. 
Or maybe we won't have jobs. 
Why not?

GOP puts on voter blitz 
by Laura Easton 
Southern Methodist Univ. 
The office is tucked away 
in a small corner of the top 
floor of the Reagan-Bush '84 
national campaign offices, 
and often escapes the notice 
of visitors. But in that office, 
which houses the fifteen­
person Voter Programs divi­
sion, lies what many 
Republican leaders consider 
the most crucial aspect of the 
re-election effort. 
Voter Programs has two 
main duties, voter registra­
tion and coordinating a na­
tionwide get-out-the-vote ef­
fort on election day. The 
registration phase of the ef­
fort was completed on Oc­
tober 12th after having 
registered over 3.3 million 
new voters, a vast majority 
having been targeted as 
Reagan supporters. 
'The Reagan-Bush '84 Committee and the Republican National Com­mittee have the most vigorous voter registration program in the United States today', says Vice President George Bush, and Reagan­Bush Voter Programs Direc­tor Helen Cameron takes Bush's statement one step further, saying, 'It is the most intensive effort on registra­tion ever by our party'. 
A CClmbination of techni­ques were used in reaching potential voters, according to LindaZ. Cherry, Deputy Direc­tor of Voter Programs, in­cluding computer identifica-
My dad, the prez (cont.) 
Continued from page 1 
The events in Dallas mark a beginning-of-the-end of sorts for my father. If he goes on to  win the general election (Will it snow in Alaska this winter?), he will be serving his final term in any government office. With this in mind, I thought he'd like to reflect this week on his years in politics. 
To begin at the beginning, Dad never really wanted the job. 'It all stemmed from a speech I made at the end of the '64 campaign,' he says. That speech, on behalf of Barry Goldwater, caught the eye of people whose business it is to promote can­didates. 'I was talked into (running for governor of California) on the basis of our party being split apart after the '64 election and people thinking that maybe I could help bring it together again.' He pauses to switch gears. 'It was a sudden change in my entire life that I never thought I'd make. It got to the place where your mother and I couldn't sleep very well wor­rying as to whether we were being presented with something· we didn't have a right to turn down. Finally, we saw it as a responsibility we 
couldn't avoid.' 
No sooner was he elected governor than pols began nagging my father about the presidency. Characteristical­tion and automated phone calls. But the key, says Cherry, was the volunteers who physically registered the potential voters. 'The com­puter work simply assisted the volunteers in locating the potential new voters', she says. 'Without the volunteers, not one new person would have been registered.' 
The Voter Programs team is now devoting its full atten­tion to making sure that these new voters actually vote this Tuesday. 'We want everyone to participate in this year's presidential electoral pro­cess', says Cameron. 
ly modest, he regarded this as 
a silly proposition. 
Nonetheless, he allowed his 
name to be placed in nomina­
tion as a 'favorite son' can­
didate for the '68 election. 
'Good Lord,' he laughs, 'to 
come from the profession I 
came from and to be only one 
year in the first elective office 
I'd held ... to stick my head 
up and announce I was runn­
ing for president, well, that I 
wouldn't do. I never at any 
time solicited votes or said I 
was an actual candidate.' 
'It's no fun to lose,' Dad ad­mits, recalling his first real run at the nomination against incumbent Gerald Ford in '76. 'But we gave it our best shot, I really thought I could make it a race against Mr. Carter,' he continues. 'I'd known him when we were both gover· nors, I'd had a longer time in office than he'd had and, I thought, a better record.' 
Self-effacing as he may be in general, this record is something my father doesn't mind touting. He lights up recalling his days governor, citing a balanced budget and a surplus that was handed back to the taxpayers. It also gives him an opportunity to tweak the noses of those who decried his lack of political credentials. 'They said, 'It has never been done before'-giving back money to the people. I said, 'You've never had an actor up here 
before." Of his first term as 
'~~~~~' 
·'··· 
Of particular concern to the leaders of this effort, though, is the historically poor turnout by young voters. Only forty percent of eligible voters between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four cast ballots in the 1980 elec­tion, and a repeat of that dismal performance could negate the immense popularity that the President now enjoys among young voters. 
'The future of America is riding on this election', says Vice-President Bush. 'And getting out the vote is what elections are all about'. 
president he observes, 'For years and years the debate in Washington has been, 'How much more are we going to spend?' Since we've been here the whole debate has shifted to 'How much more are we going to cut?' 
In a job that calls for press­ing the flesh, my father en­joys the unfair advantage of harboring a genuine affection for humanity. 'I don't know whether it comes from the previous industry I was in,' he muses, 'but I like people. I don't know how anyone could be in this buf.iness without liking them but I have to tell you, there are a lot of politi· cians who don't.' 
'There's a great sense of fulfillment,' my father says of his career in government. There is no hint of frustration in his voice. If nothing else, he is a contented man doing something he believes in. There have been unan­ticipated thrills and unasked­for pain, but, all in all, he 
·wouldn't change a thing. When the time comes, my father will head back to his beloved ranch. Until then his work as a public servant makes everything else look as he puts it, 'dull as dishwater.'

On college campuses, traditionally hotbeds of liberalism, conservative ideology would seem the far­thest thing from any student's mind. Burning with political outrage and protest during the Vietnam War years of the 1960's and early '70s, the nation's college cam­
,, puses have been a hotbed for liberal thought. Yet now, in the '80s, it appears the tide is 
I 
i 
turning. 
Student leaders contend that students are fed up with liberal ideologies expounded by Democrats, and that con­servatism and Republican support is growing on college campuses across the coun­try. 
Brian Rogga, chairman of the College Republicans, at the University of Wisconsin, points to a steady increase in his group's membership. "We are the No. 1 political group on the University of Wiscon­sin campus in terms of membership," he said. 
This group of conservative thinkers formed in 1983 "because people were tired of getting one view on this cam­pus," Rogga said. "Between professors, the media, and the liberal ideology in Madison, we keep getting a constant leftist view." 
The conservative student newspaper on campus, the

Reagan's big drawing card among students appears to be the president's stand on economic and foreign issues. "After a lot of years of Democratic spending," Hoske said, "students saw

the trends and didn't want their money going in that direction." The students of the '80s are a group very con­cerned with their future and that of the country's. 
A new day is dawning on campuses across America and the trend is toward con­servatism. 
Confessions of a middle-aged Democrat 
by Vic Gold 
Hearing MarioCuomocompared to tne late Adlai Stevenson 
atthisyear's Democratic conventlon reminded meofthefirst 
time I voted in a Presidential election. 
Theyear-was 1952. Stevenson was the Democratic candidate and, although he tost toDwight Eisenhower, hisstyle and elo­-quence attracteda good many voters tothe Democratic party­
voters like me. 
A dozen years later, afterIwent to work in BarryGoldwater's Presidential campaign, oldfriendswouldask how Ihappened to change party allegiance. My answer was, "Ididn'tchange-the Democratic party did." 
It was an answer Iused not only1n 1964 but right up to this year's Democratic convention. Then, listening to Mario Cuomo, Walter Mondale, Tip O'Neill and other speakers at San Francisco, I realized it wasn't the right answer at all. 
The reason Ibecame a Republican 20 years ago-and why millionsof young. middle--aged and older Americans are turn­Ing to the Reagan-Bush ticket this year--isn't becausethe Democratic partychanged. tt'sbecausethetimes havechanged and the Democratic party hasn't. · 
Everybody agreed that Mario Cuomo gave aneloquent dis-. quisition of the Democratic party's philosophy when he ad­dressed theconvention tn San Francisco. There were media raves over Cuomo's rhetoric and presentation. They style was 1984-but what about the substance? 
It was as if Cuomo-like another New Yorker, Rip Van Winkle-had just awakened from a 52-year sfeep and still thought the country was in the middle of the Great depression of the 1930s. 
TheAmerica that the Democratic keynoter saw that night in San Francisco wasn't a country enjoying an economic boom, after years ofeconomic misery under the Carter-Mondale ad­ministration. Instead, despite the Reagan-Bush recovery ofthe 
past four years. the New York Governor rubbed his eyes and said. as he saw it, things were terrible and bound to get worse. And what was Rip Van Cuomo's recipe toavert this Impen­
ding disaster? The same as Walter Mondale's, Geraldine Fer­raro's~ Ted Kennedy's, Tip O'Neill's, and every other national Democratic leader ofthe past halfcentury: government pro­
grams and more government progr~ms. Bigger gov~rnment spending. Higher taxes. Do we have a problem? Ftne--just throw money at it and it'll all be solved. 
It all started with the New Deal m 1'=J32. l hen came tne Fair Deal of 1948. Then the New Frontier of 1960, and the Great Society of 1964. Nobody argues that all these Democratic programs didn't rpoduce some good. But this is 1984, not 1932or 1964, and the time has long since past when the American people looked to government for the answer to all problems. Instead, what Americans are turning to in the Reagan-Bush program i~ renewed em· phasis on free enterprise and individual initiative .as the answer to our country's economic challenges of the 1980s and beyond. 
Once, perhaps. when Franklin Roosevelt came into of­fice during the Great Depression, government could pro­vide answers. But in 1980 the American people drew the line. What Ronald Reagan's election that year said-and what the Rip Van Winkles of the Democratic party fail to understand--is that as far as the people are concerned. government today is the problem. not the answer. 
Times have changed. The Democratic Party hasn't.lt"s as simple as that. Let Walter Mondale and Geraldine Fer­raro run against Herbert Hoover if they want. but what new voter in 1984 are more likely to recall isn't the Great Depression but the Great Malaise of the Car~er-Mondale years. 
Vic Gold, nationally known author and lecturer, 
you support President Reagan? 
The economic climate is of particular importance to me due to the fact that there is a direct corrolation bet­ween the prosperity of the United States and my parents' ability to put me through college. It is also important to me that we are a strong nation, with a stron leader, one that does not get pushed around by other na· tions as they did in the past. It gives me confidence to know that we are a secure nation.

Ronald Reagan has what America wants and needs in a President -strength, morality, and a sense of tradition. He is not the can­did::~te of the rich but the candidate of the aspiring. We are better off than we were four years ago. The economy is stronger; we are proud of our country again; and we are prepared to pro­tect our freedom.

Why vote for Reagan? It's simple. This election is a clear choice between two different views of the role of government: the big spen­ding, big government view of Walter Mondale vs. the free enterprise, limited government view of Presi­dent Reagan. 
President Reagan's record speaks for itself. He has brought the country out of a period of economic disaster and national malaise brought on by the Carter/Mondale team and has restored the nation's confidence in its leadership.

i support the re-election of President Ronald Reagan and the continued leader­ship of the Reagan ad­ministration. I feel that Reagan's economic policies can successfully lead our nation towards economic stability with full support of American's business and in­dustry. I believe that Reagan's firm stance on foreign political issues must be continued for the safety of our nation. Ronald Reagan will rece1ve my vote in the November '84 elec­tion.
