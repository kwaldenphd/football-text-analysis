After almost an hour of debate and questioning. the Student Senate voted unanimously Wednesday night to approve the Club Coordination Council's 
(CCC) 2001-2002 budget. which allocates money to student clubs.

News Writer 
Student body president Brooke Norton delivered her State of the Student Union address to the Student Senate last night, using the opportu­nity to praise both student government and students in general. 

"It is a great time for the men and women of Our Lady's University," Norton said. "We 
as a com­munity h a v e embraced diversity and inclu­sivity as n e v e r before." 


No rt o n Norton also chal­lenged student government "to work together to better our University and our 
world." 
"I assure you that Brian [Moscona. student body vice president]. the office of the president staff and I intend to continue the tradition of ser­vant leadership that has emerged here in recent years," said Norton. "We believe that the Student Union should focus on programs that allow students to think both with their heads and with their hearts." 
Norton called for research­ing "new policy initiatives."

its limited resources were fair to all clubs. Part of their effort included creating alloca­tion guidelines for the first time this year. according to Hagan. 
"A lot of times there was suspi­cion that we favored older. more established clubs," said Hagan. 
"All the clubs are underfunded. No club is getting all the money it needs and deserves. Every penny we've allocated is deserved by the club. " 
John Hagan 

CCC coordinator 

The CCC hopes having guide­lines will help to reduce that sus­picion. Hagan explained. He added that the CCC also intended the guidelines reduce allocations to clubs for "unnecessary expenses." 
"All the clubs are under-fund­ed. No club is getting all the money it needs and deserves," said Hagan. "Every penny we've allocated is deserved by the club." 
Senators questioned Hagan about allocations for several clubs. often organizations that the senators were members of. 
"There's a very limited amount of resources," said student body vice president Brian Moscona. "All of [the clubs] have great cases. We have to be objective." 
"All of us are in clubs. and we all know that the clubs we're in haven't gotten all the money they need," said Morrissey senator Padraic McDermott. 
McDermott asked Hagan why the College Independents received $470 when the club does not have any members. 
Hagan said the club is actively recruiting members. McDermott made a motion to 
decrease 
the College Independents' allocation by $150 in order to increase the Trident Naval Society's alloca­tion by the same amount. 
McDermott, who is a member of the society. said the club needs more money to better conduct its an annual fundraiser to raise money for the Special 
Olympics. 
"This is so necessary. McDermott said. "[Our fundrais­er] is the reason there's still Special Olympics in Saint Joseph's county." 
However. the Senate. rejected McDermott's motion. 
In addition, senators also ques­tioned why Flipside was receiv­ing significantly more money than it did this year.

Committee considers possible designs for Madeleva 

By MYRA McGRlFF Saint Mary's Editor 
The Madeleva Building Committee met Tuesday to discuss the design plan of the new Madeleva building. The committee, breaking up into small focus groups consolidated a list of 16 points into six main focus areas. 
"We are developing what is important in an academic building." said Keith Dennis, vice president of finance. 
Although all of the 16 discussed points will influence the design model. six of those will be the main focus. The committee comprised of faculty. staff and administrators brainstormed the ways beauty. learning, options for interac­tion. design, emotions/spirituality and environ­mental concepts could all be incorporated into the architectures design plan. 
Generating concepts in the small focus 

groups. each of the six main points were fully dissected to envision various ways each will fit the new building concept. 
One of the running themes throughout most of the six focus groups was the idea of social space. A social space that hopes to encompass students needs for a not only welcoming but also spiritual environment. 
One suggestion to construct such an environ­ment was to make a common space accessible from two entrances. 
"The buildings doors need to open from both sides," said Karen Ristau, dean of faulty 
Ristau also discussed an emphasis in giving students and faculty the feeling they possess a space on campus to leave their mark and make Madeleva into more than just an academic building. · 
Enlisting the help from the architectural firm MPA, the committee hopes to achieve such an endeavor.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Welcome to the show 
l don't remember my first performance on stage, but my mother can tell you all about it. She still remembers I.he names of the actors, the choreography. and the techs. She remembers everything because she was there. 
By age 3, I wanted to try 
everything, and I was quite the ham. I began getting involved .in theater -com­plete with auditions and headshots. During this time, my mom allowed me to dance and jwnp and explore my interests. And, in the middle ofmy preschool years, 

I became quite the little 
Kelly Hager 
actress. 
As I grew older, I became 
more active in theater and 
dance, trying my hand at TV 
Copy Editor 
and radio. My mom was 
always there. Through all 
the rehearsals and shows, my 
mom never left my side. She sat through all the 
lessons and rehearsals. And she made it to every 
show. I could always count on her to be there 
By the time Iwas in high school. I was too old to play all the cutesy kiddy rolls, and too young to play women. I took that as an opportunity to explore the other areas of the theater. I began to work on the crew, and play in the orchestra pit. With me as a teenager, mom left me alone to fend for myself during rehearsals. But that switch didn't detour her from coming to performances. She was there for each show and each concert, ready to show her enthusiasm and support. 
And now, in college I have made my position known by accompanying shows, rather than act­ing in them. But that all changed this semester when I found myself auditioning for Gypsy. I had already been drafted to play in the pit when I was approached to try out for a stripper role. They needed someone brassy and loud. Somehow or another, my name came up, and I found myself at an audition. And before I knew it, I was onstage again. 
This show has made me realize how much ofan impact growing up in theater has had on my life. And, it also has opened my eyes. Looking back through the years, I can still remember exactly where my mom sat in I.he theater to watch me while I was on. l remember the books she read to pass the time. It is amazing which things a person will remember after it's aU said and done -near­ly 20 years ago. 
I remember the fun. I remember the experience. But most of all, I remember time well spent with my morn. During those rehearsals, I knew she was there, and that enabled me to explore things fur­ther -knowing she was there to protect me and keep me safe. 
Tonight being opening night, I feel the normal jitters creeping into my stomach. I am faced with the challenge of playing a part on stage and also covering a french horn part in the pit. But I am at ease because I know something very important: even if my stage make up has long since expired and my character shoes are way too smaU some things will never change: My mom never misses a performance. 
And although I am no longer the little girl who relies on her mom for everything, it brings a smile to my face when I look out from the stage and see my mom smiling back. My mom is my favorite audience. It's just not the same without her. 
Thanks for coming here, Mom. And thanks for always being there. Now, sit back and eryoy the show. It's a doozie.

PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY 
Black Caucus controls anti-hate rally 
UNIVERSITY PARK 

Black student leaders took control of a Pennsylvania State University-planned anti-hate rally Tuesday at Old Main, where they gained the support of thousands. After the rally, the student leaders led the crowd to the HUB-Robeson Center, where the crowd kept vigil outside a private meeting the students demanded with Penn State President Graham Spanier. After talks broke off at about 10:30 last night, university officials called the students' demands unreasonable and two black student leaders vowed not to eat until their demands were met. Student supporters remained camped out at the HUB late Tuesday night. Black stu­dent leaders were frustrated by the university's slow response to their demands, which included granting more scholarships, restructuring of the affirmative action offices and increasing faculty for the Department of African and African-American Studies. They called for another meeting to convene Wednesday morning.

Texas A&M University students expressed skepticism at a forum Tuesday night that presented preliminary plans for Bonfire 2002. "ls this still a student Bonfire, or is this a Texas A&M Bonfire?" asked Seth Ward, a senior marketing major. Bonfire Steering Committee members presented a draft of a revamped leadership structure that will replace the traditional "pass down," in which student leaders chose their· own successors, with a nomination and committee selection process. Under a pyramid-shaped design, student leaders would report up the chain to a staff Bonfire director. Participants, at the bottom of the pyramid, would sign up for Bonfire work in residence halls and organiza­tions in the first weeks of the fall semester, said Josh Kaylor, student leadership and participation co-chair­man and a junior agricultural development major. Team leaders would be elected to represent their halls or organizations, and group leaders chosen by a selec­tion committee would represent several teams.

University appoints Porod Center director 
Honeywell grants ND $1.28 M 
Special to The Observer 
Wolfgang Porod, a professor of electrical engineering at Notre Dame, has been named director of the University's Center for Nano Science and Technology. 
Established in 1999. the cen­ter explores the fundamental concepts of nanoscience in order to develop unique engi­neering applications using nanoprinciples. Nanoscience and nanoengineering study small devises and device-relat­ed phenomena on a spatial scale of less than one-tenth of a micron, that is, one thou­sandth lhe diameter of a human hair or roughly the size of a hydrogen molecule. The Center is composed of a multi­d is cipli nary team of researchers from the depart­ments of Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering. Computer Science and Engineering, Chemistry and Physics. 
In his new capacity. Porod will coordinate the center's research and educational pro­grams and serve as a focal point for the University's activ­ities in the emerging area of nanoscience and technology. One of the major research ini­tiatives within the center is the concept of computing through Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA). Pioneered at Notre Dame, QCA is a new paradigm for transistorless computing -no electron flow or current. The center is the only research facility in the country addressing nanocom­puting capabilities in this fash­ion. 
A faculty member since 
1986, Porod is the coinvcntor of the QCA concept. His research focuses on solid state physics and its application to electronics; device reliability. degradation and breakdown; quantum devices and architec­tures for nanoelectronics; and the limits imposed by the laws of physics on computation. 
Porod is a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and has authored 270 publica­tions and presentations. He serves on the advisory and program committees of several international meetings and is a reviewer of proposals to the National Science Foundation, NASA and several technical journals. 
The center's new director also is a founding member of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society Technical Committee on Nanoelectronics and Gigascale Systems. He has received numerous awards, most recently the Ruth and Joel Spira Teaching Award from the College of Engineering. 
Porod earned master's and doctoral degrees in theoretical physics from the Universitiit Graz, (Austria) in 1979 and 1981. 
Formerly the center's associ­ate director. Po rod replaces Gerald J. Iafrate, who is leav­ing Notre Dame to join the fac­ulty of North Carolina State University in a senior endowed position to promote research programs and curriculum in nanoscience and engineering. Although he will no longer be a Notre Dame faculty member, Iafrate will continue collabo­rating with colleagues from the College of Engineering. 
. University will gain 5 fellowships, research fund, technical liaison 
Special to The Observer 

Notre Dame has entered into a five-year agreement for a $1,280.000 grant from Honeywell International I n c . , through i t s Aircraft Landing Systems business in South Bend, for doctoral fellow­ships, research and a visiting pro­fessorship in its Center for Molecularly Engineered Materials. 
The agreement initiates a long-term research alliance between Honeywell and Notre Dame. 
"This research alliance between Honeywell and Notre Dame brings together an outstanding company in the aerospace industry and an outstanding community of faculty and researchers," said Notre Dame President Father Edward Malloy. "We are confident that this rela­tionship will prove wonder­fully beneficial to the University, the company, and the region in which we mutually reside."

"It's one of our best clubs," Hagan said. "They've had an event every weekend this year and next year they're going to add other events." 
In general. Hagan explained. when the CCC determines how much money to allocate clubs, it considers factors such how much money clubs currently have in their accounts and what the CCC believes realistic for clubs to be able to do next year. 
"Usually the clubs that have done a good job this year have a chance of being greal next year," Hagan said. 
Lewis senator Jennie Flannery said it might make sense to allow clubs to see how much money they have been allocated before the senate voted to approve the allocations. 
However, after Hagan pointed out that all clubs have the opportu nity to appeal their allocations, the Senate did not act to delay approving the CCC budget. The CCC has a contingency fund of $15,500 to be used in case of appeals. 
"This is not the end all, be all of money that clubs can get," said Student Union secretary Tai Romero, adding that there are numer­ous sources that clubs can obtain funds necessary for running special events.

Israeli forces ambushed them. 
Four police officers were killed, and six other Palestinians were wound­ed, hospital officials said. 
The Popular Resistance group is associated with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement and has taken responsi­bility for mortar attacks and bombings against Jewish settl.ements and soldiers in the past. 
The Israeli military said it knew nothing about the explosion. 
Fearing Palestinian attacks, Israeli police reinforced by soldiers patrolled in large num­bers in Jerusalem and vacation spots as Israel's Independence day cele­brations began Wednesday. 
In a holiday interview, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said his forces op1Hate inside Palestinian-controlled ter­ritory, known as 'Area A', almost daily. "There is no defense for terrorists because of the fact that they are in Area A," he told army radio. 
Israeli officials spoke of easing restrictions on the Palestinians if seven months of violence wanes. 
One proposal being con­side red is to use the desert oasis town of Jericho as a model, removing travel restric­tions and encouraging business there to return to normal, said an Israeli official, requesting anonymity. 
But until Friday morn­ing, after the indepen­
dence day observance, crossing points between Israel and the Palestinian territories were to be closed tight to prevent attacks, the military said. 
The holiday, marking Israel's 53rd birthday, started with an abrupt transition from the memorial day for soldiers who died in Israel's wars. Soldiers in formation at the Mt. Herzl military cemetery passed symbolic flags from one unit to another, and somber music gave way to fire­works as the festivities began. 
Sharon. meanwhile. confirmed that Arafat had ordered a stop to the fir­ing of mortars at Jewish settlements in Gaza and Israeli villages outside the territory.

DAVENPORT, Iowa 
Amid all the frantic sandbagging and levee building, Davenport's minor Jeague ba,seball team has been forced out of town by high water for the third time in the past decade. 
The Quad-City River Bandits are playing their home games on high­er, drier ground in Illinois, across 

. the swollen Mississippi River. Not that everyone minds -70-year-old John O'Donnell Stadium may have a river view, but it's no field of dreams. Teams hate the locker rooms and the drainage -well, the drainage is lousy. 
Horne plate was floating outside along the first base line Wednesday, slowly moving with the current. Only the tip of the white cover on the pitching mound could be seen through the brown flood­waters. 

Colorful ads on the outfield wall ­Blue Bunny ice cream, AC Delco auto parts and Iowa-American Water Co. -were reflected in about 3 feet of water. "Thirsty?" asks an ad for the bottled water company. 
"It's sad. I can't even put it into words how it makes me feel," said Josh Krueger. 24, who moved from bis home in Fargo, N.D., last November to pursue his lifelong dream of working for a baseball team. Now he and six other team employees are looking for new jobs. 
Dozens of homes across the region have been swamped by floodwaters this spring, fueling debate over whether Davenport should build permanent flood protection. The city is the largest on the upper Mississippi without it. 
The River Bandits have been play­ing home games at Black Hawk College in Moline, 111., where team owner Kevin Krause has floated the possibility of relocating. Ile notes that the team has been washed out before, in 1993 and 1997. 
"Absolutely no revenue coming in. It's devastating from that perspec­tive," he said. "The nominal fans we get to come up to Black Hawk College certainly don't pay the bills." 
Kent Kolwey, Davenport's finance director and acting administrator, said the city would explore the pos­sibility of federal funding to help with floodwall protection for the stadium.

Bush warns China about Taiwan 
trations have been purposely vague on whether the United States would go to war with China over Taiwan. as opposed to arming Taiwan well enough to enable the island to defend itself. 
Bush, who promised a more plain-speaking foreign policy during the 2000 campaign, didn't mince words when asked if he was willing to use military force if China attacked Taiwan. "It's cer­tainly an option." he said. 
He did not directly respond when asked if his position would change if Taiwan should declare independence. 
"I will certainly hope that Taiwan would not do such. Our policy is a one-China poli­cy -that the two nations can resolve their disputes peace­fully," Bush said. "And we made the front-pages of Taiwan's leading newspapers and were broadcast ctt the top of TV newscasts. 


At the State Department, spokesman Philip Hecker was pressed by reporters on whether U.S. policy had changed. 
"Let the president speak for himself." Reeker said. "I think he was very clear on that. And he said, very specifically, nothing has changed in our policy. 
"Our policy hasn't changed today, It didn't change yester­day. It didn't change last year. It hasn't changed, in terms of what we have fol­lowed since 1979 with the passage of the T.iiiwan Relations Act."

Federal energy regulators directed limited price controls on California's wholesale electricity markets Wednesday, but the order fell short of the sweeping price caps California ofl1cials have wanted. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission voted 2-1 to order that wholesale prices be capped in California when electricity reserves fall below 7 percent. triggering an emergency alert by the state's power grid managers. 
FERC chairman Curtis Hebert, a Republican, said the order seeks to "balance" the need to protect against unrea­sonable prices and still encourage investment in power plants and promotion of conservation measures. 
But another commissioner, Democrat William Massey, said the commission's requirement is a "half a loaf solution" to the electricity cri­

power trans­mission group, something the state has not wanted to do. 

"The order turns into a pumpkin and will have no effect" if California does not join the northwest in a joint power transmission system, said Massey. 
The three-member commis­sion struggled all day to craft a price-mitigation plan. Three times, a public hearing on the measure was postponed as behind-the-scene negotiations continued. Finally, the three commissioners emerged and approved the measure, with Massey opposing it. 
Hebert, the Republican chairman, was joined in sup­port of the order by commis­sion er Linda Breathitt, a Democrat. 
Breathitt said that despite Massey's criticism, overall "w.e have reached a consensus that price mitigation should occur" in the California mar­ket. 
Under the order price, con­trols would be triggered only if California grid managers declare a Stage 1 emergency because electricity reserves fell to below 7 percent. 
The FERC staff had recom­
mended that price controls 
occur just in Stage 3 emer 
gencies -the most severe ­
in which there is only a 1.5 
percent reserve and rolling 
blackouts are imminent. 
Massey said the price con­trols should not be triggered by an emergency declaration but should be in effect all the time. "The evidence is persua­sive that the problem [of unfair prices) exists 24 hours a day, seven days a week," Massey said. 
In issuing the order, Hebert reiterated his strong opposi tion to broader price limits based on producers' cost of generation. Reflecting the views of the Bush administra­tion, Hebert said he continues to believe "the best solution to California problems are mar ket-based solutions." 
However, the commission's action reflects growing pres­sure on both FERC and the Bush administration to take additional action to ease the West's power problems, 
Wash., said 

Wednesday night that some price action was a step in the right direc tion but complained that the FERC order "ignores the Northwest, like we floated in the sea." 
Earlier this week, a group of Senate Democrats and one Republican from the Northwest introduced legisla­tion to require FERC to impose broader price caps on electricity markets across the West and peg them to the cost of power production. FERC continues to reject such caps. 
The FERC order focuses pri marily on California and none of the price mitigation requirements would apply to the Northwest, where some wholesale electricity prices have in recent weeks been even higher than those in California. 
However, FERC did direct that an agency investigation on whether some prices have been unreasonably high should be extended from California to other parts of the West. Massey said that inves­tigation is far too narn.w and will be ineffective.

President Bush said Wednesday that U.S. military force is "certainly an option" if China invades Taiwan. 
T h e 
president also cau­tioned Taiwan not to provoke an attack by declar­ing inde­


pendence Bush f r o m Beijing. "I would certain.Iy hope that Taiwan would not do such a thing," Bush said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
And the president said he believes the United States and China will work out their dif­ferences peacefully. "I believe the difficulties can be resolved," he said. 
Bush spoke on the heels of China's detention of 24 U.S. airmen and his decision to sell arms to Taiwan. 
His remarks on Taiwan were an unusually blunt warning to China that the United States is willing to use its military might to uphold the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. That law requires Washington to provide Taiwan with "such defense articles and defense services ... as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capa­bility."

Wildfires cut off road access in Florida Keys 
Associated Press 
KEY LARGO, Fla. 

Highway traflic to and from the Florida Keys flowed freely Wednesday evening after rain dampened a wildfire that reduced visibility and periodi­cally closed the only two roads connecting the island chain to the mainland. 
Highway officials had opened U.S. 1, the main two­lane highway across the Keys, earlier in the day for the first time since Monday, but then closed it again because smoke had ham­pered visibili­ty. 
closed it for just over three hours. 
The two highways separate at Florida City, about 35 miles southeast of Miami, then cross coastal marshland and bridges before recon­necting on Key Largo, where 
U.S. 1 becomes the Overseas Highway for Key West. 
The wildfires were not threatening the area's few structures, but tourism was taking a hit. 
"Our business has dropped a good 40 percent,"said Craig Smith, manager of the Islamorada Fish Company restaurant. "It's killing us." 
Backfires were set to

good rain that soaked a lot of the fire area," said Miami-Dade Fire Chief Lee Stringer. "We don't anticipate any growth in the fire." 
Stringer said it was not likely that U.S. 1 would close again Wednesday night. 
The highway was first closed Monday by a brushfire that has burned across 10,000 acres. 
Earlier Wednesday, the island chain was isolated from the mainland when smoke limited visibility to about a foot on Card Sound Road, and state troopers 
that way on 
Monday. 
Elsewhere in Florida, smoke blew into Gainesville from a 750-acre grass fire in a swampy area. No homes were threatened and the blaze was 60 percent con­tained by Wednesday after­noon, a forestry official said. 
The National Weather Service's forecast through the weekend called for scattered showers and thunderstorms in the southern half of the state. 
Through Tuesday, 2,240 fires statewide had charred 177,410 acres since Jan. 1. 

Bush to compromise on taxes 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON 
For the first time, President 
Bush indicated a willingness 
Wednesday to roughly split the 
difference on tax cuts and asked 
moderate 
Democratic 
senators to 
help boost 
the size of 
the tax 
reduction 
Repub­
licans want 
to push 
through 
Congress. 

Bush lobbied five Senate 
Democrats in the Oval Office 
Wednesday and, in an interview 
with The Associated Press, con­
ceded that Congress would not 
approve the full $1.6 trillion, 10­
year tax cut he has promoted for 
months as the best way to add 
spark to the economy. While the 
House has approved a 2002 bud­
get that included Bush's full tax 
plan, the Senate version limited 
the tax reduction to $1.2 trillion. 
"I want to get it done," Bush 
said, adding, "It's going to be less 
than 1.6 [trillion dollars] and 
greater than 1.2 and we've got to 
figure out how to make it work." 
The president said his priority 
was for the tax package to 
include his plan to reduce 
income-tax rates. 

According to one Republican 
knowledgeable about Bush's 
meetings with Democrats, the 
White House was seeking sup­
port for a $1.34 trillion tax cut 
for 2002 through 2011, a bit less 
than the midway point between 
the House and Senate. In addi­
tion, there would be $60 billion 
more in tax cuts in 2001 aimed 
at quickly stimulating the econo­
my. 

Bush spent much of the morn­
ing, along with Vice President 
Dick Cheney and other White 
House officials, meeting individu­
ally with centrist Democratic senators in hopes of winning their support for a bigger tax reduction than the Senate approved. 

At least initially, moderate Democrats seemed to be resist­ing Bush's offer, indicating that completing a compromise budget could take time. 
One of them, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said he urged Bush "to take a long hard look" at the lesser amount the Senate had approved. 
"He wasn't too happy with that," Baucus said. 
Democrats said they want more of the tax cut distributed to lower-income people than Bush has proposed, plus more spend­ing for agriculture, education, prescription drug benefits and other programs. Bush wants to let spending for many programs grow by 4 percent next year, half the level the Senate approved in its budget and well below recent annual increases. 
"I made it pretty clear I had to see more details of what they would support on the tax cut" and restoring spending cuts Bush proposed in his budget, said Sen. 
is members of that group that the White House is trying to per­suade to go even higher. 
Other moderate Democratic senators who met Wednesday with Bush included Robert Torricelli of New Jersey. Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Max Cleland of Georgia. 
Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who has emerged as the leader of the centrists, had dinner with Bush at the White House Tuesday evening. 
After their visits with Bush, a half-dozen Democratic senators met among themselves. Torricelli said the group agreed "to stay together" in the effort to shape the budget. 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-111., acknowledged the gaps over spending and taxes between the two chambers, say­ing, "Probably somewhere in between is where we're going to come out." 
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., predicted problems for the GOP.

Clinton opens home to donors 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON 
New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton opened her Washington home to Democratic donors for the first time Wednesday, playing host for a fund-raiser to help a cash-strapped Senate colleague. 
About 150 people who paid $1,000 each got only a glimpse of Clinton's $2.8 million Embassy Row home. Guests, who included Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle and Democratic National 
Committee Chairman Terry 
McAuliffe, were taken through the house to a large tent set up in the backyard for white wine and trays of tiny crab cakes, proscuitto and other appetizers. A man 
politely blocked the entrance to 
the yellow living room, and guests did not venture upstairs, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D­Calif. 

At the end of Clinton's street, eight protesters carried signs: "Madame Hillary's house of ill­repute," read one sign. "Count the silverware," read another. 
The event was to help fresh­man Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state retire a hefty campaign debt. Cantwell, who made millions as an Internet executive, lost much of her for­tune when the stock market tum­bled. As of April 1, Cantwell still owed $1.25 million from her Senate campaign, which she largely financed herself.

Official: businessmen plot to oust president

JOHANNESBURG 

South Africa's top law enforcement official has accused three of the coun­try's most pow!)rful busi­nessmen of plotting to oust President Thabo Mbeki.

All have left government in recent years and become successful businessmen. 
"The allegations are not

A statement from Sexwale's family called the accusations "ongoing and unfounded rumors."

Stories of dining hall thieves 
Oh it's that time of year again. Spring: The time for flowers, finals and dining hall amnesty boxes (it's a little-known fact that thousands of Third World refugees seek amnesty from the dining halls each year. Applicants usually receive housing, 
Amy Schill 

political freedom 
and yo-cream). Of 
course, these boxes 
Dazed and

usually remain 
Amused

empty, and if anyone 
actually does turn stuff in, it's quickly snatched up by some­
one who wants to stick it to the man (or just needs some flatware). 
In addition to the boxes, we get the lec­ture about how food services has lost like a billion dollars because we took a mousse goblet. This number seemed slightly high to me, so I decided to do some research on the different kinds of dining hall thievery that you well-bred delinquents partake in. 
As it turns out, despite the number of items reported stolen, many attempts of dining hall theft have failed. The stories I'm about to tell you are absolutely true tales of dining hall theft, trickery and debauchery (you know you've hooked up in the pasta room). Perhaps you can learn what not to do when ripping off our beloved school. 
Case No, 1: The Cup Culprit. Our first hero was having a little get-together one Friday night. He thought it would be just swell to serve some beverages to his friends. but alas, he did not have proper containers for said liquids. So he decided to "borrow" some cups from good old North Dining Hall. 
Since he was actually allowed to bring his backpack into North (cuz they trust us or something), he thought taking a few cups would be simple, right? Think again,

Dame host ROTC on campus?

Sparky. Sure, people do get away with it. but when they go down, they go down panini-style (I have no idea what that means). You know those headphones all the dining hall managers wear? Most of the time, it just makes them look like lost Old Navy employees, but they came in handy in our story of the cup culprit. While our friend clandestinely placed cups in his bag, a distant manager saw him and signaled his fellow mangers that "Operation: Student Stir-Fry" was under­way. 
Suddenly, 15 were up on the poor kid like Father Malloy on a wealthy alumnus with a heart condition. Not only did the guy not get the cups for yo.ur party, but his face is now permanently burned into the minds of every dining hall manager, North or South, past. present or future, until the end of time. He can not make a quesadilla without their knowing gaze upon him, examining his salsa. Remember the cup culprit; remember him. 
Case No. 2: There is no such thing as a free lunch. Our next soul lost her ID card, or maybe she already ate at the dining hall but wants to go again with her friends, or maybe she doesn't even go here. The point is that she's trying to sneak into the dining hall. One popular method is to wait until a large group comes in, then sneak in past them. 
Unfortunately for this girl, dining hall card ladies have roughly six eyes, most of which are located in the back of their head. Trying to get past them, she ends up getting caught and then has to lie to some old woman about how she "just completely forgot about this whole card­swiping business." But dining hall lady has heard this story before, sugar, and she's about to get her bagel toasted. 
Case No. 3: The greatest of all dining hall sins. Everyone knows that the worst 
thing you can ever do is take more than 
one pastry or fruit item out of the dining 
hall. But what if it's technically not more 
than one item? You know what I'm talk­
ing about: Taking a gigantic loaf of bread 
as your one pastry item. You and your 
friends have talked about it since fresh­
man year, but you were always too chick­
en to actually try it. Well, I know a girl 
who tried, who dared, who failed miser­
ably. 
She strolled out of the dining hall, ca<;u­ally carrying the huge mass of carbohy­drates under her arm when she was.. accosted by one of thosr, dining hall ladies. the foot soldiers of food services. 
"Bring that back here!" she shouted. "But il's my one pastry item." "Come back here, you know the rules." The girl then proceeded to lick the loaf of bread, mak­ing the story a legend of dining hall thiev­ery and general idiocy. "Bet you don't want it now." 
"Oh you're in big trouble now, sweet pea." Our heroine then threw the bread at this 70-year-old woman and sprinted for refuge at the nearest dorm. Upon telling her story to friends, they asked in wonder. "How old are you again'?" 
No, bread was not procured that day, but at least someone finally gave the elderly what they deserve: a loaf of bread in the face. 
These arc the martyrs of the dining hall. Learn from their stories. and if you still dare to take that bowl or that extra banana, make sure you have good aim.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Execution darkens commencement speech 
On May 20, President Bush will be giving the commencement address as my classmates and I graduate from this university. It should be among the proudest and happiest of moments for us, our famHies and our friends. It is a select and privileged few who can claim the distinction of having their president bestow the honor of his presence at their graduation. 
Unfortunately. I know that there will forevttbe a shadow darkening this memory for me. Just a few days before we graduate. just a few hours away from campus, Timothy McVeigh will be executed His execution is unique not only because of the enormity of the crime he committed but because he will become the first prisoner to die at the · hands of the federal government since our country reinstated the death penal­ty. Ilis is also a landmark case because an unprecedented number of people will be permitted to witness the execu­tion via closed-circuit television. 
As chief executive, Bush has the power to commute McVeigh's sentence to life in prison. but I hold out very lit­tle hope that he will do so. McVeigh will die in Terre Haute, and a few days later Notre Dame will award an hon­orary doctorate of law to Bush in South Bend. 
Our director of public relations is quoted in the April 18 edition of The Observer as saying, "We think of our­selves as a prominent university and a good forum for the President of the United States to address the nation, and the President coming certainly val­idates that statement." I am disappoint­ed that this school seems to have allowed itself to be dazzled by the pres tige of the occasion. 
Notre Dame seems to have forgotten that not only does it think of itself as a prominent University -it also likes to 
think of itself as a leader in the fight for 
social justice, a center where Christian 
beliefs and values are strong. High 
among these values are the sanctity of · life and forgiveness. Yet McVeigh will 
die at the hands of our government. in 
a spirit of vengeance sanitized with the 
name of "justice." and wounds in need 
of healing will be ripped open during a 
closed-circuit television broadcast. 
Has the University considered the 
ramifications of awarding an honorary 
doctorate oflaws to the president just 
days after a landmark federal execu­
tion takes place? 
1 challenge this university and the 
members of the graduating class not to 
let this pass unnoticed, not to condone 
this with our silence, not to value pres­
tige over our integrity. Prestige is 
based upon how others see you, but 
integrity springs from deep within. and without it, you cannot respect yourself. 
On May 20, when President Bush is giving his commencement address, I will be remembering Timothy McVeigh. I will also be remembering another man, approximately the same age, who was executed as a criminal. I will remember his mother, who watched his execution take place and whose name will appear on my diploma -and on the honorary degree given to the President. 
I will reflect on the irony of the situa­tion. And if I weep at my graduation, I will weep not with joy and pride in my university, but with pain, in solidarity with Our Lady, and with grief for my country and my school.

University fails to give students due respect and trust 
I feel that Brother Jerome Meyer. the rector of Knott Hall, contradict.<; himself when he states that not much studying is going on after 12 a.m. Yet he then continues to say that quiet hours should remain at 12 a.m. so that those who are studying are not bothered. Tell me how that is a reason­able argument. Are people studying past 12 a.m. or are they not? 
This ques­tion of extending parietals boils down to whether the University wants to take some pressure off of thP yoke that is placed upon us. Are we students at a prestigious university? 
YPs. 
Are we held to a higher standard of behavior than most other schools? That's right. We have these things called parietals, and wn have to respect them. 
Most students come here because they want to, and they understand the rules and are willing to follow them. We are all bright, sumewhat responsible young adults. The members of hall staff's across the University might disagree (especially that of Knott Hall, the leading dorm for sending students to the hospital for alcohol abuse. Could Brother Jerome have his reasons?), but our parents obviously had some faith in us since they sent us here. They know us better than any rector ever could or ever will. 
The administration obviously took our recommendations seri­ously. Not to give us one more hour of social time at night with the opposite sex in a secluded environ­ment (i.e. dorm room) socially 
retards us. Most of us went to single 
sex schools so we're pretty much messed up already.

Bush's disdain for life 
Mike Marchand's article is overloaded with administration propaganda. The Bush spin room will be pleased that their efforts are penetrating America's impressionable young minds. 
Mr. Marchand, how do you think the administration is going to pay for its tax cut? Do you really think Professor Walshe's assertion is that far off the mark? You should refrain from making such statements until you've read and understood the thou­sands of pages of budget documents that clearly put programs such as child care, early education, health care and housing on the chopping block. No.t to mention the com­munity health center number you cited is actually a $125 million cut at a time when the number of working Americans without health insurance is increasing. 
A $2,000 health credit doesn't do much good for a family that's left to the whims of the independent insurance market. It costs the average family at least $4,000 a year to purchase health insurance in the indepen­dent market. That is. if the insurers choose to sell a family a policy. Too often insurers use the catch-all exception known as a "pre-existing" condition to refuse the con­sumer's request for a policy. And let's not forget Mr. Bush's disdain for holding the insurance industry accountable when they make medical decisions that harm lives. 
There are so many cuts in this budget that even Mr. Bush's fellow. Congressional Republicans aren't going to endorse all of them. They know that these cuts will harm the people they represent. 
Additionally, Mr. Marchand fails to call the surplus by its correct name: a projected surplus. The Congressional Budget Office cautions that if economic growth rato pro­jections are off by less than 1 percent, the surplus projections would be reduced by $4 trillion dollars, and we could go from sur­plus to deficit overnight. 
We could find ourselves in a position where there's no surplus and we've raided Social Security and Medicare to pay for the tax cut -only this time it's not the 1980s, and we have no time to recover from a recession before the baby-boomers retire and the number of retirees clearlv outnum­bers the workers paying for their.retire­ment. 
But thank goodness the top 1 percent who pay so much in federal taxes get a break. They really need one since over the last sev­eral years they saw their incomes rise by 115 percent. Meanwhile, millions of other hard-working Americans have actually seen their earning power decrease -Mr. Marchand also neglects the fact that mil­
lions of low-working Americans who pay a 
disproportionate amount in payroll taxes 
will see no relief under the Bush plan. And our senior citizens will have to go without a 
Medicare prescription drug benefit. But they don't really need one. They're doing just fine skipping meals and rationing their 
pills in order to afford skyrocketing drug 
bills. 
But at least the United States can be proud to have the same drinking water standards as developing countries like Bangladesh, since Mr. Bush balked at reducing the levels of arsenic so they meet the standards adopted by the European Union and the World Health Organization. (The full impact of Bush's numerous egre­gious environmental policies deserve a sep­arate piece altogether.) 
The University of Notre Dame emphasizes improving the quality of life for our neigh­bors from the womb to the tomb. Some in the University community expressed disdain for the former president's views on _abor­tion. Will this same community remain silent -ignoring the current president's views on the death penalty? 
During his tenure as governor, President Bush presided over more executions than any other state in the union. Governor Bush showed a callousness for life by allotting, on average. only 15 minutes to review death penalty appeals. He also vetoed legislation that would have required that indigent defendants be provided properly trained and qualified representatives. 
Through his hypocritical position on the death penalty, his proposed tax cut which promises to increase the gap between rich and poor and his disregard for environmen­tal protection which will affect the lives of our children and our grandchildren, Mr. Bush has displayed an utter disdain for life that.makes him unworthy of an invitation, let alone an honorary degree from our uni­versity, 
Mr. Marchand and those who would sub­scribe to his views should take another look and reevaluate what the presidency actually stands for and whether his record warrants the opportunity to address the students and receive a degree from the University of Notre Dame.

MOVIE REVIEW 
Time moves backward in engrossing 'Memento' 
By MEG RYAN S,cnc Movie Criti, 
Hailed as the puzzle movie of the year. "Mr·mcnto" leaves viewers walking out of the theatre trying to solve the puzzle of what exactly just happened. 
Based on a short story by British director Christopher Nolan's younger brother, the plot follows Leonard (Guy Pearce, "L.A. Confidential") as he hunts for the man who raped and killed his wife -a difficult task for someone who has no short-term mem­ory. 
When the two men broke into Leonard's home and killed his wife. Leonard received a head injury that prevents him from mak­ing new memories. In order to handle his condition. Leonard writes himself notes, takes Polaroid photos, and tattoos impor­tant facts all over his body. 
Helping Leonard on his quest are Teddy lJoe Pantoliano, "The Matrix") and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss, also from "The there.

Then the movie cut5 to the scene that: 111 the storyline. precedes the one priot to the phone conversation. As each scene begins, viewers have no idea what is happening iu the story. but they do know that the scene will somehow end where the last scene began. IL's as if each viewer feels what it's like to be Leonard, who also usu­ally has no idea what's going on at the bei.,rinning of each scene, because he can't remember. 
For example. there's a scene where he "wakes up" running, and he doesn't know if' he's the one being pursued or the pur­suer. Another time he wakes to find a man tied up in his closet, and he hasn't the faintest idea who the man is or how he got Leonard's condition. This 
scene's placement gives 
"Memento" an original edge without even considering the content. 
"Memento" also provides its viewers with a very different viewing experience. Instead of trying to predict the lilm's end­ing, the audience must try figure out how it all began (i.e. why Leonard killed Lim man and how he discovered the man was his 
wife's killer). 
An immense amount of concentration is requirnd to follow the plot as it twisl'l back­wards, and the audience doesn't know whom to trust or whom to bnliew. They rely on Leonard's instincts to guid,~ tlH'rn, but the question to keep in mind is: Can Leonard himself be trusted? This µuzzlP isn't an easy one to solve. 
Like movies such as thR "The Usual Suspects" and "The Sixth Sensn," tlrn dues begin to fall into place as the story comes racing towards iLc; end; or, in "Merncinto's" ca,;e, its beginning.

By MATT NANIA and JUDE SEYMOUR Scene Movie Critics 
Love it or hate it, the summer movie sea­son is on its way. From talking apes ("Planet of the Apes"] to a couple of stoners ("Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"), Hollywood is pulling out all the stops in hopes of obtaining box office glory. Herc is a quick look at 10 of the summer's biggest diversions. 
"The Mummy Returns" (May 4) 
Players: Directed by Stephen Sommers; starring Brendan Fraser. Rachel Weisz and The Rock 
Buzz: Summer doesn't officially begin until June 21. but that's not stopping Universal Pictures from releasing this spe­cial effects extravaganza weeks before­hand. After hearing the "ka-ching" of box office success with 1999's 'The Mummy," Universal immediately put the sequel into development. from the looks of the trailer, 'The Mummy Returns" is a louder, bigger, CGl-intoxicated version of the original, complete with epic battle scenes, explo­sions and flying corpses. Add to that the fact that it's rated PG-13 (meaning kids can go) and co-stars ½'WF's The Rock, and you've got a blockbuster destined to open the summer movie season with a bang. 
"Pearl Harbor" (May 23) 
Players: Directed by Michael Bay !"Armageddon"); starring Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale 
Buzz: If you've been to the multiplex in the past three months. you've seen the trailer for "Pearl Harbor." Everyone is talk­ing about this movie. With a budget upwards of $150 million, this epic war/love story looks to have a fantastic. 30-minute­long attar,k sequence that will put viewers in the thick of the battle. But like another cinematic account of a major historical event, "Titanic," "Pearl Harbor" will prob­ably have the scope. but not. the intelli­gcncc, of a great film epic (there's a love triangle among the main characters lhat could get in the way of good storytelling). Touchstone Pictures solidified Memorial Day weekend for its release: and "Pearl Harbor" will no doubt own the box office for a good two or three weeks. 
"Moulin Rouge" (June 1) 
Players: llirected by Haz Luhrmann ("Romeo and Juliet"); starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor 
Buzz: Set at the turn of the 20th Century, this free form musical follows a young poet as he enters th<' amoral. bohemian world of club l\loulin Houge. An electric aLmos­phere of sex, drugs and music sets "Moulin Rouge" apart from typical summer pic­tures. But utilizing contemporary music in a period setting (contributors include Beck, Fatboy Slim) may confuse conservative viewers looking for a straight-up musical. But for those interested in seeing film pushed beyond its boundaries, "Moulin Rouge" will offer its own brand of summer entertainment. 
"Tomb Raider" (June 15) Players: Directed by Simon West ("Con Air"); starring Angelina Jolie 
Buzz: Based on the immensely popular Playstation video game, "Tomb Raider" will bring some old summer familiars to the screen: Guns, high-flying action and eye catching apparel. The movie will (hopefully) provide a compelling back-story for the previously pixHated character, sending her on a new journey to recover plenty of booty from the Arctic to South America. If the filmmakers can keep the rating at PG-13 or below, expect a big flux ofmovie patrons come June 15. 
"A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" (June 29) 
Players: Directed by Steven Spielberg; starring Haley Joe Osment and Jude Law 
Buzz: Any movie that has Spielberg's name attached to it creates an insane amount of buzz. Having a John Williams score and containing the return "Saving Private Ryan's" cinematographer adds to that, as does the late. great Stanley Kubrick ("A.I." is based on his treatment). As if this wasn't enough, the marketing team launched a frenzy of "Blair Witch" proportions when its trailer incorporated a credit of "Sentient Machine Therapist" for "Jeanine Salla." Typing in Salla's name on a Web engine launches a tangled weave of sites dedicated to propagandizing the fic­tional narrative of the movie. "A.I." is now hyped through the clues on these sites, which is just another reason why Spielberg is set to make millions from this Amblin­Kubrick production, the plot of which has been kept tightly under wraps. 
"The Score" (July 13) 
Players; Directed by Frank Oz ("l:lowfinger"); starring Hobert DeNiro, Edward Norton and Marlon Brando 
Buzz: Does a film that ·stars DeNiro, Norton anr! Brando, each considered the best actor of his generation, need any buzz'? The real question is the by-the-num­bers story: An older thief lDeNirol is all set to retire and live off the spoils of his loot when a younger thief (Norton) blackmails him into doing one last heist. The actors themselves no doubt attracted each other to the project, but a decent storv would have been nice. Brando's career has floun­dered recently (for the past two decades, in fact), but he still retains his legendary sta­tus. Therefore, there are three exceptional reasons to see ''The Score" this summer. 
"Jurassic Park 3" (July 20} 
Players: Directed by Joe Johnston ("Jumanji"); starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Tea Leoni and William H. Macy 
Buzz: Steven Spielberg has opted out of the third installment of the "Jurassic Park" series. but the main stars of the first two movies, Neill and Dern, have come back. The plot sounds weak (another island full of the extinct species courtesy of InGen), but with dinosaurs controlling the action it should prove terrifying. But if the dinosaurs aren't cutting it, look to the usual great acting from Neill, Dern and Macy to at least inject funny witticisms into their situation. Hopefully, this movie will erase all memories of"The Lost World." 
"America's Sweethearts" (July 20) 
Players: Directed by Joe Roth; written by Billy Crystal; starring John Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts and Christopher Walken 
Buzz: The plot of "Sweethearts" centers around a high profile celebrity act­ing couple that has broken up but are stuck doing publicity for the last film they made together -all the while their publicist is trying to make everyone believe they're just as happy together as they ever were. In the year of Tom and Nicole's messy breakup, this movie should be a satirical look at a usual­ly sensitive process. The film's direc­tor was responsible for producing "Tomcats," but the acting of Cusack and the writing of Crystal should be impetus enough to see "Sweeihearls" come July. 
"Planet of the Apes" (July 27) 
Players: Directed by Tim Burton ("Sleepy Hollow"); starring Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter 
Buzz: Burton has a way of creal. ing brand new cinematic worlds, and although "Planet of the Apes" is a remake of the original Charlton Heston-starring cult classic, he will no doubt give audiences an eyeful of visual splt>ndor within a tale unique to big budget blockbusters. The make-up effects by multi-Oscar win­ner Rick Baker look outstanding, and the trailer is action-heavy, which suggests the film will please most of its targeted audience. Let's just hope there is none of the rumored "monkey-love" between Wahlberg and Carter. 
_.., 
"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" (Aug. 10) 
Players: Directed by Kevin Smith; star­ring (among many others) Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith 
Buzz: Thanks to the View Askew Web universe (View Askew is the name of Smith's production company). all Kevin Smith movies carry a significant amount of buzz before they open. "Jay and Silent Bob" will prove no different, as the fourth installment of the famed Jersey Trilogy will reach its final chapter {even though a fourth chapter of a three part series sounds wrong, the director has promised it's going to be worth it). The stars of teenager movies past and present will be making contributions {think along the lines of James Van Der Beek and Jason Biggs). And with a host of SNL cast members. this movie simply cannot be missed. "Jay and Silent Bob" will most likely be seen by a large gathering of teenage kids, willing to recite line after line of Smith's witty dia­logue just moments after viewing the film.

AMERICAN LEAGUE 

Surging Minnesota rallies to·down Boston 6-4 
Associated Press 
Torii Hunter hit a three-run double in the 10th-inning as the surprising Minnesota Twins rallied for a 6-4 win over the Boston Red Sox. 
The Twins tied the game in the ninth on back-to-back doubles by Jacque Jones and 
A.J. Pier.lynski against Hod Beck (0-1), then won for the sixth time in seven games. 
Minnesota. leads the AL Central at 15-4 after posting the worst record in the league last year. Boston fell to 14-7 and into a first-place tie with Toronto in the AL East. 
Bob Wells (2-0l got out of a jam in the bottom of the ninth ·with a runner at third. Latroy lla«rkins pitched the 10th for his sixth save after allowing Manny Ramirez's

--run-scoring groundout. Matt Lawton st.arted the 10th with a sin­gle, took second on Denny Hocking's sacri­fice and stayed there on a walk to Corey Koskie. Pete Schourek replaced Beck and got David Ortiz to pop out but walked Doug Mientkiewicz to load the bases. Rolando Arrojo replaced Schourek and Hunter hit a hard grounder between third baseman Shea Hillenbrand and the foul line for the bases-clearing double. The Red Sox were one out away from a win after Beck retired the first two Twins in the ninth. Then Jones lifted a double to left field that Troy O'Leary just missed catching. Pierzynski's double off the left­field wall tied the game. 
That left two of baseball's best starters without a decision after pitching seven innings each. 

Pedro Martinez struck out 10 for the third time this season, allowed two runs, six hits and two walks. For the Twins, Brad Radke struck out two. walked none and gave up three runs and eight hits. 
The Red Sox had snapped a 2-2 tie with a two-out rally in the sixth, Ramirez doubled after Radke retired the previous 11 hitters, then scored on O'Leary's single. 
Ramirez. who has reached base in all 21 of Boston's games, scored just before O'Leary was thrown out when he rounded first base too far. 
The Twins lost Tuesday night's series opener 9-4. but Wednesday's game figured to be closer with Martinez pitching against Radke. Martinez's ERA rose from 1.61 to 
1.80 while Radke's went from 2.23 to 2.52. 
Boston led 2-0 after its first two batters as Trot Nixon doubled and Jose Offerman hit his first homer of the year. But Radke retired the next three batters. 
Martinez struck out five Twins in the first two innings, but they scored in the second when Hunter walked, took second on a grolllldout and came home on Pierzynski's double. 
Minnesota tied it in the fifth. Jones sin­gled and reached second when O'Leary misplayed the ball for an error. Jones reached third on Pierzynski's sacrifice bunt and scored on Luis Rivas' single. 
The Twins threatened in the sixth but left runners at first and second, and Martinez retired the side in order in the seventh. 
Mariners 7, Yankees 5 
Carlos Guillen drove in three runs with a pair of two-out hits as the Seattle Mariners beat the New York Yankees for their sixth straight win. 
The Mariners, despite the offseason loss of Alex Rodriguez. have won 10 of 11 and lead the majors with a 17-4 record. 
Guillen, who entered the game hitting .17 5 with seven RBIs as Rodriguez's replacement at shortstop, gave Seattle a 6­5 lead in the sixth with an RBI single. He also had a two-run single in a four-run sec­ond and tripled in the eighth to finish 3-for­4. 
The Mariners have won the first two games of the three-game series, the first meeting between the teams since last year's AL championship series. The three­time defending World Series champion Yankees are 11-10. 
Ichiro Suzuki was 2-for-5 with two RBIs to raise his average to .355. Suzuki, the leading hitter in the Japanese Pacific League the last seven years. followed Guillen's go-ahead hit in the sixth with an RBI single to center off Andy Pettitte (3-2). 

Jeff' Nelson got the final out in the eighth in his first appearance against New York since returning to Seattle as a free agent. He helped the Yankees win four titles in five years as their right-handed setup man. 
Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched the ninth for his major league-leading 11th save. 
New York tied it at 5 in the fifth on Bernie Williams' sacrifice fly and Jorge Posada's two-run double down the left-field line. Scott Brosius and Chuck Knoblauch opened the inning with walks off starter John Halama, and Derek Jeter singled off Norm Charlton (1-0) to load the bases for Williams. 
After Pettitte struck out the side in the first inning, the Mariners took advantage of two errors and a two-out walk to score four unearned runs in the second. 
Guillen singled in two runs with a drive to left that got under right-fielder Paul O'Neill's glove, allowing another run to score. Suzuki followed with an RBI single. and John Olerud added a sacrifice fly in the third to make it 5-0. 
Brosius. whose throwing error helped set up Seattle's big inning, hit a leadoff homer in third, and New York pulled within three on Michael Coleman's sacrifice fly in the fourth. 
Pettitte, who came within one out of a shutout against Boston in his last start, allowed seven runs N three earned N and seven hits in six innings. 
Toronto 8, Texas 5 
Brad Fullmer hit a three-run homer and added a go-ahead infield single in the eighth inning to lead the Toronto Blue Jays over the Texas Rangers. 
Fullmer homered in the first off Kenny H.ogers (1-2) in the first, and put the Blue Jays ahead 6-5 in the eighth following a one-walk to RauJ Mondesi, who took third on a a two-out infield single by Jose Cruz Jr. that went off Rogers' glove past second baseman Handy Velarde, who may have been distracted by the runner. 
Fullmer then singled to left side of the infield and beat the throw from shortstop Alex Rodriguez. helping sent the Blue Jays to their fifth straight win over Texas. 
Darrin Fletcher added a two-run single off H.ogers, who gave up eight runs eight hits in 7 2-3 innings.

less able to close the game out and preserve Dufrs second win of the season. 
Afterward, Mainieri was very pleased with Duff's performance. 
"He's been an important pitch­er for us all year and I think he showed really good stuff tonight," Mainieri said. 
The second game got off to a decidedly less auspicious start. Both teams jumped on the board early, with Valparaiso's Mark Pedersen knocking an RBI single oIT pitcher Mike Naumann, and Sollman scoring on a sacrifice fly for the Irish. 
As the game progressed, how­ever, it became clear that the Crusader's starting pitcher, Adam Paetznick, was baffling the Irish hitters. 
Usually, a J.V. hurler, Pactznick entered the game with a mere 2.2 innings under his belt, while sporting a hefty 13.50 ERA. 
It might as well have been Greg Maddux on the mound though, as the Irish could man­age only one run and two hits over Paetznick's first six innings of work. 
Meanwhile, Naumann and reliever Matt Laird each yielded two runs in four and three innings respectively. 
Mer the seventh inning come­back fell short, Mainieri made it very clear that poor hitting was to blame for the loss. 
"Mike Naumann isn't going to overpower anyone, but he gave us four good innings. Our hitters weren't able to back him up tonight," Mainieri said.

No. 9 Irish sweep Toledo with 11-0, 1-0 shutouts 
By PETER FRASSO Sports Writer 
In what has recently become as sure as the sun rising every morning. the Irish softball team won again Wednesday afternoon, sweeping a 
home double­header against Toledo, by scores of 11-0 and 1-0. 
The Irish ran their consecutive wins streak to 25 with the two shutouts. Both 


Irish starters, Sharron Jen Sharron and Kristin Schmidt, combined to allow only one hit, with Schmidt pitching a no-hitter, the first of her career. The pitching staff has put together five consecutive shutouts. "They've been doing that kind of job all year," said coach Liz Miller. enjoy­ing the recent run of pit.ching that has lowered the team ERA to 0.88. Earlier in the day, the updated national rankings were released, ranking Notre Dame at No. 9, the highest ranking in the program's his­tory. and the first appearance in the top 10. The two games were totally differ­ent, as the first game was dominated by the offensive explosion of Notre Dame, while the second was a pitch­ing duel between Schmidt and Rockets pitcher Colette McMasters. Offensively, the stars were Jarrah

Myers, who went 3-for-3 with a home run, two runs scored and two RBIs, and Lizzy Lemire, who went 2-for-3, including a triple and a walk-off grand slam, which lead to the umpires invoking the eight-run mercy rule. 
"I was just looking to swing hard, looking to get the ball into the out­field." said Lemire. "I didn't even realize we only needed one run to win." 
On the pitch before the grand slam, Toledo pit.cher Kristy Kassotis threw a wild pitch that would have normally scored Danielle Klayman, on third at the time. 
"After the game she [Klayman] told me she didn't score because she knew Lizzy was going to hit that grand slam," Miller said. 
Game one pitcher Sharron allowed onJy one hit and struck out six. 
In game two, the obvious star was Schmidt, who struck out a personal best 15 and walked one. 
"I think it was one of my better per­formances," Schmidt said. "I was looking at each hitter, not focusing on the game all at once. I tried to make every pit.ch to every hitter count." 
"It really took the performance of pitching that no-hitter to win the game," Miller said. 
Alexis Madrid drove in the only run of the game on a single in the fifth. 
Notre Dame resumes its Big East portion of its schedule this weekend, with two doubleheaders at home against Boston College and Providence on Saturday and Sunday respectively. Both will be played at Ivy Field.

NBA 
League hits Cuban with fine after bizzare antics 
Associated P ,e.. 
Add blowing kisses to the list of unusual antics by Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. 
Cuban, who has been fined $505,000 thic; season for everything from running on the court to sitting beside it, blew a kiss to Utah coach Jerry Sloan in the closing minutes of Tuesday night's playoff game, won by the Jazz. 
"Some guy was yelling and I found out that it was Cuban," Sloan said Wednesday. "Some guy yells at me, I'm probably going to yell back. Had I known it was him. I probably wouldn't have yelled,&'s a pow· erful guy." 
The billionaire fan-turned-owner was visibly and vocally upset throughout the Mavericks' 109-98 loss, which put Dallas down 0-2 in the best-of-five series. 
At halftime, Cuban went on TBS to question a refer­ee's call. He also sat on press row and screamed at sideline personnel about how the game clock was being operated. 
Then. during a time out with 2:54 left. he pounded the press table and shouted. Sloan. who was about 35 feet away, replied, "What's your problem?" 
Cuban said Wednesday that his comments were not directed at the Jazz coach. 
"I never said a word to him. Not a single word," Cuban said. "I was trying to get a clarification on why there was a jump ball after an inadvertent whistle with time left on the shot clock. 
"The rules say that if there is time left on the clock, it's considered a suspension of play and play resumes at that point. I got the explanation from the ref, who was kind enough to take the time. Afterward, I looked over and Jerry was cursing at me. I was kind of sur­prised, but I didn't say a word back, just blew him a

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 

Henderson breaks Ruth's -walks record 
Anociated Prus 
The Man of Steal is about to lift a record from the Sultan of Swat. 

Rickey Henderson, who's usu­ally in a head­first hurry. took a leisurely stroll to first base Tuesday night and tied Babe Ruth's major league rec~ of 2,0o2 walks. 
Always able to inject a bit of swagger into the moment. Henderson, 42, took off his batting helmet and waved to the cheering crowd as a small burst of fireworks went off. 
The San Diego Padres' sixth­inning rally against Philadelphia fizzled and the slumping Henderson, in as a pinch-hitter in the 12-7 loss, walked back to the dugout, con­tent for the time being to be tied with Ruth. 
The walks record might seem somewhat mundane next to Henderson's many other accomplishments. but it's notable for a pretty big reason -the Babe. 
"The name comes to mind and you think about the great-


est baseball player that played the game, the guy that probably kept this game alive for so many years," said Henderson, who's been baseball's career stolen base leader for a decade. 
"He's Mr. Baseball. Once you get in the category of a Babe Ruth, it means that you went out and you did the best job you can do." 
Henderson would have owned the record earlier if not for a statistical adjustment by the commissioner's office in 1999 that added six walks to Ruth's total. 64 years after his last game. 
Henderson, who drew the record-tying walk off reliever Chris Brock, put that in per­spective like only he can. 
"I always wonder. where did he get those walks?" Henderson said. "It was a theory that Babe rose again and went back out there and they gave him six more intentional walks because they were still afraid to pitch to him. 
"He got a few more walks, so we just laughed about it." 
Tony Gwynn, who like Henderson is a probable Hall of Farner, laughs too, but only because his teammate's latest milestone seems a bit surreal. 
"Babe Ruth is like the icon of this game," Gwynn said. "To be chasing one of his records, man, it's hard to put it in per­spective."

really need them there. Your legs feel heavy and your arms feel slow, and you just want to get done." 
Mulligan found inspiration for training in her Pasquerilla. West roommate. Irish women's basketball team member Imani Dunbar, who sent out an all-call to the dorm and hung banners announcing Rene's impres­sive Boston performance. 
"I though, 'If lmani can win a national champi­onship. then I sure better run my best in a marathon,'" said Mulligan. "I learned a lot from her about going for your dreams." 
Beginning her 18-week training program for Boston on December 11th, Mulligan followed the Hal Higden pro­gram, which includes three 20-mile runs. 
"I feel like I learned a lot of lessons in the process [of training)," Mulligan said. 
"I learned how to be more flexible, how to stick to a program. and how deal with things like when you wake up in the morning and it's so icy you can't even walk," said Mulligan, who only deviated from her outdoor training regimen to run inside or use a treadmill twice during the bitter South Bend winter. 
She wasn't alone for all those miles. Graduate stu­dent Franklin Harkins. junior Brigid Curry, senior Jenny Hinckman and sopho­more Nora Langer braved the cold with Mulligan. Fitting running into a sched­ule was just as challenging as dealing with the weather for Mulligan, who is a PLS major and also works at the 
csc. 
"I apologize to my teachers for the times I was dozing in class this semester," Mulligan said. "Sometimes I chose running over sleep, staying out later with friends or getting that reading done before class." 
Mulligan and Hinckman are the founders of the Notre Dame Women's Running Club, which had only three members when they started it their fresh­man year. and now is up to over 30. 
"Running is a way to expe­rience the world wherever you are. That's why I think runners get so addicted to it," said Mulligan, who stud­ied in Dublin last year and is considering doing volunteer work next year in Peru for the Christian Brothers vol­unteers. 
"I ran in Ireland. in Spain. and in St. Louis when I went to watch lmani win the national championship. I ran in Boston. It's a constant wherever I go,'' Mulligan said.

It's never too early to say Goodbye 
by Fr. Bill Wack, CSC 

Another school year is winding down. For those of us who live here and are planning on staying or returning in the fall, it's sad to see a lot of you move on. At the same time, though, che summer offers us a welcome respite from the daily work here. We don't have to leave the place behind for good yet and pack up all our stuff. For the seniors and other graduating students, however, it's a different story. You have to say "goodbye" to all that is familiar here at ND.. 
When I was a senior (way back in '89) I thought leaving would be a snap. After all, I was going home to live with my parents again for the summer -and chat commute was all of 5 minutes from campus! Plus, I knew that I was probably going to come back to study Theol­ogy after a year away. How hard could it be to leave the place? 
Because I didn't think it was anything momentous, I never really said 'goodbye' to any­
one. My favorite line during 

My favorite line during April and April and May was, 'TU see you 
before I go, so I won't say

May was, "I'll see you before I go, 
'goodbye' right now." Even 

so I won't say 'goodbye' right now." 
during finals I used chat line a 

Even during finals I used that line

graduation, I found myself alone in 
At Commencement, while 

my section in the dorm, gathering 
listening to the speaker drone on up my belongings. Everyone else about life after school, I was had already left. telling people around me, "I'll see you after the ceremony and we'll say 'goodbye' later". Then, about an hour after graduation, I found myself alone in my section in the dorm, gathering up my belongings. Everyone else had already left. It's true: I did end up seeing a handful of them again (and I still hang out with a few today). Also, I did return to campus for another degree. Still, I'm really sorry I didn't get to say, "thanks", or "goodbye" or ''I'll miss you" to those in my dorm and in my classes to whom I had grown close. It seemed easier to avoid all that unpleasantness at the time, but I regret it now. It's hard to say "goodbye." It sounds so dramatic; so FINAL. We're always putting it off, hoping that this won't be the last time we'll see each other. But now is the best time. We 
have a couple of weeks together so we should take advantage of it. I'm not saying you need to have a heart-to-heart with everyone in your hall and in your classes. For most people maybe a "see-ya" will work as you stroll out of here. But what about those students, faculty, and staff 
members here who have made ~n impact on your life? 
I would urge you to let people around you know how you feel about them. Even though you may end up seeing them a hundred more times between now and May 20, do it. I can't imagine you'd ever regret it. And maybe that will inspire others to tell you how you have touched them while you've been here. 
This is a great time to schedule an appointment with a professor who taught you some­time during your career and tell her/him what their class meant to you. Talk to your rector (who may or may not be returning in the fall) and tell him/her how much you appreciate what they have done for you. Don't forget your friends i_n the hall or on campus who have helped to shape you into the person you are today. 
There's no getting around it: it's difficult to leave here. Even ifyou have been counting down the days and arc glad to be leaving, the memories will always stay with you, and you will most likely find yourself daydreaming about being back here several rimes a day in the immediate future. You have the opportunity now to help yourself and others make char transition a little easier. 
For you who are leaving, know chat we who remain (as well as those who leave with you) will keep you in our rhoughts and prayers. It is one of the greatest blessings to get to know so many of you during our brief stay here. Your enthusiasm, your faith, your passion for life, and your joyful spirit inspire me. Thanks, and may God go with you!

NFL 
Injuries end Enis' career 
 Running back suffers from knee degeneration 
Associated Pre._. 
Six weeks ago, Curtis Enis had a chance to start his career over. Now, it's come to an end. 
The 24-year-old Enis. a for­mer first-round draft pick who had hoped to resurrect his career with the Cleveland Browns, said Wednesday he is retiring from football because of a degenerative condition in his left knee. 
Enis was signed by the Browns on March 13 after three disappointing seasons with the Chicago Bears. He said he had been considering retirement for some time and finalized his decision after the Browns recent minicamp. 

I 
"It's tough," Enis said. "But it's just a part of the game. You come in with so much promise and high hopes of doing well and the injury just wouldn't let it happen." 
r~ 
When he signed with the Browns, who averaged an NFL-worst 3.2 yards per 
carry last season, Enis had been optimistic he would be 
r able to restart his once­
J promising career. He didn't
I appear to be bothered by the injury during the Browns minicamp, but he also didn't have the same explosiveness as he did as a breakaway threat in college. Enis, the fifth overall pick in the 1998 NFL draft and the 1993 AP Mr. Football in Ohio, was a holdout as a rookie and made one start before tearing a ligament in his left knee that November. In his second season, Enis rushed for 916 yards in 12 starts, but averaged just 3.2 yards per carry. Last season. the Bears asked him to put on more weight, and he came to camp weighing 245 pounds. Chicago then moved him to fullback, where he gained 84 yards on 36 car­ries. Enis said he informed Browns coach Butch Davis of his decision Wednesday and that his formal retirement would likely be announced Friday. "It's been a tough thing,"Enis said. "But I'm at a point in my life when l have to start thinking about other things." Enis said he plans to return to Penn State to complete his degree in Commercial Tourism and Recreation and Park Management. He said he has one full semester remain­ing. Enis ranks third on the career rushing list at Penn State with 3,256 yards and is second with 36 touchdowns. The Browns drafted run­ning back James Jackson of Miami in the third round of last weekend's NFL draft and are still considering making an offer to Corey Dillon, a restricted free agent running back with the Cincinnati Bengals.

Deadmarsh to face former team in series

Thursday night at the Pepsi Center. 
"The twins are doing really well," Deadmarsh said Wednesday. "It is a perfect situ­ation to come home. We wanted to move on in the playoffs, and to come here is perfect." 
Because of his popularity and production in Colorado, Deadmarsh is sure to be well received when he takes the ice. Personal feelings have been put aside as friendships take hiatus during the Stanley Cup chase. 
"Deader moved on, and hey, we moved on as well," Avalanche coach Bob Hartley said. "This is the playoffs." 
Deadmarsh, who helped Los Angeles to a 13-4-5 record over the final six weeks of the sea­son, earned a chance to play against his former team by scoring the game-winning goal in the Kings' 3-2 victory over the Detroit Rod Wings on Monday night. 
The overtime goal capped a stunning four-game run by Los Angeles, which lost the first two games of its first-round series and trailed 3-0 late in the third period of Game 4 before rally­ing for another overtime victo­ry. 
'Tm trying to work hard." Deadrnarsh said. "I have adjust­ed. I have settled in with a great bunch of guys. They made it an easy transition for me. We've had a good run to get into the playoffs. Now we are here, and we want to keep it going." 
The Avalanche. meanwhile, have been idle for a week since completing a four-game sweep of Vancouver last Wednesday. 
Like Deadmarsh, Blake played a vital role in helping the Avalanche advance to the conference semifinals. He 
counter the 
Canucks' 
physical strat­egy. 
The performance came after Blake missed eight of the final nine regular-season games with a sprained knee. 
"At first, it was real difficult because you want to prove yourself," he said. "You want to make sure that everything that was done was done for the right reasons, and then all of a sud­den, you're injured and you can't play. You can't practice. The guys go on the road, you're left behind."

Saint Mary's ends MIAA play with split with Kalrunazoo 
By MOLLY McVOY 
Senior StaffWri1er 
In their last conference matchup of the season, Saint Mary's split a doubleheader against Kalamazoo, losing 1-0 and winning 2-1. 
"Even though we lost the first game. it was a good way to end our conference season," said senior starting pitcher Anne Senger. "We really played well." 
Both games belonged to the pitchers, with a total of four runs scored in both games. Senger pitched the first game, where she went six innings, giving up one run on four hits. 
The Belles first and only hit came in their first at bat of the game. when Melissa Hayes hit a single to start the game. 
"We did hit the ball," bead coach John Kovach said. "They [Kalamazoo] made some nice defensive plays against us. We just couldn't get anything going." 
"We hit the ball really hard, but we didn't hit in the gap," Senger said. "We played really well on defense, though. In the first game, our defense played exceptionally well." 
The Belles put together more runs in the second game and pulled it out 2-1. Kalamazoo took the early lead with one run in the third inning. Saint Mary's came back and scored one to even it up on a sacrifice fly by Marnie Walsh. Hayes scored on the sacrifice fly to make the score 1-1. 
Neither team scored a run until the sixth inning. In the inning, Walsh doubled and sophomore Susan Kutz walked to put runners on first and second. A double steal moved the runners to second and third. After another walk, Erin Sullivan hit a sacrifice fly to bring home Kutz. 
Freshman Libby Wilhelm pitched the second game and gave up six hits and no earned runs. Kalamazoo scored their one run on an error in the third. 
"After losing such a close game its easy to get down on yourselves," Kovach said. "We did hit the ball hard enough to realize we were going to eventually put something together." 
Kalamazoo put together a scoring scare in the seventh when they had two runners on base with one out. Kalamazoo's lead-off hitter knocked a shot that looked like a single to center. Sullivan chased it down and threw the runner out at third base. A fielder's choice ended the scor­ing threat. 
"Kutz did a good job moving the pitches in and out, and we had only one walk in both games," Kovach said. "The defense played really solid." 
The Belles close out their season at Goshen College on Saturday. Their loss to Kalamazoo took them out of con­tention for the MIAA playoffs.

Helmet worn during fatal play under scrutiny by lawsuit 
A.;sociatcd Press 
BOISE. Idaho 

A federal lawsuit alleges an Illin!)iS manufacturer ignored safety defects in the football helmet that Boise State freshman Paul Reyna wa.s wearing when he suffered a fatal head injury 20 months ago. 
The wrongful death complaint was filed April 17 in U.S. District Court on behalf of Reyna's mother, Carolyn Guzman of La Puenta, Calif.

Reyna, 19, died live days later in a Boise hospital of what the lawsuit said was a "traumatic laceration of the coro­nal vein, leading to an acute subdural hematoma, leading to brain-stem com­pression, causing his death."

Wolff nets gallle winner for Terun USA 
Associated Press 
Josh Wolfrs timing couldn't have been any better. 
The sparkplug for the United States in World Cup qualifying this year was about to be replaced Wednesday night. But off a corner kick, he knocked home a rebound for a 1-0 victo­ry over Costa Rica. 
Wolff's goal and the steadfast goalkeeping of Kasey Keller gave the Americans a strangle­hold on qualifying in the North and Central American and Caribbean region. The Americans are 3-0, with victo­ries over Mexico, Honduras and Costa Rica, considered their staunchest competition in the race for three spots in the 2002 World Cup. 
Before a crowd of 37,319, the largest ever for soccer at Arrowhead Stadium, the United States extended its home unbeaten streak in World Cup qualifying to 18. The last loss was in 1985 to Costa Rica, which still holds a 5-4-2 edge over the Americans in qualify­ing matches. 
Costa Ilica is 1-1-1 in this round. tied for second with Mexico, which played a 1-1 tie Wednesday at Trinidad and Tobago. 
With Ante Razov set to come in for Wolff, the Americans first bad a corner kick. Jeff Agoos' drive was played by Clint Mathis in the middle of the penalty area. The ball rico­cheted to Wolff, who played it off the ground with his left foot and beat goalkeeper Errick Lonnis in the 70th minute from point-blank range.
--
His job completed, Wolff cele­brated his second game-winner of the three qualifying games, then left the field. 
From there, it was Keller's job to protect the lead. He did it with several terrific hand saves, including one on a dan­gerous header by Paolo Wanchope with eight minutes left. 
With fireworks exploding behind the stadium, the U.S. players saluted the crowd by taking a lap around the field. 
After a lackluster first half, play immediately picked up as both sides threatened. In a span of four minutes, Mathis sent a header wide on a gor­geous cross from David Regis; Earnie Stewart's 25-yard shot was stopped by Lonnis; Wolff shot just wide from close-range after a giveaway; and Wolffs sliding shot was stopped by a prone Lonnis. 
Costa Rica also had a danger­ous chance in that flurry. but Keller caught a close-in header by Steve Bryce. 
Although the Americans car­ried the play for most of the first half, they had trouble when they got near the Costa Rican penalty area. Too often. they eschewed crosses and chips for footwork, and the visi­tors easily stymied the attacks. 
But the United States got one excellent opportunity in the 16th minute. Claudio Reyna broke free in midfield and sent a pass wide on the left to Wolff. Wolff's soft. high shot got over Lonnis. but was brilliantly cleared otT the line by Reynaldo Parks' bicycle kick. 
Television replays were inconclusive, but linesman Fernando Cresci of Uruguay was right on the end line and did not signal a goal. 
Parks made several other strong plays and was Costa Rica's best player for the first 45 minutes.

the lield but complained of discomfort while sitting on the bench. Surgery that night relieved pressure on his brain, but the damage proved to be fatal. 
The lawsuit, filed !Jy Boise attorney Kurt Holzer, alleges negligence, breach of warranty, willful and wanton conduct, design and manufacturing defects and "failure to give adequate warnings to consumers of the dangers not readily apparent from the reasonably foresee­able use" of the helmet. 
No specific damage amount is sought by the complaint, which says only that it should be more than $100,000. Holzer said the amount would be determined at trial. 
Julie Nimmons, president and chief executive officer of the central Illinois group of companies, did not return calls from The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
According to the complaint, the helmet had "inadequate insulation and padding and was susceptible, when used in a rea­sonable and proper manner intended, to imparting high G-loads upon the heads of its users, thereby causing serious and permanent bead injuries and death to users."

Five athletes attending Saturday's race are registered members of the club. The other two members have signed up to travel with the club, although they have not been training with it. Hildebrandt will also be com­peting in the race. 
As a long-time competitor in triathlons, Hildebrandt believed Saint Mary's was an excellent place to begin a triathlon club. 
"I thought there were so many students who swim and bike. I thought it would be a good idea to have something relaxed to do to stay in shape," she said. "Another reason was for the swimmers out of season to have something else to do."

"We have to see how the fall

Because the triathlon season does not begin until April and Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students will be leaving for the summer, this is the only race the club will be able to participate in this spring. However, two races aro already scheduled for next fall. Women returning to campus in the fa.II will begin training for the two races, which are sched­uled for September, right away. 
"Next year the fall will be spent preparing for the two races in . September," Hildebrandt said. "We'll be getting the message out to returning members.''.

The Notre Dame women's lacrosse team proved its worth Wednesday, as they easily handled Ohio State. 18-12. 
The win moves the team to 9-4, matching their best ever win total. The Irish a I s o remain undefeated in their region. 
The Irish matched Ohio State's rough play not with physical repost, but with speed and control. Last year they faced harsh double-and triple-teaming, but proved to be well prepared Wednesday. 
Despite a slippery field and a couple of Buckeye runs, the frish stayed composed as they cruised to a 18-12 victo­
ry. 

The Irish seemed to domi­nate the Buckeyes for most of the game. 
Notre Dame's strong offen­sive pressure easily overpow­ered the hard play by Buckeye defenders while on the opposite end, sophomore Jen White stood solid in the crease with six saves. The

Irish take care of Buckeyes 18-12 
Irish defense failed to be 
intimidated by the Buckeye's 
attempts to push the ball 
hard inside to their attack­
ers. 
The Irish dominated almost 
every aspect of the game by 
outshooting and outdrawing 
their opponent. Notre Dame 
had 39 shots to OSU's 23 and 
the Irish tallied 20 draw con­
trols to the Buckeyes' 12. 
"After the loss to 
Georgetown on Sunday, we 
were ready to go from the 
start," said junior Natalie 
Loftus, who scored a game­
high four goals against Ohio 
State. "Everyone was execut­
ing and we played well in our 
transition." 
The high speed transition that Notre Dame takes pride in was at full force Wednesday, as the ball quickly moved toward the goal. 
Scoring their first two goals early in the game. the Irish jumped out to 6-1 start, including two of three goals from freshman Meridith Simon, before Ohio State scored their second goal. The Irish then scored four straight goals from Loftus, juniors Alissa Moser and Tina Fedarcyk as well as sophomore Danielle Shearer. 
After another Buckeye score, Loftus and senior Lael O'Shaughnessy each scored onegoal to give the Irish a

12-3 halftime lead. 
Ohio State opened up the second half with two goals by Tracy Bonds. This caught the Irish off guard, as they spent much of the half trying to catch their footing or chasing Buckeye attackers. 
Another goal by Loftus, which proved to be tho game­winner, found itself in the middle of a Buckeye run of four goals. "We weren"t get­tjng many breaks [early in the ha!O but we kept beating them in the midfield," said Loftus. 
This run ended as quickly as it started, however, as Notre Dame once again rat­tled off four consecutive goals. This run was sparked by freshman Kassen Delano's second goal. Ohio State fin­ished the game with a 5-1 run that gave the Irish an 18­12 win. 
The Irish were led by f'ive­po int performances from {)'Shaughnessy and Loftus. Loftus led the team with four goals while O'Shaughnessy led with two assists. 
Notre Dame's next game will be on Sunday at 1 p.m. It will be the final home game this season for O'Shaughnessy and fellow seniors Sarah LeSucur, Tara Durkin and Carrie Marshall. The game will be against Butgers and held in the Moose Krause Stadium.

BOOKSTORE BASKETBALL XXX 
Majesties' Wolb~ck rebounds from ACL to star at Stepan 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 
Senior SmffWriter 
Majesties· Matt Wolbeck never thought he'd play basketball again. 
The Notre Dame junior was a hot com­modity as a basketball player back in eighth grade in Peoria, Ill. But his basket­ball career went down the tubes in his first game at Peoria Notre Dame High School. 
"The first game of freshman year, I blew my knee out," Wolbeck said. "I tore my ACL. I came down on my roommate's foot and my knee hyperextended." 
Soon after, Wolbeck tried to get back to the game, but his leg just wouldn't heal. He underwent six MRis, four surgeries and a CAT scan before doctors fmally found an answer. 
"I had a benign tumor, and it was eating through my femur and tibia," Wolbeck said. "The doctor said that with one wrong step, I could have shattered both bones in my leg. He couldn't figure out how I was walk­ing, let alone trying to hobble down the court." 
Wolbeck went through his final surgery the summer after his junior year at Peoria Notre Dame. During the procedure. doctors removed bone from his hip and reinserted it into his knee, filling a hole the size of a ping pong ball. 
Three years spent on crutches had taken their toll on Wolbeck, but after a few months of attending rehab four days a week, he was ready to take the court once more. His high school coach worked him back into the game gradually, increasing his playing time from sporadic minutes at the season's start to full speed by tourney time. 
Despite the shortened season, Wolbeck's play was impressive enough to earn him third-team all-state honors. That's despite a talent pool that included current Los Angeles Clippers player Corey Maggette, University of Illinois player Frank Williams and University of Iowa player Rod Thompson, all of whom Wolbeck played MU ball with. 
"I was better in eighth grade than I was my senior year of high school," Wolbeck said. 
While Wolbeck may have been better in eighth grade, his skills were good enough to earn him a scholarship offer from Creighton University. The offer was half for basketball and half for Wolbeck's services as a pitcher in baseball. 
On the verge of heading to Creighton, Wolbeck chose to follow a family tradition. His dad Ken played basketball for the Irish from 1970-74, and his whole family had come to Notre Dame, with an older brother already there. 
"I had my mind set on Creighton the entire time," Wolbeck said, "and I was pret­ty much ready to go there. At the last minute, I decided I really wanted to go to Notre Dame. 
Unfortunately, Wolbeck had already missed the application date, so he spent his first year of college at Holy Cross. That year, he spoke with then-Irish men's bas­ketball coach John MacLeod about walking on Lhe squad once he traTL.-,ferrcd to Notre Dame. 
A year on the sidelines, however, con­vinced Wolbeck Division I basketball was no longer in his plans. That decision set the stage for him to join the Majesties in Bookstore Basketball, a team his older brother already played for. 
By the time Wolbeck joined Majesties, their rise to Bookstore royalty had already been a long time coming. 
The seeds for the team were planted back in junior high when Corey Hartmann, Justin Heberle and Derek Gautier met at Notre Dame basketball camp. 
Heberle and Gautier, both from South Bend, were already best friends, and Hartmann, who is from Chicago, joined their camp teams. All three were basket.ball buffs and all three hoped to come to Notre Dame. 
Year after year, the trio reunited at bas­ketball camp, even winning the team championship together their final year. 
"We'd meet here every summer," Hartmann said, "and we'd always play together." 
Hartmann got a surprise when he arrived at Holy Cross for his freshman year of col­lege. Both Heberle and Gautier, Penn High School grads whose parents work at Notre Dame. had passed up basketball offers from Division II and III programs. and were also attending Holy Cross. The three became fast friends and by the time spring rolled around, they decided to form a Bookstore Basket.ball team. 
As freshmen, Majesties advanced to the round of 32. The next year, with Hartmann now at Notre Dame and the other two still at Holy Cross, then-Holy Cross-freshman Wolbeck joined the squad, with his older brother already on the team. That year, Majesties made it all the way to the top eight. 
Each year, Majesties has gone a little bit further in the tournament. Last year, Hartmann, Heberle, Gautier, Wolbeck and Pete Hyan, a first-team all-tournament selection who now plays for No. 1 Five

Majesties hope the switch pays off, no one more than Hartmann, a head commission­er of Bookstore who will graduate in May. 
"Football season's fun," said Hartmann, "but Bookstore's what I look forward to every year."

BOOKSTORE BASKETBALL XXX 
ForIDer walk-on Kloska looks to lead NDToday to gold 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 
Senior Staff Writer 
B.J. Kloska always dreamed of being a basketball star at Notre Dame. 
The senior has become known at Notre Dame for his basketball skills, but not in the way he imag­ined. Instead of drawing fans to the Juyce Center, Kloska's sweet jump shot has attracted them to the Stepan courts to watch Bookstore Basketball. 
Growing up in nearby Elkhart as Lhe 10th of 13 kids, all of whom had au.ended Not.re Dame or Saint Mary's, Kloska's natural choice for 
.. college was Notre Dame. His old­est brother, Bobby, came hume talking about traditions like thP Four Horsemen and Knute Hockne. and the rest of the farnily got caught up in Notre Dame as well. By the time B.J. began look­ing at colleges, it barely even crossed his mind to attend a differ­ent school. Even more second nature to Kloska than coming to Notre Dame was a vision of himself play­ing college basketball. As a kid, Kloska's days revolved around basketball -going to school an hour-and-a-half early to shoot in the gym, practicing after school with the team, taking on his brothers in his backyard at night. 
"It [baskctbal!J is a huge tradi­tion in our family," B.J.'s older brother Jeff Kloska said. "BJ. out­does all of us as a basketball play­er." 
B.J.'s older brothers had all played for Marian High School. When B.J. got to Marian, he sur­passed them, breaking his older brolher's record for 3-pointers in a game with eight in his final game at Marian. He set high standards for his younger brolher Joey, three

years behind him at Marian, to 
match. 

"B.J.'s by fru· the best Kloska to 
play," Joey said. "They were big 
shoes to fill. I don't think I quite 
filled them." 

In B.J.'s s1mior year at Marian, 
he earned third-team all-state 
honors, was named Metro Player 
of the Year and became the all­
time leading scorer at Marian. 
But all the accolades weren't 
enough for a scholarship offer to 
Notre Dame, and B..l. decided to 
pass on playing Division II or III 
basketball. 

"The thought had actually crossed my mind," B . .J. said, "but it didn't really cross it for very long because I knew I wasn't going to go to Lhe NBA" 
Instead, the 6-foot-3 B.J. chose to attend Holy Cross for a year. then cross the street to go to Notre Dame. That year, as a sophomore, he reached his goal of playing bas­ketball for Notre Dame, walking on for Coach John MacLeod's team. 
Playing for tbc Irish didn't quite match the picture-perfect image 
B.J. had in his mind. Coming off the bench in the final minute of games was a far cry from his high school role of go-to guy. Plus the time commitment was almost overwhelming. He decided to stick to Bookstore Basketball as a junior. 
"Sometime reality has to set in," said B.J. of his decision not to try out again for the varsity team. 'Tm very glad I did it looking back, but it's such a big time commitment. I felt like I was missing out on the social aspect of college." 
If B.J. couldn't play Division I basketball, Bookstore was a good alternative. All his older brothers had played in the tourney, with Mike and Jeff Kloska winning the tournament in 1996 on the team 

Dos Kloskas with B.J. watching 
from the stands. B.J.'s competitive 
nature made him want to best his 
brothers. 

"All the guys [in my family] have always grown up playing basket­ball," B.J. said, "and all of the boys have always tried to one up one another. So far. I've done a pretty good job of it, but they won Bookstore and I haven't." 
Ac; a freshman, 8.J. and current teammate Todd Titus advanced to the final eight on In Memory of McCon. Last year, the two Siegfried Hall roommates played for NDToday.com made it all the way to the championship, where they lost to Keyplay.com. with BJ. a first team all-tournament selec­tion. 
"He's our team leader," Titus said of B.J. "I think we all kind of look t.o him t.o see how he's play­ing, and we all feed off of him. E We talk about Bookstore all year long." 
B.J. and Titus are back on NDToday this year with their last shot at a Bookstore championship. Their three teammates graduated, including Mark Codish, first team all-tournament pick Dave Mikolyzk and second team selection Tim Muething. Replacing the three are B.J.'s curlent roommate and Bengal Bouts finalist Rob Joyce, off-campus senior Mike Oesterle and Holy Cross freshman Joey Kloska, B.J.'s younger brother. 
"This is the most exciting Bookstore team I've ever been on," 
B.J. said, "just because I've always wanted him [Joey] to be on the same team. We always just missed playing together. EIt would mean everything to me to win Bookstore, especially playing with my broth­er." 
B.J.'s four games away from making his dream come true. "Anything B.J. has ever put a 

goal out for himself," said Mike Kloska. "he's always reached it. I would never put anything past him. When he decides to do some­thing, he pretty much accomplish­es his goals.'' 
A few teams would like to stand in B.J.'s way, most notably top­ranked Five Reasons Your Girl Left You, No. 2 Versatility and No. 4 Majesties, all of which are veteran squads. But B.J.'s got a history of getting things done.

No. I Notre Dame splits twin bill with Valparaiso 
By COLIN BOYlAN 
Spores Writer 
It turns out the Irish only have so much late inning magic, after all. 
After deteating Valparaiso 7-3 in the first game of an evening dou­bleheader, the Notre Dame base­
.... 
ball team was unable to come back from a late deficit, losing a close 4­2 game in the second contest. 
The Irish trailed 4-1 in the final inning of the nightcap, but fought to keep their 16 game winning streak alive. With runners Paul O'Toole and Andrew Bushey on the corners after consecutive sin­gles. designated hitter Ken MeyP,r stepped up to the plate. 
Irish fans collectively held their breath and prayed for· a repeat of last week's heroics, when Meyer hit a two out grand slam to give the team a 6-4 victory against Central Michigan. 
It was not to be, however, as Meyer was only able to manage a slow ground ball to first base. And while the grounder brought O'Toole home, the next batters Joe Thaman and Steve Stanley both made outs to end the game. 
While the loss snapped Notre Dame's longest winning streak in more than eight years, head coach Paul Mainieri was not dwelling on that fact. 
"Any time you lose, it's disap­pointing," said Mainieri. "But we played very well in the first game, and I'd like to think our team will focus on that aspect." 

The first game was textbook Notre Dame baseball. The team scored early, thanks to the hustle of Stanley, their lead off man. 
The junior center fielder opened the game with a base hit off Valparaiso's Eric Brauer. He then proceeded to steal both second and third base before scoring on Alec Porzcl's sacrifice fly. 
The game remained close until the fourth inning. when the Irish bats struck again. Designated hit­ter Matt Bok ripped a triple to right-center, scoring Bushey, and subsequently came home on a sac­rifice fly from Thaman. Four con­secutive hits by Stanley, Steve Sollman, Brian Stavisky and Kris Billmaier brought home three more runs and ended Brauer's evening. Ry the end of the inning, the Irish led 7-0. 
That was plenty of cushion for starting pitcher Drew Duff who, despite making only his second start of the year. pitched like a vet­eran, striking out four and allow­ing only two hits through five innings of work. 
Ryan Kalita came on in the sixth to finish out the seven-inning con­test. Although the junior reliever ran into a little trouble in his two innings of work, he was nonethe­
