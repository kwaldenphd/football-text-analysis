NDTV hits the air-waves and gets in line for club status 

By ANDREW THAGARD 
Assistant News Editor 
NDTV, Notre Dame students' latest media venture. continues to seek club status as it works to put out a biweekly variety show. 
The organization is now more aware of just how diffi­cult the process of obtaining formal University recognition is -a process that has recently stalled, according to NDTV executive producers Lance Johnson and Liam Dacey. 
Getting Started 
Johnson, Dacy, sophomore Chris Chamberland and senior Alex Grunewald first proposed the concept of a student-pro­duced television program last semester. The four approached Film, Television and Theatre assistant professor Christine Becker with the idea and received her support.

Diversity board develops harassment proposal 
By ANNELIESE WOOLFORD 
N=sWricer 
Saint Mary's Student Diversity Board is developing a proposal to incorporate a discrimination and harassment clause into campus poli­cy. 
The decision to work on a proposal for the clause was based on student complaints about the lack of specific details regarding the current policy. 
The policy highlighting harass­ment, sexual harassment and 
ment and warns that any student or employee found to have harassed another will be subject to appropri­ate disciplinary action. 
The current policy further details the victim's rights, reporting proce­dures and suggestions for preven­tion. 
Nila Ahmad, vice president of SDB. heads the proposal's development. She began by researching the poli­cies of other colleges to obtain a bet­ter understanding of what is com­monly included in discrimination and harassment clauses. 
Ahmad then looked at the frame­work of Saint Mary's current policy and proposed the addition of specific factors on which discrimination can­not be based. She also proposed a common definition of harassment and a procedure to handle violations of the clause. 
"The clause is still in the beginning of its process in working and revis­ing it, so it's still too early to tell much of anything about it," Ahmad said. 
Last Monday, Ahmad presented the proposal to Saint Mary's Board of Governance in hopes of their endorsing the clause as student ini­tiative. BOG responded with sugges­tions to improve the proposal and gave it one week for further review.

"BOG reviewed the proposal and seemed to agree that a harassment clause was necessary for Saint Mary's. However. we were unable to take a vote because we lost quo­rum as people left for other meetings and rehearsals," said Elizabeth Jablonski­Diehl, vice-president of BOG. 
A vote for BOG to 

endorse the idea of the harassment clause will be taken Monday. The proposal will then move on to Linda Timm. vice president for Student Affairs, for further analysis before BOG places an official vote. It must then be presented to the Student Affairs Committee, the Council of Student Affairs and the Board of Trustees for final approval. 
"Student Diversity Board have put a lot of work into the clause and are hoping to get it implemented as soon as possible. It is an important step in increasing diversity and awareness on this campus," said Jablonski­Diehl.

up signs," Dacey said. "We had this big meeting and got a large turnout. We saw then the inter­est." 
That perceived interest, Dacey said, led the group to begin for­matting a potential show. They decided to organize the pro­gram into news and entertain­ment segments and allotted time for an interview and a "random" category as well. 
With a plan in mind, the four students -now executive pro­ducers of the show -decided to apply for club status at the end of last semester. Johnson spear­headed the application process, working with Amy Geist, coordi­nator for student groups at Student Activities. 
Becoming recognized and sponsored by the University has been a goal of the student orga­nization since its inception, Johnson said. The producers quickly realized that club status would aid in promoting the show and University support

Although no new clubs have emerged this current semester, many have gained approval within the last year. For the most part. approved clubs have remained sta­ble. 


Wabruda 
Meaning 'brotherhood' in Swahili, Wabruda is concerned with social awareness, profossional development and brotherhood enlightenment, said club President Justin Wilson. Wilson said the club strives to promote brotherhood amongst African-Americans and strengthen gender relations through a semi-annual event, Karamu. in which each member invites an African-American woman to dinner.

Recruitment abroad rises 
By TERESA FRA.LISH 
Assistant News Editor 
While over 1,000 international students are currently studying at Notre Dame, only 266 of these students are undergraduates. according to the International Student Services and Activities (ISSA) office, a num­ber which is somewhat lower than other national universities like Notre Dame. 
Despite the small number, several University initiatives have attempted to increase the percentage of international undergraduates to Notre Dame's target enrollment of 5 percent. 
Currently the percentage of enrolled undergraduates stands at about 4.8 per­cent, said Matthew Potts, undergraduate admissions counselor for international stu­dents. 
Beginning in the 2000-2001 fiscal year, the University has been able to offer limited financial assistance to international under­graduates in an attempt to increase the per­centage of foreign students on campus, said Sue Brandt, financial aid officer. 
"It's been a priority for the University," said Potts. "[Financial aid] is one of the big attractions." 
Prior to this new policy, international stu­dents were expected to provide the full cost of a Notre Dame education and were required to sign a statement on their admis­sion application agreeing to this fact. 
Over the past few years. statistics for international undergraduate students tripled, said Potts, likely due in large part to the financial aid now available. 
At Georgetown University, financial aid has correlated with high numbers of inter­national students. Georgetown currently has about 2,000 international students enrolled, a figure double that of Notre Dame's. 
The newly available financial aid has allowed the University to expand its recruit­ment and increase options for students from third-world countries. 
"As a Catholic University, our commit­ment is to international student'> overall. but especially to students from developing nations," Potts said. In particular, the University has focused recruitment elforls on students from Latin American countries who may have previously been unable to find the necessary funds to attend Notre Dame, Potts said. 
The admissions office currently employs three counselors who focus on international recruitment and travel abroad to increase awareness about Notre Dame and the expe­rience it offers. 
"We try to give them a sense of the oppor­tunities available in the U.S.," Potts said. Admissions counselors also work with for­eign alumni clubs in their international recruitment efforts, Potts said. 
In another attempt to make the University more accessible to foreign students. repre­sentatives from ISSA have worked with stu­dent government in addition to developing their own programs. 
"We're here to support, orient, advise and refer [students]. The interest is to provide for a culturally diverse experience for all students, whether American or internation­al," said Connie Peterson-Miller, assistant director of ISSA 
The office works to develop a wide variety of programs and services for foreign stu­dents, including conversation circles to develop informal language, housing options during breaks and shopping trips for winter clothing. 
"We're here to help them express their perspective," said Peterson-Miller. 
Recently Peterson-Miller spoke at Student Senate in late October to raise awareness within student government about interna­tional students and the unique perspective they bring to campus. As a result, Libby Bishop, student body president, discussed the possibility of adding a representative for international students to the Campus Life Council at its Nov. 4 meeting. However, because ofthe structW"e ofCLC. the possibil­ity of adding a member was small and stu­dent government would instead focus on other ways to increase awareness about for­eign students. Bishop said. 
"The discussion went towards bridging the gap between student government and Lforeign student'>]," she said. 
Overall, international undergraduates said their experiences and transitions to the University were positive and they were excited to see the addition of financial aid

ous cutthroat sub­culture which would pop into the minds of very few people: Irish step danc­ing. 
As members of the community of the Fighting Irish, we are all familiar with Irish dancing, as we try to do the Irish jig at home games, watch the Irish Guard perform the victory clog and attend the annual Farley Feis. 
But the real world of Irish dancers is a highly-structured realm of vast ambition and unbridled competition, one which takes dancers all over the globe and embroils them in countless petty rival­ries. 
Irish dancing teachers must be certified by an international board of instructors in order to establish schools which will be allowed to compete in all the mainstream feis tournaments. A ridiculous number of these teachers hate each other, and they purposely foster hardened rivalries between their respective schools. 
My own Irish dancing teacher (I danced until I was 13) encouraged an elitist, condescending attitude in her dancers, who were consequently hated by other schools. I couldn't stand half of them myself. and I despised Mrs. Glade (name changed to protect the guilty) most of all. Glade habitually stood in the cor­ner of the studio, banging a black wood­en stick on the floor in time to the music as she barked out criticisms and boasted that she used to lock students in the clos­et. She pushed her two daughters so hard that one now has severe tendirutis and the other has broken or sprained every toe and both ankles at least once. 
And for some reason, the Glade Academy parents bought into her warped win-or-die, Irish-dancing-is-life attitude. They drove their children hours each weekend to every single feis and spent hundreds of dollars on intricate velvet costumes imported from Ireland. I actually know one family who converted a bedroom in their home into a practice studio for their 12-year-old daughter, complete with finished wooden floors and mirrored walls. 
And all of this existed before the Riverdance phenomenon. The show had not yet hit Broadway, and Michael Flatley had not yet stunned the world with his Rambo-like headdress, baby-oiled chest and "Feet of Flames." There was really no professional outlet for Irish dancers, yet their parents and teachers still pushed them ridiculously hard. And I can only imagine how much the situation has worsened since I left and the mainstream shows appeared. 
So the next time you hear a jig played or sec one performed, don't just associate it with a flippant, merry dance done by leprechauns. The Irish dancing pastime is an all-encompassing subculture, and it is surprisingly structured, demanding and ruthless.

Fetnale sports professionals discuss w-onten in athletics 
look at how they arc spending the money. Title IX has been a conve­nient [excuse] for people who ani not balancing the budget," she said. 
Brennan particularly criticized the large number of' scholarships that universities provide to football players and said that most football programs cannot even cover their own expenses. She found particu­lar problems with athletic direc­tors who deny that Title IX regu­lates their football programs and she then challenged these direc­tors to cut the nwnber of football scholarships from 85 to 75. 
"Title IX is a law for superceding sports issues," she said. 'There are two genders, men and women, not men, women and football players, What if they [football) went down to 75 [scholarships]? Wouldn't that create parity anyway? Wouldn't that make college football more competitive?" 
Although all four panelists stressed the far-reaching effects that Title IX has had in advancing gender equality and increasing opportunities for women athletes, each participant commented that much work remains to be done, particularly with respect to media coverage of women's sports. 
Brennan described the typical sports editor of many professional newspapers as a white 50-to 60­year-old male. Because of these demographics, she said, editors either choose not to emphasize women's sports or attempt to iso­late women's athletics by creating separate pages or publications specifically for women's sports. 
"The reality is that we [the media] are doing a terrible job of covering women's sports. The sports section should be covering women's sports every day-don't ghettoize women's sports and make it less than the official thing," she said. 
Washington stressed the impor­tance that media coverage has on shaping public perceptions and creating a generation of young girls who want to play sports. She said young girls now have role models in female athletes that did not exist before. 
"Just the fact that there is cover­age, that [women's] leagues exist, has a huge impact on women's sports. With more coverage, you'll have more women who will feel empowered playing women's sports," she said. 
The "Women in Sports" panel was presented by The South Bend Tribune and the Northern Indiana Center for History, which is cur­rently showing a nationally-exclu­sive exhibition that highlights turn­ing points and superstars in women's athletics. The audience included four members of the All American Girls Professional Baseball League, highlighted in the movie "A League of Their Own."

ions on topics ranging from Title IX and gender equity in sports to media representation and cover­age of women's athletics. 
David Haugh, sports columnist for The South Bend Tribune, mod­erated the forum, which included Coquese Washington, assistant Notre Dame women's basketball coach and WNBA athlete; Nancy Armour, Associated Press sports­writer; Christine Brennan, USA Today columnist; and Nan Tulchinsky, South Bend Community School Corporation director of athletics. 



Panelistc; illustrated the opportu­
nities available to young women 
now as a result of Title IX that did 
not exist in their childhood. 

"I would have been one of those girls who would have probably played on three soccer teams a week and be fighting boys for playing time in little League base­ball," Brennan said, "I kept my [high school] letter jacket in the closet; I was personally proud [of my athletic accomplishments) but rdidn't want anyone else to know it. Look how far we have come." 
Tulchinsky, a Saint Mary's alumna, spoke about the opportu­nities that did not exist in her gen­eration with respect to women's athletics. 
"As a youngster, there were no athletics. I was never allowed to play against buys in the gymnasi­um or the playground -only in my driveway. I felt the same kind of desire to play [as women ath­letes do now] but I couldn't," she said. 
Washington, a current member of the Indiana Fever WNBA team and former member of the cham­pionship-winning Houston Comets, commented on the expe­riences available to her because of Title IX. In addition to coaching and playing professionally, Washington is also an attorney, having earned her law degree from Notre Dame in 1997. 
"Without Title IX, my adult life would be dillerent. I'd probably be wearing pumps and a power suit to work Instead, I get the pleasure to do something [as a career) I'd probably do anyway [for recre­ation)," she said. 
The panelists also addressed the recent criticisms of Title IX with respect to concerns that mens col­1ege sports programs like wrestling or gymnastics have been cut as a result of the legislation, 
Brennan said 80 percent of American universities are not yet in compliance with Title IX legisla­tion. She said individuals blaming Title IX for mens program cuts are presenting a "ridiculous" argu­ment, while Armour instead said university athletic directors are responsible for the poor allocation of resources. 
"The idea [of Title IX] was to create opportunities for women, not cut them for men. Athletic directors have to take a real hard

Saint Mary's College president Marilou Eldred appointed Marcia Rickard as interim associate dean of faculty and director of the Center for Academic Innovation at the College late last month. 
Rickard's appointment came after Patrick White assumed the duties of interim vice president and dean of faculty when Karen Ristau resigned. 
Rickard joined the Saint Mary's faculty in 1978 as an associate professor in the art department. As interim associate dean, it is Rickard's responsibility to advise the vice president and dean. She will serve on a number of commit­tees, including committees for cur­riculum assessment, rank and tenure, and faculty grants and the general education task force.

Key nations consider oil regulations on North Korea 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
Key countries met Thursday to consid­er a U.S.-demand to suspend oil assis­tance to North Korea for violating a pledge not to develop nuclear weapons. and the United States said it expects support. 
There has been little support in the Bush administration or in Congress for continuing the 8-year-old oil assistance program following North Korea's acknowledgment last month that it was secretly developing a uranium-based bomb. 
The fate of the shipments is in the 
hands of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, known as KEDO, whose members are the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union. 
U.S. 
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said American diplomats have been assured the EU and Japan would back President Bush's plan at the New York meeting and that South Korea will go along with some version of it. 

At the start of Thursday's meeting at KEDO's offices in midtown Manhattan,

Pritchard told the other representa­tives he was "looking forward" to pro­viding them with a firsthand account of his trip last month to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, and his discussions last week in Tokyo "and hope that we will be able come to, as we always have in the past. a consensus decision on the best next steps to take." 
KEDO officials later confirmed the meeting was under way. 
Bush made the decision to suspend oil shipments during a session with his national security team Wednesday night ahead of Thursday's meeting of KEDO, which was founded after North Korea signed an agreement with the United States in 1994 pledging to become a nuclear weapons-free state. 
As part of the 1994 agreement. tho United States promised to provide more than 500,000 tons of heavy oil per year. In addition, South Korea and Japan offered to pay most of the cost for two light water nuclear reactors that are of limited use for a country intent on developing nuclear weapons. 
The fate of that project is up in the air. 
Bush's only concession was to agree to allow a vessel already en route to North Korea to deliver what would be the last 
U.S. oil shipment unless Pyongyang decides to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.

Gun distributor to pay widow $1.2 million 
A jury ordered a gun distributor Thursday to pay $1.2 million to the widow of a teacher gunned down by a 13-year-old student in a landmark case target­ing inexpensive handguns. The jury, however, pinned most of the fault for the 2000 slaying of Barry Grunow on the gun's owner and school officials. Widow Pam Grunow sued distributor Valor Corp., claiming the small, cheap pistol of the kind used by the student killer often fall into the hands ofjuveniles and criminals. It was the first case to address both the absence of a gun lock and the flaws associated with a cheap. easily concealable weapon. But the jury said 45 percent of the fault for Grunow·s death lies with the school board for allowing Nathaniel Brazill onto campus that day and 50 percent with the family friend who kept the gun unlocked in a dresser drawer. where Brazill found it. Brazill was sentenced to 28 years behind bars for killing his teacher with the .25-caliber Raven handgun.

Health, Cultural Competence seminar to be held 
By EMILY FORD 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's College will host a Health and Cultural Competence Community Leader's Seminar Saturday, one of 11 workshops designed to explore contemporary health issues in terms of gender and culture. 
The event was organized by Marcia Good-Maust, a fellow in anthropology with The Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership. The idea for this event originated from this summer's Community Leader's Seminar, "Tapping the Wellsprings of Wisdom," in which over 100 local women participated. 
"There was such interest and enthusiasm that generated out of that experience that we made a commitment to continue provid­ing four opportunities throughout the year to continue exploring women's leadership and intercul­tural issues together," said Bonnie Bazata, director of com­munity connections with CWIL. "Health and wellness was a key focus from the summer and so we continued that theme here within an intercultural focus." 
Mayadene Paysoure, a commu­nity member who volunteers at Memorial Hospital's Sage-ing Center, said she is looking for­ward to offering insight into health as part of the aging process. 
"I want to inform people about a spiritual eldering tool called life review and life repair that helps us to reframe our past experi­ences, to achieve a more con­scious and fuller living," Paysoure said. 
What will make this weekend's 

seminar such an innovative dis­
cussion, according to CWlL's Web 
site, is that it will veer away from 
the standard stigmas assigned to 
health. Often, the word "health" 
is associated with illness, treat-

This seminar aims to take a more holistic approach to health. defining it as simply "well being."

"The morning is more talking, but lots of discussion," Bazata said. "The afternoon is really experiential with lots of move­ment." 
Bazata said this workshop will be valuable because of th.e diversi­ty of the participants, including students, staff and community members working in various fields. 
Mary Lauck, CEO of Girl Scouts of Singing Sands Council, Inc., will be one of the community members participating in the workshop. 
She is also currently a member of the Women's Wisdom for Community Change, a develop­ment initiated at a previous CWlL retreat. 
"The reason why I'm going to be participating is because ... I've been actively involved in many, many areas at the campus level," Lauck said. "But also because the Center for Women's lntercultural Leadership has just been a won­derful new innovative program there at the college and I partici­pated in the retreat-workshop that was held several months ago. It was a wonderful opportunity for women leaders to come together. It was a learning experience, a sharing experience." 
Bazata also said that these workshops provide the conunwlity with a chance to learn not only about health and well being, but to communicate with different cul­tures as well. 

"One of the things that makes these experiences so dynamic is the mix of age, race, cultw·e and experience," Bazata said. "So this is a unique and powerful opportu­nity for students to not only learn about a given topic, but also devel­op confidence, develop new rela­tionships, learn more about the community and possibly even find a mentor."

IN BRIEF 
Lebman Brothers lays off500 employees 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. cut its ranks by 500 employees on Thursday. including its chief investment strategist Je!Trey Applegate, a person familiar with the matter said. 
The companywide cuts at the New York­based investment bank, one of Wall Street's biggest, amounted to 4 percent of its total work force of 12,980 as of Sept. 30. "We have made small adjustments across all divisions and regions lo reflect the challenging environment" said Hannah Burns, a Lehman Brothers spokeswoman. "Still, the number is not signifi­cant relative to the overall size of the firm." Burns declined to confirm specifics about Thursday's cuts, and would not comment on Applegate's status. 
Since the end of 2000, more than 32,000 securities workers have lost their jobs as the bear market has severely curtailed financial deals and profits. 
Dollar climbs vs. major currencies 
Decreased risk aversion, rising equities, cheery economic data and reduced geopoliti­cal tensions helped the dollar climb Thursday against most of its major rivals. 
The spate or economic releases helped refo­cus the currency market's attention on eco­nomic fundamentals after recent domination by global interest-rate differentials. "We're in one of these moments here where everything is status quo for the moment," said Jason Bonanca. foreign exchange analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston.

&:-Adelphiaexecutivepleadsguilty 
. Another U.S. company falls to corporate fraud 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
Members of the Rigas family conspired to lie to the public and plunder the cable TV system owner Adelphia Communications Corp., a former executive said Thursday as he pleaded guilty to securities fraud. 
As part of his guilty plea in Manhattan feder­al court, James Brown, the former vice presi­dent of finance at Adelphia, has promised to testify against the family members about the scandal which cost investors billions of dol­lars. 
Adelphia, based in Coudersport, Pa., sought bankruptcy court protec­tion from its creditors on June 25. 
"With the assistance and agreement of others, I helped to manipulate and overstate earnings," he said during the pro­ceeding in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

Hormone therapy sales plunge 
A.ssocia.ted Press 
NEW YORK 
Sales of hormone replacement drugs have plunged dramatically in the four months since a study found unexpect­edly high risks of heart disease and cancer in women taking the pills to block menopause symptoms and pre­vent age-related diseases. 
Sales of Prempro, the Wyeth combi­nation estrogen -progestin pill used in the Women's Health Initiative study announced in July. are down 52 per­cent from a year ago. Sales of all estrogen -progestin pills are down 40 percent, based on prescriptions dispensed in October. 

Sales of Wyeth's estrogen-only pill Premarin -once one of the most widely prescribed drugs in this coun­try -and of all estrogen-only hor­mones have fallen about half as much, according to IMS Health. a health-care information company. Researchers are still studying whether estrogen­only pills, only used for women who have had hysterectomies, are safe. 
IMS monthly data on U.S. revenues from Prempro, Premarin and com­bined sales of all hormone replace­ment pills show the decline has been accelerating since July, after a slight increase in June. 
"We had originally expected them to be down 50 percent once a full year rolled around, and they're there already.'' J.P. Morgan pharmaceuti­cals analyst Carl Seiden said Thursday, referring to Wyeth's pills. 
Seiden noted that in the two years before the study came out in July, ris­ing concern about the pills' long-term risks and increased competition had been cutting the number of Wyeth prescriptions dispensed about 6 per­cent a year. 
The Madison-based company's new competitors -Novartis' estrogen-only pill Vivelle, along with the estrogen­progestin pills Ativella from Pharmacia and Femhrt from Pfizer ­have been selling more since July. even as the overall market shrinks.

"Our goals are to make people aware of an alternative, to distrib­ute information about the Green Party, to support Green Party can­didates when possible." said facili­tator Andrew Casad.

''Officer Rathert's suspension is legal and completely appropriate," Engler said. 
Officials banned Rathert from campus because of a conversation in which she allegedly made threatening remarks against the College, Rathert said. She claimed faith in the security department is already shaken. A year ago, the Department of Education investigated the way Saint Mary's reported its sexual assault statistics. The department's problems have continued this year with the appointment of three different directors since April. 
Now, the controversy surrounding Rathert is strike three in a year marked by turmoil. Saint Mary's students deserve better than a security department that engages in as much. if not more. questionable action as it safe­guards the public against. 
Saint Mary's Security Department isn't protecting or serving anyone if it allows dubious decisions and gross injustices to occur within its own department. To restore public trust, the department would do well to resolve controversies surrounding its officers with expedience and more importantly, with fairness. 
Some people say that marriage is something sacred between men and women. Others may say that marriage is something anyone can enter into, just as long as they truly love each other. No person can argue over the moral merits of this topic, but when many things in society depend upon a person's marital status, this is some­thing that must be considered. Homosexuals should be allowed to enter into marriage or some other type of civil union. This will allow them to have several rights bestowed on heterosexuals who marry. 
Who is to decide whether being homosexual is right or wrong? That question depends upon what you believe in. This does not mean that the government has the right to decide whether it is right or wrong. 
There is even the view that mar­riage should stay the way it has been forever. Well let me correct some of the misconceptions. Marriage hasn't always been what you may have thought it was. Take for example the Christian church that for its first 500 to a 1,000 years considered marriage as tainted. Protestant denominations were roiled by the question of whether it was sinful to remarry divorced people whose ex-spouses were still alive. 
The Bible says marriage is between one man and one woman. Churchgoers say that marriage is a religious institution. Well, to contra­dict this, civil marriage is a govern­ment institution that grants hundreds of state legal rights and responsibili­ties and over a thousand federal legal rights and responsibilities. When peo­ple go to a county clerk's office and pay a fee for a marriage license, reli­gion plays no role whatsoever. The country in which we reside in is not a theocracy. 

The U.S. Constitution makes no mention of the Bible or any other reli­gious text. The idea of allowing homo­sexuals to enter into marriage is not to make religions accept same-sex couples, but to protect homosex­
uals under the legislative given the same marriage con-establishments offered to tract everyone else gets. others. To take a step further, 
Many people may say many of the rights that that the Ten accompany marriage Commandments are have nothing to do the basis of our soci­with children. ety.

take this concept even further, you may go to say that the first three commandments are actually unconsti­tutional. Now this in no way means that the Ten Commandments are wrong, but they are of no legal or con­stitutional standing. So how can peo­ple argue the meaning of the Ten Commandments with marriage? 
One remark by people against homosexual marriage is that because marriage is set up for raising chil­dren, gay people cannot have children so they don't need to get married. Well, why is it that a civil marriage contract is given to heterosexuals regardless of their ability to raise chil­dren? Sterile heterosexual couples

Midterm election brings era of civility

houses of 
Congress. 
Democrats 
should not consider the 2002 
midterm election as much of a loss as 
the 2000 presidential election. On the 
other hand, Republicans should not 
celebrate as much as 2000 either. 
The 2002 midterm election was one 
of the most over-interpreted, yet per­
haps most misinterpreted election 
since World War II. In 1998, Bill 
Clinton did not lose congressional 
scats because the American public 
opposed the highhanded efforts to 
impeach him. This year, Americans 
are not rejecting anything as much as 
lhe cohesion and civility in govern­
ment. 
The so-caUed impressive win by the president and his party translates into a net gain of two Senate seats, one of which Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) would have retained had he not per­ished in a plane crash. On the other side ofthe coin, had Tim Hutchinson (H-Ark.) not been such a holy roller by preaching his brand of family values while divorcing his wife to marry one of his young staff assistants, he would have retained his Republican seat. Hegardless, Republicans controlled the Senate after Bush entered office, lost it when Jim Jeffords left their party and now retain the chamber by just one more seat. 
Presidents lose midterm elections because they usually sweep in many congressional candidates on their coattails. With Bush not garnering a majority of the popular vote, he had no coattails or weak freshmen enter oflice two years ago. The 2000 Census redistricting shuflled congressional districl'l to the extent of protecting most incumbents of both parties. Yet Bush must be given credit for main­taining a constant theme throughout the election cycle that helped him buck traditional midterm results. 
This election docs not historically comparn to the 1974 Watergate midterm election. when Dcmocratc; gained 49 Ilouse and four Senate seats. It dons not compare to 1980, when Honald Hcagan's coattails led Hepublicans lo a sweep, netting 12 Senate seats. control of the Senate for Lhc first time since 1955 and 34 Ilouse seals. Nor docs it compare to 1982, when a recession and unem­ployment rate of 10 percent caused Democrats to recapture more than two-thirds of their losses in the prcvi­m1s election, numbering 26 of Heagan's coattail scats, and coming wilhin 34,000 votes of capturing five Senate sealr; and control of the Senate. It certainly does not compare to 1994 when Republicans took 52 
House seats and control of the House 
for the first time in 40 years, along 
with eight Senate seat<i. 
These previous elections featured a winning party that not only virtually won all of the races expected to be dose, but also pulled off impressive upselc;. Some of their own incum­bents, who seemed destined for defeat, actually survived. while long­shot challengers and open-seat candi­dates, facing enom10us odds in very difficult districts, won. 
None of those situations happened this year. Not one House seat in the country that had been rated leaning, likely or solidly Democratic in mid­October went Republican. Hepublicans simply won seven out of 11 of the toss-up races. Only one Senate seat that was leaning, likely or solidly Democratic went Republican, and that was freshman Georgia Sen. Max Clcland's whose challenger, GOP Rep. Saxby Chambliss, began to surge in the final week. 
Of course, our war on terror has placed an unusual circumstance that would benefit any incumbent presi­dent. This nation is completely in the Republican's hands for the next two years. Republicans should imagine what this year's election might have been like ifAI Gore were the incum­bent using our uncertain security, possible war with Iraq and the coun­try's willingness to speak as one as issues throughout the campaign. Shutter as they may, he was not our sitting president, so this election serves as an end to blaming the Clinton Administration and a return to political civility. 
One promising sign for the future came during the post-election appear­ances of candidates and party officials from both the Democrats and Republicans. They spoke with more civility and graciousness for each other than during the past decade. Democrats may need communica­tions revisions for their next cam­paign messages, but the bitterness of the 2000 election and the Gingrich years has vanished. Republicans, especially Newt Gingrich on post-elec­tion interviews, explained how they interpreted their victory without the nasty tones of the past. 
Perhaps this nation's political fig­ures have finally outgrown the petty bickering that began in 1995 and returned 1.o being the loyal opposition. Perhaps the "I am right and you are wrong" attitudes that began with Gingrich have once-and-for-all been buried in favor of demanding compro­mise that prevailed when Republicans Bob Dole and Bob Michel worked as minority members with a Democratic majority lead by Tip O'Neill and George Mitchell. It is now George W. 13ush's government to lead. Right or wrong, the nation will have nobody other than Bush to praise or blame in the 2004 presidential election. How well his party uses political civility may determine his success or failure.

Republicans must stop global warming 
Regarding the letter, "What would Democrats do differently?" by Ty De Long in the Nov. 12 issue of The Observer, I am astonished Mr. De Long sees no difference between the Republicans and the Democrats on global warming. The voting records on environmental issues clearly show that Republicans by and large vote against environmental protection while Democrats vote for it. You can see for yourself their respective voting records on the League or Conservation Voters' website (http//www.lcv.org/scorecard/indcx.asp). 
Incredibly, Mr. De Long asserts that "It makes no difference what ... one country does." He obviously is unaware that as the consumer of some 25 percent of the earth's energy resources and as the most polluting nation, what the United States docs makes a big, big difference. By refusing to be a partner in the international Kyoto Accords, which are designed to reduce emissions of the gases that cause global warming, President Bush has taken a major step backwards. During the presidential campaign, his Democratic oppo­nent, Al Gorn (author of a perceptive book titled "Earth in the Balance") made it clear he would champion the Kyoto Accords. 
President Bush and many other Republicans are so busy worrying about the Accords' possible effects on our economy they cannot see the disastrous consequences that global warming will have on our climate. on our environment and probably on our economy as well. The irony is that our economy is one of the strongest in the world, yet other coun­tries are leading the way to progress in environmental protection while we skulk on the sidelines. 
Indeed, Mr. De Long, the differences are enormous.

'The Odd (The Femal 
Scene Editor 
Neil Simon's 1966 smash hit, "The Odd Couple," is one of the most recognized farces of the writer's career. In 1980, Simon reworked the show and recast the leads as women and updated a lot of the humor. The result: "The Odd Couple (The Female Version)." 
It was only a matter of time until Saint M a r y s Communications, Dance and Theatre Department took up the challenge. 
The play follows Olive (Heather Muth), a successful television news anchor who lives in a bachelorette pad in New York. When her friend Florence (Maria Conticelli), arrives in hysterics to the weekly girls' night out Trivial Pursuit party, the girls come to calm her down as she reveals that she and her husband of 14 years have broken up. Olive takes Florence in as a roommate until she can reconcile with her husband. 
Unfortunately, the brash and messy Olive and passive aggres­sive and anal retentively tidy Florence are not exactly a match made in heaven. Cabin fever sets in and the two are at each others' throats, culminating with a date Olive has set up with two Spanish brothers from upstairs, played by Vmce DeDario and Curtis Bittle. 
To get the New York accents in the show together, Director and Associate Professor of Theatre Katie Sullivan called in Modern Languages professor Nancy D'Antauno to teach the girls a Brooklyn accent. Spanish profes­sors Jennifer Zachman and Jose Anotnio Rico-Ferrer helped the men put the lisp into word "espafiol." 
Getting the cast to perform as an ensemble in character was vital to the show. Sullivan felt that it was essential for the cast to get to the same energy level for the fast­paced banter to work. 
"I have seen [Simon plays per­formed] where anything for a joke rules, where the actors aren't viewing thls person as a real life 3­D person that they have to let come through," Sullivan said. 
Simon plays can often feel like they have nothing to do with reali­ty and yet be very poignant to audiences. Nobody is quite as witty as Olive or Florence, but Simon's script speaks to what everyone wishes they said. Sullivan secs it as a challenge for the cast to relate such a n over-inflat­ed sense of urgency to an audi­ence. 

"This seemed to me to require [the cast] to work boldly and broadly and yet still try to base everything in truth or believability ... it's easy to play the punch "The Odd,line, but I hoped that we (The Femal could discover

Muth has gotten into her character so much, in fact, that she seems to be a completely different person than her pleasant and soft-spoken real life personality. Conticelli plays a strong straight woman for Muth's sharp jibes. She expertly plays with the contrast between Florence's strict demure deco­
rum and ternpestuous rage. 
Bittle and DeDario rise 
splendidly to match to Muth 
and Concticelli. The men's 
Spanish accents tend to 
rove from the Iberian 
Peninsula and throw in a 
Mexican dialect and 
even a bit of Italian.

ing roommates Olive

. . . that their offstage rela­, tionship was, in some 
part, similar to their on­
stage one, 
"It's sort of funny because 
in real life, Maria is the neater 
roommate and I'm the messier roommate, so it worked out per­fectly. It was helpful that we were roommates in real life because we already had a good chemistry together," Muth said. 
Of course, the pair actually gets along famously in real life. Muth added that the show will speak to college students who have had the experience of having a difficult roommate. 
"I definitely think this is an appropriate choice in a college atmosphere, because Ithink we all can relate to having a roommate that we all couldn't necessarily get along with and having to put up with their bizarre quirks and ten­dencies," Muth said. "I think this show is a good way to look at how those little disagreements can get blown out of proportion and get out of hand." 
"The Odd Couple (The Female Version)" opened Thursday in the Little Theatre.

High-priced Hampton could be headed to the Marlins 
Associa1cd P rcss 
TUCSON, Ariz. 

Mike Hampton will rethink blocking a proposed six-player deal that would send him from Colorado to the Florida Marlins, the pitcher's agent said. 
The Marlins and Hockies agreed to a tentative trade that would move Hampton and outfioldor Juan Pierre to the Marlins for catcher Charles Johnson, outfielder Preston Wilson, lel'l-hander Vic Darensbourg and infielder Pablo Ozuna. Hampton and Johnson both have no-trade clauses and have until midday Saturday to decide whether to waive them. Before the deal was agreed to by the teams, Hampton said he would block it. 
"It was probably prcma-· ture," Jlampton's agent, Mark .'Odgers, said Thursday. "We uwc it to the Marlins to at l!~ast let them make their best sales pitch lo Mike. I think they'll have that opportunity. 
"Mike is not going to sum­marily dismiss it and say no way to the Florida Marlins. He might as well take advantage of this time to do what he needs to do to make a good, thoughtful decision." 
Johnson. who signed with the Marlins to live close to his home. also is "deliberating," according to his agent, Scott 
Bor,i~ 
"We'Jl look into it. It's a big change," Boras said. "He went to Florida for a reason. He knows there's an opportunity in Colorado. It's just some­thing he's beginning to think about." 
Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd would not specu­late on whether the deal would go through, saying, 'Tm in a holding pattern on that." 
Florida general manager Larrv Beinfest refused to com­ment on specifics but did say, 'Tm hopeful that the work we did here can culminate in something happening." 
"We'll see what happens," he said. 'Tm optimistic about the work we did and the way that we moved through on a couple of different areas." 
Hampton. a :10-year-old left­hander, was 7-15 with a 6.15 ERA this year -the highest in the major leagues among pitchers who qualified for the EHA title. 
lie is 21-28 with a 5.75 EHA since leaving the New York Mets to sign a $121 million, eight-year contract with the Rockies in December 2000, the richest deal for a pitcher. Following a 9-2 start in 2001, he is 12-26 with a 6.62 ERA. 
Johnson, a 31-year-old catcher, hit .217 this season with six homers and 36 RBIs in 244 at-bats. 
The tentative trade was first reported Thursday by the Hocky Mountain News, Palm Beach Post and South Florida 
S u n  Sentinel. Hampton was quoted i 11 Thursday's editions of the Denver Post as say­ing he would not approve a trade to Florida. 
"It's not going to happen," Ilampton told the p a p c r when told a deal was possible. 
"They're pretty much in the same situation we're in," Hampton s a i d . "They've 

been in  a  
c  y  c  l  e  
w  h  e  r  e  

they've been trad­ing good players and going young. If [ am going to be traded, I want­ed to go to a team that could win right away." 
Rodgers said Hampton was open to reconsidering. "Mike was caught off guard," 

the agent said. "Mike said to me this morning that this says a lot about the Marlins. They're trying to make their team better. 
Hampton is owed $84.5 mil­lion in salary through 2009. 


pl us $19 million in deferred money from his $21 million signing bonus. 
Johnson is due $25 million over the next three years ­plus $1 million extra in 2005 if he is traded.

Agassi loses twice in Masters Cup, loses grip on No. 1 
,,. 
Associated Press 

SHANGHAI, China 
Andre Agassi's second loss in the season­ending Masters Cup means Lleyton Hewitt will finish the year with ihe world No. 1 ranking. 
Agassi double-faulted on match point, hand­ing Juan Carlos Ferrero a 7-5, 2-6, 7-6 (6) vic­tory. Shortly after the match, Agassi withdrew from the tournament with a hip injury. Thomas Johansson of Sweden will replace Agassi. 
Agassi came into the eight-player tourna­ment with a chance to overtake Hewitt in the rankings and finish the year No. 1. But he failed to reach the semifinals after his second straight loss. 
Hewitt then celebrated his top ranking by handing Marat Safin his third straight loss, 6­
4, 2-6, 6-4. 

"I think Lleyton obviously has had a great year," Agassi said. "He's again proven himself to be the best out there. and that's not easy to 
..
d
0. 

Agassi's second straight defeat also clinched a semifinal berth for Switzerland's Roger Federer, who ran his record to 2-0 by stopping Jiri Novak 6-0. 4-6, 6-2. 
The round-robin portion of the tournament ends Friday when Carlos Moya takes on fellow Spaniard Albert Costa, Ferrero plays Novak and Federer meets Johansson. 
Safin cruised through the second set, when Hewitt served a miserable 28 percent, and had an early break in the final set. Hewitt, howev­er, broke back. 
In the ninth game, Safin won the first two points before eventually losing his serve. It was the opening Hewitt needed, and he held serve in the next game to close out the victory. 
Safin said Hewitt's main strength is "just dedication and consistency. Nothing else." Now Hewitt must wait until the Moya-Costa 
match to see if he plays in the semifinals or if his year is over. 
"I think I've got better and better every match that I've played this week," Hewitt said. "I knew I had to get a win on the board tonight. and I did that and now it's out of my control." 
Agassi battled F'errero evenly, unlike his dis­appointing performance against Novak in his first match Wednesday. But mistakes once again buried any chance Agassi had to pull out a victory. 
"I didn't expect to come out and play a bad match," Agassi said. "It was just a tough match. I expected it to be tough and it was tough, and I'm not sure it's any consolation when you lose it." 
Ferrero, one of three Spaniards in the field, lost his serve only twice in the match -and both came in the second set when Agassi raced out to a 4-0 lead. 
In the third set tiebreaker, Ferrero had triple match point at 6-3. But Agassi won the next three points before Ferrero held for a 7 -6 advantage and his fifth match point. 
This time, Ferrero clinched the win. "Right now I'm playing with a lot of confi­dence," Ferrero said. 
Federer, the first Swiss player to qualify for the season-ending championships since Jakob Hlasek in 1988, played well against Novak. 
Federer took the first three games of the final set, then easily held serve the rest of the way to become the only undefeated player in his Gold Group. 
Hewitt, Safin, Moya and Costa are in the Red Group. Moya, at 2-0, clinched a semifinal berth on Wednesday. 
After three round-robin matches, the top two players in each group advance to Saturday's semifinals. Hewitt is trying to become the first player since Pete Sampras in 1996-97 to win this event in consecutive years.

NFL 
Peppers suspended 4 games, will appeal ... 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
Carolina Panthers rookie 

defensive end Julius Peppers 
was suspended for four games 
by the NFL for violating the 
league's substance-abuse poli­
cy, his agent said. 
Agent Marvin Demoff said the 

league office told him that 
Peppers had tested positive for 
a banned substance in a dietary 
supplement. A source close to 
Peppers, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said Peppers did 
not test positive for steroids 
Demoff said Peppers would 

appeal the suspension, meaning 
he can play in Sunday's game 
against Tampa Bay. 
In a statement released 

together with one from his 
agent, Peppers said he couldn't 
discuss the suspension until 
there's a ruling on his appeal. 
"While I would like to provide the fans with more information due to the legal ramifications I cannot comment on the situa­tion and I will not be able to until the appeal process is com­plete," he said. 
Peppers practiced with the Panthers (3-6) on Thursday, but did not make himself available to reporters. 
The 22-year-old player was 
an All-American at North 
Carolina, and after he decided 
to leave after his junior year, 
the Panthers kept him in his 
home state and made him the 
No. 2 overall pick in the draft. 
The 6-foot-6, 283-pound player 
has made an immediate impact, 
leading the NFL with 10 sacks. 
He also has one interception. 
Peppers can keep playing 
while his appeal is heard. 
"My understanding is, he will 
be our starting left defensive 
end this Sunday," said coach 
John Fox. "And all of my focus 
-and his, too -is on the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers." 
If the suspension is not over­
turned, Peppers would begin 
serving it immediately. 
Normally, appeals are heard on 
a Tuesdays, the regular day olT 
for NFL players. 
Panthers linebacker Mark Fields said the situation did not create a distraction for the team Thursday. 
"It's not that serious, so we 're not looking at it like it's that serious," Fields said. "We're playing Tampa Bay on Sunday, and he's playing." 
If Peppers is suspended for all four games, he would lose $235,000 in salary. lie signed a seven-year, $62 million contract in July, the richest deal in team history.

senior linebacker. Watson missed the first two games of the season with an illness. However, when he returned to the field. he made it clear that he would be a leader on the Notre Dame defense. 
"I said earlier in the year that when he stepped back into the lineup, it had a very calm­ing effect on our football team and not just a defensive state­rncn t," Willingham said. "It was a team statement because of his discipline, because of his knowledge and because of his will to be successful." 
Watson said that his will to be successful despite his ill­ness. is just another example of the Irish football team's return to national prominence. 
"I think it just exemplifies our entire program this year, how everything has just turned around in a new direction and a new commitment by the players on the team," he said. 
Although Willingham may be disappointed, the Irish coach probably won't see the award renamed anytime soon. 
"Now please understand, it is very appropriate for [the award to be named] for Dick Butkus," he said. "But I feel so strongly about what Courtney has brought to our football team and just our community. that I think in a kind of loose or lighthearted manner, it would be out of great honor and respect for him to win this award."

considerably tougher field, and they will have to challenge No. 4 Wisconsin, No. 7 Eastern Michigan. No. 9 Central Michigan, No. 17 Ohio State and others in order to keep their national championship qualifying hopes alive. 
"It's do or die," Irish junior and top runner Todd Mobley said. "There are no excuses. If we don't get it done, then our sea­son's ended. I think everyone knows it." 
Mobley will be running compet­itively with the team for the first time in weeks, after missing the Big Ea.st championships due to an injury. His absence at that event, held two weeks ago in Boston, considerably impaired the team's 
strength, and the Irish finished in fourth place. The team expects things to run more smoothly Saturday. 
"Now I'm back to normal," Mobley said. "I don't know if I'm in top form, but I know I'll be able to contribute enough to help our team." 
Having Mobley better should have a positive trickle-down effect for the other runners. 
"I think their mindsets will be a little better, knowing that we're all together, all in the race, 100 percent healthy," Mobley said. 
The men have finished in the top five in nine out of the past 10 years. 
The Irish womens squad, led by 2001 All American Lauren King and potential 2002 All Americans Molly Huddle and Jen Handley. is experiencing the best season in the program's history. 
King, a sophomore, won the Big East individual title and I luddle. King's counterpart on the course, took second. Senior Bandley has much experience leading the Irish in important races and fin­ished 12th in the Big East Championships. 
Even if they do not finish in one of the top two places, the Irish have made a strong case for an at-large bid. 
Last year, the Irish finished in second place at the regional meet, their highest finish since they began running in the Great Lakes region. Having finished in the top six during the last nine out of ten years. the Irish have always been solid in the district championship, but they never before have entered the race coming off such a successful season.

Soccer

Tournament Selection Committee named Notre Dame a host site for first-and second­round games. Friday's action opens with Purdue facing Eastern Illinois at 4:30 p.m. The Irish will then take on the Big Ten Tournament Champion Ohio State at approximately 7 
p.m. or at the conclusion of the earlier game. The winners of the opening round will square off in the second round sched­uled for 1 p.m. at Alumni Field. 
"To be honest. I was a little surprised," said Irish coach Handy Waldrum. "There are so many good teams in our region this year. I really thought Purdue would host since they defeated us this year in head to head competition. but I think the committee recognized the strength of our schedule. Playing at home in the tourna­ment is a definite advantage because it allows the kids to stay in a routine and not have to worry about traveling. We real­ly need the home crowd to come out ~nd support us this we.ek­end. 
Notre Dame finished the regu­lar season ranked No. 19 in the country with a record of 11-7. After a midseason loss to Purdue, in which Notre Dame saw its record drop to a modest 7-6, the Irish rebounded emphatically at the end of the season with four wins in their 
final five games. 

Even more impressive, three of these wins were against top 15 teams. The Irish hope to carrv their late-season momen­tum ·into this weekend's action. 
"We're really playing our best at the right time of the season," said Warner. "Practice has been really good the last few weeks. Everyone's really eager to play this Friday." 
Just like Notre Dame, the Buckeyes saved their best soc­cer for the end of the season. While Ohio State holds a record of only 10-10-1, they are com­ing off the heels of a surprising Big Ten Tournament Championship run. Last week, the Buckeyes claimed the Big Ten's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament after defeat­ing both No. 12 Penn State and No. 14 Purdue in games that ended in penalty kick shootouts. 
'Tm very impressed with them. They're much better than their record indicates," said Waldrum. "They're a real big, physical team like most other Big Ten teams. But where most Big Ten teams play a direct brand of soccer, Ohio State real­ly plays an attractive style of soccer. We've always had trou­ble with Big Ten teams because of their size. I expect a really tough game." 
"Just like us, they are really peaking at the right time," added Warner. "We're certainly not taking them lightly because of their record." 
Last year, the top-10 ranked Notre Dame womens soccer team entered the tournament with high expectation, but was upset by upstart Cincinnati in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Even though last year's team had a more impres­sive regular season record, the Irish didn't seem to play to their capabilities all season. 
"Coach really didn't have to say much about [last year's loss]." said Scheller. "Last year's loss is definitely still in the back of our minds. Everyone knows that we don't want that to happen again. We've already experienced so much during this season that I think this year we are prepared and ready to go."

Swimming ventures southwest for meet 
ByJOE HETTLER 

Associate Sports Editor 
Notre Dame's men swimming team Jost to Air Force earlier this season. So did Texas Christian University, the Irish opponent this weekend. 
However, some members of the Notre Dame swimming team don't think that's a good com­parison of the two teams. 
"When we lost to Air Force, it wasn't really comparable to when [Texas Christian] lost to them," freshman Patrick Davis said. "We lost to them at Air Force, which is 7,000 feet above sea level and [Texas Christian] lost to Air Force at home. It kind of makes a difference because of the differences in sea level." 
Losing to Air Force may be the only thing that the Irish and Horned Frogs have in common. The teams have opposite strengths and both will look to take advantage of these. Notre Dame should dominate the dis­tance meets, while Texas Christian has the edge in the sprint meets.

"They are very strong in sprints, but we're strong in dis­tance," Davis said. "We expect to get a lot of points in distance." 
Davis also added that the team is very excited to make another trip this early in the season. Davis said the freshman are especially excited. 
"I'm not used to making these big trips," Davis said. "It's really cool to go across the country and swim against these other teams." 
Notre Dame is also hoping to gain some momentum after beating Michigan State Nov. 8 at home. The Irish have been led by strong performances from the 400-medley team of Jason Fitzpatrick, Frank Krakowski, Doug Hauman and Tim Randolph. The team's depth in the 1000-meter freestyle was noticed against Michigan State, when Notre Dame's Patrick Davis, Matt Bertke and J.R. Teddy took second, third and fourth, respectively.

MENS BASKETBALL 
Irish anxious for first real game 
ByANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
Now it's for real. 
After a summer spent sweat­ing in the Joyce Center, three weeks of practice, countless scrimmages and a pair of exhi­bitions, Notre Dame finally takes the court Sunday for its first regular-season game. 
"We can't wait," senior Matt Carroll said. "We've been working so hard to get to this team's general reserved atti­tude on the court. But in a defense where players routine­ly switch on screens, the Irish say they have to start being a little more vocal. 
"It's just a matter of having a bunch of new faces," Dan Miller said. "We're getting used to playing with each other, and as weeks go on, we'll know where our guys are. Right now, we still have to work on it." 
The Irish are also searching 
for an

Guardians N o tr e 
Classic. If Notre Dame wins. the Irish face the win­ner of the Brown-IUPUI game Monday night and automatical­ly advance to the tournament's semifinals next week. 
Notre Dame initially decided to hop into the Guardians Classic as a way to add a pair of home games early in the sea­son before the Irish begin a rig­orous non-conference schedule. 
But the tournament gives the Irish a chance to start address­ing a pair of problems that sur­faced in their first two exhibi­tion games -finding rotation in the post and communicating on defense. 
Irish coach Mike Brey attrib­utes the relative lack of defen­sive communication to his 
Irish guard Dame's f i n a l exhibi­tion -Torin Francis, Tom Timmermans, Jordan Cornette, Rick Cornette and Jere Macura -a number the Irish coach said might have been a little too many. Francis and Cornette, both of whom have played major min­utes in the exhibition, will play significant roles this season. But how the other three flt in is still a mystery. "We're still searching a little bit," Brey said. "We're going to have to do that as best we can and still go after wins early. We'll be looking at some differ­ent things and who steps for­ward." While the Irish wait for their 

big men to develop, the perime­ter will help the Irish in the early part of the season. However, a rules change for this weekend might affect Notre Dame's long-range shooters. 
The Guardians Classic is played under international rules, meaning the lanes are wider and the 3-point arc is pushed back a little further. But that won't stop the Irish from hoisting treys Sunday. 
"That's something we're not going to think about," Carroll grinned. "For most of our guys, we've got deep range. we're not going to worry about it." 
The eight-team Guardians Classic counts as an exempted event. Four teams -Notre Dame, Belmont, Brown and !UPI -play at the Joyce Center while the other four ­Creighton. Texas Arlington, Furman and Alabama State ­compete at Creighton's gym. The four winners of Sunday's games advance to the semifi­nals, held next week in Kansas City. The four losers of Sunday's games play a consola­tion game Monday before the four winners play to determine seeding in the semifinals. 
The way the bracket is designed, the Irish could poten­tially face Creighton, who upset Florida last season in the NCAA Tournament. 
"If you run into a Creighton, it would be a good match-up for us," Brey said. "It would be like a Big East game."

Second season begins 
The Irish womens soccer team hosts the first two rounds ofthe NCAA Tournament while the mens and womens cross country teams try to qualify for the NCMs. 


By JOE LICA.NDRO 
Sports Writer 
The time is now for the Notre Dame womens soccer team. 
After a roller coaster, injury-plagued regular season, the Irish are eager to begin their second season against Ohio State this Friday night in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. 
With a three-week layoff since their last game as a result of not qualifying for the Big East tournament, the Irish players feel the extra time off was exactly what they needed to rejuvenate themselves before the tournament. 
"I think not playing in the Big East Tournament was the best thing that could have happened for us," starting forward Amy Warner said. "We've had so many injuries that it was good for us to get everyone healthy and ready to go for the NCAA Tournament." 
The Irish received some great news earlier this week when the NCAA

For both the Notre Dame mens and womens cross country teams, Saturday's Great Lakes Regional is the race they have been preparing for all season. 
The top two teams in both the mens and womens races will automatically qualify for the NCAA Championships, which will be held in Terre Haute, Ind. 
The Irish womens squad, ranked fifth nationally and coming off their first ever victory at the Big East Championship, has a shot at automatically qualifying for the NCAA Championships. 
The men, on the other hand, are hoping to finish high enough to warrant one of 13 at-large bids to the NCAA Championship, chosen by an NCAA committee. 
Both squads have to contend with one of the most competitive regional fields in the nation, with teams such as No. 12 Michigan and No. 19 Michigan State in the womens race. The men will have a

Courtney Watson named finalist for Dick Butkus award
-
By KATIE McVOY Associate Sports Editor 
Tyrone Willingham made it very clear that he believed Courtney Watson deserved to be a finalist for the Dick Butkus award. 
In fact, he felt so strongly about it that during a teleconfer­ence on Thursday when Watson was named one of three fmalists for the prestigious award, Willingham even suggested renaming the award. 
"It would be really kind of appropriate in a sense for me to make the request I'm going to make," Willingham said. "Because I think it would be in Courtney's honor to almost name the award after him." 
Watson joined Maryland's E.J. Henderson and Oklahoma's Teddy Lehman as a finalist for the award, which is presented annually to college football's best linebacker. The winner of the award will be announced Dec. 13 in Orlando. 
While Willingham was busy praising Watson's talent at the linebacker position, Watson was tightly focused on giving credit where he thought credit was due. 
"It's just a credit to my team­mates," Watson said. "You can't be a good player without the guys around you. It's the rededi­cation of the players and the phi­losophy of the coaches." 
Watson has been an integral part of a successful Irish defense that is holding its opponents to only 14.5 points per game. The Sarasota, Fla. native leads the team with 81 tackles, eight tack­les for a loss and three sacks. He's also recorded three inter­ceptions, including an intercep­tion that he returned 34 yards for a touchdown against Stanford. 

"I think Courtney, first of all, has placed a great deal of respect on his teammates, but I think so much of that should be credited to him because of his leadership," Willingham said. 
Being named a finalist for the Butkus award comes near the end of a season that had any­thing but a pleasant start for the
