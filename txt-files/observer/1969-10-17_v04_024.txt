the time it looked good; it looked like a few people could solve the problem. Counter insurgency appealed to the Army and to the public imagination. But perhaps Eisenhower said it best when he said that it would be foolhardy for us to launch a war unless we were prepared to launch it full-scale, as we did against Germany; and obviously such a war is impossible under the present conditions." 
Father Hesburgh speculated that the United States would be unable to militarily respond to another insurgency similar to VietNam. 
"The American people simply would not abide by it," said the University President. "Such renewed action would be politically disastrous." When asked what his own response to such a renewed involvement would be, Father Hesburgh said, "I really don't know." 
Father Charles McCarragher, Vice President of Student Affairs, shared Father Hesburgh's warm feelings for the

moratorium. In an interview he said it was "done with great dignity and with great reverence." 
"I believe the non-violent attitude was accepted by everyone," McCarragher continued, "for certainly we all believe in peace." 
McCarragher said that his first reaction to the moratorium was one of happiness because, "nothing but dignity, reverence and sincerity was demonstrated from the time the moratorium started until it ended in the afternoon." He expressed the

belief that "everyone understood what others were doing and why they were doing it." 
He did find fault, however, with the destroying of draft cards that highlighted the Moratorium day Mass. He voiced disapproval of "draft card tearing, particularly at the Mass," but tempered his criticism by saying that the act was performed with "tact and respect." 
McCarragher and Hesburgh are in agreement over the significance of the moratorium. 
''The impact of this moratorium," said McCarragher, "must be felt by America's leaders." 
From the conservative end on the political spectrum, reactions clashing strongly with those of Roickle and Ryan were articulated by Tom Thrasher and Chris Wolfe. 

Former SLC member, Chris Wolfe, expressed his respect for certain segments of those supporting the moratorium who sincerely put forth reasonable and moderate arguments. However, a large segment, he feels, does not possess this moderation. 
He deplored this great number of people so dogmatic in their belief of the absolute immorality of the war. Wolfe described this group as a disturbing element on campus. 
"The academic community should be characterized by ra tiona! discussion, not by mindless acceptance of minority views and of what is essentially propaganda," Wolfe contended. 
He also noted that nothing changed his view that Wednesday was a day of propaganda rather than a day of discussion. 
Wolfe was disturbed that many people don't see reasonable arguments for the morality of war within the confines of the moral principles of Catholicism or ChristianitY. 
Thrasher, one of this year's Stay Senators, was not impressed with the turnout for the moratorium. Estimates he received from those connected with the events ranged from 400 to 2000, and he remarked that the turnout was proportionally small to the student body. 
He was very surprised by the great number of students who attended class as regular on Wednesday, and he described those who went to others' classes in addition to their own as "acting as individuals." Thrasher contended that classes were in 50% attendance . 
Thrasher also decried the decision of many professors to cancel their classes. 

"Due to the propaganda and Publicity concerning the moratorium, coupled with the student's desire to cut classes, some teachers allowed themselves to be intimidated and denied the students the right to attend class."

No doubt there is much validity to their argument. There are limitations though, for one could argue that the exploration of space might open up untold avenues and provide a wealth of knowledge which would benefit mankind to a great degree in the future. There are also certain economic questions involved in channeling all funds spent on space exploration into social action work. 
Perhaps the whole question can provide an opportunity for the beginning of a better relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. Scientists of both countries suggest that cooperation on space exploration between the two giants would be worthwhile. The joint effort would not only save each side countless numbers of dollars but might also aid toward curtailing "space competition" which in all likelihood influences many decisions about each country's space objectives. Together both countries could agree on targets for exploration which could prove to be more in the interest of 
mankind as a whole. 
We encourage both countries to seriously consider the possibility, and ask Americans to support the idea. Such cooperation will not only bring tangible benefits to both countries but also hasten the day when the two learn to live on more amiable terms with 
one another. 
The Fieldhouse 
This evening's pep rally will be held in it's rightful home, the Notre Dame fieldhouse. 
Without a doubt pep rallies just couldn't be the same any where else. At least not for 
the Notre Dame men who have ever shared the emotionalism that goes into a rally in the 
grand old place. 
The university intends to have the old girl torn down, and if she goes we know many 
an alumni, Notre Dame fan, and student that will mourn her passing. 
Funny thing, in times when traditionalism is seemingly an outmoded thing, a lot of 
people seem to wonder if the fieldhouse really deserves what she is going to get. Or 
rather, if the N.D. fans deserve to go without pep rallies in the fieldhouse. 
Without knowing all the factors which are governing the university's decision to have 
her removed, it would be foolish to argue for existence on the basis of football rallies 
alone. We would like to though-as would a number of Notre Damer's. 
We feel that there is a definite need to reexamine the decision to scuttle it. The Notre 
Dame Art Department which is sorely in need of space is looking to the fieldhouse as afi 
answer to its needs. 
Professor Thomas Fern, acting head of the Notre Dame Art Department, has come up 
with a $1,825,000 renovation plan which provides for a face lifting which would make 
the fieldhouse a "center of the arts on campus." There would be classroom space, rooms 
for studios and exhibition areas for the aspiring. The plan also provides for the possibility 
of wood carving facilities and a metal working shop. They are also thinking about 
constructing a forum with tiered seats to be used for plays, poetry readings, concerts and 
other cultural events. 
We understand the university's current financial problems. Thus we can see where the 
university can not afford to make a commitment at this time to Professor Fern's plans. 
We feel however, that there is no need to rush the-demolition of the building. Professor 
Fern should be granted adequate time to present his plans and to search for the money 
needed. 
Maybe we could arrange to keep the fieldhouse around for a little longer anyway. At 
least until Purdue and Pat O'Brien have the chance to see her again next year.

Letter 
Editor:. 
We recpgnize the concern for peace on. the part of college students through-out the nation. We are aware of the dedication of the youth movement so seen in the recent mobilization of the October 15th Moratorium for Peace. 
There is one problem of particilar concern to the American Red Cross that we hope will be brought to the attention of ther students on your campus involved in this movement as well as other students and faculty. Recent figures show some 413 men arc known to be prisoners of war in North Vietnam. There are another 918 missing and believed captured. These men are not there by choice. All Americans of good will should insist on their receiving the humane treatment called for by the Conventions. 
Although North Vietnam is a signator to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which covers the treatment of prisoners of war, it has refused to allow delegates of the International Committee of 
The American Red Cross is intensifying its efforts to open channels of communication and relief to U.S. servicemen being 
held as prisoners of war in North Vietnam. 
A resolution sponsored by the American society urging that prisoners of war be given the benefits and protection of the Geneva Conventions was adopted without a dissenting vote last month by the representatives of 77 governments and 91 national Red Cross societies attending the quadrennial International Conference of the Red Cross in Istanbul. 
Last week the American Red Cross followed this action with a cable message to Red Cross societies in all parts of the world, asking that they appeal to the Red Cross society of North Vietnam to take appropriate steps to ensure that American prisoners are receiving the

Red Cross to visit prison camps where Americans are being held. The Hanoi government has also refused to provide the International Committee with the names of American prisoners they hold or to permit the regular flow of mail between pruoners and their families in this country. 
The American Red Cross is intensifying its efforts to open channels of communication in accordance with the Conventions. Our responsibility as an organization and our humane concern for the welfare of these men is our only motivation. 
This effort can be even more effective if we have the support of students in recognizing this Red Cross mission.

UNION SOCIAL COMMISSION 
Dr. Robert Gordon, associate dean of the College of Life Sciences at the University of Notre Dame, has been appointed to a six-year term on the United States National Committee of the International Union of Bio­logical Sciences, by the president of the National Academy of Science, Dr. Philip Handler. 
The committee advises the 
president of the Academy on all 
matters concerning United Sta­
tes participation in international 
programs in the biological sci­ences. 
As Gord!Sn begins his term, one of the most important prob­lems facing the committee con­cerns the continuation of the International Biological Pro­gram. This program, originally planned as a five-year venture, is scheduled to disband in 1971. The committee would like to continue receiving information from the 60-country network of biologists, who have been evalu­ating the world's environmental quality, productivity, and popu­

lation status. Gordon, whose research inter­
. ests include ecology, population dynamics and cold-blooded ver­tebrates, is also a proponent of better communication between the scientific community and laymen and hopes to help the committee set up a world-wide communication system for sci­entific information. In addition, he is a member of the Pacific Science Association's standing committee for science informa­tion. 
His other memberships in­clude: the American Association for Advanced Science, the American Society for Zoology, the ~cological Society of Ameri­ca, the Herpetologists' League, and the Herpetological Society of Japan. 
Gordon has taught at Notre Dame since 1958, and has served as bqth acting head of the bio­logy department and editor of the American· Midland Naturalist.

Emergencies close schools 
A comprehensive national survey of Catholic school facilities by a University of Notre Dame educational research team has com:luded that Catholic school closings have occurred as emergency measures rather than as part of an overall educational plan. 
In an article in the November 
U.S. Catholicflubilee, Dr. Richard fl. Metzcus, an assistant professor of education at Notre Dame, and two of his doctoral students, Philip T. Sciortino and the Rev. Lawrence M. Deno, report on "Project Schoolhouse," an analysis of data supplied by 147 diocesan school superintendents and 346 Catholic school administrators. 
The study revealed that Catholic school closings and grade eliminations effective this September were: 
--Largely the result of emergency measures and not f Iowing from a recognized censensus on the goals ot Catholic education. 
-Most prevalent among small, parish-controlled elementary schools handicapped by size in trying to provide a quality education. 
--Generally decided by a combination of administrative levels, with diocesan authority mentioned most often and ~chool boards rarely cited, leading to the report's conclusion that "existent Catholic school boards were not 
perceived  to  be  policy-making  
units."  
-Most  frequently  attributed  

to an insufficient supply of religious as teachers, poor financial support, and dwindling enrollment, but more realistically described as a result ol the inefficiency of a decentralized "system" of 
education. 
--Usually effected without firm plans for utilization of abandoned facilities. 
-Indicative of "the inability of Catholic schools to confront current educational problems." 
The report said its findings "project a continuance of c n ro II rncnt losses, grade eliminations, and school closings," and its authors urged that more consideration be given the manner in which such decisions are made. 
"Future decisions regarding the existence of a school or a grade level should be mitigated not by expediency, but by an mformed effort to establish a viable system of Catholic schools," the report stated. 
It advocated a widening of decision-making to include parishoners, religious communities, and the clergy, and it stressed the necessity of 

Dr.Fahey headsOER 
Dr. Frank J. Fahey, associate professor of sociology and an­thropology was recently named associate director of the Office for Education Research (OER) at the University of Notre Dame. The Rev. William B. Friend is acting director. 
Fahey, who is also associate director of the Social Science Training and Research Labora­tory, is known for his research with youth, Catholic school studies, poverty and manpower problems. He is also interested in applying computer program min and statistics to studies in educa­tion. 
The OER became a compo­nent of the new Institute for Studies in Education at Notre Dame last July. Formerly it was a part of the Center for the Study of Man in Contemporary Society. 
In expanding its areas of inter­est to become a continuing pro­gram of basic and applied re­search and training, the OER has added several new staff mem­bers.
