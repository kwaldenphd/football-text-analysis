Reagan airs budget 
President ReagN YESTERDAY GAVE HIS Cabinet its first look at the new round of budget cuts he wants, which likely will include a virtual across-the-board trimming next year and total reductions of $30 billion in fiscal 1983 and $44 billion in 1984. The Pentagon budget will be one of those targets for cuttin~ and sources who decline to be named said only a few ' sacred cows'' would escape the budget axe. chief white House spokesman David R.Gergen told reporters after the meeting that Reagan still has not decided · how deep to cut the defense budget. But, Gergen said, the other departments were given a range of figures to work with, pending the final decision on Pentagon spending. For fiscal1982, which begins Oct.l, the department heads were told to expect across-pthe-board cuts, Gergen said, but he refused to reveal the percentages being discussed. -AP

U.S. crime rate rises 
The number of major crimes in America surged by 9 percent again last year and only one out of five resulted in an arrest, the FBI REPORTED YESTERDAY. The rise in the 1980 crime rate was the second substantial increase following three years of relative stability. The crimes counted were murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault and the non-violent crimes of burglary, lrceny and theft and motor vehicle thefts. The 9 percent increase in 1980 followed an increase of 9.1 percent the previous year. By contrast, the 1978 increase had been only 2 percent, the 1977 rate dropped 3 percent and there was no change in 1976. But the 13,295, 400 serious crimes reported in 1980 represented an increase of 55 percent over the number reported in 1970. The population increased by only 9 percent from 1970 to

NATO sponsors war games 
The armies of the Western alliance, faced with the growth of the Soviet navy and cuts in their own budgets are holding large-scale war games this month in the muddy fields and cold seas in and around Belgium, where a real battle for Europe would take place. More than 400,000 North Atlantic Treaty Organization soldiers, sailors and airmen are taking part in the maneuvers, which include the airlift of 17,000 U.S.-based soldiers to Europe in the annual ''Reforger'' reinforcement exercise. The NATOmaneuvers, which will reach a peak of activity in mid-September, are designed to test how well allied troops work tegether and how quickly the United States could come to the aid of Western Europe if there were a Soviet attack from land and sea. -AP

Sick of the Fighting Irish 
Notre Dame, 1\ome of the Fighting Irish. 
Around these parts, that Is a proud claim. But a couple of thousand miles to the east, there is little pride to be gleaned these/days from that pugilistic nickname. In fact, for many Irish, the pervasive adjective preceding their nationality is constant grim reminder of the sec­
tarian violence that continues to eat away at the Emerald Isle's social fabric. 
During recent months, Irish troubles have figured more prominently on American newspaper front pages and news broadcasts than at any time since the major upheavals and riots ofthe late sixties. Seldom in the past fifteen years has the situation in Ireland been so fre· quently reported to the American public as during the year 1981 -a year to be remembered darkly for the re-institution by Bobby Sands and Company of the an· dent Irish protest ofdeath by starvation. 
My purpose here is not to give any new gruesome details of the ongoing tragedy that is progressing each day at Belfast's Maze Prison -and in the streets ofCath­olic and Protestant neighborhoods of the North. Nor will I offer any new solutions to the problem. We have heard too much of both failed solutions and broken promises. 
Let's think for a moment, 
however, about the way in difficu which Americans -and the taken all the wind ·out of the Notre Dame community in group's sails. particular -has reacted to What can be done? Cer­this flood of media attention tainly more than what is on Ireland. being undertaken now. The

Yet when was the last time that the black hole ofNor-then Ireland's political and religious dilemma war­ranted attention by a U.S. Secretary of State? Or a Vice-Presidential visit? Or even a Congressional junket? 
Ukewise, any glance at a Notre Dame-Saint Mary's phone directory reveals a plethora of Irish names. Yet I do not recall any major campus symposiums or marches on the question of the Irish politics in recent months. 
The University has many links with Ireland, both academically and socially, but why don't we have more access to knowledgeable and qualified speakers on the problem? Notre Dame's only class this fall on Irish his­tory has even been cancelled. 
We are seriously concerned with rapid deployment forces and "strategic concensuses" in other areas ofthe world while the Central Intelligence Agency is being beefed up to destabilize regimes from the Carribbean to the East Indies.

focused on El Salvador? 
Considering the number of Irish-Americans in politics accross the nation, and the enormous body of Irish-American citizens, the U.S. should have profound influence in the Northern Ireland crisis. In the seventies, Sen. Edward Kennedy, Gov. Hugh Carey, and Speaker O'Neill formed a rather loose discussion group to discourage the underground pipeline of gun-money and weapons being sent by well-meaning but mis­directed Irish-Americans to IRA caches in Eire. Political 
American cruise missiles, some with nuclear warheads, to be stationed on British soil, certainly ~merica's power ofpersuasion (and economic and technical ass is· tance) could be applied to the Irish problem. 
The wounds of hundreds of years of religious and economic difficulties will not be easily healed in Ireland, and the process will take more than a wink ofan eye to complete. But the Camp David treaties brou8ht together the militarily, religiously, and politically diver­gent nations of Israel and Egypt, and remarkable progress has been achieved in the span ofseveral years. 
The only difference appears to be the amount of ef­f9rt that the U.S. Is willing to exert in its handling ofthe Irish problem. 
The time has come for Ireland to be thought ofless as a tourist attraction -that just so happens to have a few religious and economic problems -and more of as a bona fide world trouble spot worth the serious atten­tion and full potential of both the United States and Notre Dame.

O'Connor favors death penalty 
WASHINGTON (AP)--Sandra Day O'Connor, treading cautiously toward Senate con­firmation as a Supreme Coun Justice, said yesterday she suppons the death penalty for some crimes and is opposed to forced busing to desegregate 
public schools. 
In her second day of testimo­ny before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mrs. O'Connor said she twice spoke personally with President Reagan before she was announced as his choice to become the first woman justice on the court. 
She declined to describe those conversations, but said no promises were made on how she would vote on any particu­lar issue. 
I was not asked (by Reagan) to make any commtttment con­cerning . . . how I would resolve any issue that might come before the court,'' 
0'Connor said in the answer to 
a series of questions from Sen. 
Charles Grassley, R-lowa. 
She said it would be impro­per to discuss what subjects she talked .£bout with Reagan during those conversations, one which was held at the White House. 
Mrs. O'Connor said her views on forced busing were shaped by a childhood experience of riding n miles 10 a daily roundtrip on a bus from her home on an Arizona ranch across the desert to school. "I found that very disturbing to me as a child," she said, "I am sure that other children who had to ride long distances as a child shared that experi­ence.'' 
While emphasizing she was not talking about constitutional or legal reasons for or against busing, she said that as a device for integrating schools it

Plans for participation in the College Bowl were one of the items on the agenda of this week's Saint Mary's Board of Governance meeting. 
CALLED AN "academic sport of the mind," the College Bowl consists of two teams compet­ing to answer questions of a liberal arts nature, ranging from biology to sociology. This year Saint Mary's need ten teams, composed of four mem­bers each, with a faculty mem­ber or administrator serving as coach. 
The winning team from Saint Mary's will go to Illinois State University where they will meet other teams from the midwest. This competition will take place in early March. 
Regtstration for the College Bowl began this week and wtll continue through Oct.14. In­terested students are invited to come to an orientation meeting on Sept. 29. All competition will take place in Carroll Hall. 
The Board also discussed plans for a ''College Career Day," scheduled for later this month. Heading up a list of twelve speakers will be keynote speaker Juliet Noon Lester, a 1955 graduate of Saint Mary's, who will speak on the value of a liberal arts education. The Board encouraged Saint Mary's and Notre Dame wo­men to attend. 
A "tail-gater" with the alum­nae of Saint Mary's is slated for Saturday, Oct. 10, the day ofthe Florida State ~arne. The purpose of this activtty, accord­tog to Student Body President Eileen Murphy, is "to provide more interaction between the students and the alumnae of Saint Mary's." 
The Board also announced "Energy Awareness Week," scheduled for next week with proposed activities includin~ a bin for recyclable cans to be placed between the dining hall and the parking lot; an orienta­tion and movie regarding ener­gy; and two guest speakers, Mary Failey from the U.S. Department of Energy, and Dr. 

V. Paul Kenney, of the Physics Department of Notte Dame. 
Ftnally, the student govern­ment announced that it will post petitions to show their solidarity with people protest­ing the budget cuts for the 
needy on social programs.

As an Arizona state senator she favored legislation urging federal legislation forbidding busing for desegregation, she said. 
On the death penalty, Mrs. O'Connor reca11ed sponsoring legislation to revive capital punishment after the Supreme Coun struck down statutes in most states, and then applying the same statute later as a state jud~e. 
"i felt tt was a appropriate vote then and I have not changed my view,'' she said. 
However, she added without elaboration that she opposed legislation in Arizona which made the death penalty man­datory for some crimes. 
There were continued state­ments of support from most committee members.

Soviets conduct maneuvers 

COPENHAGEN* DENMARK (AP)--A Soviet armada of 60-80 ships, one of the largest such fleets seen in the Baltic since World War II, moved south along the Soviet coastline yes­terday as part of widespread military exercises, Scandina­vian intelli~ence reports said. 
The Damsh Defense Intelli­gence Service predicted landing exercises would take place near Baltiysk, 15 miles north of Poland, by the weekend. 
A Danish spokesman said the aircraft carriers Kiev and Leningrad were part of the fleet that massed overnight off Vent­spils on the Latvian coast and was moving in formation through heavy fog. 
The s~ips are passing through waters JUSt off the Byelorussian and Baltic defense areas, where nearly 100,000 Soviet troops are reported on maneuvers. 
Similar war games by NATO forces are under way, with the land portions to begin next week. An estimated 400,000 NATO troops are involved in 26 separate exercises in the Atlan­tic, the Baltic and in Europe.

''We do not as Israeli citizens interfere with discussions be­tween the two branches of the American government,'' Begin said. ''But as members of the government . . . we are duty bound to tell the innermost truth and we belive that this problem is very dan~erous to our national security. '

Later, Begin told Israeli cor­respondents he hoped to have a memorandum of agreement before leaving Washington late today. Among the mea­sures that could be under consideration are the pre­positioning of U.S. arms in Israel for use by American troops in an emergency and giving Israel access to infor­mation gathered by U.S. spy satellites. 
Questioned about his stand on Reagan's projected arms sale to Saudia Arabia, the Israeli leader stiffly rejected any sug­gestion he had a~reed to muffle his criticism m return for a pre_sidential promise to strengthen ''strategic co­operation" between the United States and Israel. 
The $8.5 billion arms package due to be put to a vote next month in Congress, would pro­vide Saudi Arabia with the means to reach Israeli territory with U.S.-built jet fighters and to conduct wide-ranging sur­veillance from five Boeing radar planes. 
cises, said "We think the landing exercise will be near the Baltiysk Sea, where they should arrive by midday to­day." 
Baltiysk is about 50 miles from Gdansk, Poland, where the Polish independent union Soli­darity is concluding its first congress.

New phone system-
University plans expansion 
By SONYA STINSON 
NEWS STAFF 
The University will implement a new telephone. system for administration and faculty members effective in· .January 1982, that will switch all faculty and administration lines to a Dimension electronic touch­tone method for telephone communications. 
This system is more efficient than the mechanical Centrex system in which the telephones have rotating dials now utilized by students and faculty. 
Bro. Kieran Ryan, assistant vice-president of Business Affairs, said that once the Dimension system is installed, the University will use the Centrex system exclusively for student Hoes. The change will allow the much needed expan­sion of the 'Capacity for tele­phone seryices ot accommodate the increasing influx of stu­dents. 
"We have reached the limits of the Centrex system, which has 5,ooo lines," said Bro. Ryan. ''The choice was either to install another Centrex or go to tht· new Dimension system. We wanted to avoid putting in another Centrex system." 
Under the current Centrex service, 3,100 of the 5,000 lines are used for student tele­phones, with the remaining 1,900 lines for faculty and administration. The separate 
St. Francis Shoppe features· Third World crafts 
By ROGER WILKE New.r Staff 
Few people have heard of The Saint Francis Shoppes or know 
that  the  main  shop  for  the  
country  is  right  here  on  the  
Notte Dame campus  

Located on St. Mary'' road, next to the Fatima Retreat Center, the ''Shoppe" is a voluntt:er, non-J;>roflt organiza­tion created to gtve people from Third World countnes a market for their handcrafted goods. 
In 1977, Fr. Ken Maley, a pastor in South Bend, travelled to Mexico. While there, he saw many people who had no livelihood except for the hand· made goods they sold in the streets. Fr. Maley bought these goods, returne~ to South Bend and sold them. In this way, he was selling the crafts for a low price in the United States and also supplying the 
Third World people with an income. Soon, Fr. Maley was selling enough goods to open a shop, that is The Saint Francis Shoppe here on campus. 
The Saint Francis Shoppe was started with two goals in mind. 
What do football and beet 
have In common? BEER BALLS 5 gallons of dtaft beet In a no deposit keg. 
Petfe«:t fot tallgatots and post game celebtatlons. 
OAK DAIRY PARTY STORE 1129 Stateline Road 684-4950 open sunday 
michigan law... ND smc checks 
The first was to help people who have no income or altern­ative way of life and the second was to make the American people aware of the lifestyles, values, and customs of other countries. 
The shop accom1;1lishes the first goal by buying mdividual's goods from areas such as Mexico, Asia, and Africa and selling them without a profit in the United States. 
The second goal-in accompl­ished when customers visit one of the shops. The "Shoppe" at Notre Dame has six rooms full of handmade objects. It feature jewelry, charms carved animals onyx obl.ects and religious articles at ow prices. 
Mr. Michael Varga runs the shop which is open Monday through Saturday from 10:00 
a.m. to 6:00 p.m. He emphas­izes that the shop is on campus and "is a non-profit organiz­ation solely for the benefit of the people it buys from." 
Varga continued, ''The results of our work areboth tangible and intangible. They have to do ministration and faculty will begin with 239 instead of the current 283 prefix. Students and faculty who wish to reach one another by phone will have to dial a 7-digit number. 
..  
system will allow up  to  5,000  
lines for student use.  
Telephone  numbers  for  ad­ 

Bro. Ryan said that the new system wiH facilitate the order and convenience of on-campus communications, and that the efficiencey of communication is the reason all on-campus stu­dents are provided with a non-optional telephone service. ".We _simply c~nnot allow the sttuatton 10 whtch a student is unable to be reached by phone," he stated. 
At one time the student tele­phone service was optional, he said, but the method was disorderly and impractical be­cause of the required installat-, ion and removal of telephones from year to year. 
The charge for student serv­ices is determined by an asses­sment of the total cost of telephone services for everyone which is divided "as equitably as possible" among all the students, taking into account the various types of student accommodations (singles, doubles, quads, etc.). The charge per student ranges from $40-60 a year. 
Students must charge all long distance calts to a separate bitling number provided by Indiana Bell. Recently, many stUdents have complained of difficulty in getting through to outside operators when trying to make long distance calls, especially on weekends. 
When asked to comment, Bro. Ryan said that the inconven­ience is due to the limited number of outside lines avail­able compared to the number of students trying to make calls. "With only 120 outgoing lines, we cannot accommOdate every­one at once," he said. 
The lines are especially busy around 11 P.M. each night and on weekends, when students try to ta:ke advantage of lower rates. According to Bro. Ryan, there is nothing that can be done about the situation.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)­Last year, Jerry Brown was humihated m the Democratic presidential primaries and ridi­culed in comic strips as ''Gov­ernor Moonbeam.'' 
This year, he's been besieged by allegations of political mis­conduct by his staff, an aborted impeachment drive and the plague of Mediterranean fruit flies, which some critics say he hel~ed aggravate because he vactllated on pesticide spray­in£. 
Nevertheless, however dimly his J?Olitical star may be glim­menng, the California governor is back on the campaign trail, running for the Senate seat held by Republican S.I. Hayakawa. And, on the Democratic side, Brown is leading in the early

Brown changes image, prepares for campaign 
polls. 
He has alreadv raised $1. 2 million for hts campatgn, more than double what his nearest foe has raised. And despite his erratic record as a prestdential candidate, Brown ts regarded as a persuasive campaigner in California, which is more recel?­tive than other regions to hts futuristic "spaceship earth" 
' platform and his philosophy of "small is beautiful." 
In this campaign, Brown is not abandoning those themes, but he is sounding more like tradit­ional ploiticians. 
Instead of talking about "the existential ed~e," as he did in the Wisconsm primary last year, Brown now talks about helping the American electron­ics industry gain "the compet­itive edge" overJapan. He still quotes ''The Whole Earth Cata­logue,'' but now notes when "Fortune Magazine" says the same thing. 
Brown disputes su~gestions he is deliberately avotding the phrasing that triggered the ''Governor Moonbeam'' spoofs, but he concedes there is a different emphasis. ''I'm not static. The world doesn't stand still," he says. 
Brown says he is running on his "record of accomplish­ments'' as governor the/ast 6 years. "We've droppe from third to 25th among the states in taxes per capita. We're creating jobs at a rate 50 percent higher than the rest of the nation. On crime, we have tougher laws and tougher jud­ges. We're sending twice as many people to prison.'' 
In the Democratic primary next June 8, Brown's principal challenger will likely be Assemblyman Leo McCarthy of San Francisco, former speaker of the state Assembly and Brown's 1976 presidential cam­paign chairman. 
McCarthy has since become one of Brown's most vocal Democratic critics, especially after Brown endorsed a series of conservative economic pro­posals, among them the taxcut­ting Proposition 13. 
In addition to Hayakawa, who at 75 is seeking re-election despite party urgings .ot step aside, the GOP race is full of political celebrities. 
Rep. Barry Goldwater ] r. leads polls for the GOP nomin­ation, followed by Hayakawa, Rep. Pete McCloskey, who in 1972 challenged President Richard Nixon as an anti-war candidate for president, and Maureen Reagan, the presid­ent's daughter. 
Brown is not faring as well against possible GOP oppon-

ents as. he is in polls which list only Democrats. In The Calif­ornia Poll released Friday, Brown trailed Goldwater and McCloskey in direct match-ups, and led Hayakawa by a margin of only 48 percent to 38 percent. 
The most serious problem Brown faces today, however, is California's Medfly infestation, which is threatening the state's entire economy. 
Brown claims he followed the best pest eradication advice, but critics say the medfly spread across -California because he have in to environ­mentalists and delayed pestic­ide spraying. "People are looking for a scapegoat, and I'm the logical target,'' he says.

The Social Concerns Film series begins Tuesday of next week. Bill Pfeiffer is planning a Latin American Week to take place sometime next month and has scheduled a number of speakers to opent the students to an understand­ing of the responsibilities of "First World" citizens. Murday's philosophy sees a student government which serves the student body, and this· year's government works to attain that goal.

''There's hatted out there(a­mong Democratic votecs). It's more than a political falling out.'' 
Foes also accuse the 4j-year -old governor of seekin~ a Senate seat only to posttion himself to run a third time for president. Brown does not deny ambitions to run for president again, but he promis­es it will·not be in 1984.. 
Brown also has been wounded 
. by allegations that his staff misused a state computer for political purposes and then altered and destroyed evidence to cover up the violations. Brown's troubles are reflected in his decline in the oolls. He says he isn't worried about the polls and predicts he'll be "a formidable political force in this state for the next 20 years.'' Brown's Father, Former Gov. Edmund Brown agrees "any­body would be crazy not to say that Jerry's been wounded."

But Van Dyke says state­ments Samples made after the murder referred to pre-Vietnam problems, including shooting himself in the stomach when he was 13. Van Dyke has termed Samples a sexual sadixt and says the self-inflicted wound reflects abnormal sexual fantasies. 
Experts who examined 
Samples after the murder were d1vided about whether the shooting was an accident and whether Samples had serious troubles before he went to Vietnam. 
Van Dyke has also produced a never-mailed letter Samples wrote to a former flrlfriend in May 1970. In it, he outlined a fantasy about slashing stomach and desemboweling women, acts that resembled the event­ual stabbing. ' 
The district attorney claims ize on hiscombat to win commutation. He notes that Samples never. raised the Viet­nam defense until several years into his imprisonment. 
But the veteran's lawyer, Michael Bailey, said: "Duane Samples never attempted to use post-Vietnam delayed stress 
syndrome to gain sympathy or as an excuse" and, after years of therapy. 
When Samples and other veterans returned from Vietna, Bailey said, "the nation re­jected them and accepted no responsibility for their pain and alienation. Samples struggled alone with his anguish and it led him to a brutal and dastard­ly crime." 
Samples pleaded quilty. Today he says he deserved punishment but that he has been rehabilitated. He says he would like a chance to make up to society for his crime. 
"I'm not going to stop or give up on myself," Samples said. "I know it's humanly possible to spend the rest of my life here

musician with a message 
Can a musician who communicates good and love be succesful in the music business? Phil Keaggy is a man who communicates theGood News of the Gospel to all people, and according to expens in the music business, he is successful. While recording one of his albums at Electric Ladyland Studios, the late .Jimi Hendrix saw Keaggy in action and supposedly lau<fed him as one of the finest guitarist in the world. 
When Keaggy take the stage, his music reveals an acute sensitivity to the frustrations of everyday life. Perhaps what is more unponant than this sensitivity is his attitude of encouragement and the advise he offers as a solution. 
The solution he offers is one that he came to while he was trying to cope with one of the harshest realities of life: death. ] ust as Keaggy seemed to be reaching his peak, touring with with Chtcago, Yes, and Traffis, and having won the praise of Jimi Hendrix for his outstanding style, his mother was killed in a car accident. 
Stunned by the sudden death ofhis mother, Keaggy felt a shallowness within his spirit, and turned to God, a God he had not paid much attention to during his Catholic upbringing back in Youngstown, Ohio. This proved to be the turning point in Keaggy's life. He immedtately sensed the reality of the beginning of a personal relationship with ] esus Christ and began to approach life with a deaper sense of purpose.

Notre Dame vs. South : a modem Civil War

After an IIlustrous career on tbe Notre Dame sports media 1cene, Tim "Bone" Bourret was na~d ..U.Soclate Sports lnformatton Directorat Clemson UnlverJity In Soutb Carolina. His two-1lded Involvement In tbe rivalry between Notre Da~ and scbools of tbe Southeastern and Atlantic Coast Conferences (plus a handful of lntkp.ndents) makes blm more than qualified to autbor tbls article on tbe hatred, or 1ers say lntrn~e rivalry between Notre 
Da~ and tbe Soutb. 
By11M BOURRET S/)«UUIto 'I"M Oblerv~r 
For reuons more sociological than pen10nal, Notre Dame Is not particularly popular with coUrge football fans ofthe otherwl~e ho8pltable South. There has never been a warm reception for the Blur and Gold (or lilht Blue, or green or whatever shade they are wearing) In the South for reasons of religion, pall wan or jealouay, especially In conkmporary tlmea. 
Any Individual railed In the North who mlgraks to the South for employment or aome o«her reason, wiU document the feeling among southerners that they arc atlll ftghting the Civil War -"The War ofNorthern Agreton" as some call lt. In athletic the natural rivalry caUICd by physical competltJon makes the blood to run thicker, and when Notre Dame It Involved It tuma to cement. When you come to the South from the North. you are a Damn Yankee. But, when you move to tbc South from the Golden Dome, you're twice u bad -you're a Notre Dame Yankee. 
It all itarted In the !860'1 wbcn a team led 
by Coach Grant pulled the naked reverse 
against Coach Lee's squad to score a late 
touchdown In the original North-South game. 
Since then, the South has been trying to get 
revenge, even though the North doesn't 
realize it. The feeling has carried over Into the 
grand game ofcoUege footbaU, especially 
when Notre Dame is involved. 
The rivalry serves to motivate the southern squads because they look forward to beating Notre Dame, more than Notre Dame look! forward to beating them. "We have rivalries In our conference that date back to the tum of the century, but that game against Notre Dame In 1977 was second to none In importance to us," says AJ Adams, former assistant sports information director at Clemson. "Coach (Frank) Howard scheduled that game in the late-'60s, and we had a special news conference In 1968 just to announce It, even thought it would not be played for about 10 yean." 
On the field, the motivation instiUed In players can be frightening, and, in the case or the 1'977 Mississippi-Notre Dame game, dltutrous. "During the whole game the guy opposite me was like a man posseiiCd," said Ken MacAfee In a postgame Interview. "He called me all sort& ofnames, It was like fighting In the CivlJ War." 
Former Clemson cheerleaderJoey Erwin summarized the rivalry motivation on a religious plateau. "When Notre Dame came to the Valley ( Ocmson) It was the Northern Catholics against the Southern Baptists. They (Notre Dame) didn't hear any Hall Marys In the atandl at Clemson."

Emotions run high as Irish await Tigers 
By KELLY SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
For the fans, It's the anticipation ofan 
explosive afternoon ofcollege footbaU. 
For the players, It's the anticipation after 
months and months ofprepartation. 
And for Coach Gerry Faust, It's the 
anticipation of a lifetime dream come true. 
"I know it'U be a real emotional moment for me the first time we go through that tunnel and hit the field," exclaims Faust "That's something I've thought about a great deal since coming to Notre Dame." 
The I :30 p.m. kickoff against the Louisiana State Tigers figures to be one ofthe most enthuaiatlc season openers the Irish ever have had. Yet Faust doesn't want the emotion surrounding his Notre Dame debut to run complekly wild. "The players can sense when you're relaxed, so I'll try and control myself," he explains. "A team can be too psyched. Then they get tight, and they don't perform the way you want. So we're trying to keep alow-keyed approach for this game." 
On the other hand, Faust must guard against a case ofoverconfidence developing in the Irish camp In view ofl.SU'slosa to Alabama last weekend 
"This game Is our most Important, becau~e It's the: first. We're not looking past It, and we're not counting LSU out. I was lmprciiCd by tbc way they came back In the ~econd half against Alabama -they came out and played excellent football, and probably won the second halfstatlitically." 
Tiger Coach Jerry Stovall wu equally pleased with his kam'a performance alter halftime. "I'm proud ofthe fact that the team continued to play with emotion even though we were so far behind," he relates. "Our big 
problem came defensively -we didn't 
defense the option olf the wishbone well." 
Stovall doesn't feel that facing Notre Dame's fuU house: offense: will present any new challenges &o his squad. "We've played a lot of teams that usc misdirection and dltferent formations." 
The: second year coach fields one ofthe youngest football teams LSU ever has had. Stovall~ent II rookies in against the Tide last Saturday. "We: expect to play just as many freshmen against Notre Dame so we'll have: experience when we get Into conference play." 
While Faust doesn't Intend on starting that many new faces, he's starting a new era in the Irish offense. "Our multiple system Is coming along real well," he says. "It's going to take more than just a few games ora few months to perfect, though. You've got to bring players up through a new system. lt'U take a few seasons to perfect It, but I'm very pleued with the progreu." 
LSU's speed concerns Faust a bit, but the way to counteract It, he says, Itto "play heads­up football and not make mistakes." What bothers the Irish mentor most Is the unknown. 
"I've been with the team nine months, but I really can't evaluate them yet becau~e I've never ~een them go up against college opposition. My players may be world-beaters compared to other schools, but I won't know until I see If they can run and throw and rackJe as well as the LSU playen can." 
That moment can't come soon enough for Gerry Faust and hit lint Notre Dame footbaU squad. "The k.ldl want to ace another jersey belidca their teammate'a acrou that line. They're hchlna to get out and perform."

New look 
. Cheerleaders shift focus 

Recalls Moeller 
Faust pupil awaits reunion 
By ROD BLACKMON 
LSU ReveiUe Sports Editor 
BATON ROUGE, La.-Eric Ellington 
arrived in Baton Rouge a year ago and 
immediately stepped onto a roUercoaster. 
The highly-touted running back out of 
Cincinnati's Moeller High School was billed as 
one ofLSU's game-breakers. But that's not 
how it turned out. Instead, according to the 
scheme ofthe Tigers' veer offense, Ellington 
usually took a straight handoffand found 
himselfat the bottom ofa big pile in the 
middle of the field. 
He never really got a chance to show his 
stud He fumbled a kickoff, which removed 
him from that role. He took a pitchout and 
scampered 1 5 yards, only to take a hit, lose the 
ball and ftnd himselfon the end ofthe bench 
again. 
It was a year offreshman frustration. 
The Tiger staffdecided to stick with the 
veer this year, so it looked for another place 
where Ellington's talents could be 
advantageous. Flanker was suggested, and 
flanker it was. 
Ellington began spring workouts as the No. 4 flanker. Yet last week, when LSU opened against Alabama, the 5-9 sparkplug was in the starting lineup. 
It looked as though the rollercoaster ride was over, that Ellington had settled into a position that he both liked and was impressive in per~orming. Not so. 
Monday in practice, Ellington strained a 
hamstring muscle and was dropped from the 
Tiger depth chart. And this was the week he 
was supposed to play against his former coach 
and close advisor, Gerry Faust. 
CoachJerry Stovall says Ellington will play, 
but it won't be known how effective he will be 
until kickoff. 
The loss ofEllington's darting running and catching could hurt LSU's chances considerably. Against Alabama, Ellington was one ofonly a few players to show any speed and quickness. 
How ironic it would be for Ellington to be influential in an LSU victory. 
"When I was in high school, we (he and Faust) used to talk a lot -we were pretty close," says Ellington. "He always told me if there was anywhere he'd go, he'd go to Notre Dame. I'm not surprised he went." 
Ellington, however, visited the Notre Dame campus like so many other Moeller g(aduates, but he chose to play elsewhere. 
"Notre Dame was so much like Moeller," he says. "The social life wasn't really what I 
wanted it to be. There's more to school than 
just going to class." 
When news of Faust's appointment was announced, rumors flourished about Ellington transfering to play for his old coach. But Ellington stayed put, despite the frustration he sufferred last fall. 
"I never thought oftransfering to Notre Dame," Ellington says. "I didn't want to sit out a year. I made the decision to come here, and I'm happy with the decision. This year I'm a lot more confident. Things just feU into place and I don't know how it happened or why it happened But I'm excited" 
"Last year I was really nervous. I wondered

Alumni, pep rallies, fightsongs -football weekends retum, along with the 1981 Notre Dame cheerleaders. New Head Coach Gerry Faust leads the players on the field as the squad finalizes its routines to rally the students in the stands. 
Co-captain Shelly Obermiller is very excited about this year's squad, as she and Clark Gibson lead 10 others, including seven new members, into the LSU game. The enthusiasm ofthe new people seems to be endless according to Obermiller, who says, "They have so much spirit -and a lot of talent. We'll be trying new things, and this should be a great squad." 
This year's squad will be much different from last year's, just as the football team will show more versatility. Custom-tailored royal blue uniforms provide a new look this year, complimenting the team's jerseys. Also, this year's squad has chosen cheerleaaing as their main goal. 
"They~re working on the direction oftheir cheerleading," says the team's advisor and Director ofStudent ActivitiesJames McDonnell. "They want to stay away from glamorized stunts and routines that focus more on them than on crowd enthusiasm. This group focuses crowd attention and gets them involved, using creative routines that incorporate the crowd into what they're 
doing." 
The cheerleaders have two seasons, in effect, cheeringfor the football and basketball seasons. They cheer at all home football games and will travel to as many away contests as possible. Also, they'll cheer at all home basketball games, and likely some road games. 
The time commitment of the cheerleaders is a great one. They practice six days a week, 
. two hours a session. Obermillersays it's tough on the squad, but they are doing pretty well so far. "Most ofthem are still so excited about the beginning ofthe season that it has not yet become dull for them-and it may never." She adds that the greatest thing about being a cheerleader is the people you meet, and being able to represent the university. "It's been the best experience I've ever had. I feel lucky that I got the chance to cheer here, especially in Coach Faust's first year. The games are wonderful, with the electricity you feel when you walk into the stadium. But I think the pep rallies are the best. For 30 or 40 minutes we have the undivided attention of 3,000 to 4,000 people. The spirit there is unbelievable -typical Notre Dame spirit." 
The squad enters its first regular season game tomorrow. The season will be marked by enthusiasm and desire to excel. Obermiller says this desire will make this cheerleading squad agreat one. "We want to be really great. We want.reople to know we're from Notre Dame. Most importantly, we want the students to be proud of their squad." 
how much playing time I was going to get instead ofwhether we were going to win or lose. But now I'm contributing more. I know what I'm doing, and I know what it takes to make a play work. It's a team effon all the way around, but everyone has to do their part." 
No doubt Faust had alot to do with seeding those values in Ellington, it just took a year for them to grow. He had to reason that playing flanker in the Tigers' offense would best suit his skills. He accepted this, and he succeeded in making the move. 
"I had running back in my blood," Ellington says. "I used to love carryina the ball. I

Michigan ... Southern Cal ... Penn State ... then the bowl game and the Cinderella season offirst-year Irish Head CoachGerry Faust is complete with a national championship. Right? 
Alot ofpeople have visions ofit happening -and it very well may-but ifthe Irish football team overlooks Louisiana State, Faust's debut may turn into a disaster. 
But Faust isn't taking anything for granted. 
"LSU has got an excellent football team. In fact, in the second halfofthe game against Alabama they really came ofage," Faust said. "I was very impressed with Malcom Scott ­their tight end -their two quaterbacks (Alan) Risher and the freshman (Tim) Byrd ­and ofcourse I was impressed with Eric Ellington, who played for us at Moeller High School three years ago. "Their punterJames Wagner averaged 42 yards a punt," Faust continued. "Their defense is very, very good. Led by Ramsey and Dadar and they have an excellent defensive front, probably one ofthe quicker defensive fronts I've seen in the last 
couple ofyears in college football." 
The Tigers w~rc 7-4 last year and list 30 returning lettermen, includingeight offensive and seven defensive starters. However, LSU did lose its opening game on ABC-TV to Paul ''Bear" Bryant and his Alabama Crismon Tide, 24-7, last Saturday. 
But Stovall saw hope in his Tigers. "We felt that offensivley and defensively, there were a lot ofgood things that we did. Offensively, we 
gained almost 400 yards, which we were 
impressed with," Stovall said. "Defensively we 
played well except for the big play. We'll have 
to eliminate that. We'll work very hard on it." 
Faust also believes the 'Barna game helped LSU. 
"LSU gains something simply from having played a game against a top-quality football team. As young as their team i:.., thjit has to be a help," Faust said. "But we gain something because all our coaches and players had a chance to watch that game. We ought to have a little bit better idea what to expect." 
Despite their 30 returning lettermen, the Tigers still may be the youngest team in the college ranks this year. LSU lists only six seniors on its entire roster, and only three ­conerbackJames Britt, spit end Orlando McDaniel and guard Tom Tully -arc slated to begin tomorrow's game. And Stovall boasts just one more year's experience than the Irish mentor. 
The Tigers' freshman crop of28 -11 of whom played against 'Barna -was described by one national expen as the "best group of high school seniors to sign with LSU since the Japs were buildingZeroes instead ofToyotas." 
The Tigers also have a tradition ofbeing tough on the Irish. In 1970, the Irish edged LSU, 3-0, on Scott Hempel's 24-yard field goal with 2:54 remaining. But on the return visit the next year, LSU beat Notre Dame, 28-8. 
Quanerback Alan Risher keys LSU's veer offense after finishing as the top percentage passer in the Southeastern Conference in 1980. Risher completed 82-of-143 passes for 971 yards and nine touchdowns plus six more rushing. 
"We expect Alan to pick up right where he left off," Stovall said. "He's shown us that improvement in practice. Now :we must carry that over into the games." 
Jesse Myles was the leading rusher last year (76 carries for 403 yards in 1980) despite missing five games with a broken leg. He did not play against Alabama, but is expected to start tomorrow. Mike Montz ( 287 yards in 1980) is the fullback. Ellington, the starting flanker in the 'Barna game has been replaced by freshman Markjohnston. 
Besides McDaniel, who is a world-class hurdler, and Tully, guard David Koch is the only incumbant on the offensive line. But Koch and his teammates are big as the Tigers average 6-4, 247.5 pounds across the front.

Key matchup 
Experienced J.B. vs. adjusted Tony 
By SKIP DE&JARDIN 
Assistant Sports Editor 
They are the leaders of their teams. One inherited the job, as one ofa very few seniors. The other kads by exampk, and by means of his enormous talent. They will go head-to­head Saturday when Notre Dame opens its I 981 season against LSU. 
Jim Brit! went from Minden, La., to Baton Rouge with a po(;ket full ofpress clippings. He had been named the defensive player of the year in Louisiana's high schools the year before, and he fully expected the laurels to continue to pile up once he began playing major college football for the Tigers. 
Well, the honors were not forthcoming, at lc:ast until this fall. 
On the other hand, Tony Hunter has continued to get top billing from football writers whenever the subject ofNotre Dame's offense is brought up. He came out of Cincinnati's Moeller High School with prep All-America credentials, and each year has received at least a mention from the men that assembk the mythical "best" line-ups in the college game. 
Britt, a defensive back, and Hunter, a 
wingback, will see a lot ofeach other on the 
floor of Notre Dame: Stadium this weekend. 
J. B., as his friends call him, has started every game but one in the: LSU defensive backfield since his freshman year. He has clearly become one of the premier cornerbacks in the:"'southeastern Conference, ifnot the nation. 
"I know my teammates will be expecting more leadership from me: this year," he says. "But that's somethingI'm willing to do. In fact, I'm looking forward to it." 
LSU Is a young team, and Brit! is the only senior starter In the de:-fensive unit. He could not avoid the leaderhip role if he wanted to. But he ha.~ eagerly accepted the job as "big brother" to his defensive teammates. 
llunter's record in just two years has been nothing short ofamazing. In his freshman year, he set a Notre Dame record by averaging 2'>.6 yards per reception. His career record of 
19.9 yards per catch ranks second among active: college players. 
This season, Hunter's high school c9ach, Gerry Faust, has instituted a new offense. The multiple formation approach is a concerted effort to get the ball into the: hands ofTony Hunter as often as possible. 
"He's our best athlete," Faust says. "He has to be: to do all the things we are asking ofhim. tlc:'ll split wide, or set up in a full house backfield. He'll go deep for a pass, or take a hand·off. Tony can do it all, as well as block." 
Britt has allowed the lSU defense to 
become more Oexible, in much the same way 
that Hunter has allowed Notre Dame to vary 
its offense. 
"I knowJames will not make a mistake," says lSU defensive back coach Greg Williams. "He: allows me to make defensive adjustments that we've: never been able to make before."

thought, 'Wow, I came: here to be a running back and now I'm going to play flanker.' I know how a lot oftimes you get in college and they'll change: you to a position and just leave you there and not care about you. I had that in mind. But then, I thought that ifl worked at it, maybe: I'd have: a chance to play more." 
Ellington proved himself and satisfied the coaching staff a.~ well. He certainly will cause problems with flanker reverses and open·field running. 
Stovall, like Faust, has been a big influence in giving him the confidence to make such a switch. And Ellington says the two coaches have a lot in common. 
"Thcy'rt· about the same," he says. "I think Coach Stovall has a more logkal approach to the game. Coach Faust is just wild-eyed and bushy· tailed, running around and hollering. But they remind me ofeach other. I think highly of them both."

lt"s mn· to bt· important a~o:ain. 
A Business Administration student with a 
3.5 grade point average, Britt says it takes a quick mind to play the way he does. 
"You've got to be able to think and be alert when playingcornerback," he says. "You have to be able to anticipate just enough and know when to anticipate. A lot oftimes, in one-on­one situations, if you're able to out-think your man, you've got him whipped." 
For his part, Hunter knows that he: will have to be sharp. He is, after all, learning a new position. 
"It's tough to learn a new position," he admits, "but I really like it. I'll still be the primary receiver, plus I'll be in motion a lot. I'll have the opportunity to run the ball too. I enjoy the increased responsibility." 
Saturday, the situation is bound to arise. On a "third and long" play, Hunter will race downfield. Britt will pick up the coverage, most likely with help from another back. Kiel or Koegel will throw the ball.... 
Time and again, the two leaders will match wits and physical ability. Whoever is better at doing his job will go along way toward leading 
his team to victory. 

There has not been much time for joking around this week as co-captain Phil Carter, Coach Gerry Faust and the rest ofthe team, have been seriously prepan·ng for LSU.

1979 meeting with the Irish, "This is more important than any bowl game, conference game, oranything that Clemson has played in. For once: I won't have to worry about motivation for a football game. I know our players will perform above their capabilities." 
Although Notre Dame has always raised the blood pressure ofsoutherners, this hatred has intensified in recent years, especially in the Dan Davine era. For some reason Moose Krause scheduled more and more games with Southern schools for the late-'70s, just about the time Devine took over for Ara Parseghian. 
Krause should have learned his lesson because ugly scenes in wars with the South began in 1969, at the Georgia Tech-Notre Dame game In Atlanta. In a nationally televised game, the Irish vaulted to a 38·6lead late in the fourth quarter. The psyched, and by now inebriated YellowJacket fans were letting their "buzz" get the best ofthem. They began pelting the Notre Dame players with ice and cups ofwater. 
Three years later the Irish traveled to Baton Rouge for the frrst time, and the treatment accorded Notre Dame's black players was less than courteous. Racial barbs from the stands and people in town was one thing, but it was reported that the hotel administration at Notre Dame's headquarters allowed phone calls through to black players' rooms at 3 a.m., prohibiting a sound night's sleep. 
The legat·y of Dan Devine and his journey through the South is a long one. While Parseghian played relatively few contests with southern teams during his reign ( 1964-74) Devine had 23 games with teams from the South in just six seasons in South Bend. The now retired mt-ntor had a t1nc 17·5·1 lcdgt:r in tht·sc gamt·s. but eight of the wins were by a touchdown or less. Thus, the nature: ofthe contests increased the pressure and anxiety among fans. 
Devine's frrst journey south took place in 1975 when he took his team to Dean Smith (no, he's not a football coach too) country to face North Carolina. A miracle rally kd by then youthful sophomore:Joe Montana (an 80-yard TD pass to Ted Burgmeier with 1:03 left) gave ND a 21-14 victory. The next season only ajimmy Browner interception saved a 
13-6 win at South Carolina. And ofcourse 
there was the trip to Clemson in 1976. A 
bomb scare in Devine's hotel room the night 
before the game, and a block thrown by an 
official on Clemson's first touchdown that 
would have made any offensive line coach 
proud, were just two ofthe abnormal 
occurrences of that weekend. 
The less than hospitable treatment at Georgia Tech was resurrected in 1976 when the YellowJackets upset Notre Dame 23-14 and the Georgia Tech players and fans were kss than gracious in doing so. The Irish did not forget the treament the next season in South Bend and ran up the score in a 69-14 extinction of Pepper Rogers' team. 
That ill feeling with the YdlowJackets festered over the summer and in Notre Dame's victory in 1978 in Atlanta, what might be the ugliest scene in Notre Dame football history occurred. I was at the game and could not believe my eyes as Vagas Ferguson wa.o; pelted with icc and fish (for the "mackerel snappers" as Notre Dame players arc called in Atlanta) afer scoringa late TD in a 38-21 Notre Damewin. · 
The heaving offins continued and soon, the Notre Damt· players had to abandon their own sideline. Devine was a primary target as he was about as popular in Atlanta as Hcrsc:hd Walker is in South Bend. The players

game against 'Barna, at strong safety. 
"I expect LSU to come in here with that same: kind ofintensity (as they did in Notre Dame's 3-0 victory i" the Stadium in 1970)," Faust said. "Playing Notre Dame means too much to them to have any kind ofletdown, even after an emotional conference game like Alabama. Plus, it'll be a good test for our young men because they know they'll have to be: ready to play." 
Should the game turn into a kicking contest the Tigers will rely on the foot ofJames Wagner. Liffort Hobley is the only Tiger casualty from the 'Barna game sustaining a shoulder injury finishing him for the year.

surrounded Devine as police slowly (they 
appeared to be enjoying the fray) ended the 
problem. It appeared the game would end 
right there with a couple of minutes left, but 
finally Pepper Rogers went over to hisstudent 
section to calm the wolves. He finally realized his football program was being embarrassed on Notre Dame's national replay network. 
In 1979 Devine had to face four teams from the: South. He split the four contests, but one, a 40-I 8 loss at Tennessee, was the worst defeat ofhis career. Later that season Clemson downed the Irish at Notre Dame, 16-10. Clemson didn't win the Civil War that day, but in the eyesofTiger fans some juslice had been won. 
That same year, only 42 seconds remained on the ND Stadium clock when a 14-yard Rusty Lisch-to-Dean Masztak touchdown pass and Pete Holohan's two-point conversion reception beat South Carolina, 18-1 7. 
Tight contests continued last year as the Irish upset Alabama in their own backyard, but sufferred a bizarre: losing tie to Georgia Tech, and the loss for the National Championship to Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. 
Saturday, Gerry Faust, perhaps naive: to the determination dominating the minds of the LSU team at this moment, will charge his army out ofthe tunnel for the first time. He better have all his artillery ready because Notre Dame Stadium, players, religion and lore will motivate the Tigers to new heights. 
It sounds unimaginable that a team could look past a conferencc:-rival and national power (Alabama) for a contest with an independent many miles away from home. Although they won't admit it to the press, LSU's players have been looking forward to this gamc:-more than any other in their carc:-ers since they signed their nationallt-ttcrs·Of· intent. ·.:

"The reason to keep some assistants from the last coach is just for the sake ofcontinuity. There are a lot of things a new coach has to learn about the school or the organization. Besides, why not keep a man on the staffif he is a good coa~h? 
Brown is a fan of Faust, and he is eager to talk about the new Irish coach. 
"I've known him for quite some time," Brown says. "He is an unusual person, and asuperb coach. All he has to do is be himself, a1,1d he'll be successful. His en­thusiasm and bubbly pe-rsonality make him a swell per­son to be associated with. He's just a great guy." 
Faust opens his first season this weekend in a game against LSU. Brown says he's sent a letter wishing the best ofluck, and certainly better luck than Brown him­selfhad for his first college game. 
"I'll never forget that game," he says with a chuckle. "We were playing at home against Missouri, and the coach of the Tigers was Don Faurot, the man I had beaten out for the Ohio State job. 
"The day started out on a bad note. As the team arrived for the game and was getting off the bus, I spotted some old friends from Massillon. So, I sent the boys inside, and stopped to talk As I headed in the stadium, a guard grabbed me and asked for my ticket. 
"'I don't have a-ticket, I'm Paul Brown,' I said. 
"'Yeah, and I'm President Roosevelt, and you still

"We had seen Missouri's spring game," he recalls, "and there was nothing exceptional about it. But wouldn't you know it, Faurot picked ourgame to invent the split T formation. 
"Now, the split T eventually revolutionized college football. It led to the wishbone and the veer offenses. But I didn't knowwhat it was. Faurot was really trying to get back at me for getting the job he wanted 
"Missouri drove up and down the field all day, but 
they couldn't seem to get inside our twenty yard line. 
We ended up winning, 12-7, which shows you how bad 
place-kickers were then." 
After the game friends chided Brown for being 
unable to beat Missouri by a bigger margin. The Tigers 
were not supposed to have much of a team. little did 
they know that the split T would win every other game 
for Missouri, and they would end up in the Sugar Bowl. 
Brown and the Buckeyes lost just one game that 
season, and the next year were the undefeated National 
Champions. Could Gerry Faust be as successful? 
"Anything is possible," Brown says. "Gerry is a superb 
coach, and he has terrifi~ material to work with. He's 
going to do very well. 
"You see, at places like Notre Dame, (and Ohio State 
was the same when I was there) people want a winner. 
When you have that, there is no pressure. The real 
pressure for a coach comes when he is fighting with the 
administration or with the team owner. Otherwise, 
when the people want a winner, and your doing your 
best to give them one, it's just a lot offun."

Borg nips Tanner, while Connors dumps 1'eltscher 
NEW YORK(AP) · Sweden's Bjorn Borg won his annual quarterfinal duel with Roscoe fanner 7-6, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6 Thurs­day and moved mto the semi­finals of the U.S. Open tennis championships. 
Borg, who has yet to win America'a premier tennis event 
in 10 years of trying, finally captured his quarterfinal battle after Tanner had fought off three match points. He now will meet fourth-seeded Jimmy Connors, who easilv beat' No.8 Eliot Tdtscher, 6-3, 6-1, 6-2, late last night. 
Top-seeded John McEnroe's 
semifinal  foe  will  be  No.  15  
Vitus  Gerulaitis,  who  got  by  
unseeded Bruce Manson. ..  
The women's semifinals,  

scheduled for Friday, will pet No.1 Chris Evert LLoyd against No.4 Martina Navratilova, and No.3 Tracy austin against No. 11 Barbara Potter. 
''This was my best match so far in the tournament,'' said Bor~. sho is seeded second 
here. "I was serving much 
better ... (and ) I felt confidence 
in my passing shots.'' 
Tanner had difficulty holding his serve in the opening set, while the ninth-seeded right hander never won any game against Borg's serve. With the exception of the match-opening game, Borg took Tanner to deuce every time the left-hand­er seerved. 
But Tanner he!, and they went to a tiebreaker, the frrst of three they were to play in their two-hour, 49 minute battle. Borg quickly won the first four points before winning 7-4 and taking the opening set. 
Borg broke Tanner in the second game of the next set, then rode his own serve to grab a 2-0 victory. It appeared then that Borg would easily capture his third U.S. Open quarterfinal meeting with Tanner. They had split the frrst two, Tanner winning in 1979 and Borg last )lear. 
Bjorn Borg, who has never won a U.S. Open Tennis Championship, moved one step closer to his first title yesterday as he defeated Roscoe Tanner. Bjorg now faces his o{d nemesis, jimmy Connors, in the semifinals. [AP Laserphoto] 
A Cub pennant?!? 
Could this be the year? 
CHICAGO (AP) . Playing .500 ball in the second half of baseball's split season isn't exactly burnmg up the leasue nor is a 6-8 road trip anythmg to really crow about, but the Chicago Cubs are causing a stir in the National 'League East. 
They've done it with a totally unexpected three-game sweep at St. 'louis, where the Card­inals were threatening to make a runaway of their division in Season II. 
That was before Jerry Reuss and Fernando Valenzuela of the Los Angelos Dodgers slowed down the Cardinals. Then along came the Cubs, who hadn't won a single game on artificial turf this season. 
"Give the Cubs credit," said Cardinal Manager Whitey Rer­zos. "They've got a reprieve when the season was split into two halves and they took advantage of it." 
As for his own club, which remains in first/lace a game and a half ahea of the cubs, Montreal and the New York Mets, Herzos said, "All I can do is pray and hope they break out of tt. Valenzuela and Reuss give us trouble every time we play the Dodgers, but we dido' t exactly break down the-fences when we played the Cubs earlier." 
One reason is that Cub pitch­ing of late has been effective while-Bill Buckner and a sud­denly hot Bobby Bonds have been carrying in the hitting load. 
"We're back in the hunt," said Manager Joey Amalfitano. "We've got some dependable starting pitchers, ana i can leave Randy' Martz in the bullJ?en for the time being. Havmg Randy available for long relief or spot starts is a big plus." 
Two of the starters are Doug Bird and Mikegriffin, who were obtained from the New York Yankees in a trade for Rick Reuschel hours before the strike began last June. 
Mike Krukow and Ken Kra­vec, who did a turnabout after the strike, are the other two starters. In the bullpen with Martz, who has also been used as a starter, are Dick Tidrow and Dave Geisel, who turned in a fine relief performance in St. Louis. 
Bonds, who was benched a week ago because of lack of hitting, caught fire in St. Louis. 
He slugged two home runs in Monday's 10-0 romp and hit ~more Wednesday to com­

plete the sweep. 
Buckner, the National Lea-. gue's defending batting cham­pion, is on a hitting binge. He has hit safely in 25 of 26 games and the last nine in a row during which he has collected 18 hits in 39 at bats to hike his 
average to .313.  
"In order to win you have to believe you can win,'' said Buckner who learned some­thing about winning back in the days he was with the Dodgers. "Everybody's doing the job and we're playing better.'' 
Amalfitano noted that "Buck­ner is not a holler-type guy but on the bench he's more active than he's been in the past. Maybe he senses something is happening here." 
Amalfitano gave the Cubs the' day off Thursday following the tinng road trip. They open a three-game series at home against Montreal today.

O'Sullivan seeks tourney bid

Sports Writer 
Even though it lost three ofits top players by graduation last year, Coach Noel O'Sullivan's Notre Dame golfsquad anticipates another bountiful year when the season 
starts next spring.

this month the linksmen will travel to Lebanon, Ind.,. for the Indiana In­tercollegiate Golf Championships,

Still paralyzed 
IU's Turner improving rapidly 
BJ JIMMIE ANGELOPOLOUS The Indianapolis News 
Indianat>olis (AP) ,. Landon Turner's Ciouble room on the third floor of the Children's Pavilion at Methodist Hospital is a little different from other rooms. 
Two huge basketball posters --one of Darrell Griffith and one of Darryl Dawkins --adorn one wall. In between, a paper skeleton dangles. 
"This skeleton was signed by Landon's anatomy class­mates,'' explains Turner's mother, Rita. 
Turner, a junior on Indiana University's 1981 NCAA bas­ketball championship team, is 
?;~j~~:'fnr:~e~~~!~l~eai~a~ 
July 25 automobile accident. 
On the room's back wall are photos and get-well cards, in­cluding a huge card sent by Bobby Knight, IU basketball coach. 
A classroom of grade­schoolers from Weyerhauser, Wis., sent hand-scrawled letters ti their television basket­ball hero. A note from a Carmel, Ind., seventh-grader especially touched Turner's mother. It reads, "I.U. needs you and little boys like me need 
you.··· "This is such a nice letter," Mrs. Turner said. One inoth_er sent a photograph ofher small son, named Landon because "she had seen Landon play basketball when she was pregnant," Mrs. Turner said. Near Turner's bed rests a bright floral boupuet, nestled in black and gold, sent by Purdue University and its basketball players. "Best of health and luck,'' reads the message from Indiana's arch-rivals. Turner smiles only faintly at his parent's conversation and all the cheer in his hospital room. But not because he isn't men­tally alert. He sits upright in a whelchair. A wrap-around neck and chin collar keeps his head rigid. A supporting strip down the front anchors a waist brace. ''Landon has improved aston­ishingly since h1s severe car accident," his father, Adell, 47, said. ''Maybe 1,000 percent.'' Turner was driving toward an Ohio amusement park with his girl friend, Suzanne]ones, and two other friends, David Collins and Elesha Storey, when he was injured. Investigators said his car caught the berm around a dangerous cirve on Ind. 46 near Columbus, Ind. ''Landon was headed for a 
· truck, but he swerved the car back,'' his mother said. ''The road had a drop of six or seven inches. His car flipped over on its top. David and Elesha managed to get out and David saved my son's life and Suzanne's. The front seat had caught fire." __ The accident broke the sixth 
cervical vertebra at the base of 
Turner's spinal cord, doctors 
said. Paralysis set in and for 
sever~l  days, Turner  was  un­ 
consctous.  
''Thank  God  there  was  no  

brain damage. He's very normal there," Mrs. Turner said. ­
Turner has begun therapy. But doctors say his hands and legs still are paralyzed, and they won't speculate on his chances for complete recovery. "He just started to sit in a wheelchair," Mrs. Turner said. 
"He had a sore tailbone. They had taken a piece of bone from his hip to make the fusion. Today's the first time he's had therapy.'' 
Mrs. Turner reported her son had lost 57 pounds, but predict­ed, "He'll get better. Hts spirit is good." 
Turner agrees. ' 'I'm feeling better," he said. 
  .Purdue 
continued from p .17 
Purdue has an experienced secondary with the return of safeties Tim Seneff and Marcus McKinnie and corner­back Robe.rt Williams, but Youn~ said it will take more than JUSt those players to stop Elway. 
''I think containing him cer­tainly is a concern, but I really feel tt' s difficult to isolate any phase of the defense,'' Young said. ''All phases have to come through to stop Stan­ford's passing game. We have to have a total team effort defensively.'' stanford Coach Paul Wiggin makes no bones that it's the offense that will carry the bulk of the responsibility for the Cardinals' success. 
"We are what everyone knows us to be," Wiggin said. "We have a great quarterback in Elway and running back in 'Nelson. The biggest mystery for us is defens' ' 
"We didn't change personnel dramatically,'' Wiggm said of a defense that gave up 404 yards a game last year. "But we feel we are a little better.
