Chances are slim for FM 'Voice of Fighting Irish' station next year 
ByJOE INCARDONA 
StaffReporter 
The chances that student-run WSND-AM will make a switch to the FM radio dial next year are "slim," according to a consultant hired by the University to look into the pos­sibility ofsuch a move. 
Paul Matwiy, consultant to the Office of Student Activities on the project, said the application for the necessary license from the Federal Communications Commission is being withheld until those involved can decide if there is a good chance the FCC will approve it. 
"We don't want to promise the students a new FM radio station un­less we have a good shot at it," said Matwiy. He pointed out the Univer­sity already owns one non­commercial license which allows WSND-FM, the student-run classical music station, to broadcast over the airwaves in South Bend. 
The executive board of WSND­AM started its bid for the switch to FM last fall, when its members began preparing the FCC license applica­tion in cooperation with student ac­tivities. The board's members (all students) decided the new FM sta­tion would operate in place of WSND-AM, and proposed the station be renamed WVFI (Voice of the Fighting Irish). Matwiy was then 
hired to advise the board on the FCC application process.

:Peace Corps Director Loret Ruppe to speak at ND comtnencement 
ByDAN McCULLOUGH 
News Editor 
Loret Miller Ruppe, director of· the Peace Corps, will be Notre Dame's commencement speaker for 1984, The Observer learned yester­day. 
Although Assistant Director of In­formation Services Michael Garvey said, "I can neither confrrm nor deny anything until we have lined up all of the honorary degree recipients." The Observer was told by Ruppe's secretary she will be the commence­ment speaker and will be on campus May 20. 
President Reagan appointed Ruppe head of the Peace Corps on Feb. 14, 1981. Prior to that she was co-chairwoman of the Reagan-Bush Committee in Michigan during the 1980 election. Ruppe is also the wife of former congressman Philip Ruppe. 
An official White House press 
release said Ruppe "has spent most 
of her life in volunteer efforts," 
including the International Neigh­
bors Club IV, and "has traveled ex­
tensively and shared ideals with past 
Peace Corps volunteers in many 
countries." Before taking over the 
Corps, Ruppe had no previous 
professional experience. 
The Peace Corps, initiated by the late President John Kennedy, has changed from its original image. When initially established by Ken­nedy, the Corps was staffed mostly by young people affiliated with Ken­nedy's Democratic administration. In recent years, however, most Corps leaders have been loyal Republicans. 
Recently, Ruppe has been accused of liberalizing the Peace Corps policy on offering abortions to volunteers. According to a)an. 13, 1984, Washington Times article, Ruppe was responsible for a "more permissive policy that allows volun­teers to remain in the Peace Corps until after a second abortion," rather than being dismissed after one abor­tion. 
The article further states Ruppe decided to continue the practice of using federal money to fund abor­tion counseling, transportation and per diem expenses of pregnant volunteers. The article continues on to say about 200 volunteers have used the funds for abortions during the past three years. Ruppe has been criticized for this policy because it is not consistent with the current ad­ministration's. 
Thomas Paulken, director of the 
Peace <brps' parent organization, 
ACTION, said the policies "were to­
tally inconsistent with the presi­
dent's philosophy and approach on 
this issue ... It was the policy ofthis 
administration and this agency and 
all of its components that in no way 
would we use federal funds or 
federal encouragement to aid or 
abet abortions." 
A Jan. 7, 1984 article, in The 
Washington Post, said Ruppe 
secretly tape-recorded a conversa­
tion with her deputy, Edward Cur­
ran, about difficulties in their 
working relationship. The article 
also said the incident was reviewed 
by White House counsel Fred Field­
ing and he reportedly found the 
taping violated agency regulations 
but was not illegal and should be 
handled as a personnel dispute. 
Askew, Glenn, Hollings in Mock Convention 
By TERRY BLAND 
News Staff 
Editor's note: This is the last offour ar­ticles outlining the platforms and ob­jectives of the candidates who will be represented in the Mock Convention which opens tomorrow. 
Ernest Hollings 
As governor of South Carolina, Ernest Hol­lings was able to balance the state's budget for the first time since Reconstruction. 
As president, Hollings says he would call for an across-the-board freeze on the federal budget, and repeal the I 0 percent tax cut coming in July to help reduce the federal deficit. 
"Ernest Hollings sees the deficit as the big­gest crisis of today," says Joe Malvezzi, cam­paign manager for Hollings in the Mock Convention. "He believes that the economic growth of today is just a knee jerk reaction to falling energy prices." 
Hollings says government should act as a leader in industrial policy. By assisting in research and finance, Hollings thinks govern­

. ment can act as a catalyst in ~ringing business, labor and agriculture into a partnership. 
Besides a deficit freeze, Hollings sees the economic recovery policy as having a founda­tion in an improved education system. "Hollings believes in improving the public school system," says Malvezzi. "If you im­prove the school system in every city, you can also improve the state school system and the national school system. By educating people,

!you can decrease unemployment.'' 
Hollings believes democracy in Central America can be sustained through economic and military aid to the region. In order to assist in establishing democracy, aid from outside forces like Cuba and Russia must be stopped. 
Foreign policy is another issue Hollings sees as important. Hollings said about American marines in Lebanon, "if they're there to fight, there are too few. If they're there to die, there are too many." He does, however, believe the U.S. should support the president in any foreign policy decisions. 
Hollings supports the Kennedy-Hatfield freeze on nuclear weapons. But he does not support nuclear build down because he believes it raises the chance ofwar, especially in Western Europe. 
"The reason Hollings dropped out is be­cause he did poorly in New Hampshire," says Malvezzi. "I believe Hart became a national candidate because of the coverage he received from the media. Hollings didn't receive that kind ofcoverage." 
Malvezzi is running the Hollings campaign on campus by himself because he doesn't want people to get involved politically with someone they don't know. "I just want people to take a look at Hollings and get to know what he stands for," says Malvezzi. "Hollings has good ideas where the Mondale and Hart cam­paigns are based on empty promises." 
Reubin Askew 
Dave MeA voy, campaign manager for Reubin Askew, believes Askew's campaign is more organized than anyone else's on campus. "At the beginningofthe campaign we came in last in a random poll throughout campus," says McAvoy. "Recently, we've been targeting the campus with banners and plat­forms and have climbed to fourth in a recent preference poll." 
Askew is a conservative democrat who believes the U.S. should support El Salvador. "Askew believes we should give economic aid only to those regimes which do not violate the human rights of people," says McAvoy. "He does see Central America as vital to our inter­ests." 
Defense spending is another issue Askew

:?:-::-:/·.-:--:.-.-·.-·e;"" \\0~.-:--: 
~o-(\'Jet\.............................. 
c;;;::9..~::-:::::::::·:::::::::::::::;:;_:;;i:fii:): 

and favors an annual increase of about 5 per­cent in the defense budget. Askew would spend more on defense only if it would achieve specific objectives as part ofa nation­al defense strategy. 
Askew opposes a unilateral nuclear arms freeze, but he believes the U.S. should resume arms control talks with the Russians. As a reac­tion to the reduction of nuclear weapons, As­kew favors a build-up of conventional forces in NATO. Another defense cut Askew proposes is the elimination ofthe B-I bomber and the MX missle. 
Askew recognizes a strong need to reduce 
the federal deficit. He would apply restraints on spending to assist in reducing the deficit. By repealing the I 0 percent across-the-board tax cut, Askew says the federal deficit could be reduced by $30 billion in fiscal 1984, and by $I 77 billion over the next five years. 

As a pro-life supporter, Askew is the only democratic candidate to come out against abortion. He supports the idea of a constitu­tional human life amendment. 
MeAvoy says Askew has a good chance of winning in the Mock Convention. "In order to win, we have to create a momentum," says M:Avoy. "We want the delegates to know how Askew stands on the issues." There are currently I 0 students working on the Askew campaign, five of whom are student govern­ment officers. 
In an effort to familiarize students with the Askew campaign, MeA voy plans to hold a hap­py hour in which platforms and buttons will be distributed. MeAvoy will also begin a phone drive in which the election committee will contact each delegate by phone. 
"I believe Askew's rise in popularity is due to the hard work the committee has put in on the campaign," says McAvoy. "Askew is an appealing candidate and ifwe can get the stu­dents familiar with his ideas, we have a good chance." 
John Glenn 

John Glenn, another conservative democratic presidential candidate in the Mock Convention, is a strong supporter ofjob legislation as way offighting unemployment. 
Ifelected, Glenn plans to provide S225 mil-

Aperson claimingto represent Notre Dame won the "Wet Willie" contest this year at the Button in Fort Lauderdale during spring break. A student who asserts he is that person says he danced in the contest with an empty beer case over his head to remain anonymous. Last year a Notre Dame student won the "Wet Willie" contest and was nearly expelled. Dean of Students James Rocma issued a directive before spring break instructing students to stay away from such contests. -The Observer 
The "Shamrocks Against Dystrophy" 
campaign, hdd the week before Spring Break, raised close to $1200 for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Most of the money raised came in the form of pennies and small change, according to cam­paign chairman GeorgeJordan. The money raised will be used by the South Bend MDA office to provide services to local patients. -The Obsert'er 
New permanent I.D. cards will be used begin­
ning during the fall 1984-85 semester. During advance registration, Monday, April 16 through Wednesday, April 18, all continuing stu­dents will have their photos taken for the new I.D. card. The cards will be distributed during fall enrollment. The permanent I.D. card will not have a void date or the student's birthdate printed on it. Beginning with the fall 1985/86 semester students who have en­rolled will also have their permanent I.D. card embossed with a date ( t.g., 84ND85). This will validate the J.D. card for the entire acadt:mic year. -The Observer 
A $2,000 Hibernian Research Award has

Fanning is at work on a study of the Irish literary voice in American literature; Brundage is doing research in the history ofIrish-American working p~·ople in Colorado during the 1890's. -The Observer 
The Supreme Court, while adhering to its 22-year ban on officially sponsored school prayers, said yesterday it will con­sider letting public schools provide a daily "moment of silence" for students.

A few solved problems 

They're called "parking lot issues" -the little things 
student government workers do to make life for the rest 
of us a little better. 

More this, and more that. A meeting here, a store there. Oft-repeated on the trail to the presidency (or the senate or hall government), these wanton promises rarely materialize, and the campaign posters are long gone come August or September. In addition, very few candidates are ever put to the test ofre-election. 
But bureaucratic miracles do happen, and outgoing Student Senator Dave McAvoy and Student Union Movie Commissioner MaryJane Costello have followed up on particular problems about the campus with a laudable amount offervor. 
You know this scenario. He's been on the phone for twenty minutes. Twisting and untwisting the cord, he's shifted from his left to his right foot 42 times. To his right, she's been staring into the grey marble for up­wards of fifteen minutes, blankly gazing around the graffiti-covered sign which 
there was sufficient demand, McAvoy says he went to 
see Fred Baumer, comptroller ofthe University, to see if 
another telephone could be installed. 
"Baumer wouldn't pay for it, but he said if Student Government paid for it, OK, and ifyou get the library's approval," says McAvoy, who adds it took him until January to get all the necessary yeses. From there, McAvoy called Indiana Bell to get price quotes on the rental and the installation. 
"I took all these facts to Brian (Callaghan, student body president) who got Student Government to pay for it. After that it was a good two months before any­thing happened," he says. 
Finally in February, the long-awaited phone appeared on the wall, at an initial cost of S80 and a monthly -charge of S 1 7. The process took almost four months to complete, but MeAvoy seems to believe the bureaucratic toil was worth it. 
Says McAvoy, those smaller projects "take a lot of

time because you've got to go and hit every base, talk to every person," but he adds, "The turning point came when we decided we were going to pay for it." 
Over in Cushing Hall, "James Bond Week" begins tonight, the latest in a series ofgreat movies brought to Notre Dame with the help ofSU's movie commissioner. Under Costello's direction, such blockbuster's as 48 
Hours, Gandhi, Trading Places, Risky Business and 
War Games have been shown on the screen in the Engineering Auditorium. Costello chose all of the 
reads "Please limit calls to five minutes." The line begins at the large Rubber­maid trash can and begins to extend up the stairs. 
This is the entrance to the Pit in the Memorial Library, where a little while ago, only two campus phones served the hundreds of students who use the facility daily. Now that number has been bumped up to three, and word from student govern­ment is that a fourth may be added. 
McAvoy began the drive to get that phone last December. After getting Ombudsman to determine if

exact date as well.  he says  
last year "clubs co  ld pick  
any movie they wa  nted. It  

didn't allow me to ~ake any package deals with any film company." 
The quality of campus films "had been deteriorat­ing," she says, and clubs who received bad lottery picks often had to show un­popular movies. The profits from the showings now arc pooled and distributed to campus clubs. 
Costello says she has 
received complaints from some students about the weekend price hike to $1.SO, but rising rental fees jus­tify the increase, she says. From the viewer's side, it seems the biggest problem has been keeping change supplied to the ticket-takers, and problems with film projection have also been greater this year. 
Nonetheless, the better movie offerings have made the problems seem minor, and it's hard to argue a recent rekase isn't worth another SO cents.

The off-campus student commis­sioner will no longer be a member of the student senate as a result of a resolution passed unanimously at last night's student senate meeting. 
The current off-campus commis­sioner, Doug Honeywell, was not present at the meeting. "I have no comment," he said later in a phone interview. 
Student Body Vice President Cathy David recommended the commissioner be made a member of the Hall President's Council, saying "there are currently two off-campus representatives on the student senate, and no off-campus representatives on the Hall Presi­dent's Council." She reasoned the off-campus commissioners have no means of recetvmg _pertinent in­formation discussed at the HPC meetings. 
"The hall presidents seemed favorable to the idea," David added, responding to arguments the senate could not mandate policy for the HPC.

Senate abolishes one OC commission seat 
from $30 to S40. The issue will be discussed in future meetings. 
A debate regarding the candidacy of Harold Augustine for Senior Fel­low was opened. Debate ended when some student senate members objected to the discussion. Ex­ecutive Coordinator Ray Wise said "I don't think that it's for us to decide." David echoed this philosophy, saying "This is a deci­sion for seniors .. .it's not really any ofour business." 
Bertino announced a new policy regarding the recording of senate votes and other information. He said votes, attendance, and sub­committee participation will be tab­ulated henceforth, and "will be made public in the future." 
Office hours have been set up so that anyone can discuss student government-related issues with the student body president and vice president. Bertino will be available on the second floor of La Fortune from 10-11 p.m. on Sunday and Mon­day, and David from 11-12 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday. 
In other business, Bertino noted the cabinet application deadline has been extended to Friday. He stated a new constitution will be voted on at the next senate meeting. 

both attending a session of the Provost Advisory Committee. Neit­her the Provost's office nor the Uni­versity Information Services office were able to provide information regarding the impending policy. 
Student Body President Rob Ber­tino is playing the waiting game along with the students he represents. He has "no idea" what the policy will be. It will be released by the week of April 9 he assumes, but he is unsure whether it will be a general release or a release to the rectors followed by a general release. 
When asked about the upcoming April 6 deadline for release from on­campus housing without penalty, Bertino speculated there would on­ly be a small tie between the new policy and on-campus housing withdrawals. He said most students who are going to move off-campus have anticipated some sort of change and already are in the process of making arrangements for an off-campus move. 
Brian Callahan, former SBP and one of two students on the alcohol committee, commented on the relationship between the housing withdrawal deadline and the im­minent alcohol policy. He believes the housing withdrawal deadline will not be a problem. "Anyone who 
moved  off-campus due  to  the al­ 
cohol  policy  would  not  be  
penalized," he said.  

Although it is unclear exactly when the policy will be released, Callahan shed some light on the delay, "I think they (the llniversity offict'i'S')'fotwarded it tb the Univer­sity trustees and they are waiting for a response. It should be out later this week or very early next week." 
Although unable to discuss details of the new policy until it is announced, he spoke of his willing­ness to discuss the details of the policy when it was made public. He said, "I don't feel it is the best com­promise available. I still feel there were better alternatives and I spoke up about that at every meeting" 
Fr. Mark Poorman, Dillon Hall rec­tor and committee member, agreed with Callahan that the policy is now being discussed by the University trustees. He said the committee finished the document before spring break and submitted it to the lhiver­sity officers (the President, Provost and other administrators.) After the officers reviewed the document, it was sent to the University trustees, where it remains. Although, like Cal­lahan, he could not comment on the details of the committee's recom­mendation, he did say it was ex­tremely well-worded. 
He indicated it is fruitless to discuss the policy further until the details of the document are known. He said, "the next point of fruitful discussion will occur when ·the policy does come out." 

Architecture students move Beaux Arts Ball to South Dining Hall 
ByJENNIFER BIGOTT 
StaffReporter 
Changes have been made in this semester's Beaux Arts .Ball, accord­ing to Dan Rectenwald, vice presi­dent of the student chapter of the American Institute of Architects. The AlA sponsors the dance each semester. 
The Beaux Arts Ball was cancelled last fall due to the combination of crowded conditions in the Ar­chitecture Building and alleged in­stances of alcohol abuse. According to Rectenwald, crowding was a problem at the last Ball because tick­ets were sold before the Ball and at the door. When a surprisingly large number of people turned out, the building could not house all those who had purchased tickets. Addi­tional complications arose from the presence of alcohol, which was prohibited. 
Consequently, almost two weeks after the event, Dean of Students james Roemer said there would be no more Beaux Arts Balls in the future. "It's a University buildingand what you do inside ofa school build­ing is very controlled, and I guess 
...there's a question as to whether 
we were complying with those tenaed the last Beaux Arts Ball. rules," said Rectenwald. Proceeds from the event are all-

ting a new FM station on campus were much better last fall when the group first looked into applying for an FM license. He said the odds have diminished since then because an­other group in the South Bend area decided to apply to the FCC for the only frequency available for a new non-commercial FM station. 
"Given the fact that there are al­
ready five non-commercial FM sta­
tions in South Bend, I don't think the 
FCC would grant two public 
licenses to anyone," said Matwiy. He 
said he believes the situation is fur­
ther complicated by the fact the Uni­versity also owns several commercial radio stations in South Bend. Matwiy stressed, however, the final decision about submitting the FCC application rests with WVFI's executive board. 
Matwiy also emphasized he and the members of the station's ex­ecutive board are "exploring lots of different avenues" in their attempt to determine the future of the new station. One of the options being considered is a complete rebuilding of the carrier current system which transmits WSND-AM's signal. This would allow the new station to broadcast in stereo on the AM dial. WVFI will also relocate its facilities to the LaFortune Student Center, moving into a new studio described by Matwiy as "one of the top two in the South Bend area."

Social researchers mail computer attitude quiz 
By BUD LUEPKE 
News Staff 

Technology. It shapes our lives. 
The telephone has become essential 
in every home. The television set is 
for many, an intrinsic part of daily 
living. In 1984, computers arc the 
"new" technology. 

The Social Science Training and Research Laboratory is mailing to random students a survey concern­ing attitudes towards computers. 
The survey is aimed at discovering different conceptions of, and feelings toward., computers. 
Dr. Stephen Arndt, a program­mer/consultant at the Lab, came up with the idea of the survey while in his own work with computers. He explained, "Once I sat next to a guy working a computer, and he was sweating. Some people fear com­puters. I had never thought of them (computers) that way." Arndt said he worked with computers in the Navy and now has a computer in his home. 
The survey was mailed last week to 1500 undergraduate students, about 20 percent of the student body, and were sent completely at random. About 250 surveys have been returned, and Arndt said the return rate is less than what he had hoped for. Arndt said he expects to receive the rest of the surveys with­in next two weeks. 
The survey itself includes a wide range of questions. It begins with questions aiming at categorizing stu­dents by year, sex, department of

study, and experience with com­
puters. 

The survey then asks the student 
how he views computing and 
people who work with computers. 
For instance, do you view com­
puters as feminine or masculine? Do 
you view people who spend a lot of 
time with computers as socially in­
ept or socially adept? For these ques­
tions, a student may circle a number 
one through seven, one being one 
extreme and seven being the other. 
All of the questions have degrees to 
their answers such as this. 

The survey next asks for the stu­
dent's personal attitude toward 
computers. For example, using a 
scale ofone through seven, it asks if 
you view computers as easy or dif­
ficult, as humanizing or dehumaniz­
ing. 

The survey's purpose, as Arndt 
admits, is unclear at this Lime. He has 
no hypotheses yet. "For now," he 
said, "I just want to find out what the 
conceptions (of computers) are. 
You sec advertising making assump­
tions of what people's misconcep­
tions are, but no one ever really 
went out to ask them". Arndt also 
said, "Once I know what the concep­
tions are, I can then think about 
ways ofsoftening the impact oftech­
nology on society." 

Arndt expects the results of the 
survey to be completed by the end 
of May or june. To find out more 
about the survey or its results, Arndt 
can be contacted in the Social 
Science Training and Research 
Laboratory on the fifth floor of the

The important points behind Viewpoint 
On March 25, a new administration took over at The Obseroer; its first issue was printed the next day. The current issues of The Ob­seroer are now the product of this new and 
David Grote 
Speaking out ofturn 

still inexperienced group. If the first breaths of this new leadership prove unsteady, inex­perience will probably be to blame. 
Viewpoint is no exception. New people, new writers and new leadership mean errors in both the appearance and the content ofthis page. Hopefully, these errors will start to dis­appear as I become more settled as editor. 
The Viewpoint page in The Obseroer is the one place where issues and ideas are ex­
amined and discussed, and where the reader is given a chance to respond. Occasionally, the opinion expressed will be 
an official statement from The Obseroer's editorial board. This statement will be published in the form of a house editorial. A house editorial is a concensus of the ideas of the ten members of the editorial board and will appear when important issues surface on campus. 
The house editorial, though, is the excep­tion rather than the rule. Most of the articles you will read on this page will be the opinions of individuals, the great majority of them stu­dents. These articles will raise important issues and will hopefully prompt you to form­ulate your own ideas. 
You will not always agree with the opinions on this page. Sometimes you may be down­right offended. But ifthe writer has expressed himselfclearly, and has inspired you to think, then he has certainly fulfilled his duty as an editorialist. 
But Viewpoint articles will not be confined to student writers. The Obseroer is always looking for new people with new perspectives. In the future this page will seek out articles from faculty and administrative staff, who with their experienced and profes­sional point of view may offer accurate descriptions of such things as the changing job market, the dynamic future of personal computers, or the explanation of the official Church stand on important social issues. 
The Viewpoint page serves a vital role as an open forum for ideas and opinions at Notre Dame. One ofits duties is to provide space for all members of our community to express their opinions. 
P. 0. Box Q provides our readers with the opportunity not only respond to articles appearing in The Obseroer, but also to allow readers to expound on issues they see as sig­

· nificant in the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's com­
munity. 
Guest columns and letters to the editor are 
the readers' stake in The Obseroer. The stu­
dents, faculty and adminstration should make 
use of the resources we offer. 
As editor, though, the final day-to-day deci­sion ofwhat appears on the Viewpoint page is solely my own. Letters to the editor are printed when space provides. But to respon­sibly serve readers it is important to print as many letters as possible. If two letters promote the same point ofview on a topic, we may only run one of them. In this way, the opinion is still honored, even though a name may not appear. 
The content of Viewpoint should be intel­lectually compelling, clearly presented and representative ofvarious perspectives. Hope­fully, during the upcoming year, Viewpoint will meet this goal with consistency.

Satirical exploits 
Dear Editior 
It's refreshing to see that The Obseroer has decided to branch out into unexplored ter­ritory with bold new additions to its format; now we, the readers, are blessed with funny, accurate parodies of the simple-mindedness and naivete that threaten this university. 
The Viewpoint article entitled "Come to Paradise, come to Notre Dame" really had me in stitches. The author seems to touch all the bases with his mocking ofthe automatons that threaten to stifle any attempt at free thinking by the students ofthis university. 
Especially pointed were the attacks on the fictive narrator's dangerous moral com­placency, insidious self-righteousness, his flair for absurd hyperbole, and his simple ig­norance of the very real problems of al­coholism, strained relationships between the sexes, and lack of open-mindedness on the part of the students, faculty and administra­tion. 
This article is a stunning example ofone of the things this campus needs: parody that is relevant and makes us laugh. It is a parody, isn't it?...isn't it? 
Christopher Miller freshman 
Opportunity to learn 
DearEditor: 

I can almost remember when I too was a freshman, when I thought Notre Dame was paradise, when Friday quizzes were "tests of integrity".... Freshman year was when the reasons for coming to Notre Dame were still fresh in my mind, when my naivete and in­nocence were staunchly guarded against all that was evil by the protecters at the Fresh­man Year ofStudies. 
Imagine thinking that the reason why every Chemistry 115 student received the same quiz was because it made grading so much easier. Surely it was obvious that these were tests ofcharacter, not chemistry. 
Academic competition motivates students to work harder, learn better, and struggle more to achieve that precious academic edge over their peers. Unfortunately, this competi­tion also breeds backstabbers and cheaters. 
As a tutor for Freshman Chemistry, my job was supposedly to help failing students become more proficient at learning the sub­ject matter. Most students enrolled in these tutorial sessions were not "F" students, but rather, "B" students struggling to obtain that competitive edge. 
Asadder point was that some students were not interested in learning chemistry, but in learning how to get the coveted "seven" on the weekly quiz. In so doing, these overac­hievers denied proper instruction to the stu­dents with real problems. 
When a person steals answers on a quiz, the cheater is the only person harmed; when a stu­dent steals the opportunity to learn from an­other student, this is a greater offense. 
But wait... let us not forget that this is as close to paradise as an earthly paradise can be...where freshmen and teachers are above reproach...well, at least backstabbers here do not have long hair. 
Ted Underiner Senior 

Alcohol and exams 
Dear Editor: 
There seems to be two controversial issues receiving attention on this page during these past weeks: the campus alcohol problem and the campus cheating problem. 
Many members ofthe student body, faculty, and administration agree that there is some form ofabuse regarding both these problems. A major concern ofthese persons is that both abuses have been readily accepted as part of the everyday life at Notre Dame. 
Since the administration feels that the best way to handle situations such as these is to take away the source of the problem (e.g. taking care of the alcohol problem by taking away alcohol). I feel that the administration should remain consistent in its behavior by simply doing away with all exams as a solution to the cheating problem.

Q 
What was born on a rainy af­
: ternoon in 1979 in Montreal, Canada? 
A: Trivial Pursuit, an adult board game that Scott Abbott and Chris and John Haney hope will be their "million dollar baby." 
Abbott and Chris Haney, former Canadian journalists, got the idea to invent their own game while playing Scrabble. It took the two less than an hour to design its basic structure. 
The object of Pursuit is to move around the wheel-shaped board by rolling a die and then answering a question. There are six categories of questions: geography, history, art and literature, science and nature, entertainment, and sports and leisure. There is a special space on the board that corresponds to each of these categories. A player obtains a marker by answering the question correctly when he lands on such a space. A player must collect a marker from each category and then travel to the center to win. 
Sounds pretty simple, right? Just answer six little questions and get to the center. No big deal. 
A definite misconception. This is where the "adult" aspect of the game comes into play. There are 1,000 questions for each category,

W
hat is it like to fall in love with a 
mermaid? Well, ifyou are in­

terested in acquiring an answer to 
this question, "Splash" is the movie 
for you. 
"Splash" is a wonderfully funny and delightful movie about a New Yorker named Alan Bauer (played by Tom Hanks) who has his dreams fulfilled. Alan shares ownership ofa New York-based fruit and vegetable supply company with his brother (played by John Candy from SClV). The business is doing great, but Alan's life has taken a plunge. Sad­dened by the fact that he has no one to love, Alan plods around in a dejected state for the frrst 1 5 minutes ofthe film. After taking an extremely costly cab ride from New York City to Massachusetts, Alan falls out ofa small motorboat into the hay (I won't tell you what he was doing there in the first place) and because he has never learned to swim, sinks slowly to the bottom. 
Enter our mermaid (swimmingly portrayed by Daryl Hannah) who rescues Alan and drops him on the shore where he awakens a few hours later. After giving him a quick kiss, the mermaid jumps back into the sea and leaves Alan standing alone on the beach with a bunch ofquestions. 
A few days later, the mermaid shows up in the buffat the Statue of Liberty where she causes quite a scene. When she is arrested by the police, Alan's wallet is found in her possession and he is immediately notified. Alan picks her up at the police station and takes her to his apartment. Throughout the course ofthe following days, Alan educates her, names her Madison and falls deeply in love with her.

and the answers are not obvious. 
Trivia buffs feel this game was made for them. Finally something to challenge the intellect. That's some­thing you can't say about video games or Dungeons and Dragons, which relics mainly on imagination. 
Pursuit has been called the most successful game to come along in the last 30 years. So far this seems ttl be holding true. Stores have been selling out the 540 game as fast as they get them in. Translations of the game are being marketed around the world, and a second supplement (the original is called Genius I) called Silver Screen is already available in the U.S. Also due out soon arc two othersupplements, All­Star Sports and Baby Boomer. Baby Boomer will contain questions span­ning the 19SO's through the early 1970's. 
The appeal of Pursuit is obvious. It's a great get together game in that anywhere from two to 24 people can play. It's a lot offun, but it may have an adverse effect on your ego. Remarked one student, "I always considered myselfpretty intelligent, but after an hour and a half(of A roomful of Notre Dame students pur Trivial Pursuit) I'm not so sure." But right, are Karen Russell, Teresa Barker, A. don't let that stop you. Left to right above are Nick Wiggins, A tic

scientist ( played by Eugene Levy, another SClV veteran) who is trying to prove to his peers that Madison really is a mermaid. 
Being a hometown Noo Yawk boy, I immediately knew that I had a good flick on my hands when I noticed that the opening scene was filmed on the Staten Island Ferry. But don't get the idea that this film is only for New Yorkers. On the con­trary, it is a film for anyone who en­joys a good laugh. 
The acting is ofa high caliber and each of the four ofthe major charac­ters' roles are written and portrayed in such a manner as to augment the efforts of the other three. Tom Hanks is exceptional as Alan. He definitely succeeds in playing the straight role to Daryl Hannah's naive humor. Hannah is also very goob as the beauty from the sea. And w.at more needs be said about the t.nts ofCandy and Levy who have been mainstays ofthe Second Gty Te'levi­sion Network for years. Their raucous and quick-witted humor keeps the action moving at a fast and funny pace throughout the film. 
The story suffers slightly from un­believability at times, but come on; this is a movie about a guy who falls in love with a mermaid; the whole premise is just a link overboard. 

Despite this fact, "Splash" is won­derfully entertaining and worth the price ofadmission. One word of advice: Buy your popcorn and soda before the show starts becaus~ every minute is filled with laughs and fun which you won't want to miss. Rated P.G. for Pretty Good!

Dancin' Irish not just a sideshow 

Dancin' Irish member Jill McPartin is cuddled by the Chicago White Sox mascot-

features staffwriter 

T
he Dancin' Irish, a squad of NO and SMC girls who perform to the tunes ofsuch singers as Michael Jackson, The Cars, and George Ben­son, arc in the process ofsteppin' out into areas other than the home basketball scene. 
The squad, composed ofsixteen or seventeen girls, is best recognized for its performance of various dance routines during halftime at NO varsity basketball games. They are, however, involved in other activities which extend beyond these occasional, briefper­formances. In fact, the character of the Dancin' Irish, shown in their en­hancement ofcampus spirit and en­tertainment and their promotion of unity between schools, is that ofone ofthe more dedicated and social or­ganizations on campus. 
Preparation for events begins with a two day clinic which instructs all prospective Dancin' Irish can­didates on the choreography oftwo dance routines. During the tryouts which follow these clinics, the girls arc judged by a committee on their ability to master one of the routines and on their showmanship. After ac­ceptance, the squad follows a rigorous schedule which includes a one or two hour daily workout finishing with a final videotaping 
with the help ofSaint Mary's Assis­
tant Athletic Director Tim Dillon. 
All routines performed by the 
squad are choreographed on a 
volunteer basis through group in­
put. So far, aside from home basket­
ball games, the Dancin' Irish have 
participated in such activities as the 
homecoming parade, dancing on the 
quad, selling programs before foot­
ball games, and on occasion 
performing at halftime during a NO 
soccer game. 
Co-captains Cheryl Diaz andJill McPartlin agree the season has been successful, with the exception ofa few unforeseen problems. These problems began with the loss of their moderator,Jan Bishop, and the lack ofa replacement_ 
When asked about the effect on the squad ofcoping without a moderator, Patty Whitehouse, a two year veteran, commented that Bis­hop had never closely associated with or assisted the squad. The cap­tains had always been self-sufficient and responsible for coordinating ar­rangements for games and choosing uniforms. 
Without the authority ofa moderator, the squad faced various scheduling problems due to a lack of voice in the athletic department_ Eileen Hogan, also a two year mem­ber, expressed frustration over the apparent apathy on the part ofthe department, which resulted in the squad being denied the opportunity to perform at the best attended games. 
To further complicate matters, the Dancin' Irish were forced to operate without University funding, although they did receive asssis­tancc from Saint Mary's College. 

The squad is optimistic with regard to the future. Their main ob· jectivc is to broaden their horizons and to overcome some ofthe dif­ficulties encountered this year. 
An important priority this year is the quest for a "home base" offering guidance and representation to authority. Such guidance could be found in departments other than Student Activities, with which they ue currently affiliated. Once this is

In any case, the Dancin' Irish are truly a dedicated and professional gr<JUp, willing to make the sacrifices and committmcnts necessary for quality performances. With the con­tinued support ofthe student body, (and the hope ofa new sound sys­tem), the Dmcin' Irish look toward continued expansion into other ac­tivities while always remaining Notre Dame basketball's "halftime show."

match," said junior Paul Najarian. "After Hawaii, in the locker room, you could sec that we all wanted it. We just said 'let's go for it!"'. 
The Irish got out to a quick start against the Bobcats, as Najarian won at fifth singles against John Knezevitch 6-1, 6-0 and captain Tim Noonan defeated Tim Bruin at fourth singles, 7-6 ( 7-3 ), 6-1. 
"I played really well today," said Najarian. "I seemed to pick up my form in Florida. Yesterday, I was so cold I didn't do well, so today I got psyched up for the match." 
"He (Knezevitch) got dis­couraged. He was a good player, but after I won the first set he let down. After yesterday, it felt good to come back and win." 
Even after his win, Noonan wasn't totally happy with his play. "I'm still not playing great," said the team qp­tain. "I played well on some pig points -that was the difference.

"He tried to come in on the second set, and I hit my passing shots real well. I think he might have been tired from playing this morn· ing (against Hawaii)." 
"I was not too pleased with our performance today," said Fallon. "We still made too many unforced errors. But we're playing much bet· ter doubles; we just need more practice." 
Tomorrow, Notre Darne will be on the road again, travelling to Bowling Green University. Last year the-Irish defeated the Falcons 7-2 at Courtney. 
"They are always tough at home," said Fallon, "last year we had a close match."

The Observer 
Parker comes home, leads Reds past Mets 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI -Dave Parker delighted a hometown crowd with a two-run single, and Mario Soto baftled New York on seven hits as the Cincinnati Reds routed the Mets 8-1 yesterday in the traditional Na­tional League opener. 
Parker, a Cincinnati native who signed with the Reds as a free agent in the off-season, responded to a standingovation with a bases-loaded single in his first at-bat as the Reds scored three runs in the first inning off Mike Torrez and claimed their ninth opening-day victory in 11 years. 
Eddie Milner barely cleared the lowered eight-foot outfield wall with a three-run homer in the second inning that put the Reds ahead 6-1 and chased Torrez, I0-1 7 last season. Milner also had a single and a double in four at-bats to help the Retls win their first game under Manager Vern Rapp. 
Sotd, 17-10, a year ago with 242 strikeduts and league-leading 18 complete games, fanned eight while going fhe distance in a match-up be­tween the league's two worst teams of1983. 
The earliest NL opener in modern-day baseball history was played in a festive atmosphere before a crowd 46,000 on a sunny and mild April afternoon. 
Retired Reds catcher Johnny Bench led a traditional opening day parade though downtown and then was wheeled onto the field on a horse-drawn carriage. A fan from nearby Middletown, Ohio, chosen in a radio contest, threw out the ceremonial first pitch as elected of­ficias and other dignitaries crowded the field. 
Soto, who has never lost to the Mets in nine career appearances, made his third consecutive opening day start in style with two strikeouts in the first inning. 
Cincinnati then struck for three runs in the first inning, loading the bases with none out on Gary Redus' double, Milner's single and a walk to Dave Concepcion. 
Parker hit a ground single through a hole at second for two runs, and Concepcion scored when Dan Driessen hit into a fielder's choice. 
Darryl Strawberry, last season's Rookie ofthe Year, homered leading off the second, but Cincinnati ex­ploded for four more runs in the bot­tom of the inning. 
Dan Bilardello doubled and Soto, trying to sacrifice, placed a perfect bunt for a single. Milner then homered just inches over the right field wall, bringing on reliever Ed Lynch. 
With two outs, Parker singled and Driessen walked. Nick Esasky then hit an infield popup that the Mets surrounded but let drop for a double scoring Parker.

The White Sox, last year's AL west Division champions, already had struck for two runs before Ripken's opposite field drive into the right field bleachers. 
Singles by Rudy Law and Carlton Fisk, and a ground out by Blines produced the first run off Scott McGregor, an 18-game winner last year.

Reserves propel Georgetown to top 
Associated Press 
SEATfLE -Georgetown has 
Patrick Ewing and Houston ha~ 

Akeem Olajuwon, hut the Hoyas are 
NCAA ha~ketball champions he­

cause they also have a host of 
reserves, led by freshmen Michael 
Graham and Reggie Williams. 
While Ewing was named the Most 
Outstanding Player in the Final Four 
after his personal hattie of 7-footers 
with Olajuwon, Williams and 
Graham carried second-ranked 
Georgetown to an 84-75 victory 

over Houston for the national cham­
pionship last night. 
"It's a fabulous feeling. We're elated to win the national champion­ship," said Coach John Thompson, whose team narrowly missed the title in 1982. "It's much"arder to get here than win one game for the na­tional championship. 
"Guy Lewis is an excellent coach. They've been to the Final Four three straight years." 
Thompson and his players 

embraced joyflly as the final seconds 
ticked off, the memories of the 
runner-up finish to North Carolina 
two years ago were wiped away. 
But it was sorrow again for Hous­

ton, which was upset 54-52 by 
North Carolina State a year ago. 
Olajuwon and his Cougar 
teammates sobbed on the bench a~ 
time ran out Monday night, before 
39,471 fans in the Kingdome. 
It was the first time since Ohio 

State in 1961-62 that a school had 
lost the championship game two 
years in a row. Houston also reached 

tht Final Four in 1967, '68 and '81, 
hut has never won the title. 
The depth of the Hoyas, who finished 34-3, was never more evi­dent than in the final 7:35 ofthe first half. Ewing was on the bench with two fouls, while Olajuwon picked up his second and third personals. Olajuwon picked up his fourth foul less than a minute into the second half, and played tentatively the rest of the way. 
In winning their 1 1 th straight game and 21st of the last 22, the second-ranked Hoyas culminated the rebuilding program that Thompson began when he took ove a 3-23 club in 1972. The former backup center for the Boston Celtics has been criticized for some of his tactics on and off the court, but he said after the championship victory that "the bottom line is that my kids graduate." 
"I don't have a problem with people criticizing us," he said. "I'm not concerned with my critics." 
"I'm elated about winning the championship," Thompson t'on­tinued, "hut the hardest thing is to get here. Anyone can win one game." 
For a while, it looked as if it would he Houston winning that elusive

Houston could take some con­solation in rolling up 75 points against the lloya defense, which had held opponents to an average of5 7.4 points in previous games this season. 

Georgetown, champions of tht Big East, usually uses 10 players but ' had to do without standout defensive guard Gene Smith, who suffered a sprained right foot in a 53­40 victory over Kentucky in the semifinals Saturday. 
While Ewing was sitting down to avoid further foul problems late in the first half, Olajuwon picked up his second and third personals before sitting out the last 42 seconds of the half. This marked the first time in four tournament games that Olajuwon did not play the entire game. 
Ewing got his third personal with 
12:08 to go and Georgetown leading 55-49. But he went out for only about a minute just before Franklin's two free throws cut the Houston deficit to 57-54.

Team captain Rick Vaive, who registered his third successive 50­goal season for the Leafs to claim the Molson Cup for the third con­secutive time, said it was unfor­tunate the blame for the Leafs' poor performance this season had to rest on one person's shoulders. 
"It's everybody's fault," said Vaive, one ofthe bright spots on a club that finished last in the Norris Division with a 26-45-9 record. The 45 losses were the most ever suffered by the Leafs in one season. "It's unfortunate one guy has to lose his job over it." 
The club also was wracked by in­juries in every area for most of the season and the club Nykoluk had to work with put together three win­ning streaks all season -one offour games and two oftwo games.

S~orts 
Irish linebacking corps looks strong 
ByJOE BRUNEm 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame linebacker coach 

George Kelly should feel lucky. 
He has three high school all­Americans to fill two spots at inside linebacker for next year's football team. 
In addition to being highly touted out of high school, Tony Furjanic, Mike Larkin and Mike Kovaleski each ha'i proven his ability to per­form well in crucial situations. 
If there is one thing that the three lack, however, it is experience. Each of the three have only one year of experience on the starting defensive unit. 
"They're all young. They've only played one year (on the starting team)," says Kelly. "'But, their abilities arc far in excess of the total linebacking picture that I have had in yt·ars." 
To what degret: the Notre Dame lim:backing corps will be able to dominate opponents depends on whether Larkin returns to his forrrl of I982. 

Tony Furjanie 

Larkin had a banner sophomore sea'ilm in '82, making a second­leading I 12 tackles for the Irish. The 6-1, 221-pound, Moeller High School graduate broke his arm prior to the opening of last year's season and was forced to sit out the entire year. 
"Larkin's progress has heen fine. But, when you sit out a year, it sets you back," the veteran Irish mentor 
notes. "It's not like starting over, but 
it knocks you out of your groove, 
and Mike is finding it hard to get 
back in the groove. Right now, he 
lacks the necessary timing." 
With Larkin forced to redshirt the 

'83 season, the Irish coaching staff 
called upon Kovaleski, then a fresh­
man, to fill Larkin's shoes. 
Kovaleski started the first nine 

games of the season before getting 
hurt in the Pittsburgh game. After 
sitting out the Penn State and Air 
Force games, he returned to start in 
the Uberty Bowl. 
"Not having Kovaleski in there 

really hurt us," Kelly says. 
The 6-2, 2I8-pound Kovaleski 

turned out to be the surprise of the 
defensive unit last season, finishing 
third on the team in tackles with 62. 
"Kovaleski is a real competitor," 

praises Kelly. "He surprised us last 
year. He learned fast, but more im­
portantly, he performed well under 
pressure." 
The mainstay for the Irish at middle linebacker will be junior-to­be Tony Furjanic. Besides having to meet the need to excel a'i a player, the role of a leader may also fall on the shoulders of the OJicago native. 
"I would hope he'll be a leader," Kelly says ofhis 6-2, 23I-pound star. "He's not the type to speak out. In· stead he leads by example." 
As a freshman, Furjanic earned a monogram through his impressive play on special teams. He had a stel­lar season in 1983, leading the Irish defense with 142 tackles, and start­ing all 12 games. He also shined in the Liberty Bowl, garnering a pass in­terception and later being named the Notre Dame defensive MVP. 
"He's had an outstanding spring. He ha'i started where he left off last season," comments Kelly. "His abilities at ths point are on par with the Zavagnins and Crables." 
One problem Kelly will fdce is what to do with all the talent and on­ly two starting positions to fill. 
''I'm not sure," says Kelly. "It's still too early to tell, but one may play outside linebacker." 
With all of the talent Kelly has available, the inside linebacking positions again will be a strong suit for the Irish.
