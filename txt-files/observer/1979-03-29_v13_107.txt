Radiation escapes from power plant 
HARRISBURG, Pa. (Ap)-An atcident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant sent radiation beaming through the plant's 4-foot-thick walls and was detected as far as a mile from the plant, the government said yesterday. 
Before the announcement from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Washington, plant offkials hqd said only a small amount of radioactive steam escaped when a valve bkw out on a water pump that cools a reactor. 
But Joe Fouchard, an NRC spokesman. said radiation from the steam alone would not be strong enough to penetrate the steel-lined power plant walls. 
The only likely source of the radiation being detected appears to be some portion of the reactor's nuclear fuel. 
Fouchard said control rods have been inserted into the nuclear core to stop the nuclear reaction, but he said it wasn't known whether some part of the fuel might have melted, evapo­rated or blown out of the core before emergency measures were taken. 
Plant officials said some workers may have been conta­minated, but insisted no signifi­cant radiation leaked outside the facility. 
1 'I'm sure some of them got exposure, but positively none were over-exposed,'' Jack Her­bein, vict'-president for genera­tion at Metropolitan Edison, one of the consortium of utili­ties that runs the facility, said before the NRC announcement. 
Plant spokesman William Gross said I'a handful'' of workers were contaminated. The planr employs 500 persons, and Gross said 2 5 technicians were examining the workers with _geiger counters. 
Officials had said earlier that readings taken from the atmos­phere outside the plant after the accident showed less radia­tion than a person would absorb 
from a chest X-ray.

Commission,  said  low  level

Security issues fines 
by Paul Hurley 

Notre Dame Security is pre­sently in possession of 65 pieces of identification left unclaimed by students at campus entrance gates. 
The pieces of identification, 90 percent of which are driver's licenses, were confiscated by Security after students left their cars on cam~ms in excess of their alloted ume. 
The issuin of citations is a security policy begun this year. Wall said that the new policy is aimed at reducin~ the number ofon-campus veh1cle violations. The amount of the fine accom­panying the citation increases with the number of violations committed. 

Each of the owners of the confiscated driver's licenses has received a citation accom­panied by a fine ranging in amount from one to ten dollars.

Callaghan 's government loses vote 
LONDON (AP) --Prime Mini­
ster)ames Callaghan's minor­
ity Labor Government lost a 
vote of confidence yesterday 
night in the House of Commons 
by a single ballot, forcing 
national elections that could 
bring Britain its first chief of 
government. 
The vote has on a motion of 
censure put before the Com­
mons by Mrs. Margaret 
Thatcher, 53-year-old leader of 
the opposition Conservative 
Party, her motion was approved 
by a margin of 311-310. 
In debate before the vote Mrs. Thatcher, who could become Britain's next prime minister, said, .,.'The government has failed the nation, lost credibility and it is time for it to go.'' 
''Britain is now a nation on the sidelines. Rarely in the post­war period can our standing in the world have been lower or our defenses weaker.'' 
Callaghan, 67, now must re­sign and call a general election. Labor has been in power since 1974. 
Callaghan's government has been beset in recent months by widespread strikes that have crippled the economy. 
It was the second time this century a government has fal­len on a motion of censure. The last was in 1924 when Ramsay MacDonald was ousted. 
The vote indicated seven abstentions from the 635 mem­bers of the House of Commons. 
The breakdown was 311 for the motion of censure, 310 against, with three seats vacant through death or resignation, four non-voting officers of the House and seven abstentions. 

Mcinerny urges expansion of 





Medieval studies to undergraduates 
by Tom Hay 
Medieval Studies is a growing under~raduate discipline at many colleges and umversities across the nation, but the program at Notre Dame has included only graduate students in its 33 year history. Prof. Ralph Mcinerny, director of Notre Dame's Medieval Institute, wants to change that policy. 
"What I'm interested in doing is making the imP-act felt on the college level," Mcinerny said. 1 Our collegiate sequence right now exists 
mainly on paper." 
An undergraduate program of Medieval Stu­dies was formulated in 1977, but has yet to be :mplemented. Mcinerny believes that the . iggest problem rests with publicity. "It will 
t. ke a while for people to see lt as a possibility,'' he said. ''The only way ofrecruiting right now is through courses in other departments, but word-of-mouth advertising is what we really need." 
Medieval Civilization, the name of the under­graduate sequence, is the equivalent of a major, but may be ~ore attractive as pa~ of a .dou~le major, accordmg to Mcinerny. Nme Umvers1ty departments will participate in the program. 
Some area universities offering undergradu­ate majors in Medieval studies include Western Michi ari Universit , Ball State Universi , Indiana Universiry and J-lurdue. 
Medieval Stud1es at Notre Dame places its emphasis on intellectual history as opposed to pohtical, economic, or cultural history. This mvolves examination of institutions, theology, 

philosophy,  literature,  and  other  facets  of  
medievalmtellectuallife.  
"We want  to  understand  a  time,  like  the  

Middle Ages," said Mcinerny. "Not just what people were doing, but what they were thinking about, and the questions they were asking." 
Much of the work involves trying to re-evalu­ate what was said historically and supporting it with evidence if possible. "We look at what they're saying, why, and on what basis." 

. Mcinerny say. 
The studies focus on basic human questions. According to Mcinerny, ' 1 Medieval Studies opens up ways. of understanding what it is to be a human being. Some people back then were talking about things that we're still thinking about now. Some of the similarities over time can knock you out.'' 
The Medieval Institute at Notre Dame, established in 1946, is essentially involved with research on the graduate level. Located on the seventh floor of the Memorial Library, the Institute's library contai~s about 40,000 volumes and 2,400 reels of m1c~ofilm.' among other

State health officials, however say there is no direct evidence to link the birth defects wid~ the agricultural herbicide. Five of 17 babies born since 1975 in the community were reported to have severe congenital birth defects,but one of them was determined to have a birth defect that was hereditary. The national average for birth defects is between 1 and 2 percent. Rolla's is almost 25 percent.

WASHINGTON (AP) --Presi­dent Anwar Sadat of Egypt took the offensive against Arab cri­tics yesterday, predicting 1979 will see changes in the leader­ship of SOJile countries which oppose his peace intiative. 
Sadat singled out Syria as a hard-line Arab regime which could face internal difficulties. He said the government of President Hafez Assad has to 
r 

extricate itself from a "quag­mire" in Lebanon. The domes­tic political situation for Assad will be "not very healthy," he said. 
Sadat also warned Libya a­gainst any military action against Egypt. 
Sadat made his remarks in an interview with a group of columnists. 
As he spoke, foreign ministers of Arab states met in Baghdad to consider reprisals against E~ypt for signmg the treaty wtth Israel. 
Palestine Liberation Organiza­tion leader Yassir Arafat walked out of that meeting, angry because the ministers were unwilling to go along with his call for reprisals against the United States. There were

Carter, Sadat unite to take offensive against Arab critics 
reports Libya and Syria had walked out in sympathy. Word of the walkouts had not reached 
Sadat  at  the  time  of  the  
interview.  
Whatever  happens  in  Bag­ 

hdad, Sadat said, "it won't change history." 
Sadat said that "because of past history," the leaders of most Arab states are having trouble adapting to the chan­ging situation he has helped to bring about in the Middle East. 
Sadat said Libya was letting help from Cuban an East German military advisers, as well as weapons from the Soviet Union and there are indications Libya is shifting troops to its border with Egypt. 
''There has been some border activity, but there is no more than that. We shall not tolerate any action against the border. After the lesson we gave him in 1976 (during a brief Egypt­Libya clash), he (Libyan leader Muhammar Qaddafi) will not 

repeat that. If tbf' Soviet Union 
pushes Qaddafi, he will have to 
take the consequences," Sadat 
warned. 

Sadat also challenged the right of any Arab leader, includmg himself, to speak for the Pales­tinians. "No one is entitled to decide the fate of the Pales­tinians except the Palestinians themselves,'' Sadat said. 
He had expressed hope that as the peace process continues, there will be evid<!Oce that Israel is willing to negotiate a fair settlement, and the Pales­tinians will join the talks. 
"For sure, the time has come for the Israelis to live with the facts of the region,'' Sadat said. 
He said that hard-line state­ments by Prime Minister Men­a.:hem Begin of Israel "are not encouraging to anybody to join anything with him ... With Be­gin, whenever we meet, we fight. But we have no alterna­tive. We have to meet to­gether."

Arnaldo Maura, 19, a soldier stationed at Ft. Bragg, N.C., died March 20 in East Tennes­see Baptist Hospital following brain surgery four days earlier following his lightweight ama­teur bout with Johnny Bum­phus, 18, of Nashville. 
Whittle said a microscopic examination of tissue in Maura's brain could disclose an underlying condition such as a weakness in the blood vessels that existed since birth. 
''It takes about 10 days for the brain tissue to be sectioned,'' he said. "We just have to wait on the results. It's not a complete autopsy without them.'' 
The fight was stopped one minute and 10 seconds into the third round after Bumphus knocked Maura to the ropes with a right hook and Maura

Reporters had been outside the embassy and Soviet officials told them it was necessary to move "for your own security." 
An orange glow lit up the night sky near the embassy's n.orth wing where the umdenufied Soviet had last been reported negotiating with a high-ranking Soviet official and the embassy security chief. 
Informed sources said the Russian told officials he was a sailor who grew up in an orphanage. 
He also claimed he wanted to "set an example for all dissi­dents.'' 
The referee, Fred Parr, said in an interview with the Knoxville News-Sentinel, that he doesn't remember the specifics about the fight but he is certain nothing out of the ordinary occurred in the ring. 
"I heard Johnny Bumphus' account," said Parr, 47, of Rossville, Ga., and a member of the Chattanooga delegation of the southern Gloves tournq. "I can understand that and I don't blame him one bit. But if there's anything I've ever been criticized about in my referee­ing, it's that I've stopped fights too soon.'' 
Parr said there was no effort by Maura's coach, Sgt. Gene Brown of Ft. Bragg, to halt the fight earlier. Brown said he asked Maura, who was wearing protective head gear during the bout, ifhe wanted to quit at the end of the second round. 

"Ifl had thought anything was wrong, I would have stopped it," Brown said. "He was talking with a clear head and said he didn't want to stop. When he got hit in ·the third round, that is when I stopped in to stop it but he was already being counted out." 
Maura, a native of Cuba whose parents live in Miami, Fla., walked of the ring under his own power. He was taken to the hospital when he became ill in the dressing room after the bout.

Stars leave center stage in Hollywood-style trial 

LOS ANGELES (AP) ·· With testimony concluded, Lee Mar­vin and Michelle Triola Marvin stepped off center stage in their Hollywood-style trial yesterday leavmg the next lines to their lawyers and the iudge. 
But the most cmcial scenes in the courtroom drama are still ahead--the closing arguments by attorneys and the judge's verdict in the battle over Mar­vin's millions. 
''I think we've proven our case," said Miss Marvin's at­torney, Marvin Mitchelson. 
"I'm extremely optimistic," said A. David Kagon, represen­ting Marvin. 
"I feel like crying," Miss Marvin said as testimony closed. 
"I'd do it all over again," said Marvin. 
The case already set legal precedent by coming to court at all. At issue is whether Miss Marvin can collect alimony-like benefits after breaking up with Marvin, with whom she had lived. 
Superior Court ) udge Arthur Marshall, who ltstened to 11 weeks of testimony, said he wiU await submission of the attor­neys' legal briefs next Wed­nesday, hear oral summations April 10, then decide if Miss Marvin should get any of the $1. 8 million she seeks. 
The memories they resur­rected of a 15-year-old love affair captured a wide audi­ence. the parade of witnesses, including show business lumi­naries, gave intimate details of a stormy movieland love affair-­the most lurid testimony since no-fault divorce stOJ?ped Holly­wood from throwmg verbal punches in open court. 
This time, the punches were being thrown by an unmarried couple--an Oscar-winning actor and a former cabaret singer whose six-year affair began on the movie set of "Ship of Fools" and ended on the beach at Malibu. 
"I love Lee," Miss Marvin would say. "I cared for Lee." "I never loved her," Marvin 
growled repeatedly. 

She referred to him as "Lee." He called her "the plaintiff," refusing to speak her name. She had legally changed her name near the end of the affair to make the same as his. 
The trial opened in January, after a seven-year battle by Miss Marvin to get her day in court. She sued in 1972, two years after she and Marvin ended the affair. Her case was thrown out of court. 
But in 1976, the California Supreme Court issued a land­mark ruling which acknow­ledged the changing morality of American couples, and said Miss Marvin and other unmar­ried cohabitants had the right to

Miss· Marvin, first on the stand, disclosed she had under­gone three abortions. "He didn't want more children," she wept. As a result, she said, "I have scars and I can't bear children." 
She depicted Marvin as an abusive drunk whose alcohol­ism tore apart their love affair. There were tales of rowdy parties, one in which Miss Marvin said the actor dangled a woman out the window of a hi~h-rise hotel. "I almost famted,'' she said. 
Marvin denied it all. He claimed he was a social drinker who never lost control of h~s faculties. He depicted Miss Marvin as an annoyance in his live, a woman who moved in and refused to leave. 


TBE RIGHT SIZE ENGINE 
BIGGER ISN'T NECESSARILY BETTER IN NEW, MORE EFFICIENT GM CARS. 
The lighter the car, the less power it takes to move it. That's the most important thing to know when you're trying to decide what engine to order for your car. 
The power-to-weight theory holds true no matter how you intend to use your car: city, highway or subur­ban driving; with two passen­gers or six; with a small trailer or pulling a heavy boat. 
Since we redesigned al­most all our cars to make them lighter and more effi­cient, the power-to-weight theory enables us to move them with smaller engines that use less gas. You can get good performance from a full-size GM car under most conditions with a six-cylinder or a small eight-cylinder en­gine instead of a larger op­tional V8. Mid-size cars, luxury cars, and redesigned compacts to be introduced this spring follow the same pattern. 
1b help you choose an engine, we designate one as standard for every model. It is an engine that provides enough acceleration to merge safely with traffic when entering a freeway, enough pick-up to cross a street quickly after heeding a stop sign, and in most models, even enough power to haul a trailer weighing up to 1,000 pounds. 

Standard engines cost less than bigger, optional engines and get better gas mileage, especially in city traffic. There is no difference in durability between stan­dard and optional engines. However, to get the most out of any GM engine, follow the maintenance schedule in the GM Owner's Manual. And remember, please, that small engines are as durable as large engines only if you give them the same care. 
1lhere are soBJe reasons for choosing larger, optional engines: if you intend to carry six passengers and lug­gage with any frequency, if you intend to haul a trailer over 1,000 pounds, and if you expect to drive often in hilly terrain. For· people who drive mainly in altitudes over 4,000 feet we offer a special high­altitude package, including a larger engine, to ensure satis­factory performance. 
Finally, your own sense of how a car should "feel" must be the deciding factor. GM dealers have cars that 
you can take for a test drive. Take that test drive. Drive the same model with a stan­dard and an optional engine, if the dealer has "demonstra­tors" with both configura­tions. You're the driver. Decide for yourself. 
We charge more for op­tional engines. Even so, our honest advice is to buy the smallest engine that fits your taste and needs. You'll save money when you buy your car, and in most cases, you'll save money on gas for as long as yQu own it. That's the nice part of energy conservation.

GSND-SMC struggles for recognition 
Editor's Note: The following is the third in a series of columns written by a member of the Gay , Students of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's (GSND-SMC). Today's column deals specifi­cally with gay life on the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's cam­puses. Tomorrow's article, the last in the series, will address the question of the impact that homosexuality will have on our society in the future. 
In the past two articles, I have dealt with some aspects of gay life in general. Now I wish to turn the focus on the gay struggle here at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. The issue is certainly in full force here on the campuses. Four gay Notre Dame students appeared on public televiston several weeks ago and shocked the two other­WISe calm campuses. Reverend Shanky, who has been fighting for sexual minorites in the Catholic Church, will be coming to speak at Notre Dame on Apnl 
10. The GSND-SMC is cur­rently involved in an attempt to gain offtcial recognition from Notre Dame. The question is how well the gay issue and gay students can survive the ND­SMC community. 

First of all, much to my surprise, the reaction to the television program, Straight Talk.on channel 34, was very favorable. At first, there was the typical response: nasty phone calls from Notre Dame <>tudents and the threat of the gay students losing important positions on the campus (the four students each had fairly prestigious positions at Notre Dame). But, soon after, the responses from students, faculty, and administrators was very agreeable. 
Besides this favorable reac· tion to the program, the ad·

ministrators with whom the group has been meeting, the statf of Student Affairs, have been more than willing to listen to out plea for official recogni· tion. The GSND-SMC has been, in the past, the only organization ever denied offi­cial recognition. Very few sub­stilntial advances have been made for the group before this year. 
The GSND-SMC representa­tives meet with Student Activi­ties director, John Reid, every week. Through Reid and through personal contact, the GSND-SMC has brought the Student Affairs committee to at least a recognition of the prob !ems gays have in the commu· nity and at most the first serious consideration of the group as an official organiza­tion. I personally spoke with Fr. Van Wolvlear, Fr. Greene, and Dean Roemer, and each handled the meetings with concern and true interest in the matter. The main problem was­that these people have never had to turn their attentions toward the topic. 
The Student Affairs com­mittee as a whole informed the ~roup that they consider the tssue well worth their time and effort. They want the group to inform both the admimstrators and the students about being 
gay,  and  about  gay  life  in  
general.  ·  
Official  recognition,  says  

Dean Roemer, does not mean that the University is placing its stamp of approval on the organ­ization in question; therefore the ethical concerns would carry less weight than one would assume. But, he added, official recognition does carry the implication of approval, and that is why, if he had to make the final decision at this point in time, he could no~ pass official

the Editorial Board. Commentaries, opinions and letters are the views of 
recognition. 

The Student Affairs com­mittee is the group that has the final decision. This decision can, of course, be'vetoed by Fr. Hesburgh. Hesburgh has denied recognition to the group in the past, giving as a reason the fact that the University is a Catholic institution. The Catho­lic Church does not condemn gay people but does see a gay lifestyle as asainst God's favor. Therefore, 10 the Catholic Church and at Notre Dame, it is all right to be gay but not to live gay. 
Another problem is that a gay lifestyle does not assume homo­sexual sex, but naturally, implies it. Since Notre Dame does not approve of any kind of pre-marital sex, the issue be­comes even more complicated. 
What the GSND-SMC has to hope for, then, is first to make the campuses aware of the issue so that some serious thought can result. Once good thoug-ht is circulating, admini­stration, faculty, and students may begin to readjust their thinking away from stereotypes and archaic codes. Then and only then can the GSND-SMC expect to be officially recog· nized. It will be a long, hard struggle, but well worth it for the hundreds of gay people in the community and for all of us as mature adults.

Hydrogen bomb lobby 
WA:O,HJNGTON--As soon as it was revealed that a n-porter for Progressive Magazine had discovered how to make a hydrogen bomb, a group of firearm zealots formed the National 
Hydrogen  Bomb  Assn.,  and  they  are  now  
lobbying  against  any  legislation  to  stop  
Americans from owning one.  

"The ConstitutioQ," said the association's spokesman, ''gives everyone the right to own and bear arms. It doesn't spell out what kind of arms. But since anyone can now make a hydrogen bomb the public should be able to buy it to protect themselves." 
"Don't you think it's dangerous to have one in the house, particularly where there are children around?'' 
"The Natic~:.i Hydrogen Bomb Assn. ho{>es to spend a good portion of its dues on educatmg people in the safe handling of this rype of weapon. We are instructing owners to keep the bomb in a locked closet and the fuse separately in a drawer. We also will hold classes in how to fire the bomb. We believe that ifa person knows how to take care of his bomb there is no danger to himself or his family." 
···some reople consider the hydrogen bomb a very letha weapon ~hich could kill somebody.'' 
The spokesman said, "Hydrogen bombs donlt kill people--people kill people. The bomb is for self-protection and it also has a deterrent effect. If somebody knows you have a nuclear weapon in your house, they're going to think twice about breaking in.'' 
"But those who want to ban the bomb for American citizens claim that if you have one locked in the closet, with the fuse in a drawer, you would never be able to assemble it in time to repulse an intruder." 
"That's garbage put out by the antinuclear weapon people. We are only advocating

Cheer leading 
quota impractical 
and unfair 
Dear Editor: 
We would like to respond to a letter appearing in the last issue of the Observer before spring break concerning the newly introduced cheerleader selection regulations. We sup­port the letter and fed that the mdividual's complaint is in­deed a legitimate one. As indicated, the new regulation stipulates that a majority of the females selected for the 1980-81 squad must be from Notre Dame (i.e., at least four out of the six). We, roo, question this new policy. 
In our experiences, we have 
'found that St. Mary's students are just as, if not more, highly spirited as Notre Dame females in the support of our athletic teams. This would indicate that they sincerely believe in the concept of the ''ND-SMC com­munity" and that they are indeed members of the ''great· est student body in the nation," well-known for its displays of school spirit. 
If the ties within the ND-SMC community are as strons as most of us would like to be!teve,

ownership of hydrogen weapons by law-abiding citizens. If someone commits a crime with one, he should get a stiff jail sentence." 
,·,Another argument against allowin~ .People to own a bomb is that at the moment It 1s very expensive to build one. So what your assocation is backing is a program which would allow the middle and upper classes to acquire a bomb while poor people will be left defenseless with just handguns.'' 
''That's pure propaganda put out by the bleeding hearts. In a year or two there will be Saturday Night Hydrogen Bomb Specials costing less than a hundred dollars. It's worth that to protect your family." 
"Would your assocation be willing to permit the registration of bombs by their owners?'' 
"Absolutely not. If we ever go to war the Communists will have a list of everybody in this country who owns the bomb. They could disarm us overnight. The strength of this nation is still in a citizens' army, and our members arc pledged to fight to the last man." 
"Do you plan to use the bomb for hunting?" 
"Only for big game. We're nor going to use it on a rabbit or a duck becallse that would be overkill. But it's a perfect weapon for knocking down an elk or a bear.'' f 
"A recent Gallup survey has indicated that 78 percent of the people polled said they were in favor of banning the hydrogen bomb 1n private hands. What is your response to that?" 
"Our recent survey indicates just the op­posite," he replied. "People favor keeping the bomb out of the hands of criminal elements, and believe that if you carry one around in your pocket you should have a license. But it's nobody's damn business what you do with one at home.'' 
(c) 1979, Los Angeles Times Syndicate 

then shouldn't those respon­sible for the cheerleader selec­tions be more co'lcerned with selecting the best girls for the job and less worried about what pan of the ''community'' they are from? And as far as whether or not a girl from St. Mary's is capable of repre­sentmg Notre Dame on the football field and basketball court; isn't it true that all the female cheerleaders came from St. Mary's before Notre Dame went co-ed? 
With all this in mind, it would seem that the new majority quota is impractical as well as unfair. Ifany quota at all has to exist, the female populations of the two schools are close enough that it should be at least an even 3·3 split. We feel that the ~.D-SMC community is a reality and uo. just an idea. To quote the 1976·77 version of DuLac, "St. Mary's has been an integral part of Notre Dame since 185 5." If those respon­sible for initiating the new majority policy have the same beliefs as we do, then in fairness to all the females within the community, we would suggest that they recon­sider the issue at hand.

Eric Carmen's latest L.P, "Change of Heart," certainly can't be consider­ed a milestone in music business annals, but as the title might suggest, it does represent an apparent new direction for the ex-Raspberrean. 
Carmen's solo career blasted off in 1975, propelled by three straight hit singles culled from his debut album, but he found less success with last year's "Boats Against the Current," a more or less mediocre album whose ballads and faster songs strayed from the formula of its predecessor. 
The Cleveland native's approach in recording his latest release, however, could probably best be summed up as "if thts be pop, then let's make tho most of it.'' As a result, though, you get the distinct impression on several cuts that Carmen is trying way too hard to conform to the present AM market .. a scene heavily influenced by disco recording techniques. The last song on the disc, "Desperate Fools, appears to hint at this pressure. Is· Enc serious or just making up words to match the music when he sings: 
"I've been taking my ltfe one daY AT A TIME' TRYING TO PIECE IT AU TOGETHER· BUT I know in my mind that I'm starting to be what they want me to be and sometimes I wonder what's becoming of me." 
The son~ that most exemplifies this compromtsing effort musically is "Haven't We Come a Long Way," a 
tune that opens sounding a lot like i across sounding like theBeach Boys,

Just remember, the darlcies can't hold outmuchlonger. They'll soon be fading fast. One by one they will cross ranks; traitors to their Coppertone Cause. A white victory is inevitable! 
Shortly, we will all be one again; marching proudly forward. One great colorless community! 
goofy." 
The miscomprehension of the masses failed to dissuade this man with a dream, this man with a vision. Unceasingly he journeyed through the vast, untamed frontier of the western United States. Many and varied were his means of transportation. Hopping a freight train in the stockyards of Kansas City ... hitch­ing a ride along the dusty plains of Oklahoma ... hiking through the moun­tains of Colorado ... rapelling down the canyons of Arizona ... going Greyhound to points far west--far west of where no intelligent being had ever ventured before. Yes, even to the wild, untamed boom town of Los Angeles. In fact, so determined was this intrepid voyager to deliver his amazing message to an unknowing, unsuspecting public, that he once dared to ride the efevated trains of Chicago. 
Desptte these unsinkable efforts, the poor professor only encountered rebuff and denial. Quite often, so infuriated would be the proprietors of the public drinking establishments where Einstein endeavored to expound his proclamation 
Elton John, and sorta just pops along simplemindedly to a beat that would make for a good discoteque dancing selection --and that's about all. 
Ironically, musicianship isn't at fault ·-in fact it couldn't have been much better with such notables as Burton Cummings (late of the Guess Who), Nigel Olsson, Jeff and Mike Porcaro, both of Toto, and Samantha Sang all sitting in on the recording sessions. 
Once you settle in, though, and accept the album for what it is -­mostly pop --you begin to realize that Carmen stiJJ has that flair for putting together some pretty catchy songs that, although they might not be so musically redeeming, are at least fun to listen to. The tide cut, his current single drawn from the first side, and its followup, "Hey Deanie," covered unfortunately last year by Shaun Cassidy, are points in fact of this ability. 
The two weakest songs on the album are "End of the World," a hyped -up ballad that offers only a bonng. and repititious chorus, and an offbeat performance of an old Four Tops' hit from '64, "Baby I Need Your Lovin"' to close the first side. Ironically, the latter is the song that is currently getting the most AM airplay. 
Followin~ a tradition begun with "My Girl' on his first album and "She Did It" on "Boats," Carmen includes a track that more than remotely comes that they would rudely escort his bodily presence from the inappropriate confrnes. The presence of a pitiful­looking foreigner endlessly spoutmg his theories ofspecial relativity and gravita­tional dynamics were just not good for business. 
Neither could Einstein frnd a sympathe­tic audience on the basketball courts of the nation;poor Albert did not realize that in this country, the term "Gymnas­ium'' did not mean ''secondary school,'' as it did in Europe. One of Einstein's typical attempts to impose order on a seemingly chaotic universe ended in an unfortunate, debilitating brawl, after which Albert was never again able to comb his hair. 
At long last, Lady Luck found the weatherbeaten genius. In a hurry to catch the last Greyhound bus to Wyoming, Einstein unwittingly took one too many turns around a revolving door, and wound up by mistake on the bus to Princeton, New Jersey. Upon disembar­king the vehicle, Einstein immediately walked into a wall. Luckily, nearby sat the Dean of the Colle e of Science of

"Someday." Besides its obvious roots, this moderate rocker impresses you for its lack of clutter ·-a trait that plagues some of the other so'ngs. 
Carmen, although he has the ability to rock as well as the next guy, (remember "Go All the Way?") scores best on this release with two ballads, mostly because of their straight­forward, technically unadorned format. The first is ''Desparate Fools," Carmen's previously mention­ed commentary on life in L.A. ·-a real classic that features Eric on piano accompanied only by a harmonica and a restrained string arrangement.

Princeton University. Noting the odd behavior and unkempt appearance-· polarized h"lir, baggy pants, tattered old raincoat with the fuzzy pudding in the left pocket·of this peculiar crearure, the Dean naturally mistook him as Prince­ton's newly-hired professor--who was actually a shon, balding Norwegian from a small Catholic college in the midv.t:St, and was due in on the next bus. 
Dumb-founded but quick-thinking, Einstein accepted the post of colle~e proft"SSSr, and agreed to speak that night at the annual Science banquet. It was there, ofcourse, that Einstein presented his theory of relativity before an appre­ciative audience for the ftrst rime. Knowledgeable reporters from The New York Times were present; the man's true identity and origin were revealed; and the rest, more or less, is history. 
Hut what about the ch':mistry professor 
from whom the new position was meant? Outraged upon frnding no one to meet him at the Princeton bus station, young Knute Rockne returned to his beloved Notre Dame and decided to coach the football team. But that's another story.

Em.m.et Kelly dies hum.bly at 80 

SARASOTA  Fla. (AP) Emmet Kelly, whose sadsack clown "Wearx Willie" delighted aud­iences for half a century, dies humbly yesterday, befittmg the soulful character he created. 
Kelly, who was 80, was wearing pajamas and carrying garbage to the front of his home m this Florida circus town when he collapsed of an apparent heart attack. 
"It was sudden, and peace­ful,"said Dr. Bob Windom, Kelly's physician. "He just collapsed and fell over. It would have been the way he wanted to go. He would not have wanted to be restricted." 
Kelly's wife, Evi, tried to revive him, but Kelly was prounced dead at Sarasota Hos­pital. The two had been together since they met be­

Evi Kelly spoke fondly of the dual character she'd lived with. "To him, Willie existed,"Mrs. Kelly said. "Willie was ano­ther person. He lived with him so long. The suit still hangs in its own closet. Nobody could fill his shoes. No way, Weary Willies, I guess, now will retire." 
Kelly, who took his droopy­eyed character from the halls of burlesque to the palaces of kings, shunned the spotlight in his private life. He hated crowas and made no secret of

Kelly created Willie out of chalk dust and pathos. He brought him in pantomime from the drawing board through vaudeville, the Ringling Bro­thers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, trade shows, movies, plays, ice shows, television, sports arenas, to command

Fouchard said the reading indicate "There's a hell of a lot of radiation in the reactor building." ) ack Herbein, vice president for generation at Metropolitan Edison, one of the consortium of utilities that runs the facility near Harrrisburg, Pa., said all workers present at the plant at the time of the accident were being examined. The plant employs 500 workers. "Some may have been con­taminated,'' Herbein said before Fouchard's announce­ment. "It's nothing we can't take care of.'' ''Nothing critical failed, but it's a dirry problem. It's going to take some time to clean up,'' he added. Officals said their readings indicated there was no im­mediate danger to the public, and there were no plans to evacuate the 15,000 people living within a mile of the plant.f Bob Fries, a member of the Department of Energy's emer­gency response team, said a specially equipped helicopter monitored small amounts of radiation 16 miles from the site. The highest concentration of radiation was registered at the nuclear plant site, where offi­cials measures 70 millrems of radioactiviry. A chest X-ray can give a person up to 30 millrems. "They are high but not yet critical ... It was not close to a catastrophe," said James Higgins, an NRC reactor in­spector. He said the reactor was safe. Higgins said the radiation was still coming from an auxiliary building, which contains ion­ized water divened there after the accident. The auxiliary building was being ventilated last night. Other radiation was releasead earlier when plant officials intentionally sent steam into the air--not knowing it was contaminated, he said. The NRC investigators said the reactor was still cooling down, and there were no plans to enter it for several days. They said there would ~e a full investigation of the accident.

the proper precautions were taken.'' 
Earlier, Edson Case, a NRC spokesman, said radiation le­vels inside the plant registered at 1 ,000 times normal. 
Case said NRC staff members and plant officials were inside the power plant control room. At one pont, he said, the workers were forced tempo­rarily to don face masks be­cause radioactive materials leaked into the room. 
The problem facing techni­cians was to reduce the temper­ature and pressure inside the reactor dome, and to stop the leakage of radioactive gases. 
Case said heat-caused pres­sure inside the dome had risen temporarily to four or five pounds per square inch about outside atmospheric pressure-­enough the cause leakage. the leaking gases may have in­cluded radioactive gases such as iodine and xenon, he said, but the pressure was not high enough to cause heavy fuels such as uranium or plutonium to leak. 
Sen. Gary Han, D-Colo., chairman of the Senate subcom­mittee on nuclear regulation, said human error appeared to have been a factor in the accident. 
''I am informed (by the NRC) that the emergency core cooling system has turned off prema­turely--resulting in a panial blockage of water needed to cool the nuclear core and keep it under control," he said. 

''Some human error seems to have been involved in respon­ding to the emergency situ­ation," he said, adding the NRC had told him radiation levels outside the plant did not pose a health hazard. 
A nuclear engineer for the state Department of Environ­mental Resources, William Dornsife, said the core had become over heated during the early-morning incident.

Tonight's recital is open to the public. 
Before the Indiana vote, the National Taxpayers' Union, which supports a balanced­budget amendment, said 28 states already have passed such ,resolutions. However, that includes Nevada, where the governor vetoes the · legisla­ture's action in 1977. 
Indiana, which passed a simi­lar resolution in 1957 only to have it declared invalid becuse of technical flaws, is the seventh state this year to call for a convention, which would be the first since the one that drafted the Constitution in 1787. 
The other states were Arkan­sas, Idaho, Iowa, North Caro­lina, South Dakota and Utah. 
Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., who has proposed a balanced-budget amendment in Congress, hailed the Indiana action. 
''This is welcome news to all Americans,'' the freshman senator said in a statement released by his Washington office. ''The Congress has made it clear that it will never adopt a balanced budget amendment unless it is compel­led to do so by the states and the American people. The nation is pleading for effetive action against inflation, but as far as most of my colleagues are concerned, it is still business as usual. We need the pressure of the state petitions to force the 

balanced budget issue. 
''The leadership of the Indi­ana General Assemby proved that state legislatures cannot be scared off by threats of cuts in federal aid," Lugar added. 
Freshman state Rep. Maurice E. Doll Jr., D-Vin­cennes, said he favored a balanced budget but feared a constitutional convention. Doll, who unsuccessfully proposed an amendment last week to limit the scope of a convention, aid the resolution was akin to "sending a blank check."

Court hears reverse discritnination case 
WASHINGTON (AP) Two questions from the bench yes­terday put into sharp focus a Supreme, , Court case that may chart future efforts to eliminate discrimination against minori­ties and women to the nation's job market. "On its face, isn't this a dis­crimination against white per­sons?'' asked Justice Potter Stewart. · 
"Isn't the issue here whether the 1964 law (passed by Con­gress) prohibits you from doing this?" asked Justice William J. Brennan Jr. 
The answer to both inquiries was ''Yes.'' 
The high court was asked questions and heard arguments for 90 minutes yesterday in the case of Brian F. Weber, a 32-year-old lab worker at Kai­ser Aluminum and Chemical Co.'s Gramercy, La. plant. 
Weber, who is white, charged his employer with ra­cial discrimination in a 1974 lawsuit on behalf of all whites at the Gramercy plant after he was shot out of a training program for higher paying, sktlled Jobs. 
The program was provided for in a contract between Kaiser and the United Steelworkers Union. It specified that one black applicant be accepted for every white applicant accepted, even though whites generally had more seniority than blacks. 
At the time, only two percent of the plant's skilled jobs were held by black employees even 
though  blacks  comprised  39  
percent  of  the  plant's  work  
force.

that such a racial quota violated a portion of the 1964 Civil Rights Act banning discrimina­tion in employment because of ra~e,. sex, rleigion or national ongtn. 
Blacks with less seniority than Weber were accepted for the program ahead ofh1m. Had senwrity been the sole basis for participation, few blacks would have qualified. 
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in invalidating the program, r~led that su~h affir­mauve acnon remedies are illegal unless past racial bias by an employer is proven or admit­ted. 
Civil Rights leaders claim the loss of such ''voluntary'' affir­mative action could jeopardize efforts of the past fifteen years to improve job opportunities for minorities and women -often at the expense of white men.

Kuhn says 
­
umptres are 'off base' in salary demands 
DAllAS (AP) Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn said yesterday that dissident major league umpires ''were off base" in their contract de­mands, and warned "contin­gency plans are ready'' for the opening of the season next week. 
"I hope these decent men see the error of their ways," said Kuhn. "We (major league owners) have plans for an alternate approach. The um­pires would be making a serious mistake if they do not show upfor work.'' 

cotted spring training. Substi­tute umpires have called the exhibition games in Florida and Arizona. 
A federal judge ruled Tuesday that he had no authority to order umpires to go to work, saying ''There is no question in my mind they are entitled to bargain as individuals." 
The umpires want more mo­ney and other improvements in a collective bargaining agree­ment fashioned last year. They are in the second year of a. five-year agreement. 
''It is unfortunate that we have the problem we have, but in this case they (the umpires) are way off base. What they are doing is wrong," said Kuhn. 
Kuhn was on a National Association of Broadcasters sports panel with National Foot­ball League Commissioner Pete Rozelle, National Basketball Association Commissioner Larry O'Brien, and Roone Ar­ledge of ABC News and Sports. 
On another topic, Kuhn, O'Brien, and Rozelle agreed that there was a danger of oy~rexposing sports on tele­vlslon. 
"It's now beginning to con­cern us a lot," said Kuhn. "We are not yet in a saturation situation, but it could become dangerous," said O'Brien. 
"I don't think we have reached it (overexposure) yet but we have to be aware it could happen," said Rozelle. 

Asked about upcoming changes in the NBA, O'Brien said "It is very conceivable" that the three-point play will be adopted next year. 
"There will be an intense discussion by our rules commit­tee in several weeks," he added. 
The three commissioners agreed that video tape replays were virtually useless as offi­cial's aid because of the incon­sistency of angles. Rozelle pointed out that all 28 NFL teams concluded recently that the replays were not feasible. 
''PerhaJ?S technology in the future wtll make it · possible,'' said Rozelle.

U.S. trade deficit declines 
WASHINGTON (AP) -­Helped by a sharp decline in oil imports, the U.S. trade deficit declined to a 21-month low of $1.3 billion in February, less than half the previous month's deficit, thegovernmentreported yesterday. 
The improved trade picture was likely to give new support to the dollar, which has been recovering in recent months from the battering it received during the past two years on the foreign exchange markets. 
The biggest 1mprovement in February was a substantial 17.5 percent decline in the value of tmported oil to $3.29 billion, the lowest in six months, the Com­merce Department said. The 
· volume of petroleum products was down nearly 19 percent to 238 million barrels. Government trade analysts say they expect the trade deficit to dechne to $22.5 billion this year. While that still is a huge amount, it would be a welcome improvement over the record deficit last year of $28.4 billion. The trade deficit declined to $1. 3 billion last month from $3.1 billion in January. Total U.S. exports in February increased 2. 9 percent to a record $13. 5 billion, while im­J?Orts declined 8.8 percent to $14.8 billion. The major improvement on the export s1de was a 3.6 percent increase in manufactured goods to a total of just under $9.1 billion.

NEW YORK (AP) · The NCAA basketball tournament between Michigan State and Indiana State drew a record rating for a college basketball chamJ?ionship 8ame, according to Ntelsen f1gure released yesterday. 
The Monday night game, matcing All-Americans Larry Bird of Indiana State and Earvin ] ohnson of Michigan State, received a 24-1 rating, meaning nearly one-quarter of all the· sets in America were tuned into the game. The game got a 38 share, meaning 38 percent of the sets on during the time period were watching Michigan State beat win the national title 75-64. 
The previously highest rated champwnship game was UCLA coach John Wooden's farewell performance in 1975 when the Bruins beat Kentucky. That game got a. 21 . 3 rating and 3 3 share. 

Last year's championship game between Kentucky and Duke received 19.9 rating and a 31 share.

center stage, a virtuoso who craves the attention and adulation of the multitudes. 
While the Hunters, Nettles', Chambliss', etc., seem at ease with their roles as steady contributors to the cause, the sudden acclaim heaped on Bucky Dent after his post-season heroics, followed by a part in a ridiculous television movie with the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders, is cause to wonder if its all coming too quickly to the ex-Chisox; if we are to believe rumors of marital problems with wife Stormy, it's possible the pressure may take its toll on last year's Series MVP. 
Perhaps it takes a special man, someone who has won over 80 percent of his major league decisons, to keep his head while most people about him have already lost their's. Ron Guidry, whose slender frame hardly makes him appear as if he could strike terror in the hearts of menancing batsmen, carries himself in a way that reflects his confindence as well as the dignity and respect that he has inspired. Like most of his teammates, he has divorced himself from the controversy to concentrate on his specialty. 
' 1 All I needed was a chance to show what I could do," Lightnin~ relates. "When it came along, I did the JOb and moved into the rotation.'' The Cajun dismisses his pre-season probl'ems to experimenting with a change-up, and the fact that "I always start slowly m Florida. But I' II be ready when the season begins." And, so will the hordes of writers, cameras and announcers, to record every move made by the "best team money can buy"··the amazing World Champion Yankees.

Piane, Irish tracksters anxious for outdoors 
by Mark Perry Sports Editor 
Having just completed a spring conditioning trip in Alabama, the Notre Dame track team ooens their outdoor season this Saturday, as it hosts six teams in the Notre Dame Open at Cartier Field. Field events and prelims begin at 11:30 and the running events start at 1 _p.m. 
Competmg a~ainst the Irish in this non-sconn~ meet will be Valparaiso, Aqumas College, Southwestern Michigan, Jackson Community College, University of Chicago, and the Chicago Track Club. 
This meet will be the first for Notre Dame contested on its brand new all-weather track, which was installed at Cartier Field last fall. 
''Since this will be a non­scoring meet, we will be exper­imenting in some events," said Irish Head Coach Joe Piane. "We are going to move a lot of guys around, running them in events they normally don't compete in." 
Some of the best runners in the meet should come from the Chicago Track Club, including Mike Durkin, who competed for 
Sportswriters take heed 
All students interested in writing sports for The Observer are encouraged to attend an 8

the United States in the 1976 
Olympics, and Stan Vinson, 
who has been one of the top 
quartermilers over the past six 
or seven years and will be 
competing in the intermediate 
hurdles. 
The meet will begin what Piane and the team hope will be one of their best seasons ever. "We are looking for continued improvement,'' Piane said. "We especially hope to im­prove our sprint crew. Our sprinters looked better indoors, and we hope they can continue that trend outdoors." 
Piane pointed out five big meets whtch will be the keys to Notre Dame's success out­doors. "We have five big weekends in a row, competing in the Arkansas State Invita­tional, the Illini Classic, the Kansas Relays, the Drake Relays, and the Penn Relays," the Irish coach said. 
In addition to those meets, Notre Dame will also compete in the IC4A Championships in Philadelphia and will host the Central Collegiate Conference meet on May 24-26. The Irish also hope to qualify some runners for the NCAA Cham­pionships, to be held on May 31 and June 1 and 2. 
Piane also noted some areas where the Irish should be strong this year. "Arnie Gough is capable of running the high hurdles in under 14 seconds, our mile relay should be good, and our middle distance crew is extremely strong." 
Freshman Jacques Eady highlighted · the trip to Alabama, as he won the triple jump and 200 meter run, and placed in two other events against Troy State. Tr~ won the meet by four poin~s, "and they were really. pumped up for Notre.D?_~~.-because they set a lc ."''of school records in the meet,'' Piane added.

The University of Michigan seems to have Notre Dame's number this year. The Irish tennis team joined the football 
Bronx Bombers in spotlight 
The touring New York Yankee caravan was a smash success during their one-night stand at AI Lang Theater in St. Petersburg. Playing the role of big-city slickers, as opposed to their poverty-stricken country cousins, the Flushing Mets, to perfection, they entertained a standing room only crowd, not only during the. main performance, but both before and after the event. The magnetic aura of Bob Lemon's troupe is due more to the stunning and varied personalities of its members than the fact that they are the best atwhatthey do. 
The Yankees are definitely the prototype of the modern era of baseball. It is a team that has rejected the traditional do~ma of how to field a winner: the J?,atient nurtunng of its investments (players) unul their maturation, from the abyss of the Piedmont Lea~ue on up to the big time. Instead, George Stembrenner has created his monster by buying or dealing for used but dependable and sturdy parts from his rivals. 
But, while compiling a roster of many of the game's brightest luminaries, on close inspection New York does not resemble a 25-man squad with a strong identity. There is none of the banter or risque story-telling seen in other clubhouses on this team; basically, they are high-salaried employees driven by a fierce pride in nothing more than themselves and their own abilities that makes this team the newest dynasty. 
Everywhere these pinstripers go they attract attention and create excitement. On thts dav, a camera crew from "Saturday Night Live" waits impatiently for the arrival of Bill Murray to

begin filming a short se~ment for an upcoming show. Murray, outfitted m a white fedora, a red and white-checked sportscoat, and a pair of droopy slacks, is being detained at the press gate by a 70-year-old usher who demands to see his credentials. When a Northern journalist intervenes, explaining who Murray is., the usher claims not to recognize him because he has only been at his job three days. 
When Murray finally gets on the field, he introduces Chico Escuela, a 41-year-old second baseman who is attempting a comeback with the Mets. One sign greets him by e:xclaiming, "Parsifpanny, New Jersey, Loves Chico", and cries o "Chico, Chico" resound from Al Lang's rafters as the ancient Escuela, who bears a striking resemblance to Garrett Morris of the "Not Ready For Prime Time Players", circles the field. 
It is difficult to maintain one's perspective when they are consistently in the spotlight accorded this show of shows. Jackson, whose annual explosion with the bat is a more reliable harbinger of autumn than the colorful New England foliage, is unquestionably the star performer, a sultan who relishes, nay, demands

Irish women anticipate title bouts 
by Beth Huffman ­Women's Sports Editor 
The name Notre Dame has become synonymous with na­tional recognition in athletic competition. A new group can add its mark to the ranks of successful Irish teams when the women's foil squad of the fencing team competes at the NIWF A championships on April 5, 6, and 7. 
. S~nior captain Karen Lacity, 
JUntors Dodee Carney and Liz Bathon, and freshman Marcella Lansford compose the squad that qualified for the finals by finishing in a tie for first place with Ohio State at the Great Lakes Tournament held on March 10 at Michigan­Dearborn. Wayne State will also compete in. the champion­ships as the top three teams in the tourney qualified for the finals. 
The four foilists who com­piled a 14-3. season record en route to qualifyin~ for the NIWFA championshtps, will be accompanied by their coach, Mike Sullivan. Sullivan, an All-American in sabre competi­tion, is not a new face to fencing crowds; however, it will be the first time Sullivan has coached in such a major event. The squad is rather unsure of exactly the expertise of its

T;f'olverines shutout Irish netters 
and men's basketball teams as 
victims of the Wolverines by 
dropping yesterday's match, 
9·0 at the ACC. 
The match was much closer 
than the score actually indi­
cates. The Irish took the 
powerful Wolverines into three 
sets in four of the nine matches, 
including a surprisingly close 
match in the top doubles compe­
tition. 
The Irish tandem of Mark Hoyer and Carlton Harris, after dropping the ftrst set 4-6, won the tle-breaker in the second set to even the match. But Michigan's All-American combo of Jeff Etterbeek and Matt Horwitch battled back to take the deciding set, 6-3. 
"It's hard to say you've played well when you lose, 9·0," said Irish coach Tom Fallon, now in his 23rd year at the helm, "but I think it's fantastic the way our kids hung in there against these guys. Michigan is the defen­ding Big 10 champion, and they are favored to win it again this year. And the Big 10 is as tough in tennis as it is in basketball.'' 
Michigan's conference domi­nation is no coincidence. Top-seeded Etterbeek is cur­rently ranked ftfth in the nation among college players in sin­gles. Freshman teammate Michael Leach is ranked 19th nationally, and was a member of the National Junior Davis Cup team last year. 
The number one singles match proved to be the most exciting of the day. Notre Dame's Hoyer stunned the All-Ameri­can Etterbeek, winning the ftrst set, 6-4. But the Michigan senior came right back to win the second, 6-3, and the third, 6-2. 

The underdog Hoyer managed to hold his serve for the first two games of the third and final set but faltered on his third service and eventually lost the decisive set. 
In the other three set matches, Irish senior captain Mark True­blood fell to Jud Shaufler, 1-6, 6-3, 1-6, in the number four singles, and number six Tom Robison lost to ] ack Neinken, 6-4, 2-6, 2-6. 
The inclement weather forced the match indoors. As a result, it took over five long hours to complete. · 
The Irish will try to get outside and improve on their 4-6 record this weekend when they host the Badgers of Wisconsin on Sunday at 11:00 a.m. Weather providing, the match will be held at the Courtney Tennis Center. Otherwise, it will be back into the fieldhouse for the Irish netters for another long day of tennis.
