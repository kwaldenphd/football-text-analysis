Dancin' Irish allowed to perform next year 
By MIRIAM HILL Senior Staff Reporter 
The Dancin' Irish will be allowed to perform at basketball games for at least one more year, but have been barred from appearing at football games. 
That was the consensus of the eight­member appeals committee appointed to review a recent decision by the fac­ulty board in control of athletics to dis­band the Dancin' Irish. 
Associate Vice President for Student Services Father Peter Rocca said Thursday that the group will be allowed to perform at basketball games next year "on a trial basis." 
''The question of whether the group should be disbanded will be reviewed by the appeals committee at the end of next year," said Rocca, who chaired the committee. 
The committee decided not to allow the Dancin' Irish to perform at football games because of "confusion over their role" as representatives of Notre Dame, Rocca said. _ 
He said the group often had troubie with their routines at football games because they had to perform to music being played far away from where they were dancing. 
"There was some confusion," Rocca said. "People asked, 'Are they cheer­leaders or are they dancers, and if they're dancers, why don't they have any music?' " he added. 
The committee's decision must be ap­proved by University Executive Vice President Father Edmund Joyce and Vice President for Student Affairs Fa­ther David Tyson. Rocca said he was confident Joyce and Tyson would give their approval. 
The group was disbanded Jan. 20 after the faculty board voted to allow only the cheerleaders and the marching band to represent the University, ac­cording to Director of Athletics Gene Corrigan. The board had received let­
ters complaining that the Dancin' Irish 
''were more bothersome than helpful,'' 
said Corrigan, a member of the board. 
In addition to banning the group from football games, the committee made several other recommendations. Cor­rigan will appoint an adviser to act as a liaison between the Dancin' Irish and the athletic department. 
The adviser will schedule court times at _the ACC for the Dancin' Irish and arrange performances and practices. Dancin' Irish co-captains had previ­ously taken care of such responsibili­ties. 
The present and newly elected co­captains of the Dancin' Irish will choose an additional adviser to help the group choreograph routines. The advice of a choreographer will ''ensure the quality" of the group's performance, Rocca said. 
In another effort to improve the group's performance, the committee recommended "that the sound system (in the ACC) be adjusted to provide ade­quate, audible background music, be­cause at present the system is not suf­ficient," Rocca said. 
Both Rocca and members of the Dan­cin' Irish said they were pleased with the committee's decision. "What may have seemed like a negative decision from the faculty board in control of ath­letics . . . in the long run will only strengthen the performance of the Dan­cin' Irish," Rocca said. 
Dancin' Irish team member Kristine Kruczek said the committee's decision was "a lot more positive than what we had seen before." 
The Dancin' Irish are a group of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's women who provide halftime entertainment at many men's basketball games. They specialize in dance routines to popular tunes. 
The group has club status and operates under the guidance of the Of­fice of Student Activities. 
ND psych prof explains 'stress innoculation' in recent study 

By TERRI DEMPSEY and REGIS COCCIA News Staff 
Training to deal with stress has been linked to lower levels of pain after surgery according to a study recently completed by George Howard, chairman and associate professor of psychology at Notre Dame, and doctoral candidate Judith Wells. 
Their findings were reported in the December 1986 issue of "Journal of 
Consulting  and  Clinical  Psychol­ 
ogy."  
Patients  scheduled  for  elective  

surgery with an expected recovery time of three or more days were se­lected to participate in the study and randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. The treatment patients received "stress innocula­tion" to learn how to monitor their reactions through deep breathing, muscle relaxation, and thoughts of pleasant, soothing images. 
"The mind definitely has a tre­mendous influence on the body in healing and recovery,'' Howard said. "(The treatment is) a stress innoculation procedure preparatory to surgery. It's a way to deal with stress and anxiety so that (patients) can help their bodies get on with healing,'' he said. 
Each patient's recovery rate was analyzed by the degree of pain ex­perienced throughout recovery, the amount of pain medication re­quested during recovery time, length of hospital stay, and the pa­tient's cooperativeness with hospital nurses. (The nurses were unaware of which patients had received stress innoculation.) 
Of the 24 patients participating in the study, aged 14 to 62, those who had received stress innoculation ex­perienced significantly less pain and stress after their operation. 
"We knew it was going to be help­ful," Howard said, "but we didn't know how dramatically cost effec­tive it was going to be. Just on the real obvious quantifiable aspects of

The vacancy in the Office of the Dean left by former Dean of the College of Engineering Roger Schmitz has resulted in the establishment of a com­mittee to elect a successor to the post. 
Schmitz left his position at the begin­ning of the semester to serve as vice president and associate provost of the University. 
Provost Timothy O'Meara said the rules for the entire selection process are outlined in the Academic Articles of the Faculty Handbook. One of these rules names the provost, in this case O'Meara, as the chairman of a six­member committee for the sole pur­pose of choosing a new de~n. . . 
O'Meara said the committee Itself IS elected by the College Council of the college in which the vacancy of dean­ship appears. The committee consists of five College of Engineering faculty members who are either full or associ­ate professors, and one engineering stu­dent.

...· .,,.:.-··..:~~ 

Serving on this committee are David Cohn, professor of electrical engineer­. ing; William Gray, chairman and pr?­fessor of civil engineering; Albert Mll­ler, professor of materials science and engineering; Thomas Mueller, director for engineering research and graduate studies and professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering; Arvind Varma, chairman and professor of chemical engineering; and Notre Dame junior John Bienko, a mechanical engineering major. 
The search for a new dean may take a very long time, according to O'Meara. "A year should be the ex­pected time," he said, but added that the process could last from six months to two years. In the interim, Associate Dean James Taylor will serve as acting dean of the college. 
''Finding a good dean is usually a very difficult task," said O'Meara. He said there are many types of criteria used, and the committee tries to put

What if? ND students turn tablesOnc~outh.~Qebd police
The following didn't happen ... but if could have .. ___;___...,._;..;_____________ 
At about midnight on a certain weekend, two men walked towards a house. One wore a Notre Dame jacket, the other a striped sweater. They Naughton 

were cops; South Bend cops; South Bend plainclothes cops. 
They were the best trained, the bravest, the finest of South Bend's finest; you might say that they were the finestest. 
And they were on a mission. They were the point men, the scouts, for a small army of law enforcement agents who were lying in wait just a few blocks away for a signal that these men had found what they were looking for --un­derage drinkers. 
Yes, theirs was a thankless and dangerous lot. For their duty of locating Notre Dame off­campus student parties, infiltrating them, and determining if minors were consuming alcohol was one that had to be performed alone: no uniforms, no nightsticks, no dogs. 
As the two officers of the peace approached the house their pulses quickened when they heard the distinctive sounds of a large party: loud music, primal screams, and ancient furni­ture being broken. 
One of the officers pressed his nose against a cracked window to confirm that there was, indeed, a party in progress; visions of citations and divine justice danced in his head when he spotted several partygoers who were clearly under-age. 
Now the two faced the last, and greatest hurdle; they had to gain entrance to the party in order to confirm that minors were, in fact, drinking. In the past, this had been a relatively easy task, but since the recent raids the depart­ment had been receiving reports that students were becoming more wary about who joined their social gatherings. 
The two officers conferred outside of the house and decided to gain entry one at a time so as to be less conspicuous. The first, who looked younger, went around to the front door and opened it. He was about to step into the party when an arm shot out from behind the door and blocked his way. The undercover cop turned in surprise and immediately beheld a rather large young man who was sitting on a stool next to the door. 
"Let's see some I.D." said the student. 
"I.D.?" asked the cop. 
"Ya, can't you read?" replied the stu­dentlbouncer as he pointed to a large sign next to the door. Printed on it in bold black letters was the following, "YOU MUST PRESENT A VALID NOTRE DAME OR SAINT MARY'S 
I.D. AT THE DOOR. NO MAJORS (ANYONE OVER 22 YEARS OF AGE) WILL BE SERVED."

"So let's see some I.D." said the obviously exasperated student for the second time. 
"Oht ummm . .l left it in my car." mumbled the cop and walked back to the side of the build­ing where his partner was waiting in the shadows. "What happened?" asked the second cop. "I got rejected at the door." muttered the first. 
'You got carded? I don't believe it!" "I know, neither can I. What are we going to do?" "Wait, I have an idea, I have my younger brother's I. D. I'll pretend it's mine." 
And with that brilliant thought, the second cop walked to the door of the house where he too was confronted by the student-bouncer; he boldly handed over his fake I.D. 
The student-bouncer took it out of its holder, held the I.D. up to the light, rubbed the date to see if it would smear, and then looked at the information on the back. "What's your sign?" he demanded. The cop's mind reeled; what was his brother's sign? He had no idea. He had memorized the birthdate, but now he couldn't remember whether someone born in April was a Cancer or a Gemini. As he pondered, he could see the student-bouncer's eyes narrow. Finally, out of sheer desperation, he shrieked "Cancer! I'm a Cancer! ! " The student-bouncer sighed, "you know you're lucky that I don't take this away from you. Now get out of here before I run you in." With a look of dejection and drooping shoulders, the cop found his partner. The two trudged back to their car. 
"What are we going to do now?" 
"I don't know. Let's hit the bars."

The Saint Mary's art depart­ment will offer its 13th annual Redbud Summer Workshop May 18-30 at the Redbud Trail Camp near Buchanan, Mich. 
The program is open to anyone 18 years of age or older. Participants can earn three credits, transferable to many institutions, in either printmaking, drawing and painting, raku ceramics and sculpture, photography or field biology. 
"It is not limited to art majors, nor is it limited to people who already attend Saint Mary's or Notre Dame," explained Bill Sandusky, assis­tant professor of art and coord­inator of Moreau art gallery at Saint Mary's. 
The past few years, there has been an average of about 25 stu­dents attendinE! the workshop.

It offers students and faculty a chance to live and work to­gether in close harmony with nature. 
"Itwas a great 'hands-on' ex­perience,'' said Hope Abbott, a Saint Mary's nursing major and 1986 Redbud participant. 
According to Sister Cecelia Kelly, a professor of art at Saint Mary's, the program develops a deeper awareness in students outside in a natural environment than what is nor­mally obtained in a studio sit­uation. 
"You live, eat and sleep art," said Ann Laverty, a Saint Mary's sophomore and partic­ipant in the 1986 program. "It was hard work, but a fun expe­rience." 
Redbud can be beneficial if you need to get away from things, Sandusky said. It's a chance to get totally involved in a particular subject without distractions, she said.

HAMILTON, Ohio -A fair­John Fryman, 24, said in an field man accused of killing a interview from the Butler Cincinnati woman, cutting off County Jail "extenuating cir­her legs and discarding them cumstances'' led to the death in an Indiana churchyard, now of Monica Lemen, 21, but he says he and his girlfriend were would not elaborate. 

l''ryman's remarks were published Thursday in a copyright story in The Cincin­nati Post. 
"There's a lot of things that haven't been said. There's a lot of things involved that nobody seems to be following up on, and I'm kind of fearful for my family," Fryman said. 
According to an arrest war­rant, Fryman admitted killing Lemen Feb. 10 in his mobile home, where authorities found evidence linking Fryman to satanic worship. Beverly Cox, 20, who lived with Fryman, ad­mitted helping him in the slaying, the warrant said. 
Fryman said that during questioning by police in In­diana after his arrest Feb. 19, he "sat there and refused to talk to them until they jumped in my face and decided they wanted to bruise me up slight­ly.'' 
"Then I just kind of nodded my head to everything they said," Fryman said. 
Fairfield Police Chief Gary Rednour called Fryman's claims a "bunch of baloney." Butler County Prosecutor John Holcomb said a judge will de­termine the legitimacy of the confessions and refused fur­ther comment.

Secondly, the candidate should have good skills in ad­ministration, O'Meara said. He should "preferably (but not necessarily) have demon­strated these skills in another posistion." He should have leadership characteristics, he said.

WORCESTER, Mass. -First, Continental Airlines mis­spelled Worcester in its new timetables. Then it tried to make amends. 
Continental officials decided to give away tickets in apology for printing "Worchester" in its timetables when it began service Feb. 1 between Worcester and Washington. 
Under the plan, the first 100 people showing up at the Worcester Airport ticket counter Wednesday morning and correctly spelling the city's name would get round-trip tick­ets to anywhere Continental flies in the United States. 
Mayor Timothy Cooney and police officials ruled out the giveaway in the interest of public safety. However, the air­line's telephone information service was telling people as late as·7 a.m. they should go to the airport.

One's own capabilities key to solving problems 
Editor's Note: The following is the third in a series of columns from the Univer­sity Counseling Center. 
"No man is an island," "Lean on me," and "You've got a friend," are just a few examples of popular expres­sions conveying a sense that caring for others is a common and natural reac­tion. However, caring can be a lot harder than it seems. Many times when someone we care about is hurting, we feel helpless and uncertain about what might be the best thing to do. Some­times we are so emotionally involved that it becomes difficult to sort out what might or might not be helpful. 
Pamela Nath 
guest column 

Seeing someone you care about in pain can evoke many different feelings. You may feel helpless because it seems like there's no way to change the situa­tion, angry that someone you care about has to experience so much pain, guilty that you are unable to prevent their pain, and anxious about what the outcome will be. The first step in being helpful to others is to spend some time exploring and sorting out these conflict­ing feelings. You may worry that you're being selfish, and feel guilty about focusing on the feelings that you are having when your friend is going through such a difficult time, but lis­tening to your own feelings will make you stronger and better able to under­stand and care for your friend. 
Another reason why its important to be aware of your own feelings is that this awareness will help you to remem­ber that your friend is a separate per­son. Although this sounds simple, it is really a very difficult thing to remem­ber when a person we care about is hurting. It's easier to talk about the in­dependence and autonomy of others that it is to stand back and allow some­one you love to neglect taking care of him or herself in the way you think is best. When we see others who don't seem to be taking care of themselves, our first impulse may be to rush in an try to make things better for them. It may seem that finding solutions for others is a way of caring for them, but deciding for someone else takes away from their power to choose what is best for them. 
A more constructive approach to caring is to begin by focusing on (and helping your friend to see) the

strengths that he or she has available to deal with the problem. Emphasizing the resources that others have inside themselves can help them to walk on their own instead of needing others to carry them, and this will help them to maintain a sense of dignity, self­esteem, and independence. Your friend may want some support while working towards strengthening his or her own resources, and one way to show that you care is to help your friend to locate sources of support in friends, teachers, counselors, priests or others. 
Finally, don't insist on taking the pain away from your friend. It's often diffi­cult for us to recognize the opportunity that is a part of suffering, but experi­encing the feeling and pain within our­selves can help us to learn more about ourselves, grow stronger, and develop a greater sensitivity to, and under­standing of, those around us. Carl Jung, a famous psychologist, once wrote: "If you get rid of the pain before you have answered its questions, you get rid of the self along with it." 
'Emphasizing the resources that others have inside themselves can help them to walk on their own in­stead of needing others to carry them ••.' 
Trying to reassure others that things are better than they seem may con­vince them either that you don't under­stand how they really feel (which may make them feel more alone) or that its not okay to feel how they're feeling (which may make them feel worse about themselves). Another way that we may try to take away the pain of others is by doing our best to lessen or eliminate the hurt that is a natural con­sequence of their behavior. Pain can be a signal that there are changes which we need to make in our lives, and by lessening your friend's pain, you may be eliminating one motivation for him or her to change. This is r~ferred to by counselors who work with al­coholic families as enabling, because by taking away the pain associated with the person's problem-such as an eating disorder, alcoholism, or even irrespon­sibility, you enable them to continue their behavior. The most caring thing to do in this situation is to allow others to experience the natural consequences of their behavior, while at the same time helping them to find the support 
they need to make changes in their lives. 
The most valuable gift that we can give others who are in pain is our un­derstanding and acceptance. Listening to others and trying to understand the situation as they experience it and their feelings as they feel them is the best way to show others that we care. When people feel understood, they feel sup­ported and this support may give them the strength they need to better deal with their problem and their feelings about it.

P.O.BoxQ 
Acceptance should be based on the individual 
Dear Editor: 

Three cheers for Mark McLaughlin! He is so right about people's dress codes in college. However, not only is college a place where there are so many avail­able women and men but it is the last chance to look like a student. How many of us girls will be able to get away with rolling out of bed and going to work? Will guys be allowed to walk around with a five o'clock shadow for five days in the real world? Don Johnson does not a real fashion trend set. 
In the meantime I think we should just accept each other for what we are, people. Underneath the clothes-that's what we all are. 
I also agree with McLaughlin's point about how much easier it is to complain than to do something. Lately I see so many nice guys and girls around me that just sit around moping instead of making a move. Not only should guys take a chance and pick up the phone, but what's wrong with phones in the girl's dorms? Why sit around waiting for a guy to call? Call him! Wow -a real light bulb there! I mean it's not like we're living in Victorian times anymore? Is it? 
Being that Spring fever is about to descend on us all, (if it hasn't already) why don't we hang up fears, get some self confidence (anywhere we can find it) and give that "special" person you've had your eye on a call? Try it ­say the weather has gone to your heads! Say anything! You might even want to try the truth ! I mean we all like to hear that somebody thinks we're special!

One, they have a TV package now during the week, which keeps the recruiting door about the size of the Holland Tunnel -and they get more than their fair share of national hook-ups from the Big Three networks on the weekends. 
Two, because Chicago has become the crown jewel, when it comes to producing blue-chip high school players, passing up the New York-Washington D.C., and the L.A.-San Fran­cisco areas as proving grounds or factories. And Chicago is being pushed by Detroit. Then, too, most of the schools in the Big Ten are THE shcool· in the state, so they pretty much get first pick of the litter when it comes to homegrown players who develop in their areas. 
Finally, I believe the Big Ten will do well at tourney-time, will be more ready for tourna­ment play, because they don't have a post-season conference tournament. They play a solid round-robin, with each home­and-home game being a firecracker, and they play a reasonably tough out-of -conferecne schedule. And, they are -without a doubt -the most physical conference in the country, where it seems that the refs have consistently slow whistles, which allows

to realize that basketball is a

One other thing: Look for the style of play in the Big Ten to change a litte in the near future -from Bobby Knight's motion of. fense and kamikaze defense to Dr. Tom Davis' coast-to-coast defense, multiple substitutions, and a wearing down of the op­ponent with movement rather than physical-ness. 
This trend, I feel, should take about three weeks to work into place -a lot quicker than when Bobby Knight's style changed the Big Ten from a run-and-gun conference to one of deliberate, half -court offense and strong, man-to-man, box-out defense. 
Now it's going to be changing again, because of Tom Davis, and Coach Williams at Ohio State -who was Davis' assistant at Boston College. What you're going to see, in the Big Ten, is . coast-to-coast defense, long benches, massive substitu­tions, all of which are ways of extending the intensity of the game by playing the whole court. 
What you're also going to see is a conference so talent-laden, so solid, that it's going to take the rest of the country at least another season or two to catch up.

Irish look for big finish at Dayton, 
Sports Briefs 
some momentum for tournament 
The ND women's soccer club's blue and yellow 
By PETE GEGEN 
Assistant Sports Editor 
DAYTON, Ohio-With a bid to the NCAAs all but wrapped up, the Irish will be looking to carry momentum into the tournament when they travel to Dayton to face the 13-14 Flyers tomorrow afternoon at 2 (WNDU-TV). 
But Dayton is certain not to make that task easy. Last season the Flyers edged the Irish in Dayton, 67-65, and in January Dayton gave Notre Dame a scare before going the final four minutes without scoring and losing, 66-55. 
"This will be an interesting game for us, especially consid­ering it's Dayton's last home game and the last appearance for their seniors," said Irish 

-head coach Digger Phelps. "I think there's a lot of motivation for both teams because nobody wants to end the regular season by losing. In our case, we'd like to head into the post-season with a positive." Two seniors will be starting for the Flyers. Forward An­thony Grant is both the top scorer and rebounder for Dayton, averaging 12.6 and 6.1 respectively, while guard Dan Christie adds 11.4 points a game and has dished out 133 assists.

Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame hockey team heads into American Col­legiate Hockey Association playoff action this weekend at the ACC. 
The first opponent of the Irish will be the top seed in the tourn­ament, Lake Forest, which swept Notre Dame in a two­game series two weeks ago. The Irish take a 9-18-1 record into the tournament, and the opening face-off with the Foresters is Friday night at 9. 
The winner of that game takes on the winner of the Kent State-Michigan-Dearborn con­test, which gets underway Friday at 6. The losers meet on Saturday afternoon at 5, and the championship game is slated to follow at 8 p.m.

lineup, however, is not as settled. Head Coach Don Donoher has started 12 differ­ent players this season. At for­ward, Donoher will play senior Ed Young (8.1 points, 4.3 rebounds) and freshman An­thony Corbitt (10.1 points, 4.8 rebounds), and the center slot will be filled by sophomore Steve Pittman, who started the game in January, and fresh­man Troy McCracken (5.1 points, 4.3 rebounds). 
In the game at the ACC this season, Dayton rallied back from an 11-point deficit to make the score 57-55 with 4: 03 left in the game. But Notre Dame used free throws, like it has so many times this season, to seal the win. 
The Irish also used strong defense to shut down the Flyers. Christie only scored eight points and had just two assists, and team-leading scorer Grant was held to five points. 
But for the Irish, the game marked the emergence of Gary Voce. The junior center was a perfect six-of-six from the field and added two free-throws for his first double-figure game of the season. Voce also grabbed 12 rebounds. In his last 14 games, Voce has averaged 6.9 points. 
Donaid Royal helped the Irish dominate the inside game, adding 17 points and four rebounds. Stevenson shared high-scorer honors with Royal on the strength of a perfect seven-of-seven from the foul line. 
Stevenson was also the only bright spot the last time Notre Dame visited the University of Dayton Area, scoring a career­high 23 points in the losing cause. 
The Irish will be facing an atmosphere similar to that at Marquette last weekend. The battle of the independents has heated up the rivalry between the schools, and Notre Dame is always a strong incentive for the Dayton fans to go crazy. 

"I'm sure there is nothing they would like better than to finish by beating Notre Dame,'' said Phelps, who holds a 3-6 record at UD Arena. "It'll be a very emotional setting, and I think we've got to go out there and do the same things we did up at Marquette last Saturday. We've got to try to take control early, not let them make any big runs and just play hard for 40 minutes." 
Against the independents, Dayton has lost twice to DePaul, 80-64 and 88-65, and has split with Marquette, win­ning 59-57 and losing 64-57. In their last game Tuesday, the Flyers lost to Western Ken­tucky, 78-72.

Two, Notre Dame Athletic Director Gene Corrigan, a member of the Selection Com­mittee, will be in Indianapolis representing the committee. While he must absent himself from all deliberations concer­ing the Irish, if the school's 
A.D. is at the site, it makes sense to send the school there. Corrigan said Wednesday that he would like to see the Irish play at the Hoosier Dome.

For the Irish and their fans, a trip to Indianapolis would be ideal, but a trip to Salt Lake City may provide an easier road to New Orleans. The only thing the Irish don't want to see as the tournament starts is a team with a hyphen in its name.

Junior tackles new role 
Botham approaches l,OOOth point 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
DAYTON, Ohio -When Notre Dame center Sandy Botham sinks her next shot from the field, she will become the fifth player in the history of Irish women's basketball to reach the 1,000-career point mark. 
Barring a catastrophe, that hoop will come Saturday in the last game of the Notre Dame campaign. 
For the junior from Madison, Wis., however, beating North Star Conference rival Dayton tomorrow afternoon at UD Arena and putting the finishing touches on an incredible turn­around for the Irish this season are goals which rank a little higher up the scale. 
"We're finally starting to work together as a team," says Botham of the 11-15 squad, which has won five-consecutive games after a sluggish start, plagued by two players quitting (Kathy Brommeland and Lavetta Willis), one transfer (Julie Garske) and a pair of season-ending injuries (Lisa Kuhns and Beth Morrison). 
"I think when you're down and out, that's when you've really got to get together. We have a lot more team meetings this year to keep the unity, and I think (Coach Mary DiStanis­lao) has really done a good job in getting us back in stride." 
So has Botham. 
One of two juniors on a team without any seniors (the other is point guard Mary Gavin), Botham has assumed a leader­ship role she did not expect to be faced with at the beginning of the year. But when Willis, the team's captain and lone senior, decided to call it quits only one game into the new season, Botham had some shoes to fill. 
"She is really starting to ma­ture as a true leader in all respects,'' DiStanislao says. "This team really needs Sandy not only for the obvious reasons -the rebounds, the points, the defense -but also for the lead­ership aspects that sometimes you don't see from the stands." 
Botham  is  second  on  the  
team  to  sophomore  Heidi  
B unek  in  both  scoring  and  

rebounding, averaging 12.0 and 
7.1 per game, respectively. She also ranks second to Bunek in the NSC with a field-goal percentage of .561. 
"Mter all of the problems early in the year, I was putting a lot of pressure on myself just in getting the job done," says Botham. "Most of it was scoring pressure. The coaches were saying that the team needed me to score points day­in and day-out, and I was saying it to myself as well. Sometimes when you try too hard, nothing goes right." 
Now that things are going right, Botham's mind has turned to other things besides the team's reliance on her lead­ership. 
For example, now she's thinking about the fact that Notre Dame is only one victory away from taking the momen­tum of a six-game winning streak and a full team of retur­nees into a new season next year. Nobody is looking past the Flyers tomorrow after­noon, mind you, but the prospects for 1987-88 are excit­ing. 
"Going into these last six games, (DiStanislao) told us that you have to look at what a good finish would do for next year," Botham says. "The six games really didn't mean anything as far as champion­ships or post-season play this year, but you have to look at going out winning as a starting point for coming in winning. 
"I don't think we'll forget it. I think it's like the football team beating USC in the last game even though the rest of the season wasn't a great one. We're really pumped to do the same kind of thing." 
When Dayton visited the ACC earlier in the season, Botham scored 15 points and the Irish led throughout most of the con­test, but dropped a 55-54 deci­sion to the Flyers on a late­game Dayton surge. 
Give Notre Dame the advan­tage in the revenge depart­ment. 
"We remember how they came in and stole that one from us," Botham says. "And we also remember coming in here last year in the last game of the regular season and ending on a positive note with a win. This is a really big game for us." 
IRISH ITEMS -Mary Gavin was named the NSC Co-Player of The Week for her perfor­mances in two Irish victories over Marquette and Wisconsin last weekend. Gavin scored 16 points in the two games and ac­counted for 56 more with her 28 assists, including a school­record 17 assists against Mar­quette. Diana Vines of NSC­leading DePaul shared the honors.

l Grace has gone home a loser II just once. Mter failing behind 1-0 on Joey McBride's goal, Grace came alive on the attacking end. Co-captain Mike Marino tied the game when he beat goalie Phil Coughlan with a slapshot from near the face-off circle. Grace took the lead for 
good after Mark Galis scored off Sam Dempsey's beautiful feed from just in front of the goal. Grace also had a power­play chance in the first half but was unable to convert, and had to settle for a 2-1 lead. 
The second period clearly belonged to Grace, as the defending champions stymied the Crime. 
The key goal of the game oc­curred off a face-off in the Crime's end. Sam Dempsey .came up with a rebound from the face-off and shot the puck home from the crease area to make it 3-1. Later, Dave Gullott sealed the Crimes's fate when he redirected teammate John Kirk's shot past Coghlan. Galis capped Grace's fifth un­answered goal after finding the loose puck from a centering pass and putting it between Coghlan's pads for the score. All that remained of the game was the anticipation of the final whistle. 
By game's end, a happy Grace contingent celebrated lts second-consecutive champi­onship season. 
"We played well as a team all season long and we had a great team effort out there tonight," said an elated Jim Rataczak. "0-C played well tonight, but everyone was up for this game. The key to this game was our forechecking and being able to hold our of­fensive end well. Our goalie, Gary Davis, came up with pivo­tal saves as he has done all season. 
By TERRY LYNCH Sports Writer 
Something funny happened on the way to what began as a Miami upset of a very flat Notre Dame team in the first half of last night's game at the ACC. 
Namely, it was a second half. 
But it wasn't any ordinary second half. It was a second half that featured an amazing disappearing act of a 7-1 bas­ketball player named Tito Hor­ford. 
Horford started the game looking like a cross between Patrick Ewing and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, combining his jump hook shot with his huge size advantage over Irish defender Gary Voce to end the first half with 14 points, leading his team to a 25-21 halftime edge. 
But the Irish, propelled by Donald Royal's 20 and David Rivers' 22 points, came alive in the second half to hold Horford to 17 points en route to a 65-49 runaway victory. With the win, the Irish record went to 21-7 heading into the season finale against Dayton tomorrow. 
The Hurricanes dropped to 14-16. 
"Tito's going to be an enfor­cer once he catches on to the college game," said Head Coach Digger Phelps. "In the second half we started putting a little more pressure on the ball and a little more pressure on him. I thought we did a much better job of controlling Tito." 
Miami head coach Bill Foster echoed Phelps' state­ments. 
"Everybody can say what they want to, but he's still learning to play," said Foster. "This is the first year of any real competition he's ever had. 
''As long as you give him a steady diet of the same thing, he gets clicked in and does a pretty good job. If you ~hange

something around, he's got to make a mental adjustment and he doesn't make it as well right now." 
Miami began the game by going almost exclusively to Horford. The Irish were unable to stop Miami's big man on defense. With Horford comfor­tably stashed away under the net in a zone defense, the Irish offense was limited to outside shots. . 
Scott Hicks kept the Irish close in the first half, connect­ing on 4-of-6 shooting for nine points. Hicks connected on his first three-point play of the season. 
"I wanted to shoot that," said Hicks, who dedicated his last home game to his mother, whom he introduced to the crowd after the game. "I have a lot of confidence in it, and luckily it fell." 
Mark Stevenson got Notre Dame going in the decisive second half, hitting two­consecutive shots to tie the game at 25. Mter Horford hit a jump hook to regain the lead, Hicks and Royal took over, combining for a slam at the 
13:35 mark. 
Royal then came up with a steal on the defensive end, and passed to Rivers. Rivers fed Hicks on a breakaway that sent the crowd into a frenzy when it appeared Hicks would get an opportunity for a three-point play. 
But the referees reversed their decision, calling Hicks for an offensive foul. Rivers, pick­ing up on the emotion generated by the play, battled Horford inside for two rebounds and then got a goal­tending call on the big man, who was continually showered with chants of "Tee-to, Tee-to" by the students throughout the game. 
Royal then ran off a string of

With selections coming up, it's time for speculation
ll 
~.,, If you're a college basket~all coach with a tearn which has a marginal won-loss record, now is the time to worry. If you're the travel agent for a very successful team, now is also the time to worry. Why? Sunday afternoon at 5:30, the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee will announce which 64 teams will begin the race to Bourbon Street. If you're a team like Ohio State with a winning but not overwhelmingly so record against the top conference in the country, you have to wonder if the latter fact will be enough to get you invited. On Sunday, look for a lot of teams like Ohio State to earn bids. The reason, of course, is the parity factor. There will be more teams than usual with 10 to 11 losses invited because of conference strength. Look at the Big Ten. Indiana, Purdue, Iowa and Illinois will definitely get bids, while Michigan is probable. In the Big East, Pitt, Geor­getown, St. John's, Syracuse and Providence will be invited. In the ACC, North Carolina <which has gotten the kiss of death by being considered the favorite this year), Clemson, Duke and Virginia will be among the 64 chosen, while Georgia Tech is also on the bubble unless they have a good showing in the ACC Tournament. One conference that might not be included is the Metro. With Memphis State on probation, no other team, including defending-champion Louisville, has a record which warrants a bid. If no one upsets Memphis State in the Metro Tournament no one from the conference will get an invite. 
Also look for a lot of teams that no one has heard of before and that are breaking into national prominence. This includes teams like Southwest Missouri State and New Orleans. Irish head coach Digger Phelps' friends from Little Rock more than likely will be there. 

Dennis Corrigan Sports Editor 
All the conference strength and upsets that are bound to occur in conference tourneys make life difficult for the independents, which is a main argument for Notre Dame joing a league. But as the Irish are on the verge of their third-straight NCAA berth, this argument holds as much water as paperbag. Still only Notre Dame, DePaul and the aforementioned Privateers of New Orleans look to be the only independents in the 64 club. 
So where is everybody going? There are eight first and second-round sites. In the east, the sites are Syracuse, N.Y., and Charlotte, N.C. It's a safe bet that The Orangemen will be at home and North Carolina, sure to be the top seed in this region, will be in Charlotte. 
In the Southeast, the sites are Birmingham, Ala., and Atlanta. The Midwest sites are the Horizon in Chicago and the Hoosier Dome in In­dianapolis. The west sites are Tucson, Ariz., and Salt Lake City. It's safe to say that DePaul will be in Chicago and UNLV will go to Tucson. Beyond that, it's anyone's guess as to where anyone else will play. 
The West Regional is perennially the weakest. For once the number-one seed in the west will be a western school in the form of the Runnin' Rebels. Expect a lot of conference runner-ups from the east to find themselves in Tucson or Salt Lake City. The Selection Committee will also try to sprinkle teams from the same conferences throughout the country to avoid to teams from say the ACC from playing each other until the regional semifinals. 
Because of the situation with two Indiana schools at the top of the charts, only one of them will stay in the Hoosier Dome. Whichever school wins the Big Ten will probably get the top seed in the Southeast Region and the runnerup has a decent shot of being the top seed in the Midwest, despite DePaul. 
OK, so how about the Irish? While Salt Lake City (Phelps' expressed his interest in returning there following his squad's win at Utah) and maybe Charlotte are possibilities, the Hoosier Dome is much more likely for a number of reasons. 
One, ticket sales for the 41,000 seat Hoosier Dome are moving slowly. Two in-state schools, Notre Dame and either Purdue or Indiana, would

pizza scene 
KRIS MURPHY and KEVIN WALSH features writers 
T 
hey got the Call five or six 
weeks ago. It was the Ac­
cent editor of the small "in­
dependent" paper they worked 
for. She was looking for some­
one to review the many pizza 
houses of South Bend. 
"Too nutty for us," they 
replied, "We'll wait till you want 
somebody to review the bars." 
"Does the sum of $40 mean 
anything to you?" she asked 
authoritatively. 
"No," they replied, "Not in 
1987. Not in this town." 
Five weeks and $40 later, 
they were faced with the grim 
prospect of actually having to 
write something to explain 
where all the time and money 
had gone. This is what they 
wrote. 
Chapter One: 
Bruno's Pizza 
or 

The Pope Is Plastic 
Bruno's Pizza has the kind of neo-Catholic, Mafioso Hesburgh atmosphere that could only exist near Notre Dame or in somebody's heart-bum induced ethnic nightmare. It should not be experienced sober and they didn't have any intention of making that mistake. 
They arrived at the peak hour on a Friday night and were offered a menu. Among the entrees were the ever-present Olde Italian Specialty "Small Combination" (of what?), all varieties of pasta including spaghetti, llnguini, fettucini, and DickCavatelli. There was also a wide variety of salads but they were not in the mood to trifle with rabbit food and so they ignored the green, leafy stuff. They finally ordered a small pepperoni pizza from their surly waitress, who they had dubbed by this point "The Pigkicker." 
A short walt later, foutreen inches of steaming American culture sat In front of them, asking to be reviewed. The crust was flaky and thick just like their waitress. The sauce beat the hell out of the Ragu or ketchup they were used to and the toppings were generous. 
The two of them barely 
finished the mislabelled "small" 
pizza. It tasted good with the 
beer, but that was hardly a real 
recommendation since lard on 
a plate tastes good with beer. 
In all seriousness they decided 
that it was a better than 
average pizza and a good bar­
gain for their hard-earned bills. 
They never met Bruno him­self, the inventor of what he calls "original" pizza. As good as Bruno's pizza was it would be stretching it to call it original. Pizza, like peanut but­ter, can only be so original. There was however, an in­credibly life-like bust of the Pope in Bruno's. It was ren­dered in the highest quality plastic and it was almost like meeting his Holiness in person. Later they decided that Bruno's 
was the kind of place where a family could comfortably hold a burping contest and 
they im­agined that many did. Chapter Two: 
Glanetto's 
or 

We Came, We Saw, We Got Carded 
Another great South Bend pizza mecca is Oianetto's. Are you starting to notice a pattern here? They did. Glancing at their beer-soaked assignment sheet they realized that every restaurant they had been sent to review had an "-o" ending. It was too wierd to be a mere coincidence. Then again, it wasn't weird enough to be something important. They decided to mention it in their article anyway. 
Olanetto's most striking aspect Is In fact the bathroom. C'mon admit it, you've been there. Everybody's been there. Everybody's probably there right now. Oianetto's, not the bathroom. Anyway the bath­room gives new, more exact meaning to the old fashioned term "water closet." This Is because it has a sink, a toilet, and It's the size of a very small closet. 
Oianetto's Is a happy place where beer flows freely and the pizza CP...ast has a jolly yellow cast to it. The table cloths are red and white checked just like Grandma's picnic blanket and the walls are red. It's located far down Notre Dame Avenue and because of this, diners have a great view of several bars and Jots of off-campus housing. If the place had any windows you could watch the South Bend police harrassing your friends. Alas, there are no windows in Oianetto's. 
As far as the pizza goes they concluded that Olanetto's was ·~ust plain boring" as pizza experiences go. Too salty. It was mediocre pizza in a mediocre atmosphere. They did have good beer though and a great location. Chapter Three Rocco's Pizza

adio Days, Woody Allen's new fllm, is another at­tempt to capture the activities of an entire family In a kind of filmic novel. He follows multi­ple plot strands as the charac­ters wind through their own lives, and he attempts to weave these into a comprehensible whole. The whole is compre-

hensible, but, unfortunately, Radio Days lacks the depth of character and emotion that made Hannah and Her Sisters work so well. Allen has fallen back on stereotypical charac­ters running through a series of amusing, but ultimately silly vignettes. After such a stunning success as Hannah, Radio Days Is a disappointment. 
One of the problems with the film is that it is really not a narrative, but a series of sketches based on Allen's reminisces of the time when radio, not television, was the center of family home enter­tainment. The whole thing is tied together by Allen's narra­tion, which seems more artifi­cial than the "chapter" divisions of Hannah and Her Sisters or the talking directly at the

ten. This may not be your idea of a good time but the pizza is good. 
Anyway, back to our heroes. The first thing they noticed as they walked in were the portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Rocco. They were well done, with that warm personal feeling only a really excellent photographer could have produced. Rocco's also boasted the familiar red, white and green color scheme that so many of the restaurants they had visited had used. They thought everybody had the same Interior decorator until their waitress pointed out that those were the colors of the Italian flag. Boy did they feel uncultured.

camera in such fllms as Annie Hall and A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy. Allen sounds as if he is telling stories to Mia Far­row's children. The narration is the only thing that ties ap­parently unrelated events to­gether, and it seems forced. 
The young version of Allen's narrator is Joe, played by Seth Green, a boy growing up in Rockaway, New York with a houseful of relatives. Green does a fine job(although he does smile when his father, played by Michael Tucker, is hitting him), as do all the ac­tors, but they are given such silly things to do. Uncle Abe, for instance, played by the rotund Josh Mostel, is always bringing home fish; that is the most distinguishing character­istic Allen gives us for him. That is a fairly shallow charac­ter. Another example is Joe's father(Michael Tucker) who is ashamed of his job as a cab driver, but we never learn why. In one of the more moving moments of the film, Joe fi­nally learns his father's occupa­tion. The adult Joe(AIIen) says, "He seemed ashamed of it. I wasn't. I loved him." Allen is getting at something very spe­cial about family relationships, but he pushes it no farther than this. 
Perhaps the best realized character In the fllm is Aunt Bea, played by Dianne Wiest(Hannah and Her Sisters), who is looking for a husband but Is too critical to ever totally accept any man. Wiest does a fine job, but her character does 
They'd been warned against the pepper pizza and subse­quently they opted for pep­peroni. It was hot and it smelled great. They savored the bouquet, covering their faces with tomato sauce in the process. In the actual tasting Rocco's pizza had the most even sauce to cheese to crust ratio. You figure it out. 
Chapter four: Julio's Pizza 
or 

No Moron, Not Julio Iglesias, 
Julio's Plzzal 
The last stop on their six­week pizza odys&;ey was a filthy little hole called Julio's. They had trouble finding it but a big man named Ed set them on the right path and they finally found the Grall, er, I mean Julio's. The confusion had not been their fault because the people at Julio's had given them cruddy directions. That's how bad they want customers. 
If you're going to Julio's bor­row someone's Amphibious Landing Vehicle and a wet suit. You will need these to navigate the swamp-like parking lot. "Parking lot" is really too nice a word because it's really just a bunch of huge holes filled with muddy water. Huge chunks of randomly placed concrete add a surrealistic bent to the whole scene. 
The Inside of Julio's was 
even worse. It had been con-not seem as full as Holly, the neurotic actress-turned-writer Wiest played in Hannah and Her Sisters. She is not given enough significant things to do 
or significant dialogue. Maybe that is the problem with the whole film: it is too small. In his choice to harp on sen­timental reminisces, Allen has lost his grip on such serious issues as death and God. 
Allen has had lapses before. Stardust Memories, Interiors, and A Midsummer Night's Sex 

structed on the facade of an old '50s type house and thus was not too pleasing to look at from the inside. The most prominent features of the main room were two huge cigarette machines which were covered with ancient magazines, every­thing from National Review to Family Circle. Close examina­tion of this high quality reading material revealed that some magazines dated back to the summer of 198.3. 
Repeated requests for the location of the bathroom were ignored. Finally a guy In a Jimmy Page T -shirt led one of the "reviewers" through the kitchen, down some stairs, past a Chinese woman cutting cheese, and Into a small bath­room cryptically labelled "Under Construction." The bathroom smelled like lingulni. 
They ordered a pizza and five minutes later It came. They paid for It and left that God­forsaken hell of a restraunt. The pizza Itself was con­siderably smaller than a Bruno's of comparable price. It was however, Incredibly good. It was a sauce-lover's pizza and they had to agree, somewhat reluctantly, to the truth of the sign in Julio's that read "If you don't like our food, you must be nuts." It was the best pizza they'd had so far even If the restaurant Itself was cheap and chintzy. 
So the best pizza In town Is at Julio's. Not that they really had any hard and fast criteria for being the best. In fact, they didn't know anything at all about reviewing pizza. They were just in the r1ght place at the right time. It could have been you. Yes It could have been you living out the great American Dream. Pizza for nothing. Beer for free. 
Comedy are Allen's attempts to imitate the styles of Federico Fellini and lngmar Bergman, and were disappointing for their inaccessiblity. But, they 
were serious artistic experi­
ments. Radio Days, on the 
other hand, is a throw-away. A 
piece of self-indulgence that is 
more like a photographed ver­
sion of Allen's stand-up act 
than a serious motion picture. 
Even the presence of his fa­mous buddies cannot salvage the picture. Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts, Danny Aiello, and Jeff Daniels all make guest appear­ances. Mia Farrow stars as Sally White, a cigarette girl turned radio star, whose story has nothing to do with Joe and his family except that Sally was star of Joe's aunt's favorite radio program. The adult Joe tells us the stories about Sally, a rather weak device that looks more like an attempt to get Farrow on screen than to tell an Integrated narrative. 
The most disappointing thing about Allen as a filmmaker is , how little he exploits the visual possibilities of film. He very rarely lets the camera tell us something important. There are exceptions, like the stun­ning beginning of Manhattan, but even that depends on nar­ration. Woody Allen's art is es­
sentially vocal. Perhaps that is why he sentimentalizes over radio. He clearly sets it up in opposition to television, which is the center of family home entertainment now. I suppose he liked radio for the imagina­tion it required, and the music, which fills this film and most of his others. Television, though never explicitly mentioned, clearly cannot compare with radio in Allen's life. Alas, as he says at the close of the film. the voices of the past grow dimmer with every New Year's Eve. 
Radio Days is amusing, and it does have its belly laughs, but ultimately it Is only nostal­gia. Unlike his other nostalgic film Purple Rose of Cairo, which dealt with the serious themes of role-playing, dreams, and the conflict be­tween fiction and reality, Radio Days has nothing to offer but bittersweet memories. It is pleasant entertainment, but disappointing.

VVneedless waste of some real quality celluloid; that just about sums up "Mannequin." . With the exception of an out­standing supporting actor per­formance by Meshach Taylor as Hollywood, and a very innovat­ive preproduction idea, this movie loses in just about every sense of the word. 
Movie review 
Mannequin 
.... (out of four) 

"Mannequin," a Gladden En­tertainmenvrwentieth Century Fox film produced by Art Levin­son and Joseph Farrell, stars Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cat­trail who -WAIT! If I write this review as if it were any other review about a bad film, you may not understand what an atrocity "Mannequin" Is. So, to convey fully the poor quality of this film I am going to write as many things about this film as possible in a sort of a montagelstream of conscious­ness approach to film review writing. Well, here goes. 
McCarthy plays a misfit artist who can't hold down a job but finally gets one and then falls in love with a dummy who in­spires him and then they fall in love, first for a little while, and then forever. That's all I re­member about Andrew. My press release says he's "one of the hottest young male stars in Hollywood today" but it doesn't say anything about him being totally limited as an actor, and I guess that doesn't matter be­cause 14-year-old girls don't know squat about film anyway. 
Cattrall plays Emmy, who's a dummy, but not when Jonat­han is looking, until the end of course, when they fall in love forever; but I guess I shouldn't have told you that because you probably wouldn't have figured that out yourself. Cattrall is probably a good actress, and you'd never know it if you saw 
this film, but fortunately she's 
beautiful so the guys can just 
look at her if they want, and I 
guess the girls can just look at 
Andrew If they want because I 
heard he's cute, but I'm not 
sure he is because I don't like 
guys much. 
Estelle Getty, James Spader, 
G. W. Bally and Stephen Vinovich are all great character actors, but their characters in this film are terrible. That must be because "Mannequin" is Mi­chael Gottlieb's first screenplay­to be produced that is --and the scapegoat for his acting debut. I guess Gottileb really is the bozo I thought he was before I went to his movie. My advice to him is to stick to directing commercials like the ones he made for Coke, AT & T and Xerox. 
As for Taylor, who plays Hollywood: now here's an ac­tor. He has some talent and a character and some lines to match. His performance is real and entertaining. Here's some­one who made me feel like it was worth the $2.75 matinee price I paid for this connection of colored pieces of synthetic garbage, and thank God I went to the matinee and not the fea­ture because then I would have really been ticked off because it would have cost me $4.50. You've probably seen Taylor in a Whitney Houston video or some Coke commercial, prob­ably directed by Gottlieb be­cause I'm sure he cast Taylor on mistake, or maybe you saw Taylor in Paris in a show like I did, or maybe not, but anyway he's been around and you've seen him before and he's a talented actor. 
Well that's all I have to say, so I'm going to step out of this stream of consciousness, which is sort of giving me a head­ache, and make a statement that reeks havoc on this film in 20 words or less. 
Gottlieb's first film, "Manne­quin," failed because, unlike a commercial, a film needs a premise and a motivation that lasts longer than 60 seconds. OK, so I went over by a few words.

We sent a copy of the tape. We know it's illegal but it will be our little secret. Please lis­ten to it and do get back to us. 
Yes, of course, we've sent the lyrics too. They weren't pro­vided so we stayed up all night writing them down. They're nice lyrics. 
Oh, Tipper, we're really ex­cited about this one. Finally, music for our youth. Good, wholesome music. We thank England for a real moral uplift. 
God bless America and you too, The Peters Brothers.

A Sweet Georgia breeze~ Athens, Ga. -Inside/Out 
KEVIN WALSH features writer 
A 
thens, Ga -lnsidetOut is the long-awaited soundtrack to the just as long­awaited film of the same name. To call it a current update on the "scene" in Athens would be a lie, since the newest material 

Records 
Athens, Ga., -Inside/Out 

here is over a year old; to call 
It a respectable sampler of the 
music of a neat place at a spe­
cific time would be closer to 
the truth. 
Of the 16 songs by nine dif­ferent bands represented on the album, the opener and closer are by the Squalls, an unsigned band who play their own version of the slanted Southern pop that has been favored by Let's Active, the dB's and, before that, Alex Chilton for years now. The Squalls aren't mere mimics th The frayed sing-a-long of "Na 
Na Na Na" and the haunting, 
uniquely Southern imagery 
("...they're barkin' at the trees! 
Swingin' in the breeze that 
blows.._") in "Elephant Radio" 
are enough to at least distin­
guish them from their 
predecessors and the musical 
virtuosity they display shows 
room for growth. 
The second and second-to­last songs on the album are by the Flat Duo Jets, who sound like they're trying to call to mind some of the explosive energy of fifties rockabllly while piping It through loud distorted amps. The vocalist spits outs the words to "Crazy Hazy Kisses" after snarling the classy Introduction " ... I ain't disgustin' in my private life...that's just what turns you mothers on..." Far more interesting is "Jet Tone Boogie," an instrumental variation on Elvis Presley's "Little Sister" which manages to kick up some real steam. 
The other bands represented here are a mixed bag. Love Tractor's wanderi unstruc­lured instrumental "Pretty" is paranoid atmospheric and, ac­tually, relatively pretty. 
The Kilkenny Kats borrow part of a riff from Steppenwolf and beat it into the ground in "Nightfall," which Is basically generic heavy metal. They even mention t1ell at one point, like any heavy metal band worth its Spandex. 
Time Toy is even worse. If their songs on this album are any indication of their general talent, then they deserve to stay In Athens. 
Like the Squalls, Time Toy tries to play off their illustrious fore-runners in Southern pop, but, unlike the Squalls, Time Toy fails. The hook in the 
jumpy "Window Sill" is "Look­ing out the window sill... " which, of course, can't be done. "Hi" borrows generously from the song "Institution­alized" by Suicidal Tendencies and throws around great lyrical lines like " ... and elephants grow real big and they can't walk down the street here be­cause it's against the law, but if they could they would...but it

...would...go wrong...and every 
time it would happen they 
would practically get a ticket..." 
In other words, he was making 
up the words as he went along. 
Elephants must have been a 
hot topic in Athens last winter. 
The Bar-B-Q Killers appear to 
be a respectable third genera­
tion punk band, playing "His 
and Hearse," one of my favor­
ite song titles in a while. The 
rolling, stumbling drums and 
the furious staccato guitar 
bursts play well off the tortured 
vocals making this one of the 
standout songs on the album. 
It also ends with the lead 
singer camping it up with The 
Carol Burnett Show Theme 
('Tm so glad we had this time 
together...") 
Pylon's "Stop It" is a multi­
paced chant of "Don't rock and 
roll, noI" and "Hey! ... kids... " for 
about three minutes that some­
how manages to remain inter­
esting. Pylon, with the B-52s, 
are the granddaddies of the 
Athens "scene" and their expe­
rience Is sadly evident here 
since they're placed between 
two Time Toy songs. 
"Golden," by Dreams So Real, is more along the lines of the stuff I expected to hear on this album. Dreams 5o Real Is one of the thousands of bands who sprang up in the wake of REM's popularity by claiming Lou Reed influences and sounding like REM. Their song, disappointingly, goes nowhere. 
The two songs by REM (the real thing) are far from disap­pointing. Their ad-Jibbed 
Scene-Page 7 

acoustic take on "(All I've Got To Do Is) Dream" Is enchanting in spite of, maybe because of, all the mistakes in it. It is a classic dream song, by a band who's name is a dream state who's sound has often been described as dream-like. I wonder If they see the Irony. The other song they do Is a demo version of "Swan Swan H" from this summer's Llfes Rich Pageant Lp which manages to surpass the original because of the extra sadness and simplicity evoked by the bare acoustic arrange­ment. 
It's wrong to end a review with an admission of its incom­pleteness, but a soundtrack is hard to take in perspective without having seen the movie. Since the movie Athens, GA ­Inside-Out is supposedly being released on a college-campus­only basis, we'll probably never see it here at Notre Dame. Per­haps the songs I didn't like are forgivable or exciting in the context of the movie. I don't know. I do know that this al­bum Is a testament to the strength of the (depending on who you talk to) "about-to­scene"inAthens,sincethe majority of the musk pre­sented stands on Its own, without the movie.

The Observer-March 6, 1987 Scene-Page 8 

"God make thee good as thou art beautiful." 
colleges will learn how to send out young men and women unscarred by the requirements forced on them in the groves of academe. 
You don't have to feel good about yourself because your Notre Dame degree certifies you as good. Just look deep inside to find the beauty there. Search your mind to see if you have any concern for the truth. Reflect on the world to discover if you have any passion for 
justice. Consider the downtrod­den to get an idea if you are totally selfish, principally con­cerned about 'Numero Uno.' Count the people you love, the people you could love, the people to whom you think love is owed, and above all, the people you wish would love you. Ask yourself if there is a book, a poem, a philosophy, an idea or a piece of music that speaks to you as though it were offering you wisdom to live by. Discover some inner brightness you could offer to the sadness of the world. 
Are Notre Dame graduates a special breed? Not unless they want to be. They can deny their own special genius and the special message they have to give to a sodety happy to let dog eat dog. They can let self-pity blind them or walk in the darkness because they don't bother to light candles. They may not be crazy over the special insights that Catholic . , education is supposed to fur-) nish them with, but where are 
they going to find brighter insights than the ones offered here by faith, hope, and love? Above all, they may resent being asked to carry the cross of Christ into their professional and personal lives, to sacrifice prosperity, pleasure, or com­fort for the sake of abstract truth, even if it is life-giving. 11ow similar this is to when the affluent give up some of their privileges to ease the burdens on the backs of the poor. Notre Dame, after all, did not invent the idea of life coming from a love which carries a cross on its back, but it's an idea that could radicalize a century as efficient in finding ways of shedding blood as Toyota is in manufacturing cars. 
Graduates in love with life have the grace in their souls to be very special witnesses to a generation which doesn't seem to mind if the world turn into 
T.S. Eliot's "Wasteland." 
I'm gambling on the kind of students Notre Dame turns out. In my book, they don't have to feel they owe their school anything, as long as they don't give up their own uniqueness for the sake of being like everyone else in the service of Mammon. They do owe them­selves and their children a better country. America is the hope of the world, but America is in sorry shape. The young people can turn the country around if they --even imperfectly--have interiorized worthy ideals. 
As students head off for break. I hope that they will remember how much is entrusted to them and how much the future depends on them. An old war poem reads, "I have a rendezvous with Deattv At some disputed bar­ricadeMhen Spring comes back with rustling shade/And apple blossoms fill the air." The first line inspired Franklin Roosevelt to say, "This genera­tion has a rendezvous with Destiny." My version, combin­ing the poet's and the Presi­dent's, is, "This generation has a rendezvous with Death, to defeat it with Love, if it wants to. That is its Destiny. Other­wise, Death ha~ the last word and Christ is defeated." Notre Dame students are a special breed, and it's more than school pride that makes me say so. Darby, O'Gill and I never said we didn't love them. 

M
aybe if I praise Notre Dame students In a way that sounds as though I'm giving them hell, I will sound less in­gratiating. The truth is that Notre Dame students are a spe­cial breed. Critics of this school see red when they hear the students praised in that way. They are ready to fight you with a list of boorish things that Darners have done. 

Father Robert Griffin 
Letters to a Lonely God 
Years ago, a Chicago fire chief, overseeing the wreckage of a grand piano that some team of ours reduced to kin­dling wood, swore that he would rather see his sons dead than enrolled as students at Our Lady's school. A number of South Bend natives are almost as bitter. I can't change history; a few Irish hellion have track records that live after them. Some of the local neighbor­hoods complain of being vic­timized by rich college kids with loud mouths and drunken habits. Even while admitting the dark spots on our reputa­tion, I'm still ready to believe in the excellence of the Notre Dame students. 
My complimenting the stu­dents doesn't make it true though, no matter how sincere I am. To tell the truth, students don't need compliments from me. What they do need are compliments that tell them the truth about themselves. They are bright young people, much loved and highly thought of. A lot of care has been invested In their upbringing, just ask their parents. 
They can turn out to be bums, sad-eyed and seedy by the time they are thirty. They can break their parents' hearts with their foolish ways, bad marriages, and wrecked careers, thrown away on wine, wantonness, and sleazy discot­heques. They've told each other for years, "There's a real world out there." The real 
world can chew them up and spit them out early, if they let it. If it happens, they can put a quarter in the juke box. and listen over a drink as OI'Biue Eyes sings their theme song: "I did It my way." In reality, of course, they may not have done It their way at all. Nobody taught them to be losers. They themselves had to give up their Ideals and self discipline to become losers crying in their 
beer when they hear the sad 
songs sung. 
I would like every student to hear something shocking. Every day since you were born, the good angels and the bad angels have been fighting over your soul. This, of course, is metaphorical language, though it's true In a spiritual way also. The orthodontist who straightened your teeth, the teacher who had you reading Greek at age three, the camp counsellor who gave you les­sons on survival In the wilder­ness, the coach warning you against habits that could ruin your health, they all befriended you as your good angels. Your bad angels were the guys who told you lies and encouraged you to be sneaky. 


You lived in a home where children were protected. You attended a school where you were taught there is no royal road to a good education. 

Perhaps you met some bad angels masquerading as angels of light, but it's more probable that you met angels of light whom you tried to avoid be­cause they bored you. 
Then you arrived at Notre Dame, with blessings you didn't owe to Rockne or the Golden Dome. This school didn't give you your brains, your talents, your t;itizenship, or your faith. While you are here, you have whole teams of professionals on your side: the faculty, the coaches, Student Affairs, Campus Ministry, and the administration. Some of them, all of them, or maybe a few of them have gotten your attention at least part of the time. Perhaps they were also part-time bores, whom you got tired of as so-called experts telling you what to do and think. Most students get tired of being fed directions. Many can hardly wait until they graduate, get jobs, and can be in control of their lives. Per­haps even right now, you hate the idea of me giving you marching orders to take with you as you leave. Let's face it: preachers like me are shame­less. 
I don't want you joining the work force as though you were Notre Dame's own gift to IBM or to the graduate school of your choice. You shouldn't be so cynical that you hate your­self as an educated Catholic wimp, either. Someday, maybe
