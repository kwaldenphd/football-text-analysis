Notre Dame volunteers 
Appalachia offers work experience 
By CECILIA LUCERO 
StaffReporter 
While many students opt for sun and surf during their spring break, nine to sixteen Notre Dame student~ will head to the mountains of Ken­tucky to do volunteer work for the Christian Appalachian Project (CAP). 
Moira Baker, rector of Lewis Hall, 
will coordinate the informational 
sessions designed to prepare stu­
dent volunteers for the project, 
which will take place March 14-22. 
Notre Dame organizes the 
program in conjunction with Oral 
Roberts University in Oklahoma. 
The CAP is a non-profit, non­denominational orgamzation founded in 1958 by Father Ralph Beiting, who continues to manage the project year-rotund. With an ob­jective to "respond to the cries of powerlessness," CAP volunteers help the people in Appalachia to become self-sufficient. 
"It's really a situation of third world economic development right within our own country," Baker said of the conditions in Appalachia. He added that when "the coal industry entered the area, their only purpose was to extract coal. 
"None of the wealth frorr the coal 
stayed in the area because of the tax 
system. Coal industries were really 
free from any kind of responsibility 
to support the area. They didn't pay 
much property tax, if any." 
According to Baker, no tax base exists for the region to develop educational and social systems, public sanitation and public transportation. 
The CAP relies on two sources of support for improving the Appalac­hian region,these are private dona­tions and volunteer services. Private assistance includes donations of food, clothing, and other items as well as money from fundraisers and foundation grants. -
Beiting, however, said he refuses government aid because it means too much compliance with govern­ment guidelines, "too many strings attached," according to Baker. 
Volunteer work involves an in­direct service to the Appalachian people for a briefperiod oftime. Un­der the direction of a staff of per­manent volunteers, student volunteers predominantly engage in physical labor ranging from home repair to farm work. 
Volunteers also can be asSigned to work in rummage stores, printing shops, and other small businesses that bring in a small income for a family. More direct volunteer service might involve work in a child day care center or a home for handicapped children. 
Baker said that out of respect for the Appalachian people's pride, a less direct volunteer service ap­proach is taken. 
Nevertheless, Baker said, "If it 
hadn't been for the labors of large 
numbers of temporary volunteers 
over the course ofthose thirty years, 
the project never would have been 
able to carry on. 
"Now we have a large permanent 
force of skilled professional and 
semi-professional people," she 
added. 

Through the Social Concerns Seminar offered by the Theology department, Notre Dame students study the economic, social. and political background of the Appalac­hian region -the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains in eastern Kentucky. Students also familiarize

Oil war threatened by Saudi Arabia 
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) ­
Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf oil 
allies -the biggest producing bloc 
in the world -agreed yesterday to 
cut their S;-\-1 base price and warned 
OPEC to follow suit or face an all-out 
price war. 
The amount of the cut was not 
given. but the ministers were 
reported considering a slash of up to 
$7 pt:r -12-gallon barrel. Each S I 
drop in the price pt:r barrel could 
mean a two-cent-a-gallon saving at 
the pump. 
OPEC prt:sident Yahaya Dikko of 
Nigeria, which slashed its oil price 
S5.SO a barrel Sunday, consulted 
with other oil ministers to 
determint: the time and place of an 
emergency OPEC meeting, the car­
tel said in Vienna. 
Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki 
Yamani said the agreement to cut 
the price was reached in a two-day 
meeting among Saudi Arabia, the 
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar 
and Iraq. 
Indonesia, another OPEC mem­
ber, also agreed, he said, as did the 
Persian Gulfsheikdoms ofOman and 
Bahrain, whi.ch do not belong to the 
cartel. Libya participated in the talks 
but its position was not immediately 
known. 
Yamani threatened the gulf producers would throw their "full weight" into the market unless OPEC agreed to a collective reduced price and a new market­sharing formula. 
He cautioned "Nigeria and all producing countries" to modify their positions in order "not to start such a war." which he said would not be in their interest. 
Mana Saeed Oteiba of the Unite{· 
Arab Emirates predicted that OPEC 
would hold an emergency meeting 
next week in Vienna or Geneva. 
He said if no acceptable agree­men£ were worked out Arab gulf members of OPEC "would reduce unilaterally the prices of their crudes, at larger rates than they would have accepted within OPEC." 
Oteiba also said "coordination" contacts were to be launched with non-OPEC members Mexico, Britain and Norway who slashed S3 off the price of North Sea crude Friday. beginning the latest round ofcuts. 
The Saudi newspaper Okaz said two key points on the Riyadh agenda were "the possibility ofother OPEC states resorting to lower prices in step with the international market" and the "decrease by some OPEC states, unilaterally, of their daily crude production." 
This was the first mention that some OPEC states may cut produc­tion. Most OPEC countries are thought to be eager to sell as much crude as they can before prices fall further. 
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is now producing less than 4 million barrels daily, even though it has a capacity of 11 mil­lion. 
Total production for the gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, is es­timated at 10 million barrels daily, which is slightly more than halfofall OPEC production, and about one­fifth ofworld output.

Richard Brautigan 

Author shares poetic anecdotes 
By MARGARET FOSMOE 
Saint Mar)''s Executit'e Editor 
Richard Brautigan. an author whose work brought him popular acclaim in the late 1960s, rt:ad some 
f his poetry and answered ques­tions for a capacity crowd in the Library Auditorium last night as the fourth guest of the Sophomore · Literary Festival. 
Brautigan is noted for his unusual poetic style. His poems often run as short as three lines and record his personal reflections on everyday ex­perience. 
The author told of his return from a recent trip to Japan. He said the Orient, to which he was first exposed at the age of 17, has had a "profound influence" on him. Many ofthe poems Brautigan read last eve­ning were set in Japan. 
From his book "june 20th, june 20th", Brautigan read "Romance," a conjectural record of a fly's thoughts. 
Another poem, "On the Elevator," deals with two men sharing an elevator. "That man's left shoe is probably worth more than every­thing I'm wearing," he quoted. 
Brautigan, who did not tlnish high school, mentioned his limited education in a pot:m about the out­lawJesseJames;saying "My teachers could have worked .for Jesse James, for all the time they stole from me." 
Brautigan answered questions 

from the audience during a break be­tween poems. When questioned about his most popular novel, Trout Fishing in America, he said the book is about "living and dying on this third planet from the sun." 
Brautigan said that he has no philosophical, religious or political convictions. He mentioned a motto he shares with a friend in Japan ­"Eat, fish, and get drunk." He noted that he has little use for drugs be­cause he is "turned on by human in­telligence." 
Brautigan noted the fact that his work is often censored by institu­tions and criticized for its content. 
He warned the audience of his pt:nchanl'.for sexual allusions and expletives in his writing. Brautigan. age 4H, was raised in the Pacitk Northwest. He does much writing in a barn in Montana. The author is traveling to Montana after his engagement at Notre Dame. Freshman Maureen Burke, who at­tended the presentation. said she found Brautigan's work "very funny ... I could understand what he was trying to say. (He presented) very simple thoughts, deep, but under­standable. I could relate to most of them." Brautigan has written 19 books, including A Confederate General From Big Sur ( 1964 ), In Water­melon Sugar ( 1969 ), The Hawkline Monster: A Gothic Western ( 1974), and The Tokyo Montana Express 1980.

Washington was too hoarse to at­tend his own news conference after his surprise victory over Mrs. Byrne in Tuesday's primary. 
Republicans. hoping to gain City Hall for the first time in 50 years, sent their little-known candidate on a campaign walk through the predominantly white and Hispanic home neighborhood of defeated Dt:mocratic contender Richard M. 
Daley. But GOP nominee Bernard Epton disavowed inrerest in a black-white race. "If anybody comes up to me and says they will vote for me because I'm white, as far as I'm concerned they can get lost," the former state representative said. 
An Associated Press-WMAQ 1V exit poll showed Washington got 84 percent of the votes cast by blacks but only six percent among whites. White voters were about evenly split between Byrne and Daley. 
But it also found that about two­thirds of the whites polled did not consider Washington's race impor­tant in their choice of a candidate. That compared with a 50-50 split among blacks.

concede Tuesday night in the city's

A contract giving union exclusive access to a public employer's interoffice mail system does not violate the free speech rights of rival unions, the Supreme Court ruled in Washington yes­terday. By a 5-4 vote, the court upheld such a contract provision negotiated between a teacher's union called the Perry Education Association and the public school system in Perry Township, located in Marion County, Ind. The decision reversed a ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals which had ordered Perry Township school officials to allow the same access to all unions. The exclusive-access 
policy had been challenged by the Perry Local Educators' Associa­tion, a union not designated as the exclusive bargaining representa­tive for the school distriCt's teachers. "Because the mail system is not a public forum, the school district had no (automatic) constitutional obligation to let any organization use the school mail boxes,"Justice Byron R. White wrote for the court majority. -AP  
The Cleveland engineer heading a study ~ to find the cause of a bridge collapse in Antwerp, Ohio that killed five people and injured four said yesterday the most minute aspects of the span will be studied.

He said en­gineers will study everything from the compaction of the dirt to the design of the bridge. "We've taken a look at a lot of different things, and I'm sure one of the things we'll study is the bolts" that held corrugated steel plates in place to form the bottom of the bridge. The span, which included a I 5-foot wide culvert, collapsed the night ofJan. 16 and four cars plunged one-by-one into the ravine as they traveled along the unlighted, two-lane blacktop road between 
Antwerp and eastern sections of the county. -AP

Keep up the PACE 
Bureaucracies have been deceiving the public for years. Ever since the inception of the Xerox machine. gargantuan bureaucracies have spread as fast and thick as an Amazon jungle. Their trademarks include tons of waste paper, stacks of meaningless reports, and fields of red tape. Throw in a few thousand paper shuftlers and rambling politicians for good measure and the result is one giant orgy ofenergy and confusion. But through the sheer power of numbers of these bureaucrats and the tremendous amount of time and energy expended in 
doing whatever it is they do, the public generally believes that at least something is being accomplished. But this is exactly where the deception co ; es into play. Behind the vigorous though chaotic facade of busy work, inane press conferences, and over publicized subcommitte hearings, lurks the true purpose of a bureaucracy: w create the illusion of progress and reform while in fact furthering the cause of stagnation and perhaps even regression. 
But we don't have to look so far as D.C. to witness such a complex and creative in­the­
stitution at work. For The admini~tration's

special contribution to the bureaucratic cause. Unlike in Washington, the Notre Dame bureaucracy is not buried beneath a vast paper wasteland and about the on­ly red tape one sees is evi­dent around Christmas. But the results are all too similar to those of the great bureaucracy of the capital; a lot of paper shuffling, writing of reports, and gran­diose plans but very little ac­
tion. 
The recent developments, or lack thereof, 
concerning the much heralded PACE (Priorities and 
Commitments for Excellence) report are an example of 
bureaucratic dragging-of-heels at its finest. 
The report, the result of two long, difficult years of work by dozens offaculty and administration members and students, addresses the major problems currently facing the university and recommends necessary and realistic solutions. 
But like with any bureaucracy, change at Notre Dame, no matter how worthwhile or imperative, usual­ly progresses at less than a snail's pace. Sometimes the snail doesn't even get started. 
In the January 25 issue of The Observer, managing editor Ryan Ver Berkmoes wrote about a similar univer­sity report compiled ten years ago, the COUP (Committe on University Priorities) report. Several of

the pressing bsues addressed in that report (e.g., the inadequacy of the library, overcrowding in dorms, lack of social space) have yet to be alleviated. In fact, many of the problems brought up in the COUP reporr are reiterated in the PACE report. The acronyms change hut the problems remain the same. 
Which leads us to the same question no doubt asked ten years ago by students and faculty; is the mighty Notre Dame bureaucracy once again merely paying lip service to the serious problems and needs ofits subjects 
m order to pacify them for 
another few years or are they 
serious about alleviating the 
problems? 
adequacies of the university is obviously rooted in the age-old excuse of inspffi­cient funds. All ofthe recom­mendatiens put forth in the PACE report require large financial outlays. But the ad­ministration should also consider that each student is = investing about $40,000 for the Notre Dame experience and right now the university is definitely coming out way ahead in the deal. It's about time that the administration takes a more serious and ag­gressive attitude toward resolving the pressing problems on campus. It revealed this agrressive attitude in both the Campaign for Notre Dame and in raising money for the athletic endowment fund and surpassed the goals in both ventures. There is no reason why the University cannot now locus its 
energies toward raising money to overcome the problems presented in the PACE report. 
There is currently an effort underway to organize committees to "look into" the feasibility of certain recommendations. But who knows how many more committees will be formed in the future. The time for talk is long past. Oil those rusty gears and blow the dust off the PACE report. Leave bureaucracy to the~ pros in Washington and let's solve some of the problems that have plagued Notre Dame for years. You owe it to the students, you owe it to the faculty, and you owe· it to the improvement of Notre Dame.

Study Help Program 
Volunteers tutor school children 
By DAVID F. TRACY 
News Staff 
Thanks to many Notre Dame and 
Ssint Mary's students' donation of a 
few hours of time each week, many 
neighborhood grade school 
children are growing academically, 
socially, and emotionally. 
The Neighborhood Study Help 
Program is the largest volunteer 
group on campus. They began 
seriously recruiting new members 
at the beginning of the semester. 
The NSHP runs 14 tutoring cen­ters two days a week._Jim Baglini, director of the program, described the three different types of centers in the program as neighborhood centers, .in-school centers, and church centers. 
Transportation to the centers is supplied by the NSHP. The captain ofeach center picks up the students on campus and takes them to and from the center. 
Junior Lynn Wittenbrink transported many new volunteers to the Southeast Neighborhood Cen­ter. Although both the tutors and the kids appeared a little uncomfortable at first, after playing a few games to­gether under Wittenbrink's direc­tion, new friendships began to develop. 
The school children asked the tutors their names, their majors, and what they did on Friday nights. 
The Director of the Southeast Center, Gladys McKinney, expressed sincere thanks to the student-tutors for their time and ef­forts. "I've been working with the program since 1968, and the Univer­sity students never stop coming. I think there is a lot of pressure on these grade school children, and the college students' efforts to supple­ment the childrens' teachers and es­
tablish a friendship with the kids 
helps to alleviate some ofthat." 
Mrs. McKinney has a grandson, 
Richard Allen, in the program. 
Richard and his friend Bob Bethany have been attending the tutoring sessions together for a couple of years. They said they would rather be playing football, but they also said they like attending the tutoring ses­sions, noting that the tutors' assis­tance with school work is very helpfuL 
Former Southeast Neighborhood Center captain, john Goelbelbecker, says that there are many more kids and tutors this semester, and the program is much more organized. 
Goelbelbecker, this year's captain of Kennedy, an in-school center, said, "The in-school centers are a lot easier to run because you don't have to worry about disciplining the kids. In the neighborhood centers the tutors have a lot more respon­sibility." 
Wittenbrink said, "When classes aren't going too well and you take an hour to help these kids and spend some time with them, it really puts things in perspective. 

Donald Barrett 
Prof calls Malthus 'clerical idiot' 


By BILL HOGAN 
News Staff 
Professor Donald Barrett last night called population theorist Thomas Malthus a "clerical idiot" who "blamed God for the the misery ofthe poor." 
Barrett spoke on "Population Control and Economic Develop­ment" in a lecture sponsored by the Thomas More Society. 
Malthus' general rule, said Barrett, is that unchecked population in­creases in a geometric ratio while the means of subsistence increases 
in an arithmetic ratio.  
According  to  Barrett,  Malthus  
thought  that  population  growth  
"cannot  be  checked  without  

producing misery or vice. He con­sidered it a natural law set by God that the only way to stop population growth was through famine and ear­ly death of the poor. 
"Malthus opposed contraception because indolence and under­population would result," said Bar­rett. 
He described Neo-Malthusianism as a twentieth century theory which supports Malthus' contention that "the ultimate limits " of population are land and food. 
Unlike Malthus. however, Neo­Malthusians and organizations such as Planned Parenthood and the United States government assert that "the solution of the world popula­tion problem is birth control and abortion," said Barrett. 
Barrett stated the Marxist position on world population and world poverty: "Population gnnvth is not the primary problem. and popula­tion control is not the primary solu­tion." The problem is that there is 
"too much food which too many people are too poor to buy," he said. 
Communists and Socialists believe that "with more people comes more technology," said Bar­rett. "The Socialists are more confi­dent than the Christian West in the future of mankind." 
Barrett, who calls himself a "non­Malthusian," said, "It is a danger to think that world population is the cause of poverty. No causal se­quence has ever been spelled out." 
"The major cause ofpoverty is the structure of society," said Barrett. "There has been no change in the power structure, so the poor are still poor and the powerful are still powerfuL"

Leftist guerrillas build up military capability 

SAN salvador, El Salvador (AP)­Leftist rebels are picking up the pace oftheir guerrilla war against the U.S.­backed government, striking more often and in bigger numbers since Jan. I. 
"The peaks and valleys (in the guerrillas' campaign) are closer to­gether now," says a Western military observer in this Central American country. 
"Before, there would be a major guerrilla uprising, then a lull, then it would be the government's turn," said the observer, who spoke on condition he not be identified. "The guerrillas are orchestrating their of­fensives more often than before." 
But it is uncertain which side is ahead in the 40-month-long civil war that has claimed an estimated 42,000 lives.

Dolan said the campaign -called

They are well-armed with

say continue to llow unabated from 
neighboring Nicaragua, a claim 
Nicaragua consistently has denied. 
"(The guerrillas) can hit a nation­al guard or civil defense post of maybe a dozen men with 200 troops and capture a dozen weapons," said the Western military observer. "It's a cheap way to resupply." 
The rebls also appear to be shift­ing their military tactics, hitting with a rapid-fire string of major assaults.

Early this year the guerrillas launched a major drive in the nor­theastern province of Morazan. They took over much of the north­ern part and drew off some 6,000 government troop~. including the elite U.S.-trained battalion~. While that fight raged, they hit hard in the province of Usulutan to the south, and took over an important city of Berlin. At the same time, the guerril­las were overrunning the pic­turesque artisans' center of La Palma in Chalatenango province on the Honduran border, killing or captur­ing the soldiers there and controll­ing the highway to the border. 
Reagan administration, we honestly believe that the best way to help make l're~ident Reagan the greatest president in history is to un­dertake this campaign," he said. 
Saying that Reagan has repeatedly gotten into trouble by straying from his principles, Dolan echoed other New Right activists who blame Reagan's aides for his problems. 
"The people who are stopping President Reagan from ket·ping the promises he made in 1980 are not only making the president look like just another double-dealing politician, they are contributing to his defeat," Dolan said. 
Reagan has not made any public statement on whether he will run for re-election in 1984, although some Reagan loyalists are known to al­ready have started initial work for such an effort. 
The campaign is a new direction for NCPAC, which has made its reputation by using negative cam­paign tactics to help defeat liberal politicians.

'Project Democracy' unveiled 
WASHINGTON (AP)-President Reagan's S6S million program to promote democracy around the world was unveiled to Congress yes­terday, but skeptical members of congress said it was a bad idea that could create enemies, not friends. 
Members of a House subcommit­tee criticized "Project Democracy" as too vague, questioned whether the administration would promote democracy in friendly as well as un­friendly countries, and predicted that most non-democratic govern­ments would view the program as an attempt to subvert them. 
"I don't see how this program can possibly do anything but get us in trouble," said Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., in urging the administration to reconsider it. "It seems to be basi­cally a multi-million dollar American propaganda effort." 
"The more we look at thb thing, the more nervous I become over it," said Rep. Joel Pritchard. R-Wash. He said he fears most nations will regard it as "mischiefmaking" aimed at top­pling non-democratic governments. 
"I'm trying to tlnd out who is going to spend the money," said Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman ofthe subcommittee on internation­al operations of the House foreign Affairs Committee. "If that i~ not clearly nailed down in the record. then we are going to have real problems."

Shock treatment 

Therapy ignites controversy

H&T Editor 
The electric curn:nt ranges from 70 to 175 volts. Application is brief -between one-tenth ofa second to one and a half seconds. 
Reaching the brain via electrodes placed on the head, a hrid convul­sion is induced. The often dramatic result: near immediate improve­ment from depressive disorders. 
Despite the claims of therapeutic value, electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ), commonly known as shock treatment, remains a controversial subject. Those opposed to ECT typi­cally point to the dehumanizing aspect of deliberately passing electricity through a patient's body. Together with the lack of an ac­cepted explanation of how the therapeutic effects are achieved and the consistent side effects such as memory loss, shock therapy has been attacked repeatedly.

According to Dr. <ilcnn Harris, a

Although Harris docs not practice shock treatment himself, he does recommend it under particular cir­cumstances. "I have not seen any serious complications personally," he said, "but on the other hand, I have seen it save lives -people that were literally starving away."

The outer limits 

Quasars define universal boundary 
Editor's Note: This is the secondof a two-part story dealing with quasars and the outer limits ofthe universe. 
By FRANK GABRIELE 
B& T Reporter 
It is highly unlikely that anything could exist farther from the earth than the starlike objects known as quasars. 
One lir.1itation is the very size of space itself; if the physical constant ofc (the speed of light) is in fact the universal velocity limit, the distance travelled by an object cannot be greater than the speed of light mul­tiplied by the age ofthe universe, the latter being measured from the hypothetical time ofthe Big Bang up to the present (rate X time equals distance, remember?). 
The farthest quasars are at 12 bil­lion light years, or about 92 percent ofthat limiting size. 
Secondly, if anything were farther away it would have to be moving very close to the speed oflight, thus producing a great deal ofenergy and most likely visible in one or more of the identifiable spectra (visual, x­ray, infrared, or radio). 

In effect, the eye "sees" by receiv­ing an image which was illuminated l)v some light source at whatever time it was that that light bounced off of or emanated from that object. So the image of what you are seeing is as old as the time it took for the light to get to your eyes. Thus, quasars were I 2 billion light .years away; it took 12 billion years for their light to reach us, and we are thus looking back in time at some­thing which was there I 2 billion years ago!

The University of Notre Dame has recently shown its heightened inter­est in astronomy by acquiring Assis­tant Professor Terrence Rettig from Indiana University. Rettig did hb graduate and post-graduate work at 
I.U. in astronomy and astrophysics and has done some work with quasars and quasar theory. He cites the importance of astronomy as not only an intellectual adventure but as a vital source of information about where we came from and where we may he going. 
"If we consider the Big Bang theory, we may wonder whether this 'universal birth' will ever occur again-is the matter of the universe gradually slowing down towards an eventual collapse and rc-ignition ofa Big Bang-type explosion, or b it destined to expand outward into space forever, never to coalesce again'" 
It is this type of probing question which characterizes and detlnes astronomy as one of the most fascinating sciences in our present 'Age of Information', one which uses the scientific method to explore what might otherwise be the idle dreams of men.

Panel discussions throughout the weeks prior to the actual work project are conducted to consider possible Christian responses to the oppression in the area, according to Baker. Students also keep a journal of reflections throughout the entire program. 
"Most people really seem to enjoy what they're doing -to enjoy working together in that kind of community, meeting people from the other school (Oral Roberts Uni­versity) whose religious experience is so very different," said Baker. 
Students rarely complain about the working conditions, Baker claims. "No matter how many times I've said 'Your work is only indirect though your labors contribute directly to whatever needs to be done with the project,' students sometimes don't hear that while they're here," she said. 
"They (the students) are a little bit surprised from the beginning that they're not out in the hollers working directly with people. But then they quickly readjust their thinking and seem i:o ·enjoy the work." 
Senior Patty Fox, who par­ticipated in the program two years ago, returned the following summer because of her interest in service work Her four-week summer project involved home visits with the Appalachian people, which gave her more of a chance to develop 
friendships with the local people, she said. Fox also taught Bible school during the last week of her summer project. 
Fox said she decided to return that summer because the week-long spring project did not offer enough opportunity for direct service. "During the tlrst week when I went in Spring, I did a lot of manual stuff

Project volunteers "have a very good working relationship with the people." 
Bridget Blais, a junior from 
Seattle, said she took part in the CAP 
two years ago because she "wanted 
to make it a meaningful (spring) 
break." 
Blais worked in the day care cen­
ter for Appalachian children in 
Berea. Kentucky. \': lunteers must 
be careful to work with people with­
out demeaning their pride, accord­
ing to Blais. "Volunteers have to 
fight the attitude 'Well, I'm going to 
go down and save them,"' she said. 
"We're there to learn." 
Although much of the Appalac­
hian region shows few discernable 
changes, some improvements have 
been achieved, according to Baker. 
"Over the past fourteen or flfieen 
years, there hasn't been a whole lot of change. A few consolidated schools have been built, the roads have changed markedly since the '60s and the declaration of the war on poverty. 
"A whole lot of money went to 
building roads, dams, and artificial 
lakes, that kind of stuff. But a lot of 
the money, really when you look at 
it, didn't reach the lowest levels, and 
didn't get into the pocket of the 
poorest people." 
Baker added, "Some of the 
programs that were begun in the 
'60s have since just died. So that 
things continue-on pretty much the 
same as they have in the past." 
The main problems in the moun­
tains are unemployment and the 
lack of opportunities to acquire 
skills, according to Baker. Although 
more people try to leave the moun­
tains, the urban unemployment dilemma prevents them from tlnd­ing jobs in the city. 
"There are less for them in the cities, and th~re wasn't mucn, ~i: best, before," Baker said. 
The majority ofthe coal mines, on which most of the population depended as a source of income, now have been autom~ted or shut down. With the increase of strip mining, more sophisticated tech­niques are employed that only can be operated by skilled workers. 
"Many of the families that I worked with fourteen years ago are in the same situation they were in then. It's just that their kids are older and unemployed whereas before their fathers were unemployed, said Baker. "Now the father is usually gone and the younger children are unemployed without much of a prospect for the future." 
Baker has organized the spring program for the past three years, when it began as a Lewis Hall en­·deavor and eventually grew o in­volve the entire campus population. Baker hopes to extend the CAP by coordinating a project for the fall midterm break. 
"It's a beautiful time of the year. 
The mountains are beautiful. It's just 
a shame that they house and hide

Harold Washington: when dreams come true 
The underdog pulled the upset. 
In Tuesday's Chicago Democratic mayoral primary, Harold Washingroh, a black U.S. congressman hardly anyone had heard of before last December, defeated the incum­bent Mayor Jane Byrne and State's Atrorney for Cook County (lll.) Richard M. Daley, the son of the late Chicago Mayor Richard ]. Daley. This happened as a result of many fac-
Tim Neely 
My Turn 
tors, but primarily through Washington's ability to come off as a viable and knowledgeable candidate, with a liberal dose of Byrne's and Daley's (especially Byrne's) blunders. 
The story of Washington i.s one of a man who was talked into a run at the two front­runners by Chicago's black leaders, including Rev. JesseJackson. When he began, he had_no money and liHle respect from his two op­ponents, whose campaign people were ar­guing about whether and how to hold debates -just between the two of them. 

After a few weeks, Washington's seemingly quixotic run for the top job in America's Second City began to gain respect. Seeing the substantial support he had from the black wards, the League of Women Voters con­sidered him viable enough a candidate to be included in the mayoral debates held in January. 
For most non-blacks this was the tlrst op­portunity to hear Washington's point of view, as his campaign lacked the funds to conduct a media blitz. He presented himself in the debates as an eloquent public speaker who seemed ro know what was going on, attacking the mayor when necessary and using often ex­treme candor seldom seen in any politician, much less one running for office. (His state­ments that he would immediately fire Chicago's police commissioner and that he 
felt  tax  increases  were  necessary  are  ex­ 
amples.)  
While  Washington successfully used  the  

free advertising ofthe debates to make himself better known to the electorate at large, Byrne, who had a substantial lead according to some polls, began to make mistakes. She pulled off several ploys during those months between the last general election and Tuesday's city primary which received criticism because they were construed as "politicaL" 
After WGN late-night personality Eddie Schwartz conducted a successful one-night food drive Dec. I<; in response to yet another clone of "Mayor Byrne's Chicagofest" (actually invented by former Mayor Michael Bilandic in 1978) scheduled for New Year's Eve, the city, with its vast resources, felt it could conduct one of its own over a longer period of time and achieve better results. But the campaign got in the way, and while the· drive occurred, it died a quiet death, a victim of underpublicity. 
Another festival, the week-long "Loop Alive!", was originally scheduled for this week, strategically timed with the primary. Byrne's -festival mentality was fodder for the claim that she cared more how outsiders saw the city than about the people who actually lived in it. 
And what about Daley? As a result ofa Byrne media blitz during the Christmas season, just as she officially announced her candidacy, Daley lost a lead estimated at between 20 and 30 percentage points quickly, and as Washing­ton began to become familiar to the public, the magic of the Daley name began to fade. 
Finally, until very near the end, the two "name" candidates tried to feign ignorance of 
Washington's ever-more-viable campaign. Most of Byrne's and Daley!s campaign ads were pointed at each orher, each one aHack­ing the foe at any vulnerable spot. Meanwhile, Washingron focused on issues and ideas, using the forums given him at the public debates and by WGN's Wally Phillips, who invited each Democratic candidate onto his program, the mest listened-ro in the country, for a chance to field the public's unrehearsed ques­tions. Even right before election day, he could afford few media spots, but used them at strategic times rather than flooding the airwaves with them. 
By the time election day came around, Washington was second in most polb. On the morning after, he was first on the one that counted. Barring a truly major upset by the Republican, Harold Washington will become the tlrst black mayor of Chicago, a feat which seemed impossible last December when he was "volunteered" into running. But by his judicious use of limited monetary resources, seemingly unlimited human resources, and the incumbent's perceived blunders, the "dream," as Washington called his campaign in yesterday morning's victory speech, has become a reality.

Perhaps effective student government at Notre Dame really is possible. At least the cur­rent administration is working to make it so. 
Tom Mowle 
Current Line 
In its last two meetings, the Student Senate finally addressed the largest obstacle to its ef­fectiveness: the perception that student government is a "do-nothing" group, as one officer put it. A large part of this perception is because of the student's lack of awareness of student government's purpose. 
To increase their awareness, the Senate amended its constitution to change "Student 

Union" to "Student Government Activities Board." This is more than simply a name change; it should help change students' misperceptions by addressing their cause. 
The new title for the Board explains exactly 
what it does: it organizes activities sponsored by ~i:lidcf;[ g3>trnmt:rii. 1'his is what it has ai­ways done, hut now studerlts will be aware of it. The new title also emphasizes its role as a member of student government, not a separate entity. 
As part ofstudent government, it is both ac­cessible to people who wish to participate in it and a demonstration of the accomplish­ments of student government. The intluence the Student Senate now will have over the spending of the Activities Board will serve ro counter claims that the Student Senate ac·­complishes nothing tangible. 
In addition, more people will now be in-
P.O. Box Q 
Doctor's review 
DearEditor: 
Yes, we should be concerned with the quality oflife. The author of"The challenge to be pro-choice" in Monday'sObserver is to be commended for this. 
However, I regret that the author so often finds abortion the "pro-family" choice. 
Ours is indeed not a utopian society. But blaming children and seeking to limit the family size of the poor is hardly an ap­propriate step for those ofus struggling to be compassionate Christians. 
For all who view life, or potential life, as a gift ofGod, it is not helpful to say we have a right to make children. We accept or reject God's gift of children, just as we accept of reject our impoverished neighbors 
"deformed" children, pregnant teenagers, and women who have abortions. 
We can never guarantee the physical, mental or emotional health of anyone. But we can care for unwed mothns and for un­wanted children. I find this difficult to do at times, but believe it is what our God would have us do. 

When we are able to do it, we will no lon­ger need abortion clinics or Human Life Amendments. 
Until then, I challenge my pro-life and pro­choice friends to support parents and poten­tial parents as they nurture and give life. And when parents are no longer able to do this, we ought to accept the responsibility to care for their children. 
Finally, all of us who enter this debate would do well to argue our points more cogently and with greater respect for our opponents.

volved in student government and see what it really does. This in turn should convince stu· dents that participation in student govern· ment is a worthwhile endeavor, and that it does make a difference who is elected to the Senate. 
BesiJe~ encouraging the election of increasingly qualified people to the Senate. the merger will encourage more pt·oplc to get involved in student government as members of the Activities Board. At this time, there are only two applicants for Student llnion direc­!or, and some members of the Senate fear that the Union may become a nepotic body. 
Another way more people can be included in student government is by including the various hall commhsioners -social, athletic, academic -on committees within student government. This would increase the com­munication between student government and

the halls in both directions. Once again, this would help to increase students' awareness of student government and its activities, and it would also help increase student govern­ment's responsiveness to the desires of the student body. 
Stuf1;:-m B~0y President Lloyd Burke is ­driving for these changes so his succes~or Brian Callaghan will have a more receptive student body to preside over. In fact. Burke's work in these past several weeks may leave Callaghan with a tough act to follow. 
But the present name change should not be the end ofthe process. Continued change will be neccessary to involve more people in stu­dent government. When this happens, and when the students' perception of student government is changed, the Senate will be able to have a real effect on the policies of the university.

boring. However. it keeps promising more. As a reader, you keep waiting to get to the good part. There is no good part. By the time vou realize this, it's too late, you're trapped in a literary quagmire-. · On the cover, Roger Rabbit looks promising. The prrmise is interesting enough. The author, Gary Wolf. has taken the hard-boiled detective novel and adapted it to the world ofcartoons. The cemral character of the book is a Philip Maflow type ofcharacter, who is a two-hit private eye. He drinks heavily, and drools after "babes." 
While the detective is human, most of the other characters are 
Ryan VerBerkmoes 
not. In the world ofRogerRabbit, cartoon characters are real. They 
are not drawn, they sort of live, but then again they don't. Sound 
confusing, it is. The book's namesake is a six-foot tall, carrot-eating 
rabbit. As a minor character in a slumping comic strip, Roger Rabbit 
has a photographer instead ofan artist. 
In this book, cartoon characters, or "toons" as the humans call 
them are second class citizens. Thus our detective, Eddie Valiant, is 
not pleased to see this living lapin in his office. However, Eddie 
needs booze money, so he accepts a case from Roger, whose toon 
wife has left him. This goes on for a few chapters, then Roger gets 
plugged. By this time the reader may be glad to see the insipid Roger 
dead, but no such luck, it seems toons can come back to life for a few 
days at will. So Roger helps Eddie find his killer. This goes on and on 
and on and ... 
The idea ofcreating a world where folks like Bugs Bunny and Humphrey Bogart co-exist seems interesting, it probably is, but not here. Aworld as bizarre as this probably should be presented just for the reader to accept. Instead, Wolftries to explain how it works. This consumes numerous pages and is quite implausible. The toons do not have voices, they speak in word baloons which sort offloat about. 
Wolf does a pretty good job at creating interesting sounding 
characters, but they never pan out. Each has the whit of"Nancy," and 
the charm of"Henry." There is no definable mood. Whereas 
Raymond Chandler created a sleezy scene for Marlow, and Fritz 
Lange placed Bugs Bunny in a land ofLunacy, Wolfs characters exist 
in murk. The rich images that are key to the success ofany book are 
missing. 
It reallv is a shame because the basic idea is a good one. But it 
needs a precision hand to write it. Wolfdoesn't succeed in painting 
the campy atmosphere for which RogerRabbit cries out. After the 
first few pages, it becomes apparent that the book is one joke effort. 
After you have read the same joke for the hundredth time it wears 
thin. Wolfdoesn't run with it, he sits with it. 
Worst ofall are the botched scenes. When Roger Rabbit is almost killed by a cream pie, the joke just lays-flat as a pancake. When Eddie meets Dick Tracy, just as the reader gets ready for some interesting dialogue; the scene switches. Missed oppurtunities abound. 
The promotional literature calls Who Censored RogerRabbit? "a · soon to be cult classic." It is always best to be wary ofsomething that proclaims its success before proving it. Overall, once you escape from this mess, you'll be left disappointed. Wolfcould have done so much inore. After all, imagine a world where you really could shoot cartoon characters -like Garfield.

report to the Generals' training 
eamp in Orlando, !'Ia.. until Saturday 
at the earliest. The LSFI.'s initial 
""a"on begins :\larch 6. 
"Herschel has done more for professional football players than all the union's striking and debating that's ever taken place," said Man­ton. "His contract will be the guideline for the future." 
Manton said he checked into the tinancial status of Generals owner J Walter Duncan and found he could fulfill the contract even if the USFL should fold. 
In a prepared statement from the 
Univrrsity of Georgia officials said 
that Walker had been declared in­
eligible because he had signed with 
the Generab. Walker denied the 
reports. 
But :\!anton contirmed yesterday 
that Walker had signed a document 
last week when he met with Duncan 
and Generals :\lanager]im Valek in 
Athens. Manton said Walker had "an 
oral promise" that he could change 
his mind ifhe so desired, and Walker exercised that option two hours later. 
Generals vice president of busi­ness affairs Charles Theokas said Walker's arrival in the USFL would "absolutely have a huge, huge im­pact on the credibility of the franchise," much as the signing of Joe Namath out of Alabama gave in­stant credibility to the fledgling 
American Footballl.eag t ue in 196';. 
"There's been an immediate im­
pact on ticket sales," Theokas said 
from the team's headquarters at 
Hackensack, N.J. "The phones have 
been ringing already." 
USFL commissioner Chet Sim­
mons said Manton tirst approached

Women swimmers get ready for Invitational 

ByTHERON ROBERTS 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's swim­ming team begins preliminary com-_ petition in the Midwest Invitational today, facing some of the strongest teams from Illinois, Michigan and In­diana Action concludes with the finals, to be held on Saturday. 
After closing out its season last Wednesday with a win against Kalamazoo College, the team has · 
been hard at work preparing for this meet. 
An integral part ofgetting ready is mental preparation. "We've been an­ticipating this meet since January," senior co-captainJean Murtagh says. 
"The big thing is to psyched up for it,
since we are already in good physi-· cal shape." 
Irish coach Dennis Stark is pleased with the progress he's seen during the course of the year. He notes, in particular, the fact that the team,. started this season without its four· fastest swimmers from the year before. 
"The girls have worked hard this year," Stark says. "It was difficult for them in their first year ofNCAA Divi­sion I competition. We have a young 
team, and the experience the girls 
races. Both anticipate swimming well. 
Notre Dame's entry in the medley relay of Raili Tikka, Cochiolo, Gam­boa and Korowicki looks to place high as well. This quartet has broken the Irish varsity record for the med­ley relay twice previously this season. 
"Ifthere's one thing that is certain, it is that we will be in the best physi· cal condition of the year," says Gam­boa. "New records are sure to be set." 
"Regardless of how the girls do at the Midwest Invitationals, I would term the season a success," says Stark, "but I hope the team does welL" 
This weekend marks the last home seriesfor the doomed Notre Dame hockey team as it hosts Illinois-Chicago. A win or a tie will put the Irish
