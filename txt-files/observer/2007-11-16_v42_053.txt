Campus engages sexual violence issues

By KAREN LANGLEY 
News Ediwr 
In recent years, campuc; dialogue has increasingly addrnssnd issues of sexual violence. This attention hac; grown throughout campus but has particularly drawn male aetivi'its, University officials and student leaders say. 
Student groups are calling with incmac;ing intensi­ty on both the men and women of Notre Dame to reduce the instances of sexual ac;sault -which all sources say occur much more often to members of the campus community than may be perceived. 
"We want to create a movement where we say, 'No, this ic; not OK. and we won't let thic; happen,"' said MichaPI HPdding, president of Men Against Violence. 
Though no more than two rapes have been report­ed to NDSP during any year in the last decade,

Associate News Ediwr 
Onstage since Monday, "Loyal Daughters and Sons" will end its run in Washington Hall tonight after a weeklong effort to address sexuality and sexual assault at Notre Dame, from both the male and female perspectives. 
Thursday's audience of 337 was the largest the production has seen to date, and a similar turnout is expected tonight, according to junior Sarah Van Mill, one of the show's head writers. 
"Loyal Daughters and Sons" has been averaging about 200 people every night, she said. 
And the feedback from those hundreds of attendees -mainly students and faculty

Islam and Christianity: brothers in faith 
Archbishop discusses compatibility of two religions, common ancestry, misconceptions 

By JOSH LEEUW News Writer 
The rift between Christianity and Islam can bP solved by find­ing a common ground in God and a sharPd ancestry, Archbishop Celestino Migliore, Permanent Observer of the I loly See to the Unit11d Nations, said Thursday. 
Migliore told a popular Middle Eac;tern story to illustrate the pic­ture Muslims and Christians have of each other. 
A man walks in the desert and sees a monster on the horizon, he said. As the man gets closer, he realizes it isn't a monster but a very ugly man. When he is right in front of the man, he sees it is his brother. 
"Muslims see Christians as monsters of the Crusades.... Christians see Muslims as mon­sters in a similar light," Migliore said. 
With both religions having ancient histories, rooted deeply in tradition, it is often said the reli­gions could not be compatible, the Archbishop said. 
"However, both religions con­tain elements that are compatible, but are just unaccepted because of misconceptions," Migliore said. Migliore addressed three points of convergence between Muslims and Christians, aspects both sects of believers share.

The School of the Americas Watch, a nonviolent grassroots advocacy movement, organized the vigil-protest, which will take place Nov. 16-18.

Cuba talk focuses on future 
Journalists: Government has several options 
By LINDSAY SENA 
News Writer 
Io::xperts di<>eu&sed Cuba's political system and their thoughts on the country's future, given the failing health of President Fidel Castro Thursday. 
The lecture, titled "Cuba from Inside," featured Hewlett Visiting Fellow and freelance journalist Cecilia Vaisman and former Havana bureau chief for the Chicago Tribune Gary Marx. 
'We don't believe he's mming baek to power," Vaisman said. The two said Cuba ha<; several options for its government in the future. 
The nation could adopt a "ChinaMetnam style/model" of gov­erning, which would improve living standards for Cubans while still maintaining a single-party system, Vaisman said. Or, she said, Cubans could stage a violent uprising for democracy, which is "extremely unlikely." 
"Qvil society is not strong enough to challenge the government," she said. 
Although there have been several positive changes since the 1990s, such as the legalization of the U.S. dollar and the opening of some Cuban sectors to tourism and invest­ment, there is still a growing inequal­ity between the rich and the poor, Marx said. 
'There is a gap between those with dollars and those without," he said, using the quinciiiera as an example of wealthy Cuban excess.

you are the only one in the world to 
have that power. 
With the price of gas today, who wouldn't chose 11ight? You could just zoom around whenever going somewhere, and as an added bonus, you could make a really good witch or wizard costume at Halloween. 
Of course the invisible power 
would have its advantages, too ­
excelhmt for pranks and escaping a 
tight situation, but ultimately I 
don't think it would be a useful 
power for good, just a temptation of 
the oppositn. 
Shoplil'ling would become simple, and from that one could easily snowball into bad things. Anyway, one would have trouble being a super hero with either of those powers, if that was the only one tlwy had. Unless you had super st.rongth, or a super hero team to back you up, of course. 

If I wuld chooso any power. it would he a dose dedsion bntween controlling tinH~ and eontrolling gravity. Tinw control would be both fun and useful. but the spnc.ific details would havn to bn worked out. If you went back in limo a day, what would happen to the rest of tlw world -would they also go hack'! Could you meet. your past self. or would there always bn only one of you? It could get confusing if a new copy of you was made every time you time-traveled. After a while, thero would be so many copies of you, you would definitely run out of clothes for all of your selves. And I suppose you could just stop timo and steal some from the store, but lwy, that's not proper conduet for someone posing as a super hero. 
According to an online quiz, I would be Superman. I wouldn't want to be Superman though­actually I wouldn't want to be many of the super heroes-tragedy seems to be one of the prerequisites for gaining powers. Spiderman's unde died, Superman's planet blew up, the X-men protect people who misunderstand them and countless other heroes have been exposed to toxic chemicals or radiation. I would imagine those must have been traumatic nxperiences. 

I gunss that's where their great sense of responsibility and virtue comes from. Evnn Aristotle sup­ported super herons (according to Wikipedia): "Tlwre are men so god­like. so exceptional, that they natu­rally, by right of their extraordinary gifts, transcend all moral judgment or eonstitutional eontrol: There is no law whieh embraees men of that calibre: They themselves are law."

CLIO, Mieh. -A police officer checking on a truck that got stuck in the mud at a city park was startled to find a 13-year­old boy behind the wheel. The officer also was sur­prised that the boy appeared to be drunk. 
So did the teen's father, who was riding in the front seat. l-Ie told police that he had turned over the driving duties to his son because he'd had too much to drink.

Man allegedly uses stapler to rob store 
ASHLAND, Ky. -A man wearing a ski mask held up an eastern Kentucky ice cream store with a sta­pler, and briefly got away with $175. 
Police identified the sta­pier bandit as Gerald A. Rocchi, 32, who was arrested shortly after he allegedly flashed a chrome-plated stapler at an employee of The Ice Cream Shop in Ashland on Tuesday and demanded money. 

Ashland Police Capt. Don Petrella said he didn't know if R{)cchi planned to shoot staples at the shop's employees or use it as a blunt instrument if he did­n't get the cash. It didn't come to that because the employees handed over the cash, Petrella said.

Somalian pirate attacks on the rise 
MOMBA.SA-With one slain crew mate in the ship's freezer and Somali pirates threatening to kill his son, Capt. Xinshen Ung could think of only one thing to do: Threaten to throw himself into the shark-infested waters, calculating the pirates wouldn't want to lose the capk'1in. 
lie was right. Four pirates immediately rushed to keep him from jumping off the Taiwanese fishing vessel. 
"It was a test. I wanted to see how much the pirates valued me ... They know if the captain dies, they will get less ransom," the 47-year-old told The Associated Press, safe in Kenya on Wednesday after the U.S. Navy stepped in to win the relea..qe of the Ching Fong Hwa 168 and its surviving crew, including Ung's son. 
Ling's tale of seven months of captivity is frighteningly common off the lawless coast of war-ravaged Somalia, where piracy is on the increase. After releasing the ship and its crew on Nov. 5, the pirates got away with an unspeci­fied ransom paid by the ship's owner. 
Cyclone hits Bangladesh coast

Tropical Cyclone Sidr swept in from the Bay of Bengal, buffeting the southwestern coa..qtal areas within a 155-mile radius of its eye with heavy rain and storm surges predicted to reach 20 feet high. 
No casualties were immecliately reported, but rescue teams were on standby.

Mystery creature sighted in florida 
MACCLENNY -Whether the mystery crit­ter roaming northern Florida is an orang­utan, a "baby Bigfoot" or something else, wildlife officials think it might have a bit of Homer Simpson in it. 
After a bear hunter said an animal that could be an orangutan stole jelly doughnuts from him, a wildlife investigator has tried to use sweet treats to lure the creature into the op~m in Baker County. 
There have been several sightings of what witnesses have described as a "big orange ball of' f'ur," though oflicials have yet to con­firm it's an orangutan, said Karen Parker, a spokeswoman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 

Tenants suspicious of police motive 
CIIICt\GO -Jacqueline Thompson has lived in the public housing projects for nearly half a century and can't remember evnr seeing this many police officers around before. 
From her third-floor window, she watch­es as they routinely pile out of squad cars, slap cuffs on young black men and take them away. Like other tenants, Thompson believes there's a simple explanation: money. 
She and others suspect police are has­sling tenants in a plot by City Hall to empty out the projects and redevelop the land.

Earl Hunt, 66, of Kennard, was arrested this week by Indiana Department of Natural Resources Conservation Officers and charged with multiple counts of ille­gally shipping wildlife. 
The DNR said Hunt sold coyotes trapped in Indiana for use in penned dog-running facilities in other states. Hunters use dogs to chase coyotes or foxes in the fenced-in areas.

Government seizes Sunni headquarters 
Hardline clerics group, accused ofsupporting al-Qaida, questions reasons behind evacuation

BAGHDAD -The Iraqi government seized the west Baghdad headquarters of a powerful Sunni Muslim group Wednesday, cordon­ing off the building and accusing the group of sup­porting al-Qaida, officials said. 
The Association of Muslim Scholars, a hard­line Sunni clerics group with links to insurgents, has its headquarters in the Um al-Qura mosque in the capital's Sunni-dominated Ghazaliyhah neighborhood. 
Iraqi security forces dis­patched by the Sunni Endowment, a government agency that cares for Sunni mosques and shrines, sur­rounded the mosque com­plex at 9 a.m. and demand­ed that the building be evacuated before noon, the association said in a state­ment posted on its Web site. 
Employees were told to remove all personal belong­ings and even haul out fur­niture, that troops said would be destroyed if left behind, it said.

Migliorn citt~d the Vatkan II doc­ument, "Nostra Aetate," to explain how the Catholic Church regarded non-Christian religions, spm:ilkally the Muslims. 
"They [the Muslims). do not ;u:knowledge Jesus Christ as Cod," Migliore said, reading the document.

illegally, to the United States, 
where he joined a gang. 
"llis comfort is in weapons and 
violence. I attribute that to the 
fact he was in the army at a very 
young age," Angulo said. 
He saw a photo of his host brother and some friends from their time in the army and "they were smiling, with guns," he said. "I recognized imnwdiatPiy they were wearing American uniforms -green fatigues ­and guns that we sold them." 
This weekend's vigil-protest is "a lot more personal" for Angulo. 
"In the past, it was a lot more about the ideals of social justiee and what kind of muntry I want to be living in," he said. "It still is about that. but now it means mom." 
WIIINSEC's motto is "Paz, l.ibertad y Fraternidad" (Peace, Liberty and Brotherhood). According to its Web site, the Institute's mission includes "fos­tering mutual knowledge, trans­parency, confidence, and cooper­ation by promoting democratic values, respect for human rights and an understanding of U.S. customs and traditions." 
The Institute is succeeding in its mission, Angulo said. 
"The mission of any military institution where the United States is assisting other mili­taries is first and foremost fur­thering American interests in the region," he said. "This is historic, we're talking the Monroe Doctrine, where we say, 'Basically, this hemisphere is ours."' 
The pursuit of American inter­ests in Latin America has reper­cussions that touch the military, economy and immigration, Angulo said. 
"It's hard not to make the con­nection ... it's all right there," he said. "We need to recognize his­torically what's happening and work to stop future abuses."

"IfChri-;tians and Muslims want to find eommon ground . . . they must start with God," he said. He went on to discuss how all reli­gions, no matter what the denom­ination, have a form of the "gold­en rule."

IN BRIEF 
Gold prices fall after recent peak 
NEW YORK-Gold prices tumbled Thursday as weaker energy prices and a slight rise in the U.S. dollar prompted investors to pull back from the safe-haven metal and book profits after months of sharp gains. 
The commodities markets moved broadly lower as the greenback gained strength, mak­ing prices appear more expensive to foreign buyers. Energy, metals and agricultural futures declined. 
Gold prices have become extremely volatile as the market wrestles with a correction fol­lowing the metal's climb to levels not seen since 1980. The big day-to-day moves of $20 to $30 an ounce seen this week should be expected, analysts say, after the price of gold ballooned $200 in fewer than three months. Although analysts described Thursday's move as partly technical in nature, a drop in energy prices and strength in the dollar added to the pressure. 
Hugh Hefner donates money to USC 
LOS ANGELES -Hugh Hefner has donated $2 million to the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts. 
The money will fund a central exhibition space in the new headquarters of the school and an archival repository for student films and historic documents, the university said. 
The existing repository, which bears Hefner's name, holds more than eight decades of student films, including some by George Lucas. 
"I've always believed that following one's dreams is very important," Hefner said in a statement from USC. 
The 81-year-old Playboy founder has con­tributed millions of dollars to preserve films and fund cinema schools over the years. llefner gave $100,000 to USC in 1992 to create a course, Censorship in Cinema, and in 1995 he donated $1.5 million to endow the Hugh M. llefner Chair for the Study of American Film. total)

Georgia drought hurts agriculture 
Farmers worry about competing with Atlanta, Florida for water; state enacts new restrictions 
Associated Press 
CAMILLA -Southwest Georgia is one of the most productive agricultural regions in Dixie, but you wouldn't know it from the soil under the corn, peanuts and cotton. It can be sandy, it can be pebbly, and it does­n't hold water very well. 
That begins to explain why irrigation is so vital around here -and why the mere suggestion that some of the region's water might be taken away fills folks with fear and resentment. 
With a historic drought gripping the Southeast, Georgia farmers are increasingly worried that their needs will be sacrificed to those of Atlanta -a city of runaway growth and seemingly unquenchable thirst -or water-guzzling Florida. 
"Atlanta needs to take a hard look at what's happen­ing in the metro area," said Bubba Johnson, a 68-year­old farmer who grows cot­ton and corn on a 500-acre plot. "There's going to be a heck of a battle if they try to come down here to get the water." 

The drought has forced much of the state to enact unprecedented watering restrictions, and legislative leaders want to build more state reservoirs. Some ­including Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin -have one competes for water," largest independently bring themselves to tell their also floated the idea of said Glenn Cox, a farmer in owned garden center, said greedy constituents com­transferring water to Camilla.

Some survivors wonder whether. as members of a eom­munity whose Catholic values dis­courage premarital sex, they can still be considered virgins, she said. 
"To equate a person who has been raped with someone who has ehosnn to have sexual inter­eoursn could not be more wrong," Rakoczy said. "Hape is a <Time." 
Any student found by the Oflice of Residence Ule to have mmmit­1.!1d such a <Time will be expelled from the University. he said. 
Such an expul'iion ha'i occurred at NotrP. DamP., he and Firth said. 
Kirk said the majority of sexual assaull'i he's seen report11d during 17 years in NotrH D;une adminis­tration sham a common factor ­the pmsence of alcohol. 
"We never want to say the vie­tim is in any way responsible for sP.xua1 a'isault," Kirk said. 
The use of alcohol eannot be seen a'i a eaus;u link with a situa­tion in which someonp, chooses to act criminally, Kirk said. But drinking ecm still inerea'ie risk. 
"If akohol lowers your inhibi­tions, it can put you in dangerous situations." he said. 
Akohol can act as "liquid courage," Kirk said. eausing "bmeding grounds" for sexual vio­lence and regretted sex. 
Thn U.S. Department of .lll'itice reporl'i that college studenl'i who get drunk at \na'it oncP. a week are 75 percent more likely to be sexu­ally victimized than othnr stu­dents, according to Gender Hnlations Cenwr records. 
The Committee on Sexual A'isault Prevention is eo-chairP.d by Bill Kirk, Associate Vice President f(Jr Residence Ute, and Ann Firth, Assoeiate Vice Prnsident fi>r StudP.nt Affairs. The committee includes representa­tives of the Oflices of Residence Life and Student Affairs, Notre Damn Sf1eurity/Police, tho Gender Rdations Cen1.!1r, the Saint Mary's Office of Residence Life, the Athletie Oflke. studenl'i, profes­sors and others. 
The committee's purpose is two­fold: To ensun1 resources arc in place for those who have experi­enced soxwu violence and to edu­cate the community about the reality of sexual violence and how it can be eliminated, Firth said. 
Evenl'i like this week's Sexual Assault Awareness Week are about "encouraging those who have been victimized to speak, seek support ;md come fiwward," Firth said. "That is a very impor­tant and healthy thing." 
Resources are available for all survivors of sexual assault, regardless of how long ago the incident occurred, she said. 
Some survivors are also unsure about whether what happened to them L'i sexual assault, she said. 
But if the ineident involved physical force, emotional abuse, the use of alcohol or any drug ­or if it just 11lt wrong -then the survivor should be talking to someone about it, Rakoczy said. 
When a student undergoes sex­ual assault, the first contact through the University is AssL'itant Dean in the College of Arl'i and Letters Ava Preacher, the University Victim Hesource Person. 
"If someone is in crisis or has experiencnd trauma, it can be dif­ficult to know where to start," Hakoezy said. 
Preacher provides rp.sources so that the survivor can. decide what choices he or she wishes to make, Rackoczy said. 
Preacher was not available for comment thi'i week. 
Notre Dame has a decentralized approach to rape and sexual assault services rather than a rape crisis center. Hesearch shows these are equally effective meth­ods, so long as protocols are fol­lowed, Hakoczy said. 
Resources available to students include S-0-S, the rape cri'iis cen­ter for St. Joseph County. Counseling and therapy arc avail­able at the University Counseling Center, and a confidential, on­campus support group is also available. 
Ava Preacher can be reached at 631-7728. University sexual assault resource information is available online at http://osa.nd.edu/departmentslrap e.shtml

members -has been nothing short of "amazing. I haven't heard a single bad thing about the show," Van Mill said after Thursday's production. 
The reaction Van Mill has observed this year is consistent with the one last year's organ­izers noted. "Loyal Daughters and Sons" used 60 percent of the creative material that made up its predecessor, "Loyal Daughters."

develop the new and Sons" sense that 
something both men and women need to be aware of." 
Three new sketches deal with the male view of sexuality and sexual violence at Notre Dame, including a scene where a male student defended his religiously motivated decision to abstain from having sex with his girlfriend dE1spite pressure from his friends to do the con­trary. 
The second new story fea­tures a homosexual student who is a victim of sexual assault at a party, while the third deals with men who are harassed or seduced against 

material includ­ed in this year's show. Some of those new sto­ries dealt particularly with the male view of the issue -a per­spective Van Mill and director Meghan O'Donoghue wanted to emphasize this year. 
They added the phrase "and Sons" to the original title because they didn't want to alienate men who might think the show is exclusively about women's issues and also because they think it's impor­tant to be open about the role of men in sexual assault cases. 
"The [new] title explicitly shows men are a part of this issue, too," Van Mill said. "And the only way these victims [of sexual violence I -and the entire Notre Dame community -can begin healing these wounds is by being vocal and honest about these issues. Sexual violence happens here, inside our bubble, and that's 
when men try 
to seduce women against their will, it's frowned upon more than when the roles are reversed. 
ln addition to these new sto­ries, "Loyal Daughters and Sons" reused some of the male-oriented material fea­tured in last year's production, which is what originally made then-freshman Kevin Stein want to participate in this year's show. 
"I went to the show last year and thought it was moving and effective in transmitting the message that sexual assault is real at Notre Dame and that it's something that concerns both men and women," Stein said. 
Now a sophomore and an actor in "Loyal Daughters and Sons," Stein said he thinks last year's show was already, in a way, "Loyal Daughters and Sons" because it did a good job presenting all the different people and angles that are affected by the issues. 



"Such a big part of last year's production was that it did include so many stories about men and how they see these issues, and that's why I became interested in joining the cast this year," he said. 
"Loyal Daughters" director, Madison Liddy, said she also thinks that even though last year's show lacked the "and Sons" phrase in its title, the scrjpt did not exclude men from the discussion. 
She said the decision to limit the title to women only was simply driven by the original mission of "Loyal Daughters," which was to give women a voice and a forum where they could discuss sexuality and sexual violence issues. 
And the show succeeded in doing that, she said. 

Liddy said she's noticed "words like 'rape' or 'sexual assault' are much more com­mon on campus now, whereas before last year's production, they were more taboo. 
"And now that Notre Dame has accepted the issue is real and that a discussion of it is needed, the next logical step is to include both genders in the debate, to reconcile them," Liddy said. 

Van Mill said she's noticed more and more all-male groups attending "Loyal Daughters and Sons." 
"You can usually tell if a guy is here simply because his girl­friend or his female friends dragged him," Van Mill said. "But there are a lot of groups of guys that just come to the show not because their girl­friend forced them, but rather because they've heard good things about it or they're just interested in the issue."

Severing the trials of Stewart and Ehrlich from Simpson could be complicated legally. And there remains the possibility that the pair could follow three other eo-defendants who decid­ed to testify against Simpson in hopes of receiving probation for their roles. 
And what of the chance that Simpson himself might seek a plea bargain? Out of the ques­tion, Galanter said. 
"Unless the D.A. gives us an outright dismissal, we will go to trial," he said. "Mr. Simpson is obviously very concerned. These charges are as serious as it gets. But he knows in his heart he is innocent of these charges." 
AI Lasso, a Las Vegas lawyer who followed the proceedings, said the preliminary hearing exposed weaknosses in the case that makns a trial unlik<~ly. 
"What are we to make of this group'! I don't think it's the samo case now that prosecutors thought going in. Now that we've heard their testimony, this case is ripe for a plea deal." 
Armour said the case "has that feel of a den of thievos," which hurts the prosecution "beeause only those who've admitted to being thieves are left to testify against others who're accused of being thieves." 
"A week or two ago, the pros­ecution seemed very invested in the case and confident in the strength of its ease," Armour said. 
"Now that it's been subjected to some serutiny and examina­tion, the prosecutors have to make the following judgment call: Are the ehances of success worth the expense and time and efl'ort of trying these defen­dants given the evidence that has come out?" 
The long legal road to trial continues Nov. 28 with arraign­ment and entry of pleas before a new judge. Motions will be filed and arguments heard for months before the search begins for a new jury -one that will pledge to be fair and impartial and put. aside every­thing they have heard about Simpson and his past.

Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO -A military jury on Thursday sentenced a Marine drill instructor to six months in the brig and gave him a bad-con­duct discharge for abusing 23 recruits. 
Sgt. Jerrod M. Glass also received a reduction in rank to private and pay forfeiture. He had faced a maximum sentence of 10 years of confinement. 
Former colleagues lined up to hug Glass and shake his hand after the verdict 
occurred. He 

was relieved of 
drill instructor duty in February. 
Glass' mother, Barbara Glass, said, "I still believe he did not do anything he was not instructed to do ... by his superiors. If it's denied, I know it's a bald-faced lie by the Marine Corps." 
Glass' father, Jerry Glass, tear­fully criticized the Marines' han­dling of the case. 
"I thought the Marine Corps stood for, 'Leave no man behind,"' he told reporters. "I think they had their head in the sand or they are not being honest with the public." 
Prior to the courts-martial, Glass had been an exemplary Marine, according to both the defense and prosecution. 
Pfc. Bradley Montgomery, 20, who was one of the recruits in Glass' platoon, said the sentence was too harsh. Montgomery testi­fied on behalf of the prosecution under orders. 
"This whole thing is ridiculous," he said. "Sgt. Glass thought of us as his own kids." 
Glass was one of three drill instructors charged with abusing recruits. Sgt. Robert C. Hankins and Sgt. Brian M. Wendel are fac­ing special courts-martial on sep­arate charges. A fourth instructor, Sgt. Joseph Villagomez, received administrative punishment. 
food ingredients, toxic tooth­paste and other products. 
ConAgra's stock gained 24 cents, or about 1 percent, to trade at $23.68 Thursday after­noon. 
Citigroup analyst David Driscoll said in a research note that he doesn't believe the pot pie recall will hurt ConAgra long-term. 
"We believe the favorable res­olution of ConAgra's Banquet salmonella issue eliminates a number of negative scenarios surrounding the stock," Driscoll said. The stock price will likely improve, he said, as ConAgra's restructuring plan moves for­ward. 
But the company still faces several lawsuits related to the recall, which was the second ConAgra recall this year because of salmonella. 
with Glass' sup­porters, including some of the recruits he was accused of abus­ing. 
Earlier, prosecutors recom­mended he spend two years in the brig and receive a bad-con­duct discharge. 
"You need to send the message this is not tolerated," Marine Capt. Brent Sticker told jurors. 
The instructor's attorney had asked jurors to take into account Glass's previous exemplary record and sentence him to 60 days of restricted duty and reduc­tion to a rank of their choice. 
"There's ways to deal with Sgt. Glass without throwing him out," Capt. Greg Jensen said. 
"This wasn't meaningless, senseless violence," Jensen said of the alleged abuse. "It was done with the intent to assist (recruits)."

It's about respect. After every loss, students have stood and cheered while the team trudges into the corner for the alma mater. It's their version of' the helmet raise, showing apprecia­tion for thnir dassmates' ell'orts on the field. But it goes unan­swered, and it's insulting.

But whetlwr the tnam loses Saturday to Dukn or wins and takes a stP.p f'orward toward next season, it can gain much by returning the respect the studt~nts have shown all s1mson. It takes one simple movmnnnt.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Win one for the seniors 
For us seniors, Notre Dame football in our lour years has been an emotional rollercoaster. We were together the first time we watched Notre Dame football as a student body, in stunned disbelief that we could lose to Brigham Young. We were together in Rock's House, or should I say on Hock's House, the following Saturday with a field-storming win over Michigan. We've sat through a cold, rainy, extra-point loss to Boston College, been called "Tiger Bait" God knows how many times, shook down thunder on 4th-and-9 and stood in the field in the endzone as just a few seconds were put back on the clock for USC in '05. But we've also weathered the cold and wind to see one of the greatest games at Michigan State, fallen all over each other at the end of UCLA, felt the adrenaline with a promise of a "nasty" football team and witnessed a gravity-defying jump on a "pass right" play that we later found out was bigger than everything Notre Dame football stands for. 
If I have learned anything from Notre Dame football in four years, it's that we never give up. If I can paraphrase a quote from Blue-Gray Sky, a team puts together a few good plays to make a good half, and two good halves to make a win. String a few of those wins together, and you have a win streak. String a few of those together, and you have a championship. String a few of those together, and you have domi­nance. But at the end of it all, it started with those few good plays, two good halves, and one good game. This sHason may be a loss, but one win can start us on a track that us seniors can look back upon and say, "I was thHre when it started." Send us out right. 
Go Irish, Beat Duke. Stanford, too.

Democrats' language lacks rhetorical rhythm 
While the technical intricacies of lan­guages around the globe are similar, use of language to politically persuade oth­ers is a rhetorical art form. In politics, an argument must be persuasive, visual and memorable. Focus groups have taught poll­sters that a favor­able reaction begins with a con­vincing and mem­orable message. Presently, the Democratic leader­ship on Capitol Hill lacks the adeptness of language that former Republican Sp11aker Newt Gingrich could coin more than a decade ago when he wrestled away control of Congress. 
In all fairness to the Democrats, they arc not void of successful messages. Their "pay as you go" requirement for the budget mandates that any increase in federal spending must be offset within a balanced budget. But unlike Gingrich, Democrats are slow to create rhetorical phrases that better describe their actions and policies. 
Notable Hepublican wordsmiths Karl Hove and Karen Hughes are famous for parsing a single word such as "oil" to "energy," and "parents" to "moms and dads" to bntter solicit support. They helped the president clarify our run-up to the war in Iraq by describing Saddam Hussein as a "grave and gathering threat," not an outright threat. These Hepublican operatives were so skillful at their craft that they even recycled the intense fearful emotions elicited from "a! Qaeda" by proclaiming the existence of "a! Qaeda-like" forces. 


Democrats must remember that suc­cessful rhetoric defines the argument­or in their case, redefines established Republican messages. Last year, this writer managed the Democratic mes­sage delivery for a congressional race in a district that voted out its Republican incumbent. Our strategy focused on using words like "welfare" and "politi­cians," which elicited strong emotions from Republicans who had defined them decades ago. In our campaign, the Democrat could immediately relate to Republican voters by proposing that it was time to "take the Iraqi politicians off of American welfare" and let only Iraqis guard the Green Zone. That way, when "Iraq's politicians" put their own lives on the line, they would be more serious to politically compromise to form a govern­ment. 
Last week the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), legisla­tion designed to protect workers from discrimination based on sexual orienta­tion. Liberal California Democrat and House Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller missed a chance to redefine "special rights" dur­ing the floor debate. Traditionally, con­servatives label any effort which they oppose that specifically addresses dis­crimination as a "special right," imply­ing that the public is somehow denied such extraordinary protections. Conservatives labeled the Equal Rights Amendment of the 1970s a "special right" for women, claiming that women are already covered like the rest of American men under the Constitution. In the 1990s, conservatives once again ignored the fact that a segment of socie­ty faced glass ceilings and unjustified incriminations by labeling anti-discrimi­nation laws based on sexual orientation a "special right." Once more they claimed that gays are covered like the rest of heterosexuals under the Constitution. 
Conservatives dug into their classic rhetorical bag for the ENDA legislation last week. Indiana Congressman Mark Souder claimed that ENDA "set up another class of discrimination, once again pitting sexual discrimination up against the right to practice religious liberty." Souder asserted that faith­based organizations with fidelity clauses against extramarital sex or one man-one woman marriage clauses had no "defense of marriage" in the bill to fol­low their missions. He argued that by not specifically indicating that current marriage laws apply under this legisla­tion, organizations which "have any kind of ministry goal and aren't a profoundly a Christian organization that falls under the very narrow definition of the last amendment, you're in deep trouble here." 
Miller countered that ENDA only pre­vents employers from firing a perfectly qualified employee based on sexual ori­entation. "In fact," Miller said, "I don't see anything anywhere in the text of ENDA that discusses extramarital sex, and I can't understand how Mr. Souder's come to this conclusion about extramar­ital sex. But the entire issue is just a diversion from what ENDA actually does." Astonishingly, Miller concluded that he would actually support the Souder amendment because it would not change the bill, citing sections of the leg­islation that specifically guaranteed existing state law. 
However, Miller missed the perfect opportunity to redefine the long-stand­ing conservative use of "special rights." He could have said to Souder that this was a time when Souder actually advo­cated a special right for something already protected under law. Miller should have emphasized that Souder's defense of marriage was no different than defending women in the 1970s and that a special right seems to be in the eye of the beholder. 
Trivial as the parsing of language may seem, its effects on the American public can determine which political philoso­phy and party governs our lives. As time passes, Democrats will become more skillful during this congressional ses­sion. For if they do not establish their rhetorical rhythm, a "mushroom cloud" of voter discontent will declare "mission accomplished" next year.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
More to life than sex 
I'm writing in response to all the uproar over the "Gay? Go to Hell" shirts. especially Nikki Huiras's letter ("Re-evaluating 'teachings' on homosexuality," Nov. 15). First, let me being by saying that the people wearing these shirts were executing an abominable act. It's appalling that there are people on this campus who actually seek for another human being to be condemned to hell. The Church in its holy authori­ty does not even condemn people to hell, recognizing that God alone has that ability. We, as Christians, are called to love. Wishing that someone be damned for eternity, away from the loving embrace of God. is entirely contrary to what Christianity would ever hope to accomplish. 
After reading the responses to Mary Daly's excellent letter concern­ing the Church's teaching on homosexuality ("Campus, Catholicism, and homosexuality," Nov. 13), it became apparent to me that a deep misunderstanding is present among those who chastise the Church's position on the issue. It becomes very easy to separate a homosexual person from the homosexual acts when we realize that sexuality is not the quintessence of human joy. A human can live a completely fulfilling, actualized, and happy life without utilizing his sexuality. It is common to find those who believe that homosexual intercourse is acceptable, agreeing that masturbation and pornography are natural, even healthy, outlets of a person's sexuality. The contrary is true. Chastity breeds greater respect for oneself and others, especially those whom the person loves romantically. The Church recognizes this fact, which is precisely why priestly celibacy is such a facet of church life. Thus, the Church, through encouraging homosexuals to a life of celibacy, is working toward bringing them greater happiness, rather than denying them enjoyment. 
Additionally, I would like to point out that we are perfectly able to decide that actions are evil, but not people. Indeed, in every case when bad actions are present, we are called to have even greater mercy, forgiveness, and love for the person. Why else is the phrase "Hate the sin, not the sinner?" so familiar to us on a Catholic cam­pus? Indeed, in almost every circumstance, there are mitigating fac­tors diminishing the person's culpability. Nonetheless, we as Christians and as members of a functioning society have the ability and right to say that a particular action is against moral code. Without this ability, we could have no law. The moral relativism that questions our ability to decide that extra-marital sexual activity is wrong also, when consistently understood, would lead us to question our ability to say that theft, rape, and murder are wrong, if for no other reason than that the people committing these crimes feel ful­filled by doing them. 
Nathan Loyd junior Keough Hall Nov. 15 

Normalcy based on perception 
The vast majority of human beings are heterosexual. (Surprising, I know!) In fact, it is estimated that only three percent of the population are born homosexual. We are a minority, but we are not abnormal. 
Normality is a funny thing. Social norms are constructed by society, and those who adhere most closely to those norms run soci­ety. They are created by those in power and are used to sustain their dominance. That leaves us with a whole bunch of white, upper class, heterosexual men telling women not to vote, telling blacks not to go to school, and telling homosexuals that they should "Go to Hell." Homosexuality is uncommon. Rarity, however, does not imply that something is disordered. 
Homosexuality is a product of natural forces, both biological and social. Variation is a normal part of the natural world. It is a natural, normal variation. The Church made it abnormal only through its teachings. What all this means is that homosexuality is as normal as heterosexuality. It's just less com­mon. The only reason people think homosex­uality is bad is because society tells them it is. We call this social ideology "heteronor­mativity," a word that refers to the margin­alization and devaluing of the homosexual and homosocial experience. The Catholic Church reveals itself at a heteronormative institution when it perpetuates this myth that homosexuality is "deviant" and "disor-· dered." Heterosexuals are pretty much in charge of everything, in particular the gov­ernment and the Church. (But, not MTV!) Heterosexuals shape, construct and define what is normal and "ordered." The Catholic Church presupposes that the natural "order" of things is reproduction. They're heteronor­mative. The Church ignores that three per­cent of the population was created in God's image to have sex and fall in love with peo­ple of the same gender. Only if you ignore that many sexual practices are not intended for reproduction can you reduce the purpose of sexuality down to reproduction. 
The heterosexual patriarchy of the Church ignores minorities and oppresses them through its construction of normality. If the Church was run by a bunch of gay men, then the natural "order" of things might have been Project Runway on Wednesdays and 80's dance parties on Fridays. But, it wasn't. So instead the natural "order" of our society is that women don't get to be priests and that homosexuals are "disordered," at least from the myopic perspective of an archaic, inflexible religious institution.

Calling to mind 90s alt-roek groups like Blind Melon and the Cranbt~rries while still f(~eling as modern as bands likt~ MusP, the Portland. On~gon-based band Charmpartieles has ernatnd a eompnlling mix of strong !-,'1litar hooks and etlwreal vocals on iL<> first full-length album, "Alivn in the llot Spell." The band has only a handful of prior ndeases, and this one feels just right. Thern's something almost addictive about this album, and hopt{ully it isn't the 11L'>t Charmpartides creation to hit the Billboard charL<>. 
Originally, the Charmparticles lirwup centered on the harmonious pairing of singer/bassist Pamela Hooney and fellow vocalist Adam Wayne. With Wayrw's recent departure, however, Hoorwy's voeals are rounded out by drummer Nathaneal Merrill and guitarist Sarah Fitzgerald. Despite any linnup ehang«~s. the band's sound doesn't (bel uneven or shaky, and Hooney's vocals an~ morn than strong enough to carry the weight of each song.

While tho loss to their next-door rival did hurt, Burns also said his team's experience will give the Knights the all-important mental edge. Knnmm ha<; made the playoii'l in mu:h of the pa'lt three years, win­ning a d11unpion'ihip in 2004 and los­ing in the finals in 2005. 
Whiln there will be some nerves, Burns said, the extremely experi­enced juniors and seniors on the te~Ull will b.\ (',onfident tmd ealm. 
"!The upperda'lsimml have defi­nitely helped a lot," Burns said. "They'vn told ll'l what to OXplX:t They know what's going on this whole week tUJd thats a littln bit of <m edge [we havnl over SUU1fiJrd. The [under­dm;smnnl won't b.\ as Ulken up and 11my'll b.~ mady to play."

The mcent expl1rience in the "pres­sure-cooker" along with a good te1Uil attitude, lluth S1tid, should Ulk11 care of most of the nerves on the Griffin<;' sidelirm 
"Overall the team's pretty laid back," lluth S1tid. "I don't see a prob-Jem a<; fhr a<; being nervotL'l. For the seniors, it being tile last time putting on the pads \\<ill be a big [source ofl motivation. For everyone else, there \\<ill be motivation in the fact that you never know when you'll get back there. 'Ihere'll be jitters; I'd be lying if I S1tid there weren't any, but tlmy'll definitely be a more positive factor than a negative." 
In terms of game strategy, both teams have their idea<> frurly well-for­mulated from tl1e sea'l<m. Burns said m()!,i of the Knighb' suc.cess thi'l year stems from their def(msive prowess. He pointed to Kl1fman's 7-0 semilffial victory over Sieglhed a'i an exan1ple oftim def(m..<;e making thing; easy on the ollim'iC. 
The game was so dose early bec.atL<;<l the offem;e was a littlP slug­gish tllat !fdllle," he said. "[But] our dPfen..<;e wa'i playing so well we didn't think we ne{rled to take any big ri'lks on oll'en..<;<l. A lot of cmdit goes to the Siegfried ddiJn..<>e, too. 'lhey played a great gan1e." 
I Iutll S1tid the Grilliit'l are looking to stick to tl1e same plan from earlier in the year to beat Keenan -stop the run and f(m:e the opJXment into pass­ing situations. With that. in mind, Stanfbrd's pnu:tiees have focused on deaning up some coverage issues the coaches noticed in. the te1Ulls' first ml1flting. 
Other than that, the captain said hn'll b.~ looking to Costanzo (a former varsity walk-on), S1nith, senior receiv­er Matt Frankenfeld, and senior defensive end Matt Templemire to step up like they have all year. 
He added that a win over a te1Uil like KPenan will go beyond rivalry as something of a signature victory to cap off a perfect season for the Griffins. 
"Even before you get on the field and play them it's a rivalry betwl1fm the dorms," 1Jutl1 s1Lid.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL 
Cavanaugh challenges dominant Welsh Fam 
By SAM WERNER Sports Wrirer 
Welsh Family and Cavanaugh took different routes to the Stadium, but both will enter Sunday's game with only one goal in mind. 
"Our season will be complete when we win," Welsh Family captain Kelly Bushelle said. 
"We're going to come out from the beginning and play with all we've got," Cavanaugh captain Lizzy Brown said. 
It may take all the Chaos have to defeat the top-seeded Whirlwinds, who are 8-0 this season and have throttled their previous three opponents by a combined score of 59-0. Bushelle, though, refused to focus on her team's impressive record. · 
"We're really proud of what wn've done," Bushelle said. "But we're not thinking about the past. We're just thinking about Cavanaugh on Sunday." 
The No. 6 seed Chaos have 
_already shown that they're capable of an upset, defeating No. 2 seed Pangborn 18-6 in the first round of the playoffs. They followed that performance with a 12-0 win over Farley in the semifinals. Brown was confi­dent her team won't be intimi­dated by the Whirlwinds. 
"You can only focus on the sP.eds so much," Brown said. "On Sunday at noon, records aren't going to matter. Whoever plays harder is going to come out with a win." 
The Chaos usually receive a strong performance from its defense, which has come up big in their first two playoff games. In the semifinals, Cavanaugh constantly forced Farley into fourth-and-long situations and forced several key turnovers, a trend it hopes to continue on Sunday. 
"Turnovers are absolutely essential to victory," Brown said. "We're going to be looking for interceptions and hopefully our great defensive line can get some big plays for negative yards." 
The Chaos defense will cer­tainly be tested against Welsh Family's offense, led by junior quarterback Jenny Gargula. Gargula has thrown four touch­down passes in the playoffs, despite playing with a torn bicep. Bushelle was reluctant to attribute her team's success to one side of the ball despite the fact that Welsh Family scored 21 points per game this season. 
"We've really worked well on everything, both offense and defense," Bushelle said. "I can't really pick out one thing that's been the reason for our suc­cess." 
Cavanaugh will be the first new opponent the Whirlwinds face in the playoffs after already defeating both Lyons and Pasquerilla West in the reg­ular season. Bushelle wasn't concerned about the lack of familiarity. 
"We're not really worried [that we haven't played them before]," Bushelle said. "They haven't played us either, so it goes both ways." 
The Chaos may not have seen Welsh Family's talented squad in person yet this season, but Brown certainly knows what her team is going up against on Sunday. 
"They've got a talented quar­terback and a number of great receivers," Brown said. "It's going to come down to getting acclimated after the first couple of plays and seeing what we can exploit." 
Since they have never played each other before, both cap­tains focused on the importance of making strategy changes during the game to take advan­tage of any holes in their oppo­nent's game plan. 
"We're not going to make huge adjustments," Bushelle said. "But the key is just seeing what Cavanaugh brings and exploiting their weaknesses." 
It may take both teams a while to settle in to the new atmosphere of Notre Dame Stadium before they can worry about strategy. No player on the Welsh Family team has ever played in the Stadium before. The senior class for Cavanaugh reached the Stadium in 2004, its freshman year, falling to Walsh in the finals. 
"Fortunately we were there in 2004," Brown said. "We know what it's like in the Stadium, so we're looking at it like just another game." 
Bushelle acknowledged her team's championship inexperi­ence, but did not think it would have an adverse effect on its chances Sunday. 
"Even though no one our team has played in the Stadium before, we'll definitely come out focused and ready," Bushelle 
said. Brown also emphasized the importance of a strong start to . gain momentum. 
"It's really going to start with coming out and playing hard in the first couple of minutes," Brown said. "It's going to be a

Cavanaugh coach Aidan Fitzgerald credits football with saving his life. 
"Had it not been for an injury I sustained while playing Interhall football, I would never have taken the CT scan that offered the first clue that I had stage II cancer," Fitzgerald said.

"But I realized that it was not a joke this time," said Fitzgeral«t. a sophomore. 
Almost a year later, having undergone two surgeries, nine 
weeks of chemotherapy, and hundreds of needles, Fitzgerald made his return to Notre Dame and to football. 
Now he is back on the sidelines of Cavanaugh, inspir­ing the Cinderella story of this sea­son. And Cavanaugh wants this victory for its coach and the team. Cavanaugh credits much of its success to Fitzgerald, its fered a torn left (non-throwing) bicep in a car accident over fall break.

"I cannot say enough about Jenni," Kaiser said. 
Gargula played for most of the game, enduring intense pain in her left arm. 
"The pain was worse some­times than at others," Gargula said. "I just focused on what I was doing, not on the arm. I wanted to get a big enough lead so that I could rest at the end of the game." 
When asked why she endured the pain and risked further injury, Kaiser's answer was simple. 
"Her stubborn nature," he said. Gargula's answer to the same question was even simpler. "I hate to lose," she said.

When Barry Bonds hit his 756th home run on Aug. 7, a 435-foot blast off of Washington Nationals pitcher Mike Bacsik, he passed Hank Aaron as the all-time home run king. It struck me as a shame. Aaron was a model of humility, poise and courage, while Bonds is a big-headed and acidic slugger. It is even more of a shame now, as Barry Bonds was indicted Thursday for perjury and obstruction of justice charges. 
Bonds' home run title has always been just a touch fishy. He entered the Major Leagues at 6-foot-2 and 
about 185 pounds. By 2001, he weighed in at 228 and had gone from a fleet-footed base­stealer to a power­slugger, capable of sweeping any ball off the plate and into the stands. 
And now Bonds is not just a cheater, as he already was in the eyes of mil­lions of baseball fans who believe he took steroids. He is also a liar. In fact, the man who owns his record-setting home run ball said 
he wants to enter it into the hall of fame with a large asterisk drawn on it. If that happens, Bonds has said, he will never visit the Hall of Fame or have anything to do with the Cooperstown monument again. Fortunately for him, it looks like he won't have to worry about it. That is he won't unless the federal peniten­tiary has a field trip day. 
I think Bonds deserves a different brand of punishment though; jail just doesn't quite do it for me. I suggest the following alternatives. 
+He takes himself out of the run­ning for anything having to do with the Hall of Fame, and every one of his records and awards is taken away. He spends the rest of his days more than any other professional sports

removed from all 
the record books and history of baseball guides. His jerseys should be burned or thrown away. The media should never write another article about him again, and he can waste away in obscurity, where he belongs. 
I'm glad that Bonds is finally get­ting his. He has been indicted on four counts of perjury and one obstruc­tion of justice for telling a federal grand jury he did not knowingly use performance enhancing drugs. Our justice system is going to work. Unfortunately for Aaron, it's a few months too late.

going door-to-door and apologizing to every pitcher he hit a juiced-up home run off. 
+It is a common belief that steroids can cause one's cranium to swell. So I would suggest a form of torture for Bonds. Nothing awful here, but this is my idea -he has to remain standing in one spot until he eventually collapses under the weight of his own swollen head. 
+He has to spend the rest of his life as the personal servant of each and every person who ever paid to see Bonds play. Need your car washed? Call Bonds. Back rub? Bonds is your man.

CoA1PlUD FROM THE OBSERVER'S WIRE SERVICES 
MLB 
Associated Press 

SAN FRANCISCO -Barry Bonds, baseball's home run king, was indicted for per­jury and obstruction of jus­tice Thursday and could face prison instead of the Hall of Fame for telling a federal grand jury he did not know­ingly use performance­enhancing drugs. 
The indictment, culminat­ing a four-year investigation into steroid use by elite ath­letes, charged Bonds with four counts of perjury and one of obstruction of justice. If convicted, he could be sentenced to a maximum of 30 years in prison. 
Shortly after the indict­ment was handed up, Bonds' personal trainer, Greg Anderson, was ordered released after spending most of the past year in prison for refusing to testify against his longtime friend. 

"During the criminal investigation, evidence was obtained including positive tests for the presence of anabolic steroids and other performance enhancing substances for Bonds and other athletes," the indict­ment said. 
In August, when the 43­year-old Bonds passed Hank Aaron to become baseball's career home run leader, he flatly rejected any sugges­tion that this milestone was stained by steroids. 
"This record is not tainted 
IN BRIEF 

Padres' Peavy unanimous 
choice for NL Cy Young 
NEW YORK -Jake Peavy has been one of the best pitchers in the National League for years. This season, he pulled away from the pack. 
The San Diego Padres ace was an unanimous winner of the NL Cy Young Award on Thursday after leading the league in wins, ERA and strikeouts. 
"It was just one of those seasons where kind of everything came togeth­er," he said on a conference call. 
Peavy received all 32 first-place votes and finished with 160 points in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Arizona sinkerballer Brandon Webb, last year's winner, was a distant runner-up with 94 points. He was listed second on 31 ballots and third on one. 
"Obviously, I was elated. This is as big as it gets as far as individual awards," Peavy said. "Truly amazing. A very humbling day when you think about all my peers that take the mound every fifth day." 
at all. At all. Period," Bonds said. 
Bonds finished the year with 762 homers, seven more than Aaron, and is currently a free agent. In 2001, he set the season record with 73 home runs. 
Late in the season, the San Francisco Giants told the seven-time National League MVP they didn't want him back next year. 
Bonds could not immedi­ately be reached for com­ment. One of his attorneys, John Burris, didn't know of the indictment before being alerted by The Associated Press and said he would call Bonds to notify him. 
''I'm surprised," Burris said, "but there's been an 
page 17 
effort to get Barry for a long time. I'm curious what evi­dence they have now they didn't have before." 
Bonds' defense attorney, Mike Rains, declined com­ment because he hadn't seen a copy of the indict­ment. 
"However, it goes without saying that we look forward to rebutting these unsup­ported charges in court," Rains said. "We will no doubt have more specific comments in the very near future once we have had the opportunity to actually see this indictment that took so long to generate." 
Bonds is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on Dec. 7. 

Troubled 'Pacman' gets plea
deal in exchange for testimony 
LAS VEGAS -A judge accepted a plea deal Thursday reducing felony charges against suspended NFL player Adam "Pacman" Jones to a gross mis­demeanor that will get him probation in return for his testimony about a strip club triple shooting. 
The Tennessee Titans cornerback did not appear before Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Tony Abba tangelo, who accepted the written agreement and waived Jones' preliminary hearing on two felony coercion charges. 
Abbatangelo scheduled Jones to plead no contest Dec. 5 in state court to one charge of conspiracy to commit disorderly conduct. 
Jones will be sentenced later to one year of probation, Clark County prose­cutor Victoria Villegas said after a brief hearing. Two charges of coercion, a felony carrying a possible sentence of one to six years in prison, will be dropped. 
Williams welcomed back by
Dolphins, will practice Monday 
DAVIE, Ha. -Ricky Williams stood at a window in the Miami Dolphins' player lounge and watched the start of praetir,e as he chomped on an apple, so close to an NFL return he could taste it. 
Coach Cam Cameron decided Thursday to welcome Williams back, and he'Ll be on the field ~iarting with Monday's workout. His first game in nearly two years could come a week later, Nov. 26 at Pittsburgh. 
"He'll be a member of this team," C'.ameron said. "He's a Miami Dolphin." 
Again. 

Williams has tested positive for marijuana at least four times since the Dolphins acquired him in 2002. Miami's franchise­record playoff drought began that same year. 
But it's difficult to imagine how Williams could sabotage a team that's 0-9, and so the long, strange trip continues. Cameron said his players favored Williams' return from the suspension, and the 2002 NFL rushing champion embraced yet another fresh start

ND grad Grant finds home with Green Bay 
Tailback reminds his teannnates offornzer Packer Dorsey Levens 
Associated J>ress 
GHJ·:J<:N BAY-Bn·tt Favrn can't 
lwlp doing a double-take wlwn he 
looks at GrnPn Bay Packnrs run­
ning bark Hyan (;rcmt. 

Trun. Grant is a lilrmPr undrall­Pd fn~e agnnt who was sent to (;rnpn Bay by tlw New York GianLs just bdiwn tlw start of thn season -and thn Packers' lilurth choke to be their starting running back. 
But Favrn still sees liwmer team­mate Dorsey Lewns. It starls with tlw liut that Grant wears Levens' old jersey number, 

25. but there's more to it: the 6­lilOt-1 frame. the powerful running styli~. and even thf1 Notre Dame 1:onne1:tion. 
"The numbnr obviously is strik­ing from that standpoint," Favre said. "But he is a big, physical back, deceptivf1ly fast. lie kind of sneaks up on you. I think his role in our passing game can evolve into what Dorsey's role with us W1L'>. But he does rmnind me a lot of him." 
Packers coach Mike McCarthy sees it, too. 
"As far as their frame, tlwir his­tory. their background, as far as whnro he played eolll~ge, there arn a lot of' similarities," McCarthy said. "Brntt said it tl1e first week he W<L'> horn." 
Grant certainly appreeiates the comparisons to Levens, a key play­nr on thn Packers' playoll' teams of the late 1990s. 
llny, it beats being overlooked and injurnd for two years in New York. 
But at the same time, Grant doesn't think a pair of 1 00-yard rushing games should be enough to anoint him as the nnxt, wnll, anyone. 
"I know what Dorsey did here," Grant said. "He wa.s a great back, and what he accomplished was very big. So I definitely appreciate it. llon1~stly, I don't know if I'm dnsnrving of it." 
Deserving or not, Grant is the dosnst thing the Packers have to a rnliabln running baek right now. And as the weather takes a turn liw the worse at Lambeau Field, a revival of one of the lnague's worst running games would help the Packers position themselves for the playoffs. 
(irant says the running game is eoming around, even if he isn't willing to take the credit. 
"Brett's been playing great all season, and we fee~ like we're in the position to kind of build momentum to kind of take a little prnssure off him," Grant said. 
The Packers have been trying to lind a running back to help Favre out all season, without much suc­eess. 
Alter Ahman Green sibrned with llouston as a free agnnt, projected starter Vernand Mornncy hurt his knee in the first practice of train­ing camp and has been limited mostly to third-down duty this year. 
Second-round rookie Brandon Jackson started the first three games and sputtered, then hurt his shin. Seventh-round rookie DeShawn Wynn started the next four games and showed some abil­ity, but hurt his shoulder in the Packers' Oct. 29 game at Denver. 


Grant, who had carried the ball six times all season, replaced Wynn, carrying the ball 22 times for 104 yards against the Broncos' subpar run defense. Grant got his shot at starting in the Packers' next game at Kansas City, but gained only 55 yards on 29 carries. 
Then came Sunday's game against Minnesota, where Grant gained 119 yards on 25 carries and scored his first career touch­down against one of the league's best run defenses. 
"It's only really been three games," Grant said. "I don't look at it as success." 
But it's more than the Packers could have hoped for after sending a late-round 2008 draft pick to New York for Grant on Sept. 1. 
As an undralted free agent out of Notre Dame -Levens played at Notre Dame, too, before transfer­ring to Georgia Tech -Grant sigm~d with the Giants in 2005 and spent his first year on the practice squad. Grant then hurt his lumd in the ollseason and spent 2006 on injured resPrve. He calls his time in New York a learning experi­ence. 
"Especially being behind Tiki BarbPr, I learned a lot being with him every day on and off the field," Grant said. "It let me know that I was hungry, and I still loved the game."

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Hart, Henne get last crack at OSU 
Associated Press 
ANN ARBOR -Mike Hart did not guarantee a win over Ohio State, a La Jim Harbaugh a cou­ple decades ago. 
Michigan coach Lloyd Carr chose not to give him a chance to open his mouth when the week of hype kicked ofT. 
The star running back with shifty moves and loose lips was not among the players Carr made available for interviews, living up to a prediction Hart heard from a reporter. 
"He better let me come next Monday. It's the last one," Hart said last week. "He might not let me because I might say some­thing stupid." 
Such as? 
Guaranteeing a win over Notre Dame or referring to Michigan State as a little broth­er, as Hart did this year? 
Proclaiming things would be "different" if the Wolverines had a rematch with Ohio State, as Hart did last season, adding its defense wasn't "as good as peo­ple thought," after losing last year'! 
Yeah, something like that. 
Hart, Chad Henne and Jake Long turned down a chance to make money in the NFL this year, returning for their senior seasons in part for another shot at the Buckeyes. 
The trio's wait is almost over. 
No.7 Ohio State (10-1, 6-1 Big Ten) will match up with No. 23 Michigan (8-3, 6-1) Saturday in Ann Arbor with the outright Big Ten title at stake. 
For Hart, Henne and Long, their legacies will be on the line, too. 
They are arguably the best running back, quarterback and offensive tackle the Wolverines have ever had, quite an accom­plishment at college football's winningest program. 
But if they go 0-4 against the Buckeyes, it will add a perma­nent blemish on what is other­wise a flawless resume on and off the field. The trio is also 0-3 in bowl games. 
Long made the biggest gamble financially when he chose to come back because he likely would've been a top-five pick. 
The offensive tackle insisted a win wouldn't validate his deci­sion. 
"That's not what this game is about," he bristled. "This game is about this team, about this championship. It's not about me. I'm not even worried about that." 
In the preseason, however, Long agreed that it was fair to say the trio's legacy would be diminished without a win against Ohio State or a bowl opponent. 
"No matter what type of sea­son we have, people are going to look at what we do against Ohio State and our bowl opponent," Long said in August. 
While the trio's mark against the Buckeyes will always be remembered, each player has also accomplished a lot of things that can't be taken away. 
Hart is Michigan's career rushing leader with 4,867 yards, ranking fifth in Big Ten history, and has run for at least 100 yards in the eight games he has been healthy enough to start this season. A high-ankle sprain has sidelined him for about 3? 
games. 
Henne holds school records with 9,274 yards passing and 84 touchdown passes. He added to his lore last month by playing with a separated shoulder at Illinois, helping the Wolverines rally for a 27-17 win. The injury kept Henne off the field for much of last week's loss at Wisconsin and out of a game three weeks ago. 
Long was the first of five play­ers The Associated Press listed earlier this year as players wor­thy of Heisman Trophy consider­ation, but with no shot to win it. The 6-foot-7, 315-pound tackle has routinely punished defen­sive linemen and linebackers to pave the way for Hart, and it's difficult to recall a sack being his fault. 
Carr is quick to rave about the trio as players and people. 
"They've been everything a coach could want in a player and as a representative of this program on and off the field," he said. "When you look at three guys, all of whom could have left early to go on to the draft, and they all came back. To me, that speaks for the fact that they love their experience here. 
"They're all going to graduate. And they're all going to be very, very successful when they leave Michigan." 
Before Hart cut off any Ohio State-related questions last week, he did provide hint about how important it is to him to finally beat the Buckeyes. 
"Everyone knows already how bad I want to win that game," 
he said.  ''I'm going  to  give  
everything I've  got in  that  
game."

But despite their struggles in the relays against the Panthers, the Irish still found individual sueccss. Senior Caroline Johnson won two events -the 1 ()()-and 200­yard backstroke -while

Irish are smiling, but for how long? 

By ELLYN MICHALAK Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's successful flnal conference weekend put a smile on senior captain Adrianna Stasiuk's face, and Stasiuk hopes she's still smil­ing after the Irish face No. 5 seed Cincinnati today in the first round of the Big East tournament. 
"[Last] weekend had to have been my favorite [Notre Dame] weekend of all my four years," she said. "We are all so pleased with how we played and of how we fought against Cincinnati and Louisville." 
The Irish faced off against the Bearcats last Saturday. Senior setter Ashley Tarutis led the offense with six kills and 51 assists, and Notre Dame's outstanding defense earned a 3-1 victory (31-33, 30-23, 30-28, 30-20) that guaranteed the Irish entry into this year's league tourna­ment. 
"Our blocking was outstand­ing, and our scrappy defense kept the ball alive [during the Cincinnati match]," Stasiuk said. 
Last Sunday, Louisville made the trip to South Bend to com­pete against the Irish in front of 1,511 fans. The Irish domi­nated the match with 11 kills and 11 digs from Stasiuk and a match-hig\1 58 assists from Tarutis. Notre Dame beat Louisville 3-1 (30-28, 30-16, 25-30, 30-28). 
"We outworked our oppo­
nents and played intelligent­ly," sophomore outside hitter Megan Fesl said. "We really executed our game plan well and just had fun playing. I think the fun and excitement of each match really helped us the most." 
The weekend brought top awards for two Irish players. Fesl received player of the week honors from the Big East and freshman middle blocker Kellie Sciacca won her third rookie of the week recognition. Together the two swept the Big East honors for the week. 
This weekend, the Irish will travel to Marquette to begin competition in the Big East tournament against the Bearcats. Irish coach Debbie Brown and her players plan on improving their offensive tactics to defeat the Bearcats for the second time this sea­son, Fesl said. 
"This week in practice, we are focusing on making our side of the net better, and also on slowing down some of Cincinnati's plays that hurt us the flrst time around," Fesl said. 
The match begins at 11 a.m. today at Marquette. If the Irish beat Cincinnati, they will compete Saturday in the Big East semifinals. 
"We just have to focus on one match at a time," Stasiuk said. "We have to look at the improvements we can make to ensure our win."

ND begins grueling S-gan1e stretch 
By DAN MURPHY 
Associate Sports Editor 
No. I 0 Notre Dame kicks ofT a very busy holiday week tonight with a home game against Western Michigan at 7:35 p.m. in the Joyce Center. 
Thn Irish will play a horne­and-home series with the Broncos this weekend, and a Tuesday night game against Bowling Grnen bdorn heading to Troy, N.Y., for the Hensselanr Iloliday Tournament. When all is said and done, the t11am will have played five games in a span of only nine days. 
''I'm a little nervous about it, but wn have the best strength couch in the country so I know we are in good shape physical­ly," Irish coach .lefT Jackson said. "We'll probably take a day oiT in the next week but we have to get through these first two games. These will bl' up-tempo games." 
Notrn Damn is already coming ofT of an emotionally draining weekend in Oxford, Ohio, where the Irish split a two-game series with No. 1 Miami on the road. 
"We'rn all excited to get back on track after a tough weekend against Miami," junior goal­tnnder Jordan Pearce said. "We saw a lot of positives and they kind of exploited some of our weaknesses, too." 
Pearct\ turned away 64 of 68 shots last weekend against the most potent ollense in the coun­try, with 40 goals in their first night games. 
"There was such a great crowd and atmosphere, it's tough to not get up for a game like that," Pearce said. 
Despite its 3-5 record, Western Miehigan has the potential to fill up the net. 
.Jackson described the Broncos 


QUENTIN STENGERfThe Observer Irish right wing Erik Condra scores a goal during Notre Dame's 4-1 win over Lake Superior State Nov. 2 in the Joyce Center. 
oiTense as "high-flying" and said his team needed to improve its forechecking to slow down the fast-paced attack. The speedy Broncos are led by playmaker Patriek Gallivan. The right wing has 10 assists and a goal eight games into his junior campaign. 
"He's a very skilled player. He's got great instincts, he thinks [through] the game extremely well," Jackson said. 
Gallivan is averaging 1.38 points per game, which is good enough for third in the CCHA behind Nebraska-Omaha's Bryan Marshall (1.57) and Michigan State's Tim Kennedy 
(1.5). 

The highest Notre Dame play­er on that list is junior right wing Erik Condra, with ten points through the first 11 games for the Irish. Four of those points have come as a part of the streak Notre Dame power­play. 
Notre Dame has been deadly at times with the man advan­tage, but at other times it has failed to produce. In last Saturday's loss to Miami, the Irish had two key powerplays early in the third period that could have tied the game, but the Irish failed to convert. 

"We've been all or nothing it seems like," Jackson said. "One of the keys is not losing our emo­tion. It's not a matter of how many powerplay goals we score, it's a matter of when we score them." 
Jackson said part of that will go away as the young unit gains experience on the ice. The Irish currently play four sophomores and a junior on their No. 1 pow­erplay line and two freshmen on the second unit. 
But the young Irish should get plenty of experience over the next nine days.

Reigning champs knock off Kings 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES -The defending Stanley Cup cham­pion Anaheim Ducks finally seem to be building up some steam. 
Corey Perry had two goals and an assist, and Chris Kunitz added three assists to lead the Ducks to a 6-3 win over the Los Angeles Kings on Thursday night. 
The victory, the Ducks' sec­ond over Los Angeles in three nights, gave them their first three-game winning streak of the season. 
"There's definitely some­thing building," Perry said. "When you start a streak, guys get more confidence and things start going your way. That's what we've got to keep working on -playing our game and keep playing the same way on the road as we do at home. 
"Everybody knows their role and everybody's doing their job. When you've got 23 guys on the same page, you're going to be successful. We're just starting to bond together now and starting to play a lit­tle bit better." 
Perry scored his first goal while fighting for position in front of the Kings' net, and the second in a quite different manner, on a breakaway. 
"You've got to go into those dirty areas, which are where a lot of goals are scored," he said of his second-period goal when he redirected a pass from Kunitz into the net. 
"So if you're getting in there and getting your nose dirty, you're going to get rewarded and some are going to go in ofT you." 
Kunitz set him up for his next goal when he made a long pass between defenders and Perry skated in alone to beat Jean-Sebastien Aubin. 
Aubin and Dueks counter­part Jean-Sebastien Ciguere each made 26 saves. 
Ryan Gntzlaf broke a 2-2 tie when he jammed the puck past the sprawling Aubin at 
2:08 of the third. The Kings' goalie blocked a shot by Perry, Kunitz took a couple of whacks at the puck ncar the left post, and it trickled across the crease to Getzlaf. The goal was his seventh. 
Brad May gave the Ducks a two-goal pad when he scored on a backhand in the crease at 
8:31 of the period. Anaheim made it 5-2 on Samuel Pahlsson's goal with 9:05 to play. 
After Patrick O'Sullivan scored the Kings' third goal, with 3:19 rema111mg, Anaheim's Hob Niedermayer capped the scoring with a long. bouncing shot into an empty net with 42 seconds remaining. 
Anaheim coach Handy Carlyle obviously was pleased with the win, saying, "It's a divisional foe and our biggest rival, so it's always nice to beat them. They've played us competitively ever since I've been coaching in Anaheim, so there's no easy ones. And by no means was this easy tonight."

Mangan and Vroom will not only have to deal with a stingy Notre Dame defense tonight, but also poor weather condi­tions. It rained all day Thursday in Connecticut and there is a chance for high winds and snow during the game.

Playing the Muhawks, Broy said. will provide the Irish with experience against the offense beforo they face it later in the season. 
"Wn're going to see Cnorgetown run that stuff," he said. 
If the Irish get by Monmouth, they will play Sunday against the winner of" Baylor and Wichita State. If Notre Dame losos, it will play Saturday against the loser of the Baylor­Wiehita State matchup. 
If tho Irish can win both of' those games, they will advance to the tournament champi­onship game on Monday. The likely opponnnt in that game is Georgia Tech or Winthrop. The Eagles eliminated the Irish from last season's NCAA Tournament. 
Also participating in the tournament this weekend are Charlotte and Illinois-Chicago. The 49ers will take on the Yellow Jackets in the first round, while the Flames will take on Winthrop. 
Notre Dame will play Monday regardless of its performance in the first two games of the tournament. Depending on how many games the Irish win, they will eithM play in the championship, third-place, firth-place or seventh-place game.

Irish coach Handy Waldrum said with both tP.ams as hot as they are, the game may come down to chanee. 
"It could be deeided on things like free kicks," Waldrum said. "Corner kicks,

And then there are intan­gibles. 
"The other things [are I which team is going to come with the most heart and intensity," 

Hamblers have allowed only two goals. Waldrum said that. when facing sueh a tough defense, his team needs to control the ball and take advantage of any and all scor­ing opportunities -even those that may not appear to be the most promising.

The winner of tonight's match will face either Illinois or Louisville -who play here tonight at 5 -on Alumni Field Sunday at 1 p.m. 
But the Irish aren't looking past Loyola. In the past four games, the 
game and has a . 784 save per­centage in 20 appearances. 
Dougherty and the Loyola defense will face an Irish offense that averages 2.46 goals on 17.6 shots per game. Junior forward Kerri llanks leads the Irish with 13 goals and 15 assists, and forward Brittany Bock has 12 goals of her own. Hanks has scored a point in 12 eonseeutive games. 
Loyola forward Cynthia Morote-Ariza leads the Hamblers with 17 goals and 43 points, both single-season school records. Ariza, the Horizon League player of the yoar, presents a challenge for thn Irish defense. 
"She is the real deal. She's having a grnat year," Waldrum said. "She's a dover, kind of a creative typo player. She's very good on the ball. She's dearly someone we're going to have to pay dose attention to." 
Notre Dame has won two NCAA championships, one in 1995 and the othor in 2004. The Irish are 32-3-0 in NCAA Tournament games played on Alumni Field.

Notn~ Danw is 12-1 in its last 13 gamns, while Loyola­Chicago is 12-:~-1 since Sept. 21. 
Sonwthing has to give tonight when the Harnblnrs face the Irish on Alumni Field at 7:30 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.

Players to get some sun, experience at island event

Notre Dame is spnnding almost a full week in the Virgin Islands, hut Irish head coach Mikn Brcy isn't worried about his team losing focus. 
"Part of keeping them loose is having a little beach time," Bnly said. "All of a sudden you shoot a little better when you've been on the beach." 
Notre Dame will compete in the Paradise Jam tournament, hosted by The University of the Virgin Islands today through Monday on the island of St. Thomas. 
With three crucial games to play, Brey said, this trip is not a vaca­tion. 
"We have to be smart about when we prepare and focus," he said. 
The Irish flew to St. Thomas Wednesday. The six-hour plane trip was the longest Notre Dame is scheduled to take this season. But that didn't both junior forward Luke Zeller, who played with a travel team in Australia over the summer.

Maryland awaits in WNIT sen1i 
Squad's third Big 
McGraw says No. 3 Terrapins will challenge Irish defensively 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Associate Sports EJitor 
Notre Dame has won every game this season in a blowout. Even when Irish coach MuiTet Me<;raw has said that her team did not play well. the Irish havn won by a wide mar­gin. 
But that is likely to change today when thn Irish take on No. 3 Maryland in College Park at 7 p.m. in the second round of the Preseason Women's National Invitation Tournament. 
Mdlraw allirmed Maryland's status as one of the top tnams in the country, and she already pnldiets a doep postseason run for the Terrapins. 
"I think that this is a great opportunity Ito play a team I that everybody, including myself, thinks will be in the Final Four," McGraw said. "I think they're one of the most talentnd tnams in the eountry. They'vn got depth, they've got size, they've got speed. They've really got everything that you need to get to the Final Four." 
Maryland has been just as dominant as the Irish early in the season-if not more so. In

By DAN MURPHY Associate Sports EJitor 
The Irish will try to move one step closer to their third Big East tournament title tonight when they take on No. 19 DePaul in the semifinals at 5:30. 
If Notre Dame wins, the Irish will play in the champi­onship game on Sunday against either Louisville or Connecticut in Storrs, Conn. 
The Blue Demons (12-6-0) were the regular season win­ners of the Hed Division in the conference and No. 10 Notre Dame finished in a tie with Connecticut for first place in the Blue Division. 
"I think it speaks for itself when you're nationally ranked at the end of the sea­son, I think you've done pretty well. They had a wonderful

COMMENTARY 
Adversity never stopped seniors 
Snvnntnen scholarship foot­

ball players arrived at Notre 
Damn in the fall of' 2004. 
Only seven arn still on the 
rostnr. 
The Class 
of 200S has 
snen attrition 
is nvery way 
ima~inable. 
Somn play­ers had bad luck --like linnbacknr Abdel Banda, who sull"nrnd a carenr-nnd­ing injury. 
Some deddnd playing varsity football wouldn't bn part of thnir Notre Dame experience after all -like John Kadous and Stanford lnterhall star Tregg Duerson. 
Some were upset about the coaching change or lack of playing time --like running back Justin Hoskins (now at Central Michigan), quartnrback David Wolke (now at Western Kentucky). defensive lineman Brandon Nicolas (now at Colorado) and wide receiver Chris Vaughn (now at Louisville). 
And one--running back Darius Walker--opted for an NFL paycheck over his senior season in South Bend. 
But even without most of the players they met at Frosh-0, the Class of 2008 has found a way to succeed. They helped thn Irish to thrne bowl gamns in their time on campus, induding two of the BCS variety. And they havn donn their best to hold thn team to~ether during this disastrous 1-IJ season. 
And now, alon~ with th1~ir walk-on brethren and the nine lirth-ynar seniors, seven recruitml scholarship seniors-­Maurin~ Crum, Justin Brown, Terrail Lambert. Leo Ferrine, Junior .Jabbie, I>arrin Bra~~ and Anthony Verna~lia--will play possibly their final ~ame at Notrn Dame Stadium. !All seven arn eligible for firth years.) 
Thosn snven havn seen class­mates lnave the team, but they stuck it out. They have endured ridicule from fans who called them "not talented enough," but they never lashed out in the media. Some of thorn have struggled to get on· the bench, but they never stoppnd work­ing. 
Through the bi~~est wins and the most crushing losses, thosn seven have remained focused on tho goal they originally sot out to rnach --to bring Notre Damn back to the elite. For two years, the Irish were back in tlw top 20, thanks in part to them. And while this season 


has fallen apart, they continue 
to try to lead the youn~er play­
ers, trying to ensure the pro­
gram's future. 
For the nine fifth-year sen­iors, the story is different. They arrived at a Notre Dame that saw a bright future ahead after Tyrone Willingham's 10-3 first season. Their classmates indude£V.ll-America receiver Jell" Samardzija and first-round quarterback Brady Quinn. 
After BCS bowls in their jun­ior and senior seasons, this group-John Carlson, Travis Thomas, John Sullivan, Trevor Laws, Tom Zbikowski, Dwight Stephenson, Joe Brockington, Ambrose Wooden and Geofl" Price -all decided to return for one more year. 
Obviously, this season has not gone as planned, but they have all played with heart and tried to lead despite the losses. They are part of the greatest Notre Dame class since the Holtz era, and their contributions will not be forgotten, even in the dark­est hour of Irish football. 
And it's important to remem­ber the rest of the senior class -the walk-ons. They joined the team not for a shot at the NFL, but for the camaraderie of their teammates and the chance to wear a gold helmet. 
Their best memories aren't scoring a touchdown or making a sack in a big game, but rather when they put on their green jersey before USC in 2005 or when they intercepted a Quinn pass in practice--or even just playing catch on the field in front of 80,000 people. 
They have majors like engi­nnnring and pm-professional, but they still lind time to learn tlw oppmwnt's playbook every week to help prepare their teammates. 
Saturday will almost certainly be their last game at Notre Dame Stadium. If they're lucky, they'll be able to get into the ~arne for a play or two. Even if they're not. they'll be excited to bn out there with their friends one last time. 
It's been a long season. But win or lose, all of the seniors will probably linger on the field for a few extra seconds, rnmembering the good times they had there. 
They've been through a lot at Notre Dame, and they've han­dled it all with graee and dass. 
And for that, they deserve a hand.

I Senior outside linebacker Anthony Vernaglla stares down the competition during Notre Dame's 41-241oss to Air Force on Nov.10. 
Senior OLB left his Trojan roots to play and learn in Indiana 
By FRAN TOLAN Sporrs Wrirer 
Irish outside linebacker Anthony Vernaglia is unsure about why hn came to Notre Dame, but he sure is glad he did. 
"I don't know how I ended up here -not in a bad sense but in general, I have no idea," Vernaglia said. 
Coming out of Orange Lutheran High School in south­ern California, Vernaglia was recruited by several major col­leges and almost committed to USC. But after seeing Notre Dame, Vernaglia had a hunch that the school was the right place for him. 
"I don't know how or why II came hen1J but out of nowhere I did," Vernaglia said. "Maybn it had something to do with the aeadmnics but as for exactly how or why I have no idea." 
I>evoloping an enmity for Notre Dame's rival USC was one of the first dif'licultios Vernaglia encountered. 
"I almost went there, so it was pretty hard to turn around and hate them," he said. 
Vernaglia was definitely unsure about the road that lay ahead for him as he entered 
Notre Dame. In high school, he except for the Indiana weather. played a slew of positions "Every time it snows and including wide receiver, safety rains, I have a lot of regrets," and linebacker.

In his lirst two years in South Bend, Charlie Weis took his team to two BCS bows and looked like a genius. But poor fundamentals and baflling game-day deci­sions have fans wonder­ing ­where did the old Charlie Weis disappear to'!  Jimmy Clausen returned the starting linnup against Air Force and played much better than he had previ­ously this sea'ion, complet­ing 22-of'-40 passes for more than 240 yards and three touchdowns. His numbers would have been even better if' not for dropped pa'ises.  Notre Dame was incon­sistent on the ground against Air Foree, but after the Irish fell behind they had to pass on every down to try to eateh back up. Even though the last two weeks have been bet­ter, the Irish arn nowhere near where the need to bn.  Clausen looked much better last week, but Irish wide receivers killed drives with way too many dropped passes.

DARRIN BRAGG 

Fron1 Hollywood to House That Rock Built: Bragg returns 
QB was asked to rejoin team during studio internship at Fox 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
Five months ago. Darr·in Bragg wasn't on Notre Dame's football t(~am. Now lw's the third-string quartnrbaek. Over the sumnwr, tlw snnior f'ilm. tlllevision and theater major was an intern at 20th Century Fox under Exneutive Vi(:o l'rnsidnnt of l'roduetion .lim Sharp. Thorn. he workod on Fox hit shows likn "Bones" and "llousn." 
"Prntty mueh nvery day I walked in and hn lot mn do whatnvnr I want," Bragg said. "And whatnver I want, wlwrnPvnr I wanted to go in the eom pany. I got to do." 
Bragg said lw was on a tolevi­sion sPl whnn Notrn Dame Direetor of Football Opnrations Chad Klunder ealled him in .July and asknd him if he would rnturn to tlw Irish. 
"I was in the middle of work and they said. 'We need you to eome baek and play quartnr­baek,"' Bragg said. "And I'm lik(~ 'OK, sure.' Why not? What am I going to say, no'!" 
Bmgg said he was unsure if the eall was true sinen lw had only quit th(1 team two months before he was asked to eome back. 
"I called them back, and I was shocked," he said. "I called [quarterbacks] coach IHonl l'owlus and a couple of other eoaches to make sure they weren't pulling my chain," Bragg said. "I was like, 'Heally'! Are you sure'!'"For Bragg, the truth marked the end of a wide drde. 
Former !wad coach Tyrone Willingham recruited Bragg as a quarterback out of Bellarminn l'rnp in San Jose, Cali!'. But when Willingham was !'ired after the 2004 season, new lwad coach Charlie Weis moved Bragg to wide receiver. 
"I always wanted the ball every time the quarterback dropped baek. I always thought, 'I'm open,' even if I was cov­nrnd," Bragg said. "[Being a quarterback! helped out playing receiver because you knew if there was a hot lrnadl or some­thing you knew what to do." 
Bragg did not see any time as a wide receiver in his two sea­sons at that position and decid­ed in May that he would leave the team. Bragg t.hought he was treated somewhat unfairly as a receiver before he left the team. 

"I was frustrated because I really wasn't sure how to play the position," Bragg said. "It's just great to be back playing quarterback, something I'm comfortable with." 
Now, he's not only comfort­able he's also important. When Bragg left the team, Jimmy Clausen, Evan Sharpley, Demetrius Jones and Zach Frazer all were ahead of him on the depth chart. 

By Notre Dame's game against Purdue in September, Bragg was a snap away from entering the game with Clausen out because of an injury. 
"This year of all years has dHiinitely been kind of a high­light because I've been 'that guy.' It's like, 'What if that guy gets hurt? Demetrius trans­ferr·ed, Zach transferred.' I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess I'd go in next,"' Bragg said. "There was certain points where I was like, 'Yeah;, I should probably get ready. 
Bragg also said that his emo­tions haven't changed much since he returned to the team, but that things will probably change this week for his final home game as a Notre Dame student. 
"I think it will be much morn important for the last home game, suiting up instead of being in the stands watching it, so I'm really glad I came back just for that last game," Bragg said. 
Bragg's football career might end, but the film and theatre major has his plans set for after graduation -and they involve Los Angeles. 
"I know I'm going to move to L.A., but I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet," Bragg said. ''I'll probably be a starving actor for the first 6, 10, 20 years, whatever. But it's some­thing you love, you've got to do it." 

And he'll be coming back to Notre Dame every now and then to watch his former teammates. "''ll probably come back next year, dude. I want to come back soon enough where I know guys on the team," Bragg said, before harnessing his thespian side to imitate an old man. "I 
don't want to eome back 20 years from now and be like, 'Back in my day, I was the third­string quarterback in 2007."
