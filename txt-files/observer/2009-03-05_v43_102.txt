Groupplans to present petition to Fr. Jenkins 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Associate News Editor 

Student members of the Campaign for Human Dignity plan to present a petition to University President Fr. John Jenkins the Wednesday after spring break to urge the University to include "sexual orientation" in its nondiscrimi­nation clause. 
"Notre Dame claims that they don't discriminate against gay and lesbian students," sopho­more Mary Dewey said. "So this is a challenge for them to put that commitment in writing. We believe it would go a long way to make Notre Dame a more welcoming place for all its stu­dents." 
The University's nondiscrimi­nation notice states the follow­ing: 
"The University of Notre Dame does not discriminate on the basis of race/ethnicity, color, national origin, sex, disability, veteran status or age in the administration of any of its employment, educational pro­grams, admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs, athletics, recreational and other school-administered pro­grams." 
As of last night, the Campaign for Human Dignity, composed of students from other campus groups like the Progressive Student Alliance, College Democrats and Human Rights NO, had collected just over 2,700 signatures of students in

and courts for tennis, basketball and sand volleyball. Free cable, internet, water utility and parking are includ­ed. 
Kristie Nozykowski, property man­ager for Clover Ridge, said, "The thing that students really like about Clover Ridge is that we try to put them near their·friends. They can get off-campus living but still have friends close by." 
Irish Crossings, with 84 residents, and Irish Row, with 185, are the newest of the properties. They include all utilities except gas and electric, and offer full furnishings with each unit.

Recession affects potential jobs· 
ByJOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
The economic recession is affecting students looking for jobs in a variety of indus­tries, according to Ray Vander Heyden, assis~nt director for business career programs at the Notre Dame Career Center. 
"This is affecting the whole economy, and a wide range of organizations," he said. 
Assistant Professor of Economics Abigail Wozniak agrees that the recession, which initially only affected the financial sector, is now an issue for the entire job market. 
"What's surprising is· how wide ranging it has been," Wozniak said, citing the effects of the recession on 
the consulting and legal industries." 
Both Vander Heyden and Wozniak also cited non-prof­its as being affected by the recession. "Funding isn't flowing into non-profits as much," Vander Heyden said. 
Wozniak views the legal sector as another industry that will be hit by the reces­sion because of its close rela­tion to the fmancial sector. 
"I think the financial sector is going to be different long­term," she said. "The legal profession is somewhat tied to that. When you're under­taking a lot of acquisitions, you need a lot of lawyers to help you with that. If you're really on the fence and never really wanted to go to law school, you shouldn't go because you can't get a job," she said. 

Wozniak cites the health­care and education sectors as ones that she sees with potential to grow. Growth in education would be helpful for the long-term future of the country, according to Wozniak, who is currently on leave from Notre Dame at Princeton University for the academic year. 
"I really would like to see the United States commit itself to increasing education throughout its population. In terms of returning the U.S. to competitiveness with other countries, that's the route we have to go," she said. "It seems to be a sector that helps· us in the long run and the short run."

Parry top of class at &1intMary's 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY Assistant News Editor 
Saint Mary's valedictorian, senior Courtney Parry, said she is very grateful to her professors and the faculty who have helped her throughout her four years on campus. 
"I owe. a great deal of gratitude to the professors and faculty I have learned from over the past four years. My professors have inspired me to want to learn more about their disci­pline, and have excited me about my own ability to make a difference in the world," Parry said. 
Parry, a mathematics and economics double major with a 3.99 GPA according to a press release, was not planning on becoming vale­dictorian. 
"I was not working toward this goal specifically, and was very surprised when I first learned about the des­ignation. I had honestly given my class rank very lit­tle thought prior to learning 
about  my  status,"  Parry

Franks discusses Sanger, euthogenics 
By ROBERT SINGER News Writer 
Angela Franks, author and Ph.D. of theology, linked the founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, to the eugenics movement of the first half of the 20th cen­tury, while arguing that elements of eugenics ­which attempts to improve the quality of the gene pool through selec­tive fertility -are still present in today's organi­zation. 
"We know Margaret Sanger because she estab­lished an institution and gave eugenics staying power inside an institu­tion," Franks said. 
Franks lectured on "Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood: The Eugenics Connection" Wednesday night in DeBartolo Hall. According to Franks, Sanger, who is popularly known for her efforts to provide women with contraception, was also a prominent figure in the eugenics movement, which saw overpopulation as a problem on the hori­zon. 
"Sanger is a eugenicist," she said. "Basically she believed that birth control limits the bad genes and

Bulls 

Extravaganza 
This past weekend I had the pleasure ~ending an evening with a lovely young lady at a Chicago Bulls extrava­ganza. I don't want to call it a game, because that was far and away the least interesting part. 
The Bulls won, Dan Murphy beating the red hot Denver 
Sports Editor 
Nuggets. The score (116-99) was relevant for one reason -Chicago broke the century mark which meant that each fan in attendance won a free 
Big Mac. 
With the shot clock running low and a hand in his face Chicago's Tyrus Thomas nailed a clutch jumper late in the fourth quarter. The shot gave the Bulls a two­point lead and all the momentum they would need to pull away. 
Thomas's shot was celebrated with smattered applause and a few screams from circular, furry men in the upper deck. A few seconds later the United Center erupted. Fans jumped to their feet and pulled at their hair in excited anticipation. I followed their eyes towards the rafters to see what was going on. It was T-shirts. 
During the TV timeout, free shirts attached to parachutes cascaded down from the ceiling. They might as well have been coming from heaven. Thousands of fans groped hopelessly at the sky like newborn birds looking for a worm. When they brought the T-shirt cannon out the growing fervor became full blown ecstasy. People love free stuff. 
By this time in the extravaganza, I shouldn't have been shocked; the biggest cheers all night were coming during TV timeouts. And I have to admit, the sideshow acts were more deserving. 
Benny the Bull and his troops paraded act after act onto the parquet. It was the first time I'd ever seen fans wait until the game started up to hit up the snack bar. 
Leading the way were the half-cheer­leader, half-strip-tease squad known as the Luvabulls. Even during the game they were hard to keep your eyes off of. The girls went through several different dances and four costume changes dur­ing the four quarters. 
Their moves were second to one, the Swinging Seniors -the only dance crew that you need an AARP membership to join. The seniors didn't shy away from any booty-bumping, air-humping mod­em moves during their two minute med­ley ofhardcore rap songs. If you don't believe me, I'm sure it's on YouTube. 
Other highlights included the Stampede drumline, the trampoline dunk team and a half-time karaoke con­test. The guy who lost got booed more than Carmelo Anthony. 
The true star of the show, however, was the world's smallest cowboy. The well-trained monkey complete with his own miniature bandana rode proudly around the arena on the back of an Irish setter steed. He finished at halfcourt by giving a fist-pump while his dog went up on his hind legs. 
The cowboy was in town to promote Saturday night's rodeo at the United Center. Rumor has it Kirk Heinrich vol­unteered to wear face paint and an empty barrel so he could get some attention.

Eagle survives crash through truck windshield 
RENO-The eagle has landed -with a thud ­after crashing through the windshield of a tractor­trailer on a Nevada high­way. State wildlife officials said Wednesday that a 15­pound golden eagle with a 7 -foot wing span has a swollen head but otherwise appears unhurt after crashing into a Florida truck driver's big rig on Monday. 
Matthew Roberto Gonzalez of Opa Locka, Fla., was driving on U.S. Interstate 80 in northeast Nevada near Wells, about 60 miles west of the Utah line, when the eagle came crashing into the cab of his truck. 

"I heard a loud thump like a brick or something coming through the glass," said Daryl Young of Miami, the co-driver who was doz­ing in the sleeper berth when it happened. "I woke up, and the windshield was all over me. Next thing I know there was a big bird lying on the floor." 
Man uses debit card to buy drink In alleged holdup 
CHARLESTON -Would­be robbers take note: Don't use your debit card during a holdup. A West Virginia man who police say attempted to rob a convenience store instead ended up buying a soft drink with his debit card -ultimately leading to his arrest. 
Shawn Thomas Lester, 33, told the store clerk Monday he had a gun and wanted all the money in the register, police said. But the suspect got flus­tered when a customer walked in and the clerk told him to pay for the soft drink.

The Office for Civic and Social Engagement (OCSE) at Saint Mary's is offering a substitute to the tradi­tional spring break trip for students. The program is called Women's Issues in the City: Alternative Spring Break, and will take students to Indianapolis to work with the Indianapolis Peace Institute (IPI). 
Carrie Call, director of OCSE, said, "The trip is offered in conjunction with the Indianapolis Peace Institute in Indianapolis." Students had to apply to the program through OCSE. 
During the trip, students will work with Kate Williams, a member of IPI. Williams is a Saint Mary's alumna. 
Throughout the trip, stu­dents will learn about women's issues and will also participate in service projects. 
"On the trip, students will live together in the restored mansion owned by IPI, visit sites in the city to learn about issues that affect women, do some direct service with a few agencies and share in meals and reflection together," Call said. 
One such project gives students the opportunity to work at a soup kitchen in Indianapolis.

Prime minister bungles words TOKYO-Reading Japanese isn't easy-even for the Japanese. 
Take Prime Minister Taro Aso. He's made so many public blunders that an opposition law­maker tried to give him a reading test during a televised session of parliament. 
The Japanese leader bungled the word for "frequent," calling Japan-China exchanges "cumbersome" instead. Another time, he mis­read the word "toshu" (follow), saying "fushu"­or stench -and sounded as if he were saying government policy "stinks." 
While the media and Aso's political rivals have been quick to heap ridicule, many Japanese have seen a bit more of themselves in Aso's goofs than they would like to admit. Since his missteps, books designed to improve reading ability have become all the rage. 
Aso's nemesis is his mother tongue's notori­ously tricky mishmash of Chinese characters and its two set<; of indigenous syllabaries. 
Afghan election to stay in August 
KABUL -The Afghan election commission rejected President Hamid Karzai's request to move the presidential elections to the spring, saying the country won't be safe enough or have enough money by then to hold a vote. 
The commission's decision came Wednesday as a car bomb exploded outside the main U.S. base at Bagram, underscoring the shaky security situation the country faces as a resurgent Taliban militia increases its attacks. 
Karzai had asked the commission to move the elections from Aug. 20 to spring, but the commission said it could not because of bad spring weather, lack of funds, security issues and logistical problems like the distribution of ballots.

Violence leads to precautions 
SAN ANTONIO -The drug violence in Mexico has gotten so bad that booming numbers of Mexican and American professionals are having their cars fitted with armor plates, bulletproof glass and James Bond-style gadgets such as electrified door handles and push-button smokescreens. 
Until recently, it was mostly movie stars, busi­ness moguls and politicians who took such precau­tions. But now, industry officials say, the customers include factory owners, doctors, newspaper pub­lishers and others who have business on both sides of the border and fear killings, kidnappings and carjackings by drug dealers or people in their debt. 
The customers "don't have to be very big," said Mark Burton, CEO of International Armoring Corp. of Ogden, Utah. "This becomes almost a necessity." 
One San Antonio company said it expects a 50 percent increase in business this year.

Republican Sen. Denni<; Kruse of Auburn, chair­man of the Senate Pensions and Labor Committee, is taking the lead on the issue in the GOP-con­trolled Senate. The Democrat-led House failed to pass a bill to fix an unemployment system that has been paying out millions of dollars more in bene­fits than it has been collecting from employer taxes.

ICC charges president of Sudan 
Omar al-Bashir's government removes 10 humanitarian groups from Darfur 
Associated Press 
THE HAGUE -The presi­dent of Sudan became a wanted man Wednesday when the International Criminal Court charged him with war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur -its first action against a sitting head of state and one that could set the stage for more world leaders to be indicted. 
President Omar al­Bashir's government retali­ated by expelling 10 humanitarian groups from Darfur and seizing their assets, threatening lifesav­ing operations, a U.N. spokeswoman said. 
Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the United States supported the court's action "to hold accountable those who are responsible for the heinous crimes in Darfur." Up to 300,000 peo­ple have died and 2.7 mil­lion have fled their homes in the region. 
U.N. 
officials in Sudan will continue to deal with al­Bashir because he remains the president of the country, 

U.N. 
spokeswoman Michele Montas said in New York.

said the current recession is not as bad as the recession of the early 1980s, at least according to unemploy­ment numbers. "We have seen serious downturns in the past and we still have not reached those numbers," she said. "There are a number of rea­sons to expect that growth won't come back in the same way as in the 1980s, but the present still isn't entirely unprecedented." 
While the current recession is often compared to the Great Depression, Wozniak said the recovery will not need to be as severe as it was in the 1930s. "We learned a lot from the Great Depression," she said. "Even if the downturn does become that severe, the recov­ery will be a lot faster." 
What can I do? 
Wozniak said current juniors looking to graduate in May 2010 will be the most affected by the recession. "They should think about a long-term strate­gy for themselves," she said. "They should be thinking of a challenging labor market for the next five years and should ask: What can I do now to get on some sort of career trajec­tory?" 
The job market no longer has a focus on high-paying, short­term careers, according to Wozniak. 
"Any student who is thinking of going into a high-paying career temporarily should probably start thinking about how to get into what they real­ly want to be doing right now," she said. "I don't think that's going to ever come back. If stu­dents really want to go into teaching or something else, 
they should just start looking for jobs in those industries." Vander Heyden urges stu­

bid, but that America does," she said. 
Kapshandy said Chicago would be a great venue for bringing people from all over the globe together. 
"As of today, over 1.1 mil­lion people have registered their support on the Chicago 2016 Web site," Kapshandy said. 
The International Olympic Evaluation Committee is vis­iting the four candidate cities starting with Chicago in April and continuing through May, Kapshandy said. The 
International  Olympic  
Committee will  announce  
who  will  host  the  2016  

Summer Olympic and Paralyrnpic Garnes on Oct. 2. 
The other three candidate cities are Madrid, Spain; Tokyo, Japan; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
According to Kapshandy, the Olympic committee's decision about where to host the summer games involves much scrutiny. 
"The committee is looking at everything: is city able to host one million people in the span of several weeks, are citizens of the city also sup­porting the bid, do they have adequate transportation?" she said. 
While Kapshandy could not disclose specifics about how Chicago 2016 is planning to prepare for the Olympics if it is chosen as the host of the 2016 summer games, she said the city will make sure that everyone from residents to visitors are accommodat­ed. 
" ... Chicago is trying to make ·sure that the Olympics are held the best way to 
accommodate residents, ath­letes, and spectators," she said. 
Plans are in the works to hold another registration drive on campus later this semester, Kapshandy said. 
Notre Dame's involvement in bringing the Olympics to Chicago doesn't end on earn­pus. Today the Notre Dame Club of Chicago will host its Hesburgh Forum, which will feature three Notre Dame Alumni speakers and a luncheon at the Union League Club in Chicago. The Notre Dame alumni speakers include Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick, Director of Marketing and Communications for the Chicago 2016 committee Valerie Waller and Chairman of the McDonald's Corporation Andrew McKenna Sr. . 
Kapshandy said she first got involved in bringing the Olympics to Chicago to keep herself busy over Christmas break. 
"During Christmas break in 2007, I decided to do some­thing with my break and I sent a few e-rnails to people on the Chicago 2016 commit­tee. I connected with a Saint Mary's alum who. was work­ing on the 2016 Olympics and I've been there for over a year now," Kapshandy said. 
I'd heard about it before it became popular, I grew up in Chicago, and I love sports ... so I decided to do what I could to bring the games to Chicago in 2016."

IN BRIEF 
Swiss bank maintains secrecy 
WASHINGTON -UBS AG now says it had about 4 7.000 accounts held by Americans who didn't pay U.S. taxes on their assets, but Switzerland's biggest bank is providing the names of only 300 American clients to the U.S. government in a showdown over secrecy. 
Lines were drawn in the burgeoning cross-bor­der dispute at a hearing Wednesday by a Senate investigative panel. 
A Justice Department official signaled that UBS could still be subject to criminal prosecution if terms aren't met under the bank's recent agree­ment with the U.S. government. A key senator, meanwhile, noted improving prospects, including the backing of President Barack Obama, for U.S. legislation to fight offshore tax-haven abuses. 
"The rest of the world is getting fed up with off­shore tax havens that turn a blind eye to tax eva­sion and allow their financial institutions ... to profit from tax dodging," said Sen. Carl Levin, D­Mich., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. 
Businesses say economy growing worse 
WASHINGTON -The businesses on the front lines of the dismal economy say the recession is getting worse in almost every part of the country, and in a bleak new forecast they see no improvement until late this year at the earliest. 
A Federal Reserve snapshot of business activity issued Wednesday showed wide­spread declines in production, from th.e factories of Cleveland to the high-tech firms of Texas and California, in blue-col­lar construction jobs and at white-collar accounting firms. 
The survey, known as the Beige Book, rated the prospects for economic improve­ment anytime soon as "poor, with a signifi­cant pickup not expected before late 2009 or early 2010." 
Factories exposed to the housing indus­try were hardest hit. Construction equip­ment and materials, such as primary met­als, wood products and electrical equip­ment, saw especially steep drops in pro­duction. So did makers of furniture and cars.

Overbudget, NASA gets more 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -NASA can land a spacecraft on a peanut-shaped asteroid 150 million miles away, but it doesn't come close to hitting the budget target for building its spacecraft, according to congressional auditors. NASA's top officials know it and even joke about it. 
This week auditors found that on nine projects alone NASA is nearly $1.1 billion over cost estimates that were set in the last couple of years. 
Congress' financial watch­dog, the Government Accountability Office, reviewed NASA's newest big­money projects and found most were either over budg­et, late or both. That doesn't include two of NASA's largest spending projects whose costs have wildly fluctuated and still aren't firm ­replacements for the space shuttle fleet and Hubble Space Telescope. 
Historically, overruns have caused NASA to run low on money, forcing it to shelve or delay other projects. Often, the agency just asks taxpay­ers for more money. 
In fact, NASA got $1 billion from the new stimulus pack­age. It's to be spent on cli­mate-watching satellites and exploration among other things. 
"Getting an extra infusion of money doesn't necessarily mean you have a capability to spend it well," said Cristina Chaplain, GAO's acquisitions chief who wrote the study. 
A ~econd GAO report used NASA as one of its leading poster children for bad prac­tices in estimating costs. The space agency, which has a budget of about $18 billion, needs "a more disciplined approach" to its projects, the GAO said. NASA spending has been on GAO's "high risk" list since 1990. Its cost overrun problems will be the subject of a House Science Committee hearing Thursday. 
"A cancer is overtaking our space agency: the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects," NASA's former science chief Alan Stern wrote in an op-ed piece in the New York Times in 2008. He quit last year over the shifting of money to pay for cost overruns. 
NASA's spending problems are so predictable and big that two years ago Congress put it under the same tough budgeting rules as the Defense Department. That means NASA must notify Congress if a program's cost rises by more than 15 per­cent. The GAO report issued Monday was the first using NASA's new requirements. 
In a statement to The Associated Press, NASA said its missions "are one-of-a­kind and complex, which always makes estimating challenging... We do believe NASA is a good investment of federal funds and strive to provide the best value." The agency statement said exter­nal forces, such as launch availabilities, also cause delays and cost increases. The agency says it has improved its cost estimating. 
Last December then-NASA administrator Michael Griffin tried to compare cost over­runs -like the $400 million extra needed for the Mars Science Laboratory -with do-it-yourself projects that keep requiring extra trips to the hardware store. When a reporter quipped that his do­it-yourself projects use his own money, Griffin drew laughter with his response: "And we are spending your own money for this." 
Imposing financial disci­pline, as GAO urges, "is an uphill fight," said Smithsonian Institution space scholar John Logsdon, who is on NASA's advisory coun~. 
In the latest report, NASA couldn't provide the GAO with current accurate esti­mates on two of its hugest projects so the watchdog agency merely cited ballpark guesses: 
-The program to build new spaceships to send astro­nauts back to the moon would cost somewhere around $37 to $49 billion and already has financial and technical risks, the GAO found. 
-The multibillion-dollar James Webb Space Telescope, whose current cost is unknown, was at least $1 bil­lion over estimates three years ago, before NASA began its new cost accounting methods. 
NASA has cost overruns for several reasons, said the GAO's Chaplain. Those include poor cost estimating at the beginning, trying to do cutting-edge science, con­stantly changing designs, and poor contractor performance. Six of the projects had prob­lems with contractors, includ­ing lack of experience, that led to delays or higher costs. 
In his December news con­ference, Griffin said there isn't a very good way to esti­mate at the front end of a mission what it's going to take to achieve scientific pri­orities. 

'Normal' child shoots and kills step-1110111 
Associated Press 
NEW CASTLE, Pa.-Good student. Starting quarterback. Aspiring hunter. By most accounts, 11-year-old Jordan Brown was a typical boy in his rural Pennsylvania community, albeit raised mostly by his father after his mother gave him up. 
So it baffies Jordan's friends and neighbors that he is accused of taking a 20-gauge youth shotgun he got from his father for Christmas and fatally shooting his father's pregnant fiancee, the woman who tried hardest to be a mother to him. 
"There were no red lights, there were no indications that we should have done something differently," said Timothy McNamee, superintendent of the Mohawk Area School District, noting there were no reports Jordan was bullied or was having problems in school or at home. 
Authorities say the Feb. 20 killing of 26-year-old Kenzie Marie Houk in Wampum, a small community about 50 miles north of Pittsburgh where near­ly everyone knows everyone, was premeditated. Police say Jordan threw the spent shell casing in the woods, got on the bus and went to school. 
Jordan has been charged as an adult with double homicide. If he is convicted as an adult, he faces life in prison. If his case gets moved to a juvenile court, he would probably spend the next 10 years in a secure juve­nile facility. 
Jordan's mother, Mildred Krause, was just four months pregnant with him when she first entered a courtroom to bat­good father and spent a lot of quality time with his son. 
The instability that character­ized Jordan's formative years, including the fact he might have felt rejected by his biological mother, could have influenced his later behavior, said Daniel Shaw, chairman of the psycholo­gy department at the University of Pittsburgh. 
"You can easily say it's a risk factor, a very important one, in early childhood that has been linked to ... antisocial behav­iors," Shaw said. However, "it's not usually going to result in the child killing someone at age 11." 
Christopher Brown, Jordan's father, refused to be interviewed for this story but answered a few questions through his attor­ney. A phone call to a phone number for the boy's mother's family rang unanswered. A per­son answering a phone at an address listed for the Krause family said she no longer lived there. 
Through Elisco, Brown said Jordan was a good student, pulling mostly As and Bs, his favorite subjects being math and science. In the past two years, Jordan was the starting quarterback for his midget foot­ball team and also played base­ball. 
Jordan's school district serves about 1. 7 85 students in the rolling farmland of rural west­ern Pennsylvania. There were about 20 students in his class, and he probably knew many of the other 125 fifth -graders through baseball and football, said McNamee, the superintend­ent. 
In May 2008, Jordan's father began dating Houk. By 
tle his father, Christopher Brown. 
At that time, in March 1997, Krause filed a protection of abuse order against Brown, claiming he drank, did drugs and had threatened to harm her. Apparently unaware Krause was pregnant with his son, Brown was ordered to stay away from her, an order later expunged, according to court records and Brown's attorney, Dennis Elisco. 
Immediately after Jordan was born on Aug. 30, 1997, Krause contacted Lawrence County Children and Youth Services requesting that they take cus­tody of the child so her mother could adopt him, according to court documents. Not having the father's consent, the agency declined her request. 
Brown, meanwhile, tipped off by Krause's grandmother and brother that she was having his baby in secret, filed an emer­gency petition with the court, opposing the move to have the child put up for adoption and demanding full custody of his son. 
In a back-and-forth battle resolved when Jordan was about 2 months old, a court ruled Krause and Brown would share custody, with the mother getting him four days a week and the father three. 
But on Feb. 5, 1999, with the consent of both parents, Christopher Brown was award­ed full custody of his 18-month­old son. Court records don't indicate why. 
Friends and family say that from February 1999 on, Krause had little contact with her son, entering and exiting his life at will. They say Brown was a Christmas, they W!')re engaged and had moved into a farm­house together, along with Jordan and Houk's two daugh­ters, ages 7 and 4. Houk was already about six months preg­nant. 
Houk's family said their daughter tried to include Jordan in everything, in part to com­pensate for the missing mother figure in his life. 
Willard Houk, Kenzie's uncle, said he stopped at the farm­house a short time after Kenzie and Christopher moved in. He took Kenzie's girls for spins on his motorcycle. Then, Kenzie's 7 -year-old reminded him that Jordan needed to get a ride too, "because he's a part of our fam­ily now," he said. 
Jordan got his ride, but Houk said it seemed strange to him that unlike the girls, who were "bubbly and jumpy," Jordan was barely excited. lt made Houk think Jordan needed more men in his life, and he was determined to help. 
So at Christmas, Willard Houk bought Jordan a present, like he did for the girls. And Jordan got a 20-gauge youth model shot­gun from his father, the one police said he used to shoot Houk in the back of the head. 
Like many other kids in the area, Jordan began .target shooting with his dad in prepa­ration for the 2009 hunting sea­son, when; at age 12, he would be old enough under Pennsylvania law to get a hunt­ing license. 
Father and son would shoot targets in the back yard, which police say helped Houk's 7 -year­old daughter identify the sound of the gunshot she heard the morning her motl1er was killed.

The Observer, and other good things 
The funniest thing I've ever seen in The Observer was publish.!QL a few months ago. On the page typically dedicated to national and mternation­al news, the full-page-width headline said this: 
"9/11 Masterminds Prepared to Confess." 
Don't worry, we're not to the funny part yet. 
The headline was right-9/11 masterminds were, in fact, prepared to con­fess. And the article was com­plete, and didn't continue on the wrong page or anything. 
Beneath the headline, though, was a picture. Unfortunately, as far as I know, the people pictured were not, in fact, 9/11 masterminds. No, they were a lesbian couple from Iowa City, Iowa, and their three lovely young children. 
And you thought not having a recog­nized Gay-Straight Student Alliance was as bad as Notre Dame got. 
Newspapers have long been known to navel-gaze, a: bit. It's not unusual to see front-page newspaper stories about the decline of the newspaper, as if those outside the paper cared as much about the solvency of the Sacramento Bee as they do about Iraq, Obama and other front page news. 
But this is not an example of gazing at my own navel. To be clear, I'm not really part of The Observer. I mean, yes, I get invited to the parties, and mooch off the paper's budget for a delicious dinner at The Vine each semester. But other than that, all I do is send in an e-mail once every other week. 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 


Until there was free Heavenly Ham in The Observer offices at the end of last semester, I had never met then­Editor-in-Chief Chris Hine. I only knew Kaitlynn Riely, another editor, from class and her embarrassing spam-post (a new noun) on my Faceboolf wall about a cool new Web site I could go to find about all of my crushes. And I only knew Deirdre Krasula, yet another editor, because she was a mediocre defensive back on the Badin interhall football team that I helped coach. Last week, they all left office, leaving the keys and responsi­bility to a whole new set of budding liberal media elites. 
So all of that aside, there's some­thing most people on this campus don't realize about The Observer staff: 
These people work damn hard every single day and night to get out a full paper. That's not something that most school newspapers even dream of doing-once a week, maybe three times, that's more standard. But every day? We're in pretty good company. 
They catch a lot of flak on this cam­pus for their faults. I've had at least three professors who have shared with the class that they avoid The Observer as much as possible. Another suggested that reliable source of news would be to read The Observer, and believe the opposite. And granted, many students on this campus would be perfectly happy if, instead of a full newspaper, The ObserverJ'ust printed a word jumble, crosswor puzzle and horoscopes every day. 
The hyperbole aside, I understand all of that. And importantly, from my impression, so does The Observer. 
Yes, sometimes they make hysteri­cally funny mistakes. 
And yes, sometimes, their articles are incomplete. Sometimes their quotes are basically fabricated. 
Sometimes their pictures imply that lesbian women were the masterminds of the 9/11 attacks. 
And no, they don't always-or, ever -do the hardest-hitting, investigative journalism. 
But compared to many school news­papers, they dn an incredible amount of hard work to make it all happen, and it's really impressive. 
At the risk of sounding remarkably ignorant, this is something that it's taken me until my senior year to real­ize: by and large, we don't give stu­dent leaders on this campus enough day-to-day credit for the remarkable amount of work they do. Within their organizations and groups, of course, they get due credit. But from the out­side, that's often ignored. 
It's not just Chris, Kaitlynn, Deirdre, and countless others at The Observer. It's Bob, Grant, Cynthia and countless others in Student Government. It's even Andrew, Greer, Brandon, and countless others at The Irish Rover. 
Whatever we think of the content of their work or their attitude towards it, these people all do remarkable things around this campus. They work hard so that we can all be part of a more engaging, interesting, worthwhile campus community. Do they miss the ball sometimes? Of course. And it's fine to make fun of them when they do. 
But I owe them all a thank you, too, and an apology for not saying it soon­er. 
Andrew Nesi is a senior American Studies major from Fairfield, Conn. As you can tell from this column, he ­unlike the people he describes -does not always do the same remarkable amount of work. He can be reached at anesi@nd. edu 
The views expressed in this column are those of the author and not necessarily those of The Observer.

Change vve should believe in 
If you're really lucky -or somewhat irresponsible -perhaps you're reading today's Observer on your way out of town. On your way home? On your way to someplace warm? On your way to 
someplace that  
should be warm  Kate Barrett  
but recently  
received 10" of  
snow? Maybe you're  Faithpoint  
here till tomor­ 

row, or you're here for the whole break. Whether you have to study, work, grade papers or exams ... or if you're fortu­nate enough to travel to Appalachia, New Orleans;Washington D.C., Coachella or Cancun, the week does feel like a break. It's different. It marks the (more or less) halfway point of the semester and helps us turn the corner from winter to spring, from the starting point of the beginning of the semester to the finish line of finals and summer. No matter how you spend it, spring break refuses to be ignored. Spring break means change is on the way. 
Cool coincidence, then, that every year the second Sunday of Lent, which happens.to be this first Sunday of spring break, offers us an unusual, or some might say kind of weird, reading about ... change. The second Sunday_ of Lent always proclaims the story of Jesus' Transfiguration, this year from Mark's Gospel (Mark 9:2-10; go ahead, look it up if you like). In each of the three "eyewitness" Gospels-Matthew, Mark and Luke -we can find this event reported, and it always follows Jesus' prediction that he will suffer and be crucified. The basics of'the story go as follows: Jesus has invited Peter, James and John to come up Mount Tabor with him. Suddenly the disciples see what seems to be a vision: Jesus looks dazzlingly different, brilliantly lit, dressed in eye-popping white and con­versing with two men whom the disci~ ples would have immediately recog­nized: Moses and the prophet Elijah. Peter, befuddled, suggests that maybe they should just stay up there on a per­manent basis. A cloud overshadows the scene, which for a Jew would instantly signify the presence of God. A voice from the cloud says, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him." 
Now this story doesn't mean a whole lot beyond its admittedly high "wow" factor unless we realize that it's not about a change in how Jesus looks or acts. After all, he soon looks just like himself again, and he orders them not to tell anyone about the incident (a command he repeats, and which is usu­ally ignored, throughout the Gospels). But God has given the three disciples the gift of a new understanding. Not only is Jesus now irrefutably linked to two central figures in Jewish salvation history, but God (in the cloud) has com­manded respect for Jesus. The story doesn't focus on the fact that Jesus has changed, but that now the disciples have the opportunity for change. They have seen a vision, and they can now see with new vision. Peter, James and John became transformed by a clearer understanding of Jesus' whole identity and therefore a deeper sense of their own purpose as disciples. 

This doesn't mean they got it right away. As they came back down the mountain, Peter, James and John remained confused (in Mark's Gospel, the disciples are confused a good bit of the time). But events like the Transfiguration peel away layer upon 1ayer from their hearts and minds until with the grace of the Holy Spirit they have gradually become able to follow with their whole lives the command of God, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him." 
Just as the disciples neeped moments of transfiguration in their lives to begin to comprehend both Jesus' identity and their roles as disciples, we too can change if we will "listen to him." The voice of God will become audible to us this Lent if we can approach our prayer, fasting and almsgiving as whole-heart­ed opportunities for our own transfigu­ration, our own "new vision" of Jesus Christ. Though we too may feel con­fused a good bit of the time, we can certainly believe that God wants us to have every chance possible to turn a new corner, to move from winter to spring in our lives of faith. As we pre­pare to approach Easter and come face to face with the heart of our salvation through Jesus' suffering, death and res­urrection, we can see Christ at work anew in our lives. This week and each week that follows will bring change, growth and signs of new life. It's spring. Listen to him!

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Must not m_arginalize m_ale sexual abuse victim_s 
This past week was sexual assault awareness week at Notre Dame. It was a much needed event. The surprisingly low amount of reported cases of sexual abuse at Notre Dame is not due to a lack of sex­ual abuse but rather a lack of reporting. Women and men are raped and sexually abused at Notre Dame -there is just a multiplicity of factors that deter abuse vic­tims from speaking out. 
I attended the awareness dinner "A  Time to Heal" at Legends this past Friday night. It was truly a remarkable event. The dinner guests were addressed by a panel of five speakers: two female rape survivors, the president of Men Against Violence, Anthropologist professor Carolyn Nordstrom and Theology chair John Cavadini. The bravery and courage of the two young women who spoke about their experiences stunned the audience. They spoke poignantly and articulately, announcing that they would not be silent -announcing that sexual abuse is a real issue for the students of Notre Dame. 
I applaud this much needed movement at Notre Dame. Even though this move­ment will resUlt in more reported rapes and abuses, and therefore a smudged public image, the University must push this initiative forward. Thankfully, this is slowly being done. I would now like to add to the momentum of this movement by offering a constructive critique. 
Male sexual abuse survivors are a nationally under-acknowledged demo­graphic-Notre Dame's sexual abuse awareness campaign is potentially falling victim to this same problem. While sexual abuse done towards women is statistically greater then that done towards men, it ought not to overshadow the reality of the tragedy of male sexual abuse. For instance, the Feb. 26 edition of "Scholastic" chose a regrettable wording that plays to this unfortunate trend of marginalization towards male sexual abuse survivors. "Scholastic" reads: "According to the U.S. Department of Justice, an estimated one out of four col­lege women will be victims of an attempt­ed or completed sexual assault in one school year alone, whereas only one out of six men will be sexually assaulted in his entire lifetime." There are several prob­lems with this sentence. 
Firstly, the sentence structure is com­paratively exploring two different statis­tics. This is deceptive because these two different statistics cannot truly be meas­ured to each other. The first statistic regarding women quantifies the likelihood of an "attempted or completed sexual assault" whereas the statistic for the males is only addressing completed sexual assaults and not attempted sexual assaults. If the sentence must be compar­ative at all, why couldn't it compare th~ same thing? 

Secondly, the wording of the sentence diminishes the importance of male sexual abuse as compared to female sexual abuse. The key word here is "only." The sentence first gives the statistics for females, then uses the word "whereas" in order to make a comparison, then uses the word "only" to minimize the second­ary statistic of male sexual abuse. Why did that word need to be in the sentence? The sentence would have read fine with­out it. 
There is no "only" when speaking about sexual abuse. It does not matter how much the second statistic is less then the first, when speaking about an issue with the gravity of sexual abuse there is no "only." One male who is sexually abused is a tragedy that must not be brushed aside. 
The dinner, "A Time to Heal" was an important event that had many powerful moments. Unfortunately, it only gave a polite "nod of the head" towards male sexual abuse victims and focused almost exclusively on female sexual abuse. It would have been great ifthere could have been a representative speaker for males who had been sexually abused. If the sta­tistics are correct, that room had plenty of male sexual abuse survivors sitting there as their painful experiences were largely being ignored and minimized. The talk from the president of Men Against Violence, telling his "lads" that this is a man's problem, certainly did not help either. The issue of sexual abuse is not a "female issue" or a "male issue." It is a person issue. Whether or not we know who they are, we all know people who have been sexually abused. 
The Notre Dame sexual awareness movement is important, absolutely neces­sary, and making a good start. It must be attentive though not to marginalize the male minority group of sexual abuse sur­vivors.

Recipe for success for Irish in tourney: toughness 
If Notre Dame wants to do well this weekend, it is going to have to be the toughest team in Connecticut for at least four days. 
That isn't 
to say the Irish aren't a talented team. Their 21 wins ­including 10 in the always com­petitive Big 

East -and Jay Fitzpatrick four players in double 
Managing
figures speaks for Editor itself. But so does the play of Notre Dame's potential opponents in the tournament. 
Even though Notre Dame's first game is against two teams limping into the conference tournament -St. John's has lost six of its last seven and Syracuse has only three wins in its last 13 games -Irish coach Muffet McGraw said her team's games against those two were both tight matchups. 
"They were both really good games. The St. John's game we had to defend the 3-point line to win and that was a very close game," she said. "And the Syracuse game was close throughout." 
Notre Dame beat the Red Storm 70-67 on Jan. 17 and the Orange 90-79 on Feb. 24. 
But in the conference quarter­finals, things start to get inter­esting. The Irish replay Villanova, which had a murder­ous finish to its conference sea­son. 
The Wildcats waited until the end of February before playing Pitt, Louisville and Connecticut -the top three teams in the conference -and two of those games were on the road. And after a disappointing loss to South Florida to end the regular season, Villanova will no doubt be hungry for a win to flash in front of the NCAA Selection Committee. 
And even if the Irish make it past Villanova, there looms UConn -the undefeated, top­ranked, seemingly unstoppable juggernaut of women's basket­ball. 
The Irish have put up the best Davidic fight against the goliath Huskies, losing by only 10 points in Hartford on Feb. 22. Although McGraw hesitated say­ing her team played close with Connecticut, that was UConn's smallest margin of victory for the season and Notre Dame's 6­0 lead early was its largest deficit all season. 
But that's what Notre Dame has going for it. The team is made up of, in McGraw's own word, fighters. 
"When they get down by a few points it doesn't bother them. They can take a punch and give punches," she said. "They can get that killer instinct." 

No more evident was that when the Irish played Vanderbilt earlier this season, overcoming an 18-point deficit to win by two on the road. 
"We just don't want to lose," Irish forward Becca Bruszewski said. "You wouldn't be playing college basketball if you wanted to lose." 
The fighter's attitude goes throughout the entire team. 
Center Erica Williamson's" self­professed favorite thing about playing defense is taking charges. 
McGraw said guards Lindsay Schrader and Melissa Lechlitner play with a great deal of pas­sion, all of which trickles down to the rest of the team. 
Anyone who has seen junior guard Ashley Barlow play in the last few years knows she must be closing in on the NCAA record for most times falling down in a career. But she always gets up and gets right back to work, no matter how many different bags of ice she has to schlep to the interview room after the game. 
McGraw said that this "blue­collar attitude" is not a new development, and she's right. 
Last year's starting point guard Tulyah Gaines would do what it took to get the ball in the hoop, if that meant dishing it oiT or knowing when to control of the game -just like Lechlitner. 
Former guard Breona Gray did a lot of things that wouldn't show up in the stats, things like accepting defensive responsibili­ties against the top scorers from the other team -just like McGraw will soon ask freshman Fraderica Miller to do. 
The Irish need to make sure they bring this mindset with them to Hartford, because it is the best cure for what has ailed the Irish all season long. 
When they have failed to score, tough, gritty defimse has kept them in games. When they have needed an extra rebound or two to secure a lead, some-one -usually Barlow or Schrader -has found a way to rise above the rest and grab the board. When they have played teams they seemingly had no business running with -like Connecticut -they have found a way to grind it out for 40 min­utes and hang with some of the top teams in the nation. 

And when they've gotten punched, they punch back.

Bruszewski' s ability to shoot the 3 helps Irish offense run 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Managing Editor 
When Irish forward Becca Bruszewski started shooting 3s this season, it didn't surprise coach Muftet McGraw. 
Sure, the sophomore had only taken two shots from beyond the arc during her freshman season (making one of them), and so what if she was supposed to be a post player for the Irish. 
The thing that surprised McGraw was that Bruszewski hadn't been taking that shot all along. 
"Last year, we were at practice and we were doing this -drill that requires you to shoot a lot of 3s and [BruszewskiJ didn't take any," McGraw said. "In high school she had shot 3s, in MU she had shot 3s. And I said to her, 'How come you never shoot 3s? It's practice, now's the time to shoot them.' And she kind of was like, 'Oh, I didn't know I was allowed.'" 
Bruszewski (pronounced brew­SHEFF -ski) herself admitted to being unsure of knowing exactly how she fit into the offense last sea­son. 
"I didn't know my role on the team. And then I talked with coach and she kept telling me that I can go 
It's been a good thing for Notre Dame's offense that Bruszewski fig­ured that out, because she has been one of the top producers for the Irish this season, and her 10.9 points per game is third on the team. She is also making 38.3 per­cent of her 3s. 
McGraw said it is good for the team that she hangs out on the edge because she is more comfortable facing the basket. 
"She's not a back-to-the-basket, drop step, power player. She's a finesse player. And her strength is in her versatility that she can face the basket, it makes her harder to guard," McGraw said. "She has shot the ball well and that has helped her, because she's shot the ball well and gained some confidence." 
Recently, McGraw said, the Irish playbook has been reconfigured to add plays designed for Bruc;;zewski. That's panned out well for the 6­foot-1 forward, who has averaged 
15.2 points and 6.6 rebounds in the last nine games. 
"I think coach gave me the green light. She wants me, if I'm the first post down there, to post up and drop from there or take it off the drive. She has given me a lot of free­dom," Bruszewski said of her play since the reins have been taken off. 
McGraw said she saw glimpses of 


out of the offense," Bruszewski said. 'Tm more of a creative player, I look for openings and try to get the ball there and attack. She basically gave me permission to go outside of the offense, and I didn't know I could do that." 
As for the 3-pointers, that's some­thing she worked on over the sum­mer during pickup games with her teammates.

"I remember thinking she plays best in the big games," she said. "We were at Maryland, she played well. We had Connecticut, she played well. Rutgers, she played well. All the top teams, she was playing well."

"Night and day" 
Schrader had the skills and confidence since her freshman year. Against Boston College her freshman year in the NCAA Tournament, she dropped a career-high 29 points. Four days into practice sophomore year, however, she tore her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and missed the entire season. Junior year, she came back and scored 10.3 points per game. This season, her game has flown to new heights. 
"It's been night and day," McGraw said. "She's become so much more vocal. She's playing a bigger role within the team in terms of leadership. She's been our go to player." 

Before, McGraw said, 
Schrader had a business-like 
approach to the game and did­
n't take it as lightly as she 
could have. Now, McGraw said, 
Schrader understands that 
enjoying the game will allow 
her to play better. 
"I think before it was all bas­
ketball," she said. "I think now 
she's just as serious about bas­
ketball, but there's an edge of 
fun to it, which has helped her 
game." 
The fact that Schrader can 
get a medical redshirt arid play 
next year with the same team­
mates has created better con­
nections with the team, 
McGraw said. 
"She's closer to this team. I 
think there's a chemistry, like 
its' a better chemistry than it 
has been," McGraw said. "She 
was a little more aloof in her 
first couple years. I think she 
sees her role a little different­
ly." 
Don't let all this talk of a fun­
loving player fool ybu: 
Schrader is as intense as they 
come. Watch her drive the lane 
with the shot clock winding 
down or out-rebound an oppos­
ing post player three inches 
taller than her and it's immedi­
ately apparent. 
"[Her teammates] always 
respected her leadership by 
example but they love her 
intensity," McGraw said. "They 
love when she makes a big shot 
and gets excited and looks 
excited after making a shot, I 
think that fires them up. They 
really like in the huddles when 
she can bring some intensity." 
In fact, McGraw said, Schrader's intensity makes her the go-to player in a close game. McGraw used words like toughness, intensity and com­petitiveness to describe .Schrader, but her analysis of Schrader's ability to play well 
under pressure says it all. 
"When we're down, she 
wants the ball, and when we 
absolutely have to have a bas­
ket, she wants the ball," 
McGraw said. 
Off the court 
Schrader said people would be surprised to see how relaxed she is when not playing basketball. 
"Everyone probably thinks I'm so focused, mean, stuck up, b****, stuff like that, but off the court I am so relaxed, easy­going, I try to be a liitle funny," she said. "I have a totally dif­ferent aspect outside the court. And I think that's good to have." 
Schrader enjoys "Grey's Anatomy" ("If I have a game Thursday I have to record it and watch another time") and "Life." If she gets the chance when the team has two days off, the Bartlett, Ill. native will go home. 
"I just go home for a night just to get away from it," she said. "Seeing these girls all the time, don't get me wrong, I love them. I love my coaches. But it's good to get away for a while. It just helps you clear your mind." 
Schrader has '"torn defenses apart on the court lately. She's led the team in both scoring and rebounding in Jour of the last five games, including a 23­point performance in a win over Syracuse on her birthday. 
She said she knows what to expect this weekend at the Big East tournament in the XL Center in Hartford, Conn., and she doesn't care who she plays -except for the teams the Irish lost to. She's well aware that with a win Saturday over the winner of Friday's Syracuse-St. John's game, Notre Dame faces Villanova, whom the Irish lost to on the road. Should they win that, they get No. 1 Connecticut. 
"I know the atmosphere, I know what ittakes to win," she said. "We're going to come in with confidence, at least I am, and have some fun."

No.5 seed Irish face winner of Syraruse-St John's 
Team has first-round bye, plays its first game on Saturday 
By BILL BRINK Sports Editor 
The Irish need rest, and they earned an extra day of it. No. 20 Notre Dame enjoys a first-round. bye in the Big East champi­onship this weekend at the XL Center in Hartford, Conn. 
Notre Dame (21-7, 10-6 Big East) got the No. 5 seed in the tournament, which in the new 16-team format gives it a bye. On Saturday at noon, the Irish play the winner o( Friday's matchup between No. 12 seed Syracuse· and No. 13 seed St. John's. 
Irish coach Muffet McGraw said she likes the new tourna­ment format. 
"I think it's a good format," she said. "We'll have to go through it a couple of years before we can really tell, but I think it's a great idea." 
Notre Dame has won four of five heading into the tourna­ment with the only loss coming to top-ranked, No. 1-seed, unde­feated Connecticut at home. 
"''m kind of looking at it as we played five good games in a row," McGraw said. "We have a lot of offensive momentum, I would say." . 
More than that, McGraw said everyone on the team, freshmen to senior, has contributep of late. She said while the senior guard Lindsay Schrader and sophomore forward Becca Bruszewski have gotten most of the attention, everyone else has chipped in. 
"I feel like all the starters are playing well, and it's a really good feeling going in. every­body's contributing," McGraw said. 
Freshman forward Kellie Watson, McGraw said, has passed the ball well recently. Watson turned down several open looks in Notre Dame's last game, a 72-66 win over West Virginia at home Monday, to pass to teammates. 
"She's a fantastic passer, and that's something that I thought when I saw her in high school is really her greatest strength," McGraw said. "She has great visions and can get the ball out of her hands so quickly." 
Watson had three assists in each of the last two games. She also broke a four-game stretch without hitting a 3-pointer when she sank one against the Mountaineers. 
McGraw also mentioned junior guard Melissa Lechlitner, who went through a scoring drought recently, as someone who's play­inff better. In the five games before the West Virginia game, Lechlitner shot 29.7 percent from field goal range, but made 4-of-9 shots Monday. 
Finally; junior center Erica Williamson has surged in the past three games. She scored 20 and 21 points back to back against DePaul and Georgetown in early January, but never topped six points for the next 10 games. Against Syracuse, how­ever, she scored 18 and had 11 rebounds, and s6e scored 13 against West Virginia. 


The Irish have faced both the Red Storm and the Orange recently and won both times. They beat St. John's 70-67 at home on Jan. 17, and the Orange 90-79 at home on Feb. 24. 
"They were both really good games," McGraw said. "The St. John's game we had to defend the 3-point line to win, and then the Syracuse game was very close throughout." 

That defense, McGraw said, still leaves something to be desired. The team worked on it during practice Wednesday, McGraw said. She did say, how­ever, that she was happy with where the offense was. 
Both teams present similar challenges to the Irish, McGraw said. 
"They're both really athletic, they both have quickness ­they're a little bit quicker than we are," McGraw said. "They'll both play some zone and some man. We're trying to find some new wrinkles and new things to do coming into the tournament, but it's nice that we've played them both recently so we have some film on them." 
Note: 
uMcGraw said the team need­ed rest, so they took practice off on Tuesday and will take prac­tice off again today.

Lent brings certain challenges to the student who frequents the Notre Dame dining hall. What to do on those meatless Fridays? You have two choices: Embrace it or work around it. This week's column is geared towards giving you tips about what to make on Fridays for the next couple of weeks (without simply abandon­ing the dining hall for Subway). Never fear, the Dining Hall Dish is here to help. 
1. Know your proteins. Without the obvious choice -meat -you may be looking for another option. Other foods high in pro­tein are: fish, and especially tuna, eggs, nuts and seeds (try peanut butter or adding seeds and nuts to your salads), beans (try tofu or the various beans available at the salad and Mexican bars), cheese and yogurt. · 
2. Think up new ways to serve the above protein-packed items with these ideas: 
Mash up black beans and mix with olive oil in order to make a great spread to add to your sand­wich. 
Take a sweet or a baked potato and add a mixture of black beans, tomatoes and a little bit of sour cream and cheese. For an even quicker meal, just pour a little chili over a baked potato. 
Don't stick with plain tuna, kick it up. Try taking either the salad bar tuna or the sandwich bar tuna spread and mixing in ingre­dients like olives and even corn. Then layer on cheese and spinach and give it a good toast in the Panini maker to make it into a great tuna melt. If you're not a tuna fan, you can take the same idea and apply it to egg salad. 

Instead of adding meatballs to your spaghetti, look for other options. Try adding in some cooked vegetables and extra cheese to make it a little heartier. 
3. Make an excellent salad. Salad is so much more than just a bunch of green stuff. Try out all of those things on the salad bar and load it up with lots of flavor and vitamins. 
4. 
Take advantage of the new things in the dining hall. The North pizza bar usually offers pesto sauce more often, both din­ing halls try out sushi and usually crab meats appears at the stir fry bar (You can even request it to use in other things. It would make a great addition to a salad or pasta). Keep an eye out and you might find something really worth the try. 

5. 
Deal. It might be annoying sometimes, but hey, it's only one day a week. Listen to your mom's good advice and eat your vegeta­bles instead.

Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -The 
winter of discontent in 
Mannywood is over. 
Manny Ramirez and the 
Los Angeles Dodgers official­
ly agreed Wednesday on a 
$45 miRion, two-year con­
tract that keeps him with the 
NL West champions. The 
slugger can void the second 
season ofthe deal and again 
become a free agent. 
The stalemate was broken 
during a 6 a.m. meeting that 
brought the sides face-to­
face at owner Frank 
McCourt's Malibu home. The 
gathering came after weeks 
of protracted negotiations 
that led to starts, stops, 
offers and subsequent rejec­
tions. 

At times, McCourt's frus­tration with Ramirez's agent Scott Boras surfaced, with the owner describing the agent as "challenging to work with." 
All that was forgotten on a rainy late-winter morning when Ramirez surfaced in the Malibu mist to rejoin the team and city that embraced him after he left Boston at the July 31 trade deadline. 
"We got a great meeting," Ramirez told KCAL-TV as he emerged from a mandatory physical in suburban Inglewood. ''I'm happy to be here. We got some unfin­ished business, and that's why I'm here." 
The Dodgers confirmed the deal shortly after Ramirez passed the physi­cal. He is set to meet with the media Thursday morn­ing in Phoenix. 
Ramirez gets $10 million this year, and $15 million in deferred money with no interest, payable in $5 mil­lion installments each Jan. 15 from 2010 through 2012. If it winds up as a two-year deal, he gets $10 million each season, with three pay­ments of $8,333,333 each Jan. 15 from 2011-13. 
Ramirez has until November to decide whether to void the second season. 
Los Angeles' original offer was for $45 million in guar­anteed money, including a $4 million buyout of a 2011 option, and gave the Dodgers the ability to main­tain control of Ramirez through 2012. It also did not include the no-trade provi­sion. 
Ramirez will make a $1 million commitment to the Dodge~ Dream Foundation as part of the deal. 
"We are thrilled that Manny wants to be a Dodger and that he has made such a tremendous commitment to the Los Angeles communi­ty," McCourt said in a state· ment. "We witnessed some­thing very special last year in the way that. our fans con­nected with him and the manner in which the team came together. Now, we focus our complete and undivided attention on our primary goal, winning a world championship."

NBA 
Carmelo vows to adhere to coach's policies 
After blatantly ignoring Nuggets head coach George Karl, Anthony was suspended one game this week 
Associated Press 
DENVER -Nuggets star Carmela Anthony says he wish­es George Karl would have kept his insubordination a secret but promises next time his coach tries to sub for him, he'll sprint right to the bench like a kid lunging for an empty seat at musical chairs. 
"I'm going to run. I'm going to run to the bench. I'm going to run hard to the bench," Anthony pledged Wednesday after practicing with the team for the first time since his one­game suspension for refusing to come out of Denver's game at Indiana on Sunday night. 
Anthony, who had been mired in a shooting funk, had just hit a couple of shots late in the third quarter against the Pacers and said he felt his hot hand merited his staying in the game, so he refused to be subbed for Linas Kleiza. 
Karl was incredulous. 

"There was not much anger there. It was more of a shock when it happened," Karl said Wednesday. "We sat down and decided that was kind of the mantra of our season, to be more focused, more disciplined, more professional. 
"And that crossed the line." 

So, after conferring with the team's brain trust, Karl sus­pended Anthony for the Nuggets' game Tuesday night at Detroit. 
Anthony watched the Pistons' 100-95 win from the team hotel and rejoined his teammates afterward for the flight home, then met with Karl before Wednesday's workout. 
"It was just me wanting to be in there, wanting to play, want­ing to finish that run that we just had," Anthony explained in his first public comments about the incident. ... If I was wrong, I was wrong. .I don't think I can be wrong for wanting to win a basketball game and trying to help my team win." 
Karl said there was a thin line between passionate play and insubordination and his star player crossed it by cross­ing the coach. 
"I didn't want to come out," Anthony said. "If you look at it that deeply, then yeah, I maybe was wrong. I should have come out of the game, but if you're a basketball player, you know how you feel when you get something going finally and you're about to sit, your com­petitiveness all comes out." 

What Karl wanted was for Anthony to come out. 
"I think it was a combination of different feelings, he wasn't playing very well and he finally made some shots and his reac­tion was overboard," Karl said. 
"And I get to play policeman." Anthony said he should have gotten off with a warning. 
"Well, I mean, when some­body comes to sub you out, I guess you're supposed to go out. Like I said, it was one of those things where I felt like I wanted to stay in the game and make a run and try to win that game," Anthony said. 
"In my eyes I thought the sit­uation was minute," he added. "Nobody knew what happened. ... Some of my teammates didn't even know what happened. The only people who knew was me, George and the person that was 
coming to sub me in." That's not the point, Karl said. 
To understand Karl's reac­tion, it helps to remember that he found himself in a somewhat similar situation in Milwaukee several years ago when he was coaching the Bucks and Tim Thomas refused to return to the court in the final minute of a blowout at Dnnver. 
Karl wanted to suspend Thomas, but team owner llerb Kohl wouldn't go along with it, reasoning that nobody had seen him refusing Karl's instruc­tions, so it was best to keep a lid on it. Karl lost that argu­ment and his relationship with both Thomas and Kohl cooled after that. 
This time, the Nuggets backed Karl 100 percent, and Karl made his point loud and 

dear. 
"As an organization, we talked about it and we had to ... come down in a strong way," Karl said. 
''I'm not a big believer in sus­pensions. I don't necessarily like them. I think they're prob­ably more uncomfortable to me than anybody," Karl said. "But I think there's certain situations where they are necessary." 
Interestingly, Anthony never apologized for his actions, either in his chat with the media or his 20-minute meeting with Karl. 
"I think there was just a mov­ing on kind of conversation," Karl said. "I don't know if the word 'apology' was there, but I think we all foe! that we're in a good place. We're excited about the challenge and it's best right now to forget about it and move on." 
Anthony, who will return to action Thursday night against Portland, and Karl both said there was no rift between them. 
"I never had any words with George. We never had an argu­ment. It was just, you know, he took a stance on what hap­pened and the result was a sus­pension," Anthony said. 
And he said he understands Karl's position. 
"lie's got to do his job. lie's got to coach. We've got to play. I mean, at all times during the 82-game season, everybody's not going to always agree, and that was just one of them times I didn't agree," Anthony said. "I didn't want to come out of the game." 
Anthony said it won't happen again, and Karl said he believes him.

lzzo keeps promise _ 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. ­Tom Izzo is ready to pay the price for winning the Big Ten title. 
With his hair. 
After the No. 8 Spartans held off Indiana 64-59 on Tuesday, clinching their first outright conference crown in a decade, Izzo said he would fulfill the promise he made to students last fall by shaving his head -after the NCAA tournament. 
"I lie to my other people, but I don't lie to my stu­dents, which will be embar­rassing," the Spartans coach said. ''I'm not going to embarrass my team in the 
NCAA tournament. I'm going to wait till it's all over and embarrass my wife then." 
His players, of course, are ready to pull out the razor now. 
But Izzo thinks the Spartans (24-5, 14-3) have plenty of work ahead to get ready for next week's Big Ten tournament and the NCAAs the week after that. 
He was disappointed with his team's inability to put away a short-handed Hoosiers team that has now lost eight straight and played most of the game without leading scorer Devan Dumes, who appeared to injure his right knee less than four minutes in and did not return. 
Kalin Lucas scored 15 points and Raymar Morgan had 14 points and seven rebounds, including a thun­derous dunk off a rebound with 27.5 seconds to pre­serve the victory. The two also combined to make three free throws in the final 16 seconds to seal it. 
"We struggled, we just didn't have the energy tonight and maybe I should u n d e r s-t a n d t h a t .... b u t I don't," Izzo said. "They had a lot to do with it. They just played hard and they hurt 
us." 
Indiana (6-23, 1-16) was led by VerdeII Jones with 15 points. 
Nick Williams and Malik Story each had 11, and the three combined to lead tbe Hoosiers back from a 13­point deficit with 9:10 to go. Indiana was within 59-57 with 3:31 left but failed to convert on four opportuni­ties to tie the score or take the lead. 
Instead, they finished their home season with the fewest wins (5) since 1969­70 and tied the school record for worst home win­ning percentage (.333), set by the 1943-44 team that went 3-6.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING 
Athletes tune up before nationals 
By NATHANIEL LEE 
Sports Writer 
Coming off of its unprece­dented 13th consecutive Big East championship, Notre Dame traveled to West Lafayette, Ind. for the Purdue Boiler-Make-It Invitationals, a final qualifier and tune-up before the NCAA Zone Diving and Swimming Championships. 
"We went out there to try and improve times in order to possibly make the NCAA Championships," Irish coach Brian Barnes said. "The 200 relay team accomplished that." 
Early in the Boiler-Make-It lnvitationals, Irish juniors Megan Farrell and Ashlee Edgell made an impact, finish­ing first and second, respec­tively, in the 200-meter indi­vidual medley. But their times of 2:01.10 and 2:04.11 were short of the NCAA B-cut. 
In the 100-meter backstroke, Irish junior Maggie Behrens swam to a second-place time of 55.41, but also came just short of a qualifying time. 
In the 100-meter butterfly time trial, sophomore Kellyn Kuhlke found her stroke, 200-meter medley relay also fell this season at the hands of Kuhlke, freshman Colleen Fotsch and sophomores Samantha Maxwell and Amywren Miller. Their first-. place time of 1:39.29 was good enough to land the final Irish NCAA B-Cut. 
"For the NCAA Championships, an A-Cut is an automatic berth, and then the rankings [of times] determine which B-Cut qualifiers will make it," Barnes said. Right now we have between two and four athletes that are hoping to get that opportunity." 
Next on the schedule for the Irish is the NCAA Zone Diving Championships, where divers Natalie Stitt, a junior, and Heidi Grossman, a sophomore, will look to make a splash. The qualifying divers will (ravel to Minneapolis, Minn., March 13 to compete. 
"Right now the athletes who might continue are training hard to just get faster," Barnes said. "We just focus on getting better in order to swim fastest at nationals and being able to make an impact there." 
The Irish swimmers will have to wait an extra week, before leaving for College Station, Texas, to compete for

Dive,rs prepare for Zone C co111petition 
By MIKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 

Notre Dame's divers will look to continue their strong season at the NCAA Zone C Diving Championships in Minneapolis on March 13. 
The Irish will boast a good deal of experience in the meet, as four of their five participants competed in the event last year. 
Senior captain Michael Bulfin leads the way for the Irish and will be com­peting in the Zone Championships for the fourth consecutive year. Bulfin is coming off a strong performance a't last month's Big East champi­onships in which the All­American finished second in both the 1-meter and 3­meter diving events. 
Last season, the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., native finished in sixth place in the 1-meter at the Zone Championships and later moved on to beeome to the first diver in Notre Dame history to scorn points at the NCAA championships. 
Sophomores Erie Lex, Wesley Villaflor and 
Nathan Geary will each return to the event for the second consecutive season. Each diver performed well in Notre Dame's first-place finish at the Big East championships. 
Lex was consistent at the event, finishing fifth in the 1-meter event and third in the 3-meter event. Villaflor finished fourth in the 1-meter and seventh in the 3-meter while Geary finished ninth in the 1­meter and fifth in the 3­meter. Each diver is look­ing to advance to the finals for the first time in his career. 
Irish junior Caleb Dunnichay will make his first trip to the event. The Elwood, Ind., native was the most consistent Irish diver at the Big East championships besides Bulfin. Dunnichay finished third in the 1-meter and fourth in the 3-meter. 
Competition at the NCAA Zone C Championships begins at 1 p.m. at the University Aquatic Center on the campus of the University of Minnesota.

Wade's Heat beat Phoenix 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -Shaquille O'Neal knocked Dwyane Wade to the ground, then stood over him for a few seconds, seeming almost unsure of what to do. 
Didn't matter. Wade was great once again -and his teammates picked him up when he needed the lift. 
Wade scored 35 points and tied his career high with 16 assists, Michael Beasley and Daequan Cook both had career highs on the way to a combined 55 points off Miami's bench. The Heat spoiled O'Neal's first trip back to South Florida since last year's trade with a 135-129 win over the Phoenix Suns on Wodnesday night. 
"It wasn't about the story line of Shaq coming back for us," Wade said. "We really needed this win." 
Beasley scored 28 points ­the most by a Heat player besides Wade this season ­and nine rebounds. Cook added 27 points and Miami led for all but a portion of the opening minutes on the way to the sec­ond-highest point total in fran­chise history.

"You always hear people talk about Crysti and the incredible player that she is, so to be rec­ognized with the best of the best is an incredible feeling," Byers said. 
Notre Dame hopes to keep up its winning streak over the break as they will play three games, two of them away and against ranked teams. After facing Dartmouth, the Irish will travel to Disney World to take on No. 19 James Madison Wednesday. They finish up the week back home with a match against Hofstra next Saturday. 
Notre Dame has won its only road game, defeating Duquesne 22-7 in the season opener. The only loss this sea­son was against No.1 Northwestern, who beat the Irish 21-5 in Notre Dame's home opener. The Irish came back that same weekend against Ohio State, winning 14-11. 
The Irish have had an over­all strong showing on the field this season, both offensively and defensively. Sciosia leads the team in points with 15 ­10 goals and five assists. She's followed by Byers (13), Blaney 
(11) and sophomore midfielder Kailene Abt (10). In the net, Goodman has made 33 saves in over 200 minutes of playing time this year. 
Notre Dame, who will try to keep its winning streak going, will face Dartmouth this Saturday at 12 p.m. to start off spring break play.

between the Irish and a full qualifying squad is reigning national champion Ohio State, who will be hosting the regional in Columbus, Ohio. 
"The problem is the differ­ence between us and them is so low that one day victory will be for them and another it will be for us," Irish coach Janusz Bednarski said. "It was this way the whole year; our victories were minimal and their victories were minimal." 
Bednarski believes the outcome will once again be very close this weekend, but he said the team that exhibits the best form and the best technique on the strip will finish the regional on top. 
Both the Irish male and female squads will send full teams to the event after qualifying the maximum number of fighters. According to NCAA regula­tions, the Irish can send twelve men and twelve women as a result of the fencers' highly successful individual and team sea­sons. 
But the Buckeyes will also likely be sending full squads in both the men's and women's individual competi­tions. The best twenty-four fighters from both universi­ties will advance to repre­
sent the Midwest region in the championships in Pennsylvania. 
"We will have to qualify the full team to the final if we want to be in the top four in the future," Bednarski said. "That is the main goal." 
The Irish have a golden opportunity to exact revenge on their regional rival fol­lowing last weekend's sec­ond-place finish at the hands of the Buckeyes. More importantly, the fencers need a convincing win in Columbus to ensure the highest possible chance of success in the finals in late March. 
As they have done all sea­son, the fencing teams will look to their cast of talented yet inexperienced under­classmen to carry them to the finals. 
"Our kids are doing very well in their relation to stress and tension during the matches, when one touch decides history," Bednarski said. "I believe we can get our rivals one day and win a big event, but they have to grow. They have to learn and get more experience in how to behave in the stressful moments in our sport."

"I know Golden will be in here and strike out a bunch of times, then go out and get four hits," Pollock said. "He's just a gamer." 
Pollock has hit .333 and is 4­of-4 in stolen base attempts. He said slow starts in previous seasons motivated him to play well early this season. To help him achieve that, Pollock said he's taken more batting prac­tice to work on getting game­ready rather than working on fundamentals with a batting tee.

for the Irish when they take the Joyce Center court against St. John's. Friday's game will serve as Senior Night, and the team's four graduating seniors -Kyle McAlarney, Ryan Ayers, Zach Hillesland .and Luke Zeller ­will all be honored before the game. 
For a group that has grown particularly close over their· four years in South Bend, Friday's game will be an emo­tional experience. 
"I got sick to my stomach. I actually almost threw up the other day thinking about it; lit­erally," McAlarney s·aid. "It's crazy. This place really means a lot to me. This program really means a lot to me. It's pretty r:nw:;h been my whole life in the time that I. was here. Emotions are going to be flying high on Friday." 
"It's going to be all team­mate-based," llillesland said in reference to how he'll remem­ber his four years at Notre Dame. "Certainly I have some on-court memories here and there, but if anyone asks me about my time at Notre Dame, what my favorite thing was, it's always going to be the team­mates that I've had and the friendships that I've developed. 
Hillesland added: "I don't usually view myself as very sentimental. But I can say that now, but who knows what's going to happen when they call my name and I walk out with my mom and sister and I'm kind of treating it like any other game. I think I'll have my emo­tions in check, but you never really know until you get out there." 
Despite Notre Dame's strug­gles this season, this year's group of !ieniors has a lot to be proud of about its time in South Bend. In 2007, they were part of the first Irish team to make the NCAA Tournament since 2003. One year later, all four played major roles in helping Notre Dame back to the NCAA Tournament and challenging for the Big East regular season title in the process. 
They were also major pa.rts of the Irish teams (2006-2009) that put together the nation's longest home winning streak of 45 that ended earlier this sea­son against Connecticut. 
"It's probably the total pack­age of guys that have been a part of a lot of winning overall ... but how they've handled their business academically and how they represented their business and the University, I'm really proud of," Brey said. "Four really, as they say, class acts, who've had great runs for us. Been through a lot of highs and a lot of lows." 
For the seniors, ending their home careers on a high is not a given. Despite the fact that St. John's currently sits tied for 12th place in the conference standings -two spots behind Notre Dame -the Red Storm defeated the Irish 71-66 when the two teams met in New York on Jan. 3. 
In that game, Notre Dame was unable to stop St. John's guard D.J. Kennedy, who racked up 20 points on 6-of-10 shooting to go along with 10 rebounds. The Irish offense was plagued by poor shooting in that contest as the team made only 4-of-17 three-point field goals.

MEN'S TENNIS 

Irish look to capitalize on victory 
By CHRIS MICHALSKI 
Sports Writer 

Notre Dame finished a stretch of six games in two weeks with a 5-2 win over Michigan Wednesday. Strong singles play was the key to the victory, with the Irish taking first through fifth singles. 
The Wolverines swept the three doubles matches, giving them an early 1-0 lead. Irish sophomore Tyler David played his first singles match since Feb. 21 against Ohio State, but fell in a second set tie-breaker to Michigan's Drew Daniel. The rest of the Irish players won their matches, ineluding No. 21 Brett Helgeson, who came from behind to defeat Jason Jung 2-6, 6-1, 6-2. 
Irish sophomore Stephen Havens defeated Michigan's

continued from page 24 

the third quarter and a late Irish rally came up short. Corrigan said North Carolina goalie Grant Zimmerman, who made 18 saves, was the key player in that game. 
"I thought that was the differ­ence in the game last year," Corrigan said. "This year we have to make sure that we take good shots, keep the pressure on him, and see if we can't get some more by him." 
That shouldn't be a problem for the Irish offense if they can replicate their performance from last weekend, a 19-goal outburst against Dartmouth. Notre Dame has spread the points around, as 14 different players have scored this season. Senior Duncan Swezey was the man against the Big Green with five goals, but juniors Neal Hicks and Grant Krebs have also reg­istered hat tricks for the Irish this year. 
"That, to me, is a sign of not just the quality of our depth but Andrew Mazlin, who coach Bobby Bayliss described as having "one of the biggest serves in college tennis." 
With the win, Notre Dame rose above .500 with a record of 8-7. The Irish will now gear up for a four-day spring break trip to California starting today. 
"The biggest thing we try to get in California is outdoor play. The· college tennis world by this time is pretty much an outdoor one, but South Bend does not always accommodate that schedule," Bayliss said. 
The Irish will have to adjust to wind conditions and alter their footwork, as the ball tends to change. directions more outside. The Irish will be attending Pacific Coast Doubles, a prestigious event featuring big-name schools like UCLA, USC, California, 
also the way that we're play­ing," Corrigan said. "We're play­ing very unselfishly, we're play­ing in a manner that's allowing a lot of people to contribute, and I think that makes you harder to defend because there's not just one guy they can look at." 
The Tar Heels, though, are similar to the Irish in many respects. Twenty-three different players have notched at least a point for them this season, with 19 different goal-scorers. Senior attack Bart Wagner leads the way with 16 goals and 7 assists, but sophomore attack Billy Bitter and redshirt junior attack Gavin Petracca have also notched 22 and 21 points, respectively. 
"They're very balanced offen­sively," Corrigan said. "Their scoring is pretty well-distributed among their attacking midfield. Their attackmen have got a lot points, but they don't generate most of their offense, a lot of that comes from the midfield." 
Zimmerman will be back in net for the Tar Heels, posting a 
6.40 GM so far on the season. For the Irish, the man between the pipes will be senior Scott Stanford and Pepperdine. 
"Our guys are pretty excited about [the Pacific Coast Doubles], so motivation will not be a problem," Bayliss said. 
As the season progresses toward playoffs, Bayliss said his team must improve its doubles play and get more production from the lower portion of the lineup. The team is inexperienced, and maturity may be a factor come playoff time. 
"Our young guys are quite capable, but predictably have difficulty playing as well in matches as they do in prac­tice," Bayliss said. 
The Irish return home March 28 and 29 against South Florida and Illinois. 
Contact Chris Michalski at jmichal2@nd.edu 
Rodgers, who has made 39 saves in just three games this season, good for an 8.08 GM. Corrigan said, though, that it would be up to the rest of the squad to make sure Rodgers is able to do his job. 
"They're playing very well offensively," he said. "And I think it's going to take a good team defensive effort to stop them." lA stingy defensive showing combined with the explosive offense of last weekend could result in a good weekend for the Irish. 
"I think we have to play well across the board," Corrigan said. "We can't falter in some area of the game because with a team as talented as they are at every position, you just can't have an area of the game where you perform poorly or they'll be there to take advantage of it." · 
The opening faceoff is set for 1 p.m. Sunday at Loftus and the game will be aired on tape delay on CBS College Sports network at 4:30 p.m. Sunday.

Going out in style? 
Hoopsters hope to win Senior Night contest against S ]U 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
After Monday's demoralizing loss to Villanova, many have accepted that Notre Dame's hopes of making the NCAA Tournament are slim, but the Irish players haven't. At the very least, that's the team's party line as it prepares for the final game of the regular season Friday against St. John's. 
"I don't think we're accepting anything," senior Ryan Ayers said about the team's postsea­son possibilities. "Anything could happen from here, so why would we give up now. We're going to come out with a lot of pride and play with a lot of heart on Friday." 
Besides the fact that their postseason lives will be on life support, emotions will be high

With spring break approach­ing, Notre Dame anticipates a long week of play in the south­western portion of the coun­try, playing a group of teams with different abilities. 
The Irish traveled to North Carolina State for the Wolfpack Invitational last weekend, only to later find out all games were cancelled due to excessive rain. 
"Not being able to play was really boring because we were just sitting in the hotel room," sophomore shortstop Katie Fleury said. "You can't do any form of activity at" all."
