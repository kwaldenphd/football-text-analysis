ND Security reports recent rash of thefts from student rooms 
'-------------------------------------------them. According to Rakow, a few 
Booster design problems existed, NASA says 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
News Editor 

The recent warm weather is part­ly to blame for the 20 thefts from rooms reported to Notre Dame Security in the last five days, Direc­tor of Security Rex Rakow said yesterday. 
"It's so nice outside that people go out, leaving the dorms empty," Rakow said. 
Most of the thefts occurred in Grace and Flanner halls, he said. None of the 20 thefts involved break-ins, but instead were from rooms with unlocked doors, he said. 
Rakow also said that 16 reported bike thefts have occurred during and since spring break. 
Stolen from the dorm rooms were cash, jewelry and credit cards, he said. The total loss ·was estimated at $1,450, he added. 
Security has made no arrests in the reported thefts from rooms, nor does it have any suspects, said Rakow. Students are not suspected of the thefts, he noted. 
Although the sunny weather might be blamed for some of theJthefts, it can't be blamed for all of

Cape Canaveral, Fla. -Atop NASA investigator said yesterday that a faulty rocket joint definitely caused the explosion of Challenger, and that engineers failed to take notice when design flaws "winked at us" on earlier flights. 
"We missed it in this joint," said 

J.R. Thompson, vice chairman of a National Aeronautics and Space Ad­ministration investigation task force. · "We missed it in the design, and I 
think  some  of  the  prior  flight  
anomalies  were  not  taken  
seriously."  

Thompson told a news confer­ence that he was positive the explo­sion was caused by a failure in the joint between the bottom two seg­ments of the right solid fuel booster rocket. 
"Clearly the failure was in that joint," he said. "Clearly that joint has to be redesigned." 
The presidential commission in­vestigating the disaster has said for weeks that the joint was the leading suspect, and other possible causes have been systematically eliminated. Thompson's statements, however, appeared to be 

the most emphatic yet on the sub­
ject. 
Thompson is deputy director for technical operations at the Plasma Physics Laboratory at Princeton Uni­versity. Before that he worked 21 years with NASA at the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala., where he managed development of the space shuttle's main engines. 
Thompson said the task force in· vestigation is focusing on possibly defective 0-rings designed to stop hot gases from escaping through the joint; on the effect of the rotation of the joint when subjected to ignition pressures; on characteristics of the putty intended to put pressure on the rings; a possible joint alignment problem, and the effect the freezing temperatures on launch day might have had on the rings or the putty. 
"It may be a combination ofsome of these factors," he said. "We're weighing each one on what part it might have played." 
Launch day photographs show a puff of black smoke spurting from the joint just after ignition and a plume of flame shooting from the area 58 seconds later. 
Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, killing the crew offive men and two women. 

Bomb scare mars Weinberger's Thailand trip 
Associated Press 
BANGKOK, Thailand -Defense 
Secretary Caspar Weinberger drew 
cheers on a border: tour and protest 
in the capital yesterday, then had 
his dinner plans changed by a bomb 
explosion in a hotel parking lot. 
The bomb, which wounded three 

people, went off about 15 feet from 
where Weinberger was to have 
passed 90 minutes later on his way 
to a state dinner at the government­
owned Erawan Hotel given by 
Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanon­
da. 
the receptionOfficials moved Hilton Hotel,and dinner to the 

where the defense secretary was staying. 
The U.S. Embassy said 

Weinberger's delegation had no comment on the explosion. Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila tole reporters that the secretary shrugg­.edit off, commenting, "Thailand is 
one of the safest places in the world. It's safer than New York." 
Narond Mahanond, chief of the national police, said the bombing was under investigation and''we at­tach great importance to this case." There was no immediate claim of responsibility. 
Earlier yesterday Weinberger toured the tense Thai-Cambodian border and got a rousing welcome from villagers who have suffered from border battles between Cam­bodian rebels and Vietnamese forces that occupy the neighboring 
country·
His trip to the frontier province of Surin was regarded as· a demonstration of U.S. support for 
Thailand against hostile, Soviet­backed neighbors in Indochina. 
Weinberger is to leave today for Australia. He visited South I<9rea, Japan and the Philippines before Thailand.

of the thefts occurred at night while students were sleeping inside. 
"We've been receiving reports of people getting up ift the morning and seeing their stuff has been stolen," he said. 
In the case of the Security officer assaulted early Sunday morning, Rakow said the three students iden­tified as responsible have admitted to the assault. The investigation into the incident has ended, he said. The officer returned to work last night. 
In the case of the student assaulted in the LaFortune Student Center early Saturday morning, Rakow said Security has made no arrests. 

Hurley celebrates birthday 
By BETH CORNWELL 
Staff Reporter 
Kevin Hurley, the Notre Dame 
freshman who was struck and in­
jured by a hit-and-run driver Sept. 
7 when crossing U.S. 31-33, 
celebrated his 19th birthday yester­
day by fixing lunch for his father. 
Since Dec. 10, Kevin has been in 
the Greenery Center, undergoing 
physical therapy, said his father, 
Richard Hurley. 
"For his birthday today, he took 
me down to the center's kitchen and 
grilled us some ham and cheese 
sandwiches," said Hurley. 
Kevin's physical condition is fair, according to Mr. Hurley. He is cur­rently being fitted for a temporary artificial limb and preparing for major surgery in early or mid-May, which will ready the muscles in the stump of his left leg for a perma­nent limb, he said. His lower left leg was amputated because of in­juries suffered in the Sept. 7 acci­dent. 
Mentally, Kevin is doing fairly well, said his father. "Hetalks all the time ... his long-term memory is great, it's the short-term which is fuzzy, like what he had for breakfast or whether things hap­pened today or yesterday. 
"When he woke up, it took a long time. It's not like on TV when they open their eyes and ask: Where am I? It's a terribly long process. His biggest concern was the loss of his leg. It still is," said Hurley. 
"I can't describe how much help we've gotten from all of you at Notre Dame. Kevin can't understand it. I mean, he was only there for a couple of weeks... he doesn't know how you could love him so much. 
"All I can ask is that you keep praying for him. Keep sending those letters and cards... he reads every one of them. Boy, it really works... he's getting better," said Hurley.

Don't dismiss complaints ­address them constructively 
"Well, if you don't like it here, why don't you leave?" 
How many more times am I going to have to hear 
this fabulous rebuttal whenever some student has a 
problem? Why is it that here at Notre Dame, where we 
are supposed to be learning new and better answers to 
old and new questions, I keep hearing this same old 
answer? Can't people think of a legitimate answer to 
students' gripes? 
I think it unreasonable for us to expect everyone to 
be totally satisfied here. If Notre Dame is everything 
that you hoped and dreamed it would be, that is great. 
The rest of us have several problems which range from 
the major to the insignificant. 
Some people can accept these problems; some peo­
ple cannot. Regardless, the problems are real. They 
have to be confronted. 
Some students would have us believe that you have 
to be totally satisfied with life here. To see anything 
other than perfection means you are deluded. 
Everyone's perception of happiness is different; 
therefore, it is ludicrous to expect everyone here to be 
totally pappy. 
Notre Dame cannot be all things to all people. 
Students should not expect it to be. 
Ifeveryone can see that, then why are some students 
so intolerant of others' complaints? 
A few weeks before break a couple of friends and I 
were arguing about some of my strongest objections 
to University life. Among the complaints were the 
alcohol policy, parietals, and no meat on Fridays. Of 
course, those immortal words of wisdom were 
spoken: "Ifyou do not like it here, leave." 
Needless to say, I was not going to sit back and let 
them say something like that without commenting. 
Just because I disagree with the administration in a 
few areas does not mean I should transfer, does it? 
According to these two, it does. To them, either you view Notre Dame as a paradise or you bite the apple and leave. 
Perhaps this philosophy should be added to duLac, and then around the beginning of second semester they can start hading out transfer applications to those students who have a gripe. 
I told my friends I was not entirely happy, but I also said I did not want to transfer. 
William Curran wrote a wonderful column in Viewpoint two days ago, April 7. He said people often complain, and some even consider transfering. Rarely does anyone do so. What keeps the students here is ''the people and the spirit that make Notre Dame special ... The special feeling is a sense of belonging, the friendly atmosphere, and helpful students who care," Curran said. "Notre Dame is still a special place despite its problems," he concluded. 
This is exactly what I told my friends. I only wish Curran had written his column earlier. 
At the time of my argument, my friends said I should stop complaining if I do not agree with the University's policies. I realize I may not be able to

change the administration's policies; however, if no one complained, no one would know anything needs to be improved. Thus, nothing would be improved. 
Or are those who complain just trouble-makers and nay-sayers? If everyone just ignores the problems, they are not going to go away on their own. An example would be the alcohol policy. Why? It is not because I think we should all be running around in a drunken frenzy, but because the policy 's value system is all wrong. 
An alcohol policy should be teaching us how to con­trol our drinking habits and about social drinking. In­stead, as a professor said, we learn to drink behind closed doors, how to sneak a beer past an RA and how to get around the rules. 
Besides, everyone knows the way the school en­forces the policy is haphazard, and changes from dorm to dorm and rector to rector. If the administra­tion is so adamant about the alcohol policy, why do I see every Friday afternoon a sea of beer being brought into the dorms? 
The administration should get its values straight. Maybe, as has been suggested, the alcohol policy is to prevent libel and the administration already bas set its values -money over students. 
So if you have a gripe or grumble, speak up. It is the only way we can hope things will change here. Maybe it will not do any good, but will silence help anything? And to my two friends with whom I was arguing, maybe I cannot do anything to change those things I dislike. 
But I am trying.

Freeze-dried pets newest way to preserve dead animals 
Associated Press 
NISSWA, Minn. -Fido or Fluffy can lie by the hearth forever thanks to the wonders of freeze-drying, says a man whose company offers pet owners a way to preserve the remains of their four-legged loved 
ones in lifelike fashion. 
"The natural thing for a human being to do is to hang on to that animal, to want to keep it," said Roger Saatzer, president of Presetv­A-Pet. "The next best thing to bring­ing it back to life is to have it freeze-dried." 
"We've done everything from rab­bits to turtles, dogs, cats, snakes and gerbils," said Saatzer. He has even freeze-dried a lion. 
Freeze-drying gives the animal a far more realistic appearance than traditional taxidermy, he said. 
"Everything remains intact," Saat-

tracts all water from the body wit­hout altering its size orshape, so that decomposition is halted. The animal's remains thus will not shrink and will have no odor. 
The cost varies depending on the size and posture desired, Saatzer said. "A small house cat in a sitting position would run about $450, while a large German shepherd in an attack position would cost around $2,000," he said. 
Bush visits 

U.S. forces in Mideast 
Associated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrain -Vice Presi­de_nt George Bush said yesterday that U.S. warships patrolling the oil­rich Persian Gulf are a signal to potential troublemakers that "they'd better think twice" and blunt Soviet influence in the region. 
Bush visited the USS LaSalle, the command ship for a U.S. naval task force in the gulf, to stress American military power in the region. The white-painted flagship, docked at a Bahrainian port, is known as "the Great White Ghost of the Arabian Coast." 
Standing under a canopy on the sun-drenched flight-deck, Bush told sailors the task force helps blunt Soviet influence in the gulf. 
"The bet that you're here helps friendly countries resist Soviet at­tempts to gain influence, gain dominance in this area," Bush said. 
"The fact that you're here is a war­ning to anyone who might even be thinking of fundamentally disrupt­ing this area that they'd better think twice ... and if that doesn't stop them, then they'd better think again," he said. 
The gulfhas been rocked by a 55­year war between Arab Iraq and Per­sian Iran. Arab countries in the region fear Iranian attacks on Per­sian Gulf oil tankers and the spread of the religious fundamentalism of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Teh­ran's spiritual leader. 
Gulf shipping, including large oil tankers, have been targets for both the Iranian and Iraqi air forces. 
"We have no plan that can lead to the end of the war," said Bush, who noted U.S. relations with both countries have not "been superb over the years." 
"We are concerned and our con­cern stems mainly from the fact that we don't want to see Iran shift the balance of power in the area nor threaten any of the friendly countries -the Gulf Cooperation Council countries," he said. That group includes Saudi Arabia, Bah­rain, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. 
Bush also discussed last month's U.S.-Libya confrontation in the Gulf of Sidra. The Reagan administration said U.S. forces sunk at least two Libyan patrol boats and attacked a missile site after libya fired missiles at U.S. warplanes. 
"Navy ships and Navy and Marine fliers didn't blink twice when they were attacked in the Mediterranean two weeks ago," Bush said. 
"They responded swiftly and there's a great pride all across the United States because of that," he said. 
Bahrain makes its facilities available to the U.S. Navy but is sensitive about attention focused on its military ties with the United States. 
"Go see it (the ship). Don't make too much fuss about it," Sheik Mohammed bin Mubarak al-.Khalifa, Bahrain's foreign minister, told reporters earlier. 
Bush, nearing the end ofa 38-hour visit to this island country off the coast ofSaudi Arabia, conferred with the emir of Bahrain on the Iran-Iraq war, Middle East peace efforts and oil prices. 
zer said. "The color, the size, even the texture of the hair is the same." 
Saatzer, who also owns a company that manufactures freeze-drying equipment, said the idea came to him a couple of years ago when a taxidermist said he wasn't sure he could afford a freeze-drying machine he wanted. 
"Just off the top of my head I sug­gested he advertise doing pets," Saatzer sait'l. "He tried it and it 
worked." 
"Pet owners ship their deceased pets to the company frozen. They also send photographs so the com­pany can get an idea of how the owner wants the pet to look," Saat­zer said. The animal is then thawed and shaped into position. 
Once the animal's body is shaped it is freeze dried -placed in a vacuum chamber at a temperature of 5 degrees below zero. The process ex-

Pigment in black skin may cause positive results in marijuana tests 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Pigments in dark­
skinned people are chemically 
similar to marijuana and may lead to 
wrongful accusations of marijuana 
use based on inaccurate urine tests, 
according to a chemist who testifies 
frequently in court cases concern­
ing drug abuse. 
James Woodford of Atlanta said 
the pigment, melanin, breaks down 
into fragments in the urine that are

In very sensitive urine tests, melanin can produce positive results in people who have not used marijuana, Woodford said in a telephone interview yesterday. 
Melanin is present in everyone, but it is present in higher levels in blacks and Hispanics, for example, than in whites, Woodford said. Dark­

skinned people are therefore more likely than others to be wrongly accused ofmarijuana use, he said. 
Last month Woodford testified in Cleveland in the case of a group of police cadets who tested positive for marijuana use a month before their 
graduation  from  the  police  
academy.  
Ten  of 20  black and  Hispanic  

cadets tested positive for marijuana use and 3 of 23 white cadets were positive, Woodford said. He filed an affidavit suggesting that melanin was responsible for the larger percentage of positives among the blacks and Hispanics. He said the case has not yet been resolved. 
"Those kinds of splits in the test results are seen across the board," said Woodford, who was prompted to suggest the melanin theory after noticing that dark-skinned people seemed more likely to test positive for marijuana use. 

Arthur McBay, a drug-testing ex­pert with the state medical ex­aminer's office in North Carolina, said he knew of no evidence to sup­port Woodford's claim, but he ack­nowledged that the extremely sensitive tests for marijuana use can provide false results. 
He said he had read Woodford's affidavit in the Cleveland case, and it "didn't give me enough information to evaluate whether this could oc­cur orcouldn't occur." 
Woodford said that melanin, in ad­dition to being chemically similar to marijuana's active ingredient, also "acts like a sponge" soaking up chemical compounds similar to THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient in marijuana.

Cordelli follows in footsteps of Holtz on field 
By TRISH SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
Don't always expect to see a smile on the face of receiver coach Pete Cordelli during practice. It isn't necessarily that he doest:t't like what he sees, it is just that he has a job to do and he knows what it will take to get it done. 
"During the two years that I worked with the Cowboys people always asked me why Coach Landry never smiled," recalls the first-year coach. "When you're out there at practice, it's the most important time ofthe day. It's like when you're taking a test-you don't smile during that test. What's there to laugh about when you're trying to get better? 
You have to enjoy it but you also have to concentrate and be real in­tense in your practice." 
Intensity in coaching is something Cordelli has learned from his guide and current boss, Lou Holtz. Cor­delli played for Holtz at North Carolina State and then spent two years as a graduate assistant under Holtz at Arkansas. His most recent duties were at Minnesota these past two seasons as its receiver coach. Cordelli obviously espouses to Holtz' philosophy as coach and motivator and tries to implement the same in his coaching duties. 
"Lou (Holtz) has always had a plan and a theory of how to do things," says the 32-year-old Blakely, Pa., native. "Then he just goes out and

does it. Since the time I played under him until now, the only thing that has changed is that he has become a little more patient. He still has the a coach either, and he has kept this in mind as he helps the Irish team prepare for the 1986 season. With only 20 more practice days left, Cor­delli will be working with the receivers on building their strength and improving their toughness. 

"Spring ball is to come out and work on the fundementals," adds Cordelli. "This is the time we get this team ready for the fall. We want to know what we should be doing in every situation. Overall as a group, the receivers have come a long way. But we have to increase out inten­sity and increase our concentration. 
"Individually we have two great athletes in Milt Jackson, who I am very happy to have back this year, and Tim Brown who has the ability to be a big playmaker. We also have some depth, but I think we can even improve on that." 

Cordelli also strives to instill a team concept into the players. The early morning workouts helped to emphasize this togetherness accord­ing to the coach, and he stresses that team rights should supercede in­dividual rights. The team concept spells success for Cordelli and for him, Notre Dame is a dream come true. 
"My experience thus far has been fantastic," says Cordelli. "The people have been super in this com­munity and the players are com­mitted to winning. It is just a matter of us going out and working them hard to get them ready for that season opener." 
With so much enthusiasm and in­tensity radiating from Cordelli, it seems that Irish eyes will have plenty to smile about when the foot­ball season kicks off against .\-fic­higan. 
SMC tennis team falls to Toledo 
By CHRISTINE FORTIN 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's tennis team dropped its first match of the spr­ing season, falling to the University of Toledo on Saturday, 9-0. The Belles, an NAIA team, are com­peting against only NCAA teams during the spring season. The of­ficial NAIA season is played during the fall. 
The Belles retained most of the same players who played this past fall, with the exception of losing two players and gaining freshman Sandy Hickey. Hickey is playing in the number-four singles position as well as the number-two doubles position with her partner Heather Temofeew. 
"Sandy and Heather's per­sonalities and playing abilities go hand in hand," said Coach Debbie Laverie, noting that this is the op­timum goal for a doubles team. 
Saturday morning's rain forced the doubles matches indoors. The Belles' doubles arrangements are new due to injuries. 
The outdoor courts were dried in time for the singles matches. 
"Heather Temofeew played an excellent match at number-two singles," said Laverie. "I was very happy with her play. 
"Charlene Szajko also played a good match at number-six singles. Her games were very close." 
The NCAA has put into effect a no-advantage rule for deuce play to prevent the matches from being played in the dark. This rule will have an effect on the game and match scores. 

The NCAA teams are tough competition for the Belles. Laverie stated that the spring season is played to provide more experience for fall season play. 
''There has been exceptional pro­gress from the fall season," noted Laverie. "The young team betters itself with every match, which is en­couraging," said Laverie. 
This weekend ~runt Mary's will face two more NCAA teams. Saturday the Belles will travel to Ohio State and Sunday the team will be playing on the road at the University of Cincinnati.

Shumate is named assistant coach 
By JEFF BLUMB 
Sports Writer 
Only hours after Gary Brokaw had left his job as assistant basketball coach at Notre Dame for the head coaching job at Iona College, Irish head coach Digger Phelps already had a replacement. 
John Shumate, formerly a volunteer assistant coach and a player for the Irish, will fill the vacancy created by Brokaw's departure. Shumate has spent the last three years as head coach at Grand Canyon College in Phoenix after leaving Notre Dame at the conclusion of the 1982-83 season. 
"1ohn was happy to be able to come back home," said Phelps. "he is familiar with the situation here. He knows where to pick it up." 
Shumate put together records of 21-9, 18-16, and 19-8 at Grand Ca­nyon, an NAIA school. In addition he had two NAIA all-Americans and his team won a total of nine different tournaments. 
When he arrived at the school, the team grade point average was 
1.3. After Shumate had stressed academics for three years, the average had risen to 2.5. 
A 1974 graduate of Notre Dame, Shumate started at center for the Irish in his junior and senior seasons. As a junior, he averaged 
21.0 points and 12.2 rebounds to

tain Kirk, led his team with six points on 21 attempts from the field. Andy Schiltz, as Scotty, shot 2-of-19, but was quick to point out the true mission of the Enterprise. 
"We're here to observe," said Schiltz. "Basketball is not our forte, it's a secondary thing." 
Kevin Fitzsimmons led the vic­torious Gash team with six baskets. Teammates Peter Kiernan and Tom Schiesser added five apiece, while Rob Houlihan pulled down 22 re­bounds. 
Yesterday witnessed the longest game in Bookstore XV thus far. In a marathon struggle, Managerial Units outlasted Four Jerks and a Squirt, 31-29. Mark Gess was the most important unit, shooting 16­of-33 from the field. John Adams,

For the losing Jerks, Tim Adams shot 10-of-17 and Michael Hertel made eight of his 15 attempts. 
In other first round action, Doug Nierle's 8-of-9 performance led Fun with Small Rodent Stimulation past Duke and the Miserbale Social Pro­blems, 21-11. W.R. Mack shot 10­of-12 from the field as Team Many Martoonies pounded Third Time's a Charm, 21-4.

A first-round draft pick of the Phoenix Suns in 1974, Shumate spent seven years in the NBA, but missed two and one-half years because of illness. Shumate also played for Buffalo, Detroit, Houston, and San Antonio after making the league's all-rookie team in his first professional season. 
A native of Elizabeth, N.J., Shumate returned to Notre Dame following his pro career to become a volunteer assistant for two seasons. 
Shumate's return to Notre Dame will coincide with the arrival of freshmen frontcourt players Keith Robinson, Scott Paddock and Tony Jackson next fall. Phelps believes this could be a blessing for the Irish. 
"We've got a green front line coming in next fall," Phelps said. "John will be able to work with those three the way he did with (Tim) Kempton, (ken) Barlow and (Jim) Dolan when they were freshmen."

Beeuwsaert will leave Notre Dame, plans to transfer to Cal-Berkeley 

ByJEFF BLUMB 
Sports Writer 
Matt Beeuwsaert, reserve small forward on the Irish basketball team, will transfer to the University of California-Berkeley next year to play for the Golden Bears of Coach Lou Campanelli, The Observer has learned. 
Beeuwsaert, a sophomore who averaged 6.1 minutes per game this season for Notre Dame, cited a lack of court time as his primary reason for leaving the University. 
"I decided to transfer mostly be­cause of playing time," Beeuwsaert said yesterday. "I could see myself getting only 10-1 5 minutes a game 

t. next year. I want to play 30-35 minutes, or even the whole game. "I started thinking about transfer­ring during the second semester. I was pretty certain I would transfer after the Arkansas-Little Rock game." Beeuwsaert informed Irish head coach Digger Pheips of his decision to transfer on March 19. After Notre Dame gave him his official release, Beeuwsaert initiated contact with Cal, and made an official visit to the

By NCAA rules, Beeuwsaert must sit out a year before playing for the Bears. But Cal will lose a whopping nine seniors at the conclusion of next season.

Bookstore tourney is invaded by 'Star Trek'

Bookstore Basketball XV celebrated the return of Star Trek to Michiana television yesterday, as two teams of Trekkis, Captain Kirk and Four Guys with Big Phasers and Crew of the Enterprise, battled to defend the federation against enemy attack.

menace, winning by a 21-4 score. Chris Krochak and Jim Folstrom led the team with five baskets apiece. Both captain James T. Callaghan and Mike "Spock" Gregory chipped in four points, and Tim Laboe added three to the cause. 
According to Laboe, the team formed around a Star Trek viewing club in Sorin Hall.

"We watch it every night, whenever possible," he said. "We have a pretty good following, with about 10-15 people a night in the room." 
John Brabazon managed to penetrate the Enterprise's shields, shooting 8-of-12 in a losing effort. 
Unfortunately for Trekkies, Crew of the Enterprise was defeated by Masters Of Gash by a 21-10 score. The Crew relied heavi­ly on the "photon torpedo tactic," which involved long bombs from halfcourt and beyond. More suc­cessful was the "deflector shields up" defense, in which the Crew raised their hands to disrupt the enemy's shots.

There is a time for all things and this is the time for baseball. 
The season has started, much to the delight of all right­thinking Americans, and now people are starting to make their plans to head for the ball park and find the answers to these questions and more. 
Can 
Kansas City repeat in '86? (No.) 

Will 
the Cardinals fly back to till! top? (No.) 


Could it be the year for a Subway Series in New York? (No.) 
You can either put faith in my prognosticative ability (not a shrewd move) or go to the ball park during the next six months to find out the answers yourselves. Should you choose the latter, here's our annual guide to the ballparks so you can take yourself out to the ballgame. 
Lookingfora short trip. 

Comiskey Park, home of the Chicago White Sox. This is one place where they belie\:e baseball is for the entertainment of the entire family. Even if you don't like baseball, you can enjoy yourself at Comiskey with the best variety ofconcessions in baseball, the sport's top organist, and a flashy scoreboard that ignites with each Chicago home run. If you are a baseball fan, you'll ap­preciate the old-time atmosphere and the presence of natural grass. A treat for any visitor to the Windy City, located just off the Dan Ryan Expressway. 
Sox Home Dates -April 9-10 Milwaukee; April 11-13 Boston; April 14-16 Detroit; April 29-30 Baltimore; May 2-4 Cleveland; May 5-7 New York. Tickets range from S9.50 for Golden Boxes to S3 for general admission. Best bet is to lay down the three bucks and sit in the bleachers in left or right field. To order tickets in advance, call 312-5 59­1212. 
Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs. This is mecca. Nothing but green grass, ivy-covered walls and plenty ofsunshine. Take the Dan Ryan to the Edens Expressway and leave at the Wrigley Field exit. It's best to go a little early to grab one of the few parking spots, but that will get you there in time for batting practice when you can sit in the bleachers and grab a souvenir and a few rays. The park for the true baseball af­ficionado. 

Chuck Freeby 
.Irish Hems 
Cubs Home Dates ·April 18-20 Pittsburgh; April 2I-23 St. Louis; April 24-27 Montreal. Tickets range from Club Boxes for S9.50 to the sun-drenched bleachers for S3.50. Now that bleacher seats are sold in advance, it's best to order early. Call 312·281-5050 fortickets. 
For a one-day trip. 
County Stadium, home of the Milwaukee Brewers. . . A fun park to go to because there are no hassles. The stadium has easy access off I-94 and plenty of parking means lots of tailgate parties before and after the game. Brats and beer are plentiful at the concession stands, but in April or May, hot chocolate orcoffee may be a neces­sary beverage substitute. As far as baseball is concerned, the Brewers aren't that great, but maybe you'll see a future Hall ofFamer like Milwaukee announcer Bob Uecker. 
Brewer Home Dates-April 14,16,17 Texas; April 18-20 New York; April 22-23 Chicago; April 29-30, May 1 Oak­land; May 2-4 California. Tickets range from S8.50 for mez­zanine seats to S3 for the remote bleachers. Best bet is to lay down S5.50 for a very good upper grandstand seat be­hind home plate. To order tickets, call 4I4-933-1818. 
Tiger Stadium, home of the Detroit Tigers. . Motown should be rocking this spring. and it's not because ofThe Four Tops or The Temptations. The Tigers are certainly contenders in the AL East, and this old ball park will be a fun place to be during the spring. Some of the food isn't the greatest, but a ball park hot dog is still good anytime. just take I-80 to 1-69 and then to 1-94 to get to the ball park and good luck in getting a parking spot. 
Tiger Home Dates. . April 9-I0 Boston; April 18­20 Cleveland; April 25-27 Chicago; April 29-30 Kansas 
City; May 2-4 Minnesota. Tickets run from S9 for box seats to S3.50 for bleachers, which aren't bad seats at all. Call 313-963-9944 to order. 
Municipal Stadium, home of the Cleveland In­dians. . OK, OK. Enough of the jokes about Cleveland. The big ball park on the banks of the Cuyahoga isn't the prettiest place inside or out, but let's look at the positives. First, they have the best mustard in baseball. Secondly, the Tribe has new uniforms. Third, as of this printing, Cleveland is in first place in the AL East. What more could you ask for? Take 1-80 into Cleveland and fol­low the signs to see a team which hasn't finished as high as third since 1968. 
Tribe Home Dates· April I1-13 Detroit; April IS-17 New York;April21-23 Baltimore; May 5-7 Kansas City. No need to call ahead for tickets, because there's always plenty available. just buy a bleacher seat for S2, because after the third inning you can sit where you please. 
For the weekend traveller. 
Riverfront Stadium, home of the Cincinnad Reds. . There's nothing special about the stadium, except that it may be one of the cleanest in the major leagues. Plenty of concession stands and some exciting baseball as Pete Rose's Reds look to contend in the NL West. It's easy to find, but not easy to get to so plan accord­ingly. 
Reds Weekend Dates -April 18-20 Houston; May 2-4 New York. Tickets range from a reasonable 18 for box seats w S3 for nose bleed "TopSix" seats which are bettersuited for seeing Halley's Comet. Best bet is to lay down six bucks for green reserved seats beyond the outfield wall. Call 51 3­421-7337 for tickets. 
Metrodome, home of the Minnesota Twins. If you're a glutton for punishment, return to the scene ofthe NCAA basketball crime. Take 1-94 to the 5th street exit and then walk into plastic land. This isn't baseball, it's indoors and in the American League. But if that's what you want, have a good time. 
Twins Weekend Dates·-April 11-13 Seattle; April25-27 
California l don't have the ticket information handy, but if 
you're interested call the Metrodome ticket office at 612­
333-5577.
