Tank sale to Arabs proposed by Bush 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Bush administration has opened arms-sale talks with Congress that potentially include ship­ping 35 Abrams tanks, consid­ered the world's best, to Saudi Arabia and 40 sophisticated FA-18 jet fighters to the United Arab Emirates, congressional and other sources said Thursday. 
Other Arab states would be inline for U.S. armaments un­der the proposal, made in the next to the last day of the Reagan administration and now the focus of discussions be­tween the Bush White House and Congress. 
Also proposed: 200 Abrams tanks, seven multiple-launched battlefield rocket systems and 1,500 Tow anti-tank missiles for Kuwait; 40 Maverick air-to­ground missiles with an infra­red guidance system and electronic warfare gear for Bahrain; 24 F-16 jet fighters, 100 Mavericks and 100 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles for Morocco, and seven of the battlefield rocket systems for Saudi Arabia.

Government urged to take control of insolvent S&Ls 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The General Accounting Office Thursday urged the U.S. government, after agreement is reached later this year on an savings and loan bailout and reform package, to promptly take con­trol of the 350 remaining insol­vent, but still open, institutions. 
Meanwhile, President Bush held a private, hour-long meeting to discuss the S&L problem. The meeting was at­tended by Chief of Staff John Sununu, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Budget Direc­tor Richard Darman and rep­resentatives of five bank and S&L groups, said Frederick Webber, president of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, who attended the meeting. 
Bush, at the White House meeting, did not reveal any preference among the many options for addressing the S&L crisis, according to partici­pants. 
Bush "was there to learn from us and he's a good lis-

tanks and 100 Harpoon anti­ship missiles. 
If Bush follows through, the proposed Arab sales would seem sure to touch off a battle with congressional supporters of Israel, which is concerned that sophisticated weapons in Arab hands could be turned against Israel in a Mideast con­flict. 
The list is classified ; a copy was obtained by The Associ­ated Press. 
Charles Redman, the State Department spokesman, declined to identify the weap­ons under consideration for sale. He stressed that the docu­ment did not amount to a "sale plan," but rather to the admin­istration's "best estimate" of other countries' weapons needs. 
"Each item has to be reviewed by this administra­tion," Redman said. 
Congress has the power to block a purchase, but only if a majority of both the Senate and the House reject a formal White House notification of in­tended sale.

~ ND alumnus killed in airplane crash 
Observer Staff Report 
A Notre Dame alumnus was one of the 19 people killed in the recent crash of an Air Force transport plane on Tues­day. 
Captain Joseph Nellis was a crew member of the KC-135 which crashed just south of Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. He died Tuesday of injuries received in the crash.

By a majority vote of the general board, The Obser­ver named Chris Donnelly as editor-in-chieMor 1989-90. 

"The Observer has come a long way since my fresh­man year,'' said Donnelly, a junior philosophy major from South Bend, Indiana. "I have every expectation that The Observer will con­tinue to serve the campus community and keep im­proving."

Pay raise rejected by Senate in 95-5 vote 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Senate on Thursday night voted to reject a proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise, but Speaker Jim Wright said the House would let it take effect next week and then vote to reduce it to "a decent raise" of 30 percent. 
The Senate voted 95-5 to reject the raise for Congress and other top federal officials, and to change the law to elim­

~ inate current procedures which allow a pay increase to take ef­fect without a vote. The vote against the pay in­crease was lopsided but largely symbolic, since both chambers must vote to block it. House procedures make it easier to protect a pay raise in that chamber, and Wright, D­Texas, continued as the main target of opponents as he maneuvered to protect most of the raise. 
Chris Donnelly has held the posts of assis­tant production manager and assistant Viewpoint editor. Donnelly has served as managing editor for the past year. 
Donnelly will assume his duties as editor-in-chief after spring break, succeed­ing senior Chris Murphy. 
Nellis graduated from Notre Dame and received his com­mission through the Air Force ROTC unit in 1983. He was as­signed as an Air Force navigator to K.l. Sawyer Air Force Base in Michigan. 
He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Normal Nellis of Granger, IN.

Notre Dame has no class. 
All right, some people here do. But certainly the percentage is no higher than anywhere else in the world. 
I was rather disappointed with the response to the S-1 column printed here earlier this week. Letters to the editor are fine. Letters to the author are fine. Calls to the author's home con­sisting of obscene remarks that make the Jimmy Johnson calls sound friendly are not fine. 
The author of the S-1 column committed a Mortal Notre Dame Sin: not only having an opinion that is not of the majority, but going so far as to express it. However, unlike all those phone callers, the author had the guts to attach her name to what she wrote. I can respect the letter writers even if I disagree with them. 
But anonymous phone callers are con­temptible. 
Notre Dame is fairly good at harassment. Witness the plight of homosexuals, who endure constant abuse and instant referral to 'man­datory counseling' upon discovery. Witness the Druids, a group of students trying to stir up the campus for An Tostal, only to be pelted with garbage by residents of several dorms. Witness an act of love between two people turn into instant expulsion. 
Harassment goes hand-in-hand with image consciousness here. The administration has their holy grails: no alcohol, no sex, no drugs, token gestures to liberal theology and minorities, nothing even vaguely controversial. What other school claims the whole world as its campus when it comes to random discipli­nary action? 
But often the students here are just as bad. Engineers are geeks, premeds are throats, and everyone else is a blowoff, except for SMC chicks who are after a ring. And God forbid you're one of those people-'those' being minorities or chauvinists or feminists or homosexuals or atheists or non-white-middle­class-Catholic-Republican-male-jocks. 
Image consciousness is a horrible thing. It's probably why there's a huge problem on campus with date rape: guys living up to their image. It's probably why there's a huge prob­lem on campus with eating disorders: girls living up to their image. 
I can just hear the typical Domers reading this column now (those of you who haven't stopped reading and called me an arrogant bas­tard). "If you didn't like the place, why did you

come here?" Well, if Notre Dame bothered to send freshmen a copy of Du Lac and the Honor Code before they asked for the $200 deposit, I probably would have known better. 
Sure, this place is Catholic. So's St. Joe High. But this place calls itself a university. If Notre Dame is ever going to be a true university, there needs to be an open discussion of ideas. Even non-Catholic ones. As long as we cling to the idea that discussion is fine as long as you come up with the "right," i.e. approved, answers, this place will be a football school. 
Humans seem to delight in telling each other what they aren't allowed to do. Universities are supposed to shelter students from that pres­sure, not cement it into place. But the school walls people in here, and the students wall themselves in. Anyone who doesn't look right gets slammed, just like the real world. So please, spare the "Notre Dame family" rheto­ric. It's more like a club. 
Why can't we just let people be? 
One last thing, for all you teeming millions who might plan on telling me off for calling you names: Please save my roommates the hassle of having to put up with me. Write P.O. Box Q.

Bush meets Japanese leader 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-President Bush promised continued good U.S.-Japanese relations on Thursday, telling Prime Mini­ster Noboru Takeshita any dis­putes between the nations are "the differences of friends." 
Takeshita was equally up­beat. Standing alongside Bush in a colorful departure cere­mony on the South Lawn of the White House, Takeshita said their session "marked a new start for U.S.-Japan coopera­tion." 
Both leaders pledged closer economic and political cooperation-Bush vowing to work to drive down the U.S. budget deficit and Takeshita promising that Japan would ac­cept more imports. 
They also reaffirmed a plan to assist the Philippine govern­ment of Corazon Aquino and said they would continue to con­sult closely on policies toward the Soviet Union, the Middle East and Latin America. 
"Continuity will. . . be the mark of relations between the 

United States and Japan. On oc-.._iiiilliiliilllliliflliiilllillliiilliilliiiiiiliflliiilliilliiiiiiiilliiiiiiiiiilliiiiiiii_....__liflliiillliflliiill...._liflliiill_____. 
casion, we may have differ­ences. But these are the differ­ences of friends," Bush said. 
"Simply put,  we  respect  one  
another.  We  need  one  an­ 
other."  

"We're glad you came our way, Sir," Bush said. 
Takeshita, borrowing a phrase from Bush's Jan. 20 in­augural address, told his host: "in your words, the new breeze is blowing, Mr. President." 
No policy initiatives had been expected at Thursday's "work­ing lunch" at the White House­Bush's first meeting with a foreign leader since he took office-and apparently none materialized.

Railway accident knocks out power 
Associated Press 
HELENA, Mont.-Runaway railroad cars derailed and ex­ploded early today, knocking out power to 37,000 people in and around Helena and forcing the evacuation of thousands in wind chills of 70 degrees below zero. 
There were no reports of serious injuries in the 4:48a.m. explosion, which rocked houses up to three miles away, over­turned automobiles and shat­tered windows in a nearby col­lege and homes, officials said.

Firefighters apparently ex­tinguished a blaze near a rail­road tanker containing hydro­gen peroxide, which had threatened to set off a second explosion, police Capt. Bud Carbis said. 
Snow fell as firefighters poured water on the flames. Temperatures of 29 degrees below zero combined with winds to produce wind chills of 70 below, the National Weather Service said. 
About 2,000 people, including 700 to 800 of the 1,100 students at Carroll College, were evacauted from a square-mile area around the blast zone, of­ficials said. Evacuees went to churches, the Helena Civic Center, the National Guard ar­mory and schools, which were already closed by the cold snap. 

journal Science that the cater­pillar nemoria arizonaria lives on oak trees and develops the camouflage it needs for the season in which it is hatched. In effect, the clever critter has a spring costume and a fall cos­tume. 
"Both fall and spring cater­pillars have identical genetic material," said Greene. "The spring brood and the fall brood 
look exactly the same when 

they hatch. Their later change 
depends entirely on what the 
caterpillar eats. Diet cues turn 

on or off the right set of genes 
so that they turn into the right 

shape at the right time of 
year." 

Caterpillars, or larvae, hatched in the spring come out and immediately begin feeding ·on the oak catkin, or flower. 
Soon, these caterpillars develop a segemented look that resembles the flower. 
Mter a few weeks, the cater­pillar turns into a pupa and later into an adult moth. The adult, which is a brillant emerald green, quickly mates, lays eggs and dies. Greene said. 
The new eggs soon hatch and caterpillars identical to the

Greene said that by the time the fall brood appears, the oak tree has lost its blossoms and is developing leaves. The new caterpillars feed on these leaves. 
Oak leaves have a high con­tent of a chemical compound called tannin.

Probe of crash in Texas continues 
Associated Press 

ABILENE, Texas-The inves­tigation into the crash of a mil­itary tanker is being aided by witnesses who have responded to pleas for assistance in the local newspaper and on broad­cast stations, an Air Force of­ficial said Thursday. 
A KC-135A, the workhorse of the military's tanker fleet, crashed on takeoff just south of a Dyess Air Force Base runway Tuesday. All 19 aboard were killed, including 11 active mil­itary men, four retirees and four dependents. 
The plane, which was as­signed to K.I. Sawyer AFB, Mich., was bound for Hawaii and Guam and planned to refuel four F-16s that were flying to South Korea. 
An accident investigating team, led by Col. Dennis Carpenter of Seymour Johnson AFB, N.C., is comprised of per­sonnel from bases other than the one to which the plane was assigned. 
Working from grids and charts of the crash that were prepared by Dyess personnel, the team combed the wreckage Thursday and listened to state­ments from witnesses, said Sgt. Steve Bailey, a Dyess spokesman. 
The arctic cold front that has brought frigid temperatures to much of the country during the past week dipped into West Texas, but was not hampering the six-member investigation team, he said.

"clear majority" of the House privately sllpported his plan for dodging a pre-deadline vote and then voting a partial rol­lback of the raise along with a ban on honoraria. 
However, the restrictive par­liamentary procedure planned by the speaker requires a tough two-thirds vote before the bill could be sent to the Senate. The 51 percent raise would remain in effect unless both chambers agreed to cut it back, and House opponents vowed to roll 
it back to zero whether Wright wins or loses. 
"It would be very difficult for the speaker to find two-thirds for this resolution," said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa.

Tower vote postponed 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON-The chair­man of the Senate Armed Ser­vices Committee said today the panel has postponed an ex­pected vote on the nomination of Defense Secretary-designate John Tower, and another senator said additional meetings with the FBI were planned. 
Tower, a onetime chairman of the committee, had ap­peared headed for confirma­tion after telling his former col­leagues on Wednesday that he had no alcohol problem and would not be swayed by past business ties with defense con­tractors. 
But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., while chairing a hearing on the Savannah River nuclear reac­tor, announced that the com­mittee will not vote today on Tower's nomination. He did not indicate when the panel might be polled.

Basketball coach with AIDS temporarily reinstated 
Associated Press 
ANDERSONVILLE, Ind.-A volunteer basketball coach dis­missed because he has AIDS was temporarily reinstated Thursday while school officials review his case. 
Allen Ward, 37, was dis­missed last week after only one game as coach of his daughter's intramural team at Laurel Elementary School. 
In firing Ward, administra­tors cited a new AIDS policy that requires school employees suspected of carrying the AIDS virus to be tested and their cases reviewed by a committee of health and school officials. 
Don Jobe, superintendent of Franklin County Community Schools, said during a news conference Thursday that Ward would be allowed to con­tinue coaching pending a deci­sion by the school board on 

whether  his  condition  
constitutes  a public  health  
threat.  

"In keeping with the board policy, (I am) of the opinion that the medical condition of the afflicted volunteer is not such as to consitutite an imme­diate health threat," Jobe said. 
He said he made the decision to reinstate Ward after speak­ing to Ward's physician, the Franklin County health officer and officials at the State Board of Health. 
He said the school board was awaiting written confirmation of Ward's condition from his physician in Indianapolis. A

hey will be dancing in the aisles tomor­row night at the In­ternational Fes­tival. The annual festival, sponsored mainly by the International Student Or­ganization, will be held in Washington Hall at 7:30p.m.. It is directed largely by Ramzi Bualuan, who has chaired the event for four years, and Samira Gonzaine, stage manager. 
The performers include stu­dents, both undergraduate and graduate, professors, and even one rector. They will perform some dances of their respective native countries, and musical selections. Ap­proximately 25 countries will be represented, including Ireland, Indonesia, China, Korea and Spain. Some well­known dances that will be performed are the "Jarabe Tapatio" (the Mexican Hat Dance), the Latin-American Meringue, and Cha-Cha. 
Some of the dances are fun,

such as one from Ireland; others combine grace and skill--particularly one very courageous dance from the Philippines. Others still, like the Korean Floral Fan Dance or "Boo Chae Choom" are just beautiful. 

The 85 performers have put in 30 hours of formal rehear­sal time and endless hours prior to that. Each act is be­tween three and four minutes long, and the number of people in each act ranges from one to as many as 14. 
This year something new will be added--a Folkloric Fashion Show where cos­tumes from different countries are displayed. There will also be a medley of ballroom dances. 

The performance is free and tickets are available in the ISO office on the second floor of LaFortune. If not sold out, the doors will be open to all at 7:25p.m. for those who decide at the last minute to enjoy the show. The festival promises to be a very colorful one, in both costumes and music.

NO's 'Diaper Dandy' living 
Freshman Ellis handles the pressure 
By THERESA KELLY Assistant Sports Editor 
He was Notre Dame's star on the court even before he was a student at the University. 
He's been called the man who will put Notre Dame back into college basketball's elite. He was a first-team Parade High School All­American in high school. 

He was com-LaPhonso Ellis pared to Patrick Ewing by his future coach, Dig­ger Phelps, before he even began his senior season in high school. Somehow, this 6-9 freshman was one of Notre Dame's best players ever--even before he set foot on the court. LaPhonso Ellis, like all the 'Diaper Dandies,' has had to deal with high ex­pectations. ''All the hype has definitely affected me," he says. "A lot has been predicted about me... things I could try to live up to, but trying to do that would hurt more than it helps. I can't be every­thing. "It's probably one of the main reasons that I get upset with myself and say I should be doing better. I don't want anyone to expect too much of me, but just enough so it pushes me to do my best. I want to meet the expecta­tions halfway." He's taken the floor against some of the best freshmen in the country and has shown them all that he's not a player to be taken lightly. He outscored and outrebounded Georgetown's sensa­tion, Alonzo Mourning, when the two player's high school teams played at last year's 7-Up Shootout in St. Louis. He helped his high school, East St. Louis (II.) Lincoln, win back-to-back Il­linois state championships. In 1987, as a junior, he hit 27 points and grabbed 10 rebounds against Marcus Liberty (now with Illinois) and Chicago King 
High School to claim the crown, and in 1988 he helped beat Chicago St. Francis deSalles, featuring current Indiana 
player Eric Anderson, with 26 points, 15 boards and nine blocks. 
Clearly, Ellis was bound to be in the spotlight. His decision to play for Notre Dame came in the fall of 1987, as he faced a trio of schools offering basket­ball scholarships. On the desk in front of him were letters of intent for Notre Dame, Illinois and UCLA. He was rumored to be favoring the lllini, but the influence of former Irish assistant coach John Shumate had an impact. 

"A big factor in my choice was that I thought I could come to Notre Dame and contribute right away,'' Ellis says, "and I guess I have." 
He guessed right. As of Wednesday, he led the team in scoring with a 15 point average, having started 13 of Notre Dame's 14 games. He carries a 62-percent field goal average, totals 
10.2 rebounds per contest, and has blocked 22 shots. 
Ellis started the year right, scoring 27 points and pulling down 10 boards against St. Bonaventure in his debut Nov. 28. 
"He's physically gifted right now,'' said St. Bonaventure head coach Ron DeCarli, "but after four years in this program he'll be a pro, and one of us will probably be happy to be his agent." 
Until then, Ellis will team up with one of Notre Dame's best recruiting classes to achieve the one goal he em­phasizes: taking the team to the Final Four. 
"LaPhonso Ellis is obviously the guy who has lifted up everyone on the team. He's gotten everyone to play up to their potential, as well as playing beyond their potential.'' 
--Irish head coach Digger Phelps. 
"We've got our Mr. Dangerous, a three-point shooter, in Keith Adkins,'' he says. "We've got a great point guard, Elmer Bennett, and a great big guy, Keith Tower. Daimon Sweet is a great third guard, and we're all fresh­men. If we can put that together, there will be a lot to look forward to as far as Notre Dame basketball is con­cerned." 
Some of Ellis' burden of premature stardom was alleviated by the talent that Phelps brought to Notre Dame this

After an easy win over a team mis­sing two of its top players, a coach often complains and wishes his team could have faced more of a challenge. 
But Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski had three reasons to like what he saw from his team in Sunday's 92-62 victory over Clemson. The Tigers were competing without six players serving a one-game suspension for violation of academic study hall rules. 
Duke's easy victory signalled the end of its three-game losing streak, the return of injured All-American Danny Ferry and signs of the dominating defense that Coach K has sought from his Blue Devils all season. 
"Considering all the unusual circum­stances, we got much more out of the game than I thought we would," said Krzyzewski, whose team plays Notre Dame at 4 p.m. Sunday at the Joyce ACC. "It helped more than I thought it

Irish Extra: The Game 

This blocked shot by Robert Brickey (21) exemplifies the potency of a Duke defense running at full strength. Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewskl believes last Sunday's win over Clemson might have begun a return of the dominating defense that led Duke to the Final Four last season. 
really hard, really emotionally. He puts everything he can into the ballgame, whether on the court or on the bench." 
Players on the Duke bench Sunday highlighted Blue Devil rallies by slap­ping their hands on the floor, a trademark of last year's Final Four squad. Krzyzewski hopes the return of that practice also symbolizes the return of the swarming Duke defense that got the Devils into the Final Four. 
"We played defense as a team better than we have all season long in the second half," said Krzyzewski, refer­ring to last Sunday's game. "We were swarming the ball, and guys were com­ing over to help out. We hadn't seen that type of defense this season. The kids had thought they were playing good defense, and they were playing good defense. They just weren't playing Duke defense." 
Much of Duke's early defensive prob­lems early resulted from Billy King's graduation. King epitomized the Devils' defensive prowess last season, causing Notre Dame superstar David Rivers and Temple's Mark Macon to play their worst games of the yeB:I'. 
Now it appears that Krzyzewskt has

his defense back where he wants it, and also has a healthy Ferry back in the lineup. The Irish know that presents an imposing combination. 
"They're fundamentally sound, well­coached, have an excellent defense and a great leader in Danny Ferry," said Irish co-captain Jamere Jackson. "They're always a tough team to play against because of those things." 
About Notre Dame 
Duke has split a pair of games with Notre Dame over the last two years, with the Irish winning at the Joyce ACC in 1986 and Duke taking one at home last year. Krzyzewski knows he is facing an entirely different Irish squad this time. 
"I watched them when they played Indiana," said the ninth-year Duke co­ach. "They're improved with their depth, they play very hard and they have good three-point shooting." 
Heading into Thursday night's Mar­quette game, freshman LaPhonso Ellis continued to lead the Irish in both scoring (15.0 points per game) and

rebounding (10.2 boards per game). The 6-9 freshman forward also has blocked 22 shots. 
"They (Notre Dame) always play good defense, and he (Ellis) gives them shot-blocking ability," said Krzyzewski. "He can score, he's a good offensive rebounder and gives them a big target inside. He'll be one of the really good players in the country for four years." 
Other Irish players scoring in double 
figures are guard Joe Fredrick (14.6), 
Jamere Jackson (12.6) and Keith Rob­
inson (12.4). Starting point guard Tim 
Singleton was averaging 6.1 points with 
81 total assists in the team's first 14 
games. 
Robinson also averages 8.9 rebounds 
per game, second among Notre Dame 
players. 
"He (Robinson) is probably the most 
underestimated player on the team, yet 
he's probably the glue to our success 
that keeps everybody sticking to­
gether," said Phelps. "You talk about 
Joe Fredrick, Jamere Jackson, Tim 
Singleton having great games, LaP­
honso Ellis having great games, Keith 
Robinson's the guy most consistent 
with double-figure points and double­
figure rebounds." 
Notre Dame has gotten much more 
balanced scoring in its last few games. 
Eleven different players scored in a 67­
45 win over SMU, four players had more 
than 10 points in last week's 85-63 vic­
tory against Rutgers and five players 
were in double figures in Tuesday's 85­
75 win over Dayton. 
Freshmen Elmer Bennett and Daimon Sweet have provided much of Notre Dame's strength off the bench. Bennett scored 12 points in the Dayton game and also scored in double figures against San Francisco and UCLA. Sweet has averaged 11 points a game over his last three outings, scoring 15 against Rutgers and 14 versus Dayton. 
Before Thursday's game, the Irish had won five of their last six games, including a win over Temple in a na­tionally televised game last Sunday. 
That come-from-behind victory over the Owls at the Joyce ACC has Phelps excited about this team. 
"They showed poise and maturity," said Phelps. "After being down four with some three minutes to play, we go on an 11-4 spurt to win the game against a pretty good Temple team. 
"When we play at home, the enthus­iasm from the students and the band is really just in amazement over how these kids just believe they're going to go out and play against people." 
The Irish realize they will face one of their toughest tests of the year Sun­day when they meet the resurgent Blue Devils. They still are confident of com­ing out on top. 
"It's a stiff challenge," said Jackson. "They (Duke) are one of the top teams. But we feel we can play with anybody in the country, and if we do the things we're supposed to do, we have a shot."

No slowing down: Jackson runs Irish 



By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 
Notre Dame had just been eliminated in the first round of last spring's NCAA basketball tournament, and Irish player Jamere Jackson was heading to the coach's office. 
Looking back, the junior co­captain couldn't have been more pleased about the results of his meeting with Digger Phelps. 
"We talked about the type of people he was bringing to the team and the people coming back, and he asked me what I thought," said Jackson. "I told him I thought that we should play a more uptempo game and use quickness and pressure. 
"He had his mind made up. He just wanted to see what I was thinking," continued the 6­2 small forward. "He promised we would run more often, he kept his promise, and we're having a great deal of suc­cess." 
Jackson had patiently played to a slower tempo during his freshman and sophomore years at Notre Dame, but he always has preferred the run­ning style that worked for his high school team. 
At Peoria, Ill., Jackson's Manual High School team posted respective records of 31­2 and 20-4 during his sophomore and junior seasons. 
Despite his team's success, college recruiters were not ex­actly going to great pains to lure Jackson to their school. 
"I really wasn't highly recruited," said Jackson, who will not turn 20 until Feb. 20. "I didn't go to any summer camps and didn't get any expo­sure." 
Fortunately for Jackson and Notre Dame, the 1985-86 Manual High team fared very well in the Illinois state tourn­ament, placing third and losing in the semifinals to a Chicago King squad led by 1llinois' Marcus Liberty. 
Manual's success in the tournament helped Jackson at­tract the attention of some col­leges, but not exactly the national powers. Jackson fi­nally signed with Notre Dame in late April, choosing the Irish over Northwestern, Wisconsin and Marquette. 
"I considered the opportu­nity to come to Notre Dame a golden one," said Jackson. ''The other places recruiting me were really good academic schools without good basket­ball teams, so I was getting the

"They (the freshmen) have brought a lot of enthusiasm and have added a lot of talent," said Jackson. "They're a fun group to be around and they work really hard. 
"Usually when you have a bunch of guys who were high school All-Americans, they try to coast from what they did in high school. These guys have come out, worked hard and made us a better team." 

The freshman players are quick to point out the ways Jackson has helped them adjust to Notre Dame basetball. 
"I had kind of a tough game against Temple (last Sun­tice after the game to settle down and come back against Dayton. He's very reassuring in situations like that for the younger players." 
"Coming in, the freshmen didn't know what to expect from the coaches," said Daimon Sweet. "Jamere briefed us on what Digger and the coaches would do. !tell you, it sure came in handy." 
Jackson's talents also have had a major role in Notre Dame's success. Third on the team with a 12.6 scoring average, Jackson also has pulled down over four rebounds per game. He has scored in double figures in 12 of the team's first 14 games.

Ice 1n his veins: Fredrick propels NO to OT win 
By VIC LOMBARDI Sports Writer 
Many basketball players thrive for the moment when they can come off the bench during crunch time and pro­vide a spark for their team. 
Joe Fredrick loves that kind of pressure. 
Time Capsule 
As a freshman on the 1986-87 squad, Fredrick came off the bench to propel the Irish to a 70-66 overtime victory over the 15th-ranked Duke Blue Devils. 
The scrappy guard made his entrance two seconds into the overtime when forward Mark Stevenson picked up his fifth foul. 
"I knew the feeling of this game was going to be No. 3 (Fredrick)," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps, whose team had won its seventh straight overtime game at home. "I had a feeling all week that Joe Fredrick was going to be the guy to come off the bench and stick it. I kept talking to him all game, telling him to be ready." 
With ice in his veins, Fredrick drilled an 18-foot shot from the left corner to tie the game at 62 apiece. Then, with one minute left he gave Notre Dame the lead for good as he buried a pair of free throws--his first free throw attempts of the season. 
Fellow freshman Scott Pad­dock also contributed by hitting two key free throws with three seconds remaining that secure the victory. 
The emergence of the rookies took most of the glory away from senior guard Scott Hicks, who poured in a game-high 19 points. Hicks took over the of­fensive responsibilities as the Duke defenders smothered All­America guard David Rivers.

From there, the teams battled through 7 lead changes and 11 ties. The Irish attacked with senior Donald Royal's (16 points and 7 rebounds) strong baseline game and Rivers' (12 points and 5 assists) constant penetration. Duke, meanwhile, Duke countered with guard Tommy Amaker (14 points) and center John Smith (19 points). 
With the game tied at 60, Phelps gave Fredrick the chance to prove himself. 
"I wanted to win this one," said the freshman from Cincin­nati. "I'm glad coach had the confidence in me to put me in." 
Trailing 68-66 with just four seconds remaining, Duke had a chance to tie as Smith went

A
ngelo D. is up against it. Mter 37 years as the Champ, a new heavy-weight has made his presence known. He's made a mockery of the Champ's past glories, and in his rhyming insults intends nothing less than to get the worried Champ into the ring to receive a taste of his kinetic superiority. While the Champ's "stomach clenched" at the very name of his chal­lenger, Kid Gullet, the Champ had a strategy to counter the awesome attack of the Kid: starches and heavy syrups. 
Taken from his collection "Descent of Man," "The Champ" is one of many stories where T. Corahessan Boyle inflicts his maniacal wit and vision on a world we think we know. As the highly­acclaimed author of three novels and much short fiction, it is Notre Dame's good for­tune in having Boyle com-

Richard McBrien, director of the Sophomore Literary Fest 
mence this year's Sophomore Literary Festival Sunday night. A black humorist as good as any writing in the 
U.S. today, Boyle, with his ir­reverence and penchant for the satiristically surreal, takes premises as worn as those of "The Champ" and crafts them into stories bub­bling with absurdity, and of­ten, anxiety. 
"The Champ," for example, features a bout between men where the biceps and pec­torals are of much less conse­quence than the jaws and stomach. Two gormandizing gladiators mesmerize an SRO crowd at the Garden in an eating contest covered by ABC Sports and attended by Julia Child, Colonel Sanders and Mamma Leone. 
In his less obviously comic pieces, Boyle is at his most biting, and also his most un­nerving. In "Bloodfall," a group of friends gathered for a night of civil Bohemian celebration suddenly notice a red rain falling along the pro-

committee to become impor­tant? 
"The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong," writes Ecclesiastes. I don't know which school of hard knocks Ecclesiastes at­tended. The swift, as far as I can see, get the lion'sshare; the strong never come out on the short end of the stick. I'd like to put in a good word for the homely, the dull, the meek, and the over-achievers, and you don't have to make an Urban Plunge to find out

i' 

10:00 is the Alumni­
l Senior Club, where Billy "Stix" Nicks and the N's and Out's will be entertaining those in attendence with a healthy mix of R&B, blues, jazz, soul even some contem­porary music. Bill Nicks, the group's leader has described them as "a multi-talented group with a tatse of music · for everyone." For those unfamiliar with Bill's work, this South Bend Central High School alumnus is no stranger to the music industry. After high school, he and some friends formed a band, the Rhythm Rockers, and appeared regularly on a local teen dance show broad­cast by WNDU-TV. After a stint in the Army in the late 1950's, during which Bill per­formed with the Army Big Band and a small jazz group, he returned to the U.S. and went on the road with Jackie Ivory and the Gents of Soul in 1962. 
In 1966 he began perform­ing with fellow South Bend native Jr. Walker and his "All Stars." They recorded the hit, "How Sweet It Is To Be Loved By You." Together they performed at many fa­mous musical venues, such as portions of Noah's Ark. The comedy arises from the ten­sion of deciding whether it is the end of the world, versus 
ignoring it and putting an­
other souffle in the oven. 
"Descent of Man" shows the growing anxiety of a re­searcher at a primate center as he realizes the woman he loves is slipping away from him. We are caught up in the man's romantic yearnings, despite learning that she is a chimp. 
The Festival itself runs all of next week with a different author reading his work at 8:00p.m. each night in the li­brary auditorium, and a reception follows each reading. Admission is free, and though Boyle's name may be new to you, he is a highly-regarded author whose name may be as familiar as Kurt Vonnegut's in the near future. Sunday night provides a rare opportunity to experi­ence a lively and important personality in literature that won't be soon forgotten. 

the Apollo Theatre in New York, the Uptown in Philadel­phia, Shea Stadium, and Con­stitution Hall in Washington, 
D.C. During his long career Bill Nicks has worked with Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight and the Pips, the Four Tops, the Temptations, the Spin­ners, Sam and Dave, Wilson Pickett, and many other stars in the Atlantic Records stable of talent. 
In 1985, Bill organized the present group, which consists of Robert Outley, guitar and vocals; Dan Chamberlain, guitar; Steve Parker,keyboards; Duane Lighter bass· Ed "E-Z" Wright,' vocal~; and Billy "Stix" Nicks, drums and vo­cals. They have been per­forming quite regularly at Center St. Blues Cafe in Mis­hawaka, and have received favorable reviews in the process. Michiana Student Expressions called Ed Wright "one of the best performers in the Midwest," and urged readers not to miss "this group's good stuff." 
So if you're in the mood for great live music from Duke Ellington's "Take the 'A' Train" to classic sixties R&B, the party atmospllere and professional sound of Billy "Stix" Nicks and the N's and Outs is waiting for you at the Alumni-Senior Club tonight. Don't miss them. 
who they are. 
Students who go on retreats to study justice and peace should start sending out valentines that make a state­ment. For example: "Dear penpal: I heard you whistling 'The Flight of the Bumblebee,' and thought it was terrific. Your sweet notes made me happy all day, so I hope you'll remember to keep your pucker up." If you toss a couple of birdseeds in the envelope for laughs, you could have an over-achiever as your friend for life. Ad­dressing him or her as penpal doesn't commit you to anyth­ing; but "Be my valentine," sounds like an invitation to go steady. 
St. Valentine's is, or should be, a Christian feast, and that's a good excuse for spreading encouragement among the also-rans who need it. In the wrong hands, it could turn into a popularity contest. Then the day doesn't do anything good for anybody. Hallmark gets rich, and the athletes and the su­perficially pretty have their vanity flattered.

To avoid the commer­cialism, you could offer your inamorata your good deed for the day, and save yourself the price of a box of candy. "Dear Valentine: I've noticed you like tacos. I like tacos too, and that's a great start for a new relationship, if you're interested. On February 14, I'd like to come over and vacuum your room, if you're not too busy." 
You're wondering, "How come you, Father Griffin, know so much about the human heart? Do you con­sider yourself one of the dull, the meek or the nerds?" Probably; but worst of all, I grew up as a fat child whom the swift children and the brave pushed around, al­though they didn't have to be brave or swift to pick on me, since I couldn't fight, and I couldn't run. 
The scars from my child­hood still show, when I stand in the light. That's probably why I'm not asked to join committees: the chairman can tell I'm not a winner. During World War II, the question was asked: how should we punish Hitler? A girl answered, "Color him black, and send him to America." My answer was, "Fatten him up, and keep him in grade school." I hated February 14. For everyone else, it was Valentine's Day; for me, it was just another feast of fools. 
One year, Catherine Nugent, a redhead, went out of her way to be nice. She send me a card that practi­cally said she loved me, and she invited me to her party, where I split my pants after eating ice cream and cake. Next day at school, I was too embarrassed to look her in the face, and by the time recess was over, we'd started to drift apart. The next day, she met a boy fatter than me; and after that, I never had a chance. 
She died young, but the good always do. In her memory, I've kept those pants to this day. A nun has promised to cut a small patch out of them when I die, and pin it to my shroud. If Cath­erine could see it, she'd know what it was, and laugh. 
You may wonder how much of this story is true, but does it really matter? Listen to a valentine that makes a state­ment. "I expect to pass through the world but once. Any good, therefore, that I can do, or any kindness that I can show to any fellow crea­ture, let me do it now. Let me not defer it or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again." 
There used to be a soap opera on the radio, "The Guiding Light," and the char­acters in it would repeat this passage like a mantra. This was the message printed in­side Catherine's valentine, and I cherish it like an inter­office memo. It leaves me with questions. Was that girl a painted doll with sawdust for a heart, or wasn't she? Was I a hobby she took up as a ministry to the stout? I've never been sure. What do you think?

Weaver, ND meet No.8 Oklahoma 
By DAVE McMAHON Sports Writer 
Freshmen Chuck Weaver 
and Marcus Gowens will return 
to their old stomping grounds 
Saturday as the Irish wrestling 
squad travels to Norman, 
Okla., to take on the eighth­
ranked Sooners. 
The first-ever matchup 
against Oklahoma should be 
one of Notre Dame's most dif­
ficult matches on the schedule. 
"We'll have to wrestle seven 
minutes in each match if we're 
going to win," said head coach 
Fran McCann. 
Weaver, who compliled a 130­
5-1 record at the heavyweight 
level over four years at Mid­
west City (Okla.) High School, 
is coming off an 11-1 defeat to 
Michigan State's Mark Zenas. 
Gowens, 95-12 at the 126-pound 
mark at Del City (Okla.) High 
School, also lost in the Mic­
higan State dual meet to Brian 
Smith. 
The Irish, with one of the 
toughest dual meet schedules 
in the nation, are looking for­
ward to the challenge of facing 
the powerful Sooners. 
"Just the fact that they are 
on the schedule says a lot for 
how far this program has 
come, and where we wnat it to 
go," said McCann. 
Weaver began his successful 
career at the ripe age of eight. 
The road to his promising fu­
ture began with an interesting 
twist. 
"I walked into a sporting goods store to buy football pads and the owner, who was the co­ach of a YMCA wrestling team, asked me if I wanted to try out for his team," said Weaver. 
"He said I looked liked I would have a shot at making the team, so I tried out and the rest is history." 
Just like most successful ath­letes, an extensive childhood program can be a key to the athlete's future. In Oklahoma, the wrestling mat becomes a familiar place to youngsters. 
"We had a great Little League program," said Weaver. "The high school coaches put the finishing touches on everything we learned throughout grade school." 
The close ties that he made while growing up in one of the premier wrestling states will be out in force to see Chuck in his homecoming. But the pres­sure of his family and friends attending the meet doesn't con­cern Weaver. 
"I'm real excited about having the opportunity to go back home to see everyone," he said. "It'll be nice to have all my friends cheering for me when I need their support. Hopefully I can come away with a win and get some people to recognize the program we're establishing." 
While the decision of which school to attend can be a rigorous task for student ath­letes, Chuck knew immediately after he left his Notre Dame recruiting trip that this was the place for him. 
"I got on the plane and some­thing inside told me Notre Dame was the place for me," he said. "I felt like I belonged here." 

Irish hockey puts win streak on line 
By FRANK PASTOR Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame hockey team looks to extend its season­high three-game winning streak and gain a measure of revenge when it takes on familiar rival Michigan­Dearborn this weekend in a home-and-home series. 
The Irish (9-21-2) host the Wolves Friday at 7:30p.m. at the Joyce ACC. The two teams face off again the following night at 7:30p.m. in Dearborn, Mich. 
Notre Dame owns a 1-2-1 record against Michigan­Dearborn this season in a po­tential six-game series. The Irish won the first game of the series, 4-1 on Nov. 4 and tied the Wolves 3-3 the following night. Michigan-Dearborn swept the last two games but faces a much-improved Notre Dame hockey squad this weekend. 
"I think we're playing a little better hockey right now," said Irish coach Ric Schafer. "We've experienced a little bit of success, which helps us play even a little bit better. We're going in with a very positive attitude. We'd like to even the score up with Dearborn." 
Michigan-Dearborn (15-11-2) is coming off a trip to Alaska in which it defeated and tied Alaska-Anchorage and was swept by Alaska-Fairbanks in a two-game series. The Seawolves of Alaska­Anchorage trounced Notre Dame 8-3 earlier this season. 

"They're playing pretty good hockey right now, too," said Schafer of last year's Ameri­can Collegiate Hockey Associ­ation playoff finalist Michigan­Dearborn. "They had a fairly successful trip to Alaska. They're a good hockey team. We have a lot of respect for them." 
The Wolves are led by left wing Tim Osburn (20 goals, 32 assists, 52 points), center Joe Burton (25-25-50) and wing Larry Pilut (14-16-30). The trio accounted for seven goals and 12 points when the two teams last squared off in a home-and­home series Dec. 2 and 3. 
Notre Dame has won three straight games, five of its last six and six of its last nine con­tests. Last weekend the Irish routed Canisius 4-0 and 5-2 in a pair of home victories. Mter scoring just 2.7 goals per game in its first 22 games, Notre Dame has averaged 4.6 per game in its last ten contests. 
"We scored some goals when the opportunity presented it­self," said Schafer. "We managed to allow them only two goals on the weekend. We have to do more of the same if we're to be successful this weekend." 

A Spectator's Guide to Fencing 
In foil touches are scored with the point of the blade and must land whithin the torso of the body (colored area on drawing). The fencer's valid target area is covered with a metallic threaded vest. When an opponent's blade hits the vest, the depressable tip completes an electrical circuit which sets off a light and a buzzer on a scoring machine. A colored light signifies a valid hit, and a white light signifies an off-target hit. The director must then decide who is to be awarded the touch on the basis of "right of way" rules. 
Sabre fencing allows touches to be scored with cutting motions as well as with the point of the blade. The target area is the entire body above the bend of the hips. There is no electrical scoring in sabre fencing, therefore a jury composed of the director and four side judges is used. If any of the judges see a hit they raise their hand, and the bout is halted. The director then analyzes the actions according to the "right of way" rules and the judges are polled (each judge has one vote and the director has one and a half votes). 
The epee is a descendant of the dueling sword. In epee touches are scored only with the point of the blade, and the entire body is the valid target area. Touches are registered by means of electrical scoring equipment (as in foil). There is no "right of way" in epee, he who hits first scores a touch and if both hit at the same time both score a touch. All bouts in all weapons go until a fencer scores five touches or time is called. In epee if both fencers are tied when time is called, they both lose, however, in foil and sabre the next touch wins.

"This weekend is without a doubt a key matchup for the Irish," said junior Joel Clark. "It will be critical for us to prove that we can rally both at home and on the road." 
The Irish sabremen will be led by seniors Geoff Rossi and Tim Collins. In addition, soph­omore Lesek Nowosielski will

Todd Griffee will be joined by freshman David Calderhead. Both Wayne State and Mic­higan should give the Irish some tough bouts this weekend. 
The Irish resurgence in com­petitiveness and vitality exhib­ited two weeks ago can be at­tributed to several factors. Undisputedly, one factor is the presence of assistant coach Mike Marx. As a U.S. National Champion, Marx's effect on the Irish has been invaluable. 
"I can't even begin to detail the influence that Mike Marx has had on the kids," said DeCicco. "With the kind of en­thusiasm he has brought to the team, he has raised the level of competition a full notch. When the kids scrimmage against him, it's infinitely bet­ter than any bouts on the weekend. The chemistry is right at this moment." 

By this time next week, DeCicco feels that he will be in a better position to evaluate the true potential of the Irish. At that point the Irish will have

a.m. Sunday.

ND Women's tennis hosts Eck Doubles Classic 
By CHRIS COONEY Sports Writer 
There will be plenty of activ­ity at the Eck Tennis Pavillion this weekend. 
"Students at Notre Dame will be able to see some of the best collegiate doubles in the nation," said Michele Gelfman, the head coach of the Notre Dame women's tennis team. 
The activity is the second an­
nual Eck Doubles Classic oc­

Coach Bob Bayliss and assistant coach Mike Owens (background) try to figure out the Big 10 competition against Michigan earlier this season. 
curring Friday through Sunday at Eck. 
Ten of the best teams from each region in the nation will travel to Notre Dame this weekend to participate in the tournament, which begins today at8 a.m. The competition includes Nebraska, Ohio State, Rice, Northwestern, Temple, Fordham, Western Michigan, Marquette and Northern Illi­nois. Gelfman cites Northwes­tern as probably the most talented team entered. None of 
The Observer I Trey Raymond 

the participating schools are ranked nationally. 
Gelfman thinks that the for­mat will take pressure off of the Irish women and allow them to concentrate on playing their best doubles. Separate tournaments will be played at each of the four doubles posi­tions. 
"All the girls are playing and they don't have the pressure of a dual meet," said Gelfman. "They can just go out there and play their best doubles without worrying about a team result." 
Play begins at 8 a.m. each morning and continues throughout the day. A round­robin will be played Friday all day until 7 p.m., and will con­tinue until Saturday afternoon. The round-robin will determine the placement of doubles teams in the final tournament. 
The finals begin Saturday and will continue until 3 p.m. Sunday. Every doubles pair eventually will play three matches each day. 
Gelfman hopes that the tournament will help the Irish regroup after last weekend's disappointing losses to Min­nesota and Marquette. 
"We are going into it with the attitude that if we lose, it's going to be because we gave it our best and were simply beaten by the better team," commented Gelfman. "I don't want to make any projections because the teams are very tough and we're going to have to play the best tennis we are capable of." 


Sizing up the opposition 
Buckeyes next Big 1 0 foe for Notre Dame tennis 
By BOB MITCHELL Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's ten­nis team looks to win its first match against a Big Ten op­ponent this season when it travels to Columbus, Ohio to face Ohio State. 
So far this season, the Irish are 0-2 against Big Ten teams. Michigan and Northwestern have already beaten the Irish this season. Notre Dame will try to snap a seven-year losing streak to the Buckeyes, who finished last season with an impressive 27-10 record. Last year, OSU handed the Irish a decisive 7-2 loss without their No. 1 player. 
"We're not going down there to fill out their schedule," said Irish skipper Bob Bayliss. "We need to return serve well and play good doubles to win. They don't lose many games at home but we do have a fighting chance." 
Ohio State placed seventh in the Big Ten last season and is aiming for the Big Ten cham­
"This year, our goal is to win the Big Ten championship and it is totally within our reach," said Ohio State head coach John Daly, who believes that skill is not the only way to win a match. "One of my sideline goals is to win by intimidation. I want the other guys to have a fear that they can't beat us." 
Indeed, Daly has the right to believe this· method may lead his team to victory over the Irish. The top eight Ohio State players average 6-2, 180 pounds. The typical Irish player averages 6-0, 158 pounds. 
"As a rule, they are big, strong guys," said Bayliss, who recently earned his 300th career win. "They are better indoor and really like to belt the ball. Two guys who scare me are Steve Miguel and Kevin Dibelius." 
Dibelius, a lefthanded junior, played the No. 1 position during the 1987-1988 campaign for Ohio State. The Ohio State Scholar returner of serve. Miguel, who is ranked 48th in the country, possesses the ability to adjust his game quickly to defeat his opponent. 
The Buckeyes' roster in­cludes the Male Junior Player of the Year by Tennis Maga­zine, Ty Tucker. Tucker, a nine time USTA National Junior Title winner, plays in the No. three position for OSU. Accor­ding to Daly, Tucker is every­thing that he is billed to be. 
"Ty is playing very well," said Daly, the llth._most win­ningest active collegiate coach. "His game is right where we want to be." 
For Notre Dame, the OSU matchup will provide another stiff test for the aspiring Irish. Notre Dame, who is behind in the series 12-18, needs this vic­tory to reach the .500 level. However, Ohio State is aware of the improved Irish team and professes they are ready. 
"We are totally cognizant of the fact that they have improved since last year," said Daly of his first dual match competi­tion. "In the past, we didn't have to be ready, but this year we will be." 
Hot-shooting Purdue tops Illinois 76-72 
Associated Press 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.-­
Melvin McCants scored 12 of 
his 16 points in the second half 
and Purdue made 61 percent of 
its shots to upset No. 2 Illinois 
76-72 in Big Ten play Thursday 
night. 
The Boilermakers' torrid 
shooting kept them in conten­
tion in a game that was tight 
all the way, with neither team 
leading by more than five 
points. 
Purdue, 10-11 and 3-5, broke 
a four-game slide. It took the 
biggest lead of the second half 
at 69-65 on Ryan Berning's two 
free throws with 2:31 remain­
ing, then held off the Illini. 
Illinois, 18-2 and 5-2, pulled 
within two points twice after 
Berning's free throws. Stephen 
Scheffler, who had 11, made a 
rebound layup to answer the 
first challenge with 1 : 15 left. 
Loren Clyburn's pair of free 
throws put the Boilermakers 
ahead 73-69 with 1 : 15left. After 
Stephen Bardo's 3-pointer with 
32 seconds to go pulled Illinois 
to 73-72, Jones made two free 
throws with 27 seconds left . =

Jackson let game come to him 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
In a game where maturity and free throws were big fac­tors, Jamere Jackson came through with both in last night's 83-68 victory over Marquette. 
The junior co-captain was a perfect 10-for-10 from the line, icing the victory down the stretch and doing virtually everything that could be asked of him. 
"I'm not a player to force the issue," said Jackson. "I let the game come to me." 
And that type of easy-going, pressure-free athelete is the kind that this young, freshman­filled Irish team needs as a leader. 
Jackson led all scorers in the game with 23 and topped all rebounders with 12. Both of these numbers were also per­sonal highs for Jackson. 
"Jamere tonight, with 12 rebounds and 23 points, and 10­for-10 from the line, you can't ask for more than that," said Head Coach Digger Phelps. 
The game saw Marquette take a first half lead, but Jack­son's roll-up shots and sure free throws helped keep Notre Dame in the game, and the Irish trailed by only two at the half, 37-35. 
Jackson's persistence in the first half was important in maintaining the team's com-

posure. But after the game, Jackson downplayed his individual role and credited the team. 
"We just knew we had to keep the pressure on," said the 6-2 guard. "We just wanted to keep the press going, and that's what made the difference." 
Free throws were another factor that made a difference, and Jackson's 10 were a key to the success of the Irish. 
As a team, the Irish made 24 free throws (in 29 attempts, the best of the season for the Irish) to Marquette's seven, a 17­point differential that exceeded the 15-point margin of victory. 
"We've  been really  con­ 
centrating  on  making  free  
throws," said  Jackson,  who  

raised his free-throw percentage to 88.4 percent on the year. "We've talked about it a lot lately, and it's all men­tal. If we would have made more at Syracuse, it could have made for a different game down the stretch." 
Jackson's shots and free throws were timely as well as accurate. In the last five minutes of the first half, with Notre Dame trailing 25-17, Jackson's four free throws and two field goals were instrumen­tal in cutting the Warrior lead to two. 
In the second half, Jackson converted all his one-and-one opportunities and extended the

Irish lead, and with 28 seconds left he performed a one-handed slam-dunk on a breakaway that kept the JACC crowd roaring. 
"We just played the kind of game we want to play," said Jackson. "We kept running at them, opening the way for a lot of easy baskets and that's my type of game." Jackson's 12 rebounds, eight

LaPhonso Ellis and Keith Rob­inson combined for 10. Eight of Jackson's rebounds came in the second half. 
"We were in a situation where we didn't play well at all in the first half," said Jackson. "We just persisted in the second half and wore them down and buried them in the last two or three minutes, and that's what good teams do." 
Next Jackson and the Irish must turn every bit of attention they have to incoming Duke, which is scheduled to play the Irish on Sunday. Considering Notre Dame has had three games in the last five days, the whole team has to guard against fatigue. 
"I'm in really good shape now," said Jackson. "We've played three games this week, and now we'll try and rest all we can before Duke comes on Sunday. It'll be interesting to see how far this team can go."

From training room to captain 
Kuhns rebounds from injury to captain Irish basketball 

By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
Lisa Kuhns has learned to ad­just to new roles. 
She came to Notre Dame with raw talent and a polished jump shot, content to play the part of a rookie adapt­ing to the college game, but eager to take on more respon­sibility. 
Within a year Kuhns proved she was ready for a new role. 
But prior to her sophomore season, a freak accident sidelined Kuhns for the entire year, leaving her with the task of rehabilitating from reconstructive surgery on her knee and the prospect of proving herself a second time. 
This did not discourage Kuhns though, as she left no doubts in the coaches' minds-­or her own--about her ability. After a year of transition, the 5'10 native of Fort Walton Beach1 Fla., has made the transition from training room to team captain. 
"For three years (former Irish captains) Mary (Gavin) and Sandy (Botham) were my role models, the people that led the team," said Kuhns. "But now I'm the one who has to be the leader, and after watching them do it, I have to step up and prove I can be a leader. I think that's made my a better player." 
She leads the team with a .857 free throw percentage and is the team's only consistent threat from three-point range, tallying a trey in 23 consecutive games coming into this season. 
Kuhns has made an impact this season not only with her trademark shooting, but also with her overall play and her enthusiasm for the game. 
"Lisa's got a great attitude and people look up to her,'' said Head Coach Muffett McGraw. "It's not just what she does, but how she does it. She just works hard everyday in practice and speaks her mind when she has to." "She wants to succeed and people tend to rally behind her because they respect her so much." 
-Kuhns considers herself a 
student of the game and prides 
herself is perfecting the basics. 
"In order to be a leader, you have to do things right so that others can follow you," said Kuhns. "I try to listen more carefully because not only do I have to know what I'm doing, but I have to know what everybody else is doing too, so I can make sure that they're in ' the right spots. 
"I try to work on the fun­damentals and take coach's ad­vice. That makes me more re­sponsible and then I know what coach wants out of me and the 

Kuhns has made a career out of doing what is best for the team's game plan. 
Whether it is shooting the game-winning shot against Dayton last year, or using her defensive skills to keep her op­ponents from making an im­pact offensively, Kuhns plays 
unselfishly. 
"My goals are focused around a team goal, the NCAAs," said Kuhns. "I have to shoot 50 percent, I have to be a good rebounder, and I have to be a good defender. 
"But if I do my individual things right and try to be a good leader, that's going to be my contribution to the team and hopefully that will help us get a bid to the tournament." 
Kuhns and the rest of the 
team will be trying to move 
closer to that goal tomorrow, 
as they head east to take on 
Syracuse. 
The Irish won last year over the Orangemen in their first­ever meeting, 81-64, and will try bring home a crucial win. 
"We're concerned about con­
trolling their forwards," said 
McGraw. "Their forwards are 
quicker than their guards, so it 
puts us in an interesting situa­
tion packing it inside against 
them." 
"It's always great to beat a 
Big East team and win outside 

rest of us." . your region

--18 Swim teams look for revenge 
Irish close out home schedule against Ball State 
Associated Press 
SYRACUSE, N.Y.--Dorsey Levens, a standout football tail­back at Nottingham High School, announced Thursday that he has picked Notre Dame to attend this fall over his second choice, Syracuse Uni­versity. 
"What it really boiled down to was do I want to leave Syracuse and go away, or do I want to stay here?" Levens said at a news conference in his school's auditorium. "I've made my decision. I'm going to attend the University of Notre Dame." 
Levens said that Notre Dame's 1988 national champi­onship did not influence his decision, but that last Thursday's recruiting visit by Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz did. 
"It played a big part," Levens said. "He impressed me with the way he stressed academics." 
National letter-of-intent sig­ning day for football recruits is next Wednesday, when Levens is expected to make his choice official. 
Levens, at 6-foot-2, 205 pounds, was a first-team Parade All-America. He rushed for 1,062 yards this past season and averaged 8.1 yards a carry. 
Of the top 100 high school football players listed by Tom Lemming, a recruiting expert from Chicago, Notre Dame has received verbal commitments from nine players and is still in the running for three more. 
The nine who have said they 
would sign with Notre Dame 
are as follows: 
QB Jake Kelchner, 6-3, 200, Berwick, Pa. 
QB Rick Mirer, 6-3, 205, Goshen, Ind. 
RB Dorsey Levens, 6-2, 202, Syracuse, N.Y. 
WR William Pollard, 6-5, 210, Ft. Knox, Ky. 
TE lrv Smith, 6-4, 225, Camden, N.J. 
OL Chet Lacheta, 6-3, 262, Chicago Heights, 
Ill. 
DL Junior Bryant, 6-5, 270, Omaha, Neb. 
DL Stuart Tyner, 6-4, 258, Tomball, Tex. 
LB Randy Scianna, 6-2, 230, Homewood, Ill. 
Linebacker Darren Krein of Aurora-Smoky Hill, Co., also lists Arizona State as a possible choice, and linebacker Brian Ratigan also lists Nebraska and Iowa State. Defensive back John Davis of Pahokee, Fla. is looking at Florida State in ad­dition to Notre Dame .

There promises to be great excitement this weekend as the men's and women's swim teams host their final home meet of the season against rival Ball State Saturday. 
The Irish men's team (6-3) will be looking for revenge against the Cardinals at 4 p.m. after last year's narrow loss at Ball State. The defeat was es­pecially painful for Notre Dame. 
"We had just come off a big win against St. Bonaventure, 

" 
Tailback 
chooses 
Notre Dame 

and they sort of stunned us," said junior Bill Jackoboice. "They were ready for us." 
Both teams will field basi­cally the same lineups as last year, and the top times for each team in eight of the individual events make the winners too close to call. The diving and relay events may end up being the deciding factors in the meet. 
Ball State's men's team has at least two outstanding swim­mers in Holland native Winand Willigers and Eric Rauschei. Willigers has the Cardinals' top times in six _events, and Raus­chei is best at the butterfly events. 
"It's like playing USC for the last game of the year," said Irish sophomore Paul Godfrey of the meet. "You don't want to lose to them." 
The Irish women's team will also face a tough challenge at 1 p.m. Saturday. The swim­mers have never beaten Ball State in five meetings, includ­ing a 12-point loss last year. 
"It's a competitive meet each year," said Welsh. "They are a very good team, and they are swimming well right now." 
In last year's meet, the Car­dinals demolished the Irish in key events. The Irish have im­proved in some areas, but it maybe not enough to take away Ball State's advantage. Notre Dame will need to swim a great meet and hope for a break somewhere along the way, which Welsh is confident that the women will get. 
"We know that we'll have to swim fast," said freshman Katie Pamenter. "But we're prepared and we're going to show them that we're ready for this Meet."

Recent Irish enthusiasm is music to the ears 
Under NCAA rules, the band will not be allowed to pZay during the course of the basketball game. 
A chorus of 'boos' greeted those words when they were announced during the second half of Notre Dame's 64-60 victory over Temple last Sunday. But it did not take long for Irish fans to come up with a much more creative response: 
The "Hey" cheer. You know, that cheer only a few people ever stand up for unless the game is on the line. 
Last Sunday, everyone was standing. And sing­ing. 
"Da-DAAA-da...HEY...da-da-da, Da-DAAA­da...HEY...da-da-da, Da-DAAA­da...HEY...da-da-da...We're gonna beat the heck (or other variation) outta you!" 
My confidence in the Notre Dame student body was restored. 
The same students who sit down all too often and have been known to leave the bleachers empty for weeknight games against some pretty decent teams were all on their feet--singing. 
Of course, Irish fans were not showing off a com­pletely new talent. 
They hinted at this singing ability earlier in the year at the Fiesta Bowl, by taunting West Virginia quarterback Major Harris with chants of his name, and ridiculing thousands of Mountaineer faithful by mocking one of their favorite songs, "Country Roads," as soon as the game was in Notre Dame's control. 

"Country roads, take you home, to the place, you belong, West Virginia..." You get the picture. It was a heartstopping rendition. 

Marty Strasen 
Sports Editor 
Later that night, a West Virginia reporter said she thought the behavior of the Notre Dame fans was tasteless and "uncalled for." 
Let's call for it again Sunday, when the Duke Blue Devils visit the Irish in the Joyce ACC for what promises to be an exciting basketball game. 
Duke fans have a lot to be proud of--a heralded basketball history and a strong academic reputa­tion. Notre Dame is no slouch on those counts, either. 
The Duke fans also have received their share of notoriety, much like Irish fans of years gone by. Duke fans are crazy, and have earned the prime seats for Blue Devil home games. Irish fans have 
been called "the sixth man" by NBC announcer AI McGuire and "the best college basketball crowd" by CBS analyst Billy Packer. Packer rates the Duke fans right behind Notre Dame's. 
Let's prove Packer right Sunday. Let's make Duke second to Notre Dame on the scoreboard and in the stands. 
Even if we are a little off key.
