GAETANO M. DE SAPIO Editor-in-Chief 
FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3, 1966 NOTRE DAME, INDIANA 
Ed itorial: 

A mandate tor change 
We would like to congratulate Student Body President-elect David Krashna and his running mate Mark Winings on their over­whelming victory on Wednesday. l11e impres­sive and record-breaking margin of votes is an endorsement of their idea of how to bring student government closer to the students. Their election can only be interpreted as a mandate for the change in the atmosphere here which they envisioned. 
We support the efforts of the two men to bring about the changes that they seek. It won't be easy but with much work their concept of a Student Forum should prove effective in bringing the student body closer together and bringing student government closer to the students. 
Elections are always emotional ·occurences .. Supporters of both sides can often be shown to have gone overboard in working for their standard bearer. As the weeks pass after election day enthusiasm usually wanes but more often than not animosities linger on. 
We hope that this year Notre Dame will awake to the fact that "community" will never be achieved if the political divisions that are raised during the campaign are not forgotten. 
Both major candidates this year stood for the most part persistently on the need to encourage a campaign run on the issues and a post election attitude of co-operation and understanding. We add our voice to that of the candidates. 
If the call for increased student responsibility is to work there is a need for students' actions to mirror their vote. It is the obligation of each student now to take an active interest in the hall-in helping to provide a sense of direction-to increasing communication and relieving tensions. Krashna will be asking students to evaluate their present leadership to assure that there are capable hall leaders. 
The "new atmosphere" must be a change of spirit if nothing else. Krashna and Winings election alone can not bring it. Nothing that student government can do will bring it. Changes can be made in the institution and the structures-but the changes will be meaningless unless each student takes it upon himself to do a little more for his own spirit and for the atmosphere of this community as a whole.

Three essays for Junior Parents 
or 'The Golden Dome may be heaven high, but it's only cardboard thick' 
by Dave Stauffer 
Observer Features Editor 
I.a. 

Hello, junior parents. How are you? How was the trip up? How's that fine young junior of yours? 
Don't answer that last one too hastily. I suppose that you've already checked the hair. Nothing over I", right? Face shining as he greeted you, dress shoes shined, perhaps a tie and maybe even a coat. 
Well, don't believe it. I mean, you aren't really going to let his stellar two-day image convince you that he's like this all the time, are you? After all, you're up here to find out how he looks and behaves when you aren't here, right? 
Take heed: The old "invert the image" method will serve your purpose splendid­ly. It's quite simple and based on the universally ackowledged fact that the more someone wants to hide something from you, the more that someone will reverse or "invert" his image when he is with you. Get it? 
Now you can decipher your son's true N D self with the greatest of accun1cy. The shorter his hair is for you, the longer it is when you're gone. Shiny shoes? He'd be barefoot any other weekend. Coat and tie? Formal attire the remainder of the year is then no more than a T-shirt with ripped arm-pits and Levi's that are worn three months at a time. I could go on; but I'm sure that by now you need no help. 
So if he's casually dressed, be proud and happy; if he's as far gone as a shave and a suit, beat the hell out of him. 
b. 

Now that things are straightened out with the boy, it's time to enjoy Junior Parents-Son Weekend. Notre Dame goes all out for you this week, folks. Our University is all washed, neatly groomed, and dressed to the hilt. You'II never see a shinier Golden Dome. 
II. 

A story of questionable accuracy which depicts for the reader the origins of Junior Parents-Son Weekend. 
It was a gloomy, early spring day at Notre Dame. Somewhere in the Admini­stration Building, probably on the third floor, a member of the University administration who also happened to be a priest was contemplating how students and parents of students felt toward his school. 
He thought longingly about how nice it is when students are freshmen. Their parents bring them out to Notre Dame, and the little freddies just love the place. Their parents love it too. It's a mans school. Everyone is a part of the Notre Dame family and everyone is happy. 
But the administration member was sad because he realized that this situation doesn't last. The parents go back home. The only way they hear about Notre Dame is through letters from their sons. At first it's good. But during sophomore year the students become disillusioned, and they tell their parents. 
By junior year the students are rather disgusted, and they often wonder why they ever came here -and they tell their parents. Soon, even the parents are becoming disillusioned with Notre Dame! 
The administration member recognized the problem: the students, and eventually the parents, lose their vision of the Golden Dome and awaken to reality. Reality must be overcome! But how? the administration member wondered. 
Just then a curious thing happened. Seemingly carried by a breeze which wasn't even present, a copy of the freshman orientation program from the previous fall drifted lightly from the ceiling and fell to rest at the feet of the brooding administrator. 
He looked at the pamphlet for a long time. He looked, thought ... and smiled a smile that grew and grew . . . a re-orientation. Why not? If it worked two years ago, it would work again. The juniors themselves were hopelessly lost, but through them, their parents could be brought back into the fold -with the students themselves doing the work ­and, if handled correctly, with the parents themselves paying for it! 
After all, he thought, what parents can think anything but good of Notre Dame as they stand by Father Sorin, gazing in awe at the Golden Dome?

Statistics indicate that over 42.4% of all children under 4 years of age are suffering from nutritional deprivation, and that 31.4% of the entire population suffered from that same illness. The people only require 2 ounces of high protein food each day (cereal, stockfish, and dry milk) in order to survive. It costs very little to buy the food, but very much to buy enough and to transport it to the people.

MRS. B. -Even so, the boys like football so much. There's so much to be entertained by at Notre Dame. Football and pep rallies and concerts and all the pageantry on football Saturdays. We couldn't have found a better school for Donnie if we had searched forever. 
MR. A.-I'll tell you what I like about 
Notre Dame is that president, that 
Harshen berger fellow. 
MRS. A.-That's Jlesburgh, honey. 
MR. A. -What do you think, Blaine? 
MR. B. -Uh...that's Bill. 
MR. A. -Why, the very night they 
announced that fifteen minute ri'tle on 
Huntley-Brinkley I turned to Aggie here 
and said, "Aggie, I believe that we should 
send a letter of congratulations to that 
Hestenberg. 
MRS. A. -That's Hesburgh, honey. 
MRS. B.-I know just what you mean. Bill and I have such admiration for that man. How he can run a school with the national image of Notre Dame and serve on all those commissions at the same time is beyond me. 
MRS. A. He has given so much to this school. Why, I wouldn't he surprised if this weekend weren't his idea, also. Why, it's so nice for John and I to get back up here and see a campus with lots of trees and grass, and isolation from the cities, and beautiful buildings, and a good football team, ... and good teachers. 
MRS. B. And of course it's always so nice to stand among the trees and grass and look at that lovely Got den Dome. 
A 'Fan's Notes' 
will become movie 
A Fans Notes," the prize-winning first 
novel by Fred Exley, will be brought to 
the motion picture screen by 30-year-old 
producer Martin Davidson and director 
Eric Till for Warner Bros. release. 
Exley's novel, a quasi-autobiographical 
story of a man's struggle to cope with his 
environment and with himself, won the 
William Faulkner Award as the year's best 
first-novel and the Rosenthal A ward of 
the National Institute of Arts and Letters 
when it was published in 1968 by Harper 
& Row. 

The film will be the first to be 
produced by Davidson, until recently an 
agent for the International Famous 
Agency, and the third to be directed by 
Till. 

Davidson, a long-time fan of the New 
York Giants professional football team, 
became interested in Exley's novel when 
he found that it contained references to 
famous alumni of the Giants, such as 
Frank Gifford, Charley Conerley, Kyle 
Rote and the rest. The novel, however, is 
not about football; it concerns a man 
who, in battling to find himself, discovers 
that, as Davidson says, "he is never a 
participant in life, he is only a fan."

The line reads,"Moreover, no ro­oms are to be set aside on the basis of race, religion, or nation­al order." 
The Alumni Hall government felt that it was endangering the existance of the Black Concen­tration. Father Wl1elen said Tu­esday that he had told themtha£ 
~he University was in no position to tell the blacks they could not ive together, but the University would not allow halls to mark rosters on the criterion stated. If 
they  wished  to  live  together,  
they  could  pick  their  rooms  as  
such.  

On March 9, the hall govern­ment issued a statement declar­ing that they and the Afro-A­merican Society would challenge the University's ruling which, they felt, endangered the black concentration. 
When confronted with the statement Father Whelan reaf­firmed the University's position, and said that he felt there 11..\ld been a "misunderstanding" of what he had said at the Alumni meeting. 
"If the blacks have done anything on this campus they've told the whites they have a problem and the whites had better sit down and face their problems. This message was spoken to the campus through the Black wncentrations. "It's a message this campus has to hear. I have said nothing to Alumni Hall that the University will not sanction the Black concen­tration." said Father Whelan. 
When asked if the University's ruling had anything to do with the HEW, Whelan answered,

WASHINGTON (UPI)­
Ending a five month search, President Nixon announced yesterday his choice of Curtis W. Tarr, a 45 year old Pentagon official, former univeristy president and a World War II draftee, to be director of the Selective Service System. 
Presented to newsmen at the 

White House, the proposed 
successor to Gen. Lewis B. 
Hershey had kind words for 
today's young people and for 
the draft-hut carefully avoided 
comment on proposals for an all 
volunteer armed force. 
He commended the "idealism" of a presidential commission's recent proposal that the draft he replaced by an all volunteer force by June 30 next year, but said he preferred to save his "strong feelings" on the issue for testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
The committee torpedoed an earlier Nixon candidate for the job, Charles J. Dibona, partly because of his open advocacy of

Nutting for President !lead­quarters announced last night that they had received a letter from· Father Theodore liesburgh C.S.C., stating that he would remain uninvolved in the current controversy over the proposed Chancellor-President form of university administration. 
The  text  of  Fr.  Hesburgh 's  
March  6  letter  reads:  "Dear  
NFI'II,  

I am reluctant to write an organization rather than a per­son, hut I want to acknowledge the several letters you sent me with the enclosures. 
"My own position is relatively simple. Any change of goverance here at the University w.ould come from the Board of Trust­ees, not from me. I think it inappropriate that I become involved in any discussion of the matter prior to a decision on their part. As far as I am concerned, your group or any­one else is perfectly entitled to make whatever efforts you wish in these matters. 
Devotedly in Notre Dame, Father Hesburgh, C.S.C. An anonymous spokesman for 

Nutting for President Head­quarters stated that further ef­forts in their drive for admin­istrative reform would be divid­ed into two areas: political activity and educational activity. 
For political activities, the group will present a position paper this Tuesday, March I 7, to the University Forum. They will also present the proposal to Father Hesburgh, the Studetn Life Council and any other 

ives" of the organization, the 
responses of various faculty 
members to the campaign, and 

excerpts from the Observer

ethical and religious norms, 
racial and social tensions, and in 
cultural and technological

eventually the editorial direction 
of the quarterly would be the 
responsibility of the Institute's 
graduate students. 
The journal's 96-page first 

edition treats the issue of "Edu­

contributors include Paul Good­
man and Robert Havigh urst. 
Subsequent themes will include 
"Black Education in America," 
"Values in Education," "Drugs

No senate opposition to Tarr surfaced yesterday and it appeared likely he would be confirmed to head the draft system that the controversial Hershey ran for 2l) years before 
Nixon made him a special advisor­on military manpower and 
mobilization. 
Tarr, 6 fool 6 and soft spoken, said he was reluctantly leaving as assistant Air Foce secretary for manpower and reserve affairs hut did so because 
Nixon insisted he was the best 
man to succeed Hershey. 
As for the draft, Tarr said, "I can say I was drafted in I 943 and enjoyed the experience." He said "I realize how important the experience was to me and continues to be." 
Tarr served 18 months in the Army, with combat duty in Europe. He rose to the rank of technician fourth class. 
A native of Stockton, Calif., and an unsuccessful Republican for Congress in that state in 1958, Tarr was president of Lawrence University, a private coeducational school of I ,200 students at Appleton, Wis., from 1963 until he went to the Pentagon last June. 
Also, while earning a doctorate at Stanford University in California, he -served as assistant dean of the school of humanities and sciences.

UAC hopes it will stay 
by Dan O'Donnel Tom Kronk, chairman of the University Arts Council reported yesterday that although there have been no major contribu­tions to the Arts Center, the Finance Committee is in the process of sending out proposals to forty major corporations and foundations. In addition, Kronk told of a Student Information Committee that will shortly visit adminis­
tration officials to inform them 
of the Council's progress. Kronk 
stated that according to all 
available reports, the Fieldhouse 
is structurally sound and capable 
of maintaining the Council's 
program. He also noted with 
enthusiasm the co-operation and 
communication that the Council 
has achieved among students, 
faculty and administration. 
Kronk expressed his belief 
that the state of the arts at 
Notre Dame is looking "progre-

Design program 

Fourteen mdustrial design stu­dents at Notre Dame will enter Alcoa's Student Design Merit Award Program for the first time this year. To encourage the stu­dents to "think aluminum," Alcoa has awarded the design program a $1000 grant. · 
A total of six schools will take­part in the two-year collabora­tive program, three for the first time and three for their second year. In addition to the grant, each receives free aluminum materials, a film library, techni­cal literature and seminars on campus conducted by Alcoa's ssively better," but stressed what he considered the need for more money to convert the Field­house into a permanent Art Center. 

"This," Kronk contended, "Is the only way that we can bring campus artists together and nurture their talents. The com­munity is still in dire need of realizing the integral part that the Arts must play in a civilized academic community." 
Kronk sees "an intense inter­est" in the arts at Notre Dame and cited the fact that attend­ance at the Student Arts Festival totaled over 2,000 to evidence his opmwn. According to Kronk, the student art galler, largest in Notre Dame history, attracted over I ,600 onlookers. Kronk termed the Festival "a tremendous success and a man­date to the community at large, 
students, faculty and adminis­tration to move forward in our efforts to realize a Center that can be a focal point for our activities." The UAC chairman also noted Father Hesburgh 's comment that the artist was the person who would be best able to save our society. 
Kronk was quick to praise what he termed the "educational advantages of the Arts Center." It should be obvious to anyone that our educational system is under grave attacks from respon­sible scholars who question its effectiveness and relevance. The bul~ of these objections are to its rigidity. The rigidity of curriculum and the plausability of the lecture method are focal points of this criticism. The Arts periment in innovative ed. ~.:ion and an attempt to provide educational opportunities for people whose structured pro­gram does not include education to the arts." 
Kronk said, "Thus far we have met no opposition to our pro­gram. We have two months left befpre the university decides the fate of the Fieldhouse. We hope that those who make this decision on June I will be educated to the total concept of the Center and realize the relevance of this concept of individual development to the 
community."

by Mark Day 

The future of the Black Studies Program seems to be very favorable, according to 
Assistant  Professor  Thomas  J.  
Musial,  chairman  of  the  
Collegiate Seminar.  
The  Program . is  now  being  
discussed  by  the  Arts  and  

Letters College Council. Musial says he had been "led to believe that the disposition of the Council is on the whole favorable, and probably will be passed shortly with few, if any, modifications." 
Candidates for the position of Director have been interviewed, and found, according to Musial, to be "Acceptable if not impressive" by the Afro-American Society, the administration, and members of the Acadmeic Department of the 
Black Studies Commission member Thomas Musial. 
.  
Musial, one of two faculty members selected by Fr. Hesburgh to study the concept of Black Studies in 1968, went on to outline the principles to which the Program is committed. He says there are three such principles: to fulfill "certain educational objectives through the normal procedure" (i.e., college area requirements necessary for graduation); to provide a "solid grounding in methods and substantive knowledge of one of the traditional academic disciplines"; to bring about an "understanding of the contemporary Black experience in terms of the cultural and historical origins." ' 
The program will require twenty-four hours of course work in one of the regular academic departments, plus twenty-four hours in Black Studies courses designated by the Director. Musial contends that will be "consistent with the academic nature and policy of the Arts and Letters College," although academic credit will be given for off-campus experience that is "demonstrably relevant to a student's program of studies." 
As of now, there are two Black Studies course5 being taught under the auspices of the Collegiate Seminar and the English Department. Bill Turner, 
a graduate student in sc-ciol?gy, teaches an Afro-A mencan Culture course, and Professor Richard Bizot teaches a course in Afro-American Art, which concentrates on Black hterature and music since World War II. 
An important goal of the Black Studies Program, according to Musial, is .1 special 5-year course that would offer remedial work to students who may need it once they are admitted. In this way, Musial contends, Notre Dame could admit students who have shown great potential but do not have the regular high school requirements. The program as Musial envisions it would not bt! limited to black students. 
Another goal of the Program, Musial said, is the establishment of an An;hives of Black Arts and Sciences. The An;hives would contain work and historical and scholarly publications pertinent to the Black Studies Program.

Letters to the Editor 
The Wrath of Secada 
Editor: 
It is seldom that I have felt the way I do now; and the big reason of the feeling will be clucida ted upon in this letter. 
The Observer has lately been in the guise of something which no newspaper should be -a biased reporter of the news. You castigated Rich Moran of the Scholastic for not following certain norms of news reporting, when the Scholastic never does pretend to he anything more than, if you will, one gigantic essay, with diverse views pre­sen ted. They do not pretend to be objective-that is the job of a newspaper. Yours, alas, has failed in this respect. 
In your editorial today, you say, among other things, that you do not reprint the flyer statements of a candidate. Per­haps you should have informed Glen Corso, your news editor, that such is the procedure in your organization. Just read today's article on Thrasher-­perhaps the only way Glen Corso can write something without misrepresenting it is by quoting extensively, but this is a direct contradiction to your statement. 
As for your news layout-! 
have been in varied publications, from yearbooks to magazine to newspaper, and every printer with whom I have come into contact has shown and told me about the very diverse methods of layouts, and how space considerations hardly if ever demand a certain type 'of layout: That is, YOU decide how your publication will be printed, and you can use great discretion in the layouts. In this case I would suggest that you speak to your printer, and learn a little more about publishinR. 

As for The Observer's "firm" stand behmd Thrasher and Murray-really, anyone who knows how the voting went (5-4) would fain call such support firm. And from what I have heard, the one abstention did so at considerable pressure from another of your staff. WSND and the Scholastic were both overwhelmingly for Krashna-Winings, and it seems to me that they were not quite as "firm" in their statements of support. 
Speaking of which, I really dug your editorial for Ann Marie Tracey. The effect came some­thing like: "Both candidates are almost identical, so let's pick one by how much we dig her personality." Such a cliche-filled editorial I have never read, even 
from Don Hynes last year. 
And your claims that you do not pretend to editorialize within the news column is either a mistaken one, made from ignorance, or it is a barefaced lie.

C 1970, Los Angeles Tlm111 


(News Item: "Two UC Riverside journalism staffers admit participating in UC Santa Barbara riot, stoning police and writing of exploits in university newspaper. While professional journalists winced, their editor said the staff supported them. 'Acted in the best traditions of journalism.. .far more relevant,' he defended.") 
We bring you now a 3-act play starring Hildy Johnson and a 

~telephone. As we look in, the curtain is rising on Hildy shouting into mouthpiece to the sports desk from a phone in the press box at Churchill Downs: 
"Hello, Boss?! Boss, have I got a story for you! The scoop of the century! The world's greatest piece of relevant journalism! Boss, hold onto your paper clips. Boss, THE KENTUCKY DERBY WAS FIXED! Am I positive? Can a bear bite? Boss, we have it exclusive! That beetle that won the race couldn't beat me! He was shot so full of dope he was leaking in the parade to the post. What? Oh, the chemist was fixed. Am I sure of my facts?! Boss, was Hitler psycho?! Are rabbits fertile? Yeah, yeah, I know who the guy was. Who? ME, Boss! Little old syringe-maker ME! Boss, is THAT a story!? Can you get Pulitzer on the phone? Boss, I waffl: a by-line six inches tall! Whaddaya mean, it's against the law? Boss, where you been keeping yourself? Forget Peter Zenger. Boss, you're old-fashioned. You don't report news, you MAKE news! Now, suppose it had just been a normal, honest race? Ask yourself-is THAT a story?! Now gimme rewrite and make the bonus out to 'cash' so the old lady won't get any of it. Whaddaya mean I'll face a jail sentence? Boss, a newspaperman's sources are PRIVILEGED. Isn't that what Benjamin Franklin and Horace Greeley fought for?" 
Act Two takes us to a phone booth hard by the first tee of the 

U.S. Open. Hildy is whispering into it to the sports desk. 
"Boss, are you ready for this?! How would you like a 1,000-1 shot to win the U.S. Open? A kid who never won a tournament in his life and qualified only because a small-pox epidemic hit his section. What?! Boss, he can't break 85 on a pitch-and-putt but is this a human interest story? Whaddaya mean, how do I know he'll win? Boss, get this-come closer, I have to whisper-Boss, I'm his CADDY! Are you beginning to get the picture? I'm gonna caddy barefoot and I been soaking my toe in hot water and alum every night. I put the glue on in the men's room. Boss, this guy is gonna be on every green in ONE. He11 be so far ahead by.Jhe time the TV 
,. cameras and the USGA gets wind of it that he'll be able to win if he goes 20-over on the last two holes! Boss, will that sell papers! Is that relevant journalism? You can bet your ulcer pills. I can see the headline now: "Unknown Tip-Toes to Open Win.' By the proprietor of the toe. Get the banners out, Boss, we got the sports scoop of the century." 
Act Three takes us to ringside at the heavyweight title fight. Hildy is trying to make himself heard long-distance above the roar of the crowd: 
"Boss? Hildy here! Boss, can we make the replate? I got a story that should make me president of the Columbia School of Journalism. The champ got knocked out tonight, right? Wrong, Boss. The champ slipped. That donkey he was fighting couldn't raise a soap bubble. Boss, the champ slipped, I sneaked over and CHLORO-FORMED him! Your own little old boy done it! This is bigger than the time I impersonated the home plate umpire at the All-Star game! It's bigger than the time I was the chief umpire at Wimbledon and I called everything out till the 64th seed won. Boss, maybe you better call Huntley-Brinkley, this is BIG! Listen, Boss, I won't be horne tomorrow. I'm drilling a hole in the Am'erica's Cup defender." 
Our epilogue offers, finally, on stage left, a voice from behind the curtain: 
"Boss, this is Hildy. I am down here in the Gran Chaco where I went as a war correspondent. Boss, did you read of that big victory by the rebels where they blew up the bridge and the troop trains? Well (chuckle) that was your boy, Boss. The government troops cleared the area but they let Yours Truly in with his war correspondent's arm-band. They didn't even search me for the dynamite. Is that a gas! Now, Boss, I don't care who wins, really. I mean, with wars, ya see one ya seen 'em all. But is it a great story?
' 'How I Captured The Gran Chaco With Pencil And Paper," by El Jefe Johnson. It really READS, eh, Boss? Well, it was fun while it lasted. They came for me, Boss. Of course, I pleaded the Geneva Convention and the Articles of War for Non-Combatant Journalists. Oh, I squealed to high heaven. But, Boss, some guys got no respect for journalistic ethics. If you ever come down here, Boss, make 'em give you my head anyway. Don't bother to look for the rest of me. This is a recording." 
lineup he used against Ohio U., but his squad shot "only" 52% during the game and never could get their great fast break going. The bright spot for the Irish was Austin Carr who put in a variety of shots for 52 points. 
The Irish took the early lead in the contest, and spent twenty minutes staving off the beautifully constructed K U offense. Jackie Meehann got two early buckets for N D against Rupp's man-to-man defense which had Terry Mills on Carr. 
The Wildcats made the 6'8W' Issei the focal point of their offense, working him free for many shots at the top of the key. This, however, gave the Irish an advantage underneath, where Collis Jones (guarding Pratt) and Sid Catlett (entering at 14:06) did a fine job. 
At II :52, KU's star soph Tom Parker picked up his fourth foul of the contest and ND took a 25-18 lead. the referees were obviously not going to let the game get out of control, and their whistles had both teams in the bonus situation early. 
Carr had difficulty getting his shots off, but came up with key buckets during the second ten minutes. At 8:27 KU closed the gap to 31-30 and Austin canned a turn-around jumper. With Issei 
doing most of the shooting, the Wildcats rallied to 41-40 at 
3:30 where Mike O'Connell (in at S:27) converted four free iliroM. 
Pratt's basket made it 47-46, but Augie scored again and then layed-in a great pass from O'Connell fer the final points of the half, 53-48. Before time ran 
out, however, Jay Ziznewski and Catlett each picked up their third fouls. 
The Irish out-shot K U in ·a: blistering half, 54.5% to 52.6%, and also came out ahead at the foul line, 70.8% to 57.1%. ND took a 24-22 rebounding edge with seven going to Jones. Carr's 11 for 16 shooting gave him 27 points while Issei hit 8 of 16 (20 pts.), and Pratt 5 for 9 (I 0). 

Rupp switched to a 1-3-1 zone in the second half and the Irish never quite could solve it. Carr gave ND a 68-65 lead 
d

inaugurating a tremen o~s 
offensive display by both schools. KU's frightening offense continued, machine-like, to get Issei, Pratt, and Parker open for 12 footers. 
At 5:41, Pratt drew his fifth foul, hitting Catlett as Carr scored. But Sid missed the free throw, leaving the score at 87-86 Irish. Then Parker and 
Issei scored from 16 feet and ND needed a bucket to hang on. Jones, however, missed a one and one at 3:59 and 22 seconds later Issei converted a full bonus.

This switch of four points virtually scaled the verdict at 92-87 as KU continued to nel off basket after basket in the final minutes. 
KU's balanced attack showed five men in double figures. Pratt had 14 points, Mill 13, Parker 12 and Jim Dinwiddie 11. Jones seconded Carr with 22 markers. Austin hit on 22 of 35 attempts, 63%. 
In the nightcap of the collfge double header, Jacksonville edged Iowa I04-103 as Pembrook Burrows III tipped in a rebound at the buzzer to win it for the Dolphins. Fred Brown had put Iowa ahead with 15 seconds to go but they just couldn't hold on.

Sweet Sixteen set to go 
INDIANAP'OLIS (U'PI)­They'll lock the door and pull down the shades in Ripley County Saturday and head for the "big barn"-Hinkle Field­house at Indianapolis-to cheer another David against Goliath. 
The underdog this time is 

unbeaten  South  Ripley,  from  
the  same  Southeastern Indiana  
hills  that  spawned  the  famous  

Indians of Mila,1, who wer.t all the way 1 6 years ago in the Indiana high school basketball tourney. 
Ripley's Raiders, from a four year old, four school consolida­
tion, take on feared Indianapolis Attucks, a three time state champion, in the opener of the three game lndi:mapolis semi­state. 
Muncie Central, winner of five state titles, clashes with Colum­bus in the second game. 
South Ripley numbers only 418 students but at least 2,000 Versailles area fans have adopted the Raiders as "their boys" and will lend their vocal support to a bunch of guys who notched their school's first sectional and regional crowns with victories at Batesville and Connersville. 
Coach Dale Ricketts may not have a Bobby Plump, Milan's masterful magician of the 1950s, but his chief gunner, Kelvin Comer, cannot be discounted. The six foot Comer is averaging 20 points a game and does a lot of feeding to a front line that 

measures 6-3,6-1,6-3. 
The Raiders have zipped through 25 games without a scratch to take the best record into the "Sweet Sixteen." 
Attucks is 22-5 and seek!; its sixth state finals berth. The last time the Tigers made the "Field­
house  Four,"  in  1959,  they  
routed  Kokomo for  the  title,  
92-54.  

Attucks is keyed aroun j a veteran crew that includes Bob Whitley, Wendell Taylor, Gary Maxey and Steve Easley and has to be good to survive the Indianapolis se.ctional.
