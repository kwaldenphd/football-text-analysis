Senior Club fate discussed 
by Valerie Zurblis Staff Repo"er 
Dean of Students John Macheca, Assistant Vice President of Student Mfairs Father Terry Lally and Dr. Robert Ackerman, Director of Student Affairs said Wednesday the purpose of the Senior Club was to provide a clean place for seniors to gather and socialize. 
"Any member of the senior class should feel free to go there alone or with a guest who is 21," said Macheca in an interview with The Observer. 
"The club should be a sustantial place for the senior class, something that they can take pride in." 
For example, Ackerman said thatstudentsfelt there was no place to sit and talk on campus. Upstairs in the club a section was provided for socializing. 
It was pointed out that the nature of the place had changed from last year due mainly from student complaints. "Students came to us with their complaints and we responded to their <:oncerns," said Lally. 
"People with a higher notion of what a Senior Club should be decided not to open their doors to the march. It's an example of something studentshaVlut time into something and wouldn't let it be used for something other than for what it was intended," said Ackerman. 
On the dismissal of manager William "Butch" Smith, Macheca commented that certain responsibilities were to be performed and if they weren't the internal structure must be recon­sidered. "It was a personnel thing and personnel changes shouldn't go to length in a newspaper," commented Macheca. · 
Macheca said that Student Mfairs did something for the seniorclass that they had in­dicated they wanted done with their help as beginning. In order to reach that goal, policy decisions had to be made. "It's important for seniors to know what we're trying to do," he said. 
Lally said the newly appointed co-managers, Jim Sweedyk and Jim Shanahan, would do a good job. "They understand what kind of club it should be," said' Lally. 
Ackerman interjected, "Ideally, the senior club should be for seniors only. No un­derclassmen should be admitted." He explained that it would be unfair if a freshman girlto goin because she was dating a senior guy. Other freshmen couldn't get in and eventually the club would have to open up to the entire student body. 
Lally said that those using fake ID's were not living up to the ideal. "We're operating the club straight but that's the way we're operating," he commented. 
Ray Capp, a committee member of the bar's renovation, said, "We didn't want another Nickie's or Corby's. We wanted a coffeehouse­type place where you can take adateor see some friends." 
Capp explained thecommitteetried to fix the place up to look nice and convey the idea. They also wanted to keep the crowds dow"l. 
"Mter it had been opened awhile, I visited the club and found it dirty and filthy. The paneling was done, things were kicked in, the curtains weren't uty and the shutters were off," Capp related. 
He was also surprised when Smith was dismissed. "When we were done renovating, we assumed our work had stopped and management would take over the cleaning and keeping up of

Flanner or Grace may be women's dorms next year 
by Paul Young and Terry Keeney 
University Housing Director Fr. John Mulcahy yesterday proposed converting either Falnner or Grace Halls into a women's dorm to a{!commodate an additional200 to 300 women expected on campus next year. Under Mulcahy's plan Farley Hall would become a men's dorm again. 
In a letter to resident hall rectors, Mulcahy said that this proposal was only one of several alternative solutions to the problem of housing a larger women's enrollment. 
Final decision on the matter rests with University Presidnet Fr. Theodore Hesburgh with the advice of the Officers of the University. 
Brother Just Paczesny, vice president for Student Affairs and an office of the University, emphasized that the conversion of Flanner or Grace is only one solution currently being considered. 
"Fr. Mulcahy merely gave possible solution s and he was seeking ideas from hall staffs on this matter," Paczesny said. "In no way have we come to a final decision on this matter." 
Best option 
The conversion of Flanner or Grace into a women's dorm is favored by Mulcahy as the bestamong three options he believes open to the University. 
According to Mulcahy, the other two options are to force women to move off campus by including them in a housing lottery or to find alternate housing on campus for the additional women. 
Mulcahy said that the lottery for women "is a strong possibility, an option that can and will be considered." As for alternate housing, Mulcahy indicated that at least "two buildings are now under investigation as sources of additional space." 
Paczesny noted another option open to the university. He proposed that the university construct modular buildings to serve as dormitories. 
"Another possible option is to build on university land some modular building like Campus View or Crestwood sponsored by the university," Paczesny said. ­
Transfer men to Farley

Hall, about 244 in number, woUld be transferred next 
year to one of the two towers. The returning residents 
from either Flanner or Grace numbering about 500 
would be moved to Farley. The difference in num­
bers in the two halls would be resolved by seniors 
graduating and the non-admittance of freshman into 
Farley for one year, Mulcahy said. 
Mulcahy noted the advantages of choosing one of 
the towers as the sixth women's dormitory. 
"The towers would make excellent women's dorms .as they would require practically zero in renovation fees, excepting perhaps the addition of a laundry room," Mulcahy said. 
He also cited the large number of beds available in 
Flanner or Grace as a factor in planning future 
women admissions. 
Mulcahy noted that the decision to admit 380 fresh­
man women next year is the source of the housing 
problems. According to Mulcahy, of 125 senior 
women graduating this year only 75 are living on 
campus. Thus the university must find about 300 beds 
for the new women students next year. 
Five-year coeducation plan 
According to Sr. John Miriam Jones, assistant to 
the provost, the goal of the five-year University 
coeducation policy is to have a female enrollment of 
1500 by 1976. Cureently 1,138 women are enrolled as 
undergraduates. 
Jones said that although there has never been formal talk for a sixth women's dorm, university !officials have been considering housing possibilities since last spring. 
Jones argued that the conversion of another male dorm to a women's dorm is "the least desired of many solutions which won't solve many problems and might create a few more," she said. 
Of the three options open to the university to house women next: year (forcing women off campus, con­verting ariotehr men's dorm, or searching for alternate hou~ing), Jones favors the last solution. 
Jones believes that final decision on the question will be reached by January. ·She said that the Of­ficers ofthe University will consider many options to solve the problem of residential availability including proposals to.use mobile homes to house students. 
"We're at a position now where we don't really have the money to build a new dorm and wish we 
did," Jones said. 
warld briefs 
WASHINGTON UPI -The House Education and Labor Committee Wednesday unanimously approved an emergency $2 billion public service jobs bill to combat rising unemployment. 
The money, to be pumped into city and state governments to provide needed public service jobs, in areas of severe unemployment, would be authorized for one year. 
The measure also contains provisions to broaden unemployment compensation benefits in hard hit areas of the nation. 
The bill was described by committee staffers as a "stop gap emergency one year effort to pump more money out right away for public service jobs."

House sends budget reduction 
to Senate lor final 
WASHINGTON <UPI) -The House, invoking for the first time anti-impoundment powers Congress gave itself earlier this year, voted Wednesday to require that President Ford spend $540 million of the $657.6 million he sought to cut from his budget. 
The House passed by voice vote and sent to the Senate for final action an Appropriations Committee recommendation that Ford be allowed to reduce his budget by at least $117 million. The figure did not include an estimated $16.2 million the House voted to allow him to cut from appropriations to finance col­lege housing. 
But House leaders said the action means the President will have to spend the other $540 million he had sought to cut from appropriations for the Rural Electrification Adminis­tration and the agricultural conservation program. More than $455.6 million of that amount had been appropriated for REA alone. 

Freshman Council 
elects officers before break 
Members of the Freshman Advisory Council elected a slate of officers at a social gathering held at the Flanner Towers before Thanksgiving Break. The council, consisting of one Freshman from each of the twenty residence halls, selected Jim Russell of Holy Cross Hall as Chairman, and George Lucas of Flanner Hall as Secretary. · 
The two officers are responsible for all Council transactions, meetings, and agenda items. Their term will last until the end of this academic year.

It was the first use of the Impoundment Control Act Con­gress passed earlier in the year to prevent the President from refusing to spend money it has appropriated. 
Both houses must approve ' within 45 days a President's request to withhold or reduce

Wednesday's action did not include $4.6 billion cut Ford requested Nov. 26 in an effort to fight inflation. 
Tuesday, Ford criticized Con­gress for contributing to a "growing sense of frustration in the White House" in its efforts to deal "with the sagging economy."

Besides the college housing funds, the House Wednesday allowed the following cuts:

-$51.6 million for roads and trails development by the Forest Service.

More violence strikes Ethiopia 
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (UPI) -Four explosior.s hit Addis Ababa Monday and small arms fire echoed through the streets of the Ethiopian capital. 
At least 12 people were hurt, police said.

A government spokesman said five persons were hurt, one seriously, when an explosion badly damaged the city hall, and seven others injured by a blast which blew out windows at the Wabi Shebelle Hotel. 
ND food co-op to open short I y 
by Catherine Brown staff reporter 
Afood co-{)p designed to meet the needs of both the on and off­campus students of Notre Dame should be operating in about two weeks. 
Steve Shankel, an off-campus senior who is involved in setting up the CO-{)P for Student Government, described the operation as "still in the planning stage." 
"We have a building, and we have made contacts with the distributors. Everything is on the verge, but not quite ready," ex­plained Shankel. 
Student Government is presently appealing to the Office of Student Affairs for funds for the co-op beyond those allocated in the Student Government budget 
"In the long run, we hope the co­op will be self-supporting and making enough of a profit to pay the overhead and the rent, but initial funding will come from the administration and Student Government," said Shankel. 
The co-{)p's location on South Bend A venue across from Campus View Apartments is only five minutes walking distance from campus, making it accessible to on-campus students as well. "We hope it will be used by on-campus and off-campus students, and we hope to offer more than just food," stressed Shankel. 
Shankel's interest in food co-{)ps 
stems from the successful

"It has been established that these elements were followers of the nobility and top officials of the former regime who were executed for crimes against the Ethiopian people." 
The violence coincided with an official announcement that a group of former government leaders would go on public trial Wednesday, 11 days after 60 said. "Also, since we've moved into our new office in Rm. 400, we felt the open house would be a good way of showing our facilities, staff and programs," the Counseling Center director added.

University  of  California  at  

Berkeley for the state legis­lature, which is often faced with measures relating to California's consumption of alcohol. 
"More Californians drink, and they drink more heavily than is true for the U.S. as a whole," the report said. 
Only 15 per cent of those surveyed said they had not drunk at all in the past year. One-third said they had gotten "tight" at least once, and 16 per cent admitted being under the influence at least once a month. 
Cahalan said the prevailing opinion seemed to be that the government should do some­thing to keep drunks out of automobiles, and undertake a campaign to educate young Californians on how to be "responsible" drinkers, rather than trying to stop them from indulging altogether. 
The public does not place a high priority on doing some­thing for the "bums and derelicts" on skid row, accord­ing to the study.

Mexican 

lifestyle 
Dear Editor: 

The word "Mexico" conjures up various connotations in the North American mind. Most Americans picture a sunny desert filled with cacti and perpetually-dozing senores, with an occasional ban­dito waking up to pillage and plunder the unsuspecting Mexican laborer. 
As I sit here, freezing in my room, I feel compelled to dispel this image of Mexico. The Acapulco image of Mexico is about as representative of its weather as Chicago is representative of weather in the United States. Often, the students in the sophomore program of foreign study in Mexico City, wake up in unheated rooms only to come to the realization that, once again, it is "South Bend" outside. And, once again, we dress for winter in the early morning, only to have summer return by the start of the afternoon. 
One rarely encounters a Mexican enjoying a siesta. Many Mexicans put in a twelve-hour workday from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 
p.m. Various cities and villages outside of Mexico City do close up shop for an hour at mid-day. However, the workers do not go home to rest and escape the heat, but rather to enjoy a five-course meal, which is an essential part of their lifestyle.
However, these are rather minor aspects of Mexican civilization. The more subtle differences of the Mexican way of life prove to be the more interesting aspects of their civilization. 
The Mexican people are a believing and emotional people, constantly striving to revolutionize their lifestyles. They are sub­jected to the ever-present North American influence, whether through cinema, tourism or commercial products, which they find as threatening as overcasts skies. They are impressed with <yet, are afraid to get too close to) the individual success of American capitalism, while they fall back upon the security of socialism. 
The Mexicans believe in their 

lifestyle. They are a fun-loving 
and festive-<>riented people. They 
will create a reason to celebrate, if 
a reason doesn't already exist. It 
is not an unusual occurrence for a 
Mexican to spontaneiously begin 
dancing in the center of the town 
square, without the aid or guidance 
of Fran DeMarko. 
While his North American counterpart competes against 
DOONESBURY 
other Americans to "get ahead," the Mexican is confronted · by a much more forceful opponent, nature itself. On the weekends, college and professional athletes in the United States vie for the title of "winner." On Sunday afternoon in Mexico, however, the torero challenges the forces of nature, exemplified by the bull. Yet, these two vie for the title of "survivor." While North Americans race each , other in rush hour traffic, Mexicans daily challenge the mountains while driving. While the North American, as Octavia Paz aptly puts it, "wanders in an abstract world of machines, fellow citizens and moral precepts, the Valley of Mexico man feels himself suspended between heaven and earth, and he oscillates between contrary powers and forces, and petrified eyes, and devouring 
mouths." 
However, the day-to-day preoccupations are usually the main concern of the foreign abroad student in Mexico City, while Octavia Paz seems to rest in the subcunscious. I find myself wondering if I will again be a victim of cultural shock today. Will the language fail me, as I attempt to communicate to a store clerk who doesn't speak a word of English? Will I be able to squeeze into a Mexican bus, even though, five people are already hanging out the door. Is today the day they block off my street in order to set up the neighborhood markets? Does the school bus stop at the bakery today? Will Montezuma decide to take revenge upon my stomach? I find myself wondering if I have been here all my life or just 4 months. I find myself wondering when, if ever, I'll be able to revert back to my American customs. 
I find myself wondering.

political institutions are founded. 
I am not against intelligence­gathering agencies as such if they come under some form of public accountability. Although the ethics of secrecy in our public and private institutions needs to be discussed much more than it has to date, it appears obvious to me that secrecy in the CIA is designed as much to conceal violations of universally accepted human and political rights as it is to facilitate the objective of gathering data necessary to conduct an ac­ceptable and effective foreign policy. Furthermore, because of the nature and structure of the CIA, it cannot be reformed from the inside. For these and other reasons, I do not believe that this university should make its facilities available to CIA recruiters under its present form, any more than it would to criminals for recruiting or to prostitutes for soliciting.

In your article covering my talk on Northern Ireland <Nov. 19th Observer) you stated that I called for immediate and complete with­drawal of British Troops. This is not what I said!

Do you remember the good old days when Freud simplified the analysis of dreams by distilling everything into one word-sex? If you dreamt of books, it was sexual; if you dr&.mt of food, it was sexual; in fact, almost everything stood for some sexual problem you had encountered. The two big sexual images though, were flying and water. If you dreamt of flying you obviously had some sexual problem that needed dealing with, and if you dreamt of water you showed a definite pre-occupation with sex (unless you went to bed thirsty). In short, dream analysis used to be merely a matter of figuring out which sexual problem the deviant at hand was suffering from and looking for a solution. Nowadays it is not so simple. Psychologists, while definitely very much aware of sex, are turning towards a more individualistic look at dreams and dreamers. With this in mind, and with the help of the latest knowledge science can offer, I have prepared a sampler of selected common dreams and their accepted analyses. Clip out this article and keep it by your bed for handy reference. 
Dream: You walk into a delicatessen, order a giant, pin-striped ruben sandwich and proceed to devour it in a matter of seconds, whereupon you excuse yourself and leave. 
Analysis: It is commonly agreed that dreams such as these have a physiological basis, namely that you went to bed hungry. As for the pin-striped sandwich, check that you have not eaten your mattress ... or your alarm-clock. In either case there will be an absence of ticking. 
Dream: You have a dream of weightless, soaring flight which 
abruptly ends in a painful crash. Amazingly enough, when you 
awake you actually feel a certain amount of pain. 
Analysis: Perhaps you should close your window more often at 
night. You probably have fallen out again. 
Dream: In this dream you are simply running and running, never stopping, just running. Analysis: Another physiological dream -you either have a bad cold or have been eating too much dining-hall food. 
Dream: You dream that you are a ruben sandwich, nervously waiting on the delicatessen shelf. 
Analysis: I don't know how you do it, but you have managed to slip between your mattress and box-spring. 
Dream: You are Jack the Ripper. However, instead of attacking young women, you only attack students, stabbing them in the back with no emotion as you head towards a huge bank vault. 
Analysis: A common undergraduate's dream, limited only to pre-med students. 
Dream: Hundreds of gorgeous naked girls are whipping you with half-cooked spaghetti. Analysis: Gosh, are you ever sick ... and dangerous too. 
Dream: In this dream you are drifting among puffy white clouds, listening to angelic music and thinking only peacefull thoughts. Analysis: Not that I mean to concern you any, but you have probably died in your sleep. 
Dream: You are trapped behmd enemy lines during World War I 
just as a mustard gas attack begins. Your eyes begin to water, you 
choke on the fumes and fall helpless to the ground. 
Analysis: Your roommate has left his sweats on the radiator 
again. · 

Dream: A real nightmare. You are a writer and you have become 
so desperate for material that you decide to write an article on 
dreams, knowing full well that it's been done hundreds of times 
before, but you'll try it for the cheap laughs available. 
Analysis: Show a complete lack of taste and tact. Perhaps you 
have a future designing basketball uniforms for Notre Dame. 
Has it been brought to the attention of University officials that one of the Apostles in The Last Supper, located in the South Dining Hall, has six toes on one foot? Perhaps it is symbolic. Perhaps not.

the young playwright of 'fellows' 
As the fall term zooms to a frenzied finale, students and faculty will have one last chance this semester to view beginning December 6, a student theatrical production when the ND-SMC Theatre Commission presents "Fellows". Termed a "comedy­intrigue in the absurdist manner", the play was written last year by a 1973 graduate of Notre Dame, Chris Ccraso, and features only two charactdrs portrayed by Bill McGlinn and Dan Daily. 
Ceraso who is presently working on a masters in Fine Arts at Florida State University has written other plays and one feature length film script though "Fellows" is. the first to be produced on the stage. Visiting the campus while serving as an aid to Dr. Reginald Bain, the director of the play, Cera"o took time out from rehearsal to comment on his play and on the American theatre in general. "For the most part, in the past the theatre of America has been frowned upon by the Europeans. However, it is beginning now to assert its background­-to develop its own heritage--to grow." 
"Fellows" has a distinguished history 

behind it: Last spring it won the William 
Mitchell Award for Playwrighting, an honor 
bestowed annually by the English depart­
ment for the best original play of the year. 

The play has been entered in the American 
Colllge Theatre Festival. Should it win from

Columbus, Ohio, where it will compete with other regional winners. The play selected from this screening will then be performed at the .Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. The nomination of "Fellows" marks the first time Notre Dame has entered in the original play category. 
Not an unrecognized playwright, Ceraso won the William Mitchell Award for his works three consecutive years while at Notre Dame. Appearing qiuetly earnest, he leans forward in his chair and explains, "I actually started writing my freshman year here, though it wan't until my sophomore year that I really got into it. I took an independent study course then and with suggestions and guidelines from my in­structor, I began to write seriously." Gazing out the window, he adds, "I will continue the playwrighting although the idea of acting is very appealing. I enjoy acting too." 
In growing as a playwright, the ND alumnus believes, "It's a matter of seeing what other playwrights are doing. I try not to miss any plays. " From this, an im­portant awareness of trends and new ideas is fostered. 
"Fellows" will be performed in the Washington Hall Theatre on Dec. 6, 7, 12, 13, and 14. Curtain time for the five per­forll\ances is 8 p.m. and the admission forSet construction for the ND-SMC Theatre production of Fellows.

As a diplomat he tired to help steer his native land between the Scylla of Nazi Germany and the Charybdis of Soviet Russia in the hope that with the help of the victorious Western Powers a democratic Danubian federation would be established. He was working toward this goal only to see his hopes dashed as Hungary was first pulled towards the rocks and then sucked into the whirlpool. 
With this personal heritage it is un­derstandable why Professor Kertesz enjoys directing international studies. When you walk into his 12th floor complex you can almost feel the heartbeat of our times. The walls of the main reading room are lined with reviews, journals and digests from around the world. Next door you can hear the clatter of typewriters as secretaries and graduate students work on the Review of Politics. Kertesz's private office is planned disorder. It mirrors the world in which he

In 1943, while in the Political 1Section of the Foreign Ministry, he was charged with the preparation of the Hungarian case for the Peace Conference in expectation of Nazi Germany's defeat. These explotis, which included secret negotiations with the Allies before Hungary was invaded, are recounted in his book, Diplomacy in a Whirlpool. In October of 1944, following-a Nazi coup, Kertesz was arrested and accused of treason by the puppet government. He was carted around the country from prison to prison, abused, threatened with death, court-martialed but finally acquitted for lack of evidence. Kertesz returned to his family in late December of 1944, just in time for the Russian siege of Budapest. He and his family spent seven weeks with one hundred other people in the basement of an apartment building. Eating the meat of a horse killed by an artillery shell was a rare treat, he remembers. One morning, after the Russians had finally seized the city, they ordered all military-aged males in the apartment building to report to the Russian headquarters at 7 A.M. to receive their identity papers. Sensing something suspicious, Kertesz fled across the Danube instead. All the men who reported were

uncommon glimpses 

During the brief post-war period when Hungary was ruled by a coalition gover­nment Kertesz once again was in charge of the peace preparatory work in the Foreign Ministry. In 1946, he was Secretary-General of the Hungarian Peace Delegation at the Conference of Paris and the following year Hungarian Ambassador to Italy. After Communists seized the government in 1947, he refused to return to Hungary. 
At this point, Kertesz, who was not only internationally known for his writings but also had taught at the University of Budapest, was invited to teach at the Yale Law School where he became visiting Associate Professor for two years. While at Yale, Kertesz received a letter from Fr. Boland, the head of the political science department at Notre Dame. Boland wrote that he was responding to Kertesz's inquiry about the possibility of teaching at Notre Dame. He invited Kertesz to come here during the summer of 1948. Strangely enough, Kertesz had never heard of Fr. Boland and has no idea who sent the mysterious letter that first brought him to Notre Dame twenty-five years ago. He was named director of the Committee on In­ternational Relations in 1954 and has taught courses here on both the graduate and undergraduate levels.

Saudi Arabi confident it can buy munitions 
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (UPI) -Saudi Arabia is confident it can buy arms from the United States "with no strings atta­ched" and has arranged to buy $800 million worth of munitions from France as well, according to the Saudi defense ministry.

St. Marys lasts lor hunger 
by Mary Janca St. Mary's Editor 
In an effort to raise money for the world's starving, several St. Mary's students are planning to fast for a meal. 
According to event co-ordinator Michael Dongarra, the fast is scheduled for next Tuesday, December 10. 
Rather than eat the evening meal that day, he said participants will attend a concelebrated mass at the Church of Loretto. Although celebrants for the mass have not yet been determined, they will include "people on campus who are from hunger-stricken coun­tries," Dongarra stated. 
SAGA, St. Mary's food service, will donate 50 cents for each ~h"~~nt who fasts on Tuesday. 


Turkish forces allow 400 Greek refugees to return to Cyprus 
NICOSIA <UPI) -Turkish occupation forces Wednesday allowed the first of nearly 400 Greek Cypriot refugees to leave a Kyrenia hotel for the first time since their confinement last summer, a U.N. spokes­man said. 
The move came amid height­ened tension on the war-scarred island because of the expected arrival from Athens Friday of Archbishop Makarios, over­thrown as president in the July 15 coup that triggered the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. 
The release of the refugees came as Acting President Glafkos Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot vice president, Rauf Denktash, held a final meeting prior to Makarios' scheduled arrival. 
Fifty persons, most of them elderly or ill, left the Dome Hotel in Kyrenia under U.N. escort and were taken to Greek Cypriot areas in the south, the spokesman said. 
The hotel is at the western 
end of the picturesque harbor 
of the former Greek Cypriot 
town on north central Cyprus.

late July. 
The U.N. spokesman said 382 persons have been confined in the hotel since the war. 
"This was the first group permitted to leave the hotel since the war," the spokesman said. "The whole group proba­bly will be moved out by the weekend." 
He said 50 Turkish Cypriots will be taken Thursday from the Greek Cypriot area near 
Paphos, at the southwestern tip of the island and the site of Makarios' home, to Turkish-held areas in the north. 
Turkish forces have occupied nearly 40 per cent of the island, once a tourist mecca. The tourists, who were the island's No. 1 source of hard currency, have stayed away since the war. 
Clerides and Denktash met for three and a half hours with 
U. N. and International Red cross officials and then met privately for another 20 minu­tes, the spokesman said. They did not set a date for another meeting but the spokesman said one will be held.

Dongarra, who is also a member of SMC's Campus Ministry. 
No agency has yet been selected to receive the funds raised as a result of the fast, he continued. 
Referring to an article in Tuesday's observer which noted that organizers of the tea and rice dinner held at Notre Dame prior to Thanksgiving, may have lost money because several students who agreed to participate failed to do so, Dongarra stated that "there is no chance of losing m·oney. We have nothing invested. Instead we will just receive 50 cents less for each student who decides to come to dinner rather than fast as she had signed up to do." 
Any student wishing to par­ticipate in the fast or help organize it should contact Dongarra at 5389, or Mary Beth Immler at 4391.

Scientists announce plans lor Pioneer 11 
By ROBERT STRAND 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (UPI) -Space agency scien­tists decided Wednesday to angle the Pioneer 11 spacecraft inside the innermost ring of Saturn, less than 6,000 miles from the mysterious planet's surface. 
Saturn's unique three rings, which are 81,000 miles wide, are only one mile thick-but they may be composed of flying rocks the size of the Empire State Building. 
John H. Wolfe, chief project scientist, said the entire region around Saturn may contain flying rocks. At its high speed, Pioneer could be destroyed by a collision with a fleck of dust. 
Pioneer would flash through the plane of the rings in a fraction of a second, too fast at that point to take pictures. The distance from the planet to the innermost ring is 15,500 miles. 
Since Pioneer's encounter 

Monday night with giant Jupiter, computers have been recalculating the spacecraft's position. Project manager Charles Hall said, "Right now, I don't know where we are, precisely." 
The Saturn course decision, subject to change, was reached at a meeting of scientists who considered several options. 
The closest approach was considered the safest. The earth, the sun and Saturn will be nearly in a straight line

m ~eptember, 1979, when Pioneer makes the first visit to Saturn. 
The scientists decided to speed up the spacecraft by a few days so as to increase the angle between the three objects and avoid radio interference by the sun's corona. 
Wolfe said the speedup brings a bonus. It will enable Pioneer to fly by Saturn's moon, Titan­the place in the solar system believed to have the best chance of having advanced life. 
"We are going to stay far enough away to guarantee the planetary quarantine people that we won't crash into Titan and contaminate the place," Wolfe said. 
The course chosen ruled out a possibility that Pioneer would be routed after Saturn to the planet Uranus. To do so, Pioneer must pass through the rings when behind Saturn and out of radio communication, and Wolfe said, ""We hink that's a no-no." 
Instead of going to Uranus,­the spacecraft will be on a course which eventually will take it out of the solar system. Its sister, Pioneer 10, which visited Jupiter last year, now is headed out of the solar system in the opposite direction.

Three auto thehs hit Notre Dame campus 

by Don Reimer staff reporter 
Three car thefts have occurred at N.D. since November seven­teenth, according to Security Director Arthur Pears. All of the cars were stolen from campus parking lots and two of the thefts reportedly took place during daylight hours. 
The first incident, that on November 17th, involved a 1964 Volkswagen taken from D-1 lot. Pears noted that this theft oc­curred at approximately 11:15 A.M. 
The second auto was taken from D-2 lot on November 25th. The stolen car in this instance was a blue 1969 Ford. The third theft transpired on November 26th between the hours of 9: 45 A.M. and 1:45 P.M. and involved a yellow Vega parked in the A-1 faculty lot. 
Pears speculated concerning possible methods employed by the thieves. "I suppose the older Vol~swagen could have been jumped as well as the 1969 Ford," Pears commented. "But in the case of the Vega keys would pro!Jably be needed because of the steering post lock." 
In reference to the preventive measures used by the N.D. security force, Pears stated,"we patrol the lots night and day every 15-20 minutes and we have student patrols at night." 
Continuing, Pears emphasized, "If someone had a set of keys we certainly wouldn't stop them. Unless someone is forcibly en­tering a car we don't have any reason to suspect them." He noted
