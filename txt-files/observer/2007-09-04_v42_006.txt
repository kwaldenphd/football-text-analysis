Kramer prepared to oppose bill 
Landlord plans voter registration, gatherings

South Bend land lor :1 Mark Kramer -who rents to 600 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's student'> -says he is prnpared to fight the proposed party per­mit ordinance he believes will be voted into efl"ect by the Common Council. 
"In the event the ordinance passes, I'm prepared to take legal steps to challenge that," he said. "I have secured an attorney to investigate and go forward with this." 
Kramer said the proposed ordinam~e. which would apply to the tenants of his 80 houses, is unfttirly targeted at students and would not solve the problem of out-of-control student parties. 
"By and large, the students really feel like they're being treated unfairly and targeted," he said. "They feel alienated from South Bend." 
The proposed ordinance would require residents of boarding houses -buildings in which two or more unrelated people live -to file an applica­tion for a permit 10 days before hosting a party at which more than 25 people would have access to alcohol. Failure to reg­ister such a gathering would be punishable by a $500 fine, with a $1,000 fine for any subsequent violation.

Many football-obsessed Notre Dame students might consider their college experience incom­plete without a road trip north to the Big House in Ann Arbor or a flight out west to "shake down the thunder" over the USC's Coli<;eum -and often, the Student Union Board facilitates lotteries for tick­ets to various away football games. 
Though students were able to enter a lottery Monday to win tickets for the Sept. 15 game at Michigan, there will be no student lottery for tickets to Saturday's game against Penn State. 
Student response was high at the ID card swipe for tickets to the Michigan game. A line of students

CLC 
Council focuses on 3 issues 
By GENE NOONE News Writer 
At the opening meeting of the Campus Life Council, members established three task forces to address issues of community relations, student development and the campus environment. 
Discussions of the Community Relations Task Force included references to such off-campus issues as the proposed South Bend party permit ordinance and the Aug. 21 shootings outside the popular Club 23. 
Council members expressed a need for the task force to address student safety on and off campus and promote healthier communi­ty relations between the student body and the City of South Bend. Atop a list of proposals was the formation of a committee to work with city officials for the establishment of better relations between Notre Dame and the surrounding community. 
Meanwhile, the Student Development Task Force will address student gambling, among other issues. Student Body President Liz Brown stressed the need for the CLC to be "proactive" about the issue. Student Body Vice President Maris Braun addressed student cheating as an issue for discus­sion by the task force. Another proposal dealing with Student Development involved freshman orientation. Several members said the current freshman orien­tation program is in need of reform, particularly in the sched­uling of events and conduct of students during the weekend.

Buried in the back, behind the lawn mower and underneath our trampoline tarp, was my mom's rarely-ridden hot pink bicyele. This, I thought to myself, is per­feet. And very, very pink. So I squenzed it into the backseat of my black Chevy Prizm (Peanut, as I call her), and set off for Notre Dame. I didn't realize just how bright this bicydn really was until I parked it next to the "cool kids'" bikes at Clover Hidge. My bike wasn't just pink, it was BHIGIIT pink. IIIGII­LIGIITEH pink. Head-turning pink. I loved it even more. Plus, it was free and the seat was exceptionally comfortable. I enrtainly g1~t a few double takes as I happily bounee down the quad on "thn pink lady," as I call my pret­ty hike. My friends, for the most part, giggl1~ and tnll me it's cute. Othnrs have said they would only ride my bike if thny were intoxieat­ml. The best part of having a bike? It rnakns nw feel like a little kid again. And whnn you're 21 and teetering on the mlge of tlw real world, being young fn1~ls Iwtter than ever. When I was nine and ten years old, I absolutPiy loved going for bike rides. I would hop on my purple and white two-wiHH~Ier, dip my Walkman to my Urnbro shorts. and jam to "Daydream Bnlievnr" by the Monknes. Life was good as I eruised through Kipling Forest with my oldies tunes and giant headphones. I could nvnn ridn no-handPCI. My bikes rides to campus arml't nearly as entertaining, but there's sonwth ing about them that just makes nw smile. Hiding horne from campus, howev­er. is a different exp1\rien1:e.

The program was initially estab­lished so many prospective stu­dents would not need to contact Saint Mary's in advance to receive an information packet with infor­mation and an application. If the Saint Mary's representative set up the visit far enough in advance, she would try to work with the school she was visiting to organize it as much as possible. 
Now, the program is organized with the help of the Admissions Commissioner and a number of Student Ambassadors. 
"It's still like that, but [before) that was only if you did it in advance," she said. "But now we delinitely have a list of the schools that are being contacted and can set it up in advance." 
The program is designed to ensure that not only a specific class, club or group of girls is reached in any one school. 
"We want to make sure that everyone has the chance to do this," Ilodges said. 
Through the 16 Student Ambassadors, including Hodges, they hope to reach as many poten­tial Saint Mary's students as possi­ble. A main organizational point would be it's potential official place during the week of fall break. 
"We're trying to make it an offi­cial program [for] over fall break," Hodges said. "All of our student ambassadors are required to do that when they go home, and we're trying to get other students to do that too." 
That means expanding beyond the Midwest, Hodges said. 
"We're trying to get every­where," she says. "We have girls from 45 states and nine foreign countries, and we want that to keep going so we have girls from everywhere," she said. 
The efforts will target California, among other states. 
Bounce Back has yielded results, Hodges says. Her sister Kim, Saint Mary's student body president, has been involved in Bounce Back at their high school. 
"I just spoke to a girl this morn­ing in my class who did it over her fall break, and 11 girls from her high school are now freshmen at Saint Mary's," she said.

"I think if we were able to logistically support a ticket lot­tery for every away game ... it is feasible for students to go to, we would probably do that," he said. 
When asked if students would be interested in purchasing tick­ets for future games against Penn State, Ethier said: "Oh, absolutely."

without winning lottery tickets. 
Each ticket will cost $60, Biava said. 
'This is Michigan's price," he said. "We sell completely at face value." 
Colin Ethier, an off-campus senior, expressed confusion about the lack of a lottery for Penn State tickets. 
"I can't imagine why we don't have a lottery for this game because Penn State gives ... tick­ets to the visitors," Ethier said. "The only thing I can think would be maybe because of a huge demand from alumni." 
According to Biava, SUB was assigned to administer a few stu­dent lotteries before the current administration took office. 
"I think the general idea is if it's an away game that most stu­dents will be able to go to, those are the ones SUB will pick up," Biava sad.

An alternate proposal from the mayor's office would require resi­dents who meet those ei-iteria to simply notify police of such a party 24 hours in advance. 
But, according to Kramer, the city's current disorderly house ordinance provides adequate leg­islation to control disruptive par­ties. 
"I think [the proposed ordi­nance is] a feel-good ordinance for the community," he said. "My personal opinion is the ordinance they have in place is adequate enough and heavy-handed enough." 
Last week, Capt. Phil Trent, a spokesman for the South Bend Police Department, said the enforcement of the ordinance might not be an effective way to regulate large gatherings. 
Patrols which operate by responding to calls will have little time to search the streets for 25­person parties, he said. 
Kramer has called for off-cam­pus students to register to vote in the Nov. 8 election. He says he plans .to hold voter registration drives, which could bring about a more responsive tone toward the positive contributions made by students, he said. 
Kramer was critical of Common Council members in favor of the ordinance. 
"I think those folks are slapping students in the face," he said. 
Just two years ago, Kramer crit­icized another action of the Common Council. 
He advocated against revisions to the city's disorderly house ordi­nance made in July 2005. The amendment dropped the number

of noise violations required to send a notice to abate from three to one. Under the amendment, landlords also received a notice to abate, but were spared from fines if they evicted the offending ten­ants within 30 days. 
That change -designed to send a strong message to people hosting rowdy parties, Council members said -pushed Turtle Creek to evict six students. Kramer, on the other hand, insist­ed he wouldn't evict anyone for noise violations and warned against alienating off-campus stu­dents from the community. 
"Where should the priority real­ly be?" Kramer told The Observer in October 2005. "I don't think we should be worrying about a little alcohol at a party after a football game." 
In the meantime, Kramer said, he will try to ease town-gown relations within his neighbor­hoods by hosting block parties. 
He plans to host such an event on Sept. 9 for residents of the 900­1000 block of Notre Dame Avenue, he said. 
"[Students and neighbors] can get together in a relaxed setting without alcohol and get to know each other and hopefully gain a respect for each other and each other's concerns," he said. 
If the event succeeds, he said, he will bring it to the other neigh­borhoods in which he rents. 
"It can't hurt," he said. "If it's successful ... we can ease tensions and take a proactive and positive approach rather than the negative approach the council is taking." 
Still, Kramer admitted student actions have played a part in the genesis of the party permit con­troversy. 
"If students were a little better behaved and a little more consid­erate to [their] neighbors, we wouldn't have this happening here," he said. 
If the ordinance passes, many students will still choose to move off campus, Kramer said. 
"Even with the ordinance, you still have more freedom living off campus," he said.

Saudi Binladin Group denies 9/11 involve111ent

Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -The Saudi Binladin Group is not liable for the Sept. 11 attacks, attorneys for the multinational engineering firm claim. beeause it made Osama bin Laden surrender his stake in the company 14 years ago. 
Hesponding in federal court to lawsuits over the attacks, the lawyers wrote that in 1993, the terrorist mastermind was forced out as a shareholder in two com­panies his fmnily owns. 
The eom pany filed the defense papers late Friday in U.S. District Court in answer to claims brought by reprnsentatives, sur­vivors and insurance earriers of the victims. The plaintiffs, who seek billions of dollars in dam­ages, allege the Saudi Binladin c;roup, along with numerous banks, charitins and individuals worldwide, provided material support and assistance to~ al­<)aida prior to the attacks. 
The plaintills contend Bakr bin Laden -Osama bin Laden's brother, the senior member of the bin Laden family and chair­man of Saudi Binladin Group ­was one of' al-Qaida's principal finaneiers.

These actions. they said, occurred well before the United States first placed Osama bin Laden on its list of designated terrorist individuals and organi­zations on Aug. 20. 1998. 
Osama bin Laden has more than 50 siblings who share in the fortune amassed after Osama's father, Mohammed bin Laden, built his construction empire, ele­vating his family to among the wealthiest in Saudi Arabia. The al-Qaida founder's financial worth has remainBd in dispute. 
The Sept. 11 commission con­cluded that the Sudanese govern­ment took Osama bin Laden's assets when he left the Sudan in 1996.

"When bin Laden arrived in Afghanistan, he relied on the Taliban until he was able to rein­vigorate his fundraising efforts by drawing on ties to wealthy Saudi individuals that he had estab­lished during the Afghan war in the 1980s." 
Lawyers for the bin Laden fam­ily companies have said Osama bin Laden never received any buyout payment. They said the companies consulted with Saudi authorities, who dirneted that the money be placed in trust outside Osama bin Laden's control.

SAN PEDRO SULA -Planes shuttled tourists from island resorts in a desperate airlift Monday as Hurricane Felix bore down on Honduras and Belize. But thousands of Miskito Indians were stranded along a swampy coastline where the Category 4 storm was expected to make landfall. 
Grupo Taca Airlines provided special free flights to the main­land, quickly touching down and taking off again to scoop up more tourists. Some 1,000 people were evacuated from the Honduran island of Hoatan, popular for its pristine reefs and diving resorts. Another 1,000 were removed from low-lying coastal areas and smaller islands. 
Felix's top winds weakened slightly to 135 mph as it head­ed west, but forecasters warned that it could strength­en again before landfall along the Miskito Coast early Tuesday. From there, it was projected to rake northern Honduras, slam into southern Belize on Wednesday and then cut across northern Guatemala and southern Mexico, well south of Texas. 
A storm surge of more than 18 feet above normal tides could devastate Indian com­munities along the Miskito Coast, a swampy, isolated region straddling the

"There's nowhere to go here," said teacher Sodeida Rodriguez, 26, who was hun­kering down in a concrete shelter. 
The only path to safety is up rivers and across lakes that are too shallow for regular boats, but many lack gasoline for long journeys. Provincial health official Efrain Burgos said shelters were being pre­pared, and medicine and sani­tation kits were being brought in, but that 18,000 people must find their own way to higher ground. 
"We're asking the people who are on the coasts to find a no rain yet. 
"We are ready to f'ace an eventual tragedy," said Hoatan fire chief Douglas Fajardo. 
Most tourists took the free flights out. but locals prepared to ride out the storm. 
"We know it's a tremendous hurricane that's coming," said real estate worker Estella Marazzito.

Around 2,300 members of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers left their jobs at 6 p.m. to begin a 72-hour strike, in a dispute stemming from the collapse of their employer, maintenance consortium Metronet. 
Many commuters were caught en route home when the strike took effect, forcing them to take overcrowded buses and taxis. 
Palestinian rockets land in Israel 
JERUSALEM -A Palestinian rocket exploded Monday next to a day care center crowded with toddlers in southern Israel, sparking anger and panic in the frequently targeted town of Sderot and bringing warnings of retribution from Israeli leaders. 
No one was hurt, but the blast and the panic underlined Israel's ineffectiveness in the face of the primitive rockets, which fall daily despite frequent Israeli airstrikes and occasional ground offensives. 
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert pledged to pro­vide "better security for the residents," indicat­ing he would step up the Israeli offensive against Palestinian militants. 
"We will not limit ourselves in regards to tar­geting the rocket launchers and those who dis­patch them," Olmert said at a news conference in Jerusalem. "The instruction given to the army is to destroy every 'Qassam' rocket launcher and anyone who is involved in their launching against the residents of Israel."

Popular musician shot and killed 
DALLAS -Jeffrey Carter Albrecht, a key­board player for the band Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, was shot to death early Monday while trying to kick in the door of his girlfriend's neighbor, police said. 
The neighbor, who was not immediately identified, was asleep in bed when he woke up around 4 a.m. to his wife screaming that someone was breaking into the house, according to a police report. The neighbor yelled through the door for Albrecht to leave and then fired his handgun through the door. Albrecht was shot in the head and died at the scene, police said. 
The case is under investigation and no arrests have been made. 
More kids diagnosed as bipolar 
CHICAGO -A new analysis suggests there's been a huge increase in the number of U.S. children diagnosed with bipolar disor­der, but experts question whether the surge is real and say some kids have been misla­beled. 
Researchers looked at the number of times children under 19 went to the doctor and were diagnosed with or treated for bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression. They found a 40-fold increase, from an esti­mated 20,000 visits in 1994 to 800,000 in 2003. The jump coincided with children's ris­ing use of antipsychotic medicine. 
Some doctors believe bipolar disorder doesn't occur in children, and until last month there was only one drug approved to treat the illness in kids.

UN Secretary-General pushes for peace 
Ban Ki-moon travels to the war-torn country in the hopes of improving a desperate situation 
Associated Press 
KHARTOUM Secretary-General Ban Ki­moon is in Sudan to "give a push" for a new round of talks to end the four­year regional conflict and mobilize support for the speedy deployment of a new 26,000-member peacekeeping force, a top 
U.N. official said Monday. 
Ban was expected to have dinner with President Omar al-Bashir before heading to south­ern Sudan on Tuesday to assess implementation of the 2005 agreement that ended a separate 21-year civil war between Sudan's Muslim government in the north and the mostly Christian southern rebels. 
He was then due Wednesday in Darfur to visit a camp for some of the 2.5 million people dis­placed by the conflict there, which has claimed more than 200,000 lives. 
"It is important to move on several fronts," Jean­Marie Guehenno, the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping, told reporters traveling with Ban. This is why the sec­retary-general has come to Sudan at this time, he said.

Tower of London 
gets female guard 
Woman first to join historic Beefeaters 
Associated Press 

LONDON -Thin first woman to join the rhnks of the Heefeaters in more than 500 years has mastered the Ceremony of the Keys, the nightly locking-up ritual of the Tower of London guards. 
But she says she is still learn­ing the bloody history of the site that holds the Crown .Jewels to prepare for guiding more than 2 million visitors every year. 
Dressed in a knee-length dark blue coat with red trim and matching top hat, Moira Cameron on Monday beeame the first female Beefeater, or Yeoman Wardnr, since the corps of Tower guards was founded in 1485. She told The Assoeiated Press the medieval castle is a wonderful place to work. 
"You do the job for prestige, and because you meet people every day," she said. She rel­ishes contact with visitors after 22 years of desk work as an army accountant. 
"It's wonderful to meet these people because they so want to be here and are interested in anything you can tell them. And you can have a really good laugh with them as well," she said. 
The Tower, arguably Britain's most famous historic site, was founded by King William I shortly after he con­

Cameron, 42, started drnam­ing of a job in the Tower after six years in the army. But back then, she doubted whether she would last the minimum of 22 years' service required to apply. 
The attraction is the "depth of history" in the place, she said. 
Whiln there was never any formal ban on female Beefeaters, Britain's Ministry of Defense said it was only rocnntly that many women, who can now count maternity leave as part of their service in the forces, wnre notching up as many years as men. 
Chief Yeoman Warder John Keohane said the guards had anticipated that a woman would one day join their ranks, and only one or two had exprnssed reservations. 
"She's been here for two months and been accepted by the community," said Keohane, vory much the traditional image of a bearded Beefeator. 
Cameron, who was chosen in December and has been train­ing at the Tower since .July, said only one visitor had nxpressed strong objections to hnr appointment. She shot baek: ''I'd like to thank you for dismissing my 22 years of loyal service to ller Majesty's servic­es." 
Yeoman Sgt. Alan Kingshott, a member of the selection panel. said Cameron's voice made a strong impression at her job interview where each candidate makes a short pres­entation. 
"We like to see whether they have the presence, the bearing, the voice to be able to put it across ... in front of 300 peo­ple," he said. "She's from Scotland. She's got a lovely tone to her voice." 
Cameron relished telling the story of a fellow Scot who got away from the Tower in the 18th century. 
"There was a Lord Nithsdale. He was part of the Jacobite rebellion, who actually escaped," she said. "His wife, she came in with her lady in waiting and dressed him up in a frock, and he escaped." 
Cameron found the Beefeaters' distinctive Victorian costume an improve­ment over the meager provi­sion of plain army uniforms. 
"Now I've got these wonder­ful huge pockets," she said, revealing the pockets beneath her coattails. 
Because of the style of the coat you can't see whatever it is in my pockets. "I've got a bottle of water, my phone, my

The Beefeater nickname is thought to derive from the guards' former privilege of having their fill of beef from the king's table. Formally, they are Yeoman Warders of Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London, and Members of the Sovereign's Body Guard of the Yeoman Guard Extraordinary. 
Cameron succeeded after two other women failed in earlier applications to become Yeoman Warders. 
"I didn't think I'd actually get the job, and I've already retrained myself to be a plumber and an electrician," she said. 
There was no big celebration in December when she learned that she had been chosen. 
"There was no one at home except my brother's dog," she said. laughing. "There was only the dog to dance with." 
ITALY 
Pope calls for environmental action 
Benedict XVI urges youth's responsibility to help save the planet 
Associated Press 
LORETO -The planet risks irreversible decline from envi­ronmentally unsustainable development, Pope Benedict XVI warned Sunday, urging young Catholics to take the lead in car­ing for the Earth and its precious resources. 
During an open-air Mass on the final day of a weekend reli­gious youth rally that drnw about 500,000 people to the town of Loreto, Italy's most important shrine dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Benedict said the world's water supply particularly needed to be preserved and shared equi­tably to avoid eonllicts. 
The Loreto meeting organized by the Italian bishops' confer­ence carried a strong environ­mental message. Participants were given biodegradable plates, recycling bags for their trash and a hand-cranked cell-phone recharger. 
Benedict told the crowd, camped out under umbrellas and tents on a vast, dusty field on the Adriatic coast, that it was up to them to save the planet from development that had often ignored "nature's delicate equi­librium." 
"Before it's too late, we need to make courageous choices that will recreate a strong alliance between man and Earth," Benedict said in his homily. "We need a decisive 'yes' to care for creation and a strong commit­ment to reverse those trends that risk making the situation of decay irreversible." 
He said water needed to be preserved since "it unfortunately becomes a source of strong ten­sions and conflicts if it isn't shared in an equitable and peaceful manner." 

Benedict lamented this week the environmental impact of recent forest fires in Italy and common good." 
Andrea Hingressi, 29, and his girlfriend of three years, Marta luzzolini, 27, said they appreciat­ed the pope's green message, partieularly during an event that was producing small mountains of plastic water bottles and other refuse.

Bush addresses housing market 
WASHINGTON-President Bush on Friday announced a set of modest proposals to deal with an alarming rise in mortgage defaults that have contributed to turbulent financial markets over recent weeks. 
Housing analysts said it was highly likely the limited steps Bush outlined will be expanded in coming weeks by a Democrat­controlled Congress intent on responding to growing voter anxiety as up to 2 million homeowners worry about losing their homes. 
Officials in the troubled housing industry said the important thing was that the admin­istration had finally offered a proposal, a step they said should help calm global finan­cial markets that have been on a rollercoast­er ride in recent weeks as investors worried about a serious credit crunch. 
Serious pension problems in Japan 
TOKYO -After reading a book this year about serious flaws in Japan's pension sys­tem, retired deliveryman Yoshikazu Hirano thought he'd check his own records just to be safe. 
He's glad he did: The 7 4-year-old discov­ered the government had shortchanged him by 460,000 yen ($3,770) in benefits he accrued while driving a truck for three years in the 1950s and 60s. 
Hirano wasn't alone. Shortly afterward, the government confessed to losing track of pension records linked to an astounding 64 million claims -igniting a scandal that has punished the ruling party at the polls and eroded confidence in the ability of the world's second largest economy to support its growing legions of elderly. 
Hirano, who is single .and lives outside Tokyo, felt defrauded. "Had I not asked, I would have never gotten the money back," he said. 
The pension mess, fully disclosed in May, has landed on one of the world's fastest­aging societies: 21 percent of its 127 million inhabitants are 65 or older and some 25 mil­lion retirees are collecting pensions, rising to 35 million by 2040.

Africa's economy changed by China 
The emerging superpower strongly affects the finances of the continent 
Associated Press 
DAKAR, -Selling shoes in the sweaty afternoon air of a West African mar­ket, Ousman Ka owes his job to China _ or, more precisely, to Lu Hui, the wrinkle-faced Chinese man in the blue sweater vest sitting behind him. 

"Before I was out of work, for about five years. Now I get by," says Ka, 29, from behind the counter of his stall as he pulls out blue-sequined flats for a woman's inspection. 
Nearly 4,000 miles away, in the copper mines of Zambia, it's a different story. Keith Mule, who maintains machinery at a Chinese-run mine, says he's making about half the salary of his counter­parts at other mines in the area.

Intelligence chief reveals role in captives' release 
Kirn faces criticism for working in public 
Associated Press 

SEOUL -The of'f'ieial code of' conduct for South Korea's main spy ageney was once "work in the shadows, aim for the light" -meaning that missions should be carried out in secret in pursuit of' the national interest. 
So South Koreans were sur­prised when Kim Man-bok, the National Intelligence Service chief, turned up in Afghanistan late last month, saying he directed negotia­tions with Taliban militants to gain the release of' 19 captive South Koreans. 
Kim personally brought back the Christian aid volun­tenrs after six weeks in grim conditions in the Afghan desert. Now, hownver, he is facing harsh criticism for allngedly pnrforming his d u tics too much in llw public eye. 
"Thn life of' an intelligence agency is confidential," the conservative mass circulation Chosun llbo newspaper said 
went there, was very inap­propriate," said Nam Ju­hong, an intelligenee expert at Seoul's Kyunggi University. "It could form a bad prece-· dent. given many kidnapping incidents are still taking place around the world." 
Further creating a stir was a press release Kim's aides distributed to journalists aboard the Korean Air flight that carried the hostages home, parts of which praised Kim's role. 
All South Koreans already knew the efforts made by the NIS, even if it didn't boast of them," the liberal Hankyoreh newspaper said in an editori­al. "They brought down their values by themselves with careless behavior. The NIS should be more mature." 
South Korea's intelligence chiefs have generally avoided the media spotlight in a coun­try that for decades has faeed tensions with communist rival North Korea. 
Kim, who took the top spy 
job in 
November, was

"If our nationals arn in dan­ger again in the future, I will not hesitate to go there even if' it is a plaee of death," Kim told an NIS meeting he presided over hours after he returned home Sunday with the former hostages, aceord­ing to reports in major South Korean media. 
The NIS refused to conl'irm the reports. 
Since he flew to Afghanistan on Aug. 22, Kim was seen in television footage sever<tl times, somntimes direetly talking to journalists and accepting requests for photos. 
On the weekend l'light from Dubai back to Seoul, TV footage even showed Kim talking to reportnrs about a South Korean man seated next to him, who had announced the deal with the Taliban on the release of the hostages. 
"This man persuaded (the Taliban) very well," Kim told reporters, of the mysterious figure, dubbed "sunglass man" by media for his ubiqui­tous shades and believed to be an NIS operative. "This guy speaks English, Pashtun and Iranian well," Kim said. "I ean say he is a custom­made negotiator."

following seeret visits to the communist North. 
The summit, originally sehed uled for late August, has been postponed until early October. 
Some critics are linking Kim's trip to Afghanistan to his reported intention to run in parliamentary elections next April, while others say Kim traveled to Afghanistan to deal with alleged Taliban demands for ransom. 
"I believe the reason why Kim went to Afghanistan has something to do with ran­som," Chung llyung-keun, a member of the main opposi­tion Grand National Party, told a party meeting Monday, according to an aide. 
"The government has denied the allegations, but I'm moving toward a solid beliof' that the government paid more than $20 million of ransom, conside'ring foreign media reports and other materials," Chung said, aeeording to the aide, Park Ung-seo. 
Chung served as a deputy intelligence chief in the mid­1990s. 
Kim denies any ransom was paid. 
"There was no such deal," he reiterated Sunday at the airport when the hostages returned. 
The N IS has also denied that Kim has any intention to run for election. 
"We've repeatedly denied that for a long time," said an NIS official who refused to give his name, citing agency policy.

pan~d foods like chicken nuggets ted two years ago to spending $560 million on improving meals. 
"The School Food Trust was very realistic when we began the transformation of' school meals. We were always anticipating a drop," the agency said in a state­ment. 
No "parent, caterer or head teacher would disagree that with increasing levels of type two dia­betes, hnart disease and obesity, something had to be done," the statement said. 
One factor in the drop may be children's rnluctance to change their eating habits, trust spokesman Brian Dow said. 
"This is a major eultural shill in children's attitudes, in five years time I think we will see sig­nificant growth," Dow told BBC television. "Gradually, children will gnt usnd to it." 
School eaterers say they sup­port the program's aims, but believe the ehanges may be too extreme. 
"We believe that such radieal changes to young p110ples dietary habits are too draconian and the spned or their introduction is too fast," the Loeal Authority. Caterers Association said in a July rnport. 
There arn also indications the government may need to spend more on thn program. 
The rnquirements for fresher ingrndients mean the average primary school meal price has rison 20 pereent since 2003 to $3.88, the association said. More than 91 pereent of' sehool cater­ers say they are now breaking even or losing money, compared to 2003 when all caterers were profitable. 
and released Monday. 

The figures show a 17 percent drop among secondary sehool students and a 9.6 percent drop among primary school pupils since the 2004-2005 school year. Students who opt out must either pack their own lunch or buy it elsewhere. 
Oliver is best known as the star of the television show "The Naked Chef' -a reference not to nudity but to the bare simpliei­
ty of his recipes. Although he remains the pub­lic faee of the effort to get chil­dren to eat healthily, he has no formal role in the School Food Trust. 
Nevertheless, on Monday the chef urged par­ent<; and the gov­ernment to stay 
or the turkey twizzler a eorkscrew of' mainly reconstitut­ed turkey scraps and preserva­tives. Such meals, usually served with piles of fatty french fries, could cost as little as 66 cenL'i. 
Spurred to aetion, the govern­ment set up the Sehool Food Trust in 2005 to help sehools improve the quality of their food. Sample menus for the new pro­gram inel uded vegetarian quiche, lentil burgers and mush­room tagliatelle. 
But more than 424,000 stu­dents opted out of their sehool meal plans in the first two years of the program, according to gov­ernment ligures obtained by the opposition Liberal Democrats committed to the program. 
''I'm still committed to it, but really over the next five years, we'll see that negative turn into a positive," he told British Broadeasting Corp. radio. "We have to be philosophical, we have to keep supporting it," he said. "We have to know and do what's best for our kids." 
The British government has warned that one in six British children is obese, saying the fig­ure could rise to half of all chil­dren by 2050. 
The School Food Trust con­firmed the numbers had dropped, but said the trend was part of a decline that began before the government commit-

Harry Oliver passed away a few weeks ago. 
To current Notre Dame students, this probably doesn't mean a thing. However, for many of us legions of Irish football fans, particularly Eduardo those around in 
Magallanez
the early 1980s, his left-footed 

Gue!it Columnist 
soccer-style kick resulted in prob­ably our fondest moment and memory in Notre Dame football. llis being, however, repre­sents somnthing much larger that Notre Dame students and alumni aspire to achieve. 
I've never written a tribute like this before, but I came across the news article that announced Harry's passing on the Notre Dame football website while I was surfing earlier today. I was moved at the news, not only because of that moment now seared into my mem­ory, but also of the life Harry lived while at Notre Dame and after leaving. I don't consider myself a rah-rah, win­at-any-cost alum. I have simple needs and desires-that the Irish play well. ND wins and ND loses, and the sun still rises in the east. 
It is a sunny Saturday afternoon in September 1980. A brisk wind is blow­ing from the south-remember that. Notre Dame Stadium is filled to capaci­ty, around 60,000 in those days, for another dassic battle between the Fightin' Irish and the visiting Michigan Wolverines. The lead changes hands throughout the game. Late in the fourth quarter, Michigan scores what appears to be the game-winning touchdown with 41 seconds left: the score is Michigan 27, ND 26. 
Notre Dame starts on its own 20-yard line. While the rest of the game remains blurry, as are most ND games I've attended or watched on TV. these last seconds weren't. The Hail Mary's just weren't hitting their targets, and one senses the frustration throughout the crowd. An opportune pass interference penalty movPs the ball to midfield. A few plays later, the ball is on the Michigan 34-yard line and four seconds remain on the clock. Coach Dan Devine sends Harry Olivm into the game to attempt a seemingly impossi­ble 51-yard field goal into the brisk wind. 
Harry Oliver never became a celebri­ty. He lived in Grace Hall, which, along with Flanner, was a dorm at the time. lie attended elasses like the rest of us and never called attention to himself even with his new-found fame. He had respectable numbers with the football team. He was humble in accepting the spotlight that was suddenly thrust in his face after "the kick." And like so many of ND's student-athletes. did not pursue a career in professional sports. 
A mechanical engineering major, he went on to work as an engineer in the 
construction business and became a 
senior estimator and project manager 
at a construction firm in Cincinnati. 
Many of his projects were geared 
towards charitable organizations and 
schools in southern Ohio, according to 
Pete LaFleur, who wrote the artide on 
the Notre Dame football website. 
Back in the sophomore section, and throughout the stadium. the crowd is hushed and all eyes are focused on this one guy, this one player who has been called upon to carry the weight of the game and all the Notre Dame legends on his shoulders. Well, on his kicking leg anyway. The ball is snapped. Harry kicks and ther.e is a scramble at the line of scrimmage. The ball sails through the air and heads toward the uprights. Because of the confusion on the field, and the faet that we're wit­nessing this moment from the north end of the stadium, it is difficult to tell whether the football made it over the crossbar. 
To this day, many who attended the game say that just before Harry kicks tho ball, the brisk 15 mile-per-hour wind that wreaked havo!: throughout the game suddenly went silent. Even the late Michigan coaeh Bo Schembechler "daimed until the day he died that the wind 
stopped right before Harry's kick" according to former ND coach Gerry Faust. The leg­ends would later say that the fans at that end of the field sucked air, while those of us at the north end blew fiercely to help the ball over. I guess we all wanted to feel we had a hand in the outcome of the game. 
The silence of those four seconds that seemed to last forever was broken by a growing roar coming from the south end of Notre Dame Stadium as the field oflicials performed their imperson­

ations of "Touchdown Jesus." The kick 
was good! Pure, unadulterated joy 
broke out throughout the stadium. 
Someone in the upper levels of our sec­
tion lost his or her balance and the 
entire sophomore section collapsed on 
itself, row by row. Thankfully there 
were no casualties and the celebrations 
continued with a mad dash of students 
and fans charging onto the field. 
"Michigan 27. Notre Dame 26, GOD 
3." That's how the banner headline 
from the University of Michigan news­
papnr read the following Monday. 
God calls on all of us to face ehal­
lenges daily. Some great, some small. 
but all with the potential to impact 
lives, many or fPw. These challenges 
manifest themselves in the dassroom, 
on the playing liPid. at Sacred Heart, 
with family, or in the community. 
When we )nave Notre Dame, we are 
charged to go out and make contribu­
tions to improve God's world. 
I don't know that Ilarry Oliver ever knew what the kick meant to the thou­sands of Notre Dame fans who were witnesses to that special moment on tho field. And he probably nevnr fully appreciated the impact in pursuing his calling with the construction company in Ohio. But countless numbers of school children. workers, and those less fortunate will benefit for years to come from him sharing his talent with us. Great things can be accomplished 
in just 47 years. 
As Notre Dame begins another 
academic year and the football 
season is again upon us, I 
wish that current students 
will experience a Harry 
Oliver moment seared 
into their memories like 
many graduates before 
and since "the kick", 
moments that inspire 
us to take actions 
that have positive 
influences in other 
people's lives, 
moments that make 
Notre Dame special 
even in the midst of 
her shortcomings. 
I also hope that 
each of us accepts 
the challenges God 
calls on us to bear and 
for which Our Lady's 
University prepan~s us. 
And that we accept those 
challnngPs with the grace 
and humility as llarry did that 

day in Septnmber, during his life 
at NO and beyond. 
I never met Harry Oliver: I only knew about him from the game. But like everyone special in my life, he gave me a moment that can never be taken away and left us an example of a life worthy of imitation. And I pray that I am a better person for it. Hest in peace, Harry. 
And thanks for the memory.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Keep fighting ordinance 
In response to Andrea Laidman's attack on the United States of America, entitled "You gotta fight for your right" (Sept. 3). I first must point out that Osama Bin Laden, Jane Fonda and Hugo Chavez wero all political science and peace studies majors so I simply can't help but question whether Andrea is also a terrorist or simply a misguided youth caught up in a society currently dictated by the liberal media. 
As far as the content of her (mostly made up) argument, Notro Dame students are very active in the world around them, from local volunteer­ing all over South Bend (over 300,000 hours of service per year), to traveling to D.C. every year to protest the slaughter of innocent children, also known as abortion, and even raising awareness for international issues such as the genocide in Darfur (special shout out to the kids who made me sign that Darfur banner in the dining hall). 
Andrea claims that terrorists are being held without charge at Gitmo -of course they are being held without charge, they are terrorists! You would see boat loads of student activism if the government weren't detaining terrorists. The reason you see 2,400 students protesting laws targeting students is because we are all students. You don't see a ton of Notre Dame kids rising up against Guantanamo Bay detentions because only a handful of Notre Dame students are ter­rorists. IfI were a terrorist, I would obviously be as upset about wiring tapping as Andrea is. 
The reason students are so upset about the ordinance is because this is supposed to be col­lege. There are at least 2,400 students who understand that the freedom to choose whether or not they wish to drink is a part of college (and America for that matter). I encourage all stu­dents to continue respectfully fighting the South Bend ordinance and ask that you all keep defending America from the terrorists, wherever they may lie.

Bum_per sticker defense 
It was with humor and pride that I read the viewpoint regard­ing the Bush/Cheney bumper sticker that closes out the video highlighting the class of 2011. The writers, while heralding the ethnic diversity showcased in the video, disdainfully lament the impression left that Notre Dame may be regarded as endorsing the current administration. What about political diversity? As the owner and driver of the vehicle in question, I should note that the car has transported to cam­pus not one, but two students who embrace decidedly opposing political viewpoints from that of their parents. Ours continues to be a household where members are encouraged to discuss vary­ing viewpoints and welcomes and accepts political differences. 

Diversity calls for one to step out­side previously held considera­tions and assumptions. The inclusion of the bumper sticker in the video, if notable at all, should be seen as an indication of the diversity present on cam­pus, not as an indication of its absence. The University of Notre Dame fosters a climate of critical epistemology and it saddens me that the writers have seemingly lost that open-mindedness and choose to make their own politi­cal statement by zeroing in on a small, and what could have been an unremarkabie, inclusion on the video.

New technology plays key role in 2008 election 
Kisses are planted on the foreheads of infants, the hands of stern fathers are shaken and staged photographs of candi­dates at blue-collar barbecues are taken as part of the traditional campaign trail for the presidency of the United States. Nicolas Persac But as the 2008 election approach­
The Daily 

es, candidates on 
Reveille

both sides of the aisle must embrace new technologies to maximize their cam­paign's success. 
James Garand, political science professor at Louisiana State University, said candi­dates are looking to technological develop­ments for new campaign strategies. 
"At the beginning of every campaign, particularly in recent years, candidates and the political consultants who advise them do not want to be in the position where they have not been at the forefront of the technology," Garand said 
This year one such obstacle is the rising popularity of voter-to-candidate communi­cation via the Internet. The CNN-YouTube Democratic Party debate, which aired on July 23, allowed people to video record themselves asking candidates questions. CNN and YouTube.com officials selected nearly 70 questions to be viewed and answered by the eight Democratic con­tenders who participated in the debate. The Republican candidate's installment is scheduled to air Sept. 17. 
"This is a new application of the technol­ogy," Garand said. "This opens up a whole set of unpredictable aspects. The possibility of questions and comments being non-tra­ditional becomes much greater." 
Garand said these formats may cause some candidates to be wary of participating in such debates. 
"The YouTube format permits questions coming from regular people, and the possi­bility of new issues coming up is substan­tial, which is of course one of the reasons candidates get nervous," Garand said. "It's one thing ifI'm a candidate and I know members of the new media are going to ask me questions one tl;rrough 10, but it's a little bit more difficult for me to prepare ifI can also get questions 11 through 500." 
According to Reuters, Nielsen Media Research shows the Democratic install­ment of the debates had the highest ratings in the 18 to 34 demographic of any debate broadcast on a cable news network. The 407,000 viewers between ages 18 and 34 broke the previous record in that demo­graphic of 368,000 people viewing the June 3 Manchester, New Hampshire Democratic debate. The New Hampshire debate had a higher total number of viewers, 2.8 million, compared to 2.6 million who watched the CNN-YouTube debate. In the 25 to 54 demographic, only 890,000 viewers watched the CNN-YouTube debate while 
1.1 million watched CNN's New Hampshire debate. 
"We know young people are the least likely to participate in the electoral process and the least likely to vote," Garand said. "In one sense, this is reaching one group of citizens who are usually low-participation [voters]." 
Robert Hogan, associate political science professor, said the content of the CNN­YouTube debate may have drawn the younger crowd. 
The YouTube debate was comical," Hogan said. "Part of the reason people watched was the same reason people watch the Super Bowl. It's not so much the game but the commercials. And in this case it's what sort of nuance way people are going to use to ask questions." 

Hogan said the non-traditional aspects of the debates may cause candidates such as Republican front-runner Mitt Romney to speak out against participating in the next CNN-YouTube debate-in which only two Republican candidates, Arizona Sen. John McCain and Texas Rep. Ron Paul have committed to participate. 
Garand said the user-friendly format of the CNN-YouTube debates opens the demo­cratic process to more people. He said technology broadens participation and is viewed as a democratization of the process. 
"Candidates will try to use available tech­nology as best they can," Garand said. "And whatever that new technology is in 2012 you can rest assured that candidates will use it to try to reach voters that are traditionally not being reached. They will take advantage of the technologies as we develop them."

Ben llarper is undeniably one of the premier musical talents in the modern popular scene. His skills resonate through every high and low of his grainy tenor voice, jump down the strings of his signature Weissenborn guitar, and settle softly, but strikingly, on the ears of his listeners. 
Ben Harper was born in Claremont, Calif., and has been playing the guitar since he was a child. He released his first LP, "Pleasure and Pain," as a joint effort with folk guitarist Tom Freund. 
"Fight For Your Mind," released in 1995, became a college radio favorite and established Harper's position in the music scene. Collectively, Harper has released 11 albums and has climbed as high as No. 7 on the Billboard Music 200. Perhaps Harper's most well-known track is "Steal My Kisses," from his 1999 album "Burn To Shine." 
In Harper's most recent effort, "Lifeline," collaboration with his band The Innocent Criminals, Harper tosses a life preserver to the average listener drowning in the sea of musical homo­geneity.

PGA TouR 
Associated Press 

NORTON, Mass.-Phil Mickelson's return to Beantown was sweeter than he ever imagined. 
He was sitting in a suite at Fenway Park on Saturday night when Boston Red Sox rookie Clay Buchholz threw a no-hitter. And on a Labor Day fmish that brought play­off atmosphere to the PGA Tour, Lefty pitched a gem of his own. 
With thousands of fans standing six-deep behind the greens, and hundreds more camped out in front of video boards, Mickelson blew away Tiger Woods with a flawless front nine and held him ofT down the stretch to win the Deutsche Bank Championship, a sign that Lefty is healthy enough to again challenge the world's No. 1 player. 
"I had a lot of fun -not just today, this whole week," said Mickelson, who closed with a S-under 66 for a two-shot victory Monday. "We went and saw the no-hitter in Fenway Park. How often does that happen?" 
More often than Mickelson going head-to-head in the final round against Woods and winning the tourna­ment. 
That was a first. 
But the way he played all week, including the first two rounds with Woods and Vijay Singh, it might not be 
IN BRIEF 

Elbow injury may keep
Clemens out for a time 
NEW YORK -Roger Clemens got banged up by the Seattle Mariners, and then quickly left the clubhouse after the Yankees' 7-1 loss on Monday to get an MRI exam on his balky right elbow. 
The 45-year-old Clemens, who allowed five runs and eight hits in four innings to lose for the first time since July 28 at Baltimore, felt his elbow tighten up during the game, manager Joe Torre said. 
"First three innings it was a man­ageable situation for him and then it started to tighten up," Torre said. "Hopefully it's just something that needs a little rest." 
Torre was noncommittal about whether Clemens would remain on schedule in the rotation. His next start would likely be Sunday at Kansas City. 
"For safety sake, we may skip a turn but it all depends on what the tests show," Torre said. 
the last. 

"This is what we hoped the summer would be," swing coach Butch Harmon said from Las Vegas. "And if it hadn't have been for the hand injury, it would have been." 
It was the first victory for Mickelson since The Players Championship in May, when he looked ready to make another run at Woods. Then he injured his left wrist that cost him his summer, and only recently has Mickelson been able to swing without flinching. 
The pain on this Labor Day belonged to Woods. 
He couldn't make a putt on the front nine, and couldn't deliver enough clutch putts 
page 15 

while trying to make up ground on the final holes. He wound up with a 67 despite taking 32 putts, which left him tied for second with Arron Oberholser (69) and Brett Wetterich (70), who played in the final group of what seemed like a Nationwide Tour gallery. 
The buzz outside Beantown was on the biggest names in golf, and Mickelson relished this victo­ry. 
"For 10 years I've strug­gled against Tiger," Mickelson said. "This sure feels great to go head-to­head ... and over the last five or six holes when he's mak­ing a run, it was fun to match him with birdies." 
Frye to start as Brown's 
quarterback over Quinn 
BEREA, Ohio -lhe suspense is over. 01arlie Frye will start at quarterback for Oeveland's season opener Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
Frye, who started 13 games last year, battled in training camp to keep his job after coach Romeo Crennel turned tl1e starting position into an open competition. After offSeason workouts and minicamps, Frye entered training camp slightly behind Derek Anderson. 
But Frye outperformed Anderson during preseason games and directed one touch­down drive against the Denver Broncos. Anderson produced no touchdowns when he led the offen..<>e during preseason games. 
Frye said he's made strides since last sea'illn. 
"I think I'm a lot more poised and my game management is better," Frye said. "It comes from experience and being pushed by other guys. You make sacrifices and th~ sacrifices end up helping your game out. 

Strahan reports to Giants 
after five week holdout 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -Seven­time Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Strahan reported to the New York Giants on Monday, six days before the season opener. 
Ending a holdout that may cost him more than $500,000 in fmes, Strahan arrived unobserved at Giants Stadium around 4 p.m., handled some paper­work and met with general manager Jerry Reese and coach Tom Coughlin. He also took a physical and left after 45 minutes, not making himself avail­able for comment. 
The 35-year-old Strahan, who held out for more than five weeks and missed all four preseason games while deciding whether to play a 15th season or retire, will practice on Tuesday. 
"It's all behind us," Reese said, sit­ting in his car beneath Giants Stadium. "We're moving forward and getting ready for Dallas."

Martinez gets 3,000th strikeout in return from DL 
M·cCann, Braves send Phillies to third straight loss; Snell throws seven strong innings to beat Cardinals 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI-Working with 
a fastball that was past its 
primn, l'ndro Martinez made a 
vintage eomnbaek. 
Back on the mound for the lirst timn in almost a year. the right-hander got his 3,000lh earenr strikeout Monday and led tho rnsurgent New York Mots to a 10-4 win over the Cincinnati Hmls. 
A victory and a little bit of 
history, too. 
"Can't ask for anything bet­
ter than that." manager Willie 
Handolph said. "llo's amazing. 
I shouldn't even be surprised, 
rnally. Pndro was superb." 
Martinez (1-0l had major shoulder surgery last Oct. 5. lin returned after just four rnhabilitation appearances in tho minors, lnaving some ques­tions about his readiness. The Mots dncidnd to put him on a 75-piteh limit that left him no margin for error to got through livn innings and get a win. 
Somehow, he managed. 
Martinez threw 76 pitches while limiting the Heds to three runs and five hits in five innings. Four of his pitches came on an intentional walk. With two runners aboard in the fifth, Martinez got Adam Dunn -the last batter he'd get to face -to hit into a rally­killing groundout. 
Then, he pumped his fist. 
"Indescribable," the three­time Cy Young winner said. "So far, so good. It was good enough. I did what I was sup­posed to do. I got 75 pitches in. I gave my team an opportunity. I felt I settled down after the first inning and got everything in control again." 
His performance helped the NL East leaders get control of their division again, increasing their lead to five games over Philadelphia. The lead was down to only two games last week, when the allure of adding a pitcher with playoff experience became too much to resist. 
Martinez didn't disappoint. 
"That's Pedro, and he's going to get better," catcher Paul Lo Duca said. 
Even though the Reds didn't do much against Martinez, they could see he had a long way to go. 
"lie didn't look like he had his old stuff, and I wouldn't expect him to," said first base­man Scott Cormier (2-4) struck out five 


with one walk in his second 
straight win. 
"I feel like I'm where I need 
to be," Cormier said. "You're 
not always going to have the 
best outing of your life, but it 
feels good to get a win today." 
Brian McCann hit a two-run 
double in a three-run fourth 
inning as the Braves snapped a 
three-game losing streak and 
avoided falling to .500 for the 
first time since June 24. 
Peter Moylan, Manny Acosta, Tyler Yates and Rafael Soriano combined to pitch 3 1/3 hitless innings for Atlanta. 
Moyer struck out seven but gave up nine hits in 5 2/3 innings. He walked two batters while suffering his first loss in three starts against Atlanta this season. 
The Phillies took a 1-0 lead 
in the fourth when Utley dou­
bled to right and scored on Pat 
Burrell's single to left. 
Philadelphia's only other serious threat came in the sixth, when Burrell popped out to end the inning with runners on first and third. 
"It wasn't our day," Utley said. "We didn't swing the bats very well. ... Playing today's game in warm weather didn't help. The heat wears on you." 
Pirates 11, Cardinals 0 
The last two times Jan Snell has beaten the Cardinals on the road, he's knocked them back to .500. This time, it real­ly had to hurt for St. Louis. 

Snell threw seven scoreless innings to end a six-game road losing streak since winning in St. Louis on April 16, and the Pittsburgh Pirates halted a five-game losing streak, rout­ing Kip Wells on Monday. 
The Cardinals, coming off a three-game sweep over the Reds, entered the day two games back of the Cubs in the NL Central. On Sunday, the defending World Series cham­pions moved above .500 for the first time since April 15. 
Snell sent them back to 6 7­67, just as he evened their record at 6-6 in mid-April. 
"Today was a great start for him," catcher Honny Paulino said. "He was throwing his fastball in and out. He wasn't just throwing it in there, he was making it happen." 
Jack Wilson matched a career high with four hits, including a two-run home run, and had three HB!s as the Pirates emerged from a skid in which they were outscored 35­
13. Paulino and Freddy Sanchez both went 3-for-4 with two HBis. 
Wilson missed a chance to hit for the cycle in the ninth when he lined into a double play, although he said he had­n't been aware until St. Louis catcher Gary Bennett informed him. 
"He goes 'Single, single, dou­ble, home run,'" Wilson said. "I was taking because he had just walked a guy on four pitches, but Bennett is a guy who's so nice he'll give me a first-pitch fastball just to try it. Sure enough." 
The Pirates had 15 hits in 25 at-bats when reliever Andy Cavazos was chased in a five­run fifth that made it 11-0. They scored in each of the first five innings. 
Cardinals pitchers gave up a double-digit run total for the 17th time this season, five of them in games started by Wells (6-16), and dropped back to .500. Wells and Jose Contreras of' the White Sox are tied for the major league lead in loss­es. 
"His biggest problem today was throwing the ball in the middle of the plate, mostly up where guys can get to it," man­ager Tony La Russa said. "That's his biggest problem, by the way. 
"He put us in a big hole." 
A good portion of a sellout crowd cheered when La Hussa emerged from the dugout to yank Wells, who lasted 3 1/3 innings and gave up six runs and 10 hits. Wells was booed heavily as he left the field. 
Wells entered 2-0 with an 
0. 75 ERA against his former team, beating them on May 23 to snap a personal worst seven-game losing streak. Wells was bumped from the rotation in mid-June after going 2-11 with a 6.93 EHA and lately he's been struggling 

again, going 0-3 with a  10.80  
in his last three starts.  
"Having  already  been  

through the adversity I've had this year, it's not like I'm going to bury myself," Wells said. "I'm just going to do what I can to give myself the best chance to be successful."

Maybe it was the heat. Perhaps it was carryover from a bad loss to the Marlins. Whatever it was, Hyan lloward and Aaron Howand couldn't make eontact, and the Philadelphia Phillies lost again. 
Howard and Howand com­bined to go 0-for-7 with five strikeouts and the Phillies lost to the Atlanta Braves on Monday. 
Philadelphia, only two games out of first place four days ago, suddenly is five back in the NL East, and last week's optimism is fading as the deficit grows. 
"We've got to find a way to recreate some momentum here and turn this into a respectable trip," Jamie Moyer (12-11) said after giving up four runs in 5 2/3 innings. 
The Phillies swept New York in a four-game series last week to pull to within two games of the Mets. Since then, they've lost three of four, including two of three at Florida. 
"Those four wins against New York don't mean as much at this point," Moyer said. 
Manager Charlie Manuel suggested the Phillies hadn't recovered from Sunday's 7-6 loss to the Marlins, when Philadelphia blew a 5-0 lead. 
"I'd say some of the game yesterday carried over to today," Manuel said, adding he is worried about the growing gap between the Mets and his team. 
"We're losing ground with 25 games to play," Manuel said. "Yeah, of course we do [worry]." 
Added Moyer: "You can't make up five games until you make up one game. You can't look down the road." 
The Braves recovered after being swept by New York in a 
three-game 
weekend series,

Cameron looks to rebuild in Miami 
First-year coach will try to end Miami's 6­year playoff drought 
Associated Press 

DAVII~. Fla. -Bob Knight ronwmbors well how tho nnw Miami Dolphins coach got his start in tho profession. 
It was IIJX4. and aftnr playing two sports at Indiana, Cam Camnron wanted to pursue a football coaching caroM. lie sought lwlp from Knight. and thn lloosinrs basketball coach rnadn a <~all to Mkhigan football coach Bo Sdwmbechler. who had an oponing for a graduate assistant. 
"Bo said. 'Get him up here tomorrow morning,"' Knight says. "I told Cam, 'Schmnbnchler will be in his oflice at 8 o'dock. You be sitting on the step at 7 .' II n said, 'Where is it'!' I said, 'You'd better find it.' 
"lie was there when Bo camo in, and Bo really liked him.'' 
Somo 23 years latm, Cameron is starting another nnw job. I le rnakos his debut as an NFL head coach Sunday for the Miami Dolphins at Washington. 
"Coaching is all I know," ( :ameron says. "My mothnr mar­ried a eoach when I was 13. I don't know anything elso." 
Dons he know enough to trans­f'orm tho Dolphins into champi­ons? It has bfwn six seasons sinen thoir last playofl' game, 15 since they reached the AFC championship game, 23 since thny mado the Super Bowl. and 34 since tlwir most roeent NFL titlo. 
Miami wont 6-10 last year undor Nick Saban, and the Cameron nra begins with expec­tations of at least modest improvement in 2007. But it's dnar thn

ing nine draft Vonnie Holliday, picks, the most to a 10-year pro. make the team in Jason Taylor "As a head 10 years. Dolphins defensive end coach, that's 
"You talk about rebuilding, and veterans don't want to hear that word," All-Pro defensive end Jason Taylor says. "But any time you have a new coaching sta!T, you're rebuilding. 
"Cam brought in veterans ­he brought in Joey Porter and Trent Green, guys he's trying to usn to get this thing fixed now and not just waiting for down the road. Even with rookie guys, you never know what ean happen. 
"It may not take five years. It may not take one year. We'll have to wait and see." 
Cameron has yet to lose a game, and he dissipated the oppressive atmosphere created by his successor, so it's no sur­prise his players praise him. Some of his deeisions have left observers scratching their !wads, however. 
Cameron passed on taking Brady Quinn in the first round of thn April draft. even though the Dolphins despnratnly needed a quarterback. lin instead drafted Tnd (;inn .Jr., touting his return skills, thnn gave the kickof'f­rnturn job to starting running back Honnin Brown. lie declared the ()B job open whnn it was a foregone conclusion Green would be the starter. lie called a Statue of Liberty style play to scorn a touchdown in an exhibi­tion game, instead of waiting until the mgular season to pull it ofr. 
During the prnseason, such issues crnatn only a ripple. Once thn games start to count, every dneision can carry snismie f'orcP. 
Especially if' Cameron loses. 
"''m not a worrier. I don't go down that road," he says. "The head coach is put in a position to succeed here, and I knew that bef'om I took the job." 
IIn was hired af'tpr five yeai·s as ofTnnsive coordinator for the high-scoring San Diego Chargers. lie's the first Dolphins head coach with an of'fensive baekground since Georgn Wilson in the late 1960s, and he'II even <~all plays himself. 
Oll'!mse is where the Dolphins were desperate for an upgrade. The unit will have six new starters, along with Cameron's intricate playbook, which emphasizes speed, precision, 
ereating  mismatches  .and  
spreading the ball around.  
"Cam  understands  this  

ollimse," GrP-en says. "IIis exten­sive baekground in it is going to be very beneficial for every­body." 
Green and Cameron worked together when both were with thn Washington Hedskins, and Cameron relied heavily on such past associations while putting together his staff and roster. He has previous ties with at least night players, and he has worked before with seven of his assistant coaehes. 
lie's much more inclined to delegate to players and assis­tants than Saban. 
"The thing that's impressive about eoach Camnron is he does 
not mind leaning 
on the people 
who have been 
probably tough 
to do sometimes 
as the guy on top. It shows something about his character that he's able to do that." 
Cameron is also quick to acknowledge his many mentors, including Marty Schottenheimer, Diek Vermeil and Knight. 
"They're a phone call away," Cameron says. "And that helps." 
Knight, now coach at Texas Tech, says he talks with Cameron several times a year. Knight's a fan of his protege even though Cameron went 18­37 in five years at Indiana ­until now his only head-coaching job. 
Cameron was fired after a 5-6 season in 2001. 
"Sheer stupidity," Knight says. "lie took over when they had hit a low spot in recruiting. Just as Cam got the thing going, they firnd him. 
"lin's a very bright guy and has a great work ethic. He'll work very hard. lie communi­eatos vory well, and he'll work at getting players ready to play both physically and mentally. I think it'll bn a really good situa­tion for the Dolphins." 
WNBA PLAYOFFS 

Detroit advances to finals again 
Nolan's 30 points help Shock continue quest to defend title 
Associated Press 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. ­Deanna Nolan scored 20 of her franchise playoff-record 30 points in the first half to help the defending champion Detroit Shock advance to the WN BA finals with an S1-65 victory over the Indiana Fever in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals Monday night. 
The Shock will face Phoenix starting Wednesday night as they go for their second straight title and third in five years. Detroit has won both postseason series this year 2­1 after losing Game 1 on the road, and is now 7-0 when facing elimination the last two seasons. 
Indiana led by 1:~ points in the opening minutes, but lost both the lead and All-Star forward Tamika Catchings in the second quarter. Catchings, who missed the final 13 regular-season games with a left-foot injury, strained her right Achilles' tendon in the last minute of the first half and did not return. 
Cheryl Ford, playing her third game in four days on a bad knee, had 15 rebounds in just 18 minutes. Swin Cash scored 12 points and Katie Feenstra added 11, matching her total in Detroit's first five playoff games. 
Indiana was going for its first conference title, but Tammy Sutton-Brown (17)

and Tully Bevilaqua (14) were the only Fever players to reach double figures. Tamika Whitmore, who had a league-record 41 points against Detroit in a first­round game last year, fin­ished with nine on 3-for-10 shooting. 
The Shock, known for their slow starts, trailed 16-3 with Ford on the bench in foul trouble. 
Nolan, though, singlehand­edly kept Detroit in the game. She had 20 points in a 14­minute span to help the Shock tie the game at 28. 
Plenette Pierson's jumper gave the Shock their first lead -30-28 -and drew a standing ovation from the previously silent crowd. 
Detroit used a 28-10 run over a 13-minute stretch to 
take a 35-30 lead at the half. and scored the first six points of tlH~ third quarter to go up by 11. 
Indiana came back, pulling within 44-43, but two straight put-backs by Ford helped the Shock build a safer margin. 
Ford had nine rebounds and a blocked shot in the period. and Detroit took a 57­47 lead into the fourth. The Shock led by as many as 20 in the fourth. 
Ford was called for a tech­nical with 5:11 to play after taking a swing at Sutton­Brown.

NCAA FOOTBALL 
O'Brien dreading return to BC 
New NC State coach returns to Boston to take on former team 
Associated Press 
RALEIGH, N.C. --During a decade at Boston College, Tom O'Brien grew familiar with every nook and cranny of cozy Alumni Stadium. 
Except one: the visitors' locker room. 
He'll lind out what it's like in there soon enough, at the end of a week he has been dread­ing seemingly since he was hired by North Carolina State. 
O'Brien is bracing for an uncertain reception during his first trip north to face the BC team he deserted in December when he made a rare in-con­ference switch. 
"I had a great experience at BC, and those kids are special kids up there, but come Saturday, my job is to win the football game and do the best I can for these kids at N.C. State, and with every breath and passion I have, that's what I'm going to do," O'Brien said Monday. 
"Now I know those kids on the other sideline, (their job) is to win the game for BC, and that's what they're going to do. And then, after the game we can all talk after it's over and then we'll never talk about this again. It will be over with." 
O'Brien, who says he only occasionally passed through the guests' locker room, isn't sure what to expect from the Boston College fans. 
He knows many of them felt jilted nine months ago when

he bolted the Atlantic Coast Conference contending Eagles for an N.C. State team that fell into the Atlantic Division cellar under fired coach Chuck Amato. 
''I'm pretty sure they love Coach O'Brien up there," line­backer Ernest Jones said. "So I don't think they're going to be negative toward the coach because he left a pretty good team there. They should have a positive vibe." 
The coach hopes they remember fondly how in 1997 he took over a BC program ravaged by a gambling scan­dal, built the Eagles into Big East contenders and shep­herded them through a messy switch to the ACC. 
The appeal of coaching at a state university with deep pockets, expansive facilities and a rabid fan base was enough to convince O'Brien to make just the second in-con­ference switch in the league's football history. 
"You get an occasional shot here or there, but it's probably 50 to 1," O'Brien said. "People recognize what went on in the 10 years at Boston College, from what I inherited to the scandal ... to restoring the integrity of the program and becoming a solid Top 25 pro­gram. 
"Certainly you want to leave a program better than you inherit it, and there's no ques­tion we did that." 
There are times when O'Brien misses the enthusiasm of college hockey, the buzz of a Red Sox crowd at Fenway Park and the camaraderie of friends with the NFL's Patriots. 
"I guess maybe that's bad now that I'm here in Panther country," he joked, referring to New England's Super Bowl vic­tory over Carolina in 2004. 
His new players say their taciturn taskmaster doesn't bore them with tales of Boston. 
"We don't get too many sto­ries from Coach O'Brien," tight end Marcus Stone dead­panned. 
Still, it's clear O'Brien has a soft spot for the former players he'll try to beat. Defensive ends Alex Albright and Nick Larkin graduated from the same Cincinnati high school that O'Brien attended, and he called cornerback DeJuan Tribble "another of my Cincinnati boys." 
And he praised quarterback Matt Ryan as "definitely the best quarterback in this con­ference, and maybe the top quarterback in the country." 
There are plenty of ties con­necting the schools' coaching staffs, too. 
O'Brien brought six mem­bers of his BC staff to Raleigh, including offensive coordinator Dana Bible and longtime recruiting coordinator Jerry Petercuskie. 
One of the coaches left behind, defensive coordinator Frank Spaziani, led the Eagles to a Meineke Bowl victory after O'Brien's departure. He was retained by new coach Jeff Jagodzinski --whom O'Brien hired a decade ago to coordinate BC's offense. 
"Frank and I go a way back, a lot of shared ideas back and forth, and he and Dana have been going against each other for eight years," O'Brien said. "There isn't going to be any­thing that they don't know about each other."

Colts looking to gallop past Saints 
Dungy's squad will rely on offense in start of title defense 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS The Indianapolis Colts would do almost anything to avoid slowing down. 
They live on a no-huddle offense and quick-hitting scores, and rely on defensive speed to force oppo­nents into mistakes. So in Thursday night's season opener against New Orleans, the Colts hope to do -­what else? --start fast. 
"I believe it's important because you can get out in front and force other teams to play perfect football to catch you," coach Tony Dungy said Monday. 
The evidence supports Dungy's theory. 
Since Dungy's arrival in 2002, no team has had more early-season success than the Colts, and no team has been to the playoffs more often. Over the last five Septembers, Indy has turned a league-best 14-2 record into five straight playoff appearances, four straight division titles, two AFC championship game appearances and a Super Bowl title. 
The Colts also are the only team in league history to go 9-0 in back­to-hack seasons. 
More impressive is that the Colts have gone 7-1 in season openers since 1999 despite playing on the road six times. The only loss came at New England in 2004 when Mike Vanderjagt missed a 48-yard field goal in the final minute, a score that could have forced over­time. 
Consider, too, that Indy has 14 active veterans who have never lost an NFL game in September or October. The impeccable stats also include only one pre-Thanksgiving Day loss in 2005 and 2006. 
What's their secret? 
"I think we're always really pre­pared and we usually have a sim­ple game plan," said starting line­backer Rob Morris, now in his eighth season with Indy. "We're not trying to do too many things and guys are ready to go, mentally and physically." 
Dungy believes the success has more to do with veteran leadership. While many offenses are still try­ing to refine timing early in tl1e sea­

son, the Colts, with Super Bowl MVP Peyton Manning and Pro Bowl receivers Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne, are already in sync. 
"Our offense usually comes out of the box functioning very well," Dungy said. "That's usually what takes time and we kind of hit the ground running." 
Or throwing, in the case of Manning. 
In his last 16 September games, the two-time league MVP has com­pleted at least 60 percent of his passes in 11 games and thrown 31 touchdowns versus 1 0 intercep­tions. That includes a six TO per­formance at New Orleans in 2003 and five more against Green Bay in his record-setting 2004 season. 
Yes, there has been the occasion­al stumble, such as an uninspiring 9-6 win at Oeveland in the 2003 opener, but the Colts have consis­tently figured out ways to win. 
"I think we practice well in camp and get a lot done," tight end Dallas Clark said. "I think our guys pre­pare well and the game plan usual­ly allows us to get in a groove early." 
Manning and his teammates can­not afford a lapse Thursday against a team they easily could have faced in last year's Super Bowl. 
New Orleans reached its first NFC championship game in January, and with a star-studded cast on offense has become a trendy pick to win this year's con­ference title. 
Most expect this game to be a shootout between the league's two best passing offenses of 2006. Manning, who is from New Orleans, was the AFC's Pro Bowl starter at quarterback last year, while New Orleans' Drew Brees, who played at Purdue about an hour north of Indianapolis, started for the NFC. 
Some have even billed it as a potential Super Bowl preview, something the Colts won't buy. 
The reality is that because the Saints and Colts play in opposite conferences, the game has more hype than impact. 
But that doesn't mean it won't set the tone for the rest of the season --something the Colts, as usual, want to establish quickly. 
"We like to start fast and make other teams chase you," Pro Bowl center Jeff Saturday said. "But the reality is it's only one of 16 games."

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Carr, Wolverines try to regroup after upset 
Associated Press 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. -Two days after enduring a loss that sent shock waves through the college football world, Michigan coach Lloyd Carr already has shifted his focus forward. 
He is doing so while much of the national attention remains centered on what lingering effects the Wolverines' historic 34-32 season-opening loss to Appalachian State will have on a team that started the season ranked fifth and a national championship contender. 
Carr said Monday that Michigan, which was penalized seven times and committed two costly turnovers against the Mountaineers, is starting from scratch heading into Saturday's game against Oregon. 
"What we have to do in a short time here is become a more disciplined team, a smarter team and a team that executes better," Carr said at his weekly news conference. 
Appalachian State's win at Michigan Stadium marked the first time a Football Championship Subdivision team -formerly I-AA-beat a team ranked in The Associated Press Top 25. 
"There were a lot of people on the team were really in a bad mood and a ·tot of people who took a lot of blame on them­selves," offensive lineman Adam Kraus said. "But we had a lot of missed opportunities in there, and it ended up really hurting us." 
The final blown chance came with Michigan in prime position to kick a game-winning field goal after Appalachian State had taken a two-point lead on Julian Rauch's 24-yard field· goal with 26 seconds remaining. 
Michigan set up for a 37 -yard field goal after Chad Henne con­nected with Mario Manningham on a 46-yard pass with six sec­onds remaining. But Jason Gingell's kick was blocked by Corey Lynch, clinching the Mountaineers' stunning upset. 
"With a chance to win the game, we didn't execute a fun­damental play -a play that we have worked extremely hard at all fall," Carr said. "That's the way it is." 
Gingell also had a 44-yard field goal attempt blocked with 
1:47 remaining with Michigan clinging to a 32-31 lead. Carr said he initially believed Gingell's kick was low, but that after watching game film, he blamed it on Michigan's protec­tion team. 
"You can't fault [Gingell] for those last two [blocked kicks]," Carr said. "He made two [field goals] and for a guy that has not been in games before, to go in there and kick two in a row in his first start is a very positive thing for him." 
Now Michigan is left to recov­er while preparing for an Oregon team that will present many of the same challenges, running the same spread offense the Wolverines struggled to defend against Appalachian State. 
But as tough as Saturday's loss was to swallow, it provided ward." 
Indianapolis Colts defensive back Marlin Jackson, a former Michigan standout, said he was embarrassed by the result. 
"We lost to a I-AA program, and we were a top-five team," he said. "To go out and be the first team in history to lose to a I-AA team, it hurts." 
Jackson said the loss has been an almost nonstop topic of con­versation for him. 
"That's all I've been getting the last couple of days. Every text message I get just says 'Appalachian State.' That's all it says," he said. 
"The Ohio State guys have been all right. It's everybody else around here. Even coach [Tony] Dungy said something to me about it."

These youngsters will be hero for the long haul, hut what Saturday showed is that they have a lot to learn. 
And Weis can teach it to them. He just needs to concen­trate on teaching and not out­rageous game plans that waste valuable learning time. 
The offensive line needs to be taught to make pre-snap reads, so they aren't flat-footed and getting pushed around when the ball is snapped -and also so defenders aren't running past them unmolested every play. 
They are behind in that task because they spent time on the spread option before Georgia Tech, but that should and will end now. And they will get bet­ter. 
What will also end now is the quarterback carousel. Weis is announcing or has already announced the starting quar­terback for Penn State today. That quarterback will be "the" guy and the coach can do what he does best-teach him the

The most important step in

"Both [seniors! are such

Of course, while all this learning is taking place, the team will still have to play games. While they may not win all of them, they won't look as bad as they did last Saturday. 
As the season rolls on, the team will get better and more confident. Thny will execute, and they will win. 
And eome next year and the year after, when the nucleus of this team returns, they will win even more.

But for now, consistency is the watch word. Install the basic offense and teach the team to run it well. 
Because while they're young, they're also talented -and they can do big things in their time at Notre Dame. 
So long as Weis and the fans have a little patience.

"We are positioning !Kurczak) on the right side to strengthen our blocking game,'' Sctiroeder-Biek said. "She did a great job out there this past weekend as both a blocker and an attacker." 

Taking Kurczak's place at starting middle hitter will be junior Kaela Hellmann.

FOOTBALL COMMENTARY Where do we go fro111 here? 
Weis' game plans needs consistency for Irish to be succesful 
Saturday was a disastnr. 
Saturday was the worst loss 
sineH Ty Willingham's inept 
2003 squad. 
Saturday 
was the 
worst horne 
opnnnr ever. 
And 
Saturday is 
over. 
Notre 
Dame eoad1 
Charlie 
Weis felt 
like he had 
to come up 
with a sur­
prise new 
ol'l'ensn to 
boat Coorgia Toch. lie knew lw 
had an inexperienced team ­
and in order to achieve his goal 
or winning every game, hn 
thought lw needed to broak out 
some new wrinkles to give the 
Irish a chance. 
In retrospect, that was a mis­take. But it ean still be correct­ed. 
No, Weis can't travel back in 
time and re-gameplan for the 
Yellow Jackets. But he can 
make up for lost time. 
This is a very young team. They wnrnn't going to unde­feated this snason -and they almost certainly anm't going to win out and go 12-1. They nnnd to learn and grow and the only way to do that is to have a consistent game plan every 
Weflk. 
Doing that may require patience. There may be ugly losses, but at least the team knows what it's going to do each week and can concentrate on improving that. 
If the Irish arc conlident in their game plan, they will exe­cutn bettor, which will lead to confidence in their abilities, which will lead to better results. 
It may take a while, but the steady improvement will be obvious, and it might even start against Penn State on Saturday. 
A few years back, when the Chicago Bulls wnrc trying to replaee Michael Jordan wilh a host of' young players. sports­writers dubbed them tho "Baby Bulls." 
Well, thnsn are thn Baby Irish. They aro trying to replace a legend of their own, and thny are nxtremely young. 
Notre Dame's leading rusher on Saturday was a sophomore quarterback. Demetrius Jonns. Its most ef'f'nctive tailback was a trun freshman, Armando Allen. Its leading reeeiver was a sophomorn, Hobby Parris. Thrnn of its of'f'nnsive limmwn worn making their first start­and one of thn other two was a
