Thousands of college students, some chanting "books not bombs," yesterday lobbied Congress against President Reagan's proposed cutbacks in federal grants and loans for educa­tion. The large turnout came amid mounting signs of resistance among both Republicans and Democrats to Reagan's call for cutting education aid from $13 billion to less than $10 billion in fiscal 1983. 
Many students arrived in buses chartered by their schools or student associations. "I'm very scared," said Fran Pheeny, 21, a New York University sophomore. "It does seem (Reagan) has lost some sup­port, but I'm still very scared." Nearly a dozen lawmakers delivered speeches ofsupport to more than 500 students who crammed into a room in a House office building. The so-called National Student Lob­by Day, organized by nine national student groups, was to end with a 
rally on the Capitol steps. Rep. Carl Perkins, D-Ky., chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, told the students: "we are going to prohibit any further cutbacks and we should commence to restore the cuts that have already been made.... We are going to 
prevail." -AP 

Pioneer 10,the first spacecraft to Jupiter, celebrates its lOth birthday today streaking through space 2.5 billion miles from the sun on a voyage out of the solar system. Despite bombardment by meteorites and a battle with Jupiter's s mighty radiation belt, Pioneer 10 continues to transmit data to Earth on the extent of of the sun's atmosphere. That excites experimenters such as Dr. james A. Van Allen of the University of Iowa, "because we think the sun is typical ofa majority ofthe stars in the universe. It's the only star we can measure from close up. "Finding the extent and exact mec­hanisms ofthe sun's atmosphere will tell us a great deal about the sun itself, about interstellar gas surrounding the solar system, and hence about stars in general." Since Pioneer 10 was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on March 2, 1972, it has traveled 
3.27 billion miles, received over 40,000 commands from Earth and sent more than 125 billion bits ofscientific data to waiting scientists. That data, transmitted by an 8-watt radio, now takes three hours and 42 minutes traveling at the speed oflight to return to the receiving station at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center south ofSan Francisco. -AP

student use. This was intended to provide more space for commuting students and students with off­campus jobs. 
Foldesi says this experiment has not worked because on-campus stu­dents simply park at LeMans to avoid walking from the McCandless lot. With student spaces all taken by resi­dent cars, commuters resort to parking in faculty and staff space, which results in a S5 ticket. 
The price of the ticket fines is not determined by security, but by the senior officers of the Board of Regents. The majority of the money colle<.'tl·d through violations goes toward parking lot maintenance. Saint Mary's Security issues an average of I0 to IS tickets a day, according to Tony Kovatch, Security 
Director. Another task of the security force 
is the escort system. Any student 
wishing an escort to her dorm can 
either call or stop at the Security 
Office. 
The formal policy ofsecurity only allows an escort for a single girl, al­though exceptions are made at the discretion of the security officer in­volved. The system is generally provided only for SMC students al­though infrequent runs are made to Notre Dame. No'tre Dame and Saint Mary'" security arc separate depart­ments although they remain in close contact. 
Kovatch says the escort system is used quite often. "The number varies. It averages about five to ten calls a night, and a bit heavier on weekends," he says. 
Security also is in charge of the booth at the entrance to the college. The booth is well-lit and a security guard, often aND student, is on duty there at night. The guard is usually there from 6 p.m. to midnight during

preters ofliterature, whose role and importance I do not mean to downplay. But we shall have the op­portunity to talk with approximately thirty writers themselves. It is al­most unnecessary to point out that simply to have so many writers meet together is unusual and perhaps remarkable in and ofitself. The topic is suggestive because its scope in­cludes both today and tomorrow while not at all excluding the weight and importance of the past, literature in the Spanish language up until now. Our group of writers will not only render homage to the past where it is due -one ofthe subtopics· is "Latin American and Spanish In­fluences on the New Generation of Narrators" -but probably of even greater importance they will be talking about what they are doing now and also where they are going in their literature. 
The forum could indeed represent a fine jumping-off point for many other projects among themselves and the people that we hope will be attending the sessions, which will be open to the public. This is the second time that this large group -for many of these writers have been together before 
(at Berkeley) -will have met in the United States, to discuss with anoth­er culture -because it is here that this is all taking place -their own literary possibilities. So the mag­nitude of it all must be measured variously: historically, culturally, so­cially, all which stems of course, from the literary aspect ofthe forum. Only time will tell, but I for one suspect that the Forum represents many positive avenues in the future. Perhaps the question can be better answered at a later date... 
Q: What wtll the authors do here? 
A: They have been asked to prepare short written presentations (ten to twelve minutes in length) corresponding to the particular theme of the tables in which they will be participants. Each one of them will give his or her own ideas on the various topics: 1)"New Models in the Hispanic Novel," 
2)"Latin American and Spanish In­fluences on the New Generation of Narrators," and 3 )"Unity and Diver­sity of Hispanic Literatures." Since each session will be held twice, once on Tues. and then on Wed.-we shall be hearing many different ap­proaches to a single subject, because the writers on Tues. will not be those talking on Wed.. Along with the writers there will be some fine 


...Q&A 
cnucs and professors serving as moderators, which is very important because it is they who will initiate the dialogue between the panelists and the audience. Again, I'm looking forward to a very lively and in­formative exchange of ideas be­tween all present. 

Q: How will the Forum affect Notre Dame financially? 
A: Notre Dame, of course, is the hosting institution for the event. The writers and moderators will be giving their presentations at the Center for Continuing Education. They will be staying at the Morris Inn, and several meals and social events have been planned for the participants themselves. Together with Notre Dame's financial and moral support, the Forum has been made possible by the generous cooperation ofseveral other institu· tions: the Office of Cultural Affairs (in the Ministry ofForeign Affairs) of Mexico, the National Institute of Fine Arts (Mexico), and the Institute of Ibero-American Cooperation 

(Spain). Again, I would like to repeat what I said earlier: many people, many talents have collaborated to make all ofthis possible. 
Q: Is there anyoneyou would ltke to acknowledge? 
A: The list is long, and I fear that to abbreviate might mean that my own oversight and limited part in this may result in the accidental exclu­sion of somebody along the line. Certainly, I feel that first and foremost the University of Notre Dame and the three other in­stituions mentioned above (from Mexico and Spain) deserve our thanks for making the Forum pos­sible. Fr. Hesburgh, Provost O'Meara, Dean Burns and Dr. Kon­rad Schaum have all helped im­mensely and in many ways. The writers themselves and the moderators who will be participat­
ing in the Forum have helped. Jim Powell, at the Center for Continuing Education, has been a blessing be­cause of his experience, patience, and kind cooperation in working out many of the logistics involved. Beyond these individuals, I most certainly want to express my gratitude and appreetauon for anybody else, the students, you, etc., whose interest and aid are helping to insure the success of this, the first "International Forum of Hispanic 
Writers" at Notre Dame.

Cooperative  Department  of  

Communication and Theatre Chairman Mitchell Lifton, will be shown for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's faculty, students and ad­ministration tomorrow at 4 p.m. in the Annenberg Auditorium. 
The film follows the complete installation of the eight and one­half ton, 32-foot-high abstract ex­pressional sculpture erected on a river pedestal in the Saint Joseph 
·River in 1980 near South Bend's Century Center. The city's fire department, television crews, a construction crane and experts in areas from paints to concrete, as well as hundreds ofbystanders witnessed the installaion, which included the artist himselfclimb­ing atop the orange and silver piece for final welding. 
The film includes periodic recorded comments from passersby and onlookers, as well as dialogue from workmen who wore wireless microphones.

Economic upturn? 
Experts predict summer recovery 
By Robert Furlow 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON (AP) The broadest gauge ofthe nation's future economic health fell for the ninth straight month in January, indicat· lng, in the words of Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, "that tht· recession has yet to run its course." 
However, Baldrige and several 
private economists said Monday that 
recovery could still arrive by late 
spring or early summer, especially if 
interest rates continue their recent 
decline. 
The Commerce Department's In· 
dex of Leading Indicators dropped 
0.6 percent in January and would have fallen nearly five times as much if officials had not deleted effects ofa sharply reduced average workweek, a figure they said was distorted by severe weather. 
But Baldrige noted that January's announced decline and the 0.3 per· cent drops of November and December -were much smaller than those of last autumn. And he said, "The fact that the indicators were on the minus side in January is not Inconsistent with forecasts of a second quarter recovery in· the economy." 
Alan Greenspan, an outside economic adviser to the administra­tion, said he believes the recovery will begin soon, but conceded there are no signs of it yet. 
"Thus, while the evidence the rate ofdecline is slowing and, in fact, we may have hit bottom , indications of an upturn arc scant at best," Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee. 
Recovery toward the end of the April-June quarter "is still pos­sible," said Donald Straszheim , vice president of Wharton Econometrics in Philadelphia. "Mid-year is a reasonable kind of assumption for a turnaround." 
And Sandra Shaber, director of consumer economics for Chase Econometrics in BaJa Cynwyd, Pa., said, "If the economy hasn't hit bot· tom yet, we're close." 
Neither private analyst had any­thing good to say about a recent spate of articles raising the pos· sibility that the current recession will deepen into a full-scale depression rather than beginning at least modest recovery. 
Ms. Shaber said she feels there is "an undue amount of pessimism" about the economy. And Straszheim said, "I don't believe at all this depression kind of talk." 

"The economy is very weak," he said, predicting that "the second quarter is not going to be all that far from zero," whether slightly up or down, measuring by inflation­adjusted gross national product. 
But both pointed to positive cur· rent and future factors such as manufacturers' efforts to cut down inventories of unsold goods, a big tax cut scheduled for July, a sig· nificant decline in inflation and at least the beginnings of a decline in interest rates. 
The leading indicators index, which is designed to forecast future trends in the economy, began drop­ping last May, two or three month before what most economists believe was the start ofthe recession in late summer. 
Economic Update 
The first SaleS gain since September has been reported by the Big Three auto manufacturers. The gain was a mere 
1.9 percent for the first ten days of February. Together, the Chrysler Corporation, the Ford Motor ~ompany and the General Motors Cor­poration sold 162,505 cars in the most recent period, up from 159,515 in the comparable 1981 period. Chrysler was the only domestic auto maker to have a sales decline in the period, which had nine selling days both this year and last. -AP 
The Soviet Union has bought an additional 2oo,ooo metric tons of American corn, or nearly 7.9 million bushels, for delivery through Sept. 30, the Agriculture Department said last week. Officials said the latest sale raised to almost 12.1 million tons the amount ofgrain·· 5.9 million wheat and 6.2 million corn--that the Soviet Union has bought for delivery in 1981·82, the sixth year of a grain agreement with the United States.-AP 

Marketing Update 
Airfares to Europeare subject to increases approved by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority. The increases approved range from 15 to 20 percent. An agency spokesman said an additional in· crease averaging 8 percent would take effect May 1. The increase means that the cost ofa one-way econ~my fare between London and New York will be the equivalent of ~63 on Pan American World Airways, Trans World Airlines, British Airways and British Caledonian Airways. On May I, fares will rise to the equivalent of S285.-AP

No. Iowa bounds into ACC 

By CHRIS NEEDLES 
Associate Sports Editor 
Only Chicago Cub fans can truly understand the plight of Digger Phelps and the Notre Dame basket­ball team at this point ofthe season. 
At 8-16 and going nowhere but home for Spring Break, the Irish are, as the saying goes, "playing out the string." It is an unfamiliar position for ND, especially after eight con­secutive NCAA Tournament ap­pearances. 
But life goes on, and tonight Northern Iowa pays a visit to the ACC (8:05 tipoff) to cjose out Notre Dame's worst home basketball season in ten years. The Irish are cur­rently 7-8 at home this year, and 
need a win tonight to avoid their first losing season at the ACC since

• I971-72. It will be the first meeting ever between the two schools. 
The Panthers currently stand at 12-13, which is pretty good considering that they have been in Division One for only two years. But only six oftheir victories have come 

Cheaters won't violate Notre Dame 

It's scheduling time again for Digger Phelps and Gene Corrigan. While the season is not yet over, it's already time to make arrangements as to who the Irish will play and when in the year ahead. 
"It's not easy," says Notre Dame's athletic director. "Schools don't want to play you during their con­ference schedule, which is January and February. Who does that leave you to play? Which independents should you play? And how do you fit all those con­ference teams into the time you have left?" 
But that may not be the biggest problem facing the two men as they go over prospective opponents. In December, Fr. Hesburgh made it clear that Notre Dame was giving serious consideration to a school's in­

I 
tegrity before putting it on the schedule. "Allegations of cheating ... are fairly widespread,"

f 
Hesburgh told those gathered for the annual football banquet. "Notre Dame might, by example and leader­f ship, help to rid intercollegiate athletics of the plague
I that presently blights it. "We should compete with schools that share this 
~ 
ideal, and not with those who do not." But what about UCLA? For that matter, what about San Francisco, a team that just last season came off NCAA probation? Should Notre Dame discontinue those traditional rivalries? "What it comes down to," Corrigan says, "is a matter 
'I 
I of mutual respect. If Digger respects the coach, and knows that he's doing his best to clean up a program, or keep one clean, then we have no problems. If I have respect for the athletic director, and know that he's above-board, we're OK." Obviously, Notre Dame is not going to rush out to schedule Wichita State, a team the NCAA has again cited for repeated violations. But who stays on the schedule and who goes? "The UCLA situation is this," Phelps says. "If they clean it up, we'll play them. We'll talk to their athletic director and find out what they're doing. If they don't clean up their act -then fine, we don't have to play them. "But the UCLA rivalry has been good for Notre Dame." Corrigan discusses the UCLA issue with a hint ofcau­tion as well. "I don't know what they've done," he says.
• 
"I guess every school, somewhere in its history, has a Sam Gilbert. Who are we to judge? 
"I asked Digger about Larry Farmer, and we talked about the whole situation. He's satisfied that what went on there was in the past, and we're going to leave it at that." 
Corrigan admits that there is discussion of dropping the home-and-home arrangement with the Bruins, but he stresses that there are a variety of reasons for that. The cost of traveling to Los Angeles every year, as well as diminished TV ratings, are key factors. 
San Francisco has been dropped from the Irish schedule. But Phelps says there are reasons other than the Dons' probation behind that move. 

"Those were Mike Mitchell's games," he says. "He's from that area, and I try to play games in every player's home town. Next year we're working on a game with .. Pitt for Bill Varner. I want to try to get Washington on the schedule for (incoming freshman) Joe Buchanan. 
, To do that, we had to make room on the schedule, and 

San Francisco went." 
Another tender area for the two men is Kentucky. 
Cliff Hagan, the athletic director at the University of 
Kentucky, recently said he was "appalled" at the 
thought that Notre Dame was dropping the Wildcats 
from its basketball schedule because ofalledged cheat­
ing. 
In a letter sent to Corrigan on February 18, and ob­
tained by The Observer this week, Hagan asked for an 
explanation from Corrigan as to Notre Dame's position 
on scheduling Kentucky in the future. 
The controversy stems from an article in a Rochester, 
N.Y. newspaper in which Corrigan was quoted as saying that Notre Dame will drop from its schedule teams it knows cheat. 
"I talked to Cliff," Corrigan says, "and I explained to 
him that we were dropping them because they 
wouldn't play home-and-home with us. We've never· 
had a real good relationship with Kentucky." 
Phelps says the matter is simple. "Joe B. Hall does not 
want to play in South Bend. I'd be glad to play Kentucky 
in Lexingon, and in South Bend. But they won't play us 
home-and-home." 
Corrigan says there's no set policy toward schedul­
ing, but there is when Notre Dame has intormation that 
a team is cheating. 
"Digger has come to me and told me that he knows one thing or another, and I always tell him to confront the coach," he says. "Ifsomething comes to the atten­tion ofone of our coaches, I tell them to call the other coach and tell them we know. The idea is to talk to them and find out just what's going on. 
"We're in a position to do something after we talk it 
over. We report them to the NCAA if we feel that's jus­
tified, and we don't play them." 
It has happened before, Phelps admits. 
"In the past, if I've heard of situations, I have called 
Billy Hunt at the NCAA and told him of the situations, 
and to have him look into it. 
"Ifeverybody did that, it would help the whole situa: 
tion around the country. When you start doing that, 
things will improve a great deal." 
There are many factors in choosing opponents and scheduling games. Travel costs, players' classes, revenue from various arenas and players' hometowns all play a part. Now, Phelps and Corrigan must consider another factor. In the face ofgrowing corruption in the game, the two must protect Notre Dame. 
"Who are we to judge?" Corrigan asks. But as he also 
says, "Integrity is non-negotiable here." Where there is 
question, Phelps, Corrigan and Notre Dame must move 
cautiously. 
against Division One competition, with two of those coming against Valparaiso. 
"We've been more aware of what we have been facing this year," says UNI Head Coach Jim Berry, in his ninth season at the helm. "Some of the surprises and newness of last year haven't been as much ofafactor this season. Also, we purposely made our schedule more realistic, and that has helped." 
The Panthers struggled to an 8-19 finish last season, so Berry stocked this year's schedule full ofteams like Winona State, Luther College, and Valparaiso. So, despite losing four starters from last season, this year's record is remarkably better. 
But whenever the Panthers have 
tested their luck against the big 
boys, they've come up far short ­
losing by 36 points to Kansas State 
and by 31 to Iowa. 
Obviously, UNI's basketball 
program, though still in its infancy, is 
on the rise towards first-class status. 
Besides jumping to Division One, 
the Panthers also are proud owners 
ofa top-notch athletic facility -the 
UNI-Dome, one of the Midwest's 
finest arenas. 
Unfortunately, the highlight of this season for UNI fans was in '\lovember, when the Rolling Stones appeared in the UNI-Dome. Mick 
Jagger is a tough act to follow, but 
UNI has responded to post a respect­
able 11-3 record at home this year. 
The Panthers are led by 6-11 
junior center Ray Storck (Marengo, 
Ia. ), who averages about 12 points a 
game. A pair of sophomores, 6-7 
Mike Pijanowski (Elgin, Ill.) and 6-8 
Herbert King (Waterloo, Ia.), man 
the forward spots, but they average 
just 12 points agame between them. 
5-9 junior Brent Carmichael (East Moline, Ill.) is the shooting guard who is averaging about I I points a game, but is shooting a mediocre 4I percent from the floor. 6-6 sopho­more John Block (Ankeny, Ia.) is the team's leading rebounder at six per contest and mans the other starting guard position. 
Northern Iowa also receives bench help from two former South Bend Adams standouts, Dwayne "Chicken" Jackson and Kevin Brad­ford. 
Now, if tonight's matchup conjers up memories of a Cubs-Mets battle for last place in mid-September, don't fret. For some, tonight's game holds much meaning. 
For example, for seniors Mike Mitchell, Gary Grassey and Marc Kelly, tonight will be their final ACC appearance in an Irish uniform, and each will be looking to go out on a winning note. 
Also, for Digger Phelps, the game will be one of those "tests ofcharac­ter," as the Irish coach will be close­ly examining which of his players, if any,havethrowninthetowelforthe season. 
And, for John Paxson, the game should provide an opportunity to pad a deceivingly-low scoring average, which now stands at 15 points a game. The 6-2 junior guard is coming off a 23-point perfor­mance, despite 8-for-2I shooting, against DePaul on Sunday. 
IRISH ITEMS: A few tickets still remain for tonight's season finale. They are priced at $4.50 ...The Irish close out the season this weekend with games at Dayton on Saturday and Michigan on Sunday..Tickets tbr the basketball banquet, to be held on Monday, March 8, can be reserved through the Notre Dame Ticket Office. They are priced at S 16. 50. 
Holy Cross 1Hogs' wallow as champs

MEN'S BASKETBALL -Holy Cross claimed the championship game of the A division this past Sunday by defeating Grace, 46-40. John L. Schaeffer led all scorers with 25, including I1 of I2 from the free-throw line. With key substitutions, the "Hogs" kept fresh players on the court, totally dominating in rebounding. Holy Cross, which led by as much as 1I in the second period, posted a 22-14 half-time lead. In the fourth period Grace made a run at the Hogs, closing the gap to five points with two minutes remaining, but a three-point play by Tony Anderson iced it for the champion Holy CrossHogs. · 
In the B division finals, also played Sunday night, Grace edged 
Keenan, 46,45, as the game went to a sudden death decision after 
two overtime periods. Bill McGrath had 1 5 points for Grace, which 
was down by I2 at one time, but rallied to tie the score by the end of 
regulation play. In sudden death play, Chris Stone was fouled driving 
to the basket, but failed to convert at the free-throw line. Moments 
later, however, he was given a chance to redeem himself as he was 
fouled again. Stone made good on the pressure bucket, sending the 
series to one final game in the double-elimination tournament. 
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL -Pasquerilla East pulled the plug on any hopes ofa playoff spot for Off-Campus by beating them this past w~kend, 29-IS. The "Pac East" ended their regular season record at 9-2, and will face Walsh tomorrow night in the pit at 7 p.m. in the second oftwo semi-final games. 
HOCKEY -An injury-riddled Off-Campus team downed Stanford last week, 3-1. With two cracked ribs, Tony Aiello scored two goals for the offense as Frank Schornagle, with a sprained ankle, held Stan­ford to a single goal for the defense. The bumps and bruises that the third ranked Crime have sustained have coach, Ed McNally con­cerned, and rightfully so, for they have top-ranked Holy Cross yet to play and the playoffs are right around the corner.
