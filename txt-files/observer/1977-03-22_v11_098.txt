Under Mansfield, the strangle­hold of the filibuster was broken, the majority leader's front-row desk was often given over to a committee chairman who wanted to steer a bill through floor debate, and younger members were en­couraged to sponsor innovative legislation. As one editorial writer commented, "Senator Mansfield's contribution was to welcome change and gently hurry it along." 
An early critic of Vietnam, Mansfield could not prevent deep­ening American involvement, but he helped build Congressional opposition to the war. He once told reporters he was proudest of the passage ofthe 18-year-old vote and of his role in the formation of Senate committees to investigate Watergate and the Central Intelli­gence Agency. 
Mansfield is only the third Laetare Medal recipient to have served in the House or Senate. Clare Booth Luce, who received the award in 1957, was a former congresswoman, and President John F.Kennedy, honored in 1961, had, like Mansfield, served both the House and Senate.

Brezhnev: Human rights issue· hurts American-Soviet relations 
MOSCOW [AP] -Soviet leader 'Leonid I. Brezhnev said yesterday that progress in relations with the United States was "unthinkable" as long as Washington criticizes human rights conditions in the Soviet Union. 
"Washington's claims, to teach others how to live, I believe, cannot be accepted by any sovereign state," Brezhnev said in a speech. 
The Soviet leader outlined a new Mideast proposal but suggested progress there and elsewhere could ' bog down because of the contro­versy over dissidents. 
His Mideast ·proposal included demilitarized zones "on both sides of the established borders," sta­tioning United Nations troops or 
Welding accident touches off 
tanker explosion 
CAMP LEJEUNE N.C. (APJ ­Survivors of the shattered Pana­manian oil tanker Claude Conway said yesterday that a welding mishap blew the 43,000 ton vessel apart, killing the captain, the radio operator and eight other crew members. 
The U.S. Coast Guard said 28 crew members were rescued and eleven remained missing as search and rescue operations continued at the site, 120 miles southeast of this Marine base. 
No bodies were found by late afternoon, and there were no confirmed deaths. 
However, several of 18 injured survivors who were airlifted to a ' Navy hospital at this coastal U.S. Marine base said an explosion and fire ripped through the ship about 9 
a.m. Sunday, killing several of their shipmates instantly -includ­ing the radio operator. 
However, the first "May Day" was not sounded until a second vessel spotted the ship early yes­terday.

boundaries -a greater concession 
of land than Israel has given any ·sign of apporving. Speaking five days before the 
arrival of U.S. Secretary of State 
Cyrus R. Vance, Brezhnev sug­
gested that American criticism was 
stalling otherwise "quite attain­
able" progress toward arms con­
trols and improved economic ties as 
well. 

Brezhnev said he wanted Amer­
ican-Soviet relations to be ''good, 
neighborly ones." 

"But -this requires a definite level of mutual understanding and at least a minimum of tact,'' he added. 
The Soviet leader said his Mid­east proposal called for guarantees of unrestricted shipping by Israel and other nations through the Suez . Canal and waters of either side of the Sinai peninsula once the state of war in the area is ended. 
"It goes without saying' that the rights of the Palestinian people should be insured, including their right to self-determination, to the creation of their own state," he said.

Brezhnev implied progress in areas of mutual interest could be stalled by what he defined as "outright attempts by official Am­erican bodies to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet U­nion." 
In his first public statement on the human rights issue since President Carter took office, Brezh nev said, "We will not tolerate interference in our internal affairs by anyone under any pretext. A normal development of relations on such a basis is of course unthink­able." 
The Carter administration has stressed its commitment to protec­tion of human rights in foreign countries Carter responded per­sonally to a letter from dissident Andrei D. Sakharov and met with exile dissident Vladimir Bukovsky at the White House. 
Brezhnev implied Western pow­ers were behind the recent assass­inations of Congolese President Marian Ngouabi and Lebanese leftist leader Kamal Jumblatt last week. The assassinations, he said, were the "latest example" of attempts by the West ''to disrupt the constructive international di­alogue."

Cavity preventative found in saliva fSign up at Cgmpus Ministry_Office, 103 LibrorA 
STONYBROOK, N.Y. [AP] -A dental researcher said here yester­day he has isolated a substance in. saliva that protects teeth against the formation of cavities. 
The discovery by Dr. Israel Kleinberg suggests a new and natural approach to the control and prevention of cavities "might be within reach," said an announce­ment from the State University of New York. 
The substance has been named Sialin. It is a peptide, a small molecule containing amino acids, the basic material of life. 
"The approach is quite simple," Kleinberg said, "and, if correct, it raises the interesting possibility that the use of Sialin and fluoride might result in caries cavities becoming a minor disease." 
Kleinberg and his coworkers have synthesized the substance in the laboratory so it can be com­mercially produced. 
''We now have to find the most appropriate vehicle for raising the level of Sialin in the saliva,'' the researcher said. "The possibilities include a rinse, chewing gum, toothpaste or candies since Silalin takes care of the sugar porblem." 
Clinical trials to prove safety and effectiveness would require about five years, Kleinberg said, al­though the anti-acid properties of the substance could be proved 
sooner. Kleinberg's work was reported to a closed workshop on the microbial aspects of dental cavities 
held last June by the National Institute of Dental Research and ws published in Microbioloby Ab­stracts. 
The major factor in tooth decay is plaque -bacterial deposits that continually form on teeth and act on sugar and certain carbohydrates to make acid. The acid eats away at tooth enamel. 
!'Basically, Sialin is a small molecule called a peptide compri­
sed of only a few amino acids," Kleinberg said. "It is a component of saliva that counteracts the acid produced by the bacteria in the mouth, the culprit in tooth decay." 
The substance is the .body's mechanism to protect the teeth, but Kieinberg said it is overwhelmed by an excess of sugar in the diet. 
"Researchers have known for a long time that something in saliva gives protection against caries,'' he said. "our research was methodical and progressive. We developed disease. 
Kleinberg, chairman of the de­partment of oral biology and path­ology at the School of Dental Medicine, said the peptide acts by entering the bacterial cells where 
. at least one of its amino acids works to divert the plaque acid into other substances and produces a base, which counteracts the acid.

Mock Stock Market now open for business 
by Kathleen ConneUy 

The Mock Stock Market opened for business at 10 a.m. yesterday in the lobby of the Business Admin­istration building. 
Now in its fifth year, the Mock 
Stock Market offers any student the 
~pportunity to get the feel of the market without the financial risks. 
In this simulation game a student 
may buy one account valued at $10,000 for one dollar, or three accounts, also worth $10,000 each, for two dollars. The student may purchase stock from the New York or the American exchanges. 
Since there are no counselors or brokers provided in the transaction center, Co-chairman Dan Bishop suggests the investor buy a Wall Street Journal to study trends and current prices on the exchange. 


Gains and losses are determined by the behavior of the exchange in New York. Stock market figures are t'eceived daily from a teletype Business Administration building. the trustees. The members invest

Law students to argue case before US Supreme court 
A rare opportunity to argue a 
case before the United States 
Supreme Court has been given to 
law students and faculty invoived 
in Notre Dame's Appellate Advo­
cacy Program. The case to be 
argued involves a 1974 theft charge 
in Fort Wayne. 
One of only a few schools in the 
nation permitting students to do 
clinical work at the appellate level, 
Notre Dame students prepare 
written briefs and argue the oral 
appeals before the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 
Chicago. The program was estab­
lished in 1972 and is under the 
direction of Law Professors Joseph 
P. Bauer and Charles Crutchfield. When a conviction in the current 
,case was upheld by the Seventh Circuit, Notre Dame counselors filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court on behalf of their client. Although records indicate that fewer than one percent of these petitions are granted, the nation's highest court agreed further consideration was warranted in this case. 
The case involved a client who was brought to trial on a theft charge but because of a defect in the charging information, the first trial was terminated immediately prior to the verdict stage. The client was then indicted, tried for a second time, and convicted. The David T. Link, dean of the Notre 
court-appointed counselors said the Dame Law School, described the second trial constituted double unique appellate program as evi­jeopardy and violated his rights dence of the University's effort to under the Fifth Amendment. provide the most complete exper­

Marijuana does not harm brain 
CHICAGO [AP] -Heavy mari­juana smoking does not, as has previously been reported, produce structural changes in the brain or central nervous system, two separ­ate research studies have found. 
The March 21 issue of the 
Journal of the American Medical 
Association carries the two new 
reports, which are at odds with one 
published in 1971 in Lancet, a 
British medical journal. 

In the earlier study, researchers found evidence of atrophy, or wasting away,, of a portion of the brain of ten young men who were heavy marijuana users. 
That study, conducted by Dr. 
A. M. G. Campbell of Bristol Royal United Hospitals in Great Britain and his colleagues, was done with an X-ray technique involving injec­tion of air or gas to examine portions of the brain. 
The new studies involved a recently developed X-ray technique called computerized transaxial to­mography, in which the head is scanned by a bean of X-rays and no injection is required. 
One was conducted by Dr. Ben 
T. Co of the Washington University school of medicine, St. Louis, and Dr. Donald W. Goodwin of the University of Kansas school of medicine, Kansas City, Kan., and their colleagues. 
The other was carried out by a team of Harvard medical school researchers headed by Dr. John Kuehnle. 
In the first of the two studies, 12 young men who had smoked five or more marijuana cigarettes a day for at,Ieast five years were examined. 
In the Harvard study, 19 male heavy marijuana smokers from middle-to-upper-class socioecon­omic backgrounds were studied. They were kept in a hospital research ward so their behavior could be closely watched. They smoked five or more marujuana cigarettes obtained from federal sources daily for 21 days. 
Co and Goodwin said that "the only prudent conclusion to draw" from their study is that "young men with extensive exposure to cannabis marijuana over a number of years do not necessarily show evidence of cerebral atrophy." 
Both they and the Harvard group said it was possible that the marijuana smoked by the group in the 1971 study was not the same and may have been accounted for part of the difference in results. 
They also pointed out that the group in the 1971 study suffered fro~ nerve dama~e or impairment of their ability to function intellec­tually. 
The Harvard researchers said their subjects "May be more representative of the general pop­ulation of the heavy marijuana users" than those examined by Campbell. 
And they, too, said their study failed to demonstrate structut·al changes in the central nervous system of men who smoke mari­juana regularly and in rather heavy doses.

,Fencers c_l~im Great Lakes Tourney 
by Paul Stevenson Sports Editor 
Notre Dame played host for the eleventh annual Great Lakes Fen­cing Tournament on March 11 and 12, and for the third consecutive year, the Irish fencers emerged victorious over 15 other competing schools. 
The Fighting Irish tallied 165 points while Wayne State, who finished second, chalked up 149 markers. Wisconsin-Parkside, Michigan-Dearborn and Case Wes­tern Reserve followed with 82, 68 and 67 points respectively to round out the top five. 
For the first time in Notre Dame history there was a repeat gold medal winner from last year's tournament. Tim Glass, the Irish epee captain, placed first against a strong epee pool. Glass def~ted Pete Rozsa of Oeveland State and Dave Bauman of Wisconsin-Park­side, his two nearest competitors, en route to his first place finish. Notre Dame teammate Ed Fellows ranked fifth at the conclusion of the epee competition. 
In sabre, Mike Sullivan attempt-e<!_ to repeat his golil 111~d~ pertormance from the1976 tourn­ed this year's top sabre honors. Sullivan followed Rabinovitch in second and Tim Mulligan finiShea . sixth for Notre Dame. 
Notre Dame's Pat Gerard fenced superbly to capture the top position in men's foil. The Irish foil specialist fought past rigid compe­tition by Carl Klutke and Paul Avsharian of Wayne State. Foil Captain Terry McConville aided the Irish with a fourth place finish in foil. 
The biggest surprise of the tournament was the performance of the women fencers. Wayne ·state, who was favored to win the women's field, was dethrowned by Notre Dame. Pacing the Irish attack were Kathy Valdiserri and Chris Marciniak who combined led Notre Dame into the finals. 
Valdiserri lost a fence off against Theresa Swenson of Wisconsin­Parkside to claim second place in women's foil. Marciniak captured fifth position to assist the Irish in winning the women's team title.
