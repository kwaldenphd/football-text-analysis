NBC to host Green Week battle for last ho111e ga111e 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 
Notre Dame Stadium is not the only place that the Irish will have a chance to defeat Syracuse next week, as students, alumni and fans will be playing an important role in NBC Universal's Green Week. 
"NBC had their first Green Week last year, but they've never col­laborated with Notre Dame before," president of GreeNO Lourdes Long said. "We have a close corporate relationship with them, so they have invited us to play a role this year." 
NBC challenged both Notre Dame and Syracuse to get as many people as possible to join their Carbon Rally teams. 
"You basically sign up and you can elect to take personal chal­lnnges," Long said. 
Challenges may include making sure tires are properly inflated and driving more "delicately," without pushing the gas pedal more than necessary, Long said. The sehool that gets the greatest number of people to join its team wins $10,000, Long said. 
Studnnts. alumni and fans can all join Notre Dame's Carbon Hally team. Long said. 
"Everyone can go to the Office of Sustainability Web site and join the Irish team there," Long said. 
NBC will also be sponsoring an ad competition between Notre Dame and Syracuse. Students from both schools can create 30­second films about sustainability

With the stock market down, college affordability has become a significant issue for families across the country. Recent articles in national newspapers like The New York Times have examined the state of financial aid and the feasi­bility of a need-blind admis­sions process in today's econo­my. 
The University of Notre Dame will remain committed to two of its admissions' goals -accessibility and affordabili­ty -and will respond to the economic crisis facing the United States in "typical Notre Dame fashion," Joseph Russo, Director of Student Financial Strategies in the Office of Student Financial Services told The Observer. 
"We're staying steady, focused in a positive direction ... we're typically very deliber­ate and pretty conservative," he said. "In terms of our finances, we're one of the most stable institutions in higher education." 
Russo said he agrees with representatives from other col­leges and universities who say college affordability is becom­ing a concern.

University alUITIS participate inACE program 
Students forgo job opportunities in order to give back to community through teaching 
By HONORA KENNEY News Writer 
Acting on the University's core values of faith, service and education, some recent graduates are choosing to postpone their job search in order to participate in Notre Dame's Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE) program. 
Brendan Ryan, who gradu­ated from Notre Dame last year with an engineering degree, is currently teaching Algebra I and Geometry at Holy Family Cristo Rey High School in Birmingham, Ala. 
"I have been fortunate to go to Catholic schools my whole life," Ryan said. "When I got to college, I finally understood what a huge blessing and opportunity these schools have been in my life. 
Ryan said his parents served as his example when deciding to participate in ACE. 
"I know my parents made huge sacrifices to put every­one in my family through Catholic schools, so I felt that this was an opportunity for me to give this chance to someone else," he said.

Despite Notre Dame's shutout loss to Boston College last Saturday, stu­dents are excited for the matchup with Navy Saturday. The Midshipmen come into the game fresh from a bye week. 
Sophomore Katrina Corcoran, whose brother is a senior at the Naval Academy, will be attending Saturday's game. Corcoran said she believes the Irish will be able to win on Saturday. 
"I believe the talent of our team will come together as one to defeat the Midshipmen," Corcoran said. "If we don't win, I'll be hearing about it for a long time." 
Some students said the game against Navy will be a chance for the Irish to rebound from their recent losing streak. 
"I think this is the week we finally get back on track," junior Sara Seidler said. 
Students said the team might have added incentive to defeat Navy this week­end, since a win will give Notre Dame bowl eligibility.

INSIDE COLUMN 


On Phillies and Phan1ily 
It's bnnn over two weeks since the ''hiladelphia Phillies clinched the rleeisive ganw 5 of the 2008 World Snries, to win the team's first champi­onship sinee 1980. 
It's been an eventful two weeks, dur­
ing which we elected a new president and saw gas prices fall dramatically. (I saw gas at $1.87 at the Marathon by the Toll Hoad the other night ... crazy.) 

John Tierney 
News Writer 
But if you can remember back two 
weeks ago, the World Series was pret­
ty eventful itself. The inclement 
weather that postponed game 5 in the 
sixth inning for two days led many 
pundits to call 2008's Fall Classic the 
most disastrous in memory. 

The 2008 World Series may have 
been messy, gross, and somewhat 
antielimaetic, but led to great joy for 
the winning side. 

The Phillies' victory was especially 
joyful for a cf~rtain 85-year-old lady of 
JefTI~rsonville, Pa., who just got cable 
this year so she would be able to 
watch all 1(J2 games. This certain lady 
would be my grandmom, Mrs. Bita M. 
Tierney, formerly of Conshohoeken. 
Crandmorn Tinrney had talked about upgrading lwr cabin package to get all the Phils' games pretty much for as long as I ean rpnwmb1~r. But she never did it. 
But this year. she finally decided to 
make thn switch. And boy, was she 
glad she did. 

Crandrnom Tierney got so into her 
!'hils this summer. One day, I was 
talking to her and she said that she 
was almost embarrassed by her pas­
sion for baseball. "I should be too old 
to care who's in first place, but darn 
it, I do," she said. 

Crandmorn Tierney has experienced 
a lot of the less than pleasant sides of 
being old-she takes more medica­
tions in one day than an entire sum­
mer camp of middle schoolers takes in 
a week. 

(That's a legit fact. I worked at a 
summer camp and saw how many 
meds we were responsible for in a 
week, and I also stayed with 
Grandmom for a weekend. She wins 
that contest in a runaway.) 

But the Phillies helped give Grandmom a chance to experience one of the best parts of being old. "Being old isn't all bad," she told me. "I get to annoy people and watch the ballgames." 
On the night of Oct. 29, Grandmom 
gathered all five of her kids in her 
apartment in building number three of 
the "Green at Westover" eomplex, and 
they watched the Phils, the losingest 
team in sports history, become world 
champions. 

I grew up in Phoenix and I'm a 
Diamondbacks fan. But nothing in 
baseball could have made me happier 
this year than to see the Phillies win it 
all. 

The victory isn't going to change the 
nation, but it did spread joy in the 
Tierney family. And really, what more 
can I ask for?

SMC sends letters to soldiers in Iraq 
By ALICIA SMITH News Writer 
In a way to show support for the men and women currently stationed overseas, the Saint Mary's College Office of Civil and Social Engagement spon­sored a letter writing cam­paign for the troops in Afghanistan this past week. 
"We are writing letters of appreciation for our troops are over in Afghanistan," Saint 
Mary's senior Erin Seidelman said. "I started by just asking a few people I knew on cam­pus to write let­ters, but there seemed to be a lot of interest so it grew into a Campus wide event thanks to Carrie Call, the director of the Office of Civil and Social Engagement at Saint Mary's." 
Students were prompted to write a letter of any length with words of encouragement, prayers or gratitude. Letters were for both men and women, and could include quotes or images. Cards will be sent in time for the holi­days. 
"The goal is to send some love from home to our troops that work so hard to keep us safe," Seidelman said. "My cousin is currently fighting over in Afghanistan, and I thought it would be nice to send him and the troops he works with letters." 

Letters have been collected at the front desks in all of the College's residence halls, as well as at the welcome desk in Saint Mary's student center. 
Call said the campaign would help students and faculty con­nect with family members who are currently stationed in Afghanistan.

However, Call said the ulti­mate goal of the letters is sim­ply to provide support to the troops. 
"I hope to achieve some corn­fort for those who are far from home, and allow our students to express their support and gratitude to some folks that they don't even know," Call said. 
Letters are due today.

They also received some money from the Center for Social Concerns, and the class members asked their dorms to donate an item to go into the packages. 

"We knew of the President's Circle and Learning Beyond the Classroom so we wrote proposals to both of those about how doing the service project is a learning project for us," she said. 
While tlie event offers the opportunity to give back to the community, it also allows the class to experience the real life context of their studies in the classroom, LeFevour said.

lluman Hights at the Univnrsidad Central de Chile, investigated potential human rights violations by Pinochet's regime and spoke nxtnnsively with torture sur­vivors. 
"I don't rnmembcr one that didn't ery. Everyonn cried. And I cried with them," (;uzrmin said. 
(;uznuin began his lecture with a dnscription of thn coup Pinochet staged on Sept. 11, 1973. 
"La Moncda, our Whit!1 llouse, was bombnd thnatri­cally," Guzm;in said. "The president was killed. Pinodwt gave the order to have him killed." 
(;uzman also described the consequences of the coup, which he described as "human sacrifices." According to offieial ligures, over 3.000 people were assassinated, over 1,200 ptlo­ple arn still missing and over 2,500 people were exiled. Guzman said the actual num­bers, however, are much higher than the numbers given. 
The methods of torture were particularly gruesome, Guzman said. People were tracked down, shoved into unmarked cars and taken to concealed prisons. 
"They were tortured in the most terrible forms," he said. 
Guzman also said water torture, sexual abuse, asphyxiation and electric shocks, among other meth­ods, were used to torture prisoners. The tortured men and women were always naked. 
"When I asked the people who survived what was the worst thing for them, they said the worst thing was to be naknd in front of so many people," he said. "Being naked was the ultimate humiliation." 

After the end of Pinochet's regime, impunity ran ram­pant through Chile. An amnesty law that applied to the harshest years of the regime prevented the prose­cution of violent crimes such as homicide and torture. 
Advances in human rights came in the 1900s, Guzman said. A new criminal proce­dure put all power in the judgns' hands, and an inves­tigation provided judges with the names of those killed, abducted and tortured. as well as who committed the crimes against the victims. 
"The investigations began with lawsuits in 1998 against Pinochet -for assassination, for abduction, for torture," Guzman said. "Nobody ever thought Pinochet was going to be subpoenaed." 
While the investigation was going on, Pinochet was in London, but an order was filed that he be extradited to Spain. A court found that Pinochet was mentally unfit and could not be tried in Spain. 
"He returned to Chile and walked around showing everyone how well he was," Guzman said. 
Guzman filed an order to lift Pinochet's immunity, which won a majority vote and was implemented. Guzman indicted him in three cases, but the Supreme Court overruled two of them. 
Guzman said although Chile has made great advances and achieved great progress, human rights are still being violated. Indigenous people, students and other groups are being silenced, and when they mobilize, they are impris­oned. 
"After four governments that are called democratic governments, we are still violating different human rights and impunity contin­ues to rule in Chile," Guzman said.

issues, and the winning ad will be broadcast during the Notre Dame-Syracuse football game. 
"I think there will be some highlighting of Notre Dame sustainability initiatives dur­ing the football game," Long said. 
Another component of Green Week will be that the football game will be carbon neutral -a first for the University. 
"This is Notre Dame's first game that will be carbon neu­tral. It's actually one of the first in NCAA," Long said. 
Long said emissions from fan travel, team travel and any activities at the stadium on game the day will all be taken into account in deter­mining how much carbon needs to be offset in order to have a carbon neutral game. 
Carbon emissions will be offset with different programs students and the Office of Sustainability have done this semester, Long said. 
Game day recycling, which has consistently collected over 10 tons of recyclable products each game day, will help ofT­set carbon emissions, Long said. 
The energy competition that challenged dorms to conserve energy is another program to that will contribute to the off­set of emissions. On average, dorms reduced their energy use by eight percent, accord­ing to Long. 
"Walsh Hall won and they had over 30 percent reduction over the course of the compe­tition," Long said.

"I think the really exciting thing is that we're going to be exchanging 3,000 light bulbs. It's a concrete way students can help out," Long said.

Nebraska parents abandon teenagers 
Associated Press 
LINCOLN, Neb.-The mother was running out of more than patience when she abandoned her 18-year-old daughter at a hospital over the week­end under Nebraska's safe-haven law. 
She was also running out of time: She knew that state lawmakers would soon meet in a special session to amend the ill-fated law so that it would apply to newborns only. 
"Where am I going to get help if they change the law?" said the moth­er, who lives in Lincoln and asked to not be identified by name to protect her adopted·child. 
To the state's surprise and embar­rassment, more than half of the 31 children legally abandoned under the safe-haven law since it took effect in mid-July have been teenagers. 
But state officials may have inad­vertently made things worse with their hesitant response to the prob­lem: The number of drop-offs has almost tripled to about three a week since Gov. Dave Heineman announced on Oct. 29 that lawmak­ers would rewrite the law. 
With legislators set to convene on Friday, weary parents like the Lincoln mother have been racing to drop oft' their children while they still can. 
On Thursday, authorities searched for a 17-year-old girl who fled an Omaha hospital as her mother tried to abandon her. Her 14-year-old brother was taken into state custody, health officials said. 
Child welfare experts said the late deluge of drop-offs was probably inevitable. After all, they said, some date had to be picked to begin chang­ing the law. 
But some of them said lawmakers and the governor missed chances to change the law early because they underestimated the number of des­perate families looking for help. Heineman called the special session only after a spate of five drop-offs in eight days.

Need is measured "very carnfully," he said. 
I>npnnding on the resourcns in qunstion, need is calculated by two diiTnnmt mnthodologins -l"ederal and institutional. 
The f'ednral government is a "big provider or studnnt aid ­through l"ndPral grants, feder­al loans and work study," Husso said. 
The l"ederal methodology "drives eligibility for nnnd­hased l"ederal student aid," he said. 
For Notre Damn dollars, the Univnrsity us<~s a similar methodology railed institu­tional nwthodology, a product of" Tho College Board. which many schools subscribn to. 
"This is not a perfect science -we gather as much infor­mation as w<~ can from the family. we verify it with tax docum!Hlts and wn revinw the initial reading that The Collegn Board snnds us, and sonwtimns make adjustmnnts 
to that, and in the end, we 
come up with a number that 
we think is reasonable for the 
family," Husso said. 
These calculations make 
several assumptions -induct­
ing the family's willingness to 
contribute, he said. 
"There's clearly going to be, for a lot of families, a lot of sacri11ce ... and a lot of hard work." 
A combination of work and/or loans and University Scholarships may be added to the financial aid package, to cover the family's need and to reach what the Office of Financial Aid calls the "Cost of Attendance." This 11gure takes into account tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, as well as personal and transportation expenses. 
The average freshman schol­arship this year will be between $22,000 and $23,000, Husso said, and roughly 45 percent of students receive Univorsity scholarships. Athletes and the children of University employees who receive educational benefits are not ineluded in either of those figures. he said. 
About three quarters of all Notre Dame undergraduates receive some sort of financial help from some place ­including athletes and chil­dren of University employees. 
During the 2007-2008 aca­demic year, over $270 million dollars were given to all Notre Dame students. Of that total, $167 million was given to undergraduates, and specifi­cally $39 million was given to froshmen. 
These percentages are com­parable to peer institutions such as the Ivy League schools, Duke, Northwestern and Stanford, Husso said. 
The University is one of the charter members of an organi­zation called the 568 Presidents' Group-com­prised of 27 institutions com­mitted to need-blind admis­sions and to addressing "some real serious issues that creat­ed divergence in how families ability to pay was being calcu­lated." Husso said. 
Husso is a member of' the Group's technical committ1w working to solve these prob­lems and come up with a con­sensus approach to detnrmine a ramily's ability to pay. 
"We're all going to do it the same way -that's the consnn­sus approach," he said. 
Master of Engineering in Manufacturing Creating Global Professionals 
New technologies and markets require a new kind of professional. We prepare students with the knowledge and experience they need to become innovators in the field of global manufacturing. 
The Master of Engineering in Manufacturing is an intensive one­year program with an integrated, project-oriented curriculum grounded in engineering science. A group project in industry gives students real-world experience. 
Fellowships and opportunities for global study are available. 
'Affordable and accessible' 
Notre Dame is committed to 
meeting 100 percent of stu­
dents' demonstrated need, 
Husso said, and the University 
plans on continuing its previ­
ous admissions and financial 
aid policies, even though the 
11conomy may negatively affect 
its financial situation this year. 
Notre Dame is need-blind 
during the admissions process 
-"which is referenced by a 
couple of presidents in recent 
articles as something that is 
very difficult to do," he said. 
"But we will remain that way." 
Being a need-blind institution is the University's "premier policy" in terms of admissions and financial aid, Russo said. A Need-blind institution does not consider an applicant's finan­cial situation when making admissions decisions. 
"There are not a lot of high­cost private institutions that have this policy, and those that do arc going to be looking hard at it this year," he said. 
Notre Dame, however, will be keeping this policy. 
"We want to be accessible to anybody, we want the admis­sions decision to be basnd on applicants' credentials as they compete with other students, not on whether they can afford to come here," Russo said. "Only a handful of high-priced privates can say that. If you're admitted, we can look anyone in the eye and say, 'Wn can make this happen.' 
"We can make it affordable -we want access and we want affordability," he said. 
The University has a "very generous" policy dealing with the treatment of outside schol­arships -that is, scholarships from outside groups like a local Hotary Club or the National Merit Scholarship. Part of this policy has to do with being competitive with peer institu­tions, Russo said. 
Notre Dame allows the money received in outside scholarships to count toward the amount of work and/or loans in a student's financial aid package. 
"That's very generous. Most schools haven't met families' need, and that gap needs to be lilled with outside seholarships, and those who have met need might not be as generous in the way they treat outside scholar­ships," he said.

Manufacturing is more important than ever, in the 
U.S. and around the world. 
Association Clubs fall under the eategory of outside scholarships, Husso said. These figures added up "to the tune of over $2.7 mil­lion this year." 
"That's very special for Notrn Dame and I don't see that chang­ing-I see it growing," he said. 
Although the University does not currently plan on cutting out loans for all students, Husso said that might someday bn a possi­bility. 
"There will be students, in the end, who don't have any loans," he said. 
Where does the money come from? 
Husso said money for University scholarships come from three places -the University endowment, private donors and tuition. 
The first two sources provide what Husso called "real money" to pay students' bills. Twenty-five percent of the University endow­ment is allottnd for scholarships 
The third source, called tuition discounting, is the single-largest source o!' University Scholarships, he said. Tuition discounting uses what Russo called "funny money." 
This method reduces the stu­dent's bill "behind the scenes," which creates an expPnse that has to be offset by revenue. The primary source of revenue !"or the University is tuition, "so everybody's tuition has got to como up a bit to pay for this reduction," Husso said . 

The national avnragf~ tuition discount rate is 40 percent, he said. Some schools have reached their limit as far as tuition dis­counting goes, and are currnntly running into trouble, he said. 
"We would like to have most of our scholarship dollars be mal dollars and to not put the burden on tuition," Husso said. "We'd like the tuition discount rate to be zero -that's a tough goal to reach." 
A $1.5 billion fundraising cam­paign is curnmtly underway, he said -the third University f'undraising campaign in the last 15 years. The No. 1 priority of these campaigns has been undergraduate scholarship endowment. 
Reviewing packages 
No immediate changes are planned to thn University's policy of nwiewing or re-evaluating financial aid paekagns. 
Husso said there has benn "nothing out of thn ordinary" in terms of circumstances brought to tlw Office of Finaneial Aid's attention, like a parent losing his or lu~r job or th<~ death or a par­nnt. In these easns, the University does re-evaluate aid packages

IN BRIEF 
EPA coal-burning permit blocked 
WASHINGTON -The Environmental Protection Agency was blocked Thursday from issuing a permit for a proposed coal-burning power plant in Utah without addressing global warming. The ruling by an agency appeals panel means the Obama administration probably will determine the fate of other similar plants. 
The panel said the EPA's Denver office failed to adequately support its decision to issue a permit for the Bonanza plant without requiring controls on carbon dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas. 
The matter was sent back to that office, which must better explain why it failed to order limits on carbon dioxide. This is "an issue of national scope that has implications far beyond this indi­vidual permitting process," the panel said. 
EPA spokesman Jonathan Shrader said the agency wa..<; reviewing the ruling by the appeals panel, which traditionally gives great deference to agency decisions. lie declined to say how many other eoal plant permits might be affected. 
Family, Medical Leave Act Finalized 
WASIIINGTON -The Labor Department on Thursday announced final revisions in the Family and Medical Leave Act, including new rules delining how families of wounded service members will be able to take unpaid leave to care f(Jr them. 
While the addition of military families to the landmark law received positive reviews, the Labor Department's other revisions to the Act caused concern among labor and employee advocates. 
The AFL-CJO's Cecelie Counts said the new regulations dealing with military families were "fair" but called the rest a "rather stingy reading of' the law." 
Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calil'., said letting mili­tary families use the FMLA was necessary "to help military families balance work and family." But the "other changes to the Family and Medieal Leave Act look like they will, on balance, benefit employers at the expense of workers," said Woolsey, a member of the House Education and Labor Committee.

Bush defends free enterprise system 
Prior to this weekend's global economic summit, Bush praises capitalism 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -President George W. Bush fervently defended U.S.-style free enterprise Thursday as the cure for the world's finan­cial chaos, not the cause. He warned foreign leaders ahead of a weekend sum­mit not to crush global growth with restrictive new rules. 
"We must recognize that government intervention is not a cure-all," Bush said from Wall Street, setting his own tone for the two­day meeting that begins Friday in Washington seek­ing solutions to the eco­nomic crisis that has spread around the world. 
"Our aim should not be more government," he told the business executives. "It should be smarter govern­ment." 
The president acknowl­edged that governments share the blame for the severe economic troubles that have hit banks, homes and whole countries. 
He spelled out his pre­scription, which includes tougher accounting rules and more modern interna­tional financial institutions.

dise, which nets the center about $800,000 annually. 
The family is protective of how King is depicted, and Farris said any items that are inconsistent with his uncle's message and image would not be approved. 
Any proceeds from King­Obama merchandise would also go to the King Center, said Farris, a member of the estate management team that reviews intellectual property issues. 
The family, which refuses to divulge details of its licensing deals, is also discussing how to go after violators. 
King's estate sued CBS over its sale of a video documentary that used excerpts of his 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech. An appeals court ruled in 1999 that the speech was covered by copyright and was not public domain, but the estate ultimate­ly settled out of court for an undisdosed sum. 
"They are probably one of the most careful, concerned and on-top-of-it groups of image protectors I've ever met," said Philippa Loengard, assistant director of the Kernoehan Center for Law, Media and the ArL<> at Columbia University. 
Realizing the value of his ideas, King himself copyrighted several of his speeches during his lifetime. After he died, that duty fell to his widow, Coretta, and, since her death in 2006, to their children. Some scholars have complained about the family's aggressive pursuit of moneymaking opportunities. 
But the Kings have never faced a ehallenge quite as big as this. Vendors across the country have capitalized on connecting Obama to King, mostly without permission and without a penny of the proceeds going to his estate. 
"We realize the historic nature of events surrounding President-elect Obama and we are seeking an elegant solution to address the eommercial use of Dr. King's image in connec­tion with our newly elected president," Dexter King said in a statement.

Millions stage 111ock earthquake 
Emergency drill used to test preparedness ofemergency responders 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -People across Southern California on Thursday looked like they had stepped out of a disaster movie. Children ducked under their desks. Victims with fake blood lay on the ground. First respon­ders sprang into action to treat the "wounded." 
The controlled chaos was all part of a mock "Big One" -an earthquake drill billed as the largest in U.S. history and aimed at testing the prepared­ness of governments, emer­gency responders and residents. 
At 10 a.m., a cast of millions dropped to the ground, covered their heads and held onto furni­ture. Local television stations interrupted their regular pro­gramming to announce the drill and covered it as they would a major earthquake, though with continual reminders that the emergency wasn't real. 
Thursday's drill was based on a fictional magnitude-7.8 event on the southern San Andreas Fault. If such a quake occurred today, scientists estimate it would kill 1,800 people and cause $200 billion in damage. Some high-rises would fall, sec­tions of freeways would crumble and gas pipes would crack. 
The dress rehearsal served to remind Californians that they live on shaky ground that can rupture without warning. That southern San Andreas has not popped in more than three cen­turies, and scientists fear stress buildup could unleash a big quake. 
"We're really taking a step forward toward earthquake safety," said Lucy Jones, a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist who has long urged residents to prepare. 
At Bishop Alemany High School. a San Fernando Valley campus badly damaged by a 1971 quake and destroyed by the 1994 Northridge disaster, the football field was filled with hundreds of mock mass casual­ties who wore colored wrist­bands indicating the severity of their fake injuries. 
Many of the students posing as faux victims said they were too young to remember Northridge, the last damaging quake in Southern California, which toppled bridges and buildings. 
Olivia Paluch, 17, who sported a fake gash on her head and cheek, pondered the "Big One" as she waited for firefighters to take her away by stretcher. 
"It's really scary seeing all my friends like this," Paluch said, gesturing to her fellow students painted with gruesome injuries on their bodies. "It's over­whelming." 
Another student, Emily Loren, 17, lay on the ground nearby with a bandaged head. Loren said she was pretending to be a student who was studying in the library and got hit by a falling book during the shaking. 
"It's exciting. It's better to be prepared. At the same time, it's nerve-racking," said Loren, who had a fake IV attached to her arm. 
Even California's governor­actor played a role. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger arrived by hel­icopter at the football field triage center in the late morning to survey the situation. He thanked the federal government for funding the drill and praised the agencies that cooperated. 
"It's one thing to talk about being ready for an emergency, but it's another thing to actually test it," Schwarzenegger said. 
Some people, however, remained blase. 
"I live under the assumption that the engineering going into these buildings is pretty sophis­ticated," said Grant Casner. who works on the ninth floor of a downtown high-rise and who didn't take part in the drill. 
Although the statewide drill was scheduled to start at 10 
a.m. 
Pacific time, Schwarzenegger surprised his staff by practicing the drill at 5 

a.m. 
The governor said he was pleased by his staffs response. 


Organizers said about 5 mil­lion people had signed up to participate. The exercise coin­cided with an annual disaster preparedness exercise held by the state. Unlike previous years, the simulation involved scores of governments, first respon­ders. schools, businesses, churches and residents, all fol­lowing the same script. 
Under the scenario, the south­ern San Andreas suddenly awakens near the Mexican bor­der, sending shock waves marching toward Los Angeles and eventually stopping in the high desert. The 200-mile rup­ture would leave a path of destruction. Shaking would last about three minutes. 
The minimum participation called for people to dive for safety. Firefighters and other emergency responders staged full-scale exercises complete with search-and-rescue mis­sions and medical triaging of people posing as casualty vic­tims. 
It was business as usual at Bishop Alemany High until sirens sounded shortly after 10 
a.m. and a soundtrack simulat­ing earthquake noise blared through the loudspeakers. 
Spanish teacher Fiorella Linares, who had been checking homework, ordered her approx­imately 20 students to "cover," and they dove under desks and grabbed onto the legs of chairs. 
Some of the teens giggled and joked. ''I'm dying," one shouted in mock horror. 
"Don't laugh," Linares scold­ed. "You have to think about what ifthis really happened." 
Despite decades of research, scientists still cannot predict when an earthquake will strike. 
California sits atop two of Earth's major tectonic plates and is the most seismically active state in the continental 
U.S. More than 300 faults criss­cross the state including the mighty San Andreas, which spawned the monstrous 1906 San Francisco earthquake. 
Less than half an hour after the exercise began, a small quake -magnitude-3.2 -hit central California, but it shook little and injured no one. 
Scientists have long warned about the possibility of a "Big One." They recently calculated a 
99.7 percent chance that a mag­nitude-6. 7 quake or larger will rock the Golden State in the next 30 years. The chance of a magnitude-7.5 or greater was 46 percent during the same period with the epicenter more likely in Southern California.

Four firm, he chose to teach math and religion to 7th and 8th graders at St. Jude Educational Institute in Montgomery, Ala. 
"I had always thought about doing a year or two of service after graduation to work on integrating service into my life after college," he said. "I looked at several of the programs that recruit at Notre Dame but was drawn to ACE because of how well it integrates the service, spirituality, community and work aspects of the program." 
Brogan Ryan said ACE's sell­ing point was the fact that it is a faith-based program. 
"ACE separates itself from other programs because it emphasizes not only service and spirituality, but also professional development and community life," Ryan said. 
Members of the ACE program teach in under-resourced Catholic schools for two years while living with other ACE pro­gram teachers in community and growing spiritually. During the summer, the teachers study education at Notre Dame, and typically earn a Masters degree in education after their two­year tenure. 
Like the Ryans, Saderia Nicole Hooks also graduated in 2008. Now teaching at St. Pius V in Jacksonville, Florida, she said the spiritual and communal val­ues fostered by the program served as her motivation to teach. 
Hooks said she thought it "would be a great way to begin a career in education ... ACE not only offered me the opportu­nity to teach, but also to earn a Master's Degree in education simultaneously."

FRANCE 
Russia seeks new start for U.S. ties 
Associated Press 
CANNES -Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Thursday that U.S. President-elect Barack Obama's move to the White House is a chance for a fresh start between the two powerful, nuclear-armed nations, whose ties have deteriorated over the past decade. 
"We are ready to develop really good-neighborly relations with the U.S.," Medvedev told business leaders in Cannes, France. ''I'm very glad the president-elect looks at these problems ... as a priority for U.S. foreign policy." 
"For us, relations with the U.S. are a foreign policy priority, too ... given the special role and mission of our two countries," Medvedev said. 
"The new administration will have the chance, if not to start with a totally clean slate, then at least to look at the issues without prejudice," he said. 
Last week, as congratulations poured in to Obama from around the world on his election victory, Medvedev gave a stern warning about U.S. plans to base missile defense units in Eastern Europe, saying Russia would react by bas­ing short-range missiles in the western territory of Kaliningrad. 
Medvedev and other Kremlin officials have backed off slightly since then, however. In an inter­view with French journalists broadcast Thursday, Medvedev again suggested that if Washington halts its plans, Moscow would do the same. 
Medvedev said he had had a good telephone conversation with Obama last week and that the two men had agreed they should meet face-to-face as soon as possible. 
"I hope... we'll be able to find a way out of these (difficult) situa­tions, which we haven't been able to do with our current col­leagues," he said in the televised interview. 
"The new president has a big reserve of good will. He was elect­ed during a very difficult period. I wish him success in dealing with what lies before him," he said. 
United Nations conference rejects religious terroris111 
Declaration by 80 nations express concern at serious instances of intolerance, discrimination, and hatred 
Associated Press 
UNITED NATIONS Countries attending a U.N. inter­faith conference Thursday rejected the use of religion to justify acts of terrorism and other violence that kills and injures innocent civilians. 
A declaration by 80 nations expressed concern at "serious instances of intolerance, dis­crimination, expressions of hatred and harassment of minority religious communities of all faiths." 
But it promoted dialogue among nations and called for understanding and respect for diverse religions and cultures. 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon read the declaration near the end of the two-day meeting which was initiated by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and brought 14 world leaders to New York including President Bush, the heads of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and Israel's presi­dent. 
"King Abdullah's initiative has come at a time when the need for dialogue among religions, cultures and civilizations has never been greater," Ban told a news conference. "The chal­lenge now is to go beyond the powerful, positive words we have heard." 
Many speakers spoke out against religious extremists, while defending tolerance and freedom of religion. 
President Bush, who likely delivered his last address at the U.N., echoed this theme saying: "We believe God calls us to live in peace -and to oppose all those who use His name to justi­fy violence and murder." 
Bush said expanding democ­racy is one of the best ways to safeguard religious freedom and promote peace. 
"People who are free to express their opinions can chal­lenge the ideologies of hate," he said. "They can defend their religious beliefs and speak out against those seeking to twist them to evil ends. They can pre­vent their children from falling under the sway of extremists by giving them a more hopeful alternative." 
Among the leaders brought together -at least in the same room -were the Saudi king and Israeli President Shimon Peres. 
Peres had rare praise for the Saudi monarch, saying Wednesday his initiative to end the Arab-Israeli conflict inspired hope that all countries in the Middle East could live in peace. 
But Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal expressed disap­pointment Thursday that Peres only talked positively about parts of the Arab peace plan ­and didn't mention others. 
The plan calls for Arab recog­nition of the Jewish state in exchange for a full Israeli with­drawal from all lands captured in the 1967 Mideast war. But Israel objects to relinquishing all territory and the right of all Palestinians to return, and it wants to keep a unified Jerusalem as its capital. 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown stressed the importance of peace in the Middle East, telling the conference Thursday that the creation of a Palestinian state side by side with an Israeli state "can be achieved by good­will." 
Saudi Arabia has been criti­cized by Human Rights Watch and others for refusing to allow the public practice of any reli­gion other than Islam and restricting those who do not fol­low the strict Wahhabi interpre­tation of Islam. 
In light of its sponsorship of the conference, Saud was asked whether Saudi Arabia would now allow the freedom of reli­gion and tolerance called for in the final declaration. 
The Saudi minister said this was "an important question" for his country but indicated that the process must be gradual. 
"If you bring people together so that they understand that they have the same ethics, they have the same values, this will open the hearts and minds of people for further progress," Saud told reporters. "But to say from the beginning you have to transform yourself into some­thing which you aren't now or nothing else can be achieved is, I think, carrying the argument too far." 
In the declaration, "participat­ing states affirmed their rejec­tion of the use of religion to jus­tify the killing of innocent people and actions on terrorism, vio­lence and coercion, which directly contradict the commit­ment of all religions to peace, justice and equality."

Forde ounces to freedom 
Forty names, beers, schools and minutiae making news at Notre Dame (1), where the Leprechaun Legion (2) is the second best student body of all the basketball schools in the nation [no 
criticisms of Fr. Jenkins (3) for fir­ing Tyrone Willingham (4) included]. 
The Flash (me, of course) would like to send a huge Notre Dame con­

gratulations over to Bob Kessler president elect Barack Obama (5). House ofStix The first black pres­ident certainly deserves a nice Samuel Adams Winter Lager (6) on me, but I can't seem to send liquids to the future leader of the free world, so he'll have to stop by The Linebacker Lounge (7 ) sometime so I can treat him. 
While on the topic of politics, The Flash would like say happy trails to Hache! Maddow (8) and Keith Olbermann (9). While these two were highly entertaining in the lead up to the election, they will most likely be unwatched for the next four years. Especially Olbermann, who made a second name for himself as the biggest critic of the Bush Administration (10). As consolation gifts for these two I would like to send Ms. Maddow a Busch Light (11) and Mr. Olbermann a Jaeger Bomb (12). 
Speaking of news media, The Flash would also like to send a shout out to ESPN (13), which proclaimed this week that Weis Watch (14) was beginning. I don't know about everybody else, but it seems like firing Charlie Weis (15) would truly signal the end for Notre Dame football. When I look around campus, it seems most of the student body does not care about the sport like we once did. The seniors remember the agony of the MSU Flag Planting 
(16) and the heartbreak of the Bush Push (17), the juniors remember come­backs against UCLA (18) and Michigan State (19), but the sophomores and freshmen only know embarrassing losses. When the student body runs through Stonehenge (20) after a sloppy win against a mediocre Bruin team it is evident that we have seen better days. The Flash thinks that this school needs a marquee victory soon or we could lose the student body indefinitely. A new coach is probably not going to bring that next year and we can not afford to enter another phase of rebuilding. 
Sticking with the football theme for a moment, The Flash still has not gotten "Viva La Vida" (21) out of his head. The Boston College band (23) played the song incessantly and I now know how losing away fans must feel after leaving Notre Dame Stadium (24). If I can't get the Coldplay (25) song out of my head, I have no clue how fans of Florida State (26) could have gotten the Victory March (27) out of their heads after the 1993 Game of the Century (28). 
Speaking of Florida, don't we wish we were in Florida now. With the tem­peratures falling, we are now in a criti­cal time of the South Bend Fall that is perfect for two things: a power running game (29) and sweatpants (30). Since the only place we've been able to find the first in recent memory has been in dorm showdowns at Stepan Fields (31), I'd like to take some time to ponder the second. 
As The Flash walks across campus in this weather, he often notices that you can tell where people come from by what they are wearing. Somebody wearing shorts and a hoodie is proba­bly used to the weather. I'm guessing Minnesota (32); those people can han­dle levels of cold like none other. Anytime I see a person wearing a dress coat and a scarf, I immediately think they are from the East Coast (33) -I 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Tolerate m.ediocre coaching 
Regarding mediocre or worse coaching, it should be obvious that better coaches have not wanted the Notre Dame head coaching job. If the administration had found better coaches than Davie, Willingham and Weis who were willing to take the job, we would not be in this mess. Has anything changed in that regard? No, and it probably won't. The job· is a huge pressure cooker and too many fans and students only make matters worse by calling for Weis to be fired ASAP. We should be patient and tolerant while requiring excellence at the same time. A little more patience and tolerance by fans and students would help in attracting a future top caliber coach. Think about it, no elite coach would come to a school which has a track record of firing two consecutive coaches after only three or four years on the job. Even though he may not deserve it, we need to have patience with Weis for at least a couple more years. Who knows, he might even get his act together in that time.

Speaking of keeping you warm inside, The Flash would like to thank Flashettes Olga Kurylenko (36) and Gemma Arterton (37) who everybody will know by tomorrow as the Bond girls in "Quantum of Solace" (now in a theater near you). 
The Flash would like to thank several people for their unknowing help with this column. Barry Allen (38) and Wally West (39) have been real troopers for unknowingly letting me use their alias.

This letter is regarding Robert Scully's Nov. 12 Letter to the Editor ("Offensive comics are back"), which was a response to the Nov. 10 edition of "The Dome Piece." How unintelligent does it make one if he doesn't realize that his intelli­gence is being insulted? I frankly enjoyed this particular issue of the Dome Piece very much, even to the point that I, God forbid, laughed at a joke about an erection. Far from insulting the readers' intelligence, I found it was an ironi­cally self-aware and palatably mild jab at the obvious Quinn fan-boy mentality that so dominates the current Notre Dame communal psyche. Do we really take ourselves so seriously that we're unable to recognize those foibles that make us uniquely Notre Dame? Are we really that uncomfortable with ourselves that a mention of something sexual-that a mention of an erection -makes a joke juvenile and not worth reading? I laud Cavadini and his attempt to make us take ourselves a little less seriously. Scully, ifyou want unfunny comics and visual stimulation, I recommend going and reading Family Circus in the Snite. I'll be laughing with everyone else at The Dome Piece.

In Colin Keeler's Nov. 12 Letter to the Editor titled "Learning to Laugh," he claims that all motion picture comedies can "seem 'degrading' ifviewed in some manner" but they are actually funny to people with a good sense of humor, and can serve to "highlight" the trials that discriminated groups face. Unfortunately, Keeler's remarks only address what he believes "degrading" represents. The controversy about Tropic Thunder arises from the film's repeated use of the r-word. For example, one of the film's characters, Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) plays an actor who starred as a farm boy with a mental impairment in a movie "Simple Jack ... Once upon a time there was a [r­word]." 
Use of the r-word perpetuates negative stereotypes and dehumanizes people with intellectual disabilities. It is an extremely offensive word for those familiar with the challenges of the intellectually-disabled community. Many people fail to understand that the "r-word" connotes the same level of discrimination as other awful words used to denigrate people, such as members of various racial and ethnic groups. I will not list these words, but I think it is obvious which words I mean. Would it be appropriate for SUB to show movies including any such hateful words? Hate speech is not acceptable, especially at a Catholic uni­versity. I applaud Mary Forr, and especially her sister Marita, for their courage and their influence on the Notre Dame community. I also urge everyone to please check out an editorial by Dr. Tim Shriver, head of Special Olympics International, whose cogent words on this issue were published in August in the Washington Post. The Special Olympics is one of over 20 disability advocacy groups to boycott Tropic Thunder.

JORDAN GAMBLE Scene Writer 
Nepal has fascinated director and pro­ducer Julin Bridgham over since her ele­mentary school principal talked about doing Peace Corp work there in the 1960s. 
Bridgham comes to Notre Dame's Browning Cinema on Friday with her documentary "Sari Soldiers," about womnn lighting on both sides of Nepal's brutal 10-year civil war. which killed nearly 13,000 and displaced at least 100,000 by its end in 2006. The film won Bridgham the 200R Nestor Almendros Prize for courage and commitment in human rights lilmmaking at the Human Hights Watch Film Festival. 
Bridgham traveled with her producer Hamyata Limbu (hersnlf a Nepali woman) for thn~n ynars through war­torn Nnpal. following the lives of six wornnn in the struggle between the gov­ernment of Nepal's king and the Maoist insurgents. These womon inducted: Devi, whose daughter was kidnapped by the Hoyal Nepal Army; Maoist Commander

Kranti; Royal Nepal Army Officer Rajani; Krishna. a monarchist from a rural com­munity who leads a rebellion against the Maoists; Mandira, a human rights lawyer; and Ram Kumari, a student activist with the hope of helping to reestablish democracy. 
"There's a distinct sense of empower­ment they feel as women being armed. Many see it as an opportunity to have some kind of power," said Bridgham in an interview with a reporter from Duke University in 2006, as the footage for the documentary was being assembled. Still, the film's ultimate message is that if women had their way, most of them would bring a war to its end as soon as possible. 
Initially, Bridgham was wary about showing the film in Nepal for fear that it would endanger the six protagonists, as she explained in an interview with Saathee Magazine, a publication for the South Asian community in the Carolinas region of the United States. "It was important to all of us that the women felt comfortable having the film shown, and to wait to show it in Nepal until things __,.,. .' · -f. . . 
were more stable. Amazingly, the politi­cal climate changed during the course of the filmmaking, and so we have been able to show the film in Nepal, and the women have been very supportive and encouraging of its being widely shown throughout Nepal," she said. 
Since first visiting in 1993, Bridgham now calls the country her second home. She spent most of the last six years there, making other documentaries for the Nepalese Youth Opportunity Foundation and the United Nations' World Food Program as well as the inde­pendent features "At the Edge of Sufficient," about two families in Nepal's rural region, "Indentured Daughters," a documentary on Nepali girls sent into bonded labor, and "Children of Hope," about Nepali orphans given new oppor­tunities through education. 
Bridgham, a graduate of the University of Colorado, Boulder, has used her degrees in International Affairs and Environmental studies for projects out­side Nepal, crafting documentary series for the BBC, Discovery Channel, and TLC about global issues. Before she got into 
ANDR 
documentary-making, she worked in Costa Hica on a U.N. environmental proj­ect and in Bolivia as a researcher for the Andean Information Network human rights organization. 
"As individuals, we ean make a difl'er­ence by making sure these issues are made public and that we pressure our governments to hold those responsible accountable," Bridgham told Saathee Magazine. "I really think that wide­spread exposure is a key element to making people accountable, but at the end of the day, we need to make sure that the courts follow through on the rule of law, as well as aecountability." 
Sari Soldiers will run Friday night at 
6:30 and 9:30 pm at the Browning Cinema in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, with Bridgham scheduled to be present at the screening. Tickets are $3 for students and $5 for faculty and staff. For more information about the film and its director, go to performin­garts.nd.edu.

JAMES DUBRAY Scene Writer 
In the The Band's famous Civil War tlwmed tuno, Lnvon llelm exclaims, "Like my fathnr before me/1 will work the land." Jakob Dylan, known for his time as load singer for The Wallflower's, snems to have borrowed the Bob Dylan assoeiatnd group's sentiment with his debut solo album. "Seeing Things," 
Seeing Things 
Jakob Dylan 
Released by: Columbia Records Recommended Tracks: 
"Something Good This Way Comes," "This End of the Telescope" 

whieh is a gutsy record on many levels. 
First, much like his father before him, Jakob has the eonfidenee to accompany his songs with sparse instrumentation, allowing his lyrics to come to the fore­front. And unlike his fellow acoustic peers, Dylan's lyrics overcome childish sentimentality and banal quips. Banana pancakes are tasty once in a while, but certainly don't need a song written about them. 
In an equally audacious move, Dylan not only signed to his father's lifelong 
friend Columbia records, but also released his record in daddy's staple Red CD format. Despite the not so subtle trademarks, Jakob's record here seems more akin to Johnny Cash's work or even Helm's recent solo album than to Bob Dylan's work. 
Paired with famous producer Rick Hubin, Dylan and Columbia put out the 38 minute solo record on June 1Oth. The album is largely meant for Sunday morn­ing reflection -the instrumentation con­tains itself to Dylan's acoustic guitar and voice, with a muted drum and bass heard on a few songs. The beauty of the record is its thematic focus, which provides a sense of Pete Seeger populism that acknowledges the darkness in the world, but ultimately finds a sense of hope in the value of work and companionship. 
During the "Valley of the Low Sun," Dylan comments, "I know that soldiers are not paid to think/But something here is making us sick." While the Bush bash is not so subtle, Dylan employs a Colin Meloy sense of Americana infused imagery in the tune to discover a notion of meaning within the horrors of an end­less war, "Of snow covered beaches and junkyards of diesel/And bombers named after girls." 
Dylan's voice sounds world-weary throughout the record. His lyrics reveal a man who seems much older than his 38 years. The album tells stories of, "Boarded mansions and ghost filled yards," that contain, " ... a boy in a water tower counting cards," and, " ... an out­law now standing at the foot of infinity." These sorts of tales and images may seem somewhat out of place on a record made by a guy from L.A., yet Jakob Dylan has always sounded much more comfortable talking about anything but his personal life. 
The highlight of the album is the single "Something Good This Way Comes." On this mid tempo, upbeat ditty, Dylan lets go of the rustic backrooms and takes his charaeters on a highway, which leads to the redemption of their souls. The record that began with the declaration, " ... evil is alive and well," shifts to greener pastures where there is, " ... sweet apple pie on the stove." Jakob's voice seems much more at ease in this song as he sits back and sings about this apple pie and a " ... good woman by my side." 
The album ends with a lyrically bril­liant song, "This End of the Telescope," which reveals the former Wallflower in an unusually personal light. Jakob closes with an ode, "Companions we made did­n't last/Lousy lovers do well with their hands/But I'll reach you like nobody can." 
Jakob Dylan's solo debut is not earth shattering. Yet, after the three albums that followed the Wallflowers' commer­cial success, "Bringing Down the Horse," were marked by critical indifl'erenee, the singer songwriter clearly nended a change. Jakob Dylan's return as an acoustic troubadour proves to be a treat to fans of lyrical strength of beauty.

When we were kids, my sister and I did not agree on much. 
Every day, we would come home from school, grab an afternoon snack of a brown sugar cinnamon Pop Tart, hers frosted, mine not, pour ourselves a glass of milk, hers skim, mine Laura Myers one percent, and sit down in front of the television. We ------­
fought over that, too, Scene Writer because I wanted to watch Sailor Moon and she want­ed to watch Pokemon. Then came 1998, and a little show called "Total Request Live." 
I was in fourth grade and she was in sixth. We were too old to watch Pokemon (you're never too old to watch Sailor Moon), and we needed something we could agree on. 
TRL soon became a fixture in my life, just as it did in the lives of almost everybody in our age group. 
And after 10 years, music video lovers will stop traffic at Times Square for the last time Sunday during "Total Finale Live," MTV's tribute to the monumental show. 
When he announced the scheduling of TFL in September, Executive Producer Dave Sirulnick said the show would not be ending for good, but simply, "taking a break." Whether that will hold true remains to be seen. 
The finale will bring back popular host Carson Daly as well as many stars, including P. Diddy, who appeared on TRL a record 36 times, members of 'N Sync, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Fred Durst, Eminem, Marilyn Manson, Travis Barker and others. The Backstreet Boys will be performing, as will 50 Cent and Fall Out Boy. 
TRL is the third longest-running show pro­duced by MTV, behind "The Real World" (14 years) and "120 Minutes" (17 years). It is the longest-running live show. 
The top-10 countdown, which was voted on by viewers who could call 1-800-DIAL-MTV or vote online, encompasses every genre of music, from bubblegum pop to hip-hop and even country. It helped launch the careers of many artists and continues to do so. It has also helped the careers of its VJ's, or Video Jockeys. Daly left the show in 2003 to host NBC's "Last Call." Since then, other VJ's have come and gone, including One Tree Hill's Hilarie Burton. Damien Fahey and Lyndsay Rodriguez currently host the show. 
The program will be remembered for its outrageous moments, including the time MC Hammer married two fans during the telecast and the interview in which Elton John asked Justin Timberlake some very personal ques­tions about his dreams the previous night. 
It also had its share of awkward moments. After the debut of one of the "Harry Potter" movies, Daniel Radcliffe made an appearance on TRL and was greeted by a fan in Times Square who was wearing nothing but a towel. 
t. , 
.,~ 
In another uncomfortable moment, Daly had to interview actress and ex-girlfriend Tara Reid just days after their very public breakup. 
Through its news portion of the program, TRL was able to give its viewers a glimpse of the world look outside of entertainment. It was a part of MTV's Rock the Vote movement, which encouraged young voters to become active in the political process. 
For the most part, though, TRL is about the music, one of the only shows on MTV that can say that (other contenders: "Making the Band 27," and... no, that's it). It has always catered to its audience with current hits and popular performers. 
When it first started, TRL aired five days a week at 4 p.m., making it perfect for its demographic --teens and pre-teens who could come home from school to watch the show. In 2005, it began airing only four days a week at 3 p.m., which made it harder for many to tune in and could have led to produc­ers' decision to halt the show. "Total Finale Live" airs Sunday at 8 p.m. I plan to grab a frosted brown sugar cinnamon Pop Tart, pour myself a glass of skim milk, and say goodbye to the show that informed, entertained, and united my generation.

"It has been a goal of ours and would mean a lot to the seniors on the team to make it to the Stadium this year," she said. "We have waited a long time and we anl ready."

"We are confident that we can match up with any team as long as we continue to play the way we have been," McGlinn captain Sarah deGroot said in an e-mail. 
With the playoffs come post­season pressure, and deGroot said the contributions of the seniors will be crucial to her team's performance on Sunday. 
"We're really looking to the seniors to lead the team on Sunday," she said. "They are the most experienced players on the field and have additional motivation since this is their last season." 
McGlinn has never reached the championship game, but the Shamrocks have a feeling that this may be their year. 
"It would be really exciting to be the first McGlinn [team] to ever play in the Stadium," she said. "This is one of the most talented teams we've had in a long time and we'd love to make [rector] Sr. Mary [Lynch] proud by making it to the Stadium."

Associated Press 
SEATTLE (AP)-Tyrone Willingham and Lorenzo Romar enjoyed a quiet, 10­minute talk in the first row of courtside seats inside the University of Washington's otherwise empty basketball arena. 
Their chat on Thursday was symbolic yet unnoticed at this school, simply routine. 
Willingham, the Huskies' football coach who has been fired effective at the end of the season, Romar, the men's basketball coach, and women's basketball coach Tia Jackson last year made Washington the nation's only major college to have African-Americans coaching the three biggest sports pro­grams. 
Moments after Willingham wished Romar a happy 50th birthday, he made it clear he was anything but happy with the progress of the nation's universities in hiring minori­ty football coaches. 
A report released last week by the Black Coaches and Administrators said Willingham's dismissal last month and the firing of Ron Prince at Kansas State-also effective at season's end-left the NCAA's top Bowl Subdivision with only four black head coaches, plus one Latino and one Pacific Islander. That's down from a peak of eight. 
Minorities filled only four of last year's 31 coaching vacancies in NCAA Division I 
football, the report said. "Obviously, it should be a great concern to all of us
WOMEN'S INTERHALL 
because there's a pool of resources in our country that's not being tapped,"
Gan1es to decide Stadiun1 berth Willingham said before his 
tion, that hurts all of us." 
Willingham doesn't have a job beyond Washington's Dec. 6 season finale at California, but he does have a platform from which he can try to reverse the downward trend in minority hirings. 
The 54-year-old was elect­ed president of the American Football Coaches Association last winter and still has a few months left on his one-year term. Willingham has said he has not ruled out coaching somewhere next season, and he wants to make it easier for him and others to get hired. 
"I want to make it a natural platform," he said. "I think that benefits all of us. There are no losers." 
He said there is a move­ment within the AFCA to institute some form of the NFL's Rooney Hule, which requires that teams interview at least one minority candi­date for each head coaching vacancy. 
The NCAA said last week they cannot legislate or enforce such a rule in college football. 
"The NCAA does not hire coaches. The athletic direc­tors (do),"· NCAA vice presi­dent of diversity and inclu­sion Charlotte Westerhaus said. 
Willingham wants to at least increase the odds of hiring by expanding the minority pool. He said the AFCA is looking at a plan that would seek compliance from university presidents, athletic directors, prominent boosters and others most influential in a school's big­business football program. That ambitious goal is why something like a "Rooney Hule" won't become reality in college football for at least a few years, he said. 
"In the NFL, there is one team owner. There are a few more shareholders in college football," Willingham said with a wry smile.

NFL 
Cowboys owner optimistic 
Jones says team can still make playoffs, coaching change not needed 
Associated Press 
IRVING, Texas -Jerry Jones "absolutely" believes the Dallas Cowboys will make the playoffs, isn't considering a coaching change and would welcome Adam "Pacman" Jones back to the team if he's reinstated. 
The Cowboys owner, in an impromptu gathering with reporters during practice Thursday, said he expects his struggling Cowboys to recover. They have gone from Super Bowl favorites to a 5-4 team tied for third place in the NFC East after losing four of its past six games. 
"That's not optimism," Jones said. "I certainly do feel we're going to be a team that plays well enough to be thinking about the playoffs." 
Coming off its open date, Dallas gets injured quarter­back Tony Romo back Sunday night at Washington after he missed three games with a broken pinkie on his throwing hand. 
"I would say Romo gives you a legitimate reason to not have been your best or been what you might have expected over the last three games," Jones said. 
The Cowboys lost two of three without Romo, and the only win was notable for being the worst offensive perform­ance in a victory in franchise history. But they were already struggling when he broke his finger on the opening play of overtime in a loss at Arizona on Oct. 12. 
After the Cowboys lost at St. Louis a week later, Jones emphatically said that coach Wade Phillips' job wasn't in danger during this season. The owner was even more committed to the coach on Thursday. 
"There's just absolutely no, I can tell you without hesitation, thought in my mind about him not coaching the Dallas Cowboys in the future, past this year," Jones said. "No thought. I haven't given that one ounce of consideration .... His contract is his contract." 
Phillips got a three-year con­tract with an option for a fourth season when he replaced Bill Parcells in February 2007. The Cowboys went 13-3 and had 13 Pro Bowl players in their first sea­son under Phillips, but lost to the New York Giants in the playoffs. 
With the recent struggles, and supposed successor-in­waiting Jason Garrett already on the staff, there has been intensified speculation about Phillips' job status. 
Garrett, the team's offensive coordinator who was hired weeks before Phillips, got $3 million and an expanded title (assistant head coach) to stay after being a finalist for two other NFL head coaching jobs last offseason. 
"I understand why that question is. I do, and I helped make that question probably legitimate," Jones said. "But it is worth it in my mind to have him here and have Wade here. It's worth it to have to answer 
YOU CAN tAAKE AWORlD OF DIFFERENCE. 
NATIONAL CLANDESTINE SERVICE CAREERS that question." 
Asked if he was satisfied with Phillips' performance this season, Jones said he was dis­appointed that the Cowboys haven't won more games and that it was fair to ask if the coach was to blame. 
"What I'm hoping is that all of the positive things that Wade Phillips is about really does kick in, in a way that gives him his due and gives him his credit," Jones said. "I thought that for whatever the reasons he didn't get the cred­it that he should have had last year." 
Told of the owner's com­ment's after practice, Phillips said his only concern was the Redskins. 
"This game is the most important (for) our team," Phillips said. "I don't worry about all of that. I do the best I can do." 
Cornerback Adam Jones was suspended indefinitely last month for violating the league's personal conduct poli­cy. Commissioner Roger Goodell said he would deter­mine the length of the suspen­sion after four games, which would be after Sunday's game in Washington. 
Only six weeks after being reinstated from a 17-month suspension because of repeat­ed legal problems, the corner­back was involved in an alco­hol-related scuffle Oct. 7 with one of his bodyguards at a pri­vate party in Dallas. The Cowboys had employed the bodyguards to try to keep Jones out of trouble.

Former coach still upset over age controversy 
Associated Press 
Bela Karolyi says he views the probe into the ages of Chinese gymnasts from the 2000 Olympics as a lame attempt to shift the focus from the investigation of this year's athletes that resulted in no sanctions for China's gold-medal team. "I think that's just a cover-up," Karolyi said Thursday, in Chicago to help USA Gymnastics promote the Tyson American Cup set for the Windy City in February. "They're trying to hold onto their reputation on this issue, when it's one of the most bla­tant things we've ever seen." 
Last month, the International Gymnastics Federation closed the investi­gation into whether the Chinese gymnasts who beat the United States for the gold medal in Beijing were under­age. But the federation said it wanted more information about two members of China's 2000 team -Dong Fangxiao and Yang Yun -saying the evidence and explanations about their ages was not sat­isfactory. China won the bronze medal in Sydney, and Yang also won a bronze on the uneven bars. 
Gymnasts must turn 16 dur­ing an Olympic year to be eli­gible to compete. 
Dong's official birthdate is listed as Jan. 20, 1983. But her accreditation information for the Beijing Olympics, where she worked as a national technical official, lists her birthdate as Jan. 23, 1986, said Andre Gueisbuhler, the FIG's secretary general. 
Yang, meanwhile, said in a June 2007 interview that aired on state broadcaster China Central Television that she was 14 in Sydney. She has since said she misspoke. 
Gueisbuhler told The Associated Press earlier this week that there were no updates on the investigation of the 2000 athletes. 
Karolyi, former leader of 
the U.S. team and husband of national team coordinator Martha Karolyi, said the 12 weeks that have passed since the Olympics have not dimin­ished his anger about the age issue in gymnastics. He long has been a proponent of abol­ishing the age limit, saying that if gymnasts have the mental and physical ability to perform the skills, they should be allowed to compete. 
"If you take it away and our kids lose, they lose," he said of the age limits. "Those Chinese kids are good. I have nothing against the Chinese kids. But how about the other kids who were staying home? Here's Rebecca Bross, two months short of being able to compete, sitting, crying in front of her TV, watching kids younger than her compete." 
Bross, the 2007 U.S. junior champion, turns 16 next year and wasn't eligible for Beijing. 
Karolyi also said he was complaining about the Chinese team back in 2000, when he ran the U.S. women's team that finished fourth. 
"I was screaming, 'Look, she was on the junior team, she was here the year before as a junior,"' Karolyi said. "How did she make up two years of age in one year? So now, eight years later, they come back and investigate that kid?" 
Steve Penny, the president of USA Gymnastics, said the age controversy isn't likely to go away now that the Olympic torch is out -at least not in the minds of those involved daily in gymnastics. 
"Bela makes a good point when he says the Chinese kids went out there and did a good job. They performed," Penny said. "But there's a rule that says you've got to be 
16. And because of everything surrounding this, it takes away from their performance on the field of play. It's going to loom over the event for a long time, I think."

Women's head coach Tim Connolly said his team also hopes to make the champi­onship meet. 
"Healistically, if we are in the top four, we've got a shot," he said. 
The women finished sixth at the Big East champi­onships, and were paced by junior Lindsay Ferguson, who finished 14th and earned all-conference hon­ors. 
Only four individuals per region who are not on a qualifying team can earn at­large bids to the champi­onships, which makes it very difficult, Connolly said. He said, however, they are not focusing on individuals. 
"!Ferguson! does have a very good chance to quali­fy," he said. "But we want to qualify as a team."

Feeley's OT field goal puts Jets over Patriots 
Associated Press 
FOXBOHOUGH, Mass. ­The New York Jets stand alone atop the tight AFC East standings -barely. 
Jay Feely kicked a 34-yard field goal on the first series of overtime after New England tied the game on Matt Cassel's pass to Handy Moss with one second left in regulation and the .Jets sur­vived a Tom Brady-like comeback with a 34-31 vieto­ry Thursday night. 
The win broke a tie for the division lead between the teams and gave the Jets (7-3) sole possession of' first place for the first time since Nov. 19, 2001, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The Patriots (6-4) have won the 
AFC East the last five  sea­ 
sons  and  six  of the  last  
seven.  

"It's a great, great feeling for us," Jets coach Erie Mangini said. "Everybody understands that this game was extremely important, and it's important because it allows us to make the next game (against Tennessee) extremely important. It's a really positive step for our team." 
The Jets, who led 24-6 in the first half. extended their winning streak to four with their sixth victory in seven games and are 1 1/2 games ahead of Buffalo and Miami in the division. 
The loss wasted a brilliant performance by Cassel, whose first pro start after Brady's season-ending knee injury in the opener came in a 19-10 win over the Jets. Cassel completed 30 of 51 passes for 400 yards, all career highs, and three touchdowns. He ran eight times for 62 yards. 
"It's not enough," Cassel said. 
The Patriots got the tying touchdown on Cassel's 16­yard pass on fourth down. Moss' diving sideline catch was reviewed when he was 
pushed out of' bounds by cor­
nerback Ty Law, but the 
touchdown stood. 
New England had marched 
to Moss' touchdown from its 
38-yard line with no time­
outs and 1:04 left 
Stephen Gostkowski's extra point tied it and erased a 31­24 lead the Jets had taken on Thomas Jones' 1-yard touch­down run with 3:10 left. 
Brett Favre made his 263rd consecutive regular­season start, an NFL record, and went 26-of-33 for 258 yards and directed the only drive of overtime, covering 64 yards on 14 plays in 7:50. llis 16-yard pass to Laveranues Coles brought the ball to the Patriots' 24­yard line, Jones' (>-yard run moved it to the 18 and Feely connected for his second Jield goal of' the game. 
"We talked during the week about the need to reload and finish the game," Mangini said, "and we did that." 
The Jets scored on their first three series, plus a 92­yard kickoff return by Leon Washington, four days after scoring on all seven of their lirst-half possessions in a 47­3 rout of the St. Louis Hams. 
Washington also scored on a 7-yard pass play before the Patriots cut the lead to 7-3 on their first series on the first of Gostkowski's three field goals, a 42-yarder. 
Feely kicked a 22-yarder for the Jets before Gostkowski connected again. from 31 yards to cap a 12­play drive. 
New York needed just one play -Washington's return -to score on the ensuing kickoff. It was his first kick­off return for a touchdown this season after he tied a team record last year with three. 
And when Favre threw a 15-yard scoring pass to Jerricho Cotchery, the Jets led 24-6 with 4:57 left in the first half and the outlook was very bleak for the Patriots.

Men travel to Cleveland for tri-meet 
By MIKE GOTIMER Spons Writer 
Notre Dame travels to Cleveland State this weekend to take on the Vikings and Miami (011) to eompete in a tri-meet with the two sehools. 
In Notre Dame's last meet, it fell to 1-2 on the season with a loss to No. 16 Purdue on Nov. 8. The Irish were overmatched on the diving board. where 2008 Beijing Olympian David Boudia set two Holt's Aquatics Center records for Purdue. 
In their last matchup, the Irish defeated the Vikings 171-124 at the Rolfs Aquatic Center last November. The Irish have won their past 13 
meets  against  Cleveland  
State.  Under  Coach  Tim  
Welsh,  the  Irish  are  21-2  

against the Vikings. 
On the other hand, Notre Dame has not swum against Miami in just over 10 years. The Irish and the RedHawks last met on Nov. 7, 1998 in a quad-meet with Purdue and Iowa State. The Irish finished third in the meet while the Redllawks finished fourth. 
Heading into the meet, the Irish hope to see continued high performance from soph­omore Michael Sullivan, who was named Big East swim­ming and diving athlete of the week. Sullivan earned the honor for his efforts against Purdue, where he won both the 200-yard back­stroke and 400-yard individ­ual medley with season best times in both events. 
The meet is scheduled to begin on Saturday at 2 p.m. at Cleveland State's Robert F. Bubsey Natatorium.

"It's only the first quarter of an NBA game, so I knew we'd come from behind somehow," Chieago rookie Derrick Hose said. 
And that's what the Bulls did. They turned up the dHfnnsn, startnd running the floor, then caught up and passnd the Mavericks for a 98-91 victory, sending Dallas to its fourth straight loss.

Williams scored a season-high 24, making a critical 3-pointer with James on the bench, as the Cavaliers improved to 5-0 at home and beat the Nuggets for the first time since 2005. 
"It looked like it was headed in the wrong direction in the first half, but we buckled down in the second and got it togeth­er," James said. 
James had lost his last five games against Anthony, whom he has known since high school, and is now just 3-8 against his 
U.S. Olympic teammate since they broke into the league together in 2003. James added 11 assists and eight rebounds, and for the moment owns brag­ging rights over Anthony. 
"Any time I play LeBron and we play Cleveland it's a fun game." Anthony said. "That's the way it is, there's so much hype around the game. I don't want to say they Wflre the better team. but they executnd down the stretch." 
Daniel Gibson snapped out of a shooting slump and added 15 points for the Cavalinrs. who held the Nuggets to 18 points in the fourth on 39 percnnt shoot­ing.

"There is no such thing as a 17-or a 19-point shot. We just had to chip away at the lead, play good defense, run the floor and get some of the shots we wanted, which we were finally able to do," Rose said. 
Rose, who shot 1-for-8 in the first half, was 6-for-7 in the third quarter, when he scored 14 of his 16 points. Luol Deng added 20 points. 
Josh Howard, returning after missing two games with sore wrist, led Dallas with 21 points and added 11 rebounds. Erick Dampier scored 16 and pulled down 18 boards. 
"It's disappointing. We des­perately need a win," Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. ''I'm just surprised at our Jack of light. I don't know how else to put it." 
Dallas biHw out to a 24-5 lead less than six minutes into the game before Chicago recovered for a one-point halftime lead. In the third quarter, Hose's play helped the Bulls take control and go up 78-70 with a quarter left.

Dallas cut it to seven with a minute left on Howard's free throw, but missed several shots to pull doser. 
"We don't play defense," Dallas guard Jason Kidd said. "That's been our problem. First six minutes we were playing defense and found ourselves up and that was it. We have as many offensive weapons (as anyone) in the league, but we got to lind some guys who want to play defense." 
Dallas eame out running and threatened to blow the Bulls out in the first quarter. Howard had 11 points and the Mavericks hit eight of their first nine shots. The Bulls were flat offensively, missing 12 straight shots after Drew Gooden's jumper in the opening minute. 
But just as quickly. the Bulls found their rhythm, reeling ofT 13 straight points behind seven from Gordon, cutting the lead to four. Chicago ended up trailing by 10 after one quarter when the Mavs' DeSagana Diop tipped in a shot just before the buzzer. 
The Bulls shot 28 percent in the opening quarter to 55 per­cent for the Mavs. And strangely enough, those percentages were reversed in the second quarter -55 percent for Chicago and 28 percent for the Mavs. 
With Chicago down by 12 in the second quarter, Deng led the Bulls on a 22-9 run with 12 points, hitting a late driving basket for a 51-50 halftime lead.

That game was part of Notre Dame's annual Mike Berticelli Memorial Tournament and did not count toward the confer­ence standings. With a spot in the Big East title game on the line and a chance to impress the NCAA seeding committee, Clark isn't worried about his squad taking the Bulls lightly. 
"Just look at their record (12-4-2) -in one of the polls, they're even ranked above us," said Clark, whose team is 12-5­

"Given these older guys, what they've done, they want to play big games," the reigning Big East eoach of the year said. "You try to gauge your sched­ule every year on who you've got and what they've done, to stratngieally gain an NCAA bid. 
motivated ... we certainly don't need to remind them how diffi­cult it's going to be." 
The Irish scored four goals in an 11-minute span during the first half of their early-season victory over South Florida. But the Bulls have given up just 11 goals all season -a total of six in their 17 games against teams other than Notre Dame. 
Add into the mix the fact that South Florida is at home ­where it is 7-0-1 at and has surrendered only a pair of goals in those eight games ­and it looks like the Irish will have to fight just to put one tally on the board. 
"It's a learning process, play­ing in big games on the road in hostile environments," Clark said. "This is just a fabulous opportunity for us to test the mettle of our team."

Next after preseason: LSU in Baton Rouge 
Peters returns to game action for first time 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Managing Ediror 
After crushing Gannon 96­30 in its only preseason game, Notre Dame starts its regular season Sunday -but can expeet a mueh tougher matchup. The Irish travel to Baton Rouge, La., to play LSU in the State Farm Tip-Off Classic. 
Irish coach Muffet McGraw said she was honored that her team was invited to play in this game. 
"We've always watched [the Tip-Off Classic], there's always great teams playing in it. Now we have an opportunity to play in it," McGraw said. "I think we're honored to be there and it's going to be a great opener for us." 
The Irish have had a long layoff since their last time on the court -their win against the Lady Knights occurred on Nov. 5. McGraw said that keeping her team focused after so many consecutive practice days between games has been a challenge. 
"I think if you ask the play­ers, it's a tremendous chal­lenge when they're looking at five or six days of practice. At this point they're pretty tired of practice," she said. 
McGraw said she gave her team Wednesday off from practice because of back-to­hack hard practices on Monday and Tuesday. The team will also have a short practice because of traveling. 
Although MeGraw got a look at 10 of her players against Gannon, she has yet to see forward Devereaux Peters in a game situation. Peters missed the Irish preseason game after missing a mandatory study session. Sunday will be Peters' first game sinee tearing her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) against Pittsburgh last February. 
"She's going to be ready. She had a really good practice on Monday. I think defensively she's doing a great job. She's one of our best defenders," McGraw said of the 6-foot-2 sophomore. "We're going to try her in different spots and see where she's most effective. 
In terms of her knee, she's prob.~bly still high 80 per­eent. 
Adding Peters will only add more depth to an already crowded Irish lineup. Against Gannon, every eligible player played in the first half, and all but point guard Melissa Leehlitner -who committed two fouls in the first four min­utes -had scored. 
McGraw said that she will likely give 10 of her 11 play­ers considerable minutes this season, and that this has led to very eompetitive practices. 
"It's incredibly competitive. Next year, you don't lose any­body so you can't look and say next year I'm going to play a few more minutes because of this or that," McGraw said. "I think playing time is going to be incredibly competitive. I think that's a good thing. We're going to have great bal­ance, we're going to have great depth." 
Although Lindsay Schrader is a senior, she earned a med­ical redshirt after tearing her ACL before her sophomore season. Peters said that the lack of seniors has not been a problem for the team so far in practices. 
"We know what we're capa­ble of doing and we know what we're going to do this year. I think the rest of the world is like, they're younger, they're kind of going to blow us off," Peters said. "I don't think we're worried about that right now. We're just going to come out and play and do what we know we ean 
..
d0. 
Going into Sunday's game, Peters said she and her team­mates feel excited for the early challenge. 
"We love the pressure of playing good teams like that, especially early. We like to get into it and get things done early," she said. 
But looking more long term, Peters said she has one big goal for this season. 
"Mainly just win the nation­al championship and whatev­er else comes along the way," she said.

By MATT GAMBER Associate Sports Editor 
When No. 9 Notre Dame and No. 8 South Florida hit the pitch for Friday's Big East semifinals matchup in Tampa, Fla., don't expect a repeat performance of the Irish's 5-0 thrashing of the Bulls on Sept. 7. 
"They're a good team, and I don't know if people quite realize what a good result [for us I it was at the time," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "Will it be 5-0 again this time'? It's highly unlikely -some days you get goals when they come easy for you, but they were a very good team then and

COMMENTARY 
Calls for Charlie's

Poor Charlin Weis. 
Nnvnr thought I'd spnak thosfl words, but there they arn. N1m~r thought I would pity sonworw who coaches Notre Dame football for a living, who makes mil­lions and who has morn bling than Paul Wall's grill.

ing for Weis' dismissal. SportsCnnter anehors wondered whether Weis might be through. Not hard to fathom, since the oll'ense never got ofl' the ground against Boston College and eouldn't rnaeh the end zone in four overtimfl periods against Pittsburgh. But the assertions arn unnecessary. 
Weis' abilities as eoach should not be questioned for thrnn rea­sons. One, look at his recruiting dasses. I le blessed this year's tmtm with Mic.hanl Floyd, Kyle Hudolph, Trevor Hobinson and Darius Fleming among others. Last year he brought in Golden Tate and Armando Allen. With the verbal commitments from Shaquelle Evans and Cierre Wood, he's well on his way to signing another great dass. 
If he can recruit while Notm Dame swings through a low point in its history, he's doing something right. Some of these recruits eould go play for Urban Meyer or Pete Carroll, but they eome to spend four years in South Bend, with it.'> lovely weather and the litany of attrac­tions surrounding campus. 
lie rmeds the time for the rncruit.<> to mature. I le inherited Brady Quinn, .Jefl' Samardzjia, Maurice Stovall and Darius Walker when they had maturnd. I le reached two BCS bowls with them. 
Two, he's still adjusting to the head eoaehing role. llis only previous eollef.,riate experience was at South Carolina where, as a graduate assistant and volun­teer eoaeh, he coached defen­sive baeks, linebackers and defensive ends. Those positions rnquired him to focus all of his attention towards a limited number of players and delve into the minutiae of one posi­
tion. 
In the NFL. he coached wide 
receivers, running backs and 
quarterbacks before becoming 
the oll"ensive coordinator of the 
Patriots. Again, smaller groups 
of people with a focused objec­
tive. Even as oll'ensive coordina­
tor, he worknd with one side of 
tho ball. 
Now he's in charge of nearly 100 young athletes who play all sorts of dill'erent positions. !lis first two seasons, he microman­aged Quinn and the oll'ense to great effect. Last year, when Jimmy Clausen came up short of Quinn's talent level, Weis had to rapidly adjust. At the begin­ning of this season, he took a broader role with the team, scaling back his involvement in the ofl'ense to oversee the team as a whole. 
Thanks to offensive stagnation in the last two games, he's revisiting his role with the oll'ense. And rightly so. That's his area of expertise. Corwin Brown, Jon Tenuta and Jappy Oliver can handle the defense. This balance may not work any better than the old system, but once he finds the balance that works best for him, his staff and his players, his coaching style will produce much better results. But this also takes time. 
Finally, Weis isn't throwing the picks, missing the blocks and tackles or committing the penalties. Critics point to the coach as the scapegoat for issues like this, but it's a com­plete non sequitur. lie can tie down the 0-linemen and preach to them not to chop block until they beg for mercy, but in no way does that translate to play on the field. 
Give the man time. He's shown what he can do when the pieces were in place. Now, grad­uation and youth have upset the playing board and scattered the pieces every which way. Weis has spent the last two seasons picking them up, slowly but surely. Once he finds a home not only for the pieces of the team, but for himself, he'll control a potent football team with a great deal of talent.

Charlie Weis will call the plays this week after the offense failed to score against BC. The pressure is on him to rejuvenate a team that looked inept mov­ing the ball.  Jimmy Clausen didn't have his contacts in against BC: he threw four interceptions in the game. To be fair, We is said he wasn't feeling well.  
Ken Niumatalolo knows the offense well; he was Navy's assistant head coach for six years before being promoted last year. He coached the Midshipmen to a win over then-No. 16 Wake Forest and an overtime win over Temple.  Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku­Enhada won't play Saturday, so Jarod Bryant will take his place. Bryant actually passes well for a Navy quarterback, but has only thrown two touch­downs this season in backup duty.

Record: 6-3 
Navy Midshipmen 

Navy's option offense always fhrows Notre Dame for a loop. The Mids rank second in the nation in rushing yards per game. Bryant has more rushes than Kaipo and can also effectively run the option offense.  
Notre Dame had trouble stopping BC's Monte! Harris, and could not shut down Javon Ringer and LeSean McCoy. Navy's multiple threats in the baekfield will make life dif­ficult for the Irish defense.  


Surely, the Irish can't lose to Navy, right? Well, that's what everyone was saying last year and look what hap­pened. But for as much as last week's offensive perform­ance resembled last year's team, this isn't last year's team and the Irish 
will do what they're supposed to do this 
week and beat Navy soundly. 
ANAL SCORE: Notre Dame 35 
SPECIAL TEAMS 
Notre Dame's special tean1s flopped against BC. A fumbled punt return, blocked punt and penal­ties during returns linllted Notre Dame's special teams success. 
Navy nets 34.9 yards per punt. It ranks No. 20 in punt return yardage but No. 111 in kick return yardage. Matt Harmon has made 14 of 16 field goals and hasn't missed inside 30 yards.

The Irish need to win this garhe to become bowl-eligi­ble and break out of the funk they've fallen into. With Weis calling the plays, the offense may find its old ways.  
The Midshipmen have a one-game streak going, and will want to keep it alive in front of their hometown fans. Also, Niumatalolo wants to prove his abilities as head coach by beating a rival.

With Weis calling the shots this time in Baltimore the Irish offense won't lay anoth­er goose egg. But a grind-it-out Navy team will slow down the pace of the game and keep this one relatively low scoring. The defense will play tough, but will probably wear down as 

the game goes on. Weis and the Irish realize their backs are against the rope:; this week and they will be able to save face and start a new streak against the Midshipmen. ANAL SCORE: Notre Dame 23

Thrust into starting role, Rudolph thriving 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 
This year's Notre Dame team is characterized by its talented and promising youth. Nowhere is that more true than at the tight end position. 
True freshman Kyle Rudolph has stepped up for the Irish by making a big contribution to the oll"ense as essentially the team's only tight end. 
Rudolph jumped into the lead role right out of the gates when projected starter Mike Ragone announced he would be getting season-ending surgery in late August. Ragone partially tore his ACL running routes during the summer and decided he wouldn't be able to play on it all year. Rudolph immediately jumped to the top of the depth chart. 
"That played a big role in adjusting to the game a lot soon­er," Rudolph said. "You are going against, especially late in camp, the [first team defense] all the time. Those are the kind of guys you are going to be see­ing on Saturdays." 
A few weeks later, Notre Dame lost its only other tight end when Will Yeatman was suspended for the remainder of the season. Rudolph said he didn't mind not having a veteran shoulder to lean on. 
"[Tight ends] coach [Bernie] Parmalee is there, he takes care of me if I have questions. When we're in the film room the older guys are still there helping me and critiquing me with tech­nique. They're still around even if they're not on the practice field," he said. 
Rudolph jumped right into the action as the only freshman in the starting line-up, picking up a five-yard catch against San Diego State in the season open­er. 
Since then, Rudolph has con­tinued to consistently contribute with 20 catches and two touch­downs through his first nine col­legiate games. His first trip to the end zone came week four against Purdue in the third quarter. He followed that up with another one the following week against Stanford. 
"I wouldn't say that I'm sur­prised, it's more excitement. I'm glad that I could do something and contribute to the team. That was my goal coming in," Rudolph said. 
The Irish have gotten some major contributions from their underclassmen in the passing game so far this season. Five of the team's top six receivers are freshmen and sophomore -. senior David Grimes is the only veteran in the group. Rudolph is currently one catch behind Grimes for fifth overall. 
Rudolph said the added pres­sure of a pass-heavy offense wasn't intimidating for him or any of his teammates -they embraced it. 
"For us being a receiving corps, when we throw the ball a lot that's exciting. But being a tight end, running the ball is great too. You get the best of both worlds," Rudolph said. 
During his days at Elder High School in Cincinnati, where he was named the No. 1 tight end prospect in the country, Rudolph split out to play wide receiver regularly. He said the toughest part of adjusting to the college game was run blocking. 
"Most of the [defensive opposi­tion] are bigger than I am, so for me it's not a real big block. Good technique and good fundamen­tals get the job done," hfl. said. 
In the past few weeks, Rudolph said he felt he was making big strides with his blocking. He no longer has to think about where his head and hands are placed; it is starting to become natural for him. 

Blocking aside, the hardest thing Rudolph has had to adjust to in the past few months has been the heavy workload that comes along with being a col­lege football player. 
"In high school you have prac­tice for a couple hours a day and that's all you have. Then you get here and it's meeting for a cou­ple hours, practice for a few hours, then watching film for a little while and lifting," he said. 
But for the 6-foot-6, 252­pounder, it's all worth it on Saturdays. Rudolph said game days make him feel like he is back in high school. 
"You have everybody at your games and you see everybody after the game. I always go back to the tailgate after the games and hang out with my family for the rest of the night," he said. 
The freshman said he normal­ly draws a pretty big crowd of relatives at each game -usual­ly 15 or more -with both his parents coming from large, sup­portive families. 
"Even if they don't get into the game they'll watch it some­where. My family loves being around up here. They love the atmosphere."
