St. Mary's recreation funds grow 

by Maureen O'Brien StaffReporter 

Dream becomes reality for St. Mary's. 
Half the need funds for the construction of a new sports and recreation facility have been re­ceived, according to St. Mary's President John M. Duggan. More than $493,000 of an estimated $850,000 needed funds has been received by the college. 
The SMC Committee on Physical Requirements called the recre­:ttion facility in February 1974. 
fhe facility has been in the 
planning stages since then. , 
Architect C.J. Murphy of Chi­cago will design the facility. His firm will present a progress report· to the college's Board of Regents this week. 
"We're anxious to begin con­struction on this building," Dug­gan said. "We'd like to break ground before the students leave for summer break.'' 
The Haggar Foundation and The 
Kresge Foundation donated major gifts for the recreation facility. Haggar Foundation, Dallas, Texas, awarded $150,000 to St. Mary's. Kresge Foundation awarded a $50,000 challenge grant to the college. . 
Major pledges were obtamed from Michiana businesses and corporations. "The College has received funds from St. Joseph Bank, Indiana Bell, Indiana and Michigan Electric and Valley Bank of Mishawaka," Duggan said. 
First Bank and Trust of South Bend, South Bend Tribune and several anonymous donors have also contributed to the fund along with American National BAnk, National Bank, Excel Foundation of Elkart, Whitner Service, Koontz Wagner, South Bend Vending and Osthimer Printing.

This Friday, Saturday, and Sun­
"~y mark the three final days this 
r of Mardi Gras, an annual

Sophia program still open to frosh 
by Don Reimer Senior Staff Reporter 

Dr. Charles Parnell, Business Dean Bro. Leo Ryan and Fr. George Minimiki explained Sophia Sophmore year abroad program to a group of 12 interested students last night at an informational meeting in the Hayes-Healy Buil­ding. 
Sophia University, located in Tokyo, Japan, is a Jesuit institution which is completely integrated into the Japanese univerisity system. Notre Dame students who attend Sophia University are in the Inter­national Division, where courses are offered for international stu­dents of all nationalities. 
The study of a language during the freshman year at Notre Dame is not a requirment for participation in the Sophia program, accordin~ to Parnell, director of the Foreign Studies Program. 
He noted that several students had gone to Japan in past years without having studied the lan­guage here and after several months they begin to learn enough 
language to get around success­fully Minimiki, who teaches the Jap­anese language course at Notre 
Dame, said that while "it is better to get some preparation" he knows some students who went over without taking a course before hand and came back to the United States and continued to study Japanese with great desire. 
Tokyo "big city" 

Another factor that eases the problems for a student who does not speak Japanese is the "big city" atmosphere of Tokyo. All Japanese take English in secondary school, Minimki explained, and one can usually find someone who speaks English. 
One student who participated in the program last year and did not take the language here at Notre Dame noted that "you pick it up really fast." "The Japanese people are very cordial," he said, "and they make an effort to understand the foreign students." He said that the Japanese consider it a compliment if you can speak their language at all. 
Minimiki also noted that because one uses the things immediately that are learned in class it is much easier to develop a facilty in speaking. 
"Developments in business in 

'Fr. Hesburgh appeared at the Mock Stock Market last Monday, opening day. The market, which runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday, will be open for trading the next three weeks. Stocks are purchased with play-money, available for $1 per $10,000. At the end of the trading period, monetary prizes will be awarded for the three best traders. (Photo by Chris Smith) 
TINO photo exhibits to open 
A reception for two major exhibit­ions currently on display in the Notre Dame Art Gallery are sche­duled for 2 p.m. Sun., Feb. 15. 
"The History of Notre Dame in Art and Photographs" and "Photo­graphs by Walker Evans" are part of the year-long Bicentennial Cele­bration of the gallery, located in O'Shaughnessy Hall. 
Dr. Thomas Schlereth, assistant professor of American Studies author of a newly-published book, The University of Notre Dame: A 
Portrait of Its History and Campus, will be and honored guest at the . reception and will autograph copies 
of his book. 
Also expected to attend the 
reception is Harry Lunn, owner 
ofthe New York galleries where the 
historical photographic records of 
Evans are retained. 
Several major American paint­
ings in the permanent collection of 
the Notre Dame Gallery or recently 
acquired from contemporary artists 
are on display during the year. 
Japan are significant for the world economy." stated Business Deam Ryan, in encouraging business students to consider the program. "There is muc interaction between the U.S. and Japan." 
For these reasons Ryan felt that it would be a very valuable exper­ience to see the economy of another culture, Japan's, in action. Be­sides the value in understanding the increasingly important Jap­anese business world, Ryan felt that lack of a Freshman year language requirement made this program especially suited to busi­ness students. 
Parnell called meeting 
Parnell noted that he had called the meeting partly with the hope of interesting business students be­cause it was the only program still open to them and he cannot contact them through the language classes. 
Presently, Parnell noted, five of the eight students in Japan are business students. 
One business student who spent this past year in Japan noted that Japanese businessmen are very eager to make U.S. contacts and will often take American business students out to dinner.

Head-on crash kills 4, injures 2 
WAUSION, Ohio AP -A team of federal investigators will probe Thursday's head-on train crash which killed four Penn Central freight crewmen and injured two others. The two-man team is headed by Elmer Garner, who along with Harold E. Storey, was sent from Washington D.C. to the site of the accident, about 35 miles west of Toledo. 
The trains, which should have been on separate tracks, were carrying general freight and col­lided in a rural area between Wauseon and Archbold. The dead were identified by authorities as W.H. Davis, 42,' of Toledo; Eugene 0. Fuller, 60, of Brooklyn, Mich.; Robert E. Green, 60, of Elkhart, Ind., and Page E. Spray II, 30, also of Elkhart Ind. 
Injured in the collision were Billy 
J. Fuson, 44, of Waldridge, Ohio, brakeman on the westbound train, and Howard W. Phillips, 56, of 
· Maumee, Ohio, conductor on th east-bound train, according to Penn Central spokesman Howard Gilbert. He said Fuson managed to jumb from the engine seconds before impact. Phillips was riding in the caboose at the time. Phillips and Fuson were listed in good condition at the Fulton Coun­ty Health Center in Wauseon. 
Gilbert said three other crew­men, who were at the rear of the trains, escaped injury.

local population. 
The academic year at Sophia 
consists of two normallenth semes­
ters and a short six week session 
and affords the opportunity for a 
maximum of 36 credits. Students 
leave the United States in the end 
of August and are free to return to 
the U.S. by June 1. 
Besides the language courses, 
courses in Japanese History, Cul­
ture and literature are offered. 
The students who had already spent the year in Japan empha­sized the opportunities for travel and entertainment in Tokyo itself. "it is very easy to travel," com­mented one student. "There are trains and hostels all over.'' There is also a great variety in climate in Japan ranging from heavy snows in the Northern islands to almost tropical climates to the South. 
Students may also travel to other Oriental countries. One can get to Korea, for instance, for only about $30. 
Program Initiated by He&blll'gh 
In 1966 while Fr. Theodore 
' Hesburgh was in Tokyo for a conference at Sophia University, explained Minimiki who was also there at the time, he commented, "that it would be fine if we (N.D.) had a program in Tokyo." 
Within one year a program was begun and in the first year 20 students participated in it. Several years later while Minimiki was studying here at Notre Dame he was approached and asked to teach a course in Japanese to the participants in the program. 
The present director of the program is Rev. Jose M. deVera. S.J., who is also the executive vice president of Sophia University. 
Any freshmen who are interested in the program and have not yet contacted Parnell should do so in room 303 O'Shaughnessy Hall.

explained. 
While the evaluation centers on 
student life, academic programs 
and fauclty, other areas are also 
included. Hickey noted that things 
such as the number of volumes in 
the library, construction of the 
activities center and student gov­
ernment contribute to the quality 
of education. 
Asked if the evaluation and recommendations might result in any major changes at St. Mary's, Hickey replied, "No major changes are expected. More of what we're doing now and strengthening some programs will be about the extent of it." 
Hickey summarized his view on the reaccreditation evaluation. "The whole process involves an in-depth look at St. Mary's. It's other institutions helping an insti­tution to look at itself. I think we have every right to be confident.''

students receive financial support 
byTomByme Staff Reporter 

Approximately 2800 students re­
quested financial aid this year and 
almost all received some form of 
assistance, according to June 
McCauslin, director of the office of 
Financial Aid. 
However, while requests for this 
aid have been increasing, the 
capacity of the University to res­
pond to them in the form of grants 
has not, and sizeable proportions of 
students have been forced to resort 
to loans. 
"We have a static amount of aid 
here," explained McCauslin. "We 
can't take out of current income to 
finance scholarships." 
Although it is frequently pro­claimed that 55 percent of the Notre Dame student body is receiv­ing some sort of financial aid, the figure is somewhat deceiving be­cause it includes employment and loans as forms of financial aid. 
"The amount of gift aid is less here than at some other universi­ties, although the percentage of students being assisted in some 
Patty observes 
'Tania' movie 

SAN FRANCISCO--(AP)--Patricia 
Hearst watched on a darkened 
screen a silent movie of an 
armed "Tania" wearing a wig 
inside the bank she is accused of 
helping to rob. 
The movie, pieced together by 
the government from still photos 
taken by a bank camera, showed 
Miss Hearst brandishing a carbine 
at customers who tried to enter the 
Hibernia Bank branch while mem­
bt.'rs of the Symbionese Liberation 
Army staged their hold-up. 
The film runs slightly less than 
two minutes. 
The defense contends the heiress 
was in the bank as an unwilling 
captive, but two of her former 
underground companions, Bill and 
Emily Harris, said in Los Angeles 
Thursday that Miss Hearst was a 
strong and assertive" comrade who 
stayed with the SLA after her 
kidnap "based on her own initia­
tive and free choice." 
Meanwhile, the Chicago Tribune 
reported Thursday that Miss 
Hearst was given a chance to 
return to her parents about a month 
after her kidnapping by the SLA. 

Income tax help to begin in area 
Over 200 Notre Dame students 
with special knowledge of income 
tax regulations will resume their 
annual assistance program for fam­
ilies of low income at eight South 
Bend area locations, Feb. 7. 
The free service, now in its fifth 
year, will be continued through the 
April15, filing deadline. 
The neighborhood centers and the hours of operation for the tax program include Northeast Neigh­borhood Center, Mondays, 5 to 8 p.m.; Clay Neighborhood Center, Tuesdays, 5 to 8 p.m.; LaSalle Neighborhood Center, Wednes­days, 5 to 8 p.m.; Southeast Center, Mondays, 5 to 8 p.m.; Meadowbrook Center, Wednesday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Hansel Neigh­borhood Center, Tuesdays and Thursdays, 5 to 9 p.m.; and Senior Citizen Center, Fridays, 10 a.,. to noon. 
In addition, certified public ac­countants will be on duty at Hansel Neighborhood center Thursdays from b to 8 p.m. 
Spanish-speaking students will work at LaRaza Center Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and certified public accountants will be there Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Directed by James A. Laurie, graduate student in the College of Business Administration, the pro­gram is designed to reduce the amount of taxes paid or to generate refunds for more than a thousand families.

Letters to a Lonely God 

aprohibitiue word 
Reverend Robert Griffin 


Being a member of the Roman Catholic 
Church is like being adopted as the child of 
a quaint, strange, eccentric, rather marvel­
lous old lady who is gossiped about 
maliciously by all the best people in the 
neighborhood. In addition to you, she is 
the mother to a great brood of children 
who are always quarreling among themsel­
ves, and who are apt to pick a fight with the 
policeman or the mayor, or with those well-
intentioned ladies of fashion who, swoop­
ing down on uncared-for street urchins, are 
thoughtful enough to want to help them 
wipe their runny noses. Our mother-figure 
is too outrageous to be fashionable except 
occasionally, when, in the rush of passing 
fads, she becomes accidentally elegant 
because everyone is dressing mediaevally 
and nun-like that season. With the coming 
of bikinis in the summer, she is dowdy 
again, and a frump to be Iau~'l\ed at until 
the next time around, when, like a stopped 
clock, she will be right for the second time 
that day. 
Our mother, then, is the strange, 
seemingly mad woman who lives down the 
block in the biggest, strangest house of the town. People snicker at that house for being a museum used for storing junk. "It's full of trash," they say, "That should have been thrown out a century ago." They will stare at the house as though it were full of cats, and they wonder why the lightning doesn't strike it and burn it down as an offense to heaven. Our Mother, standing at an upstairs window, shouts at them to come in. Some of the people do come in, and they love the comfort of Greek swimming pools and Jewish cooking. The people outside merely shake their heads. "It's a flophouse full of foreigners," they say, because they can see the Avignon draperies and pipes of Galway through the 
windows. 
The fascinating thing about eccentric old ladies is how they continue to survive. Take our mother, for example. Amidst the rumors of who she is sleeping with, where she gets her money from, and how she is supported, the news has come at least a half dozen times that she is dead. Suddenly, she shows up again, and it is evident that she is sporting with vigor. Again and again, she has been escorted to the edge of town, given bus fare, and told never to show her face there again. But when the vigilantes return to their homes, they find that the lights are on in the strange old house, there's a party in 
and our mother is leading the
process, and wholesome as a grandmother rebuking

The best of the TV premiere movies this week is A Touch of Oass, starring Glenda Jackson and George Segal.

The last two installments were excellent and exception-quadrille. 
Perhaps it is tasteless to compare the Church with the dowager ladies in strange hats who have acquired a reputation for being naughty. Perhaps saying this is borrowing too heavily from the imagery of her enemies, who have never hesitated to call her the whore of Babylon fornicating with the kings of the earth. Like any faithful son, I do affirm my mother's virtue despite the fact that she is so visible in the children who know themselves to be her Human Element, making her seem shabby with sin. At times, the Church seems to be only the Human Element, and even the best of our Element seems worthy of hanging ... with the exception of people like Mother Teresa and Pope John XXIII, and some nuns that I know of, and everybody's mother including yours and mine. But there is also the Church as a ministry of healing, and a ministry of sanctifying, and ministry of redeeming, and as a ministry of teaching; all these ministries belong to the Human Element also, but God is in their midst like breathing. In all our brokenness, we are nourished as infants who are breast-fed on grace, and the gentleness of God and the various ministries together are exper­ienced as a cherishing whose fitting metaphor is that of a mother watching over a nursery. 
A couple of weeks ago, the dowager lady of Christianity made a fool of herself again: a document was issued in Rome affirming the traditional moral viewpoint that the exercise of sexual rights should occur within the context of marriage. It was not a new teaching, nothing that I had never heard before. That is why it seemed so wild, so outrageous,so deliciously impudent. We have so many infallible opinions on this point, all of them contradicting the tradition. Actresses give us their opinion, and sometimes their experiences, nightly on television talk shows. Novelists give us their opinion in plots exploring the last clinical detail. Comedians give us their opinion in the idiom of leer and smut. Even the President's wife gives us her opinion; she's entitled to, and I don't like her less for it, though 1 would prefer a world that is more reticent with its sexual viewpoint.

I don't know that the last word of the Church is ever spoken in a Vatican document; that is a point I must leave to the theologians. I don't know that the last word on human sexuality will ever be spoken as long as man is a mystery in search of his depth. 
But no matter how the terms of the document are negotiated in favor of freedom, I know that our mother has spoken, telling us something precious about ourselves. It is not always easy to listen to an old-fashioned voice, but when I think of some of the other voices I have heard lately, I hear words from the Church full of caring and truth. If I am tempted to say, "Oh come now, nobody thinks like that any more," I answer myself: "The Church thinks like that." It's outrageous, of course, and a little embarrasing, but I'm not going to apologize for her.

Notre Dame basketball now seen in footlights 
by Fred Herbst Staff Reporter 

This year, for the first time, Notre Dame is enjoying the nation­al exposure afforded a school having a majority of its basketball games nationally televised. 
With the National Broadcasting Company televising four Notre Dame games nationally and the Spoelstra Sports NetWor}.l. carrying sixteen games, the Irish wl.H, appear on national television twenty tqnes this season. This is not includibg any NCAA tournament games that Notre Dame may participate in. 
The television exposure, far more than any other university in the nation receives, is viewed favorably by Irish Head Coach Richard "Digger" Phelps. "I feel that the television coverage we're getting is excellent," he said. "The more exposure that college basketball gets, the better for all of us." 
Fr. Edmund Joyce, vice presi­dent of the University and in charge of athletics, ·is also pleased with the coverage provided by the two networks. "I know that our alumni and friends are delighted at being able to watch the team,'' he said. "It's important that the alumni across the country have the opportunity to see the team play." 
Despite the extensive coverage 

given he basketball team, little 
money made through it. "We 
don't look upon television revenue 
as being significant," Joyce said. 
"It's not very important financial­
ly" 
While no exact figures are 

available, Joyce stated that the 
University receives approximatey 
$2,000 a game from the Spoelstra 
Network. The amount received 
form NBC a game is undetermined. 
This to $250,000 received for every Notre Dame football game appearing on national television. 
The added exposure of the basketball team and the success of the team under Phelps will have no bearing on alumni contributions for the current year, according to Joyce. "There is absolutely no relationship between athletic suc­cess and alumni donations," Joyce said. "In fact, some of our best years for alumni donations were when Joe Kucharich was football coach here and we had some of our worst teams." 
Unlike football, television ap­pearances for college basketball teams are not regulated by the NCAA. Instead, a network simply buvs the rights to a particular game from the home school. 

The increased television expo­sure seems to have had little affect on the team itself. ''Television doesn't affect the way we play," Phelps said. "We go out and play hard in every game, whether it's on televison or not." 
Phelps states that it's still im­possible to tell if the national exposure will help recruiting. However he notes that he has ten underclassmen on the team and that even the nationwide publicity may not be enough to lure a high school player to Notre Dame, knowing that he probably won't be able to play immediately. 
The head coach did note that the 
team's increased popularity, due to 
the increased exposure and the

Figures released on quake victims 
Guatemala City, Guatemala 
AP -The estimate of casualties in Guatemala's devastating earthquake was increased by of­ficials Thursday to 3,000 dead and about 15,000 injured. 
Col. Guillermo Echeverria Vie­lams, duty coordinator at a special emergency committee set up by the Defense Ministry, reported the new figures Thursday night and said that more than 10,000 persons were left homeless. 
Echeverria said the figures might increase further as com­
munications  were  improved  and  
more  reports  came  in  from  the  
countryside.  

The committee coordinator said a preliminary survey earlier in the day showed three out of four

communities in this mountainous agricultural nation of six million people suffered damage in the ,earthquake that struck Wednes­
day. 
He said approxiamately half the buildings in Guatemala City, which has a population of 11/1million, were damaged to some degree. 
In the capital, firemen buried scores of earthquake victims in a mass grave outside a hospital morgue. At the city cemetary, survivors lined up bearing coffins of relatives and friends. Many coffin makers ran out of wood. 
What reports are available from the interior told of widespread devastation from the quake, which struck along a 2,000-mile strip of Central America and Mexico, with the main force in Guatemala. 
Reports from Antigua, the 16th century capital 15 miles away, indicated serious damage. The city was still isolated. Food prices skyroc'ked as supplies dwindled. Autho  .._:.~s tried to head off mass statvation. 
President Kjell Eugenio Laugerud ordered immediate dis­tribution of food and medicine coming in on relief flights. Massive U.S. disaster relief assis­tance was sent to Guatemala Thursday

To fill the void which many students experience between Mardi Gras and An Toastal Week­end, the Notre Dame and St. Mary's Social Commissions will sponsor the second annual "Wacky Winter Weekend" on Fri. and Sat. Feb. 20 and 21. 
The weekend will start Friday night with what Notre Name Social Commissioner Kathy Smouse re­ferred to as a "disco dance" in Stepan Center. Planning the dance is largely the responsibility of the St. Mary's Social Commission, and admission is free for all students. 
Music for the dance will be recorded rather than live, in order to provide a more informal atmos­phere, Smouse said. 
An Armory dance which was originally planned for that weekend has been cancelled due to state­wide Army maneuvers scheduled for that time. 
Outdoor activities will take place on Saturday in the general area of Holy Cross Hall and St. Mary's Lake. 
Tentatively scheduled are ice skating, tobogganing, a tug-of-war,

Irish open homestand with Davidson 
by Fred Herbst 

Notre Dame will open a four-game homestand tomorrow afternoon as the Davidson Wildcats invade the ACC. 
Davidson enters their game with the Irish with a 5-15 slate and is coming off a 75-62 loss to Appala­chian State that eliminated them from any hope of a first division finish in the Southern Conference. 
Freshman guard John Gerdy leads the Wildcats in scoring, hitting for 16.8 points per game. Along with Gerdy in the starting lineup are two other freshmen, Jim Rice at forward and 7'2" Tom Dore at center. Seniors Eppa Rixey and Jay Powell round out the starting lineup at forard and guard respec­tively. Freshmen Pat Hickert and Tom Jorgensen are Davidson's top reserves.

ND icers to play Pioneers 
By Tom K,ruczek 

The Notre Dame hockey team this weekend travels to the beauti­ful country of Colorado for a two game series against Denver. The Pioneers are 8-14 in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association and are tied foreighthplace with North Dakota. The Irish are 10-10-2 in the league and tied for fifth with last week's opponent Colorado Col­lege. 
This weekend will be a must series for both squads. The Irish are needing a big push so they can move into the coveted top four spots in the league giving them a home ice advantage to open the play-offs. It will be very beneficial to the Irish to sweep the series, because the Pioneers will be one of the two easier teams left on the schedule. 
Easy, however has to be quali-

Rixey and Powell follow Gerdy in scoring for the Wildcats, scoring 
11.3 and 10.0 points per game respectively. Dore and Rice are the team's leading rebounders pulling down five a game. 
. , Davtdson s youth has. been ap­
paren~ thus far, as the Wtld~ats are suffertn~ thr.ough one ofthetr worst seasons m htstory. However, Head 
Coach Bo Brickels is pleased with the progress shown by his team. "We've shown definite signs of improvement over the last couple of weeks," he said. "We've lost some close ones and beat a pretty good Santa Barbara team. But it's not enough to show improvement and lose close games." 
The basketball program at Da­vidson has fallen upon hard times, last season compiling a 7-19 record. Prior to that, the Wildcats had not had a losing season since 1960, "Lefty" Driesell's first season as 
tied in that this weekend will be played in high-altitude Denver. The Irish will run 45 second shifts, instead of the usual minute and 15 second shifts, and will find out the difficulties of high-altitude athle­tics. 
Denver also must win both ends of the series because they are precariously close to being elimin­ated from the play-offs. North Dakota will be playing Minnesota­Duluth this weekend, and if Dakota wins twice, and Denver loses twice, the Pioneers chances of making the post-season tourney will be greatly reduced. 
The Pioneers are coming off two straight 5-2 defeats at the hands of league leading Michigan Tech. Coach Murry Armstrong of Denver reflects that the coming weekend will have great importance for both teams. "I don't think it's any secret that the Notre Dame series

N?tre Dame ts ent~nng tomor­ro": s contest on the wmgs of one of thetr better performances of the season when they tro~nce~ LaS~lle 108-89 Wednesday mght tn Phtla­delphia. The Irish have won eight out of their last nine games, losing only to Maryland, and have a season's mark of 13-4. 
Brickels realizes that his Wild­cats are facing a hot team. "Notre Dame is a great basketball team," he said. "I don't know if anybody has a player who can really stop Adrian Dantley." 
Dantley, whose 41 points against LaSalle moved him within 660 points of Austin Carr's school· scoring record, is the nation's fifth-ranked scorer in the latest NCAA statistics averaging 29.1 points per game. Duck Williams follows Dantley in scoring, averag­ing 10.1 points per contest. 
The All-American forward also continues to lead the Irish in rebounding pulling down 9.4 car­oms per game. Toby Knight is the team's second leading rebounder grabbing 6.6 a game. 
Davidson has met the Irish only twice before, losing both contests. Last year the Irish beat the Wildcats 89-73 in Charlotte. 
Tomorrow's tilt will be televised on the Spoelstra Sports Network, and will be carried locally by Channel16, WNDU-TV. The game will also be broadcast on WNDU, WSND and WSBT radio. Tip-off is scheduled for 1 p.m. 
here this weekend is very crucial. We need to sweep this series to keep in the playoff picture. Notre Dame has been playing good hockey the past couple of weeks and they also need the wins." 
Denver will be relying on two freshmen for their major scoring punch. Doug Berry and Alex Belcourt have collected 13 points each since the Christmas break, 11 games back. Berry has tallied two goals and 11 assists in the span while Belcourt has managed three goals and ten assists since return­ing to the ice. Belcourt was sidelined for nine Pioneer games with an injury and has 20 points in the 17 contests he has played. Berry has 22 points in 26 games so far this season. 
In goal for the Pioneers will be Ernie Glanville who has a 4.3 goals against average. Glanville ran into problems last Saturday against Tech. In the warm-ups prior to the game, he was knocked cold by a shot taken by a teammate. He started the game, then injured his leg in a collision in the second period, recovered and finished the game with 33 saves. 
The Irish will be operating with the same squad from last weekend. 
Tim Byers is still troubled by a knee injury and will miss action again this weekend but is expected to be back for Michigan Tech next week. Len Moher and John Peterson will again split the goal­keeping chores. Peterson is com­ing off an excellent game against Colorado College, turning away 23 shots in the Irish 3-1 victory. 
Earlier in the year, the Irish and Denver split at the ACCwith Notre Dame winning the Friday game 5-2 on two goals each by Clark Hamil­ton and Kevin Nugent. On Saturday, goalie Jim Bales stopped 38 shots in the Pioneer 4-1 win. 
In other WCHA action this weekend, Michigan Tech takes on Michigan at Houghton, Michigan. The Wolverines are third in the conference. In addition second place Minnesota takes on fourth place Michigan State, and Colorado College faces last place Wisconsin.
