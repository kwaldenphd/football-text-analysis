In a nationally broadcast news conference, Ford said he expects to "do well" in forthcoming Republican presidential primaries in New Hampshire and Florida. 
Ford specifically cited his philosophical differences with c~:mservative former Gov. Ronald Reagan of California, his chief nval for the GOP presidential nomination. 
Baseball to return to Seattle 
EVERETT, Wash.--The Seattle baseball trial was adjourned in Superior Court Tuesday, clearing the final legal obstacle to the return of American League play to the city. 
Judge Frank Howard told the nine-woman, three-man jury that they were dismissed, although the $32.5 million lawsuit will remain on the books until April1977. 
That is when an American League expansion team is to begin play. When it does, the settlement calls for the suit to be dismissed.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -Patricia Hearst; resuming her testimony at her bank robbery trial, said today her terrorist kidnappers. planned to kill her and fight it out if any of their hideouts were surrounded by federal agents. 
Speaking firmly and with no visible trace of emotion, Miss Hearst said that Symbionese Liber­ation Army leader Donald "Cin­que" DeFreeze had told her of an incident in Oakland a day or two after her Feb. 4, 1974 abduction in which the FBI stormed a house where they suspected she was being held captive. 
"Cinque told me they would have killed me and fought it out with the FBI if we had been in the house," Miss Hearst said. "He said they would never have surren­dered." 
Her chief attorney, F. Lee Hai­ley, then began asking her questio­ns about a closet she and her jury saw on a tour Monday of two SLA "safe houses" where the young heiress was held captive. 
The defendant has testified that her first taped "communique" was made from a closet in a house in suburban Daly City a few days after her kidnapping. She said today that DeFreeze and other SLA members then left her more or less alone until-they ordered her to make a second tape, received Feb. 12, in which the SLA issued a demand for $70 worth of food for each of California's needy. 
Clad in a navy blue pants suit with large white bow, Miss Hearst testified that she was kept blindfol­ded except when allowed to go to the toilet and take an occasional 
bath. 
She said an SLA member was always present when her blindfold was off, but was wearing a ski mask. 
Miss Hearst began relating her story of captivity by the SLA in her first witness stand appearance before her jury on Friday. That was followed by the tour Monday of the terrorist hideouts. 
The seven women and five men of the jury -11 whites and one Asian-American -also heard Miss Hearst describe the pain she endured while locked in tiny closets in the "safe houses" the panel viewed Monday. 
A blindfold tied over her eyes pressed down on her left cheek, which had been smacked by a gun butt during her kidnapping, she said. 
"It was really sore and it would press down on it so that I could always feel it because the blindfold was pressing on it," she said. 

Sociology majors to meet

It is imperative that stu\lent input is gathered at this meting concerning next semester's course offerings and the upcoming Alpha Kappa Delta (AKD, sociology hon­or society) sponsored Lonvention.

In between her recitations, jurors heard the tape recorded voices of Miss Hearst's captors, used by the defense to support her statements. 
They heard DeFreeze speaking of revolution and demanding that Miss Hearst's father, newspaper executive Randolph Hearst, feed the poor. 
In the final tape played at the 

morning session, Miss Hearst also 
declared, "I hope you will not think 
that I've been brainwashed or 
tortured into saying this." 
Seated in the front row of the courtroom as the tape played were three defense psychiatrists who will take the stand to support defense contentions that Miss Hearst indeed was brainwashed. 
Miss Hearst is expected to remain on the stand Wednesday for further testimony and cross-exami­nation. Her lawyers say they may rest their case early next week.

(continued from page 1) Sweigart proposes to set up a "bond fund" for students arrested for under-age drinking in Indiana. "A sum of money would best be set aside to be used as personal loans to help students post bond when arrested," he stated. "We want to shorten their stay in jail," Sweigart commented. Gassman intends to work with the Academic Council and the Business College to eliminate ov­er-crowding in the College of Business. Gassman also hopes to follow up work on the COUL report, to publish a manual of Student Gov­ernment services, to work for further involvement with the Board of Trustees and to give the Hall Judicial Boards more responsibility regarding such aspects as party rules and parietals. Running for Vice-President with Tim Boyle is Peter Gaa. Boyle and Gaa were unavailable for comment.

Poems for China 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii art buchwaI d 
WASHINGTON--Former President Richard Nixon is preparing for his trip to the People's Republic of China. I wonder if he will write any poems for Mao Tse-tung. Here are a few for Mr. Nixon in case he doesn't have the time. 
Once again I stand at the Great Wall made from centuries of stone. Confucius says, "Those who stone wall will receive a thousand pardons." 
The Chinese greet me with open arms and throw pink rose petals at my feet. Why do all forsake me, save the Teamsters and the Red Guard? 
If winter has come to cold Peking Can David Frost be far behind? 
The wind blows across the Forbidden City The earth groans and twists while ice-laden Rivers rush down to meet the sea. A cloud crosses the sky. I wonder how much money Rabbi Korff has raised for me in Toledo? 
I sit in the Great Hall feasting on Peking duck. How good it is compared to San Clemente crow. 
I can testify to the beauty of China I can testify to the goodness of Mao I can testify to the greatness of Chou I can testify to the wisdom of Teng But I can't testify in Washington, D.C. Because my health forbids me to travel. 
Why have I come back to this strange land Shrouded in mystery and silence? Cloaked in a thousand secrets Of ten thousand years or more? Because it beats the devil out of Writing my book. 
I have seen peasants work with their hoes I have seen steelworkers work with their backs I have seen dockworkers work with their shoulders I have seen women work with their men. Yet I have not seen one person in all China Ask me what was on the 18 minutes of Rosemary's tape. 
The hawk flies across the sky Waiting to swoop down and make its kill. Trees sway in the wind and watch and wait As tiny birds sing sad songs of yesterday. So why won't the Supreme Court Give me back my personal papers? 
While the IRS tries to hnd chinks in my taxes The Chinese find only peace in my heart. 
As night falls over the Yangtze And a wolf cries out in Tibet The fires of the sun become embers And the embers become ashes. And from the ashes a great man will rise again. I'll bet you can't guess who it will be?

Simpson was educated at Munro College in Jamaica. Coming to the United States at the age of seventeen, he continued his studies at Columbia University, leaving to serve in the U.S. Army where he received a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. He returned to graduate in 1948, and obtained his Ph.D in 1959. 
From 1950-1955, Simpson held the position of editor with the Hobbs-Merrill Publishing Company. He later became a professor of English, teaching at Columbia University, the University of California at Berkely, and currently, the State Universi­ty of New York at Stony Brook. 
His six volumes of poetry and other writings have brought him recognition as one of America's most important younger men of letters. Among his works are The Arrivistes (1949), Good News of Death

Kozol: Vehemence in the face of uniformity 


"School is a consumer fraud. It advertis­es education. What it offers is indoctrina­tion. Its function is not to educate humane and decent people, but safe citizens ­manageable voters, manipulable consume­rs and, if need be, in the case of war or crisis, willing killers." So writes Jonathon Kozol. in his latest book, The Night is Dark and I am Far from Home. It is a deeply disturbing book, in which Kozol attempts to scrutinize and dissect the causes of our nation's seeming anesthesia in the face of Absolute Evil. How, exactly, he asks, does our public education render us !ncapable of comprehension, and prevention, of. the murders and atrocities that are commttted in our name? 
He sees public education as by no means inept, disordered and misconstructed. Just the opposite. "It is an ice-cold a~d superb machine ... It is only if we try to he and tell ourselves that the true purpose of a school is to inspire ethics, to provoke irreverence or to stimulate a sense of outrage at injustice and despair, that we are able to evade the fact that public school is a spectacular device, flawed beyond ques­tion, but effective beyond dreams. The problem is not that public schools do not work well, but that they do." 
A graduate of Harvard and a Rhoses Scholar, Jonathan Kozol taught in the Boston public schools in the early '60's ­only to be fired for his civil rights beliefs. He described this experience in Death at an Early Age, which won the Nationa~ ~ook Award in 1968. One year later Kozol Jotned the parents of his former students to create one of the first successful Free Schools in the nation. In the years since, he has consistently rejected academic jobs, in order to work at the grass-roots level. After speaking out beside black leaders to endorse court-ordered integration of the Boston schools in 1974, he was forced to leave his home in face of threats upon hi~ life. 
His latest book will hardly restore him to favor. It is a document of almost unabated indignaiton; and this time his target is the education of the children of the rich. Kozol believes that the slumlord's daughter ought to be obliged to know the misery and squalor, rats and stench her life is built upon. the bank director's child, the foreign investment analyst's son, ought to know well, beyond all respite and all hesitation, the barbarism that their food, tuition, clothes and charge accounts are built upon. The "privileged children of an unjust social order need to be disturbed, amazed and shaken by the consequences of the unjust privilege by which they live." . 
Kozol visited public schools in approxi­mately forty cities, coast to coast, and 
· concluded that nine-tenths of the present literature of school reform is either naive or dishonest. Innovations that amount to nothing more than "open" classrooms, gerbil cages and bright paint are insubsta­ntial. Their only function, he claims, is "to make the prison cells more pleasant -and the bars less visible." 
Kozol charges public education with sinister purpose. He insists that children do not go to school "for their own good," but for something referred to as "their nation's good." They go to school, he claims, to learn how not to interrupt the evil patterns that they see before them, how not to question and how not to doubt: to learn to vote with reasonable regularity, to kill on orders and to sleep eight hours 
Nidtolsoll mes high as 'Cuckoo' leads Oscar race 
LOS ANGELES (AP) --One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the movie nobody wanted, and four-time loser Jack Nicholson who starred in it, moved forward as favorites for the 48th Academy Awards as nominations were announced Tuesday. 
Cuckoo's Nest took nine nominations and Nicholson was nominated as Best Actor of 1975 for his performance in it as the fast-talking ringleader of mental hospi­tal rebellion. 
Prevwusly nominated in four earlier films, Nicholson faces competition from two former Oscar winners: Walter Matthau, nominated for The Sunshine Boys, and Maximilian Schell for The Man ln the Glass Booth. 
Now the final campaigning begins, with the winners to be announced at the Los Angeles Music Center on March 29. ABC will televise the presentations. 

the End of the Open Road (1963), Selected Poems (1965), and Adventures of the Letter I (1971). His most recent work, entitled Three on the Tower, is a study of the lives and works of the poets Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, and William Carlos Williams. 
Louis Simpson writes of many subjects; war, love, American landscape, history. His poetry has been acclaimed for its emotional range and superb lyrical and narrative qualities. His poems about World War II are considered modern classics. The landscapes of which he writes are as much those of the mind as those of the earth. One critic comments, "So involved in the American writer's traditional search for a specifically Ameri­can mode of experience is Louis Simpson, that it is hard to remember that he was in fact born in Jamaica." Yet, he also writes of the universal experience: 
It was in the time otvilla When they put me on triai­"Tell us, what is it you do exactly To justify your existence? 
Of his writing, Sompson comments, "What I think of the art of writing is implied by the works I have written. I don't belong to any particular group or school of poets. I try to tell the truth as I see it, and in poems to do this with pleasure." 
"Most poetry is mere fantasy, most prose is merely reporting the surface of things. WE are still waiting for the poetry 
of feeling, words as common as a loaf of bread, which yet give off vibrations." 
And the people who say, 'Tell us, What is it you do exactly to justify your esixtence?'

I think he was happy, on his street.

"Emotional intensity--this, as far as I can tell, is what poetry consists of. A poem will move from one moment of intensity to another, and there will be a connection. This, I suppose, is where 1 part company with surrealism, and with some of my contemporaries--they don't care about the connection, don't feel a need to get a line into their work." "I think that the object of writing is to make words disappear." 
... The land is within. At the end of the open road we come to ourselves. 
Louis Simpson has been the recipient of many awards and honors, among them the 1964 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, a Prix de Rome, Hudson REview and Guggenheim fellowships, and the Millay Award. He has been published in a variety of magazines and is active on the reading circuit. 

without-grief. They go to school to learn to be proficient at mechanical procedures, docile in the presence of all processes they do not understand, acquiescent in the presence of a seeming barbarism. "It is not so much that they learn to be cPuel people," he writes. "Rather it is, they learn it is not needful to be urgent in compassion or importunate in justice. Not positive desolation, but a genial capability for well-behaved abstention in the prese­nce of despair: this is the innocence we teach our children." 
Some may consider Kozol's book a treatise on public education, others, as a work on ethics. Many others, however, will brand it a straightforward manifesto of the most dangerous type -a real menace to the . country. It's not hard to discover why his book, so unrelenting in its attack, stimulat­es such vehement reaction. 
Kozol charges public schools with a certain type of psychological warfare. He states that students are carefully isolated from any consideration that there are any victims in the world. "To believe in victims," he says, "is to believe, as well in victimizers. It is to be forced to come inlp the presence of the whole idea that there must be oppressors in the world for there to be oppressed. It is to be forced, as well, to feel, and understand, that bad results too often have bad causes, that evil acts don't just 'occur' -like mushrooms after rain -but have most often been initiated by the will of those who stand to profit from them."

"The recognition of direct, explicit and 
l' 

not accidental causes and connections of j 
this kind," Kozol continues, "portends enormous danger for the conscience of the children of rich people. It is of great importance for the children of the ruli!tg class, in a divided social order such as thts, to be allowed to think of fear, starvation, sickness, in the terms of social accident or technological mistake; to think of hunger, for example, or the lack of medical care, like a season with too little rainfall, or a ,river that did not come up as high as usual this year. It is not comfortable to underst· and that the reason rivers do net rise as high as usual some years is that they have been diverted to the fields and irrigation ditches of another person in the upper meadow. It is even more disturbing to be forced to understand that oftentimes tha1 other person is no stranger, but our friend 
our next-door neighbor or our father." 
Well, that should be enough of a sampl of Kozol's thesis to convince us that hi book will not be well received behind th ivy-covered walls of our public institutio~ of higher learning. Kozol, we suspect, wtl be declared a dangerous man, and his treatise a pernicious scourge. 
Here at Notre Dame, we take some comfort in know1ng that he is talking about publl(' education, not Catholic schoola. But, deep down, something nags at us; and we know that to dismiss his challenges as totaly irrelevant for us, unworthy of some honest soul-searching, might be the most tlangerous thing of all.

Palestinian kills American in Beirut· 


BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -An expelled Palestinian student carry . ing a pistol and two hanti·grenades assassinated an American dean and his Lebanese colleague Tues­day at the American University of Beirut. 
A university spokesman identifi ed the dead as Dean of Students Robert Najemy, 56, born in Worce­ster, Mass., in..a familv nfLebanese origin, and Dean. of En~ineering Raymond Ghosn, a 55-year-old Lebanese. Both were shot by a pistol at close range. 
In Massachusetts, two brothers of Najemy described him as a "very quiet guy, a quiet intellec­tual," who spoke fluent Arabic, Greek, German and Latin in additi­on to English. He was a graduate of Holy Cross College and was a service director for the American 
Red  Cross in  Worcester,  Mass.,  
and Bridgeport, Conn.  
The  .25-year-old  killer  took  a  

dozen university officials hostage and threatened to blow them up 

unless he got a bus or helicopter to take him to the Lebanese-Israeli border where, he said, he wanted to make a suicide raid on the Jewish state, police said. 
"He was very nervous, redfaced and sweating all the time," said one of the hostages, Ernest Conk­lin, 38, of Newton Falls, Ohio. "He had a pistol in his left hand and a 
grenade  in  his  right  hand  and

Dining hall improvement needed 
By Kevin McLean Staff Reporter 
The Student Government Food Service Commission, headed by Joe Fiorella, surveyed the service and food in Notre Dame dining halls this semester for one and a half weeks. 
Stationed at A line in North Dining Hall, commission member Mike Gassman observed, "Out of ten meals, one was rated fair to good. The others were all nega­tive." He cited cold food, waiting in line and running out of food as 
Football All-Stars to play April 25th 
by John Dllenschnelder Staff Reporter Football season is not over, at least not for the 68 inter hall football all stars who are tentatively sched­uled to play on Sunday, April 25, in Cartier Field. 
The game pitting the North Quad stars against the South Quad stars will be preceded by a contest 
between Notre Dame's girl All Stars and a team from St. Mary's. 
"It's the first time we've tried anything like this" said Elton Johnston, Chairman of the Hall Presidents Council. "But in the future we hope to incorporate it into the regular interhall football season, either in the middle, or at the end of the playing schedule." 
Johnston also said that the 
games would be an added attrac­
tion to An Tostal weekend, but the 
H.P.C. has not decided whether or not the second contest will be played in padded equipment. 
"Because of possible injuries and problems in obtaining equip­ment, the game may have to be touch instead of tackle," Johnston explained, ''but no matter what it is, a game will be scheduled." 
The All Stan teams and coaches 
for the games·were compiled at the 
end of November at a coaches 
meeting. Each coach voted on a 
player for each position, and then 
from among themselves, they sel­
ected the coaches for the all star 
teams. 
"All I had to do was call the 
coaches together," Johnston said. 
''They did all the work and kept the 
thing alive." 
Each of these players will receive a certificate during the H.P.C. meeting on March 2 naming them an interhall All Star

reasons for the low ratings. 
The survey included breakfast, lunch and dinner at both the North and South dining halls. Some of the points the dining halls were graded on were the food tempera­ture, the time waiting in line for food, the cleanliness of the dishes and silverware, the accuracy with which the meal corresponded with the menu, and the attitude of the cafeteria personnel. The survey also took into account the quality and quantity of these points. The survey members added their own comments as well as those of other students. 
Gassman, stated that the survey was taken without the knowledge of the dining hall management to make sure the menu was represent­ative of those served during the semester. He said the reason for the survey was to evaluate dining hall service and to point out to the management their strengths and weaknesses. 
"The commission is sort of like Naider's Raiders," Gassman said. he also commented that the com­mission had had trouble getting a response from the dining hall management in the past. 
"We would give them some general comments about the dining hall and the management would take it with a grain of salt,'' he said. 

Gassman hopes the results of the 
survey will show the need for 
improvement in the dining halls.

Bugs bite more Hoosiers 
SOUTH BEND, Ind.-Indiana had more cases of sleeping sickness per capita last summer than any state in the nation--possibly because nothing was done to control the disease, according to University of Notre Dame experts. 
Dr. George B. Craig Jr. director of Notre Dame's biology laboratory and an expert on mosquitoes, said the only known way to prevent sleeping sickness--encephalitis--is to control the mosquitoes that transmit it. But Craig said Indiana is one of only 12 states in the country without organized mosqui­to control. 
"The official Indiana attitude seems to be that encephalitis is a plague rained on us by God and we should bow our heads and accept it," he said. "In our neighboring states, Illinois and Ohio, there seem to be significant debates on which anti-mosquito techniques to use for encephalitis control. Here, we don't even debate whether control should be attempted." 

"While other states were con­
ducting active disease-control cam­
paigns, Indiana officials kept score 
and prayed for snow. ' 
Craig said he had asked the 
governor· to appoint a commission to examine last summer's epidemic and written the Indiana Depart­ment of Health, urging officials to establish an encephalitis virus lab­oratory. So far, he said there had been no response. 
Craig said he also had pushed for passage of a mosquito control bill in the 1976 legislature. The bill, he said, was aimed at establishing mosquito abatement districts for control of the insects. 
He said the best way to handle the mosquito problem would be to establish the districts and imple­ment good drainage, impound­ment filling and tree planting praCtices rather than rely on mass spraying or fogging with insecti­cides.

school teacher and former Lebane­se education minister, talked the assassin into releasing his hostages unharmed and giving up to the Palestinian guerrilla police. It took them three hours of tense negotiat­ions. 
Then, in an episode dramatizing the violent atmosphere in this war-torn capital, a close friend of Ghosn darted from a crowd and opened fire on the· subdued killer with a pistol as he was being driven away, slightly wounding him in the shoulders. 
Police said soldiers from the Palestine Liberation Army returned the fire and wounded the assailant in the shoulder. 
The assailant and his attacker, identified as Joseph Cherbeka, were both driven to a guerrilla clinic by PLA troops. 
Police identified the killer as Najim Najim, a Palestinian with a Torn<>nian passport. He was in his fourthyear of engineering at the University when he was expelled during a purge of radical students 
in 1974. ··"He ·seems a little unbalanced," a university spokesman said. 
More than 100 students were expelled in the purge following recurrent unrest on the elegant pine-studded campus sprawling ac­ross 73 acres overlooking the Mediterranean. 
A group of 25 expelled Palestini­an and Lebanese students occupied two· halls· for four days but were finally evacuated by police. Anon­ymous threats were made last year against University President Sam­uel Kirkwood unless those expelled were reinstated. 
The 110-year-old university has educated many of the Arab world's professional and political leaders, including Dr. George Habash of the Marxist-oriented Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. 
The shootings marked the worst incident in a mostly peaceful day as Lebanon continued efforts to return to normal after the civil conflict that has killed 12,000 and wrecked the economy.

CAUSE needs arm wrestlers 

Entries are being taken for the CAUSE Arm Wrestling Tourna­ment. 
The object of the tournament is to raise money for the elderly of the South Bend area through CAUSE. CAUSE(cooperative activities unit­ing students and the elderly) is an organization that oversees all groups dealing with the elderly and coordinates activities. Funds raised through the contest will be used for massive renovation, paint­ing, and cleaning in area nursing homes. 
Participants may enter the con­test through their hall recreation directors. Off-campus hopefuls may apply at the hall where th~y formerly resided. The entry fee ts one dollar. 
The participants are divided into four weight categories: below 150 lbs., 150-175 lbs., 175-200 Ibs., and over 200 lbs. The competition starts at the intra-hall level. After only one entrant remains in each category in each hall, a single elimination tournament between all the halls will be held. The finals will take place during half-time of the Western Michigan game. The winner of each category will be awarded an engraved trophy. The second and third place finishers wil receive prizes from area mer­chants. 
Anyone desiring to donate to the organization, but not wishing to enter the contest, may give his donation to the Volunteer Services office on the I'll lloor of LaFortune, or mail it to Dave Walters at 1038 East Miner Street. 
''I urge you to enter and compete as soon as possible," Walters said. "The key to their future is in your hands."
