Bar owners, neighbors to revise agreement 
by Bob V arettoni Senior Staff Reporte1r 
Bar owners and the Northeast Neighborhood Council have de­cided to revise an agreement made last April about noise and litter problems in the Corby-Eddy area. 
At a South Bend Board of Safety meeting Friday afternoon in the County-City Building, the Council accused the owners of not comply­ing with a previous agreement to "be responsible for trash clean-up in a two-block area around their businesses." 
Art Quigley, Northeast Neigh­borhood Council president, said he would forget about the alleged violations of the old agreement if, by signing a revised copy of the old agreement on Wednesday, the owners make a "fresh start." 
In recent weeks, according to Board of Safety member Eugene Dziubinski, the litter and noise in the Corby-Eddy area had reached a point where the Council felt that the bar owners had not lived up to last year's agreement. 
"I'm offended by the suggestion that we abrogated any agreement. We've spent a heck of a lot of money cleaning up the Corby area,'' Harold Rowley, part..owner of Corby's tavern, reacted. 
Rowley said that the Northeast Neighborhood Council was making "shotgun accusations." He added that "we've broken our necks" to remove the litter outside Corby's. 
John Roos, ND government pro­fessor and member of the Council, countered that the area in front of Corby's by the gas station was "just filled with beer cans and beer cups. This area has been terrible." 
Crowley observed that some of this garbage could have resulted from off-campus parties and keg­gers. "Many times I find bottles outside Corby's that we don't even sell there," he noted. 
"From the observing I've done," Dziubinski said, "if those beer cups and cans are not yours, then you're really the victim of unusual circumstances. Even if you are, you're going to get blamed for that litter, anyway." 
Nickie' s manager, "Bullet," admitted that there may be a litter problem, but only because Rick Kanser, who had been the owner's representative under the old agree­ment, sold his interest in the Library. 
"We no longer had a representa­tive," Bullet said. "I didn't have the pressure of someone calling me up to say 'do it.' We gave it a good try last year. If there was a tighter organization, we could do it again." 
"You folks have got to get your act together,'' Roos said, refen;ng to the tavern owners. "I go to the 
council meetings, and people say I'm a sucker. I tell them there's an agreement, but they don't see anything being done." 
Dziubinski said he would only revise the names and dates, not the content of the old agreement. This revision will be signed Wednesday afternoon by Quigley, Dziubinski, and a yet to be determined repre­sentative of the tavern owners. Dziubinski said he wanted such an agreement signed during "the critical period between now and when the students leave for the summer." 
"I don't want you to lose business," Quigley said, in conclu­sion, to the owners. "I just wa.nt you to make a nice, quiet, litterless profit." 
Andy McKenna, student body president, and John Fitzpatrick, off-campus commissioner, attend­ed Friday's meeting. Dave Tatum, owner of the Library, Theresa Bauer, part-owner of Bridget McGuire's, and an unofficial observer from the South Bend Police Department also attended.

Rizzo outlines coordinator's role 
by Sue Wueteber 
"My role is to provide assistance to students who violate University rules and regulations," said Jayne Rizzo, newly elected judicial coor­dinator. "Not enough students know their options. We want to counsel them before they see Dean Roemer, to make sure their student rights are not violated," she added. 
Rizzo stated that besides under­graduate representation, her duties include overseeing the hall Judicail Boards; coordinating the Judicial Council, whieh is made up of the J-Board Chairmen from each hall, and being a member of the Student Union Board of Commissioners. 
"We holM! to strenghten the Judicial Council into a collective identity," sht~ remarked. "It will meet every two weeks, the first meeting being today. In this initial meeting, we.' hope to elect a representative to the Campus Life Council," she said. 
John Dziminski, student union press secretary, observed that the 

Terrorists threaten Moro's ·life 
ROME [AP]--ltaly's president told the terrorist kidnappers of former Premier Aldo Moro yesterday that killing him would be a "fatal error" and would gain them "absolutely nothing." 
President Giovanni Leone's appeal for the life of his longtime colleague was made indirectly in an open message to Moro's wife one day after the Red Brigades kidnap­pers announced that a "people's court" had condemned Moro to death. 
The ruling Christian Democrat Party, meanwhile, indicated a pos­sible softening of its refusal to deal with the Marxist urban guerrilla group for the release of Moro, who is party president. 
The Brigades kidnapped the new Judicial Coordinator has more authority than any in the past. Commenting on this, Rizzo noted that according to the new Constitu­tion, the Judicial Coordinator is no longer a Cabinet position. 
"It is now a third branch of government, along with Student Government and Student Union," she explained. "I was elected by the out-going J-Board Chairmen. We are not, however, totally sepa­rated from Andy McKenna's Cabi­net," she added. 
Also new is her seat on the Student Union Board of Commis­sioners. "I'll be working more with the Administration," she said. "It's important to know and re­spect Dean Roemer." 
One area that expressly concerns Rizzo is that of rector communica­tion. "It's important to keep in contact with the rectors," she stated. "They are a vital link. They are the ones who determine the seriousness of student offen­ses." Rizzo explained that if stu­dents show themselves to be willing and able to take resoonsibi­
61-year-old Moro and killed his five bodyguards March 16 in a Rome street ambush. His captors announced in six subsequent mes­sages left in public places across Italy that he was undergoing a "people's trial." 
On Saturday they said he had been "sentenced to die" for com­plicity in Christian Democrat policies. 
Leone issued his statement after he met with Premier Giulio Andreotti and Interior Minister Francesco Cossiga in a search for ways to save Moro's life. _ 

The presidential message to Moro's wife said a "terrifying threat looms for Aldo Moro" and added: "A sense of humanity may induce them (Moro's captors) into a lity for their actions, more authority may be delegated to the hall J-Boards. 
Rizzo revealed that specific plans are already underway for the new school year. "When we get bact, I'd like to have a workshop for all the J-Board chairmen," she said. "I don't want to regulate all the halls. Every one is different. Instead I'd like to give the chair­men an idea of a just and proper way of handling cases withing the halls," she noted. 
Other courses of action approved by Rizzo include a students' rights manual, which would list university rules and regulations, and the students recourse to various offen­ses. Also, a letter that advises them to acquaint themselves with their rights and their hall J-Board chairmen will be sent to all students. "The letter will also give my office phone number and my home phone number.," she said. "The most important thing is to make myself available to the stu­dents. Most of them are not aware of their rights and options." 
gesture of repentance ... and drive them to spare a life whose sacrifice would gain them nothing, absolute­ly nothing." 
The government and the Chris­tian Democrats have rejected the Brigades' demands, made through letters written by Moro, for the release of jailed terrorists. Fifteen Red Brigades leaders are on trial in Turin, charged with sedition. 
But ChriStian Democrat leaders, after a three-hour meeting yester­day, said through Deputy Secretary Giovanni Galloni that the party, while "aware of our duties before the nation" was "anguished about the life of Moro andthereforeon the humanitarian level we feel that his life must be spared by all the means juridically possible and legi­timate." 
Christian Democrats in the past have not ruied out the possibility of buying Moro's freedom with ran­som money from his friends or family. 
The Communist Party, largest of the parties supporting the Chris­tian Democrat minority govern­ment in Parliament, urged the nation's leaders to maintain their tough stance. 
The Communist newspaper L'Unita said in a front-page editori­al that "emotional feelings must not prevail on the coolness and calm necessary in this grave hour" and that politicians "must continue to display their sense of responsibi­lity before the republic." 
Police continuing the search for Moro set up checkpoints and stopped thousands of motorists who left the cities on Italy's fist sunny day after two weeks of rain. Some 50,000 police and soldiers have been pressed into service in the hunt, but have turned up no solid leads.

Wage and Price Council tries to restrain inflation 
WASHINGTON [API -The director of the president's Council on Wage and Price Stability said yesterday the federal government is prepared to use economic pressure to per­suade private business to help restrain inflation. 
Barry P. Bosworth, the director, said the government would "real­ign procurement policies" based on how well businesses keep their prices down. 
Hosworth made the statement in an appearance on the NBC television program "Meet the Press." He expanded on it in a telephone interview with The Asso­ciated Press. 
He said the government buys enough that it can influence infla­tion policies in private industry. By delaying purchases from compan­ies that don't hold the line on prices ui switching to alternate products, it can reward those who he!p fight inflation and pressure those who do not. 
"The extent to which you can do it is limited," Bosworth said. 
"Probably the most promising area is in food purchases." 
He said the economic pressure probably would be applied through a program "to identify on a quarterly basis those products whose prices are rising rapidly." Government purchasers then would try to either buy alternate products or delay the purchase. 
However, BQsworth said charac­terizing the program as a "federal boycott" was too strong. He said it is more of an attempt by the government to act as an informed consumer.

ed on the Camp David grounds by 
Lt. Col. Cecil Reed, chaplain at 
nearby Fort Richie. 
The gathering of more than two 

dozen officials at the isolated 
setting for an overnight visit was 
the first such conference since 
Carter, his prospective Cabinet and 
top aides met at St. Simons Island, 
Ga., three weeks before inaugura­
tion day. 
Concern over the president's political problems was evident in the fact that John White, the new chairman of the Democratic Nation­al Committee, was invited to the conference. 
The meeting came as the admini­stration faced two significant dates: on tomorrow the vote in the Senate on the second Panama Canal treaty and, on Thursday, the first anniver­sary of Carter's declaration of ''the moral equivalent of war" in form­ing a national energy policy. 
Howard Baker of Tennessee, Senate Republican leader, predict­ed Sunday that the Senate would narrowly approve the treatv return­ing control of the Panama Canal to 
Panama by the year 2000. 
He made the prediction in an 
appearance on the CBS televisins 
program "Face the Nation." 
Congressional energy conferees 
still are at odds over the details of 
an energy policy. After 15 months 
in office, the president finds that 
his oopularity, as measured in 
national opinion polls, is continuing; 
to slip. 

A New York Times-CBS sample 
showed last week that a record low 
of 46 percent of those polled 
approved the way Carter was doing 
his job. 

Billiards semi's scheduled 
The semi-finals of the Notre Dame billiards tournament will be held tonight at 6 p.m. in the pool room in the basement of LaFor­tune.

Courts disfavor Indian claims 
WASHINGTON [AP]--Recent court decisions a][ld proposed settlements 1 

, are dealing blows to American Indian efforts to reclaim lost lands and achieve tribal sovereignty. : Although many disputes have not yet been resolved, the initial results indicate Indians are not. getting everything they seek--and in some cases nothing at all. Perhaps the most significant disputes in which courts have recently ruled involve the Wam­panoag Indians in Massachusetts and a tribe in Washington seeking the right to prosecute non-Indians on reservation land. 
Art department sponsors lecture 
"Super Realism: The Sublime Abstraction and the Decline of Formalism" is the topic of a lecture to be given by Gregory Battock, art critic, editor and educator, in the Notre Dame Art Gallery at 7:30 
p.m. tonight. Co-sponsored by the Art Gallery and the Art Depart­ment, the talk is open to the public without charge. 
An associate professor of art at William Patterson College in New Jersey and .at New York University, Battock has edited "The New Art," "Minimal Art," "New ldeas in Art," "The New American Cinema" and "New Artists Video.'' He was editor-in-chief of Arts Magazine from 1973 to 1975 and has contributed articles to Arts Magazine, Art in America and Art and Artists .. 
The W ampanoags claimed title to about $30 million worth of prime Cape Cod land around Mashpee, arguing the land was unlawfully taken from their ancestors by the state because it failed to get approval from Congress, as federal law required at that time. 
However, a federal judge ruled the Wampanoags, who greeted the Pilgrims when they stepped ashore, does not constitute a legal tribe and therefore could not claim the land. Tribal attorneys say they will appeal. 
In another case, the Supreme Court forbad tribes from prosecut­ing non-Indians who violate tribal laws on reservation lands. The decision, involving the Suquamish tribe in Washington, was viewed by observers as a major setback for Indians seeking complete self­determination. 
The nation's most celebrated case involves a claim by the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot tribes to 12.5 million acres of land in Maine, an area representing two-thirds of the state. 
The tribes have voted over­whelmingly to accept a White House-negotiated settlement that would give the Indians $25 million in federal money; all that to buy 300,000 acres of prime timberland at $5 an acre, most of which is now owned by 14 large landowners; annual state payments of $1.7 million for 15 years; and the option to purchase 200,000 additional acres at the fair market value of about $112 an acre. 
Timber companies and state officials have spoken out against the settlement, b~t left the door open for further negotiations. The tribes have given the state until May 10 to respond officially to the offer. Another case in which a tribe appears willing to settle for less than originally asked involves the Narragansetts in Rhode Island. 

The tribe filed suit in 1975 to get title to 3,500 acres in Charlestown. But a proposed agreement worked out by local landowners and feder­al, state, city and tribal officials pared the total down to 1,900 acres.
