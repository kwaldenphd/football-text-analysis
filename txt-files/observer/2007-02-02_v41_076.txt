Four tickets run for student body leadership 
Experienced contenders face newcomers in Feb. 12 election 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Associate News Editor 
With current student body president Lizzi Shappell and vice president Bill Andrichik due to graduate in May, eight new faces have climbed into the ring, their eyes on one prize: becoming the next leaders of Notre Dame's student government. 
In an e-mail sent to The Observer Thursday, the Judicial Council announced the four tickets running this year. 
The students running for president and vice pres­ident are junior Liz Brown from Cavanaugh and sophomore Maris Braun from Breen-Phillips, junior Danny Smith from Alumni and junior Ashley Weiss from Breen-Phillips, freshman Cipriano Rivera of St. Edward's and sophomore Catherine Kane of Welsh Family and freshmen Garrett Coggon and Mike Padberg, both from Zahm Hall. 
This year's candidates include an all-female tick­·et, a ticket with two ROTC members and a transfer student. Brown and Braun enter their campaign armed

Candidates create personal blogs to communicate with voters 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
With student campaign races heating up, both Liz Brown and Danny Smith are doing something unprecedented in Notre Dame election history ­they are both taking their campaign trail online with blogs. 
While the Judicial Council, the governing body for University elections, encourages candidates to cre­ate Web sites, Brown and Smith independently came up with the idea of running a blog. 
"When we were originally brainstorming our plat­form, we decided that we want to run a blog to keep people informed about what's going on in student government," Smith said. "We wanted people to be able to communicate with us. We realized that this is a goal for our campaign too, so the blog idea real­ly branched off a platform idea." 
While the blogs are the newest addition to the campaign trail, neither candidate wants new tech­nologies to replace actually going out and meeting potential voters.

Students have turned to Anthony Travel to organize and book spring break trips. 
By ROHAN ANAND News Writer 
There seems to be one adage Notre Dame students follow in plan­ning their spring break vacations: haste makes waste. That is, those traveling worldwide for the nine days of respite this March haven't delayed making their final arrange­ments. 
Avoiding procrastination has cer­tainly been economical for sopho­more Brandon Doyle and his fellow quad members from Siegfried Hall, who are traveling to Orlando. Three of them will fly down and one will drive so they have access to a car once they arrive. 
"We booked our tickets in December and got great airfares," 
Spring break plans already in the making 
Doyle said. "And with a car, we can easily get around Orlando -see the Disney parks, Epcot Center and Universal Studios, and visit beaches within an hour's drive easily." 
Whether spring break travel plans are voyaging to domestic beaches or hopping across borders to hit up international hot spots or heading home, the majority of the student body simply wants to escape the wintry climate of Northern Indiana. 
Such is the case for junior Angel Leal of Howard Hall and her friends from California and Texas. Naturally, their main priority in choosing a vacation was to land somewhere sunny. 
"We felt that we had to get out of the Midwest for break this year,"

High turnout likely for Late Night Olympics 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
Tonight the Joyce Center will transform into an athlet­ic center with a cause, host­ing one of the most widely attended charity events of the year -Late Night Olympics. 
This will be the 21st year that Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students gather to raise funds for the St. Joseph County Special Olympics. Students participate in ath­letic events and raise money as a dorm. Last year nearly 1,200 participants raised approximately $8,300. 
"Typically, the grand prize winner takes half of the money for their dorm. Last year, the MBA students won, but gave all right back to charity. This is the only time I have ever seen that during my time here," Bill Regan, assistant director for instructional programs and special events at RecSports, said. 
Annual turnout is expected to be similar to previous years, but Regan hopes the weather will not be a factor tonight. 
"I hope the snow doesn't deter people from coming out and having a good time," he said. 
Late Night Olympics con­sists of 17 events, ranging from 3-on-3 basketball to inner tube water polo. Each

Shappell presents progress 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Writer 
The Student Affairs commit­tee of the Board of Trustees gave the Shappell-Andrichik administration a positive appraisal Thursday when stu­dent body president Lizzi Shappell, vice president Bill Andrichik and chief executive assistant Liz Brown presented their State of the Student Union address to the committee mem­bers. 
Andrichik said the past year has been a successful one. 
"We started the year with about 35 or so platform initia­tives and we have either fully completed or, if you include the things that are going to happen, like the Eating Disorders Conference and the Community Summit, then we are in the upper 20s to approaching 30 of those [initiatives]," Andrichik said. 
Shappell said this year her administration was able to complete most of the objectives on their initial platform because they haven't had to deal with any of the sudden issues that arose last year, like the academic freedom debate and the disorderly house ordi­nance. 
"It's been a far more relaxed year in that sense with not dealing with as controversial

INSIDE COLUMN 

State of the headshots 
Hello, dear reader. I am writing today about something that is important to me, and I have decided to write this in inside column format. I've decided to position my words in a column-like shape to talk to you about the sorry state of headshots in The Observer. 
You may remember my other inside col­umn (the second of three, if you are into collecting my inside columns) of Fall 2006, when I discussed the importance of having the proper headshot to go with your article in our student news­paper. I think you'll agree, articles with­out headshots suck. 

Since my column's appearance, I have seen a larger number of headshots in The Observer (directly attributable to me), but I have also seen a steady decline in quality. This is disturbing. 
CASE IN POINT: The issue of Tuesday, January 30th is strewn with awful, stu­pid headshots. 
EXAMPLE A: Jonathan Klinger's arti­cle on fair trade in the Viewpoint sec­tion has with it possibly the worst head­shot in Observer history. It appears to be cropped from a larger photo of Jonathan (or, if I may, Jon) near a coral reef. However, this cannot be so because he is wearing a suit. Ridiculous. 
Further more, his head isn't even fill­ing the frame of the headshot. There is a limited space in which to make a headshot IMPACT. I suggest you fill it, Jon. 
EXAMPLE B: Marty Schroeder's arti­cle on Super Bowl commercials. The way his head is slightly cocked, but not cocked all the way, makes me distrust him and his motives. His stare suggests something to me of a secret, not unlike the Mona Lisa. I don't want to stare at the headshot and try to figure out what he is thinking; I want it all in the article. Give me a headshot that says,"no need to look here, it's all in the article." Marty, take your half-cocked Mona Lisa smiles and leave them at home. 
But do not lose hope, dear readers. Among strewn piles of senseless crappy headshot rubble, there are some shiny good things. The edition of Wednesday, January 31st, in the Viewpoint section features a very well done headshot of Katie Palmitier. Neutral background, full frame, and the perfect facial expression. Wow. 
While there are many terrible head­shots in the Observer, not enough arti­cles even give their writers a chance by including them. Missed opportunity. Recall Ken Fowler's passionate polemic against that Selena Roberts woman or whatever. Now imagine Ken's column with him staring right at you looking SUPER serious. HOLY CRAP! I've met Ken (nice guy) and he could do it, no problem. 
So I call on you, the readers, to demand more headshots. Write in, and -oh whatever, this'll probably get cut off at the end anyway·s. 
The views expressed in the Inside Column are those of the author and not necessarily those ofThe Observer.

'Super Tonio' causes sensation in Cancun 
CANCUN, Mexico-He is called "Super Tonio," and at a whopping birth weight of 14.5 pounds, the little fellow is causing a sensa­tion in this Mexican resort city. 
Cancun residents have crowded the nursery ward's window to see Antonio Vasconcelos, who was born early Monday by Caesarean section. The baby drinks 5 ounces of milk evtfty three hours, and measures 22 inches in length. 
"We haven't found any abnormality in the child, 
there are some signs of high blood sugar, and a slight blood infection, but that is being controlled so that the child can get on with his normal life in a few more days," Narciso Perez Bravo, the hospital's director, said on Wednesday. 
Fake employer took women's urine samples 
OMAHA, Neb. -A 36­year-old Omaha man accused of luring women to his home and taking urine samples when they thought they were applying for a job was found guilty Thursday of two counts of criminal impersonation. 
Victims told police Kevin Oliver said he worked for cell phone company T­Mobile and was interview­ing them for jobs. Prosecutors said there never were any jobs. 
"To this day, we don't know what his ultimate goal was but whatever it was it was deceptive, it was damaging and it was protracted," said Omaha city prosecutor Marty Conboy. "This went on for 18 months that we know of."

Career fair enjoys high turnout 
By EVA BINDA News Writer 
Nearly a quarter of Notre Dame's student body and over 100 employers trekked through snow and ice to the Joyce Center Thursday night to take part in the Wmter Career Fair. 
"I think this may be our largest and most diverse career fair since 1999," said Lee Svete, director of the Career Center. "There's some­thing for,every major, which is usually hard to do with a career fair. It's a mixed buffet table of opportunities." 
Anita Rees, associate director of the Career Center, noted that there was a "constant flow" of students with some showing up at 
3:50 p.m., 10 minutes before the fair's 4:00 start time. · 
"There was an especially heavy flow at the beginning," Rees said. "Employers were amazed with the turnout and they're saying how great Notre Dame students are." 
Students came dressed in busi­ness suits and formal attire to network with potential employers and try to land interviews and ultimately, internships or jobs for after-graduation. Class levels ranged from freshman under­graduates to MBA candidates to even PhD candidates. 
"1 !:!arne at the last minute to find a job. [The Career Fair] is practice for interviewing in the future," said Liz Sarb, a studio art and design major. "I also came as moral support for my friends." 
One surprise of the night was the amount of freshmen that came to the fair to seek out employers, which "impressed" Rees. 
Freshmen can have a hard time landing internships or even get­ting much attention from employ­ers who are often more interested in recruiting sophomores and jun­iors. 
''I'm not necessarily looking for an internship, but it's good to make contacts and see what's out there," said freshman aerospace engineering major Ted Reinhold, who talked to a BP Oil Company recruiter. 
Freshman Melissa Dondalski, who attended the Diversity Reception before the fair, echoed Reinhold's sentiments. 
"It was a little disappointing because there aren't a lot of opportunities for freshmen, but it was still a good experience to meet employers," she said. 
With so many interested stu­dents, queues were inevitable at the fair. Long lines of up to 15 Arts and Letters students waited to talk to recruiters from Chicago's Field Museum while long lines of Finance majors wait­ed at Goldman Sachs. 
Students weren't the only ones who noticed the long lines. 
"Employers were amazed with the turnout. They've been impressed with how many stu­dents have come out," said Suzanne Thorup, program man­ager for internship development at the Career Center. 
Although Chicago and the Midwest were well-represented, employers came from as far as Seattle and Washington, D.C. to attend the event. Svete called it "a 
testament to Notre Dame stu­dents and what they offer." Employers also praised the stu­dent body. 
"I've been in this business for 23 years and have recruited stu­dents all over the world, but Notre Dame has the highest cal­iber of students," said Sam Long, a recruiter from E&J Gallo Wrnery, based in Modesto, Calif. "They have strong integrity, great social skills and passion for what they do. They also have the strongest moral compasses of any students I've seen." 
Long praised Svete for prepar­ing Notre Dame students so well for the fair and also for the suc­cess of the fair itself. 
"Lee· [Svete] has such passion and integrity. He really wants the best for his kids," he said. 
Many of the corporate recruiters are Notre Dame alum­ni. Anthony Salvador, a former linebacker on the varsity football team who graduated last spring and now works for E&J Gallo Winery, called coming back to Notre Dame for the Career Fair a "great experience." 
"It's great to be able to help out the company since I'm familiar with Notre Dame students. I can point out familiar faces who are qualified for positions with the company." 
Svete estimates there will be about 1,000 interviews taking place today as a result of the Career Fair, with about 81 employers scheduling upwards of 15 interviews each.

Leal said. "So, we began search­
ing for places on Travelocity.com, 
and we got a package deal to 
Mazatlan [Mexico] that ended up 
being cheaper than Cancun or 
other popular sites." 

While students like Leal may 
have struck gold relying solely on 
Internet deals, on-campus 
resources such as Anthony Travel 
also organized some vacations 
that many students found attrac­
tive, said Kayleen Carr, leisure 
manager for the company. 
"The two biggest destinations this year include a cruise on the Carnival Glory, which roughly 100 Notre Dame students have ·booked cabins on," she said. "The second largest destination, Costa Rica, will be hailing about fifty 
students." 

Carr also noted that most stu­
dents traveling on the Carnival 
Glory cruise will be seniors, as 
they are required to be 21 years 
of age to book a cabin. Most 
Notre Dame students paid rough­
ly $600 apiece to go on this 
cruise. 

In addition, students who opted 
to travel on the cruise -a seven­
day passage through Costa Maya 
and Cozumel, Mexico; the 
Bahamas and Belize -are main­
ly seniors looking to commemo­
rate their final spring break doing 
something unique. 

"It was the most convenient 
and affordable trip for us," said 
senior Christa Laneri, who will be 
going with her roommates. "We 
wanted to do something special 
like a cruise through the Western 
Caribbean, and a group of girls 
going on a cruise will be much safer than going to a foreign country." 
Junior Ted Buch found a unique way to escape the frigid weather: flying to Egypt to visit a fellow Notre Dame friend who is studying abroad at the American University ofCairo. 
"I want to make a point of going somewhere for break," he said, "and I'm tired of the same old, same old. I've always been fasci­nated by pyramids, hieroglyphics, and now that I have a friend there, it makes sense to visit." 
Many students seeking last­minute deals can use STA Travel, the world's leading student travel organization with 400 worldwide branches as a resource. Carrie Moffatt, the branch manager at the Purdue University location, said there has definitely been a major increase in college students traveling this spring break. 
"Students seem to be picking up on the great deals offered in London, Paris, Amsterdam and Rome," she said, "and even more expensive vacations to places like Costa Rica and the Caribbean have been l:iot this year." 
Buch's preparation for his jour­ney will certainly require more cash than a trip to Central America, but for him, months of personal savings plus a job wait­ing tables will help fund his endeavor. Besides that, there's lit­tle to worry about, he said. 
"The flight and the hotel accommodations will take up most of my costs, but I think it's all worth it," Buch said. "I imag­ine I'll do all the sightseeing·and enjoy the nightlife in Cairo. My only hope is that I don't run into trouble anywhere."

Renovated health center dedicated, ready for use 
Jenkins says blessing over Saint Liam Hall 
By MEG HAN WONS News Writer 

Visitors who step inside the newly renovated University Health Center, now known as Saint Liam Hall, will discover a "magnificent transformation," as Director of Health Services Ann Kleva called the building at its dedication Thursday afternoon. 
Although Saint Liam Hall was fully operational on Jan. 15, according to staff pharmacist Betsy Creary, it was blessed and dedicated yesterday as part of the Board of Trustees weekend. 
University President Father John Jenkins said a prayer and 
sprinkled a plaque in the lobby with Holy Water. "Let us ask God's blessing on this place," he said. 
Kleva encouraged the Trustees and special guests in attendance to tour Saint Liam Hall at their leisure after the ceremony. 
While the fa.-,;ade of Saint Liam Hall remains consistent with the former University Health Center, the new inside bears no resem­blance to the old. 
"The building was completely gutted," registered nurse Pat Brubaker said. "They took all our input about what we [the stam would like -we're really pleased that the building now supports us in our care. 
'The beds are better, the door­ways are better, the exam rooms are bigger, there is more confi­dentiality ... the care was excel­lent before, but now we have a space that reflects that level of care." 
Pharmacist Betsy Crnary said she is also enjoying the new space. "Before, we just had a win­dow in the hallway for the phar­macy, now we have much more space and there is morn confiden­tiality," she said. 
Saint Liam Ilall was an $8 mil­lion project, according to tho health service's Web site. Level one of the hall features an allergy clinic, business offices, a laborato­ry, the pharmacy, a student insur­ance office, a travel clinic and an x-ray room. The second level fea­tures a small chapel, a state-of­tho-art conference room, the Office of Alcohol and Drug Education, patient rooms and administrative offices. Level three is home to additional conference

Brown also oversees the Campus Life Council (CLC) task force on Social Concerns and the Senate Multicultural Affairs eom­mittee. In her three years serving student government, she said she has served on five out of the nine student senate committees. Braun has served on two of the other four committees. 
Their combined experience in student government makes for a strong ticket, Brown said.

do and what it is supposed to do and how it's done," she said. 
Brown said her close interac­tion with Shappell and Andrichik has shown her the leadership the job requires. 
''I'm with them more than any­one else all week and I see the demands," Brown said. 
Their campaign slogan, "rais­ing the bar, redefining the stan­dards," sums up the Brown­Braun campaign's vision to change the way they look at the issues the student government has been addressing, Braun said. 
Their campaign will focus on five main areas: rethinking com­munity relations, promoting social concerns, improving the academic environment, "revamping" student government by making it easier for students to get involved and enhancing student life through initiatives like a guest meal exchange pro­gram and a shuttle to South Bend Airport. 
Brown and Braun want to 
increase student involvement in government committees through online applications and forums, but their most popular idea may be making Martin Luther King Day an officially recognized University holiday. 
The Smith-Weiss ticket also comes packed with experience and overflowing with ideas for next year's student government. 
Among the many proposals the candidates have made part of their platform, Smith said, are a partnership with the Ruckus Network, Inc, a legal video and music downloading site for col­lege students and the use of Domer Dollars in the Joyce Center and the Stadium. Smith also hopes to make football ticket booklets obsolete by encoding ticket information on student IDs. Their platform includes a plan to put the football ticketing system online, create a band away-game endowment so the marching band can travel to more away games and address the high rooms and the University Counseling Center, which was for­merly housed in the old post office on Notre Dame Avenue. 


Sister Sue Dunn, former rector of Lyons hall, attended the dedica­tion. 
"I just think it's amazing ­everything is so well done. It's a very professional and welcoming place ... it's a wonderful gift to us all," she said. "It's especially great that all things related to wellness are now in the same building." 
Megan Pohl, a senior who has experienced both the "old" and the "new" health centers, said Saint Liam hall trumps the old center. 
"The atmosphere was much more reassuring," she said. "It looks much more like a doctor's office than the old health center did." 
costs of prescription drugs on campus. 
Smith is Alumni Hall's senator and the chair of the CLC task force on Student Concerns. Weiss is the chair of the Senate Gender Issues committee and is the coor­dinator for the University's first student-run Eating Disorders Conference. 
But Smith said their qualifica­tions go beyond their student government experience. Smith has been a member of the Notre Dame Marching Band for the past three years and sits on the Deus Caritas Est committee to discuss Pope Benedict XVI's first encyclical. Weiss served on the Junior Parents' Weekend com­mittee and has political experi­ence from the University of Rochester, where she was a stu­dent for her freshman year and half her sophomore year. 
Smith said Weiss's experience at Rochester can bring a "fresh perspective" into student govern­ment. And Weiss agreed that her outside experience, along with their combined involvement in activities during their college careers, strengthens their ticket. 
"Danny and I run on the fact that we are two candidates who have experience outside of the student government office," Weiss said. "When we walk into a room, we know what we are talking about on any aspect of life. Believe me, from transfer­ring I know this." 
Over the next week, Smith and Weiss hope to make it to every dorm. Twice. 
"Our goal is to meet as many individuals as possible," Weiss said. 
The candidates also plan to go to Clover Hidge and Turtle Creek to stomp for votes. 
Smith said he and Weiss have done their research and are sure they can implement all their ideas 
"Danny and I are confident that we can answer any ques-
A plaque in the lobby reminds all who enter Saint Liam Hall that it was made a reality through a very generous gift from the William K. Warren Foundation of Tulsa, Okla. 
"Saint Liam Hall is named in honor of Saint William of York, the patron saint of William K. Warren, Senior," the plaque reads. "Saint William of York was a 12th century bishop who was known for his gentleness and charity as well as a life of inter­cession which brought healing to many." 
The final inscription reads, "May Saint William's prayers inspire each patient within this facility to retire to good health."

tion, address any issue, on sever­al different levels," Weiss said. 
Rivera and Kane also bring a unique perspective. Hivera, a freshman, served in the Marine Corps for the past few years and was stationed with the 11th Marine at Camp Pendleton, Calif. Kane is a sophomore midship­man in the Navy ROTC program. 
Neither Rivera nor Kane have experience in Notre Dame's stu­dent government, but said their leadership experience in other activities makes them qualified for the positions. 
"I served in high school on stu­dent government. I had a lot of experience there, but not here. But school government is the same anywhere ... ," Kane said. "I think experience doesn't have a lot to do with it ... anyone can put the pieces together." 
Rivera said his experience in the Marine Corps makes him the best candidate for student body president. 
"Leading under stress and leading small units of Marines I think will equate leading in the student body," Hi vera said. "I think there are parallels in that." 
Rivera-Kane's platform includes allowing meals to roll over from one week to the next, making free tutoring available and free from freshman to senior year and extending the use of Domer Dollars and Flex Points throughout campus . 
Coggon and Padbp,rg, both freshman, make up what seems to be the unofficial annual Zahm ticket. The Observer was unable to reach either candidate for comment Thursday. 
The election for student body president and vice president will take place Monday, Feb. 12 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. A debate will be held Wednesday, Feb. 7 at 7:30 
p.m. in the Main Lounge of LaFortune.

U.N. sees China as key to end crisis 
KHARTOUM, Sudan -The United Nations hopes the Chinese president will push for a solution to the Darfur crisis during his land­mark visit to Sudan on Friday. But Khartoum expects its staunchest diplomatic ally to stick to boosting commercial ties, particularly those assuring its access to Sudan's oil. 
The road to Khartoum's airport was lined with the red banners of communist China and the flag of Sudan's Muslim fundamen­talist regime on Thursday ahead of Hu Jintao's two-day visit, the first by a Chinese president to Sudan. 
China, which is the biggest foreign investor in Sudan and buys two-thirds of the country's oil exports, has used its veto­wielding status at the U.N. Security Council to prevent harsh measures against Sudan over the Darfur conflict. 
Suicide bombers kill 45 in Baghdad 
BAGHDAD, Iraq -A pair of suicide bombers detonated explosives Thursday among shoppers in a crowded outdoor mar­ket in a Shiite city south of Baghdad, killing at least 45 people and wounding 150, police said. Bombs and a mortar attack killed at least 17 others in both Shiite and Sunni areas of Baghdad. 
Overall, more than 100 people were killed or found dead across the country, reflecting the ongoing wave of sectarian and insur­gency bloodletting as the U.S. military gears up for a major security operation to stem the violence. 
The biggest attack took place in the cen­ter of Hillah, a city about 60 miles south of Baghdad. Police and witnesses said the two bombers strolled into the Maktabat market about 6 p.m. when the area was packed with shoppers buying food for the evening meal.

Communities near those levees were being notified as the list was readied for release in response to Freedom of Information Act requests filed by news organizations, includ­ing The Associated Press. 
The figure was provided by Butch Kinerney of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's national flood insurance program. Earlier reports had said the list would con­tain the names of 146 levees at risk of fail­ure, but recent inspections whittled that number down. Kinerney did not provide a list of the levees or where they are located. 
Caucus conflict over mistreatment 
WASHINGTON -Three female members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus accused the organization's male leaders Thursday of treating women unfairly. Rep. Loretta Sanchez said the caucus chairman called her a "whore." 
Rep. Joe Baca denied uttering the insult, which Sanchez cited among grievances that led her to announce this week she was quit­ting the group.

NFL cancels church's Bowl showing 
INDIANAPOLIS -The NFL has nixed a church's plans to use a wall projector to show the Colts-Bears Super Bowl game, saying it would violate copyright1aws. 
NFL officials spotted a promotion of Fall Creek Baptist Church's "Super Bowl Bash" on the church Web site last week and overnighted a letter to the pastor demanding the party be canceled, the church said. 
Initially, the league objected to the church's plan to charge a fee to attend and that the church used the license-protected words "Super Bowl" in its promotions.

Tehran pushes nuclear program 
Ahmadinejad announces plans for uranium enrichment at anniversary celebrations 
Associared Press 

TEHRAN -President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad launched anniversary cele­brations Thursday for Iran's Islamic Revolution with a defiant promise to push ahead with the country's controversial nuclear pro­gram. 
Ahmadinejad suggested Tehran would announce next week that it is begin­ning to install a new assem­bly of 3,000 centrifuges in an underground portion of its uranium enrichment facility at Natanz that the 
U.S. has warned could bring further sanctions against the qmntry. 
The Iranian leader said his government is deter­mined to continue with its nuclear program, despite 
U.N. Security Council sanc­tions imposed over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment, a process that can produce fuel to gener­ate electricity or for the fis­sile core of an atomic bomb. 
Kicking off 10 days of cel­ebrations to mark the 28th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution that brought hard-line clerics to power, Ahmadinejad said Iran will celebrate next week "the stabilization and the establishment of its full right" to enrich uranium at the facility.

were planning to do prior to even developing the blog idea," Brown said. 
While the Brown and Smith campaigns are experimenting with the use of blogs, they will also continue to use the standard campaign Web sites and Facebook groups -methods vot­ers became familiarized with during past elections. 
Student body president Lizzi Shappell said the addition of blogs allows candidates to contin­ue the recent trend of using tech­nology more consistently throughout the campaign. 
"In my two years of campus­wide elections, I have noticed increased use of Web sites and Facebook groups," she said. 
Although Brown believes that the Facebook group is "not quite indicative of how much support you really have," she does find the group provides an effective means of communication with students. 
"Facebook is a great way of getting the word out about our campaign, and it's a way to get people to go the Web site," she said. "It's also our best way of me~~aging large groups of peo­ple. 
Although Facebook can add to a campaign, both Brown and Smith have recognized the hid­den dangers of the site and said about. Unless you have some­thing to hide, there's really no reason for your profile to be pri­vate." 
Smith also opted to keep his profile open to allow others to check out his basic information -information he believed voters have the right to know. 
Despite technology's assistance throughout the campaign, Smith believes that it remains second­ary to talking with students. 
"It's still as important to meet as many people as possible in person. No form of technology can replace going out and meet­ing people," he said. "A lot goes into meeting people and students take much more from a face-to­face interaction than they do from something online. 
"The easiest way to get infor­mation out is online, but we also want to communicate with peo­ple." 
Shappell agreed that a cam­paign needs to be run on the ground, regardless of the candi­date's use of technology. 
"While these are effective methods of campaigning, I think the posters, dorm visits, debates and publication endorsements remain equally important ele­ments," she said.

IN BRIEF 
Visteon Corp. plans plant closing 
INDIANAPOLIS -Visteon Corp. plans to close an eastern Indiana auto-parts plant in September, a move that will idle nearly 900 workers in a county where it has for decades been the largest employer. 
Visteon announced the closing of the Connersville plant on Thursday, as part of the company's three-year plan to fix, close or sell about 30 facilities to make the compa­ny more globally competitive, said Jim Fisher, a spokesman for the Michigan-based company. 
"We've done a very thorough review of this facility," Fisher said. "We do not believe there is a viable business case for continuing to operate it." 
The plant in Connersville, some 60 miles east of Indianapolis, has about 750 hourly -and 140 salaried employees. Visteon and union representatives will begin negotiations over severance packages, Fisher said. 
Stocks rise following spending data 
NEW YORK-Stocks climbed for the third straight day Thursday as an already buoyant Wall Street embraced robust consumer spend­ing figures and largely overcame disappoint­ment in Google Inc.'s profit report. Both the Dow Jones industrials and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies closed at new highs. 
The gains follow(ld Wall Street's best day of the year on Wednesday, when it advanced sharply after the Federal Reserve signaled that the economy remained solid and that inflation was mostly in check. The central bank's com­ments, which followed its decision to leave short-term interest rates unchanged, injected a bit of confidence into an uncertain market. The first month of the year had revealed investor uneasiness about whether stocks were poised to climb higher from sharp gains seen in 2006 or whether the Fed and a drop corporate profits would bring an unceremonious end to the party. 
Economic data continued to play a big role in trading, as it has all week. As expected, con­sumer spending in December showed its biggest increase in five months, rising 0.7 percent. 
"It seems to me the Fed is on hold for the fore­

Exxon Mobil posts record profits 
Oil conglomerate announces high numbers despite fourth-quarter earnings 
Associated Press 

HOUSTON -Tick. Tick. 
Tick. In those three sec­
onds, Exxon Mobil made 
$3,7 50 last year. 
In the same three sec­onds, the average American worker made about 20 cents. 
More than ever, time is money. And for oil con­glomerates like Exxon Mobil Corp., the money has never been better. 
The Irving, Texas-based company on Thursday posted the largest annual profit by a U.S. company -$39.5 billion-even as earnings for the last quarter of 2006 declined 4 percent. 
The record net income amounted to roughly $4.5 million an hour for the world's largest publicly traded oil company, which produces about 3 percent of the world's oil. 
That compares to about $12 an hour for the aver­age U.S. worker, accord­ing to the Labor Department. 
But out-of-this world profits may not last. The lower commodity prices that sank their teeth into Exxon's fourth quarter may linger for at least the first part of 2007, even as the cost of doing business rises because of firm John S.

Global warming grounds Punxsutawney Phil 
On Gobbler's Knob this morning, Punxsutawney Phil endured his 121st rude awakening while being groped, as usual, in inappropriate places -all in the name of the groundhog's prognosti­cation and the local economy's enrich­ment. Although Phil has seen his shad­ow more than 90 percent of the time during his storied past, much to the dismay of us Northerners, the betting money this year challenges that trend. 
With weather forecasts calling for snow showers in Pennsylvania, nearly three-quarters of Las Vegas betters believe (at 13-4 odds) that Phil will not see his shadow and that spring is just around the corner. But alas, global warming will soon retire ole rodent Phil and devastate not only the lives of ordinary Punxsutawney citizens, but of Phil and his protectors ... including Bob Roberts (a name worth repeating) whose official title is "His Protector." 
Once higher temperatures increase throughout the world, the cold weather season will abbreviate. As the winter calendar diminishes, Phil will need to adjust his timetable of six more weeks of potentially cold weather. The Groundhog Club's "Inner Circle," those gentlemen who wear top hats and bestow titles that belie reason upon

each other, will advise Phil on how to adapt his predictions. 
Phil might slice the 6-week extended cold weather timetable back to a month, and continue to decrease hiss options each subsequent year until February in Pennsylvania averages 60-degree daily temperatures. At that point, it would not matter whether or not the sun cast Phil's scary shadow. On the upside, though, Phil would improve his accuracy record, thus rivaling his distant cousin and fellow furry forecaster, Georgia's General Beau Lee, Ph.D. Cousin Lee claims a 94 percent accuracy record ... hardly a difficult task even for a rodent in a state that averages 44 degrees in February and 53 degrees in March. 
On the down side, the demise of the world-famous Yankee groundhog would be the tipping point for both a local and national economic catastrophe. Every element of our GNP would suffer. One simply can review today's Groundhog Day schedule to realize how global warming would end most activities, thereby casting the nation into a rodent­like state -going down the hole. 
Imagine the confusion in the local Punxsutawney unemployment office while bureaucrats attempt to match the expertise of the Inner Circle's members to new jobs. The conversation would sound something like this: 
"Hello, we are recently unemployed because we did not heed AI Gore's warning about global warming. Can you assist us?" asks Treasurer and Head Hailmaker Keith Shields. 
"What have you gentlemen done prior to this?" asks the bureaucrat. 
Vice President and Chief Healthman Paul Johnston answers, "These two are Co-Handlers, but that one is a Cloud Builder while the other is a Fog Spinner." 
"I thought you were all either butlers, waiters or funeral directors," replies the bureaucrat. 
"Actually," interrupts the Big Flake Maker, "These two also work well together. He is the Stump Warden, and that's the Burrow Master. And this duo is the team of the Iceman and Storm Chaser." 
Peering over his bifocals, the bureau­crat asks, "Why are those gentleman sit­ting way over there so far away from everyone?" 
Sky Painter answers, "Everyone keeps them at some distance. He's the Plow Man, and he's the Big Windmaker." 
For Phil's part, to survive the rodent would need another skill like playing chess. He would be reduced to a more demeaning setting, like appearing in sleeping pill commercials with Abe Lincoln. He would become sullen know­ing that his inability to weather global warming single-handedly caused a great depression that rivaled the 1929 stock market crash. 
For example, Vegas oddsmakers would no longer handle two-way action on bets covering Phil -other than to speculate if he might bite Lincoln. Toyota, the official car of Phil, sales would fall behind GM, Ford and Chrysler. While Phil's Food Court would close and the groundhog cookie decorat­ing would end, only the pancake break­fast, complete breakfast buffet and Groundhog Luncheon would barely sur­vive. Pro Wrestling would cancel the Groundhog Rumble at the Community Center Gym, thereby threatening the future of the sport. 
The mayor would no longer perform Groundhog Day wedding ceremonies in Phil's Wedding Chapel at the Civic Center. Phil's funhouse and maze would close as would Phil's Shadow Chaser event at the Punxsutawney Christian School. Upset Christians would demand the cancelation of pagan rituals like the "Phil Phind Scavenger Hunt," the Woodchuck Whittle Carving Show and the crowning of Little Mr. and Miss Groundhog. 
Anarchy would rein as alcoholic bev­erages or illegal substances would now be permitted on the premises. The movie "Groundhog Day" would play nonstop, and conditions would force Phil to move to Georgia and live with his Rebel cousin where he would be forced to eat grits. 
Global warming gloom would spread over mankind. Damn AI Gore and his crystal ball!

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Added cost from dining hall theft 
only encourages 
On Jan. 31 a front page article detailed this year's crime spree in the dining hall. Over 40,000 items were stolen, totaling a cost of $25,000. As a student at the university and an avid thief, I question the validity of the university's claims. To begin: the numbers of items stolen are rounded off, and my guess is they are round­ed up, perhaps to the nearest half-thousand. If the University wants to call attention to a theft problem, specific numbers will make the problem more realistic in the eyes of the students. Also, it is very likely that every missing utensil is considered "stolen," including lost or broken items. 
Secondly, Director of ND Food Services Dave Prentkowski threatens passing the cost on to the stu­dents. We already had $200 added to our tuition to pay for stolen items. This did not help cover the costs, rather it encouraged those not stealing to begin so they could get their $200 worth. Passing on the costs to the students is not going to fix the problem. This also fails to take into account the return of silverware at the end of the year. Many dorms have containers at the end of the year for students to return stolen dining hall goods that they stole for school-year-only use. We have senior citizen volunteers guarding the dining hall. Shouldn't they be enough to catch the thieves? 
If you ask me, the students are stealing for two rea­sons, neither being to "stock their dorm rooms." The students want to make back the extra $200 on their tuition bill, and they want the challenge of successfully stealing from a guarded dining hall. Take away the guards at the exits and stop adding charges to tuition. The result will be an immediate increase in stolen goods, for probably a week, and then students will get bored and the numbers will drastically decrease. Now that I know I will be charged next year to replace equip­ment I'm not stealing, I may begin "stocking my dorm room" in order to cover the extra costs.

Humorous 'Office' deserves place among the elite 
Not too long ago, I was watching an episode of "Seinfeld" and remarked that they don't make shows like that anymore. It's not just that "Seinfeld" was funny or that it was sharp and relevant-it was 
one of those rare shows that reached critical mass and became a cultural indicator. The proof of this is the way in which "Seinfeld" became quotable and everyone knew the reference. 

Things like "not that Brian Doxtader 
there's anything wrong with that" or "no soup for you" 
were immediately Scene Editor recognizable and people even referred to certain situations as a "Seinfeld moment." 
It's hard for sitcoms to reach that same kind of level nowadays. The can­cellation of "Seinfeld" and "Friends" left an empty void of sharp, well-writ­ten comedy. The ones that come clos­est, like "Arrested Development," were too clev~r for their own good and were canceled in the face of low ratings. 
Which brings me to "The Office," NBC's adaptation of the British hit of the same name. "The Office" has everything going for it-it has a gen­uine talent in star Steve Carrell, is well written, funny and has serious and effective emotional undertones. The show has improved steadily with age, and by now (the third season) the characters and their relationships have been firmly developed and the plotting has found its own identity, differentiating it from the British ver­sion. 
"The Office" is part of the new age of sitcoms, a mockumentary style that uses hand-held cinematography and direct addresses to the camera. Like "Arrested Development," it seems too clever for its own good, and while it has been a critical success (much like Ron Howard's show), it is consistently outperformed in the ratings depart­ment. "The Office" is part of Thursday's line-up, which includes perennial favorites "Scrubs" and new

The classic show "Seinfeld" is often compared to "The Office" for its brilliant casting, clever humor and the cult-culture that forms around the show. 
hits like "30 Rock," and has just been picked up for a fourth season. 
More than any other sitcom on televi­sion right now, "The Office" is close to reaching a critical mass akin to "Seinfeld." Though viewership is not as high as, say, "American Idol," its fan­base is devoted. Even Sports Illustrated's Stewart Mandell used to regularly mention the show in his week­ly column. Yet "The Office" is so close to escaping "cult show" status in reaching mainstream audiences. "Arrested Development," like the once-canceled "Family Guy," posthumously found ne~ fans on DVD, but "The Office" still has a chance to become the biggest show on television. If that happens, it would be a true rarity, something only achieved by shows like "Seinfeld" and "The Cosby Show" --the best show on TV could also be the most popular. 
The best parts of the show are the dialogue and the aCting. "Daily Show" alums like Steve Carrell (who won a Golden Globe for this role) and Ed Helms whip off quotable lines effortless­ly such as ''I'm always thinking one step ahead. I'm like a carpenter ... who builds stairs" or "Toby is in HR. which technically means he works for corpo­rate, so he's really not part of our fami­ly ... also, he's divorced so he's really not part of his family." These are among the countless gems in each week's script. 
I'm really pushing for "The Office" to succeed because we need more shows like it-shows that are insightful and intelligent. "Seinfeld" worked because it said a lot about our society and we were able to see some of our most ridiculous fears and hopes reflected in it. "The Office" works for much the same reason, but it's a better show, with a strong cast and lots of personali­ty. It's really a once-in-a-lifetime kind of show, the kind of program that makes "Must See TV" a truism, the kind pro­gram that people will talk about years from now and say, "They just don't make shows like that anymore."

PLAY PREVIEW 

PEMCo's latest production is truly impressive 
By ANALISE LIPARI 
Assistant Scene Editor 

With "Ragtime," the Pasquerilla East Musical Company takes a sweeping step into deeper and far more serious territory than it has ventured towards before. Tackling such issues as poverty, racism, moth­erhood, love and the spectacle of the "American dream," PEMCo's "Ragtime" is a rousing success. 
By far the most ambitious produc­tion that PEMCo has undertaken in recent memory, the strength of "Ragtime" is a testament to the power of a magnificent score and an earnest, energetic cast. Quelling doubts regarding how well an ama­teur cast of students could tackle "Ragtime," a musical rife with deep social, political and emotional strife, the production is impressively well done. 
The complex and interwoven plot is set up very well with the play's open­ing number, "Ragtime," which juxta­poses against one another three cen­tral, conflicting groups: the upper­class, white community of La Rochelle, New York, the mass groups of immigrants from Eastern and Western Europe and the residents of New York's Harlem, and each group gives rise to a central plotline. In Harlem, ragtime-playing pianist Coalhouse Walker (Kyle Carter) intoxicates dancers with his rebel­lious new type of music. In New Rochelle, a typical American family headed by Mother and Father (Jacqui Acuna and Tim Politano) lives a seemingly content life of economic success. Lastly, in the Lower East Side neighborhoods of New York, Latvian immigrant Tateh (Tim Masterton, also co-producer) strives, like millions of others, to capture his piece of the great American pie. 
If, for any reason, a potential audi­ence member were contemplating not seeing "Ragtime," Kyle Carter's per­formance as Coalhouse Walker should and will overwhelmingly per­suade them to change their mind as soon as possible. Carter is remark­able in a role most doubted could be even adequately filled; he is magnet­ic, sweet, affable, powerful and alto­gether extraordinary. 
The depths of his surprisingly impressive voice and his mastery of Coalhouse's emotional range are striking, and, to his credit, his strengths as a performer firmly anchor the show. 
Acuna, as well, demonstrates her notable skill as a musical theater actress, playing the role of the unknowingly forward-thinking Mother with grace and subtlety, as well as her possessing a simply beau­tiful voice. 
Other cast members of particular note include Will McAuliffe as Younger Brother, a man seemingly lost in the early twentieth century's tumultuous change who finds an unexpected calling; Allison Giovinazzo as Evelyn Nesbitt, a scan-dal-ridden media darling whose moral ambiguities capture the atten­tion of a nation; Andrew Wright as Booker T. Washington, a figure whose educated, peace-conscious attitude towards race relations comes in jarring conflict with episodes of racially motivated vio­lence. 
The play asks several difficult ques­tions of its audience about the truth­fulness of possibility and social mobility in America -specifically the America of a century ago, with the existence of Jim Crow laws and dirty tenements rampant, but these questions are, no doubt, still very meaningful for audiences today. With symbols of great promise, like Coalhouse's beloved Ford Model T, come also failure, unhappiness and death. The cast does a fine job of articulating the nuances of these issues, well aided by the strength of the source material.

Nuggets forward Carmelo Anthony was not one of seven reserves named to the Western Conference All-Star team. Anthony was suspended for 15 games earlier this season due to a fight against the Knicks. 
Anthony left off All-Star roster 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -One bad night may have overshad­owed all the good Carmelo Anthony has done this sea­son. 
The NBA's leading scorer was not among the seven reserves announced Thursday night for the Western Conference team that will play in the NBA All-Star game. 
Denver teammate Allen Iverson was chosen, extending his streak of consecutive All-Star appearances to eight. He started the last seven games while playing for Philadelphia. Anthony, who is averaging 31.3 
points but missed 15 games while suspended for his role in the brawl at Madison Square Garden, 
was  the  most  obvious  
omission.  
Earlier  Thursday,  

Anthony said he hoped his suspension wouldn't pre­vent him from earning his first All-Star spot. 
"I hope no one holds that over my head over any­thing," he said. "Things happen. One incident like that is held over one per­son's head, life ain't fair. 
"I did my punishment. I could've easily kept my name out there by appeal­ing it and doing other stuff about it, but I just did my 15 games suspension and 
IN BRIEF 

Retired Nf\ players lobby for 
better pensions 
MIAMI -They limp through life, often too proud to ask for handouts but desperately in need of help. They are the aging NFL retirees and, as a rule, the older they are, the less they receive from the league's pension and disability funds. 
"An embarrassment," is what famed former player and coach Mike Ditka called it. 
"Twenty percent of nothing is noth­ing," former Bills offensive lineman Joe DeLamielleure said. 
Ditka, DeLamielleure and another Hall of Farner, Lem Barney, joined one­time Packers star Jerry Kramer on Thursday to promote Kramer's endeavor to auction championship rings and other valuable memorabilia to raise money for their fellow retirees. 
Ditka described the situation as "shameful," saying he received a $100,000 donation from an owner of a sport other than football. 
hopefully put that behind us." 
Steve Nash, Amare Stoudemire and Shawn Marion were all chosen from the Phoenix Suns, but Dirk Nowitzki was the only player picked from the Dallas Mavericks, who have the league's best record. The Mavericks had been hoping Josh Howard would be selected as well. 
Detroit and New Jersey had multiple reserves picked for the Feb. 18 game. Chauncey Billups and Richard Hamilton, who both made their first appearances last season, are going back, and Jason Kidd and Vince Carter will represent the Nets in the game at UNLV's Thomas & Mack Center. 
Indiana's Jermaine O'Neal and first-timers Dwight Howard of Orlando and Caron Butler of Washington round out the East reserves. 
The seven reserves were voted on by the head coaches in their respective conferences. Coaches couldn't vote for their own players, and had to select two forwards, two guards, a center and two players regardless of their posi­tion. 
The remainder of the West reserves were San Antonio guard Tony Parker and Utah forward Carlos Boozer. 

Concussion forces Matheny to 
retire after 13 seasons 
SAN FRANCISCO -Mike Matheny's decision to retire was made for him. His doctor refused to clear the long­time catcher to play in 2007 after a concussion sidelined him for the final four months of last season. 
Matheny's announcement Thursday that he is hanging up his catching gear after 13 major league seasons came as no surprise. He didn't play again for the San Francisco Giants after May 31 following a series of foul tips he took in the mask -and doctors warned him that he was more susceptible to even further damage if he received another blow. 
"This is not a shoulder, a knee or an elbow," Matheny said on a conference call. "We're talking about the brain .... I didn't expect this. I don't think any­body did." 
In early December, Matheny under­went another extensive battery of tests at the Sports Concussion Program. 
Judge allows negligence 
lawsuit against NFL 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -A federal judge ruled Thursday that Korey Stringer's widow can proceed with her negligence lawsuit against the NFL and equipment maker Riddell Inc. over his heatstroke death. 
Kelci Stringer sued the league and Riddell following her husband's death in 2001, claiming the NFL hadn't done enough to insure that equipment used by players protected them from injuries or deaths caused by heat-related illnesses. 
Korey Stringer, a 335-pound line­man for the Minnesota Vikings, died from heatstroke after he practiced in the sweltering heat and humidity that pushed his body temperature to 
108.8 degrees. He was 27. 
Judge John Holschuh dismissed one of the lawsuit's claims, in which Kelci Stringer argued that the NFL didn't set proper guidelines for prac­ticing in the heat.

Seminoles visit ND for weekend matches

NO TRACK 
Team faces home challenge 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame has had a lot of success this season, but will face its biggest test of the season when it competes in the Meyo Invitational this weekend at the Loftus Center. 
The Meyo Classic is the high­light of Notre Dame's indoor season with top teams from across the country participating. 
The Irish have started the season strong, with multiple qualifiers for both the men and women's teams. The last time the squad competed at the Notre Dame Invitational Jan. 26, 31 Irish athletes qualified for the Big East championships later this month including six Notre Dame male mile runners. 
Notre Dame's female team was just as impressive in the distance events, with two Irish athletes qualifying for the mile and 3,000 meter races. 
Both teams have also per­formed well in the sprint events, with each gender sending at least one runner to the confer­ence championship in the 60, 100, 200 and 400-rneter dashes. 
Despite having such success in almost every event, Irish coach Joe Piane said that every event is critical to the team's success. 
"We need to have good per­formances to ·get us prepared for the Big East meet," he said. "So may it be the 60 meter dash or the 35 pound weight, we need to perform well in order to be prepared properly for the Big East championship." 
The main event of the Meyo Invitational every year is the "Meyo Mile" in which the top distance runners from across the country compete. This year, Notre Dame will provide some of that talent, including junior Jake Watson and senior Todd Ptacek, who run the mile in 4:03 and 4:05, respectively. 

"It should be a very, very good run," Piane said of the meet's signature event. "Hopefully we'll have somebody approaching four or at least approaching four." 
With only one meet remaining before the Big East champi­onship, the Irish will have to try· to accumulate as many confer­ence bids as possible this week­end. The only remaining meet this season is the Windsor Team Challenge, and Piane said he is not sure of how many competi­tors he is going to send. 
"So we really gotta jump on the horse real quick and get some kids qualified," Piane said. "And we've done it on the women's side and the men's side." 
Overall, Piane has been pleased with his team's per­formance in the indoor season. Piane said that so far the team is accomplishing its goals for the indoor track season. 
"Our goal is always to do well at the Big East and hopefully at the NCAAs. So the first step is to get as many kids qualified for the Big East as possible," he said. "Generally we have 28 to 30 or 32 per gender qualified and I think we're pretty close to that now. 
"We'll get a few this week­end."

Irish prepare for Midwest Duals 
Bednarski will not rest top competitors

"It is important that we do well against them," he said, adding that falling into a false sense of security could hurt the Irish after last week's tough competition. 
Bednarski said he expects the competition to feature at least one or two high-quality fencers among the weaker squads. 
"Sometimes one of them is better, and we will try to show that no one, even good, can ... beat our fencers," he said.

Miami and a four-point lead over third-place Michigan. 
The "nation's best" label is not the only milestone possible for the Irish this weekend. With one more conference win, Notre Dame will set a program record with 16 league wins in one season -currently the Irish are tied with the 1981-82 and 1998-99 teams at 15 wins. 
"We've proved we can play with pretty much everybody we've played," Jackson said. "We haven't played New Hampshire or Minnesota or those teams. But within our conference we've shown we can play pretty much against anybody." 
Bowling Green has had very few bright spots in a sub-par season, but one came last weekend when the Falcons picked up a 2-2 tie against Alaska. The Falcons have only two scorers with more than 20 points -Jonathan Matsumoto (24} and Derek Whitmore (20} -and are in last place not only in the standings, but also in team offense (1.86 goals per game), team defense (4.0:3

The Irish met the Falcons in a two-game home series earlier in the season with Notre Dame sweeping 5-2 and 4-0, but that hasn't kept Jackson from fret­ting more over this weekend than over Miami. 

"I get more nervous about these games, than I do about Miami of Ohio because I know 
our guys will be as ready to play as they need to be [against Miami]," he said. "This is part of us becom­ing a good team, being a good team is going to be able to respond coming off a tough week­end against Miami and then going into Bowling 
Green, playing a team that's last in the standings." 
Irish goalie Dave Brown ­who came up big against the RedHawks with 40 saves on 43 shots faced in two games ­will most likely start Friday night against the Falcons, but Saturday's starting goalie depends on several factors, Jackson said. 
It depends on the number of shots Brown faces in the first game and if he appears fresh when the time comes Saturday, Jackson said. 
Jackson said that in order to help keep Brown physically and mentally ready, he gives the goaltender days off where he does not have to put on his equipment, but only does car­diovascular training. 
"Keeping him from putting his equipment on everyday is the key," Jackson said. 
The puck will drop in both games at 7:05 p.m., but it will not televised locally.

[Kessler]." 

Kessler -the Belles' leading scorer -has not been the focal point of Saint Mary's offense during the streak. Aside from Newsom, guard Bridget Lipke has averaged 13.8 points per game in the four-game stretch. Henley said center Anna Kammrath has also improved over the season. 
"Anna really stepped up and worked her butt off," Henley said. "She's incredibly coach­able, she's in great shape and she has a good understanding of the game. We want to work on shot selection and get her stronger in the paint, but she's played very well. 
"Neither Kammrath or Newsome were starting at the beginning of the season. That shows you how hard they worked." 
Regardless of her lessened impact on the team's offense, Kessler hasn't slowed down. She dropped a career-high 33 points 
HOOK, LINE AND SINKER 
Wednesday against Olivet, and is now 28 points shy of 1,000 for her career. 
"As only a junior, that's amaz­ing," Henley said. "She'll get it. The only question is whether she'll get it at home or on the road." 
Kammrath and Newsom will have their hands full against Calvin's inside game. Forwards Lisa Winkle-who averages 9.4 boards per game -and Marcia Harris seal up the inside. 
Calvin has made 47.4 percent of its field goals and 37 percent from three-point range, a facet of their game that will take away the option of playing a zone defense. Combined with the post play, Calvin poses a potent threat. The way the Belles are playing, however, cre­ates palpable excitement. 
"We're the ones that played them closest, with a one-point loss," Henley said, referring to the 53-52 Belles loss on Jan. 6. The Belles came a missed free­throw away from forcing over­time.

"And you remember last year, it was the same team that got to the Big East final and they're on a seven-game winning streak, so they're on a roll," McGraw said. 
One of the key factors for the Irish in defending against the Mountaineers will again be the play of Notre Dame's freshmen trio of guards Ashley Barlow and Melissa Lechlitner and center Erica Williamson. 
'They're outscoring most of the teams we've played," McGraw said. "When all of them are freshmen you expect a little inconsistency and certainly we've had that. But overall I'm really pleased." . 
Against the Panthers, Williamson was one of the few bright spots for the Irish, notch­ing 10 points and eight boards in the loss. 
"I think Erica Williamson in particularly lately has really, really stepped up her game. She's given us great production of the bench both rebounding, scoring and defense," McGraw said. 
Barlow and Lechlitner have been effective in some games this season, McGraw added, but their inconsistency off the bench has hurt the Irish in some games. 
''I'm looking for Melissa Lechlitner to continue to shoot the ball and be aggressive attacking. And Ashley Barlow, same thing," she said. "I think all three of them -they need to take more active roles and not sit back and wait for the upperclass­men to take over."

as stellar as possible so that no one can put you down or complain.*** 
TAURUS (Apri120-May 20): Take a very secretive approach to everything you 
do and you will be able to accomplish so much more. A new partnership will be 
iffy but that shouldn't stop you from getting to know this person better. **** 
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): An older individual can have a profound impact on 
your life today, especially in your future plans. Emotional matters will only get in 
the way of discovering what you are truly capable of doing. Be totally professional

person. If you are single, you'll meet someone new. Be careful if traveling. ***** 
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Travel, trying new things and expanding your interests 
should all be penciled in today. A partnership will take on a new flavor but be sure 
it's going in a direction suitable to your future plans. Anger will get you nowhere. 
*** 

VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Open up new doors that will lead to a more challenging

might enjoy doing. Don't mince words with someone who has far more knowledge. *** 
LffiRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): Look at the big picture and you will get some creative

No. 2 Notre Dame vies for top ranking at BGSU 
Jackson not distracted by teamfs success 
By KYLE CASSILY News Writer 

A No. 2 unanimous national ranking with several first-place votes in the last month of a long regular season means nothing. At least that's what the Irish say. 
"The ranking is insignificant until if and when we get to Joe Louis Arena -and having to win there," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said in reference to the CCHA semifinals and champi­onship in Detroit in March. 
Coaches usually walk a mod­est line, but their players can sometimes be a little more forthcoming. Right? 
"Rankings are nice-they're nice to see sometimes -but we try to focus on every weekend coming up," sophomore left wing Garrett Regan said. "Right now where we're ranked isn't as important. Obviously we just want to keep playing as well as we can, and the rankings will take care of themselves." 
Guess not. 

But, whether they like it or not, the Irish name will come up across the country this weekend whenever national rankings are discussed, as the CCHA-leading icers travel to Bowling Green for a two-game series against the last-place Falcons. The first-ever No. 1 ranking in program history could hang on the Irish mantle, if only temporarily, with a sweep -and a little bit of Black Bear help. 
If No. 9 Maine can take one -or both ends -of a bitter two-game series in the tiny vil­lage of Durham, N.H., against its archrival No. 1 New Hampshire this weekend, the pollsters could vault the Irish ahead of the Wildcats. 
"To be [the] No. 1 ranked team, it doesn't bother me,"

From start to finish 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 

Even though Notre Dame defeated South Florida handi­ly at the Joyce Center Jan. 21, there are plenty of reasons for the Irish to avoid looking past the Saturday contest against the Bulls in Tampa. 
On the year, the Bulls (11­11, 2-6 Big East) are 8-4 at home. Meanwhile, the No. 19/21 Irish (18-4, 6-3 Big East) have struggled away from the Joyce Center, win­ning just two of their six games on the road. 
"We would be really na1ve and not very smart to think it is going to be easy down there. They're healthier and they've played well at home," Notre Dame coach Mike Brey

Irish look to beat WVU, end losing streak 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 

Notre Dame is hoping to end its current three-game skid, but may have to wait as they face off against a surging West Virginia squad Sunday at 5:30 p.m. at the JACC. 
The Irish (13-8, 4-4 Big East) are returning home after a three­game road trip in which the team failed to win a game. Meanwhile, the Mountaineers (15-7, 6-3 Big East) have taken a different route, winning seven straight and eight of their last ten games. 
"They're playing really well right now; they're in fourth or fifth place in the Big East," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "So it's kind of a tough game to be coming off a three-game losing streak to face." 
In the Irish's last game out against Pittsburgh, they failed to put two strong halves together and were outscored 45-34 in the second half en route to a 71-62 loss. One of the main factors in the team's losses over the road trip according to McGraw was the team's dependence on guard Charel Allen. 
"We need to get a little more from everyone. I think that we're relying on Charel Allen a little bit 
see ALLEN/page 18 Jackson said. "But fame is fleeting." 


The Irish (21-5-2, 15-3-2 CCI-lA) come into the series against Bowling Green (5-22-1, 3-17-1 CCI-lA) after an emotion­al win and tie at home with No. 10 Miami last weekend that strengthened Notre Dame's iron grip on first place in the CCHA. With eight garries remaining in the regular season, the Irish have a three-point lead over

SMC rests, prepares for Calvin 
By BILL BRINK Sports Writer 
It would be tough to imagine -given the nature of the team's practice Thursday -the Belles are in the midst of a four-game winning streak and preparing for a road game at Calvin Saturday.

Shortly thereafter, cupcakes were distributed and as "Happy Birthday" was sung to forward Jane Fleming, who turned 19. After that, the team was dis­missed. 
"They've been playing hard," head coach Jennifer Henley said. "We don't want them to get burned out." 
The Belles are averaging 78.5 points over their last four games, 12 points above their season average. Leading the offense has been forward/center Erin Newsom. The sophomore -last week's MIAA Player of the Week -has averaged 19.3 points and 8.8 rebounds per game in the four-game stretch. 
"Newsom has come full circle on defense," Henley said. "But unless you're looking for it, you won't notice it.
