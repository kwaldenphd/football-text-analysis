In Brief 
The pursuit of parietal revision at this time was voted down at last night's joint meeting of the Saint Mary's Pro­gramming Board and Board ofGovernance. The boards voted 
12-6 to keep the present system requiring men to leave their IDs at a parietal desk. The new policy would still require an escort in the hall, but it would not be necessary for men to leave an ID at a parietal desk. Judicial Commissioner Mary Fisher has started a student committee, independent of stu­dent government, to rally support for the new policy. -The Observer

'Bull sessions' an essential part of college social experience 
"Yeah. well, one night I had two papers, a lab prep, a physics test. and my parents were in town. so I hadda take 'em out to dinner." 
'That's nothing_ -I had a philosophy prof once who-" 
"What was his name?" 
''Harmemwell. Man. he was a -" 
"Oh. yeah, I heard about him. He use to think that Ood and mankind were supposed to live on some kinda direct-link-type relationship, whatever that means. Zat so?" 
"1\inda. He felt that some sorta 'Ultimate Fulfill­ment' was the absolute director ofall our actions, and we have to try to get on some kinda com­munal level with it. Can you believe it? Anyway, Harmemwell made us write a full-scale philoso­phy dissertation every night ..." 
The scene: it always begins innocently enough. You walk into a friend's room across the hall, pick up a photo album, a high school yearbook, or some other personal artifact, and a conversation begins. You start talking about all the work you've got to do, your teachers, your future, God, life, the universe, etc. Amazing. isn't it, how speedily two and a half hours whizzes by when spent dis­cussing such relevant subjects? 
Before you know it, you've succumbed to a com­mon college phenomena: the bull session. Or shooting the bulL the breeze, the wind. A Rap session. A discussion. Chattin~. Talking. 
You can get into one at any time or place, with anybody; although roommates are ideal bull ses­sion partners. Think it's ironic the bull session most often schedules itself at those wee hours of the morning. when you're awake anyway because you're working on a term paper? 
It's not. The bull session is just another way to blow off responsibility: "avoiding the task at hand," as one of my management-majoring room­mates described it. The bull session is an oft­chosen alternative to studying. 
"Waste of time," my dad always said. That was a part of the wisdom he bestowed on me before I left Tennessee for my first year at Notre Dame. "Don't ever waste any time sitting around talking abouLnothing at all." 
After more than three years of plunging myself into topics such as politics, sports, religion, movies and other pressing social and existential concepts, I must admit that not a word I ever heard or spoke in one of these late-night talks was ever useful to me. 
Like the popular conversation game "Trivial Pur­suit." bull sessions are a medium of useless facts and knowledge. But are the sessions themselves useless? 
In his semi-autobiographical work "Life on the Mississippi." Mark Twain describes the rough

The Bull Session 

river-running keel-haulers who sat around, filling each others· ears with the wildest. most colorful lies. These river-day versions of the bull sessions often came to blows, of course, but nonetheless they always established one thing. 
They designated who was the boldest and most fearsome of the pack, the so-called Big Cheese, or the "Cock of the Walk," as they called him in those days. 
Today's bull sessions feature the same bravado and exaggeration that graced those earlier, more violent ones. Each tale imparts to its teller the chance to stand alone in the spotlight with his opinion, funny anecdote, or memorable experi­ence. The spotlight shifts to a different center of attention as often as the subject is changed, with reckless disregard for what's being talked about in the first place. 
It's down in the trenches of daily discussion that friendships are formed and strengthened. Dad was right about the uselessness of knowledge gained from shooting the bull with my buddies. But what he didn't realize was how memorable such times would be during my years at Notre Dame. 
That's why as long as there's chapters to be read, tests to study for and papers to write, they'll all suffer. Because there is also people to toss the bull around with. 
I have a German paper due tomorrow, but you know what I heard about this new parietals revi­sion proposal .. ?

Today, Wall Street firms are hiring more quantitative graduates than ever, and Salomon Brothers Inc. is no exception. A major invest­ment banking and market-making firm, we're Wall Streets leading employer of "quant" graduates. And since our research and tech­nologymanagement departments are the most respected in the industry; you'll be working with some of the top talent in your field.

P.O.BoxQ 
Appearance of student houses can draw crime 
Dear Editor: 
Although Mary Jacoby in her article of 
October 2, contrasts the student's con­
cern with crime in the Northeast neigh­
borhood and the neighborhood reis­
dents' concern with student parties, she 
did not explore a possible correlation be­
tween these two issues. 
We are one of the many university families who live in this neighborhood. In the past fifteen years we have had only one theft. .. a bicycle which was left out­side ofour garage. We have had no rocks thrown through our windows, our car has not been vandalized. How can it be that we have very little trouble and students have so much? 
Students are such wonderful targets for crime. Rather like attractive nuisances, they seem to invite thieves into our area. Our students are not the starving variety who have sold their extra shirt for a textbook; rather they come equipped with "$7,000 worth of jewelry and other items," which they consider indispen­sable in obtaining a higher education. Students are rich pickings. 
Not content with stocking a treasure trove for potential thieves, students then advertize thier location. Students may notice that permanent residents rarely hang banners across their porches, play their stereos at full volume or entertain large numbers of people in their front yards. We do not generally drag our couches outdoors to sunbathe or deco­rate the yard with litter. A casual drive through the neighborhood is all that is needed to pinpoint student houses. 
Houses earn reputations. While this year's student resident may be a paragon of prudence, last year's party crew may have firmly established the address as a student's house. Did you think to ask the landlord about previous burglary? 
Residents of the Northeast Neighbor­
hood are concerned about crime. We do 
not like being considered a high-crime 
area (much less being considered thieves 
ourselves), we do not like the effect it has 
on our real estate value, we do not like 
the possibility that crime might spread 
from the student houses to our own. We 
don't even like students being robbed. 
But we are well aware that the problem 
will not be solved until all of the off­
campus students are willing to live in the 
neighborhood in a responsible manner.

More participants and trophies seen at runs 
Dear Editor: 

In response to Mark Weimholt's column "Non-Varsity Domer Runs too much in the Fast-Lane" (Sept. 29, 1986), I would like to clarify some information about the Domer Run. 
Really, the Domer Runs haven't changed as much as Weimholt thinks they have. Non-Varsity's goal has always been to provide a fun, safe and challenging event for both the recreational runner and the serious racer. 
In 1984, NVA added a three-mile run to give more runners at various levels the opportunity to participate. Incidentally, the growth of the three-mile run has been super -18 people ran in the first Domer 3, compared to 89 in the most recent one ( 113 three-milers signed up). 
We have continued to call the runs just that -the Domer Runs -instead of the Domer Races, for precisely the same reasons that Mark mentioned. We want fun-runners and competitors to be able t0 enjoy what we think are the best-run runs on campus. 
We have also been having door prizes at the runs the last couple of years to encourage all runners to participate, not just potential trophy winners. We did have more trophies this year than in the past. With as many runners as we have, we felt second place finishers deserved a trophy as well. 
The awards that were being handed out as Weimholt crossed the six-mile finish line were for the three-mile race. For the first time, NVA ran the three-and six-mile races simultaneously. We have always presented the three-mile awards at the conclusion of that run. Since there was over 41 minutes' difference between the first place three-miler and the last place six-miler, we didn't think it was fair to ask those being presented awards to wait. Presenting awards for the shorter run before the conclusion of the longer one is a common practice. 
The Domer Runs and their sister race the Irish Spring Runs have been very popular events at Notre Dame. We're glad that people like Mark Weimholt and his friend Chris enjoy participating 'just-for­the-fun-of-it." We'll be cheering for you in the spring.

Best start ever for Women'~ Golf Club 
Many clubs had to tangle with both opposing schools and rainy weather conditions across the Mid­west this weekend, but that was no problem for the Women's Golf Club. 
Off to its best season ever, the golfers participated yesterday in a tournament at Evansville, a city which had not seen rain all week. 
In matches prior to yesterday, Notre Dame placed third out of nine teams in its own Labor Day tourn­ament. came in second out of I 2 teams in the Loras College Invitational on September 19, and got an­other second-place finish in a five-team tournament the following weekend at Franklin College. 
'This is our best year so far," said Club President Laura Gleason. "This is our fourth or fifth year of existence, and we've never placed first or second in a tournament before this year... 
The club has managed to accomplish all this despite losing Saint Mary's freshman Amy Junius, the top player in the season-opening match, for the remainder of the year due to illnesses. Golfers pick­ing up the slack have included Gleason, Meghan Bar­rett. Carolyn Burke, Melissa Houk, Mary Huffman, ;md M.C. Malloy. 
Following the Evansville tournament. the golfers close the season this weekend with a tournament in Purdue. Gleason showed cautious optimism about their outlook for this match -their biggest of the year. 
"We usually don't come out as well in the standings because the competition's so good. I say we'll be in about the middle of the pack," said Gleason. "We usually don't beat the lower-level varsity teams like DePauw and Evansville, but I expect to beat them and end even give some of the schools like Purdue some competition... 
Notre Dame defeated DePauw and Evansville ear­lier in the season. 

Steve Megargee 
Club Corner 

Evansville might not have seen much rain last week, but Milwaukee had buckets full, making the Rugby Club's match at Marquette on Saturday a low­scoring affair. 
Neil Garrison scored a try for the Irish, then added the two-point kick to provide all the Notre Dame points in a 6-4 victory. The B team fell to Marquette, 14-6, with Jack Regis scoring a try in a losing cause. 
"The conditions were really sloppy because it had been raining for about two weeks there, .. said Club President Quentin Williams. "We got good play from our special teams, and that helped a lot... 
With a 2-3 record, the club will take a week off from competition to hold its alumni game on Satur­day behind the Stepan Center. 
Also having to play in terrible conditions, the Wo­men's Soccer Club lost two games over the weekend to fall to 5-6. 
The Irish lost to Hope, 5-1, last Friday, and fell to Marquette, 3-1, on Sunday. Susan McConville got the only Notre Dame goal against Hope, and Kate Tit­terton scored on an assist from Kerry Haverkamp against Marquette. 
"Marquette was a really tough game. We played well, but they did too, .. said Club Secretary Susan Haling. "Friday we didn't get it together, and we weren't playing as well as usual. The weather made the fields really tough... 
Notre Dame next plays Saint Mary's in a home game tomorrow. The Irish will be trying to avenge a 2-1 overtime loss to the Belles on September I 2. 
Rain even forced the shortening ofevents in places as far as Ontario, but it did not keep the Rowing Club from coasting to another successful showing last weekend. 
Competing in the Head of the Trent at Peterboro, Ontario, the women's eight placed first. and three men's eights finished fifth, sixth, and tenth. 
Because it rained throughout the regatta, the course was shortened from two and a half miles to just over two miles. 
"Overall we did a lot better than last year," said Club President Joe Brunetti. "The women's finish was particularly impressive because there were a lot of tough Canadian teams out there. The women's pro­gram is really taking off this year." 
Rowers will next compete in the Alumni Row at the 
boathouse on Saturday from 8 a.m. till noon. 
After not playing last weekend, the Water Polo Club 
is looking forward to a tournament in Dayton, Ohio, 
next weekend. The four-team tournament will include 
Dayton, Miami (Ohio), Kenyon, and Notre Dame. 
"I think we can do really well," said Club President 
Dave Patchin. "We're in a lot better shape than we 
were in the first tournament... 
About 30 students are preparing to get their first 
taste of boxing experience in the Novice Bouts on 
the week before Fall Break. The Novice Bouts are a 
fall prelude to Notre Dame's traditional springtime 
charity Bengal Bouts. 
"It's just for anyone who wants to learn boxing techniques who has never boxed before, and if they want to go on to the Bengals, that's fine," said Boxing Club President Thomas Newell. 

Women's tennis falls to Michigan State in close match, 6-3 
By SHEILA HOROX Sports Writer 
One service break and two points in the tiebreaker. That's how close the Notre Dame wo­men's tennis team came to beating Michigan State on Satur­day. Instead, the Irish fell to the Spartans 6-3, dropping thier overall season record to 0-3. 
It was the kind of loss where a coach just takes a deep breath and says, "tough match... Four of the six singles matches went to three sets. 
Freshman Stephanie Tolstedt registered the only Irish win in singles competition. Tolstedt defeated Marimar Alonso, 0-6, 6­2, 7-5.

Alice Lohrer, Tammy Schmidt. and Resa Kelly were also involved in close three set matches. Loh­rer lost to Tracy Balagna, 3-6, 6-2, 7-5. Schmidt fell to Nancy Redman, 6-2, 2-6, 7-6 (10-8 tie­breaker), and Kelly was defeated by Sara Ramirez, 6-2, 6-7, 6-1. 
Head Coach Michele Gelfman was quick to point out that of the four matches that lasted three sets, the Irish dropped the opening set in three of those matches yet were able to main­tain their composure and force a third and deciding set. 
"We had problems in our opening sets but we made the necessary adjustments and per­formed really well," said Gelfman. "All the matches were close and a few points made the difference in us winning and losing." 
B.P. undefeated 
In the other singles matches, Michelle Dasso lost to Kathleen Monczka, 7-5, 6-3, and Natalie Illig came up short againstJoelle Lukasiewicz, 6-3, 6-2. 
The bright spot for the Irish had to be the play of the doubles teams, which took two of three 
matches.  
The  number- one  doubles  
team  of  Dasso  and  Tolstedt  
chalked  up  a  win  against  

Monczka and Balagna, 6-3, 6-2, raising their doubles record to 5-4. Playing at the number-three doubles position, Schmidt and Kelly defeated Lukasiewicz and Ramirez, 6-4, 6-2. 
Lohrer and Illig. the second­seeded doubles team lost to Red­man and Alonso, 6-0, 6-1. Gelfman attributes the lop-sided score to the flawless play of the MSU team. 
Everything (Redman and Alonso) did, worked," said Gelfman. "Every shot went their way. The score doesn't reflect how well Alice and Natalie played." 
The doubles teams continue to improve every week, and their hard work is definately paying off. 
"At Michigan State we were able to execute the things we've been emphasizing in practice," Gelfman said. 
The Irish don't have time to dwell on the loss. They travel today to Milwaukee to face North Star Conference opponent Mar­quette. The Irish are seeking their fourth consecutive NSC title, and today's match will have a direct bearing on the seedings for the NSC championship. 

P .E. holds off Farley, 20-14 
By KATHY BERRY Sports Writer 
Breen-Phillips is the only un­defeated team left in women's ln­terhall football arter Pasquerilla East downed Farley, 20-14, in the completion of their suspended game. 
Starting with 6:43 lert to play in the game, Farley scored on their first drive with a thirty-five yard touchdown pass from Marilu Almeida to Sue Shelton. The two-point conversion was successful, tying the game at 14. 
The Farley defense held P.E. on three downs. But on fourth down and fourteen, Colleen Don­nally connected with her favorite receiver, Annie Shrenk. for a thirty-five yard game-winning touchdown. Pasquerilla East failed to convert and the score stood at 20-14.

Farley got the ball back but could not.produce anything.

In the B P -Lewis game a con­troversial pass-interference call allowed B. P. to score the winning

AL playoffs start tonight  Associated Press 
BOSTON -Roger Clemens, the most dominant pitcher in baseball this season, said his injured right elbow was "1 00 percent" ready yesterday as the Boston Red Sox prepared to meet the California Angels in Game 1 of the American League playoffs. 
Clemens, who was 3-0 against the Angels this year, ad­mitted his elbow that was hit by a line drive last week was still "sore to touch." 
But the right-hander, who led the AL with a ·24-4 record and 2.48 earned-run average, said he would be fine to start Tuesday night's playoff opener against Mike Witt. 
"My arm's 100 percent," Clemens said. When pressed for details about his recovery, he firmly replied, "I don't want to talk about my arm anymore." 
Witt was 18-10 this year and 1-2 against Boston. Overall, the Angels won the season series 7-5, with the teams splitting six games at Fenway Park. 
While Clemens' problems may have cleared up, another injury clouded the outlook for the start of the best-of-seven series. 
Reggie Jackson, the Angels' designated hitter, again was in the postseason spotlight, nursing a left hand injured when he hit a dugout wall Saturday night during a game at Texas. california Manager Gene Mauch said the incident occurred when Jackson got upset after making an out. 
X-rays on Jackson's hand were negative, and he took batting practice Monday. 
Two other Boston players who had been slowed by minor injuries, third baseman Wade Boggs and catcher Rich Ged­man, were expected to start Game 1. 
Boggs, the major leagues' batting champion at .357, did not play in Boston's final four games because of a right hamstring injury. 
Miami retains top spot; Alabama shrinks lead 

Associated Press 
The University of Miami remained No. I Monday in The Associated Press' college foot­ball poll but second-ranked Ala­bama made up ground on the Hurricanes while Stanford and Mississippi State cracked the Top Twenty for the first time in five years. 
Miami, which climbed into the No. I spot last week after beating Oklahoma, cruised past Nor­thern Illinois 34-0 on Saturday for its fifth consecutive victory. The Hurricanes received 55 of 58 first-place votes and L 155 of a possible 1,160 points from a nationwide panel of sports writ­ers and sportscasters. 

Alabama also raised its record to 5-0 by defeating Notre Dame 28-I 0. The Crimson Tide received two first-place votes and 1,084 points. Last week, also with 58 voters participating, Miami led 56-1 in first-place votes and 1. 156-L 058 in points. 
The first nine teams are the 
same as last week. Third-ranked 
Nebraska edged South Carolina 
27-24 and received 988 points 
while Michigan remained No. 4 
with 959 points after downing 
Wisconsin 34-17. 
The other first-place ballot 
went to fifth-ranked Penn State, 
which knocked off previously un­
beaten Rutgers 31-6 and ·received 937 points. 
Sixth-ranked Oklahoma 
rebounded from its loss to Miami 
by crushing Kansas State 56-I 0 
and received 867 points. Auburn 
stayed seventh with 828 points 
by blasting Western Carolina 55­
6, Arkansas held onto eighth 
place with 726 points by whip­
ping Texas Christian 34-17 and 
Southern California remained 
No. 9 with 709 points thanks to 
a 35-21 triumph over Oregon. 
Arizona was idle, however, and 
slipped from I Oth to I I th while 
Iowa moved up from I I th to 
I Oth. The Hawkeyes turned back 
Michigan State 24-21 and 
received 614 points. 

Miracle finish 
Flanner wins battle of towers 
By KEVIN MCCORMACK Sports Writer 
Behind a play that Flanner coach Jim Fitzgerald called "a miracle," Flanner defeated Grace, 6-0, highlighting the third week of lnterhall football in the Parseghian Division, the league's most hotly contested bracket. 
On the game's final play, Flan­ner set up for an apparent game­winning field goal. However, the snap was too high for holder Dave Kelly and he scrambled to pick up the ball and get it to any open receiver in the endzone. He threw it towards the vicinity of Pete Kazmierczak, who was being covered. The ball was tipped, Kazmierczak fell down, but the ball fell in his chest as did the victory for Flanner. 
While most of the game was a defensive struggle, Flanner made a run at scoring several times in the second half. Twice, drives were halted by stingy fourth-down defensive stands of Grace deep inside Grace terri-

had rolled out of bounds, midfielder Rolfe Behrje was kicked in the knee by a Marquette player while on the ground. He is questionable for today's con­test with Akron with a contusion of the knee. 
Grace criticized the officiating, which he said was inconsistent and not in control of the game. 
In one situation, forward Pat Murphy was taken down from be­hind by a Warrior defender on a breakaway. The referee only gave the Irish a free kick, even though a yellow card usually is issued in such a situation. 
Forward Bruce "Tiger" McCourt also ended up on the short end of a referee's call. McCourt was tripped on the edge of the penalty area, but the ref­eree allowed play to continue. McCourt however, was caught retaliating and was issued a yel­low card. 
At first Grace thought that McCourt had dissented to the ref­eree. But when McCourt said he did not dissent, Grace entered the field while play was in prog­ress. 
"I wanted to know why (the ref­eree) had issued the yellow card," said Grace. 
In the rulebook, Grace's action 
is also a yellow-card offense, but 
the referee did nothing but to 
turn and give Grace an answer. 
"That just shows the lack of control he had in the game," said Grace. 
Grace was quick to point out, though, that the referee did not lose the game for the Irish. The Warriors controlled play much of the game. 
"The important point is that we were still in the game up til the end," noted Grace. "We launched an attack with 45 seconds left, and with a little luck, we could have tied it." 
Luck is currently running a little short for Notre Dame. Statistically they dominated the Wisconsin game on Friday, but the Badgers got the breaks and the 2-1 victory. 
"We're just in a rut right now," said Grace. "If we make a little mistake, the other team has capi­talized. We're in control of the game, but we haven't been able to put them away. 
"Ifwe would have had any luck, we would have won one of the three games." 
Today's game is the last for the Irish until they head east for a game against nationally­ranked Connecticut on Oct. 19. 
tory. Finally, after a key intercep­tion by Flanner with I :40 left in the game, Flarfner had one last opportunity. After several at­tempts to get the ball in the endzone, the clock ran down with six seconds remaining, setting the stage for the game's final dramatics. 
In other Parseghian games, Morrissey, behind freshman quarterback Joe Fuqua's one­yard touchdown run and five-yard pass to Joe Fiedler, shut out Keenan, 12-0. Dillon tied Off-Campus, 3-3. 
In Leahy division action, the anticipated matchup between undefeated Zahm and Stanford ended in a 14-0 Stanford victory. The option play was working to perfection for Stanford as they marched in for an early 7-0 lead. Then mistakes plagued the Zahmbies. 
On the ensuing kickoff, they fumbled on the five-yard line and three plays later the score was 14-0, Stanford, still in the first quarter. Inclement weather in the second half prohibited any offensive drves by both teams and when it was over, Zahm fell to 2-I while Stanford upped its record to 3-0. 
In other Leahy play, Holy Cross defeated Pangborn 6-0, while Cavanaugh put to rest any chances of Alumni defending its lnterhall title, by defeating the depleted Dogs, 3-0. 
Finally, in the Rockne division, Sarin continued its run for the lnterhall title by easily defeating St. Ed's, 14-0. The Screaming Ot­ters utilized their balanced attack of a timely passing game com­bined with the strong running of John Kennedy. 
In other Rockne play, Howard dumped Fisher 15-0,

Are you serious? You mean the baseball playoffs really start today? 
I guess I've been so caught up in trying to figure out when (or if) Notre Dame is ever going to win another big football game, that I completely forgot that the World Series is coming up soon. 
So let's talk baseball. 
On second thought. let me tell you a story about baseball, with my apologies for leaving Houston and California out of the tale because they probably don't have a chance anyway, and because I didn't see them play this past summer. 
I did, however, have the good fortune (or bad for­tune in one case) of getting out to Boston's Fenway Park and New York's Shea Stadium over the summer for a couple of ballgames. Each was only four hours from the Upstate New York city I worked in, and, as Harry Caray might say, you can't beat fun at the old ballpark. 
Harry Caray couldn't have meant Shea Stadium. 
New York was first. The first-place Mets were playing my favorite team (yes, I admit to being a Cub fan) and my friend and I had what we thought were good seats -yeah, right. 
I had never been to the City and I must admit that I despised the obnoxious Mets even before I stepped out of the car and onto a rain-drenched parking lot. My friend and I were greeted by about 30-40 ticket scalpers and a few winos just outside the stadium ­a large, dirty, semicircular structure, in which any seat above the mezzanine level gives you a good 

shot at flagging down the airplanes which fly over­head every five minutes. 
If you haven't seen the Mets this season (four of them ~ven have mugshots in United States post of­fices for messin~ with a police officer in a Houston

bar), then you've missed perhaps the most class-less team organized sport has ever seen. 
Just take a look at the hot-dog antics ofGary Carter as he taunts opposing pitchers while rounding the bases, or the way Len Dykstra snaps his glove at pop-ups·. Or how about the hot-tempered Jesse Orosco storming off the field when pulled from a game by that gentleman ofgentlemen, skipper Davey Johnson. 
With the score tied in the bottom of the eighth, Johnson sent in Tim Teufel (jailbird no. I) to pinch hit. Teufel had blasted an extra-inning grand slam three days earlier, but walked back to the dugout to a chorus of boo's this time after flying out to end the inning. Talk about spoiled fans. 
Then Keith Moreland homered to win it for the Cubbies, and I was pelted in the back of the head with assorted food Items for simply standing up and cheering. Needless to say, we left town quickly. don't plan on returning soon. 
I thought Boston might be even worse. I can't say I have ever disliked the Red Sox, but if Sox fans were anything like Celtic fans, I figured we'd be in for a long day. 
Especially since I was rooting for the Chicago White Sox. 
Much to my surprise, however, I was ove!Whelmed with the atmosphere of Fenway Park. I thought Wrigley Field was the next-best thing to Heaven, but now I'm not so sure. People were actually friendly, and the fans gave Red Sox' pitcher Dennis 'Oil Can' Boyd a standing ovation in his first game since walking out on the team a few games earlier. 
Mets fans would have run him out of town. 
The White Sox won the game, and I even left with a clean shirt on my back. I stuck around for a few minutes afte!Wards to soak up the tradition of Fen­way, and to say 'good-bye' to the friends I had made in the surrounding seats. 
Now, it's playoff time, and the two teams I saw this summer are the favorites to do battle in the World Series. 
To Houston and California: Good luck, you'll need it. To Boston: Do us all a favor and humiliate the Mets in four straight. 
And to the New York Mets: Watch out for one angry Notre Dame student above your dugout. armed with a sloppy hot dog. the next time you set foot on Wrigley Field grass.
