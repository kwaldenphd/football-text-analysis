SacrificeforLenthclpsone become a better Christian 
Lent always seems to creep up when I least expect it, and often when I need it most. In the pre-spring lull, when everything is grey and everyone seems preoccupied with the monotonous happenings of acadamia, out of nowhere comes Ash Wednesday. Catholics go to mass, get a cross smeared on their foreheads and are forced to think about Lent for the simple reason that they are marked as Catholic. 
The first thought that crosses my mind each year is what to give up for forty days. This act of penitence is an attempt to bring Christ back into my life. God has become a distant priority in my hectic, self-created reality of deadlines and overcommitment. Lent is a chance to reflect on the things that really matter in this world. 
Doing penitence during Lent is a personal tradition for me rather than something the church imposes upon me. I usually pick some­thing that will be hard to give up, but something I could do without anyway. One year I gave up caffine. Another year I quit putting salt on my food. (The "salt of the earth" is not necessarily good for the body.) 
By Easter I had lost my craving for salt as well as the psychological need for caffine. When I asked what others were giving up, I often got responses like, "I'm giving up going on hot dates seven nights a week." A common one was always, "I'm going to give up studying." The fact that these people decided not to take Lent seriously strengthened my own conviction. I had to ask myself, "Why am I doing this? Does it really matter?" Yes, it does. Christ gave up his life for us. The least I can do is participate in a simple mind game that forces me to re­member that. 
Oh, sure, we give up meat on Fridays during Lent. At Notre Dame, it's pretty difficult not to. The dining hall always serves seafood on Fridays, Lent included. The endless debate ensues. Does this lack of choice make the fast from meat meaningless? My first response is that we're missing the point. The dining hall recognizes that the majority of the campus will not eat meat on fast days during Lent for ob­vious religious reasons. Half of those people are usually grateful for this. They are the ones that fully intend to abstain, but occasionally forget. Secondly, the people who complain for "democratic reasons" about not being given a choice, are usually not going to give anything up in the first place. 
Lent is an excellent time to become closer to Christ. Spiritually, it's even better than Christmas. With all of the hype and con­sumerism, people are too distracted to find

Christ at Christmas. Lent comes without last­minute shopping or finals, during the slow part of winter, when there is time for reflection. 
We owe it to ourselves to take time out for prayer. If you don't know how to pray, take the time to find out how. We should be careful in choosing what to give up for Lent. The real motive behind giving up alcohol might be a slowly developing beer gut. Cutting out sweets will reduce the dentist bill, but will it bring you closer to God? 
I have a dozen things I could give up to make me a better person. Which of these will strengthen my spirituality? Perhaps we should give up not doing certain things. I could give up not volunteering my time to service organ­izations, or give up not praying. I need to choose a commitment that will provide more than a personal gain. 
Christ is easiest found in others. By sacrific­ing some of my time, I might find Christ through volunteer work or joining a scripture group. It will bring me to a better understanding of my faith during a season that encourages reflec­tion. Besides, I can always give up procrastina­tion next year.

Security Beat Negotiators continue missile talks 
Sunday 12:10 p.m.-Three male white subjects were ejected from Grace Hall as they attempted to distribute adver­tising pamphlets throughout the dormitory. 
Monday 2 p.m. -A female student reported that a man in­decently exposed himself out­side the Memorial Library. The victim was sitting in the first floor of the library. Upon hearing a knock on the window, she observed the man with his pants open. This report is similar to numerous others oc­curring over the past two years. It appears that the suspect may have a vehicle in the immediate area, as he has been seen fleeing east from the library toward the Juniper Road parking lots. The suspect is described as a white man, about 30 years old, sandy blonde or brown hair with a receding hairline, possibly some facial hair, a round face and stocky build. Security is as­king anyone with information 
about the suspect to call the of­
fice at 239-5555. 
2:25 p.m. -Security received a report of a hit-and-run accident in the Memorial Library Circle. The victim's vehicle received approximately $200 in damage. 
Tuesday 12:32 a.m. ­Security investigated the break­in of a vehicle parked on Green Field. Although the car was locked, a vent window was bro­ken to gain entry. An AMFM stereo cassette radio was removed forcibly, causing damage to the dash area. A screwdriver was found in the ve­hicle and is believed to have been used by the suspect or suspects. The damage and loss were estimated at $165. 
9:25a.m. -A Keenan Hall res­ident reported the loss of his wallet from his jacket pocket while he was attending the Notre Dame-Brooklyn basket­ball game the night before.

GENEVA -U.S. and Soviet teams continued talks on medium-range nuclear mis­siles and President Reagan said the Americans would pres­ent new proposals Wednesday, when this round of talks originally had been scheduled to end. 
Maynard Glitman and Lem Masterkov led the U.S. and So­viet negotiators in Tuesday's meeting. Soviet spokesman Al­exander Monakhov said they talked for about 90 minutes at the Soviet Mission, but he gave no details. 
Max Kampelman and Yuli Vorontsov, chiefs of the two delegations, had a luncheon meeting Tuesday to discuss procedure. 
During an appearance in the White House briefing room in Washington, Reagan said: "I welcome the statement by So­viet Secretary-General Gor­bachev on Saturday that the So­viet Union will no longer insist tion in INF (Intermediate Nu­clear Force) to agreements in other negotiations." 
Mikhail Gorbachev, the So­viet leader, proposed that the superpowers reach an agree­ment apart from other arms negotiations on eliminating medium-range missiles from Europe in five years. 
Reagan said he would bring 
U.S. negotiators home for con­sultations at the end of this week and, "following these dicussions in Washington I will send a team back to Geneva to take up once again the detailed negotiations for an INF reduc­tion agreement." 
He said he had told the Amer­ican team to begin presenting the U.S. proposals Wednesday and added: "I hope that the So­viet Union will then proceed with us to serious discussion of details which are essential to translate areas of agreement in principle to a concrete agree­ment." 
Among issues to be resolved, he said, "none is more impor­
on linking agreement on reduc-tant than verification. We will

continue to insist that any 
agreement will be effectively 
verifiable." 
U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms 

negotiations in Geneva are in 
three areas: medium-range 
missles; long-range, or strate­
gic weapons; and the fields of 
defense and space. 
Gorbachev's offer reversed 

the Soviet position, taken after 
his Iceland summit with 
Reagan last October, that 
agreement on medium-range 
nuclear forces must be tied to 
the U.S. strategic Defense Ini­
tiative. 
The space-based defense 

project, commonly called 
"Star Wars," has been a major 
sticking point since the Geneva 
talks began two years ago. 
Moscow has insisted the United 
States curtail research, but 
Washington refuses to accept 
limits. 
In the latest Soviet attack on 

Star Wars, a speech delivered 
Tuesday by the chief Soviet del­
egate to the 40-nation Geneva 
Conference on Disarmament, 
Yuri Nazar kin said: 
"whatever its 'defensive' 
labels, (it) is designed to alter 
the balance of forces to the ad­
vantage of the United States." 
He reaffirmed the new Soviet 

position that a deal on medium­
range missiles no longer is con­
ditional on agreement about 
Star Wars. 
Pravda, the Soviet Commu­nist Party newspaper, quoted Gorbachev on Tuesday as call­ing a medium-range weapons agreement a "tremendous" step toward others on arms re­duction and regional conflicts. 
His proposal would affect the 316 U.S. pershing 2 and cruise missiles deployed in Western Europe and Soviet SS-20s. Western officials estimate 441 SS-20s are deployed in the So­viet Union. 
Gen. Sergei Akhromeyev, the Soviet army chief of staff, said Monday that 243 were aimed at Europe. The rest presumably are in Asia. 
Under the Gorbachev pro­posal, each nation could retain 100 warheads on its own terri­tory. The Soviet missiles would be deployed in Asia.

After being informed of the board's decision, the Dancin' Irish immediately appealed to Joyce. In response to the ap­peal, University President Fa­ther Theodore Hesburgh ap­pointed the eight-member committee, chaired by Rocca and Director of Residence Life Ann Firth, to reconsider the decision to disband the group. 

Dancin' Irish members said the faculty board's decision surprised them. "I'm quite shocked," said Dancin' Irish co-captain Patricia Perez. 
"I don't think the decision was extremely thought out. I think it was something that came up and was discussed .. . without looking at who we are or what we do as a squad," Perez said. 
Novak said the Dancin' Irish should be allowed to continue to perform because of a high level of student support. More than 100 students signed up to try out for the group at last fall's activities night, she said. 
The Dancin' Irish are advised by Roger Valdiserri, associate director of athletics and sports information, and operate as a club under the di­rection of the Office of Student Activities.

WASHINGTON -Nancy Reagan, victorious in her campaign to drive Donald Regan from the White House, suddenly is being pictured as everything from "a dragon" to a "power-hungry first lady" who has made her hus­band appear wimpish and helpless. 
But Mrs. Reagan's sup­porters say it's nonsense to assert -as one published report did this week -that the first lady has become so pow­erful she plans to use the remainder of President Reagan's term to press for an arms control agreement with the Soviet Union. 
"That's silly," Mrs. Reagan's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, said Tuesday. "Sure, she's interested in arms control, she's interested in peace. But she's interested in arms control only to the point that it affects his (Reagan's) planning and his policy and what he's doing with it." 
Mrs. Reagan's former press secretary, Sheila Tate, agreed. 
"She gets involved with people, yes. Policy, no," said Mrs. Tate, a long-time aide now working in public rela­tions. 
Few people question that Mrs. Reagan has great influ­ence over her husband or that she acts out of an intense con­cern about his health and his image. 
She has often commented that ''all my little antennas go up" when she believes some­one is attempting to take ad­vantage of her husband and that she tries to stop it "by telling him or telling someone else." 
And she has not been reticent in recent weeks while the president, out of sight recuperating from prostate surgery, has been battered by the Iran-Contra controversy. 
Many who know the couple might argue over how per­vasive Mrs. Reagan's influ­ence is. But rare is the White House official or adviser who is willing to have any com­ments about her attached to his or her name. 
Commenting only on condi­tion they not be named, sources had said for weeks she was leading a movement to dump Regan. 
"She's making it hap­pen,"said one Republican source prior to the chief of staff's departure last week. "Itlooks pretty obvious, she's going to get rid of him, one way or another," said a senior White House official. 
Former Sen. Howard Baker, Reagan's new chief of staff, showed during his first meeting with the White House press corps on Monday just how delicate the subject is, though he treated it with humor. 
Queried about a comment he had made previously of Mrs. Reagan that "when she gets her hackles up, she can be a dragon," the Tennessee politican replied by praising her as "a distinguished citi­zen" and "a great lady."

Yong-chang said 20 people were put under house arrest. But Dong-A Ilbo, the nation's biggest independent national daily newspaper, and Yonhap News Agency said at least 72 people, including top dissident leaders Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, were confined to their homes.

Despite the violence, police were largely in control of Tues­day's street actions, through which critics of the govern­ment sought to point up their demands involving greater democracy and human rights in South Korea.

"One Hundred Ways" 
More minorities would enhance Saint Mary's 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to the article that covered Dr. Pilgrims' speech, given on Tuesday, Feb. 24 at Saint Mary's. I have had the pleasure to hear Pilgrim speak on two previous occa­sions, and I strongly support the issue of integrating Saint Mary's. 
As I walked home from his lecture, I tried to understand what his words made me feel. I felt great sadness. But even more than sadness, I felt resentment--resentment toward a place that has been my "home away from home" for the past three years and that has denied me a valuable learning experience because of the lack of minorities. The world does not look like a Saint Mary's classroom; in fact, it is far from it. 
I have a few Black and Hispanic friends, and I wouldn't trade them for the world. Not only are they close friends, but through knowing them, I have learned things that I could never have learned from a textbook. Every student should have this opportunity to interact with minority students. How can you expect to go out into the real world and successfully deal with other people when the only people you've dealt with for the past four years have been middle to upper class whites? 
Something must be done. Pilgrim is only one man--he cannot bring about a change by himself. Saint Mary's ad­ministration has recently formed a committee called "Ad Hoc on Student Diversity" to try and deal with this minority problem. I think they believe 
that by forming this committee, they 
have done their part in solving the 
problem--wrong. Much more needs to 
be done! 
I am one of the five or so member on 
the committee. We need more support 
from both Notre Dame and Saint 
Mary's students because this problem 
extends onto both campuses. I urge all 
students who are interested to come to 
our meeting. We meet at every Wed­
nesday at 6 p.m. in the Regina lounge. 
Remember, strength lies in the num­
bers. The more students we have, the 
stronger we will become. Do your part 
to make Saint Mary's and Notre Dame 
a much more colorful community--a 
community we can all be proud of.

Junior parents extend thanks for weekend 
Dear Editor: 
A great big "Thank You" to Laurine Bink, Catherine Nonnenkamp and the legions of Notre Dame students, as well as administrative, faculty and service workers for the delightful "belated Valentine" delivered to juniors' par­ents. 
We junior parents were "petted and praised" in such lavish fashion, while wisked about from one beautifully planned and executed event to another, that we returned home in a daze with nothing but fond thoughts of Notre Dame and the wonderful, exceptionally brilliant child we had had the foresight to send to that "good place." 
The care, planning and expressed love evidenced by the tremendous ef­organizing the emotionally moving mass, the beautifully creative recep­tion dance, the elegant dinner, con­vivial dorm receptions and festive brunch, speaks volumes about the values held at Notre Dame. 

From the first "Welcome to Notre Dame" spoken by our son as we arrived Friday evening, to the wonderful Flan­ner Hall reception, to Sunday's fond farewells to newfound friends -stu­dents, parents, and faculty -the weekend took on the luminescence of a gemlike memory. 
What mother will forget to the image of a dance floor filled entirely with mother-son couples? Fathers, as well as mothers, basked in the warmth of Father Hesburgh's remarks on Notre Dame as " ... Shrine of Our Lady ... Her special place.. of peace and growth where children learn to cherish par­ents ... " 
We parents can appreciate trustee Andy McKenna's after-dinner remarks emphasizing "pride and privilege" in being part of the Notre Dame family. To know we have sent our sons and daughterss to continue their education in a place which supports and en­courages Christian family values is, as a parent, to experience some measure of peace, and with it a sense of pride and privilege. 
Our "Thanks" to all those who worked so very hard to make Junior Parents Weekend a heartwarming Valentine which will be treasured al­ways.

As the academic year draws ever nearer to an end, I find it appropriate that the accolades for retiring Father Hesburgh begin in earnest. He has with­out question taken a university known for its prowess on the football field and has established it as one of the leading academic institutions in the country. Though I have disagreed with many of his political positions and found his repeated absences from campus some­what disconcerting, the results of Fa­ther Hesburgh's work over the years speak for themselves. I look forward to the continued advancement of the Uni­versity by the new administration of Fathers Malloy and Beauchamp.

A key element of such success would undoubtedly be an improvement in the social life of the student body, someth­ing which I personally saw deteriorate from 1981-1985. A huge step backward in this regard was the enactment of new alcohol-consumption guidelines in 1984. Of course, the new rules were not meant to harm social life--they were designed principally to ameliorate concerns over potential University liability for alcohol-related accidents--but only the sadly idealistic and simply dumb thought back then that the effects on the social environment would be anyth­ing other than seriously detrimental. 
And it appears the new policy did in fact spur such a decline in social life. Starting from the realistic, and thus necessary, premise that for most stu­dents social life an alcohol are inex­tricably intertwined (particularly at an Irish Catholic university), one can only expect that a major shift in alcohol policy will cause noticeable changes in student behavior. At Notre Dame, the dramatic cutback in on-campus drink­ing opportunities in social settings naturally led to increased drinking in bars and at parties off-campus. 
Strong-arm tactics of the hateful local authorities alone with general inconvenience--both necessarily en­dured when choosing the off-campus option--have ultimately resulted in lessened interaction between the sexes, something which is central to one's overall development as a total person during his or her college years. Thus, while the University effectively accom­plished its objective of largely preempt­ing future legal troubles, the student body has in turn suffered in the form of stunted social growth. 

The LaFortune Student Center renovations are certainly to be ap­plauded, but undue focus on them will only draw attention away from the real, major problem facing Notre Dame and its administratiors today: how is social life on campus to be enhance, if not completely revised, within the present dorm structure? 
No easy answers to this question present themselves. However, the dif­ficulty of the task should not pose a deterrent to thoughtful action. The new administration, once in place, should form a committee comprised of Uni­versity officials, faculty members, and 
------~---------­
----, 
student leaders. This committee should investigate means of working within the system (principally the alcohol policy) to achieve better social condi­tions, both by reviewing the different approaches to this general problem at other colleges and universities and by truly listening to student proposals (unlike past committees bent on secur­
ing one end). Should the committee de­""\ 
termine the system itself needs fine­
tuning, such modificaitons must be 
recommended and carried out. 
Of course, there are ways to ac­complish needed change other than by committee, but ultimately something must be done soon to improve Notre Dame's social environment before complacency and yes, ever-growing apathy, extinguish the once-high flames of discontent. 
Effect change soon, or the observa­tion that Notre Dame students are so­cially retarded will become a more common refrain across this country.

Conscience must be formed using moral precepts 
Editor's Note: The following is the first in a two-part series. 
In recent days since the Second Vatican, the notion of the Catholic Church in crisis has become ever more prevalent. Much confusion and distur­bance has arisen from the current denial of certain Christian dogmas and from dissent with regard to the divine institution and teaching authority of the Church. What has evolved (and stands in perfect conformity with modern process theology which rejects the traditional transcendency of God and salvific message of Christ) is a sub­
r­
stitution of a subjective situation ethics in place of an objective sense of morality, and in general, an overturn­ing of the relationship between secular 
r 
and religious values.

guest column

Recently, I had the unpleasant expe­
rience of sitting through a presentation by one of our professors of theology who, while speaking in the name of the Catholic Church, proceeded among other things to significantly contradict the real teaching of the Church. I refer to Regina Coli, whose topic for discus­sion was that of Church: what is it?... where is it today? ...where has it come from and where is it heading? ...and how would we like to see the Church in the future? As a proponent of secular, and apparently process, theology, Coli's lecture was an injustice to the many people who had come to learn more about the Catholic Church. 
The following representative quotes taken from her lecture capsulize to a large extent what Coli had to say: "As responsible Christians we should criti­cally question everything ...only those things contained in the Creed cannot be changed...customs, traditions, rules can all be changed, including synods and encyclicals which have all been changed in the past. ..we can't always use answers that worked in the past to deal with the situation today; we don't do it in physics ... we must change the face of the earth and the face of the Church...the role of the laity is not to respond to some structure above you...that old notion of sheep...as long as you faithfully follow your con­science you are being moral. Con­science grows out of experience...over a whole lifetime that we have a general sense of rightness or wrongness. If you're against something because the Church is, then you don't have an in­formed conscience; you do not know what you are talking about. ..we no longer think of sin this way anymore, in terms of venial and mortal. We are not saved by anything we do but only by Christ. If we are fundamentally ori­ented toward good, then we'll be saved...theology today grows out of the experience of the people. The the­ology we have is white, European and middle class...there are many theologies-not just one; look, we have four gospels that tell us different things about Christ." 
Though Coil's words have numerous anti-Catholic implications, what stands out most forcefully (and was indis­putably clear from the whole of her talk) is her rejection of the authority of the magisterium and her uneducated characterization conscience (by which she defends a consequentialist basis for reasoned moral decision making). Now the relationship between authority and conscience is of central importance to the Catholic, and its understanding is inseparable from the relationship be­tween conscience and truth. The mind of man is such that when it recognizes truth, it naturally adheres to it, and acknowledging its authority, accepts it. There is an epidemic attitude today which says that the mature man trusts only what he can verify for himself, and that to be guided by the authority of another marks one as immature and insecure. This of course is not neces­sarily true, and a real sign of im­maturity lies in the inability to distin­guish what sources of authority can be trusted and which cannot. A mature personality will accept the advice and word of another to the extent that the other is trustworthy, even in matters beyond his own ability to verify. The teaching authority of the Church with regard to faith and morals is trustworthy because it is divinely guaranteed. Those who would not agree with this divine guarantee will not regard the authority as trustworthy, but this is at the heart of the issue. As true Catholics we firmly believe that the Church is what it is precisely be­cause it is guided by the Holy Spirit, and through its divine institution the Church is first of all the mystical body of Christ. Anyone who, like Regina Coli, attempts to adequately describe the Church without any reference at all to the Holy Spirit and the notion of mysti­cal body has utterly confounded the issue. 
The suggestion that there is no real freedom in the Catholic Church because Catholics are forced to submit ("that old notion of sheep") to rules externally imposed is absurd. No one is forced to believe or to do anything in the Catholic Church; rather the system is a volun­tary one, and faith is a gift which we can freely choose to accept or to reject. Every man or woman is free to consent to what he or she regards as credible; hopefully all Catholics have experi­enced that freedom and have freely chosen to believe the teaching of the Church because they have considered the evidence and concluded that its teaching is divinely guided and thereby guaranteed to be true. We should ap­proach the Church not with reluctance but with gratitude. Far from restricting mankind's feedom, She facilitates it and aids us in the choice of personal conscience. It is in this sense that the Church is truly 'servant', by informing conscience, not forcing it, by providing vital information so as to remove doubt and uncertainty. 
But what about the situation of the Catholic whose conscience tells her one thing while the Church teaching calls her to another? Does this mean she is required to surrender her personal commitments and freedom, and to live with insincerity? Real conflicts like this happen less often than we might be led to believe, and most often the conflict derives from the individual's lack of true self-awareness, from a failure to grasp what it really means to be a Cath­olic, and a superficial grasp of freedom. If it actually is the case that the whole of one's conscience stands in solid op­position to the Church concerning a serious issue, then, in choosing to follow his personal convictions, he has funda-

mentally altered his position as a Cath­olic. The inescapable result for such a person is the rendering untenable the teaching of the Catholic Church, vir­tually stripping it of its basic meaning, and through resolving this problem of conscience, the person has rejected the Church. The conclusion adhered to is that the teaching of the Church on the issue in question is not really upheld by Christ, hence the Catholic concept of Church is rejected, namely that it is the guaranteed teaching body, a magis­terium guided by God. Such a person rejects the meaning of Church, and though he may frequent the Sacra­ments and be involved with his parish, his heart has left his religion. If Christ is not present in the living teaching voice of the Church, there remains no guarantee of his presence in the Sacra­ments or even the Eucharist for that matter. And when a man contends that Christ does not uphold the Church's teaching on birth control, there is no reason to believe in the Church's teach­ing about abortion or divorce or premarital sex. Such a man abides by no true Christian criterion, but operates purely upon human opinion. 
With the growth of secular theology comes the demand that the Church be restructured according to the human principles of Rousseauian democracy. As supernatural revelation is denied, and Rousseauian liberalism rejects the eternal and natural law, what remains is the general will of the people formed by consensus as the new magisterial basis. If truth is really relative to the imminent evolving will of the people, there ceases to be any foundation for authority at all of any kind. Authority and obedience are artificial when truth is denied, and law and conformity are but pedagogues of slavery. One clear manifestation of the inroads made by process theology today is the growing acceptance of situation ethics. The "evolving all" ("change is one of the marvels...") replaces the notions of eternal and natural law, such that there can be no rightness or wrongness in keeping with the intrinsic natures of things ("as long as you faithfully follow your conscience ... We no longer think of sin in this way..."). Rather, the morally relevant choice is determined by the pragmatic results ("all the con­sequences.") obtainable from a given situation. Situation ethic's excessive regard for the desired effect is exclu­sive of the notion of intrinsic good in actions to be performed, and this is di­rectly opposed to a traditional objective ethics based on norms available to rea­son. Only an objective ethics belongs to a God-centered universe with intel­ligible order, like that of Christian tradition. The other ethic belongs to the man-centered tradition growing out of agnosticism and culminating in the sub­jectivity of Hegel. When Pope Paul defended the tradiitonal teachings of the Church concerning artificial birth control, he was defending the first tradition. It was the second tradition which was defended by those who have rejected Humanae Vitae. 
Perhaps one is entitled to adopt a po­sition contrary to that of the Church on the grounds of conscience; however, having made such a choice, one is not entitled to insist upon regarding one's new position as Catholic. Anyone who claims the right to be called Catholic while remaining totally subjective with respect to what it means to be Catholic completely fails to understand that being Catholic means to belong to a Body which, where fundamental prin­ciples are concerned, thinks and teaches with the mind of Christ. 
Where a sense of conflict between conscience and Church exists, what most likely obtains is a self-induced pseudo-collision, primarily resulting from superficial thinking, and a lack of self-awareness, of an understanding of one's proper values. The formation of conscience which Coli describes does not prescind from the lack of objective truth which is responsible for value dis­crepancy. Conscience, properly under­stood, is an inborn disposition of the mind to consider the general truths of moral conduct which become the prin­ciples of reasoning in the realm of moral decision making. Strictly speak­ing, conscience is the act of the practi­cal intellect deciding whether a partic­ular, propsed operation is good or bad, here and now. It is a conclusion reached by reason after having applied moral principles to a specific course of action. We cannot attempt to re!Juce con­science to an emotionally governed state, without stripping it of all author­ity. Conscience is not a matter of one's personal moral preference (as moral relativists claim). What does this mean for those who claim to act according to their best conscience yet violate a nat­ural law precept?

On with the Dance! 
GINA CAMARENA features writer 

D
edication and hard work-· that is what I felt being emitted from the dancers on stage as I slipped into the auditorium during dance rehearsal on a late Friday eve­ning. Why would anyone want to spend five to six hours sweating and laboring over dance routines while most other students are out having fun? The answer is quite simple for the dancers--"lt's something we believe in," ex­plained Saint Mary's junior Clare VanHecke. 
They are rehearsing for one of the major dance productions that comprises "To Dance!" which is being presented by the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Theater. The production "is a portfolio of works (with the) culmination of hard work," said Saint Mary's dance professor lndi Dleckgrafe. Notre Dame and Saint Mary's dancers will present a dazzling array of original works focusing on dance from the mid-20th cen­tury. "To Dance!" will run Wed­nesday through Saturday, March 4-7 at 8 p.m. and Sun­day, March 8 at .3 p.m. In O'Laughlin Auditorium at Saint Mary's College. 
Since last September the dancers have been preparing for this "eclectic evening" to demonstrate that dance is not simply a recreational activity. but instead a form of art. A total of ten pieces comprise the event including solos, duets and group performances. Dieckgrafe will perform two solos: in "Light in the Wilder­ness" Dieckgrafe pays homage to the Sisters of the Holy Cross during the Civil War period, and In "BackSpace" she focuses on the special element of the space behind the dan­cer. 
In addition, featured guest artist Gerald Otte will present his solo "Posterboard" and will also perform a duet with Dieck­grafe called "Acts Two." Otte Is a choreographer and the artis­tic director of the Otte Com­pany In New York City. With over 20 years of experience in 
5.3 countries Otte said he "choreographs out of need--the need to dance." 
Other performances include "Manners," a three-selection piece based on the etiquette which is performed by eight dancers to music by Benny Goodman; "Le Musee and Les Goyles" is a neo-classical duet with dancers Andrew Fena and Susan Koper; Notre Dame graduate student Laura Greeman will perform "Compromises;" "Strydes" con­tains abstract ideas and space­like costumes; and "On Wo­men" is a 20-mlnute work performed by I 2 female dan­cers. 
What makes this production a special event is that the dan­cers dedicate themselves to much time and effort without receiving sufficient credit. The problem is as simple as It is frustrating--there is no dance minor at Saint Mary's and fur­thermore no dance program at Notre Dame. "(Dance) doesn't fulfll any physical education or fine art requirements," ex­plained Otte. 
Dieckgrafe has been the only dance instructor until this se­mester when JoAnn Barkes was hired part-time to teach ballet. "We are so lucky to have a bal· let teacher now," said Dieck­grafe. Currently, four dance classes are offered at Saint Mary's: ballet. intermediate and advanced modern dancing and repertory performance. 
The limited number of classes is a result of the lim­ited amount of recognition given to a dance department. When Dieckgrafe began teach­ing at Saint Mary's she "had high expectations of establish­ing a dance department" primarily to make available a dance minor for students. Not having the support of the ad­ministration, Dleckgrafe said, "I have just been doing my work as a professor as best as I can with the level of my dancers." 
The only way in which a stu­dent can receive a dance minor is through self-design. For those who choose this option Dleckgrafe would be the ad­visor who would regulate the student's responsibilities and achievements. Dleckgrafe ex­plained that a self-design minor would require a total of 20 hours: eight hours for tech­nlque "to make sure the dancer reaches the advance level of proficiency" and I 2 hours of academics including method and material of dance, 20th century dance history, aes­thetics and a choreographed dance composition. 
Although this is one method to receive a dance minor it is still far from the conventional path toward a degree. Many of the dancers who spend count­less hours working on routines feel that the system is an un­justlce. Greeman said "the frustration" is that the one credit "doesn't fulfill anything-· Notre Dame really doesn't ac­knowledge the Importance of dance." For Greeman, dance is a way "to keep you sane and healthy." 
Kristen Tweedell, a Notre 
Dame student majoring In 
theater said "It would be great 
If Notre Dame got Involved." 
Similarly, Notre Dame student 
Andrea Reilly said that "Notre 
Dame should have its own 
dance studio." For Notre Dame 
students It Is clearly an "extra 
effort" to dance as they spend 
approximately one hour just 
commuting between the two 
campuses during rehearsals 
and class days. 
Dancing at Saint Mary's Is not 
only restricted to those with 
dance experience. The level of 
dancers ranges from no previ­
ous experience such as Saint 
Mary's junior Krls Lasher who 
"haphazardly became in­
volved," to dancers such as 
MaryCaren Ferrini who has 
eight years experience and Is 
working towards a self-design 
dance minor. 
With or without the establish­
ment of a dance minor the 
dancers will continue to dance 
and to commit themselves be­
cause "dance does mean 
something," said VanHecke·· 
especially to those who care. 
Otte said that the situation of 
dance education at the college

People watching in Paris 
S 
o you are a "people watcher." You like to stare at people on buses and try to perceive bits of their personalities. You spend half the time In class gazing around the room guessing who has a date for this weekend's SYR and who doesn't. Arriving at the dining hall around 5 pm., you have no qualms about hanging out until you are thrown out. After all, the dining hallS are a "people-watcher's heaven", as is a museum. 
In most museums, the art works are displayed on the

four perimeters of a room. Quite convlentiy, the architect also usually details that comfortable chairs with panoramic views be placed at the center of such a room. Most often, these lounges are the haven for weary feet or they are the perch of a true art lover absorbing the feast around him. As for me, however, my true love of people-watching is satiated here. 
As I write this column, I am located in front of a work by Gustave Caillebotte in one of the new Musee d'Orsay's rooms dedicated to impressioniam after I 870. This train station turned museum is the talk of Paris, and all of France. Recently renovated and opened to the public last December, the museum holds a vast collection of impres­sionist works and other treasures of the 19th century. Thus, it draws a large and varied crowd. 
At 2:40 pm on this dreary Saturday afternoon, there are quite a good number of people milling around. At last count there were approximtely thirty-five people of varied ages and descriptions in this room. 
A group of young Japanese girls just walked In and definitely merit a good glance.. The first to draw my attention is in a color scheme of cream and black and wearing a dashing hat to top off the look. Her eyes are wide as she looks around the room, a small smile perking out as her hand nervously reaches for the camera around her neck. Three of her companions follow her into the salon and it is the girl trailing behind who makes me smile. 
Noticing her Louis XIV style shoes with the silver buckles first, my eyes travel up her black and white ensemble to her shy face. Then, I see the ears. No, not her real ears but the two small buns she has swept her hair up Into on either side of her head, just above her ears. I really hate to think It but she looks like Mickey Mouse, or Minnie Mouse as the case may be. The girls glance around and move onto the works of Degas next door. 
On either side of Cailiebotte's large depletion of shirtless men working on a large, wooden floor in a dimly lit room, there is a door-like opening which serves as both exit and entry. It's great. I can watch someone walk Into the room, take one glance around and watch them decide if they are going to stay or spend their time elsewhere. Most people stop in front of me and look at this dark painting for awhile. It is large, the sole piece on this wall. They read the artist's name and the title at the lower left of the work, say something to each other, shrug, and go on. 
Another classic just walked ln. An older man, problably around 55 or 60, just passed in front with his "Betamovie" camera poised and ready for action. He fllmed a bit of Monet and now just did the trek to the painting I am facing. He is tall with gray, almost white, hair and has the relaxed air of one who is retired on a person truly enjoying his vacation. 
A red-headed (is it real?) woman to my left Is wearing a pair of pearl and gold earrings which I think are beautiful but which I don't think my neck is strong enough to support (three inches wide and reaching her shoulders). Another fashion note on the very thin woman in chunk­heeled boots and bright puple velour at the Pissaro piece. OK, the boots and a beret which is purple I can handle but velour? That was the how swatch when I was In flth grade! One find all kinds here In Paris. There are Burberry scarves, oxfords, pearls and headbands coming out of the woodwork. In the same way, all-black ensembles are just as popular. Put yourself together from head-to-toe perhaps with a dash of color, and you will definitely look European. 
A very amusing aspect of sitting here people-watching Is that I in turn am watched by them. With notebook and pen in hand scribbling away, just what am I doing? Curlouslty gets the best of people and as they walk by; they glance at the book and then my face. I look back and they look 
away but are unable to resist one more look. though. They take in all of me from my red hair and red pants to my ten-button purple shirt from the Gap and black boots. I smile and keep writing and they walk on, embarassed maybe.

game," said Martin. "We must be much more patient on of­fense. It might take more than two passes before we put up a shot tonight." 
Martin also feels his club will have to play both halves with the intensity with which it played the first half last night. 
"We'll have to limit their strong inside game," noted Martin. "They can shoot those outside jumpers from 20 feet, but we cannot give away any lay ups." 
So tonight Sorin will attempt to defend the title it earned a year ago while Stanford at­tempts to regain the form that enabled it to win nine consecu­tive games before last night. If the game is played at all like last night's battle, the fans on hand will be treated to quite a show.

Associated Press 
COLUMBIA, S.C. -South Carolina's basketball program was placed on two year's probation Tuesday for NCAA rules violations, the most serious being a "well­organized and well-executed scheme" in which players sold 
complimentary  tickets  to  
boosters.  
South  Carolina also  was  

banned from postseason action by the NCAA because of rule violations under former Coach Bill Foster from 1982 to 1985. 
Foster, who resigned after the 1985-86 season and was replaced by George Felton, is now coach at Northwestern. Foster didn't return telephone calls made to his office, but during the weekly Big Ten teleconference call, he said: "I've not heard anything. I can­not comment. I am on the road recruiting."

wouldn't appeal the NCAA's decision. 
At the end of the first year of probation, the school can ask the NCAA to rescind the second year's penalty, something Hol­derman said the university plans to do. 
"None of us like to get a report card which gives us some .. . suggestion of things we've done wrong," Holder­man said at a news conference at which the report was released. 
"But I think in all fairness, the report deals with us with equity and deals with a prob­lem with a great deal of fair­ness. That's why I've indicated we have no ... desire to appeal the matter. We'd like to put it behind us." 
Other violations outlined in the 8-page report from the NCAA Committee on Infrac­tions included: 
-the loan and lease of automobiles to several possible recruits and players.

lodging being provided for pos­sible recruits and players. 
But the committee said the "most distressing and serious" violation was the scheme set up and run by members of the coaching staff in which players sold their complimentary tick­ets at face value to boosters. A basketball ticket costs seven dollars. 
The players didn't "have contact with the ticket pur­chasers and received remuneration for their tickets directly from a member of the men's basketball coaching staff," the report said. 
"Ticket purchasers neither negotiated nor passed money directly to the student-athletes, but rather arrangements for the sale of the tickets were han­dled by members of the coach­ing staff," the report said. 
The report didn't identify the coaches, players or boosters who took part in the scheme, and the univertsity declined to release the names during the news conference. 
Irish join 'Big Four' schedule 
Associated Press 
LEXINGTON, Ky. -The "Big-Four" basketball double­header involving Kentucky, Louisville, Indiana and Notre Dame is set for early Decem­ber next season, UK Athletic Director Cliff Hagan said. 
Kentucky will "most likely" 
play Indiana in one game of the 
inaugural doubleheader, 
Hagan said, with Louisville 
playing Notre Dame in the 
other. The participants will al­
ternate opponents in the follow­
ing two seasons. 
The Hoosier Dome in In­
dianapolis will be a permanent 
home to the doubleheader, 
Hagan said. 
In the years Kentucky plays 
either Louisville or Indiana in 
the "Big Four" event, the 
Wildcats would not play those 
teams in a regular-season 
game, Hagan said. But Ken­
tucky would play Indiana and 
Louisville in other seasons. 
A specific date in December 
1987 for the first doubleheader 
has not been set. 
Marquette to investigate fan incidents 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE -Marquette University officials say they will investigate a beer­throwing incident at last Satur­day's game with Notre Dame that led to a heated verbal ex­change between Irish coach Digger Phelps and Warrior coach Bob Dukiet. 
Marquette University is against having beer at home games, according to Raymonds. He said the deci­sion to allow beer in the arena was made by officials at the MECCA. Beer is not sold at Notre Dame's ACC or any arena in the Big Ten. 
Marquette Athletic Director 
Hank Raymonds said Phelps' 
reaction was triggered by emo· 
tion.

tanislao that she was quitting to her consistent scoring and 
the team for personal reasons. Strike one. 
Later, junior forward Kathy Brommeland decided it was in her best interest to quit the team as well. Strike two. 
Finally, Julie Garske, a freshman who had been averaging 6.2 points per game, decided to transfer to her home state and play for Wisconsin and former Irish assistant coach, Mary Murphy. Strike three. 
But surprisingly, Notre Dame is not out. Even though the schedule overwhelmed the rapidly-smaller bunch early in the season, and Beth Mor­rison's injury added to their woes, the Irish refused to end the season as a doormat. 
There are plenty of reasons why. 
A major force has been the outstanding play of Heidi Bunek. The sophomore from Milwaukee, plagued by injur­ies during her freshman cam­paign, has been a force in the lane all season. 
Point guard Mary Gavin has performed the playmaking rebounding numbers of a year ago, and Diondra Toney has hit for double figures in the last five contests. 
But perhaps the biggest rea­son for Notre Dame's rise from the win-loss percentage graveyard has been the emer­gence of Annie Schwartz as an outside scoring threat. The freshman from Ann Arbor, Mich., has stepped into the starting lineup and opened up the inside for Bunek and Bot­ham to maneuver. 
These ingredients have been mixed together to produce five straight wins and have made the future -there are no seniors on the squad -look much brighter. 
Their current record is still only 11-15, they have no NCAA bid awaiting them next Sun­day, and DiStanislao most likely will not receive consid­eration for any post-season honors. But this team has come a long way, and DiStanislao has probably done as much, if not more, coaching than in either of her previous award-winning seasons. 
By Orlando Rubiano Sports Writer 
The Crime began its assault on the Manor last night at the ACC, and were unrelenting throughout in posting a 7-1 win in Interhall hockey playoff ac­tion. 
Off-Campus will play defend­ing champion Grace, who held off Pangborn in the second game, 4-2, in the finals Thursday night for the Inter­hall hockey crown. 
In the evening's first game, Off-Campus grabbed a 3-0 lead in the first-half and was never seriously threatened after­wards. Morrissey captain, Ted Gradel, acknowledged that his club was beaten by the superior team. 
"They kept us off balance primarily due to their good puck movement, and their defense was able to keep our guys out of their zone," said Gradel. 
In the first half, Kurt Peter­son started the Crime's goal spree. He stole the puck from a Morrissey defender and found an opening in the far side of the goal for a 1-0 Crime lead. The second goal was a work of art, as Mike Breslin took the puck coast-to-coast and in the process left the Manorites mys­tified as he skated by them one by one. Bobby Newman closed out the first-period scoring as he slid the puck past a fallen defender and goalie just in front of goal. 

The second half was much like the first, as Morrissey was under constant pressure. Its lone bright spot came from Chuck Curley, who fired a blis­tering shot from outside the blue line that caught 0-C's Phil Coghlan napping. Off Campus captain Mike Breslin, however, was pleased with goalie's per­formance. 
"Phil played well in the nets tonight, and he made tough saves when needed," replied Breslin. 
Mter Curley's goal, the Crime put the nails to the Manor coffin. Lance Williams got 0-C's fourth goal after re­ceiving the puck in front of goal, where he faked the goalie right and easily scored to the left side. Rich Kennedy got number five after beating two defenders to a loose puck at the blue line and backhanded the puck past the goaltender. Hugh Hart made the score 6-1 by taking a rebound shot from in front of goal and putting it in. 
In the late game, Grace jumped to a 3-0 lead early in the first half, but Pangborn came back with two quick goals to make the score 3-2 at the half. 
Grace advances to the finals with a 6-1 record, while Pangborn finishes their season at 4-1-2.

Sorin keeps IH title hopes alive with 50-45 victory over Stanford 

By CHRIS PAULISON Sports Writer 
Sorin Hall defeated Stanford Hall last night in the Men's A League Interhall basketball championship, 50-45, forcing a second and final game tonight. 
Defending champion Sorin overcame a 10-point halftime deficit and hot outside shooting by Stanford point guard Dan Niedermeyer in gaining the victory. Swingman Steve Beuerlein led an impressive third quarter surge in which Sorin outscored the Studs by a 13-6 margin. Beurlein, who led all scorers, finished the game with 18 points. 
Mark Trautmann, a senior forward for the Screaming Ot­ters, chipped in with 10 points. 
"Mter keeping our inside game quiet in the first half, (Stanford) seemed to suffer some fatigue," said Traut­mann. "In the second half we were able to set some back­picks, and get some easy lay ups." 
The Sorin rally came just in time, in fact, as the defending champs found themselves down by four to Stanford with just over two minutes left on the clock. But after the Studs were slapped with a technical foul, the momentum began to shift the Otters' way. Shortly thereafter, Sorin finally seized control of the game when point guard Sean Cullinan sank a pair of clutch free throws with 17 seconds left, giving his team a three-point lead. 

Alvarez, Strong join Holtz' football staff 
Special to The Observer 
Barry Alvarez, former Iowa linebacker coach, and Jim Strong, former running back coach at Minnesota, have been named to positions recently vacated on the Irish football staff. 
Alvarez replaces former out­side linebacker coach Kurt Schottenheimer who left to be­come the special teams coach of the Cleveland Browns, where his brother Marty is the head coach. Alvarez joined the Hawkeye staff in 1979 under the tutelage of Hayden Fry. While at Iowa, Alvarez coached such standouts as Larry Station, the Hawkeyes' all-time leading tackler. 
The 40-year-old Alvarez

-graduated from Nebraska in 1969, where he was an all-Big Eight linebacker in his senior year. Strong will replace Mike Stock as the Irish running back coach. Stock left to join the staff of the Cincinnati Bengals where he will coach the special teams. Stock had been on the 
Notre Dame coaching staff for four years. 
Strong joined the Gophers' staff in 1984 with Lou Holtz after being named to Holtz' Arkansas staff in 1983. Strong played wide receiver at Tulsa for three years. 
"As a head coach, you never have trouble justifying who you hire as assistants," said Holtz of the new additions. "But you do have trouble justifying who you don't hire. In that regard, I think that both Barry and Jim are outstanding people. Barry has an outstanding reputation in the Big Ten, and I've coached with Jim personally both at Arkansas and Min­nesota. They'll both add a lot to our program because they belong at a place like Notre Dame." 
Holtz talked to George Kelly, a former Irish assistant for 18 years and current special as­sistant to Notre Dame Athletic Director Gene Corrigan, about resuming on-field duties. But after consulting with Corrigan, Kelly decided to continue on in his present position.

Sorin sixth man Dan Reynolds iced the game seconds later with two more points from the charity stripe. 
For Stanford, the loss was its first setback of the season. 
Sarin's win last night did not clinch the championship be­cause it had already lost once in the double-elimination tournament. Their victory last night, therefore, sets up tonight's tie-breaking show­down for the championship. 
Junior AI Martin, Stanford's captain, realizes his team must attempt to put the defeat be­hind it when it faces Sorin again tonight at 9 p.m. in the ACC Pit.

Despite season of defeats, Irish did whip adversity 
The Irish basketball team is on a pretty good roll these days. And so is that team Digger Phelps coaches. 
The men's team has been knocking down highly-rated 
teams as fast as the schedule can bring them up, and 
considering the rocky start with which this season began, 
Notre Dame's performance can only be described as a 
pleasant surprise.

But that's not what I'm talking about here. 
The Notre Dame women's team had a rough start this 

season, to put it rather mildly. Head coach Mary DiStanis­
lao's team began with four straight defeats and the season 
continued in miserable fashion. Two-and-a-half weeks ago, 
the women found themselves saddled with a 6-15 record. 
The sluggish start was something new for the Irish. Last 
season, they finished third in the women's NIT Tourna­
ment and took the North Star Conference title with a 23-8 
overall record. The season before that, they put together 
a 20-8 record and also took the conference championship. 
Both seasons, DiStanislao was named North Star Confer­
ence Coach of the Year. 
This season, a combination of factors left the team at 
the foot of a huge hill that loomed larger with each passing 
day. One of the expected obstacles was filling the scoring 
duties handled by graduated forward Trena Keys. Keys 
holds the Notre Dame career scoring average record of 
14.3 points, and holds numerous other career marks. DiS­tanislao had sophomore Lisa Kuhns ready to try her hand at filling the outside shooting need. 
Another expected hurdle was the schedule. It figured to 
be quite a task, and it was just that. Seven of the 15 teams 
that have defeated the Irish thus far have been nationally­
ranked teams, including top-ranked Texas, No. 2 Rutgers 
and No. 7 Tennessee. 
That's when the problems DiStanislao didn't expect 
began their assault. 
Kuhns may have been ready to fill the vacant forward 
spot, but one of those hard-to-see-in-the-dark wires on 
campus prevented her from showing it. She was lost for 
the season with damage to knee ligaments. 
Next came a group of surprises, none of which were pleasant. Getting ready to leave for the second game of the season at Texas, the team's lone senior, captain
