THE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER SERVING NOTRE DAME AND SAINT MARY'S 
Maya Angelou 
speaks to 
By DANNIKA SIMPSON 
News Writer 
Actress, poet, and author Maya Angelou shared some of her life experiences and en­couraged men and women of the Notre Dame community to attempt to make a difference in the world in a talk Thursday at Stepan Center. 
She encouraged students to seek an education rather than mere training. 
"Wherever two or three are gathered together with the in­tent of sharing experiences," she said. "it seems to me we are about the business of being educated in truth." 
"Young men and women in this institution of higher educa­tion, make time work for you," said Angelou. "Involve your­selves in the wisdom that has gone on before you so that when you leave this institution of higher education the society will not say of you, so what?... I am society, I am the hungry, I am the displaced, I am the un­derprivileged. So what does your degree mean to me?" 
She added, "The only way you will be able to face that question is (if) you know enough to know (that) you know absolutely nothing and its time to get started." 
Angelou says reading is the 


students 
key to becoming educated. 
"Some of the poetry of early 19th and 20th century will be lost if young men and women don't keep it alive. Go to the li­brary and read Black American literature," she said. 
"It will help you to under­stand that someone has been there before you. Someone has been lonely before you; some­one has been called out of her name before you, someone has been disappointed before you and yet someone has survived. That is supposed to encourage you." 
"Everyone in this place has been paid for whether his or her ancestors are from Ireland, Asia, South America, or Africa," she said. "They have already paid for you and me... it seems to me so clear that our only real charge is to prepare ourselves so that we can do our (part) for someone else who is yet to come. And that you are at this institution of higher education tells me that that is really your purpose." 
Angelou also stressed the im­portance of self love. "I know it is important that each person love his or herself. I never trust a person who tells me he loves me if he doesn't love himself."

Waiting to declare a major may hurt sophomores 
By MONICA YANT 
Associate News Editor 
The undeclared sophomore in the College of Arts and Letters may find that waiting to choose a major spells disaster during registration. 
"Because I'm undecided, I wanted to shop around," said sophomore Mary Schultze. With a DART time scheduled on the first day of registration for sophomores, Schultze thought she'd have few difficulties get­ting some of the introductory­level courses in the areas of government, psychology and American studies that would help her decide on a major. 
What Schultze got was a dif­ferent story. 
She was unable to register for any second-level philosophy or theology courses. She was also closed out of most government classes and the American studies class she wanted. 

Registration i9(): : 
I I :~:o:~:~~d other

Getting a psychology course also fell through for Schultze, who said that "all the classes I wanted were for majors-only." 
Although Schultze was able to register for a full schedule, she admitted that of her five classes, only three were courses she wanted to take, one of those being Core. 
Jennifer Swize had similar difficulties, but a later DART time kept her from registering for a full schedule. Swize said she was interested in the areas of government and history, but unable to DART any classes in those departments. "Of the classes that I had (after regis­tering). I knew none of them would lead me to a major." 

A week later, Swize has a complete schedule, but not after attempting to register for over 25 classes. She was able to pick up a government class from a newly opened section, and also a history course. 
"The classes I have were probably my last choices, but now I'm just glad that I even have them," Swize said. 
The problem of the unde­clared sophomore is not going unnoticed, according to Eileen Kolman, dean of the Freshman Year of Studies. 
"We're particularly concerned that students decide on their colleges," Kolman said of the Freshman Year of Studies. "It pretty much works out, except in the College of Arts and Let­ters." 
Of the nearly 1,800 Fresh­men, almost one-third of those will choose the College of Arts and Letters, she said. 

Two men, 2 boys arrested for campus theft 

By MEGAN JUNIUS 
News Writer 
Two local juveniles were ar­rested for criminal conversion at Grace Hall Wednesday afternoon, according to Chuck Hurley, assistant director of Security. 
A Grace resident spotted the two teenage boys on the ninth floor and questioned their purpose for being in the dorm. 
One of the boys was carrying a pair of shoes, Hurley said. It appeared to the resident that the shoes did not belong to the boys. When the suspects real­ized they had been spotted, they fled down the stairs, Hurley said. 
Some residents then chased the suspects down the stairs and out of the building. One suspect was stopped in the C-2 parking lot; the other was chased to the lawn area outside Pasquerilla East before being stopped. 
After the suspects were stopped by the Grace Hall residents they were taken back to the rector's office at Grace until Security arrived, Hurley said. J'he juveniles were arrested by Security and taken to Park View Juvenile Detention Facility. 
In an unrelated incident,

"I would be reluctant to say to 1,800 freshmen to 'hurry up and declare your major because you may have problems (registering) next year,'" Kolman said. 
Encouraging students to de­clare a major right away goes against the "kind of philosophy that we operate by," she said. During their freshman year, students are advised to "look around, to think about what they enjoy," before choosing a major. 
About 20 percent of students have decided on a major by the end of the first semester, sophomore year, according to Robert Waddick, assistant dean of the College of Arts and Let­ters. 
A lot of sophomores, however, declare a major "just to take a course," he said. "There's a lot of pressure on them

Students send troops Kooi-Aid 

By DAVID KINNEY 
News Writer 
Students at Notre Dame and 

Saint Mary's are currently 
working to help U.S. troops in 
Saudi Arabia through a cam­
pus-wide Kool Aid drive. · 
Erin Lavelle, head of the Stu­

dent Union Board, decided to 
start the drive after reading an 
article in The Observer asking 
students to send Kool Aid to 
U.S. troops. "I said 'let's get a much bigger effort,'"said Lavelle. 
The collection began this 

Monday and will run through 
and Kool Aid will be collected in 
drop boxes in all NO and Saint 
Mary's dorms, at the LaFortune 
information desk, Haggar Hall, 
the Huddle and at Martin's Su­
permarket at the corner of 
Ironwood and State Road 23. 
There are also cards for stu­

dents to sign that will be sent as 
well. 
"The Kool Aid drive is an at­

tempt to get the entire campus 
to help the troops," said 
Lavelle. 
At the end of the drive, all the Kool Aid will be shipped to New York and, eventually, on to the Persian Gulf. Its destination is two groups of soldiers repre­senting each of the branches of the armed forces. The process should take a month, said Lavelle. 
While the destination was randomly chosen, Lavelle said that if anyone knows of specific friends or relatives or former ND students in Saudi Arabia, she is willing to help them, also. 
Lavelle is being helped by Lisa Bostwick, Joe· Wilson and Nicole Farmer. Lavelle said Sugar-Free Kool Aid was cho­sen for a variety of reasons. 
Soldiers drink gallons of wa­ter each day, and "tt:ey want to flavor it somehow," she said. Kool Aid is a pure substitute for water. "I think it has something to do with the absorption rate," said Lavelle. 
Other brands are not as ef­fective, since troops must be able to process the liquid effec­tively in order to avoid dehy­dration, according to Lavelle. 
The effort is extremely low­cost, the drop off boxes and and postage should be low, said

INSIDE COLUMN 



Lennon's words ring true ten years later 
Imagine all the people/Living life in peace./You may say I'm a dreamer/ But I'm not the only one// hope someday you'll join us/And the world will be as one" 
It's hard to believe Robyn Simmon 
that John Lennon 
wrote "Imagine" 18 Asst. Accent Editor 
years ago. It's even 
harder to believe that John was taken away 
from us ten years ago this Saturday. 
If John were alive today, what would he say about the world's present situation? 
Alfhough no one will ever be able to know what might have been, as a fan of John and the Beatles I can say with a reasonable amount of authority that John would be de­lighted with the end of the cold war and its promise of world peace. 
On the other hand, John would be very disturbed by the threat of war in the Per­sian Gulf. 
Whether you think the U.S. should be in the Persian Gulf to crush the power-hungry Saddam Hussein or that we had no business going into Saudi Arabia in the first place, I think everyone with at least an ounce of humanity and sanity does not want a war to erupt in the Middle East. 
It's nice to think that a strategically tar­geted bomb could be dropped on Hussein while he's eating his Cheerios and the men­ace would be gone and everybody could go home, but if we do go to war with Iraq, it is more likely that the confrontation will be long and bloody, and young men and women our age will be fighting and dying. 
The deadline that the U.N. gave Saddam for pulling out of Kuwait is January 15. If Iraq doesn't agree to the U.N.'s terms, there will be war. This all sounds very dis­mal, but through negotiations with the Iraqis we still have a chance to prevent a military conflict and save thousands of lives. 
Or as John said over 20 years ago during the Vietnam War, "Give peace a chance." And it certainly would be a lot better to give peace a chance before anybody died on the battlefield. 
The message of John Lennon and his quest for peace is not a "sixties" thing. You don't have to be a fan of John Lennon or the Beatles to be a fan of peace. And I think that what John wanted for the world is something which we all can share. 
Tomorrow, when John's fans from all over the world commemorate the anniver­sary of his death, I hope that there will be one song that the radio stations will play just as much as John's trademark song, "Imagine." 
That song would be "Happy Xmas War is Over." Not only is the song appropriate for the holiday season, but the lyrics are just as meaningful to us today as they were in 1973: "War is over, if you want it." 
The views expressed in the Inside Column are those of the author and not necessarily those of The Observer.

WORLD 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Thursday he was going to the United States with "several ideas" for reviving the Israeli-Arab peace process, but added the gulf crisis must be resolved first. Shamir also thanked Secretary of State James Baker III for his pledge of American support in case of an Iraqi attack on Israel, but said the Jewish state must fight its own battles. "We wel­come (Baker's) remarks, but we never rely on anyone, even if he is the best friend of Israel," Shamir told re­porters at Ben Gurion International Airport before leav­ing for a nine-day trip to Britain and the United States.

Twenty-five pounds of cocaine was found Thursday by security forces aboard an American Airlines plane at Bogota's airport, police said. Drug smugglers placed the cocaine in a hole they drilled under a seat in aisle 28 of the airplane bound for Miami, an airport police report said. During a routine inspection, police found the drugs, which had fallen from the cabin into the baggage depart­ment, the report said. Police said they were investigating how traffickers managed to board the plane and open up the floor. There were no arrests, the report said. 
Government regulators do not have an effective system to manage the consultants hired to sell real estate inherited from failed savings and loans, the head of the General Accounting Office said today. "One of our key concerns is that the RTC (Resolution Trust Corp.) does not have an effective contractor oversight program," Charles Bowsher, head of the congressional investigative agency, told the House Banking Committee. "Because of the large dollar value of assets to be placed under con­tractor control, we believe it is essential that an effective system be put in place as quickly as possible to assure proper contract management and oversight, and minimize RTC's vulnerability to fraud, waste and mismanagement," 
he said.

Campus bands play for charity 
By COLLEEN GANNON News Writer 
A diverse group of campus bands will perform in Satur­day's Earth Jam II, a benefit concert for the environment. 
A $2 admission fee will be charged at the door of Stepan Center and all proceeds col­lected from admission and t­shirt sales will go to Students for Environmental Action (SEAl. 
Earth Jam II, a follow-up to last year's Earth Day celebra­tion at the Fieldhouse Mall, promises to be more than the average concert. Campus groups, such as Amnesty Inter­national, Right to Life and the Gulf Crisis Action Group, will set up information booths. 
At the booths, the groups will pass out information and have "a chance to get a little bit of exposure and attract different groups of people," said sopho­more David Holsinger, SEA fundraising commissioner. 
An open microphone will be available during the approxi­mate half-hour down time be­tween bands. At this time, peo­ple from the audience can take the stage and show off their talents. 
The money raised will be 
used for SEA's "precycling" pro­gram. According to Holsinger. the program is "geared at peo­ple to cut down their waste," rather than merely recycling the waste they do produce. "Next semester SEA will con­centrate on water and food conservation," he added. 
SEA is trying to make some money and increase awareness of the group, Holsinger said. "We (SEA) can attract different groups with the bands," he said. Earth Jam II will also give that same kind of exposure to the other participating campus groups and bands. 
Many campus bands play mainly at local bars. "This is a chance to give the bands more exposure, because not every­body can see them in the bars," Holsinger said. 
The Generics will open Earth Jam II at 7 p.m. They will per­form progressive party rock, including the Cure, U2 and the Cult. 
"We are participating to do a gig that will raise some money for something other than our­selves," said Generics' drummer Dennis Wolfe. 
XYZ Affair, whose five mem­bers all come from South Bend, will take the stage after the Generics at 9 p.m. Three of the band members have played to­gether for approximately three years. Guitarist Scott Gruszyn­ski described the band's sound as really diverse, including classic rock and some new wave. 
Chisel will follow XYZ Affair at 10:30 p.m. Chisel drummer John Dugan and lead singer/guitarist Ted Leo both belong to SEA. "Loud, yet melodic hard core punk rock" is how Leo describes the music of Chisel. According to Leo, Chisel will participate in the concert, because they believe in the whole environmental cause. 
The concert will end with a performance by the nine-mem­ber Exit 77 at midnight. Exit 77 has a unique sound, including acoustics and back-up singers, said bass guitarist Mike Baumer. 
Baumer said he saw the con­cert "as a chance to do some­thing as a group for the envi­ronmental movement." 
In addition to the bands' do­nation of their time and talent, the Student Union Board do­nated $250 to defray the costs of Earth Jam II. 

Week accents drunk driving awareness 
By ANN MARIE HARTMAN News Writer 
Governor Evan Bayh has proclaimed Dec. 9-15 as Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness Week in the state of Indiana. 
Several activities will take place throughout this week to remind Hoosiers to celebrate responsibly during the holidays. 
During the week. Mothers Against Drunk Driving IMADD) will hold a candlelight vigil in remembrance of all victims of drunk driving crashes. MADD will promote their annual "Tie one on" Red Ribbon campaign in cooperation with the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. The ribbons will be available at all central Indiana license branches. 
"Last year in the month of December alone, 22 Hoosiers died and 658 were injured in alcohol-related traffic crashes," Bayh said. "We hope to see a significant decrease in the numbers this year because of our increased efforts. This year we are again increasing patrols. We are sending the message to 'Make it home for the holidays.'" 
Television public service an­nouncements, posters and over­time law enforcement officers will all be a part of the cam­paign to begin immediately and continue through January 7, 1991. Corporate participation will be solicited through a di­rect mail campaign promoting third party intervention. 
"Sobriety and moderation are what we want to stress this holiday season," said Laura O'Neil, Regional Director for a Drug Free Indiana. "People celebrate best when they do it with much rationale. People have learned not to smoke in bed and how not to use electric appliances while around water. It is time that individuals learn that when they drink, they should not drive."

(sophomores) if they want a particular class." 
For the 80 percent of sopho­mores who are still undecided, getting the classes they want can be more difficult, according to Michael Loux, dean of the College of Arts and Letters. He said that those students who have been closed out of courses due to the fact that they are not majors will be accommodated, but that it may take time. 
Loux said that some graduate classes that are presently un­derenrolled will be canceled and reassigned to allow more undergraduate courses to be of­fered. Increasing the size of classes in all departments is another option the College of Arts and Letters is taking. 
"There's no question, that over the next couple of weeks, we will see places open in the College that you wouldn't ex­pect." 
Plans to· increase the faculty in the College of Arts and Let­ters over the next few years should also· help the undeclared sophomore. "As we increase the size of the faculty, we should be better able to cope with diffi­culties," Loux said. 
"Sophomores may be in a better position to do the kind of sampling that I feel is so criti­cal," he said.

Responding to a report that a purse had been stolen from the Non-Varsity Athletics office in the Joyce ACC, officers received from a University employee a description of two suspects sMn in the area shortly before the theft had been discovered. 
The purse, from which some items were missing, was found in men's restroom near Gate 10 of the JACC. 
The description of the sus­pects was broadcast over Secu­rity's radio system and the two suspects, ages 18 and 20, were discovered and arrested near the Lewis Hall bus shelter. 
The suspects were in posses­sion not only of property from the purse, but also of two stolen book bags containing items reported stolen from the South Dining Hall and from the Bookstore.

This type of love will allow a person to ask the question "Am I worth it?" said Angelou. She said this is a question everyone has asked themselves and must continue to ask. 
In addition to being an au­thor, Angelou is also a dancer and a singer. She told the story of how she toured Europe with a group that performed "Porgy and Bess." She was a dancer and was in the chorus and had no formal training as a singer. The group did a concert in North Africa at which Angelou performed a spiritual she had learned in church. She said the local Arabs were very receptive.

Book compares Persian Gulf to Pearl Harbor 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The attack on Pearl Harbor 49 years ago today was linked more closely than commonly believed to Japan's thirst for secure oil supplies, according to a new book that draws haunting parallels to the Persian Gulf crisis. 
In "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power," pub­lished this week, author Daniel Yergin called oil the "linchpin" of Japan's strategy for Asian conquest and the trigger for its stunning attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. 
The assault on the U.S. Pacific Fleet killed 2,335 American servicemen and 68 civilians. 
Yergin 's book, which was seven years in the making, cites the Pacific campaign as one of many examples from the 20th century of oil's crucial and painful role in global and re­gional conflict. It draws paral­lels to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, calling it a high-stakes gamble by a militaristic ruler bent on capturing new oil wealth in order to widen his re­gional domination. 
Saddam Hussein, like Japan's leaders five decades earlier, coveted oil and gave in to "the inevitable and irresistible temp­tation to grasp for its rewards," Yergin writes. 
Historians for years have drawn a connection between oil and Japan's Indochina cam­paigns. Yergin, however, says oil not only played a central role in the broader Japanese war strategy but also was the driving force behind Operation Hawaii, as the Japanese mili­tary called the Pearl Harbor plan. 
Yergin, an international oil specialist and president of the consulting firm Cambridge En­ergy ·Research Associates, ar­gues that the militaristic Japanese leaders saw oil -in particular. Japan's lack of indigenous supplies -as a vul­nerability that could spoil their imperialistic ambitions in Asia. 
"They went to war over oil," Yergin said in an interview. 
So worried was Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of Japan's Combined Fleets, about insecure oil supplies to power his ships that he even sponsored experiments by a "scientist" who claimed he could change water to oil, Yer­gin writes. Japan also consid­ered sinking large sums into a crash program to produce syn­thetic fuel from coal, although this never yielded results. 
Yergin concludes that Japan's main focus in the Asia cam­paigns was to secure access to the oil fields of Borneo and the Dutch East Indies, now Indone­sia. At the time, Japan got 80 percent of its oil from the United States, and it feared the consequences of a possible American cutoff of supplies. 
U.S. asks NATO allies to lend more help against Iraq 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) ­The United States asked its NATO allies Thursday for more help transporting, equipping and reinforcing the multina­tional force in the Persian Gulf, officials said. 
U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was joined by Tom King, his British counterpart, in welcoming the help given so far and urging the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to provide still more. 
The two officials made the appeals during the first day of a two-day session of NATO de­fense ministers. 
Officials said Cheney also told the ministers a post-Cold War NATO should focus on four po­tential threats to its security: the Soviet Union as Europe's largest military power, political instability in Eastern Europe, the spread of chemical arms and ballistic missiles in the Middle East and threats to Western supplies of energy. 
King told reporters Britain 

wants its allies to provide more ammunition, medical equipment and staff, chemical warfare gear, ships and planes to transport troops to the gulf. 
A senior Cheney aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States did not present a detailed list of its needs nor did it ask for an immediate response. 
However, the aide said Cheney cited "categories" of assistance that other officials described as air and sealift help and protec­tive gear for chemical warfare. He also said, "The United States would welcome such additional support as the allies could supply," including troops. 
The aide said several nations "indicated considerable ways in which they might offer addi­tional support." But there were no details. 
The United States has almost 300,000 troops in the gulf re­gion. About 100,000 more U.S. troops are now being sent, and Britain is bringing its deploy­ment to 30,000 over the next few weeks. 
A NATO official termed "very good news" an Iraqi an­nouncement Thursday that President Saddam Hussein had called for releasing all foreign hostages. The release could be­gin as early as Saturday and is hoped to be completed by Christmas, Iraqi officials said. 
However, the NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said Iraq "must 
completely  withdraw  from  
Kuwait  and  restore  the  
legitimate government."  

On other matters, the defense ministers reviewed work on a new NATO defense strategy to reflect the dramatic changes in East-West relations. 
The Cheney aide said the de­fense secretary told the allies NATO no longer faced a "single threat" but a combination of dangers, especially from an un­stable Eastern Europe and tur­bulent Middle East. 
"Quite clearly the scale and nature of the threat has changed, but there are consid­erable ... instabilities remain­ing, not least the rise of na­tionalism" in Eastern Europe, said King, the British minister. 

The new defense strategy, to be adopted next year, will stress greater reliance on smaller, more flexible multina­tional forces. It will also commit the NATO allies to con­tinue relying on a mix of con­ventional and nuclear arms and to maintain a U.S. military presence in Europe, though at a sharply reduced level. 
Officials said discussions con­tinued about whether NATO should operate as an alliance outside its own territory, a politically sensitive issue in many allied capitals. 
German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said a consensus had emerged to rid Europe of short-range nuclear weapons.

NO folk choir to record new album 

Special to the Observer 
The University of Notre Dame Folk Choir will join voices next month with the Cistercian monks of Gethsemani Abbey in Trappist, Ky., to produce a recording of sacred music. 
The recording, "A Companion to Prayer," will include eight compositions of Rev. Chryso­gonous Waddell, director of music for the monks of Geth­semani. Readings from the works of Thomas Merton, the poet, essayist, literary critic, photographer, hermit and Gethsemani's best known monk. will be interspersed among the musical pieces. 
Entrenched 
The project is unprecedented in its combination of a monastic choir with a collegiate ensemble, according to Steven Warner, director of Notre Dame's Folk Choir. 
"Because of this," Warner said, "it will bring together a unique sound including the Abbey's male chant and the Folk Choir's full four-part harmony, guitar, organ, flute, harp and violin." 
Warner said that the record­ing will begin at Gethsemani in January and be completed at Notre Dame. He anticipates that it will be made available to the public by mid-April. 


WASHINGTON (AP) -William Black, a blunt-spoken savings and loan regulator, once prompted financier Charles Keating Jr. to write, "Kill him dead." 
Lawyers for the so-called Keating Five senators did not go that far, but they clearly were unhappy with Black's tes­timony Wednesday before the Senate Ethics Committee. 
Black offered the most dra­matic and damaging testimony so far in the panel's hearings into allegations that the sena­tors improperly intervened with S&L regulators on behalf of Keating, a financial contributor. 
"It is the most fundamental smear," declared William Tay­lor, attorney for Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. 
Black, a red-bearded senior attorney with the federal gov­ernment's thrift regulatory agency, was returning to the witness stand today for more cross-examination by the de­fense lawyers. 
After hearing Black on 
Wrecked Plane 

Campesinos from the northern El Salvadoran town of La Laguna view the remains of an El Salvador military AC-47 airplane shot down by a ground-to-air missile fired by the FMLN guerrilla group Tuesday morning. Two pilots were killed, one survived and a fourth crew member was missing. 
Keating senators hurt by Black testimony 
pressured regulators to help Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan. 
And he raised new allega­tions, saying that pressure by the senators prompted the Fed­eral Home Loan Bank Board to delay and relax regulatory con­trols on Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln, which subsequently was taken over by the govern­ment. 
The result, Black said, was greater losses -which taxpay­ers eventually must bear ­than otherwise would have oc­curred. 
"This ... is probably the worst institution in America, and in­stead of people trying to help bring it under control, five U.S. senators were pushing us in the opposite direction," he testified. 
None of the five senators was present for Black's testimony. Besides Cranston, they are Re­publican John McCain of Ari­zona and Democrats Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan. 
Wednesday, the Ethics Commit­tee disclosed it had voted to grant limited use immunity to compel the testimony of James Grogan, the former top aide and lobbyist for Keating. 
The panel met in private for two hours today, and afterward said Grogan would produce subpoenaed documents in an executive session next Wednesday and undergo ques­tioning again on Monday, Dec. 
17. The new schedule will ex­tend the schedule of he public hearings, now in their 13th day, and leave the date of their con­clusion further in doubt. 
Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., the committee's vice chairman, said Grogan would be ques­tioned in public after the execu­tive sessions. The senators un­der investigation will be ques­tioned in public session after Grogan's appearance, Rudman said, meaning the hearings may run until close to Christmas. 
Black, in his first day on the witness stand, supported ear­lier testimony that the senators 
Iraqi soldiers, occupying trench fortifications on the southern front during the Iran-Iraq war, are believed to be digging-in with a similar tactic as the gulf crisis continues.

Woman sentenced for Capitol bombing 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Leftist radical Laura Whitehorn re­ceived a 20-year sentence Thursday for bombing the U.S. Capitol and conspiring to set ofT seven other explosions that a prosecutor called acts of ter­rorism. 
Whitehorn was sentenced along with co-defendant Linda Sue Evans, who was ordered to serve five years for her role in the bombing conspiracy after completing a 35-year term she is already serving for illegally buying firearms. 
The two women, who pleaded guilty in a plea bargain Sept. 7, were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Harold Greene at a pro­ceeding punctuated by the cheers and applause of sup­porters who packed the court­room. 
"You have committed acts of violence which are not excused by good purposes or political purposes," Greene said. "The effect of these kinds of violence are just as devastating to the victims and to society at large as if they were motivated by greed." 
"The defendants Linda Evans and Laura Whitehorn are ter­rorists," Assistant U.S. Attorney Margaret Ellen told the judge. "They are people who by their actions have sought to coerce others by means of threats or violence." 
The Nov. 7, 1983 bomb blast that blew a hole in the wall out­side the Senate chamber and the explosions at seven other locations in Washington and New York City "were not sym­bolic gestures; they were dis­tinct acts of terrorism," Ellen said. 
"Only chance prevented seri­ous harm" to people, she said. 
Over boos of the defendants' supporters, she said, "The gov­ernment has not and does not view these actions as political crimes." 
Evans' involvement in the bombing conspiracy was part of "a pattern of escalating vio­lence" that includes a 1987 conviction for buying firearms and ammunition, Ellen said. 
FBI agents who raided a Bal­timore apartment where Whitehorn and Evans, 43, Jived found components for more bombs and written plans to set ofT explosives at other locations. 

Whitehorn, 45, who raised her right fist to greet support­ers as she entered the court­room, described her involve­ment in what she called a radi­cal struggle against racism, militarism and oppression of poor people. 
"This government put us in a difficult position of choosing between morality and the law," Whitehorn. 
"How did Martin Luther King achieve progress without vio­lence?" Greene asked at one point during the proceeding. 
"The struggle of Martin Luther King is not divorced from other struggles that because of necessity had incorporated violence," said defense attorney Nkechi Taifi. "This whole country is built upon violence," the lawyer said, evoking cheers and applause from the crowd. 



Iraq promises to release hostages 
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) ­President Bush on Thursday welcomed Iraq's surprise promise to free all foreign hostages but said the United States must not relax its war footing in the Persian Gulf. "We've got to continue to keep the pressure on," he said. 
In Washington, Secretary of State James Baker III said Iraq had told the United States that all 900 Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait would be released. And Iraqi Ambassador Mo­hamed Al-Mashat said he hoped all hostages would be out by Christmas. 
The State Department said the Voice of America was broadcasting a message Thursday night saying, "We are making preparations to evacu­ate all U.S. citizens as soon as they are permitted to leave." 
Bush, citing the promised re­lease of the hostages and the easing of Iraq's pressure on the American Embassy in Kuwait, said, "It seems to be a little movement here, a little move­ment there," 
Yet, he said, Saddam Hussein still "must leave Kuwait without reservation, without condition." 
Bush spoke at a news confer­ence at the next-to-last stop of his five-nation South American tour while Baker, 5,000 miles away, testified before Congress to win support for a possible military strike against Iraqi forces. 
Baker said of Saddam's an­nouncement, "It seems to me no coincidence that this comes just one week, just one week, after the international com­munity has authorized the use of force." 
The Iraqi ambassador, on the other hand, said thP release would be risky for his country because "the drums of war" were still beating in the United States. 
Asked when the release would come, he said, "I expect it's going to be within days. Of course I cannot now tell how long it will take to provide all the necessary things for departure but I hope that they will be all of them out for Christmas." 
Officials in Baghdad said the hostages could begin leaving on Saturday. 
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, "We will do everything that's humanly possible to see that they get out as quickly as possible." 
The dramatic move -if car­ried out could well strengthen demands in Congress that Bush allow more time for sanctions to work be­fore resorting to force. 
Facing Baker at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D­Ind., asked, "Why should we not wait for this policy of sanctions, diplomacy and putting in place a credible mili­tary force ... to work?" 
"What is working," Baker re­spondPd, "is that we are begin­ning finally to get the clear message across to Saddam Hussein.... If we want a peace­ful solution, it should be crystal clear to them that force is not going to be ruled out as an op­tion."

DUNLAP, Ind. (AP) -Neither snow nor sleet nor storm of night will keep mail carriers from their appointed rounds. Dogs apparently are another matter. 
A very large Siberian husky wandered into an Elkhart mail truck through an open sliding door Wednesday afternoon while the carrier was making deliveries on foot along U.S. 33 in Dunlap. 
The mailman tried to entice the dog out of the truck, to no avail. Having never seen the animal before, the mailman was reluctant to remove it bod­ily. So he called the Elkhart County Humane Shelter. 
The dog was removed, although the superintendent of operations at the Elkhart Post Office said the 120-pound dog got a little mean when a worker from the animal shelter re­moved it from the van.

Food aid pours into the U.S.S.R. 
MOSCOW (AP) -While gov­
ernment officials squabbled 
Thursday over who was to 
blame for Moscow's food 
shortages, a Soviet Foreign 
Ministry spokesman reported 
that humanitarian aid from 
abroad had topped $160 mil­
lion. 
But if Western nations really 
want Muscovites to have a 
happy holiday season, they 
should send empty bottles. A 
shortage of the glass containers 
threatens to leave the city 
without vodka, wine and cham­
pagne to toast the NewYear. 
In the latest round of finger­pointing over shortages in Moscow that have raised fears of a hungry winter, authorities from regions that supply the capital with meat, milk and other foodstuffs denied they are withholding stocks. 
There is "no need to start a witch-hunt where there are no witches," said V. Syrovatko, an official of the Bryansk region southwest of Moscow, in an in­terview published in Thursday's Sovietskaya Rossiya newspaper. 

Last month, Moscow Deputy Mayor Sergei Stankevich ac­cused the regions of Bryansk, Penza and other areas of violat­ing delivery contracts to the capital. 
A. Kovlyagin, executive committee chairman of the Penza regional council, said his region fulfilled its delivery plans by 97 percent the past 10 months. He said Penza supplied 
18.087 metric tons of meat, of the contracted 19,463 metric tons, and either surpassed or nearly met all its dairy con­tracts, the newspaper reported. 
The neighboring Tver region sent 347 metric tons of meat to Moscow, exceeding the state 
plan of 275 metric tons, Soviet­
skaya Rossiya said. 
Kovlyagin blamed any short­
ages on Moscow city officials 
for failing to establish contact 
with regional authorities, it re­
ported. 
Moscow's milk supply is down 
15 to 20 percent the last 11 
months, Soviet television re­
ported Thursday. It said 20,000 
metric tons of powdered milk is 
being sent to the capital. 
Soviet officials say food pro­
duction is no lower than last 
year, including a record grain 
harvest this year. Many blame 
barren store shelves on a 
crumbling distribution system 
and panicked consumers. 
Many regions halted ship­ments of food and consumer goods to other areas to protest Kremlin policies. Rather than obey central government de­mands for food deliveries to the cities at state prices they con­sider too low, farmers are trading directly with factories and other consumers for other scarce supplies. 
Aid from abroad kept arriving Thursday. The second of two Israeli jetliners filled with fruit, vegetables, medicine and 15 metric tons of powdered milk arrived in Moscow Thursday night. 

The powdered milk was trucked from the airport to Khimkenskaya Hospital in Moscow and to Soltikovsky Children's Home outside the city, officials said. 
About 20 metric tons of food arrived Thursday from the United States, Tass said, with­out specifying who sent it. Len­ingrad received more than 12 metric tons and Moscow 17 metric tons from Germany, Tass said. 
More shipments were an­
nounced from Norway and 
Germany on Thursday, officials 
in those countries said. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Vitaly Churkin told a briefing 
$160 million worth of food has 
been sent to this country or is 
in the pipeline. He said govern­
ments and charitable organiza­
tions from 21 nations have 
promised or delivered aid. 
Tass said any information 
about distribution of foreign 
food aid may be directed to the 
government commission re­
sponsible for overseeing the 
shipments, headed by Deputy 
Prime Minister Lev Voronin. 
By Dec. 15, more than 200,000 food parcels, each weighing 22 pounds, will start arriving here, containing such items as milk, macaroni, meat, vegetables and fruit, Churkin said. 
Churkin said Spain, Italy, France and Canada offered fi­nancial aid for food purchases, and negotiations are under way with Austria, Britain, Australia, Greece, South Korea, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
He praised Tuesday's com­ments in Britain by former President Ronald Reagan, who called Mikhail Gorbachev a "friend in need" and said the West must offer assistance. 
But the newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda said Moscow's latest need is empty bottles -half-liter containers, preferably -to hold holiday spirits. 
The city faces a "dry" New Year because consumers are not returning empties, though stores now pay about 90 cents a bottle, more than twice the usual price.

New contraceptive to be approved soon by F.D.A. 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Federal approval is expected soon for a new contraceptive implant for women that would provide protection against pregnancy for up to five years, government and industry sources say. 
Approval of Norplant would mark the most important birth control advance since oral con­traceptives and the intrauterine device, or IUD. It would be the first long-acting, hormonal contraceptive available in the United States. 
The Norplant method involves implanting six silicone rubber capsules, each about the size of a wooden matchstick, in a woman's upper arm. The cap­sules contain a contraceptive hormone that is released slowly over time. 
The capsules are implanted in a minor surgical procedure, and the contraceptive effects are reversed immediately with removal. 
"It's another major option for American women because it's long acting and yet it's re­versible," said Sandra Wald­man. a spokeswoman for The Population Council in New York. which began researching

"It's also a good substitute for sterilization for women who have completed their families, but also good for women who cannot use estrogen. IUDS, women who are breast feed­ing," she said. "Its a major ex­pansion of options." 
The contraceptive has been approved in 16 countries, she said. 
Approval by the Food and Drug Administration could come within days, said the sources, who spoke on the con­dition of anonymity. 
In the United States, it would be marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of Philadelphia. 
Norplant contains nothing new -the silicone rubber and the hormone, levonorgestrel. have been used for many years. according to the council's liter­ature. However, the delivery over a long period of time is a new technique. 
A Food and Drug advisory board recommended approval of Norplant in April 1989, say­ing the method was at least as safe and effective as any other contraceptive on the market.

Bush doubts January summit 
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) ­
President Bush on Thursday 
cast doubt on prospects for a 
January summit in Moscow 
with Soviet President Mikhail 
Gorbachev, and sources said 
the meeting might slip to 
February. 
The Persian Gulf crisis is one 
reason for the uncertain timing, 
said White House press 
secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 
"It's not an easy time to be 
traveling." he said, referring to 
the Jan. 15 deadline set in a 
U.N. resolution authorizing force against Iraq unless it withdraws from Kuwait. 
Both the United States and 
Soviet Union are unsettled 
about summit timing, Fitzwater 
said. 
"I think we're saying, let's 
wait a little bit longer before we 
set a date," he added. 
Bush said at a Santiago news 
conference that plans for a 
meeting next month were "not 
totally" abandoned. Asked if the 
trip were being canceled, he 
replied, "Not as far as I'm con­
cerned." 
Sources said January was the target date for the trip but that scheduling difficulties and lo­gistical problems had cropped up. "As a result, it's possible it could slip to February," one source said, speaking on condi­tion of anonymity. 
Bush has said he would like to visit Moscow early next year, but has insisted that his trip be linked with the signing of a U.S.-Soviet treaty to slash long­range nuclear weapons. 
A White House advance team was supposed to have left for Moscow in mid-December to begin planning for Bush's visit, but the trip was unexpectedly called otT. One source familiar with Bush's schedule said it showed no foreign travel in January. 
Fitzwater said the advance trip was put otT because of the lack of a date for Bush's visit. He said Jan. 6 had been men­tioned as one possibility, and that mid-January had been an­other. 
"It's all tied to the START (nuclear arms negotiations) treaty," he said. 
As president, Bush has held summits with Gorbachev in Washington, Malta and Helsinki. The two leaders met for more than two hours in Paris last month during a 34­nation summit on the future of Europe after the Cold War.

LETTERS 


Criticism of 'propaganda' reveals patriarchal position 
Dear Editor: 
Cluelessness is one of those privileges that only those in­vested in existing power struc­tures can afford. I am referring to the self-unconsciousness of Edward D. O'Connor, C.S.C. (The Observer, Nov. 29) In his diatribe against the "two­pronged-assault from women and homosexuals." O'Connor deplores the "systematic pro­pagandizing of a single view­point," which, in his fourth and fifth paragraphs (and then obliquely), he identifies as sup­port for the ordination of women and dissent from the Church's position on homosex­uality. 
The arrogance of his own choice of labels ("The Church") reveals the hegemony all his alarmism and omission cannot conceal and all our efforts can­not seem to topple. If O'Connor truly believes that a single semester's semi-responsible treatment of the issues sur­rounding women's and gay peoples' places in the Church hierarchy overbalances the scales so grossly weighed down by the dross of patriarchy that that precious authority structure is in danger of being un­dermined, he is living in my dream world without a clue. Would that it were so simple to topple that deadly, all-but-uni­versal evil, patriarchy. 

Is O'Connor blind to the con­stant barrage of patriarchal symbolism and rhetoric that floods this campus, the Roman Church and the world? An un­critical tour of the campus will highlight the presence of male, (celibate) heterosexuals as ideal authority figures. Facing the football stadium (in a true revelation of the priorities of this Catholic University) is the largest group of patriarchs. From ROTC building to shining ROTC building, the phallocentric and destructive focus of this campus' commitment to patriarchy is glaringly obvious. The only female authority figure around here is a gilded, eternally-virginal Mary; the phallocratic iconography and symbolism are hardly balanced by her gaudy presence. How many weekends, not to say bodies, are sacrificed on the al­tar of aggressively-heterosexual violent rituals of an over­compensating male bonding? 
Never mind. O'Connor sug­gests that if the "propaganda" were "distinctively Catholic ... [it would] ... still be regrettable, but at least understandable, at a university to whose role it be­longs to examine human topics in the light of faith." To unpack the sentence: at least if the views expressed were orthodox views of the One True Faith, the methods of propaganda would be more acceptable. Would they? And is he not begging the question as to whether the pre­sentation of the dissident views he deplores is a propagandistic presentation? Certainly he never proves that this is the case. And isn't he willfully ig­noring both the fact that ND has never satisfactorily enforced a standard of academic freedom to liberate W; classrooms from the fear of Inquisition and the fact that the atmosphere of ND, in and out of the classroom, is overwhelmingly weighted towards uncritical acceptance of patriarchal and capitalist assumptions about racial and sexual hierarchies. 
O'Connor's most offensive and propagandistic "arguments" are standard fare: he evokes the authority of the Holy Father and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and "The church's position on homosexuality [which] has been established and refined by many centuries of carefully reasoned theologi­cal traditions" to dismiss both the claims of women and gay people to be accorded human dignity and reasonable treat­ment by the church of patri­archy on earth. 
Lest the tired argument from authority should fail to con­vince, O'Connor then employs that staple of homophobia of every persuasion-the argu­ment from nature. Citing the "natural complementarity of man and woman" and "the rev­erence for the order of nature characteristic of Catholicism," O'Connor seeks to evoke the inaccurate stigma which a nar­row survey of animal behavior in nature raises against disap­proved social behavior (the sharing of authority by women and the freedom of gay people to express their natural orien­tation). Neither heterosexuality nor monogamy fare any better than homosexuality and promiscuity, not to mention incest and brutality, when natu­ral paradigms are taken as prescriptive for humans. 
Not only is O'Connor's charge of irresponsible propaganda, levelled against feminist and gay-sympathetic "lecture(s]. seminar[s). [etc.]," unsubstan­tiated by his argument; O'Connor reveals himself as an uncritical proponent of the propaganda of the already all­powerful structures of patri­archy.

Censorship foils founders' plans for free expression 
By Timothy Sutton 
In the course of human events, conflicts and differences of opinion are not only natural, they are inevitable. When these conflicts arise, there are gener­ally two ways of dealing with them. First. avoiding that which causes the problem or, secondly, and more controver­sially, trying to prohibit the ac­tions which cause the conflict. While there are cases when the second method can be employed by our government, prohibiting actions on the grounds of morality is completely inconsistent with our constitution. 
The founding fathers of this country took great pains to de­cide what basic human rights our government would be founded upon. In the Constitution, they included these words which made our country great: "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their cre­ator with certain unalienable right; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap­piness." 

While our rights to life and the pursuit of happiness remain relatively unchallenged, our rights to liberty and freedom are attacked almost daily in the form of censorship. The weapon used most often against this liberty is called morality. 
Morality can be defined as a system of behavior based on a standard of right and wrong. Most often the standard is de­fined by religious beliefs. While morality and religion are very good, they have absolutely no place in government and in American law. Often it is this morality that leads to conflicts and disagreements. While we are often offended by some­one's actions on a moral basis, this does not give us the right to restrict the right of the indi­vidual. Nowhere in our consti­tution is it written that we have the right not to be offended. 
Censorship is the act of con­trolling the expression, actions, or even beliefs of a group or individual. Almost always this is to appease a group that feels offended or threatened by the behavior. The purpose of our law is to protect the rights of every citizen, not to define a standard of what is right and what is not. The only time ac­tions and behavior should be controlled are when they violate the rights of other parties. It is in the case of these violations that the law must define right and wrong. Murder is not a crime because it is a sin; it is a crime because it violates the victim's right to life. Here it is the place of the government to restrict, define standards, and set punishment. 
However, using nudity in art as a form of expression is not a crime. While it may offend some, even most. of the public, it does not violate the rights of anyone. Nobody has ever been forced into a museum to view art. If you do not agree with a form of expression, it is your right to avoid it but not your right to restrict it. 
If we are to call ourselves American, we must believe that the three basic rights our gov­ernment is based upon are ab­solute. We cannot support any form of censorship in which the rights of citizens are eradicated on the basis of morality. This is not an attack on morality, but, rather, a statement that it has to remain independent of the laws which protect our rights. 
Timothy Sutton is a 1990 Graduate of the University of Notre Dame.

The brave ones were Alison

president of Student Govern­
ment; Erin Lavelle, Student

Karen Robinson, an All­

for the Notre Dame women's

one of each cookie and asked to 
comment on the best looking 
and the best tasting. 

In terms of looks, the candy 
cane cookies won 
unanimously-no other cookie 
had a chance. No comments 
were made about the other five, 
except that the brown-edge 
cookies looked burned instead 
of festive. 

The taste buds, though, told a different story. Three out of five judges picked the choco-nut dainties. The candy canes and the coconut macaroons each received one vote. The brown­edge cookies were voteless, as were the rum balls. This sur­prised us, seeing as how they tasted "like alcoholic Munchkins," according to Cocks. We figured those would be a big hit. 
Don't let the opinions of only five people dissuade you from any of these cookies. Most of these are family favorites, and would make for a great present to a girlfriend or boyfriend, or even to some lonely soldier

Cookies & other items help needy 
BY ROBYN SIMMONS Assistant Accent Editor 
I 
f you think about the Center for the Homeless this holiday season, think of 
underwear. 

Underwear, toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap and other toiletry items are always in de­mand for South Bend's home­less, and since Christmastime traditionally is the season for giving, anybody wishing to make a donation to the Center for the Homeless on 813 S. Michigan should keep these items in mind. 
Even though the leftovers from the Observer cookie bake­ofT will be put to good use at the Center, Operations Director Tammy Oehm stressed the need for more practical items that would benefit the homeless long after the holiday season. 
"Toiletry items are ·our biggest need," said Oehm, "Shampoo, things like that. We can always use towels and washcloths." 
"We're always looking for Christmas gifts for the adults," she said, "We always have more than enough gifts for children at Christmas time." 
According to Oehm, any new clothes, especially gloves, hats and scarves would make suit­able presents for the adults at the Center. The Center for the Homeless does not except dona­tions of used clothing due to lack of space. 
Oehm added that food items are always welcome. "We use just about anything as far as that goes, because we make boxes for people when they move out," she said.

A Christmas feast for all nations 
I'm tempted to design a Christmas card which shows a country club in Westchester, ly­ing in ruins like the Second Temple. The verse would be by 
T.S. Eliot, using the style of Isaiah: "In the land of lobelias and tennis flannelsffhe rabbit shall burrow and the thorn re­visit.ffhe nettle shall flourish on the gravel court,/And the wind shall say: 'Here were de­cent godless people:ffheir only monument the asphalt road/And a thousand lost golf balls." 
Eliot, updated, may have wrung his hands also over the plastic evergreens, hung with phoney poinsettias, that are passed off at the shopping malls as Christmas trees. 
Hasn't Christmas become a poor season in which to express the Christian optimism? As members belonging to the Church-of-What's-Happening­Now, we must at least pay lip service to those outdated myths of religion which should help us keep Christ in Christmas; otherwise we could look sullen, like children who found coal in the stockings that were hung by the chimney with care. 
In a country where abortion is so fashionable that it should be made a sacrament, what so impressive about the Virgin Birth? Isn't the loss of virginity celebrated among us as though it were a rite of passage, like a bar mitzvah? Isn't conception itself a miracle of nature that you're free to cancel like a plane reservation? 
As an American, I tend to be tolerant of any man's death, as long as it's not my own. Of course some American are 

Father Robert Griffin 
Letters to a Lonely God 
zealots who climb on bandwag­ons. Elizabeth Taylor, for ex­ample, is famous for fighting against AIDS; but how does she feel about Wade versus Roe? 
How do pro-lifers feel about the death penalty? How do the pro-choice people feel about Jews who died in the Holocaust? How are the Vietnam peace protestors sup­porting the war against drugs? 
And how about the college students who are up in arms, so to speak, over the Persian Gulf? Up until now, they've been prepared to live, and let die; they're starting to fear that their own ox may be gored. 
Why, they want to know, should they lay down their lives so that old folks can afford to but oil that will keep them warm in winter? Are they too young to realize that any man's death-and the death of every urchin ripped untimely from the womb-diminishes them; so that, when the death bell tolls, it tolls for them? 
Every American has the God­given right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; if you can believe that without suffer­ing from tunnel vision, you can help turn this country of ours into the Promised Land. But if you refuse to serve your down­and-out neighbor as a Good Samaritan, why do you think the neighborhood should care if you have you own backside to the wall? 

Last night, on PBS television, Joseph Campbell told Bill Moyers that men need myths to live by. "What will happen to men who have no myths?" asked Moyers. "Then," said Campbell, "We will have the kind of world you read about daily in the New York Times." 
Primitive people live, says Campbell, as though they had a covenant with Nature that gives them a reverence for life. Hemingway's old man of the sea C<!-me to my mind: Santiago, struggling with the great fish to the death, "Either I kill you, or you kill me." That's the way things are when a fisherman has to make a liv­ing from the sea. 
Isn't conception itself a miracle of nature that you're free to cancel like a plane reservation? 
The American Indians, re­specting the buffalo they needed to survive on, turned ev­ery kill into a religious ritual, says Campbell; some of those rituals, he said, should remind us of the Catholic Mass. "As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods," wrote Shakespeare: "They kill us for their sport." 

White men coming to America were like wanton boys, killing the buffaloes for their sport, and otherwise raping the wilderness. In less than a decade, they virtually wiped out the buffalo herds, because they were too spoiled or selfish to figure out that they would have treated this New Eden as though it were entrusted to them as partners in a covenant. 
Since · 1973, we've been slaughtering the innocents as though they had no share as partners in Christ's covenant of love with us. Is mother's love a myth that American women are giving up on? 
Four thousand years have passed since God delivered you Isaac from the upraised knife of Abraham, his father; an event that may have marked the end of human sacrifice among the Israelites. Isaac's mother, Sarah, hearing what happened, cried out 7 times, say the Jewish rabbis, before dying of horror. Wilfred Owen wrote a poem about Abraham as the prototype of all the fathers in every generation who send their sons to die in war. 
Maybe I should design a Christmas card listing all the kinds of human sacrifice that have taken place since Isaac's near-holocaust. I could use the Christmas sermon, from Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral, as a follow-up: "Not only do we at the feast of Christmas celebrate at once Our Lord's Birth and His Death; but on the next day we celebrate the martyrdom of His first martyr. the blessed Stephen... 
"Beloved, we do not think of a martyr as a good Christian who has been killed because he is a Christian ... A martyr is al­ways made by the design of God, for His love of men, to warn them and to lead them, to bring them back to His ways ... The true martyr is he who has become the instrument of God, who has his will in the will of God, not lost it but found it, for he has found freedom in sub­mission to God... " 
Maybe the tragedy of our contemporary death lists is that so man of them can't really have the dignity of being martyrs. Are AIDS patients who check out early really mar­tyrs, or are they only victims? 
In what way does an aborted child shed his blood for Christ? Soldiers who die in battle may be patriots martyred for their country; but can we say that their blood is the seed of the Church? 
I wish Christmas were simple enough to be a feast for all na­tions. Then the doubters could come and kneel down before the crib with the cattle. Maybe they come anyway, hoping for magic that will turn them into children ·in love with the Christmas chilrl. 
That's why we must tolerate the plastic decorations, and send plain cards addressed to men of good will. Maybe the grace from Christmas lingers all through the year, helping victims needing a leg up to Jesus; binding them to Him as the Church's quintessential martyr, Who has lost His will in the will of God.

Canadiens defeat Boston, 6-4 
BOSTON (AP) -Stephan Lebeau and Brian Skrudland scored rare power-play goals as the Montreal Canadiens moved within one point of Adams Division-leading Boston with a 6-4 victory over the Bruins on Thursday night. 
The Montreal power-play, once the best, is now the worst in the 21-team National Hockey League with 17 goals in 137 chances. 
Lyndon Byers put the Bruins in front 1-0 with a goal at 1:34 of the first period, but Lebeau came right back with his power-play score at 11: 16. 
Rookie winger Benoit Brunet gave the Canadiens a 2-1 lead with his first NHL goal at 14:29, but Dave Christian tied it with a tip-in from the slot at 19:24. 
Skrudland fired his power­play goal at 9:09 of the second period and defenseman Eric Desjardins put Montreal up by two with a goal off Boston de­fenseman Glen Wesley's skate 1:39later. 
The Bruins' Craig Janney closed the gap to 4-3 as he teed up a power-play goal at 19:17. 
Stephane Richer scored his 13th of the season at 1:31 of the third period to make it 5-3 Montreal before Randy Burridge scored Boston's fourth goal at 15:10. 
Guy Carbonneau scored into an empty net for the Canadiens at 19:59. 
The victory left the Canadiens with 33 points to Boston's 34 in the race for first place in the Adams Division. Boston, however, has three games in hand. 
Sabres 4, Flyers 3 

Rick Vaive scored with 4:02 left in the third period as the Buffalo Sabres held off a rally by the Philadelphia Flyers for a 4-3 victory on Thursday night. 

Vaive put in his own rebound for the winning goal. He first redirected Doug Badger's point drive. Goaltender Ken Wregget, seeing action for the first time since injuring his hip Nov. 4, made the initial save, but Vaive pushed the puck around the sprawled Wregget. . 
Philadelphia trailed 3-0 in the second period when Mike Ricci won a faceoff, tipped the puck back to the point, and rushed to the net to tip in Gord Murphy's point drive at 12:15.

Sutter rebound with 5:23 gone in the third period and Derrick Smith. just 37 seconds later, skated from behind the net and delivered a backhander just inside the post to tie the game. 
The Flyers then wasted a chance to score when Buffalo goaltender Clint Malarchuk was assessed a five-minute spearing penalty and a game miscon­duct. 
The Sabres scored their first three goals in the first 5:37 of the second period. Dave Andreychuk took a pass from Bodger and rifled in a power­play goal at 3:59. 
Irish sailors take eighth place in National Sloops 
Club sporl<; are played on a wide variety of surfaces. Water floats the boats of members of the Notre Dame rowing and sailing clubs, and each of these teams enjoyed successful recent outings. 
Traveling to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, the 

Sailing team earned eighth place in Rolando de Aguiar
the ICSA National Sloop 
Championship. Skippered by Watts Club Corner 
Hudgens, the Irish team fought 
through three grueling days of 
sailing. 
Notre Dame faced nine of the top teams in the country at this regatta, including eventual champion Charleston. The teams competing in Annapolis came from such geographically diverse locations as Connecticut and Hawaii. Indeed, the Irish were one of only two clubs at the regatta which hailed from a landlocked state. Miami of Ohio placed tenth in the championship. 
The National Sloop Championship was raced in J-24s, which are much larger than the FJs which the Irish usually sail. In fact, the team had never sailed a J-24 until three hours of practice time readied them for the competition. 
Needless to say, the differences between the keels and weights of the two boats was difficult for the team to master. 
"Imagine the difference between a Cadillac and a Porsche," said Hudgens. "They both can reach high speeds, but the Porsche handles much differently than the Caddy." 
The Irish established themselves as a collegiate sailing force at this regatta, and they hope to continue their improvement in the future. 
"We established ourselves this year," said freshman Michael Kane. The Irish have completed their season for 1990, but will host a regatta on St. Joseph's Lake after Spring Break. 
Notre Dame Crew enjoyed a successful weekend at the Frostbite Regatta as the men's novice crew placed second out of 32. 
Several of the top programs in the country competed in Philadelphia, including tbe University of Pennsylvania, who beat out the Irish by a mere .3 seconds.

Even with McGrade hounding her all over the court, Robinson ended up leading Notre Dame in scoring with 18. Davis added 16, and Nowlin 14.

bench, scoring 13 points, grab­bing four rebounds, and playing good interior defense. 
"Katura's playing some great ball now," Weber said. "She's eventually going to become a powerhouse for us; after this trip to California, she really made a statement." 
Notre Dame continues its homestand Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m. against Syracuse (3­3). The Orangewomen come into the game off a 72-63 loss at Canisius Wednesday night. 
fhe Orangewomen are led by sophomore center Holly Oslander with 16.0 points and 
7.5 rebounds per game as of the Canisius game. Two other Syracuse players average in double figures, Erin Kenneally 
(10.4 ppg) and Davita Smith 
(10.2 ppg). 
Syracuse is not especially strong on the glass, being outrebounded by an average of 11 boards per game. 
The Orangewomen are not good free throw shooters, going 59 for 107 (55.1 percent) for the year, as well as only 43.8 percent from the field. 
Although the Irish enter the contest in the midst of a three­game losing streak, Weber be­lieves it's far from the time to push the panic button. 
"Our biggest thing right now is we really have to turn and focus on ourselves," Weber said. "We're coming off three losses in a row to three really good teams, and that's what our players have to understand. 
"These aren't just scrappy teams that we're losing to. We're losing to good teams, and they got to keep their heads up, because we have an entire season to go through."

'i Aging Celtics riding huge surge Ex-Blue Jay Bell headed 
BOSTON (AP) -Larry Bird turns 34 Friday, but he ran like a rookie and scored 43 points against the speedy Denver Nuggets just two nights earlier. 
Seven-foot, 37-year-old cen­ter Robert Parish is the NBA's oldest player, but he stole a ball behind the midcourt line and outsprinted would-be defenders to the basket for an easy layup. He had 25 points and 14 re­bounds. 
Kevin McHale, who will be 33 on Dec. 19, had 19 points and eight rebounds and baffied the Nuggets with his array of inside moves. 
The Boston Celtics ended up with their lOth win in 11 games. Their record is 14-3, second best in the NBA and their best start since 1985-86 whim they won their last title. 
Revitalized veterans and en­thusiastic and talented young­sters have turned around the decline of the tradition-rich franchise. 
But Wednesday night's 148­140 victory was against a team with the league's second worst record. And the Celtics had to struggle to get it after being tied with 5:35 left. 
In their last five games, the only team with a winning record the Celtics faced was Philadelphia, and the 76ers won. 
On Friday night, they begin a three-game road trip in Dallas, 6-9 after losing its last three. But then the Celtics play at San Antonio and Houston before returning home for games 
for Wrigley after signing 
pick up playing in the friendly confines of Wrigley Field. 
Toronto selected Bell from the Philadelphia Phillies organization in 1978 and he went on to become the club's all-time leader in home runs and RBis. 
It was the Cubs' second major free-agent acquisition of the off-season. On Nov. 21, they signed left-hander Danny Jackson to a four-year deal for $10.5 million. 
Bell's career in Toronto was marked by some troubled times with managers and the fans. 
Bell, a three-time All-Star, balked when manager Jimy Williams wanted to make him a designated hitter and was often booed by the fans when he hit a slump. Bell gave it back, though, claiming the fans were jealous of his salary. 
In his nine seasons, Bell has made 77 errors in the outfield for an untidy average of 8.5 a season. He will have less ground to cover at Wrigley Field, however. 
Bell helped the Blue Jays win the AL East in 1985 and 1987. but had only one homer and three RBis in 48 playoff at-bats. 
The acquisition of Bell may lead to another deal for Chicago. 


ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -A bitter George Bell said good riddance to the Blue Jays on Thursday when he signed a $9.8 million, three-year con­tract with the Chicago Cubs. 
"We're just thrilled to have a quality player like George Bell," Cubs general manager Jim Frey said. "Since late in the season, we've been talking about what we could do to help our club." 
Bell, a free agent, won the MVP award in 1987 when he hit .308 with 47 home runs and 134 RBis. 
The Blue Jays lost interest in re-signing the left fielder when they acquired outfielder Joe Carter along with second baseman Roberto Alomar from San Diego on Wednesday for Fred McGriff and Tony Fernandez. 
Bell, 31, now joins former Montreal star Andre Dawson in the Cubs outfield. Dawson won the National League MVP in his first season with Chicago. 
With Toronto, Bell hit 202 homers and drove in 740 runs. He has a lifetime aver­age of .286.

Purdue selects new head coach 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -Itwon't be the run-and-shoot offense of his predecessor, but new Purdue football coach Jim Colletto promises a familiar look to the Boilermakers' offense. 
Colletto, the former offensive coordinator at Ohio State, signed a five-year contract to coach Purdue on Thursday and said he planned to junk the run-and-shoot offense that pro­duced a 2-9 record this year and led to the resignation of Fred Akers only one week ear­lier. 
The Boilermakers netted only 612 yards rushing this past season, an average of 1.0 per carry and 55.6 per game. 
"I think the things we have to do are the same things I've done for a lot of years in coaching; get back to some of the things I believe in, in terms of running the football," said Colletto, who was the offensive coordinator at Purdue from 1982-84 and has been an assis­tant or head football coach since graduating from UCLA in 1967. 
The offense that they're going to see here is going to be very similar to what we did here with (quarterbacks Jim) Everett and (Scott) Campbell. It's not going to be anything new," Colletto told the news conference where he was intro­duced as Purdue's new coach. 
Colletto anticipates a busy three weeks in his new job, meeting his players, selecting a staff and launching an active recruiting program. 
He was meeting with his play­ers Thursday afternoon and also planned to have several meetings with individuals. 
"I don't really know a lot about the football players as an ability level," Colletto said. "I think there are some good players here." 
One player he definitely hopes to retain is quarterback Eric Hunter, who had indicated he might consider leaving the Boilermakers if he wasn't happy with the new coach. 
"One gentleman I'm going to talk to individually will be Eric. If he has any recollection of history here and wants to play in an offense that featured a young man (Everett) that's playing in the NFL very suc­cessfully with the Los Angeles Rams, the quarterback was a very focal part of that football team and will be in future teams here," Colletto said. 
Athletic Director George King said Colletto, 46, had been given a five-year contract at a salary of $110,000 and would also receive additional income from other areas such as shoe contracts, radio and television shows. 
Assembling a staff to rebuild a program that hasn't had a winning season since it went 7­5, included a loss to Virginia in the Peach Bowl, in his final year with. the Boilermakers is a major priority. 
''I'm going to talk to all the coaches on the present staff. There are some I know person­ally and I'm sure there may be some that I would select to re­main here," Colletto said.

to be a winner," 
But that's not all the Belles will have to improve upon. As they look to Saturday night's home game against Division II University of Indianapolis. they realize that turnovers. such as the 24 committed in Wednesday night's game, must be controlled. The Belles will also have to improve their rebounding. Calvin outrebounded the Belles 50-35. 

"We had too many turnovers. We'd cause them to turn the ball over, but before we got the ball down the court we'd give it right back," added Wood. 

The team is looking to Saturday night's game as a chance to bet back on the right track. But the Belles also realize that it will be tough. Indianapolis has strong perimeter shooters, but the Saint Mary's players hope their defense will contain their opponents' attack. 
"They are strong in their conference and lhey have a lot of experience from last year," said Wood. "But our defensive quickness will be our strength.

The Notre Dame swim teams will complete a five-meet home­stand when Bowling Green vis­its the Rolfs Aquatic Center Saturday at 1 p.m. 
The Irish men's and women's squads are fresh off last week­end's double-victory in the National Catholic Championships. The men pulled ahead of LaSalle in the final re­lay to edge the Explorers 7 54 1/2-752 last Saturday, while the women led throughout much of the tournament and finished more than 100 points ahead of Villanova. which finished in second place. 
This weekend will mark the 25th time the Irish men's team has squared off against Bowling Green. The Falcons lead the series 16-8, but Notre Dame won last year's meeting by a score of 129-93 behind Brian Rini's two first-place finishes. 
The women, meanwhile. will try to avenge last year's 151­149 defeat at the hands of the Falcons. In that meet Notre Dame star Tanya Williams led her team's cause with four in­dividual victories, including University records in the 200­yard butterfly and the 400-yard individual medley.

Zadra's hustle helps ND in current winning string 

NEW YORK (AP) -Ty Detmer, the third straight junior winner of the Heisman Trophy, claimed his award Thursday, saying he'll be back for another season if not for another statue. 
"It'll be a different team and a whole new season," the BYU quarterback said. "We're losing quite a few players. We've got a young team next year. I'm going to enjoy it now, while it's here." 
Archie Griffin, the Heisman winner in 1974 and 1975, is the only player to win the award twice. Ironically, two of Detmer's chief rivals for the trophy this year -Houston's David Klingler and Notre Dame's Raghib "Rocket" Ismail -are also juniors. 
Detmer rode a string of 23 consecutive 300-yard games to college football's most presti­gious award. His resume in­cludes 25 NCAA passing or total offense records that he has set or tied. The 13th-ranked Cougars (10-2) will meet Texas A&M in the Holiday Bowl on Dec. 29. 
He recalled the moments be­fore he found out he had won it last Saturday night. 
"Right before, I felt a rush of adrenaline and my stomach turning," he said. "Then you hear your name. It was a great feeling. I was surprised because you don't want to get your hopes up." 
It was the ultimate prize for a player who, at 6-foot, 175 pounds, often was criticized as being undersized. Is he? "I hear that I am," he said. "If I sat around wishing I was bigger, I probably couldn't play." 
In fact, though, he once was told exactly that -that he couldn't play because he was too small. That was in junior high in San Antonio. Detmer's solution was to repeat the sev­enth grade. 
"I was a junior high school redshirt," he said. Did it help? "Scholastically, it did," he 
said. "It gave me confidence." And athletically? "Instead of small, I was av­erage," he said. 
When Detmer decided he was going to be a quarterback. he went shopping for the appro­priate program rather than waiting to be recruited. "I committed before my senior year in high school," he said. "I recruited them because of the quarterback situation." 
Passing still wasn't the most popular method of moving the ball in the late '80s, with many teams opting for the option or 1­formation. Detmer went shopping for a place where he wouldn't spend his time hand­ing off. 
"I just sort of dropped in on them," he said of his unsolicited visit to BYU. "They had heard of me. They were interested." 
Detmer, who had done his homework, knew that BYU and Miami had the most air-ori­ented offenses. 
By RICH KURZ Sports Writer 
When Notre Dame hockey coach Ric Schafer speaks of ju­nior left wing Lou Zadra he is full of praise and admiration. 
"He's a very valuable player," says Schafer. "He's the heart and soul of the team. He's the guy we can count on to provide skill and toughness." 
So far this season, Zadra has proved to be quite valuable of­fensively for the Irish. He is tied for the team lead in goals with eight and is third on the team in total points with 13. 
Zadra has piled up these numbers despite being shuffied around, filling gaps wherever Schafer needs him. 
"He has been moved around a lot," says Schafer. "He's changed positions, he's changed lines. He's killed penalties and he's been in on the power play." 
Throughout all of these situ­ations, Zadra has thrived. He has scored on the power play (once) and shorthanded (twice), and he's even scored a game­winner (against UMass-Boston). 
The versatile roles he has played suit Zadra just fine. 
"(My role is) just going out and doing what I need to do. Whatever is needed, I try to ad­just and do," he says. 
According to Zadra, his role on the team goes beyond just scoring goals and making checks. 
"(I'm a) vocal leader," he says, "somebody who can bring the team up, when we're going bad." 
His prep background obvi­ously prepared Zadra well for the rigors of collegiate hockey. The Catholic Memorial team he played for won the Massachusetts Division I State Championship three years in a row, including the team he cap­tained his senior year. 
"It was a big step up to col­lege hockey, but (playing for a top high school team) has helped me adjust," he says. "It was a good crop of players, guys who play for Harvard and BU." 
Zadra made an immediate contribution to the Notre Dame hockey program as a freshman,

scoring five goals and seven as­
sists. He really came into his 
own as a sophomore, however, 
finishing third on the team in 
scoring with 17 goals and 19 
assists. 
According to Zadra, this team 
compares favorably with the 
teams of the past two years. 
"We have four solid lines, and 
even four sets of defe·nsemen. 
We would never lose a game by 
fatigue. The goaltending is the 
same, if not better, with Greg 
Louder. 
"We should make the inde­
pendent tournament, and pos­
sibly the NCAA Tournament," 
he says. 
Lake Forest (8-1) is the im­mediate concern of Zadra and the Fighting Irish (7-5-1), however. Friday's game against the Foresters marks the first time the Irish will be on the road in its last six matches, a period which saw Notre Dame win six straight games, its longest win streak in three years. 
Zadra doesn't think the road 
trip will affect the play of the 
Irish. 
"We've had a good week of practice, (and) it's only a three­hour bus trip," he says. 
The Irish beat Lake Forest all 
four times they played last sea­
son, but Coach Schafer is not 
counting the Foresters out. 
"I've always respected them," says Schafer. "There hasn't been a bad Lake Forest team since I've been here. They have a possible NCAA Division III berth, and they would like to beat Division I Notre Dame. It should be an interesting matchup." 
Lake Forest beat Kent State, the only common opponent the two teams have so far this sea­son, whom the Irish beat and tied in two games earlier this year. 
The Foresters are led by Doug Bowman who has three goals and seven assists on the season. and Robert Ventura, who has seven goals in Lake Forest's nine games. 
Schafer is counting on the leadership of the veterans to keep the team focused for these final two games before the Christmas break. 
"The upperclassman won't take it lightly," he promises. 
NOTES: After Friday's game, the two teams will return to play Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at the Joyce ACC. ..The Irish just added the University of Wisconsin Badgers to next year's home schedule. The Badgers were the NCAA Champions last season, and should be a big draw. When the

Notre Dame wrestlers to begin dual meets this weekend 

By DAVE DIETEMAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame wrestling team pins down the start of its dual-meet season today with a road trip to Illinois State and a home-stand against Missouri on Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Joyce ACC. 
The two dual meets are the first of the 1990 season for the Irish, who have solely competed in tournaments thus far. 
"So far this season, we have been primarily involved in tour­naments," said Notre Dame head coach Fran McCann. "The reason for that is that compet­ing in a tournament allows us to bring more of our kids along, and the tournaments provide us with lots of competition in a short period of time. 
"I like tournaments because we are so young that they help us to progress. We have made good progress so far. I think that we're all right. This is a young team, and each tourna­ment we have been improving. That is the way it will be with a young team and tough tourna­ments. Each tournament we've been in, we have stepped up the level of competition." 
Despite the relative youth of the Irish, they have recorded impressive decisions in the three tournaments they have participated in to date. 
At the season-opening Michigan State Invitational, four Notre Dame wrestlers ­Marcus Gowens, Jamie Boyd, Todd Layton and Steve King ­seized championships in their weight-classes, while Chuck Weaver placed second and Emil Soehnlen and Mark Gerardi placed third in their respective

weight-classes. At the more competitive St. Louis Open, Gerardi won the 167-pound di­vision, while freshman J.J. McGrew placed fourth at 177 pounds. 
The last time the Irish wres­tled was at the prestigious Las Vegas Invitational. At that tournament, Gowens (126) claimed seventh place, while McGrew (177) finished eighth. 
Unfortunately for Notre Dame, Mark Gerardi has re­portedly not fully recovered from an ankle injury which sidelined him at the Las Vegas Invitational. Gerardi, among many other accomplishments, was a qualifier for last year's NCAA Championships. 
"Mark is not at 100 percent just yet," noted McCann. "It is up to him whether he competes this weekend. He will have to get some competition soon, but we are not sure how he will perform right away." 
When asked about the upcoming dual meet with Illinois State, coach McCann was realistic, yet optimistic. 
"This is an important dual meet for us. They have a solid program and they are always in good shape. In fact, they used to dominate us until recently. This meet is very important for us -even critical -because it is in our region and will have an affect on our seeding in the re­gional tournament at the end of the year." 
Illinois State holds a 6-4 edge over Notre Dame in the lifetime series between the two schools, with the Irish having won four of the last five matches. This year's meet marks the eighth consecutive year of competition between the Redbirds and the

this season, Missouri has beaten SIU-Edwardsville 35-0 and lost to third-ranked Nebraska 25-9. 
"Missouri will be our first home dual meet," stated McCann. "I would rate it as a toss-up because we were even with them in too many matches last year -we split the last two [190-pound and Heavyweight]. They have improved since last year. They looked very good at Las Vegas, and they had a good dual meet with Nebraska. It should be an interesting match

because it could come down to the last two matches if it is close." 
Steve King (190) and Chuck Weaver (Heavyweight) are the wrestlers of choice for Notre Dame at the final two positions. 
McCann, meanwhile, asked for a show of fan support for the first home match of the season. 
"We're making progress," said McCann. "It is important that people take interest in us. We are a young team and we need lots of help to develop."
