Last-minute factors could decide close race 

By MICHAEL BUSK 
News Writer 
Despite the bold predictions of some political prognosticators, today's presidential election is simply too close to call, according to some of Notre Dame's special­ists in American politics. 
"I think no one knows what's going on, and all the people try­ing to predict what's going to happen are grasping at straws ... There arP too many close states in the election. It's just to dose to call," said political science pro­fessor Benjamin Radeliff.

Notre Dame professors say voter turnout in swing states could be key 
from the University of Chicago, said at least one of the normal rules does not apply this year. 
"In general, -the best predictor for re-election is the state of the economy ... But foreign policy changes the decision calculus for so many voters this year," she said. "I don't think the economy is the right predictor for this year's election." 
With such a dose and unpre­dictable race, last-minute factors may come into play, Notre Dame experts said. 
In past presidential elections, some registered voters on the West Coast have stayed away from the polls if they saw one candidate winning heavily on the

Nusair gives presentation on Iraq 
By MEGAN O'NEIL News Writer 
Saint Mary's Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership Fellow Isis Nusair made a presentation Monday afternoon titled "The Iraq War and A.bu-Gheib," discussing the gendered and racialized nature of the U.S. invasions in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
According to Nusair, there is a long history of religious and military tension between the Muslim world and the Western world. 
"It's like a strand of history 1,000 years old, and it is inter­esting when it comes out and why," Nusair said. "I think if is important to understand the political dynamics of what is happening now to go back in history . . . and understand that the Middle East has been domi­nated for a very long time by various powers." 
Since the attacks of Sept. 11, Nusair argued, the age-old rivalry between Islam and Christianity has re-surfaced. According to Nusair, the anti­Muslim sentiment deeply root­ed in Western culture can be seen in everything -from everyday vocabulary to the mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq. 
She gave her audience the example of President Bush ini­tially referring to the war on terrorism as a "crusade." 
"If you look back in history you will see the word 'crusade' is very significant," Nusair said. 
In fact, Nusair said, the fed­eral government continued to produce very mixed speeches about Muslims and Islam in the months following the attacks, even after the poor wording was pointed out. The clash of cultures was constantly repre­sented in the media as "us against them," "light versus dark" and "good against evil," she said. 
"They tried to be inclusive but on the other hand it pro­gressed to the worse, especially in preparation for the war in Iraq," Nusair said. 
The implicative language has been normalized in western vocabulary, she said, and has

"Networks have since stopped reporting early exit poll data ... That information isn't made pub­lic," he said. "The big question is going to be who's going to vote, and the last-minute decisions that come into play are much more prominent." 
The recent brainstorm that has been drenching the Midwest might well affect such last minute decisions, Hadclilf said, especially

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Students discuss sale of basketball tickets 

By AMANDA MICHAELS Associate News Editor 

The Council of Representatives discussed a variety of possible solutions to issues stemming from the recent men's basketball ticket sale at Monday's meeting. 
Student body president Adam Istvan opened debate by estab­lishing that after hundreds of students were left without bas­ketball tickets after last year's sale, he, student body vice presi­dent Karla Bell and Siegfried senator James Leito met with director of ticketing and market­ing James Fraleigh to discuss concerns with the process. 
"[The athletic department's] primary concern is the fact that only an average of 2,000 of the 3,000 students who buy tickets attend the games," Istvan said. "So they want to know why they should expand the section if stu­dents don't come as it is." 
Istvan noted, however, that the Athletic Department instituted the new policy of allowing stu­dents to use individual tickets from other booklets and their own IDs to get into games in hopes of increasing attendance. 
Leito -not a COR member, but invited to sit in on discussion because of his involvement in the matter -said that there were two major problems with the ticket distribution process. One was that the 200 tickets allotted to Saint Mary's and Holy Cross students should be going to those Notre Dame students not able to secure tickets, and

Take a cue

Presidential campaigns bring with them a constant barrage of media, whether in the form of writ­ten articles, television ads, bumper stickers or news reports. With Election Day finally here, I sat Molly Griffin and thought about what I

bered from the 
past few months 
of campaigning. I suddenly realized 
that the bulk of everything I could 
recall came from either watching 
"The Daily Show" or reading "The 
Onion." Once I realized that "The 
Daily Show" was the unintentional 
source of most of my political 
knowlndge, I rnally began to won­
der about myself'. Was I just one of 
the "stonnd slackers,'' as Bill 
O'Heilly called "The Daily Show" 
viewers, who watched the show 
and then voted'! Was I really that 
politically irresponsibiP'! 
I pondered this thought for a long time. I wondered if I had watched Fox News, CNN. MSNBC or any of tho myriad news networks avail­able to me whether or not I would have been morn up-to-datn on issuns or morn certain about where to cast my vote. Every time I sat down t.o watch something, I would !war that this chanrwl had a liberal slant. this one had a conservative bias and so on. As an extreme rnodnratP, wlwre could I turn to for nnws with t.lw lt~ast bias possible'! 
Tlwn l had an epiphany. What nnsurns a lack of bias better than romedy'! Conwdians will discuss anything as long as it will get a laugh. and tlwir only bias is whnthnr or not something is funny. Cornndy often comes from pointing out tlw ironies and inconsistencies of our lives. which is a particularly eiToetive means of not only gener­ating a laugh during tho election season. but also revealing the real issues and ideas within a cam­paign. 
In the particularly confusing and convoluted media surrounding the Presidential election, watching Jon Stewart call evnry candidate, rngardless of party, on their errors was refreshing. Heading "The Onion's" "coverage" of the election, which mercilessly mocks both can­didatns. their positions on issues and things they have said equally, in a way that makes you laugh and think at the same time. 
I personally bdieve that politics as a whole could take a cue from comedians. Not to say that any major issues should be taken light­ly, but sometimes things are treat­ed wit.h almost absurd seriousness. It's okay to make a joke, and in the end, I think comedy keeps everyone more honest and makes over­whelming things a little more man­agnabln.

Saint Mary's students discuss food services 
By KELLY MEEHAN News Writer 

During the past semester, many Saint Mary's students have expressed concerns and questions regarding the College's food services. At Monday's Board of Governance meeting, Noble Family Dining Hall general manager Berry Bowles spoke to address these issues and concerns regarding the policies and food processing. 
Bowles gave a general overview of the pricing and the reasoning behind the meal plan options. He explained to the Board that he works for the Sodexho food company, which services many other colleges and the military. 
"I always have an open door policy and am interested in serv­ing you, the students. It is important that you let me know what you want," said Bowles. 
The founder of the new com­petitive volleyball club, Angelica Pivarunas, asked the board for co-sponsorship so that the club may travel to tournaments. The club, Volleybelles, will compete in volleyball tournaments at var-· ious colleges, including an upcoming tournament at Miami University in Ohio. The board approved giving the Volleybelles $700.

Professor publishes new book 
Special to the Observer 

A new book co-edited by University of Notre Dame political scientist Guillermo O'Donnell presents theories on how to define the quality of a democracy and the methodology for implement­ing a "citizen audit" of dem­ocratic governments. 
Published by Notre Dame Press, "The Quality of Democracy" explores a growing concern among poli­cy experts and academics over the widely varying degrees of effectiveness of new democratic regimes, particularly in Latin 
~America. It combines O'Donnell's theoretical study of how to determine quality in a democracy with analysis of data collected in an audit of Costa Rican citizens on the quality of democracy in their nation. O'Donnell, Costa Rican researcher Jorge Vargas Cullell and Argentinean political scien­tist Osvaldo M. Iazzetta co­edited the volume, which includes scholarly reflections from Notre Dame faculty members Juan Mendez and Michael Coppedge and 12 others.

Six kidnapped in Baghdad 
BAGHDAD, Iraq -Militants kidnapped an American, a Nepalese and four Iraqi guards in a bloody assault on their office in the capi­tal Monday, and gunmen assassinated Baghdad's deputy governor in a drive-by shooting, new violence that came as voter registration began for vital January elections. 
West of the capital, U.S. troops clashed with Sunni insurgents, and American artillery pounded suspected insurgent positions in Fallujah, witnesses said. 
U.S. forces are gearing up for a major offensive against Fallujah, the strongest bas­tion of Sunni insurgents. The order to launch what would likely be a bloody assault must come from Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, who warned Sunday that his patience with negoti­atipns was thinning. 
Ukraine election ends in runoff 
KIEV, Ukraine-Ukraine's furiously contest­ed presidential election ended in a dead heat Monday, forcing a runoff between a pro­Russian candidate and his reformist chal­lenger. Thousands of demonstrators in west­ern Ukraine alleged fraud, and international monitors said the country failed the test of democracy. 
The n,moff, set for Nov. 21, prolongs a cam­paign that has been overshadowed by worries over irregularities. The vote is seen as key to whether the former Soviet republic moves closer to the West or to Hussia. The winner will succeed outgoing President Leonid Kuchma, who clamped down on opposition during his rule. 
The United States had warned it may take punitive action if the voting was marred by irrngularities. Ukraine, which has a brigade of troops in Iraq, has been one of the top recipi­ents of U.S. aid.

Navy Seal reports n1istreatn1ent 
Associated Press 
SAN Dl EGO -The CIA 
interrogated and roughed up 
Iraqi prisoners in a "romper 
room" where a handcuffed 
and hooded terror suspect 
was kicked, slapped and 
punched shortly before he 
died last year at the Abu 
Ghraib prison, a Navy SEAL 
testified Monday. 
Blood was visible on the 
hood worn by the prisoner, 
Manadel al-Jamadi, as he 
was led into the interroga­
tion room at Baghdad 
International Airport in 
November 2003, the Navy 
commando said at a military 
pretrial hearing for another 
SEAL accused of abusing 
Iraqi prisoners. 
Testifying under a grant of 
immunity, the witness, iden­
tified only by his rank as a 
hospital corpsman, said he 
kicked al-.Jamadi several 
times, slapped him in the 
back of the head and 
punchnd him. Five or six 
other CIA personnel in tlw 
room laid their hands on the 
prisoner, he said. but he did 
not provide details. 
Sometime later, Al-Jamadi was found dead in a shower room lnss than an hour after two CIA personnnl brought him into Abu (;hraib as a so­called "ghost detainee," according to Army Maj. Gen. George H. Fay's report on the notorious prison. Such detainens wern not listed in the normal roster of military prisoners. 
Fay's report said al-Jamadi dind of a blot clot in the hnad likely due to injurins suffered al'ter being detained. Thn military pathologist's report listed thn cause of dnath as blunt force trauma 'complicated by hampered breathing. 
A CIA spokeswoman declined to comment on the hearing, but noted that the agency is conducting its own investigation into the CIA's involvement in prisoner detentions and interroga­tions in Iraq. 
The testimony about the CIA's role came during a hearing for an aviation boatswain's mate who is accused of punching al­Jamadi and posing in humil­iating photos with the pris­oner. The boatswain's mate, a 14-year Navy veteran, allegndly twisted othnr pris­oners' tosticlns and struck a prisoner in the buttocks with a wooden board. 
An Article 32 hearing, the military equivalent of a eivil­ian grand jury, was held to determine whether the boatswain's mate should be court-martialed. 
The hearing coneluded Monday. An investigating ofTicer will recommend what chargos, if any, the boatswain's mate should face. 
The accused SEAL, who rnceivod tho Purpln Heart for wounds sufTPred in Iraq, could gnt up to 11 years in prison if convicted.

Market reconsiders biodiesel 
CHELSEA, Mass. -Few have anything good to say about this year's run-up in oil prices. They do, though, at World Energy Alternatives, a biodiesel company with a shiny antique Gulf Oil pump in the lobby -a hint that petroleum's proudest days may have passed. 
Soaring petroleum prices have narrowed the price gap between conventional oil-based diesel and more expensive biodiesel made from American soybean oil. 
"We're actually having a bit of a renaissance with people whom we tried to get excited two, three, four years ago," said Gene Gebolys, pres­ident of World Energy Alternatives, in Chelsea. "They're picking up the phone again and say­ing, 'Hey, we think this makes sense now."' 
The escalation in petroleum prices has deliv­ered the most favorable marketing moment for biodiesel and other alternative energy sources in 25 years. It has bestowed an immediate windfall on some companies and helped to assure the place of alternatives in the future energy mix. 
Southwest expands to Chicago 
DALLAS -Southwest Airlines Co. plans to add 16 nonstop flights early next year from Chicago's Midway Airport, the prime hub of its chief rival is ATA Airlines, whose parent filed for bankruptcy protection last week. 
Southwest said Monday the new flights would go to 13 cities that it already serves from Midway, including Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Philadelphia. 
Chief executive Gary Kelly told reporters last week that expansion at Midway was Southwest's top priority. Chicago is Southwest's fourth-largest operation, with 145 daily nonstop departures. 
Dallas-based Southwest said it could begin the new flights in the first quarter of 2005 without adding to its 19 gates at Midway. The service could be provided with some of the 29 new Boeing 737 jets that Southwest plans to add next year. 
Indianapolis-based ATA Holdings Corp., par­ent of ATA Airlines, filed for bankruptcy pro­tection last week and sold airport landing slots and other assets to rival AirTran Airways, a division of AirTran Holdings Inc. 


Oil giant moves to block strike 
Royal Dutch/Shell opens court action to safeguard Nigerian oil exports 
Associated Press 

LAGOS, Nigeria -Oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group opened a court action Monday to try to block a strike targeting oil exports in the world's No. 7 crude exporter, but failed in a first-round bid to block wildcat strikes or other union action in the meantime. 
The case comes one day after Nigeria's unions called the Nov. 16 strike over rising fuel prices here, and promised to tar­get Shell the top multina­tional in Nigeria as an "enemy" of the people for taking legal action. 
The price of crude vault­ed above the $52 mark Monday on the news. At midmorning in Europe, December crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was trading electronically at $52.24 a barrel up 48 cents from its Friday closing. 
Federal Justice Abdullahi Mustapha in the commer­cial capital, Lagos, held only a brief hearing Monday on Shell's attempt to block the strike, post­poning the case until Nov. 18.

Rehnquist undergoing treabnent for cancer 

Associated Press 
WASIIIN<;TON -Chief Justiee William II. Behnquist rnvealed Monday that he is undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment for thyroid cancer, signs he has a grave form of the disease and probably will not rnturn to tlw bench soon. 
The election PVf~ disdosurn by the 80-year-old justice under­scores the near cPrtainty that the next president will make at least one appointment to the Supremo Court and probably morn. 
Hchnquist had planned to join his colleagues when they returned to hear arguments Monday after a two-week break. Instead, he issued a statement from homo about the treatment he's receiving. It said he plans to work from home and made no mention of leaving the court. 
The chief justiee did not dis­dose what typo of thyroid cancer he has, how far it has pro­grossed or t.he prognosis. 
Dr. Ann M. Gillenwater of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Ilouston said the combination of chemotherapy and radiation is the usual treatment for anaplas­tic thyroid cancer, a fast-growing form that can kill quickly. 
About HO pnrcent of people with that type of cam~er die with­in a year, even with treatment, according to the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy. 
"Unfortunately, it rarely responds very well, and this is just a holding action for most patients," said Dr. IIerman Kattlove of the American Cancer Sodety. 

Hehnquist's statement was a more somber announcement than the one a week ago, when he lirst made public that he had been hospitalized for cancer treatment but said he planned to be back at work in a week. 
"Aceording to my doctors, my plan to return to the ollice today was too optimistic," said Hehnquist, who spent a week in the hospital. "While at home, I am working on court matters; including opinions for cases already argued. I am, and will, continue to be in close contact with my colleagues, my law clerks and members of the Supreme Court staff." 
News of Hehnquist's cancer has energized conservative and liberal groups, which have tried to draw voters' attention to the court's delicate balance on issues like abortion, allirmative action and the death penalty. 
The spotlight would have been heightened in the final week of the campaign if Rehnquist had been more forthcoming about his condition, said Dennis Hutchinson, a Supreme Court expert at the University of Chicago Law School. 
"lie doesn't want to be a fac­tor" in the election, Hutchinson said. "The one thing all mem­bers of the court hate is the assumption that they are parti­s_an .?r sensitive to partisan poli­tics.

Educators predict future lavvsuits 
No Child Left Behind Act expected to be targeted to avoid sanctions 
Associated Press 
THERMAL, Calif. -The 
federal No Child Left Behind 
Act threatens costly penalties 
for schools deemed failing to 
meet academic standards. In 
response, some educators 
expect a series of lawsuits 
aimed at avoiding the sanc­
tions. 
Since President Bush signed 
the sweeping education 
reforms in 2002, the ·law has 
drawn criticism from educa­
tors debating its strict per­
formance and test require­
ments. The act requires all 
students to be proficient in 
reading, writing and math by 
2014. . 
Parents of children in some failing schools can demand transfers to better campuses. Over the next four years, ·schools must offer tutoring services, administrators and 
teachers can be fired, states can take over districts, and federal funds can be with­held. 
Coachella Valley Unified School District -which includes Oasis Elementary School -could be among the nation's !irst to challenge the law. The school board is con­sidering suing federal and state governments, claiming the distri-ct is being held to unreachable goals. 
"Coachella is the tip of the iceberg," John Perez, presi­dent of United Teachers Los Angeles, said, adding that the law "doesn't take into account things it needs to." 
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, students at more than 27,500 schools nation­wide -almost 31 percent of all U.S. public schools -are failing at math and reading. 
Last December, Heading School District in Pennsylvania sued over its low performance rating, arguing its Spanish-speaking students couldn't read the tests. About two-thirds o(the district's 16,000 students are Hispanic; 15 percent have limited English proficiency. 
But, judges ruled that test­ing in a student's native lan­guage is not mandatory, only required "to the extnnt that it is practicable to do so." The district plans to appeal. 
"It's a wonderful title, No Child Left Behind. Who could ever disagree with that?" said Hichard Guida, a lawyer for the Heading district. "But kids are all different and, unfortu­nately, this calls for a cookie­cutter approach to education that doesn't take difference into account. Some kids will be left behind." 


Vaccine gives long-term protection 
Tests reveal progress in cervical cancer prevention drugs 
Associated Press 
·WASHINGTON -Efforts to develop the world's first vac­cine to prevent cervical cancer took a key step forward Monday with test results sug­gesting that it can provide long-lasting protection. 
Four years after getting the vaccine, 94 percent of women were protected from infection with the virus that causes most cervical cancers and none had developed worrisome precan­cerous conditions, a study showed. 
"We're thrilled about these results. The immune responses seem to be really long-lasting," said Dr. Eliav Barr, who leads development of the vaccine for Merck & Co. The company plans to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval next year for an expanded ver­sion of the vaccine that also could be used to prevent geni­tal warts in both women and men. 
The new study was funded by Merck and led by University of Washington researchers who presented results Monday at a meeting of the American Society forMicrobiology. 
"They showed clear effective­ness," said Dr. Scott Hammer, a Columbia University infectious disease expert who reviewed the work but has no ties to Merck or the study. "This is a very important issue for women's health around the world." 
If the vaccine makes it to market, it would be the second developed to prevent cancer. The hepatitis B vaccine has dramatically reduced the num­ber of infeetions that progress to liver cancer. 
Cervical cancer strikes near­ly half a million women world­wide each year and kills about half. In the United States, about 15,000 women get it and about 5,000 die. 
Virtually all cases are caused by infection with human papil­loma virus, or HPV, which is spread through sex. One strain, HPV-16, accounts for about half of all cervical can­cers. 
A previous study showed that 1-IPV-16 infections were com­pletely prevented in 768 women who had received tlw Merck vaccine 18 months ear­lier. None developed precan­cerous conditions either. 
The new study followed 755 of these women for four years after vaccination. IIPV-16 infections had taken hold in seven; none developed precan­cers. In a comparison group.of 750 women who received dummy shots, infections took hold in 111 and precancers formed in 12. 
Even though protection had waned for a small number of women in the study, the vac­cine's effectiveness was still very high, said Dr. Douglas Lowy, a National Cancer Institute scientist who invented the vaccine. The government gave rights to develop it to two companies -Merck and GlaxoSmithKline and Merck's work is a little farther along, Lowy said. 
"Revaccination might be advisable at some point," but it will take more study to know whether that is necessary or would improve effectiveness, he said. 
Women in the study were ages 16 to 23 when they received the vaccine, given in three doses over six months.

lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
For the second year in a row, many students are being denied the oppor­tunity to attend men's home basketball games. While I concede the current system regarding student season tick­ets is good in theory, it has several shortcomings in practice. Through student government, I and others have met with various officials from the athletic department to try to improve this problem, but unfortunately only small changes have been made (as I am beginning to notice is the norm at this University). From my experience there are several problems with the current situation that students and the athletic department need to realize and solve. 
First, Notre Dame students are not given enough opportunities to obtain tickets. Holy Cross and St. Mary's, which receive 50 and 150 tickets respectively, should not be given tick­ets. While, I am all for other local col­leges attending Notre Dame events (like football games and concerts where everyone gets tickets), Notre Dame students should be given first priority for tickets, and then once the demand of Notre Dame students' is met, students of' other colleges should be given the opportunity to attend. 
In addition, the ticket ol'fice should wait to sell individual game tickets until after student season tickets have been sold. This year the individual tickets went on sale this past Tuesday and already tickets to the Connecticut and UCLA games are sold out. This practice prevents students who do not get season tickets from purchasing individual tickets to the big games for which they will most likely have trou­ble finding unused student tickets. 
Second, it is too easy for the casual fan to obtain tickets. Students should only be allowed to bring two or three IDs to the ticket sale instead of six. Under the current system, many stu­dents who don't really care much about the games and go mainly for social purposes can easily obtain tick­ets by sending one of their friends to 

Put student participation before the dollar 
It is with great sadness and some anger 1 read the story about the sale of men's basketball tickets being limited to 3000 students. llow absurd is that? When did students become second-dass citizens at our school? Being an alumnus of the '75 class, I can speak directly as to the difference real fans (i.e. students) can add to the team. I was there when students wouldn't give up on the team when they battled UCLA to break the 88 game streak. Wasn't it the student body that was voted the most valuable player in the upset win over No. 1 San Francisco? lsn 't that the only time that has ever happened? 
Ask the players from those teams how valuable students were to those victories. Have we become like all other schools that put student participation and support after the almighty dollar. Students are the school and all of them that desire to purchaso tickets should be allowed to do so. During the '70s, Digger Phelps understood how mueh stu­dont support meant to the team's success. Why doesn't the administration? 
The arena seats 11,500. That would mean that 8,500 seats are "filled" with fans who do not have as much at stake as the students. How does that show spirit? WP have all witnessed the non-students sit on their hands when the game is not going well. That is when the team needs the support the most. Let's give those players as much help as possible. At least 50 percent of the seats should be reserved for our stud<mts. If not, why not'?

lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
It is still just a game 

I love Notre Dame football as much as the next person on !!w.'·ram­pus. I have longed to attend Notre Dame my entire life, and I'cim be about as obnoxious as they come when talking football to those whom haven't yet been converted to Irish super-fans. Despite this fanaticism, as some would call it, I remember one important thing: it is still just a game. 
Why do I point this out, you ask? The answer is simply that some stu­dents seem to forget this fact. The following situation happens at every Notre Dame game: A<> most fans cheer wildly for the Irish defense, a cry rings out above the rest, "Injure him!" or "Make sure he never plays again!" Even worse, in that moment when play has stopped and an injured opponent lies on the field, "Yeah, he's hurt!" Are fans really asking our team to attempt to seriously injure the opposing players? 
A<> loyal and hard core as many of us are about Irish football, there is no excuse fi:Jr wishing "real world" harm on opponents. Football is a game, and while we may despise our opponents as players, we are called to respect them as children of God. You may pass this off as "just a part of the game" or say, "I don't really mean it," but this does not make it any more excusable. How would that injured player's mother feel ifshe were to hear someone yelling such things? Would you want to hear such things yelled about your best friend as he lays in agony, knowing that this injury may have forever changed his life? Next time you start to raise your voice in celebration of the sight of an opponent laying motionless on the field, think again about the person that is underneath the helmet and the pads, the person that may be in serious danger as a result of that hit. God cares about his well-being, and we are called to do the same.

Changes are necessary to tnake Notre Datne football great 
I'm writing this letter because I have finally 'had it' with Notre Dame football. I fully expect­ed the Irish to beat Boston College and beat them handily. On paper, Notre Dame was and should be the better team. At halftime, even with the score 20-7 in our favor, I like everyone else felt it should have been a much larger deficit for Boston College with all of the oppor­tunities they gave us to blow the game wide open. We all know how it worked out. Once again, our football team lost a game that we should not have lost for the third time this sea­son. The Brigham Young University loss I looked past after the great victory against Michigan. I just believed the team overlooked them in preparation for the revenge match. I had a very difficult time swallowing the Purdue loss. I did not believe they had an athletic advantage over us going into the game. Yes, they had a senior quarterback who was playing well. But, we had shown that we could beat a good team at home with our victory over the University of Michigan. Of course, Purdue has now lost two home games, one of which to a team we beat. And the Boston College loss makes me absolutely sick for so many reasons, they are innumerable. 
This letter is not meant to slander Coach Willingham and his staff. I believe he is a great representative of the University. The players have shown great class in victory and defeat. Unfortunately, the numbers don't lie: Coach Willingham has lost seven games by 25 or more points. He is 1-2 against Purdue, 0-3 against Boston College, and 0-2 against the University of Southern California with another loss extremely likely in a few weeks. I could go on with more statistics to show how poor his record is compared to previous Notre Dame coaches through three seasons. I fully expected this team to progress in his third season, espe­cially after the Michigan victory. (That was the first time we looked like Notre Dame since the victory against Florida State University two years ago.) Unfortunately, they have done the exact opposite. 
For me, it is very simple: I want to be Notre Dame again on the football field. I want to win games we are expected to win. I want to win games we aren't expected to win. I want to make halftime adjustments. I want our team to be the aggressor. Heck, I wouldn't mind the occasional tunnel fight like we had against Miami in '88 and USC in '89. I want us to show teams that we do not lose in Rockne's House. I want teams to be intimidated again when they are at Notre Dame Stadium. And I want the Notre Dame team to be more focused when they hit the road because they have to be in order to win. 
Unfortunately, I don't believe these things that I want to happen will happen under the current regime. It is not a matter of talent any more. We have a few horses. We don't have the trainers. The ongoing experiment the University has run the last 11 years to do things "right" in the football program, whatev­er this might mean, has not worked. "Right" to me is when the Notrf:J Dame football program is as large and encompassing as the University itself. We need a coaching staff that brings us back to this level, and an administration that embraces this ideal. Maybe then, I will be able to stomach the occasional loss to a Big Ten team, or worse, Boston College. 
I am tired of the bookstore having to sell paraphernalia advertising the "Glory Days" because they don't have anything to sell with respect to the present-day program.

I love the Red Sox 
I love the Hed Sox so much it's not even funny. If Oct. 27 became the new Christmas for New England, then the day after surely must be New Year's Day -it became a fresh start for gen-· erations of millions of Hed Sox hopefuls. Andrew Bauld The Hed Sox won the World Series. No mat­Tufts ter how many times I University say it, hear it, read it, Daily. could it be true? It is surreal, dream-like; only Tim McCarver doesn't usually call my dreams, and the Red Sox are never champions when I wake up. 
People keep saying it is going to be different now, no more loveable losers and no more "curse" to secretly revel complaining about. People snidely sneer that there is no more reason for us to care. No reason to care? If I did­n't care, would I be sitting here, not even 24-hours since the Greatest Victory in Sports History, watching reruns of this season's extra inning games on NESN? Would I still be get­ting chills watching Big Papi hit that Easter day game winning home run in the 12th or be clapping as Timlin gets the last out in a mid-season Yankees game? I am a Red Sox fan. If it weren't repetitive, I would say I bleed red­but I do. 
Standing in line for over two hours the other day outside Fenway, waiting just to get a glimpse of the exorbitantly priced World Series memorabilia that waited inside, there was only one way to describe the mood at the Fen. It was the same feeling that raced through my mind when 27 outs were finally and officially recorded, it was the 
same feeling that washed over the face 
of every Red Sox fan I hugged that 
wonderful night, it was the same 
feeling that has draped 
itself over Boston like a 
blanket we've been 
missing for far too 
long. Happiness: 
genuine, pure,

ness. No

those fans 
already looking 
forward to opening 
day against the Evil 
Empire, and you'll get your 
answer. Bill Buckner, Bucky Dent, Bob Gibson, Bambino: like Tom Petty sang, "don't come around here no more." No 
more curse; we can now talk about the 
cure of 2004. Fifty years from now 
we'll be telling our grandchildren about the exploits of these new inductees to that exclusive club of Boston legend. Generations from now the renown of Schilling and Ortiz, Martinez and Ramirez, will forever be remi­nisced and adored by the city of Boston­while the 
likes of Bellhorn and Kapler and Roberts 
will remain with us 
diehards until the day we die. I never believed in the curse, but look­ing up at a blood red moon that night made me believe in destiny. I cannot help but think of 
the countless men who have graced the ranks of the Red Sox and have come as close as many of us thought would ever be possible. 1946, 1967, 1975, 1986 ... Ted Williams, Johnny Pesky, Jim Lonborg, Jim Rice, Carl Yastrzemski, Carlton Fisk, Luis Tiant, Bill Lee, Wade Boggs, Roger Clemens, even Bill Buckner. Those dates and those names are each syn­onymous with greatness and misery ­scorn and admiration for countless Red Sox fans -but they can all take comfort now, because this victory was far too important to be constrained for this one team and this one generation of fans. This was for everyone. 

It just hit me. For the umpteenth (but certainly not the final) time, the local news is showing the video of that infamous last out rolling between the unsure feet of Bill Buckner. In the past, I've felt physically sick, but not this time. For once I smiled, because the Boston Red Sox are the greatest team in baseball, and it is not only we loyal fans who know it. 
I cannot wait for spring training and Opening Day, waking up on that glori­ous morning in early spring when Sox tickets go on sale. Have things changed? Of course they have. The Boston Red Sox are World Series Champions -but I am cheering again watching NESN run the highlight reel of Mark Bellhorn score the tying run in the bottom of the ninth against the Royals. It goes without saying, but I love the Red Sox.

based on killing your rivals for respect and money, cou­pled with strong language and sexual content make this game very deserving of its .Mature rating.

But Mortal Kombat: Deception is prob­ably the best, most quirky Mortal Kombat game yet.

The empha­sis this time appears to be on the lesser eharacters of the previous games, such knowledge of the previous GTA games and all their infamy, there are still some weaknesses in this game to con­sider. The big one on the list is frame rate, which is just another sign of the aging P52 technology. The orange tinge that the game carries in its visual effects is also noticeable enough to annoy many gamers.

Although there already have been several Lord of the Rings games in release, these games only allowed the player to control a single hero while non-playable characters assisted.

NFL 

New York trounces Miami 

Associated Press 
liAST HUTIIEHFOHI>, N.J. ­The New York Jets gave the Miami Dolphins a little of Curtis Martin, and a little of LaMont Jordan. 
They made a perfect combi­nation. The running back duo helped the Jets embarrass the hapless Dolphins, sending their defense. to a new low in a 41-14 rout Monday night. Martin and Jordan naeh ran for 1 15 yards and a score, and the 275 yards the Jets rcu~ked up on tht1 ground arn the most in the NFL this season. 
"We always talk about being a 1-2 puneh," Martin said. "And you eould sen that from us tonight." 
Tho last tirnn tho teams met on Monday night. tho Jets prasod a 2:{-point. fourth-quar­tnr deficit for a 40-37 overtime win in 2000 in what is known as tho "Monday Night Miracle." 
Thorn was no chance of a cornebaek this time around. The Jots (6-1) scored 34 straight points, stilling the inef­f'eetivn Dolphins (l-7l on oiTensc and humiliating the proud Miami dnfense, which entered the ganw ranked fourth in the NFL.

being lifted for Quincy Carter in the fourth quarter. The Jets fin­ished with 4 72 yards of total ofl'ense. 
"They gave us an old-fash­ioned beating," Dolphins line­backer Junior Seau said. "I tip my hat to them, for not only what they did against us but the whole year." 
New York entered the game after its first loss of the season, 13-7 to New England last week­end, but turned in its most com­plete performance of the year. Jets coach Iierman Edwards knew it was important to keep pace with the Patriots and Steelers, both 6-1 in the AFC. 
"If you can keep this bottled up, we have a chance to be a pretty good football team," Edwards said. 
The last time the Jets had two 100-yard rushers in a game was Sept. 28, 1975, when John Higgins ran for 145 yards and Carl Garwtt had 135 in a 30-24 win over Kansas City. Miami last allowed two 1 00-yard rush­ers on Oct. 21), 1989, at BufTalo, when Thurman Thomas had 148 yards and Larry Kinnebrew added 121. 
Martin, 31, has had a renais­sance in his lOth NFL season. lie came into the game second in the league in rushing, while carrying the Jets burden on the ground. 
That all changed against the Dolphins. Edwards made it a point to use both backs and wear down the Dolphins defense in the second half. Martin finished with 19 carries and Jordan had 14. 
"It feels good any time you have a 100-yard rusher and we had two," Jets left tackle Kareem McKenzie said. "How often does that happen'? That's something you can tell to your grandkids." 
The Jets defense harassed Jay Fiedler the entire game, sacking the Dolphins quarter­back four times and picking him off twice. Miami got a meaningless score as the game ended, when Fiedler threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Derrius Thompson. Fiedler fin­ished 20-of-41 for 218 yards. 
"When you don't run the foot­ball and you don't stop the run, you don't win," Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt said. "No one understands that more than I do because that's how we've won around here." 
The complete humiliation of the Miami defense was perhaps the most confounding part of the game. 
Pennington connected on one big passing play after another, repeatedly taking advantage of cornerbacks Sam Madison and Patrick Surtain. 
Moss healing slovv 1 y 
Associated Press 
·EDEN PHAIHIE, Minn. ­Minnesota's Handy Moss might miss his first career game because of a lingering right hamstring strain that hasn't gotten worse -but isn't getting a whole lot better. 
The Vikings will decide later this week whether or not they should rest their All-Pro receiver on Monday night at Indianapolis. 
Since being hurt before half­time of Minnesota's game at New Orleans on Oct. 17, Moss has been limited to just 11 snaps over the last 10 quar­ters. Though he leads the team with eight touchdown catches and his consecutive games streak remains alive at 
103. he's gone the last two games without a reception. 
"Can we get him back at full speed sooner if we just sit him'?" coach Mike Tice said. "Or is he going to be back at full speed the same length of time if we just play him in a limited role -based on the fact that in two weeks he did­n't take a step back'?" 
"So have to monitor that, as the week goes on. We have to do what's best for the team to achieve our goals, which are to win the division and win the world championship. We can't do what's best for a streak;, or anything of that nature. 

Players were given Monday oil, with the extra day ahead to prepare for the Colts. 
Moss was thrown to once in Sunday's 34-13 loss to the New York Giants, and he clearly wasn't able to run hard whenever he went down­field. The Vikings planned to use him frequently inside their opponent's 20-yard line, but the offense sputtered so badly that red zone opportuni­ties were scarce. 
Moss' hamstring began to tighten in the second quarter from standing around so much, and Tice decided to pull him out at halftime. 
Moss told Tice on Sunday night that he was feeling bet­ter, so the seventh-year star will begin the week listed as questionable on the injury report. 
Marcus Robinson, who led the Vikings with 91 yards receiving against the Giants and is second on the team with six touchdowns, sprained his left foot and will be listed as probable. 
"That puts us in a bind," Tice said, indicating Minn esota would scan the waiver wire this week for wide receiver depth. 


Favre set to play 
Packers QB to keep starting streak alive 
Associated Press 
GHEEN BAY, Wis. -Brett Favre has a sprained thumb on his throwing hand, but it won't keep the Green Bay quarterback from making his next start, against Minnesota on Nov. 14. 
Favre, who has started an NFL -record 216 straight games at quarterback, had the team doctor check out the thumb, which he broke last season and reinjured Sunday in a 28-14 victory against the Washington Hedskins. 
"Brett sprained his thumb a little bit. It's not as significant as last time," coach Mike Sherman said Monday. "I don't anticipate the hand or the thumb being an issue for the Minnesota ga:me." 
The three-time league MVP injured his right hand against Dallas last week. 
Favre, who has a history of playing through injuries, did­n't practice last week until Friday. Now, he can rest some more as the Packers enter their bye week. 

"It seems like every year I say, 'The bye week couldn't come at a better time.' But physically, emotionally. it's coming at a good time," Favrn said. 
This season alone, Favre has played with a troublesome left shoulder, a concussion and a softball-sized bruise on his left hamstring, along with the sprained hand and thumb. He also has had to cope with the death of his brother-in-law and the breast cancer diagno­sis of his wife, Deanna, last month. 
Against the Hedskins, Favre led the Packers on three con­secutive scoring drives, then threw three interceptions before Green Bay held on. Sherman said Favre had trou­ble holding the ball well beeause of his injuries. 
"lie couldn't grip a ball real­ly until Friday," the coach said. "And even Friday I didn't get a great feeling that he was able to grip it and deliver it with the velocity that he's used to delivering it."

Isban has lead after 2 rounds in California 
Special to The Observer 
LA QUINTA, Calif. Sophomore Cole Isban fired a two-over par 146 on Monday and leads by two strokes head­ing into the third and final round of The Prestige at PGA WEST, which is being held in La Quinta, Calif., at the par-72, 7,156-yard Greg Norman Course at the famed PGA WEST  complex. Isban was one of only six golfers in 
the 84-man field to shoot par or better in either of Monday's two rounds, card­ing a 72 over the opening 18 holes 


before tack-lsban ing on a 74 in the afternoon session. 
In the team standings, Notre Dame is in 12th place after posting a two-round total of 57­over par 633 (311-322). The Irish had jumped into a tie for fourth place after the opening round, but slipped back in the field during the second circuit. Still, Notre Dame is not far behind some of the tourna­ment's higher-powered squads -17th-ranked BYU is only four strokes ahead of the Irish in 11th place, while No. 23 Oklahoma is 10 shots in front of Notre Dame in seventh place and No. 10 Tournament co-host UC Davis has a one-stroke lead over 16th-ranked UCLA going into today's final round. 
Isban's day got off to an 
inausptctous start as he bogeyed two of his first three holes. However, he quickly rebounded to reel off five birdies in his next 20 holes, with only a double bogey late in his first round marring the scorecard. When the day was done, Isban had collected seven birdies and seemingly tamed the monstrous course that rav­aged the field to the tune of a 
79.96 stroke average through two rounds. 
Brown shoots 71 in first round 
Stacy Brown carded a career­best one-under-par 71 in the first round of the Edwin Watts/Palmetto Intercollegiate on Monday to pace the Irish as they are tied for third heading into today's final day of compe­tition at the par 72, 5,911-yard Kiawah Island Oak Point Golf Course. The sophomore finds herself two shots in back of the leader and in a three-way tie for third. 
Campbell University and Louisville each posted a 10-over par 298 to sit atop the team leader board after Monday's play, which featured 27 -holes of play with only the first round of 18 being released. Notre Dame along with its central region­rival Michigan both carded 12­over par 300's to claim stake to third going into the final 36­holes. 
The Mustangs currently reside in eighth-place out of the 18-team field. 
Sophomore Noriko Nakazaki fired the best nine-hole total of the round for the Irish with a 33 on the front nine. 
Associated Press 
DENVER -Broncos safety John Lynch will be sidelined at least two weeks and perhaps for a month with a fractured tailbone. 
Signed as a free agent after Tampa Bay let him go, Lynch has been a steadying influence on the Denver defense. But the Broncos struggled in a 41-28 loss to Atlanta on Sunday and Lynch went down after being hit in the side by receiver Brian Finneran. 
Angry about the hit, Lynch walked toward the Atlanta huddle and started yelling at the Falcons before leaving tne game. 
Denver coach Mike Shanahan said the block appeared legal, "but it was one of those blindside shots that kind of catches you off-guard." 
Nick Ferguson will start for Lynch next Sunday against Houston and then the Broncos have a bye. Porcher retires from Lions 
Robert Porcher retired Monday, ending a 13-year career as Detroit's career leader in sacks. 
"I've thought about this day for a lot of the last three years," Porcher said. "We all think we can play forever, and I was no different, but now. the time has come to step aside." 
Porcher, who has 95 1/2 sacks, already had announced this would be his last season, but he ended his career early after being inactive for Detroit's first seven games. 
"These last seven weeks have been tough," he said. "I had always been proud of

Tailbone sidelines Lynch 
being part of the solution, not part of the problem." 
Panthers Morgan may be out 
The team is evaluating line­backer Dan Morgan to see if he suffered a concussion against the Seahawks. 
Morgan was plagued by postconcussion syndrome last year, missing five games and parts of four others. Once com­pletely healed, Morgan acknowledged he suffered dizziness and fatigue while try­ing to play. 
So the Panthers are taking it slow this time with Morgan, who left Sunday's loss in the Whalf. 
Coach John Fox said it's pos­sible Morgan might not play this week against Oakland. 
"You always err on the side of caution when you are deal­ing with a concussion," Fox said. 
Titans Hall has knee surgery 
Defensive end Carlos Hall had surgery on his right knee Monday after the Titans gave him a week of rest, hoping he would heal. 
Hall couldn't start Sunday in the Titans' 27-20 victory over Cincinnati and was replaced by rookie Travis LaBoy. 
"It still bothered him, so we just went in there and did a routine scope to just kind of clean it out. The doctor said there was nothing significant in there other·than wear and tear creating problems for him," coach Jeff Fisher said. 
Giants Warner optimistic 
Kurt Warner doesn't want to compare the Giants to some of the playoff and Super Bowl teams from his days. with the Rams. 
There are different players, coaches and teams, and Warner doesn't want to say too much with more than half a season to go. 
Nevertheless, Warner is excited about the possibilities for the Giants (5-2) after their stuiming 34-13 win in Minnesota on Sunday. 
"I still don't think we have played near our best football in all three phases in any game," Warner said Monday. "I think we have seen spurts of it. To play the way we have and to still be 5-2 despite all that, it's a good feeling." 
Offensively, Warner and the offense fixed its red zone prob­lem for at least a week. They scored touchdowns on four of five possessions inside the Minnesota 20. Bengals reeling after loss 
A 27-20 loss in Tennessee left Cincinnati (2-5), the NFL's most downtrodden franchise, stuck in last place in the AFC North, headed in the wrong direction. 
The loss wiped away a smidgen of hope sparked by a solid Monday night win over Denver, revealing the Bengals for what they are: a team that rises to the occasion only on rare occasions. 
The NFL's worst run defense was at it again Sunday, giving up 163 yards. A unit already missing middle linebacker Nate Webster struggled might­ily in its first game without lineman Tony Williams, out for the season with a broken ankle. 
Ravens survive without Lewis 
After going 1-1 during the two-game suspension of All­Pro running back Jamal Lewis, the Ravens are ready to make a legitimate move in pursuit of a playoff berth. 
Lewis served his punishment for violating the NFL substance abuse policy. During his absence, Baltimore handily beat the Bills before falling 15­10 on the road against the unbeaten Eagles. 
That left the Ravens (4-3) two games behind the surpris­ing Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC North. 
"Now we're going to go for­ward and see what we're going to make happen over the next few weeks," coach Brian Billick said Monday. "We clear­ly have to be better in order to re-establish ourselves as a team that has playoff and Super Bowl aspirations." 
Chester Taylor and Musa Smith filled in capably, totaling 100 yards rushing against the Bills and 103 versus Philadelphia, but neither can match the credentials of Lewis who last year ran for 2,066 yards.

Arizona picks new skipper 
Associated Press 

PIIOI(NIX-Wally Backman was the scrappy, intense second baseman for the World Series cham pion New York Mets 18 years ago. lin promises to bring that samn style to the Arizona Diamondbacks as their new manager. 
Backman, who took himself' out of' contention for the Mets managing job last week, was hired Monday to take over an Arizona team coming ofT one of the worst seasons in major league history. 
"My style is hard, aggressive baseball," Backman said. "If my brother is second baseman for the Los Angeles Dodgers and if it mans taking him out at sec­ond base, that's what I expect my players to do. That's the way we play the game." 
Backman, 45, was selected minor league manager of the year this season by The Sporting News after leading Class A Lancaster to the best record in the California League (86-54). 
"This is not a rebuilding pro­gram. I'm here to win. That's what l'vn always been about and that's what the Diamondbacks an~ about," Backman said. "And we will get back to the Diamondback ways of' .the past as soon as we possi­bly earl. We will make some

changes and this team will compete. That's one thing that every team that I've ever man­aged does." 
Backman, 45, was given a two-year contract with two team options. He was chosen over former Seattle manager Bob Melvin and Montreal Expos third base coach Manny Acta. 
Backman, an all-state wrestler as well as star baseball player at Aloha, Ore., High School, was a first-round draft pick of the Mots, the 16th selec­tion overall. He played 14 sea­sons in the major leagues, the first nine with the Mots, and finished with a .27 5 career average with 240 RBis and 117 steals. 
"He expects to win. We expect to win," general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said, "and his players will understand that from the first day of spring training." 
He takes over a franchise that dropped to 51-111 last season, the worst record in the history of the Diamondbacks who won . the World Series title in 2001. 

GM Hunsicker quits, Astros hire Purpura 
Associated Press 

HOUSTON -Tim Purpura 
has wanted to be a general 
manager for over a decade. 
lie never expected to get the 
job, at least not so soon and 
not in Houston. 

When Gerry Hunsicker 
resigned as GM of the Houston 
Astros on Monday, Purpura 
immediately assumed the 
position vacated by the man 
who was the architect of five 
playoiT teams in nine years. 

Purpura worked under 
Hunsicker in each of those 
seasons, never guessing that 
his boss would leave after one 
of the most successful stretch­
es in franchise history. 

"I have very large shoes to fill," said Purpura, who was Hunsicker's assistant and the team's director of player development. "Realistically, I .thought I'd have to go some­where else to have this kind of 
opportunity." 

Hunsicker, 53, resigned less 
than two weeks after the team 
came within one win of reach­
ing the World Series for the 
first time. lie plans to remain 
with the Astros as an adviser 
through next season. 

"I will look with pride at 
what we have accomplished," 
Hunsicker said. "We almost 
got there, and I know we are 
going to get there real soon." 

Hunsicker came to the Astros in 1995 from the New York Mets, where he was the No. 2 person in baseball oper­ations. lie previously worked with the Astros as traveling secretary, minor league pitch­ing coach, scout and assistant to the general manager. 
During his tenure, Hunsicker earned aeelaim for consistently keeping the Astros competitive despite 
. their budget constraints in a medium-sized market. Hunsicker's clubs won four NL Central Division titles and finished second three times, inducting this past season. lie might have done his best job this year, signing Andy Pettitte away from the New York Yankees and luring another Yankees starter, Roger Clemens, out of retirement to join his buddy. When the Astros went into a midseason slump, Hunsicker swung a trade for All-Star center fielder Carlos Beltran and fired manager .Jimy Williams. He turned to Phil Garner, who had been out of baseball for two years after spending 10 seasons manag­ing terrible teams in Milwaukee and Detroit. The move worked. Houston reeled ofl' 36 wins in the final 46 games to clinch the NL wild card.

Associated Press 

SEATTLE -Washington coach Keith Gilbertson will step down at the end of the season, ending a difficult two years as Rick Neuheisel's replacement. 
"Coach Gilbertson and I have talked for several weeks about the football program and we mutually agreed that it needs an immediate boost," Washington athletic direc­tor Todd Turner said in a statement Monday. "Keith will finish this season as our head coach and has agreed to assist me beyond that time to develop a strategy for reinvestment 
by our university in its football program." An afternoon news con­ference was scheduled. 
The Huskies lost 31-6 at Oregon on Saturday, drop­ping to 1-7 overall and 0-5 in the Pac-10. It's the worst season in 35 years for a school that shared the 1991 national title. 
The 56-year-old Gilbert­son, a Washington native, is 7-13 in his second sea­son at Washington. 
"I want to see this pro­gram succeed and get rolling again. Whatever I can do to help, I'll do," he said. "Sure I wish we had been more successful and won more games. But there was never a day I didn't enjoy coaching over the past two years. 
Turner said the search for Gilbertson's successor would begin immediately. 
Gilbertson took over the Huskies six weeks before the start of fall camp in 2003 under tough circum­stances. 
Neuheisel was fired in July 2003 for gambling on NCAA basketball, leaving then-athletic director Barbara Hedges little time or options for filling the job. 
Hedges said at the time that Gilbertson was chosen because he was the only member of the staff with head coaching experience. 
Gilbertson previously coached Idaho (1986-88) and California (1992-95) and is 55-48 overall in nine seasons as a head coach. 
The Huskies went 6-6 last season and 4-4 in the Pac-10, barely avoiding the school's first losing season since 1976. Washington lost at home to Nevada and was blown out by California and UCLA. 
The only win this season was over San Jose State, and Washington is winless in the Pac-1 0. The last time the Huskies went without a league victory was 1973, when they were 0-7 in the old Pac-8. 
IN BRIEF 

Sixers see.k to trade veteran 
forward Glenn Robinson 
PHILADELPHIA -The Philadelphia 76ers placed 11-year veteran Glenn Robinson on the injured list Monday with left ankle tendonitis and will try to trade the former No. 1 pick. 
Sixers general manager Billy King indicated that he and new coach Jim O'Brien had reached the conclusion that trading the 31-year-old forward would be the best thing for all parties. 
"With the direction we want to go and the way Jim wants to play, it may not benefit Glenn," King said. "I don't think Glenn's lost any of his skill level. It's just the way we're going as an organization." 
Robinson, who played at Purdue and was Indiana's 1991 high school Mr. Basketball from Gary Roosevelt, averaged 16.6 points per game last season -down from his career average of 20.8. 
O'Brien said Robinson needs a change of scenery for the third time in his career. 
"He needs to start for a team and put up numbers," O'Brien said. "I think he could fit. He's just not fitting in our starting lineup." 
Robinson, who had been replaced in the starting lineup by first-round pick Andre Igoudala, took the news in stride. 
"They want to go with the younger guys and play Andre at small for­ward and that's fine," Robinson said. Rockets sign McGrady to multiyear extension 
HOUSTON -The Houston Rockets signed two-time NBA scoring cham­pion Tracy McGrady to a multiyear contract extension on Monday. 
Terms of the deal were not released. 
Before being traded to the Rockets from Orlando in June, McGrady had vowed to exercise the opt-out clause in his contract, which had three years remaining. The clause was to go into effect after this season. 
''I'm pretty happy about that. It's one thing I can get off my mind,"' McGrady told Houston television sta­tion KRIV. 
Rockets owner Les Alexander said in a statement that team officials now would direct their efforts on All­Star center Yao Ming.Shaq uncertain for season opener against Nets 
MIAMI -Shaquille O'Neal remains bothered by a strained left ham­string, yet the 11-time All-Star cen­ter hopes to play Wednesday when Miami opens its season at New Jersey. 
O'Neal missed most of Miami's practice Monday, sparking concerns that the injury is worse than feared. The Heat, however, did not place O'Neal on the injured list, indicating they believe the problem is minor. 
Still, Heat coach Stan Van Gundy was clearly disappointed that O'Neal -who sat out practices Friday and Saturday, and missed three of Miami's seven preseason games ­wasn't able to participate in Monday's workout.

Field hockey sweeps Kent State, Ashland 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame's field hockey club swept a pair of games this week­end at Kent State and Ashland. Hebecca Mosca, Eleanor Bradley, and Leigh Madeira each seared two goals for the Irish while Kaitlin Moran and Mary Davis rounded out the balanced attack in an 8-0 whitewash of Kent State. Moran and Madeira shared goaltending duties, as well. In Moran's first stint between the pipes, she regis­tered two saves. 
In Sunday's action, the Irish eontinued their dominating play with a second shutout, 5-0 over Ashland. Madeira played goal the entire game, making six stops. Bradley and Davis ripped home two goals apiece, with Moran adding a final goal to her three assists. 
Men's rowing 
The Notre Dame rowing dub faced rocky weather and tough eompetition from over 40 di!l'er­ent dubs and organizations this weekend at the Iload of the Elk Hegatta in Elkhart. Thn novice team had a strong showing in the eights, rowing a blistering 
16:37 despite the choppy water conditions and being a man down in the boat. They earned a fourth-place finish and came in only 15 seconds behind the No. 1 Purdue boat. 
The open four event proved to be another big event for the 
Irish. They had strong showings 
in the A, B and C heats. The 
highlights of the races were a 
fourth-place finish in the B heat 
with a time of 16:21.4 and a 
medal-earning third-place finish 
in the C heat with the line up of 
Bill Blosky, Dan Kettinger, Dan 
Hobertson, and Joe Blakely and 
coxed by Kim Genesio. 
The men's lightweight compe­
tition played out with intense 
action as well. The two Notre 
Dame boats put up good num­
bers of 19:34.9 and 18:06.6 
despite a collision with Michigan 
State and other fierce competi­
tion from University of Michig:u ~ 
Northwestern University and 
Mercyhurst College. 
The big event of the day was 
the men's open eights competi­
tion. Notre Dame posted stellar 
scores in both the A and B heats. 
Bowling 
Van Koppersrnith 's 182 aver­age and personal high game of 221 led the Irish to a 21st place finish in the season opening league competition in Pittsburgh this weekend. Vance MeClenton and Jim Talamo rolled games over 190 and Pavan Sadarangani provided strong 
depth with a five-game average of 166. J.B. Bertumen and Tom Talamo were among the top five Irish bowlers and helped the squad break 800 in three of its five games, narrowly missing in the two other games. The Irish are dosing the gap on the league leaders as they look to continue advancing up the league stand­ings. 
Squash 
Notre Dame's squash club was recognized this year by the Collegiate Squash Association as an emerging team member of the CSA. Led by team .captain Sereeparp Anantavrasilp, the Irish journeyed to Penn State to participate in three matches on Saturday. With only seven play­ers making the trip, the Irish had to forfeit matches at number 8 and 9 in every contest. The Irish fell to Penn State 8-1, Haverford 8-1 and Colgate 6-3 in the finale. 
Irish freshman Mike Gelinas, playing at number 2 in the line­up, swept all three of his match­es, 3-0, 3-2, and 3-1. Sophomore James Zhang, a member of the Singapore national junior team, played number one and dropped two close matches before win­ning his third, 3-0 over Colgate. Team captain Sereepart Anantavrasillp was a solid num­ber three for the Irish and also won his third match, to give the Irish wins at the top three spots against Colgate. 
Collin Donovan, Mike McConnell, Anish Thomas and Mary Winegart played competi­tiv~ matches despite corning up short, and gained valuable expe­rience. Donavan and Thomas both won games against Penn State in a pair of lengthy match­es.

Equestrian 
The ND/SMC Equestrian team placed second at the IUPUI show this weekend, earning reserve high point honors. In a closely bunched finish, the Irish 32 points finished just behind IUPUI with 34 points and just ahead of Earlham's 31 points. 
In individual performances, Claire Freeman and Katie Baron took second and fourth in open fences. Caitlin Landuyt earned 1st in intermediate fences, fol­lowed by Molly Schmiege, sec­ond, and Ana Hichter sixth.

your friends. It was definitely a sweet win today, no doubt about it." 
In the first half, Dillon looked dominant as their option offense picked up huge chunks of yardage against a porous Alumni defense. The Big Hed took the early lead with a rushing touch­down that put them up 6-0, a lead they were able to hold until early in the forth quarter. 
"Their option and their wing offense is probably the best in the league, and they do a really good job at trying to confuse the defense," Remen said. "Their line did a really good job at sealing off and making holes for the running backs." 
But key def-ensive plays brought Alumni storming back into the game. Pat Higgins recov­ered a costly Dillon fumble at the end of the third quarter near the Dillon 20-yard line. Using the good field position to their advan­tage, Alumni freshman quarter­back Brent Locey threw a five-shut down the run and make them have third-and-long situa­tions where they were forced to pass. We were then able to bring in another defensive back to cover their receivers." 
With their first win of the post­season under their belts, the Dawgs now look to take the sec­ond step towards playing in the Stadium and competing for the interhall title. 
"We're taking it one week at a time but everyone is pumped because we're one win away from getting to the Stadium," Rflmen said. "We're going to go out there and work hard and try and improve. Just get better and do the best we can and go from there."

"llalf of our Ioss1~s wn rn times wlw n little things going diiTerently could have nwant wins. I'm disap­pointed to not be in the hunt for tho MIAA title, but we'll use 
it as motivation for next year." 
Looking to next year is one of tho few things the Belles can do at this point with their hopns for the playoffs already gone. 
"As a team, we feel like we didn't accomplish what we set out to accomplish. llopefully with the returning players, thorn will bt~ a strong motiva­tion and dosire to work hard in tho of'J'-snason," MacKenzie said. "The seven seniors leav­ing the program set a pretty high standard with their play and work f\thic. They have def­initely raised the level or play to a higher caliber for

that has slowly brought tlw Saint Mary's pro­gram to prominence. 
"As a coaching staff. I feel we wero very fortunate we got the senior class to start our tenure hero at Saint Mary's," MacKonzie said. "They are one of the best senior classes nver to play here, in terms of talent, leadership skills and love or the game. They love thn pro­gram and their teammates, and it comes through every day."

"More than half the team was in the infirmary today with ... some type of stomach bug," coaeh Bobby Clark said. "I just don't think there would be enough players to play the game." 
The Spartans have tentatively rescheduled the game for Wednesday, but Clark said the situation depends on the health of the .players. 
"We'll talk to Michigan State, we'll reappraise the situation !this] morning once we see exactly what's there," Clark said. 'Til listen to the medical stall' at Notre Dame [Health Services) and decide whether it makes sense to play the game on Wednesday or if there are any other options." 
Practice was cancelled Monday because of the state of the team's hmtlth. 
"It was a decision throughout the day," Clark said. "It got worse and worse with more and more people going down, and it just didn't make any sense Ito play the game]. I don't think we'd have enough players to get a team together. Something obvi­ously went through the whole team."

And wlwn tlw Volunteer fans break into a rendition of Tnnnnssoe's signature song "Hocky Top," the Irish are going to know about it. 
"I know it's a really big stadi­um. It's one of those stadiums that's stacked really high and has a lot of noise," Irish line­

Last year, the Irish traveled to Michigan Stadium to take on the Wolverines at the "Big House," falling by a score of 38-0 in front of a crowd of over 107,000. While the Neyland crowd is slightly smaller, it may be even more of an obsta­cle for a team to overcome because of the way the stadium is configured. 
Unlike Michigan Stadium, which is built low to the ground with seats expanding outward, Neyland is built in layers with seats stacked verti­

With a roller-coaster season full of ups and downs already behind them, the Belles will look to end their year on a high note when they !wad back to thn road for today's match­up against Tri-State Uniw~rsity.

"''m hoping we ran gnt a lot ol' players on thn linld for our last game of' tlw season." coach Caryn MaeKnnzie said. "Our track record on the road hasn't been great this year, but I still feel good about bning able to get a lot of people in for our game against Tri-State."

In a physical. defensively dominated first half. the No. S Morrissey Manoritns looked poisnd to hand the No. 1 Kennan Knights their first loss and an early exit from tlw playofl's. But the KnighLs qw~lled Morrissey's upsnt bid with a 7-0 victory.

No. 2 Welsh mounts late comeback 
By MIKE LASKEY, TOM BARR, PETE 
CRACCHIOLO and MIKE TENNANT 
Sporrs Writers 

The Welsh Family Whirlwinds just cou.ldn't seem to get it going. The defense was sort and confused. There were dropped balls, eostly slips and botched opportunities. 
Then, in the second half of their playoff game against the Breen-Phillips Babes, the Whirlwinds turned it all around. 
Led by quarterback Melissa Sands's three touchdown strikes -two to wide receiver Lauren lloeck -and an instant­ly revitalized defense, the No. 2 seed Whirlwinds erased a 13-0 halftime deficit to defeat the No. 7 seed Babes 22-19 Sunday afternoon in the quarterfmals of the women's interhall football playoffs. 
The first half for the Whirlwinds was frustrating from the start, as Breen­Phillips scored on a 65-yard touchdown pass on the game's second play. Later in
