CHINA IN TURMOIL 

Chinese student needed connections to make trip work 
By KELLEY TUTHILL 
Senior Staff Reporter 
This is the last of a three­part series. 
Xiao Qiang, the Notre Dame graduate student who traveled to China just days after the crackdown in Tiananman Square, said that connections made his trip to Bejing a suc­cess. 
Qiang said he needed to find someone trustworthy who would help him plan the trip to Bejing. He decided to contact a friend who taught in a city near Guang Zhou. 
"I didn't know what to tell her, I hadn't seen the woman in three years. I also knew my story sounded crazy," said Qiang. "In the beginning she was nervous." He said she had heard conflicting stories about what really happened in Bejing. 
The woman told Qiang that he could stay with her as long as he did not go anywhere. She changed his money for him and brought current news reports for him, said Qiang. 
For a week Qiang said he was able to watch news reports broadcast from both China and Hong Kong. "I got a lot of information and met with some students from Bejing who were trying to hide." 
Qiang also made contact with several people that he knew in the area. "Everybody said don't go to Bejing," said Qiang. During this time Qiang was able to get an address of a family who had a child die in the massacre. 

A reporter friend of Qiang's said she would go to Bejing with Qiang. He explained that it was easier for her to get a plane ticket. 
Two weeks after the mas­sacre Qiang was able to get a plane ticket and fly to Bejing. He said he had little trouble in the Bejing airport. 
"In Bejing things were worse than I imagined," said Qiang. He said a taxi driver gave him information about the current situation on the streets. 
Qiang went to the home lo­cated at the address he received from a friend. He said the fam­ily was very surprised and asked "how did you hear about this?" Their son, a high school student, was killed in the mas­sacre. The father of the family was suspicious of Qiang and wanted nothing to do with him, he said. 
Qiang saw soldiers beating people in the streets and said he "couldn't believe it." He said one day he saw three plain clothed men with walkie-talkies in the street and thought it was very strange. 
In light of the travel restric­tions for Chinese students, Qiang said he wanted to apply for a permit as soon as possi­ble. He said he took a train to his former university. 
"I visited some of my profes­sors and they told me what I needed to do to get back to the 
U.S. They all wanted me to re­turn," said Qiang. "Many of them offered me help without me even asking." 
Qiang took a train ride to a city 18 hours outside of Bejing. 
While there he "spoke to stu­dents and got more informa­tion," said Qiang. 
At this point Qiang's family made their first contact with him since he returned to China. He said they were angry and told him "after you get the permit (to leave China) we're coming to get you." According to Qiang, his family could not understand why he had come home. 
Qiang said his mother was worried about him. He said his family thought he was acting foolishly. "They had a hard time understanding why I had come home," said Qiang. During the five days Qiang stayed with his family they were able to understand him better,

WORLD BRIEFS 

Colombia's cocaine war has called attention to another battle: the coffee war. Colombia blames the United States for a nosedive in the price of coffee, which brought Colombia almost $_1.5 billion last year and is the South American nation's top for­mgn exchange earner. Government officials here complain that what Washington gives with one hand-such as military aid to fight drug traffickers the other hand takes away, in coffee rev­enue. The Colombians claim that this money could be used for fighting drugs. 
The Po_lish Parliament on Tuesday approved the first gov­ernment 111 the East bloc not led by Communists, giving half the seats to Solid~rity but reserving the key ministries controlling de­fense and police for the Communists. "For the first time in half a r:(mtury, Poland has a government that can be considered by mil­hems of people as their own," said Solidarity leader Lech Wales a f~om Gdansk, where the independent movement struggled through mght years of Communist repression to its triumph. ' 
Soviet political maverick Boris Yeltsin met briefly with !~resident Bush on Tuesday after publicly urging the administra­tiOn to help salvage Mikhail Gorbachev's political and economic reforms: "The president emphasized that the American people share his hope for the success of the reform movement in the Soviet Union," the White House said in a statement after the meeting. Bush told Yeltsin his administration enjoys a "very posi­tive relationship" with Soviet President Gorbachev and reiterated support for perestroika, or Soviet restructuring, the the White House said. 

NATIONAL BRIEFS 

Disabled activists are disturbed by recent court rulings that let quadriplegics choose death over life with paralysis, a trend they contend subtly encourages the disabled to end it all. Advocates for the disabled say the case of Larry McAfee -the Atlanta man who won a court order allowing him to shut off the ventilator that has kept him alive since 1985 -is but one example of what happens when state health systems fail to give their dis­abled patients a chance at life outside of hospitals and state insti­tu~io~s. ~au~ Lon~more, a California historian and quadriplegic, said mstitutwnahzed care for the disabled is the norm in most states.."Many st~tes a~e li~e that," Longmore said. "Essentially, states hke Georgia ... give disabled people two choices: the nursing home or the cemetery." 
Deborah Epstein Popper and Frank Popper aren't winning any converts to their notion that the Great Plains ought to be emptied of people and given back to the buffalo and the tall grasses. The Poppers are professors at Rutgers University in New Jersey, a state that is the butt of more than a few jokes, and that makes them easy targets for more of the same. Prominent among their critics is Rep. Pat Roberts, a Republican who represents most of west Kansas, and who says that every time the region goes through hard times "you get another think tank effort to send us back to the buffalo." "We still believe Woody Allen was joking when he claimed every place has redeeming social value 'with the possible exception of New Jersey,'"the congressman wrote to The Washington Post. "We only hope the Poppers were joking as well." 

INDIANA BRIEFS 
A fine of more than $180,000 dollars that Drexel Burnham Lambert is expected to pay Indiana is the largest fine ever paid in the state for securities fraud, officials in Indianapolis said Tues­day. The secretary of state's office said the fine would be used to launch a campaign to educate consumers about investment and securities fraud. The New York investment firm has been ordered to pay Indiana a fine of $180,127 as part of a national settlement of a securities and mail fraud case. Indiana investors who lost money because of Drexel violations are also entitled to compensa­tion from a nationwide escrow account of $350 million. 

CAMPUS BRIEFS 
The student who contracted measles was released from the Health Center Sunday morning, according to Carol Sea­ger, director of University Heatlh Services. The case sparked off a massive im!llunization effort by Universit~'· county and state health officmls. 6416 measles shots were given on Friday and Monday, Seager said.

War on drugs requires new targets, not more ammo 
Last Tuesday in a nationwide address Presi­
dent Bush outlined his $7.9 billion war on drugs 
to the American people. Immediately afterward, 
Senator Joe Biden took to the air to sum up the 
Democratic response to Bush's plan: Not 
enough money. 
The next morning, Bush's plan was dissected, 
analyzed, examined, and judged by the members 
of Congress, the media, and the American pub­
lic. The oft-invoked standard, the yardstick, the one word used to judge the plan which seemed to dominate air time on network newscasts was once again, money. Money. 
Surely Bush's plan contains something else. Is 
it merely a Jist of figures, figures which in most 
cases showed increases, however large or small, 
of existing programs? 
In a sense, yes. The plan is about money. Com­
pared to most areas of the federal budget, how­
ever, even the requested increases represent a 
pitifully small percentage of all government 
spending. If all the President has in mind is 
pumping more federal dollars down the gov­
ernment pipeline, then his plan is a failure. 
Perhaps Bush was wise enough to realize that 
money alone is not the answer. Consider: From 
1980 to 1987 federal funds spent on drug inter­
diction and border patrol have tripled. The re­
sult has been a 27 -fold rise in seizures of co­
caine at our nation's borders. 
Yet cocaine continues to be available through­out the United States. Where there is a demand, there will be a supply. 
Similarly, funds spend on education programs were the fastest growing component of the fed­eral drug budget, up 328 percent between 1981 and 1988, yet the evidence shows that educa­tional programs which merely provide informa­tion about the dangers of drug abuse have failed to significantly reduce the demand for drugs. 
In the war on drugs, government is losing the battles. Bush's challenge is to switch the em­phasis from failed government attempts to in­terdict supply and "educate" away demand to one of the few policies left which has so far shown promise: User accountability. Zero tol­erance. No exceptions. Drug users must be made aware that any use of drugs, no matter how small, no matter how infrequent, is unac­ceptable. 
Realizing this goal will involve increases in money and resources for our nation's criminal justice system, and the money Bush proposes to add here is certainly needed. Tough laws areal­ready on the books. but tough laws do little without the threat of arrest, to say nothing of the threat of prosecution and spending time in jail. 
With an estimated 26 million recreational or habitual drug users, however, increasing the number of arrests could conceivably place 10

percent of our population behind bars. Such an extreme would not be necessary. For many abusers, especially recreational ones, the sight of others being arrested and convicted may be enough. For first time users, a measured re­sponse could be given, ranging from a stiff fine to, say, suspension of driving privileges for six months. Whatever the penalty, users must know that if caught they will pay. 
The key to Bush's plan, though, is not where money is spent but where it is not spent. Those who assail his plan for being thin on funds seem to completely miss the point that money alone cannot and will not win the war against drugs. Two of the most powerful allies of illegal drugs are apathy and indifference. Though we don't like to admit it, we are all responsible for win­ning the war on drugs. It is easy to play arm­chair quarterback and lay blame on Congress and the President, but by doing so we arc only creating scapegoats for ourselves. This is our society. We live in it. If we want it to be free of drugs, we must act ourselves, and act in unison. 
Unfortunately, businesses and communities which have attempted to do just that arc run­ning into roadblocks, many of which have been erected by government itself. Tenants of public housing have difficulty evicting drug dealers from their buildings; Companies arn forbidden by some states from testing their workers for illegal drug use. Until we stop turning the other way, we will never be serious about the war on drugs. 
And until we shift the focus of the war from dollar amounts to user accountability, we will never win it.

Bio prof. wins Brand Award 
Special to The Observer 
Howard Saz, professor of bi­ological sciences at Notre Dame, has been awarded the first Bueding-Von Brand Memorial Award by the Ameri­can Society of Parasitologists. 
Saz received the award Au­gust 9 at the society's meeting in recognition of his contribu­tions to the biochemistry and pharmacology of helminiths, which are parasitic worms, and in honor of his 40 years of ba­sic research in the fields of mi­crobiology and parasitology. His research has been sup­ported continuously by the Na­tional Institute of Health. 
In 1953, Saz became a fellow of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and spent a year at the University of Sh­effield under S.R. Elsden and Nobel laureate Sir Hans Krebs. Saz has been on the faculty of Louisiana State University School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins Universities. In 1969 he began his tenure at Notre

Dame in the biology depart­
ment. 
Through many years of labo­ratory research, Saz's work helped to demonstrate numer­ous differences between the biochemistry of parasites and their hosts. He chose as a model for study the large in­testinal roundworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, a common para­site of humans and many ani­mals. Using this parasite he showed that this organism was capable of living and obtaining energy in the absence of oxy­gen. In addition, he explained the intermediate enzymatic 

steps which are different in the parasite and may be amenable to chemotherapeutic drugs. 
The Bueding-Von Brand award memorializes two noted parasitologists, Theodor von Brand and Ernest Bueding. 
Saz worked closely with Bueding while he was at LSU 
and  Johns  Hopkins.  He  was  
also  acquainted  with  von

Initiation to Spiritual Growth 
"Ever since the day we heard about you, we have never failed . to pray for yo_u; and what we ask God is that through perfect Wisdom and spmtual understanding you should reach the fullest 

At Notre Dame, people are invited to grow in­tellectually, emotionally, socially, physically and spiritually. The very atmosphere invites mem­bers of the University community to many dif­ferent levels and areas of growth. 

Among the greatest witnesses to growth are those men and women who -whether con­sciously or not -have committed themselves to growth along spiritual lines during their University years. 
Some do so through the worship of their par­ticular religious belief, some through the giving of their time to those who need it, some through giving of their income or wisdom or some com­bination of all the above, plus more. 
During the past academic year, thirteen per­sons made a very deliberate commitment to spiritual growth by investigation and respond­ing to (along with their sponsors and a staff of nine instructors) an almost year-long program of investigation and participation in the Rite of Christian Initiation. They met every Sunday from early fall until Easter, sharing their per­sonal stories of faith and spiritual growth. The process in which they immersed themselves is called the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA), which has its roots in the initiation rites of the earliest Christian communities. 
Some persons who are involved in the RCIA have never been baptized. Others have been bap­tized, but never followed through with active Church membership or are drawn to seek mem­bership in the Catholic Church. Still others are looking to increase their awareness of the role

HPC discusses campus SYR policies 
By MICHAEL SCHOLL 
News Staff 
A new drive by Notre Dame's student government to convince the University to liberalize its policy on SYR dances was dis­cussed at Tuesday's Hall Presi­dent's Council (HPC) meeting, which was held at Flanner Hall. 
Mike Carrigan of the student government's cabinet said the cabinet was dismayed with the University's refusal to consult students about new restrictions on SYRs before they were im­posed last year. The restric­tions include a limit of one SYR per dorm per semester and a requirement that a dorm sell tickets for its SYR to 70 per­cent of its residents or face the SYR's cancellation. 
Carrigan asked HPC for as­sistance in forming a committee that would explore new ways to persuade the University to change its SYR policies. One of the possible avenues of per­suasion discussed would be a campus-wide circulation of pe­titions to students that would ask the University to re-exam­ine its policies. 
In other HPC business, James Dailey of the Notre Dame Environmental Action Club discussed the organiza­tion's need for volunteers to assist in the management of the University's new waste recy­cling program. Dailey said the program will soon be expanded to maintain receptacles for re­cyclable products like newspa­pers, glass, cardboard, mixed paper, and plastic throughout the campus. 
Members of the council were also given the dates when each

of religion in their already begun journey of 
faith. 
If you fit in any of these categories (or have 
come up with one of your own), you might be in­
terested in learning more about the RCIA. To do 
so, just call Sr. Mary Curran at Campus 
Ministry (239-5242) to arrange at time to 
discuss the RICA program. 
During such a discussion, the process of the 
Rite for Christian Initiation will be explained. It 
begins with a period of inquiry, in which per­
sonal faith life experiences are shared, the 
Christian faith is examined and the word of God 
in scripture is reflected upon. Then, at a rite of 
welcome, those investigating membership in the 
Church are accepted as candidates for initia­
tion. They become known as "catechumens". 
They are welcomed into the Christian 
Community, which promises to support them in 
their faith journey. 
Arter being welcomed, those interested in ex­ploring the life of faith in this way are assisted by a sponsor and the RCIA team, the Christian way of life is more closely examined. Then, those who wish and are ready to commit to baptism or full communion take the final steps toward initiation on the first Sunday of Lent, during a special service during the Liturgy of the Word. They are now known as the "elect". 
The final step of preparation is the prepara­tion for baptism or renewal of baptismal promise. This culminates at the Easter Vigil Service with the sacraments of initiation (Baptism, confirmation and Eucharist) or a profession of faith in the Catholic Church before dorm will participate in this fall's Campus Challenge, a Notre Dame Athletic Depart­ment contest designed to drum up support for Notre Dames volleyball and soccer teams. Each dorm will be assigned a game to attend. The residents of the dorm who purchase tick­ets for their assigned game will be counted. At the end of the semester, prizes will be awarded to the dorm with the greatest percentage of its resi­dents attending its assigned 
game. 
The HPC was also informed by Tom King,Senior class vice­president, that guides for stu­dents going on any of the Notre Dame football team's six road trips this season will be avail­able at the senior class office and in the dining halls for $2 each.

the entire assembly of believers. 
In the weeks following Easter, the new Christians meet to reflect on the meaning of the recent events in their lives. 
There are many witnesses to the spiritual growth efforts of the University community: walks to the grotto at the end of a night; men and women committed to religious values and direction staffing all residence halls; people with deep religious values in the classroom and staffing offices throughout the University; reli­gious services practically 'round the clock not only on Sunday, but every day of the week; folks with backward collars on the sidelines of ath­letic events; athletes giving thanks after signifi­cant accomplishments; record involvements in the Center for Social Concerns' projects; adver­tisements for becoming a contemplative nun in­terspersed with requests for 2 GA's, any game; 
A.A. meetings on campus every day of the week; the Voices of Faith Gospel Choir; liturgical and folk choirs; religious newspapers taking the bulk of space in the periodical section; religious houses dotting two lakes; chapels in every resi­dence hall. 
The spiritual atmosphere at Notre Dame is quite contagious. The RCIA is only one way of exploring issues related to faith and spiritual growth, but has the advantage of being a very structured program of initiation with a wide va­riety of participation for support and reflection. 
If this particular way might interest you, you might wish to be present at the informational session this evening. Call the Campus Ministry Office at 239-5242.

the noise standards at the minimum. I hope for more than that," said Doran. 
Many times a call to the police can be avoided if students get to know their neighbors, said Doran. "I encourage you to get out and talk to your neighbors," he said. 
Bennett addressed the ques­tion of off-campus parties. He said the police will not go to a party unless they receive a complaint, in which case they must go. He added that if stu­dents need help controlling a party they should call the police department and ask to speak to the supervisor. 
The student should then ex­plain that he or she is the host/hostess of the party and would like some help control­ling the situation. He suggested that the resident meet the offi­cer outside when the car ar­rives. 

"I would rather go after the rapist or the burglar, but if we get a complaint about a party we have to go," said Bennett. He said that a 500 person off­campus party last year required 14 units to calm it down. That

Bennett said that two weeks ago four extra officers were added to Beat 10 and Beat 11 on Eddy Street. The officers will be on duty between the hours of 6 p.m. and 3 a.m. seven days a week, he said.

Bennett said he expects stu­dents to be respectful of his of­ficers and in return the officers should be respectful, too. If students have problems with an officer they should call the De­partment and ask to speak to a supervisor, he said. 
"This year we hope to im­prove communication and co­operation between off-campus students, Student Government and the Police Department," said Helms. He said relation­ships in the past-have been strained. "Right now we have no base," said Helms. He was pleased that the number of stu­dents were up from last year. 
Breslin said when students are more aware of the prob­lems less parties will get broken up and it will be better for students on and off-campus. 
Tom Helms and Mike Locas­cio are the Hall President Coun­cil's off-campus representatives and Michael Sullivan serves as Student Government's off-cam­pus representative.

he said. 

A friend of Qiang's whose fa­ther worked in a high position, asked his father if he could help Qiang attain a travel permit. Qiang said he did have some difficulties at the Chinese and American Embassies. Ultimately, with the help of friends and family connections he was able to attain the visa. 
Qiang said he received much help from the older generation. "During this time I got the love and understanding of my fam­ily," said Qiang. 
Connections in Bejing helped Qiang to plan the safest trip, he said. In Bejing he was finally able to visit families and talk to them as friends had explained to them why he was there prior to his visit, said Qiang. 
At this time Qiang spoke to numerous people in the city in­cluding taxi drivers and nurses.

could better grasp the situa­tion, said Qiang. 
"I was careful and I relied on my friends for help," said Qiang. "My timing was a little late, but I felt that I did every­thing I came back for." He said it was often hard to get people to talk about the situation as the memories were so painful. 
Qiang left China after a two month stay. He said customs did take him aside, but that it was no problem. He said when he returned to the U.S. students here were very anxious to hear news from China. 
"I made up my mind then that I wanted to devote myself to doing something for my coun­try," said Qiang. He left Notre Dame on Saturday to volunteer in the national Chinese solidar­ity group in Washington. The group has approximately 40,000 members. He said he will continue some independent studies. 
"I feel sad to leave my physics and my Notre Dame friends," said Qiang. 
Qiang said after a year or so he would like to come back to Notre Dame as a student in the Peace Studies program. He said his future plans also include a trip home to China and interna­
tional travel.

Proper guidance fuels journeys of faith 
Dear Hditor: 

I was pained to read Mark Derwent's editorial of Sept. 11 entitled, "Objectivity is needed in making religious decisions." While reading the article, I kept wondering how Mr. Derwent would answer objectively his children's inquiries concerning religion. I am assuming that he believes some "religion" is good for his children and that his particular religious beliefs ei­ther should not enter the pic­ture at all or should be com­pared and contrasted with the beliefs of all other religions (a sort of equal time approach). can "rationally" choose to ac­right but the duty to Now the former would do away cept his American citizenship?

Bielecki shuts down Expos, Cubs widen lead in NL East 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Mike Bielecki pitched a two-hitter -allowing no hits over the final seven in­nings -and the Chicago Cubs beat the Montreal Expos 2-0 Tuesday night to take a 4 1/2­game lead over St. Louis in the National League East. 
It was the fourth straight victory for the Cubs and their fifth win in six games. The fourth-place Expos lost for the fifth time in six games and fell six games behind the Cubs. The Cardinals lost 5-2 to Pittsburgh. 
The Cubs also moved 5 112 games ahead of the third-place New York Mets, who lost 2-1 to Philadelphia. 
Bielecki gave up a leadoff single to Tim Raines in the first inning and a single to Tim Wallach with one out in the second. 
"I've never pitched a better game but it could have gone ei­ther way," said Bielecki. whose 

previous best effort was a 
three-hit, 4-0, shutout against 
Los Angeles on July 19. 
Bielecki, 16-6, and Bryn 

Smith, 10-9, were locked in a 
scoreless duel when Vance Law 
opened the fifth with a single 
and moved to third on Shawon 
Dunston's double. 
Smith retired Rick Wrona on 

an infield pop and struck out 
Bielecki. Jerome Walton then 
swung at a 1-0 pitch that 
eluded catcher Nelson 
Santovenia and Law scored the 
unearned run on the passed 
ball. 
Hyne Sandberg led off the eighth inning against reliever John Candelaria with his 30th homer to give the Cubs a 2-0 lead. 
Pirates 5, Cardinals 2 
Bob Walk allowed five hits in 8 2-3 innings for his fourth victory over St. Louis this season and Pittsburgh 
continued its role of spoiler by 1-teating the Cardinals. 
Phillies 2, Mets 1 
Dickie Thon homered with one out in the ninth inning to lift Philadelphia past New York. 
Reliever Don Aase, 1-5, re­tired pinch-hitter Len Dykstra on a popup to start the ninth, before Thon hit a 2-2 pitch over the left-field wall for his 13th home run. 
The Mets, who are 28-41 on the road, have 18 games left in the season. 
Roger McDowell, 4-6, pitched two scoreless innings for the victory. Since being acquired from the Mets on June 18, McDowell has not allowed a run at home. Two of his wins are against New York. 
Frank Viola and Ken Howell also started against each other in Philadelphia on Aug. 7, with the Phillies winning 2-1 with a run in the bottom of the ninth. 
Twins 8, Blue Jays 2 Kent Hrbek had a grand slam and a career-high five RBis and David West won for the third time in four starts since arriv­ing in the Frank Viola trade. West yielded six hits and struck out a career-high seven in seven innings. 

White Sox 11, Orioles 1 
Eric King beat Baltimore for the third time this season and Ivan Calderon, Carlton Fisk and Scott Fletcher all homered. King yielded three hits in seven innings and raised his lifetime record to 6-1 against Baltimore. 
By the end of the fourth in­ning the White Sox had seven runs, 10 hits and 15 baserun­ners and had chased three Baltimore pitchers, including Ben McDonald, the No. 1 choice in the June amateur draft. McDonald pitched two-thirds of an inning and gave up two runs and three hits, including Calderon's three-run homer that gave Chicago a 7-0 lead in the fourth inning. 
Indians fire Edwards 
Doc Edwards, his team 14 1/2 games out of first place, was fired as manager of the Cleveland Indians Tuesday and replaced on an interim basis by special assignment scout John Hart. 
Hart was third base coach last season at Baltimore and was brought to Cleveland by Indians president Hank Peters, a former Orioles general man­ager. 
Edwards' dismissal came as the team had lost eight of its last 10 games, and was an­nounced by Peters, who said, 
''This is not a particularly happy occasion for me." 
Edwards had kept the Indians in contention through mid­summer. The club was at .500 with a 54-54 record and 1 1/2 games out of first place in the American League East on Aug. 
4. Since then the team went 11­24.

Irish lose Women's soccer battles Golden Gophers 
Ellis for fall semester 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame basket­
ball team's demanding early­
season schedule just got a 
whole lot tougher. 
Forward LaPhonso Ellis, who averaged 13.5 points and 9.4 rebounds per game last season, has been de­clared academically ineligible for the fall semester, the ath­letic department announced Tuesday. 
The Univp,rsity requires its athletes to earn a 2.0 semester grade-point aver­age in order to remain eligi­ble. 
Ellis' future eligibility will be determined by how he fares at Notre Dame over the next semester. 
"I expect to get the job done in the classroom, and I will be back on the court sometime in December," said Ellis. 
Fall semester exams end Dec. 21, and Ellis can not re­turn to action until semester grades are turned in and certified by the registrar's office. 
Before Dec. 21, the Irish have home games with San Francisco and UCLA and road tests with Indiana and Marquette. Notre Dame also faces Louisville Dec. 2 in the Big Four Classic at Indianapolis. 
Notre Dame has home games with Valparaiso on Dec. 21, Lafayette on Dec. 22 and Butler on Dec. 30. 
Ellis, a Parade high school aJI-American who directed East St. Louis (Ill.) Lincoln to back-to-back state titles, Jed the Irish in rebounding last season and was second to Joe Fredrick in scoring. He set a school season record with 53 blocked shots. 
The 6-foot-9 forward scored 27 points against St. Bonaventure in the first game of his collegiate ca­reer. No Irish player reached that total for the rest of the season. He also pulled down a season-high 18 rebounds in an 81-65 first-round NCM tournament victory.

The Notre Dame women's soccer team will attempt to continue establishing a new tradition tonight as they face Minnesota at 5 p.m. at Krause Stadium. The Irish were unde­feated at home last year and, despite a slow start, are eon!i­dent that the Notre Dame mys­tique will serve them WPII again this year. 
"We've never played them be­fore, so we don't really know what to expeet," said senior eo­captain K.T. Sullivan of the home opener. "It is a big ad­vantage that we have never lost at home." 
Y!'t::"'"" ' Any advantages were unfor­
l~·:·~t~ tunately in absence for the Irish over the weekend wlwn the team dropped both games on a roadtrip to Wisconsin. A 2-1 loss to Wisconsin­Milwaukee came before an ill­fated meeting with 3rd-ranked Wisconsin-Madison on Saturday. "They were absolutely incred­ible," said Irish head coach Dennis Grace. "They had three 
goals in about the lirst 15 min­
utes." 
Although Madison ended up shutting out Notre Dame 6-0, Graee felt good about the game and the trip. 
"It was a growing, maturing weekend," he said. "The Madison game was decided early, but we kept working. We did everything we could have done against that team that was stronger tactically and technically better than us. llopnfully we can mmedy our faults and start applying what we've learned to thP future games." 
Grace will be relying on the leadership of Sullivan and the other eo-captain .Joy Sisolak. to mentor this very young and in­experienced team that counts five freshmen and three sophomorns as starters. 
"This w1~ekend was our first overnight trip. 1\ lot of fresh­men are starting and they were nervous." said Sullivan. who al­nmdy has two goals on the sea­son. "The charaeter of the team is decidedly diiT1~rent this year

Pendergast , Irish face rematch with Detroit 
By KEN TYSIAC 
Sports Writer 
One week ago, freshman for­ward Kevin Pendergast led the Notre Dame Men's Soccer team to a 4-3 overtime victory in the Motor City against MCC rival Detroit. Pendergast's goal ten minutes into OT gave the Irish their first win of the season. 
Tonight, however, the Irish must do it all over again when they face Detroit for the second time in one week at Krause Stadium at 7:30. Nobody ever said collegiate soccer was easy, least of all Kevin Pendergast. 
"The players in college are much stronger and faster than they were in high school," ad­mits Pendergast, "And as a freshman I haven't had the op­portunity to get on a serious weight program. As a result, I'm physically inferior to a lot of the players out there." 
Pendergast has performed superbly, however, despite his lack of strength. In the Indiana Classic in Bloomington where the Irish bowed to Virginia and St. Louis, Pendergast made the All-Tournament team along with teammate Paul LaVigne. 
Then in Detroit he pounced on the rebound of a shot by teammate Mitch Kern and poked home the first goal of his collegiate career. Kevin took the goal pretty much in stride, though. 

Kevin Pendergast 
"Our team had the run of play in overtime, and I knew some­body was going to get the goal sooner or later. I just happened to be there for the rebound of Mitch's shot outside the box. The ball was just sitting there for me-it was a perfect set­up." 

While Pendergast has been brilliant at times for the Irish, he knows that he has a Jot of potential for improvement. "I have to learn all of the players around me because they've been playing together for a few years and I'm just starting out here." 
Irish coach Dennis Grace is delighted with Pendergast's progress to date. "He has a lot of composure for a freshman," says Grace, "He's very gifted athletically and gifted in his willingness to train to do well." 
"Kevin goes as hard in prac­tice as he does in a game against Indiana or St. Louis. We're extremely happy to have him here at Notre Dame. lie has a great four years ahead of him." 
Of tomorrow night's game against Detroit, Grace says, "I think our kids are very hungry for Detroit. This is a very im­portant game as far as our season goes. We have to prove that we are not only better than they are, but significantly bet­ter." 
"I wasn't happy with the way we played last time against them, but I was certainly happy that when the kids put them­selves in a hole, they were able to dig themselves out." 
TIIHOW INS: Tonight's game will be broadcast live from Krause Stadium by SportsChannel America. The Irish also appeared on SportsChannel on September 8th in a tape delayed telecast of their 2-0 September 2nd Joss to St. Louis ... The Detroit Titans return live of last year's top six seorers, including juniors Pete Tangalos (22 points) and Chris Bologna (21 points). Goalie Don Koontz will anchor the de­fense .... Since adopting Krause Stadium as their home field in 198 7, the Irish are perfect on home turf, with a record of 18­0-0 .... The Irish have a perfect 5-0 record against Detroit in the three years since the Titans established a soccer program. 
Bo knows...Michigan natives chose ND instead 
When playing sandlot football as a kid, Detroit native Rodney Culver pretended to be University of Michigan star tailback Butch Woolfolk. 
When he entered high school, his allegiances changed to the green and white of Michigan State, where he admired the running style of Lorenzo White. 
Culver returns to the state of Michigan this week­end, but he'll be on the visitors sideline. Scott Kowalkowski and Todd Lyght join him as players who grew up near Michigan Stadium who decided to come to Notre Dame. 
That doesn't mean they never considered wearing the maize and blue. 
"I was very much interested up until the week be­fore the signing date, and I kind of decided to come here (Notre Dame)," said the sophomore Irish tail­back. "I went up there on visits with friends, and I wasn't very comfortable up there. I decided I'd like to be away from home." 
Culver, who eventually selected Notre Dame over UCLA, did have a discussion with veteran Michigan coach Bo Schembechler. 
"I think I remember him talking about the size of my hands," said Culver. "He was saying how big they were and how they'd help me be able to handle 

Steve Megargee 
Irish Items 

the football, then he got down to academics." Schembechler had a sterner conversation with Lyght, a cornerback from Flint. 
"He's a very forward recruiter; he just lays it on the line," said Lyght, who already has two inter­ceptions this season. "I remember him talking to me one night over the phone. It was early January, and he said, 'I expect you to commit to me next Monday,' and I hadn't finished all my visits." 
"I explained to him that I was going to take my time with it, and I didn't want to rush into anything, and I assured him that he was still in the running." 
Notre Dame and Michigan were Lyght's final two choices. 
"When I visited Michigan, I really enjoyed it, and Bo Schembechler's a great coach, but when it came down to it, I wanted to play for Lou Holtz." he said. 
Kowalkowski, who grew up in Farmington Hills, 
just a half-hour away from Michigan Stadium, will 
see a familiar face working with the opposition 
Saturday. 

"The guy who's the linebackers coach at Michigan 
now -Jim Herman -coached me in high school, so I 
got quite a mouthful of Michigan," said the junior 
defensive end. "He was always talking about them, 
talking to Bo and other things. 
"Then, my junior year, he went over to Michigan 
as a coach, and naturally he came back for the 
games, so I was around it quite a bit." 
Kowalkowski, a Michigan fan who attended many Wolverine games his first two years in high school, managed to resist all that talk and decided not to make a recruiting visit. 
"I envisioned myself playing at Michigan, but that was earlier in my high school career, and as it went on I really didn't think about it that much," he said. 
All three of these Michigan residents will have family and friends back home watching them Saturday. but only Culver has acquaintances playing for the Wolverines. 
"I saw one of them over the summer, and he didn't make any predictions,'' said Culver. "But he gave me a stern look and said that he'd see me on the 16th."
