Dukakis: Victory is in sight 
Associated Press 
Michael Dukakis said Wed­nesday that victory in the Dem­ocratic nomination battle is "visible, but not inevitable" after his impressive New York win. Rival Jesse Jackson promised the presidential con­test will get "even more excit­ing" as it moves to Pennsylva­nia minus Albert Gore. 
"When I look back at Iowa now, there were many of us in this, but now there are three...Bush, Dukakis, and me," Jackson said after finish­ing second in New York. 
Democratic leaders across the country talked of Dukakis as the party's likely standard­bearer in the fall, while Repub­lican nominee-apparent George Bush said he looked for­ward to battling the Massachu­setts governor, calling him "an old-world liberal Democrat." 
"New York ...almost locks it up for Dukakis, or comes close to it," said Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, who sought the 1984 nomination. 
"It won't be a brokered con­vention. It'll be a first-ballot 
victory  for  Dukakis,"  said  
Democratic  National  
Committee  member  Fred  

Brown from Coffeyville, Okla. 
The focus of the Democratic campaign turned to Pennsylva­nia, with 178 delegates at stake next Tuesday. 
Democratic National Com­mittee chairman Paul Kirk cautioned that Dukakis has not locked up the nomination -yet. Quoting a baseball maxim, Kirk said, "It ain't over 'til it's over." 
But in contrast to earlier worries about a splintered con­vention in Atlanta in July, Kirk talked of "a very wholesome, positive unifying convention." He lauded both candidates, saying "these two who are going to be contending for the nomination down to the end" present "a real opportunity for forging a coalition to win in the fall." 
"These two" that Kirk referred to did not include Gore, the big loser in New York.

Lines turn into 

mob at 
By MARK MCLAUGHLIN 
News Editor 
Long lines of students in the corridors of O'Shaughnessy Hall collapsed into mobs Wed­nesday night as students at­tempted to register for check­marked courses. 
The worst conditions were in 
the lines for checkmarked the­
ology courses, called "a 
nightmare" by one student. 
"It turned from a line to sort of a gathering," said junior Dave Lese. "It's way too hot," he added. 
According to junior Brendan Cahill, the line for theology courses ran down the third floor hallway in O'Shaughnessy and back towards the department door. "They all collapsed as soon as the door opened," he added. 
Attempts to restore order to the theology line proved to be futile. "They keep saying how they'd stop registration until we got orderly," said junior Kathy Epping. 
Cries of "please, please pull this back" by one woman in the theology department went unheeded by the crowd. 
Sonia Gernes, associate pro­fessor of English and one of the people staffing the checkmark sign-ups, said, "We've had problems with the line because students aren't staying in it." 
A Security officer arrived at about 7: 45 in response to a call and told the crowd to reform a line. "I can't do it for you; you have to do it yourselves," he told the crowd. 
Shortly thereafter, the Secur­

O'Shag 
ity officer left, saying "it's not 
my problem." 
A member of the Security de­partment said Security was not scheduled to staff check­marked course registration and didn't know it was taking place until they received a call early Wednesday evening. Nei­ther Rex Rakow, director of Se­curity, nor Phil Johnson, assis­tant director of Security, could be reached for comment Wed­nesday night. 
Some arts and letters depart­ments reported no problems with checkmark lines Wednes­day. "The students moved along well," said Father Leonard Banas, assistant chairman of the modern and classical languages depart­ment. Professor Stuart Goetz of the philosophy department said the lines there were "very civilized." 
Four Arts and Letters de­partments had "checkmark course forms available in their respective rooms from 7 p.m. ­-8:30p.m.," according to a let­ter mailed to juniors for ad­vance registration. The advance registration letter mailed to students asked stu­dents not to form lines prior to 5:30p.m., but this was ignored by students. 
"We got here at 5:00 and there was a line," said one stu­dent who asked not to be iden­tified. "The people in front are just getting in," she added. "The people at the end got in first."

Boyfriendgirlfriend? 

Or are we 
Love knows no bounds. It also knows no def­initions, no explanations, no logical terms to describe it. Everyone, at one time or another, tries to 
describe whatever relationship he or she might be in, especially if it is a new and previously undefined relationship. 
If you try to avoid description, good luck. "Friends" inevitably force some kind of defi­nition or explanation by asking outright what the situation is. They don't understand that they are forcing you to define the undefinable, ex­plain the inexplicable, give shape to the intan­gible. They just don't realize they are making you state what you more than anything would like to avoid putting into words. 
So, in order not to give the "wrong" answer, the key is to memorize several "right" answers, depending on the situation, and to reel off the answers as though you really analyzed your feelings and knew what you were talking about. 
The questions and corresponding answers usually vary by degree of commit­menVemotional attachment. Beginning with the least commitment: 

 Are you dating? 
This is fairly easy to answer without commit­ting yourself very much. After all, what is "dat­ing?" Maybe going to movies or parties to­gether? Meeting for dinner at the dining hall? Going to more than one SYR with the same person? You are fairly safe in saying "Yeah, I guess we're kind of dating." But to be really safe, stress that you also date other people. 
 Are you seeing each other? 
This doesn't refer to sight, and it asks for a little more commitment than "dating" does. It implies that you are, temporarily at least, somewhat attached to whomever you are "see­ing." It involves more of an emotional commit­ment than merely doing things together--it usually means you like to do things together. But again, to be safe you could add that you'd like to see other people, or that this is just a temporary arrangement. 
 Are you going out? 
Again, this is a little stronger than "seeing each other." Commitment at some level is definitely implied. The person you're going out with can be construed as your boyfriemilgirlfriend, which leads to ... 
 Are you, like, boyfriendgirZfriend? 
This must be asked with a giggle, with "like" always included, and with

just dating? 

"boyfriendgirlfriend" pronounced as one word. It belongs in the same group as "Are you, like, going to the Mall?" and "Dude, like, check out my new skateboard." The best answer you could possibly give is an emphatic "no." Regardless of whether or not you are, like, boyfriendgirlfriend, this is a silly question and attaches a silly label to you. 
Now, to avoid giving a direct answer to any question but to still give some answer so as not to be asked again, you could always give a longer explanation: "Well, we're really good friends and we do alot together and we like to spend time together and we have alot in com­mon" is generally an effective explanation. 
My favorite, for myself, is: "I'm in like." 
The only problem with this one occurs when you begin to pass the like-phase and enter into the serious commitmenVemotional attachment phase. Then. you might have to say the Capital L word, as in "I'm in L ---." 
Then, once you admit that to yourself, you will probably have to admit it to the person you're in L---with. That means saying "I L­
--you." If you've reached this phase, you're on your own. No form answers can guide you now.

Iran mobilizes to face u.s. 
Associated Press 
NICOSIA, Cyprus -Iran began full mobilization Wed­nesday to confront the United States and Iraq, and it fired a missile into Kuwait that repor­tedly fell near a U.S.-run oil­field. Iraq fired missiles into three Iranian cities. 
The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iranian forces killed or wounded 300 Iraqis and captured more than 250 in the Shemiran mountain region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq. 
Iraq claimed its forces were mopping up Iranian pockets of resistance in Iraq's southern Faw peninsula after recaptur­ing the region two years after the Iranians overran it. 
Iraq also said it would stop bombarding Iranian cities beginning at midnight (4 p.m. EDT> as long as Iran did the same, the Iraqi News Agency reported. 
There was no immediate response from Iran. Hundreds have been killed in the ex­changes since Feb. 29 and two cease-fires lasted only a few days. 
After the Iraqi announce­ment but before midnight, Iraq said it fired missiles into Teh­ran, Isfahan and Shiraz. Teh­ran radio reported a strike on Tehran and said civilians were killed. 
The clashes with the U.S. navy and the unexpected Iraqi recapture of the Faw Peninsula -the first major Iraqi offensive in two years-clearly have jolted the Iranians. 
The radio said all volunteers, known as "basij," should report to bases throughout the country "and get ready for departure" to the battlefront. 
The broadcast made no men­tion of numbers, but Iranian leaders have claimed up to 5 million Iranians were trained in the last six months. 
The U.S. navy sank an Iranian patrol boat, crippled two frigates and set two of­fshore oil platforms on fire Monday in the worst clashes with the Iranians since the Navy buildup in July last year to curb Iranian attacks on ship­ping. 
Iranian TV showed a cere­mony in the gulf port of Bus­hehr, where senior military of­ficials lauded the bravery of the crew of the patrol boat Jos­han, which was sunk by the 
U.S. navy. Iran has said 15 of the Joshan's crew were killed and 29 wounded. 
The clashes prompted Lloyd's of London insurers to double their rates on ships traveling to the gulf.

"The students' reaction seemed to be really positive," said Rodgers. "There were some students who weren't ac­tually considering Notre Dame who are considering Notre Dame now." 
Although academic life was emphasized during the weekend, there were several social events, including a mixer, bowling night, and a dinnerAiance. An inter­denominational prayer service was offered in addition to Sat­urday evening Mass. 
All of the visiting students stayed on campus with other minority students currently en­rolled at Notre Dame. "I really believe the perceptions of the students about the professors and the school are the things that are really important," said Ken Durgans, director of minority student affairs. 
Gandy described the stu­dents as, "very good students (and) very intelligent. They had well-prepared questions. It was obvious they were good thinkers." 
"I think the main concern was probably where exactly a minority student fits in at Notre Dame, and what are the sup­port groups and networks available to minority students for both academics and non­academics," said Gandy. 
"I've had some phone calls from those students expressing their appreciation," said Gandy, "I've actually had some students who returned home crying--they actually didn't want to leave."

5:30' rule would have been "counterproductive," said Gernes. She added that she had heard complaints, but that there were no more complaints than usual. 
"No one's gotten hurt," said Gernes. "It's been orderly in terms of behavior." 
But many students still ex­pressed dissatisfaction with the process. 
"It's like the stock market," said junior Greg Kinzelman. "It's not a line, it's an orderly mess."

Stealth bomber is now visible to the public eye 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Air Force, lifting a decade-long veil of secrecy, released pic­tures of its Stealth bomber on Wednesday and said the plane would make its first test flight this fall. 
As disclosed in 1985 by former Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., the flew long-range strategic bomber resembles a big "flying win~ ' with no fuselage in the middle. 
The Stealth bomber, offi­cially designated the B-2, takes its nickname from the fact it is designed to fly without showing up on radar. 
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chair­man of the Senate Armed Ser­vices Committee, predicted the bomber ''will render obsolete billions of dollars of Soviet in­vestment in their current air defense." 
The Air Force said in a state­ment that it was beginning to lift its secrecy surrounding the plane because of the approach of the maiden flight sometime this fall. 
Such details as performance characteristics, crew size and maximum payload remain classified, however, the Air Force said. 
Indeed, some of the details about the plane's design -for ex­ample, the placement of the en­gine exhaust outlets-have been deliberately masked in the art­ist's rendering released Wed­nesday, service sources said. 
The Air Force did acknowl­edge. though, that its cost esti­mate for the Stealth bomber program was now being revised. 
"While the acquisition of 132 B-2 bombers was originally es­timated to cost $36.6 billion in 1981 dollars, the Air Force is re-evaluating cost estimates for the program as a result of current and projected fiscal constraints," it said. 
"When that process is com­pleted later this year, the Air Force will release those up­dated figures." 
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, just last month described as "probably unrealistic" the Air Force's original cost estimate for the B-2. 

The flying wing design has long been the object of ex­perimentation by Northrop. The company flew a propeller­driven version of such a plane, known as the XB-35, in 1946. 
A jet-powered version, the 
Souper 
YB-49, first flew in late 1947 and was tested by the Air Force. But the service never pur­chased any of the planes and experimentation with the prototypes ended by the early 1950s. 
l 

The Northrop Corp., which is building the plane for the Air Force, is known to have suf­fered some overruns and schedule delays, having writ­ten off more than $200 million on the project in recent years.

air force took off shortly before dawn. It is rare for military aircraft to use the civilian Houari Boumedienne airport and there was speculation that some or all the hijackers were aboard. 
Algerian officials would not discuss the flight or its oc­cupants. KUNA quoted Mohammed Taber, a member of the Algerian negotiating team, as saying without elaboration that the hijackers were "still here." 
Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, who led the Algerian mediators, announced the drama's end without giving details and said the fate of the hijackers was the "concern of Algeria" alone.

WASHINGTON -The Senate voted Wednesday to give $20,000 tax-free payments to thousands of Japanese­Americans who were forced from their homes and sent to internment camps during World War II. 
Final passage came on a 69­27 vote after an emotional debate in which senators recalled the sometimes-harsh treatment and financial losses suffered by about 120,000 Japanese-Americans who were interned after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941. 
The bill would require the United States government to apologize for the mass roun­dups and would make each of the estimated 60,000 survivors eligible for $20,000 payments. A similar bill already has passed the House. 
On votes of 67-30 and 61-35, the Senate defeated attempts to strip the bill of the payments, while retaining the apology. It then voted 91-4 to kill an amendment proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to with­hold payments until Japan compensated American families for losses suffered at Pearl Harbor. 
At one point, Sen. Spark Mat­sunaga, D-Hawaii, was brought to tears as he told of an elderly Japanese-American internee being killed by machine-gun fire when he strayed too close to a camp fence. 
But Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R­Wyo., argued that the intern­ment "was not a dishonorable act, it was the option of a nation in the first days of a war." 
Sen. Daniel Inouye, D­Hawaii, a Japanese-American who lost his right arm in com­bat with the Army in Italy, said: "these payments ac­knowledge the unconstitutional deprivation of liberty...and the stigma of being deemed un­loyal." 
Opponents, in addition to ob­jections over the payments, complained about a statement in the bill that the internment "was caused by racial preju­dice, war hysteria and a failure

ND, area researchers work on medical diagnostic tools 
Special to The Observer 
Researchers from the Uni­versity of Notre Dame have joined colleagues from two Chicago-area universities in an interdisciplinary engineering research center that will work to develop healthier and far less expensive medical diag­nostic tools with equal or su­perior capabilities. 
Participating engineers from Notre Dame, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Northwestern University will work together with facutly from several Chicago-area medical schools and teaching hospitals to advance the field of signal and image processing in medicine, according to Robert Gordon, vice president of advanced studies at Notre Dame. 
The Engineering Research Center for Signal and Image Processing and Medical Appli­cations (SIPMA) will have its primary facilities at UIC, he said. The multi-institutional or­ganization of the center will 
provide its  researchers  with  
access to (magnetic  costly resonance  MRI im­ 

aging), CAT Scan, holography and other signal and image pro­cessing (SIP) equipment never available within a single insti­tution. 
According to Anthony Mic­hel, dean-elect of Notre Dame's College of Engineering and Freimann professor of electri­cal engineering, Notre Dame's engineers bring to the effort strengths in signal and imageprocessing and systems con­

The main goal of the center is to develop equipment that will provide physicians and surgeons the clearest and cleanest possible view or image of a section of the body, in three dimensions, with the ability to rotate and to change the viewing angle. It's also con­ceivable, Michel said, that the dosages of radiation or of dyes used with certain equipment may be reduced for otherwise comparable results, which will benefit the patient's well­being. 
An example of SIPMA's goals can be seen in the re­search of Notre Dame's Ruey­wen Liu, professor of electrical engineering. Liu is studying how the processing of ultrasound images might be improved to provide a clear image. If ultrasound images could be improved, Liu said, this diagnostic tool might be used in place of more expensive and less portable CAT Scan equipment, which in the end will make diagnosis more ac­cessible and affordable for the patient. 
Other SIPMA research proj­ects by Notre Dame engineers include studies to improve the sharing of medical information through computer networking by David Cohn, professor of electrical engineering; inves­tigations into the satellite transmission of medical images by Daniel Costello, pro­fessor of electrical engineeri­ng, and research in dis­criminating between relevant and irrelevant information in medical signal and image data reduction.

P.O. Box Q 

SBP responds to criticism 
Dear Editor: 
Under normal circumstances, we would not respond to criticisms rooted in ignorance. However, because the Student Senate for the 1988-89 school year is comprised of new, energetic, intelligent and concerned students, we shall make a special exception by ad­dressing Jeff Woode's letter of April15 criticizing the Student Senate. 
The discussion leading up to a deci­sion whether or not to include seniors' responses in the survey;questionaire for the task force reports on "The Whole Health Use and Abuse of Alcohol" and "Residentiality" was not made in spite of Dr. Murphy's recommendations but rather in light of them. His suggestion was that seniors not be included in the statistical tabulation for fear they may skew the results. Acknowledging this fact, we decided to include them in the 
survey, yet tabulate their results sepa­rately. Thus, we do not consider it "unintelligent, foolish, unreason-able, irrational or lacking in foresight" to make special efforts to collect the opinion of those students who have the most experience and insight into two issues that strike the heart of residence life at Notre Dame, Alcohol and Residentiality. 
We would like to invite you, as well 
as any member of the Notre Dame com­munity, to attend the Senate meetings which are held on Mondays at 6:00p.m. in the Notre Dame room of LaFortune, to discover that those people who you elected "truly do represent the people they say they do." 
Tom Doyle Student Body President Mike Paese Student Body Vice President April19,1988 
SMC  election  
quirks  addressed  
Dear Editor:  

We are writing in response to Miss Rucker's Viewpoint article concerning Saint Mary's elections. As it is true in any situation, there are two sides to every story. We as members of the 1987­88 student government would like to respond to the questions and state" ments submitted by Miss Rucker on Tuesday, April12. 
The 1987-88 student government has faced many challenging issues over the past year including the NDSMC Gay and Lesbian Society, increased student involvement, library hours, AIDS, the Chili Project, date rape and the elec­tions procedures. Anyone could have followed our progress by reading the paper or even asking a representative on student government. 
As for the election in February 1988, the Reilly ticket submitted petitions for a recount and a revote using the correct procedures. Student government ac­cepted these petitions and addressed them immediately. The discrepancy found during the recount did not affect the end result. Mter careful consider­ation and much debate, a typed full page letter from the Election Commit­tee was submitted to the candidates and The Observer as a response to the revote petition. It should be noted that the Election Commissioner cannot con­sider conducting a recount or a revote purely upon a candidate's request until the proper petitions have been officially submitted. The potential for a revote did not occur until5:45 p.m. on Friday, February 26, just as the polls for the run-off election were about to close. 

Members of student government do not believe that making an issue out of the election procedures was an embar­rassment to the school or would make student government a "mockery." We believe that we dealt with the issue in an appropriate manner and handled it in such a way so that it would not have affected the other remaining candi­dates in a negative way. 
The other problems that occurred due to the written form of the election procedures were brought to our atten­tion and have been addressed. We have been discussing rewriting the Saint Mary's Student Government Constitu­tion since January. Members of the Board of Governance, Programming Board and hall and class boards have been aware of this and had the oppor­tunity to submit and voice their opinions as the representatives of the student body. This is their job, is it not? 
On March 22, 1988, the Board of Governance, as outlined in the consti­tution, unanimously adopted the amended constitution. This includes over 20 amendments strictly concern­ing the electoral process. The fact that the 1987-88 student government promptly addressed and rectified the existing flaws in the system shows a desire to uphold the integrity and ideals of Saint Mary's College. We encourage all students to read the new constitu­tion. It is not locked away in a box: It to ask his opinion on all issues? Does she believe this should be the case at Saint Mary's? As a student worker in the Student Activities office, Miss Rucker is well aware of who represents the student body and how the student government system works. Why did she wait until one month before her gradua­tion to voice her words of wisdom? 
Miss Rucker was also aware of and involved in the electoral process in the spring of 1987. If she felt that the elec­tion procedures were such a great in­justice to the members of the Saint Mary's student body, why didn't she attempt to discuss this with a represen­tative on student government earlier? Why didn't she ever attend a Board of Governance meeting to voice her opinions? Why didn't she write a View­point in The Observer prior to the elec­tions so that we could have addressed the issue sooner and made the proper changes? This is a "curious" thing. 
During the upcoming hall elections, we hope students will see evidence of the changes made in the electoral process. The balloting and counting procedures have been corrected and will be efficient. 
We also hope students will see how important their input is. We in student government cannot see all flaws; we need others to help us look at the cur­rent system, evaluate it and make im­provements. 
Finally, we stand by all the decisions made by the 1987-88 student govern­ment because we believe we have ac­cepted challenges and upheld the ideals of our fine institution.

Remembering the spice of life 
W
alking down Michigan Ave­nue after a day of shop­ping last Saturday, one of my friends groaned at the thought of returning to campus, "Back to reality now." 
I groaned as well. but then realized that we were actually leaving one reality and heading made of besides final exams, 
levis and Notre Dame sweat­shirts. and dorm room or off­campus parties. 
Life is made of rude sales ladies at Saks Fifth Avenue who stand between you and a dress insisting that you "please let them help you with anything caught up in all of that though, and then none of it is as worthwhile as it should or could be. 

In the Windy City this weekend, I did a lot of people watching. I checked out what people were wearing and en­
joyed seeing people with their 
own senses of style, wearing 
things few people on this 
campus would dare to wear. I 
overheard conversations, 
laughing along with some and 
taking time to think about 
others. 
I watched as people scurried across the street. laden with groceries or briefcases, seeming anxious to get home and get rid of those things. 
Even though I lost quite a few valuable hours that could have been spent on the gov­ernment paper I ended up writing in the wee hours of Monday morning, my trip to Chicago renewed me. Variety is the spice of life, or so they say, and it's truly amazing what a pinch or two of a change of

It was great to get away from campus this weekend, just to get a breath of fresh air and be reminded of what else life is you would like to see."

Alumnus produces 'Two Moon Junction' 
ZACK HUDGINS 
accent writer 

''T wo Moon Junction" is a new movie due for release in 500 theaters, in 25 .Acities, on Friday, April 29. What makes this movie a little differ­ent from others is that it was produced by a Notre Dame graduate, Donald P. Borchers. Borchers was born In Brook­lyn. N.Y. With the help of a Navy ROTC scholarship he was able to attend Notre Dame. His ROTC scholarship paid for his first three semesters of school from the fall of 1974 to the fall of 1975. In the spring of 1976, he was able to begin paying his own way and left Navy ROTC to the surprise of his commanding officer. "I didn't think I would be able to produce movies in the Navy," said Borchers. He graduated in December of 1977 because he had earned enough credits early, but he is part of the class of 1978. While at Notre Dame, Bor­chers directed himself toward a producing career. He recleved a Bachelor's Degree In busi­ness administration because, according to Borchers, "That's what I was told producers dealt with a lot." At the same time Borchers took classes in cinematography, ballet, drama, writing, and directing so that he would know about every aspect of the industry. "Producers don't need to know exactly how a camera works, but it helps if you know what an f-stop is," he said. 
During the summer of his sophomore year. Borchers got a job as a tour guide in Hawaii and Canada. He did not just show people the sights. In­stead, he would take complete care of the entire tour. He was responsible for every aspect of every tour. 
According to Borchers, "It was as a tour guide that I first realized that I had a knack for getting difficult or impossible jobs done--like when a tour group would arrive and no rooms would be ready for them. That's a producer, the guy who gets it done." 
With the knowledge that he could get things done, Bor­chers attended USC's film school for awhile, and then took a job at Avco Embassy Pictures because he wanted hands-on experience. At Avco, he worked on 17 feature films for three years as executive overseer of expenses. 
Borchers then became an as­sociate producer at Sandy Howard Productions. He also worked as the Senior Vice­President of production and creative affairs at New World Pictures until he formed his own company, Planet Produc­tions Corporation. With his new company, Borchers put to­gether the deals that created the movies, "Vamp," "Tuff Turf," "Children of the Corn," "Angel," and the controversial "Crimes of Passion." The last movie almost received an X­rating. 
As producer, Borcher over­sees everything involved in a movie. Directors, salaries, in­plete for that day, and thus will not give you an extension. 
Life is taking a horse-and­carriage ride through down­town Chicago on a warm spring evening and waiting over two hours just to get into the Hard Rock Cafe for a good hamburger. 
Life is sidewalk musicians 
teams. Life is the impatience that engulfs people as they wait for an elevator and then push to get a place in it, not letting the riders get off first. Life is people dressed up as lobsters handing out flyers for seafood restaurants. Life is playing softball at a family reunion. Life is attend­ing the symphony dressed to the hilt. Life is walking your dog and smiling at the old men playing checkers. Life is writing all those letters and thank you notes which get put off. Life is getting together for a cup of coffee with that person you always put off, thinking there will always be time later. We all have many responsi­bilities here at school with our classes, activities, and plans for the future. It's too easy to get 

Nothing new with 
M!ghty Lemon Drops 
vestors, and distribution are 
only a few of the many aspects 
with which Borchers must deal 
on each of his pictures. He 
does not have a real favorite 
aspect of all this work, but 
said, "They're all about even in 
my mind, each with good 
points and bad points." 
"Two Moon Junction" is Bor­
chers' sixth production. It is 
written and directed by Zalman 
King, writer of "9 1J2 weeks." 
"We got an R-rating on this 
movie, which is good," said 
Borchers. The new movie will 
contain very steamy sex scenes 
as did both "9 1J2 Weeks" and 
"Crimes of Passion." 
The plot of the movie is pretty basic. A beautiful Sherilyn Fenn stars as April. the bethrothed southern belle, sorority queen who is drawn to Richard Tyson, a carnival ride operator. The relationship is completely taboo. Despite warnings against their liaison, they cannot keep their passions for one another quiet. 
Although it has a relatively simple plot. the movie will be brought to life under the direc­tion of King and the director of photography, Mark Plummer. Plummer made Robbie Neville's video "C'est La Vie" which caught the eye of Borchers. Borchers had to get a green card for Plummer to work in this country after he convinced Plummer to do the movie. "Plummer has a true love for the camera," said Borchers. 
With such a motivator behind "Two Moon Junction" as Bor­chers, the movie is bound to be a hit.

1\ new album has recently nheen released by The Mighty Lemon Drops. The group, originally called the Sherbet Monsters, hails from London, where, In 1986, they created huge waves on the 6rltlsh underground music. seene. In England, national underground charts are compiled biweekly, and it is a big deal to make the charts, especially If the group does not have an al­bum out. 
In 1986, their single, "Like An Anget" pushed The Mighty Lemon Drops to number one. Their sound back then was harder and inevitably more raw than their current sound. Now, they sound like a slightly weaker version of Echo (!( the 6unnymen. 
If I had to pick one adjec­tive to describe this album it would be this: boring. The redeeming factor of this World Wtthout End LP Is the first cut and first released single "Inside Out." It's really a very good song. catchy, with a good drum 
li i beat. tfltd Marsh's vocals come tt1ro1,1gh \'len ln this bright pop song,' It's too bad' The Mighty Lemon Drops can't readt this height again on their new LP. World Without End Is the group's third release. In 1986, Happy Head hit the 
LP Is probably its best so far. These early songs con­tain an energy and an over­all sound which are ab· solutely gripping. 1987 brought Out Of Hand, really only important for its won­derful title track, which stayed on the college charts In the United States all sum· mer and fall. That trend of one "big hit" per album seems to continue here on World Without End, also released on Sire Records. 
,The ten songs are, for the most part. of medium tempo and medium talent. "Hear Me Call" is pretty good, but songs like "In Everything You Do" are more typical of this LP. On this track. a droning tempo is topped by uninventive lyrics and uninspired vocals by Marsh. Just when the lis· tener is ready to turn off the turntable, the song simply cuts. It's as if the band too, has realized that the song Is going nowhere and just Wa.nts to end it, but doesn't exactly know where to do it. Pretty weak. 
The Mighty Lemon Drops create a sound which ls at times fresh and upbeat. They don't exactly break any new ground with this new album, so when you listen to it, don't listen with high expectations or anything. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate The Mighty Lemon Drops. I just don't like them.

Junior Mohan more than just par for the course 
By CHRIS FILLIO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame golf team will travel to East Lansing, Mich., this weekend to partici­pate in the Spartan Invitational tournament at Forest Ackers West Golf Course. 

After a less than satisfying performance under adverse weather conditions at the Scar­let Course in Columbus, Ohio, this past weekend, the Irish linksters will seek to rebound. 
Setting the pace for the Irish will be junior Pat Mohan. In his second year as a member of the Gold Team, the California native leads the team with a 
77.8 stroke average. 
"Pat has been a very consis­tent player this year for the team," said Irish head coach Noel O'Sullivan. "His course management and mental ap­proach to the game is outstand­ing." 
In the combined fall-spring season to date, Mohan has scored below 80 in fourteen out of twenty-two rounds. He has also garnered the low round of the season, a 71 to open the 

Cavanaugh a leg up in IH baseball 
By THERESA KELLY Assistant Sports Editor 
Interhall baseball continues this week with its 1988 double elimination tournament. Four teams have been eliminated from the tourney, which began with 16 teams. 
Of the 12 teams remaining in contention, the Bandits of Cavanaugh have the inside track at the winner's bracket title. The Bandits will play the winner of the Holy Cross game with Morrissey, while the loser of that game goes into the final rounds of the loser's bracket. 
Nine teams are hanging on to their Interhall title hopes in the loser's bracket, including Alumni, whose captain, Bill ZadeH wants another chance to beat Off-Campus Crime, also in the loser's bracket. 
"They've got some good hit­ters," ZadeH said of the team that pushed them into the loser's frame. "We'd like an­other shot at them. We didn't hit well against them. We have a lot of young players, and we're still getting used to playing baseball again." 
It will be a long road for both 
teams if they are destined to 
play again. 
ZadeH's Alumni squad first 
faces Stanford A Friday at 
4:30. Carroll and Flanner 1 play at 10:00 AM on Saturday, and the winners of those two con­tests play on Monday. 
In the next loser's bracket section, the winner of the St. Joe's-Off Campus game will take on either Stanford B or Pangborn, who play today at 4:30 The winners of those two games play Saturday, and the victor in that contest will play the remaining loser's bracket competitor, Zahm.

Purdue Invitational in helping the Irish to a third-place finish. 
"At Purdue, it was the first time in a while that it all came together for us," said Mohan. "We're certainly capable of playing like that." 
However, things did not al­ways run so smoothly for Mohan. As a beginner at around age ten, Mohan had family support although he was the first in the family to really take a serious interest in the game. Upon entering high school, Mohan was forced to make an important decision. 
"I had already started playing in golf tournaments at about age thirteen," said Mohan. "But when I got to high school, I had to choose between golf and baseball because in California they are both in the same season." 
Mohan achieved numerous honors and distinctions throughout his golf career at Mission Viego High School. He earned all-league honors for all four years, lettering each year and captain the last two. As a junior he was voted league MVP and subsequently fol­lowed that up by guiding the team to a league title his senior year with a 74-stroke average. 

When it came time for choos­ing a college, Mohan was some­what unsure. 

Pat Mohan 

"I had plans to play golf at Colorado, but I was also on the waiting list at Notre Dame," stated Mohan. "I finally got in here ffild fulfilled my lifelong dream." 
For head coach O'Sullivan, it has been a dream come true as well. Freshman year was un­kind to Mohan as he struggled on the links and failed to make the cut on the Irish squad. But

that only served as a motive to work harder for Mohan. Last year he made the cut shot a season-low 73 on four separate occasions. In addition to this, Mohan added three medalist or runner-up performances in his first year with the Irish Gold 
Team. 
"Pat's coolness and emo­tional stability makes him the player that he is," commented O'Sullivan. "He's a pure player, and definitely one of the best players skillwise that I've had on the team. The greatest part of his game is that he is able to visualize the shot beforehand, and he will hit the good shot under pressure. This is what makes him a step above the regular players." 
Mohan has continued his con­sistent play this spring, turning in three medalist perfor­mances and finishing 13th over­all at the Eastern Kentucky In­vitational. Along with these honors, both Mohan and senior captain Dick Connelly are serious contenders for Aca­demic All-Americans this year. 
Lately Connelly and juniors Mohan and Doug Giorgio have provided solid play at the top three positions, while fresh­man Paul Nolta holds on to the fourth spot. This weekend for the Spartan Invitational, the call to travel as the fifth man went to sophomore Bobby Kloska. The Elkhart, Ind., na­tive will hope to contribute from the fifth spot which has been a problem area all year for the relatively young Irish team. 
"Because of his per­severence and loyalty, he's a welcome addition to the Gold Team," said O'Sullivan. "Bobby Kloska has an excel­lent golfing background. He is very excited about this weekend. There will be a whole new chemistry this weekend at the Spartan." 
A high finish in East Lansing could provide the spark the Irish need to rejuvenate them­selves as they wind down reg­ular season play. Once again, the Irish will look to Pat Mohan to score well as he has all season.

Second was the trip to Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium that I took last sum­mer to watch the Braves lose to the Cardinals. In two short games, I experienced memories that will last a lifetime: watching Dion James play a pretty mean game of dodgeball in centerfield, seeing Graig Nettles step to the plate three times with the bases loaded and two out, and ac­complish the amazing task of getting no RBI, being aston­ished as to how knowledgable the Fulton County crowd was (particularly one man behind me who yelled, "That's why they're in first place," after a Cardinal player homered), watching the Brave caps that were on sale for $5 when I bought one suddenly go for $4 after Atlanta lost two straight, all these precious moments are too numerous to mention. 
But the biggest thing that I have noticed is how watching the Braves has helped my out­look on life. I often have con-

sidered myself the optimistic sort, and upon reflection I know the Braves helped cause that. 
Yankee fans were dis­satisfied with Bucky Dent at shortstop; Braves fans wonder who was the best Atlanta shortstop of our generation (nominees include Pat Rock­ett, Luis Gomez, Pepe Frias, Rafael Ramirez and Andres Thomas). Red Sox fans say that Jim Rice grounds into too many double plays; Braves fans have grown up thinking Jeff Burroughs, Willie Mon­tanez and Garry Matthews were godlike figures. 
Fans of pennant-contending teams spent their summers worrying their lives away, but Braves rooters could sit and relax. We had nothing to worry about because we knew our team would lose. I'm going to have a fun summer watching the Braves get manhandled and comapring this year's squad to other also-ran Atlanta squads of the past. 

I realize that fans of pennant­winning teams could not imag­ine cheering for the Braves to be fun, but you must under­stand that I'm used to summers like this. I guess it would be harder to endure if you hadn't gone through summers like this 
before.  - 
So  relax,  Orioles  fans.  It  
really  does  get  fun  after  a  
while.

Sophomores continue to bolster ND lax attack 
By PETE LaFLEUR Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team takes their 9-2 record on the road today as they travel to Ohio for games against pos­sibly their easiest and toughest back-to-back opposition of the season. 
The Irish play Wittenburg today in Springfield and then travel to Granville for a game Saturday against Ohio Wes­leyan. Notre Dame routed Wit­tenburg 26-1last year and holds a 5-0 series advantage over the Tigers. The Irish weren't so fortunate last season against Ohio Wesleyan, falling 17-5 to the Battling Bishops. The Bis­hops hold a 7-0 series lead over the Irish and are among the top 10 teams in the nation. 
The Irish will continue their quest towards their first 10-win season. The team was denied that goal last Saturday when Denison snapped Notre Dame's seven-game winning streak with a 14-6 win. 
To obtain that tenth victory the Irish will continue to rely on contributions from many players. Sophomores Brian McHugh and Mike Quigley are two players who could play a significant role in this weekend's games, according to head coach Rich O'Leary. 
Quigley shuttles in on the team's second midfield line and is one of only six players to have played in every quarter this year. He leads the team in ground balls with 46 and had a team-high 10 verses Kenyon. Quigley is seventh on the team in scoring with eight goals and three assists, but has been hin­dered by a .163 shooting percentage. 
"Mike has contributed as much as any sophomore. He's been a threat on offense al­though his statistics don't show it," O'Leary said. 
"Mike's a real stabilizing force in our midfield and we're just waiting for him to have a big game. He'll be one of the people we'll count on in the fu­ture." 
McHugh, meanwhile, is a starting attackman and is the team's second leading scorer with 18 goals, 11 assists and a .327 shooting percentage. He is also one of the team leaders in groun'd balls, with 35 for the season. 
"Brian has been a real surprise considering that he had limited playing time last year. From the beginning he has showed a lot of maturity and confidence in working in the offense," O'Leary said. 

"Brian complements (team scoring leader) John Olmstead very well and, although he's not the star, he still contributes a great deal to the team con­cept." 
Dave Carey, classmate of Quigley and McHugh, has been

Hutson, Irish baseball 
By THERESA KELLY Assistant Sports Editor 
Don't try to cheat Tim Hut­son. 
"I'm a power hitter," the Irish first baseman says. "I'm not going to get cheated at the plate. If I strike out, I strike out, but I'm going to take my cuts." 
Hutson has taken his cuts to the tune of a school-record 12 home runs, and he also leads the team in runs batted in. Hut­son came through in last weekend's series against Detroit with two homers, one a grand slam to put the score at 8-11 and spark the Irish to one of their patented come-from­behind wins. 
"The Detroit series was really great for me," says Hut­son, a senior from battle Creek, Mich. "They were im­portant games. I had two home runs and a game-winner. It was a good series for the team." 
This season has shown a marked improvement in Hut­son's consistency. A .224 hitter at Notre Dame coming into this season, he has held his average around .350 this season. 
"Tim has been a mainstay for us," says Irish coach Pat Murphy. "The book on him is that he's inconsistent, but he's been just the opposite. He's been so consistent. He has had a fantastic season." 
Hutson came to Notre Dame as a freshman not knowing what to expect from the Irish program.

Fond memor1es of America's Team ... the Braves 
It's about that time again. 

In just a couple of weeks, I will be returning to my hometown of Tallahassee, Fla., for another summer full of fun. For me, summer with my friends in good ol' Tallytown means three things: 
1) Watching too many lousy movies on the VCR (Has anyone seen Night of the Comet or Grease 2 lately?) 
2) Wondering how we could possibly live in Florida when the nearest decent beach is almost two hours away. 
3) And last, but certainly not least, is following Atlanta Braves baseball. 
Yup, if it's starting to warm up here in South Bend, you know the empty seats at Atlanta Fulton­County Stadium are getting hot. And while you may take a look at the current National League standings and think I'm in for a long summer, then you're missing out on the real beauty of following my beloved Bravos. 
True Braves fans know their team is bad. Heck, the Atlanta Braves were born bad. Except for a couple of inexplicable mistakes in 1969 and 1982, the Braves have been models of consistency for their ineptitude. Harold Baines drives in 90 runs every year; the Braves lose 90 games every year. 
And my friends and I have been there through it all. Before our Wigwam Warriors became "America's Team" on Super Station WTBS, and the Braves played on an Atlanta cable station named WTCG, we tuned in to watch Darrell Chaney, Mike Lum, Vic Correll, et al., bumble their way through the summer. 
Eventually, WTBS started going nationwide on 

Steve Megargee 
Assistant Sports Editor 

cable, and people all across the country could watch the Braves. Not that anyone did, mind you, but they did have the opportunity. 
It was about this time that the Braves earned the moniker "America's Team." Let's be real. If I make a trip out to Walla Walla and head for the nearest sports bar I don't think I would see a bunch of people eating apple pie and cheering on the Braves (unless they were distant relatives of Dale Murphy himself). Anyone who has seen the empty seats at Fulton-County Stadium knows they aren't even Atlanta's Team. But that's beside the point. 
Growing up with the Braves added character to our lives. Those who didn't watch the old-time Braves of the late 1970's really do not know the memories they missed out on.
