Student Senate cuts SU budget to $35,000 
This year's Student Union Budget is set at $35,000, act;or­ding to Brien Nagle, Student Union Comptroller. This is an increase of $12,000 from last year's budget, but it includes a $14,000 allottment for the new Cultural Arts Commission in the Student Union, including the Sophomore Literary Festival, . the Collegiate Arts Festival and 
Cinema 71. 
The orginal budget was esti­
mated at $43,000 and trimmed 
to $37,000 by the Finance Com­
mittee of the Student Union. 
The Student Senate made a fur­
ther budget cut of $2000, taking 
$1000 from the Sophomore 
Literary Festival and the Aca­
demic Commission. 
The five parts of the Student 
Union, Administration, Social ·Commission, Academic Commis­sion, Cultural Arts Commission and Services each receive a year­ly budget according to the ex­penditures that are expected for the school year. In some cases, one commission may run at a loss while another may run at a profit, thus balancing out the 
budget as far as possible. 
The Administration budget 
this year is $4200, a decrease of 
$1200 from last year due to the 
fact that 1 secretary rather than 
2 is being employed this year. 
The Social Commission, 
which lost $2000 last year, is 
expected to make a profit of 
$300 this year due to the un­
usually good profits from con-

certs so far. 
The Academic Commission is 
budgeted at $19,000 this year 
from $16,000 last year. The 
increase is expected to be made 
up by profits from the Social 
Commission as well as an allott­
ment from St. Mary's College. 
The Services Commission, in-eluding Publications and Press, expects to break even. Publica­tions prints the Observer with a revenue of $16,000 but this re­sponsibility will be removed when the printing machines are sold to the newspaper and it does its own printing. Press is concerned with advertising and xerox work and has cut its staff from nine to six employees. 
Nagle was satisfied with the final budget. terming the Fin­ance Committee adjustments as "justifiable cuts." However, he thought the Senate cuts on the Academic Commission and the Sophomore Literary Festival will "cut down on the program they will be able to offer." 
Last week the Student Union Board approved the expendi­tures of the Union so far this. year, finding that the Student Union has spent Jess than one­third of its budget, although the year is more than one-third over. The Board members are Prof. John Houck, Rev. Thomas Blantz and Union Director Bob Pohl.he product being advertised in this case is strictly for whites only which in turn raises some interesting issues. 


City bears down on film 
(continued from page 1) 
stores to uncover pornography. 
They feel that the film "He and 
She" is obscene and that it is 
substantial evidence to bring 
charges in court against the Cine­
ma Art Theatre. 
Mrs. Prickett was not in her . office but her secretary spoke 
the city on the situation. She stated that "the pornography law itself is confusing, and this makes the situation difficult. The mayor has communicated on many. occasions with the citizens of Mishawaka and they have expressed a low opinion of the theatre. They also showed objections to the ~inema Art's existence and to the obscenity circulating among young peo­ple". 
Mishawaka didn't try to close the theatre for obscenity pre­viously because they felt that their evidence was not porno­graphic enough to merit a favor­able court decision. They city now feels that this material is definitely illegally bbscene.

"No country is free where the public offi­cials are too cowardly or too corrupt to protect the fundamental rights of loyal and law-abiding citizens."

Closing the Door on the Crypt 
They're closing the Crypt, and it's really too bad. Tile Crypt provided a genuine service to the students; it was fun to get a decent price on a record, while it lasted. But when everyone went over to the Crypt, nobGdy went over to Hammes Notre Dame and paid their outrageous prices. As a result, the University lost money. 
It's hard to believe that this ninety million dollar campus has trouble scraping together enough money to make ends meet, but it's true. This University's financial status has long been a dibilitating feature in its attempt to expand. And the present debt stands yet to be reckoned with. 
So the University, out of a harsh necessity, is shylocking a lot of students in a lot of little ways, which is a whole lot better than getting all students in one big way -like bigger campus-wide tuition increases. It is, in fact, things like Hammes Notre Dame's enormous profit that allows the University to get away with as low a tuition as it has so far. 
So the Crypt must go, a monument to the constant reminder that circumstance can force upon this Catholic university the first of the three Priestly virtues, if not the other two. 

Let Them Have Their Dirty Movies 
The city of Mishawaka, not without some Messianic zeal, has apparently decided to prosecute the manager of the notable Cinema Art Theatre for showing tht~ allegedly obscene movie, "He and She". 
No one in his right mind is prepared to argue that "He and She"-or most anything shown at the Cinema Art -is a signigicant contribution to Western Culture. It is surely a form of vicarious fornication, an exercise consistent with man's state since the fall of Adam. So be it. 
Far more ominous than the movie's presence is the action of the city government. For in attempting lu prohibit the movie's showing and to fine the Theatre's management, the city has set itself up as a corporate judge of questions of intensely personal standards. The city is -highhandedly and arbitrarily -attempting to deny a whole selection of derelicts their principal form of entertainment. And the derelicts are citizens, just like you or us or Father Hesburgh or the Mayor of Mishawaka. They obey laws and pay taxes and serve in the army, and they should be eligible for whatever perversion the Cinema Art has to offer. 
The Observer,then, hopes that the city's case will be thrown out of court. It is especially imortant that the Cinema Arts be left alone during this particular period of time. The football season will soon be over, and without their dirty movies, many fine young Notre Dame men will be forced to visit wakes and the like for their entertainment.

John Barkett 

t==~====:=::::::::::=====

IOn the Abolition 1 of the Senate 
The following is the third in a series ofarticles written by people in
t 
and associated with student government about the proposed new con­stitution. Mr. Barkett is the chairman of the Hall President's Cou­
t 
ncil and President ofMorrissey Hall. 
t t 
t The main issue in the proposed Student Government Constitution is the replacement of the Senate with a councilt made up of hall presidents, one off-campus representative, and lh<! Studenb Body President who would serve as Chairman. The
t 
Observer has asked me to comment on this facet of the t Constitution, and in doing so. I wish to focus on three points. 
t 
t 
First of all, do the Presidents have the time? The answer to this 
t 
question reflects on the Senate's functions which -outside of the t budget -are really nothing. Some claim research, others claim a legislative function, but if one examines the reality of thet situation, the Senate's "functions" can be handled easily by Student Government committees and the new council with little 
t 
loss of time. Even tile budget question could be solved with a more efficient distribution of the Finance Committee's recommendations to the council.members so they could examine t what they would be voting on. 
t 
t Secondly, some claim that the Constitution merely transfers functions to a different body solving absolutely nothing. On thet contrary, I think it will solve a great deal of problems. 
t 
t 
It will eliminate an election; recognize Hall Presidents who are in the best positions to effect change around here; and bring the Student Body President closer to the halls than he ever has been 
before. 

t 
t 
t 
Lastly, I think some students are getting hung up on "power plays," on institutions, on "centralization," etc. when they refer 
t 
t 
to the abolition of the Senate. They claim that the manpower of SO students is lost. They claim a voice of the students is silenced. Just what "power" is everyone talking about? And if students are 
t 
that interested in helping, I assure you that "manpower" will do t more good improving life in the hall for themselves and their neighbors. As for the ''voice" there is the Scholastic, WSND, andt the Observer; there are hall presidents, the Student Body Preisdent and countless others to complain to and suggest to; 
t 
there are numerous Administrators who will listen -what I mean is if someone has something to say, it can easily be done without 
a Senate. Again, if one is realistic about the campus situation, onet will see that the issues of importance at Notre Dame aside from academics are centered around hall life, around people -yourt frien'ds and mine. 
t 

t 
The proposed constitution has been late in coming and there 
are some minor complaints I have about it; however, the directiont towards the halls the Constitution is taking, 1 feel, merits itst passage in the upcoming referenrl11m

All these tired words, pulled slow like a knife through· cheese, heavy like a walk in the marshy woods, sure do frustrate me. They won't kick ass. They are blind. 
Old October has stretched, coughing out old leaves and spitting much rain, into a strangely mild November, which the wind pushes toward December and snow. I am waiting for snow, but it hasn't come. I have only worn gloves a few times; the cold has not yet come. I have 
left my wondow open so the air could winnow and cure the dust and black paint carpentry smells that sit inside my house. I have not worn a hat in months, but probably mostly because I lost my hat. It was a good hat and worth wearing; an Australian bush hat (a real one) with the 
brim down flat 'cause I don't like 'em buttoned on the side. (Ain't no-heavy Rat Patrol digger dude.) Anyway it is Decem­ber and l am waiting for snow. Waiting for it to slide down, clean and slow and whirling, from a gray sky fat with douds. Something mystic about a first snow: the way the snow cases down wet and white and then disappears: watery on the 
ground. Seems like the ground docsn 't 
like being covered. It fights the snowfall, feel good and I see the squirrels and changing the snow endlessly into familiar twisty, fallen branches; moss, trees, wild water, but it never wins the fight. It .~lways gets covered and then it t'alls flowers, bugs and berries. Perhaps I will asleep, grunting periodically, drinking climb a tree and just watch the woods for occasionally during sporadic sun rages, a day or days, seeing things that it is 
but mostly just laying lazy accepting the impossible to write about. Seeing things.

MUNICH-Have you ever sat in the Munich train-station? Try it sometime, my friend. I have been travelling for the past three weeks and 1 figure at least four or five solid days have been spent in that stolid, stodgy mon­ument to man's habitual but inadequacy. I slept there one night, too. In front of the door to the so-called "Catholic Rail­road-Station-Mission." They are extremely Christian at the mis­sion--almost as Christian as the Notre Dame Community--they have a very warm and comfor­table sitting room for those who have no place to stay in the city. There is only one hitch: only women and children are allowed inside. and that is why I was sleeping in the doorway. 
Actually, you don't have to sit in the Munich train-station per se. I suppose that any train­
station will do. It's just that l happ·~ned to be sitting in Mun­ich's pride when I came to the realization that there is no God in the Munich train-station. I was sitting there late at night 
Lowenstein needs_ help 40,000 dollar debt 
Allard Lowenstein returned to Notre Dame on Sunday, November 22, to repay his "greatest political debt which is, of course, to Notre Dame." 
Ironically speaking on the seventh anniversary of the assassination of John 
F. Kennedy, he spoke of " ... an enormous resurgence of hope and not a sense of despair." Thankful for the phenomenal support of the dedicated young, he reminded the 35 Notre Dame -St. Mary's volunteers that we are the new political force, " ... the future belongs to us." 
In light of his Senior Fellow Award, (one of many "late-at-nights"), watching the weirdos do their "tricks" and thinking. "If one of you comes near me I'll punch you right in the mouth." Then I looked, and I mean I really took a good look, at the grey walls and the grey people and the greyness inside my heart. I real­ized that there was so little Christ in that edifice--impersonal 
people selling tickets  to  places  
that  were  but  names  to  them,  
serving  people  that  must  be  

quite annoying, judging from. their reactions to them, with all their questions--the faces change day after day, but the questions remain essentially the same; the pairs of men all over the station eagerly e¥eing _the lone_ women walking through; and, finally, the drunks. Those spiritually and economically poor creatures who continually remind us of failure. The police at the :Munich train-station, like their colleagues all the world over, regularly roust the sleeping, all­b u t-unconcious fellows from their unrestful resting-places, put

(Zappasian monotone, some weird snake voice crawls eerie into my ear: "Maybe, if I concentrate real hard, I can time warp and then I'll be real secure like I'd just fixed the seats so they'd tilt backwards. and t;;ken my jelly-roll gumdrop to the root beer stand. HOTCHA!") 
I am not at Notre Dame, but in the forest of Northern Wisconsin, crunching dry leaves under my feet, carrying a picnic basket, an old wooden one. I sing, in my tuneless, growl-aaargh voice, an old song from the air. I just open my mouth and the song rushes in, does some woodsy

them on their feet, and take them out~ide the doors of the train-station until the police leave. Having played the game that far, the human derelicts return, only to kick off another half about an hour later. and, as in any game, there is an audi­ence. I wonder why we always smile at drunks. Is it because. we do not wish to consider them seriously, as people who need help-our help? Seeing this dis­dainful display of mild heartless­ness in my fellows made me see the same in myself. I suddenly realized that I was sitting there, judging the "weirdos~' and all the others, when I should have been trying to understand. Just as I found that there was no God in that train station, I found that there was, at that moment, too 
little  Christ  in  myself.  Which

wonder how often we listen 



Guess wllat 's cMttl? 
to that woice within us that speaks of justice and love. I wonder if we, all of us, perhaps place our values elsewhere, where they so little belong. We must reorient ourselves, and choose a new direction. The path is well-marked for us, and our destination has been staked out by the Tom Dooleys, Albert Schweitzers, Dr. Kings, and John Kennedys of our history. We must choose the path that is broad enough for our brothers as well as ourselves, the path where all men can join hands and go forward to their common desti­nation, a place where they can speak together without having to raise their voices. It is that effort that must be continued, or we 
shall soon find ourselves at the end of our personal and national histories. Let history record, if not that we as a people suc­ceeded in solving the common miseries of man-poverty, injus­
tice, ignorance, disease and the 
malaise of misunderstanding, then at least that we tried. 
I just wrote about the dere­licts of the world's train-stations continually reminding us of fail­ure. Perhaps I should clarify that by saying that they remind us of our failures, as well as theirs. Anyone who has watched people laugh at them, or watched the big brave men all but assault those women who are either 
-brave enough or foolish ertough to walk through stations at night alone, anyone who has seen the fights, anyone who has seen the people who laugh too loud, drink and eat too much and live too little stumbel aboard their trains, and, finally, anyone who has looked inside himself and found that he has been listening too much to his fears and too little to his heart, will know what I mean. For they shall have "sat in the Munich train­
station."

Dr. Lawrence Baldinger succumbs to leukemia 
Dr. Lawrence H. Baldinger, associate dean of the University of Notre Dame's College of Science and a faculty member at the University for 37 years, died shortly after noon Saturday (Nov. 28) in St. Joseph Hospital of leukemia. He was 63. 
Born in Galion, Ohio, on Jan­uary 12, I 907, Baldinger was awarded pharmaceutical chemist and bachelor of science degrees by Western Reserve University in 
NOTRE DAME AVE 
I 928-29 and received his master of science degree from Notre Dame in I 931. Two years later he joined Notre Dame's depart­ment of pharmacy and was made its head in !lJ33. The pharmacy department was absorbed into the department of chemistry in 1939. 
1n I 941 , Baldinger was named assistant dean of the College of Science, acting dean in 1942 and dean of the College in 1943. He was dean until 1960 and during this time he also served as advi­sor to pre-medical students at Notre Dame, a capacity in which he continued as associate d~an and head of the department of pre-professional studies.

If General Electric 
can build an electric tractor, why can't they build an 

electric car? 
General Electric is marketing a 
14-horsepower rechargeable electric 
tractor capable of speeds up to 7 
miles an hour. 
We think it's a remarkable 
innovation. But an electric car it's not. 
As a garden tractor for home 
use, Elec-Trak(r can take advantage of 
characteristics that would be distinct 
disadvantages in an electric car. 
The availability of fuel is no 
problem for Elec-Trak. It's designed 
for limited use near electrified 
structures, making overnight 
recharging possible. 
The heavy weight of the 
battery, which would slow down a 
car, means greater applied traction 
for Elec-Trak. 
Because Elec-Trak must travel at slow speeds to do its jobs, there , are no aerodynamic energy losses to take into consideration. 
Still, one might expect Elec-Trak to be the forerunner of a pollution­free automobile. Perhaps it is. But there are many crucial problems left to be solved. 
The most important one, of course, is the development of a substantially better electric battery. Any car built today would be severely limited in range and performance, and probably prohibitively expensive. 
General Electric is making progress on new batteries, but there's a long way yet to. go. 
We've experimented with zinc­air batteries. Sodium-sulfur batteries. Silver-zinc batteries. Lithium­halogen batteries. And others. There are problems with all of them. Problems of Iife-span, cost, practicality. 
Despite the problems, General Electric scientists and engineers are working for the breakthrough that will make electric cars possible. 
Maybe the breakthrough is closer than we think. But we'll 

GENERAL,~~ ELECTRIC 
continue to work and leave the predictions to someone else. 
Why are we running this ad? 
We're running this ad, and others like it, to tell you the things General Electric is doing to solve the problems of man and his environment today. 
The problems concern us becau~e they concern you. We're a business and you are potential customers and employees. 
But there's another, more important reason. These problems will affect the future of this country and this planet. We have a stake in that future. As businessmen. And, simply, as people. 
We invite your comments. Please write to General Electric, 570 Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022. 
dreds of undergraduates who la­ter became physicians were counseled by Baldinger and many of them wrote him during his recent illness. In 1950 he was given Notre Dmae's lay faculty a ward for distinguished service to the University. 
A full professor of chemistry, his specialty was organic chemis­try and he did extensive research on the oil of peppermint, much of it carried out at Purdue Uni­veristy during the summers of 1937 to 1941 for the U.S. De­partment of Agriculture in co­operating with Purdue's horticul~ ture department. He was also a member of the Academic Coun­cil at Notre Dame and secretary of the University Faculty Board in Control of Athletics. 
He published articles in the journals of the American Chemi­cal Society, the American Phar­maceutical Association and the Drug and Cosmefic !ndustry. 
Survivors include his wife, Helen; three sons, Lawrence, Jr., Jackson, Mich., James, Belmont, Calif., and Charles, South Bend; and a daughter, Mrs. Bernardo D'Almeida, Portugal. 

Funeral arrangements are with the Hickey Funeral Home, 2709 Lincolnway West. A funeral Mass was said at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday at Sacred Heart Church, and the wake .began at 7 p.m. Sunday at the funeral home. 

ROTC proves ococlemic need 
The increasing importance of advanced education for officer personnel in American armed forces is evident in graduate en­rollment figures released today by University of Notre Dame Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) units. 
Eighty per cent of the officers assigned to the Army, Air Force or Navy ROTC units on the earn pus are pursuing graduate degrees in their off-duty hours, according to Col. M.M. Staples, commanding officer and pro­fessor of naval science. All told, 37 officers from the four bran­

ches of military service, either assigned to one of the three Notre Dame units or on a leave of absence from their respective services, are advancing their aca­demic qualifications. 
It is expected that all officers assigned to the campus units will be engaged in some phase of graduate work in the spring se­mester of I 971, Col. Staples said. 
Graduate degrees sought range from an MA in sociology to a Ph.D. in aeronautical engineer­ing. 
Thirty per cent of the degrees sought are in the area of inter­national relations and foreign afffairs. A similar number are involved in the combined busi­ness administration-engineering 
program, while the remainder cover a wide range of subject matter, including history, law and education.
