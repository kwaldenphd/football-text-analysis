in the audience later protested these facts. recounting from his own experience girls who had had abortionsand had later com­mitted suicide. Dr. Shriever re­minded him of the many sui­cides by those refused abortion, and related that a number of British investigations disclosed that only between zero and 30 per cent of the women who have abortions have any guilt feelings. 
The last speaker, Dr. Thomas Paulson of Zero Population Growth, told that the goal of that organization is to stabilize the growth rate. Pointing out that a small but affluent group can create more waste than alar­ger impoverished class, he called for something to be done now on a voluntary basis before con­ditionsof overcrowding and pollution approach calamity and the state must intervene in the area of birth control. H·~ said that he regarded abortion not as a way to control population, but as a backup to other methods of contraception. 
"Morality," said Dr. Paulson, "corries to be a reJative matter. The right of the fetus to be born must be balanced against its right to be born into a family that wants it and is able to pro­vide it witli certain material good. Unwanted children turn out to have more moral and 
psychological  problems  than  a  
comparable  child  born  into  a

(UP!) -Film star Jane Fonda was arrested Tuesday after she allegedly kicked and slapped a policeman and screamed "get out of here, you pig." 
Miss ronda was taken to the Cuyahoga County jail on a war­rant signed by U.S. Commis­sioner Clifford E. Bruce charging her with smuggling and assault. 
It was reported vials of pills were found in her luggage when she arrived by plane at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. 
Patrolman Robert Piper, who assisted airport customs agent Richard Matuszak in the arrest, said Miss Fonda slapped him in the face and kicked him. 
The actress was represented 

by Mark Lane, Boston attorney who wrote "Rush to Judgment", which was severely critical of the investigation into the assassina­tion of President John F. 
Kennedy. 
Lane said Miss Fonda was on 
a tour of colleges and univer­
sities in the U.S. and Canada to 
speak against the war in Indo­
china. 
"Because of this she is har­
rassed by the authorities " she 
she said. "Her arrest was ~n act 
of terror, an act of violence ... 
this is the Nixon-Agnew terror." 
Lane said Miss Fonda had asked M<Jtuszak if she could go to the ladies room. 
"This big, burly federal agent wouldn't allow it, so she put up a fuss," Lane said. 
Miss Fonda spoke at Fanshaw College in London, Ont., Mon­day night. 
"There is only repression and prison for anyone trying to do anything in America," Miss ron­da said at Fanshaw. "The gov­ernment must be replaced." 
The actress was arrested last March with a group of Indians who attempted to take over an Army post on Puget Sound.

F.OUNDED NOVEMBER ~. 1966 NOTRE DAME, INDIANA 
The Budget 

The academic year is a good percentage over with now, and still the budget has not been passed. Most organizations have been forced to operate on budgets that have not been passed, spending money, which they essentially anticipate but do not have. Some of those organizations, frankly, are in for a rude awakening, and will be in for a ruder awakening if the Senate itself tries to balance the budget and end Student Government's financially embarassing debt to the University. 
This tragedy is enacted every year. The late budget puts a lot of organizations on the spot, and when the budget requests finally do reach the Senate, a lot of unnecessary ill will is caused by the c·ontlict between desperate organizations and firm Senates. 
The Observer believes that a lot of this ill will could be circumvented. The Obserl'er believes that a number of simple procedural modifications could wipe out the November dread. 
Obviously, the Senate, or whatever body ends up considering the budget, must be elected earlier in the year. This year, the Senate was elected a full month after school had opened. President Krashna did not call a meeting until late October. The Senate begins considering the budget today, November fourth. By this time, many organizations have already spent amounts of money approaching their budget requests.

But by May first, every responsible organization should be able to submit a budget request and a justification for that request to the Finance Committee. 
By the same token, there is no reason to believe that the Senate Finance Committee would need more than the month of May to thrash out the budget requests and present something to the Senate. If the Senate takes its customary two weeks or so to determine the budget, a budget should be ready by late September, rather than middle November. 
The problem has grown to be sufficiently dangerous, now, and it's time to act. 

LEIIERS--­
Tech Tickets Editor: 

I was deeply disturbed by your editorial in Friday's copy of The Observer. It concerned the so-called tick~t crisis existing for the Georgia Tech football game. The time has come, I think, to discuss the whole topic of student ticket passes anyway. 
First, let me say that I am neutral concerning the idea which would allow South Bend kids to attend the game. By neutral I mean that I am not willing to give up my ticket. But, if it came down to it, I would buy one of the kids a ticket for the game myself. I think the kids deserve it and if anyone is will­ing to sell me a ticket for the Georgia Tech game (regular or student), please feel free to call me at 1633. I will personally give it to Student Government for use in the program. 
Second, why is it that the stu­dent can not do what he wants with his or her student ticket? After all, there are some stu­dents who have acquired tickets who have no use for them. Wouldn't it be easier to ask all those students to give their names in if they wanted a ticket for the game and then charge them for it. The present way gives some student an unw~ntcd ticket which they sell for enor­mous prices. I say, instead of the pass, give the student five tickets. The ones he can not use, he can give back and get a re­fund. 
Finally, if I may be allowed to go back to S:udent Govern­ment's plan. If Notre Dame is an instiiution which is for all brothers, black or white, rich or poor, Catholic or non-Catholic, how do you expect us to show the whole world our awareness of this fact, Father Joyce. Please reconsider. 
I urge all students, if the idea is not reversed, to buy tickets and turn them into Student Government. If I can get one, I will. Anyone wanting to sell a student or regular ticket, please call John at 1633 or write to me at Dillon Hall Rm. I 59. 
Thank you. 
Sincerely yours, 
John Fineran

Editor: 
A lot of girls are in a disgusted, discouraged, and disillusioned mood tonight. It is Friday night, a "big night"! We just came back from dinner, the big activity of the evening. The letter to the Editor in Thurs­day's Observer becomes our main topic of conversation. We are quite amused with the lette:­from A Typical Notre Dame Man. 
It is held in common belief at 
the University of Notre Dame 
that all St. Mary's girls do not 
know what it is to not hav~ a 
date on every night of the we,,I,. 
Little do they know that many St. Mary's girls suffer from oatetess weekends (especially upperclassmen) due to the mis­conception that many N.D. men hold -that we are booked solid months in advance, that our 

only aim is a Senior football player, and that everyone here is "without pity." Every once in awhile we see a boy and a girl together, walking along, hand in hand, talking and laughing. It saddens a girl to have this vital part of her life missing -and not voluntarily. But, after all,. we do get a "good" education at St. Mary's. 
We attend parties where we arc made to feel like the object of some drunk's tactile gratifica­tion, or else to be snubbed Jik.: a victim of the Bubonic Plague. (Not because we're ugly, but be­cause we look like a "Frigid B---" or because we look like a "Rich B--.") And so we come back and read a book, write let­ters, or do our laundry. "We have so mu~.:h fun, : but is it worth it? 
Sure men, we feel ~orry if you don't have dates, but at least you can attribute the cause to the limited amount of women. How would you like it if the odds were five ro one in your favor, and you still didn't have a 
date? Thanks for listening to the other side. 
Some Typical St. Mary's Women 
It really is difficult to take such arguments seriously. After all, the very people who make the accusation having nothing at all againsi "ripping the nation apart" if it happens to concern a policy they favor. The anti-war and black power people have accomplished the dividing of the nation more fully than anyone would have believed possible ten years ago. Their own words and actions demonstrate incontrovertibly that "division" is not what they really object to. It is the particular policies themselves that are the focus of the objection, not the division they cause. 
The critics contend that the present administration is appealing to interests groups rather than aiming at the common good of the nation. Translated into clearer language this reads "Mr. Nixon, quit trying to get the votes of all those people who agree with you and disagree with us, since we're the ones who know what's best for our country." It's as if the administration were forbidden to point out to various groups what benefits they may expect from the policies that President Nixon regards as best furthering the common good. (An example of appealing to interest groups to the detriment of the common good is available-but it's not Nixon. It is the Democratic Congress which has added billions of dollars to this year's budget in order to please different interests, even though this significantly hurts the fight against inflation which clearly constitutes the overriding economic need of the country at the present time.) Anything the President does is bound to alienate some-in fact, many-people, and to that extent is bound to cause division. 
Was the nation less divided in 1962 or 1966, when Kennedy and Johnson had been in office for two years? Who is it that the Left contends will not divide the country? George McGovern? Ted Kennedy?-Jane Fonda? C'mon fellas, give us a break. 
Why all this tuss about "unity" and "divisiveness'"/ Because it enables these carping critics who are eternally unsatisfied with everything but themselves to assume a statesmanlike pose with the righteous indignation of a patriot who abhors factious leaders (the very thing for which they call Agnew an "outrageous and obscene person"), are dividing our beloved nation. We would never do that. We seek only national unity." 
What the Left wants is is indeed unity -as long as it is a unity on their terms and no one else's. The argument that the Nixon administration is ripping the nation apart in rhetorical pretense, a shoddy and hypocritical pose which serves only to conceal the deficiency of their positions on real is~ues.

WAITING FOR THE GIPPER 
A Tragicomedy in One long and Dreary act or Ghosts I have_ Known and Flown With 
By T. C. Treanor 
The Setting: On Stage at Washington Hall, surrounded by Ouiji Boards, Tarot Cards, candles, mystics, and a Ghost Gun (a sort ofsupernatural Elephant Gun.) 
Washington Hall is Notre Dame's haunted hall. It is haunted by the Ghost of the Gipper, who, deep and sensitive soul that he was, came back here to pre· pare for the musical career he never had by playing the piano at night. Or maybe it's haunted by the young swain who, in I942 hanged himselfwhen rejected by his young love and who spawned a rash of University cover-up maneuvers. He alleg­ed(v hangs around now at night. 
Or perhaps it is haunted by the old priest who used to steal money from the poor house at Sacred Heart, and, who after dying found Sacred Heard too crowded to haunt, what with Orestes Brownson and all. 
Or· perhaps it is haunted by the frus­trated actor who took his role too ser­iously and jumped off the balcony. Who knows? 
In order to chart the Ghost's comings and going this Halloween, the drama de­partment imported several of its number, as well as WSND's Frank Devine, and This Correspvndant. The Characters: Any first names are listed ostensibly to protect the people, but in reality because I never learned their last names. 
L. franklin Devine: crafty, perceptive, and reasonably intelligent, Devine has nonetheless managed to rise to a position of power in WSND. Devine shrewdly managed the whole procedure for a 3 AM broadmst to eight people on WSND. 
George T.-: does not believe in Ghosts, poltergeists, walking skeletons, or Santa Claus. Does believe in getting on the radio. 
Bob S.-: resident historian. One of three people who knows all about Gipp and his ghost. One ofone who cares. 
Chris H-: Resident mystic. Nice kid. The other day her ouiji board told her where her key was. I wish I had a ouiji board like that. I've lost eight. 
Lois M.--: Surrogate mystic. Tells ofa 
friend who had a ouiji hoard which "at­
must made love tv her. " I had no idea 
Parker Brothers provided such services. 
Mark G.--: Looks a little like Tim Mac­
Carry with a heard. Talks a little like 
Richard Nixon. Afraid to ask him what 
his politics were. Does a nice Ouiji Board. 
Kathrine R.--: Accused by Ouiji Board 
of being a Warlord. Other than that, nice 
kid.

§i~cond City: okay
By Frank 

Did you ever have such a good time 
that you really didn't want to talk about 
it? Remember being seven or eight years 
old ~nd coming home from Swiss Family 
Robmson or Son of Flubber and having 
your parents ask how was the movie? 
:ou'd mum?,le something like "Aughhh, 
It was okay. Not because you didn't like 
it, but because it was so much fun ... And 
Besides how do you retell the good 
feelings you got when you laughed too 
hard or when Gabby and Chuck threw 
the flattened popcorn boxes at the screen 
and the ushe!" came down the aisle with 
his flashlight but walked by you and 
shined it over the other way? So you just 
mumble that the show was okay and hope 
that they don't pursue it. 

The Second City Touring Company 
was here Saturday night with a Revue 
called "Cooler by the Lake". In fact, it 
was one of those good times that was so 
much fun that you hesitate to talk about 
it: Five guys and two girls, aided by a 
ptano player, an upright, and six ice 
cream parlor chairs made us laugh Satur­
day night not only laugh, but laugh at 
ourselves, an event all too rare during the 
past few months. 

The Second City Company is one of 
the centers of genuine theatrical creati­vity in America today. Their brand of improvisational theater revue at first ap­pears almost like any other sevies of revue sketches. But there seems to be a very important difference. While most black­out sketches strive after some point in order to make the audience laugh, it seemed that the Second City made us laugh in order to make some point. The revpe is aimed at a particular audience, 
young, educated and middle class. Many of _the laughs were "in" things. Stories whtch would have sailed right by non­-members of the group. The audience was drawn into the action by this sense of belonging. In some sketches the audience ~lmost became an eighth actor, respond­mg as a suburban PTA when the situation called for it. 
Although there were the Nixon and Agnew sketches, the brunt of most of the sketches were the members of the audi­ence -the products of the suburban middle class, and we laughed at ourselves. 
The members of the cast were all 
extraordinarily talented. This isn't at all surprising when you consider some of the Second City alumni, Alan Arkin Barbara Harris, Jack Burns and Avery Schrieber among a myriad of others. The cast's names hastily mumbled during the curtain call may be a familiar in a few years as Mike Nichols, Elaine May or Shelly Ber­man (all alumni of the Second City's predecessor, the Compass Theatre Group). They were able to play the audience as a finely tuned instrument is played by a skilled musician. 
The laughs and sketches were of here and now. they were about smoking dope, about the South Bend cops, about the people at home who go to the PTA about the all too sophisticated Catholic~ who intellectually outgrow the Church and take up astrology, about my parents and my brother, and my roommates and myself -and I laughed and I pondered and then I laughed ev~n harder. 
. The Second City was over at O'Laugh­lm Saturday night -it was okay.

How to Prevent Students 

The chief reason why today's college students are so restless is of course tight pants. 
But other factors also contribute, and one of them, I fear, is bore­dom. All too often, I fear, students find their classes dull beyond en­durance. Let's face it: the modern undergraduate, caught in the grip of history and his zipper, is far too impatient to sit through old-fash­ioned lectures delivered in the old-fashioned way. 
Novelty, excitement, stimulation-that's what it takes to grab a student's attention these days. And wise teachers know it. On cam­puses everywhere they are trying bold new techniques to pique and engross their classes. Take, for example, Ralph Waldo Sigafoos, the distinguished professor of economics at the University of Florida, who now delivers his lectures nude. 
Or let's take E. Pluribus Ewbank, the distinguished professor of English literature at the University of Minnesota where it's too cold to lecture in your buff. Here's what Professor Ewbank does: when he's teaching, for instance, Shelley's immortal To a Skylark, he pauses after each stanza and does 2}1 minutes of bird calls. Believe me, he gets a terrific hand every time, but of course the biggest hand comes at the end of the poem 'Vhen he eats a worm. The kids sometimes ap­plaud till nightfall. 


Another innovation by the same resourceful Professor Ewbank is to make poetry more relevant to his students by taking them to the actual locale of each poem. Last month, for example, while lecturing on Wordsworth's immortal Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey, he rented a Zeppelin, flew his entire class to England, and moored on the same moor where Wordsworth wrote his immortal lines. Then everyone deblimped and had a jolly good picnic, complete with Morris dancing, three-legged races, pie-eating contests, and of course that without which you'd never call a picnic complete. I refer of course to Miller High Life Beer. 
If there are still some of you haven't tried Miller High Life­you're laughing, but it's possible-let me tell you what you're missing. You're missing flavor, pleasure, refreshment, comfort, satisfaction, felicity, truth, beauty, malt and hops. There is no other beer like Miller. How can there be? Miller's marvelous brewing formula has been a closely guarded secret for generations. In fact, it's known today to only one man in the whole world-Miller's chief brewmaster-and he has been trained to eat himself if ever taken alive. 
So if you haven't tried Miller yet-you're laughing, but it's pos­sible-get a bottle or can right away. The bottles are beautifully made of transparent glass. The cans aren't bad-looking either; they are, however, opaque. 
But I digress. We were talking about the new breed of teacher who doesn't just stand in front of his class and drone. No, sir! He dem­onstrates. He illustrates. He dramatizes. Take, for example, Glebe of U.C.L.A., professor of marine biology. He doesn't just tell the kids about the strange life-forms beneath the sea. Instead he brings a live sponge to class so they can see it. Similarly, Gransmire of North Caro­lina State, professor of textile engineering, brings a live washcloth. 
Then there's Williams of Amherst, professor of library science, who brings a live Dewey Decimal. And of course there's Schumann­Heink of Hardin-Simmons, professor of Indo-European, who brings a live hyphen. And Champert of Utah A & M, professor of Hebrew philology, who brings a nice Jewish girl. 
And so to those who despair of ever winning back our alienated students, I have only this to say: remember that America did not be­come the world's greatest producer of butterfat and milk solids by running away from a fight! Right on!

We, the brewers of Miller High Life Beer and sponsors of this column, have made what seems to us a very sensible arrangement with Max Shul­man. We don't tell him how to write and he doesn't tell us how to brew. 
The execution of plans being developed by the StudendJriion may dissolve the Hammes Cam­pus Store Monopoly. The union proposals include a discount campus store and a record co-op, both of which will hopefully be open next semester. The purpose of the projects, according to Rob Browning, Social Services Commissioner, and Bob Pohl, Student Union Manager, is to sell, at discount prices, the articles needed by all students, thereby making it pos­sible for the students to avoid paying the higher prices asked by the campus bookstore and by local merchants. The lower prices in the Student Union 
Stores would be possible because the Union is not anticipating any profit from sales; the only cost 
added to wholesale prices will be to cover the wages of the store workers. 
Plans for these facilities began 

last summer, when the Associate Director of the Student Union contacted serveral major com­panies, requesting information regarding whole sale prices and policies. In September, a repre­
sentative from the Colgate­Palmolive Company arrived on campus to confer with Student Union officials and since then, planning has moved forward rapidly. The plans are not yet finalized, and although the Union hopes to have the store in operation when the second semester begins, no absolute opening date has been set. 
The store is to be open four hours a day, in the Fiesta Lounge of LaFortune. Tooth­paste and other toilet articles will be sold, as well as class notebooks. Other merchandise may be added, depending on student response and other factors such as space, manpower, and bookkeeping facilities. 
A second Student Union enterprise, a record co-op, was inspired by the record co-op set up in Lyons Hill. The Student Union co-op will retain the Lyons manager, and serve as a larger-scale version uf lhe Lyons venture. Like the discount store, the record co-op will be located in the Fiesta Lounge, where the records will be displayed for browsing and purchase. Space conflict with the Student Uion Ticket Office may delay the co-op's opening, set for sometime within the next two weeks. 
While the stores will be operated and financed by the Student Union, they will be open to nonstudents as well as students. An expanded merchan­dise line, as well as larger store areas, may be introduced to both stores if the initial venture is successful.

Eggert also wonders how Par­seghian figures he rates a game with Ohio State. "After all," Eggert writes, "I don't see the Irish in the top two." Perhaps it and never need the excuse that the schedule was completed 10 years earlier to justify playing weak teams, because the slate played by the Irish is always one of the toughest played by any college team in the country. 
In the eyes of the rest of the country it will continue to look like Ohio State is trying to avoid playing really tough games be­cause of the decision not to play 8. Arkansas 6-1 9. Auburn 6-1 I 0. Tennessee 6-I

Weekend set for parents 
Plans for the upcoming Parents' Weekend have been finalized under the direction of Chairman Greg Caruoso. The weekend schedule includes the Pitt game, a catered dinner, and the Sergio Mendez concert. 
Parent's Weekend, officially known as the Sophomore 
coats Hats 
Parent's Weekend, was crs:ated by former V.P. for Student Af­fairs Rev. (harles McCarragher, to give the Sophomore class another activity of its own. The Senior class has the Senior Fel­low Award and the Senior Bar; the Junior class has Junior Parl!nt's Weekend, while the 
Sophomore class has only the Sophomore Literary Festival in the spring. 
At the present time, 1600 are planning to attend the Saturday night dinner catered by the Thumlerbird Restaurant of Mishawaka at Stepan Center. Father Hesburgh will attend the dinner and address the guests. A concert featuring Sergio Mendez and Brazil '66 will follow at the ACC at 8:30 P.M.·

Also discussed at the meeting Monday night was the possibility of having a combined workshop between the HPC and the hall rectors. 
The idea of a combined meet­ing was originally proposed by Fr. Schuman, rector of Breen­Phillips. After talking to Barkett about the idea, he decided that the two groups would investigate three basic areas: rector-presi­dent relationship, drug problem on campus, and the role of hall government. 
.The Hall presidents were very receptive to Fr. Schuman's pro­posal, and Barkett said that the combined meeting would pro­bably be held on November 16. 
summer, postcards were sent out to parents with information on football, concert and dinner tick­ets. The Ticket Office made 14,000 tickets available for the Notre Dame-Pittsburg game on November 7, and 378 motel rooms were made available. 
The reservation of football tickets is a departure from past policy, because this game is re­served only for parents of stu­dents. Formerly, tickets for all home games were made available to contributing alumni. 
Sergio Mendez and Brazil '66 were chosen for the concert be­
cause  they  are  a  group  that  
"appeal  to  the  old  and  the  
young."  

Sophomore Class President Steve Palucca said he was satis­fied with the plans for the week­end, as was Caruso. For the first year, he said, "I hope it sets a good precedent."
