Free City plans set 
by Dave Lammers Tll:e plans to turn Notre Dame into "a Free City for a day" were largely tmalizell at a meetmg m the Student Center last night. The group plans a concert by the First Friday, an early morning birdwalk with Dr. Nutting, art displays and folk groups, and informal discussions on aca­demic reform and The Free City. A letter to Father Walsh, Vice-President of Academic Af­fairs, from the group asks that he suspend classes Friday so that students can ask "What is the nature and purpose of a Notre Dame education?" The letter to Walsh recommended to him that Friday would be a truly educa­tional experiment. "On th9s day many Notre Dame students and faculty will be creating a Chris­tian academic community through meaningful dialogue. May l st will be an experiment in true higher educaiton." The plans call for free city day to be divided more or less 
into morning and afternoon sessions. The morning will center around the idea of Christian educational community; "what is lacking about Notre Dame and what we need to do to improve 
it." Faculty have expressed great interest in the concepts of educational innovation and of doing away with the grading system. Many faculty plan to hold informal discussions about various innovative ideas on the main quad from 10 to noon. Faculty that are interested in examining educational reform in these morning discussions should contact Scott Carmody at 1380. 
The afternoon activities will be more varied. First Friday has promised to perform throughout the afternoon, interspersing music with conversation about music. Folk artists are urged to spontaneously bring their guitars and voices to the quad; artists plan to set up their canvasses on the quad and discuss their art with the students. The Univer­sity Arts Council has offered help in getting artists to partici­pate in Free City Day activities. 
The main speaker, Willis Nut­ting, the author of The Free City will speak at I :00 p.m. at the main quad. Bayard Rustin, Cong. John Brademas, and Prof. Frank O'Malley have been asked to speak, though no committ­ments have been made. 
Mike Shaughnessey described the afternoon activities as "an academic be-in." "We want to take education out of the class room. We are trying to create an atmosphere that is characterized by creativity, spontaneity, and

"Liberal education centers on four questions: man, society, the universe, and God. These four themes will underlie all that happens at the free city of Notre Dame. 
The planners of the day emphasize that the day is open ended. "Anybody that wants to contribute to free city day in any special way just has to show up and participate. This is a day for people to be creative.

Editorial: 
The '' Panty Raid '' 
The so-called "panty raid" on St. Mary's Sunday evening was a glaring example of the tmmaturity and irresponsibility which, because of the actions of a minority of inconsiderate individuals, is attached by many to all Notre Dame 'men.' 
A panty raid on SMC has in the past carried a connotation of guys standing outside the girls' dorms and being given various belongings by their owners. But when this activity degenerates into physical attacks, large scale thievery, and a total loss of privacy any possible justification or rationalization is lost. It means little to say "Hell man, we was just havin a good time," while many girls are adding up losses and damages in hundreds of dollars. There is quite a disparity in the value of 'fun' had by childish boys and the $2500 worth of good stolen from St. Mary's girls. 
The sad thing is that one of the students' most commendable efforts, An Tostal, has been obscured. The Hall Presidents' Council put long hours of effort into the weekend to make it a success. And it was a success. 
It is unfortunate that it is an activity such as Sunday's "panty raid" which reaches individuals outside the community and is subsequently attached to all students, while An Tostal, the Contemporary Arts Festival and other student sponsored events are forgotten. 
If one looks only at "panty raids" it becomes understandable that those in a position to make rules for the community would point to destructive activities and conclude that the participants are hardly mature enough to govern their own lives. 
This should not and must not be the case. 


Student responsibility 
Sunday night, l 000 Notre Dame "men" responded to the arrival of spring with a funfilled romp on the St. Mary's campus. The result: thousands of dollars in damage and theft, and a testimony to the inability of many students to deal with the female on a human level. 
In the last 24 hours I've received calls from a number of girls, many in tears. They have been offended by the ransacking and theft of their property and frightened by the total insensitivity of these men. As a student leader, I find myself in a strange position. I advocate the decentralization of responsibility from the administration to the student, yet I find this total lack of responsibility by possibly one is six students totally indefensible. 
In my last article I called for a show of student responsibility. If this is a manifestation of it, we as students, we as men, have a long way to go. 
Unfortunately, we label the whole group, but certainly not all participated in destruction and theft. The.se non-participants must tind themselves in a aw_kward situation. In this case we are in a sense our brothers' keepers in that we must admonish and hopefully restrain those who must participate in such violence. 
Another thought: while we can get excited by a panty raid or a Notre Dame football loss, we can't get as emotionally involved in the real social problems of the day, such as racism, university compli~ity, or ironically in becoming real, responsible men. 
Friday I must face the Trustees on the issue of Hall Autonomy, especially parietal hours . One of my basic rationales has been that the total education of the male d.emands his taking pride in the female. I must eat these words. The Notre Dame man is no man if he can not find this pride and act by it. The Trustees point to the lack of responsibility of the students in their argument against hall autonomy. Our case is now a poor one. 



SMC Staff 
Father McGrath's ongoing dispute with the St. Mary's staff students points up the large financial problem that St. Mary's College is presently facing. The SMC adminstration's attempt to run a "tight" budget has resulted in much personal harm to the forty girls that work in St. Mary's cafeteria and the problem, initial!y . financial in character, has taken an ugle turn, as the administration has employed deceit, verbal abuse, stalliflg tactics, and legal threats. 
For our male readers information the forty staff students at SMC 
work from 15 to 30 hours a week and receive partial or full 
scholarships, depending on how many hours they work, Before 
Christmas, Father McGrath announced that he was eliminating staff 
scholarships for next year's freshmen. Before Easter, the present 
staff students were given a written contract that made several 
changes in the program. Under the contract, the girls were no longer 
paid for the time spent eating their meals or for time spent in the 
infirmary, and student supervisors, previously elected by the girRs, 
were to be appointed by the dining hall management. The staff 
students contend that the additional six hours spent eating, which is 
not considered as work time under the new contract, allows them 
too little time for their studies and personal lives. Sick time, 
previously considered as work time, must now be made up after the 
girl regains her health; the girls point up the danger of a sick girl 
serving food, and the additional burden of making up the work after 
an illness. 
Father McGrath answers the objections of the girls by claiming 
that the new contract "corrects previous abuses." "I wonder what a 
judge would say about paying girls to eat?" the SMC president asks. 
The girls have responded to Father McGrath's legalisms with their 
own. They reply that "correcting previous abuses" is actually 
breaching a contract that had been in use for many years. Though 
the contract was verbal, Father McGrath, being a lawyer, is surely 
aware that a verbal agreement that is honored for a long period of 
time cannot be breached without the consent of both parties. It is a 
legal contract "implied by fact." 
The staff students have been unified in their opposition to the 
changes, and intend to hold Father McGrath to his Christmas 
promise that the present staff students would be allowed to continue 
under the program without changes in the agreement. 
The present danger is that the SMC administration will resort to 
"divide and conquer" tactics. The girls have waited for four weeks 
for a contract settlement, and fear that the administration will wait 
until the summer when the girls are divided and unable to present a 
unified appeal. The prolongation of the problem is an unnecessary 
burden on the staff students. 
The last meeting of the SMC Board of Trustees considered the 
problem and recommend that McGrath meet with the girls to resolve 
the problem. The administators failed to contact the staff students, 
and one of the girls finally called a Trustee and was told of the 
decision by the Trustees. Last Friday's meeting resulted in a first 
step toward resolution of the conflict. 
There is no doubt that the financial problems of Saint Mary's 
present a great strain on Father McGrath and his assistants. Actions 
such as contract ultimatums,deceit, snickering between the 
administrators at meetings, dela.y tactics, etc. are the unfortunate 
product of Saint Mary's financial bind. There is no excuse for 
subjecting forty staff students to personal abuse, especially when 
one considers that working thirty hours a week in addition to class 
work makes life difficult enough to begin with.

How to Score with a St. Mary's girl 
by Pete Peterso_n 

People often say to me "Pete, yQu'rc such a stud. How do you do it, you devil?" In this space, I will tell all my secrets, so that you too can be a hell of a stud. PART 1: THE INTRODUCTION 
The trickiest part of getting a Saint Mary's girl of your very own to fondle and take to· the Huddle is meeting her. Now, we can start with a few basic assumptions. First, you are very cool-after all, you were a varsity letterman and made All-state, right'! Not to mention being class president, Boy's State delegate and diocesesan president of the CYO! From that we can make our second assumption, that is, that the Typical Saint Mary's Girl has no taste, right? So, i f you are going to Score a Biggie, we're going to have to make sure you make a first impression that will put 
you in good shape. 
Where to meet the girl: There arc several good places to make your first contact. The Huddle and the Library are but two. But let's face it, the best place is Saint Mary's itself. The best way to meet the girls is to go over to Saint Mary's on a weekend night with three or four of your friends and walk around until you run into a girl. It is important to appear relaxed, so it is best to have a few drinks before you go over. It might be a good idea to bring a bottle or two in case you are over then: longer than expected. Once you get there, don't waste a Jot of time in places where the hunting doesn't look too good. Move around a lot, wander between halls and other buildings; you never know where an opportunity may be waiting for you. 
What to wear: It is important that you look your most impressive. The girl should be reminded that you arc from the University of Notre Dame so that she will build up a relationship in her mind between you and the football team. The Bookstore carries a fine line of clothing especially geared to bring this about. A pseudo-jock jacket may be purchased which has leather sleeves and the letters "NOTRE DAME" on the back. For an additional charge, you may purchase various emblems, and even have you name stitched on the front. Topped off by an ND wool cap and a blue and gold scarf, you will be the epitome of the Cool Young Stud. Sort of an Irish Joe Buck. · 
The meeting: Obviously, you can't just walk up to the girl and say something stupid like "Hi. Lousy weather, huh?" You have to make The Big Impression. Your introduction has to say to the girl "Hey, this guy is really something!" You have to have a "Grabber" of a first line, something to really spark her interest. A few examples: 
I. What's happening, baby? 

2. 
Hey, whcre's the action around here, sweetheart? 

3. 
Hey, where arc you going? 



4. Are you a Freshman? Once you have delivered your Opening Line, you must then proceed to keep the impetus of your Big Impression. Small Talk is important. Ask a few keen, 
penetrating questions to determine the girl's interests. In a subtle a way as possible, attempt to establish the girl's name, year, major, and hometown. Ask her if she likes Saint Mary's. Demonstrate your sense of humour and wit by keeping up a 
running patter with your companions. Flatter the girl a little, tell her she's not like' "the other g1rls", she's not stuck up like the "Typical Saint Mary's Girl." MOST IMPORTANT: Be sure you get her first and last name. This point cannot be over-emphasized. 
In my next column, I will show you how to use this information in "Obtaining a Date".

by A Victim 

I had a history test the next day. Trying to ignore the growing rumble of voices in the distance, I picked up my copy of War and Peace. I was at a crucial point of the story, when I realized the roar of voices was in the-dorm. Feminine squeals of delight mixed with the masculine rumble as the ND men surged down the hallway. Thinking that a closed door signified my desire for privacy, 1 continued studying. 
Suddenly, what to my wondering eyes did appear but ten fine specimens of masculinity clad in assorted female attire bursting into my room. I thought perhap~ it was a scavenger hunt and naively asked "What can I do for you?" The mob, with only my safety in mind, shoved me against the wall. The famous Jim Brogan, star reporter, gleefully stuck his head in my room asking "What's your reaction to the panty raid?" I peered over the crowd breathing heavily and said "I enjoy the company; this is the first time I've been close to a guy in a long time!!!" 
Chuckling  lasciviously,  he  clicked  his  
heels and disappeared.  
Meanwhile,  the  ravaging  crowd  had  

ransacked all my drawers. As they turned 
to leave, I smiled with all the Christian charity I could muster and said, "Do you want the dresser too?" They progressed to the next room and I heard happy shreiks of welcome from my neighbors. I peeled myself off the wall and joined the other excited girls. My ecstatic neighbor, exclaiming "THis is the best thing that's happened in a long time!!" proudly displayed her bruises acquired in the scuffle. I grabbed the nearest person dressed in a yellow nightgown to ask a question, only to discover that it was my blind date from last weekend. 
Just then I turned to see seven upstanding ND men emerge from the shower room carrying a maxi bathrobe. A feminine voice from the shower room screamed after them "Come back soon!" One Domer rushed by me in a floor length formal. I hope his date looks good in a tux. The onslaught, apparently satisfied, retreated carrying with them 16 record albums, I music box, a hell of a lot of underwear, and two of my friends. As the echoes of "Here Come the Irish", the roar of the bullhorn, and the aroma of Seagram's and sweat faded from the hall I stumbled over the carnage back into my room. I collapsed sighing, "God, there are some really fine boys over there." 
Come up and see me sometime, REDMAN -Sweet Mae

Many of the articles, although perhaps not worth much in money, had sentimental attach­ment, such as the scarf given to me by a b oy who died in 
Vietnam last spring or the many other borrowed memories. 
Some of the raiders did not confine themselves to looting, however, as the girl who was pulled down the hall by her hair can tell you. She managed to do what many of us wish we could. She slugged him. 
From our room alone, almost one hundred dollars in personal belongings was taken. It's not funny any longer.

Rite of Spring 
Editor: 
I had a few sharp reactions to the "rite of spring" that oc­curred last night and thought I would share my thoughts with my fellow students. 
First, I find it all too much in the spirit of the Notre Dame man to obtain 'goodies" by force rather than by finesse. Second, for those men who don't have sisters or mothers or girl-friends, let them realize that the average "goodie" costs five times more than a pair of jockeys from Gilberts. I think we all know what records, radios, and other such items cost and anyone who took items of this sort, not to mention the "goodies", is nothing but a thief. Finally, most of the girls thought it was great fun until they started to total their losses, which brings me to my major point. Does one exhibit manhood by displaying one of the aforementioned "goodies", that he took by force, and then at the end of the year (only 31 days, men) throw it out because he can't take it home to Mom? Or does he show people that Notre Dame men aren't that bad by returning what wasn't his for a mere show of muscle? Some girls lost up to $75 worth of 
underwear. No small sum to anybody especially at the end of the year. 
So show a little guts, men.. Return your plunder. You never know, it may be the start of a "meaningful relationship."
