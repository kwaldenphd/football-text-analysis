Trustees approve $1.2 million for graduate women housing 
By Tt>rry Keeney Editor-in-Chief 
The Notre Dame Board of Trustees approved last Friday a $1.2 million expenditure for the new graduate women's housing complex. 
In a day-long meeting, the Trustees voted to appoint new members to the Board and approved the reports of its standing committees. 
The names of the new appointees will be released following notification by Edmund Stephan, chairman of the Board of Trustees. 
The graduate women's housing complex is under construction on Bulla Road directly east of the University. It is scheduled to be completed by fall, 1976, to accommodate women currently housed in Badin Hall. 
Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, University president, noted the work of the Trustees consisted mainly of hearing and approving reports of the standing committees. 
Ml.'eting Tl'rmed Good 
"It was a good meeting," he said. "We covered 
lot of ground and listened to a lot of reports and ar 
proved a lot of budgets."

the Board. 
The Academic and Faculty Affairs Committee report discussed problems of use of the Memorial Library. 
Fr. James Burtchaell, University provost, reported on the pro~ress of affirmative action programs. 
As part of the Investment Committee report, Philip Temple, an attorney with the firm of Prereau and Teitell and a specialist in tax-exempt organizations, explained the potential impact on University con­tributions of tax reform proposals currently being discussed in the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee. 
Tour Conducted 
The Trustees were also conducted on a guided tour of the Administration Building. Dr. James Frick, vice­president for Public Relations and Development, explained the purpose of the tour. 
"Fr. Hesburgh has always felt that people don't get a feel for the place," Frick said. 
"Here you have a building that's the center of the campus that Trustees have little opportunity to get a history of," he pointed out. 

Church's business to act 
Randall calls for equality 
by Eilet>n O'Grady Starr Reporter 
Dr. Claire Randall, secretary of the National Council of Churches, equated the issue of women in the Church with justice and human dignity last night. 
"It is the Church's business and you have to make it yours," said Dr. Handall, talking to a crowd of IiilO at a conference of the Catholic Commiltl'e on Urban Ministry <CCUMl at the ACC. 
SpPaking on "A Strategy for Woml'n in Church and Society," Handal\ claimed "any group working on justice must address itself to the issue of justice in our society and Church." 
"The Church has given little thought of what it means not to ordain women. By refusing to ordain them, the Church gives divine sanction to the secondary position of women," she said. 
Randall continued, "Somehow women can't have as close a relationship to God as men. This l'annot be thought or tolerated." She added this is the reason 
many religious  women  leave the  
Church.  
J  hine  Ford,  a  theolog  

teacher at Notre Dame, told of a statement made by the Church in 1954: "Bisexual people may be ordained as long as the predominant sex is male." 
Cites Pamphlet 
Randall then referred to a personhood pamphlet put out by the Church which directed its members to take responsibility to liberate people who are repressed. 
She pointed out this failed to include women within this scope of the repressed. 
"The Church should take the responsibility invited by the gospel they preach," Randall said in response. 
Randall is the General Secretary of the National Council of Churches in New York City. 
She mentioned some of the many programs the Council is working on in the defense of women: the Committee of Women's Corporate Responsibility, Women in Ministry and the International Women's Year. 
Speaking about society, Randall said that women have not been able to shape their lives or take part in the major decision-making

that decides much of their lives. 
"Women can't assume leadership that goes with these decisions," said Randall. 
Economic Discrimination 

She  also  pointed  our  their  
economic oppression.  
"Women  seek  economic  

viability. They are at the lowest rung of the economic ladder because the economic possibilities for women are oppressed from the top down," stated Randall. 
She said women should make their own choices about work, lifestyle and children. She said none of these should be defined by others. . 
Randall called for more CCUM members to form coalitions to aid the women's cause. 
"Women should work together in many groups on one issue," she stated. 
"We need to get a whole spect­rum of the work that concerns us. We need other women and women's groups in these coalitions," she said. 
She cited examples of successful women's coalitions started in the sixties. 
"The United Methodist Women have a long history of struggles of dealing with the same issues we are facing," she noted. 
"The work of the Church Women United led to the formation of the United Farm Workers. Also successful is the National Council of Jewish Women," said Randall. 
Randall remarked in these coalitions, women should make an effort to be non-{!ompetitive, draw out the insights of the various parts, make an effort to share decision-making and operate in ways less hierarchical than the Church in approach. 
Kandall also pointed out women's centers that have developed in cities for the justice of women. 
She cited one in New England which deals with the abuse of the grand jury system and the harassment of women by the FBI.

grows with student needs 
by Martha Fanning Staff Reporter 
Two years ago Notre Dame formed an Off-Campus Housing Office in response to the growing needs of off-{!ampus students. With approximately one-fifth of the student body living off-{!ampus, the involvement of the University has increased with regard to these students. 
Tom Wilson, assistant off­campus housing director, com­mented on the change. 
"The off-campus housing office has evolved from an information agency to an expanded service. This demonstrates that the university is becoming in­creasingly committed to the needs of off-campus students," he noted. 
The off-campus housing office has initiated many programs designed to aid students. However, a communication gap exists between the 0-{! student and the university. 
Father Thomas Tallarida, director of off-{!ampus housing, stated, "There has to be more

student input in the office; the office can't be a one-way street. We need response to programs offered." 

"We can offer all the services they need, but if the students don't respond, the programs die," he said. 
Tallarida commented on some problems in students renting, 

"Most students sign leases and they don't know what is involved. They also move into substandard houses and when they encounter problems they came to us,"he observed. 
Wilson explained that the office is trying to avert problems. 
"Most students come up to the office when they rearch the point where they can't handle the problem. We're trying to prevent problems from starting by providing information to student­s," he stated. 
Lists of houses, apartments and rooms available for rent are compiled by the office three times a year. All residences listed have been inspected and rated by the University. 
"The lists are constantly being revised and updated," Wilson added. 
If a student finds a place not listed on the sheets, the office will inspect the facility upon request. 
This evaluation service also applies to leases students are considering. A model lease is also available for a guide form from the 0-{! office. 
An Off-Campus Housing Guide 
has also been formulated. The 
booklet describes methods of 
finding a house and legal obligations of tenants and lan­dlords. 
A ·similar handbook is currently being printed for landlords renting to ND students. The guide will contain information on activities of the Off-Campus Housing Office, inspection criteria and mediation services offered to both landlords and students. 
Crime prevention is also an area of major concern to off-{!ampus students residing in houses. University students are suscep­tible to buglary due to the amount of time they are absent from the premises. . 
Tallarida stated that cr~me prevention information had been

handed out at registration. He 
encouraged students to get to know 
their neighbors. 
"The neighborhood associations 
are very active and can be a lot of 
help to students. Students should 
also become acquainted with other 
students in their area," he said. 
The housing office last week 
went out a list to off-{!ampus 
residents of other students living 
on their street. Houses which had 
been burgalrized within the last 12 
months were indicated. 
The letter which accompanied t­
he list stated "students are very 
vunerable to burglary perhaps as 
much as three times that of per­
menent area residents." 
A new program under con­
sideration through the 0-{! office 
and student government was 
outlined. Leaders for different 
neighborhoods who , could help 
improve the communications bet­
ween the university and o-c 
students are being sought.

mented, "could help get crime

Wife, 

NEW YORK <APl -Dressed in a frilly white apron, scouring pad in hand, the dishwasher manages a brave little smile across the array of shiny potsand pans. 
Mike McGrady's picture graces the cover of his book, "The Kitchen Sink Papers: My Li~e as a Househusband," a pmgnant, funny account of the year that he and his wife switched roles. 
Corrine M,cGrady went out into the world to become the family wage earner. Mike stayed home to care for three children and tend the household chores. 
He was 40 years old, a suc­cessful author (he master­minded the X-rated spoof, "Naked Came the Stranger") and a newspaper columnist earning $35,000 a year. But McGrady quit it all for chauf­feuring the children, aged 15, 13 and 11 to dentist appointments, rushing home in time to make dinner. vacuuming and ironing. 
"I wanted desperately to stop doing the same thing every day of my life," said McGrady, a boyish, witty charmer. 
"And I had always said that what I really needed was a wife," said the woman behind the man. 
Corrine McGrady was al­ready a bm-:nesswoman before the switch. She has been juggl­ing her housewife duties with commitments to her spare time career as a jewelry and graph­ics designer and manufacturer of such plastic classics as a cook book stand and a salad bowl.

by Sue BaUmann Staff Reporter 
Within the next week, St. Mary's will conduct a survey to determine the opinions of the student body, faculty and administration on the school nicknames chosen by a special committee, according to committee coordinator Cathy Coyne. 
"The committee, which basically acts as a screening process, has narrowed down the number of nicknames from 45 to 5 and decided to take a survey," said Coyne. 
The five choices are the "Rascals," the "Bells" or "Belles", the "Bandits", the "Smicks" and the "Marian Lakers" or the "Lakers." 
The survey will also include a box labeled "none of the above" for those who feel that the nicknames will not properly represent the school. . 
"There will be a referendum when the selection is narrowed down to two or three names," Coyne announced. 
According to Coyne, the com­mittee of judges contains representatives from everywhere in the college. 
The members include Joan McDermott, Student Government President; Denise Peterson, a senior; Dr. William Hickey, vice­president for academic affairs; Diane Davis, director of the alumnae association; Mike Reynolds, director of public in­formation; and Stevie Wernig, assistant to the vice-president for student affairs. 
"No one is in a hurry to choose the nickname," Coyne stressed. "We are concerned with getting a good name which will mean something twenty years from now." 
"We "want a name that has something to do with the school and incites enthusiasm," she added. 
Coyne noted in choosing a nickname "there are very few comparisons we can make to other girls' schools. Other than the "Mighty Macs" of Immaculata College in Pennsylvania, most womens' teams make up their nicknames for only one season at a time." 
"Most women's colleges are concerned only with intramural sports and only one or two varsity teams, while St. Mary's is in the process of building both an ex­tensive intramural and varsity program," she stated. 
Coyne pointed out the nickname must be versatile so that it can be used for all sports.

on top of her head. "But .I al­ways had this vision of my not being a housewife. I hated the deadness of being confined. I wanted another slice of life. I wanted to be self-sufficient. Money is power, and I wanted my own." 
Then that mid-life restless­ness hit Mike. Corrine's busi­ness was bringing in about $10,· 000, and she encouraged the switch. She had no doubts about her ability to expand the business and provide for the family. And she was confident of her husband's talent at wielding egg beater and broom. 
Their friends could not take the role change seriously. Mike was repeatedly asked what he was really doing that year. 
"To men, it was the sacrifice of a precious birthright. To women, it was insanity," said Mike. "At parties, women loved me for about 8 minutes and then thought about the ramifi­cations -that their job was so easy and so dumb, any guy could do it." 
"In the beginning, I felt very lost and threatened," said Cor­rine. "I felt outside the frame­work of my friends. I didn't be­long anymore. I was a heroine of sorts but their envy was combined with hostility." 
Mike got a contract to do the book after he quit. He kept a diary of his troubles: 
The provider coming home late without calling resulting in a ruined dinner. Mike sneaking off to the local bar for solace

where he invariably ended up giving out recipes for steak Diane and mayonnaise. Mike feeling pangs of jealousy as Corrine casually recounts luxu­rious lunches at chic restau­rants. Familiar family ex­changes with a twist -"Your mother will speak to you about that when she comes home tonight ... You never take me out anymore, Corrine ... " 
Mike was a gourmet chef, producing such exotic dishes as Oysters Rockefeller, but he never did get the hang of housecleaning. 
"I expected to come home to a well-ordered house. But it was in utter chaos most of the time," Corrine said. "I just couldn't kick off my shoes and forget about it because deep in my heart I still had that sense of responsibility about the house." 
So Wednesday nights while Mike left for his basketball night off, Corrine tidied up. The experiment almost collapsed there. 
"I felt he had not kept up his end of the bargain. I felt he didn't want to do it," Corrine said. "And then suddenly I re­alized no one would ever want to do it. He had never been conditioned to think that a spot­less home was necessarily a good thing." 
She was plagued with guilt when Mike slipped into occa­sional depressions about the monotony of his life. 
But they survived.

more  programs  geared  toward  
helping the student  once  he  was  
settled off-campus.  

The lists received last week were generally believed a good idea. However, some students suggested that a more inclusive list be sent with students listed on the basis of area and not just on an individual street. 
Although several students commented on the lack of social involvement and isolation from friends no solutions were men­tioned. Most felt that this aspect of o-c life was the student's responsibility.

COUL: Certain Death? 

When SBP Ed Byrne gave the SLC the responsibility to follow up the recom­mendations of the Committee on Un­dergraduate Life (COUL), he may have condemned them to certain death. 
The COUL report contains recomm­
edations from a group of students, faculty and administrators com­missioned by the Board of Trustees to study student life, The proposals provide a real direction for improving the quality of student life. They include: a plan for aco-ed housing, provision for "neutral space" for social gathering and an on­going student critique of the office of Student Affairs. 
These recommendations are too im­portant to give to a body with the recent record of the SLC. The SLC has lost respect as a viable, representative body on this campus. Last year it spent the better part of one semester trying to define the sexuality code. Finally, last April it did pass an extension ofparietals in the dorms by one hour. This body has commanded so little respect from the Administration that Fr. Hesburgh has yet to make any formal reply or acknowledgement of the proposal. 
SLC different? 
Ed Byrne claims that this year the SLC is different. According to Byrne, the SLC has been reduced in membership to facilitate discussion and provide ad hoc committees, like the COUL committees. We can only hope that Byrne is right and that the new SLC will handle the im­mense work load of following up the COUL recommendations. 
But let's be realistic: it took the COUL committee members six full months of weekly meetings merely to come up with recommendations. Any follow-up to implement these proposals may be ex­pected to take at least that long, if not longer. 
The recommendations strike to the heart of student life at Notre Dame. Solutions may take months, perhaps years. That iswhyit is important that the same students work on the report follow­up this year and next year. As it now stands, there is only one underclass student involved ~'l following up the report. 

If follow-up responsibility went to the SLC, there would be an annual turnover in students working to implement the proposals. The turnover from last year's COUL committee to this -year's COUL committee is marked by a lesser en­thusiasm for the COUL report. 
COUL not a priority 
Last year SBP Pat McLaughlin made the COUL report his number one priority. This year Ed Byrne did very little for last week's report to the Trustees and left most of the work to another member of the COUL committee who did it almost on her own. 
The COUL committees were effective last year because students, faculty and 
administrators could let their hair down 
and deal seriously with student problems. 
In the SLC such frank discussion has 
proven impossible because votes and 
discussion break down to confrontation 
bet ween students and administration 
with faculty in the middle, Whether the 
new SLC can create an atmosphere of 
cooperation between students and ad­
minsitrators is doubtful. 
The COUL report sould not be referred 
to the SLC, but should be followed up by 
an an ongoing committee of students, 
faculty and administrators These per­
sons should assure that follow-up is done. 
They would be responsible to the Board 
of Trustees in May for implementation of 
the recommendations. 
Abandoning original purpose 
The COUL-report must not be allowed 
to become just another document that is 
never acted upon. Of the 33 recom­
mendations of the report 12 have met 
with no action and six are categorized as 
"action to be taken." The recom­
mendations in theses categories are 
perhaps the most important in the 
report. 
The Committee on Undergraduate Life 
was formed last year because existing 
channels including the SLC did not work 
for students. There is little reason to 
expect those channels to become 
suddenly effective this year. To disband 
the COUL committees in favor of the SLC 
may be to abandon the best leadership 
and direction students have had in years.

WASHINGTON--Last week I had a kidney stone attack in Evansville, Ind. I wouldn't have even mentioned it except that an alert Associated Press urology correspondent picked up the story, and it made the A.P. wire. So many people have written in asking what a kidney stone attack really feels like that I decided to try to explain it in terms that the layman can understand. 
A. kidney stone is about the size of a tiny pebble to everyone except the person who has one. To this person it is the size of the 

Rock of Gibraltar. In fact, many people when they get a kidney stone attack scream out, "I've got a peice of the Rock." There are two kinds of kidney stones. One is made up of uric acid and the other 
of calcium. Doctors can differentiate between the two, but patients can't nor at the time of an attack do they give a damn. If you've felt one kidney stone, you've felt them alL 
This is what seems to happen as far as the victim is concerned. He is going along minding his own business when suddenly, out of nowhere, a mountain forms in the kidney which, as I said, feels like the size of the Rock of Gibraltar. 
1 The kidney reacts angrily to this interference with its function and tries to push the rock into what might be described as the Suez CanaL Obviously the Suez Canal cannot accommodate the Rock of Gibraltar, and without any warning war is declared between the kidney and the rock. 
An urgent message is sent on the hot line from the kidney to the rock. "Unless you get out of our canal immediately, we will attack with everything we have in our organ." 
The rock sends back a one-word reply, "NUTS!" 
The patient, who is a horrified neutral spectator to this exchange, tries everything to achieve peace. He paces up and down, rolls to and fro and eventually tries to climb the wall in hopes that the kidney and rock will come to their senses. 
Using Kissinger diplomatic tactics, the patient tries to per­suade the rock that if it will just move a few inches down the canal, the kidney will not try to break it up. 
But the rock is adamant and demands .tremendous con­cessions in exchange for withdrawing from its position. "How do Iknow," the rock asks, "that if I move from where I am now I will not be driven into the sea?" 
The victim assures the rock the kidney has no intention of pushing it into the sea. All the kidney wants to do is live in peace with the lower part of the body. As long as the rock doesn't try to prevent the kidney from doing its work, the rock can live in the bladder for as long as it wants to. 
If megotiationts fail and the rock refuses to move, then a U.N. doctor is called in who immediately fires a volley of Demerol or some other painkiller into the bloodstream. 
This does not stop the war between the rock and the kidney, but it gives some shelter to the innocent, while the kidney tries to push the enemy out of its territory. This can only be done with gallons of water which the kidney forces against the rock. 
If the good guy (the kidney) wins, the rock will retreat and even sue for peace. If the rock is able to repulse the water attack and hold its own, then the kidney will have to surrender, which means handing over negotiations to the Blue Cross. 
It would be nice to report that once a kidney stone has lost a battle others would learn their lesson. But unfortunately this is not the case. Even though my kidney moved the enemy to a safe place, I distinctly heard in my Demerol stupor the rock say to the kidney, "I may go down the drain, but there's a lot more of us where I came from."

The FALN communique found in a telephone booth in New York demanded the re­lease of Oscar Collazo, con­victed of trying to assassinate President Truman in 1950. The 25th anniversary reference to revolution apparently referred to this assassination attempt. The FALN also demanded free­dom for four persons convicted 
of wounding five congressmen in a 1954 shooting incident in the House of Representatives. The four shouted "Freedom for Puerto Rico" as they fired. 
The bombs went off in the three cities in rapid succession. The first came at the National Westminster branch on Wall Street at 1:43 a.m. EST. The Continental Bank in Illinois was hit at 1:55 a.m. At 2 a.m., came the explosions at the IBM 
building in Chicago, at the State Department in Washing­ton and at a First National City Branch on Wall Street in New York. 
Sixteen minutes later, bombs went off at the Chase branch on 57th Street just east of Fifth Avenue and at a First National City Branch on 57th Street just west of Fifth. The last bomb at 
the U.S. Mission, exploded at 
2:30 a.m. 
The Monday incidents touch­ed off bomb threats and scares. Chicago police received a tele­phone warning of further ex­

Acting on the recommenda­tion of the FBI office in Chi­cago, officials evacuated the Capitol and nearby buildings in Springfield, Ill.
