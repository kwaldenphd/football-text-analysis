Carswell survives Senate's Ist test 
WASHINGTON (UPI)--Judge 

G. Harrold Carswell survived his first Senate test by a 52 to 44 vote Monday, but still faced a final, crucial vote Wednesday on his nomination to the Supreme Court. 
With a number of senators expected to switch sides in Wed­nesday's vote, President Nixon's second try to fill a vacant court seat still was not assured. 
But opponents of the nomi­

Student Body President Dave Krashna told the Hall Presidents Council last night that he would like to see the hall community become the focal point of stu­dent government. 
He said that as SBP he will create a new cabinet commission called the Hall Life Commission for the purpose of integrating hall life and student government operations. 
During his brief address Krashna commented on a topic which Council member John Barkett had previously said will be discussed with a sub(;ommit­tee of the Board of Trustees on Thursday afternoon. Krashna claimed that the subject, indivi­duality versus responsibility in the halls, is most vital to the quality of hall life. 
"Too many times, " he said, "the halls have a hotel-motel type of psychology." He ex­plained that this type of apathy retards the growth of any so-cal­led community spirit. He fell the outcome of the action taken in the recent racial incident in Alumni Hall demonstrated that many people are willing to share the responsibility for hall life when the occassion demands it.

According to Tom Schoaf, a local organizaer of the Morator­ium Committee, nothing specific has yet been planned for South Bend and Notre Dame. However, a meeting is being planned for later in the week in order to formulate a local schedule. 
The proceeds from the "Peace Fast Fund" will be given to the American Friends Service Com­mittee, The Vietnam Relief Pro­gram, The National Welfare Rights Organization, and The United Farm Workers.

A Forum 
One thing that Notre Dame lacks is a forum which provides for continuous discussion on the various issues which confront students. 
I hope to establish such a forum on the editorial page of The Observer provoking discussion by relating various points of view, coupled with my own feelings and by publishing letters I receive which comment on the issue. 
I hope to establish discussions on things such as: recruitment, minority admissions, the relevancy of the University, the value of a "Christian Education," and University priorities. Too often these issues are only discussed by both sides during times of crisis, or through structured bodies such as the SLC and the University Forum. 
In order for there to be any real communication about the issues students must be made aware of them, and given the chance to give their views, such an exchange will be beneficial to the community as a whole. With the various viewpoints pitted against one another in print, the community will be able to choose the one it felt was best. 
For this forum to be success'ful I will require cooperation from the students. I will welcome any and all letters commenting on issues raised by this forum, and· will also appreciate any specific in­formation on the subject, if a person happens to be well oneted in 
the matter.. 
Sophomor_es who recently attended the "Meet Your Major Night" 
for the Government Department learned that next year all Govern­
ment courses, with the exception of a newly created and as yet 
unnamed course, will be closed to all non-Government majors. 
This move, according to the Chairman, was due to severe 
overcrowding in most of the government courses and the resultant 
impairment of the education of the majors. Therefore it was decided 
to limit the persons eligible for the various courses. Such action was 
taken only after expansion of the department was considered and 
rejected. The reasons? Several, the primary one being that old 
bugaboo-money. 
By forcing the department to restrict those allowed to take its 
courses, the University in effect is restricting the education of those

If action is not taken immed­iately, Morgan contends, millions of gallons of water will be drawn from the lake in order to cool the nuclear reactors and will be returned to the lake at a temperature 28 degrees warmer. 
This process will theoretically raise the temperature of the whole lake. Untold damage could be done to fish and plant life and the growth of algae and bacteria may be accelerated. The eventual result will be the stag­nation of Lake Michigan, accor­ding to Morgan. 
Morgan hopes that the peti­tions at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's will contain as many as 4,000 signatures. 
The petitions were posted last night in the Dining halls at Notre Dame and will be posted later this week in the cafeteria at St. Mary's.

Brown to appear at SLF 
by Bob Meyers 
The Sophomore Literary Fes­tival will present their fourth annual schedule of events next week from April 12th-16th. In­cluded among the authors atten­ding are the controve~sial Claude Brown and Ishmael Reed. 
Claude Brown, 33, is a native of Harlem who attended Howard University and was a playwright for the American Afro-Negro Theatre Guild before writing the autobiographical Manchild in the Promised Land in 1965. 
Few non-fiction books have been able to match the impress­ion that Manchild made upon Americans. Its author was called upon to speak in dozens of locations around the country, to testify before Congressional committees, to write articles for leading magazines, all to re-ex­plain the things he had simply and forth"tightly stated in his book. 
It is a peculiar American idio­syncrasy nbt to believe what is most truthfully told, and even when they believe it, to wonder wide-eyed at the mystery of it 
all. Claude Brown opened their 
eyes by telling them the truth 
about black people in the urban 
ghetto. He told with eloquence 
and honesty that which he had · 
lived. 
In the ·foreword to Man­child, Brown explains how the great influx into the slums of the North was fostered on the pro­mises of a better life, and how disillusionment and anger have been inbred into generation after generation of blacks. 
The world now knows some­thing of these people, partially as a result of Claude Brown; but their misery continues. As he said, " .. they had little hope of deliverance. For where does one run to when he's already in the promised land?'' 
Brown will speak on "The Black Renaissance, Part II" on Monday, April 13 at 8 p.m. in Washington Hall. 
Perhaps tne most versatile of the guests at the I970 Festival is poet, journalist, actor and novel­ist Ishmael Reed of New York City. After an apprenticeship as a college-dropout journalist in Buffalo, N.Y., Reed became edi­

He was invited to teach a

ture at the University of Califor­
nia at Berkeley in 1968, which 
proved to be so successful that 
he was voted one of four of the 
most popular teachers on cam­
pus. 
In a recent interview he said 
"The '70's will belong to black 
people, Indians, cosmic creat­
ures, and anybody else who 
wants to climb aboard." 
The sardonic joy and bitter pain of being young, black and in America (taken separately or collectively) permeates Ishmael Reed's writing. His talent is a monster, controlled only by the class that good writers have. The words are cleanly written, alive with swift cuts at nearly every oppressive or neutral object. The Free-Lance Pallbearers ( 1967) and Yellow Back Radio Broke­Down ( 1969) are the manifesta­tions of Reed's creative ability. 
He calls himself, as well as all Afro-American artists, "interna­tional mind-miners." The new universal identity that the black man is striving to achieve stands out in Reed's writing like a shining black torch in a field of snow. 
Reed will speak on "Contem­porary Problems in Literature" at 8 p.m. on Sunday, April 12 in Washington Hall.
