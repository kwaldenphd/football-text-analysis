Historkal consciousness in a con­stamly changing political climate is cetllral to the Polish poet's awarc­nt·ss, according to Nobel priZl'· winnt·r Czeslaw :\lilosz. 
"Wht.·n pm·try is connected with hiMorical pa:-.sion. everyone nt·eds pot.·try," the opening artist li1r the

During a visit last summn to Poland alter a .~0-yt·ar absence, \-1 ilosz ml'l now impri~oned Solidarity k.idt·r l.ech Walcsa and tht· two "became great friends." Tht· pot·t's "t'cdings very strongly bind" him with Solidarity and he admires Walt-sa as a "wonderful and very wise man" whom ht· will tiJilow "eVl'rywhere." ''Primarily a poet," :\olilosz has abo written books and prose. I k was born in Lithuania in 
I') I I and moved with his family during the World War I and Russian Revolution contlicts. In 19S I, he hrokt.· with the Communist regime and exiled himself in Paris. He came to the United States in 1960, became a naturalized citizen and is a profes­sor emeritus to the University of California at Berkeley. 
Poland's situation is now "pretty bad," he stated. "Normalcy as a whole has been destroyed." The present ft:ding of Polish citizens is one of "rage and despair, hatred. Poland is pervaded by hatrt:d. Nobody believes anymore what the govt-rnmcnt says." 
Solidarity; according to Milosz, saved the Polish people from several decades of "a start· of humilation," establishing a solid movcmt:nt that was "gcner:tlly felt" in tht· country. "Expres~i(Jll of t'rt-c public opinion (tl>r) tlw t1rst time since 1':15')" was the movement's main accomplish­

"Solidarity was to get :1 certain 
amount of l'Oillrol over the policies 
of the government ...as far as (the) 
t·xperts were concerned," he said. 
The movement has also been 
accused of being unwilling to com­
promist·, but, Milosz explained, 
Solidarity was moved to such an 
"extreme position" because it was 
unable to reach a compromise with 
the Polish government. 
Walesa's policy, according to Milosz, has been "to act in the open" in Poland, a country "so thirsty" for democracy. "The act of the military junta was foolish," Milosz stated, referring to General Wojcicch jaruzclski's ordered Dec. 13 takeover and establishment of mar­tial law in Poland.

ISOplays vitalrole 
Foreign students adjust to ND 
By DAVID SARPHIE 
News Assistant 
Editor's note: The following is the second ofa two­part sL>rles examining the integration process of minorities at Notre Dame. The first installment, which appeared last Monday dealt specifically with the problemsfaced by black students. 
More than 300 foreign students from sixty nations attend Notre Dame. These individuals come from dif­ferent cultures, speak different languages, and bring with them different ideas and values. It is this diversity 
~~at, Fr. ac~.~:~!n! M 0 N D A Y1:1iil~~iH. Tallcrida, places them among the University's most valuable assets. As Director of International Student Affairs, Tall arid a comes in contact with foreign students every day. Through this contact, he realizes the benefits these students could provide the Notre Dame community. "The views of these stu­dt·nts in such areas as the importance offamily, religion, politics, and materialism often vary widely from those of the American students," he said. "I think the interna­tional student serves as a valuable resource to this uni­versity by providing differing ideas to Americans who art· ignoralll about how people ft.·d." Tallarida scrvt.·s as an adviser for the International Student Organization (ISO), which attempts to utilize the~t· resources and allow a positive interaction bc­twt·t·n li>rt'ign and American students. lkfore any interaction is possible, however, foreign ~111dents must first adjust to the different lifestyle at :-.lotrt· Dame. The ISO provides an English class to hdp those studt·nts who have functional difficulty with the language. "This class is important, because the English language is ~·hard tool to master," Tallarida noted. "Trouble with the language can affect not only one's academics. hut one's ability to socialize, as well." 

The Host Family Program is another service for foreign students in association with the ISO. This program matches a student with a family in the South Bend community, allowing the student a better under­standing of the American way of life. This program provides a valuable service, as a student from Malaysia noted, "a host family can really help a student get ad­justed to the new lifestyle, and it gives him a family with whom he can keep in contact." 
After the foreign student has adapted to the many 
changes in his lifestyle, the ISO tries to make his efforts 
worthwhile. The organization schedules various social 
events throughout the year, hoping to bring the foreign 
students together with the Americans. 
Francois Boueri, co-president ofISO, reported a dras­tic improvement in the success of these parties this year. "Last year, we really didn't have much in the way ofsocializing, but I think things have improved this year as far as foreign students arc concerned," he said. "We still need more participation by American students before we will have a truly successful cultural inter­change." 
To open up the communication lines for this cultural interchange, the ISO has scheduled an international fes­tival for the: first week in April. Events will include a mock United Nations dc:bate, an international buffet, an arts and crafts display, and a talent show. "We're hoping the festival will give the American students a taste ofthe many different cultures represented on this campus," Boueri said. "We owe it to the Notre Dame community to try." 
An organization with purposes similar to those ofthe ISO is M.E.Ch.A.. This group focuses its attention on the culture of Latin America. According to MarthaJimenez, who has worked with the organization for two years, M.E.Ch.A. provides hispanics and those interested in the Latin American culture a chance to speak Spanish and share their common intc:rcsts. "We want to give the hispanic student a chance to get together with other students of a common background to help him fed more comfortable," she said. Among the events 
scheduled for the remainde-r of the year arc a Chican<) t1lm festival and a Mexican dinner. 
schools where the students arc so educated they're almost ashamed of their parents," Hesburgh told the junior parents and students Saturday night. "If that ever happens here we'll close the place." 
The junior class members played host to their visiting parents this weekend at the annual three day gathering designed to further unite students and their families. 
Calling the affair "one of the best weekends of the year," University President Father Theodore l-Ies­burgh addressed the re-united families following a dinner at the Athletic and Convocation Center. "For the first time, the men and women of Notre Dame get to host their parents on their own turf as adults," he said, "and I am happy that this weekend has been an occasion of so much love between parents and students." 
In Father Hesburgh's opinion, Notre Dame parents arc a crucial part of what he terms "the greatest student body on earth." Students arrive already formed, he said, as ex­tensions of their parents and it is these parents who deserve credit for the students he "wouldn't trade for any others." 
The wcc:kend also included workshops put on by each ofthe col­leges. Thc:sc were comprised of presentations by the deans and in­formal discussions with professors. 
Mass was held at Sacred Heart Church on Saturday evening and some problems with seating arose. According to one parent, the church was filled long bdore the beginning of the Mass and "many who had come a very long way to attend could not." A Glee Club perfor-

Fr. Theodore Hesburgh and other concerned students, professors, and administrators, sharing the convic­tion that the chances of nuclear proliferation has caused an unjus­tifiable and terrifying increase in the probability of nuclear devastation, will show their peaceful solidarity at a "Bread Not Bombs" peace gather­ing on Ash Wcdnc:sday. The gather­ing will be at noon on the steps of the Dome. 
Sponsored by CILA, Campus Mini­sty, Pax Chisti, and the Center for Expcricntal Learning, the gathering will begin with the pealing of the Church bells. 
One of the student organizers, Liz Abeyta, remarked that the purpose of the gathering is to make everyone more aware ofthis issue. "There is a big tradc:-off going on," she said. "People in the third world arc starv­ing to death, yet we spc:nd billions on nuclear arms. We want to make people aware of the fact that every bomb we build is bread being taken away from these people." 
Also referring to this "trade-off," Craig Price, another student or­ganizer, stated that the purpose of the gathering was to "reassert the priority of life, cspt.·cially for thost who arc suffering from the economic trade-off between tht· weapons ra<.·e t and social programs. We are making a stand as a Catholic university community on the issue of peace, particularly in regard to the arms race."

Party time at ND
The Soviet newspaper marks the 250th anniversary 
of George Washington's birth today, giving the first U.S. president 
good marks when compared with President Reagan. 
The paper yesterday described Washington as a slave owner and 
representative of rich landowners, but said he "managed to achieve 
for Americans that which many of his successors carelessly squan­
dered -a peaceful and dignified life." -AP 
San Antonio, Texas Mayor Henry G. Cisneros, 
the first Hispanic elected mayor of a major American city, was 
named yesterday as the 1982 RichardS. Childs Lecturerin Municipal 
Affairs, the City Club of New York announced. · 
Cisneros, 34, is scheduled to present hislecture Friday at the club, 
New York's oldest non-partisan civic organization. 
Cisneros, who earned his doctorate in public administration at 
George Washington University, served six years in the San Antonio 
City Council before beingelected mayor in April 1981. 
Cisneros is the fourth public servant to deliver the lecture, which 
memorializes Childs, a former City Club president who devised the 
city manager system which has been adopted by 1,800 U.S. cities. ­
AP 

Six former air traffi.Ccontrollers have been awarded 
nearly $25,000 in unemployment benefits because the federal 
government didn't show up to challenge their claims. 
The government, which says it doesn't have the manpower to at­
tend the job Service of Iowa hearings, is expected to appeal the 
decision. 

Richard Sturgeon, a spokesman for the International Association 
of Machinists who represented the former Sioux City airport con­
trollers, said the controllers won because they didn't admit miscon­
duct in going on strike last August. 
The government, which has maintained that the strike by the 
Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization was illegal, would 
have to prove misconduct to support the dismissals of the strikers 
and the denial ofbenefits. -AP 
European Economic Community finance 
ministers agreed in Brussels, Belgium Saturday to devalue the Bel­
gian franc by 8.5 percent and the Danish krone by 3' percent, accord­
ing to the governor of the Dutch Central Bank. 
The Belgians had sought a 12 percent devaluation and the Danes a 
devaluation of 7 percent, but they were considered unreasonably 
high by all of the other delegations, according to a Common Market 
source who asked not to be identified. 
Both countries had applied for the devaluations to make their ex­
port products cheaper abroad and therefore more competitive. 
Belgium's unemployment rate of more than 13 percent is the hig­hest in the Common Market, and earlier yesterday the government froze wages and prices until May 31 in a move to revive the flagging economy. 
Premier Wilfried Martens said the devaluation ofthe Belgian franc is part of a move to breathe new life into the Belgian economy, which suffers from record public spending and borrowing. 
In Copenhagen, Danish Prime Minister Anker Joergensen said the 3 percent devaluation would bring some improvement in his country's ability to compete abroad, but he admitted he was disap­pointed the 7 percent devaluation had not been approved. -AP 
An Indianapolis youth's first driving experience came to a screeching halt yesterday after the tanker truck he had "borrowed" smashed into three parked cars, a chain-link fence and a stop sign, police say. 
"It's the first time I ever drove, period," said the 14 year-old boy, 
following his arrest for vehicle theft. "You have to learn sometime." 
The youth, who was not identified, said he was walking on a city 
street when the truck, owned by Allied Appliances Co., pulled up 
beside him. 

He said the man behind the wheel asked him if he would like to 
drive for a while. 

"I was driving for 15 or 20 minutes with this guy by my side," the 
boy said. "But when I started hitting the cars the man jumped out 
and said, 'Later on."' 

In pursuit of the weaving tanker was a truck and one of the 
damaged vehicles, driven by its_angry owner. 
The two motorists headed off the tanker and detained the -boy 
while police were summoned. 
The youth was released in his parents' custody. -AP

Due to the lack ofsocial activity at Notre Dame, a few guys-at one ofthe dorms decided to improve the atmos­phere and throw a party. Here is how the conversation went while they were planning the party: 
Bill: Hey, si.nce there's nothing going on in Indiana this weekend, why don't we get the party room and have some people over? 
Joe: Yeah, it'll be a change from our usual routine of sitting around andgetting pickled in the room, after sit­ting around and getting pickled at one of those great $1.00 movies in the Engineering auditorium. 
Bill: Sounds good, but first let's make sure our party follows the guidelines established by the hall judicial board andDuLac. 
Rocky: What rules? The only party rules 1know are to 
keep that fool down the hall away from the girls and any 
weapons. 

Bill: Get a due; here are but a few of the regulations 
our hall has: "The party room is only to be used by hall 
residents and their guests. A minimum of 50 percent of 
the quests must reside in the 
hall. Parties or happy hours 
can take place on Friday and 
Saturday nights or on the 
eve of a University holiday. 
The party room can be used 
any day for non-alcoholic so­
cial events." 
Rocky: We've got to have 
alcohol -if we don't my 
reputation will be ruined. 
Joe: That's not so bad; we 
can follow those rules. 
Bill: Are you kidding! 
That's only rule number 
one. Let me read just a few of 
my favorites: "One cannot 
reserve the Party Room 
before one month or after 
one week before the date of 
the event." 

Rocky: Any party I'm at is an event. 
Bill: Yep-rule number three states, "To reserve the 
Party Room, one must include the date of the reserva­
tion, the type ofthe party ...." 

Rocky: I think we'll just have the usual type, a good 
old souse. 

Bill:" ....the names of the people organizing it, (the 
chairman), the names of the people working at the 
party, and the names ofthe people cleaning up after the 
party. 

Rocky: Most ofthe people I hang out withget cleaned up after the party. Bill: Anyway, "One can cancel one week prior to the event without penalty." Rocky: Penalty ... .I thought we're having a party, not a hockey game. 
Bill:"The penalty for later cancellation is the loss of the rental fee and one-halfofthe deposit." 
Joe: What deposit? 

Rocky: Deposit? Are we gonna have a keg? 
Bill: No, that is rule number eight of the "Further

Million barrels daily 
Saudisdenyoil production cuts 
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP)-Oil Ministry officials Saturday denied reports the kingdom has slashed crude oil production a million bar­rels a day below the official OPEC level. 
The denial, the first official Saudi comment since the reports began last month, came as the world oil cartel president warned of market "chaos" ifmembers undermine each other in pricing and production. 
Sheik Abdul Aziz al-Turki, the un­dersecretary of the Oil Ministry, said "the kingdom's crude production is continuing within the framework of the announced ceiling of8.5 million barrels daily." 
In a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency, he denied reports "that any decision has been taken to reduce production to (between) 7 million to 7.5 million barrels daily." 
Saudi Oil Minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki 
Yamani is in Europe, according to of­
ficials. 
Saudi Arbia, the world's largest ex­
porter of crude oil, accepted a 
ceiling of8. 5-million-barrels daily in 
November at the demand of other 
members of the 13-nation Organiza­
tion of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries. Its previous daily average 
was 9. 5 million barrels. 
The weekly Middle East 
Economic Survey reported yester­day that knowledgeable observers estimate Aramco, the main Saudi producing company, is currently producing between 7 and 7.5 mil­lion barrels per day. By the end of the week, the spot price for Arabian light crude had "fallen way below . the $30 per barrel mark (as compared with the official price of 
S34 per barrel) and was heading for 
1129," according to MEES. 
In a separate report yesterday the authoritative weekly oil journal also qoted OPEC president Mana Saeed Oteiba, oil minister of the United Arab States, as advocating "prorationing" production by OPEC members to .defend official price levels and restore stability to the glutted oil market. 
"We have agreed on a floor for our prices and if we breach this agree­ment, then there will be no market price and we will find ourselves at the end of the day in a state of chaos," he was quoted as saying. 
"We have to get this deteriorating market under control and if the OPEC members show the requisite spirit of cooperation, which I am sure they will, things will look better before the summer." 
'New federalism' 

Governors question Reaganproposals 

WASHINGTON (AP) -The na­tion's governors gave a mixed and often skeptical reaction yesterday to administration arguments that there will be "no winners, no losers" un­der President Reagan's "new federalism" proposal. 
"The truth of the matter is the 
states are already the losers," said 
Gov. Scott Matheson of Utah, refer­
ring to cuts in federal aid to the 
states in the administration's 
budgets for fiscal 1982 and 1983. 
Although budget director David 
A. Stockman contended that the budget is a separate and distinct issue that "really has no bearing" on "new federalism," many of the governors disagreed. 
"Art. you saying to me ...that this 
deficit is not important?" New 
Hampshire Gov. Hugh Gallen, a 
Democrat, asked Stockman during a 
session of the National Governors' 
Association. 
"I have not suggested anything of 
the kind," Stockman responded. 
Stockman and Richard William­
son, assistant to the president for in­
tt·rgovernmentai relations, 
appeared at the opening day of the 
association's three-day winter 
meeting and also at a meeting of 
state lt-gisiators. 
While nearly all governors sup­
port the concept of giving states 
authority over programs now run by 
the federal government, they arc 
qut·stioning whether the financial 
resources also will be made 
available. 
"If we're going to be partners, we 
can't come into the partnership in an 
anemic position," said Matheson, a 
Democrat. 
Williamson responded, "The

greatest losers are not any state, but all Americans," a reference to the current economic conditions. 
"With respect to the budget," he added, "we're open to discussion." 
Two Republican governors,James Thompson of Illinois and Christop­her Bond ofMissouri, urged their fel­low governors to accept "new federalsm" as the basis for achieving the kind of shift of responsibilities governors have long advocated. 
Reagan's proposed budget for fis­cal 1983 projects a S91. 5 billion deficit and reduces federal aid for the states by $10 billion. 
_Gov. Richard Riley of South 
Carolina, a Democrat, said that for 
the states to negotiate the details of "new federalism" on an equal basis "the federal deficit is going to have to be corrected." 
But he said that deficit "ought not 
to be corrected on the backs ofstate 
governments." 
Stockman replied that the ad­ministration was willing to consider any reasonable proposals for reduc­ing the deficit. However, President Reagan is standing fast on his proposed increases in defense spending and would resist any effort to cancel or delay the scheduled cuts in income tax rates. 
Asked about a proposal Saturday 
by Democratic governors and con­
gressional leaders that considera­
tion of"new federalism" be delayed 
until economic conditions improve, 
Stockman said, "The current 
economic problems and the fiscal 
year 1983 budget problems that we 
face are simply not sufficient reason . for delay." 
Space shuttle Columbia prepares for thirdflight 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) ­Technicians at Kennedy Space Cen­ter begin preparations today for loading fud into the Columbia's ex­ternal tanks, the next major test before the space shuttle blasts offon its third mission. 
"Ali in all, it's going to be a pretty quiet week," space center spokes­man Dick Young said yesterday. 
It is the first time the tank will be tilled at the launch site, Young said. For the Columbia's two previous flights, the tanks were filled at aNa­tional Space Technology Laboratories testing facility ncar New Orleans and transported to Cape Canaveral by barge, he said. 
The shuttle and astronauts jack Lousma and Gordon Fullerton suc­cessfully completed a mock tlight Friday, despite a 16-minutc delay caused by a computer malfunction. Officials said the malfunction would have scrubbt.d an actual flight. 
Despite; official speculation that 
the March 22 launch may be moved 
up two or three days bccaus~ work 
is ahead of schedule, Young said no 
plans have been made to do that.

Milosz also read poems relating to his experiences at Berkley and the Gospel. Fellow poet and translator of Milosz's works, Robert Haas (who will appear at SLF today at I:30 in the Library Lounge and 7:30 in the Library Auditorium) read two of the Nobel prize-winners selections.

Bayley plays Chautauqua 
F
or three hours on Friday, Feb. 19, a standing room only crowd of Notre Dame students were treated the rhythms ofjohn Bayley. Chautauqua Club filled to capacity as the wizard of reggae was welcomed back to the campus he pleased at last semester'sJAM. 
Tim Farrell and John Dardis 
Bayley, a native ofGuyana, South America, climbed the stage with a laugh that set the air for the rest of the night. He began with "Pickin' and a Grinnin"' and the audience responded with a roar that would be its trademark for the hours to come. 
Throughout the first set, Bayley related personal experiences ofen­counters with armwrestling men of South Bend restaurants and how glad he was that the crowd was crazy. The crowd invariably reacted with the spirits to carry "the reggae­musicman" throughout the night. 
With the Bob Marley time of"I Shot the Sherriff',"Jamming," and "Rastaman Vibration," Bayley dis­played his talent as a reggae musician. He also performed a couple ofsongs from Cat Stevens and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. His cowboy boots and yelps reminis­cent of the American West provided a Country and Western touch. Bayley explained afterwards that this was the type of music he was exposed to as a youth in native Guyana. 
As part ofan extensive U.S. tour, John Bayley was in Chicago for two days. When asked if he would like to return to Notre Dame again, Bayley responded that he would have a ha~d time refusin~ such hospitality. 


When asked to describe the crazy 
evening ofsongs about Babylon,Jah, and the holy herb, Bayley wrapped it up in two simple words, "Positively 

Mushabac, Cherrypositive." It was a spiritual event for him to sing about "jah mountains, Jah trees,Jah fish injah seas." He left

George Cherry will be performing a recital Tuesday, Feb. 23 at 8: IS p.m. in the Snite Museum's Annenberg Auditorium as the Notre Dame's University Artist Series continues. 
Ms. Mushabac studied cello tor six years at the]uilliard School of ,\1usic in New York before studying at In­diana University with janos Starker. Currently a professor ofCello at Baldwin-Wallace Conservatory of 
Music in Berea, Ohio, she has taught at the University of Kentucky anCI was a guest artist and visiting profes­sor at the University ofSao Paulo. Brazil. 
After a recent Carnegie Hall solo 
concert, she was characterized by Joseph Horowitz ofthe New York Times as "a vital confident player with a sure command ofthe instru­
ment." 
Cherry received his under­

graduate degree at Northwestern University before earning a masters degree in music at the Uniersity ofIl­linois. He also holds the degree of Doctor of Musical Arts from the Cleveland Institute of .\1usic. 
Currently a professor ofpiano at Baldwin-Wallace, Cherry has per­formed extensively with orchestra, in solo recital, and in chamber music throughout the Midwest. 
Admission to the concert is S2, s1 for senior citizens. Tickets will be available at the door. 

Longevity gets more interesting with age 
I 
fyou are a writer, you have a lot offriends who are writers. One of mine has the formidable name, Osborn Segerbergjr., but he's "Ozzie" in Kinderhook, N.Y., where he lives. Ozzie has never written a hit play or a best-selling novel, but he's a good professional writer. The world needs fewer stars and more competent professionals in. every field. · 
Living To Be 100 is the name ofthe book Ozzie's just written, and he did his research from reports he got from I,200 people who are at least 100 years old. 
The book ought to do pretty well, but I don't think this one will be a best-sellereither, because I question how much interest there is in living to be I00 except amongpeople who arc already 99. Until you get close, living to be 100 doesn't seem like that attractive a goal. I, for example, want to live for a long time, but I don't want to get old. 
Right now, I'm cool to the idea ofbeing IOO. When the great financier and philosopher Bernard 


Baruch turned 80, someone 
asked him ifhe felt old. He 
said he didn't. 

"To me,"Baruch said, "old age is always l 5 years older than I am." I agree with that. All my life I've been moving up the age at which I think "old" begins. 
For his book, I'm sure Ozzie Segerberg has made sure all his sub­jects were actually IOO, but I can never get the Russian joke I know out ofmy mind. Years ago I was working on a morning TV show and someone did the perennial story about the area in Russia where people are reputed to live to be older than people anywhere else in the world. 
The filmed report showed several Russians who said they were at least II 5 years old. When it was over, another writer on the show who had been to Russia said, "Those people aren't 115 years old. Living in Russia, it just seems that long." 
The book Living to Be 100 isn't a flimsy go-to book with a lot of fake answers. It's a serious report, and like most honest reports, it doesn't pretend to have one simple answer to the most important question ofall: how to stay alive. It simply tries to find out how these 1,200 centenarians did it. 
for example, Ozzie asked his subjects iftheir eating habits had 
contributed to their long life. Many of them said that "eating right" 
had helped, but then Ozzie got asking what they thought "eating 
right" meant and there was a big difference ofopinion. 
One man said he thought it meant eating no starch and a lot of 
meat, fruit and eggs. Several said it meant eating slowly, but Mrs. 
Adelheid Schuhnecht, ofBeaver Dam,Wis., said" we ate good, a bag 
ofpotatoes a week." 

I have a private feeling that I'd have been dead ofoverweight 20 
years ago ifI'd eaten a bag ofpotatoes a week. 
One ofthe things the book does conclude is that having a sense of 
humor is a big help in gettingto live a long time. People live longer if 
they have some good way ofgetting through the hard times without 
too much stress, and a sense of humor is one way ofreducing stress. 
That's good to know ifyou have a sense ofhumor, but ifyou don't there's nothing you can do about it. You can change your eating habits, get more exercise or stop smoking, but no one everacquired a sense ofhumor through determination. · 
Some ofthese IOO-year-olds said they had been helped by good doctors, but Walter Pannell, I00 years old and a doctor himself, was asked how often he had a physical checkup. 
' "I haven't had the occasion to consult doctors," Dr. Pannell said."! don't feel the need. When you feel alright, d01)'t hunt for trouble. 
The trouble is, we all hunt for the answer, as ifthere was just one, and it's obvious, there isn't.

The second set proved to be-even more energetic than the first. Taking the audience higher than before, the sounds ofBayley's guitar got people on their feet to dance. They danced through Bob Marley's "Woman 
Don't Cry," and "Roots Rock Reggae." The high-spirited crowd even tried to dance on Bayley's small stage. Although the dance space was too small, Bayley joined the crowd and leaped around while accepting tokens ofgenerosity from the excited audience. 
After leaving the stage, he was forced back by the rowdily cheering of the crowd for a memorable encore. The audience did not want to accept the end and yelled for an­other encore, only to be disap­pointed by the brilliance ofthe house lights. 

the stage with a more intense and less ·nervous smile than he entered with. His last words to the audience were "Jah bless you!" 
"Positively Positive" is the name of Bayley's first album. The record has already been cut and is due in record shops by early April. He is based in Colorado and already en­joys a large following in the South­west. He will continue his U.S. tour by heading South to Kansas, Missis­sippi, and Florida. From there he will trek across the country and end the tour in Los Angeles, California. He hopes to visit Notre Dame again in the future, now that he realizes his popularity on campus. His qualities as a comedian, singer and all-arolllnd great entertainer insure him ofcon­
tinued success with very receptive and ecstatic audiences, no matter where the location.

types of defenses that our oppon­nents play. It's a lot of work, but it's also very satisfying." 
Phelps has not been disappointed with Grasser's contribution. "Gary gives I00 percent all of the time," Phelps says. "He's not as talented as many of our people, but he's a very hard worker." 
Grassey has some comments about his ability as a basketball player. "I have no prctentions about being a starter or logging a lot of playing time," he says. "But my game has improved tremendously since I joined the team. I try to hold my own, and I don't back down. I know a lot more about the game now than I used to know." 
Grasscy has been close to Notre Dame athletics since he arrived four years ago. He worked as a student manager during his first semester, being fortunate enough to land a job with the soccer team. He began working at The Obsen1er during his second semester. At the beginning of his junior year, he began working at Notre Dame's Sports Information Department. During his career as a writer and a manager, Grasscy met several Notre Dame ~:oaches (including Phelps)_ 
''I'm a very fortunate person," Grasscy claims. "I've been able to view the ssssss;;," he con­tinues. "They can't ever really un­derstand the ~:hemistry ofa team. So much of this game is mental. A lot of thinking is involved." 
Now that Grasscy has seen both sides of the fence, he is able to more fully understand the conflicts that sometimes arise between reporters and sports personalities. 
"A sportswriter can be educated to a game over a number of years," he surmises. "By asking good ques­tions, he can gain a knowledge of what goes on bchind-thc-s~:enes. But a writer has to be very careful about criticism. The entettainment factor often enters into columns. Ashoddy job always shows up." 
Phelps realizes that Grasscy is also a reporter, and that he could take ad­vantage ofprivileged information he receives as a player. But this is not a problem. "Gary is totally loyal to myself and the team," Phelps ex­plains. "There arc certain things that happen inside the team that he could exploit, but he doesn't. He realizes that we're trying to work as a unit. Certain things that happen should not be public knowledge." 
Phelps claims that Grasscy's situa­tion is enviable. "He's got a few dif­ferent perspectives on the situation," he says. "Gary now knows what it's like to be a reporter, a spectator, and a student-athlete." 
Now that Grassey is familiar with all aspects of basketball and sportswriting, does he plan on pursuing a career in either? 
"I definitely do not want to be a sportswriter," he answers. "I would get tired of that too qukkly. I like being involved more than on the surface. I might, however, eventual­ly consider coaching baskc:tball." 
Grassey is currently interviewing with several companks in order to make usc of the Economics dc:grec that he will receive upon gradua­tion. "I want to work in New York for at least a couple of years," he says. "I'm a city person. I thrive on constant a~:tion. After I earn some money, I'd like to go to graduate school. But nothing is certain." 
It is obvious to anyone who talk!t to Grasscy that he is thoroughly enjoying his experience with the Notre Dame basketball team. "What a great way to spend my senior year," he exclaims. "I've learned a lot about basketball -a sport I've al­ways loved -and I've had a great time. I'm grateful for what Digger has given me." 
An~. no doubt, Phelps and the 

Irish basketball team arc grateful for 
what Grasscy has given them.

'TheBird' 

Red Soxinvite Fidrych to camp 
BOSTON (AP)-The Bird, Mark Fidrych, whose arm ailments have sent him to the minors for threes seasons, will join the Boston Red Sox this week in spring training at Win­ter Haven, Fla., the team announced over the weekend. 
The former Detroit Tigers pitcher, who won American League Rookie of the Year honors at age 21 in 1976, will sign with the Red Sox' lllltetrnational League team at Paw­tucket, R.I. by Thursday. He will join 
pitchers  and  catchers  in  Florida,  
according  to  team  spokesman  
George Sullivan.  

Details of the contract were not disclosed. 
"He'll be given every opportunity to become one of the 2 5 players on our Red Sox roster," Haywood Sul­livan, executive vice-president and 

Mark "The Bird" Fidrych 
general manager, said in a statement from Florida. ''I'm elated to have mark in the Red Sox family. We're very hopeful his rehabilitation will continue in leading him back to the majors." 
Sullivan said the decision to sign the 6-3, 27-year old from Northboro, Mass., followed phone discussions he had Saturday with Fidrych, Fidrych's agent, Bob Woolf, and Red Sox manager Ralph Houk, who coached Fidrych in Detroit before retiring briefly in 1978. 
"There has been particular im­provement in the last months and his progress has impressed a number of our people," Haywood Sullivan said, adding that coach Walt Hriniak, catcher Rich Gedman, and second baseman Jerry Remy had seen Fidrych work out.

G_ary Gra.·sey changesroles 
By DAVE .DZIEDZIC 
Associate·sports Editor 
Editors note: This is a reprint ofa story which hadappearedprevious­~y in The Observer. 
A year ago, Gary Grassey was a full-time reporter for The Observer. When he wasn't covering a basket· ball or soccer game, he was probably writing a feature story about a Notre Dame basketball player. 
My, how have times changed. 
These days, instead of writing stories about the Notre Dame bas­ketball team, Grassey is a member of the team. 

Grassey, a 6-8 senior from Hacket­tstown, N.J., vividly recalls the day that Coach Digger Phelps talked to him about playing for the Irish. "It was the day after the Bookstore Bas­ketball Finals last year," he remem­bers. "I saw Di£;ger in the Sports Infomation Office (where Grassey works as a student assistant).. He said, 'I'd like to talk to you about playing for us.' I thought he was joking. But I went into his office later and he explained what he wanted of me. I was shocked." 
'Shocked' seems like a mild term for someone who was about to have his dream realized. 
"I have dreamed for a long time about being a Notre Dame basket­ball player," Grassey says. "I tried out for the team each of my three years, but I had resigned myself to the fact that I wasn't going to play. It took a while for the realization to sink in." 
Grassey was a good basketball player at Huntington High School in New York, but not good enough to play for a Division I school. He was recruited bv 40 colleges coming out ·

of high school, but never received a scholarship offer. 
"I was recruited on the basis of potential, not past performance," Grassey says. "I don't even remem· ber my high school statistics. There isn't much to remember." 
Grassey considered attending other colleges, including a few Ivy League schools. "I might have been able to play four years at places such as Brown," he says, "but I decided to enroll at Notre Dame because I wanted a good education and a good atmosphere. I never had any idea that I'd end up on this team. In fact, I thought my basketball career was over." 
Just how did Grassey end up on the squad? 
"I think it was a matter ofbeing in the right place at the right time," he explains. "Digger needed a big man for practice. I knew him from my contacts with him as a sportswriter. He respected me and knew that I'd give everything I have to the team." 
The role of a walk-on is not easy. He must work hard . at every practice, but doesn't participate in many games. Grassey knew this when he accepted Phelps' offer. 
"There's not a whole lot of glory involved," he says. "I basically have to help the team in preparation for the opposing front lines, playing the

Two qualify for NCAA's 

Track team breaks t-wo records 
ByEARLRIX 
Sports Writer 
The Irish track team set two 

school records and qualified one 
athlete for the NCAA Champion­
ships en route to a seventh-place 
team finish at the Central Collgiate 
Championships ( CCC's) in Madison, 
Wisconsin this weekend. 
Senior tri-captain Paul Doyle vaulted 16-8 3/4 inches to break his own school record and qualify for the NCAA championships. Doyle's vault was the highest in the history ofthe CCC's but he was tied and had more misses than an opponent, so he placed second and his vault may not be recognized as a meet record. 
Junior Steve Dziabis qualified for the NCAA's by winning the 600 in a time of 1:10.43. He qualified in the same event as a freshman. 
Sophomore Andy Dillon broke the school record in the three-mile event with speedy 13:5 I clocking. 
Greg Bell qualified for the finals in 

the 60-yard dash with a 6.44 second 
clocking in the preliminaries. He ran 
Finish9-3 



Swimmers split meet with lllinois 
The Notre Dame men's swimming team wrapped up the dual meet seg­ment of its schedule over the weekend at the Rockne Memorial Pool. 
The Irish split a pair of meets with Bradley, and wound up the season with a 9-3 record. It marked the second season in a row that the Irish swimmers posted nine wins, the second highest win !Otal in the team's history. 
Friday night, the Irish chalked up win number nine, the seventh 

Gretzky tops NHL scoringmark 
DETROIT (AP) -Edmonton's Wayne Gretzky tied Phil Esposito's National Hockey League goal­scoring record last night when he drilled in his 76th goal of the season at 16:34 of the third period as the Oilers posted a 7-3 victory over the Red Wings. 
The 21-year-old center took a pass from Glenn Anderson and beat Detroit netminder Bob Sauve with a I 5-foot shot along the ice that went into the net just insiee the right post. 
The goal closed out the scoring. Gretzky also picked up four assists, giving him 171 points for the season, a dissappointing race in the finals, however, and finished sixth. Anoth­er sprinter, freshman Phil Gilmore had a 6.53 clocking in the preliminaries and thereby qualified himself for the ICAAAA champion­ships. Gilmore had never competed in track prior to this year. In high school he bowled and played baseball, according to sprint coach Ed Kelly who adds, "He's a very, very 
good prospect and a raw talent." 
Greg Bell long-jumped 24-3 3/4 inches, missing the school record by less than and inch. That was good for fourth place. Kelly feels that Bell has an outside chance to qualify for the NCAA's in the long jump ifhe hits a really good jump in the next two weeks. Doyle long jumped 23-0, but did not use up all of his jumps so he could conserve his energy for his record-setting pole vault attempt. Freshman James Patterson jumped 22-7 in his first taste of collegiate competition. 
The distance medley team ofJim Tyler, Jacques Eady, Tim Macauley, and Jim Moyar missed qualifying for 
straight VIctory for the team. The 66­47 win gave the team achance to set a new team standard by repeating the performance Saturday against the same Bradley team. 
In Saturday's action, however, the Irish dropped a 63-50 decision, closing out the regular season. Notre Dame could manage wins in only the 400-yard relay, closing out the meet, and Paul McGowan's double victory in both the one-meter and three­meter diving events. 
Two weeks from now, Notre 
seven more than the mark he set last year. 
It was Gretzky's second record performance in as many games. The 21-year old center scored three goals and two assists Friday night, breaking his own year-old record of 164 points in a season. 
Earlier this season, Gretzky eclipsed one of hockey's most coveted feats, 50 goals in 50 games, by scoring 50 goals in 39 games. 
The Oilers have 1 7 games left, giving Gretzky a chance to crack two previously unthinkkable NHL marks -200 points an 100 goals in a single season. 
Dame will be in action again, as they travel to Illinois State for the Mid­west Invitationals. 
Following that meet, the ultimate goal for the college swimmers is the NCAA Championships. The Irish are looking to qualify several swimmers, in a number of events, for those championships later this spring. 
Coach Dennis Stark expressed pleasure at his team's performance thus far, and hope that his swimmers would perform well enough to go on to the NCAA's later in the season. 
the NCAA's by only a second as they clocked a very commendable 
9:50.1. Moyar ran the mile leg ofthe relay in a sizzling 4:05.5. 
The Irish two-mile relay team of Tyler, Macauley, Rick Rogers, and Ron Hyde ran a very consistent 7:46 to take fifth place. Their split times varied less than a second. 
The Notre Dame mile relay team finished sixth. The runners and their respective quarter times were: Mitch VanEyken 49.7, Jacques Eady 49.4, Steve Dziabis 49.4, and Jan Kania 49.8. Dziabis and Kania ran the 600 only 40 minutes prior to the relay. Dziabis, of course, won and Kania ran a fine 1: 12.2 although he did not make the finals. Kelly said he respected guys like Jan Kania and Ron Hyde who have been, "quitely doing the job right. They're out there every day, steadily improv­ing."

.'»-it was this stat more than any other 
that came back to haunt the Irish. 
As an explanation-more than an excuse, Smith put the loss in very simple terms. 
"We took some penalties, and we got burned." 
With the Spartans on hand for tonight's 7:30 face-off, it could be the Irish and an enthusiastic crowd that applies the heat instead, and to do so would put Notre Dame back on the very positive track they have enjoyed for the last two months.

walked over and offered her own congratulations to Foster in the game's final minute. "She is truly c:apable of dominating a game be­cause she's very strong and she's smart." 
"We wanted to win it (the game) for her," said Lady Gamecock Coach Terry Kelly. "I know I wanted to win it for her, and I'm sure the players did too -'Sheila Foster Day' wouldn't have been as instrumental :if we had lost. But the thing I :stressed to our players was to be concerned with 40 minutes of bas­ketball. After those 40 minutes, then we could go out and celebrate 'Sheila Foster Day' and our 20-win season." 
The Lady Gamecocks almost started celebratling too early. 
Holding a 14-·point halftime lead, Carolina scored the first six pointsof the second half -something the Irish needed more than Carolina did. 
Notre Dame did not fold, and in­stead closed the defecit to 1 5 on three occasions, the 1last coming with just under eight minutes left, when Mary Beth Schueth scored to make it 56-41. 
It was at that point that DiStanis­lao felt the game got away from her club. 
"If our forwards had been a little 
more 'take charge' at that point, we 
could have taken control of the 
game," DiStanislao said. "But with 
the exception ofShari ( Matvey ), our forwards were freshmen, and our mistakes resulted from that." 
Every time the Irish made a run at South Carolina, the Lady Gamecocks answered back with a run of their own. Such was the case after the Irish closed to within 15. 
After a pair of Carrie Bates free throws made the score 60-43, South Carolina went on a 10-0 tear, aided in part by three Irish turnovers in consecutive trips down the floor. 
When Laura Dourgherty finally ended the run of points with a jum­per from the foul line three minutes later, the issue was no longer in doubt. 
"We have to begin taking charge a 
little more offensively," DiStanislao 
said. "We have people who can 
score points, now we just have to 
figure out a way to do it." 
Bates did most of the point·

clubs. 
"Theresa and Debbie (Hensley) showed us excellent leadership today, something we desperately had to have," said DiStanislao. "They both had been on the floor with South Carolina before. 
"We showed a lot more heart than 
we have in the past few games," she

added. "1 think we have learned a valuable lesson. We have had two big games in a row -we didn't play well in the first one, and we didn't play well enough to win in the second one." 
As a team, South Carolina made only three more field goals than Notre Dame. The difference came at the foul line, where the Lady Gamecocks made 22-of-37. 
The Irish made 6-of-1 0, and were whistled for 28 fouls, while the Lady Gamecocks were called for 19. 
"I thought the officials let a lot of things go," said Kelly. "I think one of the reasons we had so many more free throws was that we were fouled a lot while we were shooting the ball. I think they (the officials) let things get out of control in the last five minutes, but I don't think the difference was because ofone-sided officiating." 
DiStanislao's only comment on the officiating of Ken Chepy and Bobby Giles, Jr. was that she thought it "unprofessional" of one official who, when Mullins said "Oh my

A blocking foul whistled against Doug\lerty midway through the first half, the third straight questionable call made by the two officials, brought DiStanislao off the bench screaming, and the conversation ended with Mary D getting her second technical ofthe season. 

Watson earns $54,000 
Miller loses sudden death playoff 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -Tom Watson rolled in a putt of 40-45 feet on the third extra hole yesterday to win a sudden-death playoff against Johnny Miller in the $300,000 Glen Campbell-Los Angeles Open golf tournament. 
After Miller bogeyed the 17th and 18th holes ofthe final round to dead­lock with Watson at 271 for 72 hols, the two veterans went to sudden­death play. 
Each parred the first two extra holes, then Watson sank his deciding putt while Miller missed a long putt. 
Watson, who hadn't won in eight months, collected 1154,000 and defending champion Miller earned S32,400. 
Tom Weiskopf, who went into the final 18 holes tied with Miller at 202, finished with a 73 Sunday and a 275 total. He earned $20,400. 
Watson fired a 67, 4 under par for the Riviera Country Club course, during his regular round after start­ing 2 strokes off the pace, while Mil­
ler had a 2-under-par 69 and seemed 
in a safe position until the final two 
holes. He overshot the 17th and was 
short on the 18th. 
Watson parred both holes to force 
the playoff. He might have won with· 
out the extra three holes had he 
made a birdie putt of less than five 
feet on the 17th hole. 
Tied at fourth were Lennie Cle­
ments and Bill Rogers, the latter the 
PGA player of the year for 1981, 
with each earning $13,200. Cle­
ments had a 66 Sunday and Rogers . 70, gving them total scores of 276. 
Watson hit into bunkers on the 
first two extra holes but still 
managed to salvage his pars.
