play an important part in this 
program by preparing a Jist of 
interested faculty members to be 
distributed to the halls. 
The most important body 
concerning hall life will be the 
Hall President's Council in Bar­
kett's plan. He said that the 
Council would be concerned 
with areas such as better rela­
tions between hall rectors and 
hall presidents and improving 
communications between the 
students and the administration. 
Speaking on the amount of power that the hall rectors should have, Barkett pointed out that the rector must have enough power to enforce the rules of the hall. He emphasized that while this power is neces­sary the rector should never be allowed to misuse it. He con­tinued "if there is too much tension in the hall because of the rector something must be done." 
Barkett explained that another of his concerns is that of minorities. He said that there should be more recruitment of minorities both by the Univer­sity and by the students. He explained that students could work during breaks and vaca­tions and that Student Govern~ ment would be willing to spon­sor recruitment. Barkett who is feels that an all-Black residence would not allow the interaction of the minorities that is needed. 
Feeling that St. Mary's will be absorbed by ND in the near future, Barkett outlined a plan to aid co-education. He warned "the merging of the two schools will not be a cure for all our problems. It will only be a begin­ning for us to work from." 
He propost::d a merger of the student governments, and a re-

He added that several of the 
planks in HPC Chairman John 
Barkett's platform were 
"plageries" from the Student 
Government trustees report. 
Addressing himself to some of 
the specific planks in Barkett's 
platform, Krashna called the 
charge that student government 
funds had been mishandled "a 
lie."

Bureau to include the placement of women. Also stated were plans for a building program that would lead to a male-female ratio of 2 to 1 in three or four years. 
Concerning the off-campus students, Barkett mentioned several plans to bring them closer to campus life. He said that more information concern­ing campus activities would be made available to them.

"There is no power to be had in student government," Krashna continued, adding that he ran for SBP because of his concern for Notre Dame not because of "a personal power drive." 
Winings added, "We · should have screamed a helluva lot sooner but we nJver deviated from our original campaign proposals. The cultural program has never been as good as this year. We have done a lot more than just put coffee in the basement of LaFortune."

Sherry again urged a two dollar raise in the student activities fee so that the halls might receive more funds. He stressed that "our roles as student leaders should be to deal with the halls." 
Krashna and Winings distinguished between their present administration and the student governemnt proposed by Mooney and Sherry. In his speech, Krashna severely criticized student publications, specifically The Observer. He also pointed out what he felt were the shortcomings of John Barkett's platform. The bulk of his speech however was concerned with the many successes Winings and he had achieved but had failed to make the news. Winings elaborated on the specific issues. He· backed his statements with documented evidence and told the students that the only way to get things done at the university was to have "conforntations with those concerned" and "not be nice." Mooney said that while he is not a true continuation of the present student government, he is "proud to have been

Rich Sherman stresses student action 
Rich Sherman, the "Be Real" SBP candidate, said in a 5peech in Flanner Pit last night, that most students are "sick and tired of political rhetoric." 
Sherman said he felt that stu­dents had, over the last two years, heard much talk and seen little action from their represent­atives in Student Government. He emphasized the importance of action. 
"Before you can get students involved in Student Govern­ment," he said, " you have to do something for them." 
The Sherman-Murphy plat­form is geared to offer real solutions to problems. Last night Sherman addressed himself to problems that might surface shoultl the University go co-ed­ucational. 
He cited the laundry and the Student Union building. He felt 

Barkeff coils for greater recruitment 
by Jerry Lutkus ,, 
John Barkett called for "in­creased minority re¢tuitment" last night while clarif}-ing points in his platform during a short interview. 
Barkett said he hoped that minority recruitment in the future could be carried on out-· side a 100 mile radius of the school. "We hope to work in close co-operation with the ad­missions office," Barkett stated. "And if necessary and only if necessary student government should b~;: willing to donate some 
funds to aid the recruitment:·' 
Barkett felt that student gov­ernment could be most effective in this area by donating its time during the vacation breaks. He also said that "with co-education 
as a  nearing reality, we  have to  
begin  recruiting  black  women  
for the school."  

Barkett termed Don Mooney's proposal on the Student Associa­tion "interesting." He felt that it was vague. "I can only see it working if the students are very frustrated or very oppressed. I just don't see it working." 
He also objected to the change in structure. "That's changing the structure and I don't see that the problem lies there. The problem lies in the people and in misplaced priori­ties." 
Barkett made note of the fact that Phil McKenna ran on a student senate platform, David Krashna on a student forum idea, neither of which materializ­ed, and now Don Mooney is "carrying the torch" with his Student Association. 
According to Barkett, the Stu­dent Union handled its funds very well this year, but he felt that there is a need for a Student Government Comptroller to handle the funds of the govern­ment. 

Hendrick qualifies co-ed statement; Contests present student center 
by Greg Pudhorosdsky 
SBP candidate Chip Hendrick denied last night that he had taken a stand against coeduca­tion at Notre Dame in his cam­paign platform. 
Hendrick clarified his position as one of "concern" for the minority of students who do not presently favor the transition to coeducation. 
Hendrick stated that the move to coeducation, mo matter what form it takes, would most likely be implemented after the Board of Trustees meets next month. Though there have been numb­erous candidates, he contended, that have discussed the facets of integrating coeducation at Notre Dame, no candidate has given any regard to that student who for various reasons opposed co­education and thus to whom the transition would prove detri­mental. 
Outlining his conception of 

this type of student, Hendrick 
pointed to the individual who 
would not fare well in the com­
petition of "pairing off"· 
which he felt would take place in the occurrence of the eventual co-residential dorm life. He felt that student government should put itself in the position where it could help this student. 
He went on to point out that 
a similiar situation existed. for, 
the student who felt that the 
university of he himself would 
be harmed academically by the 
change to co-education. 
Hendrick contended that one of the major ways in which student government could facili­tate the changeover is to make an effort to provide a true stu­dent center. Pointing to inade­quacies of LaFortune in terms of facilities, appearance, and size he contested that in essence ~ student center is exactly what the name implies," a center of student life." 
Though he admitted the im­possibility of extablishing a cen­ter a level existing at other uni­versities overnight he felt that immediate action could be taken which would better the situation as it currently exists in LaFor­tune. 
Following the same line of thought Hendrick argued that

the laundry service might cease because women would be reluct­ant to send their clothes to it. He also felt that the Student Union building, as is, is unattrac­tive. 
Sherman spoke out against proposals of other candidates that suggested student govern­
ment involvement outside the 
realm vf the university He noted 
that the SBP is elected to serve 
the students. "There are enough 
problems here at Notre Dame to 
concern the government of 
Notre Dame," he said. 
Sherman and Murphy also ex­pressed a willingness to listen to student's complaints and sug­gestions. Sherman said, " It is so hard to get people to listrn to me, I know how they (students) feel." 
Regarding student interest ·and ideas Murphy termed them "our most valuable resource." 
In  closing,  Murphy  said,  
"Anything changing the charac­ 
ter  of  the  University  will  be  
done by the Board of Trustees  
and the big brass."  ....,  
Sherman  concurred  adding,  
"The students just don't have the  j  
power  to  change  the  Universi­ j  
ty."  

Co-ed proposal passed; voting misuse noted 
The student body of Notre Dame voted in favor of the coeducational proposal last night by a 2361 to 396 (83.6% to 14.4%) vote. There was some problem, according to Student Gover,,ment sources, in that there were two ballot boxes with no identification on them, and there were charges in some halls 
interest must be stirred now in 
the student body for the need of 
a student center if the facility is 
to ever get off the ground. 
Turning his attention to 
another "forgotten" aspect of 
the co-education question, Hen­
drick discussed an interview he 
had with James Bickel, the 
mayor-comptroller attorney of 
South Bend. The SBP candidate 
claimed that Bickel was unaware 
or the need for off-campus 
housing that would arise as a 
result of co-education and the 
resultant room squeeze. 
Bickel stated that the city 
would be willing to help in the 
possible fields of promoting 
private industry to construct in­
expensive housing and to per­
haps provide added security for 
female residents. 
Hendrick also brough up the issue of concerts and claimed that the reason that more note­worthy concerts do not occur at Notre Dame is because the [people who have been in chan~e 

just haven't been working hard enough. He suggested the pos­sibility of a spring stadium con­cert. the uniqueness and economics of which would enable it to be a "memorable experience."

No ~resident. No real community government. In short, no real direction. This is 9:. 
~iary's, March 1971. This is the problem facing the new Student Body President of St. 
Mary's College. She must be able to work with an unstable structure in all areas: 
academic structural, governmental. She must be willing to accept the limitations which 
the prese~t situation places upon her, and offer strong stable leadership in the changing 
atmosphere. 
It is with this in mind that The Observer enthusiastically and unanimously endorses 
Jane Sheehy and Sue Welte for tile positions of Student Body President and Student 
Body Vice-President for the coming year. 
This team is the most diversified of the three running. The SBP candidate, a junior and 
President of McCandless Hall, and the SBVP candidate, a sophomore and a class 
president, elucidate a realistic way of dealing with the problems the new SBP rrust 
undertake. Their concerted program lays a good foundation for flexible growth and 
~xpansion in all areas of the college. 
The main concern of the new President will be coeducation. Miss Sheehy favors a "This is no m~~re campaign gimmick--we are broke. •• 
realistic cluster plan, making use of the advantages of assimilation into a large university 
while at the same time acknowledging the usefulness of a small co-ed academic 
community. 
But she remains flexible, willing to work in whatever structure she is presented. She 
acknowledges the necessity of close cooperation between the two student governments, 
while at the same time acknowledging that governnment at St. Mary's must be rescued 
from the corrosion under which the administration has currently placed it. 
We applaud Miss Sheehy's concern with academic reforms at St. Mary's since it is 
primarily an academic community. I-Cr acknowledgement that SMC rrust distinguish

Counseling Center open house tomorrow 
Chocolate Soldier, in G. B. Shaw's comedy ARMS AND THE MAN 

by Cassell Lawson & Marilyn Ginder 
On friday, February 26, an open will be held in the Counseling ter from l :00 p.m. to 4:00p.m. The is to acquaint students with opportunities in Counseling . The Counseling Center is in Room 315 of the tion Building. In 1966 the of Guidance and Testing gave ay to the Counseling Center, and in 967 the Psychological Services Center created as a seperate center to help with more serious emotional !ems. The Counseling Center is under direction of Prof. Sheridan P. e, a quiet bespectacled, relevant 
tsv:chc>lolnst. In addition to Dr. McCabe professional staff includes, Father . Boland, Dr. Paul Banikiotes and Dr. Singer, who is part-time. There are doctoral level graduate students trainees and who receive npnn""''" from the professional staff. The most frequent question asked by n interested student will perhaps be, hat is Counseling Psychology?" Counseling Psychology as a discipline is new, having developed from hree emerging trends, vocational uidance, psychometrics, and personality 1evelo:nn1ent. The primary emphasis of unseling Psychology today is: (a) the ment of an individual's perception himself; (b) the individual's of harmony with his ent; (c) the influencing of ty to recognize the individual's hs rather than his weaknesses; and the client's utilization of 
Lettuce boycott planned 
The United Farm Workers Organi­g Committee, AFC-CIO, ha~ an­ounced the opening of a campaign to coot non-union lettuce in the South area. The grape boycott: was sue­but many areas of farm labor re­to be unionized and organized gainst the exploitation practiced by t~e gri-business corporations. The commit· ee seeks to drive home to the general ublic the fact that their indifference nd lack of concern is in large part res­ponsible for keeping the farm laborers in 
position. 
The food-purchas\ng agent of the Uni­vtrsity of Notre Dame has only two offi­cial criteria in his purchasing policy ­"quality and price"~ Fr. Hesburgh has said, in response to queries, that, al­though he sympathizes with Cesar Chavez' movement, hi! has issued no or­ders as purchasing · poticy because: I) the trustees do not approve of the univer­sity's supporting the ',boycott; 2) Once you start on the road of boycotting, there's no stopping; 3) such a boycott would place undue r~strictions on the purchasing department; and 4) the deci­sion is ultimately up to the individual stu­environmental resources as well as his self-perceptions. 
The most important aspect of this specialty is the focus on plans individuals must make to play productive roles in their social environments. This focus is on the individual's assets, skills, strengths, and possibilities for further development rather than upon whether the individual being helped is sick or well, abnormal or normal. Personality difficulties as such are-dealt with only when they construct obstacles to the individual's formost progress. 
.Counseling Psychology has developed a concept of :ole and function which is broader than vocational guidance but different from clinical psychology in its. emphasis upon development, assessment, plans, and role rather than personality organization.
The Department of Graduate Studies 
in Education offers a doctoral program in 
Counseling Psychology. This program 
operates in close conjunction wit!l me 
Counseling Center at the University of 
Notre Dame. The Department has a 
humanistic orientation with a heavy 
emphasis on the development of 
innovative approaches to deal with the 
pressing social problems of ow times. 
In addition to the study of personality 
and counseling theories, human 
development, tests and measurements, 
and research methodology, there is a 
strong focus in the service aspect of the 
training program, particularly as it relates. 
to community work and consultation. 
The Counseling Center is involved in 
several areas of Counseling. Group 
counseling takes place, with individual 
dent. 

The first point doesn't deserve com­ment. The second, that once one takes a stand on something one will have to take a stand on others, is a curious argument for a supposedly Christian university to present. If other products deserve to be boycotted, they deserve to be boycotted. The third point is closely related to the second -there's no denying that a moral life is more complex than a narcisstic one. The fourth point is an attempt to duck the issue that the university's purchasing power is presently being used aas a force against the boycott. The purchasing of non-union lettuce cannot be considered to be a neutral action. 
If the students on this campus refuse to eat lettuce, Fr. Hesburgh says that the university will stop buying it. He does not offer the possibility of buying union let­tuce. If it has to be no lettuce at all, then, perhaps the students at this university could give up lettuce for lent. It does not seem likely that any students will perish from lettuce starvation. It does seem likely that many thousands of chicano farm laborers will die an early death from environmentally determined factors un­less they can break out of their poverty­-cycle. 
National Players here 
This week-end members of the Notre Dame-South Bend community will have the opportunity of seeing one of the oldest and most highly respected touring repertory companies in the United States. The National Players sponsored by the Contemporary Arts Festival will perform George Bernard Shaw's anti-war comedy Arms and the Man on Saturday, February 27 and Shakespeare's Twelfth Night on Sunday February 28 .. Both productions will start at 8:30 PM at O'Laughlin Auditorium. Admission is $3.00 for adults, $2.00 for students, and $1.00 for CAF patrons. 
counseling sometimes includes aptitude and interest testing. The Center also helps in Consulting, particularly hall orientation for freshman, and has helped Farley Hall with their program. Another area is in "Outreach" activities. The Environmental Counseling Program has counseling trainees engaged· in ordinary student life, living in the halls and 
meeting students around the campus. , The peak times for counselijng are 
December, January, and February, but the Counseling Center is open all year, and it seeks to make itself available to all students. One way is through the field office that has been opened in Alumni Hall. It seeks face to face contact with 
students, as well as cooperation from resident assistants in the halls, who can send people who need help. 
Outreach activities include academic 

courses to help in aiding the Cen~e(s training program, as well as a trammg program for personnel in the model cities program of South Bend, and plans for a project at Marian High School. The Counseling Center also refers people to other counseling resources such as draft counseling. 
The mission of the Counseling Center 


Angel Flight explained 
by Mary Sue Horvat 
Angel Flight is a relatively new organization on campus that has been greatly misunderstood. It has been mastakenly compared to various other groups ranging from organizations like the Girl Scouts to female militaristic air plane pilots. Now, however, the truth about the Angels will come out, and that ever-present question, "What is Angel Flight?" will be answered. 
Angel Flight is an organization of girls that works in cooperation with the Air Force R.O.T.C. in service projects that help and take an interest in people in the univeristy and the community. Service and people are the main concern of the Angels. Angel Flight also helps to advance and promote interest in the Air Force and supports the Arnold Air Society and Air Force R.O.T.C. 
The Angels have no obligations to the service after college, they do not fly or jump out of airplanes, and they do not sell cookies. They do work with the underpriviledged children, mentally retarded, and the elderly people in nursing homes, and other people in the area who need their assistance. Their projects this year include having a halloween party for the children of Logan Center; a party for a nursing home in the area, a clothing drive later this spring for needy children; and recently a number of Angels and Arnolds helped the Ladies of Notre Dame set up a house for men who have just been released from prison. The Angels also work with Arnold Air Society members on projects, such as the building and operating of the Mardi Gras Booth is to assist the students in becoming more effective as persons and as students. The Counseling provided is an extension of and a resource for the counseling function of the faculty. 

The basic good of the Counseling Center is helping students find out exactly what they want to do and how they want to do it, before confusion and uncertainty close off vital life patterns and career choices. Another goal is to establish a relationship with the counselee and vice versa, in order to facilitate a client's chances of actualizing himself, and facing up to life effectively and creatively. This can do a great deal to upgrade student life. 
The staff welcomes you to drop in the Counseling Center and get acquainted with the career opportunities and its facilite at any time.

this month -remember the Lunar Module? 
Angel Flight is conducted on a military basis. The Angels follow military rules, forms, they have uniforms which are worn on official occasions, and they may attend the Air Force drills each week. The officers have ranks such as Major, Captain, First Lieutenant, etc. 
Angel Flight is a nation wide 
1 organization and has been in existence since 1952, when it was founded by the Arnold Air Society at the Thiversity of Omaha. Our flight, the Benjamin D. Foulois Squadron was just founded last year by two ambitious and dedicated 
A.A.S. members; Jeff Karrenbauer and Dennis Walsh. There were eleven Angels. This year, the flight has just gotten things "off the ground" with the acquisition of their wings and cords, and by getting the 
Flight to be Nationally recognized. At the present there are six Angels, commanded by Major Aimee Tiemeier and Executive officer, Captain Sharon Verniero. There are also seven "pledges" who will become full-fledged Angels this Sunday. A pledge is a girl who wants to become an Angel and who is going through an orientation period before whe is accepted. A pledge program lasts four weeks and is concluded with an exam and the presentation of a cord and wings. This second and final pledge program this year will begin Sunday n\ght, with an information night, Feb. 28, at 7 pm at the Augusta Hall, S.M.C. All girls who are interested in Angel Flight should come at this time. Angel Flight needs people who want to help.

Sigh of Dissent

Editor: 

For many months, I have heard sharp cries of protest from almost every organization on campus: the Student Govern­ment, the Administration, and the Observer_. However, I have heard not one sigh of dissent from the University itself. By the University I mean the stu­dent body. It is that group of beings that form the very exis­tence of Notre Dame. Therefore, I speak as a membeJ;" of that body in criticism of myself and the SB in general. 
First, I am stupid and ignor­ant. I call myself that because I have done and perceived nothing. For example, I have allowed a saprophagous student government exist that has done absolutely nothing concerning the issues now at hand, i.e. co-education and hall life. And, I have neither commented, com­plimented, nor critisized. 
Another thing that I had left unreproached is campus housing. At present, some of the mem­bers of this institution will be forced to live off campus, against their will. One of the major reasons I came to Notre Dame was the advantage of liv­home that had academic stan­dards as good as, or possibly better than Our Lady. Yet, I came here because Jwas glad for the opportunity to live on a college campus away from home. If I was told to move off campus, and then asked if I would be returning to Our Lady, I would say "Hell no!" 
If the administration was so foolish as to not recognize the housing problem years ago, then the student body should have had the foresight to see the on coming difficulties, and it should have taken the initiative to press for a solution. However, silence reigned and many will suffer a great deal of dissatisfaction in 
their new homes. 

The last thing that I will mention will probably receive much criticism. In order to an­swer those who may feel like attacking me, allow me to make this one statement. Those who .criticize boldly and blindly are often blind to the truth and deaf to their hearts. 
The matter in question con­
cerns not only many members of 
this community of scholars, but 
also many who support N.D. In

earlier) criticism of a variety of

tian." I believe that it is time 
that many come to a realization 
of exactly what they are saying. 
The terms they use remind me 
of the Inquisition and their tone 
rings with repression. 1\bt once 
have I heard one speak of free­
dom to choose and openness to 
one another in referring to a 
"Christian Community". The 
banner of "Christianity" that 
many wave is covering their eyes 
to reality. 
All in all, I have said much. I also know that I will probably do nothing about the things I have said. Things will never change, so I might as well leave Our Lady in search of a better place. But, I probably won't do that either. For some reason, I just don't care anymore. 
Elmo P. Tanner 
Kunstler? 
Editor: 
The selection of William Kun­
stler as the Senior Fellow for the 
class of 1971 is indefensible. By 
it Notre Dame confers legJli­
macy and respectability upon a 
man whose position is deliber­
ately disruptive of the concept 
and system of justice upon 
which this republic depends. 
What is incredible about this 
travesty is neither the decision 
of the undergraduates nor the 
acquiescence of the University 
administration, but r:.:ther the 
remarkable willingness of the 
parents to continue paying for 
this sort of thing. 
Sincerely, 
Charles E. Rice 


No Racism! 
Editor: 
1 am sick and tired of people 
being called racists whenever 
they oppose anything relating to 
blacks. Specifically, I am talking 
about some people's reaction to 
the deletion of point seven of 
the Coed Proposal that was 
before the Student Assembly 
which stated, in part, the "the 
university provide living facilities 
for black students (both male 
and female), determined by the 
discretion of the black student 
body." This part of the proposal 
infringes upon the non-black stu­
dent body by giving one group 
preferential treatment over them 

over have. A Christian University 
such as ours cannot openly en­
courage segregation such as this 
part of the proposal wouiJ al­
most invariably lead to. No 
group has the right to say, well, 
we want half of Sorin or half of 
Keenan, or we want a new hall 
aH for ourselves. If black stu­
dents want to live together, they 
can do it through existing chan­
·nels (e.g. look at Alumni). But it 
cannot be an official University 
policy to openly encourage or 
n:quire segreagated living facili­
ties. Thank you.

Religious Survey 
Editor: 
In a recent survey of the 
religious preferences of the 
Notre Dame student body, con­
ducted for the Director of Cam­
pus Ministry, the offices in­
volved did a commendable a­
mount of work, and came up 
with some excellent statistics a­
bout our "separated brethren" 
here on campus. I commend 
them for this aspect of the sur­
vey. 
I find it difficult, however, to 
commend them for another as­
pect of the survey. In checking 
with the Office of Campus Mini­
stry in order to obtain informa­
tion of Eastern Rite students at 
this University, I found that, 
according to the records they 
have, there are none. 
I do not believe that. 
I think I know the answer to 
the "lack" of Eastern Catholic 
students here, and I don't think 
that "minority religious recruit­
ment" has anything to do with 
h. 
The survey included such 
groups as Greek Orthodox, Sy­
rian Orthodox, etc., all of which 
were lumped together for the 
purposes of the summary as "Or­
thodox". Guess what happened 
to the Eastern Rite Catholics? 
They got lumped together with 
the "silent majority" of Roman 
Catholics because their Churches 
happen to be called "Byzantine ·Catholic", Melkite Catholic", or '';Maronite Catholic"--they were 
termed "Catholic"! 
This surely tells something a­
bout the educational level of 
those engaged in the survey. 
And, for their further informa­
tion, I might point out the Mel­

Open letter to the people of Notre Dame: I would like to oppose the 
candidacy of Eileen Fitzpatrick, and urge you not to vote for her on the grounds that she docs .not qualify as a candidate for Stu­dent Body President, because whe is not a member of the Notre Dame student body. Her contention that she does qualify since she takes all her classes here, is immaterial, because those situations with which a representative of the people of Notre Dame must deal occur outside the classroom.

John Pleick has come on to give the Irish a consistent pme balance. Offers to the post-season tourney are due out tomorrow morning and a loss to the Flyers could cause the selection committee to pass the Irish by. 
Thanks to some late heroics by captain Austin Carr and a sizzling shooting performance by big Sid Catlett, ND enters tonight'-s tilt 17-7. The Irish stuffed the Redmen in the can early, then had to hold down the lid as St. John's rallied to cut a 20-point deficit to six. 
The game was played before an SRO house in Jamaica, N.Y. last Saturday night and featured a battle between the vaunted scoring ability of NO's Carr and the leaping ability of the Redmen's super soph Mel Davis. Though Carr had a below average night with 32 points, his clutch play in the last ten minutes helped the Irish withstand the strong St. John's comeback. 
Davis stands just under 6-7 but is a prodigious leaper. He cleaned the d~fensive boards all night and was credited with 21 rebounds, 13 in the first half. Offensively, however, Davis met his match in NO's Collis Jones who battled him head to head. Jones out-scored Davis 21-19 and even blocked a few of the latter's shots. Though only a so ph Davis has a chance to break the St. John's career rebounding mark this year. 
The Irish threw a stout man-to-man defense at St. John's, and the Redmen were unable to penetrate it throughout the first half. Numerous turnovers (18 on the night) and a cold shooting hand held the St. John's offense to a minimum. The only man able to score with any consistancy was 6-5 soph Bill Schaeffer who canned 13 points. 
The high-scoring Carr was the victim of a collapsing man-to-man defense which "held" him to I 6 first half lead and steadily widened the advantage. Balanced scoring from Jones (11 points), Catlett 
(1 0) and Tom Sinnott (8) sent ND to the locker room up 49-29. Sinnott played in the place of Jackie Meehan who was bothered by an ailing knee. 
But along with a 20-point lead, the Irish picked-up a bushe' of fouls and this tendency hurt them early in the second half. Catlett, who blitzed St. John's with a 7 for 8 shooting performance, got his 4th foul at 
13: 50 and it put the Redmen in the bonus situation. St. John's began to get more balanced scoring and Davis continued to hound the boards. 
With Catlett and Sinnott on the bench with four fouls apiece, the Redmen made several runs at the Irish. 6-8 Greg Cluess and 6-0 Rich Lyons led charges which cut the ND lead to ten 
(11 :40) and six points (7:40). Irish coach Johnny Dee sent Catlett and Sinnott back in and then Carr went to work. 
Held in check most of the half, Austin broke loose for II points in the next five minutes to put the game out of reach. Catlett and Sinnott fouled out, but Jones and John Pleick helped Carr hold off the Redmen. Johnny Egart, who replaced Sinnott several times 
during the contest, scored the last four Irish points to make the final score 92-79. 
There were several encouraging factors in the game for the Irish. First, they were out-rebounded 40-32, yet still managed a solid victory. Second, Carr was held to only 1 8 shots from the field, 10 below his average. The Irish responded with a balanced attack, shooting 52% from the field. This performance might tend to discourage teams from over-loading on Austin in the future.

"This is my 21st year at St. Mary's College. I am sure that I was working here for the good of the college before many of the students sitting here before me were even born." 
She then asked the students present to give "one good reason 
why  I  should  want  to  do  
anything  to  harm  the  college  
community in  this last  year in  

which I have been asked to hold a difficult and responsible posi­tion?" 
"I am not asking this question for any personal satisfaction. I am asking it of the students to try and make them realize that they by their negative and bitter criticisms of authority, are the ones who will harm the college community spirit," she reported. 
"I would not have you parents believe that this is true of all students," Sr. Alma added. "It is true of only a minority but unfortunately a thoughtless and articulate minority. I have seen the college in difficult times before, but truth has prevailed and stormy issues have blown over."

·'This has increased tensions which unfortunately have been released in irresponsible, nega­tive criticism instead of positive constructive ideas. I am a very firm believer in divine providence. St. Mary's College has existed for 126 years." 
"It has constantly tried to renew itself with the changing times of the academic world" she commented, "but still retain its Christian character and values. ·
