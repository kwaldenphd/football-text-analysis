Special to the Observer 
Thomas Morris, associate professor of philosophy at Notre Dame, has been named 1990 Indiana Professor of the Year by the Council for the Ad­vancement and Support of Edu­cation (CASE). 
According to CASE, the Pro­fessor of the Year program salutes the most outstanding undergraduate instructors in each state in the country, espe­cially those who excel as teach­ers and influence the lives and careers of their students and former students. 
Aself-proclaimed "intellectual evangelist," Morris said he seeks to convince people of the importance of ideas and to show people that thinking about philosophical issues can be productive. 
"Sometimes," he said, "especially in the modern world, we feel like we're lost in the woods without a map or a compass. Philosophers are just cartographers of the spirit, map makers of the human journey. That's the importance of philosophy, to help us get out bearings, to help us get our orientation in life." 
"These philosophical topics that I deal with on a daily basis, these are the most important ideas that anybody could ever think about, and so I've got to get the word out." he said. 
Morris credits his success to his unique approach to teach­ing. "I ask myself what it will take to help the students make the transition from the dining hall, from their dorm room. I want to help wake some people up because that gets their bod­ies and their minds at a little bit higher level of alertness and awareness and then I can use that level of alertness for the ideas that I want to present." 
According to Morris, every

Observer Staff Report 
Indiana colleges and universi­ties would be required to de­velop drug education and ser­vice plans for students and workers under a recommenda­tion of Governor Evan Bayh's Commission for a Drug-Free Indiana. 
The commission's report, called "Toward a Drug-Free Indiana: A Strategic Report to the Governor," was issued this month by its 15-member steer­ing committee, including Uni­versity President Father Ed­ward Malloy. 
In supporting comprehensive drug abuse prevention and in­tervention programs for Indi­ana's post-secondary educa­tional institutions, the Commis­sion noted that the 150,000 traditional-age students thus affected make up the largest block of highest-risk individuals in the state. 
"Alcohol is the most prevalent drug of abuse on Indiana's col­lege campuses and needs to be the main focus of attention," the report said. "The next gen­eration of opinion leaders now resides on Indiana's college and university campuses. If we want to have an impact on [their] drug-related attitudes, beliefs,

gimmick he uses must contain a hint of some greater philosoph­ical message. "I would never just bring a football or a base­ball and toss it around the room unless it made a philosophical point of some sort. When we throw a frisbee, we always throw at targets. Does the frisbee hit the target? Does the idea hit the target? There has to be some carry over." 
Recently Morris was featured as part of the University Lec­turers Series on The Learning Channel. His introduction to philosophy lecture, "The Ethics of Everyday Life" is airing on cable in October. 
For the last seven years, Morris has directed a summer seminar for elementary and secondary school teachers on Pascal's Pensees, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. 
In addition, for three sum­mers he has taught in the Elderhostel program for retired persons. He has found speaking with school, church and com­munity organizations especially rewarding. 
Two professors at the Uni­versity of North Carolina in­spired Morris to his vocation. "The first time in my life my eyes were opened to the ex­citement of ideas was when I was sitting in the lecture rooms 
Drug ed prescribed for Indiana schools 
with those two professors. And I have gone into the teaching of big classes in hopes of being able to pass on a little spark of that to other students.", he said. 
Morris was surprised when CASE announced he had been named 1990 Indiana Professor of the Year. "There are a lot of very good universities and col­leges in the state of Indiana, more than thirty," he said. "And I know a lot of dedicated faculty members in the state, who are very creative, devoted to their teaching, who are sterling researchers. And so it was a big surprise and a real great honor.' 
"I've always tried to use my own creativity to develop new ways of communicating with the students," he said, "because I am firmly convinced that standing in front of a room of people and talking is not the same thing as teaching."

esc to sponsor presentation on understanding human sexuality 
By DAVID KINNEY 
News Writer 
Understanding our bodies, gender, sex roles and orienta­tion will be addressed during an upcoming presentation and discussion sponsored by the Center for Social Concerns and the Year of Women. 
The event will be comprised of a presentation, a question and answer period and optional time for discussion and reflec­tion. 
Patricia Livingston, the asso­ciate director of the Center for Continuing Formation in Ministry at Notre Dame and re­cipient of the 1990 U.S. Catholic Award, will lead the presentation on "Understanding and Claiming our Sexuality." 
"Sexuality is more that geni­tality," said Livingston, who hopes to go beyond the usual topic of humans as sexual be­ings who must come to terms with their bodies. It is her hope that her presentation will not end as soon as the students have left the building, but that students will reflect on the ideas and, ultimately, integrate them into their lives. 
The lecture will address the three aspects of human sexual­ity: primary, which means un­derstanding our complex feel­ings about our bodies; genital, the physical nature of our sex­uality; and affective, the need and ability to express our sex­uality to others. 
Livingston will present exam­ples that fit into life at Notre Dame, and "wants to incorpo­rate the opinions of the stu­dents," according to Father Don McNeil, director of CSC. 
This commitment to commu­nicating with her audience on their level was evident during a meeting last night, during which she asked a group of students a variety of questions in order to get a better per­spective of life at Notre Dame. 
No stranger to the campus, Livingston, a divorced Catholic mother of three, has often lec­tured and provided retreats on sexuality, relationships, and play in the context of faith. 
"We need to develop mascu­line and feminine sides of our­selves," she has said. "Men and women are meant to be in rela­tionship." It is this message that both Livingston and the Year of Women hope to communicate to the students of Notre Dame this year. 
The presentation will take place on September 26 at 7:30 
p.m. at the Keenan-Stanford Chapel.

The state's Commission on Higher Education was given re­sponsibility for implementing the recommendation, and the estimated cost of doing so was $1 million.

Kipnapping, assault charges will face Winnie Mandela 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -The government said Tuesday it will charge Winnie Mandela with kidnapping and assault, a move that could endanger its peace talks with her husband's African National Congress. 
Mrs. Mandela, wife of ANC 
leader Nelson Mandela, will be 
charged in the alleged 
abduction and beatings of four 
young men at her home in 
December 1988. One of them, 
14-year-old Stompei Seipei, was 
found dead. 
Mrs. Mandela's bodyguard, 
Jerry Richardson, was 
convicted of murdering Seipei 
and sentenced to death last 
month. At his trial, the 
surviving victims testified that 
Mrs. Mandela, 56, beat them 
with a whip. She has denied 
wrongdoing. 
The announcement came as 
Mandela, the country's best­
known black leader, met with 
other ANC officials to discuss 
the police crackdown on black 
factional fighting in townships 
around Johannesburg. 
Mandela on Monday threatened to suspend the peace talks if the government fails to halt the carnage that has killed nearly 800 blacks since Aug. 12. Most of the fighting has been between Xhosa and other black ANC supporters and the Zulu-based conservative lnkatha movement. 
He said new police measures announced Saturday, including reinforcements, roadblocks weapons searches and mounted machine guns on police vehicles, would be "ineffective" and were a "license to kill" for security forces. 
Mandela has staunchly defended his wife and might be encouraged by supporters to break off talks if the government proceeds with the prosecution. 
President F.W. de Klerk and Mandela met twice last week and both say they want black­white talks on ending apartheid to move forward as quickly as possible. But the township battles, combined with the 
charges against Mrs. Mandela, make setbacks appear more likely than breakthroughs. 
Klaus von Lieres und Wilkau, attorney general for the Johannesburg Supreme Court, had said he would await completion of the Richardson case before deciding whether to charge Mrs. Mandela. 
"After careful consideration of all the relevant facts, including possible implications beyond the normal legal ones, I have decided to prosecute Mrs. Mandela." he said in a statement. 
There was no immediate com­ment from Mrs. Mandela or her husband. 
They have accused the government of using the case as a propaganda campaign against them and the ANC, the largest black opposition group.

The Observer is the independent newspaper published by the students of the

University of Notre Dame du Lac and Saint Mary's College. It does not necessarily

accurately and objectively as possible. Unsigned editorials represent the opinion of the majority of the Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor, News Editor, Viewpoint Editor, Accent Editor, Photo Editor, and Saint Mary's Editor. Commentaries, letters and Inside Column present the views of the authors.

of your options. Don't you want to get married and have chil­dren someday?" 
Co-ed: "Yes, but my more immediate concern is learning about graduate school and other opportunities. That is why I came to see you." 
Does this sound like the ex­perience of a female college student in the 1950s? Unfortunately, this scenario is quite similar to an actual con­versation one of the authors had with a Notre Dame profes­sor last spring. 
It is nearly impossible to imagine a professor posing the same questions to an equally competent male student. It seems highly doubtful that a professor would seek to dis­suade a male student from post-B.A. work. The sJ,lbject of marriage and family would probably not be mentioned by an advisor as considerations for a male student. Indeed, it would seem that an academic advisor's primary objective when approached by a promis­ing student of either sex would be to present all of the relevant opportunities in the student's field of interest and let the stu­dent proceed from there. 
In our scenario, the ND woman did not ask for advice about how to integrate mar­riage, family and career. Such considerations are important for both sexes as they make choices in life. However, these considerations were presented to the student solely because of her sex. Her in~uiry was specif­ically geared toward gaining information about post-gradu­ate academic and career oppor­tunities, not discussing her fu­ture personal life choices. 
We wonder whether Professor Patriarchy's question 
LETTERS 
.-o.S d .Sho£,(/d 6e ... 

concerning the woman's fa­ther's opinion indicates that he felt she needed a male authority figure to aid in her decision-making. Again, it seems unlikely he would ask this of a male student. By the time a student reaches the end of college, she or he can and should make such decisions independently. 
In recounting this story, it has not been our intention to indict faculty. Our primary goal is to open the eyes and ears of all on this campus to the gender stereotypes which we all harbor. Unless we confront our real experiences, encourage di­alogue about similar situations and move to change our behav­ior in the appropriate direction, the Year of Women will pay mere lip-service to gender is­sues.

Senior spirit supports the Irish through the fourth quarter 
Dear Editor: 
As Notre Dame seniors, we were particularly offended by the Inside Column in the Sept. 17 issue of The Observer. 
Miss Pavlis accurately described the attitude of the seniors at the start of the game concerning seats; however, we feel that we have been falsely blamed for a bad situation. There is no legitimate explanation for being forced to sit 15 yards away from our seats (the ones we also waited three years to get), other than discourteous classmates and ushers more concerned with looking at the field than looking at ticket stubs. 
We would also like to address a few more of Miss Pavlis' con­cerns. Most true Irish fans, those who remain through the fourth quarter, will attest to the senselessness of "the wave." In addition, organizing important cheers such as "WE ARE ND," is extremely difficult from row 52 without the aid of the cheerleaders. We know our friends were celebrating and supporting our Irish from start to finish. 
We can think of no other place in which to celebrate great Irish victories than with our friends and fellow students in "the house that Rock built." However, we cannot support "fans" leaving the stadium early, especially when the Irish are down, for no better reason than to consume alcoholic bev­erages. All those seniors who remained, in the rain, to sup­port our team and sing the Alma Mater were the true Irish fans.

Industry Day benefits engineers 
Dear Editor: 
The Joint Engineering Council and the Society of Women Engineers are sponsoring Industry Day on Wednesday, Sept. 19. 
Industry Day provides an opportunity for students to interact with company repre­sentatives in an informal envi­ronment. Over 35 engineering companies are attending the fair this year, a record number for the event. 
Industry Day consists of a career fair, hors d'oeuvre hour and banquet. The career fair is held from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on the first and second floors of Fitzpatrick Hall (students should bring resumes); the hors d'oeuvre hour is from 5:30p.m. to 6:30 p.m. at the South Bend Marriott; it is sponsored by General Electric. The banquet, also at the South Bend Marriott, will begin at 6:30 p.m.. Students who registered for the banquet will receive their ticket in the campus mail. Off-campus students should pick up their ticket in the Engineering Student Center (217 Cushing Hall) before Wednesday. 
I strongly encourage all engi­neering students to participate in Industry Day. The companies are seeking engineers for sum­mer internships and full-time employment. It is an excellent opportunity for future employ­ment.

ND harbors dangerous gender-related biases 
Dear Editor: 
In recent days, we have been bombarded with articles in The Observer detailing the significance of the Year of Women. The discourse thus far has been filled with generalities. While this has been a good introduction, more serious discussion of the role and status of women at Notre Dame must reflect the realities of their condition on campus and in the classroom. One such reality includes the experience of young women with academic advisors. Picture the following discussion between a Notre Dame co-ed as she visits the office of one of her favorite professors, Professor Patriarchy, with the intention of 
r 
discussing post-graduate opportunities in his field of expertise:
f 
ND Co-ed: "I am really inter­
f 
( ested in going into the field of political science. I am currently
r 
r exploring graduate schools, in­
I ternships and foreign study. Do 
I you know of any outstanding programs in these areas that I might find interesting?" Professor Patriarchy: "Well, are you sure this is what you really want to pursue? The real world of political science is very demanding and competitive. What does your father think of your aspirations? Have you fully considered the challenges posed by study abroad and graduate school?" Co-ed: "Yes, I know it is a challenging field, but my quali­fications and drive match those of others who have succeeded in this area. I'm not sure why you asked about my father." Professor Patriarchy: "I'm sure your father is concerned about your future ideas. And I wonder if you've considered all

Defense needs work for Irish to beat State 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Sports Editor 
If Notre Dame is to continue its dominance over Big Ten opponents, Lou Holtz says there must be more co­hesiveness among the de­fense. 
The Irish, who have won 11 straight games against Big Ten foes, will meet Michigan State Saturday afternoon in Spartan Stadium in East Lansing. Kickoff is set for 
2:37 p.m. Notre Dame time. 
One of Holtz's main con­cerns entering Saturday's game is the togetherness and unity of the Irish defense, which gave up 24 points last Saturday against Michigan. 
"We have seven players up front and those seven players must move in unison," Holtz said. "Everyone has got to have a physical relationship with each other. A guy can't break any tackles when you have three guys coming at him at the same time." 
Michigan's mammoth offen­sive line cleared the way for tailback Jon Vaughn to gain a career high 201 yards last Saturday. That was the most since Penn State's Blair Thomas rushed for over 200 yards in 1987. 
The Irish, in turn, were able to rush for 234 yards as a team. 
"We've never been able to run the ball against Michigan and they've never been able to run against us," Holtz said. "We were both running up and down the field. It was crazy." 
Both Holtz and Irish players said Michigan's no-huddle of­fense had little effect in the game. It was also the first game for the defense under new defensive coordinator Gary Darnell. 
"It's an adjustment period," 
said Irish linebacker Scott 
Kowalkowski. "Every team 
has a different personality 
and we're still finding ours. 
We have to get more people 
to the ball. We're going to 
have to dictate to the offense 
more." 
The Irish defense should 
get a big test Saturday 
against the Spartans, who 
opened their season with a 
23-23 tie against Syracuse 
last weekend. Notre Dame 
won last year's game with 
the Spartans 21-13. 
Michigan State led the Big Ten in 1989 in total yards gained per game with 418. In the season opener last week­end, the Spartans gained 171 yards on the ground and an­other 155 through the air. Senior quarterback Dan Enos completed 12 of 23 passes for all 155 of those yards. 
"Michigan State played very very well last year," Holtz said. "Their offense is pretty well intact." 
Kowalkowski, who played at Orchard Lake Saint Mary's High School in Orchard Lake, Mich., could make it a clean sweep against schools from his home state. The Irish have defeated Michigan and Michigan State seven con­secutive times in Kowalkowski's tenure with the team. 
"Coming from Michigan, it has a little more value," he said. "I have a lot of friends on the team there. In the same respect, I have to look at it as another game on the schedule. I don't want to be so up for Michigan State that we come out flat against Purdue." 
Irish cornerback Todd Lyght is still listed as doubtful for Saturday's game.

After soundly defeating Val­paraiso in a game the Irish knew they should win, the Notre Dame men's soccer team faces a similar situation when they host the Detroit Titans in the final game of their three­game homestand tonight at 7:30p.m.

The Irish defeated the Titans both times they faced them last season, winning 4-3 in overtime at Detroit and 3-1 at home. In addition, Notre Dame is 2-0 against them in Krause Sta­dium. 
"Our main goal is to score early," said senior midfielder Steve LaVigne. "They're a lot better than people think. It's not going to be easy, but we're rolling and I think we'll be fine." 
The Irish hope they can con­tinue their aggressive play and put away the Titans early. Struggling with Detroit, a team like Loyola that they should beat, could hurt a Notre Dame team that needs be sharp going into a tough weekend against Michigan State and Marquette. 
Races heat up as Dodgers, Blue Jays win 
ATLANTA (AP) -Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy La­sorda says now is the time that all you can do is "hope and pray." 
On Tuesday it worked. 
Lasorda got a fine perfor­mance from rookie right-han­der Jim Neidlinger and Kal Daniels doubled home two runs and scored two as the Dodgers again crept within 4 1/2 games of Cincinnati in the National League West by defeating the Atlanta Braves 6-2. 
"In the situation we're in, you've got to win and get help from somebody else," Lasorda said after the Dodgers won for the fifth time in their last six games. "If you're playing the Podunk Yanks you've got to win. You can't split. If there were a month or a month-and­a-half to go it would be differ­ent." 
Giants 5, Reds 3 
CINCINNATI -Will Clark hit a pair of homers and Kevin Mitchell also homered for third­place San Francisco, which is 7 1/2 games out. Cincinnati's magic number for clinching its first division title since 1979 is 11. 
John Burkett (13-7) took a four-hitter and a 5-l into the ninth but needed help from Steve Bedrosian, who got his 13th save. The Giants' three homers -solo shots by Clark and Mitchell and a two-run homer by Clark -came off Tom Browning (13-9), who is 1­3 in five starts with an 8.78 ERA since spraining his left an­kle on Aug. 17. 
Blue Jays 3, Yankees 2 
TORONTO -Toronto moved into a first-place tie with Boston in the American League East on Tuesday night as Rance Mulliniks' run-scoring pinch single with two outs in the ninth inning gave the Blue Jays a 3-2 victory over the New York Yankees. 
The Blue Jays have won five straight games and 10 of their last 12, to equal Boston at 81­
68. The Blue Jays trailed Boston by 6 1/2 games on Sept. 4. 
Orioles 4, Red Sox 1 
BALTIMORE -Boston's Tom 
Bolton pitched 6 1-3 hitless innings before Baltimore solved him with four runs in the seventh, including rookie David Segui's three-run homer, as Orioles dropped the Red Sox into a first-place tie with Toronto. 
The Red Sox have lost five of six and 11 of 16. About the only good news they had Tuesday was Roger Clemens throwing hard on the sidelines and pen­ciled in to start on Sunday against the Yankees. 
Bolton (9-4) took his no-hitter and a 1-0 lead into the seventh, but he couldn't finish the inning as the Orioles got five hits ­four of them with two outs. 
Expos 4, Mets 3 
NEW YORK -The New York Mets blew another chance to move into first place in the National League East on Tuesday night, wasting Darryl Strawberry's dramatic game­tying three-run homer in the eighth inning and losing to the Montreal Expos 4-3 on pinch­hitter Junior Noboa's RBI single in the ninth. 
ND women's soccer hopes to continue victory streak 
By DAVE DIETEMAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's soccer team (3-2) wraps up its three game homestand against Saint Joseph's of Renesselar this evening at 5 p.m. at Moose Krause Stadium. 
So far this season, the Irish are an impressive 3-0 at home, with victories over Northeast Missouri State, Valparaiso, and Washington University. In the lifetime series against Saint Joseph's, Notre Dame holds a 2­0 edge. The Irish came away from last year's matchup with a 4-1 win.

nesselar, Indiana, is a member of the Great Lakes Valley Con­ference, as well as the NCAA's Division III. The Lady Pumas currently sport a 2-4 record, with wins coming over Trinity College and Northeast Missouri State (a 1-0 victory the day be­fore the Irish thumped NMSU 5­
1). 
"I'm sure that they will be ex­cited to play us," said Notre Dame head coach Chris Petru­celli. "They are a decent team, and they will give us a good struggle. It is very important that we do not look past this game to the weekend." 
Indeed it is. This weekend, the Irish will be hitting the road for their second two-game swing of the season. However, the Irish are not heading down to the southern sun for a reunion with Duke and Greensboro. Instead, they will be trekking north to the nippy climates of Michigan State and Marquette for two key regional games. Notre Dame's hopes for regional powerhouse status would certainly be dampened by a loss to Saint Joseph's. Additionally, the timing of such a loss would not help the Irish on their trip north. 
"We had a great weekend," said junior forward Susie Zilvi­tis, who leads the youthful Irish in scoring with four goals and three assists this season ( 11 points total). Two of her goals were game-winners. 
"I'm very optimistic about the team. We're young, but we're also talented. Our lack of expe­rience was evident on our trip to North Carolina, and it was tough to play those teams so early. Now we're getting expe­rience and putting in lots of hard work. This weekend started a roll for us. If we keep working hard, the rest of the season should be just fine," Zilvitis said. 
NOTES: The Notre Dame women's soccer team has been ranked 1Oth in the Midwest re­gion in the most recent poll of the ISAA coach's committee. According to reports, this is the first time in the history of Notre Dame women's varsity soccer that they have been ranked in the region. 
"This is a big step for our program," said Petrucelli, "but I also know that having a num­ber on a piece of paper does not necessarily mean that we've arrived. Going into the season, I expected us to reach a level where we would be ranked, but I expect it to be a lot higher. 
"These next three games are important to achieving that. If we can come up with a win over Michigan State, we will solidify ourselves in the Top 10."

son. Director of Athletics at Xavier University. "Notre Dame is in many cases better funded than most of our sports. but those are the targets to shoot for." 
Notre Dame does more than set an athletic standard for other MCC teams. It also pro­vides excellent sports facilities. including Rolfs Aquatic Center. Loftus Sports Center, Eck Ten­nis Pavilion and Stanley Cov­eleski Stadium. the home of the South Bend White Sox. 
"The strength of any program is always the people, and we have great respect for the administrators of Notre Dame," said Fogelson. "They definitely bring great things to the conference. They're willing and active participators in the conference. and we definitely appreciate that." 
For Notre Dame's part, its stated commitment to the MCC could not be clearer.

"We have had phenomenal success in the MCC," said Rosenthal. "I think that's prob­ably, personally, an aberration. We see the MCC schools getting significantly better in a variety of sports. 
"We believe it's the best way for our teams to have the chance at national competition. and because it gives us an af­fordable scheduling opportu­nity. All of our schools in the conference are within easy commutes, most of them by car." 
MCC: Affordable, Convenient 
Affordability and proximity are two advantages to staying in the MCC. When Notre Dame's participation in the MCC comes into question. the tantamount consideration is where the Irish will move. 
"I see how it would be very difficult for Notre Dame to exist as an independent and schedule as much because of other team's conference com­mitments," said Assistant Ath­letic Director Brian Boulac. "We'd be forced to play them when they had time, which would interfere with class schedules, and we would have to face certain realities." 
Central to those realities is the time commitment. Notre Dame athletes are not allowed to miss more than three days of school because of sports. This makes membership in almost any other conference not logis­tically feasible. 
Certain proponents have ad­vocated membership in the Big East. which although not within driving distance are inexpensive flights to metropolitan areas. Georgetown. St. John's, Vil­lanova. Pittsburgh and Boston College are near major airports. 
Although many Olympic sports. such as tennis, swim­ming and cross country. com­pete only in conference champi­onships, all team sports must play a substantial number of games, usually more than 20. This makes the possibility of air flights financially difficult. 
For all its inadequacies, the MCC is a conference. A confer­ence gives teams the ability to showcase its talents, gain indi­vidual recognition, and a source of competition from year to year. And it appears to be the only choice for Notre Dame. 
"I think it's good to be in this conference, and at the moment the MCC seems to be our only alternative," said McGraw. "The North Star is instable and has no men's program. It's also not as strong in terms of what a conference can do." 
The Future of the MCC 
All MCC members have stated that they are committed to growth and development within the conference. But the fact remains that teams like Butler. Marquette, Evansville and St. Louis do not have the financial resources for their Olympic programs that Notre Dame has. This introduces the question of whether the schools will back up their statements with action. 
"I think we have every expec-

tations that things are on track with the MCC," said Rosenthal. "When you make decisions and find out premises are inaccu­rate, you have to calculate the logic that went into the deci­sion. We are delighted with our association with the MCC. but we will always opt to ensure the most competitive schedules we can do." 
And if the MCC does not con­vince the NCAA to give it auto­matic bids to sports like base­ball. women's basketball and women's volleyball? 
"It's so hard to be dealing in speculation," answered Rosen­thal. "If we give sufficient commitment and hard work, inevitably we'll get the auto­matic bid. Notre Dame has pledged itself to do just that. 
"We observe and trust that the other member schools of the MCC are just as committed as we are, and that gives us ab­solute confidence than we will succeed in building it into one of the great conferences in the country." 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Assistant Sports Editor 
Case Study: Women's basketball 
Last year, women's head coach Muffet McGraw led her team to a perfect 18-0 confer­ence record as the team won the MCC Championship. Overall, the team finished 23-6, but did not receive a bid to the NCAA tournament. 
Notre Dame's being passed over could be attributed to a 2­3 record versus teams in the Top 20, including a loss to Old Dominion at the buzzer. But while Notre Dame was playing 16 regular-season games in the conference, other teams were impressing the NCAA tourna­ment selection committee, which looks heavily on strength of schedule. 
"Teamwise, it's great to be conference champions," said McGraw, in her fourth year as head coach. "Going undefeated was not done before, so that was good. 
"The disadvantage is that there is no automatic bid (to the NCAA tournament). But we really feel like we'll get one. 
The way you get to the NCAA tournaments is by beating good teams, and what we have to do is win the conference and do well outside the conference." 
Case Study: Men's Soccer 
The men's soccer example, however. demonstrates a posi­tive advantage to the MCC. Not only is it Notre Dame's only sport in which the conference winner gets an automatic bid to the NCAA, but members Evansville and St. Louis are perennial Top 20 teams that add competition and credibility to the conference. 
Since Notre Dame joined the MCC in 1988. the team is 15-3­1, with all losses coming against St. Louis. 
Last season, Notre Dame lost in the semifinals of the MCC tournament to a powerful St. Louis team that later lost to Evansville in the final. In 1988, the Irish won the tournament, moving on to the NCAA tour­nament for the first time in the program's 12-year history. 
Case Study: Women's VoUey­baU 
The disadvantage of strength of schedule also is found in the case of women's volleyball. The team, which went to the NCAA tournament in 1988 as an inde­pendent. was required to join the MCC this year. 
Most cf the women's volley­ball teams in the MCC this year are teams that have switched from the North Star Conference in the mid-1980's. 
Now the MCC has been dubbed "North Star revisited" by some. Dayton, Marquette, Evansville, Loyola. St. Louis, Butler and Notre Dame all participated in the North Star conference in 1986 and 1987, at which time the Irish won the division with 33-7 and 30-9 records, but never received a bid. 
Yet in 1988, after the Irish withdrew from the North Star and went 18-11 as an indepen­dent against a much stronger schedule, they received an at­large bid to the NCAA tourna­ment. After a year of rebuilding in 1989, the team now is part of the MCC, in which only 82 percent of the games played last year were against Division I teams. 
"For the Notre Dame volley­ball team," said Head Coach Art Lambert, "there are no ad­vantages." 
One disadvantage for the 
team is that one-third of the Irish schedule will be spent against MCC teams, which in turn cuts into scheduling against meatier teams. 
"Beating (MCC teams) isn't like beating Texas, Nebraska or UCLA." said senior right-side hitter Amy White. "It's like beating nobody, which doesn't amount to much to the NCAA (committee). It cuts into the season, and it makes half of (the season) really hard and the other half not as tough as it could be." 
Case Study: BasebaU 
For the Notre Dame baseball team, being a member of the MCC became problematic when the NCAA withdrew its auto­matic bid to the MCC confer­ence winner in 1989. 
"The loss of the bid was a slap in the face," said baseball coach Pat Murphy, whose 1989 squad came out of the loser's bracket of the MCC tournament to win and move to the NCAA playoffs. "I'd like to figure out why they did that. When you look at what (1988 conference champion) Evansville and we have done nationally there's no reason we shouldn't have one." 
Both Evansville in 1988 and Notre Dame in 1989 won at least one game before being eliminated from the NCAA tournament. Now. the consid­erable number of games the teams play in the MCC forces them to scramble for feasible dates with baseball power­houses so they may prove themselves to the NCAA tour­nament selection committee. 
Notre Dame, however, has no cake-walk through the MCC, especially since the conference winner is determined by a post­season, double-elimination tournament. In three years. Notre Dame has won the tour­nament once (1989), finishing second in 1990 and third in 1988. 
"I think it's a very competitive conference," said senior short­stop Mike Coss. "We're starting to build good rivalries. I guess 
you could say there  are  no  
powerhouses, but we  usually  
have good games."  

Said Murphy: "The baseball side of things has improved ev­ery year. It's a good conference. It's just probably not recognized across the country and that's something we need to improve on if we're going to stay in this conference."

detriment that selection committees weigh heavily when deciding which schools they should invite to the national championships. 
Baseball, women's basketball and volleyball are all pertinent examples. Last year, the NCAA eliminated the automatic bid to the MCC baseball champions. In women's basketball, the 1989­90 Irish were 18-0 in league play, including a 12-0 stretch in the crucial closing weeks of the season. They did not receive a bid. 
Women's volleyball joins the MCC this year and will again compete against teams it faced as part of the North Star con­ference, tallying records of 33-7 and 30-9 in 1986 and 1987. The Irish squad did not earn a bid to the tournament until 1988, however, when as 
By comparison, Syracuse made four network TV appear­ances, excluding the Big East and NCAA Tournaments. So the Orangemen got less exposure than the Irish. They also got less money. 
It is safe to assume that Syracuse receives roughly the same stipend for a network ap­pearance as Notre Dame (approximately $125,000) after the network money is split up evenly among the nine members of the Big East. Simple arithmetic will tell you that the Irish would have lost 
independents they went 18-11. It's obvious national officials do not respect many of the MCC's programs. Being champions of that conference is no big deal to them. 
In some sports, the MCC does receive bids to the NIT tourna­ment. That means the women's basketball team could best hope to finish a stellar 49th in the country while volleyball might actually reach that cov­eted 33rd ranking. 
Meanwhile, Irish teams are wasting a majority of their sea­sons playing these feeble MCC teams, when they could be scheduling Top 20 non-confer­ence match-ups and raising their level of play. 
Scheduling around its MCC opponents, Notre Dame must hope that the national powers have the same free weekends as the Irish. For the volleyball team, this means doubling up MCC matches so that weekends can be left for games with the

$375,000 if they had to divide up their money among the rest of the Big East like Syracuse does. 
So the Irish, as long as they can put together a competitive basketball schedule, don't want to play in a hoops conference either. What's left, then? What conference would even want Notre Dame as a member if its basketball and football teams had to remain independent? 
3. The MCC is the only al­ternative that makes any sense. 
You can argue that the MCC 
Minnesotas and Ohio States. 
And when the Irish do play MCC teams, are they really finding the best possible compe­tition? Women's basketball de­feated MCC opponents by an average of more than 22 points last season. Baseball was 25-3 in MCC games. Athletes may find it difficult to make ade­quate mental preparations when they know they will prob­ably trounce their opponents. And teams can ill afford off­nights to teams they usually dominate. 
In addition, conference games are de-emphasized because the teams realize that a win against an MCC foe will not add to their national standing. The Irish must rely on what they do out­side the league to improve their appearance in the national picture. 
While athletic directors at MCC schools claim they are working to improve their pro­grams, a look at schedule strength illustrates that the hurts the baseball team now that the NCAA took away the conference's automatic bid. Even if there was a bid, though, the Irish wouldn't have won it last year (Evansville won the MCC Tournament). 
You can argue that the MCC hurts the women's basketball team, which was 23-6 last sea­son but was snubbed by the NCAA tournament selection committee because of an 18-0 record against a weak MCC schedule. But don't forget that 
Irish are head and shoulders above the rest of the league. In volleyball, Notre Dame will play 100 percent of its matches against Division I schools. Last year, the rest of the conference competed against Division I teams 82 percent of the time, barely maintaining the 80 per­cent minimum required by the NCAA for a school to retain Di­vision I status. 
In women's basketball, for example, the other MCC schools' non-conference oppo­nents include teams like Akron and Cincinnati while Notre Dame is playing Tennessee, Old Dominion and UCLA. 
Finally, the MCC hinders the Irish from drawing the best possible players. It's hard to believe that a high school star in any sport could get excited about regularly facing teams like Xavier and Loyola. Plus, Notre Dame coaches have to be honest in admitting to recruits that the prospects of NCAA Muffet McGraw's troops were only 5-6 outside the conference last year. 
The bottom line, though, is dollars and cents, and Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal, with his banking background, is wise enough to see this. Notre Dame would just lose too much money if it pulled out of the MCC. In order to keep the Irish athletics in the black, Notre Dame must remain in the MCC. 
There just isn't any other logical solution. 
tournament play are presently slim at best. 
Athletic directors at the MCC schools have pledged to im­prove their school's programs, but Notre Dame officials have to ask themselves if this is truly possible. None of the schools have Notre Dame's reputation and may never be able to keep up with the Irish in terms of athletic facilities, their ability to schedule Top-20 opponents and, most importantly, their power to attract the caliber of coaches and players needed to become nationally prominent. 
If Notre Dame really wants to elevate all of its sports pro­grams to the same level as football and men's basketball, the University should allow the teams to schedule their seasons as independents or in the most feasible and competitive con­ference. The Irish should have no problem compiling an excit­ing schedule while eventually raising all the programs to the highest level in college sports.

Phares shoots 161 to finish eighth at ISU tournament 
By JENNIFER MARTEN 
Sports writer 
The Notre Dame women's golf team spent an encouraging weekend at Illinois State Uni­versity. 
The team's total of 679 al­lowed them to finish ninth overall out of a field of 17 teams at the ISU Invitational. 
In addition. Notre Dame's top finisher, sophomore Kathy Phares. finished with a two day total of 161 and placed eighth overall. Seniors Roberta Bryer and Pandora Fecko finished with two day scores of 170 and 184, respectively. 
Fecko was optimistic about the team's performance. 
"We had a good showing the first day and we were about twenty strokes off the lead," 

Kathy Phares 
said Fecko. "On Sunday, we didn't adjust to the conditions and we didn't play up to expec­tations." 
Coach George Thomas echoed her thoughts. 
"We played extremely well," said Hanlon, "especially the first day." 
Hanlon was especially pleased with Phares' play. He

noted that the team had to use three freshmen because some of the upperclassmen could not attend the meet. 
"We got a lot of help on the first day from Klein and Mur­ray," said Hanlon, referring to freshmen Chrissy Klein and Ali­cia Murray, who posted totals of 174 and 175, respectively. Another frosh, Denise Paulin. contributed a 185. 
Hanlon was happy with his team's play, especially in the first round. Heavy winds on the second day of competition low­ered all scores. 
"We were only three shots behind three of the real strong teams after the first day," said Hanlon. "Overall, we were five strokes lower than last year. 
"We continue to lower score each tournament we play. I am really am encouraged."

Notre Dame and the MCC: A good match? 
Irish dominate most sports, but few alternatives exist 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO 
Assistant Sports Editor 
When nine representatives of private universities met in Indi­anapolis to discuss circulating rumors about their athletic programs, the time had come for decisions to be made. 
Held April 26, the Council of Presidents had a goal: to dispel rumors that other avenues were being explored and to af­firm commitment of all parties to the Midwestern Collegiate Conference. The official out­come of the meeting, which in­cluded Notre Dame, was a re­newed resolve for all nine members to stay within and de­velop the MCC. 
These representatives of Marquette, Detroit, Loyola, Butler, Evansville, Saint Louis, Dayton, Xavier and Notre Dame united to support their common Olympic sports: men's baseball, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's indoor track, men's and women's soccer, women's basketball, women's volleyball, men's and women's swimming, men's golf and women's soft­ball. 
Some have questioned Notre Dame's decision to stay within the conference. Notre Dame professes to treat its Olympic sports as a good mother would treat her children: it shows no favorites, preferences or biases. 
In keepinrr with this benefi­cent parent motif, the Notre Dame athletic philosophy in­cludes all sports in one happy family that adds to the univer­sity's "mission."

"I don't think in our minds that there's any differentiation

between any of our sports,"

said Athletic Director Richard Rosenthal. "All our sports have equal charges; the philosophy that governs them is the same. We obviously have different budgets because there are dif­ferent dollars available, but they all march by the same drummer. 
"Our mission is to be part of the bigger mission of this uni­versity, and the only justifica­tion of our athletic program is to be part of that mission." 
That mission includes teach­ing students that they can de­velop their skills, that hard work pays off and that team­work and cooperation can overcome adversity. In the case of sports, according to Rosen­thal, Notre Dame owes its ath­letes the most challenging tests for skill development and over­coming adversity. 
The pertinent consideration here is how to challenge them. Notre Dame is a member of the MCC, a nine-team group of pri­vate universities with similar goals and priorities. Listening to Rosenthal makes the choice obvious. 
"We think the MCC has the prospects of growing into one of the premier conferences in the country," he said. "We have a great affinity with the schools in the MCC... They are collectively a group of schools who are intent on doing what we are doing, and that's becoming as competitive as we can possibly be." 
But an examination of MCC teams' commitments to Olympic sport excellence makes the question of conference mem­bership less obvious: 
Last 
year Notre Dame Olympic sports captured nine MCC championships of the 12 in which they were included. 

Since 
joining the MCC in Oc­tober 1987, Notre Dame sports programs have won 21 out of 27 conference championships in which they have competed. 

Of 
the six sports in which conference winners can receive automatic bids to the NCAA

ence (wmmng 9 of . 12 conference ASSIStant Sports championships last Editor 
year). it's easy to________ overlook the many other factors that make Notre Dame completely out of place in such a weak league. The university has stated time and again their dedication to building the level of the school's "Olympic" sports, presumably to the rank of national prominence that its football and men's basketball teams, both independents, en­joy. Making all of Notre Dame's sports as 
competitive as possible is said to in­fluence how these programs are run.

tournament, the MCC receives two, one of which is in men's basketball, a sport in which Notre Dame is an independent. 
These facts appear that Notre Dame might have to look elsewhere to give its athletes the best possible competition. 
The MCC: On the Upswing? 
The Council of Presidents in April was not the result of one or two isolated assertions. Ru­mors circulated that Notre Dame and other programs were looking elsewhere for con­ference affiliation, which in­spired the meeting and set the wheels of progress moving within the MCC. 
Included in these improve­ments are designating women's basketball, baseball, women's volleyball and men's soccer as "target priority sports," setting scholarship minimums and rec­ommending minimums on coaching staffs and recruiting funds, all to be required by 1991. 
"We're doing everything we can to upgrade our sports," said MCC President Jeff Fogel­

schedules and ultimately winning the NCAA championships. Unfortunately, the MCC is not the vehicle the Irish should be using in their drive to be number one. 
The titles support this statement 
·most visibly. Men's cross country, golf and indoor track, women's basketball and softball, and both men's and women's swimming and tennis all won the MCC last year. Softball lost to league opponents only three times in the regular season. The men's tennis team captured the conference champi­onship at every position. And the women!g basketball team was undefeated in MCC play. 
But Notre Dame should try to be more than just conference champs. Other reasons show why the MCC competes below Notre Dame's desired level. 
Post-season play is an excellent example. Only two MCC teams (men's soccer and men's basketball) receive automatic bids to the NCAA tournaments. For the other sports, the MCC is a

ND should stay in MCC 
Those who follow-------­Notre Dame's Olympic sports pro­grams are quick to badmouth the Midwestern Collegiate Con­ference. Some even venture to suggest that the Irish should Ken Tysiac pull out of the MCC. . 
The MCC bashers Associate Sports are quick to cite Editor statistics about the-------­
lack of competition for the Irish in the conference. But they can't come up with a better solution. 
Consider the alternatives. 
1. Notre Dame's Olympic sports programs could become independent. 
Yeah, right. The Athletic Department would have to hire a dozen more people just to put together schedules for the Olympic sports teams. The prospect of negotiating for a 50-game schedule for Irish softball, for example, without a large number of conference games to start with, would give any Notre Dame sports administrator nightmares. 
The only other solution, then, is: 
2. Notre Dame could join another 
conference. 
This second solution seems great at first glance. Until you look for a spe­cific conference for the Irish to join. 
Forget about the Big 10, the SEC, the ACC, the Big Eight and the SWC. Notre Dame, after all, could not join a conference which required participa­tior). .for the Irish football team. Foot­ball is the great fountain of revenue which provides funds for the rest of the Athletic Department and pays for a quite a few scholarships besides. 
If Notre Dame joined a conference, all those big TV bucks the Irish earned would have to be shared with between eight and ten other schools. Put more simply, the Irish can't join a football conference because if they did, they would lose megabucks. 
That narrows the choices quite a bit. But there are still more choices. It has been rumored in the past that Notre Dame might join the Big East. After all, the Big East schools which have Division I football teams play their football schedules as independents. So if the Irish joined the Big East, Holtz & Co. could
