University tuition hits $44,477 
Increase marks the sixth in 6 years 
By KATE ANTONACCI News Editor 
The price of a Notre Dame education just got a little steeper -$2,340 steeper to be exact. 
The University announced Thursday that tuition for undergraduates will increase 
5.4 percent for the 2007-08 school year -up nearly $2,500 from the current aca­demic year's bill. 
Decided at the winter Board of Trustees meetings, the total cost for a year of undergradu­ate education will be $44,477, including $35,187 for tuition and $9,290 for average room­and-board rates. 
Tuition increases for the other schools connected with Notre Dame are 5.4 percent as well, bringing costs for the Graduate School to $35,580 and both the Law School and Master's of Business Administration Program to $35,490. 
This year's increase signals a small percentage decrease in comparison to year's past. While the 2006-07 academic year saw a 5.8 percent increase, the 2005-06 aca­demic year saw a 7 percent rise, slightly higher than 2004-05's 6.9 percent and 2003-04's 6.5 percent increases. The 2001-02 and 2002-03 rises, however, were

this weekend. There are prob­ably no more reservations avail­able in any restaurant in town, and the waits will be ridiculously long. It's pretty sweet to think about, though. Mom and Dad are coming here to see what their baby girl/boy is doing all the way out here in (very) snowy South 
Bend. 

My own parents came in from central New Jersey around 11 last night complete with bulky lug­gage, various items l left at home when I came back from Christmas Break and hopefully some quar­ters so I can do more laundry. Between the rushing to clean and vacuum my double-turned-single room, trying to get all my home­work done for Thursday and Friday before they got here, and actually going to my classes, I'm about ready to collapse. Too bad the festivities start tonight. There is a pretty easy solution to that. I'll gulp down an energy drink (or two, or three), throw on my best stiletto heels (hope I don't fall), and prepare myself to spend the entire weekend with my mom and dad. 
I'm not going to lie I'm excited, despite the always-imminent snowfall. Being from Jersey, my parents don't really get to come visit me often. It really is a pretty rare thing to have them out here for a whole weekend, especially one that isn't during football sea­son. I don't even really know what activities there are planned, other than the dinner that I still don't know what I'm supposed to wear to. That's okay though, we'll improvise. The point is getting to spend time together, whatever we're doing. It should really be a fun weekend. 
So, Mom and Dad, strap on some snow boots, grab some gloves and a warm hat and bundle up. It's cold out there (not that it isn't probably cold inside too). This weekend is going to be interesting for the three of us. Get ready for horrible dining hall food, some messy dorm rooms, strange but somewhat intriguing activities and a tiny glimpse into what being out here is like for us. Mom, Dad, wel­come to Saint Mary's!

SYDNEY, Australia -A man who caught a 4-foot shark with his bare hands off an Australian beach said on Friday he only tried the feat because he was drunk on vodka. 
Phillip Kerkhof was fishing off a jetty at Louth Bay, a town on South Australia state's Eyre Peninsula 870 miles west of Sydney, when he spotted the bronze whaler shark swimming in the shal­lows, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.

Turtle eaten by retriever survives 
BRANDON, Fla. -A palm-sized p11t turtle and the golden retriever that gobbled it up survived the misadven­ture thanks to the quick actions of a 12-year-old girl, a veterinarian said. 
The saga of Pepper the red-eared slider turtle and Bella the golden retriever started last week. Shelby Terihay, 12, moved her pet pond turtles indoors to pro­tect them from a cold snap -a plan that worked well until Bella found some of the turtles in a bathtub, The Tampa Tribune reported. 

A quick headcount con­firmed Bella had swallowed one of the turtles. Shelby insisted on a rescue mission and, on the advice of a vet, her parents made Bella vomit. Out came Pepper, still alive despite a shattered shell and an estimated 10 minutes inside Bella's belly.

JPW brings business for local hotels, inns 
By EVA BINDA News Writer 
Despite the feet of snow cover­ing the South Bend community, parents still have their eyes on the Golden Dome as they arrive for Junior Parents Weekend (JPW) today -and those travel­ing from a distance made sure they reserved a warm hotel room far in advance. 
Although the amount of people arriving for the event is not quite as large as the masses that arrive for a typical football week­end or for graduation, there was still a need to make arrange­ments in advance. 
"We started receiving calls from parents the Monday after last year's [Junior Parents Weekend]," said Pat Walsh, vice president of business services at Anthony Travel. "A lot of parents, especially those who have had older children attend Notre Dame know the drill and call early." 
Walsh said his office deals with a "couple hundred" parents each year for JPW arrangements, many of whom are "repeat cus­tomers." 
"They know calling [Anthony Travel] is a one-stop phone call -hotel reservations, rental cars and airline tickets," he said. 
Walsh said he expects parents looking to reserve rooms for next year's JPW to begin Monday. 
This year's most popular hotel destinations include the Inn at Saint Mary's, the Varsity Club located near Grape Road and downtown the Marriott Hotel. 

Although rates can triple dur­ing football weekends, Walsh said he isn't aware of any raises in rates this year for JPW. 
The Morris Inn, located on Notre Dame's campus, is a popu­lar option that does not allot rooms through Anthony Travel, but rather gives a certain num­ber of rooms to the JPW Committee who then holds a lot­tery drawing in late November. 
Though the number of people arriving this weekend is relative­ly low, Bill Beirne, the director of the Morris Inn, said he "feels probably the same pressure." 
Beirne said that the Morris Inn does not raise rates for JPW despite the high demand for hotel rooms. Rooms not allocated to the junior class for JPW are available for the University to use for guests and speakers visiting the University for other events. 
While hotels around campus fill up with junior parents, many non-junior students plan to leave campus for the weekend. 
"I don't think there's going to be much happening on campus this weekend," said freshman Casey O'Halloran, who plans to spend the weekend in Chicago with friends from her dorm.

Parents arrive at College 
By KATIE KOHLER Assistant News Editor 
During the spring semester, students often use their only substantial vacation -spring break -for a week of sitting on the beach with friends instead of going home to see their families. Fortunately for sophomores at Saint Mary's, they'll have the opportunity to do both this weekend. 
The winter months will bring familiar faces as parents

events -which rate will be are coordinated available for by the sopho­Mary Beth Harris Saint Mary's more class and sophomore sophomores 
Student Activities -will revolve around the theme "We are so Classic" to empha­size the deep-rotted traditions at Saint Mary's, said student coordinator Sarah Dalton. Over 200 people are expected to attend the weekend events. 
"We have all been working hard since the beginning of this year for the big week­end," she said. 
The planning of the event went smoothly, Dalton said, and she promises a "lot of special touches throughout the weekend" dedicated to past Saint Mary's women. 
Events start Friday with an academic open house in the Student Center at 5 p.m. 
"This is a great chance for parents to get to meet our teachers now that we are more familiar with them than we were at freshman orienta­tion," Dalton said. 
Tours of the South Bend Chocolate Factory, the Snite Museum and the College Football Hall of Fame are all offered for sophomores and their families beginning 
and their par­
ents. 
The signature event is the dinner and dance at the Century Center beginning at 7 
p.m. Saturday. 
"Sophomore Parents Weekend is such a tradition at Saint Mary's and it's going to be a memorable time to spend with each other and our parents," Dalton said. "We tried to focus a lot of effort into the dinner." 
Prior to dinner, there will be raffles, appetizers and music, Dalton said. The Sophomore Board is raffling off approximately 25 gift bas­kets and all of the proceeds will go toward future class events. 
"Our love for this school has really developed over the past year and a half and it will be really exciting for our parents to experience that with us," she said. 
A sophomore Mass will pre­cede dinner at 4 p.m. in the Church of Our Lady of Loretto. 
Students and their families are also encouraged to attend the final home basketball game on Saturday at 3 p.m. in Angela Athletic Facility. 
Many sophomores are look­ing forward to seeing their parents, especially those who live far away. Mary Beth Harris, who lives in Iowa, is using this weekend as an opportunity to spend some quality time with her parents. 
"I am really excited to see my parents because last semester I was an ocean away in Rome," she said. "It will be great to show my par­ents the campus." 
Megan Ryan is anxiously anticipating the weekend for another reason. 
"I am the first one in my family to ever attend Saint Mary's, so this is the first par­ent-event my parents have the chance to come to," she said. "I think it's going to be a great time."

the academic, spiritual, social and residential life of the University," Carroll said. 
Many students are looking forward to the opportunity to spend time with their parents on campus for a weekend and show them around Notre Dame. 
"JPW is an opportunity for Notre Dame parents to come to the school and really get a feel for the accomplishments of their child. It's also an opportunity for them to feel proud of their children," said junior Ryan Daniels. 
Daniels said he and his par­ents planned "on touring the campus and going to the Bookstore," in addition to attending several of the planned activities such as the cocktail party Friday night and the Sunday morning brunch. 
Though there isn't a named theme this year as there was in years past, Fremeau sug­gested that "Love Thee Notre Dame" is a theme surround­ing the events of the weekend. 
Fremeau said there will be plenty of Notre Dame imagery in decorations and events intended to evoke the Spirit of Notre Dame. JPW 2006 held the theme of "Traditional Notre Dame," while 2005 organizers used a "Passport Abroad" theme. 
Parents and juniors have a busy few days ahead of them, as events kick off tonight with an Opening Gala at 9 in the Joyce Center. According to the JPW Web site, the event ­which requires tickets ­includes music, dancing, hors

Saturday morning parents and students are invited to participate in workshops host­ed by each of the colleges ­the College Arts & Letters, College of Science, College of Engineering and the Mendoza College of Business -with presentations by various speakers from within the respective college. 
Following these workshops, residence hall luncheons will be held. Visitors then have the option of attending a JPW mass at the Joyce Center with University President Father John Jenkins presiding. Saturday night is centered around the President's Dinner, which also requires tickets. 
Fremeau said planning for the event began in April 2006 when the core executives, such as the Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson, were cho­sen. 
Planning has been "steady since the middle of the fall semester through this week­end," said Fremeau, who also plays a role in advising the JPW Committee.

AI-Qaida leader wounded in Iraq 
BAGHDAD -The leader of al-Qaida in Iraq was wounded and an aide was killed in a clash Thursday with Iraqi forces north of Baghdad, the Interior Ministry spokesman said. 
The clash occurred near Balad, a major U.S. base about 50 miles north of the capital, Brig. Gen. Abdul-Karim Khalaf said. 
Khalaf said al-Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Ayyub al-Masri was wounded and his aide, identified as Abu Abdullah al-Majemaai, was killed. 
Khalaf declined to say how Iraqi forces knew al-Masri had been injured, and there was no report on the incident from U.S. authorities. 
Al-Masri took over the leadership of al-Qaida in Iraq after its charismatic leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed in a U.S. airstrike last June in Diyala province northeast of Baghdad. 
Putin elevates defense minister 
MOSCOW -President Vladimir Putin pro­moted his hawkish defense minister to a top government post on Thursday, a move that puts rutin's two heirs apparent on equal footing before next year's election to replace the popular leader. 
Both Sergei Ivanov and the more liberal Dmitry Medvedev have received lavish cov­erage in the Russian media, which is strong­ly influenced by the Kremlin, and are seen as the chief rivals for anointment by Putin as his favored successor in the March 2008 election. 
Each man now holds the title of first vice­premier, formalizing a rivalry that is never mentioned officially but is played out daily on state-run television. News broadcasts prominently feature them struggling to look presidential in government meetings, speeches and closely choreographed visits to farms and factories.

Advocates push tobacco regulation 
WASHINGTON -Seven years after being rebuffed by the Supreme Court, anti-smoking advocates rejoiced Thursday as lawmakers renewed a push for federal regulation of tobacco, a step they say is needed to deter children from lighting up and to get smokers to quit. 
"Congress has the opportunity to take a monumental step and grant the Food and Drug Administration the meaningful and long-overdue authority to regulate tobacco, which kills 440,000 people and costs our nation $96.7 billion in health care bills every year," said John Seffrin, chief executive offi­cer of the American Cancer Society. 
A bipartisan group of lawmakers reintro­duced legislation Thursday that would give the FDA the same authority over cigarettes and other tobacco products that it already has over countless other consumer products.

ATLANTA -Government scientists strug­gled Thursday to pinpoint the source of the first U.S. salmonella outbreak linked to peanut butter, the kid favorite packed into millions of lunchboxes every day. 
Nearly 300 people in 39 states have fallen ill since August, and federal health investiga­tors said they strongly suspect Peter Pan peanut butter and certain batches of Wal­Mart's Great Value house brand-both man­ufactured by ConAgra Foods Inc.

The fire did not appear suspicious, but investi­gators were on the scene in the city about 25 miles southeast of South Bend, Sink said. 
Authorities did not immediately identify the victims. Sink declined to immediately provide additional information.

IN BRIEF 
Chrysler restructures, cuts jobs 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -For 13,000 Chrysler workers, Feb. 14 will now be known as the Valentine's Day massacre. 
On Wednesday, Chrysler announced its long-awaited restructuring, which included a 16 percent reduction in its work force, shift reductions, a plant closing and a sur­prise hint that the plan could lead to a DaimlerChrysler divorce. 
The Chrysler plan calls for closing the company's Newark, Del., assembly plant, and reducing shifts at plants in Warren, Mich., and St. Louis. A parts distribution center near Cleveland also will be closed, and reductions could occur at other plants that make components for those facilities. 
Chrysler blamed the wrenching restruc­turing on poor sales after a shift in con­sumer taste from SUVs and trucks to more fuel-efficient vehicles. Workers blamed management. 
Aside from the job cuts, Chrysler's German parent, DaimlerChrysler AG, said it is looking at all options to revive its for­tunes, including partners for the troubled Chrysler. Its chairman wouldn't rule out a possible sale of the U.S. operation. 

Companies accommodate investors 
NEW YORK -Shareholder activists are used to making noise, but not necessarily to being heard by corporate America. This year companies may begin to listen. 
A surprising trend at the start of the proxy season is that companies like Applebee's, Aflac and Home Depot are doing what they can to avoid public fights with investor groups targeting them on issues such as executive pay and board elections. 
That doesn't mean all corporate chief­tains are going to buckle to investors' demands, but many certainly seem more willing to engage in dialogue and quash potential controversy as quickly they can. 
Historically, this hasn't been the time of year where shareholders and corporate executives come together. The springtime proxy season -when both sides advance their agendas ahead of companies' annual meetings -often is when their differences are most clear. 



Domestic companies restructure 
Auto manufacturers announce job cuts to concentrate on competitive models 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -Shrink to grow. That's the message from Detroit, where all three of the traditional domestic auto companies have announced thou­sands of job cuts in the hopes of turning red ink to black. 
But they all know they can't cut their way to prof­itability. In the end, they have to build more cars and trucks that people want to buy. These days, that means smaller and more fuel efficient vehi­cles. 
"There's no doubt that the easier part of the two prongs of restructuring is cost-cutting," said Efraim Levy, senior industry ana­lyst with Standard & Poor's. "The hard part is getting the vehicles that consumers want." 
With Chrysler's announcement Wednesday that it will cut 13,000 jobs and shut down one plant and some assembly lines, all the traditional domes­tic manufacturers have downsized considerably in the last two years. Ford Motor Co. will cut up to 38,000 blue-collar jobs and another 14,000 salaried positions.

African nations 


agree with France 
Associated Press 
CANNES, France -Looking to end the crisis in Darfur, France won agreement on Thursday from three involved African nations that they would not sup­port armed rebel movements on each other's territories. 
Sudan, Chad and Central African Republic made the com­mitment in a declaration signed Thursday night, on the sidelines of an African summit that France hosted in the Riviera city of Cannes. 
There were still no signs that Sudan was any closer to agree­ing to a key international demand: that it accept the deployment of U.N. peacekeep­ers in Darfur, its western region where fighting has killed more than 200,000 people since 2003. 
However, French President Jacques Chirac's spokesman hailed the African nations' pledge and their call for contin­ued United Nations and African Union involvement as an indica­tion that they don't want the cri­sis to worsen. 
"We hope that all those who took part in this meeting did so because they don't want the sta­tus quo to establish itself," said the spokesman, Jerome Bonnafont. 
France and other powers fear the Darfur violence is spilling over and could engulf the entire region. Tensions have mounted as Sudan, Chad and Central African Republic accused one another of supporting each other's rebels. 
The mere fact that presidents Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, Idriss Deby of Chad and Francois Bozize of Central African Republic met was in itself seen as noteworthy. 
"There is clear suspicion between the three countries and a clear willingness from African countries, in particular the African Union, and the interna­tiona! community to dispel it," said Bonnafont. 
Whether their pledge would have real significance was open to question. Deby and al-Bashir signed a similar agreement a year ago to normalize diplomatic relations and deny refuge to each other's rebel groups. 
Chad has accused Sudan of backing rebels in the country. Central African Republic also has alleged that Sudan support­ed a rebellion there. Sudan denied both charges and has accused Chad of backing rebels in Darfur. 
More than 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million have fled their homes since 2003, when Darfur tribes took up arms against the Sudanese government, accusing it of long neglect and discrimination. The Arab-dominated government responded with a military offen­sive in which the janjaweed mili­tia have committed widespread atrocities. The U.S. government has described the violence as genocide. 
A 7,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force has been trying to quell the ongoing vio­lence, but the force is under­funded and ill-equipped. Al­Bashir rejected a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for 22,000 U.N. peacekeepers to replace the AU force in Darfur. But he also has sent mixed sig­nals about a joint U.N.-AU force. 
The United Nation and African Union envoys to Darfur said on Thursday that they were "encouraged" about prospects for peace in the country's trou­bled region after two days of talks with factions in Sudan. 
The two -U.N.'s special envoy tasked with re-energizing the Darfur peace process, Jan Eliasson, and AU's Salim Ahmed Salim -have been in Sudan this week for meetings with Khartoum officials, rebel leaders and stops in Darfur.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

'Relationship' controversy 
Relationship based on tradition, history 

In response to the Feb. 13 column "Saint Mary's -we noed to talk", Jonathan Klingler does make a valid point. But I have come to wonder what his intentions were. Yes, I would agree that the relationship between No\re Dame and Saint Mary's can be consid­ered "friends with benefits." With that being said, this relationship has lasted many years and has operated in a seem­ingly peaceful co-existence. I believe that this relationship has even become part of the tradition of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. Since both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's emphasize the impor­tance of tradition, my one question is, why attack this historical aspect of our schools? 
Laura Mullen freshman Le Mans Hall Feb. 13 
Don't discuss independence, prove it 
In response to the responses to Klingler's thought-provoking article, I would like to applaud the women of Saint Mary's for taking a stand for the integrity of a prestigious women's insti­tution. I believe that Saint Mary's is an upstanding college that produces amaz­ing women. I can vouch for this stato­ment because I have a Saint Mary's roommate of my own. who is absolutely one of my best friends and a fabulous woman. 
In the spirit of these letters, however, I am moved to support Klingler's article, in that it addresses some serious ques­tions that plague most Notre Dame womnn. Thern have been many "unfounded" accusations against Saint Mary's students, daiming that they are able to take advantage of Notrn Dame resources that they may not havn been able to otherwise, while we as Notre Dame students do not reap the same bnnelits, i.e.: Notre Dame classns, foot­ball ticket access, men, dining halls, conecrts, clubs, ete. So, in order to resolve this conflict of opinions, I pro­pose an amiable solution. 
I agree with Anno Mahoney that Saint Mary's should focus on its own unique strengths and build a strong foundation on them. In that spirit, I believe that to be something that most Saint Mary's students would want to uphold. Why not attempt a change'! 
I challenge the fall dass of 2007 to try something new. Show your pride. Take advantage of all that Saint Mary's has to ollcr: refuse Notre Dame football tickets, limit access to your study abroad pro­grams and ()'Laughlin Auditorium, and show the strength of your own sports and clubs. 
Don't get me wrong, I respect Saint Mary's. But if you really advocate for "separate and proud," prove us Domers wrong. I know you can. 
Cristina Munoz semor off campus Feb. 15 

Football tickets worth extra fee 
In reading yesterday's responses, I was most irritated at the football ticket debate. I I ere is a team that, regardless of national ranking or record, sells out every game. For every person sitting in that stadium there are countless who would gladly pay double or more for the opportunity. We are extremely lucky to be given the privilege to buy season tick­ets, a luxury that many other universi­tios don't oll'er students. Of course, Notre Dame students do pay a (constant­ly inereasing) price for the privilege of a Notre Dame edueation. Perhaps this is why I find it a bit aggravating that there are Saint Mary's students with much better seats than my own. 
What really gets me is that Saint Mary's students aet as if they are not being done a generous favor, and if a $60 additional fee is the price they pay for the chance to see Notre Dame foot­ball, they should be willing to pay it and not try and use this policy against Notre Dame. It really bothers me that they would bring up this issue, of all things, in an argument over their contributions to this "partnership." If they don't want to pay the fee, I am sure there are thou­sands of alumni who can fill these seats. 
On a personal note, as a resident of Keenan Hall, I am grateful that Saint Mary's allows us use of O'Laughlin Auditorium for one week each year. We arc charged a fee (which I believe is in excess of $60) and the College maintains the right to censor material it deems unreasonable. Fair enough-we don't complain. But all hard feelings aside, we cannot allow us to lose sight of the fact that they are "separate but proud". I guess they are just less "separate" dur­ing football season.

A winning strategy for both Hillary, Rudy 
Americans have become as outra­geously fickle with political specifics as they are forgetful of generalities. This primary presidential election cycle is rampant with negativity. More often voters cling onto insignificant impressions of can­didates while ignor­ing the overall breadth of a candi­date's character and background. Pollsters call this the beer choice ­which candidate would you prefer to be with to drink a beer. 
Ironically, the primary system is as fickle. Retired General Wesley Clark lost the Democratic nomination in 2004, simply by entering the campaign late and missing the Iowa caucuses. Conflicted Iowa Democrats sought a nominee with strong military creden­tials to combat terrorists, but also wanted someone who opposed the inva­sion of Iraq. Before Iowa, Senator John Kerry's campaign floundered on virtual life support while former Governor Howard Dean had yet to implode. As the nation's first contest, Iowa voted for the only military choice on the ballot which gave great momentum to Kerry's lifeless campaign. The rest is history. 
As the U.S. House of Representatives concludes its debate today with a vote to disagree with President Bush's new military "surge" tactic, Senator Hillary

Capitol Comments 
Clinton finds herself on the defensive against hard-core antiwar Democrats. Similarly, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani fends off Republican con­servatives who oppose his co-called "liberal" stands regarding abortion and gay rights. Coincidentally, both Clinton and Giuliani have an identical yet per­fectly legitimate answer -they are New Yorkers. 
New Hampshire Democrats recently peppered Clinton in search of an apolo­gy. They wanted her to admit that her vote in favor of authorizing the presi­dent to go to war with Iraq was a mis­take. Clinton replies that she "regrets" her vote and "takes responsibility for her vote," but that the president "mis­led and mismanaged" the war effort. She further proclaims that if she was president at the time, she "would not have gone to war." 
Clinton's firsthand experience in the White House gives her a view of presi­dential reality from the other side of the looking glass. In her mind, a presi­dent needs and deserves the authority to light aggression. She is correct to assert that as president she would not have marched to war because she would have no neo-conservatives mas­saging intelligence to invade Iraq. However, to the dismay of staunchly antiwar Democrats who fixate on noth­ing less than an apology, she will not admit that her vote was a mistake. 
Clinton need not apologize. Other senators whose votes reek of cowardly personal political expediency fell prey to the patriotic orgy whipped up by the White House. Clinton, on the other hand, had no choice but to rally New York with her vote. None could criticize her when she represented the land which cradled the World Trade Center's human remains and smoldering wreck­age. 

Giuliani faces a similar Hepublican onslaught of criticism and cynicism, but over his domestic stands on gay rights and a woman's right to choose an abor­tion. His critics come primarily from the Jerry Falwell self-proclaimed social conservative wing of the party who high jacked the party a quarter century ago by defining "conservatism" with a Baptist-twisted political bent. Yet Giuliani is not the only Republican in their cross hairs. They also distrust Senator John McCain's motives and harbor negative feelings that stem from his 2000 campaign. 
Interestingly, the godfather of modern conservatism, the late Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater whose seat ironically McCain currently holds, never ascribed to Falwell's type of conservatism. Rather, Goldwater's sensible beliefs lie in limited government-so limited that it recognizes everyone's personal equality and freedom, including gay rights and a woman's right to an abor­tion. 
Giuliani, however, can use Clinton's exact response. Giuliani is a New Yorker who presided over an inclusive and tolerant city. He became America's mayor when his city and our nation survived a tragedy. Republican voters should not ignore Giuliani's evenhand-
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 



Kaleidoscope McDaniels proves its poor taste 
I am happy to be living in a country where one's freedom of speech is closely guarded. Yet there comes a point when a publication must decide which speech must be permitted and which speech simply does not advance any good but rather is harmful. In the case of one comic strip featured in The Observer, I feel this time has come. 
I am referring to Kaleidoscope McDaniels, the comic strip by Liam Moran which debuted this spring semes­ter. The strip often toes the line of acceptability, and it is in fact this very pushing of the envelope that provokes shock and therefore laughter. Readers cannot help but recall Jockular, the comic by Erik Powers and Alex White which often pushed this same envelope. Many readers took offense at this strip, and its very offensiveness became its comic drive. 
Yet readers deserve something more. The comic strip is a kind of incidental, bonus feature of the paper, but it does serve an important role. It can poke fun at the goings on of student life on cam­pus in a way few other genres can. Some may remember Fourth and Inches, a strip from a few years ago, which often struck a chord with students because of its careful observation of life on campus. The truly talented artist's work is capa­ble of being humorous in such a way that draws upon the reader's experience and "tells it like it is." 
I and many others feel that Kaleidoscope McDaniels simply does not do this. Its use of concepts and refer­ences bordering on the obscene or -at the very least -illegal or immoral seeks to draw a laugh through its shock value. For example, on Jan. 25, I saw a girl in the South Dining Hall lobby point to the comic and say, "I can't believe they'd print that." Picking up a newspaper, I noticed Kaleidoscope McDaniels which was depicting a character obviously rep­resenting Fr. Jenkins smoking a joint of marijuana in Uganda, referring to the recent McAlarney incident. Is this humor, or simply the theatre of the ridiculous? What is the difference between shock and libel? 
The recent comic about the Eating Disorder Conference is another example, which Eleanor Bradley responds to in her Feb. 9 letter, "Conference appreciat­ed, jokes aren't." I assume the author did not intend to attack people who have eating disorders, or even to make fun of them, but when playing with fire, one often gets burned. A publication must ask itself if this kind of humor is really helpful to the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community, or if it rather does more harm than good. It is really a matter of what kind of publication the Observer aspires to be and what standards it wishes to set. Tabloids, of course, pub­lish things far worse than this comic strip. Is that where our student newspa­per is headed?

ed administration, nor the immense breadth of his skills by foolishly follow­ing Falwell's narrow rhetorical red her­rings. 
No candidate, nor anyone in this nation who advocates equality, will force Falwell to marry same sex cou­ples. Luckily, today's generation of col­lege students will within 20 years ulti­mately squash the narrow-minded tac­tics of the Falwells in this country. Students today accept domestic rights for gays as well as interracial dating and marriage. Moreover, they flock to Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign because they hold little of the prejudices of older generations. 
New Yorkers Clinton and Giuliani need never apologize for representing a progressive constituency who cherish freedom, tolerance and acceptance. Democrats should focus on Clinton's experience and ability to sidestep on­the-job training. Republicans should weigh their candidates' experiences without patronizing the fringes of their party. It is true that if you make it in New York, you can make it anywhere. Clinton and Giuliani both have the right stuff.

Klingler, let's talk 
As committed members of the Saint Mary's College community, we feel it is necessary to respond to Jonathan Klingler's article. ("Saint Mary's-we need to talk," Feb. 13) Aside from the article's factual inaccuracies, we are confused by the author's spiteful attitude toward Saint Mary's autonomy. While we recognize the resources Notre Dame offers to the South Bend community, the endeavors and accomplish­ments of Saint Mary's should not be slighted nor depreciated. 
The Princeton Review recently ranked Saint Mary's a top Midwestern college. U.S. News and World Report has ranked Saint Mary's the No. 1 Comprehensive College in the Midwest for 12 of the past 13 years. There are currently three Saint Mary's alumnae serving in the United States House of Representatives. Last year, Saint Mary's offered nearly $27 million in scholarships to ninety percent of the stu­dent body. 
The average class size of 15 fosters intellectual collaboration between students and professors, including SISTAR grants for shared summer research. Our nursing, education and social work programs are nationally recognized and accredited. Saint Mary's offers unique academic courses such as medicinal chemistry, humanistic studies and women's studies. 
In addition to our enriching academic environment, Saint Mary's is dedicated to social awareness and community involvement. Student leaders organize and host the annual Dance Marathon fundraiser for Riley Children's Hospital. The Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership offers funding for study abroad programs, self-designed student projects and Bridging Grants with the South Bend community. The Office of Civic and Social Engagement facilitates volunteer work with S.O.S., The Women's Care Center, YWCA and St. Margaret's House, giving Saint Mary's women a heightened social consciousness of the needs and talents of all women. 
A healthy relationship includes both individual expression and mutual respect. To avoid perpetuating the cycle of fruitless articles that fail to wholly represent either institution, we would like to pro­pose a forum where we could dialogue in greater depth. We have only one question: your place or ours?

Scene Editor 

Editor's Note: This is the fifth in a five­part series on the 2007 Oscar nominees for Best Picture. 
"The Queen" is much like the British Royal Family itself-elegant and old-fash­ioned, but with an air of importance and respectability that makes it impossible to ignore. It has been an overwhelming criti­cal success (it rests among the best reviewed films of the year), and is a legiti­mate contender for the Best Picture Oscar. 
While Princess Diana never appears as a character (except through archive footage), the pall of her shadow hangs heavily over "The Queen." The film explores the days after the death of Princess Di, deeply exam­ining how the royal family dealt with the tragedy. Though the royal family believes that private mourning is appropriate, the public demands an outward display of emotion. Protocol and tradition clash with the need for progressive modernity, and it is up to Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) to com­promise with Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) in order to maintain the family's respectability and relevance. 
The Queen 
Director: Stephen Frears Writer: Peter Morgan Starring: Helen Mirren, James Cromwell and Michael Sheen 

"The Queen" is not, primarily, a film about politics. Instead, it is a simple (though not simplistic) story about the tear of change. In abandoning the political for the personal, director Stephen Frears pro­vides great insight into a woman whose entire life revolves around tradition, and the anguished struggle she faces in poten­tially breaking that tradition. It is this focus that elevates "The Queen" and allows it to transcend its origins -many films like this feel like award fodder, but "The Queen" has more on its mind, and its breadth in expressing itself is remarkable. 
Helen Mirren has essentially already locked up the Best Actress Oscar race with this film, as she gives a pitch-perfect per­formance as Elizabeth II. Balancing her loyalty to tradition with an understanding for the need to change and modernize, Mirren manages to humanize Elizabeth and give dimension to the Queen's seem­ingly impenetrable exterior. Michael Sheen is quite good as Tony Blair, and James "That'll Do, Pig" Cromwell is memorable as the curmudgeonly Prince Philip. 
Frears' directing is excellent, and he intercuts real-life footage with the film quite well. There is very little flash to his directorial style, but his restraint and con­trol are remarkable. There are several occasions in which he seems to instinctively know that the writing and acting will carry a scene, letting the material guide itself . 
"The Queen" is a bit heavy on symbol­ism, but its understated style fits the mate­rial quite well and prevents it from feeling too overwrought. It is to the filmmakers' credit that they never let the film drag, which may account for its relative brevity. At 97 minutes, "The Queen" is a lean and

effective picture that doesn't overstay its welcome. It would be easy for a film like this to become ostentatiously bloated, but Frears is smart enough not to let it get bogged down -it remains focused throughout, and the director is smart enough to allow Mirren to dominate almost every scene. Thus, thankfully, the film feels much less pretentious than might be expected. The characters are fully fleshed out, and none of them feel like caricatures. Screenwriter Peter Morgan has an ear for dialogue, making even the most formal of language sound natural and comprehensi­ble, and the acting is top-notch throughout. 
A film like "The Queen" is difficult to make, if only because the event is still so recent. Yet Frears' film hits all the right notes -it's a human story about a person struggling to accept a changing world, and the filmmakers and Mirren clearly under­stand this. That "The Queen" is a good film is itself a feat, but that it is a great film is nothing less than an extraordinary accom­plishment.

Princess Diana's passing was less than a decade ago, yet already "The Queen" is in theaters. All of the princi­ple characters in the film (Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Tony Blair) are all still alive, which gives the film a much different historical feel than it might otherwise maintain. Because the event is so recent, it's almost impossible to give "The Queen" a fully historical perspective, especially since we equate "history" with events that occurred long ago. 
Though numerous films are made 
about real-life events, they often feel much different when made so soon after the event has taken place -this is perhaps why they often strike a chord with audiences. A film like "United 93," made only five years after 9/11, resonates much differently to a contemporary audience than it would had it been made years from now. 
Similarly, a movie like "All the President's Men," which follows the Watergate investigation, was made in 1976, only a few short years after the scandal itself -for American audi­ences in 1976, the event itself was still very fresh. This contextualizes the film in a much different way than it would with a more detached audience.

CD REVIEW 
Mitchell's latest appeals to fans of modern folk 

By MARTY SCHROEDER 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Some music rocks, some displays bril­liant composition and some is perfect for spending a rainy day sitting and looking out a window. Ana"is Mitchell's latest album, "The Brightness," is definitely of the third variety. 
With her girlish, innocent voice, com­plemented by piano and folk melodies, her songs calm listeners and remind them that electric guitars are not always the best option. Appropriately released on Ani DiFranco's Righteous Babe Records, Mitchell presents an authentici­ty and quiet passion absent in so many modern records. 
The two opening tracks on "The Brightness" tweak the listening process by slowly delving into emotional catastro­phe and then ending abruptly. Any form of catharsis is denied, a tactic that keeps ears perked and leaves the listener won­dering what comes next when the final emotional release is expected. The sound may create an auditory experience simi­lar to listening to any random folk recording out today. However, Mitchell does delve into cliche at times, as she calls herself a "beautiful fly on the wall" in the album's third track, "Namesake." Contradictions like this abound through­out the album, making it a prime exam­ple of first-class song writing that is both familiar and alien at the same time. 
Songs such as "Shenandoah" lilt through their melodies as guitars are gently plucked and notes are sung. Bringing to mind an association with nature that melds perfectly with folk melody chains on the album. This may sound like some form of hippie-minded technique from New England (Mitchell is a Vermont native), but the sincerity inherent in Mitchell's vocal style quickly discounts any political haranguing except to the most cynical. 
One track in particular, however, chal­lenges modern political situations. "Song of the Magi" makes references to the birth of Jesus in what is now the West Bank. Pulling imagery from both the Bible and the modern reality of the West Bank today, she weaves a story about 
shepherds pray­ing and passing by checkpoints. Mitchell does crawl meander­ingly on top of her soapbox with a political mes­sage decrying vio­lence in the region, but she alludes to a gen­eral belief in non­violence that mostly refrains from taking sides.

A twisting narrative that retells the same story from several different perspec­tives, 1951's "Rashomon" ("'n the Woods") was notable for its innovative storytelling style. The first of legendary director Akira Kurosawa's major works, "Rashomon" was a huge international success and, essentially, put the filmmaker on the glob­al map. 
The film follows three men in 12th cen­tury Japan -a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura), a bandit (Toshiro Mifune) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki) -who take refuge during a rainstorm. As the men begin talking, they retell of a bizarre trial that involves a murdered

is equally plausible, utes. Kurosawa co-
though the truth seems to lie somewhere in between. The woodcutter, however, has secrets of his own, which are slowly revealed over the course of the film. 
An intriguing rumination on human nature, "Rashomon" is a deeply philo­sophical piece, matched only by Kurosawa's "Ikiru" in terms of elegant hum~nism. Kurosawa has a lot to say regarding the complexities of the human condition, especially in the wake of World War II, but he cloaks his ideas in the film's plotting, which is fascinating and engag­ing throughout the work. 
"Rashomon" is anchored by the per­formance of Kurosawa muse Toshiro Mifune, who remains the ultimate inter­preter of the director's narratives. Kurosawa's energetic directorial style meshes synergistically with Mifune's strong performance, lending to some truly powerful scenes. 
The director's style and sense of com­position are both on full display here, and the story is among the most intriguing and humanistic in Kurosawa's oeuvre. At a mere 83 minutes, "Rashomon" moves at a remarkably quick and energetic pace,

that featured in "Rashomon." As a direc­tor, Kurosawa's influence is felt by almost every major figure in modern filmmaking, to the extent that Sergio Leone's "For a Fistful of Dollars" is based on "Yojimbo" and George Lucas' "Star Wars" is loosely based on "The Hidden Fortress." His par­ticular brand of swashbuckling swordplay and elegant philosophy, however, remain nearly unparalleled. 
Kurosawa would go on to do bigger and arguably better things -among them the masterpieces "Ikiru" (1952), "The Seven Samurai" (1954), "Yojimbo" (1961) and "Ran" (1985)-but "RashOmon" was the director's critical breakthrough. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1951, bringing a new global awareness to Japanese cinema. Along with Yasujiro Ozu, Kurosawa remains one -­of the great Japanese directors. His skills are in rare form throughout "RashOmon," which is inarguably his first masterpiece. 
"Rashomon" will be screened on Saturday at 3pm in the Browning Cinema of the DPAC as part of the PAC Classic 100.

courtesyof Singer-songwriter Anais Mitchell further develops her folk stylings with her latest release, "The Brightness." The album exemplifies folk's characteristic simplicity. 
Rather, Mitchell calls for a return to the concept of nonviolence that many say Jesus delivered. 
"Hobo's Song" is the most energetic track on the album -if any of the tracks can be labeled "energetic"-that adds a bluegrass mix to the pervasive folk aes­thetic. The lyrics are well wrought, but Mitchell's vocal stylizations don't mix as well with the song's bluegrass elements. Her voice is far more conducive to the album's overall neo-folk feel. Rather than trying to sound punchy, Mitchell would do well to keep to her folk-minded war­bling and leave the bluegrass to those with the graver voices. 
Mitchell thrives with a style of acoustic strumming and singing that trickles across the notes like a stream over peb­bles. Those of more rock-minded musical persuasions, however, might want to look elsewhere. For listeners seeking to expand their horizons and explore music that may never see a radio dial (because it's too good), "The Brightness" is an excellent choice. The first half of the album is for the melancholy in us all, and the latter half piques intellectual interest as the songwriting delves into more com­plex and complicated themes and images. "The Brightness" is a well-made album from this rising folk star.

Associated Press 
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. ­Barry Bonds finally signed his $15.8 million, one-year deal Thursday, ending more than two months of wrangling between the slugger and the San Francisco Giants over con­tract language. 
With both sides satisfied, Bonds is scheduled to report Monday to spring training. IIe is likely to par­ticipate in the Giants' first full-squad workout Tuesday. 
"I expect he will be ready to go," general manager Brian Sabean said. 
The 42-year-old Bonds is 22 homers shy of breaking Hank Aaron's career record of 755. 

Bonds' deal was approved by the commis­sioner's office. His agent, Jeff Borris, and the Giants reached a preliminary agreement on Dec. 7. 
The team announced the deal Jan. 29 and Bonds did an interview via conference call. But he never signed the contract, and problems developed. 
At issue were specifics about what would happen if Bonds were to be indicted or face further legal trou­ble, along with details about a personal-appear­ance provision that was rejected by the commis­sioner's office. 
IN BRIEF 

Yankees's J!eneral partner
arrested for DUI 

lARGO, Fla. -George Steinbrenner's son-in-law and designated successor to run the New York Yankees was arrested early Thursday for suspicion of driving under the influence. 
Yankees general partner Steve Swindal was arrested by the St. Petersburg Police at 4:26 a.m., according to a copy of the charge report posted on the Pinellas County Sherriff's Office's Web site. He was booked for a misdemeanor and released at 9:53 a.m. on $250 bond. 
"Mr. Swindal apologizes profusely for this distraction during the Yankees' spring training and no further comment will be made until this is resolved," said Steinbrenner's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein. 
The 52-year-old Swindal, who lives in Tampa, is married to Steinbrenner's daughter, Jennifer, and has taken an increasingly active role in running the Yankees. In June 2005, Steinbrenner said Swindal would eventually succeed him. 
The Giants sent revised documents to Borris, which Bonds signed Thursday. Only the personal-appear­ance provision was deleted from the deal, two baseball officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. 
A federal grand jury is investigating whether Bonds perjured himself when he testified in 2003 in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative steroid distri­bution case that he hadn't knowingly taken any per­formance-enhancing drugs. 
Bonds long has denied knowingly using steroids. Bonds will fill the final spot on the team's 40-man 
roster, which had stood at 39 after catcher Mike Matheny went on the vol­untary retirement list with a concussion. 
The seven-time NL MVP has been working out all offseason at UCLA and appears as healthy as ever, according to the Giants, Bonds' trainer and his agent. He had arthroscopic surgery on his troublesome left elbow after the 2006 season. 
After missing all but 14 games in 2005 following three operations on his right knee, Bonds batted .270 with 26 homers and 77 RBis and drew 115 walks in 130 games last year. 

Gasqnt:t Baghdatis advance 
to quarmnalS at Open 13 
MAHSEILLE, France -Sixth-seeded Richard Gasquet and No. 7 Marcos Baghdatis won second-round matches in straight sets Thursday at the Open 13 and reached the quarterfinals of the indoor tournament. 
Gasquet of France -the highest remaining seeded player -had four breaks of serve in his 7-6 (2), 6-2 win over countryman Marc Gicquel, while Baghdatis of Cyprus beat Cyril Saulnier of France 6-4, 6-3. 
The 20-year-old Gasquet, a semifi­nalist at Sydney and a quarterfinalist at Adelaide in Australia last month, is wary of his quarterfmal opponent ­Robin Soder ling of Sweden. 
"Soderling plays super well indoors," Gasquet said. "His game is made for quick surfaces. If the match was being played on clay, I would be more serene. He is a player who is very hard to maneuver ... I will need to vary the game as much as possible to win." 
Holyfield's out of retirement, 
will fight Vmny Madd 
CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas -Evander Holyfield will look to stay perfect since coming out of retire­ment when he fights Vinny Maddalone on March 17. 
The 44-year-old former heavy­weight champion has won both fights since returning from a two­year layoff, improving to 40-8-2. His first comeback fight was a sec­ond-round knockout of Jeremy Bates in Dallas in August. In November, Holyfield won a deci­sion over Frez Oquindo in San Antonio. 
The 33-year-old Maddalone (27­3, 19 KOs) is from New York City. 
The fight will mark Holyfield's third professional fight in Corpus Christi. In his previous fight in Corpus Christi, he knocked out Jesse Shelby in 1986, and cap­tured his first world title two fights later.

Big East tournament culminates season for ND squad 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
Notre Dame has focused the entire season for this weekend's Big East tournament in Akron, Ohio, and now that it has fmally arrived, Irish coach Joe Piane has one goal in mind. 
"We're going there to try to win in both the women's side and men's side," he said. 
The Irish will send 31 men and 22 women to compete in the con­ference championship. 
The middle distance runners, led by senior all-American Thomas Chamney-the No. 1 seed in the 800-meter and 1,000­meter races -anchor Notre Dame's male contingent. On Feb. 3 at the Meyo Invitational, Chanmey cemented his place atop the Big

East by running the 800 in 1:47.82, the second fastest time in school history. 
Notre Dame's sprinters and dis­tance runners are also strong. Four Irish runners rank in the top eight in the conference in the 400 -seniors Ryan Postel and Jordan Powell, junior Austin Wechter and freshman Balazs Molnar. Postel ranks first in the Big East in the 400 and also qualified for the 200. 
Leading the distance team is junior Jake Watson, who won the mile at the Meyo Invitational in 
4:00.71 to provisionally qualify him for the NCAA Tournament in addition to the Big East. Sophomore Patrick Smyth will run the 5,000 after running the Big East's third-best time at 13:58.10. 
"We have a pretty broad based track team on [the men's and women's] sides," Piane said. "We're going to have good people everywhere. And it's the same on the men's side. We're not a one­dimensional team." 
Piane also feels that he is send­ing a very well-balanced team on the women's side of the Big East championship. 
Heading the Irish effort will be the sprint team, including senior Maryann Erigha, who double qualified in the 60 and 200 meters. 
The Irish distance squad is paced by senior Amy Kohlmeier and freshman Lindsey Ferguson, both of whom could run in the mile or 3,000. Kohlmeier will also run in the 5,000-meter event. 

In the field events, the Irish will be best represented in the jumps. Senior Cassie Gullickson will lead the jumpers as the No. 2 high jumper and No. 4 triple jumper. Notre Dame is also sending sopho­more pole vaulters Mary Saxer and Kate Mattoon, who have matching season-highs of 12-feet­5.5-inches. Sophomore Anna Weber will man the throws, com­peting in both the shot put and weight throw. 
Even though Piane is confident in his team's ability, he recognizes the challenges facing his team in the difficult Big East. On the men's side, Piane expects the most trou­ble out of Louisville. The Cardinals' strength is one area where the Irish are not as deep -jumps. 
"Louisville has some of the best long jumpers and triple jumpers in the country and they are going to score major points in those two events," he said. "Their squad probably isn't as deep as ours in some areas, but in others -i.e. the long, triple -they're as good as anybody in the country." 
On the women's side, Piane sees Connecticut as the biggest threat to his team's success. 
"They've got some pretty good sprinters and they are developing the distance program, but they have a lot of very good field event kids," he said of the Huskies. "It'll be interesting to say the least."

No. 5 Notre Dame travels to Virginia 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 
No. 5 Notre Dame begins its quest for a national champi­onship Sunday as the Irish face No. 12 James Madison on the road. 
The Irish enter the season with high expectations after a 15-4 campaign in 2006, high­lighted by a trip to the NCAA semifinals. The team wrapped up its preseason with practice and scrimmaging this week, highlighted by an exhibition match with No. 6 Dartmouth. 
Notre Dame fell 14-13 to the Big Green in the exhibition last Sunday afternoon, after a morning of controlled offensive and defensive scrimmages between the two teams. Despite the close loss, Irish coach Tracy Coyne was impressed by her team's per­formance. 
"For the first game of the year, it was a very high-caliber and fast-paced scrimmage ­what you would expect from two fmal four teams," Coyne said. 
The team will try to use the experience gained by that exhibition match to defeat the Dukes in Harrisonburg, Va. 
"I feel like the Dartmouth exhibition definitely has helped us focus in practice on things to attack and cover, as well as exposed areas that needed improvement," Coyne said. 
The team will be led by a tal­ented group of returning starters, including three mem­bers of the preseason All-Big East team. Junior midfield/attack Caitlin McKinney and sophomore midfield/attack Jillian Byers were unanimous selections to the team, joined by senior defender Meaghan Fitzpatrick. 
In addition to their No. 5 preseason ranking, the Irish were also picked to finish sec­ond in the conference. The inaugural Big East champi­onship will be held this May, and stands near the top of the long list of goals for the Irish this season. 
Notre Dame has a tough task, however, with No. 12 James Madison, who the Irish beat 12-11 at home last sea­son. 
'They're a very competitive team that plays a very physi­cal, hard-nosed game," Coyne said. 
Senior Meghan Murphy said the team felt very prepared and confident for Sunday's game. 
"Our goal is to improve with every competitive opportunity, whether it be a scrimmage, game, or practice," Murphy said. "We want to come out strong from the opening whis­tle very strong and show what 2007 Notre Dame lacrosse is capable of."

Irish to compete in Tiger Invitational 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
Notre Dame begins its quest to defend last year's Big East title this weekend at the Tiger Invitational. The Irish return 13 letter winners to their 16-player roster from the 2006 squad that finished 42-21 overall and 17-5 in conference play. 
This year's team was selected to finish third in the Big East in a coaches poll taken Jan. 10. 
Senior captain Stephanie Brown will lead the way oiTensively for Notre Dame this year after being named a second team All­American in her junior season. Brown hit .343 with 42 stolen bases in the leadoff spot last year. 
The Irish pitching staff will need to fill the gap left by sec­ond team all-conference pitcher Heather Booth (27-12, 1.71 ERA) in order to live up to its billing. 
Sophomore Brittany Bargar will take over as the team's ace after winning 15 games in her rookie season. Bargar will be joined by senior Kenya

Fuemmeler and sophomore Christine Farrell, who missed all of last season due to injury. 
Bargar will likely take the mound this afternoon for the first game of the season against host Auburn. The Tigers (1-5) got off to a slow start by drop­ping four one-run games at the Hawaii Paradise Classic last weekend. 
Fuemmeler will make her sea­son debut in the second game of the day against the UAB Blazers. This will be the second meeting in two teams' histories, the Irish won the first battle 9-1 in Chatanooga, Tenn six years ago. 
Notre Dame will play another double dip Saturday afternoon against the Golden Eagles of Tennessee Tech and the Golden Hurricanes of Tulsa. Both teams will be playing in their second tournaments of the year. 
Tulsa freshman Ashlee Lubiewski is already making headlines with a 6-for-12 start and a home run against Pacific. 
The busy weekend wraps up Sunday afternoon as the Irish look to continue their domina­tion over Virginia Tech. Notre Dame has taken 10 of 11 games against the one-time Big East foes. The 1-Iokies should be able to compete this year, as they started out the season by win­ning the _Georgia State First Pitch Classic last weekend. Junior pitcher Angela Tincher started her year 2-0, striking out 35 batters in 14 innings on the hill.

Irish look to lllake-a statelllent in tourney 

ND takes on Pepperdine in the first round of the National Team Indoor Championships 

VANESSA GEMPIS/The Observer Ryan Kackley celebrates a doubles win en route to a 5-2 upset over Florida State Feb. 2 at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 
It may have been five years since the Irish have seen the courts at the National Team Indoor Championships, but Notre Dame is ready. 
"You are playing every match as a dual match and we have already seen a lot of the teams that are here," Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said. "We have seen these guys, we now what is out there." 
The trip back to the tourna­ment will be a familiar event for Bayliss. The Irish last played in the tournament in 2002, and were ranked No. 10 nationally when they upset No. 7 Pepperdine 4-3. 
No. 9 Notre Dame will take on No. 10 Pepperdine again in the first round of the indoor matchup. 
The team will compete along­side many opponents it has already seen in regular season play. Notre Dame practiced alongside Pepperdine and Duke on Thursday in the 18-court Midtown Tennis Club in Chicago. 
"We had a look at Pepperdine and I think we had a good work­out, we have prepared for this pretty well," Bayliss said. "They looked aggressive, they hit the ball clearly and decisively." 
Pepperdine, the 2006 NCAA Champion, enter the tourna­ment after a 5-2 win over the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. Pepperdine dropped the doubles point but responded with wins in five out of six singles match­es. 
Bayliss is confident that the team will perform well come match time, and the Irish will continue to focus on improving their doubles game. Notre Dame dropped the doubles point in their last match to Wisconsin but rallied to take the 6-1 win. No. 33 Andre Begemann defeat­ed Elliot Wronski 6-2, 6-0 at No. 1 singles. 

Irish senior Stephen Bass will take on Begemann at No. 1 sin­gles today. Begemann, a strong server and vollyer will present Bass with a challenge, but Bayliss feels that the senior is ready. 
Bayliss knows that the Irish will be facing many top oppo­nents and players, but he feels them team is prepared to make a strong showing. 
"We want to show some poise under pressure," Bayliss said. "We are at a point where we can make a dent in this field." 
If the Irish knock off Pepperdine they will take on the winner of the Georgia and University of Pennsylvania. No. 1 Georgia is the defending ITA National Team Indoor Championships and was the top seed in last season's NCAA Tournament, eliminating the 18th-seeded Irish in the Sweet 16. 
Even with their sights on the possibility of playing Georgia, the Irish are focused on their matches today. 
"Sunday's opponent is a way off and is not worth speculating about right now," Bayliss said. 
No matter what the outcome of the weekend, Bayliss said that the team is grateful to get an opportunity to play against top opponents -every team is guaranteed three matches in the tournament. 
Notre Dame will look to fur­ther their six-game winning streak starting with Pepperdine. 
"I think we are ready to go," Bayliss said. "We are prepared and we have done everything we need to do and we are anx­ious to be in play."

Irish start with high hopes 
ND looks to improve on promising fall at John Hayt Invitational 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 

After a fall season in which the Irish recorded the second­best team scoring average in school history, coach Jim Kubinski hopes the team will continue its strong performance in the John Hayt Collegiate Invitational in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Sunday. 
In the offseason, the team practiced daily in its brand-new indoor practice complex, the $2.1 million Robert and Marilyn Rolfs Family All-Season Varsity Golf Facility. 
The added winter practice has led to marked improvement. 
"''d imagine each guy will have dropped a few strokes from his average," said Kubinski. "[The new facility] has been such a help to us." 
But despite the productive winter practice sessions, Kubinski said that his team must continue to improve with each tournament. Last weekend, the Irish Alumni Matches gave the squad an opportunity to get on the course with former Notre Dame golfers at the Saddlebrook Resort in suburban Tampa. 
"It was a very good weekend for us," Kubinski said. 
The team again heads to the Sunshine State this weekend. The John Hayt, which is hosted by the University of North Florida, will be the first intercol­legiate tournament of the spring season for the Irish. The field for the event includes 10 of the nation's top 50 teams, according to Golfweek. 
"This weekend will be a great starting point for us," said Kubinski. "Hopefully we can get the ball rolling against the strong field." 
The Irish are currently ranked 51st by Golfweek, which would be good enough for a berth in the NCAA Tournament. However, Kubinski said he wants his team to improve on a 
weekly basis. before the conference tourna­

East) has had success in its home gym this season, despite losing eight of their last nine games. Irish coach Muffet McGraw believes that the game will be tough, but that her team will be ready. 
"This game is really important to us because they beat Louisville at home, and took Marquette to a two-or three­point game," she said. "It's going to be important for us to be focused on them." 
McGraw also stressed the diffi­culty of playing Providence, who is 8-5 at home, on its own floor. 
"They've played a lot of teams close-at Providence," she said. "They have a big home-court advantage, so we're gonna be ready for them." 
Providence guard Chelsea Marandola averages 16.2 points per game on 43.8 percent three­point shooting. Marandola will be one of the toughest tests Notre Dame will face this sea­son. 
"They have really good guards," McGraw said. "They're very good at penetrating to the basket, and they have good shooters." 
The Irish are in good position to challenge Providence's guard play behind the imposing play of guard Charel Allen, who has scored 25 points in her last two games and averaged 22.4 points in her last five. Allen leads the team with 17 points per game on the season and is sixth in the Big East in scoring. 
"Offensively, she's been play­ing really well," McGraw said of Allen. "She's been looking for her shot a little bit, and going with the flow of the offense. We're really starting to peak right now. We're playing well together, everyone's doing what they can do." 
Right there with Allen is fresh­men guard Ashley Barlow, who at 11 points per game is second on the team in scoring. Receiving a lot of playing time but not starting until recently, Barlow brings a good deal of skills to Notre Dame's offense. 
"What I'm looking for from her is to continue to rebound," McGraw said. "She's a really good offensive rebounder, that's probably her strength. She does a lot of little things well." 
Role-player guard Breona Gray, who hit two of Notre Dame's three 3-pointers against Villanova, rounds out the Irish backcourt. 
"I think Breona Gray has made some big shots for us," McGraw said. "We have a lot of weapons." 
Finishing the games may be a problem for Notre Dame. Against Villanova, the Wildcats brought the game to within three points in the second half. Providence is capable of similar production -against St. John's Feb. 10, the Friars erased an 18-halftime deficit and won 93­

77. Forward Catherine Bove, who is second on the team in scoring, averaging 14.1 points per game, scored 14 of her 17 points in the second half. 
The team has been in those situations before, however, and McGraw cited execution as the difference-maker. 
"It's a game of runs. We're gonna make runs, and then the other team's gonna make a run, and we have to kind of with­stand that," McGraw said. "We have to be solid defensively and we have to work on our rebounding. Offensively, we have to continue to execute. We've had a lot of games where we've had leads, and a lot of games that have been close, and we've had a lot of poise and a lot of confidence." 
Although intensely focused on the game at hand, McGraw acknowledged the importance of the outcome in the future. 
"It's a great time for us," she said. "And it's a great time for our resume for the NCAA Tournament, because resumes are so important."

to accomplish," senior goal­tender Dave Brown said. 
Brown stopped 38-of-41 shots against Alaska (9-15­6, 7-12-5 in CCHA) earlier in the season, earning two vic­tories at the Joyce Center. The Nanooks came into that weekend ranked No. 14 in the country, but have won only three of their last 16 games since coming to South Bend. They currently sit in ninth place in the CCHA standing and will be battling for a home playoff series this weekend. 
"It's hard to say what has happened since [we played], but they still scare me from a coach's perspective," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said. 
Alaska coach Tavis McMillan has a great deal of respect for Jackson and the rest of the Irish. 
"Top offense, top defense, top goalie, top coach in the country -what else do you want to bring at us?" McMillan said. "To compete against [the best] is what makes sports not only excit­ing, but valuable to society. I want to play Notre Dames every weekend. Otherwise you would be playing intra­mural volleyball." 
In the 2006 playoffs, Alaska was forced to make the trip to Notre Dame for its first round matchup. The Nanooks swept the Irish in a series that developed bad blood between the two teams. 
"Those guys play a really chippy style of hockey, not necessarily a clean style of hockey -which is sort of like me -so it will definite­ly be a good series up there," junior defenseman Brock Sheahan said. 
Sheahan, who lives in Lethbridge, Alberta, is the team's only native of Western Canada -an area the Nanooks recruit heavily. He has played with all but one of the members of the Alaska club, Brandon Knelsen, since he was in peewees. 
"Most of them are good guys, but they can be a little different on the ice," he said. "They won't be my buddies on the ice, that's for sure." 
The ice surface at the Carlson Center, Alaska's home rink, is slightly larger than what Notre Dame has played on all year long. They play on an Olympic­sized sheet, which is 200 feet by 100 feet, as com­pared to the standard NHL­sized rinks used in most col­lege hockey arenas (200 by 85). 
Notre Dame will step up the intensity on its forecheck throughout the game in order to take advantage of the different size ice, as well as the passive style of play that Alaska has adopted this season. 
"We are going to be a little more aggressive, because they can kind of lull you to sleep," Sheahan said. "We just want to make sure we play our game." 
The games will be held at 
7:05 AKT both nights, but Friday night's game will be broadcast on tape delay on WHME 46 in South Bend at 
9:30 a.m. Saturday.

"There has been no bigger
' 
' 
r win this year than this one after the two losses," Irish ! coach Mike Brey said after the game. Providence dominated the first 10 minutes, leading 24-12 with 10:52 left in the half. Sensing the game -and a possible NCAA Tournament bid -slipping away, the Irish quickened the tempo and fought back. Keyed by eight points from forward Zach Hillesland and nine from Falls, Notre Dame trailed 42-38 at the half. Hillesland, who tied a career high with 14 points, positioned himself near the 
"It was nice to be able to catch and turn and have a little space," Hillesland said of the offensive scheme. 
The sophomore finished the game with eight rebounds, three assists and two steals to go with his points. 
"Once I got going, the juices started flowing," he said. 
Notre Dame opened the sec­ond half with a 7-2 run and took the lead, 53-52, on a 3­pointer by Carter with 18 min­utes left. 
Carter did not start the game due to a hip flexor injury and scored just two points in the first half, but he lit up the Friars' defense for 13 points on 4-of-5 shooting after the break. 
"I was a little cold in the first half, but I felt better in the second half," he said. 
Brey said the decision not to start Carter helped the senior see the flow of the game bet­ter before he entered the con­test with just under 16 min­utes left in the first half. 
"I think sometimes when you let a guy step back and come off the bench, he gets to see the game a little bit and that helps," Brey said. 
The lead changed hands six times in the first 1 0 minutes after the half, but the Irish pulled away with a 15-4 run to go up 70-59 with 3:30 remain­ing. 
During the run, Providence went more than five minutes without a point. 
"I think the key was the five­minute stretch of getting stops," Brey said. "We made sure they were one and done. We dido 't allow them any offensive rebounds." 
Falls said Brey stressed

locker room. 
"We were so 
halftime -were 
we going to stop 
them?" 

The Friars made a late run, closing to within 78-75 with seven seconds left. but a Carter free throw and a Hillesland steal sealed the win. 
Falls hit two free throws and Friars guard Brian McKenzie hit a three to provide the final margin. 
Notre Dame has to turn around and play Cincinnati on the road Sunday. The Bearcats are struggling at 10-15 overall and just 1-10 in the Big East. The Irish, however, have fal­tered on the road this year ­they are just 3-6 away from the Joyce Center this season. Sunday's game tips off at 2 p.m.

Something had to chango in the second half of Notre Dame's game against Providence if thn Irish want­ed to avoid slipping down the 
Big East  
standings. Something  Chris Hine  
had to  
change if the Irish wanted  Sports Writer  
to ineroase  

thoir ehance of roeeiving their first NCAA Tournament bid in live years. 
That something was post defense. 
Throughout Big East play this year, Notre Dame has had trouble keeping oppo­nents' big men from scoring inside and grabbing rebounds. In their losses against Villanova, St. John's, DePaul and South Florida, the Irish lost the battle on the boards and gave up high per­centage shots to opposing post players. 
The story was tho sam1~ for the first half Thursday night. 
Providence big men Ilerbnrt Hill and Jonathan Kale com­bined for 25 points and the Friars entered the locker room with a four-point lead. 
Then something changed. The Irish tightened their inside defense in the seeond half. 
IIill and Kale netted only 10 points in the second stanza and Notre Dame was able to win the rebound battle. What was the difference? ;\couple of feet. 
"I think we did a better job of pushing IIill and Kale ofT the post so the post move was coming about four feet deep­er," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "The jump hook was outside the paint instead of inside like the first half. That was the key." 
;\ couple of feet means the difforence between a lay-up and a tricky seven-foot jump shot. By keeping llill and Kale away from the basket, the Irish were able to affect their rhythm and force some missed shots. 
Thanks to Notre Dame's post defense, nobody from Providence was in the paint to collect the rebounds ofT these missed shots. The

they had trouble doing earlier this season-and get their tran­sition game going off the defensive glass. 
"Once we tightened the defense, we were able to get out and run a little bit more, pass and cut, and make plays," Irish forward Zach llillesland said. 

This allowed Notre Dame to build a lead and earn the vic­tory. 
The Irish play DePaul again Tuesday night and if they hope to advance deep into March, post defense is going to be the difference. Odds are they will run into one of these teams again at the Big East tournament, not to mention a possible Big Dance matchup against Ohio State, Texas or North Carolina. 
It's no coincidence that the Irish scored under 70 points in their last three losses. Notre Dame's offense works best when it can push the ball up the floor and seore before the opponent is set (see: Syracuse, Alabama). If oppos­ing offenses can work the ball inside and earn layups or trips to the free throw line, they ean slow the pace of the game down and force the Irish to faee set defenses. 
Notre Dame's 
season does not 
rest on Colin 
Falls' and 

John's. Falls 
and Carter are 
the type of players that will get their points, so long as they are healthy. The season does not rest on Tory Jackson's shoul­ders. The freshman point guard has done an outstand­ing job defensively all year, while his offensive game matures with each outing. 
The post defense of Luke Harangody, Zach Hillesland and Rob Kurz can make or break the Irish in the coming weeks. 
All it takes is a couple of feet.
