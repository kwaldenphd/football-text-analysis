Capitol Records won the right to begin exclusive distribution of a new "comebaek" album by Donny Osmond in a court dispute between the record company and another record producer. Former Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, head of Curb Records, had contended he gained exclusive rights to distribute the song "Soldier of Love" and other songs Osmond recently recorded. But U.S. district Judge Robert Takasugi ruled Tuesday that a March 6 agreement gave Capitol the right to distribute the new album. 
1,000 people packed a synagogue Wednesday to re~ember Yippie founder Abbie Hoffman. He was found dead at hiS home near New Hope, Pa., on April12. A coroner ruled Tuesday that Hoffman committed suicide with an overdose of barbiturates mixed with alcohol. Friends and relatives said they doubted Hof-. fman took his own life. 
Lucille Ball, the zany redheaded queen of comedy, was in serious condition today after seven hours of emergency high-risk cardiac surgery during which she received heart tissue donated from a 27-year-old man. The 77-year-old comedian suffered a heart attack at her Beverly Hills home Tuesday, and arrived at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with her husband, Gary Morton. Doctors said her condition was serious but stable. Miss Ball was still unconscious 12 hours after the surgery. 
STATE BRIEIFS 
Teen miracle, Lisa Willoughby insists she is just a regular teen-ager. Her mother calls her a miracle because the heart of an anonymous donor beats inside the body of the 15-year-old. Lisa was the youngest heart transplant patient at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis in July 1987. Just a few months after she was diaganosed as having congestive heart failure she had a new heart. Ten days after the 5 hour surgery Lisa was home, predicted to live a healthy and normal life. 
Well-wishers showered money gifts in an outpouring of support Wednesday for 5-year-old, Erin Bower who lost her left hand in a bomb explosion at an Indianapolis K mart store. She may recover only partial sight in her left eye as a result of the blast Monday night, Methodist Hospital physicians said. A pipe bomb had been concealed in a pump-type toothpaste dispenser that the child picked up while shopping with her mother. 
Pigeons' days in Terre Haute may be numbered if the City Council goes through with a $2,350 proposal to get rid of the birds. Council members are considering a proposal from Daniel Budde of Norris City, Ill., who says he can help officials rid the city of 90 percent of its pigeon problem. Councilman Larry Kirchner told his colleagues during a meeting last week that Budde's plan entails trapping the pigeons and selling them to a breeder. The breeder in turn would mate them for the purpose of producing squab, a nestling pigeon that many people consider a delicacy, Kirchner said.

Activities make proper balance more difficult 
DOOMSDAY. 
That's what's scrawled in huge red letters at the top of my calender this month. Beneath this, I've even written the exact date that Doomsday happens to fall on. 
No, Doomsday's not the day that the greater part of the California coast falls into the Pacific, nor is it the Second Coming--it's the date I have another major research ]Paper due. 
Yes, this is the very same paper that I in­tended to start the second week of the semester so it would be ready to publish next week. Ya, sure. 
Let the descent into academic hell begin. 
Hardly a wasted day goes by, and still I can­not find time to accomplish half of what I should or want to do. 
We all take five classes a semester (with many exceptions), yet most professors would like to believe that theirs is the only one. The History of Rational Thinkers in an Irrational World Laden with Death and War may be a perfectly interesting and inspiring class. But when it comes down to a choice between getting five instead of four hours of sleep a night, having clean underwear, and doing "suggested readings" for my History of Rational. .. class, sorry to say, I'll usually break down and choose one of the former two options. 
And what are "suggested readings anyway?" Rumor has it that they are for all of us who devour the books on the required reading list (weeks in advance of their assigned dates) and then hanker for MORE .. Not a bad thing all together in theory, but who are we kidding? For the most part, required readings tend to be both interesting and time consuming. I rarely have the opportunity to finish those read­ings, let alone any extra ones, no matter how fascinating they may be. 
Another errant concept that prevails is that of the "extra-credit assignment." There are only two reasons for offering them: 1.) to pro­vide more work for those who have finished the "suggested readings" and still do not feel ful­filled, and 2.) to "help" those who performed less-than-scholarly on the last exam. Though I am no Gallup pollster, I would venture to say that the second reason is the more popular of the two.

'A balance 
between academics and extra-curriculars is needed ... ' 
Christine Walsh Assistant News Editor 

We could abolish extra-credit assignments forever if we would only get 4.0's the first time around. In the ideal world we would all just be academic machines, cranking out tests and papers like the New York Times crossword. Unfortunately, this is not nirvana, this is Notre Dame. 
Why do we have occassional abysmal showings on tests and turn in late papers? Sometimes it's just not possible to devote our complete attention to a test or paper, even though it might be in the "only class we take." 
As members of the Notre Dame community, we students are supposed to take part in volun­teer work: at Logan Center, tutoring, and even cleaning up the Northeast neighborhood. Many of us are involved in sports, from football to fencing to Bookstore Basketball. Some of us even work for clubs and other organizations. These are things that we are genuinely inter­ested in, just as much, if not more than our classroom studies. 
These activities have one thing in common: 
They take lots of time. 
Given time contraints, a balance between academics and extra-curriculars is needed, and neither one should be more important than the other. 
In the ideal world we could read suggested readings, do extra-credit assignments for simple academic edification, play varsity soc­cer, and work at the esc. While this is an im­possibility, what we can and should strive for is to do the best we can with what time we are afforded, and hopefully learn and accomplish something along the way.

According to Russo, about two thirds of the student body recieve some kind of financial aid. This statistic includes all financial aid recieved by any student from sources inside or outside of the University. 
Russo forsees no drastic in­crease in funds for student aid from the federal government in the future. "Although we have had no clear signals as of yet, I don't see any drastic changes in aid from the Reagan admin­istration," Russo said. 
"I think that the current trend toward more student loan money and less grant money will not change. Before Reagan took office there was a more reasonable balance between loans and grants," said Russo.

Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp., gestures at a news confer­ence in New York Tuesday. Rawl defended his company's response to the Alaskan oil spill, blaming delays on indecisive regulatory agencies. 
Associated Press 
SEWARD, ALASKA--A So­viet ship that can skim oil on the high seas joined the war against the nation's worst oil spill Wednesday, docking in a town named for the man who bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million. 
The 11,400-ton Vaidogubsky, 425 feet long, steamed 30 miles up fjord-like Resurrection Bay under a cloudy sky, flying the Soviet hammer and sickle from its stern and an American flag from its towering white super­structure. 
It tied up at a railroad dock, its decks strewn with heavy equipment, smoke spewing from its stacks. 
About 100 yards away, crews unloaded oil-soaked booms and ­absorbent material from the cleanup at Nuka Bay, one of the most polluted sites on the southern coast of the Kenai Peninsula. 
"It's pretty impressive for a. skimmer," said Coast Guard Petty Officer Ken Safford, who snapped photos as the ship ar­rived a little before 8 a.m. "It's huge." 
By midmorning, a stream of tourists were driving up to the dock to take pictures and wave to the crew.

The ship came to Seward for refueling, and probably would be in port all day, said Coast Guard Capt. Rene Roussel. 
The oil spilled March 24 by an Exxon tanker is becoming very thick and difficult to deal with as it weathers, Roussel said. 
"We don't know how it (the Vaidogubsky) is going to work in the kind of oil we're skim­ming," he said. "Our goal is to get in the oil. We'll probably use it in Resurrection Bay for awhile." 
The Vaidogubsky works with two motorboats that drag a boom to corral the oil. Then two pipes working like 100-foot straws dip into the oil and suck it onto the larger ship, said a Soviet crewman who spoke in halting English. 
If there's not enough oil there to justify its continued use, the Coast Guard will move it "to where the oil is. Nuka Bay is our most likely plan,'' he said. 
The Vaidogubsky probably will be available for 30 days, Roussel said. It's unclear who will pay its fuel and operating costs, he said. 
Exxon has promised to pay the costs of the total cleanup effort. 
Seward this week became the first town outside Prince William Sound to have oil wash up on a beach. 

"If they (the Soviets) can capture oil out there and pick it up before it blows on shore, that's much to our advantage," Seward deputy city manager Darryl Schaefermeyer said. 
"Our goal is to get the oil picked up and not wait until it gets on beaches, and then have to clean beaches." 
The oil that washed ashore near Seward was a taffy-like goop mixed with seaweed, and was cleaned up Tuesday. But more oil was in Resurrection Bay, and still more reported on nearby islands and headlands of the Kenai Peninsula, includ­ing at Kenai Fjords National Park. 
The oil has been streaming into the Gulf of Alaska from Prince William Sound where the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef and spilled 10.1 million gal­lons of North Slope crude oil.

Bush and Hussein talk about Mid-East peace 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON--President Bush and Jordan's King Hus­sein agreed Wednesday to strive for "a serious negotiat­ing process" for Middle East peace, and the United States said the monarch did not reject an Israeli proposal for Pales­tinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Mter the two leaders talked for more than an hour at the White House, the administra­tion expressed satisfaction over Hussein's statement to Bush that "I fully support you and all your efforts." 
Hussein's visit marked the end of the first round of Middle East diplomacy for Bush, fol­lowing talks earlier this month with Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. 
As he had done with the two others, Bush played tour guide for the king. 
He took Hussein by helicop­ter to Mount Vernon, Va., to visit the home of George Wash­ington overlooking the Potomac River. They returned to the capital on a yacht con­fiscated from drug merchants and now owned by the Navy. 
Standing alongside Hussein in a Rose Garden ceremony, Bush said, "The time has come to encourage fresh thinking, to avoid sterile debate and to focus on the difficult but criti­cal work of structuring a serious negotiating process. 
"His majesty committed Jor­dan to this task and I commit the United States to this task," Bush said. 
The administration said the next step was to develop Shamir's proposal for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the oc­cupied territories to elect rep­resentatives to negotiate with Israel on limited self­government. 
The United States has en­dorsed the proposal on the con­dition that the elections lead to negotiations on the final status of the territories. 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Ned Walker told Congress that the United States wants a timetable from Israel by July for the elections. 
But he said that "serious dif­ficulties" remain over what kind of elections would be held and which Palestinians would agree to take part. 
Walker said it should not matter to Israel whether can­didates are card-carrying members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

North's lawyer ends defense 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON--Oliver North's lawyer, in an emo­tional final argument Wednes­day, portrayed the former White House aide as a sacrifi­cial lamb, a scapegoat and a hostage, and implored jurors in his trial to "set him free." 
"Oliver North never wanted to be a hero," said Brendan Sul­livan. "He just wants to go home." 
But prosecutor John Keker, having the last word, asked the jury to "return a verdict of guilty in each and every one of the 12 charges." 
With that, the 9 women and 3 men who will decide North's fate were sent home. They will return Thursday to begin their deliberations after instructions~ from U.S. district Judge Ger­hard Gesell. During deliberat­ion, the jury will be seques­tered for the first time since the Iran-Contra trial began. 
In his hour-long rebuttal, Keker said it had been an "un­happy, unpleasant, miserable criminal trial," and dismissed Sullivan's closing argument with a Shakesperian touch: "it was all sound and fury, signify­ing nothing." 
"You have heard a lot about courage at this trial," Keker said. "There's another kind of courage: courage, to admit when you are wrong, corage to admit personal responsibility, courage to admit guilt where appropriate. He <North) has not admitted any of those things; it's time for you to do 
·it for him." 
It was the end of two tough days for North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel whose power while he was at the National Security Council was substantial. His face paled and he busied himself with writing while Keker denounced him; he looked at the jury while Sullivan pleaded for him. 
"The government has not shown criminal behavior," Sul­livan said. "The man who held the lives of others in his hands, now puts his life into yours." The reference was to North's protecting names of people he dealt with by shredding or al­tering documents, which Sul­livan saw as "a reasonable thing to do." 
Keker had another explana­tion: "he was destroying docu­ments deliberately so they wouldn't find what he didn't want them to find." 
Mter the arguments, North's mood brightened and he joined his wife, who was speaking with a minister in the front row of spectators. 
Sullivan, choked with emo­
tion throughout much of his 
three-hour closing argument, 
mentioned President Reagan's telephone call on the day North was fired, a call in which the president called North "a na­tional hero," and also a postcard North got from then­Vice President Bush thanking him for his work. 

"All these people who went to Ollie North for help, where are they now?" Sullivan asked. 
Summing up North's defense in the trial's 12th week, Sul­livan said he had done his job well as a White House aide, fol­lowing superiors' orders to help the Nicaraguan rebels, then was thrown overboard as Reagan sought to escape poli­tical heat over the affair. 
Sullivan told the jury that North, who had worked to free American hostages in Lebanon, has been, in a sense, a hostage himself. 
"I ask you, on the evidence, to set him free," said Sullivan. 
In the spectator section, be­hind North at the defense table, were his wife and three of his four children. Betsy North had been at the trial before, but it was a first for the children. During a recess, North took their youngest daughter by the hand and walked with her down the courtroom corridor. 
North is charged with 12 cri­minal counts, including lying to Congress and the attorney gen­eral, illegally converting traveler's checks to his own use. 
Security tightened at animal labs 


Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS--Security is being tightened at animal re­search laboratories at Indiana­Purdue of Indianapolis out of concern for possible protests by militant animal rights ac­tivists, officials say. 
Some activists protesting the treatment of laboratory animals have resorted to such tat!tics as bomb threats, break­ins at research facilities, theft of research animals and arson, says George Stookey, chair­man of the IUPUI animal care committee, which oversees wide-ranging studies involving thousands of animals. 
"These are really terrorist­type activities," he says. "We take it all very seriously." 
Stookey said lab security has been stepped up on the IUPUI campus, which includes the IU schools of medicine and den­tistry and the Purdue School of Science. 
The added precautions are in response an April 2 fire at the University of Arizona in Tuc­son. A group called Animal Liberation Front claimed re­sponsibility for the blaze, which caused more than $100,000 damage, and also stole 1,200 animals--including mice that had been infected, as part of an experiment, with a germ potentially fatal to humans. 
There have been no reports of threats or lab vandalism lo­cally, but IUPUI researchers are no longer assuming it won't ever happen. 
"Ten years ago it was kind of like it couldn't happen here," said Wendell McBurney, IUPUI's dean of research and sponsored programs. "I think that now people realize it could." 
The animal studies are con­tinuing, with as many as 22 mil­lion animals used in the United States for research, education or product testing. Perhaps 90 percent are rodents. But many species, including cats, dogs and monkeys, are used. At Purdue's West Lafayette campus, where about 7,000 re­search animals are housed, the ranks even include llamas. 

Last year, an animal rights movement mounted a massive letter-writing campaign that resulted in a Cornell University professor forfeiting a $530,000 grant to study the effects of barbiturate withdrawal on cats. The activists claimed the tests were inhumane and of little practical value. 
That special-interest groups could increasingly determine the course of medical research is of great concern in the sci­entific community, which can no longer afford to take the movement lightly. 
"What we're doing is ab­solutely proper, appropriate and necessary," Stookey said. "The problem as we see it is that our fellow citizens don't understand that; they don't know what we're doing." 
Most of the medical breakthroughs of this century-­from the polio vaccine to organ 
transplants--took place as a consequence of animal tests, and that to dispense with the experiments would devastate efforts to find cures for dis­eases such as cancer and AIDS, he said.

Abortion ruling needs reversal 
Throughout most of its history, the United States has had laws prohibiting abortion on demand. In 1973, the Supreme Court made history with its landmark Roe v. Wade decision, declaring a fetus was not a person and thus did not possess legal rights. The Mis­souri case now pending before the court provides it with the opportunity to review its previous decision. 
The legalization of abortion by the Supreme Court was both a national tragedy and a national disgrace. In the United States nearly one-third of all preg­nancies now end in abortion, and contrary to popular belief, no significant legal barriers exist to abortion at any time during the full nine months of pregnancy. 
It is time for abortion to end. Except in cases of rape or when the life of the mother is threatened, abortion is wrong and should not be legal. 
A fetus is a human life, a separate biological entity from its mother. With Roe v. Wade, however, the Supreme Court made the dubious assertion that this entity was not a person since it was not "capable of meaningful life.'' Thus it was not entitled to the same rights as a person outside a mother's womb. 
This decision gave human life a relative value. No longer would every human have a right to live simply because he or she exists. The absolute value of a human's right to live could be replaced by subjective determinations of whether that life was worth living. A human could then be discriminated against on the basis of his or her age and place of residence. 
No one would deny that some of the arguments for abortion raise valid concerns. A person's right to privacy, in this case, the privacy of a mother to do as she wishes with her body, is an important right and certainly worth protecting. 
One person's rights, however, stop where those of another start. The right of a mother to do as she wishes with her body does not include the right to destroy a life within her.

Cruel prank at Theodore's reflects poorly on ND 
Dear Editor: 
The Kinsey Report appeared at Theodore's this past Satur­day night and, before the performers were a half hour into their show, something deeply tragic occurred. An ob­ject, presumably a launched waterballoon, was thrown through a window at the side of the stage and cut two mem­bers of the band, spreading glass all over the stage and most of the equipment. Thank­fully no one was seriously hurt, but the Kinsey Report felt too uncomfortable to continue. They could have been badly cut and were not about to chance going back on stage. 
The Kinsey Report came to entertain the students of Notre Dame and instead felt threatened by them. It's diffi­cult to believe that the sling­shotted balloon came through that window accidentally. One needed only to observe the lights and the noise emanating from the club to conclude that not only was there a perfor­mance going on, but also that there were probably many fans present. The intent of those re­sponsible for this act is clear-­to practice some dangerously childish prank. However, the exact motive is still unknown, though some of the people af­filiated with the band per­ceived the incident to be ra­cially provoked. 

Notre Dame, as a Catholic in­stitution, professes to be a loving community in the name of Christ. Yet, as one of the members of The Kinsey Report pointed out, "Actions speak louder than words." It is incon­ceivable that the Notre Dame philosophy fosters such actions in its students: a hypocrisy wherein we profess our beliefs as one thing, then turn around and do quite another. It is un­fortunate when incidents like this occur at Notre Dame be­cause there are a lot of positive aspects to this University. Regrettably, The Kinsey Report was not given the op­portunity to find them out. Per­haps, some day, they will be able to return and discover what these good things are. We must always remember that no matter how good we profess ourselves to be, there is always room for improvement. And it is our job to work together to attain what we profess. 
To Ralph, Donald, Ken, Ron, Lester, Matt, and the rest of The Kinsey Report, we extend our deepest apologies on behalf of the entire University with the sincere hope that someth­ing like this does not happen again.

Americans need to attack apartheid at home first 
Dear Editor: 
Reading Tom Varnum's column on divestment inspired me to get "out of my little world" and get involved in this worn-out discussion of the evils of South Mrica. Actually, it was the self-righteous and ar­rogant tone of the column that made me respond. 
Mr. Varnum attempts to use logic to say that we are all guilty of social injustice in South Mrica. I for one am sure that I have never killed anyone, and I dare anyone to prove that my tuition dollars have, either. Mr. Varnum wrongly asserts that Notre Dame's investment in South Mrica makes the Uni­versity responsibie for the deaths caused by the Botha government. 
Mr. Varnum and the group that meets every Friday on the steps of the Administration Building are attempting to make a statement. However, just as my tuition dollars or 60­cent can of Coke has not killed anyone, neither has their weekly protest saved any lives. My point is this: Tom Varnum, or ten Tom Varnums for that matter, cannot change apar­theid; only the power players can. Once Notre Dame or any university divests, it ceases to be a power player. If we sell our stock in companies doing business in South Africa, some­one else will buy it. That's basic economics. As far as the black man in South Mrica is con­cerned, the ownership may have changed but the oppres­sion continues. What good does that do for Notre Dame? 

In order for Notre Dame and its anti-apartheid network to have any real effect, it must exert pressure on the South Mrican government. However, as Americans, we are in a poor bargaining position to do this. We attend a school with few black students, fewer black professors, and virtually no black administrators. We come from a nation where Martin Luther King's dream of social and racial equality remains but a dream. When we claim that South Mrica is an unjust soci­ety, we reek of hypocrisy. 
If Tom Varnum or any pro­divestment person really wants to help the plight of the black man or woman in South Mrica, he should reach out to the oppressed here first. When America can become a nation without its own social im­morality, then it can accuse other nations of being immoral. 
This Friday, then, don't stand on the steps of the Ad­ministration Building calling for divestment. Spend your af­ternoon at the Hope Rescue Mission or the homeless shel­ter. Spend it helping the admissions department find qualified minorities who want to attend Notre Dame. Spend it making this school and this country places of social and ra­cial and economic equality. Then, and only then, can we battle the rest of the world. 

Community members appreciate service effort 
Dear Editor: 
Our sincere thanks and ap­preciation to all who made the "Christmas in April" project such a huge success. The area never looked better. 
We particularly want to thank all the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students who gave up a day to help in the clean-up-fix-up-paint-up. Also to be thanked are the Notre Dame administration folks, the 

business and professional people who gave of their time, and the staff of Neighborhood Housing Services for their many, many hours spent in co­ordinating the project. 
This is what "community" is all about.

An Tostal update: St. Ed's Charity Carnival 
a new twist to tradition--having fun 
STEPHANIE SNYDER 
accent writer 
N
o matter how old we get, there is always a child inside each of us that has to be let loose every once in a while. 
This Sunday, April 23, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students have the op­portunity to regress back to those simple but zany childish years at the first annual St. Edward's Charity Carnival. This event will take place from 12 noon to 11:00 p.m. at Stepan Center. 
Just like old times, the magical atmosphere of a car­nival will be recreated through such traditional favorites as wacky clowns and jugglers, lively music, game booths, and carnival goodies ranging from hot dogs to cotton candy. 
The most important treat from the Charity Carnival, however, is the magic that continues even when the music has stopped and the booths have been taken down. 
The proceeds from the car­nival will be sent to charities in South Bend giving younger, less fortunate children a chance to perhaps experience the magic of a carnival if not

A special booth--a dunk tank--has been donated by St. Eds. Each dorm will receive one half hour in which they will try to entice the greatest amount of participants. The winning dorm will receive a plaque. Warning: rectors, be prepared to take a swim this Sunday. 
In addition, there will be a day-long raffle for autograp­hed basketballs and footballs. 
Other entertainment will include palm reading, a caricaturist, a tatooist (they will be temporary tatoos), and music entertainment

at the same time that Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents are happily reliving the frolicking antics of ten-year­olds, with every carnival ticket they purchase they will also be helping other young kids. 
Twenty dorms from both campuses have enthusiastic­ally agreed to create their own unique booth for the car­nival. Tickets need~d in order to play these carnival booths will be sold at a separate 
booth for 25 cents each. 
Each dorm will then decide to charge a certain amount of tickets for participation in their booth. The extra money made off each booth, after subtracting construction costs, will be donated to charities in South Bend of each dorm's choice.

Power and Glory a moving tale 
ROBYN SIMMONS Assistant Accent Editor 
S 
outhern Mexico during the anti-clerical purge of the 1930's is the setting for "The Power and the Glory," a powerful play about the strength of religion and the human spirit. This weekend in Washington Hall, the Notre Dame Communication and Theatre Department presents an adaptation of the Graham Greene novel of the same name, and the result is both moving and spellbinding. 
The innovative method in which the company interprets Greene's novel and Michael Murphy's performance as the "whiskey priest" on the run is what makes "The Power and the Glory" such a quality product. Murphy plays an alcoholic priest who is a fugi­tive of the revolutionary gov­ernment, hiding out in the local villages. Murphy's char­acter is physically and spiri­tually exhausted, and Murphy's haggard appear­ance is quite convincing. 
BUZZ MC FLATTOP 
Murphy's character is both dispicable and admirable. Not only is the priest an irrespon­sible drinker, but he is the father of an illegitimate child. As a priest he feels useless and admits "I can't absolve myself.'' 
A ruthless Lieutenant, played by Duane J. DiFranco, relentlessly pursues the priest and in the process kills a total of 12 hostages in various villages for refusing to divulge the priest's whereabouts. In the face of such a threat to his life and his fear of capture, the priest finds himself lured constantly by the needs of other people who ask him to say Mass, hear a confession, or to bless them. 
Despite the fact that the viUagers the priest comes across want him to go away, no one will turn him in. Mter another hostage is taken away, the priest exclaims, "I did my best. It's your job to give me up. What do you ex­pect of me? It's my job not to get caught." Later on, he tells prisoners in a jail cell about the reward for his cap­ture and asks them, "Will nobody be my Judas?" 
When the play opens, the members of the cast recite passages of Greene's novel in the form of a narrative in­stead of going directly into the dialogue. The various members of the cast are spread throughout the theatre, and the actors use the passages from the novel to set the scene as they walk towards the stage. Through­out the play, new scenes are marked by the actors narrat­ing events followed by a return to the normal dialogue. 
"The Power and the Glory" deals with political oppres­sion, martyrdom, but most importantly, the sense of duty that a priest feels towards his fellow human beings and his God. The performance and its message will leave the audiences thinking about what they saw long after the curtain comes down.

Mazzi li leads Mets over Phils 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK --Lee Mazzili's three-run pinch homer off Philadelphia relief ace Steve Bedrosian with two out in the eighth inning gave the New York Mets a 4-2 victory over the Phillies on Wednesday night. 
The Phillies had taken a 2-1 lead in the top of the eighth on Ricky Jordan's run-scoring single. 
Kevin McReynolds lined out a two-out double off Jeff Parrett in the bottom of the eighth and Bedrosian came on and walked Howard Johnson. 
Mazzilii, pinch hitting for Barry Lyons, then homered to right field. It was his fifth career pinch homer --four com­ing with the Mets. 
Kevin Elster of the Mets set a major league record when he played his 73rd consecutive game at shortstop without making an error. 
Padres 4, Giants 3 
Benito Santiago hit a two-run homer and drove in another run with a single Wednesday as the San Diego Padres beat the San Francisco Giants 4-3. 
Eric Show, 3-1, allowed four hits and three runs in 7 2-3 in­nings to pick up the win. Mark Dav: .ed up to gain his seventh sc. ·e in seven appear­ances. 
Giants reliever Craig Lef­der in the ninth to extend his streak of consecutive outs to 29. The major league record is 41, set by Jim Barr of the Giants in 1972. 
Pirates 7, Cardinals 5 
Rafael Belliard and Tom Prince each drove in two runs and Pittsburgh capitalized on an Ozzie Smith error for the second straight day as the Pirates beat the St. Louis Car­dinals 7-5 Wednesday. 
Smith, considered the best fielding shortstop in the game, made a throwing error during a three-run rally by Pittsburgh in the fourth inning. On Tues­day night, the Pirates scored the winning runs when Smith booted a grounder with two outs in the ninth. 
Expos 3, Cubs 2 
Tom Foley and Nelson San­tovenia hit consecutive home runs in the fourth inning Wed­nesday night, leading the Montreal Expos past the Chicago Cubs 3-2 and a sweep of the three-game series. 
The Cubs entered the the se­ries with a seven-game winning streak--their longest since June 1983. 
Dennis Martinez, 1-0, al­lowed eight hits in eight-plus in­nings for his first victory since 
ferts retired the Padres in or-Aug. 24.

Tigers 3, Twins 2 
Matt Nokes' two-run ninth­inning homer spoiled winless Frank Viola's $7.9 million birthday party Wednesday night and lifted the Detroit Tigers to a 3-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins. 
Viola, 0-3, the 1988 American League Cy Young award win­ner, had been involved in bitter contract negotiations for more than two weeks before agree­ing to a three-year, $7.9 million deal earlier Wednesday, his 29th birthday. 
Winner Doyle Alexander, 2-0, allowed six hits in eight innings and Guillermo Hernandez pitched a perfect ninth, strik­ing out two, for his second SC;lVe. 
Athletics 7, Mariners 5 
Dave Stewart improved to 4-0 and Terry Steinbach drove in three runs, leading the Oakland Athletics past the Seattle Mariners 7-5 on Wednesday. 
Stewart owns the major league's best record after yielding four runs and eight hits. He struck out one and walked two in six innings before Greg Cadaret relieved. Last April, Stewart was 6-0 and has won his last 13 decisions in April. 


The Montreal Expos may enjoy knocking each other around, but lately they've been concentrating their efforts on beating up the Chicago Cubs. The Expos won again Wednesday 3-2.

ND track splits for weekend 
By GREG SCHECKENBACH Sports Writer 
Once again, the Notre Dame track team will split up this weekend and attend two differ­ent track meets in Indianapolis and Kansas. The top relay teams and middle distance run­ners will travel to Lawrence for the prestigious Kansas Relays, while most of the other individ­ual competitors will travel downstate for the Indiana In­tercollegiate Meet. 
This is the first time in a few years the Irish have partici­pated in the Kansas Relays. Recently, the meet has not been as competitive, but this year the meet organizers recruited more of the top teams which should make the meet stronger again. 
Notre Dame will send the sprint medley relay team and the 4x1 mile relay team to Kansas with high hopes. 
"Both of our relay teams should fair well this weekend," said Head Coach Joe Piane. "They should challenge for the top three in their races." 
The sprint medley relay team consists of Richard Culp, Xavier Victor, Yan Searcy, and Brian Peppard, The experi­enced 4x1 mile team includes Ryan Cahill, Mike Rogan, Tom O'Rourke, and Ron Markezich. Markezich, who recently qualified for the National meet in the 10,000 meter race, will anchor the relay team with a much shorter distance than he is accustomed to. 
"The shorter distance and faster pace should do worlds of good for Markezich,'' stated Piane. 
Markezich agrees with Piane that it will help him running such a short distance. 
"It will definitely help my speed in the long run," said Irish co-captain Markezich. "The quicker pace should prepare me for the competition in the 10,000 meters." 
Other athletes traveling to Kansas are Glen Watson in the uo meter high hurdles, John Cole in the high jump, and David Warth, Mark Lavery, Kevin Whelan, and Brian Pep­pard in the 800 meters. Relay members Searcy and Culp will also compete in the 400 meter

race. Dan Garrett will abstain due to injury. 
"This meet gives us a chance to run some relays we can't usually run," said Piane. "It also gives our individuals a chance to improve their time or height in a non-qualifying situation." 
The Indiana Intercollegiate meet will also offer great com­petition for the Irish. This, being a qualifying meet, is very important for many Notre Dame athletes. 
John Stewart will be looking to qualify for the IC4A javelin competition, while numerous others will look to qualify in their individual events. Bill Hobbs will run a 10,000 while Shawn Schneider will run his first ever 5000 meter race. Jeff Smith, who has already qualified, will compete in the long jump and Scott Vanden­berg will run the quarter mile. 
Last year the Irish had eight athletes place in the top three in Indianapolis. This year may not be as successful since many of the top runners are going to Kansas.

Carlton quits after three-year struggle 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA --Steve Carlton gave up a three-year struggle to remain in the game he loved, telling the baseball world Wednesda'y he is through pitching after repeated com­eback attempts. 
The 44-year-old "Lefty" wouldn't use the word "retire­ment" in the announcement that came almost a year since his last release. 
Even this spring, Carlton -­coming off September surgery to remove eight chips from his pitching shoulder --still was trying to show major league teams that he had the same fire that earned him four Cy Young awards. 
"My arm hasn't rehabilitated the way I had hoped," Carlton said in a brief statement issued by the Philadelphia Phillies, for whom he recorded 241 of his 329 career wins. 
"I'm still experiencing some pain and I've decided I no

longer would be active as a player." 
The Phillies said they would retire his uniform number, 32, in a July 29 ceremony. 
Club President Bill Giles said Carlton is "not officially retir­ing, according .to him, but we're going to honor him anyway." 
Giles said that if someone wanted Carlton, he might try another comeback. 
"But he feels it's not going to happen, at least in the major leagues, although you never 
know when somebody's going to call," said Giles. 
· He said Carlton apparently "still has a glimmer of hope that Japan might be inter­ested." National League spokes­woman Katy Feeney said Carlton remains technically a free agent, because he was released by his last club, the Minnesota Twins. She said he would not go on a voluntary retired list since he belongs to no club. Giles said he thinks Carlton really is finished pitching this time. "In fact I tried to talk him into retiring two or three years ago," Giles said. "But he thou ht he could still pitch."

Irish sweep SW Michigan; Linn shuts down Roadrunners 
By MARY GARINO Sports Writer The Notre Dame softball team was not very neighborly Wednesday when it played host to Southwest Michigan College. The Irish whipped the Roadrunners in both ends of a doubleheader, 6-0 and 9-1. Notre Dame raised its record to 22-15 with the two wins over SW Michigan. In the first game, Megan Fay led a ten hit attack with an RBI double in the first inning for the only run the Irish would need. Fay later scored a run in the third inning when the Irish added two runs to their total. In the bottom of the sixth in­ ning, Dawn Boulac, who finished the game a perfect 3 for 3 at the plate, led off with a double and scored. Mary Verardi also scored for the last Irish run. Freshman Missy Linn al­lowed only three hits in seven innings to improve her record to 17-11. Linn struck out four and walked only one en route to the victory. Notre Dame wasted no time scoring in the second game. Once again it was Fay who started the team off when she reached for a high pitch and drove it up the middle to score Ruth Kmak in the first inning. The Irish exploded for seven runs on seven hits in the bottom  of the second to put the game out of reach. The big hit for the team was provided by Kmak, who launched a single to right field with the bases loaded, scoring three runs. Later, two other players scored on Roadrunner miscues. Dawn Boulac scored in the bottom of the sixth to bring the Irish total to nine runs. SW Michigan scored its lone run in the top of the seventh. Barb Mooney evened her record at 4-4 with a complete game performance. Mooney scattered eight hits and al­lowed only one run, unearned. Irish head coach Brian Boulac was pleased with her effort. "For Barb to pitch a full  game is really great," he said.· "She's pitching more and more each time, and she's getting stronger. She's made a big im­provement." In the second game, the Notre Dame defense was at its best. The Irish turned three double plays in the game, a team record. Mary Verardi was particularly outstanding, making three stellar catches in left field. "We played really well defensively," Boulac noted. "Everyone got in the games and I'm pleased with the way they responded." Both games were played without umpires. Coaches from each team substituted for urn­ pires by mutual agreement. Notre Dame will face a tough challenge this weekend when it participates in the DePaul Tournament in Chicago. The Irish will open play on Friday with a game against Wisconsin­Green Bay, a team that has already beaten the Irish twice this past season. Also on Friday Notre Dame will play Loyola an hour after the Wisconsin game. Loyola holds a less than respectable record of 1-29, and Notre Dame was responsible for three of those losses. Notre Dame will continue play on Saturday with a game against the host team, DePaul, which has a 25-12 record.  
Irish continued from page 16 The Irish finally got a hold of Dan Jones, the third Northwes­tern pitcher, in the fifth inning. Jones allowed six consecutive hits, including a triple by Coss, as Notre Dame took the lead for good. Coss' hit knocked in Moshier and Pat Eilers with the game-tying runs. Pat Pesavento's single drove home Coss with the eventual winning run. Northwestern pitchers hit three Notre Dame batters in the inning, and the Irish scored three more times in the fifth to take a 7-3 lead. Notre Dame almost lost that lead in the next inning. Mter hitting a single, Northwes­tern's Ryan Oetting attempted to steal second. Martinez's  throw beat the runner, but Mos­hier misplayed the tag and al­lowed Oetting to reach second. Moshier's error led to three un­earned runs for the Wildcats. The Irish came back with three runs of their own in the last half of the sixth. Dan Pel­tier scored Coss with a double to give Notre Dame an 8-6lead. Northwestern then elected to intentionally walk James Sass and pitch to Binkiewicz. The freshman first baseman thanked the Wildcats by driving in Counsell and Peltier with a single. Northwestern scored two more runs in the ninth, but sophomore reliever Mike Cof­fey came on to save Livorsi's third win of the season. Coffey, who pitched one scoreless in­ ning, has seven saves with a 5-0 record. EXTRA BASES: Peltier finished with a single and double, extending his hitting streak to 15 games...

Flyers 4, Penguins 2 
Tim Kerr scored a first­period hat trick as the Philadel­phia Flyers beat the Pittsburgh P~nguins 4-2 Wednesday night, tymg the Patrick Division finals at one win apiece. 
The Flyers shrugged off a 76­minute delay resulting from a pre-game power failure to score two first-period power play goals --both by Kerr --and surge into a 3-1 lead for the second straight game. 
But unlike Pittsburgh's 4-3 victory in the opener, there was no comeback this time as the aggressive Flyers keyed by Ron Hextall's clutch goaltend­ing short-circuited the Pen­guins' NHL record-setting power play, limiting them to one man-advantage goal in eight chances. 

seen time at both split end and flanker. 
"He's been very flexible, being at split end and flanker plus playing baseball," said Yelovich. "He's improved in running his routes. We expect him to be a lot better in the fall." 
Ismail and Eilers lead a pretty thin group of receivers at this point. Sophomore Ricky Watters, who led the Irish in receiving last season, has moved to tailback and caused a minor depth problem in the receiving unit. 
"We just don't have the num­bers until this fall," said Yelovich. "Pat's playing baseball, and (tight end) Frank Jacobs is playing baseball. We're limited with depth when they're gone. If we have an in­jury, then it really becomes a serious situation." 
Recruits Ray Griggs, a 6-3, 190-pounder from Crete­Monee, Ill., and William Pol­lard, a 6-5, 210-pounder from Fort Knox, Ky., will arrive in the fall to help solve Notre Dame's depth problems at receiver. 
Freshman Walter Boyd is listed as the second-team flanker. Antwon Lark and Tony Smith are battling for the second spot at split end. None of these receivers caught a pass last season. 
"They're still going through a learning process and adjustin to the offense," said Yelovich. "We'd like to have moved a lot faster progression-wise." 
Yelovich, who had worked as a collegiate offensive line co­ach for more than 20 seasons, is happy with the switch to receivers coach. For Yelovich, coaching itself is the most im­portant thing. 
"I really enjoy it, this is an area .for me to broaden my scope," said Yelovich. "Anytime you have a chance to coach, it's enjoyable, no mat­ter what position it is you're coaching."

By STEVE MEGARGEE Associate Sports Edrtor 
A couple of faces in new places, and not enough faces in general, have worked for the Notre Dame receiving corps this spring. 
Notre Dame receivers coach Tony Yelovich, one of the new faces, has liked what he has seen of the receivers so far. 
"There's been a steady progression," said Yelovich, who has moved over to the receivers after working for three years as the offensive line coach. "We're not close to where we want to be, but they've worked hard and the at­titude's been super." 
The biggest name among the receivers has been Raghib "Rocket" Ismail, another per­son whose role on the team has changed since last year's na­tional championship season. The freshman from Wilkes­Barre, Pa., moves from split end to flanker. 
Ismail caught 12 passes for 331 yards in the regular season as a split end last fall. He had switched to split end from tail­back in the first week of fall practices. 
This latest switch should enable the Irish to run Ismail from the backfield on occasion and allow him to take more ad­vantage of the speed that made him the nation's top kickoff returner last season. 
"He definitely will play various positions for us," said Yelovich. "He's done very well. He's going through a learning process, but he's ad­justed very well." 
Junior Pat Eilers figures to start at split end this fall. Eilers, a transfer from Yale, caught six passes for 66 yards last season. 
Eilers has had one _busy spring, practicing on the foot­ball team, playing baseball and making an unsuccessful run for senior class vice president. On the football field, Eilers has
