Complaints. 

Even in these relatively carefree days before homework has a chance to backlog and the drudgery of routine has begun, there are few smiles and plenty of gripes under the Dome. 
And there is no lack of materiaL 

Students are irritated by everything from a dry 
campus to incredible humidity (and the fact that it now 
costs 50 cents to cool off with a pop from a vending 
machine.) 

As usual, the dining halls are an easy target for critics. 
But this year in addition to tasteless food and endless 
lines, students are grumbling about the dining hall walls 
themselves. For those who live in Pangborn and seldom 
venture into that architectual wonder, the North 
Dining Hall, the two large dining areas in the hall have 
been divided into four smaller rooms. 

This seemingly innocuous change has attracted all sorts of criticism. Some say the new arrangement cuts down on table space in the already overcrowded hall. (Which, says Director of Notre Dame Food Services Bill Hickey, is untrue.) 
Others complain the partitions make them cramped and claustrop­hobic. Then there are those who claim their salad bar se­lection is now halved (although close observation would have revealed the pre-partition salad bars con­
tained duplicates of almost 
every item.) 
And, of course, die-hard scopers say the new walls limit their view. 

According to Bill Hickey, 
press their opinion in a director ofNotre Dame food civilized manner, the North 
services, the partitions (which are actually electronic doors) were dosed to make dining more intimate, less noisy, and to promote conversation rather than biscuit­throwing. 
There are the same number ofseats in the dining hall, but the tables have been rearranged so students can look out the windows while they dine, says Hickey. 
The doors, says Hickey, have always been present. Deb Garrard, former manager of marketing and nutri­tional services for Notre Dame Food Services, is begin­ning her first year as manager of the North dining hall. The change in leadership and the eagerness of both Hickey and Garrard to improve the atmosphere in the building prompted the closing ofthe doors. 
Closing the partitions is just one step toward Hickey's 
vision of a more intimate dining hall. Were funds 
available, he says he would replace the long, cafeteria­
style tables with round tables allowing "students to talk 
to each other"more easily.

Dining Hall will soon return to its 'former glory.' Those 
who approve of the change are likewise advised to 
make their views known. 
Complaining about the alcohol policy is probably as futile as complaining about the weather. But although dining hall partitions may be a trivial issue, at least it is one:: area where student complaints may produce con­crete results.

Man arrested, charged in maiming of six dogs in Philadelphia suburb 
A.'l!lodated Press 
PHILADELPHIA · A man was ar­rested yesterday and charged with throwing a corrosive liquid on six dogs in his neighborhood, burning one "down to the bone," after a week-long series of maimings caused four of the animals to be killed. 
Charles V. Dukes, 20, a resident of the Mount Airy section where the pets were attacked, was arrested at Municipal Court when he appeared to anwscr unrelated charges of theft and carrying firearms. 
At least two others suspects, both 
juveniles, arc being sought, officials 
said. 
'Inc corrosive material was 
thrown on the dogs in their owners' 
back yards, burning four of the pets 
so severely they had to be killed and 
partially blinding one, said pollee In· 
spectorJoseph Stasnik. 
"He has a reputation of being an all-around criminal, waiting to come of age," Stao;nik said of Dukes. 
Dukes was charged with six counts of conspiracy and six counts of cruelty to animals, pollee said. "Inc cruelty counts are mis· demeanors, carrying a maximum penalty of a S5,000 fine and two years in prison on each count, said Elaine Newton, spokeswoman for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
Stao;nik said reports from wit· ncsses led to the arrest. The SPCA had offered a S 1,000 reward after the attacks were discovered Aug. 21. 
Authorities are awaiting autopsy results to determine what the cor· rosive substance was, but Stasnik said he suspects it was something like a commercially available drain cleaner. 
One of the dogs that had to be destroyed was Troubles, a pit bull terrier belonging to Sharllta Stivender, 17, and her family. Troubles, who was 27 months old, had been put In the Stivenders' back yard to keep cool, Miss Stivender said. 
"We first noticed he was sick a few days ago. My brother heard him making unusual noises," she said. "Then the hair started coming off on his back. It made you sick just to look at it." 
Troubles was killed Tuesday at the SPCA shelter. Sam McClain ofthe SPCA said the dog had been burneti "down to the bone." 
"It's just pitiful, doing that to these dogs," Miss Stivender said. "And the dogs didn't do anything to them." 
James Street's dog also had to be killed. He noticed Saturday morning that Abdul, his Doberman pinscher, wouldn't eat. 
"Sunday, he got worse, and Mon­day, I took him to the hospital," Street said. "I couldn't get close to him, because it made me sick." 
At Fairmount Veterinary Hospital, veterinarians said Street's dog had burns over about 40 percent of its body. 
Although police received about 20 calls about attacks on dogs only six could be documented, said Ms. Newton. 
"We were informed that pollee had received other calls about animals being hit by acid, but we didn't see the animals," she said. "We would need to see some proof that other dogs were hit." 
"I personally believe the guy who did this is a sick person," said Stasnik. "I guess it was just a matter of time before he got around to humans."

they were fanned by powerful 
winds. 
But forecasters said the lull in the 
winds was not expected to last. 
The 5,000 firefighters on the lines Wednesday were being supported by 42 air tankers and 21 helicopters spraying fire retardant chemicals, said Dick Guth, a Forest Service in· formation officer in Missoula. 
"We really anticipate increasing the air show today," Guth said. 
The winds that fanned the fires earlier in the week also had grounded the air support in most areas. 
President Reagan declared three of the biggest fires disaster areas Tuesday, qualifying the state for federal aid to fight them. The designations went to the Hawk Creek fire, 75,000 acres between Billings and Roundup; the North Hill fire, 22,140 acres north of Helena, and the Houghton Creek fire near Ubby, 10,900 acres. 
"We've got new crews from all over the West," said Dorothy Terry at the Interagency Fire Dispatch Center in Helena. She said they came from at least seven states -Colorado New Mexico, California, Utah, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. 
"We're in good shape as far as re­sources, and we have adequate man­power," said Department of State Lands spokesman Don Kendall. "Weather is still the deciding fac­tor." 
He said lines might be completed around the fire late Wednesday "with a little luck." 
"That's containment," Kendall stressed. "Control is several days away on something this size." Con­tainment Is when firefighters prevent the fire from spreading, con· trol is when they start putting it out. 
Aerial infrared measurements showed the North HIJI fire near Helena expanded by about 5,000 acres Tuesday night. 
"Our major concern is north of Helena," said Roger Bergmeier of the l.i.S. Forest Sevice. "The potential there is tremendous. There are houses all along the (Missouri) river." 
lnat fire also burned several miles 
into the Gates of the Mountains Wil­

Boy commits suicide to help out his family 
Associated Press 

MARINA, Calif. -Ashocked com­munity sent food and money yester­day to the Army family of a 13-year-old boy who hanged himself after telling his mother, "Ifthere was one less mouth to feed, things would be better." 
The death of Danny Holley, who collected cans for a penny apiece to help buy food for his sister and two brothers, touched thousands of families at Fort Ord and brought hundreds ofsympathy calls. 
The troubles of the Holley family 
were not much different than those 
of many other Army families, said 
Cynthia High of the Army Emer­
gency Relief office, who had worked 
with Jennifer Holley, Danny's mot­
her. 

The family of Army E-5 johnnie Holley, stationed until next year in South Korea, had moved in June from West Germany to Fort Ord, IOO miles south of San Francisco, and was beset by bureaucratic prob­
lems. 

Promised housing was un­available, funds from their bank account were held up in transfer and their car hadn't arrived, said Ms. High, who began helping the Hol­leys july 11. 
"The army was providing services as much as possible," she said. "There are many, many cases of families who have financial troubles when they arrive at a new post." 
Mrs. Holley had received an interest-free loan of $1,300 from the relief office, emergency food supplies and assistance from an el­derly volunte_er in a Foster 
Grandmothers program. Still, it was 
difficult for the family to cope, and 
Danny took it very hard. 

"He didn't know anyone here," 
Mrs. Holley said, her eyes red from 
crying, ·as she sat in her kitchen. 
"And we couldn't go anywhere. Mrs. 
High gave us a little book ofbus tick­
ets that I'd use when I had to go to 
the doctor or something like that, 
but when they ran out, there was 
nothing. We just stayed home. 

"It was hard for him to understand why this was happening to us. guess he just didn't have the pa­tience." 
Danny used to roam the neighbor­hood collecting cans, which he sold for a penny apiece to the super­market. Neighbors showed compas­sion and saved their cans for him. Sometimes he gathered enough to bring home nine dollars. 
The money helped buy food for .his sister Erin, 4, and brothers Johnnie, 8, and Christopher, 2. Mrs. 
Holley said the children often went 
to bed hungry. 

She called Danny "a very respon­
sible child; he was so good-natured. 
He used to get up in the morning and 
make me a cup of tea and bring it to 
me in bed. He would write me little 
letters. He was a good boy." 

But several times, in moments of 
despondency, Danny would tell his 
mother, "Ifthere was one less mouth 
to feed, things would be better," 
Mrs. Holley told Ms. High. 

On Monday morning, Danny hanged himself in the backyard of the house his mother had rented. His brother Johnnie found him and called his mother, who cut him down and called an ambulance. An hour later, Danny was pronounced dead at the hospital.

On the trade front, analysts were less optimistic. The Commerce De­partment said the deficit hit S14.1 billion in July as a 26.2 percent surge in imports swamped the best showing for exports in nearly three years. 
The deficit for the first seven months of 1984 totals S73.8 billion, already above the 169.4 billion record set in 1983. Analysts are predicting the deficit this year could easily reach 1130 billion despite the clamor from a variety of American industries for protection from: foreign competition.

No good deed is a small deed 
I had a farewell dinner last Thursday with my parents at The Morris Inn, and like any well-mannered young man, I Immediately tried to find out what was happening at the tables around ours. 
That night I was lucky, I had the choice be­tween straining my ears to overhear this old man chattering about his days as a Notre 
Joseph Murphy 
Wishful thinking 
Dame student and straining my eyes staring at this pretty blonde young lady across the res­taurant. Unfortunately, the girl left before I even got my salad, so I had no choice but to digest what this aging alumnus was muttering. 
To my surprise, this "old-timer" was not giving a play-by-play account of a 194 3 foot­ball game, but was talking instead about some minute expet1ence he and a buddy had with a rector. All I heard was something about run­ning away from the priest. My reporter's in­stinct told me to ask him to speak-up or move my table closer to his, but my doctrine of eti­quette prevented me from such a bold stroke. 
By the time my steak arrived, I fully ex­pected to be hearing the names of Knute Rockne and George Gipp being tossed around as though this old man, like all alumni, was a personal friend. 
I even decided against munching on the crackers which our waitress placed at our table:, so I could prove my theory that all alumni consider the football stadium the hub of the campus. Instead I heard the half-bald gentleman spit-out story after story about his daily life at Notre Dame. Behind the sagging eye lids was the fervor of a student full of ad­venture and camaraderie. To me, these stories were neither funny nor significant. To him, these memories were made ofgold. 
I recounted this story only because it started me thinking about my first year here and the memories of the best year of my life. Uke the old man, I too value the little details the most. I thought of my first day and of the two sophomores who rearranged my room so I could tour the campus. I remember the guy down the hall who stayed-up all night typing 
my English paper, so I could study for a test. And I remember the kindness of my teachers and The Freshman Year of Studies when my grandma died unexpectedly. It was not the classes or the games, but the small acts ofcon­cern which sustained me. These actions played-out in a small dorm room instead of a huge stadium mean everything to me; and nothing to you. 
My point is as you begin a new year at Notre Dame promise yourself to care enough to do the little things for others for which no one will pat you on the back. No good deed is a small deed. Let your conscience be your cheering section. 
In school, be competitive enough to reach your potential, but compassionate enough to help others reach theirs. Remember always the symbol of Notre Dame may be the "Dome," but the spirit of Notre Dame is the Grotto, where each candle reflects not merely a prayer, but a light of compassion for "'ll to witness. 
Whatever the future policies ofNotre Dame 
may be, I will never denounce the principles 
upon which this University was founded. I 
know of no better words to set the tone for 
this year than those ofChristian D. Larson who 
wrote: 

Promise yourself to be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace ofmind. To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet. To make all your friends feel that there ts something tn them. To look at the sunny stde ofeverything and make your optimism come true. To thtnk only ofthe best, to work onlyfor the best and expect or.ly the best. To be just as enthustastic about the success of others as 
you are about your own. To forget the mtstakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements ofthe futurf!. To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and gtve every livtng creature y()U .meet a smile. To give so much time to the improvements of yourself that you have no time to crltize others. To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear and too happy 
to permit the presence oftrouble. 

Oh, I'd like to thank my parents and the people at The Morris Inn for a delicious dinner.

Will success spoil Ronald Reagan? 
I offer the great anomaly ofour presidential time. Here is the man who took a minority party, lashed to the Republican corpses of the Barry Goldwater 1964 disaster and the Rich­ard Nixon 1974 Watergate resignation, and got himself elected with it by a landslide, and staged a "Reagan revolution" by the un-
Max Lerner 

The Lerner column 
likeliest revolutionary in the history of the presidency, and is now the odds-on favorite for a second term. 
And here we are, the Greek chorus of com­mentators, lamenting or rejoicing or just puz­zling over his convention triumph and the quantum lead he starts the campaign with, and peering into the next four years to prophesize the kind ofsecond term he will have. 
Note that neither Eisenhower nor Nixon, both elected twice, was an ideological in­novator as Reagan is -which makes the Reagan phenomenon more striking. 
Barry Goldwater, the first ofthis breed, was a political man and senator, and he failed dis­mally 20 years ago. Reagan by contrast came out of nowhere -a sports announcer, actor, corporate emcee at rubber chicken lunchegns. Yet he took the Ideological ball Goldwater had fumbled and won a governor­ship, then a pre!'tidency and now wants to win the big one -as a Republican dynasty founder, handing down an ideological heritage for decades, as did Franklin Roosevelt. 
Most president watchers are asking what he can do in a second term after a first-term suc­cess which even the Democrats don't make too much effort to deny, in the privacy oftheir homes and staff meetings. 
Second terms turn out notoriously to be an­ticlimaxes. They don't yield legislative bonanzas as some first terms do, and they of­ten lead to a miscalculated overkill, as with 
1-larold ~ Fran · 


FOR's party purge effort and Supreme Court packing plan, or to a string of international mishaps as with Ike's U-2 messup and his failed Paris summit. 
And always they are plagued by a recur­rence of the lame-duck disease, with a presi­dent who has lost his capacity to threaten a visitation of hell and high water on any recal­citrant follower. 
We have been told on all sides by the busy convention anchormen and commentators that Reagan must choose between "Ideology" and "pragmatism." But this Is the dreariest either-or fallacy. Reagan mocked it by his con­duct in his first term when he steered clear of either-or and and embraced both. 
There isn't any core quarrel, only one oftac­
tics, between Reagan and the· "theological" 
militants of the New Right, including the 
Southern "C-Span boys" and the Dolan­
Viguerie NCPAC and mail-order baronies and 
fiddoms, and the whole Dallas scene of right 
radical chic. Reagan's heart is with them just 
as his head is with the Baker-Deaver-Dorman 
pragmatists who have run his White House 
staff and are running his campaign somehow 
with only manageable blunders thus far. 

The way I read the entrails is something I will wager the guest house on, if not the estate. Reagan and his evangelicals and his in­tellectual Beachhead Boys will strike a pact which will let him work with his pragmatists to win the election. But then Reagan will strike a pact with his Oval Office pragmatists to let him deepen and thus broaden his appeal in his second term, In order to leave a heritage which his successors in 1988, 1992 and there­after can use for continuing the Reagan Revo­lution. 
It may or may not work. I rather imagine it may come a cropper earlier than Reagan's militants think, for reasons still to be ex­plored. But it is, I suspect, the secret life myth ofthis curiously underestimated man who has upset all the bets but played for lonely and high stakes in history.

Illinois Governor speaks out 
Night ball illegal at Wrigley 
Assodated Press 

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -Illinois Gov. james R. Thompson took his turn at bat Wednesday in the controversy over whether lights should be in­stalled at Wrigley Field if the 
Chicago Cubs make the playoffs. 

And he said the state law on the subject is as clear as a sunny day at Wrigley: there can't be night baseball at the Cubs' home field, the only major league ballpark without lights. 
The Republican governor, des­cribed by spokesman David Fields as a "devout," lifelong Cubs fan, said in a statement that a bill he signed in 1982 in effect forbids night games at Wrigley. 
"With my approval of that bill two years ago, talk today ofplaying ni~t 
TV

on the local level that the colleges 
do nothave much bargaining power. 
One of the best examples of how the new plan adversely affects a school's television money is the plight of Boston College. BC, a 

program that has drawn a lot of national attention in the last couple of years, was all set to make a killing on the major networks because ofits popular quarterback Doug Flutie. The decrease in ABC and CBS money has hurt BC tremendously, however. Even the money they receive from regional telecasts will not keep the Eagles from making little more than half of what they 
made last year. 
Things would have been very 
diJJerent if the CFA and the Big Ten­
Pac 10 coalitions had been able to 
work together and negotiate with 
the networks as one entity. With all 
the colleges together, the group 
would have had the same bargaining 
power as the NCAA had had before. 
Exclusivity would most likely have 
existed, and; with it, top-dollar 
television money. The regional deals 
would have justadded to the wealth. 

However, with the two coalitions at odds and competing against each other on the major networks, the advantage goes to the buyer instead of the seller. The networks have been able to profit immensely from the fact that there is going to be a glut ofcollege football on television. In the past, the supply has been trying to catch up to the demand for college football, and increasing prices were the result. Now the supply has reached, if not surpassed, the demand. Prices would be expected to level or drop, which is exactly what has happened. 
The CFA, which was in favor of 
breaking up the NCAA's control in 
the first place, argues that the 
Supreme Court's ruling is in the best 
interests of college football; 
however others feel that college 
football's future could be in trouble. 
NCAA officials warn that the major 
powers could have a monopoly on 
the television money, recruits and 
national exposure. Others fear that, 
with football games being televised all day, attendance at the games could suffer. 

Whether or not these fears are reasonable, it would appear that the current situation is going to have to change after this season ends. The contracts with ABC, ESPN and CBS are all one-year contracts, something that would indicate that most colleges feel that the situation will be diJJerent a year from now. 
In the meantime, college football fans will not be worrying, just watching and watching and watching....

games -with the aid oftemporary or 
permanent lights -is useless. It's 
simply against the law." 
Thompson also said he won't call 
the state Legislature into special ses­
sion to rewrite the statute. 
"To change the law would require action by the Legislature, which is not scheduled to meet until the third week of November, well after the Cubs have won the World Se­ries," Thompson said. 
The lawThompson cited does not 
specifically forbid lights at Wrigley 
Field. But it sets a noise-pollution 
standard for night games at the park 
that can't realistically be met.

THE BEER DRINKER. 
At Anheuser-Busch, brewing is an art. No one takes more time or goes to more effort or expense than we do in brewing the most popular family of beers in the world. 
We take great pride in this distinction, yet this distinction carries with it certain responsibilities. 
Beer is a beverage to be enjoyed by adults socially-with family and friends at home ... in your clubs, restaurants and at special events. It is also the beverage of moderation, and good judgment should be used when you drink. 

Chairman of the Board and President 
ANHEUSER·BUSCH. INC.  ST. LOUIS 
by residents of the neighborhood 
surrounding the ballpark, who said 
they didn't want to put up with the 
noise and· disturbances of night 
baseball. 
Wrigley Field, builtin 1914, is in a 
residential section on Chicago's 
North Side, with rows of homes 
across the street from the outfield 
fence. 
With the Cubs having a shot at postseason play, baseball officials are trying to find a way to avoid losing television revenue. 
Cubs officials said Tuesday that any decision on installing temporary lights for the playoffs would rest with Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. 

Thankfully, the vast majority of those who consume beer do so in moderation. Nevertheless, anything less than responsible consumption of alcoholic beverages is detrimental to the individual and society. We at Anheuser-Busch certainly are concerned about you, our valued customer. Accordingly, we are dedicated to the support of research, education, and treatment programs a1med at combatting alcoholism and alcohol abuse. 
~~.:,;~ 
The College Football Association has signed a one-year contract with both ABC and ESPN to televise college football games involving member teams. The following figures represent the major points of the agreement. 
Games televised by ABC Games: The network will televise 20 games, beginning September 8. The Saturday afternoon package will be shown during the 3:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. (EST) time period. The Sept. 8 game between Boston College and Ala­bama will be shown in prime time. Two other games -Oklahoma at Pit­tsburgh (Sept. 15) and Notre Dame at Missouri (Sept. 29) -are scheduled for late afternoon. There will be no telecast on Sept. 22. Money: The CFA Television Committee has accepted a rights fee of $12 million in exchange for the network's commitment to televise a minimum of 20 games. Originally, ABC had offered $13 million but would televise only a limited amount of games. 
Games televised by ESPN Games: The cable network will televise a minimum of 15 games reaching approximately 32 million homes. The coverage begins with a Sept. 1 doubleheader (BYU at Pitt, Miami vs. Florida at Tampa). The evening games will begin at 7:45p.m. (EST). Money: The network will pay a rights fee of $9.3 million with the right to show any CFA member once during the season. ESPN may also televise a game later in the season involving a team that has already appeared as long as that team does not exceed its maximum number of appearances (ABC and ESPN combined). 
Appearance and payment information 
A 
team can appear a maximum of four times in a year. This includes ap­pearances on both ABC and ESPN, e.g., if a team has appeared on ABC twice, it cannot appear on ESPN more than twice. 


Twenty-five percent of the gross receipts from the contracts with ABC and ESPN will be placed in a pool to be distributed equally among all63 CFA members that are participating in the plan. The estimated share is approxi­mately $84,500 per member. 

A 
distribution plan for the schools that appear on television will not be decided until ABC determines its programming schedule (a mixture of na­tional, split-national and regional games). Estimated payoffs for the games are as follows: $525,000-$550,000 (ABC national game), $470,000­$490,000 (ABC split-national), $430,000-$450,000 (ESPN).
