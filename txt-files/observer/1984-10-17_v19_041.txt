Student-run Juniper Press promotes 'learning by doing' 
By·BARBARA STEVENS 
News Staff 
lf the adage "learn by doing" is true, then students in Elizabeth Christman's publishing class could soon be experts in the book publishc ing field. Class members select, publish, and market a manuscript. 
Christman first offered the class in 
the spring of 1977, to "introduce 
students in a practical way to what 
goes on in publishing." Since then, 
she ha'i taught the course every fall. 
Students invest their own money and take out a loan to form their publishing company, which the first class named Juniper Press. They elect officers, giving everyone in the class a job. 
Next the class must find a manu­
script that will appeal to Notre 
Dame and South Bend (the potential 
readership for the book), which 
doesn't need much revision, and is 
not longer than l00 pages. 
Once they have chosen their man­uscript, they contract for it, edit, design and produce it. The students also advertise, promote, and dis­tribute the book, account for sales and pay royalties. 
The author's contract covers book rights only and expires after a year. Juniper Press copyrights the authors' names and gives them 10 free copies ofthe finished product. 
This year, Christman's class is publishing a collection of personal ads from The Observer entitled Horse Died: need ride to Boston. 
Two students in the class, Margaret Fosmoe and Julianne Jones compiled the book. Fosmoe also serves as fulfillment manager for the press, whileJones is the copy editor. 
Theresa Kloska, a Saint Mary's senior, is president ofJuniper Press this year. Her job includes oversee­ing and directing the entire process 
of the company. "Each class begins 
as a meeting," said Kloska. "I invite 
each person to stand up and give a 
report on what he or she is doing." 
Kloska says she finds this class to be one of the most rewarding and stimulating she's taken. "We've learned more in this class than we ever could have in a traditional class­room setting," she said. "It's given us an inside look at publishing in a unique way." 
Students claim Christman is the fuel that powers the class. "She's one ofthe few teachers that allowed stu­dents enough freedom and trusted us enough to let us work on our own," Kloska said. "She's more con­cerned that we learn something than with giving us grades." 
Jim Winters, editor-in-chief of Christman's first publishing class, agreed with Kloska's assessment of Christman. "Professor Christman engendered loyalty in the staff and commanded respect," he said. "She was a leader without being heavy­handed about it." 
Christman is well-seasoned in the field of publishing. She worked for more than 20 years as a literary agent at Harold Ober Associates, which handled authors like Agatha Christie, and ). D. Salinger. "She's real sharp," Kloska said. "She's on top ofthings." 
Christman says she enjoyed working as a literary agent, although she never "discovered someone" as she was always hoping to do. "Once in a while I found a flash in the pan," Christman said, "someone who wrote one or two outstanding things then never wrote anything else." 
The idea of teaching a publishing course by having the class actually publish a book first occurred to Christman while she was teaching at DePaul. She taught the course twice during the one-month winter term, but a month wasn't adequate time for the course. "It's terribly hard to even teach it in a semester," said Christman. The DePaul English de­partment didn't seem to think the publishing course fit in with an En­glish curriculum, Christman said. 

When she came to Notre Dame, Christman mentioned the idea to Ronald Weber. then the head of the American Studies Department. He was encouraging, she said. 
Christman first offered the publishing course in the spring of 1977. "The course was very popular because it was such a novelty," she said. "It was just open to seniors, but we still had so many people sign up that we had to have a lottery." 
Christman did let two juniors, Marianne Murphy and Susan Grace, into the class because they were so eager to take it. "As soon as I heard about the course, I knew it would be something I'd be interested in," Murphy said. "Books are an ongoing love for me, and I'll always be in­volved with them." 
The first class published Ralph Mclnery's novella Quick as a Dodo, a stapled book that cost $2. Pam But­terworth, a Saint Mary's student, il­lustrated the book. "She created a lovely, whimsical bird." Zarzana said. Later, Vanguard Publishing company put out a hard-cover edi­tion of Quick as a Dodo, and they used Butterworth's illustrations. 
The class soldQuick as a Dodo in the Notre Dame Bookstore and several other bookstores in South Bend. They held autograph parties and put displays in bookstores to ad­vertise the book. One student donned a bird costume and wore it around campus to publicize the book. Quick as a Dodo returned the students' investments of 125 each and m.1de them a profit of 1200,

Saint Mary's professor says his hobby, ParaPianing, is an easy way to learn to fly 
By MARGIE KERSTEN 
News Staff 
Have you ever dreamed of floating above all the pressures of school? Professor James Paradis' hobby lets him leave his ceramics behind and head off into the clouds. 
Paradis, chairman of Saint Mary's art department, enjoys the fast-evolving sport of ParaPlan­ing. 
A ParaPlane is a parafoil-type parachute propelled by two 1 5 horse engines that rotate oppo­site ofeach other. It takes off and lands like any other aeronautic vehicle, using a tricycle landing gear. There are no wings, just parachutes. 
Paradis flies a newer version of a ParaPlane originally developed by Notre Dame's aerospace engi­neering program some years ago.

The U93-FM hot air balloon 
piloted by Rocky Papndria will

Those interested can schedule 
one-hour passenger flights in the 
balloon by calling 586-35 30. 
Association members will ex­

Paradis encourages all interested 
students to partake in this event. 
Paradis said his ParaPlaning is not affiliated with the College, but in'itead is a new hobby ofhis. He added, "My main interest is helping to promote safety in flying ParaPlanes and to make others aware of the kind offlying 

.that is available in this area."

Take your gripes to the ballot box 
Everybody has an opinion about the president and his administration. Whether they think he is the best thing to come along since Abraham Uncoln or the per­sonification of the antiChrist himself, almost no one is indifferent. And for four years, people loudly assert their opinion. in political clubs, letters to the editor, or conversations over dinner. 
Well, folks, here's your chf:lllce. If you really want to drive your point home to Reagan or Mondale, Nov. 6 is the time. They may not hear your dinner conversations, but they certainly cannot ignore your ballot. 
It's only right to complain about the government, be­cause it is our firm belief that people have a right to criticize and participate in the way their country is run. It is a great privilege, but with every privilege comes a responsibility. And anyone eligible who does not meet that responsibility has no right to gripe come january when the wrong man steps into the White House. 
We prize our freedoms, and we sympathize with those unfortunate countries that are without them. But what good are those 
want to take the time and bother. "I don't know enough about the issues," says one, while another doesn't feel right voting because he is not familiar with his town and state representatives. But it is worth the time to find out. Write home for newspaper clippings on the campaigns. Or register to vote in Indiana. Read the papers or watch the news to get familiar with the issues. Most people find they do have a strong opinion once they understand the basic facts ofan issue. 
Some try to justify their lack ofaction by saying, "In a

But not so in this election. 
The four presidential and vice-presidential candi­dates this year have as broadly divergent views as al­most any ofthis century. It is not a matter ofvoting for a man or woman, or even for an issue, but for fundamen­tally different ideologies. In fact, many political theorists are predicting that, depending on the outcome, this could be the most im­

pool of several tens of millions of votes, I really don't think one more or less will make any difference." But of course, when millions ofpeople think that way and end up not voting, it can make a decisive difference. 
Another common excuse for not voting is that "The candidates sound exactly the same -they both take the middle view on everything." They both want to decrease taxes and cut the federal deficit, curb the arms race, help cities and decrease poverty, and improve foreign relations. They are both "personally opposed"

electrical property of a scene," said Wasowski, an assistant professor of earth science. 
The Challenger passed over this area Oct. 6 and Oct. I 0. But because of technical problems, Oct. 6's radar images did not turn out, and there is a possibility that Oct. I O's were not suc(.:essful either. "We're still waiting to find out," said Wasowski. 
Data from the Challenger will serve many purposes, said W asowski. "We hope to be able to draw a numerical content of the brightness of a soil as shown on the radar in relationship to the moisture content of the soil. This will be valuable for studying agricultural areas in terms of what types ofcrops are growing and what treatment they will need. This will ultimately help the farmers in the area." 
Data from this experiment could also lead to the discovery of petro­leum reserves, buried streams in dey areas, and fault lines that geologists have not yet charted. 
Wasowski plans to work with the space shuttle program in the future. He said, "There is a good possibility NASA will fly this experiment again and I definitely expect to expand on it." 
Wasowski gained much of his ex­perience for this mission while pursuing his Ph.D at U.C.L.A. and working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.

When the space shuttle Chal­lenger flew over the South Bend area last week, Notre Dame Professor Fa­ther Ronald Wasowski was part of the crew. 
Wasowski didn't orbit the earth with the astronauts, but as part ofthe mission's ground crew participated in an experiment using NASA's orbi­tal imaging radar system. He describes radar imaging as "a pic­toral recording using radar wavelengths," as opposed to pho­tography which uses visible light to record images. 
With the help of undergraduate researcher Kevin Corbley, Wasowski aided the mission by mea­suring the soil of 4 5 local fields and videotaping the surrounding landscape.

which the company voted to leave 
for the next class. 
"We wanted the next class to have 
more to work with so hopefully they 
could do something even better," 
said Zarzanna. 
After Quick as a Dodo, Juniper Press published: Cleats, a football novella; Virgins and Martyrs, a col­lection of three short stor!es and a novella by Delores Frese, a Notre Dame English professor; Abecedary: an Antic Alphabet, a collection of poems by Ralph Mcinerny, director of the Medieval Institute; Molarity: on theRoad toSelling Out, cartoons by Michael Molinelli; Molarity; Don't Make a Right, also by Molinelli; Tbe Frozen Maiden of Calpumia by Mcinerny; and Payable Upon Return, a play by Mi­chael Varga. All of these have been bound editions. 
Molarity was the most profitable book that Juniper Press has pub­lished so far. The group that produced Molarity made a profit of three times what they had invested in the company. 
Molinelli said having his cartoons 
published was a great asset to him. 
"Having them published has given 
me validity," he said. "The books 
were the most substantial thing I 
could show." 
He adds that the books gave him a 
sense of permanence. "People 
throw out their newspapers," he 
said. "But they don't usually throw 
out books." · 
Molinelli has temporarily set his cartooning skills aside and is working with an architecture firm. However, he has developed a new cartoon for possible syndication and is waiting to hear from the newspa­per to which he submitted it. 
One of Christman's goals for the publishing class is to teach students that book publishing is a matter of balancing literacy quality with marketability. "Publishing is a busi­ness, not a humanities project," she said, adding that students in her class learn some very important business lessons, like getting arrangements in writing, sticking to a schedule, and getting along with employees. 
"The class taught me a lot of the practicalities of book publishing," said Winters. "We picked up practi­cal business knowledge and learned about the money structure." 
In addition to running their com· pany, students in the class use the textbook Book Publishing, go on field trips to various publishing com­panies, and host guest speakers. 
Some of Christman's students have gone on to work for publishing firms. Others have gone into diJJer­ent fields but enjoyed their expo­sure to the world of publishing, she said. 
"It's exciting to be a publisher and see the whole process through," said Christman. "We start with nothing and go all the way to selling a book in the bookstore." 
Winters agreed that Christman's unique class has been a success. "She took a risk starting such an unusual class," he said. "And she pulled it 
off."

Delay of the trial's opening was already assured because no attorneys appeared to rep­resent the defense. Delano Harrison, part ofa seven-member team of Jamaican attorneys which represented the accused in a prelimi­nary inquiry, said the defendants had failed to raise money to pay for their defense. 
Nedd said he would seek to appoint the same seven-Jamaican team for the trial. Under Grenada law, murder defendants unable to pay attorneys can receive court-appointed representation that will be paid for by the court. 


Industry output decline ends 21-month increase 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The nation's in­dustrial production declined a sharp 
0.6 percent last month, breaking a string of 21 consecutive monthly ad­vances, but analysts attributed half the decline to the auto strike and said the downturn does not signal the start ofanother recession. 
lbe report yesterday by the Federal Reserve Board said output at 
U.S. factories, mines and utilities slipped back in September after a tiny 0.1 percent August increase. 
It marked the first production set­back since a similar 0.6 percent decline in November 1982, the low point of ·the last recession. Since then, output has advanced steadily, with monthly gains as high as 2.3 percent. 
Most analysts called the setback temporary, blaming half the drop on the short strike against General Motors Corp. They predicted output would resume its upward climb in October, although at a more modest 
pace than earlier. 

"A one-month decline in this in­dex does not signal a recession," said Robert Ortner, chief economist for the Commerce Department. "This economy does not resemble anyth­ing like a business-cycle peak. It resembles the middle stages of ex­pansion." 
Economists cited declines in in­terest rates and figures showing a rebound in consumer spending to support their optimism about future growth. Several large banks an­nounced yesterday they were lowering their prime lending rate from 12.75 percent to 12.5 percent. 
In other developments yesterday, the British pound fell below $1.20 for the first time as the dollar finished mixed on world currency markets. Sterling dipped to $1. 1980 before closing at $1.2045 in London, still a record low and down from $1.2082 late Monday. The dollar set new highs against the currencies of Sweden and Norway and rose to a 22-month high against the Japanese yen. 
The number ofstates with double­digit unemployment in August fell to four from 12 a year earlier, the Labor Department said.

Milton Friedman stable after mild heart attack 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS -Nobel Laureate Economist Milton Friedman suf­fered a mild heart attack yesterday and was hospitalized in stable condi­tion at Tulane Medical Center's Car­diac Care Unit, officials said. 
Friedman, 72, was resting comfortably and will be going home to San Francisco in a few days, said Dr. Antonio Quiroz. 
The economist was in town to help dedicate the new A.B. Freeman School of Business at Tulane. Fried­man's son, David, is a visiting profes­sor there. 
A conservative economist, Friedman is professor emeritus at the University ofChicago, a fellow at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University and has advised President Reagan and other world leaders on economic policy. 
Friedman, a native of Brooklyn, N.Y., won the Nobel Prize in 1976. His major theory opposes traditional Keynesian thought, by saying gov­ernment should stay out of business and allow the free market forces to solve most economic problems. 
He also has suggested a negative income tax, where people who earn under a certain amount would get cash from the government. 

Foreign-born residents are largely new arrivals 
half the newcomers from Latin America arrived from Mexico. 
Other nations making sizable con­tributions to the U.S. population in that period included Vietnam, the Philippines, India, Iran, China, jamaica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Colombia. 
The highest share of recent ar­rivals came from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam in the wake of the war in Southeast Asia. 
Fully 97 percent of the 54,881 Laotians in the United States came here between 1975 and 1980. For the 2 31, 120 Vietnam-born resi­dents, 90.5 percent arrived in that five years, and the figure was 90.9 percent of the 20,175 Cambodians in this country. 
Mexico is the country listed as home by the largest group of foreign-born residents, 2,199,221, and of those one-third came to this country between 1975 and 1980, the Census found. 
A distant second on the list of homelands was Germany, with 849,384 U.S. residents listing that nation as home. However, most of them have been have been in this country 20 years or more, with only 6 percent arriving since 1975. 
Other nations heavily represented in the U.S. foreign-born population include Canada, 842,859; Italy, 831,922 and Cuba, 607,814. 
Overall the Census Bureau study concluded that foreign-born resi­dents earn slightly less than persons born in this country; are less likely to have finished high school -although they have about the same share of college graduates -and have about the same share of professionals as native-born persons. 
Both the foreign-born and native populations had about 16 percent ~ollege graduates, on average, the study said. 
However, 66 percent of U.S. resi­dents born in India had degrees, while 60 percent of the Taiwanese and 49 percent of Nigerians coming to this country had finished college. 
Persons born in the United States average 68 percent high school graduates, compared to 53 percent of arrivals from outside the country. But again it varied widely, from 97 percent of arriving Nigerians having diplomas, to only 21 percent of Mexicans. 
Median household income for the foreign-born was S14,588, compared to Sl7,010 for the U.S. born.

Two gunmen demand 'Wizard of Oz' slippers 
~ted Press 
SAN FRANCISCO · Two gunmen · instead of one wicked witt.:h · made off with a pair of ruby slippers sup­posedly used in the 1939 cla.<isic movie "The Wizard of Oz," police said yesterday. 
Ted Smith told officers two men came into his novelty store, Humpty-Dumpty & Sons, pulled a gun and demanded that he place the size 6 shoes worn byJudy Garland in the movie in an empty cardboard box. 
Smith said he took the slippers, which police said he valued at S20,000, from their place of honor on a red and white gingham pillow in a locked cabinet and put them in the box. 
"Of all the things for them to take," lamented Smith, a profes­sional clown who said he bought the shoes ten years ago from a man who had worked in the wardrobe depart· ment at MGM studios. Smith declined to say what he paid for the red-sequined, leather-lined, bowed slippers with the label, "Innes Shoe Co. Hollywood-Pasadena-Los An· geles," but said he was offering a Sl0,000 reward for their return. 

LOS ANGELES -An FBI agent charged with espionage actually was seeking to ingratiate himself with a Soviet couple so he could investi· gate them, his attorney said yester­day.

Smith said the slippers, which also had Garland's name in them, were one of six pair made for her to wear in the 1939 MGM film. 
In her book, "The Making of the Wizard of Oz," Aljean Harmetz, a correspondent for The New York Times, noted that Garland wore a size 4B shoe and her stand-in wore a size 6. Mervyn LeRoy, producer of the film, is quoted as saying that five or 10 pairs ofthe slippers were made in both sizes. 
The book also noted that a pair of shoes purportedly worn in the pro­duction were auctioned for S 1 5,000 in 1970 to an unidentified Southern California man. 
Within 48 hours of that sale, a con­troversy erupted over their authen­ticity. The book also said that at least two pairs had been stolen from the wardrobe department several months before the auction. 
Smith said the thieves obviously were not "Wizard of Oz" fans. "I think they're Wizard ofOz haters be· cause anybody who would do anyth­ing like this could never appreciate the Wizard of Oz for all its good­ness," he said. "They must be on the wicked witch's side."

Jokesmiths at O'Laughlin tonight Springsteen imitators 
Special to The Observer 
"T"1he Budweiser Comedy Shop Tour, a series ofperformances by 1 three ofAmerica's hottest young comedians, opens at 8 ~onight in Saint Mary's O'Laughlin Auditorium. 
The performance will feature Jeff Altman, Elayne Bossler, and · Richard Lewis, who have all made appearances on such shows as The David Letterman Show, the Tonight Show, and Merv Griffin. 
Altman can be characterized by the opening ofhis act: out walks a straightforward, all-American-looking young man who greets his audience politely, and then slams his head on a bar stool, knocking himself"out." Altman's style is unique, and a combination of comedy, impressions, and physical comedy affords him a versatility that makes him genuinely interesting and funny. Many ofhis routines center around characters he has created; his prize fighter, Leonard Moon, is a da-,sic. 
Boosler is the kind ofcomedian you laugh with rather than at. At age 26, with her Farrah Fawcett fluff and her Bain de Solei] tan, she does not make jokes about how ugly and old she is. Instead, she talks about things like how tough the dating game is, how men do numbers on women, and how women do numbers on men. Boosler, like Woody Allen, has an uncanny skill for creating humor from what many consider to be mundane. 
Compared to most lightweight jokesmiths of the '80s, Richard Lewis is an unexpected powerhouse ofironic wit and comedic tension. He paces a stage ceaselessly throughout his routine, walking and talking and palming down his hair as though this were a volatile visit with his shrink. The material pours out ofhim confession-style, and not a word sounds rehearsed or manipulated for laughs, yet the laughs are there. 
A Pre-Comedy show at 7:45p.m. will feature Notre Dame's and Saint Mary's' funniest people, the winners ofAmateur Night at Senior Bar: Bernie Pelligrino, Ruth Kaiser, Kevin Flynn and Ave Green. 
Tickets for the performance, which is sponsored by Campus Entertainment, are on sale for S4 at the O'Laughlin Auditorium Box Office, the Student Activities Board Record Store, the Century Center. or at the door.

The wall, although new to Notre Dame is an adaptation ofa famous Canadian surgeon's college days in Detroit. Bethune was a studem in the days when Socialist ideals were still new and promised hope for global peace. The medical student invited his capitolist scheptic friends to his small downtown Detroit apartment at least once a week. They would discuss books they had read on the subject of Socialism and tell of the-ir dreams of a global brotherhood without cut throat capitalist ideals. 
Although Bethune did not neces­sarily agree with all of their argu­ments, he did enjoy the company of these people. He wanted to record their presence, but did not want to put their futures in jeopardy.

a genuine fraud 

by Pat Beaudine 
features staff writer 

omething quite unexpected is happening in the music industrySright now. An album that was destined to die, and a group that was going nowhere fast have both been revived and thrown into the spotlight by the newest force in music: cable television. 
The group is none other than John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band. The revival the band is experiencing is due to the recent re-release ofthe motion pictureEddie and tb~ Cruisers exclusively on cable T.V. A year ago the band would never have guessed this amount ofpopularity to be possible. After all, the soundtrack they recorded for the picture was a critical bomb and likewise the movie earned poor reviews. 
But, just as the band committed to tour the Northeast, as they've done for the past ten years, the bubble exploded. That's where cable came in. As Cafferty notes, "We were playing in Connecticut, and someone came backstage and said, 'Did you know that you sold 17,000 copies of the record in the past four days?'. I just couldn't believe it." 
Anyone who purchases this album can understand Cafferty's disbelief. How could such a good song as "On the Dark Side" go wholly unanswered on the rest ofthe lp? And how can a serious rock group be intent in simply imitating Bruce Springsteen? The parallel wouldn't be so blatant ifCafferty and the band established their own seperate identity while playing high quality music. The immitation would then come off as a first rate tribute to The Boss, rather than a cheap ripoff, as it has done. 
Other recording artist have done it. For example, John Cougar Mellencamp's last album sounded like the Rolling Stones, but he still maintained his image and the music never suffered. In Cafferty's instance, the only time he ever reaches into his true emotions is on the slow, moody "Tender Years". Possibly a second single from the album, its catchy chorus follows: 
Ob tender years Won'tyou wash away my tears How I wish you were near Please don't go, tender years. 

But then again, life's fleeting youth and all its personal dramas and crises are perfectly handled by Springsteen himself, so even at Cafferty's best he doesn't have much to offer. In other words, they'd be better being called a "Springsteen Covers Band" rather than the Beaver Brown Band -that is ultimately what they are. 
Ifyou can imagine, it gets worse_ "Season in Hell (Fire Suite)" is a muddled mess -a heavy drudge ofguitars and rough vocals. And "Those Oldies But Goodi~s (Remind Me ofYou)" fares no better. The song features the album's producer, Kenny Vance, on lead vocals, but instead ofoffering a fresher approach to rock, he delivers an awkward, whiny salute to fifties music. A cover of "Runaround Sue" further evokes that era; however, on the lp the song seems hopeles~ly out of~lace and can'.t ma~ch _the ori8i:nal in terms ofinterpretation or dehvery. Cafferty s vmce IS so buned by the mix that it only rarely rises above the din. 
The future could be brighter for this band at the moment. Without the lucky break that cable television has offered, John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band would still be stuck with a big failure on their hands. The band will have to overcome their Springsteen fascination, or they will never establish their own identity, nor take away any of the Boss' niche in the market. Therefore, these truly are tender years for this band because the fleeting success that they bring are really going to have Cafferty singing ... 
Please don't go, tender years.

Dare Americans control the immigration flood? 

On the subject of immigration, let's have first principles first. I begin with the proposi­tion that every nation has the right and duty to control the influx ofpeople across its borders over the long-run future. 
I have a second related proposition. No na­tion that throws up its hands, yielding to 
Max Lerner 
The Lerner column 
short-range political pressures and surrender­ing that right of control, is likely to hold for long the fabric of its basic institutions to­gether. 
America is a nation ofimmigrants. As it hap­pened I came to America with my family from Russia when I was 4 and, in the early years, we learned that America is the ultimate promise, but it is also hard ground for all immigrant families. I can understand the passion of the illegals · from Mexico and other Latin Ameri­can countries, from the Caribbean, from wherever · who brave dangers and hardships to get to American soil and to stay on it. 

The flood of illegals is too protean a mon­ster even to estimate. Professor Lawrence Fuchs of Brandeis University headed the first­rate Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy, with Father Theodore Hesburgh of Notre Dame as its chairman. Its research fur­nishes the base for the Simpson-Mazzoli bill. Fuchs turns aside most estimates, saying: "Gossip about gossip is still gossip." 
Yet the problem is there, with an isness and a thereness that dwarf the gaps between the estimates. (Given the low estimate of 2 mil­lion and the high of7, the median 4.5 seems a possible guess.) The mounting torrent of il­legals, along with their new births, probably accounts for from a quarter to a half of the 
annual population increase of America as a 
whole. 

I suspect that most of the Hispanics, whose militant professional leaders rail at the bill, are basically for it. They have their new home to protect against fresh invasions. They might well prefer "amnesty" provisions ending with those who entered before 1980, as in the Sen­ate version, rather than the softer House ver­sion of 1982. But amnesty of some sort there must be, and a complex phased process of legitimizing those who apply for permanent residence. Otherwise America will be creat­ing a jobless, seething, permanent underclass ofillegals. 
Some sort of"sanctions" there must also be. Since Americans won't support a vast army of border and port police with stockades, the way to close off the flood is by penalizing employers who hire undocumented illegals. 
Americans are frightened ofanything smell­ing of an I.D. card, which means that identifi­
cation will be an enforcement headache. But a 
continuance ofthe flood will be a hemorrhage 
for the social organism. 

It is one of those cases where every year a 
failure to act escalates the mess, getting the 
nation deeper into the qu.agmire and making 
future efforts to get out ofit prohibitive. 
Who can blame the migrants themselves, 
who see only a border to cross that will move 
them · in a day or a week of hiding, dodging, 
scrambling -from wretched penury to salva­
tion, in a staggering upward mobility? 
Yet the stakes for America as a cohesive na­
tion are too high, and the dangers are too great 
of an overburdening ofAmerican society, and 
a further fragmenting of it along ethnic divid· 
ing lines. Americans have too long allowed 
history to happen to them by the accident of 
geography and the failure ofresolve in dealing 
with it.

P.O. Box Q 
Grow up, read the Constitution, stop it! 

DearEditor: 
I am sure that the vast majority ofour Notre 
Dame community is respectful of the rights of 
individuals and organizations to post an­
nouncements on the bulletin boards on 
campus which are designated for that pur­
pose. But some do not exhibit this respect; I 
am directing this letter to them. 
Recently, a number of students from the 
Democratic Socialists of America attempted 
to advertise the appearance ofa guest speaker, 
Mr. Jeremy Karpatkin of the national office of 
that group. Several times posters were placed 
in O'Shaugnessy Hall and in other places; each 
time the posters disappeared within 24 hours. 
I find it distressing that some person or per­
sons obviously felt compelled to remove 
them. 

I am sure that DSA is not the most popular group on campus, but they are a legitimate group, chaired nationally by Michael Har­rington and committed to operating within the political processes of this nation. I could understand the motivations of someone who felt compelled to destroy pamphlets advertis­ing Nazi rallies or the like (even ifI disagreed with the view that even Nazis or Terrorists deserve the right to be heard). But the case here is not so complicated. This is why I do not understand why, for the third straight year, someone or some group continues to destroy DSA material almost as soon as the thumb tacks have been put in place. 
To those responsible, ifthey are reading or even know how to read: Grow up, read the constitution, stop it!

Releasing our pent UP. anxiety 

DearEditor: 
So, we booed Gerry Faust off the field on Saturday. Feels good to get all that pent-up anxiety out of the system. "The Bum, if he can't give us a winning football team, then the hell with him! Throw the guy out!" That's bet­ter. 
Yeah, Gerry Faust. When he first came here, we all loved him. He ate pizza with us and even threw the frisbee around with us. We said to ourselves (if "we" were here yet), "Wow, what a guy!." Has he become a differ­ent man? 
TI1e man we used to like was photographed 

crying as he left the field Saturday because we 
were booing him, to put it mildly. We used to 
like him because he was a nice guy. Now we 
don't like him because he can't produce a win­
ning football team. Granted, he's still a nice 
guy, but we don't want to bring that up to 
complicate things. Better just to say he's a 
"bum," and forget the past. 

All this makes sense, though. Faust should 
have understood it before he accepted The 
Position. This is Notre Dame. We win at foot­
ball here. just like we win in the real world 
when we get out there. When we scream "WE 
· ARE · NO" and revel the thought that "God 
made Notre Dame 1," we're reaffirming our 
rights to be Number One in the real world. 
Poor Gerry, he didn't know what he was getting into. He didn't realize that if he screwed up a football season or two (or three, or four) that he just would not be losing foot­ball games but morally offending the whole damn campus. He's a "Loser." That's why we booed him off the field. Hell, if we associate with losers, the damned disease may rub off on us! Then where would we be? 
But it's the same old story. We've heard it before. It's a Notre Dame standard: "Nice guys finish last." Well, I'm not Catholic so I really shouldn't bring up the initials of any other fa. mous nice guys (you know, like ~·J. C.?"). But you know who I'm talking about. He was booed offthe field on Saturday. 
Doesn't it feel good to get these things out of your system? It does me wonders ...

People make Notre Dame special 
DearEditor: 
I am writing you in regard to Carol Brown's column tided, "Notre Dame will always remain a special place." In this essay the over­zealous author makes a hint of some kind of religious revelation. However, she focuses on some extreme image of Notre Dame as being embodied in the golden statue of the Virgin Mary on top of the dome. Instead of being enthralled by the meaning behind the image of Mary, Brown seems simply to worship the image. 
The core and character of Notre Dame is not the image ofOur Lady. It -and I'm sorry to -open your eyes -is merely the name of the University and its heavenly patron. The core and character of Notre Dame are the people who study, play and work here. These people make it a special place because of their per­sonalities, achievements, attitudes, and ac­tions. People make up the core of Notre Dame, NOT an image. The image of Notre 
Dame takes on an even more unique identity 
in the way it teaches-with a moderate amount 
of success · people to relate to others after 
they graduate. The attitudes, knowledge, and 
ideals learned while at Notre Dame seem to 
stay with the alumni to a greater, or lesser, ex­
tent throughout their lives. People give Notre 
Dame its spirit and mystique, not a golden 
statue on top ofa golden dome! 
The awe Brown displays for Notre Dame is 
as bad as the overzealous alumni who invade 
the campus in their solid green slacks and 
plaid jackets. Yet, the overabundant ex­
uberance ofa few alumni on a given weekend 
is not nearly as reproachful as the attitude dis­
played in Brown's essay. Sure, Notre Dame is a 
great place to be but it does have its faults· it is 
a human instutution and subject to human er­
ror. 

Being at Notre Dame is not the cure-all and 
end-all of life's problems. Our experience at 
NO can only give us tools to use in dealing 
with the difficulties of life.

Supporting Israeli violence is a mistake 
DearEditor: 

First of all, let me apologize to anyone whom I offended with my article on U.S. sup­port of Israel in the Oct. 3 issue of The Obseroer. My intentions were not to invoke anti-semitic emotions but, rather, to suggest a reason as to why Americans. keep getting killed in Lebanon. A friend of ~ine, who hap­pens to be ofjewish heritage, asked me why I didn't like Jewish people and, further, why I felt he had a "big mouth." I realized then that my comments were not having the effect I in­tended. For the record, I would like to say that I have no bias towards or prejudice against any people ofany particular creed or heritage. And for the remarks I made that were offen­sive to anyone, specifically jewish people, I submit my regret. 
In light ofIsraeli Prime Minister Pere's visit to the White House, I feel that the question of American support ofIsrael should be raised. It seems to me that many of us don't really have adequate knowledge of the history and prin­ciples behind this alliance. With the foreign policy debate between Reagan and Mondale coming up, maybe someone could focus on the reason for our support of Israel. I think ­you'll find that these reasons will not be dis­cussed, however. To continue supporting a government that uses violence as a means to an end is a mistake. 
Michael McCabe Senior 
Using social prejudice is in poor taste 
DearEditor: 
Being somewhat of a shy person myself, I 
would like to respond to the article, written 
by Cat Francis, which appeared in last Wed­
nesday's issue ofThe Observer. 
It seems as ifFrancis has quite a misconcep­
tion of the nature ofshy people. She portrayed 
the typical shy person as a schizophrenic 
mess, preoccupied with paranoid fears of 
being rebuked by cashiers and librarians, con­
tinually getting lost in the crowd, repeatedly 
being trampled by others and holding con­
versations with ketchup dispensers for lack of 
any outlets of friendship. As is obvious, shy 
people are not at all this way. They are merely 
people who have insecurities like everyone 
else. However, unlike the norm, shy people 
deal with these insecurities by remaining 
somewhat quiet in order to avoid possible 
rejections and humiliations. It must be 
pointed out that this is no more maladaptive 
than the extrovert's method of dealing with 
insecurities by making herself quite visible 
and hence reducing the chance of any out­
right rejection, or than the compromise of 
these two defense mechansims exerted by the 
average individual. 
Granted, it may be the case that Francis was 
simply attempting to write a humorous 
column (in which case she should seek the 
advice of someone with a better sense of 
humour, such as Ernie Bushmiller ). Still, it 
should be obvious to any but the dullest of 
people that it is in poor taste to use social 
prejudices as the media for jokes.

A pathetic and humiliating spectacle 
DearEditor: 
Looking pathetic on the field is only part of the Irish decline. 
Notre Dame sports have reached an aU-time low when a sophomore football player goes on national television before a big game to say how he's going to teach the other team (Miami) a lesson and ends up with nothing but egg on his face. 
Shame on him but, mostly, shame on his coaches for allowing such a pathetic and humiliating spectacle to ever take place.

how they beat people. Defense is the 
name of the game." 
The Zips' defense is anchored by 
goalk~eper Sean Burke, who has re­
corded seven shutouts and has a 
goals-against-average of 0.69 this 
fall. Burke relies on sweeper Shaun 
Pendleton for assistance on the back 
line. 
Notre Dame will not shy away from Akron's formidable defense, Grace said. Rather, the Irish will be aggressive on offense. 
"We're not going to sit back," Grace explains. "We're going to take an approach just like we have every game. We're going to go out and at­tack and score and try to do what we can." 
Leading the Irish attack will be a 
c:trong forward line, which has 
several players who have come 
througb with goals in big games for 
the Irish this season. 
Most notably, senior tri-captain Rich Herdegen has scored against each of Notre Dame's toughest op­ponents: Indiana, St. Louis, Michigan State and Marquette. Herdegen has 11 goals this season and 23 points. 
Just ahead of Herdegen on the Irish scoring list is sophomore Pat Szanto, who has 1 0 goals and 26 points this season. Junior striker Dave Miles is third in scoring for the team with 16 points, and freshman 
John Fossella has 10. 
The Irish will field their own strong defense this afternoon to keep the Zips away from the goal. Junior Mark Steranka is expected to start in the net. Steranka has compiled a 9-2-2 record this year with three shutouts and a goals­against-average of 1.08.

Rejects women judges 



Hagler threatens not to fight 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -If three women are appointed to judge the Marvelous Marvin Hagler-Mustafa Hamsho mid­dleweight title match Friday night, "There will be no fight," Pat Petronelli, Hagler's co-manager said yesterday. 
"The champ doesn't want it," said Petronelli. "We don't want it." 
ChairmanJohn Branca ofthe New York State Athletic Commission said it was a possibility that Carol Castel­lano and Eva Shain of New York and Carol Polis of Philadelphia could be appointed to judge the scheduled 15-round fight Friday night at Madison Square Garden. 
It also is possible that only one or two of the three will be named as judges, but that at least one will be appointed, said Branca. He said one or two of the women could be ap­pointed to judge the Mike McCallum-Sean Mannion bout for the vacant WBA junior mid­dleweight title, which is on the same card. 
The three women are certified by the World Boxing Association and all have worked championship fights. 
"I think they're very qualified," said Branca. 
"We're not buying that," Petronelli said. "This is a man's sport. This is a man's game. The top bouts should be judged by men." 
"Whoever he (Branca) appoints, I will respect their judgment," Hamsho said in a statement issued in the challenger's name by Irving Rudd, publicist for Bob Arum's Top Rank, Inc., the promoter of the fight.

Other defenders the Irish will rely on today are senior tri-captain Dominick Driano at sweeper and Jock Mutschler and Steve Lowney at the wingbacks. At midfield, Chris Telk, Stuart MacDonald, Martin Man­gialardi, Eric Evans and Tom Daley should share most of the playing time. 
Notre Dame has enough talent to give Akron an excellent game if it plays as well as it is able. '!be only question in Grace's mind is whether his players finally will show their true potential by overcoming some attitude problems. He says perhaps now that the pressure ofgetting into the NCAA Tournament is gone, the team will play better. 
"We're going into Akron with nothing to lose and a lot of respec­tability to gain in the game," Grace says. "We're going to give them a heck of a game. We're going to play some ball." 
The time has come, according to Grace, for the Irish to prove that they can, indeed, play competively with the best t~ams in collegiate soc­cer. If the fans come out for this im­portant matchup, as the Irish coach hopes they will, Notre Dame will have a perfect opportunity to defeat Akron for the first time in the history of this series.

"I think Hagler is plain worried, 
and sex should have no place in the 
appointment of judges." 
Branca said Petronelli and his brother, Goody, co-manager and Hagler's train~r. and Hamsho's manager AI Certo will have a say in the naming of the judges and non­scoring referee at the rules meeting tomorrow. The officials will be ap­pointed at that time. 
Alberto Alomane of Panama, th~ WBA's international coordinator, will attend the rules meeting and will serve as WBA supervisor for the fight. 
The World Boxing Council, which recognized Hagler as cham­pion and joins the WBA in ranking Hamsho the No. I contender, will send observers to the fight. 
Jose Sulaiman, president of the WBC, has said his organization will not sanction the bout as a champion­ship match if it is scheduled for 15 rounds. The WBC has a 12-round limit for title bouts. 
It is possible the WBC, meeting in convention at Montreal from today to Saturday, will withdraw title recognition from Hagler if he goes through with the fight under the 15­round limit, which is recognized by theWBA. 
"The contract calls for 15 rounds," said Arum. 
There is a New York State Athletic Commission rule stating all title fights must be for 15 rounds. Marvin Kohn, a deputy commissioner, ex· plained that if the promoter and all parties concerned ask for a 12-round limit, the commission might grant permission. It has been done twice in the past for WBC title bouts. 

Should the WBC move to strip Hagler of title recognition, the ac­tion is not expected to take place or be announced before Saturday.

Field hockey team wins two, loses one 
By KEVIN HERBERT 
Sports Writer 
lbe Notre Dame field hockey team has gone 2-1 in its most recent 
outings, upping its record to 6-4-1 in the process. In the Lake Forest 
Invitational last Saturday, the Irish beat Iowa Wesleyan and Lake For­
est, 6-0 and 4-1, respectively. 
On Monday the Irish did not fare as well, losing 2-1 to Ball State in 
Muncie, Ind. 
Notre Dame effectively dominated Iowa Wesleyan. As the Irish 
offense was racking up six goals, the defense was allowing only four 
Iowa Wesleyan shots on goal. 
"We were simply a more talented team," said Notre Dame coach 
Jill Lindenfeld of the blowout. "We had excellent execution and 
played very well as a team." 
Sophomore Corinne DiGiacomo and freshman Benet DeBerry each 
scored two goals for the Irish against Iowa Wesleyan, while Regina 
Degan and Megan McGlinn notched one goal apiece. 
In its second game on Saturday, Notre Dame defeated Lake Forest 
with a three-goal outburst within a 10-minute span in the second 
half. The two teams were deadlocked at one midway through the 
second half when perhaps the most important play of the game oc­
curred. 
Lake Forest scored an apparent goal which would have put it 
ahead, 2-1, with only a quarter of the game remaining. That goal, 
however, was disallowed because ofan offside call. Soon after, Notre 
Dame exploded for its decisive barrage. 
The Irish recorded 24 shots on goal in the game. Melissa Summer 
scored two goals as juniors Beth Bisignano and Christina Weinmann 
each added one to the Notre Dame cause. 
Despite the fact that Lake Forest played a very physical game, the 
Irish were able to maintain their poise and play their game, some­
thing which made Lindenfeld happy. 
''I'm very pleased with the way we won," said the Irish coach. "We did not succumb to their tactics. Instead, we maintained our com­posure and played our game." 
Junior goaltender Patti Gallagher recorded 16 saves in going the distance for Notre Dame. 
Things did not go as well on Monday, as Ball State topped the Irish by a 2-1 margin. Notre Dame got off to an early 1-0 lead when DiGiacomo scored less than I 5 minutes into the game. 
After that, however, Ball State took control of the game. The Car­dinal defense held the Irish to only five shots on goal from then on. Meanwhile, the Ball State offense was registering 11 shots and two goals against Gallagher. 
"Ball State is a very strong team," remarked Lindenfeld. "They denied us the ball, hence allowing us very few shots on goal. Their team deserves a lot ofcredit." 
Notre Dame travels to Ann Arbor, Mich., today for a 4 p.m. game with the University of Michigan.

Returns after two years 
Mauch named new Angels manager 
A.ssoclated Press 
ANAHEIM, Calif. -Gene Mauch, who resigned as the manager of the California Angels two years ago, will return to the position in 1985, the American League team announced at a news conference yesterday. 
Mauch quit shortly after the An­gels lost the AL Championship Series to the Milwaukee Brewers in 1982. California won the first two games of the series but lost the next three. 
John McNamara, hired to replace Mauch, announced last week that he would not return as the Angels' manager next year. McNamara is considered the top candidate for the vacant Boston Red Sox managing po­sition. 
Mauch, who turns 59 next month, has been the Angels' director of player personnel since Sept. 17, 1983. He has been a big-league manager for 22 years and ranks among the top 1 0 skippers in major league history in years of service, total games and victories. 
Mauch was first appointed as the Angels' manager on May 28, 1981, to succeedJim Fregosi. California had a 22-25 record when Mauch took over and finished the strike­interrupted campaign with a 51-59 mark. 
In 1982, the Angels won their second-ever AL West title with a 93­69 record, best in their 24-year his­tory, before losing to the Brewers in the playoffs. 
Under McNamara, the Angels

Irish volleyball team travels to Purdue 
By ERIC SCHEUERMANN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's volleyball team has revenge on its mind tonight as it travels to West Lafayette, Ind., to take on the Boiler­makers of Purdue University. 
The Boilers embarrassed the Irish in the season opener for both teams by scores of 15-12, 1 S-6, 1 5-8. Since then, Notre Dame has played .500 volleyball, and enters tonight's game with a 7-8 record overall. 
A tough loss last week to North Star Conference rival Loyola dropped the team's conference record to 3-1, and greatly hurt its chances for the conference championship. But the Irish need to bounce back this week against the Boilers. 
"It's up to the girls now to decide whether they want to do it and get ready for Purdue," says Notre Dame head coach Art Lambert. "Purdue is a top-ranked team and a hard team to prepare for because they have a lot of different looks. They are a very tall team, but they do lack quickness." 
The Irish did not exploit that weakness of Purdue in their first meeting, and the Boilers were able to use their height at the net to dominate the match. This time around, the Irish will have to make the Boilers move around the court a little faster. 
"We need to maintain a consistent level instead of fluctuating," says Assistant Coach Renee DeGraff. "We need to gain consistency as a team and get unified." 
If Notre Dame can accomplish this, its worst battle is over. Once the Irish stop beating themselves with inconsistency, they will be ready to beat Purdue and the remaining teams on the schedule.

Bentivenga blocked 0-C's extra point attempt. 
Following an 0-C miss of a long field goal try, Dillon had the ball on its own 20-yard line with less than five minutes remaining in the game. But on its first play, Dillon fumbled and 0-C recovered. 
After earning a first-and-goal on the five-yard line, 0-C was unable to reach the end zone. On fourth down it called on Kevin Hayes to try an 18· yard field goal with 50 seconds to play. Hayes' boot split the uprights and Dillon appeared ready to be saddled with its second consecutive loss. 
1be Dillon players obviously thought otherwise. On the first play Coughlan dropped back and heaved a long pass that split end Hugh Bres­lian caught as he fell to the ground on 0-C's 30-yard line. Time was still ticking down on Dillon, but the next play was a repeat of the last as Coughlan and Breslian hooked up again to give Dillon the ball on 0-C's three-yard line. 
Two plays later Thompson came on to complete the comeback and give Dillon its third victory in four games. Despite its Herculean efforts, 0-C gets its second loss against one victory and a tie. 
In a battle for the second playoff spot in the Parseghian division, Mor­rissey upset Flanner, 13-7. Flanner, which many people tabbed as the team to beat this year, fell behind 13­0, before starting a late scoring drive, which was capped by a Tim Arnold one-yard touchdown plunge, brought it within six.

However it was too little too late as Morrissey hung on to earn a playoffspot for the first time in many years. Morrissey's scores came on a 1 S-yard scamper by quarterback Geoff Henry and a seven-yard inter­ception return by noseguard Rich Toomey. Morrissey's record jumps to 3-l, while Flanner slides to 2-2. 
In the third Parseghian game, Scott Inglis hauled in a 30-yard pass from John Olson as Grace topped Keenan, 7-6, for its first victory of the year.Jim Book provided the win­ning margin by booting the extra point. Grace goes to 1-3 as Keenan falls to 1-2-1. 
Stanford finished its Leahy divi­sion schedule undefeated as it trounced winless Cavanaugh, 19-0. Tony Dawson scored on a three­yard run in the first quarter and quarterback Brent Basham tossed a 25-yard pass to Brian Steber for a second touchdown. Jim Clevenger finished the scoring with a fourth quarter four-yard run. 
Stanford ends the regular season 3-0-1 and Cavanaugh drops to 0-3. 
Alumni's Steve Deem snagged a 24-yard strike from quarterback Ken Sherman to make for a 7-0 victory over Holy Cross. Alumni now has a 1-1-1 slateasHolyCrossgoesto 1-2. 
In the Rockne division, Sorin remained unbeaten, untied and un­scored upon as it upended Pangborn, 6-0. Sean Garret contin­ued to run over opponents as he gave Sorin its lone score, a 1 0-yard run following a long punt return. 
Sorin is 3-0 while Pangborn finishes its year at 0-3-1. 
Howard stayed in contention for the Rockne title as it bested St. Ed's, 10-0. Howard's Tim Buckley blocked a St. Ed's punt and Jim Pastore grabbed the ball and rambled 1; yards for the score. joe Riehl added a 30-yard field goal to wrap up the win. 
Howard ups its record to 2-0-1 as St. Ed's drops to 1-2. 
The playoff picture is becoming clearer as five teams are already guaranteed spots in post-season play. Sorin clashes with Howard to­morrow night at 9:00 for the Rockne division crown. Regardless of the outcome, both teams will make the playoffs. 
The other Rockne game features St. Ed's and Carroll at 8:00, also to­

With a victory over Holy Cross tonight at 10:00, Zahm would earn a playoff spot. However, should Zahm lose and Alumni defeat Cavanaugh tomorrow night at 10:00, then Alumni gets the playoff spot. But if Alumni loses also, then Holy Cross sneaks into the playoffs. If either or both of the games end in a tie, Zahm will enter the playoffs. 
Dillon can sew up its third con­secutive Parseghian division crown with a victory over Grace tonight at 
7:00. H Dillon loses and Morrissey beats Off-Campus tonight at 9:00, then Morrissey wins the division. 
Again, regardless of the final scores, both Dillon and Morrissey will be in the playoffs. 
At 8:00 tonight, Keenan plays Flanner as both squads look to end their seasons on an up note.

Irish face 
Zips today 
on Alumni 
ByPHILWOLF 
AsststantSports Editor 
. It is the biggest home game of the Notre Dame soccer team's season. But it could have been even bigger. 
The Irish will play host to the Ak­ron Zips this afternoon on Alumni Field at 4:00. The game against the Zips, who are ranked second in the Mideast region and 19th nationally, is very important for Notre Dame. A victory today would have im­measureable value in terms of na­tional respectabilty and recognition for recruiting. 
The Irish were hoping last week that this game would mean even more. Last week, Notre Dame was facing games with the third-and fourth-ranked teams in the region (Akron and Marquette, respectively), and a couple of vic­tories could have clinched a berth in the NCAA Tournament for Notre Dame. 
On Sunday, however, the Irish lost at Marquette. Now Akron has taken the number-two spot in the rankings because Evansville, previously ranked second, lost two games over the weekend. The top ranking in the region belongs to two-time defend­ing national champion Indiana, but the fight for the next two spots and invitations to the NCAA Tourna­ment is still on. Still, Notre Dame is pretty much out ofthe fight. 
-But while a victory over Akron probably will do nothing to aid the Irish in getting an invitation to postseason play, today's contest is valuable for Notre Dame. 
"A win over Akron means respec­tability in the Mideast," Notre Dame head coach Dennis Grace says. "We can be the team that beat the team that went to the tournament. It will be very important for recruiting. Letting everybody know that we can compete at that level will be impor­tant." 
Grace said he believes the Irish are capable of competing on a level with the national powers, but so far this season they have not clearly shown an ability to do so. They have lost to top-ranked Indiana, number­eight St. Louis and Marquette, in ad­dition to tying Michigan State. 
The problem all season for Notre Dame, according to Grace, has been a lack of intensity on the part of some of the team's members. This lack ofintensity has manifested itself in the team's inabilty to finish off its weaker opponents or play with con­fidence against the stronger teams. 
Today, the Irish must overcome both their intensity problem and the problems that Akron's defense will cause. 
"Akron is noted for its defense," Grace says. "They wear you down, then they score one or two. That's

Soccer team must prove itself 

( . 
"'.f,

1~. 

The Notre Dame soccer team demonstrated last weekend what it means to come close without get­ting the cigar. 
The Irish seemingly had an opportunity to make it into the NCAA Tournament for the first time in the history oftheir soccer program. A loss to Marquette, however, ended any hopes they may have enter­tained ofsuch postseason play. 
This season Notre Dame has compiled a 10-3-2 record, and that really is not very surprising when one looks at the teams on the schedule. The Irish have beaten obviously weaker teams 10 times this season, and they have lost to three teams which were much more talented than they are. They tied Michigan State, a team which probably has exactly the same level oftalent as Notre Dame. The only real blemish on the record is a scoreless tie with Loyola ofChicago. 
To anyone who has followed Notre Dame soccer over the yearsrthis season's results do not seem ex­trordinary at all. Every season since the team was formed, the Irish have finished with a winning record, and every season the composition of that record is the same: one or two losses to weaker teams and losses to all of the big-name teams on the schedule, except maybe for an occasional upset by the Irish. 
The question which needs to be answered now is, "Why can't Notre Dame win the big games?" 
The answer to that question is obvious, although the solution to the problem is rather complex. The answer is that Notre Dame is not ready to compete regularly on a level with the national contenders. 
The soccer program that former coach Rich Hunter nursed from its infancy has gone as far as it can go without some major changes being made. One of those changes, which Hunter himself recognized, was to find a coach who is able to donate all of his time and energy to improving the team. That change was made this year when Dennis Grace took over as head coach. 
One of the things Grace has done is to begin to upgrade the schedule that Notre Dame will play next season. Gone are many of the "pushovers," and 

Phil Wolf 
Assistant Sports Editor 

in their places have popped up some of the biggest names in college soccer. 
Upgrading the schedule is just the first step, however. IfNotre Dame were to field the same sort ofteam as it has for the past several years against a lot of powerful competition, the Irish would be shell· shocked week after week. The answer to this di· lemma is improving the quality of players on the team. 
This year's Irish squad has several very talented players, but it lacks the depth necessary for a good team. Even the best players cannot always play an entire game against good competition, and a team is in trouble ifthe quality ofplay cannot be maintained with the backups in the game. Notre Dame has expe­rienced exactly this type ofinconsistent play against such teams as Indiana and Michigan State this year. 
The next step for the Irish is recruiting a good crop of freshmen to fill the starting roles as well as the spots on the bench. Grace says he is excited about the prospect of recruiting for Notre Dame, "a product" which will be easy to sell, he says. With an impressive schedule to wave in front of recruits, his job should be even easier. Only time will tell just how well Grace will be able to play the recruiting game. 
The next step in establishing a national contender is also the touchiest subject to discuss. For years Notre Dame's soccer program has been operating without scholarships, and for years the Irish have lost to the teams that do have scholarships to offer their players. The correlation, I think, is obvious. 
According toJerry Yeagley, head coach ofIndiana University's two-time national championship soccer

Like a fighter, Faust is on ropes 
c?;~~

Chuck Freeby 
'~· 
Sports Writer 

Irish Item~· 4~;£~~£. 

Hello again. everybody! 
If this football season were a boxing match, Notre Dame coach Gerry Faust would be one or two punches away from having the referee stop the contest. There is no doubt Faust is a fighter and a competitor. However, his legs are wobbly and his punches are not carrying much power. His back is on the ropes, and the people in the northwest corner ofthat fabled ring known as Notre Dame Stadium are ready to throw in the towel. 
To his credit, Faust is a battler and an optimist. He .will not give up, and he will not give in to criticism. He has not given up on this year's team and has all the confidence in the world in his players. He, his staffand his team certainly cannot be accused ofgiving anything less than 100 percent during the painful ordeal of the last few weeks. However, team unity does not appease the howlingfans on Saturday. 
In his demise, it seems as though Faust has been continually jabbed byproblems he has been unable to handle. One ofthose is the offense, which has had all the firepower of a squirt gun in recent weeks. Notre Dame has scored only three touchdowns ill the last three weeks and has scored only six points in the second halves of those three games. 
Of course, the largest share of the criticism given to the offense has been directed towards the offensive line, which has been blamed for Notre Dame's lackluster rushing attack. Faust has said at least four times in post-game press conferences that the line has not come off the ball well enough. He said it after the Purdue game, and he said after the Air Force game. The frequency of this statement leads us to one oftwo conclusions: 
1) In recruiting big linemen, Notre Dame has sacrificed speed for strength, and the coaches now must decide to adapt theirplay selec­tion to this fact, or 2) The coaches have known about a problem for six weeks and have been unable to do anything about it. 
Hopefully, the second conclusion is not correct, because if it is, Notre Dame has big problems. In either case, some kind of change has to be made. It is no secret d1at a revolving door has been used to change coaches during Faust's tenure, but maybe it'_s time to change offensive philosophy. Slow players cannot be expected to run plays that require quickness, such as pitchouts and sweeps. So, it seems logical if you have strength instead of speed, you try to run over people more often than you run around them. 
The ineptitude on offense has caused the defense to look bad as well, which is Faust's second problem. Notre Dame's inability to move the ball allowed Air Force nearly 35 minutes of possession. That causes a lot of problems with fatigue for a defense, especially against a quick team. 
This is not to say, however, that the Irish defense has been immune from creating its own difficulties. The Irish held back the option about as well as a sieve holds back water, and Faust admitted as much after the game. To the credit of Air force, it blocked well and executed with precise timing. Nevertheless, the Irish contrib­uted to the cause with an inability to make enough adjustments to counter the Falcon attack. Knowing that this week's foe, South Carolina, also runs the option, Notre Dame had better make some changes quickly. 
Speaking of South· Carolina, don't expect the 11th-ranked Gamecocks to hold back any punches against the Irish. joe Mor­rison's club took some lumps from Notre Dame last fall in Columbia, but now the Gamecocks are in the catbird's seat. South Carolina enters the game with a 5-0 record, and it has done it in impressive style. The Gamecocks dumped Georgia earlier this year and last week they thrashed Pitt. 
The Gamecock offense relies heavily on the quarterbacking tan­dem of Allen Mitchell and Mike Hold, who threw for four touch­down passes against the Panthers. When they don't attack the Irish secondary, look for one ofCarolina's four fine running backs to carry the ball. Tailback Thomas Dendy is a dandy who goes well to the 
· outside, while bruising fullback Kent Hagood prefers to travel the inside route. Whether the Gamecocks come at the Irish from the inside or outside, Gerry Faust will have to try to come off the ropes and be ready. He has absorbed losses like a boxer takes punches. The first one is a shock, but the next few are a little easier to handle. After a while, though, those punches begin to add up and take their toll. Too many punches can be hazardous for a boxer. Too many losses can be disastrous to a coach. Faust hopes his Irish can keep South Carolina from delivering a right hook to his coaching career this Saturday. 
Pickofthe Week .. There's only one thing worse than midterm week, and that's finals week, ofcourse. Don't waste your time study­ing, though. After all, it's not going to do any good. Instead. give yourself a break today, and head on out to Alumni Field at 4 p.m. to watch the Irish soccer team battle the 13th-ranked Zips from Akron. 
The Irish are a bit demoralized after losing a possible NCAA Tournament bid at Marquettte over the weekend, but a victory over Akron would certainly be something to raise the spirits of Dennis Grace's l 0-3-2 squad. A lot offan support would certainly help, so in the words of NBC, let's all be there today.
