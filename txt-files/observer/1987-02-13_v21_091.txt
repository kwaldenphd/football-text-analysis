Police, 
students 
discussOC problems 
By SHARON HEGG Staff Reporter 
Student government repre­sentatives met with police offi­cials, members of the neigh­borhood housing services(NHS), and off-campus stude_nts yesterday at the Northeast Neighborhood Center to discuss the increas­ing tensions between Notre Dame students and the South Bend community. 
The discussion centered around the topics of off-campus parties, position of the police and South Bend residents with respect to these parties, and off-campus crime. 
Don Montanaro, student body vice president opened the 
meeting  by  saying  that  on

Soviet authorities detain 13 protestors in demonstration 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -Security agents beat protesters and used snowplows to drive them off a Moscow street Thursday, the fourth day of rallies seeking the release of Jewish activist Josef Begun. 
Police briefly detained 14 people, including Begun's wife and son. 
The agents, who wore civil­ian clothes, also roughed up Western reporters and televi­sion crews covering the protest, which drew about 20 people at Moscow's Arhat shop­ping mall. 

Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov later told reporters that young toughs, not security agents, were re­sponsible for breaking up the protest. 
However, it was clear at the scene that the plainclothesmen were not teen-age vigilantes. They were well-organized and were backed by uniformed police and snowplows. 
All of those detained -seven at the protest site and six on their way there -were released after a few hours. Six were fined $77 for "petty hooliganism." Police also briefly detained a Western cor­respondent. 
The protesters, many of them Jews, had been gathering daily at the Arhat mall since Monday. They demand to be al­lowed to emigrate and call for 


Israel calls prisoner swap baseless 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -The Israeli 
government said Thursday 
that reports of a secret deal to 
swap Arab prisoners held in Is­
rael for foreign hostages in 
Lebanon was completely base­
less. 
The statement was in an af­fidavit given the Supreme Court as sworn testimony by State Attorney Yona Blatman's office. It was the strongest Is­raeli denial thus far of secret contacts to swap prisoners for hostages. 
But it left open the possibility of negotiating a prisoner ex­change for Israeli soldiers, seven of whom are listed as captured or mtssmg in Lebanon since 1982. 
The affidavit was submitted to the three-judge panel consid­ering whether to hear a suit· filed by families of terror vic­tims to bar the government from releasing prisoners con­victed of or on trial for ter­rorism. 

"The reports published in the media and on which the families base their petition are completely baseless," the af­fidavit said. 

It apparently responded to a report Wednesday in the Davar newspaper that cited Israeli and U.S. sources in Washington as saying Israel and the United States were negotiating a pack­age deal, involving the Interna­tional Committee of the Red Cross, to free all foreign hostages in Lebanon. 
The affidavit indicated Israel was working to bring home its servicemen from Lebanon, in-
eluding an airman held by the 
Lebanese militia Amal. 

"It is natural that we cannot 
in this statement relate to the 
details of the efforts being un­
dertaken to redeem our cap­
tives," the affidavit said. Offi­
cials have indicated there are 
ongoing contacts with the In­
ternational Red Cross on mis­
sing soldiers. 
In an interview Thursday on NBC's Today Show, Cabinet minister Moshe Arens said the government distinguished be­tween negotiations to free foreign hostagep and captured Israeli soldiers. 
"We've drawn the line in the past. .. between people who've been taken off the street and Israeli servicemen who have fallen into captivity in the line of duty," Arens said. 
the release of Begun, a Hebrew teacher who was sentenced in October 1983 to seven years in prison for "anti-Soviet agita­tion and propaganda." 

Authorities did not interfere with the demonstrations on Monday and Tuesday, but on Wednesday plainclothes agents shoved the protesters off A:'!Jat Square. 
On Thursday, the demonstrators lined up along one side of the brick-paved mall which runs through one of Moscow's oldest districts. Within minutes, they were sur­rounded by about 50 plainclot­hesmen. 
A small snowplow began cir­cling the demonstrators, forc­ing them to move back and forth across the mall. 
Authorities later used that snow plow and a larger one to help herd the protesters off the square. Men in plainclothes walked with them, attacking

Construction set to begin on new women's dorms 
By CAROLYN GIL-ber of women admitted to 
LESPIE Staff Reporter 
Construction of two new women's dorms will begin in two weeks between the Memorial Library and the Pasquerillas. The two dorms, which will house ap­proximately 500 women, will not be ready for occupancy until the fall of 1988. 
With  the  exception  of  
larger  chapels,  the  new  
dorms  will  essentially  be  

identical to the Pasquerillas, which also house 500 women, according to Director of the Physical Plant Don Dedrick. The increase in the num-

Notre Dame will be a gradual four year change starting in the fall of 1987. Following the construction of the new dorms and the conversion of Howard Hall, the percentage of men to wo­men will be approximately 63 to 37. 
The conversion of Howard Hall will begin immediately after graduation and should be completed by the end of July. No major conversions are scheduled to be done to Howard other than the bathrooms. The renovations to Howard ''are essentially

In Brief 
College drug testing programs are focusing on the wrong drug, says a University of Kansas survey. The study of 120 National Collegiate Athletic Association trainers showed that alcohol is the drug most abused by athletes, but it's the drug least tested for. Part of the problem is the fact that alcohol can be detected only during or shortly after consumption. -The Observer 
Swarms of bees escaped from their hives inside a hospital wall attacking patients, killing a partially paralyzed man and stinging more than 70 people, aut­horities said Thursday. The attack occurred Wednesday at the outpatient clinic of Pretoria's H.F. Verwoerd Hospi­tal, a whites-only facility, when firemen were trying to disperse the bees with insecticide. The man killed by the bees, Jurgens Barnard, 48, was receiving treatment for a partially paralyzed leg, hospital officials said. Two women stung in the attack were admitted to the hospital and listed in satisfactory condition. -Associated Press 
Arare, white Bengal tiger suffering kidney damage died at the Houston Zoo, an official said. The 3-year-old tiger, named Indiana Jones, had been separated from his sister, Sankara, since he started showing signs of illness a week ago. Zoo Director John Werler said the animal probably died of kidney damage. The tigers were bought from the Cincinnati Zoo in 1985 for $120,000. Only about 70 white tigers existed in the world then, but Werler said the number has increased slightly since then. -Associated Press

Valentine's Day deeper than its commercialism 
Valentine's Day. Although some may argue that Valentine's Day was created by the entrepreneurs of Hallmark, FTD and Fanny May, its origins are much deeper rooted. 
The "saint" in St. Valentine's Day is often omitted. Saint Valentine is a martyr who was beheaded on Feb. 14, 269. Legend has it that he was a Roman priest who disobeyed Emperor Claudius II's orders and married young couples. St. Valentine is supposed to have loved children. He was imprisoned for not worship­ping pagan gods. 
While in prison, the children tossed notes into his jail cell, thus the origin of the valentine. Another story attributes the valentine's origin to a farewell note St. Valentine wrote to the blind daughter of his jailer. He signed the letter "from your valentine." 
The Valentine's Day celebration idea actually comes from the Roman pagan holiday Luper­calia. Lupercalia was a ritual that the Romans did to ensure protection from wolves. 
Young men would strike women with strips of animal hide. Women would take the blows because they thought it would make them fer­tile. This is one of the lesser known of the Valen­tine's Day trivia facts, and not a romantic fact at that. 
And just where did valentine cards get their origin? Geoffrey Chaucer universalized the ex­changing of valentines in his work, "The Parli­ament Of Fowls," in which he wrote, "For this was Saint Valentine's Day, when every fowl cometh there to choose his mate." 
In the English and Italian Valentine's Day customs, unmarried women rose before sunrise and stood by their windows, often for hours, until a man would pass by. The custom was that the first man they saw would marry them within a year. 
The first valentines in the United States were created by Esther A. Howland, who admired homemade valentines she had seen from En­gland. Howland hired women to make the cards, in an assembly-line fashion, and turned her venture into a $100,000-a-year enterprise. 
Today, Valentine's Day is one of the most profitable for the greeting card industry. Hal­lmark Cards, in 1986, had 13,000 employees worldwide who create more than 14,000 new designs a year, many of them valentines. 
This Valentine's Day, the usual gifts of flowers, candy and cards are being replaced with innovative ideas such as Panty of the Month for women, and Brief of the Month for men. The lingerie is mailed in scented linen envelopes, for only $12.95 a month.

Of those traditional romantics who enjoy giving and receiving flowers, many women have entertained the idea of sending men flowers. How would the typical pomer react to a dozen red roses being sent to his room? Ac­cording to the results of a· poll by The Society of American Florists, as printed in USA Today, 91 percent of the 678 women they polled thought it was a good idea to send a man flowers. 
Now, I wonder what the results of the poll would be if they had polled men instead of wo­men? And I wonder just how many of these women actually followed through on their im­pulses? 
Despite all the gifts, Valentine's Day remains one of the most controversial holidays. Those who have a special sweetheart for whom they can buy all of the well-publicized gifts, seem to enjoy contributing to the economic develop­ment of the greeting card, candy and flower industries. Those who are unattached, often make fun of Valentine's day as being just an­other ploy for the rich to get richer. 
Whatever happened to the simplistic days of fourth grade when you sent everybody, well almost everybody, in your class one of those tiny valentines that said "Be Mine" or "Kiss Me," and you always saved the one that said to my "special" .valentine to someone who was worthy of it? 
Things just seemed much easier back then

WASHINGTON -President Reagan proposed Thursday that Congress protect 30 mil­lion elderly Americans ''from the worst fear of old age" by enacting insurance covering the devastating costs of cata­strophic illness. 
Overruling conservative op­position, Reagan recommen­ded that the government_ cover all hospital and doctor ex­penses under Medicare after a patient had paid $2,000 out of his own pocket. The extra coverage would add $4.92 a month -$59 annually -to Medicare recipients' $17.90 monthly "Part B" premium. 
The program, the result of more than a year's debate within the administration, would not cover long-term nur­sing home care or expenses such as prescription drugs and eye or dental care. 
Reagan's announcement pro­vided momentum for an issue 


Reagan proposes plan to cover illness costs 
that already has widespread backing on Capitol Hill. 
"I think there is a very good chance of legislation,'' said White House spokesman Mar­lin Fitzwater. "There will be a lively debate but I expect legis­lation to pass, and I think the Reagan plan will be the basis for that legislation." 
Sen. David Durenberger, R­Minn., the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Commit­tee's health subcommittee, said, "This is by far a better way for people to protect them­selves from catastrophic ex­penses. . . . The most serious criticism that can be offered of this proposal is that it is far too little." 
Led by Attorney General Ed­win Meese and the budget director, James Miller, con­servatives had fought against the plan as it was being developed, arguing that it relied too much on the govern­ment and not enough on the health industry. 


Heavy drinking varies widely between men and women 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Only about seven in 100 Americans con­sume two or more drinks a day, and such heavy and potentially harmful imbibing is much more likely among men and young people, a federal survey shows. 
The national Centers for Dis­ease Control reported Thursday the results of a tele­phone survey on drinking habits in 21 states and Wash­ington, D.C. participants were asked in 1985 whether they averaged two or more drinks a day. 
Only 7 percent of the 25,221 surveyed drank that much, leading the CDC to conclude that a level of two drinks a day is "higher than that experi­enced by the large majority of adults." 
But survey findings varied significantly when broken down by state, sex or age. More than 10 percent of the men sur­veyed had two drinks a day, compared to less than 3 percent of the women. In most states, heavy drinking declined noticeably with age. Residents of Illinois were as much as three times more likely to drink heavily than residents of Utah or North Dakota. 

The CDC had surveyed several states in 1984, but re­searchers said the 1985 survey yielded the first solid results and they could not compare the two years' figures. 

CDC researchers believe that most of the people averag­ing 60 drinks a month, or two a day, are actually drinking each and every day, said David Williamson, a specialist with the CDC's nutrition division. 
"It's not clear which is more harmful, 60 drinks in a month on three days ... (or) consum­ing every day," he said. 

"Heavy, heavy hinging can be ·very harmful also." 
Although no absoluterule ap­plies, people who average that kind of drinking are far more likely to suffer alcohol-related health problems, he said.' 
"If somebody is chronically exposed over many years to this kind of alcohol consump­tion, their risk of liver prob­lems will be increased . . . their risk of alcohol dependency tends to be raised,'' Williamson said.

A vanti Motor Corp. seeks car name recognition 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -It has been more than two decades since a Studebaker was exhibited at an automobile show, but a tiny remnant of the company is still trying to attract attention. 
The New Avanti Motor Corp. display at the Chicago Auto 
. Show '87 this week features the company's $59,900 handmade luxury car, with a television set as standard equipment. 
Avanti was sold to two South Bend, Ind., businessmen when Studebaker closed in 1965. Its current owner, Michael Kelly, purchased the company at a bankruptcy sale last April 30. 
Avanti is a long way from being a major automobile maker. The company has just 18 dealers across the country, and makes fewer than 300 cars a year. 
"Our challenge today is to es­tablish name recognition,'' said Larry Towne, vice presi­dent of sales and marketing. "We're taking things a step at

a time because it is very ex­pensive to develop a new car.'' 
Today's Avanti has been sub­stantially redesigned to use General Motors parts from the brakes to the drivetrain, Towne said. 
"What this means to our cus­tomers is if there is a problem in Podunk, S.D., he can go to any G M dealer and get it repaired.'' 
The Avanti's uniqueness comes from its grilleless, hand­made fiberglass body and its all leather interior. 
"We want people to consider Avanti as an alternative to Jaguar or Porsche or Cor­vette," Towne said. 
The cheapest Avanti sells for $29,995, while a top-of-the-line, fully-equipped stretch LCS model sells for $59,900, he said. 
Avantis are not manufac­tured until they are sold, and one of the company's goals is to sell and make 1,000 to 1,200 cars, Towne said. 
Hayden and Miss Fonda denounced Polish officials in 1981, when the government declared martial law in response to a national trade union strike led by Walesa's outlawed Solidarity union. 
Hayden, a Santa Monica Democrat, is serving his third term in the state Legislature.

Titan delivers payload after two explosions 
Associated Press 

VANDENBERG air force base, Calif. -The launch of a Titan rocket carrying a classi­fied military payload into polar orbit restores America's abil­ity to send heavy satellites into space, the military said Thursday. 
Air Force Secretary Edward Aldridge hailed the launch as ''the first major step in the recovery" of the Defense De­partment space program after the space shuttle Challenger disaster and the explosion of two Titans at Vandenberg. 
The Air Force launched a Titan 3B booster carrying a classified payload from its Vandenberg launch center, 150 
miles  northwest  of  Los  An­ 
geles, late Wednesday.  
"Everything  worked  just  

fine," said base spokesman Sgt. Virgil Short. The rocket placed the classi­fied payload into an orbit

taking it over the north and south poles. The Air Force declined to discuss the nature of the payload. 
One official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the payload was not a weather satellite, suggesting it might have been some type of electronic surveillance satel­lite. 
The launch was the first of any type of Titan booster since the Air Force lost two Titans in 1985 and 1986 at Vandenberg and grounded the fleet. The booster launched Wednesday was also the last of the Titan 3B boosters in inventory. 
The Titan 3B is a two-stage, liquid-fueled booster capable of carrying a payload weighing roughly 7,000 pounds into a low polar orbit. Strapping on large solid-fuel boosters transformed the 3B into the much more pow­erful 34D. 


Alaska boy, snow·-buried, saved by police canine 
Associated Press 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska -A 6­year-old boy was recovering Thursday after a road grader buried him for four hours in the snow outside his mother's house, police said. 
Joey Mays was semi­
conscious when found, suffer­
ing from mild hypothermia, 
police said. 
He was found a police Ger­
man shepherd, King. 
"It couldn't have been more 
than 20 feet from the home, and 
King went straight for it and 
started digging," said Officer 
Jack Chapman. "The dog saved 
that kid; no doubt about it." 
Police called neighbors to bring shovels and everyone helped dig. 
Neighbors said they remem­bered seeing a road grader passing through the area ear­lier in the day, about the time the boy disappeared. Police said they suspected the boy was either pushed over by the grader or had already crawled into a snow cave.

minor alterations," Dedrick said. 
The first women's dorm to be completed, a recent Presi­dent's newsletter said, will be called the Maria Burke Knott Hall, after the wife of the ben­efactor. 
The benefactors of the second women's dorm are a fa­ther and son team by the name of Siegfried, for whom the hall will be named. 
Dedrick "apologizes to the residents of the (Flanner and Grace) Towers and the Pasquerillas for the inconven­ience the fence around building site will cause them."

What is television for? Is it to enter­tain, to educate, to protect, or is it just used to occupy those dull hours we all have? 
A discussion that I recently had during a public speaking class at IUSB prompted me to think about the purpose of the media, and most especially, about the purpose of commercials. 
Gertie Wimmer 
private I 
Everybody knows about commercials. Even I, who probably haven't watched more than 20 hours worth of television in the last 4 years, know what a com­mercial is. And I know what the pur­pose of commercials is--to make money for sponsors who in turn pass their made-money to the station. The more people who want to watch a particular program, the more money the station can ask a sponsor for their 30 second or however long message. 


P.O.BoxQ 
Reason lacks because of reluctance to talk 
Dear Editor: 
In response to Joe Murphy's articl€ on Monday, might I first say that if Murphy would have attended the Sen­ate meeting when the Observer was dis­cussed (as he had been invited to do), he might have understood that what the Senate was discussing was not an ad­visory board under Student Govern­ment auspices, but independent. Rea­son did not prevail because he did not want to talk. 
The main reason why I even opened up such a discussion was because of the many complaints I have received con­cerning the Observer. As a representa­tive of student interests, it is my duty to respond to such complaints. Murphy might ask, "What complaints?" Well, if he did not have a closed-door policy and refuse to discuss things with some people (as I have personally dis­covered), he would know what com­plaints I am talking about. In a word, a person associated to the Observer

"' 
As far as my understanding goes (and I'll be the first to admit it doesn't go too far) the FCC controls not only the station programming but also the commercials. It is the FCC that decides what words can and cannot be said, what actions can be shown, and when. 
It is also my understanding (and stop me if I'm wrong) that the FCC passed a ruling on drinking commercials a year past. This ruling prohibited an ad­vertiser from showing someone actu­ally drinking on television. One as­sumes the FCC thinks the public has the mentality of a newborn if it cannot connect the thoughts--bottle of beer from hand to mouth. Swallow. Showing someone holding the bottle or can in no way inhibits our synapses from making the little leap to the assumption that the beer (or whatever) is in the process of being consumed, whether or not the beer is currently opened. 
The FCC also made a ruling years ago about showing smoking commer­cials on television. Magazines are ob­viously enough free of this restriction, or we wouldn't be blessed with all­American figures like the Marlboro man and the Virginia Slims woman (picture that royal wedding, would you?) 

And again, it may be just me, but I find it intensely ridiculous to do things half way. If the FCC takes the stand that commercials are supposed to be beneficial to public health (which seems to be what prompted their no­smoking stand) how can they allow drinking commercials, even with closed cans and bottle caps? It seems more sane to either prohibit both, or to allow both to use the freedom of the broadcast media to advertise their wares, for public better or worse. 
If they say the open beer commer­cials would encourage drinking, what about the Sara Lee and Pizza Hut com­mercials that bombard the public during soap operas and late night? Cer­tainly these commercials are encour­aging obesity and nasty nutritional habits. I guess we're just not that worried about fat cells, just lung and 
who graduated last year described the situation as "brutal." Reason did not prevail because he did not want to talk. 
Murphy seems to think that people are upset over his philosophy presented through the paper. Personally, I have no problem with this. Besides, just look at the risque stances which the Obser­ver has taken in the last year. They congratulated the Fencing team for winning a national championship. They congratulated Fr. "Monk" Malloy on his election to be the next Notre E>ame president. They also congratulated the basketball team on beating North Carolina. Are there more than these? Oh yeah, they criticized Switek and Montanaro for not letting them report the first CLC meeting. I could hardly "debate the merits" of these "points" which the Observer made. In fact, I agreed with them. Reason did not prevail because he did not want to talk . 
The Observer is an institution at 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. I 

respect its independence. Yet, it man­
datorily collects $12 from every stu­
dent. True independence entails that 
the Observer would have to scramble 
for its own subscriptions. The Observer 
is thus dependent upon students and

what student paper is not. However, do you think that students who have had problems and have faced a closed door would want to continue to subscribe? These, my friends, are the people I am concerned about. I am willing to listen. No matter, a change of guard will occur very soon and hopefully things will im­brain cells. There is no organization called "Mothers Against Fat Drivers," so nobody thinks this is a problem. Wrongo. 
Talk to kindergarten teachers. These people will tell you that children come into class singing the jingles they hear on cartoon TV. More to the point, these kids come to class bouncing off walls because they had some solid sugar cereal their mothers bought them for breakfast. If beer is bad for you, so is smoke, and so is sugar. 
I'm not advocating bean sprout and toothpaste commericals 24 hours a day. Admittedly, there is only so much one can say about vegetables and plaque, and I personally wouldn't like to sit through millions of Fresh Like, Green Giant, and hygiene commercials. I just think that whoever does the ruling on what I'm viewing (or not viewing) should be a bit more consistent.

Men's tennis opens spring season; Fallon looks to 'assemble puzzle' 
By GREG ANDRES Sports Writer 
With the pieces back, but the puzzle not quite in place, the Notre Dame men's tennis team packs for Wisconsin. 
It is this puzzle that Head Coach Tom Fallon has as­sembled and manipulated for 
· 30 years and 494 tennis vic­tories. 
It is this very puzzle that the Warriors of Marquette have been unable to solve in 30 at­tempts, the first dating back to 1929. 
But then again neither has Wisconsin-Oshkosh in seven tries. And only once in seven confrontations and 52 years, has Bradley come away with the spoils. 
Each will get another try, but it will most likely be their last. Oq Friday, Saturday and Sun­day, each squad will get a shot at dethroning Fallon on the second, third and fourth stops on his farewell tour. 
The first was at Northwes­tern, where the Irish were turned away, 7-2. 
All excuses aside, however, the team representing Fallon in Evanston, Ill., was not 'the' team, not 'the' team that Fal­lon will showcase this weekend. 
Missing from Fallon's puzzle were the cornerpeice and two other mighty important pieces. But back are number-one singles player Brian Kalbas and the number-three and five

up in certain positions by default. I don't think that will necessarily be the case this fall. We have very few linemen for spring practice, and injur­singles players, Tony Kahill and Paul Daggs, each of whom was victimized by injuries and unavailable for action against Northwestern. They are back, and thus the puzzle is complete. 
As for the pieces being out of place, changes have been made because not all of the players are at 100 percent after some injuries. 
Kalbas, recovering from a twisted ankle, will move to third sinlges. Daggs and Kahill will be limited to doubles ac­tion. 
Sophomore Tim Carr will make his second start at first singles. Dave Reiter moves from fourth to second, fresh­man Tim Wallace to fourth, captian Dan Walsh to fifth and the lone senior Tom Grier to sixth. 
As for the doubles lineup, Carr and Reiter, Class A Eas­tern Collegiate doubles champs a year ago, will occupy the first slot. Kahill teams with Wallace at second and some com­binaiton of Grier, Kalibas and Daggs will play third. Kahill 
and  Kalibas  shared  Class  B  
Eastern  Collegiate  doubles  
honors last spring.  

Fallon feels the team has worked hard and, with no fur­ther injuries, looks forward to a good weekend. He noted, however, that they must also be aware of the tougher com­petition that lies a week away at the Notre Dame Quadran­gular. 
ies are going to be critical. I am concerned about our oppor­tunity to have a spring game­that may not become a reality. We'll have to go into spring practice and see what happens there. But I think this year over past years we have some posi­tions that are pretty well set, 
Another factor influencing the confrontations will be playing back-to-back matches. 
"That will be a good test to our conditioning," says Reiter. 
He also points out that the Irish will be playing on slower asphalt courts, different from the faster-surface courts of the ACC. He notes this has advan­tages as well disadvantages, but feels the fast courts at Notre Dame improve footwork. 
At the start of the season, Fallon set his sights on 25 wins to cap off his career. Having five of six monogram winners in his lineup has strengthened his hopes. 
The addition of Wallace, ana­tive of Pembroke, Fla., has solidified these notions. Wal­lace accounted for one of the two wins at Northwestern, truimphing in three sets, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6. Fallon speaks highly of Wallace and refers to him as a "pleasant surprise, with great potential. He has all the shots and will improve as his confi­dence, maturity and patience settle in." 
As for the opponents, Fallon does not see too many prob­lems. The Irish beat Mar­quette, 9-0, last year and also trounced Wisconsin-Oshkosh, 8-0. 
If the Irish can stay healthy, Fallon should return from the trip moving closer to the 500­win plateau, and the close of the "Fallon Era." 
where we know we have people that played the position and played it well. But depth is con­stantly going to be a problem.''

Irish tackle Michigan, prepare for NCAA's 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
Hoping its luck against Michigan schools improves after home losses to Mic­higan State and Central Mic­higan, the Notre Dame wres­tling team takes on the University of Michigan on the road tonight at 8. 
Having been ranked in the top-20 throughout the year, the 7-5-1 Wolverines could prove to be the toughest of the Michigan schools the 1-8 Irish face this season. 
"They're going to be pretty solid," said Head Coach Fran McCann. "They've gone through problems and injuries, but they've been ranked in and out of the top-10 all year." 
Michigan also features nationally-ranked wrestlers Doug Wyland and John Fis­her at 118 and 134 pounds, which should help Irish 20­match winners Andy Raden­baugh and Jerry Dur~o prepare for the NCAA regionals in the first week of March. 
"Right now, we've got our eye on regionals. I an­ticipate us doing pretty well in a tournament-type situa­tion," said McCann. "Our practices have been the best they've ever been. Physi­cally, this is the best we've ever looked. We're starting to peak, and I hope it can carry over these next few weeks.'' 
McCann does not feel the team's disappointing dual­meet record will affect the confidence of the Irish heading into this stretch of the season and the regionals. 
"A few weeks ago, the record was definitely on our minds," he said, "but now they've realized that there are too many holes in the lineup, and they control that. Now they're looking forward to the NCAA's. All this is just a preliminary to the NCAA's."

Irish face eighth-ranked Tennessee 


By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 

You might think a 6-14 team riding a two-game losing skid would be frightened when the next team on the schedule is ranked eighth in the country. 
When you're Notre Dame wo­men's basketball coach Mary DiStanislao, however, you find a way of seeing these situations as opportunities. The Irish have faced several national powers earlier this season, and they continue looking for that big win which could make a year of troubles all worthwhile when they face Tennessee to­morrow afternoon in Knox­ville, Tenn. 
"Even though we haven't beaten one of the real big teams yet, it's still a great thing to have them on the schedule," said freshman Annie Schwartz, who poured in 29 points in Wed­nesday night's loss to Detroit. ''If we could win a game like this, it would just make our season." 
The Lady Volunteers are led by sophomore forward Bridgette Gordon, who averages 16.5 points and 6.8 rebounds per game. Center Karla Horton leads Tennessee in boards, pulling down 7.7 a contest. 
The biggest problem in Notre Dame's last two losses (to Detroit, 94-86, and Miami, 62­
61) has been its ability, or lack thereof, to handle the press late in the game. The Irish lost leads at the end of both those contests thanks to costly turn­overs when the heat was on. 
And, yes, the Lady Volun­teers love to press both full and half-court. 
"It's going to be tough," said Schwartz. "If we handle their pressure, I think we should be able to play with them, but if we get sloppy we're going to be in big trouble. 
"We've been having prob­lems with the full-court press especially, and Coach (DiStanislao) has been working with us on breaking it. That's something we've been really concentrating on in prac­tices recently.'' 
Schwartz has been a bright spot of late, as she and sopho­more forward Heidi Bunek rolled up 29 points apiece against the Lady Titans on Wednesday, Each fell just two points shy of a Notre Dame single-game scoring record set by Trena Keys last season. 
"I'm just playing my game," 
Schwartz said. "It's not that the other players are giving me the ball more or anything, it's 
just that I've been getting open on our regular offense. When I'm open, I expect to hit the shots." 
Bunek leads the Irish in both scoring and rebounding, averaging 14.8 points and 8.9 boards per game. 
Point guard Mary Gavin, who will be a crucial figure in breaking the Lady Vols' press, leads the North Star Confer­ence in both assists (7.4) and steals (2.7). She had a string of six consecutive double-figure scoring games snapped last weekend against Miami.

Notre Dame Communication and Theatre Film Series This week at the Snite: 
Annie Hall (1978) Color, 93 minutes, directed by Woody Allen, USA Friday, February 13, 7:30 and 9:30p.m., Snite Regrded by many as Allen's masterpiece, this captivating film is the most satisfying combina~ion of Allen's comedic and intellectual sides. It is one of only two films to accom~hsh the Grand Slam of Academy Awards; Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Picture. Bringing Up Baby (1938) 
BW, 102 minutes, directed by Howard Hawks, USA 
Monday, February 16, 7 p.m., Snite Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant are in peak form as they sing hit songs to a leopard and chase a bone-burying dog in this fast-paced screwball comedy by master of the genre Howard Hawks. · Point of Order (1964) 
The Red Nightmare (1962) 
Directed by Emile de Antonio and George Waggner, USA Monday, February 16, 9 p.m. Two contrasting documentaries. Point of Order is a rousing film record of the televised 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings, illustrating the continuing influence of media on politics. 
Red Nightmare was made for the U.S. Dept. of Defense by Warner Bros. and depicts (in a dream. ~ence) the loss of civil liberties that ensues when an ordinary American's c~mmumty IS taken over by communists. Film students will find many similarities between Nightmare and Don Siegel's 1950 classic, Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Take the Money and Run (1969) Color, 85 minutes, directed by Woody Allen, USA Tuesday, February 17, 7:30p.m., Snite Allen writes, directs and acts in this documentary spoof about life of an inept thief. The concept behind the comedy -a satire on film forms -is thought-provoking and prefigures ideas explored in later films. 
The Observer Friday, February 13, 1987-page 13 


The Observer/Greg Kohs The Notre Dame hockey team faces Michigan-Dearborn in a pair of away games this weekend. Chris Dallavo takes a look at for­ward Tim Kuehl and previews the series at right. 
Freshman right-winger finds mark 

Kuehl adds scoring punch 
myself to one sport," he noted. "With studying, there isn't time to do much else. Besides, the golf courses aren't too great around here.'' 
Looking towards this weekend's games at Michigan­Dearborn, both Smith and Kuehl feel that the many injur­ies will affect the play of the Irish. 
"Our team centers around Mike McNeil, so hopefully he will be able to play," Kuehl added. "Losing him would really hurt us." 
"We have so many guys hurt that we've had to shuffle players around," Smith com­mented. "Some of them (the in­jured players) are coming back, though, and hopefully they'll put the puck in the net for us. 
"These games are very im­portant. If we win them both, we'll be in first place in the con­ference, and our fate will be in our own hands. We've had an excellent week of practice, so we're ready to get 'em." 
By CHRIS DALLAVO Sports Writer 
Look out Snoopy, there's a new Cool in town. 
He's Tim "Timmy Cool" Kuehl, the high-scoring fresh­man right winger for the Notre Dame hockey team, and he's here to stay. 
Kuehl has been a pleasant surprise this year for Coach Lefty Smith's team, adding some much-needed scoring punch to the injury-riddled squad. 
"Timmy has done an ex­tremely good job for us," Smith said. "He has been putting the puck in the net, which is some­thing we really need, especially with all of the injuries we've been having." 
Kuehl grew accustomed to scoring a lot of points in high school, but not even he ex­pected to get off to such a fast start. 
''The puck has been going into the net for me,'' Kuehl noted. "I've been in a little bit of a slump lately, but the early scoring was definitely a surprise--a welcome surprise.'' 
Kuehl, a part of the "Cake­eater Connection" from Edina, Minn., likes the offensive end of the ice. He has been espe­cially effective on the Irish power play, leading the team with six goals. 
"One of the better things I do is put the puck in the goal, not pound someone into the boards," he said. "I have the chance to get a lot of shots off with the man advantage, so I really like the power play. I want to score." 
Kuehl is a member of the Fel­lowship of Christian Athletes, something which has helped him both on and off the ice. 
"It is centered around sports," he mentioned, "but it is open to everyone. I have learned a lot about my faith through the FCA." 
A three-sport letterman at Edina High School, Kuehl has decided to concentrate on hockey at Notre Dame. 
"Hockey is such a long season that it is best to devote

Fans must be aware 

of causing problems 
Last weekend, the Notre Dame basketball team lost two tight contests in front of over 30,000 fans. Vanderbilt and Kansas, especially Kansas, were great places for college basketball. Vanderbilt was for its Memorial Gym, a great old structure with charm despite the idioscynracies of benches on the baseline and press box 800 miles above the action. 

Dennis Corrigan Sports Editor 
Kansas was great because of the fan spirit. While the ritualistic pre-game cheer, "Rock Chalk, Jayhawk, KU," sounds like an odd geological excercise to us, to Jayhawk fans it's soernthing akin to the Profession of Faith. 
But why bring these games up when the Irish host 15th­ranked Duke Sunday? Well, Notre Dame hosted a great game of its own two weeks ago when the Irish upset North Carolina. It was the best of games, it was the worst of games. 
It was the best in that Notre Dame added yet another upset of a number-one team. The Irish came from 16 down and got star performances from Gary Voce and David Rivers. The students, accused of apathy before the game, responded fantastically. 
But it was also the worst of games for one of the same reasons it was the best of games. The students greeted Carolina with ephitets that had racial connotations. Granted that whoever made those ND signs shouldn't have made them of cardboard, but they shouldn't have been thrown. Definitely no one should have been on the court until the final horn had sound~. Imagine, if you will, Gary Voce missing one or both of his free throws at the end. We would have gone horne empty with no one but ourselves to blame. 
Now Notre Dame is in .a similar position when it faces Duke Sunday, and the Athletic Department is worried about a repeat of the offenses against North Carolina. The Athletia Department has been feeling the heat from inside the University to make sure the students don't get too unruly again. The same complaints are coming from

MARK DICKINSON features writer How do the homeless cope with winter in South Bend? Father John Wilson and Reverend Bert Harrison discussed this question in 1981, and decided the homeless A yearround Valentine from the heart faced a threat of freezing to death.  the Homeless. The shelter is a "place where anyone who wants to can come in and sleep at night" says Gene Foust, one of the on-site supervisors. Nightly from Nov. I to April 15 each winter, approximately 20-25 homeless people accept the offer, he says. The Shelter for the Homeless, which is located on South Michigan St. in the basement of Maranatha Temple, opens at 10:30 p.m., after an on-site supervisor explains the rules. On this particular Monday night, four men In their mid-twenties await the instruc­tion.

He makes them extinguish 

their cigarettes, and he warns 
them not to be abusive to the 
volunteers or each other. With 
the formalities accomlplished, 
Foust enthusiastically invites 
the men inside. 

After they sign in, the men 
claim a cot and stand in line 
for a snack of soup, crackers, 
and coffee. As the number of 
people increases, some so­

cialize, some take showers, but 
most collapse onto their 
blanketed cots. 

At 11 p.m., the shelter is locked for the night and the crowd of 19 guests prepares for the 11: 15 p.m. light out. Juanita Foust, a team captain, admits that the 11 p.m. curfew has been extended in the past "Rules are made to bend," she says. 
The guests are awakened at 
6 a.m. and clear up the sleep­
ing area before a meal of cof­
fee, juice, and donuts is 
served. As the guests leave, 
they are handed a breakfast 
ticket for the nearby Hope 

Rescue Mission. At 7 a.m. the 
doors are locked until the next 
night. 
The rest of the day the 

homeless go "whereever they 
can find a warm place," says 
Gene Foust. He says they nor­
mally are tolerated at the Ji. 
brary and the post office. 

Gene Foust says the majority 
of the shelter visitors are 

young men between the ages 
of 20 and 25. He says some 
people have come each night 
since the shelter opened in 
1984 while others visit the 

shelter once or twice and move 
on. Yet the guests have one 

thing in common -they want a 
place to sleep out of the cold. 
Teams of four to six volun­
teers run the shelter each night 
under the supervision of a 

trained team captain. An on­
site supervisor is also present 
until 12 a.m. to open the shel­
ter and explain the rules. The 
rest of the team stays the en­
tire night. Volunteers sleep in 
shifts but at least two must be 
awake at all times. 

The core of 300-400 volun­
teers comes from churches, 

service organizations, and from 
Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, and 
the Indiana University at South 
Bend. They set up the shelter, 
sign In guest, and serve food, 
but the volunteers also talk 
with the guests. 

Juanita Foust feels a "kind of 
bond" exists between students 
and the shelter guests. The

guests "enjoy listening to stu­dents." 
The Shelter for the Homeless relies on donations and oc­casional grants for its opera­tion. Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Memorial Hospital provide blankets. Dunkin Donuts offers excess donuts. The rest of the food and money comes from local citizen contributions. 
The idea of a shelter did not gain immediate acceptance in South Bend. The United Religi­ous Community approved the project but there was no money for the shel­ter. A local church agreed to loan space, but neighbors complained and wouldn't allow it. 
Then one day Harrison wan­dered into the Maranatha Temple and asked Reverend Shirley Reamer If he could use the basement as a shelter. She said the shelter fit into her church's ministry and was a "God Send." 
The Wally Byam Caravan Club International donated $6000 to start the shelter from collections the group took at a two-week ra:ly they held at Notre Dame. The group of Airstream Mobile home owners happened to pick Notre Dame for its annual rally at a time when the shelter needed money. 

The UTC, which is an organi­zation of local congregations that addresses social problems, continues to run the shelter. 
Volunteer at the Shelter for the Homeless keep a nightly log of their thought and experi­ences at the shelter. One volunteer writes, "''m here to 
· face reality. The reality that the world is not as well off as I am." Another writes, "It's definitely an awakening placing actual faces to these stories of homeless people." Finally, one writes "It's good to remind me that people actually do exist that have no home, that have no where to go, often after a long day of going nowhere." 
Gene Foust says anyone interested in volunteering at the Shelter for the Homeless can call the URC at 282-2.397 until 5 p.m.

building on its campus specifi­
cally intended for community 
work. The board oversees all of 
NSHP's major expenditures, but 
Roemer stresses that the stu­
dents are the most important 
part of the program. 
The students elect their own 
officers and board members. 
NSHP President Tom Pigott has 
been involved in the program 
for four years. As president, he 
organizes and promotes the 
program. His essential duty is 
to provide communication be­
tween the South Bend schools 
and community centers and the 
Notre Dame students and 
board members. He also coor­
dinates special events such as 
picnics, bowling trips for the 
children and NSHP's recent 
"summit meeting" at St. 
Joseph Bank where-issues 
relating to service were dis­
cussed by various speakers 
including University President­
Elect Father Edward Malloy. 
"(NSHP) not only provides the 
South Bend student with one­
to-one tutoring but also 
facilitates a bond between the 
Notre Dame student and the child in the community," says Pigott . "Through this relation­ship the Notre Dame student 
functions as a positive role 
model." 
"Working at the community 
centers is very challenging," 
Pigott says. There are only 25 
tutors for each center for 
whoever shows up for help. "It 
is hard to get a balance," he 
says. 
The Notre Dame students 
who become involved with the 
program find that they are both 
friends and teachers for the 
children. "At the centers the 
guys are with the guys and the 
girls are with the girls," says 
Pigott. This emphasizes the 
role of friendship. "The stu­
dents are great role models, 
highly motivated which inspires 
the kids," says Roemer. 
At the centers most of the 
time is devoted to tutoring, but 
towards the end of the session the students and children play games. Pigott said he feels that game-playing demonstrates to students that "service work can be fun." 
The friendship that develops between tutor and child is pos­sibly the most dynamic part of the program. It is difficult to me£:asure the success of the friendship involved in the tutor­ing process. Roemer estimates that in the first 20 years of the program 1 0, 000 South Bend kids received help from NSHP. 
"If those kids could be lo­cated, they would probably agree that their tutor from Notre Dame was the most in­fiuencial person in their life," Roemer says. This influence is true since the children who are tutored are between nine and 10 years old which is a very impressionable age. "This is a fine example of Notre Dame values in action," says Roemer. 
Notre Dame students get in­volved in NSHP for various reasons. Laura Masotti, a fresh­man at Saint Mary's, tutored last semester and plans to tutor this semester also. She finds the friendship with her student "fun and rewarding. They need somebody to look up to, especially if they don't have brothers and sisters." 
P.J. Drew, a freshman at Saint Mary's, is· tutoring for a second time this semester. "When they catch on to something, it made me feel so much better," she says. 
Matt Micros, a sophomore at Notre Dame, is tutoring for the third time this semester. "It's a good experience in dealing with kids, a good feeling hel­ping others," he says. Sean Kerrigan, a Notre Dame sopho­more, is tutoring for the first time. He says he feels that his participation in NSHP will help him "make better use of my time, and put some activity in my life." 
Pat Sheehan, a sophomore at Notre Dame also tutoring for the first time, hopes to make the most of the friendship he will have with his student, "Maybe I can learn something from the kid."

Of sins, sons, and the sexual revolution 

be behind the wheel of a motorized vehicle. In a better world, teenagers shouldn't be left alone with the idea they are ready for a sex life as long as it's safe. That's the message which will be appearing alongside the Coke ads on the tube if the Surgeon General insists on fighting fire with fire. 
Every generation has a prob­lem raising the children to cope wisely with their sexuality. Some kids I grew up with got burned early; the easy morality of the war years left them old before their time. The casualty list of the sexual revolution could make you wonder if there's a providential God. Over 1,000,000 unwanted preg­nancies a year, they say, occur among unmarried couples un­der twenty. The 18,000,000 abortions haven't been able to wipe out the pregnancies fast enough. In addition, we now have deadly taints in the bloodstream; horror lies ahead of us like the Black Death. 
What is the cure? More to the point, what is the problem? Part of the problem is that we've given the kids front-row seats to a sexual revolution; they've seen for themselves that "no" is an obsolete word, unless you're refusing a nerd. An old ballad complains: "They try to tell us we're too young... we're not too young at all." That song was on the charts back when the parents of today's teenagers were teenagers, long before the Woodstock Generation. What legacy of innocence and lost childhood does the Woodstock Generation have to pass on to 

the newborns? Original sin 
hangs in the air like nuclear 
radiation. The Bible warns, "The sins of the parents are visited onto the children unto the third and fourth generation. Those who sow the wind reap the whirlwind. Have the 
18,000,000 women having abortions learned anything that by now should have coalesced into folk wisdom, which could serve as a warning about looking at the consequences before leaping onto the horns of dilemma? 
I'm not an embittered old poop lashing out at the permis­sive society; it takes a lot to shock me. I want the same thing that the Surgeon General wants: a chance for our kids to grow up gracefully in a world free of war. If only condoms could really protect the experi­ment. But what is the wisdom of plunging deeper into the sexual revolution? Abortion was supposed to take some of the heartbreak out of society. Now a woman can use abortion as a way of shopping for a baby that meets predetermined specifications, and the abortion mills have become a lucrative industry. The condom manufacturers want to use prime time for their hustling, their cynical reasoning being, "Americans know in their hearts that religion has failed. The use of condoms is now the new morality." Eventually, we'll probably discover that con­doms backfire on the users. Recycled condoms could be­come a new source of infec­
tion. 
Non-smokers keeping the smoking ads off the air; non­drinkers keep the hard liquor ads off the air. The Surgeon General, though so vigorously campaigning against smoking, wants to see condoms ad­vertised. The question is why? 
Smokers know where they can get cigarettes; drinkers know where booze is marketed. The condoms are for sale at the drugstore. You can get them without a prescription, even second-graders know that. The Marlboro man is a nebbish compared to the model, seen in the early ads, who confides how she relies on the protectiveness of Trojans that she picks out herself. 
A sickness is killing us; and it is not AIDS. What's killing us is that we're so sophisticated. As adults, we enjoy the permis­siveness and freedom. The divorce rate is up; the newspapers are full of fast­breaking scandals. We shrug our shoulders, live and let live. Maybe the country is better off, we chuckle, now that we can watch pornography on the home screen and Dr. Ruth is there to assure us sexuality isn't holy. 
We forget how the sins of the parents affect the children. Maybe we don't have to worry about the third and fourth generations. Maybe radiation, cholesterol, AIDS and syphilis will turn out to be just as deadly as the prophets of gloom said they would be. 

P 
age eight of Wednesday's Observer had an interest­Ing group of stories. Under the picture of a nun lecturing on religion which was captioned "Faith and Prayer," appeared an article on the Surgeon General titled, "Koop favors TV ads for condoms." Next to the picture was another headline: "Some women get abortions if not happy with child's sex." Still a third article carried the caption: "Generation gap exaggerated, says association of retired." 

Father Robert Griffin 
letters to a Lonely God 
were looking for hiding places 
from the stark realism of the 
real world. 

I'm not apologizing for being a conservative old fart critical of the Surgeon General's re­commendation to Congress. Why can't he see that the sexual revolution is killing us? 
Last night's newscast showed a scene from a prime time sit­uation comedy: good old Valerie discovers her I 7-year­old son has just bought con­doms for a date with his 

I'm not going to comment on the possibility of a gap be­tween the college generation and my own. I'm out of step with a lot of folks these days. I'm not too old to know what a condom is. In the big public high school I attended as a Protestant kid In the early 1940s, we knew quite a lot about sex and condoms. The disease we worried about was syphilis --then considered incurable--and dangerous enough to kill you with soften­ing of the brain. 
World War II was raging, and the town was used as a naval base. 50,000 sailors nearly doubled the population of that New England port of call. Some of the high school girls dated the sailors, and a number of them lived to regret it. 
Sexuality kept none of its secrets from us; none of us girlfriend. Valerie is shocked; her ritual protestations have the sound of Tevye and Golda in Fiddler: "Is this the little girl I carried? Is this the little boy at prayer? Why didn't I see them getting older... " Her final words are those of Mom as a real great sport. "It's okay. You're a responsible son. YOU'RE HAVING SAFE SEX." 
At this point, in my day, Mickey Rooney as young Andy Hardy would have had a heart­to-heart talk with his wise fa­ther, the judge. The bottom line today is "Safe Sex." The parent who gives his or her grudging approval to a teen­ager having sex as long as he promises to use a condom is like the parent allowing a ten­year-old to take the family car as long as he promises not to drink while driving. Drunk or sober, a ten-year-old shouldn't
