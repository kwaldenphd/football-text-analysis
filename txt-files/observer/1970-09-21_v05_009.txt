to thank the faculty for making

is a four story hall which 
serves as a house for 30 seniors and 6 sophomores. The girls prefer referring to Augusta as a 
"house." They feel that it gives them a great deal more freedom in a more eomforta ble and re­laxed atmosphere. 
As a result of the small number of students residing there, the house is spacious enough to include a completely

The Soviets did not announce immediately details of_ what tasks Luna 16 would perform or whetehr it would attempt a re­
turn to earth, the first evr crachieved by an automatic craft from the surface of a celestial body. 
Tass said the spacecraft "has starkd making studies of the moon's surface." It pinpointed the landing spot in sclcnographic coordinates as 0 degrees 41 minutes south latitude and 56 degre~.:s 18 minutes cast long­itude.. 
Luna 16 was launched a week ago Saturday and was guided into lunar orbit lat~.: in th~.: week hy Soviet space controllers.

Hodgson also estimated that about one third of current un­employment was the result of defense spending cuts rather than the general slump in busi­ness. In that connedion, he said, the average period of idleness for jobless workers in recent months was eight to nine weeks, while the average in 1958 and 1961 was 17 weeks or longer. 
Although there is a great deal of "transitional unemploy­ment," Hougson said, there also are "areas where there are rather deep and rather substantial un­employment." He said the Labor D~.:partment had already set aside $25 million in manpower training funds for the seven most distressed states California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Rhode Island, Maine and Michigan-to pay for public ser­vice employment and additional job skill training programs.

Draft deemed more discriminatory 
By Mike Keefer 
Although the army contains all minority groups blacks are the largest and will be con­
sidered here. Presently, the per­centage of black Americans en­listed in the armed forces is I0.5, or less than the percentage in the national population. Ad­mittedly, when drafted blacks are counted, the percentage is much higher, but this is because the black man rarely has the opportunity for deferments that is afforded white youths. How­ever, in an all-volunteer force, this increase would be erased, since all would be in the military by choice alone. The argument that an increase in benefits would appeal solely to blacks is unfounded, because there are millions of other Americans whose economic status would make an improved military life very attractive. Ther President recently s~d, "It supposes that raising military pay would in some way slow up or stop the flow of white volunteers even as it stepped up the flow of black volunteers. Most of our volun­teers now are white. Better pay and better conditions would ob­viously make military service more attractive to black and white alike." Certainly the per­centage of blacks would rise a little, but not much above the national average. Also, black leadeJrs are attempting to per­suade young blacks against fight­ing in a predominantly white army for what they describe as white causes-with some success. 

The Gates Commission coverage of this question is quite goo, and for further insight it should be referred to. 
I think the suggestion that an all-volunteer army would even­tually pose a threat to our free­dom is completely without sub­stance. Briefly, the feeling is that once there is a large military 
eOIMn t'l' In~ ~ht 
force in this country made up of volunteers, their allegiance would shift more to their im­mediate military leaders than to civilian authority. Then, at an opportune time, top-ranking of­ficers could simply employ their men, occupy public places, and seize power. Those who support such a position invariably draw 

Cairo police chief resigns 
CAIRO, ILL. (UPI) -Police Chief Roy Burke, citing a "grow­ing cancerous situatio ·1 in Cairo," handed in his resignation Satur­day night at a meeting of the city council. 
"As the administrator of the Cairo Police Department these past seven months," Burke said in his letter of resignation, "I have witnessed a growing cancer­ous situation in Cairo. This con­dition of frustration, fear, de­pression and near economic bankruptcy of the community has caused many citizens to ad­vocate violence, hatred and ani­mosity toward his fellow man in comparisons to Latin Ar.1erican governments, which change quite often. However, a political 
scientist or an historian looking 
at the comparison would reveal a 
different conclusion. 
To begin with, in Latin Am­
erica we are discussing govern­
ments that are at most unstable. 
For centuries, their leaders ·have 
risen and fallen depending on 
military support. Furthermore, 
the population of such countries 
has a history of low economic 
stature, and for this reason 
quickly shift support if promises 
are not kept or more illusory 
ones made. On a more ethnic 
note, only the Spanish people 
have the peculiar characteristic 
known as "castillo"-they are 
uneasy by nature. 
Certainly, none of these quali­
ties seem applicable to our way 
of life. Indeed, if there was ever 
one characteristic of the Ameri­
can military, it is that the mili­
tary has been a tool of the people, subject to civilian con-trol-including the times when have long been commanded by career officers. And, as Pres. Nixon points out, "a coup would necessarily come from the top officer ranks, not from the enlisted ranks, arid we already have a career-officer corps. It is hard to see how replacing draftees with volunteers would make officers more influential." I can't see that conscript armies would be less susceptible to a coup than one consisting of volunteers, and I cite the recent takeover in Greece as an ex­ample. 
The problem of the cost of an all volunteer army I consider least important. Estimates range upwards to $17 billion per year with no one able to really ap­proximate well because of the obviously hypothetical nature of the problem. The Gates Com­mission did a great deal of re­search and came up with the figure of $3.3 billion increase in the Defense budget for the year such a program would go into 
our army was all volunteer r------·-------~ 
(pre-1948 and peace years). Pe­culiar to the American people is a fierce love of the freedoms guarenteed them by the consti­tution. In fact, so jealous are we of those freedoms that we have gone so far recently as to deprive others of their rights only to exert our own. It's truly difficult to imagine a nation of 200 mil­lion people, bred in a revolution of blood, submitting to any force-be it external or internal.

·····················The Academic Council 
Besides discussion of a possible political recess next month, Notre Dame's Academic Council meets 
this afternoon to discuss student membership on that body. Having worked under this system in our 
community government at St. Mary's, we students can testify to both its worth and its potential val~c. 
Once a structure is established, however, as ours was just three years ago, it is imperative to realize that our efforts are not rewarded; they must just now begin. Formal acceptance of a system docs not come with the nod of approval by the Board of Trustees, but comes insll!ad with the institutionalization of that structure as a valid, operating reality. Before this process can be completed at St. Mary's we Will have to resolve deficiencies that are present in three general areas. 
Institutionalization must initially involve recognition and acceptance of the system by all facets in the college: students, faculty, and administration. This necessarily implies a willingness to work through the structure as it is set up (i.e. tri-partite consideration of legislation and policy). _ 
Secondly, each segment must accept not only its own role and responsibility in com mumty government, but that of the other segments of the college as well. This means there m~st be mutua trust, respect, and honesty for the achievement of any substantial progress. In ke~pmg w1th ou responsibility this year, students hope to help establish procedures for their comnut~ces t_ha_t WI encourage a fair exchange, as well as actively contribute to solutions for issues under the Junsdtctton ' their committees. 
Finally there must exist a continuous flow of opennes.~ and cooperation; without it there can be r 
effective ~nd beneficial evolution of the college as a truly educational institution. 
Is it not the role of a college or university to instill in the student not just the love of learning, but tt 
desire to apply it to, and participate in, his or her world? If so, it is only reasonable that she be allowec 
to make an active transition from theory to application with guidance and experience of faculty an( 
administration. Why stop an education half way?

"No I'm n<>t a Certified Public Accountant, damnlt!" 
Campus Opinion 
(The fallowing was submitted by Walt Secada and Lance Blasius.) 
Most of this country's people are loosing touch with the complex 
problems facing them. The conservative has committed himself to 
solving the problems through a set of "traditional" American values. 
The liberal wishes to confront these in the perspective of a different 
value system. Many radicals have moved from these positions to a 
nihilistic view which denies that there can be anything good in the 
status quo. The problem with all these views is that they attempt to 
solve problems of practical judgement from an intangible personal 
basis. 
Unfortunately, most decisions in government and all societies 
spring from other than moral considerations. They issue from other 
forces and presssures-notably pragmatic in nature. Here, the radical 
often offers a more honest interpretation to the problems in that he 
recognizes the limitations inherent in proffering simplistic individual 
answers to their resolution, when the extremely intricate society of 
which the problems are symptomatic will not permit such analysis. 
The recognition of one's failures in such attempts is pard mount in 
any form of self-criticism. Furthermore, one can then extend these 
views to the purposeful machinations of society -hence the term 
"institutionalized." 
Whereas the obvious faults of our institutions should be exposed, 
and the situation rectifies, the very people qualified to some degree 
to undertake such a task become lost -denying the "exi~tence of 
problems which do not allow analysis, being unsure of the "proper" 
plan and hence wanting more time for study, or saying that the 
momentum renders the problem unsolvable. 
We will confine ourselves to those who are lost because of 
excessive guilt feelings. They are unsure of exactly what their role is 
since they come from a background which has either directly or 
indirectly contributed to the problem. 
Examples abound. 

Malcolm X, in his autobiography, writes of a white college girl 
who was so shook up after hearing him speak that she followed him 
from Boston to New York to ask: "What can I do?" His first reply 
was: "nothing". After going to Mecca, he continues, he wished that 
he could see her again to tell her that she did have a place in the 
black man's struggle. Her job would be to fight racism wherever and 
however she could in her situation in life. This shows a certain 
duality. 
First, the rightful rage felt by Malcolm X was misdirected at one 
who truly wished to help. Her place in life could not be helped and 
tl:e problem was to go from that point on to what she could do. 
Second, we all have a role to play in the radical restructuring of this 
complex society. For unless we all participate, the solutions tend to 
b~come polarized and simplistic. This role, moreover, mu~t be realisitcally defined. Where a vacuum exists, one could play a stop-gap role defering. to a "better qualified person" when the time comes. 
For example, in lieu of a "suitable" spokesman for any group, no one should have to apologize for expounding the views of say the black man, women's liberation or the oppression of the Third World. Translating the rhetoric of the "revolutionary" to the language used by "the people" is another task. Indeed, one criticism of the revolutionary is that he gets so caught up in his own rhetoric that no one else understands. 
Black studies are sorely needed. While blacks are the most qualified to teach any course in this field, refusal to admit that some whites could have some taste for black culture which is fit for sharing smacks of elitisw. To make an analogy: to learn the basics of poetry one does not need a specialist. Indeed, to place him in such a position is a waste of his time. Rather, someone whose expertise matches the need is given the post. Then the expert refines the notions and builds upon what was learned. This does not mean that we settle for a second-rate individual. Rather we use him where he does the most good -or the least harm, depending on one's perspective. 
Essentially, our thesis has been the recognition of failure is necessary. But allowing oneself to become prey to guilt or rage is self defeating. Both arise from the attempt to apply a simplistic moral approach to problems which arise because society knows no morality. What is needed, rather, is a frank evaluation of what role one can play in the move to liberate us from ourselves.

by Denn.. Wll AnotherMan's Country 

Observ Fonlp COtTespo.-.nt 
SALZBURG, AUSTRIA -Living in another man's country is a different experience. You eat new foods (teaming that hamburgers and pizza are uniquely American while coke is universal), wear clothes that label you as a foreigner, and you find-the most poignant of all your discoveries-that you cannot communicate with another human being. Depending on the language, a resident in a foreign country may get by with pig-English ("Me want go hotel") or he may be reduced to grunts and gestures in order to indicate what he desires. In any case, one is never completely assured that one's new-found friend has even the vaguest idea of what one wishes to say. You may ask for a restaurant and get a house of ill repute-which really isn't all that bad, come to think of it, unless you are a woman. Then, you might have problems. 
Living in another man's country involves a certain sense of history. You have to live with what your country has done to his country, like in the latest world war-and you find that maybe he isn't exactly convinced that it was his side that started the whole dam thing anyway. One elderly woman told me that the future holds no suprises for her, because "It doesn't matter who comes into our country, the Russians or the Americans. The Americans have done their share of bombing, too." Right then it was time to say something to the effect that it would be nice it everybody stayed in their own country and left the other guy alone, that the world would be a far better place if we learned that other people have the same powers of reason and insight that have been given to all men, that other men have the intelligence, indeed, the responsibility, to choose their own course of action. 
How to be an American abroad without being obtrusive and without becoming a European: that is the dilemma. It is hard to decide which is more despicable: an American who shoves his nationality, boorishly, to the forefront, or one who affects the mannerisms of an Englishman or some other foolish thing. Mark Twain once wrote about an American who was exhibiting bad manners abroad: "This fellow said: 'I am a freeborn sovereign, sir, an American, sir, and I want everybody to know it.' He did not mention that he was a lineal decendant of Balaam 's ass, but everybody knew that without his telling it." Some might consider the other course; that is, to "drop" one's nationality for the sake of making it comfortably in another land. This might seem to be practical and realistic, until one experiences the indignation of being given the finger by a woman driving along in her little car as one tries to hitch-like I said, Europeans are old pros at spotting Americans. The best course to take is not to push your Americanism, certainly, but not to forget it either for we are what we are, in spite of ourselves. To put it simply: one has to be oneself. Without affectations and without a false sense of superiority, even Americans are accepted by the world. Which says something about the world, perhaps; or perhaps says something about the Americans. 
One final observation about living outside your own borders for a time-you learn that people are people. National characteristics are nonexistent. If you have heard some sayings to the effect that "this people is friendly," or "that people is well--mannered" or "Europeans as a whole are more cultured than Americans," forget them. They are lies. It is as though one were to declare that "Southerners are bigots," or "Blacks are shiftless"-people are people. Black or white, European or American, we are all shaped by time and by fate, and by the same, all-encompassing human condition-we all eat, itch, sleep, drink, make love, and defecate. Not in that order, necessarily, but we all do these things. If you let yourself be guided by general description of a people which has been pronounced by whoever it is who makes up such lies, you will find yourself a fool. Worse than that, you will find yourself a disillusioned fool, for nothing and no one will ever be as you think they should. Think of Frenchmen as being nothing more than people who speak French, for example, and then you will be well-prepared to decide for yourself, and on your own terms, whether there are such ridiculous things as "national characteristics." If you lose pre-conceived notions about others, they wili do the same for you. It is that simple. And the next time someone tries to force-feed you that drivel about "culture" and "manners being the exclusive property of Europeans", ask him if he has ever tried to use the bathroon in a French train station. 

Ghost of Barnum Alive at Notre Dame 
The ghost of huckerstering P. T. Bar­num was resurrected over the weekend, and joined Fr. Sorin, the Gipper, Bass 
Rumore and other famous phantoms in floating around Notre Dame this week­end. The center of this particular spiritual gyre was the Athletic and Convocation Cetner where the Ringling Brothers put up their tents. 
It was the one hundredth Anniversary. That was very important. It was the hundredth anniversary of Barnum or cir­cuses or the Ringling Barnum -Bailey merger of corporationf or something. You weren't supposed to worry about it. It was just there, in big, circus-red letters. One hundred. 
One hundred years is a good age for 'most anything; very few institutions are so unperishable. One hundred years is a particularly good age for childhood, and for childhood's end. 
A circus is for seven-year-olds. 
Seven is a goodod nhmber to be. When you're seven, the whole world's a fruit­cake. The good guys are mommy and daddy and Uncle George and here. The Bad Guys are dripping disgustingly and are there. And good is an icc cream cone. And bad is a spanking. 
How many seven-year-olds want to run away and join the circus? I don't know. A whole bunch. Water the elephants, huge and majestic. Train the horses, pure and beautiful. Be a clown; wear a gay and happy smile every minute you're out there. Or stick out your tongue at death on the flying trapeeze. 
The circus revisited isn't the same. No, more than that, it's a crude and frighten­ing parody. The elephants are not huge and majestic, but massive and smelly. The horses are snappish and their coats are spotty. The only gay people are running a liberation campaign. And the men on the flying trapeeze continue to defy death, but what was courage eleven years ago is maudlin exhibitionism now. 

Pretense is no fun anymore; not if your best friend's pregnant and looking for an abortion and the g.irl down the hall is doing drugs. This place --St. Mary's-­Notre Dame is is childhood's end; Away from the Apron Strings becomes Better Run Through the Jungle. And it's fright­ening. And it's sad. 
Go to the circus. Close your eyes. Reopen them. Clos~ them again. Open them again. They refuse to focus like they did when you were seven. The candy cotton has a sickly taste, and it isn't sweet anymore. 
There was a basketball game with all the players riding unicycles. They were good. They were very good. And we could gawk at them for a long time, because people aren't supposed to play baksetball on unicycles. So have we de­fied nature? Hip, hip, hurrah, P. T.; you 
have brought down the gods in humble 
abayance! And now, for your next act, 
will you eliminate He:ll? 
The clowns were the saddest things. 
Old and sad, they ambled around with 
painted smiles on their faces. There are 
precious few satisfactions in that. One 
sells his time and ta.lent. Not the things 
that make him a man. 
But for a seven-ye:ar-old, the circus is 
the epitome of all that is good! 

There were an awful lot of seven-year­aids of all chronological ages at the circus last night, as there are at the circus every night. The stare with vacant eyes at the lion tamer sticking his head through the toothless gums. Mangy cats go through the paces. Close your eyes and pretend the tiger really ate twelve maharajahs instead of eminently butcherable horse: meat. Or watch the ·elephants. The circus is a step crueller than the zoo; in the zoo the animals are merely limited in that which they are able to do; in the circus, they are put through paces totally alien to their natures. Pretend the animals don't wish they were dead. 
Folk Festival pleasant, unstartli1g 
by Lefty Ruschmann 
A football weekend at Notre Dame! Halls look like mausoleums and people like gypsies. The entire student body has holed up in their rooms. The near­est girl is the one from back East and 
Oops, this an away football weekend. It's one of those autumnal tinie warps where nothing happens, nothing is planned, and the lucky ones are out of here for the weekend. 
Fortunately, the student union took heart and pitied the lost souls of du Lac, offering an evening of free folk music. The entertainment, which lasted more tha.1 three hours, drew an overflow crowd to the hot, stuffy ballroom of the Stu­dent Center. Appearing in an informal concert atmosphere were many regulars of the campus coffeehouse circuit. Des­pite some small difficulties with the lights, and a microphone system which makes a Stentorian voice sound like a mumble, few in the audience (whose diversity and overall enthusiasm were surprising) seemed to mind. 
The program was opened by Ellen 

Zurikert, whose pleasant rendition of 
current folk songs went over well. I 
cannot say the same of the fellow who 
followed her on stage. In fact, I wound 
up retreating to my room and watching 
the Giants and Bears attempt to play 
football. However, there were few 
attempts by the rest of the acts to 

persuade me to catch the Creature Fea­
ture on T.V. 
Lew McKenzie didn't mention that the 
New York Thruway was closed, or that 
there were a lot of freaks out there 

(which there weren't) but he still did a 
convincing imitation of Arlo Guthrie's 
"Coming Into Los Angeles.'' His polished 
style also did justice to the songs of the 

Credence Clearwater Revival. Much of Rick Homan's "usual" material was used by acts which preceded him; nevertheless he pleased the crowd with selections from Tom Paxton, and a rendition of "Ferry Cross the Mersey," theme song of what some critics consider the crummiest film made in the middle '60s. 
Closing my eyes during Patty Larkin's performance, I heard a reasonably good (approximation) of the Joni Mitchell style-sweet and poetic. Patty was by far the best female singer of the evening. 
But my personal favorites were Paul Guernsey and Jim Moran. They do blue grass music and do in a way you cannot help but enjoy. Guernsey plays one of the best banjos around and his guitar work is remarkable. Their version of "Foggy Mountain Breakdown," '*hich has almost become a Guernsey & Knorr trademark, evoked a well-earne:d roar from the audience, proving that I was not alone in my opinion of this talented duo. 
Admittedly, many attended the con­cert because it was not only free, but there were few, if any, activities schedul­ed over the weekend. A privileged few had dates to bring, but the majority came to La Fortune alone (maybe they could not stomach yet another football game that evening.) Those who attended came back at least satisfied with the show; the few who didn't were not taken for any of their money. 
Obviously the caliber of entertainment hardly equalled the major-league talent on display at the Convo concerts, but at least those who came to La Fortune were in a free and casual mood. For once, the atmosphere of a musical event did not stand in the way of a good time. The Student Union might, in planning Social Commission events, keep this fact in mind this year.
