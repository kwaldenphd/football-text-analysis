Students vvrite to troops 
Letters from SMC try to boost morale of Iraq soldiers 
By MICHELLE EGGERS 
News Writer 
The McCandless Hall Council "Letters to Troops" project aims to boost moral for the Alpha Company spending this holiday season in Iraq by having Saint Mary's students write letters to the 66 troops. 
"It's great for us to realize there arc so many Americans over there fighting that will be gone during the holiday season," McCandless llall vice president Jennifer Pillar said. 
"They should know we are supporting them." 
According to McCandless Hall director Christine Artz, the idea originated as a serv­ice project for the hall. 
"We thought is would be a nice moral booster for the troops to get mail," she said. 
Through the hall project, the council already sent the company 19 letters on Nov. 9, Artz said. The community's positive reaction to the proj­ect spurred the council to open it to the entire campus.

Transgendered activist tells story 
Bergman presents anecdotes ofgender identity and confusion 
By MEGHAN MARTIN Associate News Editor 
Transgendered writer and activist S. Bear Bergman visited Notre Dame yesterday to per­form "Ex Post Papa: Life as a Freelance Dyke Dad," a multimedia presentation billed in its promotional material as "theater about men­turing, gender and getting your parenting a Ia carte." 
A dramatic monologue of a string of anec­dotes set against a backdrop of black-and­white photographs taken by Bergman's wife Nicole. the performance pulled together Bergman's experiences as a mentor and advi­sor, or Ex Post Papa, to friends living outside the world of "straight society." 
Bergman's first task was to clarify the mean­ing of gender and its greater implications. 
"I am definitely of the opinion that there are more genders than just male or female," Bergman said. "I don't identify myself as a woman. I identify myself as transgendered. To be transgendered is to transcend, transgress ... to cross genders. Someone who is transgen­dered crosses our cultural concept of genders." 
Dressed in khakis, a brown shirt and a pale yellow necktie, Bergman addressed the issues facing transgendcred people in today's hetero­sexual society, from deciding whether to use the men's or women's restroom to utilizing the proper pronouns when referring to their own identities. 
"People look, don't they? They stare, espe­cially when I get close to the bathroom ... Don't think it doesn't hurt," Bergman said during the performance, a picture of a bathroom sign pro­jected on the back wall of the stage. "Wearing a hat? Or a tie? The little skirt-wearing girl does­n't wear a hat-or a tie. The little pant-legged boy does." 
In a talkback session with audience members following the performance, Bergman discussed the way in which something as simple as pro­noun usage is influenced by our two-gender

INSIDE COLUMN 
Praising Dean 

I like Howard Dean. 
That is not to say that I think the shoot-from-the-hip Vermonter is the nonpareil of Democratic candidates, or that I believe his platform is entirely unsullied. 
In fact, Dean's Beth Erickson only irrefutable selling point is Wire Editor 
that he isn't Bush. 
So what catapults him to the top of the list of contestants for Bush Whack 2004? In the words of his opponents: shock and awe. 
In the midst of high finance cam­paigning and mindless moralistic jar­gon, Dean's grassroots approach and outspoken intellect certainly aston­ish. 
However, Dean's shock value does not reside in his characteristic blunt­ness, but rather in his unexpectedly middle-of-the-road mixture of social progressivism and moderate eco­nomic stance. 
Despite the image that the GOP would love to project, Dean is a far cry from a bleeding-heart liberal. He exempts himself from extremes, rebuking liberals and conservatives alike. 
He rejects the tax-and-spending of liberal democrats, asserting that fis­cal conservatism is crucial for the realization of his social reforms. 
Americans have become accus­tomed to politicians who sit the fence and let their Teleprompter speak for them in fear of malapropisms and misinformation. Dean's frank deliv­ery reminds us of that which the American political sphere revolves around -intellectual contention. 
He's admittedly headstrong. Opinionated. Even arrogant. But should the leader of a world super­power be a weak, mindless pushover? 
In addition to his intelligence and can-do attitude, I like Dean's princi­ples and his staunch adherence to them. 
Most significantly, I applaud Dean for his proposals to promote the rights of homosexuals and to reform the overzealous system of capital punishment in America. 
Finally, I appreciate the fact that he did not support Bush's war against Iraq. While Dean supported the disarmament of Iraq and the ousting of Saddam Hussein, he per­ceived that America was not in immediate danger and that we were not prepared to help Iraqis once we won the war. 
And he was right. 
Now that we have alienated our­selves from our allies and have left an entire country in a state of disso­lution, and now that we know that our entire populace was duped into believing in non-existent nukes, we need a new man in charge. 
America needs to renew its focus on social justice and peaceful inter­vention, and Dean might just be the man to get the ball rolling.

Glow-In-the-dark pet fish coming soon 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. ­The nation's first genetical­ly altered household pet ­a fish that glows in the dark -is set to begin appearing in stores next month everywhere except perhaps California, the only state with a ban on lab-engineered species. 
On Wednesday, the California Fish and Game Commission is scheduled to take up an application from Yorktown Technolo­gies of Austin, Texas, to market the GloFish in California. 
State wildlife officials 
have concluded that the Florida-grown fluorescent zebra fish poses no danger, and they have recommend­ed that the state exempt it from the ban. But environ­mental and public interest groups, along with com­mercial fishermen, oppose an exemption.

Larkey plans a similar line of drinks for cats, in roast chicken and pork fla­vors early next year.

society, replacing the accepted 'he' and 'she' with 'ze.' while 'his' and 'her' were replaced with 'hir.' 
"It's not that I'm against pro­nouns," Bergman said, "as long as people understand what my gender is. I definitely use pro­nouns as a teaching tool ... I enforce pronouns when I feel it's useful for people to talk about the concept of non-standard gender." 
Bergman was asked after the performance to define non-stan­dard gender, and the use of the word 'queer' throughout the monologue to identify people who identified themselves as non­homosexuals. 
"The handy thing about the word 'queer' is that it's the least descriptive and the least proscrip­tive word we have," Bergman said. "Using the word 'queer' to describe a non-standard set of sexual behavior and desires is a way to describe something that is not only a sexual orientation, but also a cultural orientation." 
Bergman went on to recount something that a "smart friend" once said. 
"I use it whenever I can: 'To be queer is to pursue your harmless heart's desire in a society that will punish you for it,"' Bergman said. "Queer, for me, is also describing the cultural and political orienta­tion that goes along with being

Russia against Kyoto Protocol 
MOSCOW -In what would be a mortal blow to the accord aimed at halting global warming, a top Kremlin official said Tuesday that Hussia won't ratify the Kyoto Protocol limiting greenhouse gas emissions because it will hurt the country's economy. 
The United States rejected the accord for the same reason. Without Moscow, the proto­col cannot come into effect even if approved by every other nation because only Russia's industrial emissions are large enough to tip the balance. 
The pollution cuts required by the treaty would slow the economic growth that President Vladimir Putin has made a major priority. said top adviser Andrei Illarionov. 
"In its current form, the Kyoto Protocol places significant limitations on the economic growth of Hussia." Illarionov told reporters in the Kremlin on the sidelines of Putin's meeting with European business leaders. "Of course, in its current form this protocol can't be ratified." 
Loyalty to Hussein declining 
BAGIIIJAD. Iraq -Workers began demol­ishing gigantic bronze busts of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on Tuesday, while U.S. troops to the north arrested at least 20 insurgents in a raid -both moves aimed at stamping out loyalty to Iraq's ousted regime. 
Iraqi police said a senior former member of Saddam's elite Hcpublican Guard was among those captured in Ilawija, 155 miles north of Baghdad. However, the U.S. troops failed to catch the target of the raid -lzzat Ibrahim ai-Douri, considered a key planner of attacks against U.S. troops.

Court debates warrant serving 
WASHINGTON -After knocking, police don't have to wait longer than 20 seconds before breaking into the home of a drug sus­pect, a unanimous Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in a case involving a man who said he needed more time to get from the shower to the door. 
LaShawn Banks emerged soapy and naked to find masked, heavily armed officers searching for drugs in his Las Vegas apart­ment in 1998. His case gave the court its first opportunity to say how long police must wait before breaking into a home to serve a war­rant. 
The court didn't set a specific standard but said the brief delay in the Banks case was long enough. Any more time would give drug suspects an opportunity to flush evidence down the toilet.

Man arrested for kidnapping 
Alfonso Rodriguez in custody for the alleged kidnapping ofNorth Dakota student 
Associated Press 

GRAND FOHKS, N.D. ­A man described by authorities as a predatory sex offender was arrested and charged with kidnap­ping in the disappearance of a college student. But authorities said Tuesday the young woman was still missing. 
Dru Sjodin, 22, a University of North Dakota student from Pequot Lakes, Minn .. vanished Nov. 22 after leaving her job at the Victoria's Secret at Columbia Mall in Grand Forks. 
"Dru. we will find you," Grand Forks Police Chief John Packett said at a briefing Tuesday. "With the arrest of Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. last night, this investi­gation has only reached the 50-yard line. As addi­tional charges and infor­mation comes available, we will not be satisfied or comforted until such time as we find Dru." 
Rodriguez. 50, was arrested Monday in Crookston. Minn., about 30 miles from Grand Forks, where he lives, police said. He had been expected to appear in court Tuesday, but officials said the appearance would be delayed until Wednesday morning. Court documents in the case were sealed. 
Authorities declined to 
. discuss what led them to Rodriguez, other than to say they had probable cause to believe he was in the mall parking lot the day Sjodin disappeared and to note it is standard to look at known sex offenders in such investi­gations. They declined to say whether he was coop­erating. "Our entire focus on this is in finding Dru," Grand Forks County state's attor­ney Peter Welte said. "This is by no means the end. This is a marathon and not a sprint." Authorities issued a plea for at least 1,000 volun­teers to search for Sjodin Wednesday in Grand Forks County and in Polk County, Minn., where Crookston is 

located. Property owners in the two counties were asked to search their land. 
Sjodin's father and brother spoke directly to their sister. 
"Honey, we will find you," her father, Allan, said. And her brother, Sven, added: "I know we are just around the corner from you right now. We love you. Keep strong." 
Rodriguez has a history of sexual contact and attempted kidnapping with adult women, and has used a weapon in at least one assault, according to a Minnesota Department of Corrections summary of his criminal history posted on the agency's Web site. 
His past offenses require that Rodriguez be regis­tered as a predatory offender, the department said. 
Authorities said Sjodin (pronounced sha DEEN) may have been abducted while talking to her boyfriend, Chris Lang, on a cell phone after leaving work the afternoon of Nov. 
22. He called her room­mate, saying he heard Sjodin say something like, "Oh, my God," before the phone went dead. During a second call a few hours later, there, was only the sound of static and num­bers being pressed, he said. 
The case had drawn more than 1,300 volun­teers who have searched the area without success. In addition, about 30 FBI agents, along with investi­gators from 20 different agencies in three states and the Canadian province of Manitoba, were working on the case. A $140,000 reward was offered. 
Neighbors of Hodriguez said a town meeting was held in May to inform them about his release from prison. They said he lived with his mother, Dolores. No one answered the phone at the home Monday night. 
Sonja Thygeson, who lives about four houses down from Rodriguez and his mother, said she's never seen him do any­thing wrong, but took pre­cautions anyway. 
"I'm a widow and I'm older, and I was scared, so I had my son-in-law come over and install a motion light after he (Rodriguez) moved in," Thygeson said. 
Another neighbor, Milton Stave, said "there were a lot of frightened people around" when Rodriguez returned to the community. 
Ohio highway shootings connected 
Associated Press 

COLUMBUS, Ohio -Twelve shoot­ings along a five-mile stretch of inter­state this year are connected, includ­ing one that killed a woman, police said Tuesday. 
Four of the shootings -three at vehicles and the one that broke an elementary school window last month -were from the same gun, Franklin County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Steve Martin said. 
Although ballistics tests could not link the remainder of the shootings along Interstate 270, investigators said they "are comfortable" saying all 12 are connected, he said. He would not elaborate. 
The shootings began in May along Interstate 270 in southern Columbus. On Nov. 25, 62-year-old Gail Knisley was struck by a bullet that pierced the side of the car she was in. Many previous shootings have been report­ed since then. 
Authorities, who have received more than 500 tips, would not specu­late on whom the shooter might be and would not release the type of weapon. 
"Collectively, we think it's not good for us to put that information out," Martin said. 
Local businesses have established a $10,000 reward for information lead­ing to an arrest. 
Investigators on Monday linked the Nov. 11 shooting at Hamilton Township Elementary School to the others -making it the 12th shooting police announced in the case. 
The school in Obetz is about two miles from the freeway. Superinten­dent Bill Wittman said he believes the shooting was not meant to harm any­one because it happened overnight. 
A house was shot at Tuesday near the freeway that circles Columbus, but investigators have not linked it to the other shootings, Martin said.

Suspected terrorist gets lawyer access 
Pentagon announces that U.S.-born suspect Hamdi will be allowed full lawyer, trial rights 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Reversing course, Pentagon officials have decided to allow a U.S.-born ter­rorism suspect access to a lawyer, the Defense Department announced Tuesday. 
The Defense Department will make arrangements over the next few days for a lawyer to visit Yaser Esam Hamdi "subject to appropriate security restric­tions," a Pentagon statement said. Hamdi is being held as an "enemy combatant," a designa­tion the Bush administration says denies him rights to a lawyer or a trial. 
The Supreme Court is consid­ering whether to hear an appeal from a public defender, Frank Dunham, who challenged had been born in Louisiana and therefore is a U.S. citizen. 
The Pentagon statement said that allowing Hamdi access to a lawyer "is not required by domestic or international law and should not be treated as a precedent." 
Officials decided to grant the access to a lawyer because Hamdi is a U.S. citizen and the military has fmished interrogat­ing him, the Pentagon statement said. Hamdi has not been charged with any crime. 
The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., reject­ed Dunham's appeal challenging his detention, ruling that the president has wide powers to detain enemy combatants during wartime. The Bush administra­tion argues that under internation­

The Pentagon announcement came one day before the Bush administration was scheduled to file a response at the Supreme Court to that appeal. 
Hamdi will be allowed to decide whether he wants to meet with Dunham, a military lawyer or a private attorney, said Air Force Maj. John Smith, a spokesman for the Defense Department's legal office. 
Hamdi is being held in the U.S. Navy brig in Charleston, S.C. He was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001.

SUV safety set to improve 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The auto industry is adopting stan­dards to improve the safety of vehicles in side-impact crashes over the next five years. 
The Washington-based Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which repre­sents 10 automakers, plans to announce the commitment Thursday. The standards are voluntary, but automakers are expected to implement them by 2009. 
Alliance spokesman Eron Shosteck said Tuesday that automakers adopted a set of performance standards that can be met through a variety of safety devices, including side-impact air bags and improved door beams and bumpers. 
Shosteck said most automakers will be able to meet the new standards by adopting side-and head-pro­tecting air bags. Automakers also may make design changes to the front of sport utility vehicles so there is a lesser height difference in collisions with passenger cars. 
The Alliance and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is funded by insurers, promised to develop the voluntary standards in February in a letter to Dr. Jeffrey Runge, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
Some safety groups have argued against voluntary standards, saying they hold no weight because automak­ers can choose not to adopt them. 
Runge has said volunt:. y standards can bring safety enhancements to the market more quickly, since the gov­~rnment's regulatory process can require years. Shosteck said the Alliance planned to send the automakers' offer to Runge on Tuesday.

IN BRIEF 
Investor Kerkorian takes stand 
WILMINGTON, Del. -Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian testified Tuesday that he never would have supported the deal creating DaimlerChrysler if it had not been portrayed as a "merger of equals" between the American and German automakers. 
Kerkorian, who is suing the company for more than $1 billion, said that in his dealings with former Chrysler chairman Robert Eaton there was no indication the Daimler Benz­Chrysler combination was anything else. 
"It was called a merger of equals .... It was always called a merger of equals," Kerkorian testified in federal court in the nonjury trial. 
Kerkorian. whose Tracinda Corp. was the largest Chrysler shareholder at the time of the merger, claims Daimler-Benz officials secretly organized a Chrysler takeover while proposing a merger of equals. 
As a result, Kerkorian claims, Daimler-Benz avoided paying him an acquisition fee of up to 62 percent on his stock when the companies merged. Kerkorian owned 14 percent of Chrysler's stock at the time. 
Invesco charged with fraud 
NEW YOHK -Regulators charged lnvesco Funds Group and its chief executive with civil fraud Tuesday in the rapidly expanding mutu­al fund trading scandal. 
In separate filings, New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Haymond Cunningham and his Denver-based company of defrauding shareholders by allowing cer­tain big clients to engage in market timing ­frequent, short-term trading that skimmed profits from long-term shareholders. 
lnvesco Funds denied any wrongdoing and said it would vigorously contest any charges against the company or its employees. A call to Cunningham's lawyer was not immediately returned. 
Hegulators are expected to seek the return of more than $160 million in ill-gotten gains, plus other damages and civil penalties. 
The investigation of the mutual fund indus­try has already resulted in complaints against other well-known fund companies, including Putnam Investments and the Pilgrim Baxter fund family. 
Steelworkers protest policies 
President visits Pittsburgh for fund raiser as workers rally to keep steel tariff 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON­
President Bush may be fol­
lowing the course of least 
political resistance by lift­
ing the steel tariffs he 
imposed in March 2002. 
The duties on imported steel probably seemed like a good idea at the time. They enabled Bush, with an eye toward the 2004 electoral map, to extend a helping hand to a belea­guered major U.S. industry. Since then, however, the tariffs have turned into a huge policy headache for him both at home and abroad. 
By ending the tariffs, as is widely expected, Bush risks angering steel makers and their workers in vital electoral states including Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indi­ana and West Virginia. 
But analysts suggest leaving them in place could risk even more by sparking a global trade war and unleashing punitive duties against a range of American goods from yet another set of battleground states. 
Such a trade war could threaten the fledgling U.S. eco'nomic recovery and squelch the recent stock market rally.

This was a holiday to remember 
This last Thanksgiving holiday is one that I will not soon forget-at least not in the span of the next 24 hours because I went from seeing America at its best to America at its worst. 
To be perfectly 

Joe Licandro
honest, last Thursday was shaping up to be 

The Licandro 
just like any other turkey day. Like Non-Factor every other American, I planned to stuff myself to the gills with corn pudding, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie and all the other great Thanksgiving fair. After about three, four or maybe even five trips through the family buffet line with my stom­ach on the verge of exploding, I would finally say enough is enough. Now weighing 10 pounds heavier than the day before, it was time for the only exercise of the day. Somehow I would muster the energy to get up from my chair at the dining table, walk 10 feet 
to lie down on the couch and then let the tryptophan kick into high gear. 
There is nothing like falling asleep in front of the Dallas Cowboys game. Only this year was different; this year my favorite holiday was a little more special than usual. Instead of falling asleep, I stayed awake flipping between all the major news networks hoping to catch footage from President Bush's historic visit to Iraq. I probably watched it 50 times ­President Bush popping out from behind the stage at the military bar­racks in Baghdad to surprise the U.S. troops eagerly awaiting their Thanksgiving dinner. Seeing him actually sit behind the buffet line and serve the troops their turkey is what makes our nation truly unique. While he might hold the highest office in the land, George W. Bush is no better or worse than any other American. 
Like him or not, you have to respect President Bush for putting himself in harm's way to thank the troops for their bravery and sacrifice. No, the President was not on the front lines like the troops he sent to Iraq who confront violent threats every single day. However there is still a tremen­dous amount of risk involved in suc­cessfully carrying out this secret mis­sion. As the tragic events from this past month have painfully reminded us. the security situation in Iraq remains shaky. The evil terrorists crawling in Iraq could have potential­ly fired a missile at Air Force One as it landed on the runway at Baghdad International Airport or attacked the military envoy escorting President Bush to the marine barracks. 
The bottom line is that President Bush did not have to travel to Iraq. Contrary to Will Ferrell's brilliant impersonations from Saturday Night Live a few years back, "W" is not a robot who just follows orders when fellow shoppers knocked her to the floor in a mad rush to buy a $29 dollar DVD player. A short time later. paramedics found VanLester lying unconscious on top of the prized DVD Player. 
After the incident, Linda Ellzey told the press how other shoppers remained completely oblivious to her fallen sister's condition. "She got pushed down, and they walked over her like a herd of elephants." Ellzey said. 
While this incident in no way negat­ed the power of Thursday's historic events. it unfortunately captured what is wrong with America. In some ways. it is almost comical that grown

some outlandish political stunt to convince the American people to reelect him as his harshest critics have suggested, but a genuine way for President Bush to express his grati­tude and to rally the American people behind the troops finishing the job in Iraq. 
If the trip helped him politically, then so be it. But the way things are going with a resurgent economy, last week's passage of a Medicare reform bill, and a Democratic Party ripping apart at the seams. President Bush does not seem to need a whole lot of help these days. Who would not want a President willing to throw himself into the fray to stand alongside the troops he has called upon to fight America's war against terror? 
All of the warm sentimental feelings from Thursday's unforgettable Thanksgiving were dampened the next day when I learned about an unfortunate incident at a Wal-Mart in Orange City, Florida. According to news reports, 41 year-old Patricia Van Lester sustained a concussion presents. Admittedly, 
visiting the malls the day after Thanksgiving has become a holiday in and of itself for many Americans, but you should not have to wear a helmet to feel safe at Wal­Mart. 
Not to get sappy, but I fear that peo­ple have forgotten that Christmas is a religious holiday. I am no theologian, but I am pretty confident that people biting and scratching each other to buy Christmas presents was not what Jesus had in mind as a way for people to celebrate his birthday. 
Despite this incident, I still remain hopefully optimistic that the Christmas spirit still hides somewhere in America today. It just might take President Bush to dip into his bag of tricks again to find it.

Banning partial birth abortions 
Editor's note: Because the late-term abortion pro­cedure is a current political issue and some descrip­tions of it may contain graphic content and offensive language. the letters discussing this issue may con­tain such language as well. In order to foster an intelligent dialogue on this matter. this language must be included. Readers who might be offended by such language are cautioned. 
The new federal law banning "partial-birth abor­tion" will not stop a single abortion and it will proba­bly be struck down by the courts. So why did they enact it? 
Most abortions after 12 or 13 weeks are done by dilation and evacuation. The cervix, or entrance to the womb, is dilated, the (eta! sac is punctured and drained and the unborn child's head is crushed. The body is then dis­membered and removed with suction and forceps. Abortionist Martin Haskell developed an alternative, dila­tion and extraction, because "most surgeons find dismem­berment at 20 weeks and beyond to be difficult due to the toughness of fetal tissues" and because dilation and evac­uation can involve a risk of perforating the uterus. Dilation extraction is called "partial-birth abortion." 
In partial birth abortion, which is done after 20 weeks, the cervix is dilated to allow removal of the child's body ·except for the head. The abortionist uses forceps to deliver the baby feet first up to the head which is too large for the opening. He inserts scis­sors into the back of the baby's skull and opens the scissors to enlarge the hole. He inserts a suction tube and sucks out the brains. The empty skull then col­lapses enough to fit through the opening. The new law contains Congressional "factual findings" that "during (partial birth abortion] the child will fully experience the pain associated with piercing his or her skull and sucking out his or her brain." The Alan Guttmacher Institute reported this year that 2,200 partial birth abortions were performed in the United States in 2000. In 1996, 650 were performed. 
In Stenberg v. Carhart, decided in 2000, the Supreme Court struck down the Nebraska ban on partial birth abortion because it failed to allow par­tial birth abortion to preserve the "health" of the mother. "Health" includes mental and emotional

EDITORIAL CARTOON 
Respect view-s of others 

Monday night, after studying all evening in a booth in the basement of LaFortune, I packed up my books and got up to leave. I glanced at the booth beside me, where two guys were hud­dled around a laptop screen. Despite their attempts to hide it, I had a clear view of the extremely explicit porno­graphic video they were watching. 
I quietly informed the two students that I found the material offensive and suggested that they had no business bringing such videos into public. Embarrassed, they muttered apologies. 
My question is: When did the objecti­fication and disregard for the dignity of the human body become so accepted that two guys have no qualms about viewing such material, albeit covertly, in the student center of a University where one might hope that women would be respected for their minds and characters, rather than objectified by two guys who get their kicks out of using images of women for their own selfish pleasure? 
Explicit material brought into the open constitutes sexual harassment under University policy, as !learned today during a conversation in the Office of Residential Life. No one, male or female, should have to view images whose content are offensive to them, whether they are in La Fortune or walking down a dorm's hallway. When I saw the video, my heart hurt, for although they were not objectifying me individually, I am a woman and felt personally offended by the use of a woman's body as an anonymous object. 
No human being should be used as a means to a selfish end. This issue has been addressed throughout history, in fact, I believe a civil war was fought over a hundred years ago in this coun­try over the question of whether a human being should be seen and used as an object devoid of personal dignity. 
No one is anonymous. The woman in the video had parents. She was some­one's daughter, maybe someone's sis­ter. What if she were your sister? Or your daughter? 
Forgive me for daring to mention something religious on a Catholic cam­pus, but it is the season of Advent, when Christians await the celebration of Christ's incarnation, a testament to the dignity of the human body. Let us take this occasion to remember the respect and love which we owe to every human being.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Jay-Z says goodbye 
By KENYATTA STORIN Scene Music Critic 
Widely regarded as one of the best in rap ever, the self-proclaimed king of rap, Jay-Z, claimed that he is leaving the throne, despite being at the peak of his career. Love him or hate him, for years no one else in rap has garnered the affection of both the public and critics as well as Jay-Z. While it remains to be seen whether The Black Album is truly Jay-Z's last record ­and likely, it isn't-it is clearly meant to be a goodbye album of sorts. 
Unlike previous records, The Black Album is an entirely Jay-Z affair. Gone are loads of guest rappers and female pop hooks, which will likely please hip­hop fans that generally find Jay-Z too pop for their tastes. The decision to go strictly solo works to Jay-Z's advan­tage, allowing him to showcase his lyri­cal prowess. He clearly feels like he has nothing left to prove on "What More Can I Say," sampling Russell Crowes' audacious "Are you not enter­tained!?" speech from Gladiator and later following with the boast, "Pound for pound I'm the best to ever come around here." 

Cleverly implementing the names of all his albums in the chorus of the Eminem-produced "A Moment of Clarity," J ay-Z defends himself for 
changing his music for money and 
popularity: "If skills sold, truth be told, 
I'd probably be lyrically, Talib Kweli I 
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like 
Common Sense I But I did five mill'-I 
ain't been rhymin like Common since." 
And even though he claims he is 
quitting rap, he maintains on his con­
cluding track, "My 1st Song," that his 
love for rap is still as strong as it ever 
was: "The song that I sing to you it's 
my everything I Treat my first like my 
last, and my last like my first I And my 
thirst is the same as when I came." 
But as good as his rhymes are, Jay-Z spends a little too much time focusing on himself. Rap has always been about self-promotion and boasting, but that is no excuse for the lack of variety in Jay-Z's subject matter, which hurts the overall longevity of the album. Thankfully, the only true lyrical mishap is the corny, autobiograph­i c a 1 "December 4th," which is bogged down by mundane anecdotes from his 
mother, Gloria Carter. Nevertheless, missing are a few more varied tracks like the party jam "Dirt Off Your Shoulders" by Timbaland, or the vibrant Rick Rubin produced story rap "99 Problems," where Jay-Z bitter­ly attacks the rap media, and contrives a clever anecdote about a run in with a racist police officer. 
As usual, Jay-Z is backed by an all­star cast of producers, and all of the aforementioned tracks have solid beats. However, other tracks are a bit more disappointing. The Neptunes ("Change Clothes," "Allure") in particu­lar fall under their capabilities as their beats are oddly tame, and lack the spice and flavor they normally have. 9th Wonder's "Threat" and DJ Quik's "Justify My Thug" have its moments, but are also not up to par with the rest of the album's production. 

On the whole, The Black Album is well done, but its narrow subject mat­ter and occasionally inconsistent pro­duction keep it from joining the same league as Jay-Z's classics, Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint. But it is still a solid record, and there is no denying the skill of Jay-Z. After all, no other MC has had the staying power of Jay-Z. Since he debuted in 1996, Jay-Z has 
· witnessed many rappers rise and fall from superstardom, while remaining at the top. And as much as it looks like it, this is not the end for Jay-Z. Undoubtedly, either idleness, his love for rap, or maybe even jabs from his nemesis, Nas, will provoke him to return.

ALBUM REVIEW 
The Beatles simply let it be 
By JULIE BENDER Scene Music Critic 
The year was 1969, and as the tumul­tuous decade that had seen the clash of civil rights, the assassination of a presi­dent, the Summer of Love and the rise of Vietnam, came to a close, so was rock n' roll's greatest band nearing its end as well. 
Despite the forces pulling the Beatles apart, recording contracts and obligations were precariously holding the band together. In January of '69, the B~atles began sessions at London's 1\vickenham studios for an album tentatively titled Get Back. Too exhausted for the daunting task of reviewing the hours of studio record­ings, the Beatles s4elved the tapes and began work on a new album, Abbey Road. 
Over a year later, the Beatles called in legendary producer Phil Spector to edit the hours of Get Back tapes and produce what was to be their final album. Given free reign, Spector produced a hard-to-read album of contradictions. What had started as a "back to roots," raw Beatles sound was embellished with grand chorale and string orchestration. Although not over­joyed with the results, the Beatles were too engrossed in their legal battles to rework the album now titled Let It Be. Released as the band's swan song one month after their official break-up, Let It Be remained the final word from the Beatles for nearly 33 years. 
Now the year is 2003, and Paul and Ringo, with the blessings of Yoko Ono and the late George Harrison have had Let It Be stripped down to its origins and rebuilt into a new album titled Let It Be ... Naked. 
The result is a stellar collection of songs filtered to their core elements of rock n' roll -simply the Beatles and their instru­ments. There are no over dubbings or excessive productions as on the original album. The only addition is the keyboard­
ing of an old 
friend from the 

Beatles Hamburg days, Billy Preston. 
Although the title, Let It Be .. . Naked, sug­gests a sparse acoustic set, the album is far different from the Anthology series released in the 1990s. The producers, Paul Hicks, Guy Massey and Allan Rouse listened to the 32 reels of tapes, chose the best takes of each song, cleaned up the hisses and hums, and mixed each of the songs from scratch. The songs are found in a new line up with the short ditties "Maggie Mae" and "Dig It" removed from the album and the song "Don't Let Me Down" added. 

Upon listening to the new album, any Beatles' fan will be quickly struck by the obvious differences from the original song versions. The title track, "Let It Be," for example, differs from the 1970 version with a new clarity in both McCartney's vocals and piano and Preston's supporting keyboarding. Although the new version lacks the suspense of Ringo's drumming in the original, this is made up for by Harrison's spectacular guitar solo, which is brought forward with new emphasis and lucidity. 
The most strikingly different track on this album is "The Long and Winding Road." The 1970 version of this song was over-saturated with grandiose background orchestration that hid its core beauty. On this take, it is simply McCartney and his piano with subtle percussion accompani­ment and a supporting keyboarding solo in the middle. Shed of its lavish embellish­ments, the song is heard as McCartney had originally intended -a delicate bal­ance of grace and strength . 
An exciting and captivating listen for Beatlemaniacs and music fans alike, Let It Be ... Naked is the raw display of unsur­passed rock n' roll purity and talent that is essentially, the Beatles. Even with its posthumous release 33 years late, this album is yet one more testament to the Beatles as the greatest band in rock n' roll.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Blink 182 shows signs of maturity 
By EMILY TUMBRINK 
Assistant Scene Editor 
When thinking of Blink 182, images of ncar-nude So-Cal punks performing songs with raunchy lyrics immediately come to mind. However, on the band's latest self­titled release, its fourth major-label album, these childish antics are noticeably absent. 
When describing this obvious change, singer/guitarist Tom DeLange told MTV, "We were young. We want to go out and break sh--and we grew up in Southern California, that's just kind of who we are, but at this point in our life, with this career, we love art, and we wanna create art that's developed from what we all learned 

By MATTHEW SOLARSKI 
Scene Music Critic 
Should the illustrious isle of our forefathers, Great Britain, ever find itself forced to restrict its exports to but two, please let them be cynicism and great music. With that said, let us now extend a hearty, red-blooded American welcome to Clearlake. On their latest offering, Cedars, the British rock outfit has achieved both par excellence. 
Clearlake came together relatively recently, consisting of lead singer, gui­tarist and principal songwriter Jason Pegg; guitarist and keyboardist Sam Hewitt; bassist David Woodward; and drummer James Butcher. 
These boys have crafted twelve superb tracks of it -all worthy of 
from being in a band for the past 11 years." 
A sure sign of the band's new-found maturity, Blink 182 eventually abandoned the working title of its recent release, Use Your Erection I and II, opting instead for the more conventional Untitled. Not only is this change a sign of maturity, it also sig­nals that something different should be expected from this album. 
With most songs addressing more adult themes, including romantic woe, depres­sion and loneliness, Blink 182's latest album has a much more serious tone than all previous releases, with the entire thing written in the vein of "Adam's Song," the track about suicide found on 1999's Enema ofthe State. 
Despite the apparent darkness of the album, an album that might even be described as "brooding," Blink 182 suc­ceeds in creat­ing a unique sound, one that still allows moments for rocking out, and one that is somewhat experimental for this band of pranksters. 

"Travis said it best when we very first started. Travis was like, 'Don't think of this as the next Blink-182 record -think of it as the first Blink-182 record,'" lead singer Mark Hoppus told MTV. "So we had this mindset that we weren't going to second­guess ourselves ... [or] worry if people are going to accept it or if it sounds like Blink­
182. If it was an idea that we wanted to pursue, we were gonna pursue it. And so we tried out all these different ideas and it was like a musical laboratory." 
This experimentation is certainly present on several of the new tracks, from the Pink Floyd-esque intro on "Asthenia" to the guest vocals provided by The Cure's Robert Smith on "All ofThis." 
Perhaps this experimentation is most evident during the heart-rending spoken word intro to "Stockholm Syndrome," in which an elderly woman recites a letter that Hoppus' grandfather wrote to his wife while fighting in World War II. This intro then leads into one of the hardest rock anthems included on the album, creating a nice juxtaposition of soft and hard sounds. 
Although Blink 182 will certainly receive a fair amount of criticism from fans for changing their sound and attempting to change their identity as a band, they must be praised for their efforts at experimenta­tion and their openness to try new things. This album may not be as light-hearted as previous releases, but Blink 182 has suc­cessfully created an album that appeals to the emotions in ways that were impossible on its other albums.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Cynical Brits Clearlake deliver a humdinger 
serious listening. Guitars ascend, crash and simmer. Eerie piano lines weave their way among brooding vocal harmonies. Smoldering bass­lines set the foundation for a concise but affecting lyrical parade. 
Only the cynical Brits can take a sunny aphorism like "keep smiling" ­from the track of the same name ­and twist it into a snide assault on the misrepresentation of one's true senti­ments. Pegg quips: "Keep smiling I It'll make things that much easier I Don't say how you really feel I You won't be helping anyone." 
A similar dark humor pervades "The Mind Is Evil," a string-adorned tune that could almost be the lead charac­ter's lamentation number in a musi­cal. Here, Pegg proclaims: "And some­times I think I if I killed off my mind I Then my heart and I I would be free." 
Not to wax opti­mistic for long, however, the singer quickly adds, "But some­how it knows I what I'm thinking about I And it's always I that one step ahead of me." Futilitarianism never sounded so good. 
Interestingly, the record in many ways echoes the cadences of the natural day. The opening track, "Almost The Same," bursts

forth from the stereo like a rude awakening, only to instantly mollify any disgruntled sleeper with an uber­catchy, driving melody and harmo­nious vocals. The tracks that follow are decidedly more up-tempo and somehow daytime-oriented. Midway through the album, a ghostly locomo­tive rumbles in, heralding the arrival of night and the woozy number "Keep Smiling." From here on out, the tracks roll into one another, expertly evoking the many moods of the witching hour, from the exaltation of "Treat Yourself With Kindness" to the drunken waltz­ing of "Trees In The City." By the album's end, Clearlake has taken the listener on an aural journey that is not soon forgotten. 
Clearlake appears to be one of those rare bands whose approach seems wholly conventional and yet wildly innovative all at once. In this regard they recall American counterparts Remy Zero, however musically their style is more in tune with that of early Blur. Indeed, tracks like "There's No Other Way" would feel right at home among the poppier numbers on 
Cedars. 
If the album falters in any realm, it's lyrically, and even then only at forgiv­able intervals. At times it seems Clearlake is guilty of redundancy for the sake of rhyme, tacking on needless phrases for the sole purpose of scor­ing an easy phonetic match. A master pop songwriter can achieve rhyme, rhythm and melody while retaining the seamless flow of a narrative that actually goes places. And while Clearlake has not quite attained this, the band is well on its way, and these minor faults hardly detract from the sheer enjoyment of a listen to Cedars. 
All in all, the land across the pond does not disappoint, yet again.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Tar Heels hold on at home in narrow victory over Illinois 


Icon Sports North Carolina forward Sean May posted a double-double against Illinois Tuesday night with 23 points and 14 rebounds. 
Associated Press 
GHEENSBOHO, N.C. -There were ice bags scattered all over the North Carolina locker room and players had a tough time getting their uniforms off. 
But boy, the pain felt so good for the 1Oth-ranked Tar IIeels on Tuesday night after an 88-81 vic­tory over No. 11 Illinois in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge. 
North Carolina remained unde­featnd with the victory, outlasting one of the nation's deepest teams bd1ind Scan May's 23 points and 14 rebounds -both career highs. 
"Hight now is one of those high moments in coaching that you really enjoy," Hoy Williams said. "If we play like this we've got a chance." 
May. sidelined most of last sea­son by a broken foot, was nearly unstoppable at times in the paint as Williams used just seven play­ers -two who were question­able with injuries -to improve to 4-0. 
"I grew up watching the Big Ten and it's always been the most physical conference in the country." May said. "We knew we had to match their physical play." 
May got plenty of help from Hashad McCants. who added 20 poinL'>, and Jawad Williams. The junior played with a hip pointer and had 18 points and 12 rebounds as all five North Carolina starters logged at least 31 minutes. 
"When you 'rc excited like that, playing in a big game, fatigue doesn't really play a part," .lawad Williams said.

Brown had a chance to tie the score twice late with 3-pointers, but missed and finished 3-for-17 from the field for just eight points. 
"It was just one of those nights," said Brown. "Everything felt good, but they just didn't go down." 
Deron Williams led Illinois (3­

1) with 22 points, while Roger Powell added 20. 
North Carolina led 79-78 before Jawad Williams sank a follow shot and McCants hit a free throw. He missed his second from the line with 46.7 seconds left, but got the rebound and the Tar Heels closed out Illinois from the foul line.

Chris Paul is a natural scorer with an overwhelming desire to pass the ball. The freshman is learning how to balance both roles for No. 18 Wake Forest. 
Paul had a career-high 20 points, eight assists and five steals to lead the Demon Deacons to a 100-67 victory over Indiana in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge on Tuesday night. 
"He's a naturally deferential young man." coach Skip Prosser said. "I have spoken with him recently, telling him that he can score and he should look for his offense a bit more." 
Paul did in his best all-around game of his short career at Wake Forest (4-0). 
lie made his first five shots, and only missed on his sixth because A.J. Moye fouled him as he drove to the basket on a fast­break off his own steal. 
He did his best work in the first half, when he scored 15 points and had five of Wake Forest's 10 first-half steals. 
"Coach told me I must become a scoring threat," Paul said. "The first couple of games I wasn't try­ing to score and he told me it was going to turn into a 5-on-4 and teams would stop guarding me. So tonight I made a point to score." 
Eric Williams added a career­high 25 points, Vytas Danelius added 13 points, Justin Gray had 11 and Jamaal Levy had 12 rebounds for Wake Forest, which 
remained  unbeaten  in  five  
Challenge games.  
The  Demon  Deacons  also  

extended their streak to 19 straight home victories dating to last season and gave Prosser, the third-year coach, his 50th win at the school.

No. 12 St. Joseph's 84, San Francisco 52 
Jameer Nelson couldn't resist a half-court bounce pass when Delonte West was open on the fast-break. 
"That was probably the flashiest pass I'll ever make," Nelson said. "l like to keep it straight." 
Nelson scored 18 points and Dwayne Jones added a career­high 13 points in No. 12 Saint Joseph's 84-52 victory over San Francisco on Tuesday night. 
West and Chet Stachitas each scored 13 points and Pat Carroll had 11 for the Hawks . 
The Hawks (4-0) dominated from the outset, scoring the first 10 points and holding leads of 27-4 and 34-14 en route to a 46-18 halftime advantage. 
Nelson opened the game with a 3-pointer from the top of the arc and Carroll followed with one of his own two possessions later. The rout was on. as the Hawks made 12 of their first 18 shots. 
"We really put our foot on their throat and kept it there," Nelson said. "We were just hav­ing fun out there." 
No. 4 Missouri 70, Coppin St. 61 
Missouri survived its second straight scare, getting 16 points, six rebounds and three blocks from Travon Bryant in a 70-61 come-from-behind victory Tuesday night over Coppin State. 
The fourth-ranked Tigers (2-0) have won 29 straight home openers since losing to Southern Methodist on Dec. 1, 1973. They were 14-1 in the Hearnes Center last season and won this one despite allowing a 14-0 run in the first half.

A pair of free throws by Bryant put Missouri ahead to stay at 50­49 with 10:53 remaining. But the game wasn't secured until the Tigers scored nine points in a row for a 67-57 lead with 3:40 to go. The last five points came from freshman Thomas Gardner.

Walsh also had four rebounds and five assists and kept the Gators (3-0) perfect. the day after they climbed to the second spot in the Associated Press poll, and four days after their big 78-77 win over No. 7 Arizona. 
Florida's win came despite a 31-point effort from Terrence Woods, a former Tennessee play­er who moved to Florida A&M (0-4) before last season. It was the most an opposing player had 
scored at florida since 1989. 

Woods made nine 3-pointers, and when he hit one early in the second half. he cut Florida's lead to 43-34. 
Anthony Hoberson responded with 11 straight poinL'> in a 14-3 run to put the Gators back ahead by 17. Hoberson, who went just 4-for-13 in his season debut against Arizona, scored 16 points in a span of 4 1/2 minutes in the second half.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL 
Jones to forego final season at Virginia Tech 
Associated Press 
Virginia Tech running back Kevin Jones will pass up his final season of college eligibili­ty to enter the NFL draft, his father and the team's running backs coach told The Associated Press on Tuesday night. 
"He's coming out," Thomas Jones said in a telephone inter­view from his Chester, Pa., home. Kevin Jones did not immediately return several messages left on his cell phone. but Virginia Tech called a news conference for Wednesday for the announcement. 
Coach Frank Beamer also did not return a message left at his office. but running backs coach Billy Hite said Jones' stature made his decision very easy. 
"I told him going into the season that if he was going to be a No. 1 draft pick, he need­ed to go," Hite said in an inter­view from him home, adding that he met with Jones and Beamer for several hours Monday and Tuesday. "It's a no-brainer." 
Jones, a 6-foot, 221-pound junior projected as possibly the top running back in the draft, has rushed for a school-record 
1.494 yards this season, aver­aging 5.6 yards for 265 carries. He has scored 20 touchdowns and caught 10 passes for 136 yards. 
"Next year could be even bet­ter, but I'd like him to take it to the next level and get better, and that's what he's going to do," Thomas Jones said, adding that the decision is the product of discussions that have been evolving throughout the season. 
"At one point during the sea­son we were saying top 10. If not that, then come on back," Thomas Jones said. "Then you start really thinking about it, and the chance of being a first­round draft pick is a great honor anywhere. When that's on the table with the chance of being injured, you just can't pass that by. It's time to move on." 
Jones said late in the season that he was unsure what he would do and wanted to wait until after the bowl game to decide, but his father said he's been pretty certain his son would make himself available for the draft since the middle of the season. 
"We started getting some pretty good feedback from sources we've got," he said. '"Continue to do this, continue to do that and things are going to look right.' 
"It's the fruit of all his labor." 

Earlier this season, Temple coach Bobby Wallace said he recruited Bo Jackson and played against Herschel Walker and that Jones fit into the same lofty category. 
"He's got the combination of size, strength, feet, cutback ability and pure speed," Wallace said. "You really have to defend the whole field with him and not overpursue, but when you can't overpursue, how do you catch him because he's so fast?" 
Jones' last game was one of his least productive as Virginia limited him to 75 yards on 25 carries, but Cavaliers coach AI Groh, a longtime NFL assistant and then head coach of the New York Jets for one season, agreed that Jones is an elite tailback. 
"He's head and shoulders the most elusive back that we've faced," Groh said. "He's got great lateral quickness, he's got a trememdous burst and he's got long speed. 
"When he gets through, ... you'll never see anybody catch 
h.
lm. " 
Jones was viewed by many as the nation's top high school tailback when he entered Virginia Tech in 2001, and he showed why right away. Playing mostly as a backup, Jones rushed for 957 yards and started the last four games, including the Gator Bowl. 
As a sophomore, with starter Lee Suggs back from an injury, Jones again was a backup and ran for 871 yards despite miss­ing almost two full games with a hamstring injury. His nine touchdowns included a 67 -yard run, his longest to that point. 
This season, with the starting job finally his, Jones blos­somed. He's rushed for at least 100 yards a school-record eight times in a nine-game span for the Hokies (8-4), and had a record 241 yards and four touchdowns in a 31-28 loss at Pittsburgh. 
One of his touchdowns against the Panthers came on an 80-yard run, a sprint down the sideline that showed off his breakaway speed. Against Boston College two weeks later, he showed even more, spinning away from a tackler just past the line and then bursting into for him to get on the field and the clear, easily outrunning the get the job totally to himself so secondary for a 62-yard touch­he could prove what type of down. running back he is," Thomas

NFL 
Sanders speaks about departure from league 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -Barry Sanders, one of football's smoothest backs. admits the way he left the Detroit Lions was awkward. 
During his first news confer­ence since his shocking retire­ment on the eve of training camp in 1999, Sanders said Tuesday, "The way it was done may have been a little clumsy." 
Sanders announced his retire­ment through a written state­ment released by his hometown newspaper, The Wichita Eagle. 
"Even had I retired in a more­graceful way, it still would've been taken the wrong way by a lot of people because I retired after 10 years," Sanders said. "The issue was not how I retired. but when I retired." 
Sanders did say he should have returned calls from former Lions coach Bobby Ross, who tried unsuccessfully to contact him before the 1999 season. 
"It took a long time to figure out what I wanted to do, and how I wanted to say it," said Sanders, looking as fit as ever in a sport coat, slacks and loafers. 
Sanders ran for 15,269 yards during his 10-year career with a crazy-legs style that thrilled fans and frustrated opponents. 
He walked away from the NFL with Walter Payton's rushing record well within reach. 
"At that time, I knew that I just didn't have it in me any­more to continue," said Sanders, who is eligible for elec­tion to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January. 
Sanders, never comfortable talking to reporters, acknowl­edged he agreed to have a news conference solely to promote his book, "Barry Sanders: Now You See Him..." which was released this week. 
"It was probably good that I did the book, because I'm not sure when or if something like this would've occurred," Sanders said of his talk with reporters.

NFL 
League extends Browns' Green's suspension 
Green's original suspension for an alcohol-related violation lengthened indefinitely 
Associated Press 
CLEVElAND-The Cleveland Browns took a big risk two years ago when they drafted William Green. Is the troubled running back worth another one? 
That's the dilemma facing the club after learning Tuesday that Green's NFL-imposed suspension for violating the league's sub­stance-abuse policy has been extended. 
The league's decision to length­en Green's ban indefinitely makes it unlikely he will play again this season. 
The second-year back was sus­pended four games on Nov. 8 for a violation involving alcohol. He was already in stage two of the league's treatment program.

and selected him with the 16th overall pick before signing him to a five-year contract worth $12 million if he reached incentives. 
When Green got ofT to a rough start as a rookie, the Browns began to wonder if they made the right choice. But he emerged in the second half of 2002, rush­ing for 726 yards in his final seven games to help the Browns qualify for the playoffs. 
Browns president Carmen Policy has said the Browns will support Green as long as he con­tinues to show a willingness to get better and make lifestyle changes. 
Green was suspended by the league after being arrested in October on charges of driving under the influence and marijua­na possession. He has a pretrial hearing scheduled for Wednesday. 
While serving his suspension, Green's fiancee was accused of stabbing him in the back with a steak knife. Asia Gray. 22, was charged with felonious assault and domestic violence. 
Police searched Green's home the night of the alleged attack and said they found marijuana in four locations. 
Green's whereabouts remain unknown. 
Green, who was eligible to return to the team Monday, will remain suspended for "treatment purposes." The league said com­missioner Paul Tagliabue will decide when the 23-year-old can return after consulting with med­ical experts in the program. 
If that doesn't happen until after the season, the Browns will have some tough choices to make on Green. Do they give him a second chance, bring him to training camp and risk Green having a relapse? Or do they release him and move on? 
Browns coach Butch Davis refused to address questions about Green's future on Monday. 
"William has some personal issues right now that he has to address," Davis said. "He's got to take care of these things. When those things are taken care of and resolved, we'll decide exactly what William's future is." 
Before the 2001 draft, the Browns were aware that Green was twice suspended for mari­juana use at Boston College. 
But the club felt it could help Green deal with his problems,

"We got dominated the whole game, we were playing defense for a full 90 minutes," said Pruzinsky. "We crossed midfield once and scored and won the game."

Belles look to illlprove record against Andrews 
Saint Mary's squad hopes to gain momentum for weekend tournament 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN 
Sports Writer 

Already showing flashes of solid play, Saint Mary's will look to improve upon its 1-2 record Wednesday night when it hosts against an eager Andrews University squad. 
The Belles, led by coach Suzanne Bellina, commenced their season with two quick loses to Hanover College and Franklin College, but they bounced back last Tuesday with a formidable effort in a 73-62 win over Manchester. 
In this win, Emily Creachbaum and Katie Boyce looked particularly strong with solid scoring efforts of 16 and 17, respectively. 
Maureen Bush looked very active as well, contributing 10 points in only 18 minutes of play. 
In their two losses, the Belles have looked decent, particularly in the 68-65 loss to Hanover, when Saint Mary's was down eight points at the half. 
In this defeat, Creachbaum scored 18 points and grabbed 7 boards, while Bridget Boyce added 16 points and 6 rebounds. 
On the other hand, the 
Belles looked weak offensively in a 54-44 loss to Franklin. 
Andrews will come into Saint Mary's looking to defeat the Belles in an early season non-conference game. 
The two teams have already met this year, in a Nov. 4 scrimmage. Saint Mary's is currently 1-0 in conference play, going into Monday night's contest with Anderson. 
The Belles will need contin­ued strong play from Creachbaum, Katie and Bridget Boyce, and Bush in order to come out with a victo­ry against Andrews. 
Creachbaum and Bush have been the most consistent in rebounding in the team's first three games, and this contin­ued aggressiveness on the boards will ensure that the Belles improve with each game. 
If the Belles can come up with a victory, it would pro­vide the team with strong momentum going into this weekend's Saint Mary's College Houndball Tournament. featuring Saint Mary's. Illinois College. Washington University and Calvin College. 
After the tournament. the Belles play a tough home game against conference opponent Albion College. 
Saint Mary's College and Andrews University will play 
Wednesday at 7 p.m. at home.

FOOTBALL 

Holiday's future remains uncertain 
ByJOE HETTLER and ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Editor and Sports Writer 

He's been through a lot in 2003, so don't expect Notre Dame's Carlyle Holiday to know about his future at the University just yet. 
"I really haven't thought about [next season]." said Holiday, who has one year of eligibility left. ''I'm just trying to finish the season up then after the season think about what I'm going to do." 
If Irish coach Tyrone Willingham has any say, Holiday will be back in a Notre Dame uniform in 2004. 
"We are extremely hopeful that Carlyle will return because we think he can add a great deal to our football team. I have not sat down and dis­cussed next year's possibilities with Carlyle yet," Willingham said. "At the conclusion of the season at some point, I will sit down and do that." 
Holiday started the season at quarterback for the Irish, but was moved to wide receiver after freshman Brady Quinn became the No. 1 quarterback. Next season, Holiday could either be a backup quarterback or see more playing time at receiver, similar to the position switch former Notre Dame quarterback and San Francisco 49ers rookie Arnaz Battle made two years ago. 
C,ONO 
Holiday said he's still getting accustomed to the position move. 
"Right now I'm just trying to learn how to block and being in the receiver's shape," Holiday said. "It's different because you run out there and try and attack someone on everyday. You're still going out there and trying to play. It's totally differ­ent from playing quarterback." 
BCS Implications 
Why will most of the nation be watching a game Saturday between two teams with losing records? 
Because the outcome of the Notre Dame-Syracuse game could have a tremendous effect on the national championship game. 
If Notre Dame beats Syracuse, the game will help second-ranked USC because the Irish win will help boost the Trojans' strength of schedule, one of several factors the Bowl Championship Series rankings use to determine the two teams who play in the title game. Conversely, if Syracuse wins, third-ranked LSU will be aided because USC's strength of schedule will decrease. 
"Wow, that puts us in a bind," senior linebacker Courtney Watson said of a Notre Dame win helping out the school's fierce rival. "I don't want to see USC there, but not at the expense of us losing the game." 
"It's interesting to see how 


our game affects that," quar~ terback Brady Quinn added. "But we're doing our best to win our game and not worry about the situation. If that helps them, so be it. We're going to do the best we can to win this year." 
No Intentional disrespect 
When Notre Dame ran onto the field less than three min­utes before kickoff Saturday, the team interrupted Stanford's pre-game ceremony for sen­iors, who were playing their final collegiate game. 
Stanford receiver Luke 
Powell called the move "disre­spectful", but Notre Dame spokesman John Heisler said the Irish were just sticking to a pre-arranged schedule set by ABC that determines when teams exit and enter the field prior to kickoff. 
Heisler said Notre Dame ran onto the field exactly when they were supposed to and given the go-ahead by a Stanford admin­istrator in charge of enforcing the timeline.

Bowlers finish strong in national match 
Special to the Observer 

The Notre Dame bowling club's men's squad competed this weekend in the presti­gious National Collegiate Team Match Games in St. Louis. The club finished 47th in a field of strong teams from across the country. 
Pikeville College won the event, with several national powers including runner-up Wichita State, Kansas, Central Florida, San Jose State, Cal State Fullerton, Nebraska, Florida State, Purdue, and Florida following. 
Varsity teams competed with the clubs as well. 
Captain Jason Raver's 170.1 average led the Irish, with a high game of 219. Gave Torres rolled the team high game, 244, on lanes oiled for professional competition. Dan Martin and Matt Nieves each posted 193 high pin games, while Vance McClenton's top game was 169. The Irish team average of 158.2 led to the team's improved standing over last year's performance. The club's scores were progres­sively higher with each game and the strong finish has infused the club with confi­dence heading into the heart of the schedule.

There's a difference in a team's attitude coming off a 50-point win, even if Tyrone Willingham doesn't think so. 
"I think our guys have been pretty consistent and that's a reflection of the coaching staff," Willingham said. See Also "The attitude is very "Holiday's

players were more confident during Tuesday's practice, the team's first since thrashing Stanford 57-7 Saturday. 
"The attitude is really upbeat," defensive lineman Darrell Campbell said. "A lot of guys are feeling that swagger. We're really anxious to play this game because it's the last game and hopefully [we will] finish with a four-game winning streak." 
The Irish couldn't do anything wrong against the Cardinal. as they scored 57 points in the first three quarters before putting the second team in. Notre Dame hadn't scored that many points since a 62-0 win against Rutgers in 1996.

Julius Jones dives for the end zone In one of his touchdowns In last weekend's game against Stanford. The 57-7 win was the third win in a row for the Irish and nurtured a confident, positive attitude In the team. This outlook has now been focused on preparing for the upcoming contest In Syracuse. 
Syracuse game. 

"[The win] lightens the attitude of everybody on the team and the stress load," offensive lineman Bob Morton said. 
Now the team focuses its attention on a Syracuse team that is reeling, from a 24-7 loss to Rutgers. It was their third straight and put them at 5-6. Meanwhile, the Irish are riding a three-game winning streak after beating Navy, Brigham Young and Stanford. With one game left, Notre Dame would like nothing more than fmishing the season at .500. 
"It's a big game for us," defensive end Justin Tuck said. "We have a chance to even our record at 6-6 and ;.ve know that we need to bring our '!\ game. I'm sure they want to go out with a good feeling in the off­season and so do we." 
Morton said the team can still make the 2003 season a successful one by defeating Syracuse. 
"One thing we've always talked about is that we can make a stamp on our season," Morton said. "We can be a legendary team too. You don't have to be 12-0 to make an impact on football and that's what we're going with. If we turn the sea­son around and we finish up strong this could be our stamp. This could be what we're looking for."

Senior scores on field, in classroom 
By ANDY TROEGER Sports Writer 

Over the history of the women's soccer program at Notre Dame, very few players have distinguished themselves on the field as much as Vanessa Pruzinsky, and that does not even begin to touch on what she has done in the classroom. 
Pruzinsky, one of only three Notre Dame students ever to achieve a 4.0 GPA in chemical engineering, recently was named Academic All­American of the Year for women's soccer. She was one of three Irish players selected to the All-American team. Junior Mary Boland and soph­omore Erika Bohn both made the second team. With that distinction, the Irish became the first team in NCAA Division I women's soccer his­
..-tory to have three players named to the Academic All­America team. Pruzinsky also achieved a number of other NCAA Division I milestones. She and 

Penn State's Joanna Lohman American award three times. became the first two women's Pruzinsky also joined basket-soccer players to earn·the first team Academic All-see PRUZINSKY/page 17

including 45 percent from 3-point range. 
"We were really on top of our game during the first half," said Belles coach Suzanne Bellina. "We started making shots and played more aggressively on offense." 
The Belles couldn't maintain their early momentum, howev­er. The turning point came at the end of the first half when Anderson made a run to take a 31-27 lead that they held the rest of the game. 
"We started forcing shots at the end of the half and allowed Anderson to come back," said Bellina. "We had difficulty maintaining focus once the tempo of the game had shifted in Anderson's favor." 
The quicker pace of the sec­ond half took the Belles off their rhythm. Their team shooting dropped to only 29 percent in the final half. and Anderson began to wear down the Belles' defense. 
Anderson took control of the game by forcing pressure underneath and dominating the boards. The Belles finished the game with 33 rebounds compared to 45 by Anderson . 
"We didn't make many mis­takes this game and had fewer turnovers," said Bellina. "The
