Bookstore teams find their names censored 

By MIKE CONNOLLY 
Senior Scaff Writer 
Junior Brandon Griffith was very surprised to learn the name for his Bookstore Basketball team had been censored by Student Activities. 
His team's name wasn't pro­
fane. 
His team's name wasn't sexually explicit. 
His team's name wasn't racist, sexist or anti-homosexu­al. 
Nevertheless, Student Activities struck Poor Man's Blanket from

the list of 

Bookstore Basketball team names and replaced it with Team 22. 
"We made the name with the intention that even Father [Mark] Poorman [vice president for Student Affairs] would get a laugh out of it," Griffith said. 
Poor Man's Blanket was one of about 70 teams that were cen­sored by Student Activities this year. All references to Poorman were removed from the list as well as other names deemed too sexually explicit, insulting or profane. 
Brian Coughlin, director of Student Activities, said that there are no set guidelines for deter­mining what teams will and will not be censored. The list of team names is passed through three people -Bookstore adviser Melvin Adams, Coughlin and Peggy Hnatusko, assistant direc­tor of programming for Student

names were banned since he had to look at so many different teams. There was, however, no specific bias against team names containing "Poorman." 
"There is no policy to eliminate names that had 'Father Poorman' in them," Coughlin said. 
He said the "Poorman" names were removed because there is a general policy that Bookstore Basketball team names should not contain the name of another person without that person's

Entertaining angels 
Angels. 
They're mentioned in our prayers. They're mentioned in the Bible. They bring messages to about good and bad news. They help us and guide us on the road of life. They protect us and make sure that we 
are safe. One picture of angels that comes to mind is of two children walking across a bridge, followed by an angel. arms spread, making sure they are safe on their journey. It shows us what ever-present life they are and how they are 

constantly around us. Angela Campos 
In the song "Entertaining Angels" by Newsboys, a Christian Lab Tech alternative group. they tell of how the angels are all around, in all the big and little things that happen, "24-7 you wait for me." 
Oh great, you're probably thinking, she's going to get all religious on us, and tell us tqat they are everywhere all the time. Well, since angels are a religious subject, it would be hard not to bring in religion when talking about them. 
Think about it. They pervade our thought, our art and the way we conceive of the super­natural. There are statues and pictures of them in our art museums. They are in the movies we watch, for example "Michael," "City of Angels," "Dogma" and "The Preacher's Wife." There are even shows that have angels in them, like "Touched by an Angel." They have been made a part of our culture. Why should discussing this make us uncomfortable? Why do we deny their real presence? 
I'm not trying to push religion on anyone, or make them believe in something they can­not see. Why do I bring it up? I would like to show you how there are angels that we can see. in our everyday lives. I want to show just how many angels are out there in our lives, making things better, making things work, helping us along. 
I'm not crazy. If you think about it, when was the last time you ha.d someone in one of your classes help you with an assignment because you just couldn't get it? Or were you one of those people who helped your class­mates to understand? Have you had someone you didn't know give you directions or help you pick up something you'd dropped? Was there ever someone who-just listened to you when you needed to vent? Someone who helped you get through a tough time? Believe it or not, those are our angels in disguise. 
If you look back at my first definition of an angel, they help, guide, and protect us. They are our friends, knowing our troubles and our happy times. We all entertain angels ... we eat dinner with them, sing with them, talk with them. We listen to them, and reach out to grasp at the truth they present us. They are very real. 
I know that I have several angels out there watching over me. You all know who you are. You help me speak into the night, face my terrors, open my heart and live more fully. Are you listening tonight, you are wonderful. The things that I have seen through you have helped me so much; I won't let go of all you've taught me.

Harvard admissions unswayed by roses, gifts 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

Faced with the daunting task of standing out in a crowd of nearly 20,000 Harvard University applicants, some students each year resort to gim­micks -a dozen roses sent along with their application. for example -to win over admissions officials. 
Over the years the admissions office has collected "a colorful set of items" from applicants, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William Fitzsimmons said -including various desserts, a size 17 athletic shoe and a photo of one applicant's bedroom wall, painted crimson to show school spirit. 
This year's round of admissions, which concluded last week and saw a record 19,605 applicants. brought in equally memorable items, some verg­ing on the ridiculous. 
According to Fitzsimmons, there are

now guide books that instruct students on how to get noticed in the applica­tion process. which is often viewed as impersonal. 
But these instruction manuals often inspire students to go over the top to catch the attention of the Harvard admissions committee, Fitzsimmons said. . 
"Maybe people think we don't read the folders," Fitzsimmons said. 
Some familiar with the admissions process attribute the gimmicks to media attention paid to applicants who employ such marketing strate­gies to catch the eye of the admis­sions office. 
"Whenever someone does a crazy stunt, it gets press (coverage)." said Connie Cooper, founder of College Foundation Planners Inc., a college counseling service based in Calif­ornia. "But these games don't work." 
According to Cooper. reputable college counseling services are not likely to advise applicants to resort to such tactics. 
Nevertheless, some applicants still feel compelled to mount a campaign to win the admission committee's vote.

Religion holds back Nebraska coach 
LINCOLN, Neb. 
In early January, shortly after Miami crushed Nebraska in the Rose Bowl, Nebraska assistant football coach Ron Brown journeyed to a Los Angeles hotel to interview for the coaching job at Stanford. But he didn't get any further than the initial interview. The reason: his religious views, among other things, were incompatible with Stanford's liberal student body and active gay community. "[His reli­gion] was definitely something that had to be considered," said Alan Glenn, Stanford's assistant athletic director of human resources. "We're a very diverse community with a diverse alumni. Anything that would stand out that much is something that has to be looked at ... It was one of many variables that was considered." But Stanford's gay student leaders were more blunt in voicing their opposition. "Wow, it would be really hard for him here," said Courtney Wooten, sophomore and social director of Stanford's Queer Straight Social and Political Alliance. "He would be poorly received by the student body in general."

Budget cuts affect nursing program 
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah 
A state legislative shortfall which compound the already severe nursing shortage in Utah, ranks third in the nation behind Nevada and California in the severity of its nurse shortage. With only 592 nurses per 100,000 residents, the number of nurses in Utah has declined by 
6.3 percent since 1996. Nationally, the decline has been 2 percent. to 782 nurses per 100,000 population, accord­ing to the GAO Report, Nursing Workforce. July 2001. "We have plenty of qualified students who want to be nurses," said Maureen Keefe, dean of the College of Nursing, "but we don't have enough space, faculty or funding to train them." The College of Nursing asked the state Legislature for an additional $2.2 million this year so it could expand its ability to train more nurses and nursing instructors to meet the growing need. The Legislature turned down the request, and the college was forced to cut 4. 7 percent from its budget, like most other academic entities at Utah.

The short, low-budget film features many well-known actors, most notably actresses Debbie Allen and Renee Goldsberry. 
As young filmmakers, the Swansons discussed the trials and tribulations of producing their first feature film as well as stressing the irnportance of helping other filmmakers in the future. 
"We want to pave the way for other African American filmmakers," said Michael Swanson. 
In the summer of 1999, Christine Swanson started writing the screenplay for "All About You," while her husband worked on finding funding for the film. 
"Many investors are weary of investing in independent films because they want to be sure of making a profit," Michael Swanson said.

Although Clark and Kroener are satisfied with their design, they said they are going to create a version of the design in watercolor that could be used in print media and for other official purposes. 
According to Kara Kelly, director of communications for the School of Architecture, all of the winners' designs have been given to the Office of the University Architect to determine if the design will actually be constructed. 
"The University Architect's office took the designs and will present them to Executive Vice President Father Timothy Scully and explore the feasibility of con­structing the design." said Kelly. 
Kelly said the University architect does not have a timetable for determining if the memorial will actually be constructed.

"It's not Father Poorman spe­cific," Coughlin said. "It's a rule for any person. Any person will be highlighted [to be further questioned.] If they want to con­tact the person specifically, they can do that." 
Griffith said he was never informed of this policy or given the chance to contact Poorman to ask his permission. 
"They never asked if we had gotten permission, and it wasn't even his name," Griffith said. "It's 'Poor' and then 'Man' with a capital M." 
This general policy does not seem to apply to names besides Poorman's or other University administrators. Uncensored team names include references to, among others, former Irish quarterback Ron Powlus, former Irish football coach Bob Davie, pop singer Britney Spears, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Minnesota Vikings assistant coach George O'Leary. 
Out Faster Than George O'Leary captain Jeff Simko said he was unaware of any rule about requesting permission from O'Leary. 
"What do you think? Of course not. We definitely didn't call him," Simko said. 
Coughlin claims he questioned names with O'Leary and Davie in them but did not censor them. 
"I highlighted both those names so if they are in there, I don't know what to tell you," Coughlin said.

Maskey summed his and Mitchell's v1s1on for lntercomrn by emphasizing their dedication to exacting a tangible change in the atti­tudes and activities of com­munity members toward each other. "Only by addressing [it] ... can we reach the peace-building process," he said. 
Intercomm exists to empower local communities in forging bonds with mem­

"Spoilers are people who don't want the peace process to work for one reason or another ... it's a challenge for us -a prerequeisite in the peace process is that we work with spoilers. 
This. quite often, has required some imagination," he said. 
"Local people creating rela­tionships with local people is the only way to build local peace." 
The community develop­ment projects implemented by Maskey's organization have targeted those local people who need the inter­vention most. He describes North Belfast as "a patch­work quilt," with pockets of Catholics and Protestants dis­persed throughout the com­munity. e's goal in that situa­tion is to rejuvenate interface areas, with housing improve­ments, youth groups, and economic renewal. 
All of this has required not only the support of local com­munity members, but addi­tionally the willingness of various paramilitary groups to cooperate on various pro­jects. 
In terms of expanding Intercomm's volunteer base, Maskey sees this necessary contact as a slight problem. 
"Some people like to help when things are rosy," he said, "but when it comes to working with paramilitary groups, they walk away."

ISRAEL 


Associated Press 

JERUSALEM 
Israel pulled out of two dozen small West Bank towns and villages Thursday, but swept into others and rounded up more Palestinian men despite U.S. calls and inter­national pressure to end the 2-week-old campaign to root out militants. 
Israel's army says 4,185 Palestinians have been detained in the operation -nearly half of them in the past two days as fight­ers in the key northern West Bank cities of Jenin and Nablus, their numbers depleted in battle, ran out of ammunition and surren­dered. 
Among those in custody were 121 Palestinians who had been on Israel's want­ed list, the army said. 
Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived in Israel in the evening and was expected to meet with both Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who has been kept a virtual prisoner by Israel in his besieged compound in Ramallah. 
On Thursday, Sharon acknowledged the fighting was causing the United States difficulties, but refused to call a halt to the incursion. 
In Gaza, an armed Palestinian went through the Erez crossing in to Israel early Friday and opened fire, wounding four Israelis -one seriously ­and three Palestinians before he was shot and killed, Israel Radio and Army Radio reported. The military had no immediate comment. 
There has been rising anti-American sentiment throughout the Arab world in response to Israel's offensive, launched two weeks ago to crush Palestinian militias after a series of deadly attacks on Israeli civilians. 

"They (the Americans) have problems in the region, that's true, but I informed them that our activity will continue -and it will continue," Sharon said. 
The United States, along with the United Nations and European leaders, has demanded an immediate Israeli pullout from the West Bank. 
Powell was visiting the region in an attempt to secure a cease-fire and restart peace talks. 
ln what appeared to be a gesture ahead of Powell's arrival, Israeli forces with­drew from about two dozen towns and villages.

House approves pension reform bill 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Legislative efforts to give workers greater control over their employer-sponsored retire­ment plans are turning to the Democratic-controlled Senate, where broader changes in pen­sion law are being considered. 
That sets up a potential battle later this year with House Republicans, who pushed through more modest protec­tions in a bill Thursday on a 255-163 vote. Forty-six Democrats joined Republicans to pass the House bill that contains much of President Bush's retire­ment savings protection plan designed to prevent another Enron Corp. debacle. 
"Employees need more infor­mation about their pension plans and more control over them," Bush said Thursday. "The reforms will give employ­ees better access to investment advice, additional notice of blackouts and increased ability to diversify." 
About 42 million Americans hold 401(k) accounts, with $2 trillion in assets. 
The Senate isn't moving as quickly on its retirement savings bills, and likely will not begin full debate until summer. 
Senate Democrats are press­ing for tighter limits on how much company stock workers may have in their 401(k) accounts. Thousands of workers at Enron, the Houston-based energy trader, who were heavily invested in company stock lost their retirement savings when the company collapsed in December. 
Labor law limits to 10 percent the assets of a traditional pen­sion plan that may be held in employer stock or property. But Congress years ago exempted 401 (k)s from that provision, hop­ing to encourage employers to offer the plans. Employers get tax breaks for matching contri­butions. 
A bill by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., which nar­rowly passed the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee last month, would limit company stock investments by requiring a choice: An 
employer that offers a 401(k) 
plan could make matching con­
tributions in company stock or 
offer the stock as a separate 
investment option, but not both. 
Republicans oppose that plan 
because they say it will cause 
companies to stop making 
matching contributions or cease 
offering retirement packages 
altogether. 
"The administration wiII 
oppose legislation that discour­
ages employers from sponsoring 
and making contributions to 
retirement plans for American 
workers and their families," the 
White House said in a statement 
Thursday. 
Business groups traditionally allied with Republicans urged lawmakers to act with caution, especially in the Senate. 
"We continue to urge Congress and the Bush administration to avoid a 'ready, fire, aim' response and to carefully con­sider all the facts before rushing into potentially detrimental, nearsighted action," said Dorothy Coleman, a vice presi­dent of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
A retirement law overhaul bill hasn't emerged yet from the Senate Finance Committee. 
Republicans took a far differ­ent approach in the House bill, which does not require invest­ment diversification and instead encourages education. 
One hotly contested provision allows workers to receive invest­ment advice from the same com­panies that manage their 401 (k) retirement accounts. 
Democrats oppose that idea because they say the advice would be. tainted by financial conflicts of interest. 
"What employees do not need in the wake of Enron is an open door for conflicts of interest," said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. "The Enron tragedy was one giant conflict of interest that robbed hardworking employees of their savings." 
Republicans said the legisla, tion would provide much-needed investment advice to workers and require disclosure of any potential conflicts. The House bill also would let workers pay for their own investment advice with pretax dollars deducted from their paychecks.

GOP building alliances with unions 
Associated Press 

WASIIINGTON 
The U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce and the AFL-CIO 
each built their headquarters 
within a few blocks of the 
White House, but the nation's 
largest business lobby and its 
biggest union seemed to work 
miles apart politically. 

Their new neighbor just might be bringing them closer together. 
From steel tariffs to Alaskan oil drilling, Hepublicans and business interests are building alliances with union workers that could affect where and how organized labor provides support in the fall congression­al elections. 
The latest example came Thursday when the Chamber and AFL-CIO, traditional rivals, joined to lobby for an overhaul of immigration laws. Both want to win legal status for millions of illegal immi­grants now working in the United States. 
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and Chamber President Thomas Donohue stood side by side to announce their coalition. 
"A few years ago people would have said those people will never be on a platform together unless they're arguing with one another," Donohue said. 
Immigration is one of several issues bringing together the Republican-leaning Chamber and the AFL-CIO, one of the Democratic Party's key con­stituents. 
They also want Congress and President Bush to provide health care coverage for the uninsured. On Wednesday, they jointly filed court argu­ments against new campaign finance restrictions. 
Bush and labor unions also 
are finding more common 
ground. 
A solid majority of union members backed Democrat Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election that Bush narrowly won. 
Since then, Bush and unions have pushed to expand coal mining and open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, and have supported safety standards for Mexican trucks entering the United States in addition to tariffs to protect the U.S. steel industry. 
Bush this week stood beside business executives and labor leaders to urge Congress to approve government-backed terrorism insurance to get con­struction projects rolling again. 
The Bush administration has relaxed financial oversight of the Teamsters union that had been prompted by a corruption investigation. In a symbolic gesture,· Bush reserved a seat for Teamsters President James 
P. Hoffa at the State of the Union address in January. 
The efforts could have impli­cations for the fall election for control of Congress and beyond, analysts said. 
Unions, which have run mil­lions of dollars in issue ads since 1996 aimed at unseating Republicans, may find their members less inspired tt'J cam­paign for Democrats or against Republicans. 
"What it mostly means is they don't have a strong moti­vation to go out there and pun­ish the Republicans because of the president," said Charles Jones, a University of Wisconsin political science professor. 
Some blue-collar workers, a constituency Ronald Reagan successfully courted two decades ago, agree. 

United Auto Workers Local 
228 member Marvin Montpetit 
of Warren, Mich., voted for 
Bush in 2000 and plans to vote 
for his re-election. While he 
backs the UAW leadership, 
Montpetit said the union and 
organized labor in general 
"blindly" support Democrats in 
most elections. 

"If it's a Democrat they vote for him no matter what he believes," said Montpetit, a maintenance welder who sup­ports Bush's efforts to combat terrorism and who, like Bush. opposes abortion. 
Chicago road-construction worker Brendan Gardiner. a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 134 and a life­long Democrat, said he voted for Gore and doubts he will back Bush in 2004; he is unim­pressed by Bush's overtures to labor leaders. 
"It's just window dressing and an attempt to take the wind out of our sails," said Gardiner, who likes the way Bush has handled the war on terrorism but is more con­cerned about what he will do for unions. 
An AFL-CIO survey after the 2000 election found 60 percent of members polled considered themselves Democratic, 22 percent Republican and 18 percent independent. 
"The Democrats could do themselves some damage by allowing the president to usurp the party's post-New Deal commitment to labor," said Mark Petracca of the University of California, Irvine. "The one thing about labor is two things: A, people vote, and B, there's money." 
Democrats scoff at the notion they'll lose masses of union workers.

ND opts not to formally affirm workers' rights 
By JUSTIN KRIVICKAS 
News Writer 
Notre Dame has rejected a proposal by the Progressive Student Alliance for the University to make a formal statement affirming the rights of workers in the Catholic tradi tion. 
Since its inception. the PSA has been working on labor issues. "There was the sweat shop campaign, fair trade cof fee and taco-bell boycotts ... but throughout this year, we have been talking to labor and taking in their concerns. It just seemed that the logical next step would be on campus," said Paul Graham, PSA co-presi­dent. 
On March 20, the PSA sent the proposal to University President Father Edward Malloy's office and requested that the school consider the proposition and act by April 4. The letter stated that in keep­ing with Catholic teachings, the University should make a state ment that adheres to Catholic social teaching on the rights of labor and also that it won't hin· der or help the workers of Notre Dame in forming unions. Thus, the University will have a firm basis in order to respect the dignity of all labor on cam pus. 
"If they make a statement, especially one that could be legally binding, there is a base on which the labor and those sympathetic to their con~itions could start," said Graham. 
On April 4 University spokesman Dennis Moore sent a letter to the PSA rejecting their request. The letter assert­ed that the University does rec ognize the dignity of each of its employees to organize and form unions and said the University did not agree with the PSA's proposal. 
"If the University were to believe that organizing was in the best interest of a group of workers, why would we not seek to help in that? On the other hand, if we did not believe that such a move was in the workers' interests, why would we [the University} not say so, consistent with the law?" Moore wrote. 

Charles Wilber, professor of economics said, "I thought the University's statement issued by Dennis Moore was reason­able. It confirms the University's acceptance of Catholic social thought but, of course, doesn't pledge to help its workers organize or raise their pay. I think asking the University to make a public statement was not an appropri ate tactic." 
Graham and other members of the PSA are not discouraged by Notre Dame's response but will seek to get clarification of the letter they received. 
"We are trying to get a hold of the University to clarify their statement," said Graham. "What we need to do is work on organizing the labor on campus for support." 
Currently the University requires that all its suppliers and vendors give workers the right to organize into unions but it currently does not extend this right to its own workers. The PSA proposal requests that 
Notre Dame guarantee its employees the right to orga­nize. 
In the late 1970s. Notre Dame agreed to contract out only to organized labor. Other than contracted labor, no workers on the Notre Dame campus are unionized, not even faculty. 
Notre Dame in 1997 became the first university to establish a code of conduct for its licensees and in 1999 it became the first to begin monitoring overseas factories that manu facture its licensed products. The requirement of the right to organize, which will be added to the University's code of con duct and become part of its contractual agreement with licensees, will require that all countries where Notre Dame licensed products are made be signatories to the relevant International Labor Organization treaties and/or have national laws guarantee· ing the legal rights of free asso ciation and union organizing.

SMC frosh 
elected vice president of 
Flipside 
By JILL MAX.BAVER 
News Writer 
For the first time in its his­tory, FlipSide has elected a Saint Mary's student as co­president to the alcohol-free campus club. 
Saint Mary's freshman Liesl Yost snd Notre Dame freshman Margaret Dois were elected co-presidents of Flipside. 
While a Saint Mary's stu­dent is not allowed to run for president of a Notre Dame club, she is allowed to run with a Notre Dame student to hold a joint leadership posi­tion. 
"Thankfully, one of m:y friends [Doig] had already spoken to me about running with her, and we wanted tu run as co-presidents because it worked so well this past year," Yost said. 
Doig said, "It may sound unusual to have two fresh­men as presidents, but everyone encourages the younger members to get as involved as they can. It works out really well ... and we now have multiple ex­presidents and many other knowledgeable upper class­men to help us out. 
"As for Lies! herself: she is very hard-working and intel­ligent ... I'm lucky to have the opportunity to work with her this way. We've only been in office a very short time, but we have already found various goals to tack 
..
l

e. 
The club was founded to provide non-alcoholic alter­natives to students. 
"Our main goal obviously is to show that drinking isn't necessary to have fun, and we continue to offer a posi­tive social environment for those students who choose not to drink," Yost said. 
Yost believes FlipSide has more of a presence at Saint Mary's this year because of the housing of several events, including a Hollywood dance and a toga party. 
"BOG [Saint Mary's student government}. has also been 
,involved in making FlipSide's presence known by co-spon­soring some of the events, which obviously plays a big role," Yost said. "But that is not to undercut the roles that SMC women have taken in the club itself. It makes sense that as we start to get more SMC students working with FlipSide that the role will be a bigger one. 
"FlipSide moved one of its main events to another day because it would have con­flicted with our all-school formal. If we didn't have SMC students, I doubt it would have been addressed at all." 
FlipSide sponsors alcohol­free events every weekend. This weekend the improv group "Comedy Sportz" from Chicago will be performing.

Cuban diplomat and his family vanish in Panama 
Asso~atcd Press 
PANAMA CITY 
A Cuban diplomat once expelled from Canada for espi­onage has vanished in Panama, and Cuban Embassy officials are calling him a turncoat. 
Orlando Brito Pestana, the Cuban Embassy's commercial attache, disappeared along with his wife and family, embassy spokesman Alexis Fruto said. 
It wasn't clear if Brito had lert Panama. Cuban officials have asked that his diplomatic status be removed. 
Asked about allegations that Brito had been a spy, Fruto replied, "Really, I don't know. Like all traitors, he is going to say things." 
The Miami Herald reported on Thursday that U.S. and Panamanian officials said Brito had defected and had been brought to the United States. 
Neither the Panamanian Foreign Ministry nor Panamanian security officials would confirm that report. 
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman said last week that Brito had disappeared. He added that there are no indi­cations he was a crime victim. 

In 1994, Canada expelled Brito, then a vice consul, for alleged espionage. 
The Herald reported that 
U.S. officials later blocked an attempt to have him stationed 
. at the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, which serves as a quasi-embassy. 
The Herald quoted a Panamanian security adviser as saying Brito approached Panamanian officials on March 2 7 and was flown to the United States two days later using false documents. 
It quoted U.S. government

Ac.,,,cia1ed Press 
WASHINGTON 
The Bush administration is monitoring negotiations aimed at winning the release of two :\merican missionaries who have been held hostage by rebels in the Philippines for nearly a year, senior U.S. offi­cials said Thursday night. 
The officials said that the negotiations were being con­ducted by a group known to the rebels and that the talks were at a delicate stage. The negotia­tors were not identified. 
The discussions involved pos­sible payments of several hun­dred tho.usand dollars and other considerations, the offi­cials said, speaking on condi­tion of anonymity. One official said the negotiations were being monitored by the highest levels at the White House, intel­ligence, and law enforcement agencies. 
"There has been some 
progress and activity as recent as todav," the official said late Thursday. 
The officials also said they were encouraged by evidence that the two missionaries were still alive. 
Abu Sayyaf, a Muslim extrem­ist group with links to Sept. 11 suspect Osama bin Lad en. is holding Martin and Gracia Burnham of Wichita, Kan., and Ediborah Yap, a nurse from the Philippines. 
The negotiations, first report­ed by The Washington Times, come less than a month after the State Department acknowl­edged a growing threat of kid­nappings across the world and announced a change in the United States' decade-s old hostage negotiation policy. 
The Bush administration shifted the policy by pledging to "make every effort" to gain the release of any American kid­napped overseas.

But the State Department also reaffirmed its commitment to some parts of the original poli­cy, ruling out paying ransom or making other concessions. It advised corporations with kid­napped employees to do the same. 
Abu Sayyaf gunmen raided the Dos Palmas resort last May 27 and abducted three Americans and 17 Filipinos. All of the hostages were taken to Abu Sayyaf strongholds on Basilan Island near Zamboanga.

Helations between the two governments have been strained since November 2000, when Cuban President Fidel Castro attended an Ibero-American summit here and announced that a Cuban exile, Luis Posada Carriles, had infiltrated the country in a plot to kill him. 
Panama arrested Posada

Military uses NASA images in combat missions Oregon teen 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO 
The Navy has been using NASA satellite data to help guide ships and planes in the war in Afghanistan. 
This marks the first time the military has employed the space agency's up-to-date information in combat, Navv officials said on Thursday. · 
Some in Congress have expressed concerns that NASA risks overstepping its 44-year-old civilian charter. though military planners say the images they have been using are unclassified. 
That information is avail­able to "anyone and every­one," including a host of fed­eral agencies and foreign governments, said NASA spokesman David Steitz. 
He said NASA has no qualms about the military's use of the images, which was first reported this week in Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine. 
"Our nation's at war. We're part of the federal govern­ment," Steitz said. "If that helps save American lives, great." 
The military used NASA satellite images in the Gulf War, but that information was archived, not recent. 
In Afghanistan, the images have been especially helpful in spotting swirling clouds of dust that cause hazardous conditions for U.S. pilots and ships involved in the battle, Navy officials said. 
In October, the imagery helped commanders steer 

carrier battle groups out of dust storms in the Arabian Sea that had limited visibility to lhree feet. 
The satellite data is also being used to study weather conditions that could hamper laser-or optically guided weapons. 
Sean O'Keefe, NASA's new administrator, appointed by President Bush, has called for closer ties with the Pentagon since he took over the post earlier this year. 
Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat who chairs the committee that funds NASA, has expressed reservations about the grow­ing cooperation between the military and the space agency. 
"We've got to be very care­ful about the historic firewall between military space and civilian space," she told O'Kcefe during a joint visit at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland earlier this year. 
She added, however, that she does not have a problem with the Pentagon's use of NASA's unclassified data.

arraigned in psychologist death 
Associated Press 
BANDON, Orr.. 

A 14-year-old boy was arraigned on charges of rapi.ng and clubbing to death a 52­year-old psychologist whose body was found on a beach. 
The suspect lived several· miles from the spot where the body of Judith Elman was dis­covered Sunday, said R. Paul Frasier, chief deputy district attorney for Coos County. 
Raymond Perkins, is charged with aggravated murder, rape. sexual abuse and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. The last charge stems from a joy ride police say he took in Elman's car after she was killed. 
The boy was arraigned in juvenile court. He is too young for his case to be automatically remanded to an adult court under Oregon's mandatory sen­tencing guidelines. 
Outside the courtroom, the boy's mother, Patricia Perkins, said her son "obviously needs medical care." 
"1 will not accept what my son has done. Neither should any­J?ody else. But he's a 14-year-old child and we love him," he said. 
Elman's body was found just north of Bandon. She had been walking or jogging on the beach. 
The boy was taken into cus­tody Wednesday after two peo­ple called police to say they had seen him and Elman on the beach, authorities said. 
Elman, a clinical psychologist who specialized in the relation­ship between physical fitness and mental health.

This letter is written in response to Luke Burke's April 11 letter. 
Ariel Sharon and his government have systematically undermined the authority ofYasser Arafat through military strikes and incursions into the territories to the point where his grip over Palestinian affairs virtually no longer exists. Sharon has all but eliminated that ability of the only Palestinian leader who has ever voiced any desire for a last­ing peace with Israel to govern his own people and in the process set the stage for the ascension of militant organiza­tions such as Hamas to fill the power vacuum as the new representatives and voice of the Palestinian people. 
Sharon has ordered attacks on the entire security and gov­erning institutions that maintain what little stability existed in the region and destroyed Arafat's ability to comply with any Israeli demands to reign in terror. The Palestinian terri­tories have become fertile grounds for the development and growth of true terrorist organizations. These organizations do not even pretend to negotiate. These organizations will never understand peaceful coexistence. but simply blood­shed and bombs.

While Sharon is busy dealing with Arafat and the power structures of his government. the dozen main terrorists groups that operate inside of Israel who have taken a back seat in the past decade to the peace process find their popu­larity rising. They have the opportunity to increase their legitimacy in the eyes of the entire Palestinian people.

With Arafat out of the way, the Palestinians will turn to these true terrorist groups for guidance and leadership. The violence will continue and only exponentially increase in scope and magnitude.

Catholics can't condone contraception 
The 19th century laws restricting contraceptives were passed by Protestant-dominated legislatures. No Christian denomination had ever held that contraception could be justified until the Anglican Lambeth Conference of 1930. The seismic effect of that rejection of millennia of moral teaching came in the 1960s with the advent of the pill. Does it make sense for the Catholic Church still to insist on that formerly unbro­ken teaching? Three questions are relevant: 
Why is contraception wrong? First, it breaks, in the words of Pope Paul VI, "the ... connection -which is willed by God and which man cannot lawfully break on his own initiative -between the two meanings of the conjugal act: the unitive and the procreative." 
Second. the contracepting couple makes themselves the arbiters of whether and when human life shall begin. They confer on themselves, as Pope John Paul II put it, "a power which belongs solely to God; the power to decide in a final analysis, the com­ing into existence of a human person." 
And, third, in contraception, instead of what John Paul II called the "total recipro­cal self-giving of husband and wife," there is a withholding: I give you myself except for my fertility, I will accept you only if you are altered to cancel your fertility. 
In his 1994 Letter to Families, which could be read with profit by every engaged or married couple, whether Catholic or not, John Paul II explained that God, who is love. "wills" that each human person ought to come into existence through a loving act ofself-gift between spouses united in a "communion of persons" modeled on the self-giving relation of the persons of the Trinity. Thus he noted the "similarity between the union of the divine per­sons" in the Trinity and the marital union, (LF, no. 8). 
We, however, have free will. The contracepting couple. in effect, say to God, "For all we know, it may be your will that through this act of ours a new person, who will live forever, will come into existence. But we won't let you do it." In this light, we can see why John Paul said that, "Contraception is ... so ... unlawful as never to be ... justified. To think ... the contrary is equal to maintaining that ... it is lawful not to recognize God as God." 
What about natural family planning (NFP)? In NFP the couple refrain from sexual relations during the fertile period. When they engage in relations during the rest of the month they may prefer not to have a child. But they have an accepting intent, in that they do nothing to destroy the integrity of the act and they are willing to accept the responsibility for a child. The contracepting couple, by drugs or plugs, take measures to destroy the integrity of the act to prevent a child. The privilege of procreation, however, is so important that NFP can be used only for "serious motives," which may include health, financial or other reasons. "In destroying the power of giving life through contraception." said Mother Teresa at the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast. "a husband or wife ... turns the attention to self and so destroys the gift of love ... The husband and wife must turn the attention to each other, as ... in natural family planning and not to self, as ... in contraception. Once that living love is destroyed by contraception, abortion follows very easily." 
What are the social consequences of contraception? If man (of both sexes) makes himself the arbiter of when life shall begin, he will predictably make himself the arbiter of when it shall end, in abortion and euthanasia. The contraceptive society needs abor­tion as a back-up. It cannot say that homosexual activity is wrong without condemning its own premise that man is the arbiter of whether and when sex will have any relation to procreation. As Paul VI predicted, the acceptance of contraception puts "a dan­gerous weapon ... in the hands of ... public authorities" to reduce births among minorities. Promiscuity, divorce and cloning also fol­low from the contraceptive ethic. The growth of pornography, too, validates Paul Vi's warning that contraception would cause women to be viewed as objects. 
As Francis Fukuyama observed in "The Great Disruption," the pill and abortion liberated men from responsibility and put the burden on women, allo'W:ing "many ... ordinary men ... to live out fantasy lives of hedonism and serial polygamy formerly reserved only for a tiny group of men at the very top of society," (121). Women tend to pay the price for the sexual revolution. 
The authentic Christian teaching on contraception does make sense.

Stand up for the Church 
I'll dare to disagree with Tom Haight and his April 10 Inside Column. 
That child molestation, where it is actually committed, is a despicable crime, no one can deny. That certain depraved men who hap­pened to be priests have fallen to this basest of behaviors seems to be evident. That other men within the Church hierarchy made poor decisions regarding these alleged behaviors is arguable. The fact is, that many people, pea- pie even here at Notre Dame, hate the Catholic Church. I shall not try to venture any opinions as to why this is the case, but unfor­tunately it is the truth. 
Now, these people, be they misguided or vindictive, realize that there is little they can do to hurt the rock of salvation that is the Church. But one thing they can do, have done and continue to do, is defame the Church through lies and false accusations. Now. in no way do I mean to discredit those few unfortu­nate victims who truly have been abused by someone, whether by a man posed as a man of God, or not. The fact is, though, that people can lie. In cases of a sexual crime. where only two people are involved, it is very easy to lie. Whose story should the authorities believe? Remember, in our court system, you are inno­cent until proven guilty. 
How many of these accusations against priests are valid? Perhaps all of them, per­haps not. Perhaps the real cases of abuse were dealt with in an unsatisfactory manner. But even so, attacking the Roman Catholic Church does not do anything but harm. The media has exaggerated and distorted the facts to such an extent that here we are, having to defend the Church at a Catholic school. 
How many people have been turned away from the Catholic faith because of this · uproar? Does anyone see droves of people rushing into the only ark of salvation that is the Catholic Church because of this scandal? I certainly have not. 
I have seen questioning of unquestionable doctrines, a general mistrust of the hierarchy who serves us and a general chaos. The very terminology used by those discussing this issue leads to further untruths. The Church has not covered things up. We are all a part of the Church. The Church is comprised of the Church triumphant in heaven, the Church suf­fering in purgatory and the Church militant, that is, we the laity, served by the clergy and bishops and led by our Holy Father, the Pope. If individuals in the Church have made any mistakes, those are not mistakes of the Church. 
I think it is obvious that the "covering up" of scandal is wise, as the results of this exposed scandal demonstrate. Mistakes of letting cer­tain accused priests remain in their ministry were individual errors, likely the result of a lack of knowledge about the nature of these sick men. This was corrected before this pub­lic scandal. If you recall, Mr. Geoghan was long since laicized at the outbreak of this scandal. Dredging up mistakes made in the past and since corrected does no further good. 
That new names of accused priests are being turned in to civil authorities, and that others are being suspended from priestly duties, are results of this public frenzy. Many ofthese men are the victims of false accusa­tions, innocent men who are now being defamed and tarnished. Is it a good thing that innocent and holy men are being ruined for life? Even if some of these men have in fact abused children, that fact will remain. This dredging that will only cause more victimiza­tion and harm in the end will not lessen the damage done to these victims. If we truly care about human dignity, we should not care whether we are dealing with a man called by God to the clergy or a member of the faithful. 
Justice is a good thing, but in the end, God will sort this out, I assure you. As good Catholics, we should stand up for our Church and for our faith, which is constantly guarded by her. Let's not add to the hurt already caused by the sin that we are trying to fight.

The 16th annual Fisher Hegatta is back once again and the title is up for grabs from returning champi­ons Carroll Hall in the men's division and Walsh Hall in the women's division. 
Carroll Hall won the Regatta for the past two years and the members of crew are not about to give it up this year. Their boat "Wood 'N' Caulk" is primed for the race and will be led by creator and two-year champion, senior Steven Bomeli. 
Two seniors, two juniors and one sophomore will be leading the "Wood 'N' Caulk." Bomeli wants to prime the underclass­

"I think that Fisher is going to he putting out a valiant effort. With all our returning rowers and our pirate ship, we should be in a position to take that tro­phy home," Flynn said. 
Flynn, along with the creator of the "Jolly Piggot," Matt Piggot, is in charge of the actual Regatta this Saturday. According to Plynn, at least 50 hours have gone inlo preparing for the event, so it should be worthwhile. The chair­men ordered the food, ordered T-shirts, looked into all the safety regulations and held the captains' meeting Wednesday. Fisher Hall Assistant Hector Tony DeSapio has also put a great deal of time into ensur­

The race is broken into two Flynn, Piggot and their separate tournaments, one crew members will be from the women's dorms and Nick Williams out at the site around the other for the men's. It is Fisher Hall sophomore 8:30 a.m. to begin set­
run in an NCAA style, where two teams go head-to-head with the victor proceeding to the next bracket. In the past, nearly every dorm participated, so the event tends to last five hours. 
Bomeli's main pearl of advice to all those partici­pating in the Regatta is to go out there and give it the best shot. Fisher Hall sophomore Nick Williams relays the same message, however he feels that 2001 second-place finisher Fisher Hall stands a chance. 
"If we have talented rowers, Fisher Hall can win this thing. Our "Jolly Piggot" was by far the co()lest boat last year. Although it tipped, we have guys working on it this yea.r to work out the kinks, and so I think Fisher stands a chance," Williams said. 
Junior Jim Flynn agreed with Williams that Fisher is in prime position to steal the title from the return­ing champs of Carroll Hall. 

up. They will set up the 
grills for the free food 
and drink and set up 
the course for the tour­nament. The tournament will be spon­sored by Coca-Cola and free soft drinks will be provided as well. 
The tournament begins at 1 p.m. and the heats usually go until 4 p.m. Last year. there were 16 teams on each side and the heats shrank from eight teams to four teams before the two championship races. Last year, Carroll Hall defeated Fisher and Walsh Hall defeated Badin. 
In years past, the "boats" raced ranged from miniature golfing ships to garbage bins taped together. Various pieces of dorm furniture and pieces of Styrofoam have also commonly been seen on the race course. According to Williams, peo­ple put whatev­er they want out there -just as 

long as it slight­ly floats and is handcrafted by the dorms. 
In addition to winning the race, one lucky boat will be awarded the honor of "best in show." This award goes to the most creative and entertaining boat that is seen in the tournament. Although the boat may not exactly sail, it will at least maintain the possibility of winning a creativity award. 
Williams and Greg Celio are in charge of Fred and Sally Week in Fisher Hall. The week of events, named after Pisher Hall benefac­tors Sally and Fnid Fisher. began Saturday, April 6, and continue through April 
13. The week of events has grown from merely serving food to events scheduled every night. 
"In the past it hasn't been this huge, but now we are doing a lot more with the 
dorms. Since Fisher is such a small dorm, this week is geared towards getting the guys fired up and showing the rest of the campus our dorm spirit," Williams said. 
The week began last Saturday with a trip to a Chicago Cubs game. About 50 guys took the bus trip and spent the day in Chicago and at the game. On Sunday, there was a dorm picture and free food throughout the dorm. 
One of the most novel and popular events of the week took place on Monday -the Section Wars. Two-thirds of the dorm was involved in these "male­bonding" events of arm-wrestling, pie eating con­tests and the "roommate game." 
The roommate game is focused on finding out how much you know about your roommate. It is reminis­cent of the ''Newlyweds Garno" and the pair that scores the highest, or knows the most about one another, wins on behalf' of the section. 
There are heavy-and light-weight divisions and representatives from each section take part in the events. 
Tuesday night, the Fisher residents attended a talk by Father Theodore Hesburgh in the Main Building, followed by a Mass in the Log Cabin Chapel. This event also had a large turnout from the members of the dorm. 
Wednesday is called the "Red Mock Awards" and

The "Kinky Bootbeasts" will be perform­ing first. They are an acoustic act featuring Dave Lodewyck and Joe Andrukaitis on acoustic guitars. 
Performing next is "Rex Ladado," and according to freshman Brian Cullen (Bucket), this is the premier concert of a band which promises to start a worldwide musical revolution. Bucket is on bass, Dave Lodowyck is on guitar and lead vocals, Matt Morgan is on drums and Pete Balogh is on guitar. 
The headliner is the "Skamunists," a well­known campus ska band. Bucket will again be on bass, Pete Balogh is on guitar, Matt Morgan is on drums, Omar Arizpe is on the trombone, Mike Zodda and Chris Giese are on the trumpets and Sean Brooks is on the saxophone. All three bands are scheduled to play throughout the duration of the event. 
Also, beginning on Thursday, the men wore their sailor caps to promote the events happening at Fisher Hall. 
Today, a Fisher 3-on-3 basketball tourna­ment will occupy the men's day and a dorm-wide party will fill the men's evening. Every section has a social gathering, and the Fishermen unite to show spirit in their dorm. 
Williams sums the evening up in two words: "It's huge." 
The week is concluded with the race on Saturday. The tradition behind the race is also a large part of the week because it all began as an attempt to incorporate Fisher in the Notre Dame community. 
Because Fisher was the only dorm that did not have a signature event on campus, a young man from Boston thought it would be unique for Fisher to have a Regatta race to salute his dorm. It began in April of 1987 as a small event that few dorms participated in and has grown into the biggest dorm event on campus. 
"Our whole dorm year is centered on this one event." Flynn said. 
The event will be monitored by five police­men out on the water 
is for the dubious characters of the dorm. The night consists of cigars, poker and chicken wings. The award ceremony was hosted by Williams and awards were given to the deserving men of Fisher. 
The men voted days ago and selected the most deserving dorm mates for the honorable and not-so­a ppealing awards. Freshman Thomas Patrick Callaghan was awarded the "Prodigal Son Award" (the man most wanted back in Fisher Hall) and Freshman Tony De Vito was awarded the "Ball and Chain Award" (the man most seen with his girl­friendl. Freshman Tom Gorman received a muzzle and a shovel (for his roommate to use) after receiv­ing the "Legend in bis Own Mind Award." 
Additional, not-so-nice awards were the dorm drunk, the smelliest, the Chewbacca award (hairiest guy) and the future seminarian award. They also recognize tho guy with the hottest girlfriend and the laziest man in the dorm. 
Many other awards were given out, mostly to freshmen and sophomores, honoring or dishonoring positions they hold within the dorm. According to Williams, the "Red Mock Awards" is one of the most traditional aspects of Fred and Sally Week. 
Because it is also Breen-Phillips dorm spirit week, the men of Fisher will be co-hosting a lu'au on North Quad, complete with a pig-roast and three campus bands, with Fisher men in each band.

The event should last all day long and admission is free. There will be free food, a DJ playing all day and Regatta T-shirts on sale for $10. 
According to Williams, this is a day of entire Notre Dame unity that can't be found any­where else.

NCAA Tournament. 
"The last three games have been really good for us," Eric said. "I'll be back soon. I think we can win our last four games and make some noise in the tournament." 
Although she does not play the same position as her brother, Meredith Simon's stellar play at midfield is a big reason why the women's team is enjoying its best sea­son in Notre Dame history. As a freshman, Meredith made an immediate impact, start­ing 13 games for the Irish. This year, Meredith is tied for the third on the team in scoring with 15 goals. 
"We have a really special team this year," Meredith said. "We all have fun, and we all work hard. We can definitely compete for the NCAA Championship." 
Meet the Shearers 
If there is anyone who can relate to Eric Simon having a younger sibling attend Notre Dame to play lacrosse, it is junior Danielle Shearer. 
After watching her younger brother, Will, fall in love with lacrosse at the age of five, Danielle finally decided to pick up a lacrosse stick when she was 14. 
She has not put it down since. 
"Our Dad played lacrosse in college," said Danielle. "Will and he kept telling me to play, so I finally played for the first time in eighth grade." 
Last year. as a sophomore, the midfielder from Hampstead, Md., led the Irish in scor­ing with 35 goals. As if that is not impres­sive enough, Danielle set a Notre Dame record with six goals in one half against the Syracuse Orangemen last year. 
Through ten games this year, Shearer leads the Irish with 36 points on a team­high 25 goals and 11 assists. Danielle is quick to give her brother credit for her suc­cess. 
"He helped me out a lot," Danielle said. "He really helped me learn the game. We have a goal in my backyard and we used to practice together all the time." 
Unfortunately, Will has not played yet for the men's team because he suffered a sea­son-ending shoulder injury before the start of the season. Will is currently rehabbing his shoulder from surgery and hopes to contribute to the Irish over the next few years. 
'Tm really excited about the future," Will said. "I hope to help the team in any way I can. I really want to help us do more than last year's team that made it to the Final Four." 

A Special Bond 

Even though the brother-sister tandems do not have the opportunity to see each other play very often because of conflicting lacrosse schedules, they are never afraid to give each other advice. 
"My sister knows my game better than anyone else," Eric Simon said. "She will be the first person to tell me if I could have played better. Every now and then, I'll give her a pointer, too." 
Danielle Shearer said having her brother watch her play helps her tremendously. 
"I love it when my brother watches me play," Danielle said. "He always gives me negative reinforcement. No, I'm just kid­ding. He usually has something positive to say." 
Will did have something positive to say about his sister's career at Notre Dame. 
"My sister is so quick on the field," said Will. "She is just an incredible offensive player." 
Sometimes playing in the shadow of a sib­ling can be difficult, but the Simons and the Shearers would not have it any other way. Both brother-sister tandems are extremely close off the field and very happy to be at Notre Dame together. 
'Tm absolutely thrilled my brother is here at Notre Dame," Danielle said. "We are so tight. We did not go to the same high school so it is really great that we are going to college together." 
Will credits Danielle for helping him get accepted into Notre Dame and making his transition to college life much easier. 
"She helped me a lot with the admissions process," he said. 'Tm really glad we both go to Notre Dame." 
Like the Shearers, the Simons know that it is a special opportunity to attend and play lacrosse at the same school as their sibling. 
"Off the field, we have really different schedules," Eric said. "I live off-campus and she lives on campus, but we still see each other as much as possible. I go·over to visit her a few times a week. We go to movies together a lot." 
"We're best friends," Meredith said with a big smile when describing her relation­ship with her brother. "He's the number one role model in my life. I wouldn't be at Notre Dame ifit weren't for him."

New Irish faces look to win at Tom Botts Invite 
By DAVE COOK 
Sports Wrirer 
New events are not the only changes that come along with the transition from the indoor track and field season to the outdoor season. Along with these new events comes a new group of emerging stars who are making a name for themselves, both in the Big East Conference and, more importantly, the nation. 
As Notre Dame continues its out­door season at the Tom Botts Invitational in Columbia. Mo. this weekend, these standouts look to con­tinue the success that they have seen. 
The most impressive of these stars has been sophomore Todd Mobley. who is currently ranked 18th in the nation in the 10,000-meter run. He posted a 29 minute, 11.35 second time in the 10,000 at the Stanford Invitational two weekends ago. Mobley, whose best performance dur­ing the indoor season was a 14:14.33 5000-meter run at Notre Dame's Alex Wilson Invitational. has improved dramatically since the outdoor season began. 
"I feel stronger," said Mobley. "I felt like I trained just as hard [for] indoors. but the training is finally tak­ing effect because my times are more impressive than anything I've done indoors." 
The men's team has also seen an impressive performance in senior Pat Conway this outdoor season. Conway, is finally in top form again after bat­tling sickness during the indoor sea­son. 
"I was a little bit sick during cross country and indoor track, [and] that dragged me down a little bit," Conway said. "But I've gotten healthi­er, and my breathing has been a lot better, so that has helped." 
Conway is looking to defend his 1500 title at the Tom Botts Invitational, where last year he ran a season-best 3:50.09. 
The women's track and field team has found much of its outdoor season success from a dorm room in Welsh Hall. Freshmen roommates Christi Arnerich and Kate Duman have immediately found themselves as top Irish competitors in events exclusive to the outdoor season: the 3000­meter steeplechase run and the javelin throw. 
In the first steeplechase run of her collegiate career, Arnerich ran a Big East qualifying time of 11:16.55 at Notre Dame's Spring Opener last weekend. She had the fourth-best time in the mile during the indoor season, but in the outdoor season has found herself as Notre Dame's top steeplechase runner. 
"I was pretty surprised that I was able to run that time at the beginning of the season,'' Arnerich said. "Hopefully I'll run about 10 to 15 sec­onds faster [this weekend]." 
Duman made an impact on the record books in her first collegiate meet. Her personal-best throw of 126 feet, 7 inches at the Purdue Invitational is the top throw for the Irish this season. Despite her success. the freshman says it comes as some­what of a surprise. 
"I hadn't planned on doing track in college, but I came here to do it," Duman said. "I wasn't expecting to come out so well in my first meet, because that was a personal best for me. And this was the first time that I've thrown the javelin, so that was exciting." 
Duman and the rest of the Notre Dame track and field team are hoping to get more Big East qualifying and NCAA qualifying times this weekend at the Tom Botts Invitational. For many, this meet serves as an opportu­nity to get ready for the more compet­itive meets to come, and ultimately, the Big East Championship.

Wisen ran into trouble in the top of ihe third inning. Purdue's Laura Martin hit a one-out dou­ble to left. After a groundout gave Wisen two outs, Angi Roembkc's bunt single put run­ners at the corners. Roembke then stole second to place two Boilermakers in scoring position.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE 

No. 7 Blue Devils will test Irish 
By CHRIS COLEMAN 
Sports Writer 
It's tournament time for the _women's lacrosse team. 
While it may not be the NCAA tournament that the Irish are ultimately playing to reach, this weekend ·s three-team round robin hosted by the Irish has some perennial powers match­ing up. Today the Irish face the sixth ranked Duke Blue Devils, and on Sunday challenge the 12th-ranked Yale Bulldogs. The two visiting teams play each other on Saturday. 
This is this first time the Irish have hosted this yearly event. 
"We are excited about the home games," said captain Kathryn Lam. "They [Duke and Yale] are a both aggressive tal­ented squads. We are ready to compete." 
Duke, who Notre Dame plays today at 4 p.m. at Moose Krause Field, is the highest ranked team the Irish have faced. They are also one of the more consis­tentl.y successful programs in the country. 
"These guys have been in the top five for the past four years," Irish offensive assistant Danielle Gallagher said. "They've got a couple big threats on attack, and on top of that, their goal­keeper is outstanding. That's going to pose a very big prob­lem." 
The Notre Dame-Duke game will be a match up of the stingy Irish defense versus a potent Blue Devil attack. The Irish defense, the best in the nation in goals allowed (6.44 per game) going into this week, will need to deal with an offense that has serious scoring threats. 

The offensive-defensive battle will include two high school teammates facing off against each other. Notre Dame's Kelly Mccardell played four years defending. behind Duke's second leading scorer, Lauren Gallagher, at W.C. Henderson in West Chester, Pa. 
"We know about their key players.... Lauren, she's awe­some." Mccardell said. "We are going to look more towards communication and team defense: not worrying about who is covering who, just stop the ball." 
Jen White, Notre Dame's keeper, said she wouldn't be approaching this game any dif­ferently. Her mechanics stay the same. 
"It's just like any other game," said White, who has won Big East Defensive Player of the Week twice. "The routine is the same. Any given day any team can be awesome, or not great." 
On the offensive end the Irish look to sustain their multifac­eted scoring attack where five girls have scored in the double digits. The Irish look to use this diversity when the attention is focused on Danielle Shearer, Alissa Moser and Natalie Loftus. 
"We have to have a great team effort," said Gallagher. "In games like this you're looking for the players th at haven't been as much of an impact to play more of a role. Somebody else has to step it up other than Dani [Shearer]. Alissa [Moser], and Nats [Loftus]." 
Fortunately for the Irish, Anne Riley and Meredith Simon have been contributing on offense more in the last few games, and Lauren Fischer has been scoring consistently

throughout the year. 

The No. 7 Blue Devils started the season ranked third. but lost games to tough ACC compe­tition, to make their overall record 6-4. They go into this weekend knowing the impor­tance of these out-of-conference games. 
"Our kids know that every weekend, every game for us, is critical," Duke coach Kerstin Kimel said. "We are looking for­ward to tomorrow and Saturday." 
The 12th-ranked Yale squad comes to Notre Dame with an 8­2 record and is also looking to make a national statement before returning to Ivy League play. 
Notre Dame goes into this w~ekend coming off an emo­tional one-goal loss to Ohio State. But they are not down on themselves. 
''Its good we get to come back so quickly from a game like Ohio State," said head coach Tracy Coyne. "Our ultimate goal is to win the Big East and get to the tournament. If we can gain some valuable learning experi­ences from a loss, that's good. 
"We know we haven't been playing our best game since we won over Syracuse," McCardell said. "As a team we know its time to turn it around and get back on track." 
The Irish get that chance today. 
The game starts at 4:00 p.m. and Sunday's game vs. Yale starts at 1:00 p.m.

But Johnson walked center fielder Tony railing and allowed a base hit to right fielder Michael Bell before being pulled in favor of relief pitcher Matt Buchmeier. The first batter Buchmeier faced was Brant Colamarino. who drilled a three-run home run down the right field line, com­pleting the six-run sixth inning to make the score 6-4. 
Mainieri believes this situa­tion should never have occurred in the first place, if the Irish had collected a few more clutch hits. 
"That game should not have been a 4-0 game in the sixth inning," Mainieri said. "We should have had least another four runs if we would have rose to the occasion and come through in the clutch. So what happens is we put pressure on the freshman pitchers to go out and pitch these low run games. Grant Johnson pitched 
thought Grant Johnson just pitched his heart out out there," Mainieri said. "Unfortunately, he had to throw a lot of pitches to strike out as many batters as he did, and he just kind of ran out of gas there in the sixth inning." 
In the second game of the doubleheader, the Irish took the early lead after center fielder Steve Stanley singled and O'Toole crushed a two­run home run in the first inning. Both Stanley and O'Toole came with in a hit of hitting for the cycle, each missing the feat by a triple and a single, respectively. 
With the four hits, O'Toole is now batting .432 in his career in Big Eat play with 17 RBI and a .886 slugging percent­age. 
Pittsburgh added a run of it's own off of Irish starter John Axford when Joe Thaman hooted a hard grounder, allowing lead off man Bello on base in the sec­ond inning. Bello scored three batters later on a Roh Beahn ground out. The Panthers tied the game in the when Bell doubled in Beahn. 
Axford settled down to get out of that inning and keep the game tied. 


The Irish busted the game wide open in the sixth by bat­ting around and scoring seven runs to take a 9-2 lead. Stavisky walked to start the inning, O'Toole doubled him in, third baseman Andrew Bushey sacrificed O'Toole over to third and second baseman Steve Sollmann got him home on a fielder's choice via the suicide squeeze.

Thaman then walked to put two men on base for Stanley. The All­American then deposited a three-run homer over the right field wall for his second career round-tripper to end the scoring in the inning. 
The Irish went on to add three more runs before the final out and improved to 19­12 overall and 6-6 in Big East play. 
Despite the impressive win, Mainieri knows his team must play better if they hope to make a run in the Big East tournament as well as the NCAA tournament. 
"I just know that we are bet­ter than we're playing right now," Mainieri said. "We just need to be a better team in the clutch. Guys that have been great clutch hitters with us their whole careers just aren't rising to the occasion."

Women battle two ranked opponents 
. Team not looking ahead to Big East touney yet 
By COLIN BOYLAN 
Sports Writer 
As its season winds down, the Notre Dame women's ten­nis team might be tempted to start looking ahead to the Big East Tournament in Miami, Fla. 
However, two tough matches remain before 
right now. I'm confident in that aspect of our team," he said. 
On the singles side, the Irish have experimented by playing people at different positions, with only marginal degrees of success. The one constant this season has been Alicia Salas, who has anchored the team this season from the fourth singles spot with a stellar 21-2 record. 
On the other side of the court, William and Mary heads into the match with a 15-6 record, while the Longhorns 
boast a 14­

"William and Mary and

beatable. " 
This weekend, superior to the Irish will the Irish head south to Jay Louderback 11-11, the Williamsburg, head coach Longhorns 
Virginia to take on 14th-ranked William and Mary before trav­eling to Austin, Texas for a Monday match against the 10th-ranked Longhorns. 
The two matches represent the seventh consecutive time the Irish have had to play a top-30 opponent and will be a fitting end to a brutal late sea­son schedule. 
"We expect both matches to be very tough," said Irish coach Jay Louderback. "William and Mary and Texas are both very good teams, but they both very beatable." 
As always, the key for the Irish will be to gain early momentum by winning the doubles point. Since Louderback shifted the doubles lineup several weeks ago, he has been pleased by his team's play and expects that part of the lineup to be solidified. 
"Our doubles looks good are reeling 
from a 7-0 thumping at the hands of Vanderbilt, while the Tribe is coming off a tight 4-3 loss to Texas. 
lt would seem as if the door were open for the Irish to gain some last-minute preparation heading into season-ending tournaments and perhaps even squeak out a victory or two. 
The Irish hope their match against Texas helps the team develop more outdoor playing experience that will come in handy during the Big East Tournament, especially against rival Miami. 
"We know Miami is going to be tough wherever we play them, but they're probably going to be even better out­doors," said Katie Cunha. "We want to be ready for that."

Irish seek perfection 
. Men's team aim for perfect home record 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Sports Writer 

The seventh-ranked Notre Dame men's tennis team is just one match away from achieving an unblemished record at home this season. 
A win over 16th-ranked Kentucky on Saturday would make this season's Irish squad the first to go undefeat­ed at the Eck Tennis Pavilion since the 1992 team accom­plished that same feat as they advanced to the NCAA final. 
Kentucky poses a hurdle to that potentially perfect home record, though. 
The Wildcats. who were ranked as high as fourth ear­lier in the season, own a 16-8 record and have defeated top 10 teams such as Tennessee and Mississippi. 
But they have struggled recently, losing four of their past five matches. 
"I have a lot of respect for them," Irish senior Javier Taborga said. "I think they have one of the best teams in the nation, they just under­achieved this year big time. I think it is going to be a war because they need to win to stay in the top 16 and we need to win to host the region." 
"We both need to win real bad for what we want to do," he said. 
Fellow senior and doubles teammate Casey Smith agreed 
"Kentucky is a very talented team," Smith said. "They've been down a little bit lately. Whenever your back is against the wall, you're going to come out fighting." 
The Irish were down a little bit earlier in the season, but after going through that brief slump, the team has come out stronger and more cognizant of their vulnerabilities. 
"l think the team has been playing a lot better. I have seen the level improving, and in practice we are all aware that we cannot have any more Michigan matches." said Taborga, in reference to Notre Dame's upset loss to No. 46 !\lichigan. 
Notre Dame's main weak­ness has been its doubles play, but with a new lineup on Saturday and after successful practices this week, the Irish are not worried. 
"For awhile, we kind of got down," Smith said. "Practices weren't as intense as they should have been. It is tough to keep that level up competi­tion up the entire season. We just went through a little val­ley and I think we're ready to peak again." 
Taborga feels the Irish have the potential to exploit some key disadvantages Kentucky bears. The key for Notre Dame is to capitalize on those opportunities. 
"We want to play them out­doors," he said. "We are in better shape than they are and outdoors you get more of a work-out than indoors." 
Additionally, Kentucky's. travel schedule could aid the Irish. The Wildcats will be getting into South Bend the same day as the match and only a day after hosting Vanderbilt. 

"We have to take advantage of that," Taborga said. 
Notre Dame hopes that the home court advantage will play a role also. 
"In the past years, we've struggled at home," Taborga said. "It's nice to know that finally we are realizing that we have to [maximize] the home court advantage. Not many people come out [to cheer on the team]. but the people that do come have been great supporters." 
The Irish are forcing them­sHlves not to think about undefeated home records and rankings though. 
"If we did think about it, then it might jinx us," sopho­more Matt Scott said. 
Taborga agreed that it is better not to think about rankings. 
"It can affect you," he said. "That's not the best thing to do right now. I think we need to keep on concentrating." 
Notre Dame's No. 1 player does not apply that advice to himself though. 
"I am the only one that is really, really concerned about rankings," Taborga said. "Anyone on the team will tell you that I am a freak because I am on the computer check­ing out all the other schools and telling people. 'If we win this match, we will move ahead.'"

LACROSSE 
ByJOE LICANDRO 
Sports Writer 
If you take a quick glance at this year's media guides for the Notre Dame men's and women's lacrosse teams, you will notice that the last names Simon and Shearer appear on each team's roster. 
This is no coincidence. 
For Eric Simon and his younger sister Meredith and for Danielle Shearer and her younger brother Will, Notre Dame lacrosse is truly a family 
affair. 
Meet the Simons 
Sophomore Meredith Simon has been following in her broth­er's footsteps ever since she was a kid growing up in Flemington, 
N.J. After excelling at softball and soccer in grade school, she wanted to add another sport to her resume in high school. 
"I was looking to do something different," Meredith said with a laugh. "Eric had been playing lacrosse for a few years, and he encouraged me to give it a try. We used to play in the backyard a lot. He played defense on me. I never scored." 
Just like his little sister. Eric Simon was also a three-sport star at Hunterdon Central High School. Eric's athletic talent shined the most on the lacrosse field, where he was named a second-team all-state selection in New Jersey during his senior year. 
After being recruited by sever-

It's all in the family 
al colleges, Eric decided to attend Notre Dame because he wanted to help build a lacrosse tradition here. 
Little did he know one year later his sister would be follow­ing him to South Bend for the same reason. 
"After my first couple of months at Notre Dame, I knew that she would fit in here really well," Eric said. "Every time I called home, I wanted to know if she got in. Meredith is just per­fect for Notre Dame." 
Both of the Simons have been fixtures in the starting lineups for their respective teams over the last two years. As a sopho­more. Eric cracked the starting lineup as a defenseman for the best men's lacrosse team in Notre Dame history. His strong defensive play helped the Irish advance all the way to the Final Four. 
This season has been a bit more challenging for both Eric and the Irish. Eric has been out of action for the last three weeks with a broken left hand, but hopes to possibly return this Saturday against Army and help Notre Dame extend its current winning streak to four games. 
Although their overall record is only 4-5, the Irish look to be in excellent shape to return to the NCAA Tournament. 
Notre Dame currently sits atop the Great Western Lacrosse League with an unblemished 3-0 record. The winner of the league earns ,an automatic bid to the

Pitt rallies for win in split 
. Panthers' 6-run inning sparks comeback in first game of Big East doubleheader 
ByJOE HETTLER 
Assistant Sports Editor 
For a head coach whose team had just beaten a con­ference rival by 10 runs, Paul Mainieri was surprising­ly frustrated. 
The Notre Dame coach's aggravation stemmed from his teams missed opportuni­ties in the first game of a double header against 
Pittsburgh on Thursday, when the Irish let a 4-0 lead vanish and left 11 players on base, en route to a 7-5 loss. 
Despite bouncing back with a 12-2 pounding of the Panthers in the second game, Mainieri knows his team must start playing more con­sistently in the Big East con­ference. 
"We need to play better than a .500 team to get over the hump," Mainieri said. 
"Today we had one nice win, but it was a lost oppor­tunity in the first game, and we're going to have to, soon­er or later, win a couple of games in a day." 
In the first contest, fresh­man right-handed pitcher 

Grant Johnson took the hill for the Irish and was nearly untouchable in the first three innings, striking out seven batters. 
Johnson continued to cruise through Pittsburgh's lineup through five innings, but Notre Dame's offense strug­gled to break the game open. 
Left fielder Brian Stavisky led the Irish with three hits, including an RBI single in the first inning. He also added his fourth home run of the sea­son, a solo shot, in the fifth inning. Catcher Paul O'Toole then smacked a double to center field and was knocked in by shortstop Javier

Purdue came to Ivy Field on Thursday and met a hot Notre Dame softball team, and the Irish sent the Boilermakers home just like their previous 10 opponents -losers. 
Using timely hitting and anoth­er great pitching performance, Notre Dame beat Purdue 4-2 and extended their winning streak to 11 games. 
Irish coach Deanna Gumpf was very pleased with her team. "I think we did great. I think 
we fought," Gumpfsaid. "Purdue is one of the scrappiest teams in the nation. They are the kind of team that can beat anybody on a good day. Purdue loves to beat us. It's like bragging rights in Indiana. Purdue would have liked nothing better than to beat us, so today was a great day for us." 
Carrie Wisen got the start for the Irish and went the distance for her second complete game victory in as many starts. The . freshman pitcher gave up two runs, one earned, on seven hits.
