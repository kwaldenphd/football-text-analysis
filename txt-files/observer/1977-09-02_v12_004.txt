owners, patrons and those living in the residential areas surrounding the bars have not been a problem so far this semester. 
In a meeting last Tuesday, the Board of Public Safety agreed that "the problem has taken care of itself somewhat," and that it has received cooperation from Notre Dame and the students. 
Last spring the Northeast Neigh­borhood Coalition, the Board of Public Safety, bar owners and Notre Dame student government representatives decided to form a coalition to help remedy the pro­blems that had increased in recent years. The special task force, consisting of a representative from each group to keep the lines of communication open, worked to eliminate or lessen the problems of littering, noise, trespassing and other nuisances in the area of Corby-Eddy Streets. 
To keep the,e problems at a minimum, theAUembers of the task force requested that action be taken early in the semester to remind students of former pro­blems. 
The South Bend Police have responded to this request by in­creasing its manpower in the local bar area, which includes the Libra­ry, Nickie's, Corby's and Brit!lget's. 
Although additional uniformed policemen were patrolling the area last weekend, no arrests were made, according to Uniform Divi­sion Chief Donald Foy. "A few verbal warnings were issued last weekend but they were very mi­nor," Foy said. He added that the policemen patrolling the area were "very pleased" with the response they received from the few stu­dents they stopped. 
Foy did point out, however, that there was a problem with students congregating outside the front door of the bars. 
Apparently the problem stems from area residents driving past the bars who see the students outside and "think its a drunken

the weekend raises· \inpleasant memories of rowdy students ro~inilig· the streets and 
dumping litter as they go. . . 
Last year, residents ~f. t:Jle bar area 
organized to protest such II)fringements on the peace and order of ~eir nei.ghborhO<?d.
Both the bar owne.rs · -and the police department resp<!ilded to . these protests,
resulting in tighter control over bar

case and foolhardy as well in these 
circumstances. 
A student with a police record may be 
denied admission to man_y graduate pro­
gramsl including law and medicine. He 
may oe denied certification in many 
professions, including accountancy. He 
may never bold a civil service job, and if he 
is a member of the armed services (that 
means ROTC), he could be subject to 
disciplinary action or dishonorable dis-· 
charge from the service. 
Later in life a person with a police
record may be discnminated against when 
applying for credit, loans, insurance and 
j>bs. . 

These are only some of the possible
consequences of one illicit visit to the bars 
or one inconsiderate action. And they are 
· just not woJ.t!l it. 
We are not condemning anyone to a weekend of study and trips to the Huddle. This Is a weekend to celebrate reunions, to 
make plans for the semester, to have a 
really good time before the pressure starts. 
But it doesn't have to place students' 
futures in jeopardy. It doesn't have to 
result in regret and anxiety and in'eparable 
damage to lives. 
So ff you're not 21, stay away from the local bars. ~d if you are 21, ju~t keep a 
clear. bead. Remember that there are 
people who live on those streets and who 
care how their neighborhood will look the 
next morning and how well they will sleep
. that night . 

This is not a one-weekend warning, because the risks are always there. 'lbe chances of arrest may grow smaller as the 
semester ptygresses, but tbe consequen­
res never will.

Solving the Budget 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii art buchwald · 

WASHINGTON -"Mr. President, Hert Lance is here to see vou." "Send him in. Hello, Bert, how's it going?" 
''Well, I wanted to report to you on the budget. We may have a $60 billion deficit next year. 
"Hmmn, that's serious. What do you think I ought to do?" 
"First, I don't think we should call it a deficit. People get uptight about the word. Why don't we say it's a $60 billion 'overdraft'. We'll announce we just wrote out more checks than we had money in the · bank." 
"That's good thinking, Bert. Even I have had an overdraft at one time or another. What else should we do?" 
"We ought to get a loan from a bank to tide us over.'' 
"How do we do that?" "Well, what we'll do is deposit a large sum of money from the Treasury in a bank. Then we'll ask the bank to make a personal loan to the country in exchange for getting our business." 
·:will a bank do it?" 

• •They do it all the time. When I was head of the National Bank of Georgia I opened an account in Manufacturers Hanover and the First National Bank of Chicago in the name of my bank, and they immediately made a personal loan to me of millions of dollars. 
••Why?" 

''Because the hanks wanted the National Bank of Georgia's acco­unt. That's the way banks do things. You scratch their backs and 
they'll scratch yours.'' 
''That makes sense, Bert. So we borrow $60 billion from a bank and pay off the deficit. Then what happens?" . "We have to pay the interest on the loan;" 
"How do we do that?" "By borrowing money from ano­ther bank." ~.'How do we get the money from the second bank?'' "By opening an account with them.-We deposit Treasury funds 
in their bank, and then we get a personal loan from them because as a client they now trust us. If we didn't have an account we obvious­ly couldn't get the loan." 
"All right, Bert, I'm still follow­ing you. We now have accounts in two banks and we borrow money from the first to pay the deficit, and we borrow money from the second bank to pay the interest on the loan from the first bank. Where do we get the money to pay the interest on the loan from the second bank?" 
"By opening an account with a third bank and then making a personal loan from them." 
"How long do we keep doing this, Bert?" 
"I don't know.. It depends on how many banks there are in the United States. As long as we can open up new accounts with them, we can borrow money from them.'' 
''But suppose we eventually run out of banks." 
''Then we go to overdrafts.'' "Won't the banks get mad if we write overdrafts?" 
''What choice do they have? If they complain about the overdrafts we can always threaten to close our account with them.'' 
'Of course, why didn't I think of that?" "You were never a banter, 'Mr. President." 
"That's true, Bert. Let me ask a question. Suppose the banks ask collateral for their loans." 
"I should hope they would never insult the President of the United States by asking for collateral. After all, you have an impeccable reputation and your signature sho­uld be enough for any loan." 
"But just in case a bank does 
raise the question of collateral, 
what do we do then?" 
"It's simple. We put up the 
U.S.Postal Service to secure the 
loan." 
"Bert, I don't know what I'd do 
•
without you." 
..Shucks, Mr.President. Any banter from Georgia could do the same thing." _

ID replacement fees jump· 
by Jean J'owley St. Maey's Editor 
St. Mary's has instituted a "get-tough"policy on students who repeatedly lose their identification cards an·d apply for new ones. New penalty fees that will increase with each successive loss have been established .for this year. 
"We can understand someone 
losing their ID card once or even 
twice, but when someone loses 
many cards it must be due either to 
carelessness or to the fact that they 
:ue using the cards· incorrectly,'' 
explained Jason· · Lindower,· St. 
Mary's controller. . · . 
The fee for losing a plastic picture ID card the firsttime is $6. A second loss would cost the ~rudent $16.. The. third re.place­n··~nt will cost $31.. · ,Temporacy. 
paper cards issued to freshmen and tr:msfer student.s will _·be .replaced
ft'r $3 the first ttme ~n<l fot $5 the.
~t>cond time. · 
There will also be ·increased enforc~ment uf the ·rule _against. 

loaning identification cards to friends. Cards will be confiscated if loaned. After a second offense the card will be destroyed, forcing the student to purchase a replace­ment. 
The new, more stringent regula­tions were caused, in addition to the problem of repeated loss and trading of IDs, by the college's loss of its identification card manufac­turer. According to Lindower, shortly after the pictures were taken for this fall's cards, the manufacturer announced that he was going out of business. 
Although St. Mary's managed to convince the manufacturer honor his contract and complete this semester's cards, it still left the college "in a bind about what to do 
. during the year when students lose their IDs," Lindower said. 
St. Mary's has purchased the · students • pictures taken for this 
year's cards, but the information and picture must now be sent off-campus in order to issue a replacement card. This process 

will be much more expensive and time-consuming. · 
Taking into consideration the fact that during atwo-month period last year 500 St. Mary's students lost or forgot their cards, the new fees were agreed upon. . · . 
"I hope that the new fees would help the student to realize the value and responsibility involved in pos~ sessing an ID card, •' Charl~s Flaim, director of SAGA.· Food Services at St. Mary's said. 
Flaim's other concern ab()ut this fall's IDs is his· new system for evenly distributing students be-. tween the three food lines. Resi­dents of McCandless and Regina 
· North Halls must now enter the dining hall through the north entrance, while all ot:l:ters are· . required to enter from the .south. I. D. cards will be like gold this year at SMC. as replacement fees

Nobody had expected the · 
monthly declines to continue indef­
initely, but the favorable price 
trend of the. past few months has 
given the inflation"weacy economy. 
a welcome breathing spell. · 
Wholesale price trends event· 
ually show up in the· retail prices 
paid by consumers. The sharp 
declines in farm prices a,lready 
have been reflected in slightly 
lower grocery store food prices. · ·

The Labor -Department said farm 
. · pri~es were down 4.3 per cent in August w.hile pt;"ices of processed foods ana ·feeds were off eight­tenths of one per cent. In the last four mpnths, f~rm prices have . ·declined 15.2 per cent. There were lower prices for 
.. coffee', cocoa, eggs, livestock, poultry and • grains, while prices rose for the second straight month· for fresh and 'dried fruits and vegetables. Price.s of •industrial commod­ities !'ose five-tenths of one per cent in August, largely because of a 4.1 per cent increase in lumber and

Prices of ~uels and J?Ower were u six-tenths of one per cent. although gasoline prices edged dowri. 
While.the continuing declines in farm prices are welcorrie deyelop­ments for shoppers, they are not so welcome . to farmers . who have experienced a steady erosion of income as a result. 
President Carter's decision this week tg support a 20 per cep.t cut back in wheatacreage was !l partial response to ther farmers' plight. Prices of grains declined seven per cent· in August and are down 31.4 per cent for the 12-mon.th period. 
Over-all wholesale prices were 

6.6 per cerit higher in August than a year earlier, which i~ just about what the ·govern11J.ent ·considers to be the underlying rate of inflation in the economy. ·. . . 
The Labor ·Department's whole· sale ptice index in August stood at 
194.6 per cent, meaning that goods priced at·$100·in 1967 had risen in 'cost to $194.60 last month . . J'he· ·agency's figures wece 'ad­justed for seas<_>nal variations. .

Buffalo Braves clean house, Dantley returns to Indiana 
INDIANAPOLIS AP -The Indiana Pacers acquired former Notre Dame All-American Adrian Dant­ley in a two-for-one trade Thursday which sent Billy Knight to the Buffalo Braves. 
Bob Leonard, the Pacers' coach and general manager, said the team also received forward Mike Bantom, who recently signed with Buffalo as a free agent after starting for the New York Nets last season. 
"Ihated to trade Billy," said Leonard, ''but feel we come out ahead in the deal because we received two players who could be starters for us." 
Dantley, a 6-foot-5 forward who was named the National Basketball Association's Rookie of the Year last season after skipping his senior year in college, averaged 20.3 points per game for the Braves. 
Dantley's 1,564 points broke the Buffalo record for a rookie set in 1971-72 season by Bob McAdoo. Dantley shot 50.2 per cent from the field. 
The Braves acquired the NBA's No. 2scorer oflast season. The 6-6 Knight, who averaged 23.8 points per game over three seasons with the Pacers, compiled a 26.6 aver­age last year at both forward and guard. 
Bantom6-9 and 220 pounds, was a first-round draft choice of Phoe­nix om 1973. Last season, in 33 games with the Nets, he averaged 
18.6 points and close to nine rebounds per game. In four seasons with Phoenix, Seattle and New York, he averaged 10.8. 
"You win in the NBA with the 

people you have up front," Leo­
nard said. "And it's no secret we 

didn't get enough scoring at for­
ward last season. I feel we've 
tremendously improved our front 
court.'' 
Leonard said contract problems 
also contributed to his decision to 
trade Knight. 
"We wanted to renegotiate Bil­ly's contract, which has two years to run. But his agent put too much Archibald, 29, came to the Nets 

pressure on him. He wanted a prior to the 1976-77 season in a

Soccer Boom 
==================================== =============== =====:==========:===========:==========:::== =====:===:=:===:=======:======:=====:=====::1nvasion = 
Soccer...it is the sport of the world. Anyone can play it; all you need is a ball and a goal area. In countries around the world, youngsters can be found playing soccer at almost anytime and in almost anyplace. Out in the streets or in the fields, the kids imitate their national heros as they imagine scoring the goal which wins the World Cup. 
At the spectator level, soccer surpasses all sports in the number of fans it attracts and the frenzy which thesefans can reach. Some stadiums, especially in South America, can hold up to 150,000 spectators. It is not uncommon for these stadiums to be filled. Though American fans may occasionally throw things ornn on the field, they can not be accused of the insanity which often overcomes soccer fans. To protect players from fans, some Europe~.n stadiums have waterless moats and barbed wire fences surrounding the field. Also, more than one referee has been assaulted because ofa decisive call which he made. 
What is the cause of soccer's emergence? With the game's simplicity and international flavor, it was probably inevitable. But the catalyst for this rapid growth has been the importation of foriegn stars which has generated publicity for the sport. Pete, George Best, Georgio Chinaglia and Franz Beckenbauer are all acknowledged as the best players in their respective countries. Now they showcase their talents in the United States. It does not take an experienced soccer viewer to appreciate many of their skills. And American youngsters accept them as stars as easily as they accept the stars of other sports. · · 
All of this clearly points to the continued growth of soccer in America. Last Sunday in Portland, the New York Cosmos defeated the Seattle Strikers, 2-1, to win the North American Soccer League championship. If the growth of soccer continues, this 'Champoinship and the World Cup could someday be regarded by Americans in the same manner which they now regard the World Series and the Super Bowl.
