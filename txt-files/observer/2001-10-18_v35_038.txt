STUDENT SENATE 
Resolution 
passes for 

excused absences 
By ERIN LaRUFFA 
Associate News Editor 
As Notre Dame seniors begin job interviews this year, many students may encounter an unexpected prob­lem: the University's attendance poli­cy. 
Currently, students can officially receive an excused absence from class in only a limited number of situations, such as the death of an immediate family member. However, the Student Senate would like Notre Dame to change its policy. 
At its meeting Wednesday night, the senate unanimously passed a resolu­tion calling for the University to give seniors some excused absences in order to attend job or graduate school interviews. 
"We thought that interviews were fairly important," said Knott senator Matt Parsons, who wrote the resolu­tion. Many of his fellow senators agreed that such a policy change would be beneficial to students. 
"I think it's a really good amend­ment," said Pasquerilla East senator Nikki McCord. 
The student senate, however, does not have the authority to change the University's attendance policy. The resolution approved by the senators will now go onto the Campus Life Council and Academic Council. 
In addition to passing the resolution, the Senate also discussed the issue of students receiving Residence Life cita­tions while at tailgates prior to foot­ball games. 
"DuLac does read that students can­not have their own tailgates," said student body president Brooke Norton. "It's also interpreted that you can't be at a student-sponsored tail­gate."

Who's busted next? 
. History of police raids prompt questions about which South Bend tavern will fall this year 
By KATIE McVOY 
News Writer 
On Oct. 12, 2000, hundreds of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students made appearances at local bars to celebrate the end of midterms. By the next morning, 147 of them were making appearances at the booking . department of the South Bend Police Department after being cited in a raid on Finnigan's Irish Pub. 
The raid on Finnigan's followed a long history of bar raids that have left Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents facing serious fines and long hours of community service. Fifth­year seniors may still get chills when they hear the name Bridget McGuire's Filling Station, which was raided on Jan. 30, 1998, and seniors may remember that less than 12 months later The Irish Connection (ICON) met with the same fate. 
"You don't expect to be the one that gets cited," said a Saint Mary's junior who was cited at Finnigan's last fall. "And when it happens you spend the next two weeks thinking why you didn't stay home that night." 
Today, the Thursday before fall break, students on both campuses are wondering which bar will go this year and, more specifically, if it will get busted today.

INSIDE COLUMN THIS WEEK ON CAMPUS 

Searching for Knute Rockne 
Let's get one thing straight. I don't hate Bob Davie. 1 think he's a decent guy, and no matter how many times I've put the f-word in front of his name (hundreds}. it's a shame he didn't work out. 
I think it's fair to say Notre Dame is currently on the market for a new coach. But it's not like Monk, Kevin & Co. are looking for a rug to match their sofa. They're looking for some­one that will guide Notre Dame football for years to come. 
And because I'm 20 years old and think I know every­thing, nay, do know every­thing, I'm going to give Notre Dame some advice about finding our new Knute Rockne. 
Davie was never the first choice after Lou left. Now, with Davie presum­ably "leaving" (as we all know, Notre Dame never fires anyone, they "resign"), we need to go out and get our first choice. Whatever the cost. Davie and Gerry Faust both came cheap, and look what happened. 
If our first choice is Jon Gruden, head coach of the Raiders and the kind of young, vulgar firebrand we need. and he wants five million bones to coach here, by all means PAY IT. Give him a private jet and a butler named Jeeves. The investment will be well worth it, if we are in national title contention. 
More wins equals more money for the University.For the love of winning, get some­body with previous head coaching experience. Notre Dame is not for people starting to be head coaches, it is for head coaches. It is the most high profile job in college sports. We want the Skipper, not Gilligan. 
Get a guy that loves Notre Dame. I think one of the reasons Lou was so successful is because he loved Notre Dame, and he and his life became synonymous with the Irish. Davie, for whatever reason, has not seemed to embody Notre Dame completely like Lou did. 
Hire somebody that will shake things up. The offense of today is the spread attack, with more wide receivers to stretch the defense. The option, while effective when run perfectly, is going out of style because linebackers and defensive lineman are getting faster. It's fair to say that Notre Dame does not run the option perfectly. We need a coach that isn't afraid to shake up the offense, install a new system, and bring some unpredictability to the Irish offense. And throw to the tight end! The next head coach of Notre Dame should be the embodi­ment of everything Notre Dame. as a universi­ty, hopes to become in the next 10 years. 
The next head coach should sweat charisma, and bleed coaching talent. Because while Monk leads the University of Notre Dame, the head football coach leads the Notre Dame Nation: every student, alumni, subway alumni, fan, and watcher of NBC on Saturday afternoons in the fall. 
We need a coach who will rally the entire 

Notre Dame Nation. 
We need a fearless leader. 
We need a legend.

BROWN UNIVERSITY 
Middle East courses are popular 
PHOVIDENCE, R.I. 

Schools around the country have reported a surge of interest in courses and lectures on the Middle East, Islam and foreign policy, but professors disagree about whether or not it will outlive the conflict in Afghanistan. Columbia University professor of history Richard Bulliet, whose focus is Islamic and Middle Eastern history. said, "All professors in the field believe there will be an increase in interest in this area." Though it is hard to see now, he said there will be heightened interest in college courses, graduate school applications and jobs in related fields. Bulliet said Columbia students are showing "a distinct inter­est in Middle Eastern related courses." Ile said he teaches two history courses, and the one on the history of Islamic society has a substantially higher turnout. The attendance is significant given that it is the middle of the semester, when students tend to skip classes, he said, In addition, three students have asked to sit in on his class since Sept. 11.

Schools ban drinking specials 
MADISON, Wis. 

Bars' drink specials are a cheap alternative for penny-pinching students. But this advantage leaves many university officials and parents fretting. They say the very thing that makes bars so appealing is also what makes them so dangerous. Drink specials are the culprits that contribute to binge drinking, say officials at University of Wisconsin. Critics argue that specials encourage students to drink as much as they can, as quickly as they can. But the idea of regulating drink specials in bars has sparked considerable opposition. Skeptics say banning drink specials is unfair to tavern owners and will merely push students to drink in unsu­pervised settings. But this has not stopped universities from trying. Iowa City passed a measure this year ban­ning drink specials. Proponents said it would help alle­viate binge drinking. But whether it is successful is yet to be seen. The city is still compiling data on the effects of the new restrictions. including whether unregulated house parties have increased.

Sex forum focuses on morality 
By JILL MAX.BAUER 
News Wmer 
The second forum in the Saint Mary's sexuality series "Understanding and Embracing Our Sexuality" was held Wednesday night, focusing on moral choices and decision-mak­ing. 
An icebreaking activity using a blindfolding exercise ki~ked off lhe evening. 
Small groups formed and one student in oach group was blind­folded by facilitators. The blind­folded individual had to navigate her way through ubstacles in lhe room. The exercise was per­formed twice, once with a guide helping the student navigate, and once without. 
The purpose of the exercise was to identily those to whom we listen for guidance, especially in decision-making situations, according to facilitators. 
The meeting progressed into a large group discussion, which began wiLh a fishbowl model of conversation. Topics ranged from the sexual views that women acquire from parents. media and peer pressure, virgin­ity, the ways men and women differ in their sexual ideas, to moral questions posed by group leaders. 
One moral issue was the ques­tion of time -how long is "long enough" before one has sex if they decide not to wait until mar­riage. The group decided that them is no magic number, but rather each situation should be judged by the level of commit­ment. which ideally seems to be marriage. 
Another topic in the group was whether or not a Catholic would be making a mistake by engag­ing in premarital sex. 
Sister Kathleen Dolphin echoed the purpose of the discussion. 
"Our goal is honest discussion about sexuality and how to make decisions regarding sexual mat­ters in a safe and open environ­ment," she said. "Sex must be a personal decision, not influenced by outside pressures ... The biggest thing we can do for our­selves is to be educated as to why we are making a decision and follow our own ideas," she said. 
The evening concluded with a prayer and the participants were asked to compleLe evaluations. While they were leaving, stu­dents commented that the evening was thought-provoking. 
"I came not knowing what to expect, but the conversation was verv beneficial. 1 think the lead­ers· really made us think, about morals. our behavior and what roles outside pressures play," junior Emily Miller said. 
Thi> next forum will be held Nov. 14 in Stapleton Lounge of LeMans Hall and the topic will be dating choices.

Walsh to deliver Hofman lecture 
Special to The Observer 
Patrick Walsh, professor of surgery and direc­tor of the James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, will deliver Notre Dame's ninth annual Emil T. Hofman lecture at 10 a.m. Saturday in the DeBartolo llall auditorium. 
Titled "The War on Prostate Cancer." the lec­ture is free and opPn to the public. Walsh is best known for his pioneering work 
in the development of an anatomical approach to prostate surgery involving nerve-sparing techniques that have reduced the possibility of impotence and incontinence. He also has made major contributions to the basic understanding of benign and malignant neoplasms of the prostate. 
Walsh is on the editorial board of the New England Journal of Medicine, is the editor-in­chief of "Campbell's Textbook of Urology," and is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the ~alional Academy of Sciences. 
Survivor urges end to domestic violence 
By SARAH NESTOR 
News Writer 
Diane Swartz spokP Wednesday at Saint Mary's in conjunction with the "\'WCA's "Week Without Violence" and Domestic Abuse Awareness Month. 
"A lot of people think you have to be quiet and ashamed as a victim of abuse. I have nothing to be ashamed of, I wasn't an abuser," Swartz said. 
Swartz is a survivor of domestic abuse and the author of the book "\'\'hose Face is in the Mirror?" 
Swartz, a former Miss Arizona, was a self-employed businesswoman when she mar­ried her first husband. After one month of marriage he became physically and emo­tionallv abusive. 
Swartz stayed with her first husband until she admitted to herself that she was a victim of domestic violence. 
"For a long time I was more afraid of what people would think. I was ashamed and in a big world of denial," Diane said. 
Statistics estimate that an American woman is abused · every 15 seconds, equaling nearly 6,000 women per day. Domestic violence occurs in more than half of all American homes and 40 percent of all female homicide victims are 
murdered by the men in their lives. Battery is the single major cause of injury to women, totaling more injuries than rapes, muggings and automobile accidents com­bined. 
Not only are many women negatively affected by abusive relationships, but their chil­dren suffer too. Between 50 to 75 percent of male batterers also ahusc their children and 63 percent of incarcerated males between the ages of 11 and 20 are in prison for mur­dering their mother's batterer. 
"If you won't get out of an abusive relationship for your­self, please get out of the rela­tionship for your children," Swartz said. 
Swartz is now remarried and lives in Ohio where she and her daughter Brandy began a pro­gram center that educates women about domestic vio­lence.. 
"I want to be a preventative and not a Band-Aid of domestic abuse," Diane said. 
Brandy Swartz, who intro­duced her mother, works with her to educate teenagers and young women about the dan­gers of domestic abuse. 
"[Diane is] an amazing, strong woman." Brandy said. "Our mission is to help people understand the mind of a bat­tered woman."

WASHINGTON 

Thirty-one Senate employees tested positive for anthrax exposure, offi­cials said Wednesday as the threat of bioterrorism rattled Capitol Hill. Hundreds more lined up nervously to be tested and leaders ordered the shut­down of the House and three Senate office build­ings. 
"We're in a battle with terrorism, a new form of human warfare," said House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt. Officials confirmed evidence of exposure in a second 
Senate office -adjacent to Majority Leader Tom Daschle's suite where an anthrax-spiked letter was opened earlier this week ­as well as spores in a cen­tralized mail room in a building across the street. 
"It is treatable," Daschle added emphatically at a news conference later in the day, and officials said the strain that was found responds readily to a range of antibiotics. 
House leaders shut down operations through the weekend to allow for extensive testing. "To ensure safety, we thought it best to do a complete sweep, an environmental sweep," said Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. The Senate announced plans to close all three of its sprawl­ing office buildings, but in a gesture of defiance aimed at terrorists, made plans to convene on Thursday. 

Hastert and Gephardt appeared together at mid­morning to announce that the House would shut down. The speaker made the initial disclosure that 29 people had tested posi­tive in the Senate, and said spores had been found in the Senate mailroom. He also said· evidence of anthrax had been found in the Senate's ventilation system and tunnels. 
Senate officials quickly spread the word that wasn't the case, then sug­gested House leaders had overreacted with the deci­sion to curtail business. 
Hastert said House and Senate leaders had agreed on that course of action earlier in the day, but it appeared some senators balked, not wanting to give the impression of flinching in the face of a threat. 
A law enforcement offi­cial, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the letters sent to Brokaw and Daschle both contained the messages: "Death to America. Death to Israel. Allah is great."

SIMPSONVILLE, Ky. 

Looking out the window toward her thriving sausage plant. Clara Purnell recalled how she worked alongside her husband in the kitchen to turn a family recipe into a household name. 
She helped grind and season the meat. packing it in hand­sewn cloth bags marked Purnell's "Old Folks" country sausage. 
As the business grew, she joined employees on the pro­cessing line and even appeared on television in folksy commer­cials that ended with the signa­ture line: "It's gooo-od." 
Those days are now a distant memory as Mrs. Purnell approaches her 100th birthday Oct. 22, matriarch to a sausage­making tradition that spans three generations. The Purnells' plant in this Kentucky town 20 miles east of Louisville produces more than 100,000 pounds of sausage daily. sold to grocery stores and restaurants in 44 states and Mexico. 
Mrs. Purnell. who was uorn in Springfield, Tenn., is modest about her role in starting the · company from scratch with her husband. Fred B. Purnell Sr. But their children say her resolve and work ethic helped it prosper. 
"She had a definite role in the business," said son Allen. the company's board chairman and sometime television pitchman. "They were partners. Daddy 
Purnell relishes role as Kentucky sausage queen 
took the lead, but Momma kept him propped up." 
Betty Moffett, Allen's sister, crediled her mother's religious faith. "She feels like that reallv makes her life complete, and it has," Moffett said. "She's been an inspiration to the whole fam­ily." 
The business started almost by accident, then became a necessity. At first, the sausage was served only at home. The recipe was Fred's mother's, brought from his family's Middle Tennessee farm to Nashville, where he worked as a railroad mechanic. 
The blend of seasonings still remains a closely guarded secret. It was in the rail yard that the sausage first gained a following. Purnell shared his sausage-and-biscuit lunch with a fellow worker. who liked it so much he wanted to buy some. Word spread, and soon the fam­ily was selling sausage in the rail yard. 
Known by his rail yard nick­name, "Old Folks," Purnell put the name on his sausage. He acquired the nickname as a farm boy because be liked to sit and listen to olrl folks talk. Sausage stayed a side business until 1944, when Purnell was 
disabled by a double her­nia. His pen­sion wasn't enough to support the family, so he started the sausage busi­ness full time. 
"We had to work all the time," Mrs. Purnell recalled. In 
1950, the family moved to Louisville, where a salesman said the sausage business was less competitive than in Nashville. 
Six years later, the Purnells settled in Simpsonville. Fred Purnell made the sales trips to drum up business, but his wife was constantly his "spirit boost­er" whenever times were tough,

Purnell would help box link sausages. Each box was sup­posed to weigh 6 pounds. If a box weighAd slightly more, Mrs. Purnell would break off a link to get the weight down. Tina Wise remembers the Christmas sea­son nearly 20 years ago when Mrs. Purnell presented gifts to women working in the plant office. Wist~ still has the cul­tu red pearl necklace she received. 
"It was the thought that here she is, one of the owners of the company and she thinks enough of the ladies in the office to come in there and tell us a Merry Christmas and give us this gift," said Wise, a Purnell 's employee for 21 years. Still family owned and operated, the company has carved out a share of the market in an indus­try top-heavy with corporate sausage producers. 
According to a trade publica­tion, Purrrnll's ranked ninth nationally in refrigerated break­fast sausage sales for the year ending April 23, 2000, with sales of $19.9 million.

Just why this is so remains a mystery, said British zoologist Jeremy Rayner of the University ofLeeds. 
"A central question that has occupied a lot of us for some time is how much energy it costs the bird to fly," Rayner said. "How does a bird cheat what seems like a fundamental of physics? One day we'll get the answer, but at the moment it's not obvious." 
In the study, Kvist said his team studied the red knots fly­ing six to 10 hours in a wind tunnel.

Put abortion issue in perspective 
A misconception exists in the abortion debate that posits neutrality to one side while accusing the other side of activism and moral legislation. 
In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 Supreme Court decision upholding Roe v. Christine Niles 
Wade. the majority opinion stated that although some of A 1 S 1
s ee t ... 

us may find abor­tion morally repug­nant, we should not in the course ofadjudication "mandate our own moral code." 
If the Court were honest, it would rec­ognize that it is indeed mandating a moral code: the freedom to terminate life within the womb. 
This is not a neutral position. friends. Let me clarify my point with an illustra­tion. At present no State laws allow par­ents the option of killing their newborns ·within 28 days of birth, much to the dis­may of Peter Singer. 
If this prohibition on killing infants were challenged before the Court as infringing upon the fundamental rights of parents in matters ofchildbirth, would the Court be neutral by invalidating the prohibition as unconstitutional? 
Would the Court be neutral by giving parents the right to choose to end that life? Or would the Court. rather, be expressly choosing protection of one life to the detriment of the other? No one would tolerate such a position by the Court. much less deem it neutral. 
Yet make the newborn just four weeks younger and this illustration portrays the Court's present position with a few restrictions, in theory more than fact. Before Roe about half of the States had laws prohibiting or restricting abortion. Like a sickle wielded in the name of fun­damental rights, Roe cut down each one. 
Of course. the prohibition in the illus­tration above would never be declared unconstitutional because the newborn would fall within the definition of "per­son" under the Constitution with the full legal protection that personhood and citi­zenship entail. 
But the illustration serves to demon­strate a point: the Court is not acting neutrally and it would be dishonest for it to assert so. It has taken a side, evident from both opinions' numerous argu­ments in favor of the woman's liberty in matters regarding childbirth with only cursory acknowledgment of abortion's eternal implications for the other life involved. 
This is exactly why the term "pro­choice" is misleading; it admits of only one person's choice, namely. the moth­er's. The phrase "anti-choice" could equally apply to abortion advocates because it emphasizes a real aspect of their position -the lack ofchoice for the other life involved. 
The opinions would even question whether the fetus constitutes a life. referring to it as "potential life." This phraseology might serve to soften the consequences of the procedure they sanction, but it is misleading. No doubt exists as to the life involved. life has never been the issue. Rather the debate has always centered around personhood. 
Let's assume abortion is within the parameters of constitutional adjudica­tion. If. as both opinions make clear. medical experts, philosophers and the­ologians can differ on the question of personhood. then why not err on the side of protecting life? 
If we weigh the relative burdens on a scale, we find that the Court stacks in favor of the woman reason upon reason why carrying a child to term is emotion­ally, psychologically and financially diffi­cult. Yet the Court gives only a passing glance at the other end of the scale. never acknowledging the one reason that tips, indeed overturns the scales in favor of protecting life. 
Rephrased, one side would entail the burden of carrying a child to term with all the practical difficulties that follow while the other side would entail the burden of sacrificing human life itself. 
Which is the more grievous if the issue is fraught with doubt? If it turns out one day that we have been mistaken. that we have erred by protecting the wrong side. what will shelter us from the fact that millions of lives have been extinguished at our sanction? We will not be able to hide behind the mask of neutrality because the position is untenable here. 
Dissenting justices have not argued for a federal ban on abortion. but rather a return of the decision to the States. This approach would be more in keeping with the Court's statement that because good minds differ on the question of person­hood, the Court "should not speculate as to the answer." 
The Court has done the exact opposite: not only has it speculated as to the answer, it has given it to us in no uncer­tain terms. Barely relying on precedent. transforming the right of privacy into a right of autonomy. Justice Blackmun wrote that the right to terminate life is so fundamental that it "need not seek refuge at the ballot box." 
As Roe and Casey have taught us. when all else fails brandish the sword of fundamental rights.

Some of you may ask what chugging warm Mad Dog and urinating on a truck tire have to do with the spirit of Notre Dame football. Well, tailgating, the activity which until two Wfleks ago was perfectly alright for students. encapsulates perfectly all that is Notre Dame football. faery gam11 for at least 40 years the students have come together to celebrate the looming football game. The sta­ples were half-cooked burgers, overcooked hot dogs and yes, the occasional beer or two (or 15). 13ut most of all, the tailgate was about friends and com­ing together. Before I start to sound like a Hallmark card, let me just say that the Saturday morning two weeks ago was my worst day on this campus. Ever. And I didn't Pven get r.ited.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Improve ticket exchange 
Midterm wP.ek is never very easy. This year all considered it's been quite difficult but the promise of the wep,kencl is always something to look forward to. Especially since for the first time in thre,\ years my ni1w year old brother and my family were going to comp, for a foutball game. 
It was tho first time that all thref' could come here and see the game with me and l was ridicu­lously excited about showing my brother around the school and having him cheer besidn me in tho student section. 
llowever those hopes were shat­ternd this morning in a totally unorganized mess ot' a ticket exchange. After three hours of sleep, I took my place in a hefty line at roughly 8:40 a.m. waiting for lhe window tu open, my three friends booklets and IDs in hand so that we might all sit together, they couldn't come because they were all in class. 
I then circled around the lobby to where I get to cross the window the first time we looped around. Shortly before I heard someone had been turned down who was exchanging multiple tickets. So I jump up and ask the lady if this horrible rumor is true -it was. 
You could only exchange your own ticket. So at this point I du not know if it was just that I was lucky the last two years when I exchanged another's ticket or they i.1xchanged mine or if this was a new rule put into affect I had no idea about. 
Or whv it was that someone walking.out said tlrny exchanged anothers ticket with no problem. Was I to wait and try my chance? I did not. l coulrl not wait an undetermined amount of time for nothing while dreading the inevitable. 
I went back to my room feeling defeated and dreading the phone call I was going to have to make to tell my excited brother that it could not happen. Could I get him a different ticket"? Probably, but there is no chance I might cheer on the team with my whole family.· 
So my purpose of this letter? To plead that Notre Dame with its numerous recourses does a slight­ly better job at organization and communication of policy as well as following it, so that no one else has to make the 1.;all I have to.

Recognizing OutreachND would be disservice to ND 
If there were a group on campus for stu­de·nts constantly, or even just often, pos­sessed by murderous rage, it would seem clear that the goal of such a group should be to eliminate that rage, and prevent its expression; anrl this not only for the good of others who may be adversely affected by such rage. but for the good of the group members themselves. 
Like random violence. homosexual activity is gravely wrong; this is clear and consistent in the scriptures of the three major Abraham-based religions, as well as the cat­echism. 
Hence the goal of any group dealing with students "oriented" toward such activity should be to somehow counteract this incli­nation, and prevent its expression. . 
Again, this should be done for the spiritual welfare of the members, apart from those merely disgusted. 
The only refutation I can see of this argu­ment would be to claim homosexuality, sodomy as a lifestyle, is in fact not wrong at all, and could in no way lead to a breach of the friendship with God which is our sole source of ultimate happiness and which includes obedience to His few simple com­mands. 
OutreachND operates according to this perspective, and thus fails to properly and fully help its members. From the statements of its representatives. and sympathizers like Mr. Kreider. it seems the group goal is to make members feel good about themselves, and to police tho thoughts of those who object to their militance. This is irresponsible and divisive. 
Notre Dame would do a disservice to all by recognizing such a group. Any group which encourages gravely sinful behavior in any­one, or is oven ambiguous about the morality of such b<'havior, should be denied access to resources available to legitimate campus organizations. 
The administration should be more articu­late about its dealings with gays and their groups on campus. By its silence it appears to one side unable to justify itself, thus encouraging that side to press forward even more. and to the other side it appears afraid to make a clear and unequivocal statement about the moral dimension of the issue. 
So it is failing everyone, for or against. I join with Mr. Kreider in calling for the administration tu fulfill its pastoral duties towards all souls on campus, gay or other­wise, in better explanation the stance it has taken with regard to OutreachND.

By MATT NANlA 
Scene Movie Editor 
Horror movies have generally gotten a bad ra.p. Your idea of a horror flick probably involves some demon from the underworld devouring the brain (or lack there oO of a screaming, large-breasted female. Or maybe what comes to mind is a slasher film, where a mad seri­al killer stalks a screaming, large-breasted female. If you're a little older or if you watch late night TV, you may be more familiar with the old black-and-white clas­sics, where a pale supernatural figure emerges from the shadows, first to frighten and then to seduce (you guessed it) a screaming, large-breasted female. · Well the movies we recommend for Halloween don't fit int~ any of those categories -although you'll find that they all share certain traits with tl1ese "traditional" (that is, traditionally bad) examples of the horror genre. Instead, we've selected a group of smart, psychologically sophisticated horror movies, ones that scare us without asking us to suspend all logic and taste. 
Alright, you'll still have to suspend some logic and taste, but that's what makes them horror movies, right? 
"The Exorcist" (1973) 
"The Exorcist" presents a fascinating exhibition of unlikely conflicts: the Devil versus a small girl, religion versus logic and modern times versus ancient beliefs. This constant opposition between dueling worlds is why 'The Exorcist" brings such raw emotions to the surface for its viewers. You are never comfortable and you can never relax while watching this film. 
"The Exorcist" begins when Regan (Linda Blair), the 12-year-old daughter of Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), becomes ill in some very strange ways. She gets thrashed around by unseen forces, pees on the carpet and displays a sudden, prolific ability to spout vile and inventive profanity. After taking Regan to every doctor in the Western world, and receiving no explanation for these bizarre phenomena, Chris's once-firm belief in Reason is shaken. Desperate, she begins to wonder if Regan is possessed by the Devil. Chris asks Father Karras (Jason Miller) to check her daughter out, and then, if necessary, to perform an exorcism to drive the spirit from Regan's body. 
Sounds like schlock, right? Well, audiences in 1973 didn't think so. Rumors sped across the country that people were vomiting in the aisles and women were scared into giving· birth. Well, it's not that scary, but it did bring audiences to an entire new level of disturbing real­ism. A great horror film by all means, "The Exorcist" is a cinematic landmark in its own right. 
Frightful Fact: Actress Mercedes Mccambridge was called upon to pro­vide Regan's "demon ooice. " In order to get the right inflec­tion, she wasJed raw eggs, alcohol and cigarettes, and was strapped to a chair. 
"Psycho" (1960) 
Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" is so terrifying that almost 40 years after it was first released, filmmaker Gus Van Sant was moved enough to remake it shot-for-shot. 
Notwithstanding the benefits of modernity that come with a current version -like less embarrassing clothes and cooler cars -the classic version of this creepy Oick is just that: a classic. "Psycho" launched a whole new conception of fear upon the American public. 
Before 1960. the source of evil in horror movies was usually a clownish-looking guy in a Wookie outfit or something equally ridiculous. "Psycho" showed us that the greatest potential horror doesn't come from "The Deep," a la Mystery Science Theater 3000 buffoonery. The greatest threat comes from the guy next door. 
friends, who also live in the neighborhood, are more interested in hook­ing up with their respec­tive boyfriends. But psy­cho Michael Myers (who has just escaped from a mental institution and, naturally, always wears a mask) is out to kill them. Standard horror fare ensues. 
But any good horror movie is only as good a!: its villain, and this i': what makes "Halloween" horror genre. so much better than a:l the other slasher clones that came after it. The opening five minutes are presented entirely from Michael Myers' warped point of view (some consider those five minutes to be among the creepiest film sequences ever). Here's a movie that realizes that some­thing doesn't have to jump out of a bush to be scary. It's often more terrifying knowing exactly what's coming. 
For a horror movie, "Halloween" contains almost no blood. But try watching this one late at night, and you'll see how good it is. 
Frightful Fact: The mask Michael Myers wears is actu­ally a William Shatner "Captain Kirk" mask spray­painted white. 

"SIience of the Lambs" (1991) 
"Silence of the Lambs" assembles one of the most powerful combinations of acting, writing and direction in modern moviemaking to remind us of the infinite depth of human depravity. 
Anthony Hopkins glides through his performance as the evil Hannibal Lecter with gripping understatement, unveiling for us everything we fear most about the dark side of the human psyche. Hannibal's no howling lunatic or crazed animal. He's intelligent, cultured, charming and wholly devoid of any moral qualms. · 
Jodie Foste1· is equally rn.mpelling as FBI Agent Clarice Starling, Lhe perfect foil: a winsome and willing neo­phyte special agent who charms Hannibal. The dynamic between these two actors is tremendous and they both won Oscars for their performances. 
The plot is addictive, as we watch Foster and her FBI team attempt to capture a serial killer on the loose, she coaxes clues from Hannibal -the incarcerated godfa­ther of all serial killers -as to how the killer thinks and what he may do next. 
Much of the movie's plot focuses on this second killer, nicknamed "Buffalo Bill," but he's not really all that interesting, except for his rather extreme take on cross-

Filmed in Freudian psychology's heyday, this film is largely a story of a boy and his mother, and Norman Bates {Anthony Perkins) is a very big part of that very dysfunctional relationship. Caught in the middle is Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). 
Viewers should be amazed at how current the plot twists and sinister behavior seem in this movie. In fact, you'll be tempted to conclude, like the proverbial guy who reads Shakespeare for the first time, that "Psycho" is just one cliche after another. Wrong. This is where they all came from: the origin of cinematic mental anguish. 
Frightful Fact: During the making of the famous "shower scene," chocolate syrup was used for blood, since it shows up nicely on black and white film. 
"Rosemary's Baby" (1968) 

"Rosemary's Baby" is Roman Polanski's finest work next to "Chinatown." Based on Ira Levin's novel, "Baby" is a chilling film filled with great atmosphere and won­derful acting. It deals with some painful topics and has an excellent psychologi­cal thriller storyline. Although the plot deals with the Devil, don't get the wrong idea; unlike "The Exorcist," it deals pri­marily with witch­craft and occultism. "Rosemary's Baby" strikes a perfect bal­ance of suspense and the supernatural, and the real and unreal. Throughout the film there's always the 
question of whether or not Rosemary's (Mia Farrow) suspicions are real or whether she is just paranoid or perhaps even mad. This leads to a lot of great scenes and ultimately to the unforgettable finish. 
Frightful Fact: The film's theme, "The Lullaby of Rosemary's Baby," performed by Farrow, reached No. l 1 on the Billboard charts. 
"Halloween" (1978) 
The '80s gave rise to a proliferation of slasher movies. From "Friday the 13th" to "Nightmare on Elm Street," making cheap horror flicks seemed to be a sure-fire way to make money. But what started it all? Why did Hollywood put so much money into producing so many bad movies? The answer: "Halloween." 
The plot is relatively simple: it's Halloween night, and Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is babysitting two kids. Her

dressing. There is no doubt that you'll leave this movie more afraid of Hannibal than of any­one else. 
Frightful Fact: The role of Clarice Starling was originally offered to Michelle Pfeiff er. 
"The Shining" (1980) 
Without Stanley Kubrick and Jack Photo courtesy ot Anchor Bay Entertainment Inc. Nicholson, "The 
en" was a turning point in the Shining" would be just another haunted house flick. This film, like all his others, is so much Kubrick that it carries the title "Stanley Kubrick's The Shining." His signature techniques helped craft it into the classic it is today. Although Kubrick was difficult to work with, his perfectionism is evident in the final prod­uct. Likewise. Nicholson's depiction of a man teetering on the brink of insanity is brilliant. We watch as the mad­ness slowly settles in and explodes fiercely into this man, transforming him from one who is trying repair his frag­ile family life into a stark raving lunatic bent on destroy­ing everything he loves. With "The Shining," Kubrick and Nicholson succeed on all levels and deliver a film that warrants its place­ment among the best in the horror genre. Frightful Fact: Nicholson was up for the part ofFather Karras in "The Exorcist" before Jason Miller took the role. 
Ok, so maybe intelligence and sophistication aren't what you're looking for on Halloween. You want a lot of gore and an abundance of outlandish creatures. Perhaps you like your horror films v<.ith a healthy dose of science fiction or comedy. Or maybe you just have a thing for zombies. Whatever it is, we got you covered. 
"The Evil Dead" (1982) and "Evil Dead 2" (1987) 
"The Evil Dead" was Sam Raimi's (a cult horror film god) first masterpiece. The plot goes something like this: five college students travel to a cabin in Tennessee. The cabin is really creepy. They explore it and find a tape recorder that has a professor reading a cursed book. The tape raises evil spirits, and soon (after a particularly violent vine-rape scene) one of the women is possessed. To protect themselves, the students lock the new "evil dead" in the cellar. One by one each of them is taken over by evil forces, until only Ash (played by another cult god, Bruce Campbell) is left. 
"Evil Dead» is a tour-de-force of wild blood and special effects that's so over-the-top it's hard (o take seriously. It's a ton of fun, but not sophisticated in any sense of the word. It is an absolute must-see for gorehounds. All oth­ers beware. 
As for the sequel, "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn," Raimi's clever filmmaking and knack for twisted slap­stick humor made it over from the original. This time both qualities have been heightened so that the comedy is equal to the horror. whereas the original was much more of a straight out splatter film. Through this perfect melding of comedy and horror, "Evil Dead 2" manages to capture the appeal of the original while creating a more entertaining film where everything is exaggerated to the extreme. There's more blood, more violence and more twisted humor, much of which is inspired by slap­stick comedy routines. 
Frightful Fact: Green-dyed creamed com was used for the zombie guts. 
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (1975) 
The greatest cult classic of all time is an instant choice for Halloween. "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is a hilarious horror-comedy-musical starring Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick, which attained its cult status by playing at midnight movie showings ever since its initial release back in 1975. A testament to the utterly bizarre, "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is an excellent choice for a Halloween-themed party. 
"The Frighteners" (1996) 
"The Frighteners" is first-rate goofy fun, and get this: it actually has a plot. Granted, it's a fairly derivative plot, incorporating elements from "Ghostbusters," "Ghost" and various other supernatural flicks, but direc­tor Peter Jackson (who's helming the upcoming "Lord of the Rings" trilogy) manages to combine these influences into a surprisingly satisfying blend of over-the-top come­dy and ghoulish horror. Best of all, Jackson knows how to use exciting special effects technology without letting it run roughshod over the narrative. All in all, "The Frighteners" is a big-budget movie that actually delivers on its promise of escapist entertainment, without insult­ing the audience's intelligence in the process. 
Frightful Fact: During the making of the film, lead actor Michael J. Fox repeatedly blew his lines by calling a fellow co-star "Doc" -the name of Christopher ,Lloyd's character in the "Back to the Future" movies. 
"Interview with the Vampire" (1994) 
No list of Halloween movies would be complete with­out a vampire flick. And "Interview with the Vampire" is one of the few horror films out there that takes its sub­ject seriously. 
Based on Anne Rice's novel of the same name, "Interview with the Vampire" presents a twist on the bloodsucker myth by telling the tale from the viewpoint of the vampires. 
Director Neil Jordan creates a beautiful and disturbing world in which these creatures live. Due to the noctur­nal nature of vampires, the film is set almost exclusively at night. The streets of New Orleans in the 1700s are appropriately dank, but the vampires of this film do not spend much time hunting in the streets. These are high­society vampires, and they are constantly placed in opu­lent settings, making it easy for them to prey on the rich upper crust. 
Jordan does a marvelous job of bringing Rice's vision to the silver screen and the film oozes with rich imagery and atmosphere. "Interview" is one of the best vampire movies ever made, easily blowing away Francis Ford Coppola's "Bram Stoker's Dracula," and is thus a worthy selection for Halloween. 
Frightful Fact: Anne Rice was originally unhappy with the casting ofTom Cruise in the role ofLestat. Upon see­ing his performance, she apologized. 
All of the films we recommend are ideal candidates for Halloween n:iovie watching. Most will scare you to bits, others will gross you out and even a few will make you laugh -some are capable of doing all three. Regardless, Halloween's the perfect time for friends and families to just sit back, relax, and enjoy the horror show.

Frightful Fact: The film was originally banned in South Africa just weeks after its release, but not before it had been seen by an estimated 250,000 viewers. 
"Allen" (1979) 
Ridley Scott's "Alien" is quite possibly the greatest science fiction-horror film of all time and, despite the inarguable success of James Cameron's sequel "Aliens," the origi­nal is still the best in the series. It is the perfect melding of sci-fi and thriller, creat­ing a pulse pounding film that keeps view­ers on the edge, especially during the last hour, which begins with the classic "chest­popping" scene. 
Like a Last Supper in space, this act is the last peaceful moment before everything comes crashing down. A new threat literal­ly comes out of nowhere. What's left is an amazing scene that must have made audi­ences in 1979 freak out. and it still holds up very well when viewed today. If you're looking for a great sci-fl-horror film, they don't get much better than "Alien."

How Can You Mend a Broken Heart? 
by Chandra Johnson, Assistant to the President and Assistant Director of Cross Cultural Ministry 
The weather is changing, and judging by conversations I have had with several students in the past few weeks, relationships are changing too. Responding to Mother Nature's predictable cooler temperatures and corresponding shifting temperaments, couples around campus are showing signs of reconstruction and change. Giving each other "space" seems to be the optimum word for contemplating a fresh new outlook on life. Unfortunately, this desire for freedom and renewed vision is unsettling and perhaps unexpected for those who didn't see the change coming. 
This week, I would like to examine matters of the heart, particularly broken hearts. I chose this topic because today we commemorate the life and ministry of Luke, the Syrian physician and evangelist, who authored Acts of the Apostles and the gospel written for gentile christians. Many years ago, I facilitated a relationship retreat for young adults in Los Angeles and we used Luke's gospel to highlight Christ as liberator and healer of broken hearts. We spent the weekend discussing why loving and being loved are vital to our very existence and sense of belonging. Twenty years later, I am reminded of the retreat and Luke's stories, and figures like Mary Magdalene and Paul who saw life's challenges as opportunities for change. They were given choices to either enter into a renewed relationship with themselves and others, or remain the same. They came to believe that participating fully in human relationship is participating fully into the life of God. Like those memorialized in Luke's writings, we, too, believe in this life principle and trust without question that committing time, energy and affection to that special someone is the stuff that makes a day worth living. If this is the truth about love, then why does it hurt so badly when it doesn't turn our the way we want? 
fu a campus minister, I am humbled by the stories students share with me regarding personal relationships and how these affectionate associations have helped to shape their self perception. Through your sharing with me and others, members of our Campus Ministry staff have developed an interactive workshop entitled "Building Healthy Relationships", which is now a mandatory requirement for incoming first year students. I facilitated a small group session in one ofthe workshops and the question was asked, "what makes men and women different?"' Without a thought, a young man answered, "the way we think." An obvious answer, yes, and a profound one indeed. The way we think influences the way we act and respond to each other. And this, hands down, is the toughest obstacle to maintaining common ground. 
What we have come to realize through your stories is that sustaining a healthy, platonic, and wholesome relationship at colleges like Notre Dame is no small task. The tension between being a good student, leader, and an attentive and compassionate partner is, at times, a burden to successfully navigate in the course of a day. Yet, you cherish the experience and find ways to hang on to the hopeful ideal of finding that special someone to share life with. And then it happens. Just when you think things are going well, the "we have to talk" phrase shakes up your world. This is where Luke comes in. 
Was Jesus rebuking the wind and the raging water in calming the Sea of Galilee a true story? Or the five thousand? Was everyone fed with only five loaves of bread and two fish? And the woman who had been hemorrhaging for twelve years, was she really cured when she touched Jesus' coat? What was it about Jesus that kept people retelling these stories for generations? Who told the stories and kept them alive? And what did they see in him that they didn't see in themselves? The answer: his self esteem and love. Jesus knew who he was. By never disavowing his self worth and trust in God, he was able to make the well being of others his pnmary purpose. In loving himself, his God and others without compromise, he lived an other-centered existence. 
Hearts are God's property. Matters of the heart are orchestrated by God. When a relationship takes an unexpected turn and your heart begins to ache, your first impulse is to be still and steady your Spirit. In your silence, you replay the entire relationship in your mind and try to figure out what you did wrong. Or you pretend that your new found freedom will instantaneously replace the void once filled with a regular and familiar routine with your significant other. Whether you are the bearer or receiver ofthe "news," breaking up with a treasured companion is hard. But what Luke tells us is that even though your heart may be caught in the storm, it's not your heart to mend. It's God's. 
Jesus is love incarnate and relationships allow us to participate in God's love rapture. People enter our lives to assist in our self discovery. They come in al1 shapes, colors, class, religions, and genders. Some stay, some move on, yet everyone we meet has inevitably had some transformative impact on our life journey. Cherish the moments. Be thankful for the different kinds of relationships in your life that make you feel human and alive. And most ofall, step back, see and appreciate how much you have grown. It takes courage to open your heart and let someone in. And because you weren't afraid, you've been changed. And love takes on new meanmg.

Bears release returner Milburn 
Asso.:iaced Press 
LAKE FOREST. Ill. 

Glyn Milburn made the Pro Bowl two years ago and set the Chicago Bears' career record for kickoff return yardage last sea­son. 
On Wednesday, he was released following his performance last Sunday that saw him botch one kickoff that hit him in the face­mask and fumble another away. 
"It wasn't a decision based on one day. It was over time and really more of a function of strengthening the overall team,"Bears coach Dick Jauron said Wednesday.

Detroit, was acquired by the Bears in a 1998 trade with Green Bay. 
Milburn had 4,596 kickoff return yards for the Bears and last season broke Dennis Gentry's team mark. He's also fourth on the Bears' career punt return yardage chart with 970 yards on 94 returns. He twisted his ankle Sunday on a punt return and had to leave the game. 
Jauron said Leon Johnson, Autry Denson and defensive back 
R.W. McQuarters could take over the kick return duties. Defensive back Jerry Azumah is another option for Sunday's game in Cincinnati. 
Johnson, who missed last sea­son with a knee injury, set a New York Jets' season record for punt returns as a rookie in 1997 with 619 yards on 51 returns. 
"Some people are saying it might be my last go, so I got to make the most of it,"said Johnson, signed earlier this month. "Hopefully I'll get my shot." 
Denson, while with the Dolphins last season, averaged 24.8 yards per kickoff return. 
And McQuarters, who returned a fumble 69 yards for a TD last week against the Cardinals, had a 58-yard punt return for a score in the preseason. 
The 5-foot-8 Milburn had 2,025 all-purpose yards in 1999 -when he also caught 20 passes -to become Chicago's first player in the Pro Bowl in five years.

Milburn joins the list of veteran players let go by the Bears in gen­eral manager Jerry Angelo's first season, including Mike Wells, Bobby Engram, Clyde Simmons and Thomas Smith. 
The Bears on Wednesday also signed fullback Stanley Pritchett, who played last season with the Eagles and rushed for 225 yards while catching 25 passes. He was released by Philadelphia before the season. 
Pritchett is insurance for the Bears at fullback as Daimon Shelton appeals the results of a test that could lead to his suspen­sion under the league's banned substance policy. 
NASCAR 
League orders use of head restraints 
Associated Press 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. 

NASCAR ordered the imme­diate use of head-and-neck restraints for its top three series Wednesday, trying to improve safety after a string of fatal crashes, including Dale Earnhardt's. 
Effective this weekend, dri­vers in the Winston Cup, Busch and Craftsman Truck series must wear either a HANS or Hutchens device at any time they are on the track during a NASCAR-sanctioned event. 
NASCAR has encouraged dri­vers to wear a restraint sys­tem this season, but had declined to make them mandatory before Wednesday. On a regular basis, 42 of the 43 Winston Cup drivers volun­tarily wear one of the two devices. 
"The driving force for the mandate was the level of com­fort among the teams and dri­vers in wearing the devices," NASCAR vice president George Pyne said. "Initially, we didn't feel it was appropriate or the right thing to do to make our drivers feel less safe. 
"But NASCAR has worked closely with safety experts, drivers and manufacturers to address issues that led some drivers to feel that these devices might make them less safe. As time has gone on and teams have grown more com­fortable with them, we felt it was the right thing to do." 
Jeff Gordon, the three-time series champion and current points leader, applauded the decision. Gordon, who wears a HANS device, said he had been uncomfortable until now about NASCAR making restraints mandatory. 
"It took me time to get com­fortable to wearing the device and also understand the way it works," Gordon said. "I do think that it is now the right time. I am a true, true believ­er in them."

After throwing three intercep­tions against the Buccaneers, one of which was returned 98 yards for a touchdown, Favre sliced apart the Ravens, completing 27 of :H passes for :B7 yards, three TDs and no interceptions. 
Favre won his sixth career offensive player of the week award for bis efforts in Green Bay's 31-23 victory OVM Baltimore, which gave him a franchise-best 95 career wins, one more than Hart Starr, and moved him ahead of Terry Bradshaw for best home winning percentage (.849) by a starting quarterback in NFL history.

ALCS 
Pettitte pitches Yankees to game 1 victory 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE 

Playing with the poise and patience that have become sta­ples of their October suc1.:ess, the New York Yankees were charged up from the get-go. 
And that meant real trouble for these Seattle Mariners. 
Andy Pettitte pitched eight sharp innings, Paul O'Neill. homered and the throe-time defending World Series winners opened the AL Championship Series with a 4-2 victory Wednesdav that was not nearly as close ·as the scoreboard showed. 
"We're used to playing big games," O'Neill said. "We've got jitters and nerves like every­body else. But when we take the field, we've been successful" 
The Mariners scored a run off Mariano Rivera in the ninth, bringing up Edgar Martinez as the tying run. But Rivera broke Martinez's bat on a game-end­ing groundout. 
The Yankees, meanwhile, were ready from the first pitch even before it. 
While the Mariners were still in the dugout preparing to take the field. Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter already had sprung to the on-deck circle. 
Swinging their bats and study­ing Seattle starter Aaron Sele, they even nodded at each other, confident. 
Knoblauch singled on the first pitch and Jeter followed with a long fly that had the sellout crowd of 47,644 at Safeco Field groaning. 
The ball was caught, but it was clear the Yankees were on their way. 
Taking advantage of plate umpire Ed Montague's tight strike zone, the Yankees worked the count all afternoon. The slumping O'Neill hit a two­run homer in the fourth inning on Selo's 66th pitch. 
Jeter didn't do much, other than hit the dirt on a high-and­tight fastball from Sele, but the Yankees didn't need him a lot on this day. 
Especially with Pettitte hold­ing Seattle hitless until the tilth inning and allowing only three bits, and Rivera finishing off the ninth for another postseason save. 
"Obviously, when you've had success in the postscason, you can alwavs lean on it," Pettitte said. · 
Too tired from three cross­country trips in five days'? Nope. Too drained from their stirring comeback over Oakland in the first round of the playoffs? Not a chance. 
O'Neill went to dinner with Pettitte on Tuesday night, and liked what he saw. 
"lie was ready to go," O'Neill said.-"You just knew from the first pitch if he makes his pitch­es, we're going to win." 
Instead, it was the Mariners, the team that tied a major league record with 116 victories and then saved its season with two wins against Cleveland who appeared back on their heels and flipped over them a couple of times. 
Sure-handed lchiro Suzuki stumbled fielding a ball in right field, third baseman David Bell slipped trying to chase down Knoblauch's RBI single and manager Lou Piniella shouted at three different umpires. 
"They've got good starting pitching, and we know that;'' Pinie!la said. "They spent quite a bit of money on it, and it shows." 
Garcia will be working on three days' rest for the second time in his career on June 1, 1999, he gave up six runs in 5 1/3 innings against. Baltimore. 
With security tight at Safeco and a moment of silence to honor the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Piniella and Yankees manager Joe Torre exchanged an extra handshake after the pregame introductions. 
Then, the Yankees went to work, as always. 
-...I put a lot of weight on post­season experience. I think it eliminates the unknown," Torre said. 
Jorge Posada drew a leadof'f hesitated, wav­

ing home the slow-footed Posada. 
Tberun scored easily and Knoblauch, whom Seattle talked about trading for in midseason. finished with three hits. 
Posada led off the fourth with a drive into the corner and brazenly _challenged Suzuki's rocket arm. 
The throw beat Posada, yet he 
barely managed to slide around 
shortstop Carlos Guillen ·s tag. 
Guillen, who missed the 
Cleveland series because of pul­monary tuberculosis, received a · standing ovation when he bat­ted in the first inning. Perhaps his timing was a bit off, howev­
er, as his tag was slow. 
O'Neill, i_rnly 1-for-11 and 
benched twice in the opening 
round, followed with a line 
drive into the right-field seats 
for a 3-0 lead. 
That was plenty for Pettitte, 
who got the Mariners to chase 
his breaking balls. Ho permitted 
just one runner until Martirwz

Mike Cameron followed with a 
double, but Pettitte limited the 
damage by holding Seattle to 
John Olerud's RBI groun<lout 
and striking out a squawking 
Jay Buhner and Dan Wilson. 
Soriano opened the ninth with 
a shot off the left-field score­
board. But the rookie stood and 
admired the drive, thinking it 
was a home run, and was held 
to a single. 
It was the only un-Yankeelike 
play of the day and it did not

Now, the Mariners must hope Freddy Garcia can get tlrnm even in the walk in the second and Alfonso Soriano blooped a two-out sin­gle that Suzuki fell trying to handle. 

"As you saw, that was not a divot," Suzuki said through a translator.

NFL 
Griese promises to play Sunday 

Associated Press 
DENVER Brian Griese doesn't under­stand all the fuss. 
Bothered by a sore throwing shoulder, the Denver quarter­back did not practice Wednesday but remained confi­dent he will play Sunday when the Broncos (3-2) travel to San Diego (3-2). 
"I don't know whether you guys arc just making a big deal out of it or what, but I think I'm going to play this week," he said. 
Griese, who had reconstruc., tivP surgery on his right shoul­der in January, began experi­encing soreness in the shoulder two weeks ago and played through the pain during a 34-21 loss to the Seattle Seahawks last week.

"Wednesdays I don't do much anyway," Griese said. "I split all the reps with Gus and we don't have as long of practice as we do on Thursday. I go through everything mentally, so the game is more mental for me than it is physical anyway. I don't think it hurts me in any way, shape or form." 
The Broncos went 5-1 with Frerotte down th stretch last season after Griese separated his shoulder, and a year of expe­rience in Denver's offense has

the Chargers. 
· "It was a crazy game," he said. "We ended up having to shoot it out. [t was like we were in two­minute offense the whole game." 
Whether Frerotte will make a San Diego encore depends on Griese's improvement over the next few days. Such is the life of a backup quarterback. 
"You know your role," Frerotte said. ~'If I was the starter and I was healthy Saturday, I'd be like, "Hey, I'm playing no matter what.' That's just the way it goes.'' 

Cowboy's Leaf making improvement 
Associated Press 

IRVING, Texas Maybe Ryan Leafreally is maturing. Seeing his last name misspelled "Leif' on the cover of 
his Dallas Cowboys playbook, the quarterback known more fo_r throwing fits than spirals just smiled and 
laughed. 

Asked about a wrist problem that caused him to fail a physical last month, Leaf said, "Nothing's wrong with it at all," then politely answered follow-up questions. He even managed to change the subject by injecting some self-deprecating humor. 
"Every once in a while a ball might get away from me a little bit, but that's 


been the case before. So now I can just Leaf blame it on the wrist," he said. 
Leaf was in good spirits Wednesday, a day after Cowboys coach Dave Campo said his newest quarterback would be closely evaluated the next six weeks while starter Quincy Carter is hobbled. "This is the open window," CampQ said. 
Leaf then spent most of the afternoon practicing with the first team. Temporary starter Anthony Wright was given the day offbecause of swelling in his right knee. 
Evaluating quarterbacks is the theme of Dallas' sea­son. Coaches expected to take a long look at Carter, their top draft pick, but he's played only five quarters because of injuries and is out for six more weeks while recover­ing from hamstring surgery. 
Wright has made three starts in Carter's place, but the team isn't seriously considering him as their long-term answer. If they thought he was, they wouldn't have signed Leaf, who went from the No. 2 pick of the 1998 draft to unemployed. 
Leaf said he probably could be ready to start against the Cardinals. 
"I wouldn't say that is a ludicrous idea, but I think Anthony.has played well since he's been back there," he said. "I don't want to cause any distractions or take the focus away from how hard this team works. 
"I want to work my way into the lineup whatever way I can. When coach Campo believes it's time for me to try to help this ballclub, I'm going to be ready." 
The Cowboys, who wanted to sign him when he was first available, were ready to do it soon after he was released only to be turned away by the wrist problem. A month without throwing apparently was all the recovery he needed. · 
'Tm not bothered by it," Leaf said. "Until it falls off, I'll be out there." 
At 25, Leaf is young enough to have many seasons left in him. And with 18 starts, he has more experience than the other Cowboys quarterbacks combined. 
The big hangup has been his demeanor. He fought with teamm.ates, management and fans throughout his three years in San Diego. Overcoming that well-earned reputation as a troublemaker is as important as turning around his ratio of 33 interceptions to 13 touchdowns. 
Dallas quarterback coach Wade Wilson believes Leaf can do it. Wilson has found Leaf to be a dedicated work­er in the classroom and is looking forward to seeing him on the field. 
"Any time a young guy plays, they're going to make mistakes. It's just how mentally strong they can he to deal with that," said Wilson, who was an NFL QB l't 19 seasons. "Some people handle it better than others. Now I think he's at the point where he's learned from his mis­takes.'' 
Wilson has watched tapes of every NFL game Leaf has played and considers all his mistakes correctable. Wilson said Leaf has as strong an arm as Troy Aikman, who parlayed talent and smarts into three Super Bowl titles during his 12 years in Dallas. 
"Ryan is physkaUy capable of throwing the football with anybody in the league right now," Wilson said. I ,cal' rccogniws he may not get many more chances to resurrect his once-promising career. 
"They say the average length of an NFI. earner is 3 1/2 years and that's right \Vhere I'm at.'' he said. "I've told my wife this is probably my last chance, so I've got to make the most ofit. I like the situation I'm in." 
Yet Leaf' is being cautious. So far, he's only renting a home. 
"When they want to give me that 10-year deal," he said, smiling again, "then I'll buy something.''

Busy week entertains 
Well, its been a busy week in the world of sports and in case you don't happen to have espn.com set as your default homepage. you might have missed out on some of the major occur­rences that have devel­oped of late. 
Fear 

not. 
sports fans, I have been on top of it all and am here to bring you a brief summary of some of the big­ger events to rock the sports world. Hang on tight and enjoy your weekly briefing. 
. The Yankees stave off play­off elimination. beating Oakland 3-2 in their division­al playoff series 
I don't know how they do it but America's oldest team still seems to come up huge in the clutch. True, the majority of their team (Roger Clemens, El Duque, Tino Martinez) will be up for Social Security by the end of the playoffs, but that doesn't seem to prevent these guys from producing. 
Heck, at this rate, the Yanks could probably plug Boggs and Mattingly into the lineup and watch them hit .400. It's just absurd. The only consolation in this will be watching Seattle bounce these chumps out of the play­offs in four games. (Note: The Yankees just completed a game one 4-2 victory over the Mariners -what! How the heck did that happen?). 


. The Notre Dame offense comes alive to the tune of 345 rushing yards and 34 points against West Virginia 
Sure, the halfback plunge looks great on a slippery field against a mediocre defense, but can we play this well against top-tier competition? 
Okay, let's be fair: The offensive line played superbly against the Mountaineers, but the Irish are still going to have to be a little more suc­cessful passing the football if they hope to earn a victory against USC next week. 
. Michael Jordan scores 18 points against the Heat in preseason NBA action: 
With all those MJ worship­pers out there jumping for joy, it's easy to get caught up in the hype and forget that Jordan will be 39-years old in February. However, the Wizards do look like a some­what respectable team this year and maybe the leader­ship of a savvy superstar is just what they need. 
We may not be looking a Chicago dynasty, but at least this comeback appears respectable. Just try to close your eyes and look away when Jordan gets a thorough schooling at the hands of the Bryants, McGradys and Carters of the league.

The surprising New York Islanders have jumped out to the NHL's best regular sea­son record through two weeks of play: Huh? NHL'1 When did that whole thing begin? Wow, I really missed the boat on that one. No big deal, though. Just wake me when the Stanley Cup finals begin.

The Dallas Cowboys earn a tough 9-7 victory against the Washington Redskins in a fierce Monday night football battle: Honestly, can football get any more exciting than this? When Anthony Wright isn't throwing interceptions and Stephen Davis isn't coughing up fumbles, we are treated to a plethora of missed field goals and penal­ties -as if this epic battle for draft position wasn't enough to keep us entertained! 


Plus, the obligatory shots of Daniel Snyder and Jerry Jones pacing nervously in their respective luxury boxes makes for added viewing enjoyment. It's just a shame these teams only play each other twice a year.

Belles blow 2 goal lead, fall to Comets 
By KATRINA KALASKY 
Sports Writer 
ln their first home game in two weeks, the Belles stayed close with Olivet before falling 5-4 
after 13 minutes of overtime Wednesday. 
The game started out slowly. Only two goals were scored 


in the first Johnston 
half, both by Olivet. 
In the first six minutes of the second half. Saint Mary's junior Heather Muth scored 
three times in a row to put the Belles up 3-2. Freshman Jen Concannon assisted the third goal. 
Nine minutes later, Concannon scored to add 
another point for the Belles. 
It looked as though a win was in the bag for Saint Mary's until Olivet scored twice to bring the Comets even with the Belles. 
This meant sudden death to determine the winner. 
With two and a half min­utes left in overtime, the Comets scored the game-win­ner off of a corner kick. 
"We started out real slow, it was 0-2 at the half," Concannon said. "Then we came back to make the score 4-2. Then we let down a lit­tle. It is a very hard loss because it was our chance to move up to fourth in the con­ference." 
It was a very eventful and stressful second half for the Belles and their fans. 
Head coach Bobby Johnston described the change from the first half to

Grant ready for debut 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Associate Sporrs Editor 
With tailbacks Julius Jones and Tony Fisher not practicing for the second day in a row due to injuries, Notre Dame 
h e a d coach Bob Davie sug­gested that freshman R y a n G r a n t might play his first 

snap in a Grant collegiate g a m e against USC this weekend. 
"Right now it looks like Terrance lloward and Ryan Grant [will be playing most of 
the time !!iaturdayl," Davie said after practice Wednesday. "We're a little knicked up right now, so it's a concern." 
Davie said Fisher sat out practice with a knee injury, while Jones was nursing a sore Achilles tendon. He listed both tailbacks as doubtful for Saturday's game. 

"We rely so much on the running game and the timing of things," Davie said. "From a continuity standpoint, we're a little bit out of whack." 
Notre Dame's current tail­back situation is similar to the beginning of the season, when Fisher, Jones, Howard and Grant were all injured during the first week of practice. In fact, the injuries were so numerous that at one point, junior Chris Yura and fresh­man Marcus Wilson -unlist­ed on the Irish depth chart ­were carrying the brunt of the tailback duties before they got injured, too. 
With the possibility that Fisher and Jones will be unable to compete Saturday, Davie said Howard and Grant would probably see playing time against USC. And while Davie said he was confident in both tailbacks, Howard and Grant haven't seen much play­ing time. 
Howard has only carried the ball seven times for 11 yards so far this year. While he has played in all five of Notre Dame's games and started against Nebraska, he did not carry the ball against Michigan State and Texas A&M after fumbling on Notre Dame's offensive first play of the season against Nebraska. 
Grant has yet to see any playing time so far this year, but coaches plan to play the freshman sometime this year. Last week, Davie said he 
. hoped Grant would get his first carry: but coaches were unable to put him in the game. But this week, that seems almost certain to change. And Grant said he's ready to play. 'Tm just trying to stay focused and work hard," he said. "I go into every game feeling like I'm ready to play. You never know what hap­pens." The young freshman quickly caught coaches' eyes at the beginning of training camp. Grant, who was named the player of the year for New Jersey by USA Today his
