Schlereth describes Sorin's philosopt:Jy 
By CARA ECKMAN 
News Writer 
Father Edward Sarin imple­mented his educational philoso­phy through his roles as founder, president, and over­seer of Notre Dame, according to Thomas Schlereth, professor of American studies. 
In his lecture, titled "Sarin of Notre Dame," Schlereth dis­cussed Sorin's expansion of Notre Dame's curriculum, view of Notre Dame's faculty and stu­dents, and educational legacy. 
Sarin founded Notre Dame with a traditional and educa­tional philosophy, according to Schlereth. The curriculum em­phasized classical works, as well as a preparatory course whi h included the study of English, algebra, and logic, he said. 
In founding the University Sorin actively sought advice from administrators of other educational institutes, Schlereth said. In his letters to them, Sorin inquired about issues such as the admittance of non­Catholics, appropriate texts, co­education, and tuition fees. 
As president, Sorin was eager to expand the student popula­tion of the University, said Schlereth. "He would in part judge the success of his institu­tion by the numbers of heads in the house," he said. 
Sarin also hoped to expand Notre Dame to other locations in the United States, according to Schlereth. Under Sorin's guidance, the Congregation of the Holy Cross successfully established several -secondary and primary educational insti­tutions, he said. 
According to Schlereth, the establishment of Saint Mary's College came "out of this con­cern for expanding the work of Notre Dame as an educational place." 
Under Sorin's presidency, the scope of Notre Dame's curricu­lum increased significantly, Schlereth asserted. By 1865, Notre Dame had added a two year course in the study of business and commerce, he said. 
Schlereth suggested that the business program was initiated

WASHINGTON (AP) Congress labored Tuesday to complete its work for the year by passing major bills to build 
1-I highways, aid the Soviets and 
! protect Americans' bank de­posits. But plans to adjourn be­fore Thanksgiving were thrown into doubt as President Bush dared Democrats to consider a tax cut plan. House Speaker Thomas Foley, angered by comments by Bush and other Republicans, met with fellow congressional leaders and pushed to bring Congress back on Dec. 10 to publicly debate Democratic tax proposals versus a House GOP plan that Bush embraced. 
"Whether we can get it (a tax bill) done depends on what the president can accept," said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif. 
The discussions came amid a rush of legislation aimed at reaching adjournment Tuesday night, and hours after Bush, under attack from the GOP right wing, expressed enthusiasm for a House Republican plan including a capital gains tax cut. 
The talk of a December ses­sion was part of the battle for a political leg up before the final gavel, as both Democrats and Republicans tried to cast their parties in the best light going into the 1992 election year.

Increases need for aid 
WAS HINGT ON(AP)-Th e economic slump has charities struggling to cope with increased numbers of people seeking aid this Thanksgiving, including a "new class of poor" who were the donors of past years, officials say. 
A Connecticut church group is turning people away in what its director calls "the most heart-wrenching decision I've ever had to make." 
In Michigan, which abolished welfare for 83,000 adults last month, a soup kitchen is facing "astronomical" demand. 
In Burlington, Vt., the emer­gency food service is trying to serve up to 20 percent more people with only a tiny increase in donations. 
"Don't tell me that the reces­sion is over," said Ruth Shecter, executive director of the Housing Information Center in Kansas City, Mo. "President Bush needs to walk with the people and find out what it re-

Congress struggles to adjourn before Thanksgiving 
Bush blasted at Congress anew for going all year without considering his own tax pro­posals and for having failed to produce a crime bill to his lik­ing. 
The anti-crime version fa­vored by Democrats, he groused, would do little to make sure the convicts on Death Row are executed without endless appeals. Without his support, Democrats were left hunting for enough votes and the bill was in jeopardy regardless of the adjournment date, even though it expands the federal death penalty to 53 additional crimes. 
Democrats brought out Jim Brady, former press secretary to President Reagan, in a last­ditch effort to win over liberals who objected to the measure. 
"The president is holding a gun to the head of the Brady Bill," said Rep. Charles Schumer, 0-N.Y., referring to the five-day waiting period for gun purchases included in the crime bill and named after Brady, who was severely wounded by a handgun bullet intended for Reagan. 
But it was the GOP chiding on the economy that got the Democrats' goat, during a particularly rancorous day. 
"If they want to pass this, let them pass it today.... This idea of dancinf;! around -that's not good enough for the American people," the president said in a statement to reporters later read on the House floor by Hep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House Minority Whip. 
But Democrats said the Re­publican plan to stimulate the lackluster economy actually amounted to a giveaway to the rich -and welcomed the com­parison.

Wozniak: Economy in Europe changes

News Writer 
The 1980s has marked a change in southern Europe from national economies to subnational and international economies, according to Lynne Wozniak, assistant professor of government at Notre Dame. 
In a lecture yesterday titled "The Changing Political Economy of Southern European Capitalism," Wozniak defined political economy as the relationship between state labor and capitaL 
Tracing the history of southern European countries, namely Spain, Portugal, and Italy, she explained that from the late 1940s to the mid to late 1970s all bargaining occurred at a national level, and that the 1980s marked a change. 
There has been a "dual shift" in the policy-making of Southern European countries, according to Wozniak. Decisions are now made on a subnational and international level, rather than on

Thanksgiving memories live forever 
Thanksgiving. 
For most, the holiday conjures images of gluttony, distasteful relatives and cranberry sauce shaped like a can. 
But for me, Thanksgiving holds a far deeper significance. It

will always be the day that cousin Chris threw up on Asst. Viewpoint the dog. 
Editor
I was 12 when my family decided to trek to ------­Ohio to spend Thanksgiving with my mother's family. The decision was an exciting one: we kids would get out of school a day early and would not have to wash the turkey pan. Unfortunately, my elation at leaving school 

, early was soon quashed by 15 hours crammed into a closed car with my younger brothers. 
Somehow we arrived at Grandma's without killing each other. There was nothing to do at Grandma's, but at least we were out of the car. 
After several hours of watching the snow fall and refusing food (thank you, Grandma, but I've had enough chili} we went to bed. 
We awoke Thanksgiving morning to the smell of roasting turkey. To get ahead of the game, Grandma had begun cooking as soon as we had gone to sleep. 
All that was left to do was wait for the rest of the family. 
The relatives trickled in all morning, num­bering about 20 by dinner time. We had olentv of time to ~et reacquainted and begin
bickering. 
By late afternoon we had thoroughly an­noyed each other and were ready to eat to­gether as a family. Only Auntie Joan and her children were missing. 
After 10 minutes of anxious waiting, we decided to start dinner without them. What's a few more relatives, anyway? So we laid out the Thanksgiving spread and began to dig 
in. 
Minutes later the front door opened. In walked Auntie Joan and my younger cousin Chris. 
Auntie had neglected to tell us that Chris was suffering from a touch of the stomach· flu, but Chris remembered. 
He looked at the table of steaming food·, gazed at his mother for a moment, then turned and threw up on the dog. 
Brandy (the dog) looked indignantly at Chris and began running around the living room, pausing occasionally to shake herself and spatter chunks of vomit on Grandma's walls and furniture. 
The kids screamed with delight. Grandma paled. Auntie Joan blushed. The uncles chased Brandy. 
Dad said that next Thanksgiving would be spent in New York with his side of the family. Mom glared at Dad. Chris, feeling better, sat down for some turkey. At last we were all to­gether. 
Unfortunately, we never had Thanksgiving dinner at Grandma's again: too traumatic for Brandy. 
But at least I have the memories. And someday I may have grandchildren of my own to entertain me on the holidays.

Yeltsin restructures the KGB 
•MOSCOW-Boris Yeltsin signed a 
decree Tuesday recasting the Russian KGB into a new State Security Agency, the latest move by the republic's president to reorganize the secret police. The new agency will be re­sponsible for intelligence, counter­intelligence, fighting organized crime, uprooting corruption and combating 

terrorism within Russia. The Soviet KGB remains, but some of its many functions have been divided up among newly created agencies since the failed August coup against President Mikhail Gorbachev, in which former KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov was a conspirator. The Soviet KGB is expected to cooperate with the new Russian agency, but it is unclear how they will share responsibilities and authority.Yeltsin's government has steadily been stripping power over the economy, science, culture and other fields from Gorbachev's central government. 

Leaders of developing nations gather

cused Bush of gamesmanship, and said if the president wanted serious consideration of a tax cut, he should call on lawmakers to stay and deliberate over Thanksgiving. As Congress worked into the night, Democrats said Foley was considering bringing the House back into session Dec. 10 for public hearings comparing Democratic tax proposals with the GOP plan. That idea got a cool reception from Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole. With the 11th-hour tax-cut proposals given little chance for consideration Tuesday, Foley said he would keep the House in session if Bush gave the word. 
Many staying home for Thanksgiving 
•NEW YORK -Fewer Americans plan to hit the road this Thanksgiving holiday, partly due to the lingering recession. The American Automobile Association predicts 
19.5 million folks will travel 100 miles or more from home by auto to observe the Thursday holiday. That's down 4 percent from the 20.4 million who ventured out for turkey feasts last Thanksgiving, the auto club said. Even though gasoline prices are sharply lower this year, the AAA projection of holiday travelers is the lowest since the group began this type of survey during the height of the economic boom in 1985. The responses AAA got in this year's survey showed that the recession has a far greater impact on people's travel plans than higher gasoline prices did. The per-gallon price is about 22 cents cheaper this week than it was a year ago, when Iraq's occupation of Kuwait spooked the oil markets, but that didn't keep as many people home.

Purdue janitor sentenced for murder 
•LAFAYETTE, Ind. -A former Purdue University custodian was sentenced to 60 years in prison Tuesday for fatally shooting his former supervisor in her campus office earlier this year. Tippecanoe County Circuit Judge Ronald Melichar gave Robert Lyon, 59, the maximum sentence for fatally shooting his former boss, Barbara Clark, 41, a building service supervisor at Purdue University on Feb. 20. Public defender Michael Duckett said Lyon plans to appeal the sentence. A Tippecanoe Circuit Court jury convicted Lyon Sept. 25 of Clark's murder after the defense tried to convince jurors he had been diagnosed as having mental defects before the shooting occurred. Two court-appointed psychiatrists testified that Lyon did not suffer from any mental disorder that prevented him from knowing right from wrong. Lyon confessed to the shooting shortly afterward, but later pleaded innocent.

Capt. Phil Murphy of the Sal­vation Army in Raleigh, N.C., said donations to his unit are off $18,000 from last year for the Christmas and winter relief drives, but the number of peo­ple seeking help has been ris­ing. 
"There are more people living from paycheck to paycheck than ever before," he said. "This is a whole different strata of people, and it's going to happen for some time." 
In Bridgeport, Conn., hard-hit by economic troubles, a coali­tion of churches known as Area Congregations Together, or ACT, is turning away about 100 families who sought Thanksgiv­ing food, out of about 250 who applied. 
"It's unbelievable, it's tragic, it's the most heart-wrenching decision I've ever had to make," said executive director Kathleen Samela. 
Donations to fund the holiday meal program are down so sharply that "we don't know if we can feed the families we've accepted, never mind the ones we've had to turn away," Samela said.

NY ensemble to bring Soviet music to/Snite 
Special to The Observer 
Continuum, a New York­based 20th century music ensemble, will perform a con­cert of Soviet music at 2 p.m. on Sunday, Dec. 1 in the Annan­berg Auditorium of the Snite Museum of Art. 
Currently directed by Joel Sachs and Cheryl Seltzer, Con­tinuum has given more than 500 concerts throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, as well as eight European tours in the last 25 years. 
As its name symbolizes, Con­tinuum aims to expand the au­dience for this century's music, embodying the philosophy that new and old music form an un­broken tradition. 
The ensemble has won the prestigious Siemens Foundation international prize for dis­tinguished service to music and the American Society of Com­posers, Authors and Publish­ers/Chamber Music America Award for adventuresome pro­gramming. 
Pianist Cheryl Seltzer, founder of the ensemble in 1966 and now its co-director, has been active in contemporary music since studying at Mills College and Columbia University. Seltzer made her professional debut with the San Francisco Symphony and appears as a soloist and an ensemble performer. 
She has participated in the Marlboro and Tanglewood Fes­tivals, she is at present educa­tional coordinator for music and dance at the Lucy Moses School of Music and Dance in New York and is active in the Stepan Wolfe Society, which oversees the restoration and publication of the composer·s works. 
Sachs, co-director of Contin­uum since 1968, performs reg­ularly as a soloist, conductor and chamber music player. A graduate of Harvard College, Sachs received his doctorate in musicology from Columbia Uni­versity and was a Guggenheim Fellow. 
In addition to his activities as a performer, which include par­ticipation in the Marlboro, Aspen and Santa Fe Chamber Music Festivals, he has written and lectured on many nine­teenth-and twentieth-century topics. 
He currently is on the faculty of the Julliard School of Music as coordinator of contemporary music, chairman of music history and director of the annual "Focus" festival of twentieth century music.

due to pressure from parents.
l According to Schlereth, one parent told Sorin that he wanted the business program so that his son could become "an erudite merchant and a so­phisticated businessman." Also during Sorin's presidency, a scientific course of study was begun at Notre Dame, Schlereth said. The program was encourage by "an impressive cadre of Holy Cross priests with a scientific bent," he said. The science department building, completed in 1882, was the first separate academic building at Notre Dame. In 1865, Sarin also became the overseer of Notre Dame. Responding again to pressure from parents, Sarin decided to include engineering in Notre Dame's curriculum, making ND the fu-st Catholic school to offer engineering on a collegiate level, he said. "If Sorin did not make it as a parish priest, as a missionary, he would have been a lawyer," Schlereth quipped. He said that Sarin was interested in estab­lishing a law school as early as 1850. It was not until 1870 that the Notre Dame law school became a reality. Schlereth also stated that Sorin unsuccessfully attempted to establish a medical school and a school of agriculture at Notre Dame. 

Sarin viewed the Holy Cross members to be the core of his faculty, said Schlereth. He re­garded Notre Dame's lay fac­ulty, which included non­Catholics, as religious without vows, according to Schlereth. All faculty were expected to teach in a wide variety of disci­plines, he said. 
Sarin's major concern with the students, said Schlereth, was "how to keep them, and how to keep them in order." This was accomplished by keeping them "unbelievably busy," he said. 
Schlereth presented a criti­cism of the students under Sorin. In 1868, Timothy Howard, a Notre Dame profes­sor said of the students, "Study among them is superficial... Students study whatever branches they seem to please." 
Schlereth concluded by noting that the legacy of Sarin is visi­ble in the various images of him which appear on Notre Dame's campus. "The man was a Janus-like, often paradoxical, but multifaceted individual," said Schlereth. 
Schlereth is the author of sev­eral books, including "The Uni­versity of Notre Dame: A Por­trait of its History and Cam­pus." 
The lecture, presented yester­day in the Hesburgh Library Auditorium Lounge, was spon­sored by the Graduate School, the Notre Dame chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, and the depart­ment of American studies.

All those letters, and even a box of Preparation H 
Tongue-in-cheek writing is easy for me. My brain is hy­peractive, and I have a big tongue -not to mention mouth. So I hardly expected the deluge of mail in response to my first few articles, although I knew that receiving some mail was a distinct possibility. Here are samples of the most interesting letters to date along with my responses. 
With regards to my overall style and content, one reader commented quite favorably: 
Dear Gary, 
The ease with which I can read your articles is a refresh­ing break from the hard news style so commonly used in The Observer. Of course I know you are not capable of using words longer than two syllables, but that is the charm of it all. Keep up the good work, son. 
Love, 
Mom 

DearMom, "' 
Thanks for the kind words. Gee, Mom, didn't I tell you to quit embarrassing me in pub­lic? You always do that. Send money for pizza and books. 
Love, 
Gary 

Another reader compared the quality of my articles with those of other writers at The Observer. 
Dear Gary, 
I've read with interest your columns that appear every other Wednesday. While your content and style do not rival other great Observer writers, say one whose column appears every third Wednesday, you are sometimes interesting. Not often, mind you, but sometimes. Keep plugging away and maybe editor? Could this be another 
scandal in the daytime drama, 
"As the Dome Rotates?" 
AitTectionaitely,

My eavesdropping on Dick Enberg, Bill Walsh, Dick Vitale, and Aaron Taylor attracted some interesting mail. Here's every piece of mail I received on this issue:

P.S. I have the perfect use for the Preparation H. Thanks again. 
Dear Canonsburg Writer, 
I cannot believe that you would "dissed" me like you did, especially since I am from the Strabane suburb of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. I'll be sure not to share any of my Lucky Charms with you! And if you ever use the stairs past the ninth floor of Flanner, my sec­tion will get you.

Dear Leprechaun, 
I was the first person to take 
you to Fat Shirley's Diner your 
freshman year. In fact, I think I 
was the only person who would 
talk to you the entire year. Of 
course, it was out of pity for 
someone who also attended my 
high school. Now that you are a 
campus celebrity and have one 
friend, don't get on your high

make it sound like you could get 
a date on campus! I guess deep 
down inside we all know better.

Regarding the column that de­scribed my propensity to lose campus elections to slime balls and cats, the mail contained spirited language: 
Dear Animal Hater, 
Your vicious attacks against the cat that beat you in the Student Body Presidency race is just another blatant attempt of the established media to hinder the progress of cats in our country. Ignorance and dis­crimination abound throughout our male-dominated, dog-loving society. Attempts by you to discredit the eat's accomplish­ments are as bad as Bob Barker's attempts to spay and neuter felines to extinction. The next time you attempt to trivialize such historic events, look into the mirror at the trivia reflecting back. 
Meow, 
Morris 

Dear S_itty Kitty, 
Gag on a fur ball! Just be­cause you can't have sex, don't act like some Notre Dame stu­dents. We all know cats cannot be students -it's not in Du Lac. Your obsession for such recog­nition simply divides the cam­pus community. Campus con­formity is the norm. Either be­come a dog lover or cha, cha, cha outta here! 
Gary 

Dear Democratic Degenerate, 
Your liberal, Jimmy Carter type tactics of specifically nam­ing me as slime may have been accurate in the letter of your column, but not in spirit. Okay, I made a mistake by alluding to the hint that I might just have earned a degree from Notre Dame instead of Holy Cross Junior College. But to suggest that my intimidation tactics against Blacks at New Jersey polling places was a mean­spirited Republican ploy to de­feat Democrats is ridiculous. It was like the time I ran against you for Campus Life Council. It didn't matter that I was a Holy Cross student and not eligible to run. What mattered was that you did not get elected. And I not only was succeeded in preventing your election, but I WAS elected. What a blow for freedom and democracy! 
Jack Kelly 

P.S. Being fired by the Republican National Committee showed the world that I, like Ollie North, was really innocent. Some may consider me a martyr, but I'm really the Walrus, coo, coo, ca, choo. 
Dear Pinocchio Kelly,

LEI lEKS TO THE EDITOR 
Due to new St. Michael's policies, laundry machines should stay put 
Dear Editor: 
As this semester draws to a close, preparations are being made for the spring semester. One of the new items for next semester will be St. Michael's laundry. 
This past week, our parents received notification about the service. From what was stated in the letter, I have decided not to participate in the program. As a section representative in Flanner, I have also discussed washers and dryers which are in constant use. From what we hear now, the University is going to take most, if not all of them. 
Why? Because we are a guys' dorm and the male students are expected to use the laundry. This is unfair to those students in Flanner that want to do their own laundry. Yes, the University will say that there is not enough interest in Flanner to keep the machines, but the 
Why don't I and others in my section want to participate in the service? In simple terms it is a rip-ofT. It will cost me be­tween $25 and $50 more to send it to St. Michael's for a semester's worth of laundry. 
I also do not want tags all over my clothing with a Laundry J.D. number. I do not want to send clothes that need to be washed a certain way to a mass production laundry. 
Lastly, the policy for reim­lished is not worth the risk of sending the clothes. The laun­dry set a ceiling price for all different kinds of clothing and then will reimburse 60% of that for damaged or lost items. My question is where did they get these ..ceiling prices?" 
How many people on campus have dress shirts that cost $18, sweaters that cost $30, polos that cost $18, and sweat shirts that cost $12? The sweatshirts in the bookstore cost $40 and above are maximum reim­bursements as well, so I am as­suming they could be lower de­pending on the circumstances. What a deal! 
As it is now, my clothes get washed the way they are sup­posed to, when I want them, and for less money. Next semester, if the University takes away Flanner's machines, I will have to spend twice as much time doing laundry somewhere else or be forced to use St.

They've even come up with a snappy new motto with a · con temporary feel: "Crimestoppers: Together We Can Make It Happen."

The student estimated the loss to be inestimable.

Monday, Nov. 4, 7:21 p.m. A Walsh Hall resident reported the presence of a "creepy, hairy" and altogether suspicious person sleeping on the bench in front of the Hammes Bookstore "On the Campus." Notre Dame Security and Notre Dame Fire-along with several Irish Guardsmen-were dispatched to respond to the call. No suspects fitting the description were found, but a smallish, elderly woman clutching a shopping bag looked a little sinister. The suspect was reprimanded and read her rights. As she belligerently resisted arrest, she was subsequently impaled.

Thomas Stritch's book reflects on 60 years at ND 
By JOHN RYAN Accent Writer 
Thomas Stritch, professor emeritus of American Studies, has recorded the memories and reflections of his sixty years at Notre Dame in his new book "My Notre Dame." 
Published as part of the Sesquicentennial celebration, this unique book contains a personal, thought-provoking view of the history of Notre Dame since its' "diamond ju­bilee" in 1917. 
Upon his graduation in the spring of 1934 from the University of Notre Dame, Stitch was offered a job as a freshman English teacher. He began teaching immediately, despite his dreams of being a journalist. After six weeks of teaching, "I was hooked for life and I knew it," writes Stitch in his book. 
After serving a stint in the Navy during World War II, Stitch returned to teaching. He became the head of the Department of Journalism in 1946, and held the position for twenty-five years. He is cur­rently the Professor Emeritus of American Studies. 
Stritch arrived at Notre Dame as a student in 1930 on a trolley­car. The tuition was about $750 dollars, and the country was in the midst of the Great Depression. 
Notre Dame looked a little different then than it does today. Brand new buildings, such as Dillon and Alumni Halls, and the football stadium, had been erected, but "life was centered around the Main Building," said Stritch. The university was rel­atively small and removed from the surrounding communities. 
While the university was geo­graphically small, so was the student body, which was com­prised of about 3000 men. 
Practically 
anyone who 
graduated from a Catholic high 
school, and could afford the 
tuition, could come to Notre 
Dame. The student body was 
geographically diverse, but many 
of the young men came from 
similar Catholic backgrounds. 
Today, Notre Dame is a 
sprawling, internationally known 
university with about three times 
the enrollment of 1930 (not to 
mention an $18,000 tuition 
pricetag compared to the $750 of 
the early 1930s.). The local 
communities now strive upon the 
business that Notre Dame brings to them. No longer do the values of Notre Dame remain untapped. 
Despite the overall expansion of the university, Stritch believes that the modern Notre Dame is very similar to the Notre Dame he attended in his youth. "There are not enough differences to even discuss it," said Stritch. 
Stritch sees the same type of students walking the campus today as he saw in the early 1930s. The student body is more homogeneous today, possibly due to a more competitive applicant pool. "The differences are smoothed over; the edges are gone from 
[the student body]," explains Stitch. 
"My Notre Dame" is not a complete history of Notre Dame, but instead the book is a compilation of the memories of one of the university's legends. 
In his sixty years at Notre Dame, Stitch has had the plea­sure and privilege to experience everything about N_otre Dame. 
He combines amusing anec­dotes with interesting facts to produce a book filled with hon­esty, tradition, and pride. "It puts down in writing what [Notre Dame] parents have been yakking about for years," Stitch said. 
Topics such as sports, religion, and the arts at Notre Dame add flavor to Stritch's new book. He also discusses the presidents of the university, including a separate chapter on President Hesburgh, to whom Stitch credits much of the university's recent progress and accomplishments. 
This chapter, although written for "My Notre Dame," appears in "Theodore M. Hesburgh: A Bio­Bibliography," and several other chapters have been published in "Notre Dame Magazine". 
Stitch spent much time and effort in the production of the book. He concentrated on making it a "classy" book be­cause he felt that many of the books published about Notre Dame seem gaudy and superfi­cial. 
"My Notre Dame" is a 
wonderful tribute to both Stitch's 
life and years at Notre Dame, 
and the university itself. 
Because of its personal touch 
and sense of class, Stitch believes 
that his book is "a good thing for 
people who love Notre Dame to 
have." 
Anyone who has experienced this university will love "My Notre Dame" and the memories and thoughts it evokes. 

Michigan star wins Walter Camp Trophy 
DETROIT (AP) -Desmond Howard was awarded the Walter Camp Trophy on Tuesday, the first of what promises to be a harvest of postseason awards for the Michigan split end. 
The Camp trophy is given an­nually to college football's most outstanding player in balloting by coaches and sports informa­tion directors of Division 1-A schools. 
Last year's winner was Raghib "Rocket" Ismail of Notre Dame. 
Howard led the fourth­ranked Wolverines (10-1 overall, 8-0 Big Ten) to their 36th conference championship, their 14th outright, with a dazzling season. The 5-foot-9, 176-pounder scored 23 touchdowns and finished with 1,7 49 all-purpose yards. 
Women

since Notre Dame swept the season series from it last year. The Warriors have moved from the MCC to the Great Midwest Conference, and their run-and­gun attack, averaging 102 points per game, is spear­headed by three newcomers, in­cluding the team's leading scor­er, sophomore Kris Maskala 
(23.5 ppg). 
Two starters also return for Marquette. Seniors Tammy Shain (15.5 ppg, .583 field goal 
Hockey team pulls out overtime win at Merrimack 
Observer Staff Report 

The Notre Dame hockey team pulled off a dramatic win over Merrimack Uni­versity last night, pulling out a 2-1 overtime victory over the Warriors in North An­dover, Mass. The Irish im­proved to 5-4 on the year, while Merrimack fell to 5-6. 
Merrimack scored the only goal or the first two periods when Teal Fowler notched a score four minutes in to the second stanza for a 1-0 lead. 
. In the third period, the Warriors outshot the Irish 10­5 and appeared ready to take the win when Notre Dame pulled goalie Brent Lothrop with 50 seconds remaining in the game. 
The strategy paid off when freshman center John Rushin scored with only five seconds left in regulation to tie the score. Rushin's goal was his third of the year, and was as­sisted by Curtis Janicke and Dan Sawyer. 
In the overtime, Janicke got the game-winner just 1:42 into the period off an assist from defenseman Scott Vickman. 
The Irish, winners of four straight, now travel to Portland, Maine this weekend to take on second-ranked Maine in a two-game series. 
The Black Bears (6-1) have won three straight games, outscoring their opponents by a 22.7 margin in that stretch. All-American Jean-Yves Roy leads the Maine attack, already notching 16 points this season. 
Butler 
continued from page 12 
attempts in the nrst half to take 
a 35-31 halftime lead. 
Sweet sparked the only Irish run in the second half with two straight three-pointers from the left side to trim the Butler lead to 54-51. 
Butler then reeled off eight unanswered points to thwart any chance of an Irish comeback. Notre Dame scored just nine points in the final 8:38 of the game. 
..Defensively they were very aggressive," said MacLeod. "They made us go east-west instead of north-south and that caused us to put up some quick shots." 
With Notre Dame committing its seventh team foul at the 
10:11 mark of the second half, Butler had many chances to put the game out of reach, but Unished the half with 9-of-20 foul shooting. Notre Dame missed the front end of many bonus opportunities in the rtrSt half and ended with a 12-of-18 mark from the line. Notre Dame committed 18 turnovers, but outrebounded the Bulldogs 48­36 for the game. 
Bu tier began a full-court press with 13:00 left in the nrst half, which added to Notre Dame's woes in the frontcourt. 
"Defense won the game for us," said Butler coach Barry Collier. "They only had a couple of fast break baskets. I'm extremely pleased that we were able to play as well as we did for as long as we did." 
Collier got into the action himself at the 13:25 mark of the second half when Ellis intervened on a scuffie between Ellis, Bennett, and five-foot­nine, 155-pound guard Tim Bowen. 
"I was just trying to make sure it didn't get out of hand," said Ellis. "It wasn't a big deal." 
shooting) and Courtney Romeiser (14.5 ppg, 8.0 apg) provide stability for a team trying to rebound from last year's 7-20 campaign. 
..They're an entirely different team from last year, and we're going to have to be ready to play," said McGraw. "When you're looking for your first win like we are, you can't afford to have any kind of letdown." 
The Boilermakers (1-1) were upset in their season opener by Bowling Green 75-72 last Saturday evening, but came back to knock off Penn State 58-55 on Monday. The defend­ing Big Ten champs return only two starters from last year's 26­6 NCAA participant, but one of those two is All-American candidate MaChelle Joseph. 
Joseph, a 5-8 senior, is Purdue's all-time leading scorer and is the only Boilermaker av­eraging in double figures, scor­ing at a 23.5 ppg clip. Junior Tina Eddie (9.5 ppg, 8.5 rpg) provides them with a spark ofT the bench. 
"This is going to be another big test for us," noted McGraw. "We feel we could have beat Penn State (too), and now we have a chance to beat the team that beat them, so we're looking forward to this game."

Butler coach Barry Collier, meanwhile, thinking Bowen in danger, jumped off the bench and charged at Ellis. The Bull­dog bench followed Collier, and pandemonium ensued.

Yet Butler rose to the occa­
sion. They quashed the rally 
and held on to win by seven 
points. 

Tower, reflecting on the loss, attributed Notre Dame's lack of closure to Butler's tenacity. 
"Butler's got tough kids," said Tower. "Those kids have got a lot of guts. Whenever we'd start making a break and had an opportunity to create our own breaks, a loose ball or something would get away. 
"They just played really hard and didn't let us back in. Any time that there was an opportunity to take, they capi­talized on it."

Volleyball team to finish season in Texas 
Observer Staff Report 

After a disappointing loss to San Francisco last weekend, the Irish women's volleyball team (20-8) will try to rebound with two matches against Texas­Arlington (13-16) Friday and Saturday in its season-ending series. 
Even with two losses, Notre Dame will close the regular season with its best record since 1987. The Irish, with an MCC championship under their belts, have secured a berth in the National Invitational Vol­leyball Championship, held De­cember 5-7 at Wright State Uni­versity. 

Junior Cynthia May skies for a kill against Loyola earlier this season. The Irish volleyball team takes on Texas-Arlington this weekend. 
"They've (Texas-Arlington) traditionally been a very good team," said Irish coach Debbie Brown. "They've been to the NCAA's six years in a row, and made the Final Four two years ago, but they've struggled this year. They have some good players who just haven't put it all together this year." 
With a 19-7 record, the Irish looked like solid contenders for an NCAA berth just six days ago. But a split in last week­end's matches proved to be fa­tal for the Irish run at the NCAA's. 
Notre Dame squandered a big lead, and a chance at an NCAA tournament berth, in giving up a 5-15, 2-15, 15-2, 15-11, 18-16 decision to San Francisco last Saturday. 
With junior co-captain Alicia Turner out with an ankle injury, senior Chris Choquette returned to the starting lineup and led the team with 17 kills against the Lady Dons. 
However, after dominating the first two games, San Francisco came back to sweep the next three games and effectively end Notre Dame's NCAA chances. 
The Irish bounced back on Sunday to defeat Hofstra University in five games. As in the match against the Lady Dons, Notre Dame jumped out to a two-game lead the next night against Hofstra, only to have the match evened at two games apiece. However, unlike the previous night, the Irish put away their opponents in the fifth game, shutting down Hofstra 15-13. 
"There was a pretty natural letdown after losing to San Francisco," said Brown, "and that contributed to the close­ness of the match with Hofstra. But we showed our character against them, hanging in there and winning a tough fifth game." 
Men's volleyball captures MSU tournament title 
By DAN PIER Sports Writer 

If the preseason is a time for a team to judge its potential for the coming year, the Notre Dame men's volleyball club re­ceived a verdict in its favor this weekend. The Irish surprised a 20-team field by taking first place in the Michigan State preseason tournament. 
Notre Dame marched through pool play, defeating Toledo, Cincinnati. and Michigan State's B-team. That placed the Irish in the eight­team championship round, where matches are the best-of­three games. 
They swept Indiana University-Purdue and Ohio State to re«:tch the finals against Michigan. After dropping the 
first game, Notre Dame stormed back to win the last two games and the trophy. The championship was unexpected in the team's first action of the year. 
"We were excited to win the tournament because we didn't expect to do that well," said senior David Bose. "We're really not as far along as we would like to be right now." 
The Irish have until the mid­dle of January to prepare for the first regular season game, and Bose is sure that time will be used well. 
"We have a lot of potential and we can improve so much, so we're really excited about the season," he said. "It looks like Notre Dame is the team to beat in the Midwest...

Just eight days after the meeting between Notre Dame and the Rainbows is the 50th anniversary of the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor. 
"Thanksgiving Day, we'll see a film on Pearl Harbor," noted Holtz. "We're getting all kinds of information on Pearl Harbor and we _have chartered a boat to take us through Pearl Harbor. We'll spend approxi­mately four hours there and we'll talk about it. 
"This is something that's very high on our priority list on go­ing over there. It's the number one thing that we want to do." 
The Hawaii game, which is the first-ever meeting between the Irish and the Rainbows, will be televised on ESPN, with kickoff at 10:30 p.m. EST.
