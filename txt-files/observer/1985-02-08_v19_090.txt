Soviet President President Konstantin Chernenko, who has not been seen in public for nearly seven weeks, addressed the regular meeting ofthe ruling Politburo this week in Moscow, the official news agency Tass said yesterday. Tass did not say when the meeting occurred, but the Tass story was dated yesterday, the day the Politburo normally meets. Chernenko, 73, has not been seen in public since Dec. 27, when television showed him at a Kremlin awards ceremony. Several developments since then have suggested that he was seriously ill. The Soviet press has carried reports of messages from Chernenko and published decrees signed by him, but there had been no reports that he had spoken to Kremlin gatherings before yesterday's Tass report. -AP

Cadet receives unique chance 
By GRETCHEN PICHLER 
StaffReporter 
John Murphy, a senior Army cadet from Crystal Lake, Ill., recently was named one of 30 participants nationwide in the highly selective Army Enrichment Program. 
Murphy said he was "tickled to death" about his acceptance to the program, which enables him to pursue a master's degree at the school of his choice after he is com­missioned as a second lieutenant in May. 
"If you'd asked me a year ago about graduate school, I'd have said 'no,' " said Murphy, "but there was no way I could turn this kind of op­portunity down." 
Murphy, a chemical engineering major, has applied to three ofthe six schools recommended to him by Notre Dame for higher learning in his field. His first choice is Stanford University, his second University of California at Berkeley, and his _third Northwt>"tern University. He hopes to hear from the schools by mid­March. 
Lt. Col. Robert Skinner of the Army ROTC department, said the program was "based on the needs of the Army, and the Army needs en­gineers." 
"Right now there is a big need for technically trained officers," ex­plained Murphy. "(The program) better prepares you, and gives you a chance to further your education and make you more appealing for your career goals." 
Murphy will be working in re­search and development, specifi­cally in the nuclear, biological, and chemical fields. "There is a wide range of things I could be doing. People don't realize the opportuni­ties the Army makes available _to you," he said. 
Although the program has been in existence for several years, Murphy is the first Notre Dame recipient. He was one of 800 ROTC students nationwide to apply to the program in early December, and was notified ofhis acceptance a month later. 
Murphy was chosen on the basis of his grade point average, his recommendations, and his perfor­mance at Advance Camp last sum­mer. He placed 32nd of 1,600 students across the country who at­tended the camp in Fort Riley, Kan. He was the highest-ranking Notre Dame student. 
"A lot ofmy extracurricularactivi­ties were to my advantage," said Murphy, who plays baseball and was social commissioner for Cavanaugh Hall. 
Skinner said Murphy was ac­cepted for his leadership, and his po­tential quality as an officer, backed up by the fact that he did extremely well at Advance Camp last summer. "We are extremely proud ofhim; it's a very meaningful thing," Skinner said. 
After completing his master's, Murphy will spend six years in the Army. He plans to be married in early June, during the 30-day leave period granted him after his com­missioning May 19. 

Commencement speaker discussed 
By MARK DILLON 
StaffReporter 
The name of the commencement speaker for the class of 1985 will be announced by University President Father Theodore Hesburgh on Mon­day or Tuesday. 
At a meeting of the Senior Advi­sory Council held Wednesday at Senior Bar, Council President Dean Christy announced ffesburgh's deci­sion on a commencement speaker 
would  be  made  public  after  the  
Board  of  Trustees  meeting  this  
weekend.  

Christy also announced the coun­cil had submitted three names for honorary degrees. The names of Dr. Denton Cooley, the surgeon who performed the first artificial heart transplant, President Ronald Reagan, and Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca were submitted to Assistant Provost Isabel Charles prior to last semes­ter's finals. 
Although the council would prefer the commencement speaker to be one ofthese three men, Christy recognized that Hesburgh, as Uni­versity president, has the final deci­sion. 
"It is the honor ofthe president of the University to pick the graduation speaker," said Christy. "The Senior Advisory Council's suggestions are strongly considered, but ultimately it is up to Father Hesburgh. 
At the board meeting this weekend, Hesburgh will submit a name for their approval. Following board approval the name will be an­nounced. 
Also discussed at the council meeting were plans for the Senior Formal. The formal will be held the weekend of March 30 at the Palmer House in Chicago. The cost of the weekend, including the bid, rooms at the Pal,mer House and meals is projected to be -approximately SI05. Bids go on sale Wednesday, Feb. 20.

Former ND students to detail Chile on basis of Holy Cross experience 
By SHARON HOUK 
News Staff 
Do you ever wonder where you will be two years after you graduate from Notre Dame? 
Two 1982 graduates of Notre Dame have spent the last two-and-a­halfyears as Holy Cross Associates in Chile. 
joe Regotti and Liz Hellinghausen have returned to Notre Dame to share their experiences of this country Sunday at 7 p.m. in the Cen­ter for Social Concerns. 
Their presentation will include a slide presentation and discussion titled, "Chile: State of Beauty -State ofSeige." 
According to the two associates, Chile is in its 11th year of military dictatorship. There have long been poor in this Latin American country, but the 1980-81 crash ofthe Chilean economy and the subsequent devaluation of the paso has made poverty more poignantly felt among the people. Unemployment is high and government repression is part of daily life, they said. 
The attitude of the government toward the type of work Regotti and Hellinghausen were involved in is at best toleration, they commented. 
Regotti and Hellinghausen lived under the same conditions as the people they were serving. Regotti's community used the same organic self-subsistence farming techniques that they taught the peasant-type farmers, or campesinos. 
Hellinghausen's community lived on the edge of Santiago in a house like the others in the poor urban working-class neighborhoods called poblaciones. 
Regotti thinks it is by this holistic pastoral ministry, an accompani­ment with the poor, that a context of mutual respect is established be­tween Holy Cross Associates and the Chilean people. "You reach people by sharing the life that they live," Regotti said. 
In a reflection on his experience he wrote, "It is only in the context of this true sharing or accompaniment that one enters into 'Ia con.fianza;' a relationship of mutual confidence, trust and respect, with those to whom one is ministering." 
Hellinghausen worked with children in the fifth through ninth grades. She taught at a school in San­tiago where the students rhymed 
boy estudeante, manana cesante, 
which in English means "today a stu­dent, tomorrow unemployed." 
Because of difficult entrance re­quirements and high costs, few have the opportunity to attend college, Hellinghausen said. 
Hellinghausen said she had to be careful of what she said in the class­room, avoiding anything that could be construed as political. 
Regotti spent his first year in Chile teaching. His second year was spent working in the Andes mountains ap­proximately 350 miles from San­

tiago. His community ministered to a rural parish of more than 30 small villages. 
By personally assuming the life and culture of the people of the villages, Regotti said he and his fel­low Holy Cross Associates hoped to empower the people with the tools to help themselves and to develop a Christian sense ofcommunity. 
Hellinghausen says she thinks a community is important because it allows associates to express their commitment to each other as well as to the people ofChile. 
Both Hellinghausen and Regotti think they have been received well by the Chilean people. 
On how they are percieved, Regotti commented, "Our identity is a lot more related to the Catholic Church." 
Hellinghausen says she thinks as­sociates are seen as part of the Church's global missionary work rather than as foreigners orYankees. 
There are currently nine as­sociates in the Chilean program working in various areas.

SMC readies for 1985 Orientation 
By MARY FRAN GISCH 
News Staff 

Although snow is still on the ground and the dog days of August seem far away, the Saint Mary's Ori­entation Committee is taking the first steps in planning to welcome next year's freshmen. 
The chairwoman for the Saint Mary's Orientation Committee, Carol Hastings, recently chose her assistant chairwoman and other committee members. 
"I'm really pleased with the com­mittee I have to work with," said Hastings. "Three ofus worked on or­ientation last year and we know what to expect. We also have a good mix ofgirls from different classes." 
Assistant chairwoman is sopho­more Maura Barille. Other commit­tee members include juniors Mary Doyle and Kim McNamara, both of whom were on the committee last year. 
Sophomore members are Elizabeth Buhr, Megan McMonigle, and Lisa Lawler. Freshmen members include Mary Beth Braun, Kathleen Herbst, and Kathy Bryan. 
Hastings, with Saint Mary's Direc­tor of Student Activities Mary Anne O'Donnell, chose the committee by interviewing applicants. "We were pleased with large turnout of appli­cants we had in order to make our selection," said Hastings. 
As the assistant chairwoman for the 1984 orientation, Hastings was involved in the new approach to ori­entation implemented that year. She said this year's orientation will run much like last year's. 
"Instead of cramming everything orientation should cover into one hectic day, we spread out the events from the original Saturday through the next two days," Hastings said. "This will allow for much more time and events for students. We do plan to have more student leaders for the freshmen groups." 
The big sister/little sister program was replaced last year by student leaders who headed groups offresh­men. "It worked well last year be­cause the freshmen got to know each other better and no one was left out." 
The committee, which has grown from six members to 10, will be ac­cepting applications for orientation student leaders. 
For those interested in becoming student leaders, there will be two meetings the week ofFeb. 18. Atten­dance at one meeting is mandatory. 
Interviews will follow. "We feel interviewing all the applicants is an important process for this selec­tion," said Hastings. 
"Things should go very smoothly this orientation. All the un­foreseeable problems any first-year program has will be worked out." 


Blind activists delay USAir flight , 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -A group of 30 blind activists delayed the departure of a USAir flight yesterday night and then staged a noisy demonstration at National Airport to protest USAir's refusal to seat a blind passenger near one of the jetliner's emergency ex­its. 
The protest was sponsored by the National Federation of the Blind,

which accused USAir ofa civil rights violation for forcing the federation's Indianapolis chapter president off a plane Wednesday at National be­cause he would not vacate his seat adjacent to an emergency exit. 
Airline officials said they were en­forcing a USAir rule, similar to other airlines' rules, prohibiting certain people · including the handicapped, the elderly and young children from seats near emergency exits. 
The chapter president, attorney Russell Anderson, returned to the airport yesterday -accompanied by members of the Baltimore-based federation -and demanded a seat in one of the emergency-exit rows aboard a USAir flight bound for In­dianapolis. 
USAir personnel again refused to seat Anderson near an emergency exit, although they offered any ofthe other seats available on the plane. But Anderson declined an alternate seat.

USAir spokesman Dave Shipley told reporters, "We welcome (Anderson) to board the plane. But it is our policy not to seat handi­capped people near emergency ex­its." 
Anderson and 30 supporters then gathered at the exit gate in an effort to prevent other passengers from boarding the plane. However, USAir officials quietly guided passengers into the plane through nearby gates ­unknown to the blind protesters. 
The 110·seat DC-9 jet departed without Anderson after being delayed by 30 minutes due to the gateside blockade.

Browne also thought a problem existed. "The alcohol policy is one year in, and people are still com­plaining. We want the university to have matching funds (for social events). We also want to have a per­manent shuttle service to malls and restaurants," he said.

Weakland explained what must be done globally and particularly domestically in order to attain even a portion of the proposals the bis­hops raised.

Today we must open churches at night just to prevent people from having to stay outdoors in the cold. The trickle-down theory has worked but not all the boats have risen. 
"We must ask ourselves if our people are culturally prepared for leadership in a world economy," Weakland continued. "What are the responsibilities of economic actors working in some other culture in a foreign country? It will be difficult for these people to alter the course of an economy with interfering in the countries'governments."

"Millions Against MS" schedule 
"wewant our MTV!" 
The plea of the music-video starved college community may soon be satisfied ifa handful ofenthusiastic, hard­
working students have their way. 
Tomorrow afternoon marks the official start of the first annual "Millions against MS" student-organized fundraiser at Notre Dame. The campaign begins with a free-throw competition at halftime of the Syracuse baskethall game and will continue with a giant video party in the ACC arena tomorrow evening. 
The fundraiser, initiated by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and supported by MTV Music Television, is an attempt to raise: money to finance the battle against multiple sclerosis, a debilitating disease ofthe nervous system. 
Notre Dame and 11 other midwestern colleges are competing to raise the largest amount ofper capita contributions before the March 31, 1985 contest deadline. The winner of the fundraising contest will receive a free concert sponsored by MTV. 
This year's 12-school contest is a pilot project for the proposed 1985-86 nationwide MS collegiate fund raiser which will include 150 to 200 colleges and universities. 
"MS is a young person's disease" 

The NMSS was formed to encourage research for a cure of the disease:. 
The society has many fundraisers, but none were aimed specifically at college students. According to Maggie Katz, a campaign district coordinator, "MS people looked at it and said, 'We want to get college students involved.'" 
Katz said the society sponsors a read-a­thon for school-age children and an Ugly Bartender Contest for "the 30-ish crowd". But, she added, there is "a feeling that college students are kids" and that they are consid­ered only for the contributions that they will make in the future. 
"But what about now?" Katz asks, "College students, when motivated, have an incredible capacity for change. This program offers a 
r chance to accomplish great things.'' 
r "MS is a young person's disease," said Katz. 
r It strikes people between the ages of 18 and 
r 34. "It is pertinent to college students-they 
~ arc going to run into people" who have the 
r 
disease. 
"This program says, 'It's a worthy cause,'" Katz continued. "Yes, we want money, but we give you something back, from leadership

Once the decision was made to target college students, the committee chose pilot r schools. Participating in the contest along r 
with Notre Dame are the universities of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Purdue,
~ Northwestern, Ohio State, Michigan State, Marquette, Central Michigan, Drake, and

r 
The schools were chosen on the basis of

r 
their hi!UJ caliber of academics coupled with
r 
competitive athletic teams. The strength of
r 
the athletic competition will insure rivalry 
r 
between the schools. Katz stressed the contest was based on the t size ofcontributions per capita undergradu­r ate enrollment. "We purposely added some 
r variables to gauge and see how this works," she said. 
r 
"Notre Dame is on par with the Big 10. 

r 
There's a friendly rivalry. We're going to use
r 
that," Katz said. "But the only real competi­

_ Not only will MTV broadcast a free concert 
from the winning school, but it is also spon­
soring the Rock-Look-Alike contest, a major 
fundraising event in the drive. 
The Rock-Alike contest, as it is called in 
short, will allow students to impersonate 
their favorite rock personalities on stage. 
The winner and first two runners-up of 
each campus contest will be transported to 
the MTV winners' concert on April27. There 
the campus winner will compete on stage 
against winners from other campuses. 
The grand-prize winner of the Rock-Alike 
contest will receive an internship with MTV 
this summer. 
MTV will also be providing promotional 
material to the campuses, including public 
service announcements. These one-minute 
messages will be used by cable companies in 
communities where the drive takes place. 
The MTV video party tape to be shown at 
the ACC video party is two to three hours 
long, and was produced by MTV solely for 
use in the drive. 
"lhe concert isn't pie in the sky." 
At Notre Dame, MS drive Chairwoman Aline Gioffre has been hard at work on "Millions Against MS" since last fall. 
Gioffre, a senior, is joined by Co-Chairman Vince Willis, a member of the Freshman Advisory Council, who will assume chair­manship offuture MS drives at Notre Dame. 
Gioffre and Willis emphasize that the fundraiser will succeed only with the support of the Notre Dame community. 
"We can set up the events," Gioffre said. "But the only way to win is with the support of the student body." 
Director ofStudent Activitiesjoni Neal, whose office is lending support with adminis­trative details, said the plans included "a collection ofactivities with small donations, a dollar here, a dollar there, to plug in some of the gaps of the social life here.'' 
Neal added, "We have a darn good chance ofwinning the thing. The concert isn't pie in the sky. It is a reality." 
Willis is also optimistic. He said, "When we win-we will win-for sure!"

"Raise money, have fun" Campus MS organizers are planning entertaining events to serve as alternatives to a sometimes dreary social life. MS workers also hope to raise the level ofpublic under­standing ofa disease that strikes people in the prime oflife. The fundraising aspect is important, but Notre Dame organizers wish to avoid the "pass the hat" syndrome they say plagues drives like the United Way. "We aren't for a handout," Willis is 

quick to point out. "People spend money anyway on entertainment. Spend money on our entertainment." 
The kickoff tomorrow is only a harbinger of things to come. 
A halftime free-throw contest is scheduled for the Syracuse game. Anyone attending the game is asked to purchase a S I raffle ticket. Ten winners will be drawn from the raffle, who will compete in the contest. Whoever throws the most successful free throws will win a pair of tickets to the NCAA basketball tournament. 
The video party in the ACC arena will be tomorrow ni t. Tickets, priced at S2, may

be purchased in advance at the dining halls

trip. 
University Food Service will serve refresh­
ments at the party at reduced prices. After 
the party, those with 21 IDs and a ticket stub 
may enjoy quarter beers at Senior Bar. 
In the weeks to come, there will be SAB­sponsored movies, a weeklong bike-a-thon, a skating party for high school students at USA Skates, a phone-a-thon, a Valentine's cookie sale, and several other events culminating with the Rock-Alike contest to be held the last week in March. 
All money raised will go toward the Notre 
Dame contribution in the "Millions Against 
MS" drive. 
Saint Mary's will run a concurrent fundrais­ing drive, and will contribute all proceeds to the Notre Dame campaign. Although Saint Mary's students are not counted in the per capita enrollment at Notre Dame, they will be entitled to any of the privileges ofa Notre Dame win. 
Publicity Director Nancy Domzalski says, "This is our best year to win. We are only competing with 11 schools and since we're smaller than most of them our chances are better to win. Our alumni and South Bend community contacts are strong." 
The "Millions Against MS" fundraiser is perhaps the most ambitious project under­taken by Notre Dame students this year. 
Gioffre said fundraising events need not be limited to entertainment activities and encourages inter-dorm competitions to raise money. 
"We have the support ofcampus groups and the administartion. With such backing, it is the duty of the student body to show we're worthy ofsuch support," she said. 
In Willis' words, "This is a campaign for the students, by the students with the support of the University. It is a chance to improve social life and at the same time help find a cure for MS." 
Students interested in working on the fundraiser should contact Aline Gioffre at 283-2179.

Lipton tournament 

Lendl and Navratilova stay alive 
Associated Press 

DELRAY BEACH, Fla. -The No. 1 seed~, Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia and Martina Navratilova, continued on the express tracks yesterday, while Kim Shaefer derailed the wo­men's fourth seed, Manuela Maleeva, in the second round of the $1.8 mil­lion Lipton International Players Championships tennis tournament. 
Lend! was forced into a first-set tiebreaker before he eliminated John Sadri, 7-6, 6-0, on the windy, sun-swept stadium court, while Nav­ratilova ripped off the first nine games enroute to a 6-0, 6-3 victory over Robin White. 
Shaefer, a 27-year-old right­hander who posted her biggest career victory in 1983 when she won the U.S. women's Indoors, ousted the 17-year-old Bulgarian, one of the upcoming stars in wo­men's tennis, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4. 
Maleeva, who upset Chris Evert Lloyd to capture the 1984 Italian Open and also took the U.S. Clay Courts and Swiss Open titles last year, followed her younger sister, Katerina, out of this inaugural two­week event. Katerina Maleeva, 1 5, lost in the first round. 
In other night matches, No. 6 Johan Kriek downed India's Vijay Amritraj 6-4, 6-0; No. 9 Yannick Noah ofFrance defeated Terry Moor 6-2, 6-4 and No. 13 Stefan Edberg of Sweden eliminated Poland's Wojtek Fibak 6-2, 6-0. 
Besides Navratilova and Lend!, other seeds posting second-round victories in day matches were No. 4 Anders Jarryd and No. 8 Joakim Nystrom, both of Sweden; No. 7 Hana Mandlikova ofCzechoslovakia, No. 10 Carling Bassett of Canada, No. 11 Bonnie Gadusek, No. 14 Pam Casale and No. 1 5 Catarina Lindqvist ofSweden.

Meet tomorrow 

Patterson leads indoor track team 
By NICK SCHRANTZ 
Sports Writer 

Coming off a convincing win in 
the Midwestern City Conference 
Meet, the Notre Dame indoor track 
team travels to Bloomington, Ind., 
today for the Indiana Intercollegiate 
Meet. 

The Irish will compete against a competitive field, which includes perenial powerhouse Indiana Uni­versity. However, co-captain James Patterson remains unworried about the high caliber of the competition. 
"We are a well-balanced team, and ifwe come together and don't worry about the other teams, then we have a good chance to win," Patterson ex­plained. "Indiana is a good team, and we've had some bad breaks this year, but overall I think we will do well." 
Impressive performances turned in by Patterson thus far this year con­tributed strongly to the Irish success in their conference meet and gives them confidence heading into today's meet. 
The senior has won both the triple jump and long jump in all three meets in which he has competed this year. His bests include a 24-9 long jump in the Western Michigan Open, which broke his old Notre Dame record by an inch, and a leap of forty-eight feet, six and three­fourths inches in the triple jump against Iowa, which is the third-best indoor triple jump in Notre Dame history. 
Patterson's talents do not lie only in the triple jump and long jump. So far this year, he also has competed in the high jump and 60-yard high hurdles. Furthermore, in the three previous years he also has entered the 60-yard dash, l 00-yard dash, l l 0-yard high hurdles, and 4x I 00­yard relay. All this makes Patterson 


t ~ 
i 
James Patterson 
one of the most versatile performers in Notre Dame history. 
Patterson not only competes in a multitude of events, but he usually wins them. He recorded the best marks on the team last year both in­doors and outdoors in the long jump, triple jump and high jump. 
'Ilte University City, Mo., native holds the school record for the in­door long jump ( 24-9 ), outdoor long jump ( 25-2) and outdoor triple jump (fifty feet, two and one-half inches). He also ranks second on the all-time Notre Dame list for the in­door triple jump, and ninth and tenth for the outdoor and indoor high jump, respectively. 
Despite his versatility, Patterson will concentrate on the long jump and triple jump this year. He pro­vided many valuable points last year in the high jump, but the return of high jumper Lloyd Constable allows him to focus on his two specialties. 
Patterson's duties to the team have increased even more this year, due to his being elected co-captain. However, he has adapted to his new role and its added responsibilities with the same success as he dis­played on the track. 
"He's an excellent captain, and doing a very good job," said Irish head coach Joe Plane. "He's not the 

~ 
type of captain who is out there leading cheers all the time. Instead, he leads by example because he is a 
t real competitor and a hell of a worker." 
Patterson said he has felt his role 
on the team change with the addi­
tion ofhis new responsibilities. 
"Before, I had more or less a role 
of not leadership, but something 
more supportive. I would just try to 
do my best and get some points for 
the team," Patterson related. "Now, I 
still have the responsibility to do my 
best and score points, but I have to 
set an example instead ofjust being a 
supporter." 

Patterson had a successful high school career at University City High School. He even long jumped over 23 feet as a senior. Despite his ability, the adjustment to college wasn't easy. 
When Patterson entered Notre Dame, all track performers were re­quired to run a two-mile test in un­der 12 minutes. He had trouble with the test, which held him back so he only competed in the long jump. The test troubled him at the start of his sophomore year, but the rule was dropped in time for him to get in shape and compete outdoors. 
Patterson remained at Notre Dame in the summer following his sophomore year to go to school and work on technique. This extra effort paid off, and he finally was able to realize his full potential during his junior year. 

Rafael Addison, a 6-7 forward for Syracuse, will be trying to improve his team-leading averages of 19.8 points and 6.2 reboundspergame tomorrow against the Irish. For a preview ofthe game, see the backpage. 

"College was a big change for me, 
and it took me two years to adjust. 
There were a lot oftrials and tribula­
tions, but I made it through all 
right," he explained. "The two-mile 
test was bothersome, but I finally got 
it off my chest and then things fell 
through for me." 

Patterson will graduate this spring 
with a combined degree in Govern­
ment and ALPA. He plans to attend 
MBA school, preferably in the South 
so he can train for track all year. 
His ultimate goal in track is the 1988 Olympics. Two major prob­lems he anticipates will be finding a sponsor to pay for expenses and competing against the world's best. However, Patterson won't let those problems hold him back. 
"IfI do better this year maybe the sponsors will come and help pay for expenses and MBA school," he said. "I feel ifyou strivefor something and work hard for it, then you can achieve it ifyou really want to." 
Patterson has set his sights high for the remaining part of the year and after graduation. However, he has never been one to place limita­tions on himself. With that kind of attitude, the Notre Dame track team appears to have a fine leader with high hopes for a successful perfor­mance today and the rest ofthe year.

The Notre Dame men's fencing team will put its unscathed 10-0 record on the line tomorrow when it takes on five fencing squads in a tournament at Oakland University in Michigan. 
The Irish will open the tourna­ment tomorrow morning at 9:30 when they take on Michigan Dear­born, a team with relatively little tal­ent. Next, the Irish take on a talented Detroit squad and another from their host, Oakland. Notre Dame rounds out the tourney by fencing Chicago and Ohio State. 
Notre Dame should, if past form holds true, come out of the tourna­ment with five victories and no defeats. The team will, however,face some tough competition, particu­larly from Ohio State and Detroit. 
Notre Dame coach Mike DeCicco said he looks forward to tomorrow's action. 
"We should win all of our bouts and come back 5-0," DeCicco said. "It will be an interesting weekend of fencing." 
DeCicco said he expects the toug­hest competition from OSU and Detroit.

and one particularly good foilist," he said. "Ohio State is very strong in epee and foil with Sunil Sabharwal leading the way." 
Sabharwal, in only his sophomore year, already is an all-American with impressive credentials, but he will have to go against the 1984 national champion in the foil, Notre Dame's Charles Higgs-Coulthard ( 16-1 ). He also will face Irish captain Mike Van der Velden with a record of 16-5. 
Detroit will bring a team of respectable talent into the tourna­ment, most of the talent being found in its sabre team. Notre Dame's su­perior depth however, should be able to dispose of Detroit without much difficulty. 
Chicago brings a good, talented team into the tournament yet DeCicco said he sees them placing no higher than third. 
Oakland University, the host of the tournament, brings a very young team into the tourney. DeCicco ex plained that this weekend's action is being held at Oakland to help the fencing program there. 
"The tournament is being held a Oakland mainly because Notre Dame, as well as the other schools, is trying to help the Oakland fencing program get established, this effort is similar to what other schools did for us some 25 years ago. 
"Oakland has two very good, young, talented fencers. That is al ways an impetus for a good pro gram." 
This weekend's tournament at Oakland will feature some talented teams. However, Notre Dame should be able to take advantage of its superior team balance and come away with five victories. 

Former Notre Dame player Laimbeer makes All-Stars 
Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS · Center Bill Lrumbeer of the DetrOit Pistons was named yesterday to replace injured Jeff Ruland of the Washington Bullets on the East squad for Sunday's 35th National Basketball Asso­ciation All-Star game. 
Ruland, suffering from a strained right shoulder, has missed 12 of the Bullets' last 13 games. 
Laimbeer, a former Notre Dame player, also was a replacement for the East Stars last year when Moses Malone of Philadelphia missed the game with an injury. The Pistons' center had 13 points and five rebounds in 17 minutes a year ago as the East defeated the West 154-145 in overtime.

Irish hockey team faces Iowa to end rough week 

By ED DOMANSKY 
!>ports Writer 

After surviving 26 hours of a 
round-trip bus ride to Huntsville, 
Ala., five days in that iced-in city and 
a tie and a loss to Alabama­

Huntsville, the Notre Dame hockey 
team finally returned home at 2 a.m. 
last Tuesday morning. 
Weary and somewhat dismayed by the turn ofevents between Friday night's hard-fought, come-from­behind tie ( 7-7) and Saturday's crushing defeat ( 9-4 ), it was difficult to find anyone in the traveling party who wanted to do anything but get off the bus, let alone begin thinking about this weekend's opponent, Iowa State. 
After missing Monday's workout, the Irish had a light practice on Tuesday, and finally returned to a full practice on Wednesday. 
"Our extended stay put us a day off schedule, but our goals are still quite obvious," said head coach Lefty Smith. "It sounds redundant to keep saying it, but we still need to put together three solid periods." 
If the Irish could have combined the third and overtime periods from Friday's tie along with Saturday's first period, they would have come away with a 7-3 victory. 
Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. And just the same, if the first two periods from Friday and the final two periods of Saturday's con­test would have been added to­gether -it would have found the Irish on the short end of an I 1-4 tally. 
"We need to work for that consis-

tency," added Smith. "The kids showed a lot of character coming back after trailing the whole game on Friday. But Saturday, when things started going against us, we lost everything." 
Tonight and tomorrow, Notre Dame (6-I 5-1 ) will entertain the Cyclones from Iowa State in 7:30 
p.m. contests both nights at the ACC 
When the Irish last played at the ACC, they ended an eight-game losing streak by defeating Lake For­est, 6-4, onJan. 23. 
In the most recent encounter be­tween Notre Dame and Iowa State, the Cyclones defeated the Irish, 4-2, last March 3 at the ACC to win the Central States Collegiate Hockey League playoff title. Notre Dame had taken both games ofa regular-season weekend series in late January in Ames, Iowa. The Irish skated away with 4-3 and 6-4 wins. 
Iowa State will arrive at Notre Dame with an I8-8-I record. Against a common opponent, the Cyclones defeated Huntsville, 4-3, and then were demolished by the Chargers, I2-4, two weeks ago in Huntsville. 
Already, the Cyclones have im­proved last season's IO-I2 record. "With the way things have been 
going,  Iowa  State  will  be  a  for­ 
midable  challenge  for  us,"  said  
Smith.  

"We think that last year's playoff victory was a fluke," said junior for­ward Steve Whitmore. "And that's what we're out to prove." 
The Irish still are not sure who will start in the games this weekend. Senior co-captain Brent Chapman continues to lead the Irish in scoring 



deal off the bench. 
Joining Keys, Schueth and Botham in the starting lineup will be fresh­man point guard Mary Gavin and for­ward Lynn Ebben. DiStanislao has been pleased with the performance of this group, which has been very effective in recent wins over Butler ( 79-40). Evansville ( 7 4-5 3) and Dayton.

Still on a roll 

Women face Xavier tomorrow 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame women's basket­
ball team is on a roll right now, 
something which is bad news for 
North Star Conference opponent 
Xavier. The Lady Musketeers, strug­
gling along at 2-16 ( 0-6 in confer­
ence play), must try to slow down 
the Irish, winners of six of their last 
seven, when they visit the ACC to­
morrow for a game which begins at 
noon. 
It will not be an easy task for Xavier, which finds itself stuck in last place in the conference. Notre Dame has hit its stride at exactly the right moment, at least as far as the conference race is concerned, and finds itself in a tie for first place after handing Dayton its first North Star loss of the season on Tuesday. 
"We're making our game better," says Irish coach Mary DiStanisiao, whose team now has won five home games in a row. "We'r-e improving on the things we need to do to win. More importantly, we're learning how to win. 
"We're at a point in the confer­ence season, though, where we have to do what we do well every time we play. I have no doubt that the kids are fired up after the Dayton win (81-66 at UD). We did a lot ofthings well and need to look to Improve on that. But we're too smart to think we can look past anybody." 
It would be easy to look past the Musketeers, who, as their record in­dicates, have been having serious problems In their second year in the North Star. After finishing 10-16 last year (3-7 in the NSC), Coach Laurie Massa's squad has found its upgraded schedule more than It can handle. 
If there is one thing that has hurt Xavier this year, It has been defense. The Musketeers have given up al­most 90 points per game, an in­credibly high total, and have allowed opponents to make almost 50 percent of their shots. With the Musketeer offense averaging 66 points on 39-percent shooting, it Is no surprise that Xavier Is losing games by large margins. 
Not all is bad for the Musketeers, though, as a few individual players have been able to supply some bright spots in 1984-85. Forward Stacy Land has been the brightest performer by far as she has led the Xavier offense with her 20.8 points per game. The 6-0 senior leads the conference with that figure and also holds a spot among the NSC rebounding leaders with her 7.4 average. 
"Land is real strong and uses her strength well," says DiStanislao. "She's not particularly quick, but she can power to the basket and has a good touch on her turnaround." 
Land gets some help on offense from 5-7 guard Shannon Sowers. The sophomore has supplied most of the outside scoring for the Musketeers and is the only other player besides Land who is averaging in double fig­ures ( 11.0 ppg). 
Until last week, Land and Sowers were about the extent ofXavier's of­fense, but that changed when fresh­man center Terry Coughman introduced herself in a 100-74 loss to Dayton. In that game, she scored 19 points and pulled down 13 rebounds, while picking up four as­sists, two blocks and three steals. Her emergence can only be good news for Massa. 
Although the Musketeers do not appear to be a serious threat, DiS­tanislao is not about to look past them to next week's tough op­ponent, Alabama. 
"We're not in the position where we can afford to look past anybody," says the fifth-year coach. "I expect a good solid performance from every­one -and I mean everyone. If we're going to win the conference, we're going to have to win it one game at a time." 
There is little doubt that Irish for­ward Trena Keys will be the main force as Notre Dame tries to im­prove on its 11-7 ( 4-1 ) record. The 6-0 junior has been impressive in recent weeks, scoring in double fig­ures in ten straight games and im­proving her team-leading scoring average to 17.2 points a game. If Keys hits double figures against Xavier's porous defense, she will set 


Irish hope to upset Syracuse and keep victory streak alive 
By MARC RAMIREZ 
Sports Writer 
What's amazing is that Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim had said that this year's team would be "good," while next year's team would be "great." Well, if this 15-4 team is only "good," one just has to wonder what Boeheim meant by "great." 
Avery good Syracuse team, led by sophomore guard Dwayne "The Pearl" Washington," invades the ACC tomorrow determined to retain its Top-1 0 status following a 67-66 loss to Boston College last Monday. 
The Irish are 13-5 and enjoying a four-game winning streak. 
"Coming off the UCLA and LaSalle wins and playing a team that is as good as Syracuse," said Notre Dame head coach Digger Phelps, "the timing is right for Notre Dame. 
"The overtime loss to St. John's, their loss to Villanova, their loss the other night to Boston College, they don't really mean that much. If anything, it makes them a better tournament team. 
"Come March, it's obvious Syracuse will be in the NCAA tourna­ment."

Still something to prove 
Tournament time is quickly approaching and the Notre Dame basketball team has to count every game as an important one from now on. Last Sun­day's win at UCLA was a big one, as any win over the Bruins is, but it should not be forgotten that UCLA is only a 9-9 team. And the fact is, Notre Dame won't find too many .500 teams in the NCAA tournament. 
It's a pretty safe bet that the Irish will be able to win enough games over the remainder ofthe season to get into the tournament, but they won't last more than a round or two ifthey don't start beating team's like tomorrow's opponent, Syracuse, very soon. 
Notre Dame has played very well at times this season. The UCLA win, as well as wins over Indiana, Marquette, and Dayton all were important in their own way. Yet the fact still remains that the Irish have yet to beat an opponent which has consistently been in the Top Twenty. I know it, you know it, and Dig­ger Phelps and his players know it. 
One ofthe team's goals all season long has been to become a ranked team. But every time the chance to beat someone big and possibly get ranked has pre­sented itself, Notre Dame has come up short. It has happened twice with DePaul and it happened a couple ofweekends ago with Maryland. 
Now the same chance presents itself again when the sixth-ranked Orangemen come to the ACC. How the Irish will respond is anyone's guess. Being that the season is just beginning to wind down, Notre Dame can't afford to wait much longer to pull off the real big upset it has been shootingfor all season long. 
The Irish have been playing very well oflate. Wed­nesday's win over LaSalle was most impressive. The letdown which some expected to occur against the Explorers never did happen. So now Notre Dame heads into tomorrow's contest very ready, both mentally and physically. 
Personnel-wise this team is really starting to come together. Ken Barlow, Donald Royal and Jim Dolan up front, with Kempton first off the bench, has proven to be perhaps the most effective combina­tion of the season. Add the much-improved play of 

A victory against the Orangemen would certainly be a boost ofadded confidence for the Irish, but boosts of confidence don't typically come easily. Syracuse is no exception. 
"You're talking about one of the top four or five teams in the country as far as the consistency of having personnel, as well as a system that can play against anyone, whether it's at home or on the road," said Phelps. "They just have the bench and the depth. 
"Jim Boeheim has always had a team that plays well. They're not complicated. They just want you to shoot from the outside. So we're going to have to shoot well from the outside, but I also feel we can get inside and do some things there."

Washington is starting at guard for the Orangemen following a year in which he became the first freshman ever to make the all-Big East first team, as well as being named the league's Rookie of the Year. "The Pearl" is averaging 14.9 points a game, and so far has dished out I 13 assists, more than twice the number of his nearest teammate, 6-2 sopho­more Greg Monroe, who has 54. Washington is best remembered for his flashy 27 points and six assists in Syracuse's 82-71 overtime loss to Georgetown in last year's Big East tournament final.

Joseph Price in the backcourt to the creative ability of David Rivers and it is easy to see why the Irish are starting to take off like they did last year before Kempton went out with his stress fracture about this point in the season. 
The key -now is to beat a big-name team like Syracuse on national television. Such a feat certainly won't be easy. The Orangemen are a multi-talented team. Just stopping an explosive player like Pearl Washington won't be enough to win. Any one of about five other guys have the capability to hurt Notre Dame. 
The Irish do have other games like the Syracuse one left. There's Duke next weekend at the Meadowlands, Washington here, and the season finale against Dayton at UD Arena, which is always a tough place to play. But ·Notre Dame has to start beating nationally-ranked teams sometime if it hopes to do anything in post-season play, and tomor­row is just as good a time as any to do so. 
Student support, which Phelps has said is the best he's seen in years, will be important in the effort to knock off the Orangemen. Notre Dame can't afford to lose control of the game or to have any extended lapses, two problems it has had in big games earlier this season. To do their part, the student body can't allow the Irish to fall into either of these previous pitfalls. 
Still, the team itself has a job to do. The Irish need to maintain the same level of play they have shown in the last two games, and then take it one step beyond. If they can do that, a win is certainly a possi­bility. 
In many ways, though, that "if' is a big one. This team still has something to prove to its fans. 


out, "we're in trouble if the Pearl 
comes in here and scores 35. If he 
dominates the game like that, we're 
going to have problems, because the 
other players are that good. 

"Yet, I don't think we can just worry about him. If he gets his 18 shot.~. we have to hope he makes six. But you just don't stop The Pearl. He's just too good." 
lbe Pearl, however, is not the leading scorer for the Orangemen. Syracuse is powered by 6-7 junior Rafael Addison, a quick. sharp­shooting forward who can turn it on at any time. Addison is scoring at a 
18.2 pace for the Orangemen after a sophomore year in which he started every game and averaged 17.7 points. 
"Addison is so explosive," said Phelps. "He's got a quick release and he's an excellent outside shooter. He's like a third guard." 
The Orangemen also start 6-1 0 freshman Rony Seikaly, an import from Greece, at center. Seikaly is hit­ting more than 56 percent of his shots from the field. averaging 7.3 points while collecting a team­leading 6. 5 rebounds per game. 
"Seikaly is the most improved player on the team," commented Phelps. "He's playing with a lot of confidence right now and he's playing with a lot of good people, which has made him a better player." 
Joining Addison at the other for­ward position is 6-8 senior Andre Hawkins, a silent, 240-pound force who quietly totals seven points and five boards a game. Complementing Washington at the other guard spot is 6-4 sophomore Michael Brown, a talented offensive player who is shooting at a 54-percent dip for the Orangemen.
