Mother preaches tolerance

.Judy Shepard doesn't expect her work end anytime soon, although the gay rights activist wishes she were out of a job. 
"I know that good things are going to happen," Shepard told a rapt Notre Dame audience Thursday, "and they're going to happen soon. And I'll be out of work, but that's a good thing," she said. 
Shepard, whose son, Matthew, died in a highly pub­licized October 1998 anti-gay hate crime, spoke before a capacity crowd of about 200 students, faculty, staff and South Bend residents. 
The University's Standing Committee on Gay and Lesbian Student Needs sponsored the talk to promote campus unity with homosexual and bisexual members of the Notre Dame community. 
Shepard on Thursday deliv­ered an emotional speech that inspired tears as readily as it did laughs from the Hesburgh Library Auditorium gathering. 
As Shepard read from a vic­tim-impact statement she gave during sentencing of one of her son's killers, many students sobbed openly and wiped tears from their faces. 
'Tl! never understand why anyone would want to hurt Matt," she read from the April 1999 statement. "Such an act of cruelty is incomprehensi­ble." 
Matthew Shepard died after two men beat, robbed and left him tied to a fence in the Wyoming prarie. 
Each man is now serving two life sentences in prison. 
Shepard said she didn't hold the men ultimately responsible for her 21-year-old son's death. 
"I blame society for what happened to Matt," she said.

Student to appear on College Jeopardy

Edward's senior said. "I met Regis here and told him I was going to be on JEOP­ARDY! He didn't think that was funny." 
Nerlinger registered for College JEOPARDY! when he was playing the online game during the summer. He was randomly chosen as one of 1,500 college students picked to try out for the special November series. In August, Nerlinger traveled to Baltimore to take a 50 question test and participate in a mock run of the show. 
"It was cool just to pass the test," he said. 
Nerlinger's experience with the game show, however, didn't end in Baltimore.

Security/Police arrests fugutive in Roseland Park 
By MIKE CONNOLLY 
News Writer 
Notre Dame Security/Police recaptured a suspect behind the Signature Inn in Roseland Park after he J1ed from police custody at UniVfirsity Village. 
Police said the man was charged with possession of stolen property and resisting arrest by flight. _ ­
According to Chuck Hurley, assistant direcl.or of NDSPD, Security originally responded to a complaint from a woman in University Village that the sus­pect was attempting to break into her apartment. Security officers responding to the call detained a man matching the description of the suspect on Saint Mary's Road. 
The man was taken into cus­tody by Security an<! brought to University Village. The victim identified the su·spect as the man who was attempting to break into her apartment. 
Whlle Security officers attempted to handcuff the man, he escaped, ran across U.S. 933 and fled behind Denny's Restaurant. Security, along with St. Joseph County Police and Roseland Police, recap­tured the suspect when he was hiding in the bushes in Roseland Park. 
When Security searched the suspect, officers discovered 

items from a wallet that had befln rnported stolen from Galvin life Science Center on Monday. 
Security will invc_stigate his possible involvement in other campus larcenies. 
"He's been here and passed through some campus build­ings," Hurley said. "So we are going to be looking into his pos­sible involvement in other crimes." 
Hurley said there have been no other recent robberies reported at University Village, but there have b-een recent thefts fr.om other campus build­
ings. 

The case has been forwarded to the prosecutor's office who will investigate the incident and may choose to press charges against the suspect for attempt­ed breaking and entering.

INSIDE COLUMN THIS WEEK IN NOTRE DAME/SAINT MARY'S HISTORY 
Happily never after 
We're told early on, by way of once-upon-a­time fairy tales and Disney movies, that the key to success is finding someone with whom you can share your life. Finding true love will break the spell, slay the dragon and cue the "happily ever after" ending credits 
every time. 
As we grow older, howev­er, we're told to forget the fairy tale, that sharing can wait and it's better to focus on yourself and have a good time toasting your own suc­cesses. This small contra­diction of life's instructions 

prompts the question: Jacqueline Better to be single or com­Browder mitted? 
It's the double cliche of 
Scene Copy

walking a fine line with a double-edged sword. We Editor want it both ways. 
According to any coffee table magazine (Cosmopolitan, Maxim, take your pick), being single is synonymous with being fabulous. With this solo mentality screaming at us from glossy pages filled with toned models and tips on how to "meet 'em and wow 'em,'' what's not to love? It's all rather enticing. Suddenly, a relationship seems to have the appeal of entering a dragon's lair with neither weapon nor trusty sidekick. It's just not something that you want to do. 
It's the same with television. Tuning into any of the must-see TV shows, leading the single life looks pretty good. Who wouldn't want to be hanging out in the city, drinking coffee and engaging in witty banter? 
However, if you look a little closer, the mes­sage is unclear. These magazines and televi: sion shows may tell you that this mind-blowing single life is where it's at. but the majority of the articles and plot lines dedicate themselves to finding, getting and keeping a relationship. Suddenly, the coin flips (thus the double edged sword mentioned above). 
What do we want? Two very differing views of how we should be living our young lives are thrust at us on a daily basis, and we're told to choose the right path. 
There's certainly something to be said (or maybe it was something said once upon a time) about sharing your time and self with another person. Yet, we're still told that this is the time of our lives, our best years and as good as it's going to get. Why not live it up? Date around. Meet people. Don't tie ourselves down. So, we don't. We become single. 
Yes, the single life. We're young, we're free and ... we're stil!,looking. If it's the thrill of the chase that does it for you, then you're set. Set, that is, until you run out of breath. Sudden.ly, rather than living this glamorous high life found on the pages of Glamour and in Aaron Spelling dramas, you're alone. But isn't that what you wanted in the first place? 
If we don't know what we want, can there possibly be a happy ending? Or at least a happy medium? We can't have it both ways, but eventually we get to live our personal fairy tale, even if it's fractured one. 
And no matter how much they'd like to, mass media can't dictate the individual decisions we make. Sure, they can draw that fine line. sharpen the sword and tell you that single life is fabulous. However, they'll never tell you that single is happily ever after.

PRINCETON UNIVERSITY 

Report gauges impact of aid policy 
PRINCETON, N.J. 
During an annual report presentation to the faculty on the status of undergraduate admissions last week, Dean of the College Nancy Malkiel said last week that Princeton University's change in financial aid policy last January greatly affected the composition of the Class of 2005. Malkiel noted that 46 percent of the freshman class is receiving financial aid -the highest percentage of all the Ivy League schools and a signifi­cant jump from the 40 percent of the Class of 2004 receiving financial aid. Malkiel also said there was an increase in the racial diversity of the freshman class. The percentage of minority students in the Class of 2005 is 28.9 percent compared to 26.3 percent of the Class of 2004. According to President Tilghman, how­ever, it is too soon to conclude what the full impact of the University's financial aid policy change will be on "the spectrum of students who apply to Princeton and those who [are accepted]."

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
Plan to increase diversity postponed 
LOS ANGELES 

Plans to institute a program designed to increase the number of minority students in the University of California have been put on hold until next year due to lack of funds. The university has postponed the dual admissions plan, citing the state legislature's failure to provide the UC's request for $2.5 million before it went into recess last week. "The legislative clock ran out on us at a time when the state is facing some very bleak budget choices," said Michael Reese, assistant vice president of strategic communications for the UC Office 
-of the President. Because the state legislature is in recess, the UC cannot pursue funding for the program until it reconvenes in January. According to the dual admissions plan, students in the top 4 to 12.5 percent of their high school class would be guaranteed UC admission, provided they complete two years at a com­munity college. It would have taken effect for the class of fall 2003 and transfer students in 2005.

PUTTING ON A HIT 

Special to the Observer 
Choro na Feira, a Brazilian music group from Rio de Janeiro, will visit the University this weekend for performances on campus and in South Bend and Chicago. Sponsored by the Brazilian Ministry of Culture, the group will be hosted by Notre Dame's Kellogg Institute for International Studies. 
The eight members of Charo na Feira will perform tonight at 7 p.m. at the Hesburgh Center for International Studies. The concert is free and open to the public. 
Additional appearances by the group will include workshops and performances at South Bend area schools throughout the week and an informal con­cert Sept. 29 at 10 a.m. at the South Bend Farmer's Market, followed by a performance at Chicago's Rooster Blues Club that evening. 
Charo na Feira came together after the group performed at a Saturday street market in a Rio de Janeiro neighborhood. Members include university pro­fessors, recording artists and studio musicians.

The mayor also said 4,620 names have been registered as missing at a city center for victims· relatives. The cor­rect number -the one many fear will be the true death toll -is likely somewhere between the two, Giuliani said.

Democrat Mark Green and Republican Michael Bloomberg agreed to go along with Giuliani's propos­al, which would postpone the new mayor's inauguration until April. The mayor is sup­posed to leave office Dec. 31 under a city term limits law. 
Across the rest of the city, some commuters faced their first day of mandatory car­pooling. Noncommercial pas­senger vehicles with only the driver inside were turned back during the morning rush hour, causing some traffic delays. The restric­tions were imposed as a way of clearing traffic jams in Manhattan caused by the attack and heightened secu­rity. 
Higher traffic volume was expected Friday, following the Jewish holiday of Yorn Kippur.

That is in addition to the two-year budget the legisla­ture approved this spring that spent nearly $600 million more than projected.

Officials to meet with Taliban 
Associated Press 
ISLAMABAD 
Pakistani religious lead­ers leave Friday for Afghanistan, the Pakistani news agency reported. The delegation may be part of a new Pakistani initiative to open a dia­1ogu e with the ruling Taliban on a possible solution to the crisis over Osama bin Laden. 
The Pakistan govern­ment news agency said 

Thursday the delegation would fly aboard a special plane to the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, stronghold of the Taliban leadership, and return Friday night. 
Although the dispatch did not say so, it appeared the delegation had the Pakistan govern­ment's approval because a special plane was being provided and because the visit was reported in advance by the state news agency. 
The visit was announced as the Taliban's ambassador to Islamabad, Abdul Salam Zaeef, said a Sept. 20 decision by Afghan clerics urging bin Laden to leave Afghanistan voluntarily had been delivered to the alleged terrorist master­
mind. 
Bin Laden is the top suspect in the Sept. 11 terrorist bombings in the United States, and Bush has demanded that the Taliban hand over him 
and his lieutenants, among other demands, or face retaliation. 
The Taliban had said they couldn't find bin Laden. But Zaeef's remarks indicated the Taliban knew where he was and were in contact with him. It also appeared than bin Laden was still in Afghanistan. 
The moves could signal a willingness by the Taliban to find a solution to the crisis and avoid American air strikes.

NYC mayor may seek term extension 
As.ociued Press 
NEW YORK 

Rudolph Giuliani got the sup­port of two of the three may­oral candidates Thursday for a plan that would allow him to stay on at City Hall for an extra three months while he guides the city through the aftermath of the World Trade Center attack. 
But Bronx Borough President 
Fernando Ferrer, one of two 
Democrats still in the race, 
declined to support the idea, 
saying he was worried about 
the precedent it would set. 
Democrat :½ark Green and 
Republican Michael Bloomberg 
agreed to go along with a pro­
posal after meeting privately 
with Giuliani. 
Green spokesman Joe 
DeP!asco said Thursday the 
Democrat would support legis­

three months "given the 
unprecedented World Trade 
Center catastrophe, the urgent 
need for a seamless transition 
and the importance of a united

Ferrer said in an interview on the local cable news chan­nel NY1 that he would name Giuliani to head up an entity to oversee reconstruction and rebuilding efforts.

justify such a nonpartisan, nontraditional approach to encourage unity and planning," DePlasco explained. 
In front of the news cameras Giuliani has remained focused on the massive recovery effort in downtown Manhattan. 
But behind the scenes, the mayor and his aides have been engaged in a furious lobbying effort to keep the term-limited Giuliani in City Hall after his term expires -all in the name of political unity, according to more than a dozen government officials, business leaders and other people close to Guiliani. 

Details about how Giuliani's proposal would work are still unclear. It would likely need approval from the state Legislature as some type of emergency measure. 
''We would certainly be inclined to support an exten­sion if that's what we would be asked to do to provide for an orderly transition," said John McArdle, a spokesman for GOP state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno. 
On Wednesday, the mayor placed a call to Democratic state Assembly Speaker Sheld_on Silver asking for his support. Silver has been cool to the idea, but pledged to bring up the issue with his members. 
In Albany, Republican Gov. 
George Pataki said it was pre­
m ature to say whether he 
would sign legislation to extend 
the mayor's term, "but obvi­
ously I would be supportive of 
any such effort." 
Questions have been raised 
about the legality of the pro­
posal. Democratic U.S. Rep. 
Charles Rangel, a Ferrer 
backer who represents Harlem, 
said the plan would need 
Justice Department approval 
because it would affect minori­
ty voters, who are protected 
under the Voting Rights Act.

Plane returns 
to airport 
after threat 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES 

A passenger allegedly uttered an anti-American threat during a confrontation with flight attendants Thursday, prompt­ing an airliner to return to Los Angeles und.er escort by Air Force jet fighters. 
The unidentified man and his travel companion on Air Canada Flight 792 to Toronto were handed over to the FBI, said Nicole Couture-Simard, spokeswoman for Air Canada in Montreal. 
"Shortly after departure a male passenger was appre­hended smoking in the lavato­ry," she said. "The passenger became verbally abusive and 
· uttered an anti-American threat." Couture-Simard would not describe the threat. FBI spokeswoman Laura Bosley could not immediately give details on the passenger. The Boeing 767 landed safely about half an hour after takeoff, authorities said. Couture-Simard said it was not necessary to restrain the passenger: "The pilot elected to return to Los Angeles as a pre­cautionary measure only." There were 145 people on the plane, including a crew of seven, an airport spokeswoman said. The jet returned to the air­port around 1:15 p.m. and pas­sengers were booked on the next flight. 
Two F-16s escorted the Air Canada flight into the airport, authorities said. Who contacted the jets was not immediately clear. but Air Force jets normal­ly respond to civilian incidents only at the request of the Federal Aviation Admini-stra­tion, said Maj. Barry Venable, spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command. 
The incident occurred as Gov. Gray Davis was traveling to_ an airport press conference on a shuttle bus. 
"We were about five minutes out of Lot C when those two jets buzzed the airport, so we knew something was up," said Davis.

RUSSIA 
Chechen envoys suggest disarmament 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW 

Chechen rebel envoys have contacted Russian officials about possible disarmament talks, a Kremlin envoy said Thursday, in the first step toward peace negotiations in two years of war. 
The tentative overture was announced just before President Vladimir Putin's 72­hour offer of talks -his first such serious proposal ­expired. Putin had repeatedly rejected Western calls for a political settlement, insisting the rebels should be eliminat­ed. 
Kremlin envoy Viktor Kazantsev, appointed by Putin to oversee negotiations, said a representative of rebel leader A'llan Maskhadov approached his delegation in Chechnya. He provided no details. 
"We have just barely start­ed," Kazantsev said on RTH television Thursday from a plane to Moscow. 'Tm not say­ing they're ready; they have doubts." 
Kazantsev, who has been shuttling around Chechnya and nearby southern Russian republics since Putin's offer Monday, claimed that several dozen rebel commanders and fighters had "contacted" pro­Moscow Chechen officials. He did not elaborate. 
"Discussions are under way. 
There will be a result, I am certain," he later told ORT tele\ision in Moscow. 
His deputy, Nikolai Britvin, said in a telephone interview from the Chechen capital, Grozny. that a small number of rebels had already surren­dered, but did not say how many. 
"The process has started and it will continue tomorrow and for some time," Britvin said. 
There was no immediate response from the rebels. 
Formidable obstacles remain to any peace settlement. The Russian military is desperate to avoid a repeat of its humili­ating troop withdrawal at the end of the 1994-96 war in Chechnya, which resulted in de facto independence. 
The Kremlin also wants to maintain a strong presence in the region and avoid the law­lessness that blossomed after the 1996 withdrawal -the main reason cited for sending troops back into Chechnya in 1999. 
That invasion came after Chechnya-based rebels invad­ed the neighboring region of Dagestan, and after deadly apartment bombings in Russia blamed on the rebels. 
Maskhadov. a rebel com­mander during the 1994-96 war, played a key role in nego­tiating a peace deal and has repeatedly proposed negotia­tions in this war.

The gunman wasn't identified and there was no report of injury in the shooting. The vio­lence came after 33 officers were hurt in confrontations at the same spot Wednesday night.

WASHINGTON 

Governors pledged Thursday to mobilize National Guard troops against terrorism at air­ports, where jobs are drying up because of 
.travelers' jitters. The Pentagon said it has authority to attack hijacked airliners as a last resort. 
Talkjng about military pilots' new rules of engagement in the war against terrorism, outgoing Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Henry Shelton said, "The last thing in the world that one of them wants to do is engage a commercial aircraft." 
"Don't get the impression that anyone who's flying around out there has a loose trigger finger," he said. 
Sixteen days after attacks that killed thousands, the Bush administration moved on several fronts to calm a still-fearful nation, bolster the U.S. economy, identify the kHlers and forge a wartime coalition of disparate nations. 
"Others will tire and weary; I understand that. But not our nation," Bush told hundreds of flag-waving airline workers in Chicago, their industry and jobs in danger because of the Sept. 11 attacks. 


Amid a swirl of diplomatic activity, Bush met with European Union leaders, who cautioned him to retaliate with precision and focus. The president, by con­trast, has talked about a broad war. 
Despite words of caution from Europe. there was fresh evi­dence that Bush is fashioning a unique anti-terrorism coalition of disparate nations. A U.S. offi­cial disclosed that Sudan, long accused of harboring terrorists, has quietly rounded up as many as 30 foreign extremists since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Secretary of State Colin Powell was busy, too. He met with the foreign ministers of Belgium and Turkey as well as King Abdullah II ofJordan. 
Adding his voice to the mix, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said he had been invited by the ruling militia in Afghanistan to take a "peace delegation" to the region. The White House dis­couraged Jackson, and the Taliban militia said they had not asked him to come. 
Powell said point-blank: "We have nothing to negotiate." 
In Afghanistan, where prime suspect Osama bin Laden is believed to be, Taliban leaders warned Afghans not to expect the United States to overthrow their hard-line rule.

Several mayors said the pack­age wasn't tough enough. Some governors moved quickly to hoed Bush's call to mobilize National Guard troops at airports. 
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a former member of the Navy special forces team, said he didn't think twice. Colleagues in Michigan, California and several others states followed suit. Rhode Island's governor said the Guard wasn't needed -not yet, anyway.. 
"When you're in a time of war, you don't question the comman­der in chief," said Ventura. 
Bush dispatched his Cabinet to travel on various commercial flights to demonstrate the safety of the skies. Even his father, for­mer President George H.W. Bush, pitched in. 
"I have every confidence in the airlines," the elder Bush said before boarding a flight in Boston with several Secret Service agents. 
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Americans may see "some dramatic military engagements," but warned in a New York Times article that vic­tory won't be easy nor clear and the war will be unconventional. 
"Forget about 'exit strategies,"' he wrote. "We're looking at a sustained engagement that car­ries no deadlines."

PITTSBUllGI I the responsibility of every minister who takes the
curb hypocrisy 
"I really believe that the pagans, and the abor­Bible seriously." 
There have been a number of letters and even an Inside Column published this week that relate back to the Michigan State game and, more at the center of con­troversy, what happened following it. As a recent alum, I'm siding with the students on this one. The question of class and loyalty should not be directed at the students but at their predecessors. 
First of all, there was booing at post-game. Can't deny it, it happened. Lt. Dan Cook called the booing a break in tradition. Tim O'Connor made an excellent point in his response that the booing was simply a way of showing the growing frustration that many Domers, past and pre­sent, are feeling right now with the program. 
Angela Campos's inside Column called for more sup­port in the senior section and asked them to act more like their underclassmen peers. And I agree. Cheer. Do those push-ups. Yell your part of "We Are ND"when the cheerleaders cue you. Be as into the game as the cheer­leaders and the band are, who, no matter lhe odds, will cheer like we're up 24-3 even if it we're not. 
But to the students who left before the band, who crossed their arms during the 1812, who even booed, I cannot blame you. You were just following another example, not one from your peers, but one from your elders. After the game, the students are the only section that doesn't clear out and head for dinner reservations, more tailgating or to the bookstore to beat the rush. Or whatever the reasons are that alums leave. So can you blame the seniors for following in their footsteps? 
The next time an alum calls for tradition and then accuses the students of being classless, or forgetting who they are, or even where they are, remind the alums that they were once students too. That they had tradition. Ask them why they leave now, why they don't stand any­more and why they set such a bad example. 
To those alums like me who want to stand, who yell the cheers, who stay to the end and still act like students -thanks. If only the rest of the alumni would follow our example.

I point the finger in their face and say, 'You helped this hap­pen," Rev. Jerry Falwell said. 

Osama bin Laden and The Pitt News Saddam Hussein have found an ideological friend in Jerry Falwell. The above, delivered by Falwell during the Sept. 13 broadcast of' the Christian television program "The 700 Club," is lhe type of statement that is more often associated with Middle Eastern dictators than with Christian television. 
Later in the same show, Falwell further blurred the lines betwetln his belief's and that of the Sept. 11 attackers by saying that, because of the previously mentioned groups, God had allowed "the enemies of America to give us proba­bly what we deserve." 
This is the type of offensive drivel that gives self-righteous, hate-mongering loud­mouths a bad name. It's hardly surprising that Falwell had the audacity and taste­lessness to say such things just two days after the attack. 
This is, after all, the same man who during the course of his career tried to "out" Tinkie­Winkie, the purple Teletubby, and announced that the Antichrist was living among us in the form of a Jewish man. 

Though unsurprising, Falwell's latest comments are more than just another embarrass­ing incident from the former leader of the now-defunct Moral Majority. They sig­nal that Falwell, like bin Laden, believes that there is currently a jihad (holy war} being fought and that God is on his side. 
Nor is this the first time that Falwell's rhetoric has echoed bin Laden's. Bin Laden began his holy war by issuing a fatwa (religious edict) which said, "To kill the Americans and their allies -civilians and military -is an individual duty for every Muslim." 
Falwell has issued a similar proclamation, say­ing, "Preaching against the sin of homosexuality is 
Bin Laden is fighting America, the so-called Great Satan. Falwell is fighting homosexuality, what he has called a "vile and satanic system." 
Bin Laden fights with bombs. Falwell fights with words. 
Bin Laden wants to remove the American pres­ence from the Middle East. Falwtlll wants to remove Tinkie-Winkie from television. 
They are two cheeks ol' the same metaphorical ass, and to extend this already crude metaphor fur­ther, they both stink. . 
Though an agent or hatred just as surely as bin Laden is, Falwell is no threat to the freedom of Americans. No military action will be needed to stop him. No economic sanctions will be needed to 
silence him. By fighting for hatred and narrow­mindedness in an ever more pro­gressive and educated society, Falwell has made himself' vul­nerable to the only force thal can take him down: irrele­vance. 
With every embarrass­ing diatribe, Falwell finds himself with fewer and 
fewer allies. The former 
leader of the Moral Majority is now a lia­bility to the Christian 
Right, and few people in Washington are willing to have their names associated with his. 
As the bold Ku Klux Klan members of the past eventually slunk 
into the shadows, so will Jerry Falwell. As the once-proudly flown 
Confederate flag became an ugly reminder of past hatreds, so too will Jerry Falwell. 

But for now, Falwell, who pointed his finger in the face of pagans, feminists. gays, les­
bians, victims of the attacks and the country as a whole, should know just one thing. We are pointing a 
finger right back in your direction, and there are far more of us than there ever were of you.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Apologies to Coach Davie 
.,.,-Fairness requires that I write this follow-up to my letter (published in Wednesday's Observer) calling for Coach Davie's resignation because our team and coaches were not on the field during the pre-game ceremonies. In my letter I stated that Coach DaVf~could offer no "valid explanation" for such absent.e. Since my letter was published I have received a copy of a letter written by Tex Dutile, Chairman of the Faculty Board of Athletics, which explains that the Notre Dame and Michigan State Athletic Departments had agreed prior to the game that neither team would he on the field during the cere­monies. While I continue to feel that it would have been 
more appropriate for both teams to have been involved in the pre-game ceremonies, keeping to the agreed upon approach is certainly a "valid explanation" for Coach Davie's actions and I apolo­gize to Coach Davie for writing first and getting the facts later. The Notre Dame community, which of course includes Coach Davie and the players and coaches, can be proud of its response to the tragic events of Sept. 11th.

Through his decision, White only showed reverence for the blue and gold. 
The claim that the Irish stayed in the locker room to maintain a sense of nor­malcy is utter nonsense. Eleven days after the deaths of' 6,000 countrymen, no one could remain unaffected. Michigan State stood up and faced the reality of' America. Notre Dame stayed behind and ignored it. 
Sadly, the attention given this confu­sion has dwarfed the real story. Enough fans to fill a small city waved flags and belted out "God Bless America," More than a quarter of a million dollars was raised for the victims. For that, Notre Dame deserves to be cheered. 
Bush still has much to prove 
Notre Dame freshmen and fresh­women (let's be politically correct, especially since this president claims to include everyone in his administration) have much in common with George W. Bush. Both have begun a new life unlike anything · they could have expected. They are still naive, well­intentioned, unfa­miliar with their new surroundings and somewhat immature. Yet they both have tremen­dous potential, and will undoubtedly have the opportu­nity to prove them­selves in time, 
My first fresh­man day on Notre Dame's campus was a nightmare. I walked past Morrissey through the arch at Howard and head­ed toward the Golden Dome. Somehow I ended up near the library and was hopelessly lost. Returning to the dome, I found myself near Lewis Hall and could not figure out that the old Bookstore was located on the other side of the Main Building. I quickly learned how to tell north from south depending on how Mary was standing above the golden dome. · 
Bush's last few weeks in office have been as traumatic. He campaigned on such issues as the immediate increase of funding for the military and less gov­ernment in general. It was supposed to mean an influx of spending so the mili­tary could replace much needed parts for its equipment and the acquisition of new equipment. It meant a reduction of taxes and an end to government intru­sion into the business lives of Americans, favorite topics of the con­servative far right. 
Ideally those tasks should be, for most Americans, supported without question. However, prior to the World Trade Center attacks, his defense sec-


retary was attempting, with much 
opposition from the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, to reduce much of the military 
personnel in favor of better technology. 
At that point in time not a penny of new 
military program spending, other than 
the missile shield proposal, was includ­
ed in Bush's budget. 
Just as I learned how to guide myself 
on campus by using Mary's stance on 
the Dome, Bush has learned how to -maneuver around the corridors of the 
Pentagon on the military issue. He also 
learned how to relate with the White 
House press corps, which delight in 
their bulldog roles. More recently he 
steered his tax reduction win in both 
chambers of Congress. Bush was han­
dling his honeymoon period with suc­
cess. 

Like· any university setting, the Bush 
Administration had settled down to its 
first few months of freshman classroom 
learning. Football season opened for 
Bush when the World Trade Center was 
attacked. He won that game in the pub­
lic opinion polls, but the season is 
young. Despite his tendency to promise 
too much by promising to eradicate all 
terrorist activities, look for Bush to beat 
the odds makers' lines on most issues 
for another year due to the public's 
inherent lust for revenge. 
Bush has been presented with cir­
cumstances like no other president in 
our history. Thus far his staff has 
steered him in the proper direction 
with our nation's response. While the 
public has given him the typical support 
during a time of crisis it will not formu­
late a permanent impression of him 
until election day of 2004. 
Bush is operating within a completely 
new and uncharted set of circum­
stances. He has opportunities unseen 
since Franklin Roosevelt's administra­
tion. He also has pitfalls before him 
unprecedented throughout history. 
Patience is not a virtue the American 
public holds for long during political 
crisis. Our declared war sets the perfect 
tone for our resolve for justice but our 
unseen enemy will be difficult for the public to follow. 
The public is willing to blame any 
economic decline for the next several 
months on the attack, but slimmer 
pocketbooks will eventually mean 
impatience as well. 
The Bush advisors need to temper the 
rhetoric so that expectations can focus 
at their true level of attainment. The 
John Wayne approach of bringing the 
outlaw to justice, getting the girl and 
riding off into the sunset is not the 
approach and will not work in this situ­
ation. Yet the president keeps raising 
expectations beyond the public's atten­
tion span. 
All of us would like to see Osama bin 
Laden captured and terrorism eradicat­
ed by the end of the year. Three more 
years is long enough to make the presi­
dent's true presence felt in our econo­
my, in our military and throughout the 
world. 

However, this freshman president 
cannot undo the terrorist network over 
night that took tens of years to create. 
By this president's senior year in his 
term, he must have attained substantial 
results or the American public will have · become impatient. 
My concern is that Bush avoid the 
typically exaggerated pitfalls of every 
freshman -parties and tailgaters. 
After all, I remember being told that 
during the Navy weekend of my fresh­
man year I was found in my under­
wear, one shoe on, one shoe off, stomp­
ing in a circle trying to walk off a tail­
gater success. Some rhetorical and 
behavioral moderation by every fresh­
man is the key to success.

Whatever style crust one selects, the buttery, melt­in-your-mouth, perfectly . textured dough cannot be topped -except with the per­fect amounts of sauce and cheese used by the masters at Pizza Hut. The sauce complements the crust, allowing the flavors of each to min­gle well. The sauce does not domi­nate the pizza or make the crust soggy. There is just enough sauce to create the perfect median between the crust and the cheese. Too often, pizzas lack sufficient amounts of cheese. Pizza Hut places a fairly thick layer of flavorful cheese on each pizza it prepares. Toppings aren't prone to slide off the pizza as the cheese holds them firmly in place. The pepperoni test­ed for this review was neither too salty nor too spicy as some pepper­onis tend to be. Overall, from cr~st to toppings, Pizza Hut delivers the best pizza.

Bruno's pie is the Natty Light of pizza. While it doesn't score particularly badly in any one area, it is entirely forgettable. Bruno's thrives on ambivalence. It does not taste good, but it does not taste bad either. You will e'at it and feel strangely unsatisfied.

MEN'S INTERHALL FOOTBALL BLUE LEAGUE 
O'Neill hungry for more wins 
By KEVIN BOYLE and MATT DeNICOLA 
Sports Writers 
What was it like for O'Neill Hall never having won before? 
"It just made us that much more hungry," team captain John Enterline said. 
O'Neill had a breakthrough win last week with a 14-7 vic­tory over St. Ed's, but their hunger was not satisfied. O'Neill hopes to follow up last week's monumental win in their upcoming match-up with Fisher Hall. 
"We're looking to build upon last week," Enterline said. "We're not going to stop after one win, we want to get some­thing going and get into the playoffs. Every game is a big game." 
Fisher is also coming off of a big win, last week they defeat­ed Knott 24-8. The offense was productive against a tradition­ally stingy defense while the Wave's own defense forced four turnovers. 
The Wave, however, is not cocky or complacent. They won't overlook the Angry Mob

-
despite its lackluster football tradition. 
"With new freshmen coming in any team could be a con­tender, you have to be ready every week," Fisher captain Ray Aftandilians said. 
Last week both teams' defen­sive line did a good job of putting pressure on the quar­terback. 
"Our linebackers came up big last week, and our defensive line did a great job of applying pressure," Aftandilians said. 
"We need to continue to do our best to have everyone go all out on defense until the whistle stops; that's what you have to do to win. Offense will help us out but defense is what will get us to the stadium." 
On the offensive end, the Angry Mob stuck mqstly to the ground while the Wave main­tained a more balanced attack. Fisher was not as offensively dominant as the score would indicate. they got lucky and had one tipped ball that was caught for a touchdown. Thev need to and are focused on improving their execution against O'Neill. 
"The catch got us through. but we want to make prepara­tion work rather than luck this week,'' Aftandilians said. 
O'NeUl is looking to add a few new wrinkles this week to the offense that only passed three times last Sunday. They appear to have the weapons to do so, with quarterback Troy Montgomery connecting to wide receiver Kyle Johnson twice for touchdowns last game. If only they kept Interhall quarterback ratings. 
Neither team is backing down this week, Fisher's main con­cern will still probably be stop­ping the O'Neill ground game while the Angry Mob needs to shut down Wave tailback Kameron Chappel and an effec­tive aerial assault. 
Stanford vs. Morrissey 
It has often been said that the best offense is a good defense. As true as this may seem, the fact remains that you cannot win football games without scoring touchdowns. 

Ask Stanford or Morrissey, neither of whom scored a touchdown in their season opener. But when these two teams face off this Sunday, nei­ther team wants that to happen again. 
"We've been focusing on defense and trying to improve the pass attack," said Stanford captain Dave Dilworth. The Griffins allowed only one touch­down last week, and hope that the defense can step up in a similar fashion this weekend. 
Stanford's defense may not need much work, but the offense struggled in their open­er. Dilworth is confidenfthat his offense can come alive. 
"Our running game is our strength: running the ball. con­trolling the ball, and not giving it to the other team," Dilworth said. 
Dilworth's confidence in the run is not unfounded, consider­ing the two man back attack of Dan Campion and Mark McNamee, who each had seven carries in the last game. 
"Our backfield is really strong ... they can always come up with a big play," said Dilworth. 
But Morrissey is not fright­ened by the Griffin backfield. 
"I think we are strong enough to beat any team," said Morrissey captain Andy Baum. "If we need to make adjust­ments during the game, then we will." 
The Manorites also allowed only one touchdown last Sunday, and expect to hold Stanford to a minimum number of points as well. 
"We just prepared like we normally do," said Baum. "Last game both the offense and defense played well." 
Obviously the Manorites are confident in their offense. Even if they played well last week, they will have to put points on the board to win. Behind quar­terback Rick Ysasi (5 of 11 passing) and running back Edward Hernandez, Morrisey has a formidable offensive drive each time they get the ball. 
Considering the similarities of these teams, this game could very well go down to the wire. Last season, Stanford was able to beat Morrisey for a spot in the playoffs. , 
"We were lighting to get in, they were fighting to get in ... it was a pretty intense battle,'' said Dilworth. 
A battle is exactly what to expect. Both teams have a game under their belt. and used this game experience to fix any problems. And both teams expect win. 
"This game is important because it will be our first win," said Baum. "It is real important to get that first win and get rolling." 
The Griffins are just as confi­dent. 
"We still want to go 3-1," said Dilworth. "On a scale of 1 to 10, this game is a 10. We have to win out the rest of the sea­son." 
Both teams may have improved on their last perfor­mances. However, only one will win.

Spores Writer 
The Relles cross country team is ready to run. 
For the past three meets, the team has had a great opportuni­ty to see whore they stand and get to know each other's strengths and weaknesses. They arc working together and ready to step forth and run through the finish line. 
"We are starting to improve and unite as a team," said junior Jennie Buehler. 
This Saturday at the Lakefront Invitational at Loyola University, Jackie Bauters is the runner to watch. So far, Bautcrs, a sopho­more, has proven to be the strength of the team. She has been one of the BeJles' top six runners in all three meets they have run in this year. 
Her best time so far was 20 minutes, 43 seconds at the Aquinas College Invitational, the first meet of tqe season. She placed in the top 17 overall in all of the team's five-kilometer races. Bauters is hoping to enhance her time and place in the top five for this upcoming race. 
The meet will be at 10 a.m. on Saturday.

Dutch sweep Belles 

By MATT MOONEY Sports Writer 
Thursday was not a good day for the Saint Mary's vol­leyball team. 
The bad news started when senior captain Angela Meyers' MRI revealed a torn ACL. Having lost their captain for the season, the Belles trav­eled to Holland, Michigan to face the conference leading Flying Dutch of Hope College. 
The situation did not improve as-Hope dispatched Saint Mary's in three straight games, 30-17, 30.. 25, 30-26. . The Belles find themselves in a slump. Having lost their last four matches, the team needs a victory of any kind. 
As though things weren't bad enough, her absenc~ makes an already young team oven more inexperienced. Losing Meyers depletes the senior count to three. 
In place of Meyers, Saint Mary's had to look elsewhere to replace her. Alison Shevik led the team in that category with 13 total digs while Jolie LeBeau posted 10 kills and six blocks.

Blue-Gold game to raise cash_for charity 
By MATT ORENCHUK 
Spom Writer 
This Sunday when the Notre Dame hockey team suits up for its charity Blue­Gold game, it will hit close to home. That is because the game is to raise money for the Coaches Foundation for cancer research. What makes it unique is that every player has ded.icated the game to a person he knows with cancer. 
Team captain Evan Nielsen is playing for Doug Wickenheiser. 
"My dad played profession­al hockey, and one of his teari1mates was Doug," said 
"[The Blue-Gold game] is

will be the raiser started Irish captain first time 
five years ago with the Notre Dame hockey Run for Cancer. That event lasted for three years. Last fall, the fund­raiser was switched to a hockey scrimmage. 
The idea for a cancer fund­raiser came from Ma.ine hockey coach Shawn Walsh. Walsh was diagnosed with cancer, and then preceded to help set up the Coaches Foundation. Last year the 
Blue-Gold game raised $3,500 for the foundation. 
Unfortunately a somber mood will be felt on Sunday, since Walsh passed away this week from his cancer. 
"It was really shocking to hear about his death since all the news we heard indicated he was doing fine," said assistant coach Andy Slaggert. 
"I was shocked by [Walsh's] death," said Nielsen. "He was a well respected coach, and it is a big loss for college hock­ey." 
For the game the squad will split up into two teams, Blue and Gold. Assignments to the teams was random, to

consist of two 21-minute periods. The te_am is excited to be back on the ice trying to forget last year's disas­trous campaign. 
"It [the Blue-Gold game] is a great thing to have." Nielsen said. "We just started this week, and it is nice to have a big kickoff for the sea­son." 
The Irish have a scrimmage against the University of Toronto next weekend in the JACC. The season starts against Union College on Thursday Oct. 11th. 
The Blue-Gold game action starts Sunday afternoon at 4 
p.m. Admission is free, but fans are asked to make a donation at the door.

The No. 24 Notre Dame women's volleyball team will face two crucial Big East opponents this week­end. The lrish start off against Virginia Tech tonight at 7 p.m. and finish with a contest against Georgetown on Sunday at 2p.m. 
Tonight's match will be the first ever between Notre Dame and Virginia Tech. Unable to rely on past meetings, the Irish have been doing their homework by studying tapes and team statistics. At 3-7 and 0-2 in the Big East, Virginia Tech is the underdog, but the Irish consider their game with the Hokies to be an important Big East match­up. 
"It doesn't matter what they're bringing," coach Debbie Brown said. "It mat­ters what we're doing on our side of the net." 
In Notre Dame's last match against Syracuse, the Irish had 10 aces and five service errors. Coach Brown hopes to continue to hit efficiently with a hitting percentage of .300 while holding the opponent to a .110 hitting perc-entage. 
In their 11 matches with 
Georgetown, the Irish lead the Boyas 10-1. The Hoyas should not be underesti­rn ated, however. Last year's match was close with the Irish edging out on top 3-2. 
"They've proved to have a stronger team each year we've played them," Senior captain Marcie Bomhack said, "We treat them as top contenders in the Big East." 
The Hoyas are also enjoy­ing a winning streak of their own. The team has won its last three games to bolster their season record to 5-4 and has a notable record of 2-0 in the Big East. Voted by the 13 Big East coaches to finish a strong fifth in the confer­ence, Georgetown could be a formidable opponent for Notre Dame. 
Leading the young Hoya team is Yulia Vtyurina who was selected as the Big East Player of the Week last week. The Irish are sure to heighten their intensity for this Big East competitor. 
The Hoya victory over the Irish three years ago, "sparked a rivalry," Bomhack said. "We don't ever want that to happen again." 
Notre Dame has a season record of 5-3 and is 1-0 in the Big East. After losing close battles with No. 1 
Nebraska, No. 15 
Pepperdine and No. 7 UCLA 
earlier in September, the 
team defeated Valparaiso 
and Syracuse to build its 
current two-game winning 
streak. 
With renewed focus and a 
surge of momentum, the 
Irish look to maintain their 
dominating presence in the 
Big East, having not lost a -Big East match since 1998. 
Notre Dame has a win­
ning mindset because the 
team takes each opponent 
one match at a time. 
Heading into a match. the 
Irish aim to win in 3 games. 
In addition, part of Notre 
Dame's strategy includes 
continually setting goals for 
themselves for each compe­
tition. The main objective 
for the Irish is to score 
points on the serve. 
The team would also like 
to improve their overall sta­
tistics such as hitting per­
cent blocks. Senior Malinda 
Goralski continues to be an 
important asset for the 
Irish. Leading the team 
with an average of over 
three kills per game, 
Goralski will be on offensive 
power while her ability to 
dominate the net will keep 
the Irish in control of the 
game.

SMC SOCCER 
Red-hot Belles win third straight 
By KATRINA KALASKY 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's didn't play like a team of freshman Thursday. 
When SMC took the field against Indiana Tech, the_ team was play-. ing against a squad that had only played teams of freshmen. Indiana Tech never stood a chance against the Belles, who slapped them with a 5-0 victory_ for their third consecutive season victory. 
"Since the scrimmage [again~t Indiana Tech earlier this season] the girls have matured as players and established a composed style of play," said head coach Bobby Johnston. 
After a 0-5 star.t to the season, the young Belles team is finally moving in the right direction. 
They dominated the whole game, beginning with the three goals they scored in the first half. Two were scored by freshman Shannon Artnak and one was scored by freshman Jen Concannon, who has been an instrumental playl:lr with four goals and five assists in the past week. 
"We came together as a team," Concannon said. "We were pass­ing well and we're getting the job done." 
During the second half, Saint Mary's freshmen continued to 
dominate play. Freshman Molly McCavitt scored twice, once on a penalty and again on a corner kick. There was no contest on offense. Saint Mary's had 37 shots on goal while Indiana Tech could only manage 5. 
At the halfway point in their season, most of the players con­tribute their recent winning streak to having more experience working as a team. 
"We know how to play together as a team now," McCavitt said. 
With three wins under their belts. the Belles continue their MIAA season against number one ranked Albion College on Sunday. 
Despite the fact that his young team is taking on a conference powerhouse, Johnston plans to keep everything just as it is. 
''We've been playing well so we will keep the same style," he said. 
The Belles winning streak has increased their confidence and they are ready to take on solid competition. 
"It should be a good game.," said captain Lynn Taylor. "We're coming in with a lot of good momentum and a lot of confi­dence." 
The game gets under way at 10 

a.m. on the Saint Mary's soccer fields. ­

ND WOMEN'S GOLF ND CROSS COUNTRY 
New coach brings -new approach 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Spores Writer 
Every Tuesday and Thursday morning at 5:30 a.m., Shannon Byrne and her team­mates crawl out of their beds and head to the weight room to begin the day's circuit training. 
This is a new era in Notre Dame women's golf. 
After just three victories last season and unorganized prac­tices, the Jrish, under the direction of their first full­time coach, are ready to focus their efforts on making a name for the team. This weekend, they start with their first intercollegiate tourna­ment. 
"I have a five year plan to get us into the top 2 5 [in the nation's women's golf' rank­ings!," said new coach Debbie King. 
King has led the University of Memphis women's golf pro­gram to the NCAA tournament four out of the past five sea­sons. 
Their quest begins Saturday at the Warren Golf Course, where the Irish are looking to defend their Notre Dame Invitational title. The competi­tion this year is supposed to be tougher than before. Under the leadership of King, the team has stepped up its work­outs and they feel they are ready to win. 
The Irish have not played since the Notre Dame Women's Golf Campus Championship Sept. 7 and 8. 
"We're itching to get going," said Byrne. 
In the past, the golfers usu­ally had to practice on their own, as there was not much structure with a part-time 
coach. King's full-time pres­ence has completely altered the team's routines, with the weight and cardio workouts two mornings a week as well as more strudured practices in general. 
"The additional structure has caused us to focus," said Byrne. "We're all on the same page now, and we know exact­ly what's expected of us." 
King believes one of the major keys to improving the team's stature is getting the players to believe in them­selves. 
"I like to work my players from the inside out," she said. 
King, showing her dedication to the Irish, summed up her reason for coming to Notre Dame in one sentence. 
"I felt my chances of winning a national championship would be better [at Notre Dame]," she said. 
There are not just one or two leaders of the Irish. "Everyone will have their time to contribute, and everyone's going to be needed," said Byrne. 
In addition to veterans Rebecca Rogers, Kristin McMurtie, Jeanne Murphy, Taibl, and Byrne, the team will also look to freshmen Karen Lotta and Casey Rotella. 
The members of the Irish women's golf team realize that changes are coming to their program, and are looking for­ward to the prospects pro­posed to them by King. 
"Things are going up for us. We all feel like we're a part of something," Byrne said. "That's exciting. It's a chal­lenge."

Irish race to weekend meets 
By KATIE HUGHES 
Spom Writer 

The men's cross country team will head to Kalamazoo, Mich. this Saturday for the Central Collegigate Championships without their top runners. All-Americans Hyan Shay and Luke Watson, who combined with sophomore Todd Mobley to take the first three spots in last weekend's National Catholic Invitational will not run. Seniors Pat Conway and Marc Striowski, or sophomores David Alber and Brian Kerwin will also take the weekend off l'rom competi­tion. 
After last week's first place finish at the National Catholic Invitational, the team moved up to No. 4 in the national rankings. 
Juniors Kevin Avenius, John Keane, Kevin Brown and Nathan Shay, sopho­more Kevin Somok, senior Tom Lennon, freshmen Ryan Johnson and Eric Morrison. and fifth year senior Sean Zanderson will run for Notre Dame this Saturday. 
"1 have no idea how they're going to finish," said head coach Joe Piane. "And if you were to ask them they would say the same thing." 
Though next week's Notre Dame lnvitational will be their first opportu­nity for the team to be tested against other nationally ranked competi­
tion, this meet will provide a good chance for the mid­dle of the pack runners to possibly move into varsity competition. 
"It's not quite as big of a meet. but it's a crucial meet for those that are on the bubble"' said Avcnius. "That's why we're running the group we are." 
Western Michigan and Ohio University should be the closest competition for Notre Dame. Though the runners will be different from the full strength Irish lineup, the same pack strategy that fueled last weekend's individual and team success will prevail in Saturday's race. Notre Dame took the first, sec­ond, third, fifth, eighth, 11th and 16th spots in last weekend's meet. 
"On any given day, there are 10 guys competing for the number four, five, and six spots," said Avenius. "It's going to be tough for the coach to make that call, but you have to go week to week." 
"It's a good problem to have,'' said Piane. 
The women will also hold out their top seven runners from last week's National Catholic Championships, where they took second out of the 26 team field. 
Junior Jen Handley, who took first place in the meet, as well as freshman Lauren King, sophomore Megan Johnson, who was third at the National Catholic Championships, 
and freshman Christi Arnerich, will rest this weekend. Junior Susan Creary, sophomores Rachel Endress and Megan Peterson. senior Hilary Burn, and freshman Katie Wales will be among those competing Saturday. 
"We want to give those kids an opportunity to compete in a race that's a team situation," said head coach Tim Connelly. "We can use this meet as a gauge to see where we are." 
Ohio University, Wisconsin, and Detroit Mercy should be the teams closest to Notre Dame. 
"We're going to make a consciou·s effort to work together," said Endress. 
"Everyone, no matter what level. We have to work on pack running and motivating each other." 
As the team continues to grow this season they have combined experience with new talent. They will also continue to develop their pack running strategy. 
"It helps being able to go out where you're supposed to and stay with front run­ners at start," said Creary. 
"The group is very tal­ented, and we are confi­dent about our ability to compete," said Endress. "A Jot of the people, espe-_ cially Susie Creary and Megan Peterson have improved vastly since last year." ·

1934 marks beginning of a revolution 
. Jackson Park Tournament marks first competition for Saint Mary's 
By NOREEN GILLESPIE 
Sports Wri rer 
When Anne Pikosovits and Frances Fuller were playing field hockey at Saini Mary's, they had no idea they were creating a revolution. 
They simply wanted to have fun with their friends. So in the fall of 1934, 12 women came together to form a field hockey team, marking the first time there was any organized athletic team at the College. 
"We just wanted· to have fun, to get out of the classroom," said Pikosovits, who will accept the 1934 Field Hockey Team's Hall of Fame induction at Angela Athletic Facility Saturday. ''We wanted to do something besides study all the time ... that's how we got together." 
Under the di.rection of Isabel Kane, a physi­cal culture instructor at the College, the stu­dents met for practice and scrimmaged after class. For most of them, it was the first time they had been exposed to the sport. 
While Pikosovits remembers impromptu vol­leyball games held in ·the gymnasium, and the College handbook states students took daily walks down the tree-lined avenue for "fulfill­ment of daily exercise," women's athletics were unheard of in the 1930s. 
The team soon made a name for itself both within Saint Mary's community and the region when they were invited to play in Jackson Park's Play Day in Chicago, a regional tourna­ment for teams from local colleges. The South Bend Tribune reported on the event, writing that the College sponsored a spaghetti dinner, a "rousing" pep rally and sold hockey patches to fund the team's trip. 
For the team who had never played against anyone but themselves, it was the opportunity of a lifetime. 
"We were so young, so inexperienced ... we hadn't played anyone else," Pikosovits said. "We had never left the campus for a game before." 
The team was scheduled for three 15­minute games on Saturday, Nov. 10, 1934, and walked away tying University of Chicago, 0-0. They lost one game to Battle Creek College 2­0, and won by default to Lake Forest College, who did not appear for its game. 
One year later and with one year's more experience, the team returned to the Jackson Park tournament on Nov. 9, 1935, and notched a victory against Northern IIllinois State Teachers College. They tied North Junior College 0-0, and lost to Northwestern University. 
Within the next five years, a basketball, equestrian, tennis, canoeing, volleyball, track and field, archery, golf, badminton and hiking teams were established. Within the next 50 years, the College would field eight teams for varsity competition and join the NCAA as a full-fledged member. 
But tell that to Pikosovits and Fuller now, and they'll humbly tell you they just did it to have fun. 
"I think this is a very novel idea," Fuller said. "It was important to me and the team." 
"I feel very humble," Pikosovits said. "l feel a lot of pride in it...I didn't want to pat myself on the back, but I thought it was a pretty good thing to happen."

. Belles athletics changes from single team to conference champion 
By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Sports Editor 
It's not a history that includes perfecting the forward pass or claiming countless national championships, but it is a history worth revisiting, a history full of growth and expansion. From the first team to take the field in 1934 to the first MIAA championship team last year, the Saint Mary's athletic department has grown \'.ith the times. 
In 1934, 12 women took the field as the first organized athletic team in Saint Mary's history and won one game. That was the beginning of a program that features seven varsity teams, a complete intramural schedule and a phys­ical fitness program today. 
"That was just such a fabulous statement and landmark for Saint Mary's," athletic director Lynn Kachmarik said. 
Following that first game in 1934, the department moved from an intramural program to an NAIA member up to NCAA status in 1990. 
By 1982, Saint Mary's had established a complete varsity program, sporting swimming and diving, softball, basket­ball, gymnastics and crew. The Belles established a solid rivalry with Notre Dame's varsity women's teams and had their share of competition across route 31. 
The Belles seemed to take control in volleyball, beating the Irish the first two years the women played varsity, but always seemed to fall short in basketball, keeping a series record of 0-10 against the Irish. 
"Although the rivalry is a fairly new one, the intensity is high," said Mary DiStanislao, former Notre Dame women's basketball coach . 
With the intensive program under way, the Belles need­ed a conference affiliation. Under the leadership of athletic director Erin Murhpy, Saint Mary's joined the NAIA in the first step toward establishing itself in the athletic world. 
Following its arrival in the NAIA, Saint Mary's had one of its best spring seasons in history. The softball team claimed the Indiana Division III Championship and 14 members of the track and field team qualified for nation­als. Eleven grabbed top six finishes. 
When Jo-Ann Nester took over in 1984, the NAIA wasn't enough. Over the next five years Nester looked into mem­bership and by 1989, the Belles had dual membership in the NCAA and NAIA. 
"As an NCAA Division III affiliate, we now have the opportunity to compete tn a non-scholarship division among schools with athletic and academic philosophies similar to ours," Nester said at the time. "This kind of peer scheduling clearly will allow our teams to be more compet­itive in post-season play at the district, regional and national level." 
For the next nine years the Belles would play in the NCAA without any conference affiliation and the basketball program hit its peak under the leadership of Marvin Wood. 
In the fall of 1999, Saint Mary's would take its final steps to becoming the program it is today. 
Beginning in 1997, the Belles had been playing with the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Assocation. Finally, in 1999, they took the final step and became full-fledged members of the MIAA. Acting athletic director Jini Cook took the Belles most of the way and then handed the pro­gram over to Kachmarik for completion. 
"Coaches recruiting for their sports can offer a stable conference, a stable schedule and a strong competition to incoming freshman athletes," Cook said after she brought Saint Mary's into the MIAA. 
Two years later, the Belles have one MIAA championship to their name and are looking for another one this week­end. 
Over 60 years after the first Saint Mary's women took the field, moving from intracollege competition to state level competition, Saint Mary's is still looking ahead. 
"Now I would like to see our teams compete at the NCAA Division III national level," Kachmarik said.

seasons. 
Meghan Rafferty Weldon grad­uated in 1988 with her name already embossed in Saint Mary's history. As a member of the Belles swimming and diving team she set three school records as an individual and qualified as part of three record­breaking relay teams for the national championship. Weldon held individual school records in the 100 and 200-yard back­stroke and the 50-yard freestyle. 
The 90's produced the largest part of the 2001 induction class.. After joining the NCAA in 1991, Saint Mary's had more to offer its student athletes. 
1991 graduate Nicole Hill Colucci still holds the record in the indoor 1-mile and 2-mile run and was the 10,000-meter District Champion. During her stay at Saint Mary's she was named Most Valuable Player on the track team and received the Coach's Leadership Award. 

Kelly Cook, a 1992 graduate, led the Saint Mary's soccer team during her tenure at the cam­pus. She was a three-time All­Region soccer player and was named to the NSCAA All­American team. 
Rounding out the class of 2001 are 1993 graduate Karen Lorton and 1994 gradate Dalsaso. Lorton holds six school records in volleyball and earned the NCAA All-Region player Award. Dalsaso, like Cook, was named to the NSCM All-American team in soccer and was a three time All-Region player. 

Activities this weekend are focused around intermingling alumni and current student ath­letes. Tonight at 7 p.m. there will be an alumni basketball game and inductees are encouraged to cheer on current Belles teams during Saturday's home soccer, volleyball and golf competitions. 
Alumni will also have the 
. ·-­

opportunity to face off against future hall-of-famers in alumni/varsity tennis, softball and volleyball matches on Saturday afternoon. Alumnae ­soccer players can compete with current Belles soccer players on Saturday, and the swim team will host an alumnae meet at Holfs Aquatics Center Sunday morning.

ND WOMEN'S SOCCER 
. No. 4 Irish: We're finally playing up to our ability 
I ­
By JOELiCANORO 
Sports Writer 
After struggling in some of their early games due to injuries, the No. 4 Irish are finally healthy and ready to return to last year's form that carried them all the way to the NCAA Final Four. 
With a three game streak and a newfound confidence, the Irish hope to continue their momentum this week­end against Big East oppo­nents Pittsburgh and West Virginia. 
"For the first time all sea­son. all three separate units -offense, midfield and defense -we're on the same page," said senior fullback Lindsey Jones. "Tuesday was a great reminder that we are capable of playing well together. I think we have moved past some of the mis­takes that hurt us at the beginning of the season because we are communicat­ing with one another." 
While the Irish certainly showed they were capable of defeating any team in the country with their resounding victory over No. 3 Nebraska on Tuesday, the Irish have yet to be tested on the road this season. On Friday night, the Irish will leave the friendly confines of Alumni Field and travel to Pittsburgh. 
While the Pittsburgh Panthers are not regarded as one of the stronger teams in the Big East, Notre Dame knows full well that they can­not take anyone lightly. 
"I do not think playing on the road will be a problem for 
us because all of our upper­classmen have traveled and played on the road before," said Jones. "Playing on the road will be a new experience for the freshmen, but I think we are ready for the game Friday night." 
The Irish expect Pittsburgh to play a very defensive-ori­ented game to offset Notre Dame's superior athleticism and speed. The Panthers 
-

boast last year's Big East goalie of the year Rachel Brown. The Irish must rely on the passing abilities of their midfielders Randi Scheller and Mia Sarkesian to create quality scoring chances for forwards Arny Warner, Amanda Guertin, and Kelly Tulisiak. 
The Irish will have little time to recuperate from Friday's game against the Panthers as they must return to South Bend to host the West Virginia Mountaineers on Sunday at 1 p.m. at Alumni Field. Sunday's game for the Irish is critically important because the Mountaineers are currently tied with the frish for the Big East lead, 
Last year, the Irish squeaked out an overtime vic­tory at West Virginia so they know that West Virginia is eagerly awaiting their chance to avenge last year's loss. 
"This is a huge game for us for so many reasons," said Notre Dame head coach Randy Waldrum. "This game will go a long way in deter­mining who will the Big East Title. 
West Virginia has three all­Big East players in their start­ing lineup including projected Big East offensive player of the year Katie Barnes. West Virginia is an excellent team. 
"They already have some big wins this season including a big win over No. 19-ranked Auburn," said Waldrum. "I expect West Virginia to give us a real challenge so we must play our best to defeat them on Sunday." 
The lrish's record currently sits at six wins and one tie. If they play the way they did against Nebraska on Tuesday night, their record will most certainly be improved to eight wins and one tie at the end of this weekend while sitting atop the Big East with four wins and zero losses in con­ference play.

By JEFF BALTRUZAK Assiscam Spores Editor 
Desperate to avoid the first 0­3 start in school history, an 0-2 Notre Dame football team enters Saturday's game at undefeated Texas A&M the object of national scrutiny, piloted by first-time starter Carlyle Holiday. 
Holiday's ascent to the high­est pressure position in college football clearly illustrates a tPam in dire need of' offensive fireworks. The Irish have scored just 20 points in their first two games, struggling to maintain drives and facing third and long passing si Lua­ti ons that have frequently turnf>d into completions well short of the first down marker. 
"The reality is that we ·re not scoring enough points," said Irish head coach Bob Davie Tuesday. "Carlyle deserved that opportunity to see if he can generate points." 
Davie understands that Holiday can only do so much to pllt the hall in the end zone. 
"I think our team under­stands we need execution in all phases," Davie said. "We need­ed to improve in so many ways to win, it doesn't matter who was the quarterback." 
The Irish have shown only brief flashes of proper execu­tion, mostly on defense. 
The Irish front seven anchored by Grant Irons, Courtney Watson and Tony Weaver has been solid this sea­son, holding highly touted tail­back T.J. Duckett to just 71 yards while putting up a fierce pass rush during Notre Dame's loss to Michigan State. 
With seniors Jordan Black and Kurt Vollers providing effective run blocking and with Holiday under center, the Irish line will have an easier time keeping their young signal caller off his back. 
"With Carlyle back there, it makes pass blocking a lot easi­er," said Black. "We'll run a lot of options just becausC'­Carlyle's an option kind of guy." 
Whik pass blocking might be easier in College Station, hear­ing Holiday's signals and snap counts amid a notoriously loud and hostile crowd at Kyle Field will complicate the line's job considerably. On passing plays", Black said hC'-will hold hands with guard Scan Mahan and wait for Mahan to tug his hand after tho s11ap. 
"It makes me a step slower," Black said. 
For many Irish players, the A&M game is more than the third game of what has turned into a tough season, it is a return home. Besides Holiday, who hails from San Antonio, Texas, 13 other players on the Notre Dame roster are from Texas, a top recruiting area for Irish coaches. 
"Just the fact that it's in Texas is huge." said senior inside linebacker Tyreo Harrison, a native of Sulphur Springs, Texas. "This date has been marked for a long time." 
It's been on the Aggies' cal­endar a while as well. Texas A&M has yet to play a ranked opponent, with wins over light­ly-regarded, non-conference

Facing the pressure at home 
Sophomore quarterback 
will make his first start in 
his home state 
By NOAH AMSTADTER 
Sports Editor 
Carlyle Holiday walks into the interview room for his first tele­conference as Notre Dame's start­ing quarterback. When he gets there, he finds a surprise. 
Sitting with the rest of his pads and _jersey -waiting for him to wear during a photo shoot -is what appears to be a large white ball. Upon closer inspection, Holiday finds that it L5 his helmet -with about seven !avers of ath­letic tape completely covering it. 
"That's just our offensive line," Holiday said. "Whnn they are get­ting treatment, playing around with us, just because we are littler than they are." 
Looking like your average Notre Dame sophomore, he answers questions, he remains modest, and listens patiently, considers every question and provides a thoughtful answer. 
But the world for this quiet, col­lected 19-year-old changed with one phone call Monday morning. 
Called Into Action 
Back in his room in Carroll Hall, the telephone rang. The Notre Dame coaching staff wanted to meet with Holiday before practice. 
So after class, Holiday walked over to the locker room at Notre Dame Stadium and sat down to listen to the coaches. The message was short, but it had a meaning of astronomic proportions. 
Holiday would take over for Matt Lovecchio as Notre Dame's starting quarterback Saturday afternoon against Texas A&M. Holiday, who lives in San Antonio, Texas, reacted calmlv to the news that he would make·his first start in his home state. 
"He was very matter-of-fact," Irish offensive coordinator Kevin Rogers said of Holiday's reaction. "He's a Texas guy, so I think he's very excited about it." 
On the practice field, the repeti­tions weren't all that different than they had been with Lovecchio as the starter. Both quarterbacks are quiet by nature and they had been sharing snaps at practice all season. But Monday, something was different. 
"We are just practicing like we have been normally," Holiday said. "It's just me with the first team and him with the second team." 
While the quarterback generally serves as the commander in the huddle, veterans on the team such as Tony Fisher and Jeff Faine have provided a sense of calm while the quarterback focused on running the o.lfense. 
"fle's a guy that really has taken charge or the huddle for !he firsl. time as thA No. I guy," Rogers said. "It's a role that he really has to take charge ofand get used to." 
Rut Holiday's quiet, businE'sslike demeanor hasn't hampered his ability to lAad the Irish chargA downfield. With speakers blasting into practice th.is week to stimu­late the loud fans the Irish will face al. Kyle Field., Holiday has let himself be heard. 
"Carlyle, I feel is a pretty quiet guy, but he speaks up pretty loud out thcfre," offensive guard Kurt Vollers-said. "You always know what's going on."

With less than two full quarters of play behind him -none before this month -the unknown factor is how Holiday can play a full game under pressure. 
"It's how you respond to the bumps in the road and how you respond to the mistakes more than how it is when things are going smooth," head coach Bob Davie said. "That'll be the mark of whether he's a successful quarter­back or not." 
Facing the pressure 
As the Irish coaches and players walked into the Stadium after practice Monday night, nearly every reporter crowded around Davie. With his first response, Davie answered their question: "We're going to go with Carlyle Holiday this weekend." 
Everything changed. Soon a mob had formed around Holiday, just returning from his first prac­tice as the starter. Reporters pushed tape recorders in his face. They battled for the right to ask the next question. 
lloliday stood patiently, helmet in his hand, and looked each reporter in the eye as the ques­tions kept on coming. Reserved by nature, Holiday never cut his answers short. The reporters ­some rrom as far away as San Antonio -left with all of their questions answered. 
The next day, the same crowd., this time including a few more reporters who missed Monday's show, gathered around once again. 
On Wndnesday, Holiday had to !it in the teleconference, posing for photographs in Washington llall and practice. He also attend­ed his full load of sophomore· classes in the business school. But somehow, Holiday has kept his focus. 

"I don't really let anything dis­tract me," Holiday said during the teleconference, his voice remain­ing calm and collected. ''I've just been going to practice with the same mindset I have been since the season started. There's been a lot more questions asked or what­ever, but I just, you know, sort of try to stay focused in football." 
But the fan attention can cause some problems. Notre Dame stu­dent e-mail addresses are avail­able to anybody via the school's Web site, and Holiday has received his fair share ofsupport. 
"I probably have [received quite a bit of e-mail from fans!, but I don't check them anvmore," he said. "It's getting a littie bit out of control." 
As Holiday ref'lel'ts on thA answers, he exhibits not one bit of the arrogance or cockiness associ­ated with many athletes of his cal­iber. He treats every reporter and every question as fairly and hon­estly as he can. 
"He is a special guy," Rogers said. "You're talking about one of the nicest people you 1wer wanted to meet. There's not a big shot bone in his body. I think he's gen­uinely a decent human bfiing." 
Coming home 
The attention and pressure is nothing new to Holiday. lie played high school ball in Texas for Roosevelt High in San Antonio. High school football is to Texas what religion is to a priest. Quite simply, it's life. 

"It's pretty big," Holiday said. "It's almost like a college atmos­phere. It's serious." 
On Fr_iday afternoons, school would let out early. The gymnasi­ums would fill to the rafters as cheerleaders and students and families cheered the team on at the pep rallies. 
But the atmosphere has its neg­ative side as well. 
"If coaches don't win down there in football, they get fired," Holiday said. 
And Homecoming game was the biggest of all. Fifteen thousand fans would fill the stadium. Players and their dates spent more time getting ready for the homecoming dan<'e than they did for Prom. Girls walked around with bouquets of flowers that cov­ered their arms. 
"Homecoming was real big. It's serious," Holiday said. "PP.ople walk arow1d with 20 [flowers] on their arm. It's just big." 
Playing in that atmosphere has helped Holiday adjust to starting on one of college football's most glorified roles as well as adjusting to large venues. 
"There are big crowds at the games down there," Holiday said. "It helped out a little bit, it's not the exact same amount as the col­lege game, but it's as big as it gets in high school." · 
On Saturday, Holiday has his own personal homecoming. He's already left tickets for 15 friends and relatives who plan on making the trip up to College Station from San Antonio, and has fielded request<; from many more. 
Kyle Field isn't wholly unfamil­iar to Holiday, who attended games there his junior and senior years of high school when he was recruited by Texas A&M. He is ready to for the loudest game he's ever played, but says the team is ready as well. 
"It's not really a factor, unless we make it a factor." Holiday said. "We've worked on it." 
Holiday also looks forward to seeing his parents, who called him with congrutulatiuns Tuesday night. 
"They're excited, they just want me to go out and· win," Holiday said. 
Winning on the field is why he l"'.arne to Notre Oamc. While he may be quiet, Holiday looks reporters and coaches in the Aye and says he came to Notre Dame to win. 
Saturday he gets his chance. Right back in Texas, where he started.

COACHING 
Davie's never been on a seat as hot as the one he's on now. lle'll need to win to get the critics off his back. No Notre Dame coach has started ofT 0-3 -ever. 

QUARTERBACKS 
Holiday is the clear starter here. Irish coach­es have decided to shake up the offense and give the sophomore his first start. The coaches have also made clear that he will see most of the action -it's unlikely that LoVecchio "'ill see signifi­cant playing time. 
IRISH RUSHING 
Fisher has emerged as the top Irish runner, but Jones will probably see significant carries dur­ing Saturday's game. The olTensivc line did a much bfltter job opnning up holes last week. 
IRISH PASSING 
Injuries to Givens and Battle have hurt the Irish passing game severely. While Hunter has established himself as a legitamate threat and Jenkins looked solid in his first appearance last week, the Irish have been relucatant to throw the long ball this year. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::::::::::::::::::::::::: 
Slocumb is synonymous with Texas A&M foot­bal I. He is virtually unbeatable at home. Slocumb was responsi­ble for giving Davie his first major coaching position. 

Farris is very similar to last year's Heisman Trophy winner Chris Weikne. Both played minor league baseball before joining college football programs. And he's a prolific passer, throwing for 341 yards against Wyoming. 
A weak defensive front characterizns the Aggie defense. Both defensive ends arc recovering from injuries sustained last year, but Warren is a powerful nose guard. The Aggie line­backer corps is also fairly solid. Davie coached the first generation of the Aggie famp,d "Wrecking Crew."

JAMIE SQUIRE/Allsport Wildcats' quarterback Zak Kustok hands off to Damien Anderson during Northwestern's victory over Illinois last season. Northwestern's game against Michigan State is the first home opener since Rashidi Wheeler's death. 
WIidcats readyfor emotionalhome opener 
By GREG LADKY 
Sports Writer 
Saturday's game between No. 23 Michigan State and No. 16 Northwestern will be the Wildcats' first home game since the death of safety Rashidi Wheeler. Wheeler collapsed and died shortly after a summer condition­ing drill Aug. 3, just days after Minnesota Vikings star Korey Stringer died of a heat stroke during prac­tice. 
Both deaths shocked the football world. Northwestern will pay tribute to Wheeler before the game with a moment of silence, along with a ceremony for the victims of the terrorist attacks Sept. 11. 

The Wildcats look to improve to 3-0 for the first time since 1962. Ara Paraseghian was the Wildcats' head coach that year. To win, the Wildcats will offer the Spartans a healthy dose of running back and Heisman candi­date Damien Anderson, who gained 189 yards rushing and four touch­downs in Northwestern's 44-7 rout of Duke last Saturday. Notre Dame transfer Zak Kustok passed for 318 yards for

The game will be the Tigers first visit to Volunteer Stadium since 1993. The Tigers beat Tennessee 38-31 in overtime last year in Baton Rouge. 
LSU has outstanding skill players. In last week's 31­14 victory against Utah State, running back LaBrandon Toefield rushed for 183 yards and four touchdowns. Quarterback Rohan Davey can run and throw. He has 482 yards passing in LSU's first two games. 
The Volunteers squeezed out a 13-3 victory against Arkansas in their last game. Running back Travis Stephens ranks third in the country with 158 rushing yards a game. Many experts consider Tennessee defensive lineman John Henderson the best player in the nation. 
Anticipate a thrilling SEC game filled with talented players on both sides of the ball. Like most SEC bat­tles, big plays ,viii win this game. 
the Wildcats. 

The Spartans will be fly­ing high after their victory at Notre Dame last Saturday. Running back 
T.J. Duckett looks to get back on track after a mod­est 71-yard rushing per­formance against the Irish. The Spartans will likely split snaps between Jeff Smoker and Ryan Van Dyke at quarterback again. 
Saturday's game match­es two of the best running backs not only in the Big Ten, but also in the nation. Expect big days from both backs. Michigan State must exploit the height advantage their receivers have over the Wildcat corners. Michigan State wide receiver Charles Rogers stands at 6-foot-4. Northwestern corners Raheem Covington and Chasda Martin stand 5-foot-9 and 5-foot-11 respectively. Rogers scored the 47-yard touch­down that finished the Irish last Saturday. 
Irish fans will take inter­est in how the Wildcats' aggressive spread offen­sive attack moves the ball against the young Spartan defense. The Wildcats should be able to score points in bunches. Expect an offensive shootout in this game. 

Kansas State at Oklahoma 
Two great defenses will collide when No. 11 Kansas State and No. 3 Oklahoma battle Saturday. No teani played the defending national champions as tough as Kansas State last year. The Sooners needed a fourth­quarter comeback to beat the Wildcats in last year's Big 12 championship game. 
Kansas State out-gained New Mexico State 528-115 last week. The defense has given up a total of six points against USC and New Mexico State. Quarterback Ell Roberson will be the key for the Wildcat offense. He has been inconsistent thus far, but needs to play well to break the Oklahoma defense. 
Some believe the Sooner defense is the best college football has seen in years. Linebacker Rocky Calmus is the most watched player on the unit, but there's loads of talent elsewhere, especially with safeties Brandon Everage and Roy Williams. 
The Sooners have not played since Sept. 8. New 
quarterback Nate Ilybl will have to shake off some rust, or else the Sooners will find themselves is anoth­
