Student Senate fails to pass proposal 
Group votes down resolution to change structure, authority 
By MAUREEN REYNOLDS Associate News Editor 
A proposal to change the structure and authority of student government failed to pass at Sunday's Student Senate meeting. 
Senators voting against the proposal, which failed 14-9 to gain the necessary two­thirds approval, cited con­cerns over changes in authority on certain budget­ing issues. 
The resolution, introduced by Student body president Pat Hallahan, would have altered the structure of the Executive Cabinet, which represents all student gov­ernment groups except the Senate, to include four sena­tors and allow the student body vice president to vote on resolutions. 
The proposal would also transfer powers of budget approval and constitutional amendments to the Executive Cabinet and require the student body president to present all Executive Cabinet-approved constitutional changes to Senate before signing them into effect. 
Prior to the vote, senators passed changes to the pro­posal, including the number of senators allowed sit on the Executive Cabinet and requiring the student body president to report to Senate on all constitutional changes approved by the Executive Cabinet before signing those changes into effect. 
Senators voted on, but did not approve, removal of the clause calling for the Executive Cabinet to approve the budget, a change pre­sented at Wednesday's meet­

ing and supported by Hallahan. 
At Sunday's meeting, Hallahan said that he believed senators should dis­cuss that issue at a later time. 
"I think we should address [the budget] later because it won't even come up until March, and there are a lot of issues to discuss already," he said. 
The long-term goal of this resolution, said Hallahan, was to form a Council of Representatives from the Executive Cabinet, which would represent every com­mittee in student govern­ment. Currently, the Executive Cabinet represents all the committees except the Senate. 
Senators agreed on the need for a single committee, but disagreed about the extent of power to be grant­ed to it. Their main problem concerned the amendment calling for the power to amend the constitution to be given to the Executive Cabinet before the Council of Representatives is formed. 
"[The Council of Representatives] does not yet exist," said Amy Chambers, off-campus senator, during the meeting. "If we want to make big changes, we should form the group first, and then give them the power [to amend the Constitution.]" 
Hallahan disagreed, saying "If we say we want to wait and see, we will be saying 'We don't trust you,' and that will create an immediate division [in s_tudent govern­ment.] Senate has all the power right now. All I'm ask-

Despite the failure of his proposal to reorganize stu­dent government, Student body president Pat Hallahan said he remains optimistic about the future of this resolution. 
"It's very disappointing," said Hallahan after the meeting. "It was clear that the majority of Senators are for this resolution.... I think it's going to get done." 
But at the same time, Hallahan said that the Senate's vote Sunday 

wouldn't affect the report he is scheduled to present to the University's Board of Trustees on Thursday. Hallahan had said before Senate's action Sunday that his report would address student government issues in some manner. 
"I think we're progress­ing on this, and I don't think it will affect [the report] too much. Hopefully by Wednesday we'll get something done, and I can report that to [the board]," he said. "I have no doubt that every­thing that we've been

By MEGHANNE DOWNES News Editor 
Elkhart County sheriffs arrested a Notre Dame security officer Wednesday for assaulting his seven-week-old baby and charged him with battery after he admit­ted to the abus­ing the child, a local newspaper reported. 
Timothy Clark, a 32-year-old security officer who has been employed by the University since September 2001, is on paid administrative leave until "his sit­uation becomes clearer," University spokesman Matt Storin said. 
According to the Elkhart Truth, police said Clark admitted Wednesday that he .dropped, shook and spanked Samuel Clark, who was born on Aug. 19, some­time between Sept. 29 and Oct. 6. 
The Truth reported that the abuse investigation began after Timothy Clark and his wife, Elizabeth, took their son to St. Joseph Regional Medical Center Oct. 6 because he was vomiting. After examining the baby, hospital officials notified Child Protective Services of a potential abuse case, who then forwarded the case to police. Police did not indicate whether Elizabeth Clark took part in or was aware of the abuse. 
Medical reports obtained by the Truth said the baby's injuries included a fractured skull and broken wrist, rib, leg and facial bone. The baby was hospitalized for at least three days, and it was not immediately clear if he remains at the St. Joseph Regional Medical Center. A spokesperson

Departments seek alternatives to fund speakers 

By TERESA FRALISH Assistant News Editor 
In spite of significant budget cuts, Notre Dame organizations have still been successful in bringing prominent speakers to campus this semester by turn­ing to other options, sueh as co­sponsorship or grants, to fund talks from well-known individu­als. 
As a result of the decrease in the endowment and the drop in the economy, University officials made cuts to department and institute funding across the board last year. From 2001 to 2002, the endowment fell from $2.85 to $2.6 million, prompt­ing University officials to cut the academic budget by 7 percent. 
Despite these decreases in funding, University departments have secured contracts from a number of well-known individu­als, including Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Frank McCourt, author of the Pulitzer prize­winning book "Angela's Ashes". is scheduled to speak at Notre Dame this week. 
John Cavadini, director of the Institute for Church Life, which sponsored the talk by Obasanjo, said his institute pursued a variety of options to fund the speech. "This conference was completely funded by grants from internal and external units at the University," he said. 
Other University institutes said ~arefully planned strate­gies were needed to bring prominent speakers to campus. Hal Culbertson, associate direc­tor of the Kroc Institute, which helped bring Tutu to Notre Dame, said the Institute began organizing far in advance. 
"The conference was part of a research project," Culbertson said. "We're able to do that through careful planning.

Show me 

the money 

According to a recent study by a mutual fund trading group, 50 per­cent of American families expect to have about $35,000 saved up to pay college tuition by the time their first child turns 
18. This means 
Joe Trombello 

that most fami­lies can expect to have saved News Production between one and Editor two years of col­lege tuition ­although at some colleges, $35,000 translates into less than a year once room and board are factored in. 
From 1992-2002, while inflation rose 28 percent, the average in­state cost of attending public schools rose 79 percent. The University of Arizona increased its tuition by more than 39 percent this year, and many other public colleges hiked up their tuition by proportionate eye-popping amounts. Private institutions imposed similar tuition increases, raising the price of an education nearly 75 percent between 1992­2002, according to a 2002 report from CollegeBoard titled "Trends in College Pricing." 
Although student financial aid increased more than the cost of college tuition and fees over the past decade, much of that growth has been through loans, not grants. Grants declined from half of all total aid to 39 percent in the past 11 years. Current students gradu­ate from college with an average of $19,000 in debt, according to a 2002 National Student Loan Survey conducted by Nellie Mae, and stu­dents must frequently work increasing hours to make ends meet. 
All of these statistics point to a troubling problem in colJege educa­tion-simply put, colJege tuition is far too high. 
Administrators should be embar­rassed that they have allowed col­lege costs to skyrocket far beyond price increases due to inflation. It's time to take a serious look at why costs continue to rise. 
Why must colleges spend exorbi­tant amounts of money on frills like $70 million student centers (Vermont) or $54 million sports complexes (Rhode Island)? How can administrators continue to view these items as necessities? Colleges should be comfortable places for students to live and to studyt but are lavish expenses like these really necessary? 
College officials need to do a bet­ter job of seriously examining expenditures. Faculty salaries, maintenance costs, financial aid expenditures -nothing should be left unquestioned. ColJege students and their parents should demand greater accountability from school officials and receive more accessi­bility to financial data. 
It's time to do something serious about the cost of educating a stu­dent, before work-study programs turn into work-work programs.

Apartment Tenant Kills Goats for Food 
PAWTUCKET, H.l. -An apartment tenant has admitted he slaughtered two goats in the building in which he lives. 
Neighbors caJled police Wednesday after seeing Pedro Rodrigues lead the goats into the building's basement. The neighbors later found a pool of blood on the basement floor. 
Rodrigues told police he killed the goats, so a friend could cook them, the Times of Pawtucket reported. The 36-year-old said he slit their throats, and lay them on the floor to bleed out. Fearing that police may think he killed a person, Rodrigues had his friend produce the goats' carcasses. 
City law prohibits resi­dents from keeping goats and other livestock. Rodrigues will face a mis­demeanor charge, police said.

ND grad probes CIA leak 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The investi­gation into who leaked the identity of an undercover CIA officer is shining a spotlight on a 30-year Justice Department prosecutor more accustomed to staying out of the public eye on even the biggest cases. 
John Dion, a 57-year-old Notre Dame graduate, is chief of the agency's counterespi­onage section, a group of a dozen career public servants who specialize in the govern­ment's most sensitive national security investigations. 
In recent years, these have included FBI spy Robert Hanssen, CIA spy Aldrich Ames and accused al-Qaida conspira­tor Zacarias Moussaoui. 
As high-profile as those cases were, none included the politi­cal overtones of the CIA leak probe, which is focused on the White House and has drawn Democratic calls for appoint­ment of a special counsel to remove possible conflicts of interest for Attorney General John Ashcroft. 
The investigation concerns who leaked to several reporters the name of Valerie Plame, a CIA undercover officer married to former Ambassador Joseph 
C. Wilson. The leak followed Wilson's public charges that President Bush was manipulat­ing intelligence to exaggerate the threat posed by Iraq. 

Those who have worked with Dion say he will not shy away from advocating charges against any high-level Bush administration official if that's where the investigation leads. 
"I have no doubt that John has all the independence nec­essary to do his job the right way," said Paul McNulty, U.S. attorney for Virginia's eastern district. "He is used to working on cases that get a lot of atten­tion. He is a thoughtful, careful person." 
But not, associates say, a man who likes the limelight. 
That trait was underscored Wednesday at a Justice 
school and the University of Notre Dame. He joined what then was called the internal security section in 1980, gradu­ally rising through the ranks until he became acting chief in 1997 and chief in 2002. 
Dion has twice received the John Marshall Award for Outstanding Achievement, one of the highest Justice Department awards: first in 1987 for work on the Walker family spy ring case and again in 1997 for espionage prosecu­tions of FBI agent Earl Pitts and CIA officer Harold Nicholson. 
The Walker case

Union and Russia; 
Nicholson was sen­tenced to 23 years in prison in 1997 for providing Russia with names of CIA officers and other classified documents.

ND benefactor dies of cancer at 75 

By MEGHANNE DOWNES 
News Editor 
Joan Kroc, Notre Dame benefac­tor and philanthropist, died Sunday after a bout with brain cancer in her Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. home. She was 75. 
Kroc, the widow of McDonald's Corporation founder Ray Kroc, estab­lished and endowed the Joan B. Kroc 
Institute for Kroc International Peace Studies at Notre Dame with $12 million in 1986 and was a major donator to peace organiza­tions, said Scott Appleby, director of the Kroc Institute for International Studies. 
Kroc, who had no direct connec­tion to Notre Dame, d·ecided to establish the foundation after she learned of then-University President Father Theodore Hesburgh's desire to establish peace through cross-cultural study, dialogue and peace building. 
"Mrs. Kroc was single-mined in her dedication to eliminating the threat of nuclear weapons and all forms of deadly violence," Appleby and Hesburgh said in a joint state­ment. ''The establishment and con­tinuing support of Notre Dame's Kroc Institute was just one of sever­al important initiatives she fostered in support of human rights, conflict transformation and peace building around the world." 
Kroc also made substantial dona­tions to establish the University of San Diego's Institute for Peace and Justice and to the Salvation Army to build the Ray and Joan Kroc Community Center in San Diego. The Joan B. Kroc Foundation sup­ported agencies that dealt with AIDS research, world hunger, sub­stance abuse and care for the ter­minally ill, including the St. Vmcent de Paul Joan Kroc Center for the Homeless in San Diego, San Diego Hospice and the Betty Ford Center, said Appleby. 
"She was a kind and gracious person who sought no attention to herself and who wanted to give as much of her money as possible for the good causes in which she believed," University President Father Edward Malloy said in a statement. 
Kroc, who was a professional musician and music teacher, is sur­vived by her daughter, four grand­daughters and four great-grand­daughters.

Decisions were made ... at least a year ago." 
Culbertson declined to discuss how significant the budget cuts were for the Kroc Institute, but said the budget did shrink due to the drop in the endowment. 
According to Cavadini, the Institute for Church Life saw a definite decrease in funding for this year, because the Institute's resources are closely tied to the University endowment. "If the endowment goes down we have to make cuts," Cavadini said.

Other senators agreed with Hallahan's perspective. 
''I'm for [giving the Executive Cabinet the power to amend th~ Constitution] because I don't believe Senate should determine the Constitution for every group," said Knott sena­tor Brian Agganis. "It's sur­prising to me that we even have that power. It's a major power, but it's something we as a Senate haven't even dealt with this year." 
"Our income goes down imme­diately." 
However, the Institute funded the talk by Obasanjo and has plans to bring at least two other scholars to speak on campus this semester, according to Cavadini. "You just focus more," he said. 
Cavadini said he believed the Institute for Church Life could continue to sponsor a similar number of talks to previous years by focusing on advance planning and co-sponsorship between University depart­ments.

Clark remained in the Elkhart County Jail Sunday night with a bond set at $80,000. He was arrested on three Class B felony charges that, if prosecutors decide to file formal charges, could lead to 20 years in prison. Neither the Elkhart County Sheriff's Office or the Elkhart County Prosecutor's Office could be reached for comment by The Observer. 
In his job as a security officer, Clark did not carry a gun or make arrests, Starin said.

After extensive debate, the resolution failed. However, Senators believe that there is hope for some form of the res­olution to be passed. 
"I think it was a very impor­tant resolution, and I still think there is hope that a form of it will be passed in the near future," said Howard senator Brin Anderson. "I think a lot of Senators were uncomfortable giving powers to this group because they don't know where it is going. As soon as there is a clear vision of where that is, I believe there will be approval of the resolution."

Students run in marathon

Poles celebrate papal anniverary 
KRAKOW, Poland -Troubled by television pictures of a stooped and frail Pope John Paul II, Poles celebrated the 25th anniversary of their native son's papacy Sunday with prayers for his health and memories of his inspiration for their overthrow of communism. 
Throughout this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country, church leaders, former school chums and well-wishers cheered the former Karol Wojtyla, the cardinal from the southern. city of Krakow whose Oct. 16, 1978, election as pope strengthened an oppressed nation. 
Churches and central squares were fes­tooned with yellow papal banners as Poles expressed their affection for John Paul in Masses, concerts and national television spe­cials. 
Bolivian protesters killed 
LA PAZ, Bolivia -Bolivia's government imposed martial law on a city outside the capi­tal Sunday after clashes between troops and demonstrators angry about proposals to export gas to the United States and Mexico. Sixteen people have been reported killed. 
Soldiers manned major intersections in El Alto, a poor, industrial city 10 miles outside the capital, La Paz. But the move didn't stop pro­testers who repeatedly clashed with the sol­diers and police trying to disperse them. 
Roman Catholic priest Asensio Mamani said he saw three people killed in the clashes in his neighborhood, Senakata, on Sunday. Another priest, Modesto Chino, said two demonstrators were also killed in the Bolivian neighborhood. 
Those deaths would bring the total killed to 16 in El Alto since the clashes began. The gov­ernment earlier reported that 11 people had been killed.

They were finally separated at 11:17 a.m., hospital officials said in a prepared statement. 
"They are now within striking distance of living independent lives," said Dr. Jim Thomas, chief of critical care at the hospital. 
Following the separation, craniofacial sur­geons began reconstructing their skulls and closing the wounds with skin and tissue creat­ed by expanders that were put in the boys' heads and thighs about five months ago.

Hallahan supported this resolution because he believed it would facilitate better cooperation between groups within student gov­ernment as well as make student government more efficient. Before the meeting, he talked with senators to answer their questions and try to get support for the resolution. 
"I tried to talk to as many senators as I could over the l·ast few days ... and I was able to get in touch with many of them," Hallahan said. 
If the resolution had passed, it would have allowed four senators to sit on the Executive Cabinet, thus forming a body that would have representatives from every Student Government group called the Council of Representatives.

At the meeting, senators expressed concerns about the powers and goals of the proposed group. 
They disagreed on allow­ing the new organization the sole power to amend the Constitution. Hallahan addressed these concerns after the meeting. 
"I think some [senators] had concerns about what this group is going to look like," Hallahan said. "Hopefully at tomorrow's [Executive Cabinet] meeting, we will decide what needs to happen next, and we'll go back to Senate with that rec­ommendation."

the hard­liner Hindu political party, Shiv Sena, officials in Uttar Pradesh state said Sunday. 
The council has called a rally on Oct. 17 to demand Hindus be allowed to build a temple in the city of Ayodhya, 300 miles east of New Delhi. 
Hindu hard-liners believe the Babri mosque was built by Muslims on the site of an earlier Hindu temple honor­ing their supreme god, Ram a. 
Muslims say there's no proof of that and oppose Hindu plans to build a tem­ple there. 
On Friday, the High Court in Uttar Pradesh ordered the state government to pre­vent religious activity near the site in Ayodhya while the court reviews the decades-old Hindu-Muslim dispute. 
At a huge gathering in 1992, thousands of Hindu activists razed the Babri Mosque with spades, crow­bars and bare hands.

IN BRIEF 
Recall boosts California retail 
LOS ANGELES -Businesses big and small 
shared the estimated $107 million pumped 
into California's economy by the recall. 
The biggest campaign expense -$27 mil­lion recorded to date-has been for television or cable airtime, according to financial disclo­sures filed with the state. But other beneficiar­ies included campaign button makers, bakers, petition gatherers and companies renting everything from computers to cars. 
They all got a piece of the $55 million spent so far by the campaigns as well as the estimat­ed $52 million it took to stage last Tuesday's election, according to an Orange County Register analysis published Sunday. 
"It's become almost a cottage industry," said Jack Kyser, senior economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. 
$8M spent to thwart druf! bill 
WASHINGTON -The pharmaceutica1 indus­try's trade group spent $8.5 million in lobbying this year as it worked against a bill to allow importation of government-approved drugs. 
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America spent the money lobbying Congress and federal agencies in the first half of this year, the most the group has ever spent in a reporting period, according to federal reports reviewed by The Associated Press. Lobbying totals cover expenses such as salaries and mailings but not campaign contri­butions. 
L.A. fans optimistic about sale 
LOS ANGELES -The Los Angeles Dodgers may soon be back in private hands, a develop­ment greeted with cautious optimism by a handful of the team's fans on Saturday. 
Fans said they'd welcome a return to indi­vidual ownership if it also meant a returning to winning. 
When media magnate Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. bought the Dodgers from Peter O'Malley in 1998, the team hadn't won a post­season playoff game in 10 years. When it was announced Friday that News. Corp. reached an agreement to sell the team to Boston real estate developer Frank McCourt, the Dodgers hadn't won a postseason game in 15 years. 
Spring style flows in France 

McCartney, Valentino, Saint Laurent, Vuitton, Ford unveil spring fashions 
Associated Press 
PARIS Stella McCartney has an answer for an uneasy world: Go light. 
Presenting her spring­summer ready-to-wear col­lection Sunday, the British designer dazzled fans with cool, airy styles of chiffon or cotton voile in soothing, dulled-down colors. 
The wispy dresses in earthy greens were long off the hip, creating a flapping, flowing movement with the models' every step. A ballet dancer would feel at home in these outfits.

Mental patients killed in hospital fire 
Associated Press 

MINSK -A fire believed to have been set by a psychiatric patient engulfed a Belarusian mental hospital Sunday. killing 30 patients and reduc­ing much of the century-old wooden building to ash. 
One of the 62 patients who lived at the hospital in the vil­lage of Randilovshchina, some 150 miles west of the capital, Minsk, was missing. Emergency officials said they did not know whether he ran away or died in the pre-dawn blaze. 
Another 31 patients had minor injuries, officials said. No hospital staff were in the building when the fire started. 
A spokeswoman for President Alexa.nder Lukashenko, Natalya Petkevich, said the fire was set by a patient who had tried to burn down the building twice before. The patient was among those killed. 
But Igor Zaremba, a duty officer at the Emergency Situations Ministry, said inves­tigators were also considering a second possibility -that the fire resulted from careless­ness on the part of the staff. 
A nurse and an orderly were sleeping in a separate build­ing on hospital grounds when the fire broke out, Zarembo said. When they awoke to screams and the smell of smoke. they apparently pan­icked and tried to put out the fire and rescue patients them­selves, instead of immediately calling for help. 
"As a result of such poorly thought-out actions, by the time emergency personnel arrived, one of the hospital's wings was completely engulfed in flames and the roof and ceiling had col­lapsed," Emergency Situations Minister Valery Astapov told Belarusian television. 
The patients were men and women aged 30 to 60, deemed unable to function independ­ently and whose relatives refused to care for them. They all lived in the one-story wooden building, constructed in 1905 with locked doors and bars on the windows. Zaremba said. He said most 
likely  the  doors  of  the  
patients'  rooms  were  also  
locked.  

The nurse and the orderly unlocked all the doors they could, but some rooms were already cut off by flames, Zaremba said. 
The building was divided into two wings separated by a stone wall, and the wing where the fire began was destroyed, he said. Damage was less severe in the other half. 
Human rights activists said the fire was a result of the dismal state of Belarus' psy­chiatric hospitals, which are poorly funded and largely unreformed since the Soviet era. 
Columbia medical 


center investigated 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -A whistle­blowing veterinarian has entangled Columbia University's prestigious med­ical center in a protracted dis­pute after alleging that baboons and other lab ani­mals suffered from cruel or negligent treatment. 
A year after veterinarian Catherine Dell'Orto com­plained to senior medical cen­ter officials, the case remains very much alive. It is the sub­ject of investigations by two federal agencies, and animal­rights activists are seeking punitive action against the medical center. 
Dell'Orto has left the univer­sity, contending she was shunned after speaking up, but she continues to press her cause. 
Columbia, meanwhile, has implemented reforms based on some of her complaints. but -backed by federal inves­tigators -has concluded that other allegations were base­less. 
The university says one researcher Dell'Orto com­plained about has halted his experiments after receiving threatening e-mail, apparently from one of the veterinarian's supporters. 
"Columbia doesn't claim to be perfect. but we try to be as close as humanly possibly," 
said Dr. Harvey Colten, the medical center's associate dean for research. 
"The extent to which some of these issues have contin­ued, that's distracting," he told The Associated Press. "But in no way do we find it a problem to have the initial complaint raised -we want people to come forward if they think there are problems." 
Dell'Orto. 34, said her con­cerns date to late 2001 when -as a postdoctoral fellow ­she complained to staff at Columbia's Institute of· Comparative Medicine about the treatment of baboons undergoing surgery as part of research into stroke thera­pies. 
For example, she contended that baboons who were oper­ated on -in some cases hav­ing an eyeball removed ­were left afterwards to suffer in their cages rather than being euthanized. 
Dissatisfied with the response, she sifted through records and became con­vinced there were systemic problems of maltreatment, poor record-keeping and other violations of regulations regarding care of lab animals. 
In October 2002, she pre­sented her evidence to med­ical center official, who ordered an in-house investiga­tion and notified the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Bali victims remembered 
Associated Press 

BALI -Weeping relatives gathered Sunday on the first anniversary of the Bali bomb­ings to remember the 202 vic­tims, celebrate life and send a defiant message to terrorists responsible for the worst attack since Sept. 11. 
More than 2,000 people attended the morning service in a cavernous amphitheater on Bali island. The day ended with a moment of silence at 
11:08 p.m., the same time sui­cide bombers blew up the Sari Club and Paddy's bar, killing mostly young foreigners ­including seven Americans. 
Similar memorial services were held in London and across Australia, which lost 88 citizens, the most of any country. In Sydney, several thousand mourners gathered on a wind-swept headland to dedicate a bronze sculpture to the victims. 
Families and friends of many of the 28 British victims of the bombings gathered in London for a memorial serv­ice. In Trafalgar Square, 202 white helium balloons were 
released,  one  for  each  of  
those who died.  
The attack is blamed  on  

Jemaah Islamiyah. a regional terror group linked to al­Qaida and blamed for the August bombing of the J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta that killed 12 
"Yours is a loss that can never be recovered." Australian Prime Minister John Howard said in Bali.· "We haven't forgotten you, we never will. Australia will never forget [Oct. 12, 2002]." 
The service began with 
Christian hymns sung by Australian and Indonesian school children but featured elements of all five major reli­gions. 
Twenty-two candles, repre­senting victims' homelands, were lit and the 202 names were read. The service closed with a rousing rendition of the Australian folk song "Waltzing Matilda" as mourners hugged and placed flowers at a wad­ing pool. 
Relatives -some wearing black armbands saying "Bali United Forever" and others wearing shirts from rugby teams that lost players in the attack -walked past por­traits of the dead as they left the cathedral-like pavilion. 
"It was so sad walking past those photos," said Saari Wedemeyer. a 19-year-old whose friend was killed.

Texas redistricting plan passed 
~ociated Press 
AUSTIN -A six-month bat­
tle in the Texas Legislature 
ended Sunday when the 
Senate passed a congressional 
redistricting plan in a third 
special legislative session. 
The bill now goes to 
Republican Gov. Rick Perry, 
who is expected to sign it into 
Jaw. 
The new map, approved 17­
14 in the Senate, likely will 
give Republicans the majority 
in the Texas congressional del­
egation that is now ruled 17­. 15 by Democrats. 
Democrats have opposed 
every attempt by Republicans 
to pass a new plan, saying the 
current congressional bound­
aries drawn by a court in 2001 
should remain in place. 
Republicans say current voting trends show Texas should have more GOP representation in Washington. 
Rep:tblicans have said they could gain as many as six additional seats in the delega­tion. Democrats said the map would add seven Republicans. 
The bill's passage ends six months of strange twists, including two walkouts by Democrats, three special ses­sions and harsh Republican infighting. 
While the legislative battle over congressional redistrict­ing is over, the feud continues. Democrats have pledged to take their fight to court. 
Republicans were hoping to end the redistricting debate last week, as the House moved swiftly to approve the map Friday. But the Senate held off its vote to wait for the House to approve an unrelated bill to reorganize some parts of state government. 
By the time that bill was eli­gible in the House on Friday, there were not enough state representatives left at the Capitol for a quorum. The House reconvened Sunday and approved· the government reorganization bill, acceding to pressure from the Senate. 
Lt: Gov. David Dewhurst pre­viously said the Senate would not approve the redistricting map until the House passed the reorganization bill. 
"I do not want to be held hostage by the Senate," said Republican state Rep. Carter Casteel, who helped write the measure. "I am sad that I'm standing here today asking you to vote against a bill that I helped author." 


Escaped PA inmate still at large 
Associated Press 
WILKES-BARRE, Pa. -An inmate who escaped down a 60-foot long rope of bedsheets removed a seventh-floor jail window without the aid of any tools, and similar windows are also vulnerable, the warden said Sunday. 
Hugo Selenski, suspected in the murders of five people found buried in his yard, escaped Friday by climbing down a rope assembled from 12 prison-issue bedsheets, Luzerne County .Correctional Facility Warden Gene Fischi said. Selenski remained at large Sunday. 
The escape occurred at about 9:30 p.m., near the end of a two-hour period during which individual cells are unlocked and inmates in the overcrowded maximum secu­rity unit are permitted to socialize. 
Selenski, 30, and cellmate Scott Bolton walked into another inmate's unoccupied cell and removed a window used in a failed 1990 escape. 

IRAQ 

Seventh car borri.bing kills 8 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -Suicide attack­ers struck again Sunday in Iraq, this time with twin car bombs in the heart of Baghdad that fell short of a hotel full of Americans but exploded on a busy commer­cial street, killing six bystanders and wounding dozens, U.S.. military and Iraqi officials said. 
The Pentagon said gunfire from Iraqi guards and U.S. personnel aborted the drivers' plan to hit the Baghdad Hotel, home to officials of the U.S.­led occupation authority here and reportedly some members of Iraq's interim Governing Council. 
At least one guard was reported among the dead; the two bombers also were pre­sumed killed. One member of the 25-seat Governing Council, Mouwafak al-Rabii, told AI~ Jazeera satellite television he suffered a slight hand injury. 
It was the seventh fatal vehi­cle bombing in Iraq since early August, attacks that have taken more than 140 lives. 
All have targeted institutions 

perceived as cooperating with 
the U.S. occupation of Iraq, 
and none has been reported 
solved. 
The lunchtime attack sent 

terror-stricken Iraqis fleeing 
up Saadoun Avenue, over bro­
ken window glass from banks, 
restaurants and shops and 
past the bloodied bodies of 
injured. 
American helicopters and 

combat vehicles converged on 
the chaotic scene as black 
smoke from burning cars bil­
lowed over the central city. 
The six victims and 32 

injured reported at al-Kindi 
Hospital -four in critical con­
dition -were all Iraqis, 
authorities said. 
The U.S. military said three 

Americans were slightly 
injured. 
"We will work with the Iraqi 

·police to find those responsi­ble and bring them to justice," Iraq's U.S. civilian administra­tor, L. Paul Bremer, said after Sunday's bombing. 
But along Saadoun Avenue, feelings ran high against the Americans and their inability to stop the bombings. 




THE OBSERVER 



Celebrating genocide under the Dome 
Early in the morning, Oct. 12, 1492, a sailor aboard the Pinta glimpsed land in the distance -it was Guanahanf, a Bahamian island. The next day, Christopher Columbus' crew of 90 set foot on the its soil. Rechristening it San BJ Strew Salvador and claim­ing it for Spain, he concluded their voy­

that August. The rest, as they say, is history. 
This is how the pretty version goes. And, like Congress, unfortunately, Notre Dame seems to support it. In particular, this off-putting vignette adorns a hallway in the Main Building: prostrate Taino receiving Columbus. Is this right? Does this man deserve his glorified place under our beloved Dome, let alone his own holi­day? 
The "discovery" of the rest of the world is something worth celebrating, I sup­pose. This is something I have to take issue with for a couple reasons. For example: Can complex cultures of mil­lions of people be "discovered?" Isn't that claim both racist and Eurocentric? And, that question aside, what about the archaeological evidence in Newfoundland of 11th-century Nordic settlements? Or British fisherman on the Canadian shores? 
At least he proved the world was round, right? Nope. The Egyptian-Greek scientist Erastosthenes measured the cir­cumference and diameter of the world in the third century B.C. Arab scientists had pioneered a whole discipline of geogra­phy and measurement, and in the 10th century A.D., AI Maqdisi described the earth with 360 degrees of longitude and 180 degrees of latitude. The Monastery of St. Catherine in the Sinai still has an icon -painted 500 years before Columbus ­which shows Jesus ruling over a spheri­cal earth. 
But we stick with the romanticized, ten­uous "official" line, however: we just pre­tend that Columbus was the first. Who wants to rock the boat? After all, without Columbus, surely Europe would never have found the other hemisphere. It would have escaped "civilization" at the hands of the Spaniards. The natives, needless to say, would have preferred this. 
Nevertheless, conquerors care little for the preferences ofthe soon-to-be con­quered. Upon meeting the peaceful, obliging Taino, Columbus wrote in his journal: "With 50 men we could subju­gate them all and make them do whatev­er we want." Not exactly a model Christian. 
It's estimated that within a few years of the Europeans' arrival, three-fourths of the native population perished. How? 
First, there was murder. On Columbus second voyage, he demanded tribute from the Taino. All were expected to yield a certain quantity of gold per capita, or 25 pounds of cot­ton. Many who produced nei­ther were bru­tally murdered, their hands were cut off and they were left to bleed to death. Kidnapping, torture and rape were the order of the day. In fact, many Taino were hunted for sport. 
Second, there was disease. The Taino were prone to European diseases, espe­cially smallpox. They spread like wildfire, ravaging the native population. 
Third, there was slave export. Directly after his so-called discovery, he took natives as slaves, seizing 1,200 from the island of Hispaniola. They were paraded naked through the streets of Seville, then sold as slaves in 1495. Columbus blazed the trail for slavery in the Americas. It was after there weren't any natives left that the Europeans turned to Africa. 
By 1555, from murder, disease and slave export, the Taino were all but eradi­cated. 
Not surprisingly, many are reminded by this of the Holocaust. But unlike the Holocaust, where an estimated two-thirds of European Jews were killed, this geno­cide was total. And not only were the Taino entirely eradicated, but nearly all cultural traces were, as well. 
What were Columbus' intentions? Each one is based on greed and glory. He sought a quicker route to Asia for spice merchants-trade was priority, then as now. He sought the one-tenth ofthe rich­es promised to him by Queen Isabella. He sought to forcibly convert them to Christianity. 
We live in an era where imperialism and genocide still haunt the world. Columbus serves as such a perfect sym­bol of the two. And the legacy of 
Columbus is still felt today. In the richest country in the world, the poorest ethnic group is the Native Americans. It's unclear why the University is so bent on 
exalting him, a man so inept that he was replaced and arrest­ed in 1495. Does the administration plan on putting up some Himmler murals? 
Would President Malloy offer himself as the model, as President Walsh did for the Columbus muralist, Luigi Gregori? Of course not. The apotheosis of 

Columbus should by now have become an embarrassing cultural relic. But some­how it has persisted. The University needs to show real moral clarity, to do its part in ending this curious secular mythology, this practice of honoring one of history's most dishonorable figures. 
The prospect of moving Columbus Day to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November-to honor democracy instead of empire -and renaming it Election Day is pretty remote. But start­ing small, acting locally. isn't. Doing away with the offensive Columbus murals would be a fine start.

Marketing for men's retreat misleads 
I wanted to publicly comment on ··The Man's Weekend," the male-only retreat held this weekend. While I admire many peo­ple involved in the planning and organization, and respect and support the choice to have a male-only retreat, I am greatly disturbed by the publicity for this event. 
I was unaware that being a true male required having pig roasts and liking football. Dovetailing off of some of your pub­licity stunts, Jesus defmitely would not participate in a pig roast, for obvious reasons, and I cannot say that the violent nature of football, a sport that I, myself, often enjoy, is some­thing that Christ would have necessarily supported. 
But all kidding aside, I am surprised that characters like James Bond, the Godfather and Homer Simpson were dis­played on the Web site for this event, presumably representing "true men." 
I know that there are many things men need to discuss in terms of their spirituality, especially with relation to their sex. But I don't think that those issues are best modeled by people who are proud womanizers or violently murder other~. Moreover, I was not aware that being deeply spiritual or attending retreats traditionally implied a questionable mascu­line identity. 
I hope that this event is successful, but not simply in terms of numbers of attendees. I pray that the true meaning and impor­tance of being a Catholic male is addressed, which means fol­lowing Christ's example of humility, service and respect for all people -not just porkeaters.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 




Church-state separation misunderstood 
I think that few of the founding principles of this country are as misunderstood as that of separation of church and state. According to today's main­stream liberal interpretation, this article of our Constitution is translated to mean that the state cannot be influenced by the religious convictions of its constituents. 
This obviously cannot be the idea upon which our Constitution was founded. The preamble to the Declaration of Independence specifically states that our rights ar.e inalienable pre­cisely because God cre­ated us and endowed them to us. Similarly, our political system requires people to take oaths of office which call upon God to help them fulfill there civic duties. Even our currency bears witness to the role God played in forming our country. 
Rather, I would contend that the First Amendment is an attempt to protect religion from govern­ment intervention. 

It states, "Congress shall make no law respect­ing an establishment of reli­gion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." While we may not pass a law that institutionalizes a particular religion so as to prefer a particular creed in the civic arena, we may also not prohibit the free exercise of religion. 
In fact, exercising one's civic duties can and indeed should include attempting to influence civic law according to the moral code which one holds as a result of their religious beliefs. This is the heart of our right to suffrage. 
As soon as heads of state claim religious authori­ty, this amendment is violated. However, this article does not exclude our political leaders from being deeply religious individuals who attempt to govern according to God's will. Indeed, their right to do so 
is expressly protected under the First Amendment. 
The idea that one can encapsulate their religious beliefs and insulate the rest of the world from them is ridiculous for anyone to honestly purport. A per­son's beliefs inevitably influence their philosophy, 
how they choose to live their life and how they vote. Attempts to remove references to God from our civic lives would not 
constitute the separation of church and state; rather, it would be the indoctrination of atheism, a religion unto itself. We must not be ashamed of the Gospel, and I am afraid that a 
liberal interpretation of the First Amendment 
encourages just that: people being ashamed of being Catholic. We can­not use the First Amendment as a scapegoat; it does not give license for 
cowardice or for dissension within the Church. Active evangelization of the 
world in a natural way, through the ordi­nary lives that we lead, 
is a necessary character­istic of a disciple of Jesus. A true love for Christ natu­
rally permeates the lives of his disciples. Consequently, Christianity requires us to live out our 
beliefs, not to hide them. From prayer at meals, to supporting the sanctity of marriage and of life, we cannot claim to be disciples of Jesus and not follow his Church. 
I guess it comes down to a simple .question: If someone made the claim that you were a Catholic Christian. would there be any evidence to back it up?

Does diversity exist among Domers? 
Let's promote diversity! I would like to personally 
give a shout-out to all the admissions people and 
applaud you for your promotion of diversity on this 
campus. Class of 2007, you are the most diverse 
group to ever walk the hallowed halls of our presti­
gious University. Not only that, but apparently you 
are the most intelligent as well (even though they say 
that EVERY year). Boy, oh boy. What an exciting era 
we live in. 

Some people would say unto us that our campus is 
not diverse. I would say unto them, "Look around 
you. Don't you see that every single student is 
unique? We may be 75 percent Caucasian/non­
Hispanic, but some people have different hair colors. 
Don't you understand that although an average of 80 
percent of each incoming class participated in varsity 
athletics, some played different sports? How can 
people claim that our institution is anything but 
diverse? Just because we have more Mikes, Matts, 
and Katies per square foot than any school in the 
United States, maybe even the world, doesn't change 
the fact that we are diverse! Notre Dame even spells 
diversity, of course, if you add a 's' and 'i' and a 'v,' 
and then take away the 'o' and the 'm' and the 'a,' 
but you get the point." 
We promote diversity! Although "alternative lifestyles" aren't accepted, that doesn't mean they don't exist. Sure, we don't recognize them officially, but sometimes we let them advertise in The Observer. Besides, alternative lifestyles happen all the time here. Every single day I see people alternat­ing between working out at Rolfs and the Rock. You see diversity is so much more than ethnicity or cul­tural heritage. We have tall people, short people and even in-between people. We have both squirrels AND chipmunks; geese AND ducks; rain AND snow. And if I am not mistaken, DeBartolo is definitely not an Irish last name, is it? 
We are so diverse that even our diversity is diverse. Not everyone that comes to this school is from Chicago or Ohio, for instance. I, personally, am from the great state of North Carolina. You see; even I add to our diversity. Hey, not everyone is pre-med either. OK, so maybe the freshman class has a dispropor­tionate amount of pre-med majors, but that will change. They still have time. I mean, who wants to walk around the lakes the first weekend with a lowly art major after parietals have broken up all the dorm parties? If you are going to marry the first person with whom you frolic on dark scary paths, late at night, while still buzzed from excessive warm Natty­Light consumption, you might as well aim high. 
I am proud of our diversity. The University is even finding new, exciting ways to make us even more so. (Note to self: University and diversity rhyme.) If smoking is banned from campus, for instance, then people will have to choose between Nicorette and the Patch, yet another example of diversity. I am more of a gum person myself, but someone else may need that 24-hour protection the patch provides. Even the new alcohol policy promotes diversity. OK, so not really, but I am sure if you think hard enough you could pretend it did. 
Let's join our diversely-shaped hands with those of our administration and promote even more diversity. Every single person on this campus, from the faculty, to the staff, to the students, to Monk Malloy himself, has a different set of fingerprints. Nowhere else but Notre Dame will you find a more diverse student body of individuals who all played diverse sports, are members of a diverse range of clubs and service organizations and come from such a diverse range of upper-middle class suburban backgrounds. Hey, even our GPAs in high school were diverse. Some people made 4.00s, and some 3.99s, and if schools used weighted GPAs, then even more diversity exists fhan previously thought. 
Hurrah for Notre Dame! Hurrah for you! Hurrah for me! Hurrah for diversity!

After spending far too much time with a certain group of people, the phrase, "Yeah, college" has evolved and become a signifi­cant part of my vocabu­lary. At

first it was just some­thing that was said in jest, but it has 


become the sym­bol of some of the craziness that is allowed and expected to be made during these four, or in some people's cases, seven, years of sweet, sweet independence. 
The Webster's Dictionary defines college as an "organized body of persons 
·with shared functions and privileges." The question, then, is what those shared functions and privileges are. Logic would tell us that it is sup­

Junior Mike Panzica said, "College is drinking beer in your boxers in the street at 6 a.m. before football games like Pat Gallagher. It is striving everyday to be on the same level of beastliness as Tom Degnan." That is interest­ing. but more important, on point. 
Tom Degnan, in response, said. "College is." 
I look at my brother and his friends who graduated here three years ago and know they would give any­thing to be back in our shoes. I don't really realize how lucky we are until I see how desperately they want to be here. You can see it when they return, aged and tired from the

duplicate college. They're 
hangovers are worse, but 
there desire to relive col­
lege is probably stronger than ever. 
Although our perspec­tives are different at Notre Dame, that is no excuse to act less college. We may replace frat parties and .protests with parietals and prayer, but that does not mean that we cannot have any less of a college expe­rience. If anything, we should realize that we have it all here. A combi­
nation of brains, brawn 
and beer. 
I feel that I should be putting an asterisk next to College when talking about Notre Dame, because the experience here is truly unparalleled. We might not ever make it into the "Best Party School" category and that is fine. In fact, I don't think Notre Dame should be limited to such a cate­gory or designation. That is, until they come out with "Best Overall College."

Drive-Thru Recc 
By MAUREEN BUSH Scene Writer 
There was an invasion Saturday night in Chicago. Popular southern California independent label, Drive-Thru Records sent their "Drive­Thru Invasion Tour" all over the country and the world to expose the masses to both the newer additions to the label and the older, staple bands that Drive-Thru fans have loved for years. It is amazing to see the fierce loyalty that the fans have to a single record label and how those fans were excited to see all five bands that graced the stage in the old Riviera Theatre. 
Promptly at 6 p.m., the lights dimmed as Ace Enders. guitarist and vocalist of The Early November, took the stage alone with only an acoustic guitar in hand. He explained that they were going to start this set a little different than usual because the previous night in Milwaukee bassist, Sergio Anello had knocked him out during the set, giving him a concussion. The pace of the set changed dramatically after Enders played the first song. Joe Marro on guitar, Jeff Krummer on drums, and Anello joined him onstage to blow away the crowd with their powerful melodies. 
Despite the fact that some fans had only heard a few songs from their new album, "The Room's Too Cold," which was released Oct. 7, many were continually impressed during their six-song set. Enders stated during the show that this was the band's 

Music fans in Chicago pack the 
first time in Chicago, but you wouldn't have been able to tell from the crowd participa­tion and the raw energy com­ing from the stage. They decided to slow it down again as they played "Sunday Drive" as the fourth song in their set. 
The Early November fin­ished up with some surprise guests. When they were play­ing a new song off of their new album, Kenny Vasoli of The Starting Line rushed onto the stage to sing with the band. Then, during their last song Adam Lohrbach of Home Grown joined in the mix to help finish up a great set. 
The second band of the night was Senses Fail, a young New Jersey band whose members were between 16 and 21 years old. Senses Fail is made up of Buddy Nielsen on lead vocals, Dave Miller on guitar and vocals, Garrett Zablocki on guitar and vocals, Mike Glita on bass and vocals and Dan Trapp on drums. This band roared onto the stage and ripped through their set as Nielsen held the crowd in the palm of his hand by jumping out onto the guard rail and leaning close to the fans sev­eral times. 

This was the most heavy and hardcore band of the night as they kept the crowd jumping and screaming along with vocalists. The highlights of the set were fan-favorites, "Stephen" and "One Eight Seven," and their first single, "Freefall Without A Parachute." For being so young, Senses Fail has a very mature style of what sounds like a good cross between hardcore and punk rock and I am excited to see what they will do in the future. 
Next on the bill were the old men of the night, Home Grown, an Orange County­based band that has been together for seven years. Adam Lohrbach, bass and vocals, and his band made up of Darren Reynolds, John Tran, and Dan Hammond came out and entertained the crowd with several songs off of their last release humor­ously titled, "Kings of Pop." With their fast and furious playing and their catchy lyrics, this punk band did not disappoint. Among the songs they played were "Kiss Me," "Diss Me," "Give It Up," "Second Best," and personal favorite, "I Love You, NOT!" where Tran proudly states, "I think you're hot but I love you not!" 
As far as maturity goes, this band is lacking in all the right areas because they were able to keep the crowd j urn ping along to the fast pace of their songs. Though this is a band that has not gained the popu­larity of some of their label­mates, Home Grown reminded me why I listened to them in the past and why others should listen to them in the future. 
After a short delay, Chicago­based Allister took the stage clad in dress shirts and ties to the delight of the hometown crowd. They immediately broke out into "Radio Player," a good fast-paced song to open their set. It was obvious that a significant portion of the crowd was there to see Allister who is made up of Tim Allister on guitar and vocals, Scott Murphy on bass and vocals, Mike Leverence on drums and Kyle Lewis on

re old Riviera Theatre as southern California bands invade 
guitar. The band played catchy tunes from their latest release, "Last Stop Suburbia" such as "Overrated" and "Scratch" and dug into their history playing old favorite, "Moper." After informing the crowd that the Cubs were winning 6-0, the band stated that they would be going into the studio to record a new album. They then played a new song called "Rewind" and were joined onstage by one of their many former members to assist in singing. 
This was a trend during the Allister set as they started into their last two songs of the night there was continued side-stage participation. During the punchy "None of My Friends Are Punks," two members of the road crew ran around the stage dancing and singing. That led up to the last song of the night for them, "Somewhere On Fullerton," which is their most popular song thus far. The crowd went nuts and so did the stage, as it seemed that everyone who was on the side came running out to sing and dance to the song that many Chicago kids can relate to about a punk-rock venue on Fullerton Street where they would frequent concerts growing up. 
The final act of the night 
·was The Startling Line who entered the stage to a piano arrangement, which they began to soup up by playing their instruments along with the recording. A banner dropped bearing their name as they started into "Given the Chance," which is a song about how happy this band is to have been given the chance to follow their dreams. This energetic Pennsylvania based quartet made up of Kenny Vasoli · on bass and lead vocals, Matt Watts on guitar, Mike Golla on guitar and vocals and Tom Grysckiewicz on drums, has taken the pop­punk world by storm. invad­ing not only the Riviera stage that night but also radio and television spots nationally. 
They kept the pace up by aggressively playing "Hello Houston," and then older song, "Three's a Charm." They played almost every song off of their latest release, "Say It Like You Mean It" and slowed it down with "Make Yourself At Home," from the unreleased EP, which shares the same name. 
The highlight of the show was the catchy "Left Coast Envy." They finished up their set by informing the crowd they would be leaving for to record a new al]Jum which they are hoping will be released early next year and playing their radio hit, "Best of Me" as a shower of confetti fell from the rafters. 
After leaving the stage for a shade under a minute the band returned as Vasoli stat­ed, "Now that we're done with the work it's time to party!" He then had the crowd sing the new Justin Timberlake song, "Senorita," splitting up the girls and the guys to sing their own respective parts mimicking exactly how Timberlake does in the song. After stating that was "the best crowd participation we've had yet," The Starting Line began their encore con­tinuing the R&B turned punk theme with "I'm Real," a cover song written by J-Lo and Ja Rule, which can be Though they had the right bands because they all seem found on the "Pop Goes Punk" idea with this concert, it to get along very well, each music compilation, and fin­would have been better band plugging the others ished with the last song from served to have a stage on throughout the sets vocally their album, "This Ride."

NFL 
Chiefs overcome 17-point deficit for the win 
Associated Press 
GREEN BAY, Wis. -For once, 
the Kansas City Chiefs' wild fin­
ish didn't involve Dante Hall. 
Even with their star kick returner being kept out of the end zone for the first time in a month, the Chiefs overcame a 17 -point fourth-quarter deficit to force overtime, then came out on top after a crazy closing sequence to beat the Packers 40-34 at Lambeau Field. 
Here were the final three plays of the game. one right after the other: 
1. 
Cletidus Hunt blocked Morten Andersen's 48-yard field goal attempt with 9:09 left in OT to give the Packers (3-3) possession at their 39 and the wind at their back. 

2. 
On first down, Packers run­ning back Ahman Green -who ran 26 times for 139 yards ­fumbled the ball, and Kansas City recovered. 

3. 
Chiefs quarterback Trent Green threw a 51-yard touch­down pass to Eddie Kennison with 8:42 left in the extra peri­od. 


Simple as that, Kansas City improved to 6-0. 
"First off, it doesn't tell me anything I didn't already know. There's a special profile about this team," Chiefs coach Dick Vermeil said. "At no time on our sideline did anyone think we'd lost this football game." 
Free safety Jerome Woods, who had a 79-yard touchdown interception return in the fourth quarter, knocked the ball loose from Ahman Green. It bounced right into the hands of line­backer Mike Maslowski. Panthers 23, Colts 20 (OT) 
Stephen Davis gave the Carolina Panthers a running start Sunday, then DeShaun Foster took over. 
The Panthers' tag-team run­ning attack bowled over Indianapolis defenders, broke tackles and eventually set up a 4 7 -yard winning field goal from John Kasay to keep the Panthers unbeaten with a 23-20 overtime win. 
"Coach let me know Stephen was down and it was going to be on my shoulders," Foster said. "I just tried to go out there and make the most of my opportunity." 
The Panthers (5-0) have now won seven straight dating to last season and are one of three remaining unbeaten teams in the NFL. The others are Kansas City (6-0) and Minnesota (5-0). 
But this win was atypical for Carolina. 
Just six days after Peyton Manning miraculously rallied the Colts (5-1) from a 21-point deficit in the final four minutes at Tampa Bay. he nearly did it again. 
Manning led the Colts on an improbable 91-yard, game-
tying drive in the final three 
minutes against another one of 
the NFL's best defenses -but 
he never got a chance to win it. 
To compound the Panthers' problems, Davis, the NFC's leading rusher, watched most of the final 21 minutes with a bruised arm. He finished with 76 yards rushing, his first sub­1 00-yard game since joining the Panthers and a dramatic drop­off from last week's 159-yard effort. 
Broncos 17, Steelers 14 
The defense gave the Denver Broncos a chance to win. Jason Elam took advantage. 
Elam hit a 4 7 -yard field goal on the final play of the game to lift Denver past Pittsburgh 17­14, the Steelers' third straight loss. 
"It wasn't a pretty game, but we didn't expect it to be pretty," Broncos defensive tackle Bert Berry said. "We knew it was going to be a battle, and there wouldn't be a moment where we could have a letdown." 
Denver {5-1)' rebounded from last week's loss to Kansas City and came out on top of a tight game between the AFC's top two defenses. 
Pittsburgh {2-4) tied it at 14­all on Jerome Bettis' 1-yard dive and an improbable 2-point conversion, but the Broncos got the ball back at their 20 with 
2:41 left. 
Steve Beuerlein struggled in place of injured starter Jake Plummer, but was 5-for-8 for 44 yards on the final drive. He also got a break when Pittsburgh safety Brent Alexander dropped an interception at the Steelers' 20 with 44 seconds left. 
Ravens 26, Cardinals 18 
Arizona's Jeff Blake wanted badly to show the Baltimore Ravens what they're missing. 
Instead, he threw three inter­ceptions on the wrong side of a typical Ravens victory: No touchdowns for the Baltimore offense, big plays by the defense and one crucial touchdown via special teams. 
Blake was intercepted twice by Chris McAlister, who returned the second one 83 yards for a touchdown. Ed Reed, who had the other pick, blocked a punt and returned it 20 yards for the other Ravens' TO in a 26-18 win over the Cardinals. 
"That's the way the game is, you know," Blake said. "Two plays can make you or break you." 
Jamal Lewis set a franchise record with his fourth consecu­tive 100-yard rushing game. The NFL's powerful leading rusher gained 131 yards in 21 carries. The Ravens got a scare when Lewis bruised right shoul­der and went into the locker room for X-rays in the second half. They were negative and he returned to the game.

234-5650 
"It was all right," Lewis said. "It was just a little hurt." 
Blake completed 22 of 36 for 24 7 yards and two touchdowns, but was done in by the intercep­tions, the third by Reed. Baltimore had no turnovers, so Arizona is minus-14 in turnover margin, by far the worst in the NFL. 
Browns 13, Raiders 7 
The Cleveland Browns can always count on kicker Phil Dawson's right leg. 
On Sunday, they needed his left one, too. 
Dawson scampered 14 yards on a fake field goal to set up William Green's go-ahead touchdown run in a rare and ugly home win for the Browns, 13-7 over the penalty-prone Oakland Raiders. 
"Dawson looked like that guy Forrest Gump," said Browns defensive end Kenard Lang. "I was gonna yell, 'Run, Forrest, run.' He didn't look all that pretty running, but the result was beautiful, man." 
Not only did his run -if you want to call it that -catch the Raiders completely ofT guard, it even surprised Dawson, who isn't looking forward to his next one. 
"I tried to change directions, but my belly was carrying me out of bounds," Dawson said. "But if you're wearing a helmet, and they tell you to run, you run." 
Green ran right through Raider AbomiNation, picking up 145 yards as the Browns (3-3) won for the first time in three tries at home this season. 
Cleveland is just 10-2 5 in 


front of its own fans since the Browns' NFL rebirth in 1999. 
Saints 20, Bears 13 
The New Orleans Saints final­ly found a team they could beat. 
Aaron Brooks threw two touchdown passes against one of the NFL's worst defenses to lead the Saints to a 20-13 victo­ry over the Chicago Bears on Sunday. 
Brooks connected with Joe Horn on a 6-yard scoring pass with 7:18 left for the clinching score as the Saints won for the second time in six games. The Bears fell to 1-4. 

After playing the league's toughest schedule in the first five games _ against opponents who combined for a 17-5 record _New Orleans didn't look great in managing just -283 total yards. But it was enough to turn back the Bears. 
The Bears, ranked 28th on defense and 32nd and last on offense, scOl'ed their only touch­down -a 4-yard pass from Kordell Stewart to Dez White with 2:10 left in the game. 
Before that they had two field goals from Paul Edinger -a 28-yarder in the second quarter and a 31-yarder in the fourth. 
Stewart, who had three fum­bles and was sacked three times, was 10 of 21 for 152 yards. Anthony Thomas, coming off back-to-hack 100-yard out­ings, had 96 yards on 21 car­ries.

Klatt's two goals in Kings' win over Blackhawks 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO -Trent Klatt does­n't score goals too often. 
On .Sunday night, he scored

I 
Angeles Kings to a 4-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks. 
Klatt, who has 129 goals in 703 NHL games, gave the Kings a 3-0 lead with his two goals in a 33-second span and help them win their second straight game. 
Klatt, who signed as a free agent from Vancouver in the offseason, usually spends his time along the boards getting the puck to his linemate Luc Robtaille. 
"It's pretty simple," Klatt said. "I just go to the net hard and do the work in the corners. It's paying off right now. 
"You certainly don't have a guy like myself out in the slot, that's Luc's job," he added. "Derek [Armstrong] and myself we can go in an win some bat­tles in the corner and we try to get the puck to Luc in the slot." 
I I 'Klatt, who had 16 goals last 
I 
season with the Canucks, already has three this year. 
l. 
The Kings' Lubomir Visnovsky 
l scored a power-play goal in the first period and Jaroslav Madry added an insurance goal with 
3:31 left in the third. 

Los Angeles concluded a sea­son-opening, three-game road trip at 2-1-0. 
"We certainly should have had points in all three games,"
, 
\ Kings coach Andy Murray said, "but I'd rather be going back with four points than without any." 

Chicago's Mark Bell and Kyle Calder scored power-play goals to cut the score to 3-2, but Chicago dropped its second straight. 
Los Angeles goaltender Roman Cechmanek stopped 32 shots, including 14 of 15 in the third period. Chicago's Jocelyn Thibault made 22 saves, includ­ing one on a penalty shot by Esa Pirnes in the second period. 
"We've been working hard, but we're having a little bit of trouble defensively in our end," Thiabult said. ··we have to get better at that." 
Chicago coach Brian Sutter was more direct about his team's defensive coverage. 
"On [Los Angeles'] second, third and fourth goals. we were beat out of the corner down low," Sutter said. "We were beaten in areas we have to take pride in. 
"Obviously, we didn't take enough pride in them. We 
played a team that battled hard." 
Visnovsky opened the scoring with 3:40 left in the first period with five seconds remaining on a Kings power play. He beat Thibault with a slap shot from the top of the slot. 
Klatt made it 2-0 with his first goal, at 8:33 of the second. 
Tim Gleason's shot from the point hit traffic and bounced to Bell in the slot. Bell lost his foot­ing and the puck squirted to Klatt, who cut to the net and tucked a shot past Thibault. 
Klatt increased the lead 33 seconds later, tipping in a loose puck in the crease after Robitaille's low shot from the point trickled between Thibault's legs and toward the goal line. 
Pirnes was awarded the penalty shot after Alexander Karpovtsev pulled him down on a breakaway at 10:17 of the second period. 
Bell cut it to 3-1 at 11:21 of the second on the power play. He deflected in Karpovtsev's perfect feed from the top of the slot. 
Thibault stopped Zigmund Palffy's short-handed break­away attempt 52 seconds into the third. 
Calder cut it to 3-2 with a power-play goal at 4:50 of the third. After a goalmouth pile up, Calder took on a loose puck and fired it over Cechmanek, who had sprawled to make an initial save. 
Modry completed the scoring with 3:31 left .in regulation. He connected from the left circle after taking a pass from Alexander Frolov behind the net. 
Coyotes 2, Mighty Ducks 0 
Ladislav Nagy scored in the first period, and goaltender Sean Burke made that stand up as the Phoenix Coyotes beat the Anaheim Mighty Ducks 2-0. 
The loss in their home opener dropped the Ducks, who came within one game of winning the Stanley Cup last season, to 0-3. 
Nagy scored on a power play at 9:27 of the opening period, his first goal and second point in the Coyotes' two games. Daymond Langkow added an empty-net goal with five sec­onds remaining. 
Burke stopped 31 shots to earn the 34th save of his career, thwarting the Ducks on five power plays. 
Skating down the right side, Nagy took a cross-ice pass from Mike Johnson, bore down on Jean-Sebastien Giguere and wristed a shot over the goal­

Giguere had positioned him­self near the left post, and Nagy was able to thread the puck through a small opening above the goalie's glove. 
The Ducks' goalie faced 28 shots. 
A sensation in the playoffs, Giguere has allowed eight goals in the Ducks' three losses to open the season. He signed a four-year contract for about $20 million with the team last month. 
Sergei Fedorov, signed to a five-year, $40 million contract after Paul Kariya left for Colorado, has yet to score for the Ducks.

Irish make return to Stonebridge Invite 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame men's golf team will be in action today at the 2003 Stonebridge Invitational, hosted by Southern Methodist University. 
The Irish played in the 2002 . Stonebridge Invitational and placed fifth with a score of 873 (289­295-289). The 54-hole tour­nament will be held at the par 72, 7,247-yard Dye Course at Stonebridge Country Club in McKinney, Texas. 
The Irish are coming off a 15th-place tie (with Southern Methodist) at the Windon Memorial Classic in Glenview. Ill. The 17 -team field included eight of the top 50 teams in the nation,

Salas upsets No. 29 Hollands 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame senior co-captain Alicia Salas, ranked 63rd nationally in singles, continued her run as a giant killer by upsetting No. 29 Dianne Hollands of Arizona in consola­tion action Friday in the Riviera/ITA Women's All­American Championships, the first leg of the collegiate tennis grand slam. 
Salas then fell to No. 7 Daria Panova of Oregon to be elimi­nated from the tournament. Salas and the rest of the Irish women's tennis team will return to action Friday in an exhibition· match against rival USC in the Eck Tennis Pavilion. Action is tentatively slated to begin at 4 p.m. 
Salas posted her fourth win over a ranked opponent in four days by topping Hollands 6-4, 6­

set before fighting back to win 
six consecutive games. The 
Wildcat is the highest-ranked 
opponent ever to fall victim to 
Salas. 
"Alicia did an unbelievable job of covering the court," Irish head coach Jay Louderback said. "She was really aggressive, and I was really impressed with her speed. She really tracked down a lot of balls." 
In the afternoon match, Panova, the tournament's sixth seed, pulled out a close match 6­4, 7-6 (7-5). Salas jumped out to a 4-1 lead in the second set, but could not force a third frame. 
"It was really a great tourna­ment for Alicia," Louderback said. "She played very well and beat some really good players." 
Salas is 6-3 on the young sea­son, with the losses coming to players ranked Nos. 7. 8 and 27 nationa-lly. She now has 11 career victories over ranked opponents. 
Prior to this tournament, Salas' highest-ranked victim was No. 54 Melissa Applebaum "of Miami in the Big East final a

In qualifying, she beat No. 85 Ashley Schellhas of Vanderbilt 6-4, 3-6, 6-0 and No. 33 Alix Lacelarie of Clemson 6-1, 6-0 on Tuesday before defeating No. 39 Megan Muth of William & Mary 6-4, 6-3 in Wednesday's qualify­ing round. On Thursday, Salas lost 6-4, 6-0 to No. 27 Tammy Encina of Tennessee in the opening round of the main draw. 
Salas was the first Notre Dame player to reach the 32­player main draw of the All­American Championships since current Irish assistant coach Michelle Dasso advanced to the quarterfinals of the tournament as a senior in 2000.

By PAT LEONARD 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's cross country team came out in full force on Friday and took it to the 25-team field of the 5,000-meter Benedictine University Eagle Invitational. 
Six Belles runners finished in the top 50 as Saint Mary's placed fourth overall and proved its improvement since the season's opener at the Heidelberg Invitational in Ohio. 
Senior Jackie Bauters led the way for the Belles for the fifth time in six meets, posting a time of 19:52 and finishing 17th over­all. 
The finish was the second highest of Bauters' final season, the best finish coming in the first meet when she came in 13th. 
Heidi Saunders of Goshen College was the overall winner with a time of 19:18.9. 
Only Northern Illinois (27). Goshen (79) and St. Joseph's 
(118) placed higher than the Belles. 
Saint Mary's freshmen Sara Otto (20:06.8) and Erin Nolan (20:06.8). junior Elizabeth Commers (20:28.5). freshman Katie White (20:39.3) and sopho­more Becky Feauto (20:46.0) functioned as more than just a supporting cast to Bauters' strong fmish. 
Saint Mary's narrowed the time difference between its first runner (Bauters) and fifth run­ner (White) to 49 seconds. This statistic is an accurate measure of the success or failure of a team. With all runners healthy and clicking, the Belles seem primed to take this momentum and use it to their advantage in the MIAA Championships Nov. 1 at Albion College.

Globke gave the Irish a lead with his second goal of the peri­od with about three minutes remaining. With the two teams playing four-on-four, Irish defenseman Tom Galvin sent Globke a perfect pass, allowing the forward to beat Caruso with

just four minutes into the second period when Walsh gave up a rebound goal to Paul Caponigri. Globke would reclaim the Irish lead seven minutes later on the power play. 
Notre Dame added insurance goals in the third period from forwards Aaron Gill and Cory McLean. Walsh made 31 saves in the game. 
"Rory's a battler," Poulin said. "He didn't get in any games last year, but he worked hard in practice and his conditioning this season was outstanding coming in. 
"He really battled tonight and made some big saves when it was a one-goal game." 
The Buckeyes changed goalies for Saturday's game, electing to start senior Mike Betz instead of Caruso. Betz has never lost to the Irish in his career, and Saturday was no exception as he stopped 29 of 30 shots to improve his record against Notre Dame to 7-0-3. 
Neither team mustered any goals in the first period, combin­ing for only 10 shots. That changed in the second frame, as they combined for 35 shots. It was Ohio State who scored the first goal, when Daymen Bencharski scored on a deflec­tion a little less than three min­utes into the period. 
Notre Dame tied the game less than two minutes later when sophomore forward Tim Wallace scored a rebound goal after Betz stopped the initial shot from' McLean. 
Ohio State's J.B. Bittner put his team ahead for good 11 minutes into the final period, and Dave Steckel scored an insurance goal with a little more than two min­utes left in the game. 
"Ohio State played a little more desperate in the final peri­od and got the two points," Poulin said. "This is one that we have to find a way to win. We lost one of six periods on. the

The late Irish spurt proved futile when Brian Johnson of Rutgers scored an insurance goal at the 80:42 mark. 
"It happens," Clark said of the loss. "We can't read too much into it except to look at the goals and see how we lost them." 
Rutgers now leads the all-
time series with Notre Dame with a 9-3-1 record. The 5-2 victory also marks the Scarlet Knights' sixth straight win over the Irish. 
Notre Dame is 5-2-1 at Alumni field this season, with one home game remaining on Oct. 31 against Villanova. 
The Irish drop to fifth in the Big East conference with its loss to Rutgers. St. John's (5-1­0). Rutgers (4-1-1), Virginia Tech (4-2-0) and Connecticut (3-1-2) have better records heading into the season's homestretch. 
"It is disappointing to lose the game," Clark said. "But the test for us is do we use this as a stepping stone or a stumbling block? I think we have to use this as a stepping stone and get back on the right path on Tuesday. We have six remain­ing g·ames, and they're all tough games." 
Notre Dame's next test comes this Tuesday on the road at non-conference opponent Cleveland State. The Vikings (6­

7) are in the middle of a four­game losing streak after drop­ping a 2-0 decision to Marshall.

The Irish are on fire. 

This weekend saw the No. 15 Irish sweep two Big East foes en route to winning their sixth and seventh straight games. 
Friday's victim was Seton Hall. The Pirates came into the Joyce Center with a 14-6 over­all and 0-3 conference record. However, they were no match for the red-hot Irish. 
Notre Dame hit a scorching .436 en route to the three­game victory (30-2 2, 30-14. 30­25). 
Sunday was much more of the same for the Big East lead­ing Irish. Rutgers (8-11, 2-3) never led in three games as the Irish dominated (30-13, 30-18, 30-22). 
"We've had great practices 
. I all week, and I really think it's paying off for us," head coach Debbie Brown said. "Overall I think were playing really well." 
The Irish have been excellent of late, remaining undefeated in the Big East with a 6-0 start. Against Rutgers, the Irish hit .352 on the match, compared to the Scarlet Knights' meager . 028 hitting percentage. 
Notre Dame's hot hitting of late can be attributed to the switch to a 5-1 rotation. With Kristen Kinder as the Irish's only setter, hitters do not have to adjust to having two setters. Kinder had 39 assists in Sunday's match. 
Meanwhile, sophomore Lauren Brewster has been unstoppable. Sunday. she hit .560 with 16 kills and only two errors. Last week, she was named co-Big East Player of the Week, .and Friday she had 13 kills with no errors, good for 
a .684 hitting percentage. 
"Lauren has been unbeliev­able," Brown said. "I watch other teams, and they have no idea how to stop her." 
Brewster is not the only Irish hitter to get hot of late. as all the middle blockers have stepped up. Lauren Kelbley nailed 10 kills Sunday to go along with her .47 4 hitting per­centage. 
,I 
' i. Blocking has also been anoth­er strength of the Irish as they rejected the Scarlet Knights 15 times at the net, while getting 
stuffed only two times. This has been the trend of late for the

Irish front row.

Robin [Davis] dees almost all of the blocking coaching, and he's really good." 
However, despite the out­standing coaching, Brown also credits her athletes for their blocking prowess. 
"We have players that have the physical ability to be high above the net, and our blockers have gotten better and better -they're smarter." Brown said. 
Even though the Irish kept rolling this weekend, they are looking forward to the week off. 
"Right now is the perfect time for us to have a break, espe­cially because of the academ­ics," Brown said. "Academically, the week before fall break is really tough." 
So, as the Irish take a study break and a few days off, they hope that the momentum con­tinues in their favor, as they are just having fun playing vol­leyball. and that is when they play their best." 
"I think that we worked real­ly hard at being consistent and playing at a higher levei," Brown said. 
Next week, Brown and her team will travel to North Carolina where the Tar Heels will try to cool down the Irish .

Lanced by the Knights 
Rutgers rolls onto Aluinni Field and whips the Irish 5-2. 

By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
The statistics show that the Notre Dame defense has been among the best in the country this season. Rutgers apparently does not concern itself with numbers. 
The Scarlet Knights scored four straight goals to open the ·:<' game and got scores from five

opponent. 

~ 
The loss also toppled an Irish 
~ 
4, ! streak of eight-games without a loss, dating back to a Sept. 6 loss to St. John's. 

Rutgers' four.:.goal spurt caught Notre Dame off-guard, especially because the Irish felt they were not being outplayed up to that point. 
"They had a crazy little spell there," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "I've reviewed the tape, and in a funny way I felt we played fairly well until then. They just had a crazy, inexpli­cable period where we let up some crazy goals. But for any team to have 10 shots and score five goals, that's a very high ratio. That'd be a high ratio in basketball, so it's defi­nitely a high ratio in soccer." 
Rutgers (7-3-1, 4-1-1) capi­talized on early Notre Dame miscues to take a lead it would never relinquish. Ricardo Arenas put the Scarlet Knights on the board first after Irish goalie Chris Sawyer slipped coming out to play a long ball. 
Sawyer had trouble control­ling the next long ball to come his way, a ball that slipped through his hands and onto the feet of Rutgers' Chris Karcz for the Knights' second goal. · 
Rutgers scored twice in the next eight minutes, the last of which came at the 44:17 mark just before the end of the half. 
Notre Dame came out of the locker room firing. Junior defender Kevin Goldthwaite's through-ball to senior forward Justin Detter set up a cross that Martin deflected to make the score 4-1 at 51:54. 
Etherington, a speedy fresh­man, scored 15 minutes later on a headball off a Chad Riley cross at 66:05.

Getting back at the Buckeyes 

The Irish split a pair ofgames with No. 15 Ohio State to garner revenge for their playoff loss to the Buckeyes a year ago 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 

Revenge is a dish best served cold. 
The old adage means that revenge is best after time has passed since the original infrac­tion, but in Notre Dame's case against Ohio State, it could have also referred to the temperature of the ice. 
Notre Dame, who lost to Ohio State in the first round of the CCHA Super Six postseason tournament to end the 2002-03 season, knocked off the Buckeyes on the road 5-2 Friday night. The celebration was short lived, though, as Ohio State came back Saturday night to split the series with a 3-1 win over the Irish.

]ones gains record 262 yards in Notre Dame's upset win over Pittsburgh 
By JOE HETTLER Sports Editor 
PITTSBURGH-Julius Jones had 152 
rushing yards in his first four games 
for Notre Dame this season. He sur­
passed that total in the first three quar­
ters against Pittsburgh Saturday night. 
Jones broke Notre Dame's single­game school rushing record with 262 yards on 24 carries and two touch­downs and the Notre Dame defense recorded eight sacks while hassling Pittsburgh quarterback Rod Rutherford all game, helping the Irish beat No. 16 Pittsburgh 20-14 at Heinz Field. 
The win was Notre Dame's first on 
the road this season and snapped a 
three-game losing streak. 
"I believed in our football team," Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said. "There will always be tough times. I liked our attitude and I liked our approach." 
Ryan Grant added 27 carries and 84 yards as Notre Dame rushed for a sea­son-high 352 yards. It was the most rushing yards for Notre Dame since Aug. 28, 1999 against Kansas. 
"I think our weakest part in the game has been the running," Willingham said. "We wanted to see if we could improve and once we did that, we wanted to continue it." 
Jones ignited the Irish throughout the game with solid runs, while the offen­sive line played well and opened holes for both backs. He had three touch­down runs, all over 25 yards, including a 61-yard scamper in the fourth quar­ter. He surpassed his career-high 149­yard rushing yards in the third quarter. 
"It was a great feeling to get the win and get things on track," Jones said. "Things opened up for us as a whole team. We had a lot to step up to the plate. I give the offensive line all the credit, they gave me some room to run and it was a great game for us." 
Notre Dame's defense was as impres­sive as Jones in holding the nation's eighth-ranked offense to a mere 175 total yards. Larry Fitzgerald, who entered the game averaging 145 yards receiving, had only five catches for 79 yards and two touchdowns in the first half, but was held without a catch in the second half.

PITTSBURGH -Somewhere in South Carolina, Lou Holtz was smiling. 
His immediate successor, former Notre Dame coac.h Bob Davie, certain­ly was after doing the color commen­tary for ESPN 
during Notre Dame's dominant 20-14 victory over No. 16 Pittsburgh Saturday night. 
What they saw would have brought a smile 


to the face of any ·chris Federico 
fan ofclassic Notre Dame foot­ball. 
Although the Sports Writer score didn't indi­cate it, the Irish dominated the Panthers on both sides of the ball, returning to a traditional style of Irish play not seen in a while. 
"I haven't seen that in a long time," said Notre Dame safety Glenn Earl, whose defense also did its part in stymieing a potent Pittsburgh passing attack and limiting the Panthers to 176 yards of total offense. "The offense just ran the ball at will without even throwing a pass for eight min­utes straight. It was just domination." 
The Irish racked up 352 yards rush­ing on the strength of senior Julius Jones' 262-yard, record-breaking day. 
The piece-meal Notre Dame offen­sive line consisting of five first-year starters in Jim Molinaro, Mark LeVoir, Bob Morton, Dan Stevenson and freshman Ryan Harris looked reminis­cent of the over-powering Irish fronl'i of the Holtz days. 
On defense, the Irish played as dom­inantly as some of the grnat unit.-; to come before them, holding a Pittsburgh offense that averaged 38 points a game scoreless in the second half. 
"After every possession, we just came back to the sidelines and said to each other that they cannot hang with us," said defensive end Justin Tuck, who led a tenacious Irish defensive front Saturday with 10 tackles and three and a halfsacks. "That was the first time this year I think we played together as a great defensive line." 
Defensive tackle Darrell Campbell played like a man possessed. The sen­ior did not miss a snap on defense against the Panthers -leading an 
Irish pass rush that kept quar­terback Rod Rutherford and the Pittsburgh offense moving backwards all night. 
''I'm really proud of all those guys. Darrell Campbell never came out ofthe game," Irish 
Although the score didn t indicate it, the Irish dominated the Panthers on both sides ofthe ball, returning to a traditional style ofIrish play not seen in a while. 
defensive line coach Greg Mattison said. "The kids wanted this one bad, and we've been so close. You can't say enough about our players and [head coach] Ty [Willingham) in keeping this team together and believing." 
Cornerback Vontez Duff accepted one of the biggest challenges present­ed to any Irish player this season in nearly single-handedly shutting down Pittsburgh wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald in the second half of the game, preveming the nation's leading receiver from catching a pass aftnr halftime. 
Simply put, this was Notre Dame football like it is supposed to be played. The Irish marched into a ranked opponent's stadium and came away with an impressive victory. 
Somewhere, Knute Rockne is cheer­ing, a..c;; his boys in blue listened to his famous halftime speech one more time: "Sometime, when the team is up against it, and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they got ... " 
Notre Dame did just that Saturday night. Off to a 1-3 start, and with things only looking worse with teams like USC and Florida State on the hori­zon, the Irish needed a dominant per­formance like they got. 
They needed it for all the doubters, to prove that Notre Dame hasn't fallen off the football radar. They needed it for themselves, to show that they still have the talent and ability to win every Saturday. And, most important­ly, they needed it for the program, to show that Notre Dame foot­

ball is still alive and kicking. 
"We said it's important for this foot­ball team to make those that wore the uniform before them proud, and that doesn't change," Willingham said. 
There should be a lot of proud Notre Dame alums after Saturday's victory. Because for just over three hours, the Irish, indeed, returned to the glory days of Notre Dame football.

Jones finally meets expectations 
By JOE HETTLER Sports Editor 
PITTSBURGH Bob Davie knew how crucial Saturday's contest between the Irish and No. 16 Pittsburgh was for Irish running back Julius Jones. Seeing Jones near the entrance gate after break­ing Notre Dante's single­game rushing record, the former Irish coach saluted Jones with a smiJe and gave his former star a hug. 
It was a symbolic gesture of sorts -the man that recruited Jones congratulat­ing him on a night when the senior showed the nation just what he was capable of accompJishing. 
Jones had 262 yards rush­ing en route to breaking Vagas Ferguson's 225-yard game in 1978. Jones also rushed for two touchdowns and was the key in Notre Dame's 20-14 upset of Pittsburgh. 
After being kicked out of school and missing a whole season of footba11 last year, Jones Jinally gave Notre Dame's coaches and fans the kind of game they've been expecting since his freshman year in 1999. 
He ran over, through and around Panther defenders all night. He made the big run when the Irish needed it, and he had several key touchdown sprints. But most importantly, Jones simply embarrassed the Pittsburgh defense by doing what Irish fans have been waiting for since his arrival back to campus in the early fall. 
The extra classes at Arizona State and the rigor­ous training with his broth­er Thomas, a running back for the Tampa Bay Buccanneers, wasn't easy for Jones. But Saturday night's performance made all the sweat and pain in the offseason and year off worth it. 
"It means a Jot, just to be away and have the opportu-nity to come back and go through the things I've gone through," Jones said. "It's a great feeling and I fee] like everything I did paid off." 

In his first four games, Jones had a mere 152 yards and averaged a modest 3.5 yards per carry, struggling since his solid performance against Washington State in the opener: He gained only six yards against Purdue last week and was visibly angry after Notre Dame's 23-10 loss. While Jones did not perform to expectations, neither did Notre Dame in going 1-3. 
But this week was differ­ent. Jones showed the game-changing abilities he displayed as a sophomore and junior and flashed the brilliance that the Irish have expected since his return to school. 
Most importantly, Jones gained the swagger he had during his first three years at Notre Dame when he gained 1750 yards and 19 touchdowns. He can take that swagger into the remainder of Notre Dame's games this season. 

"It was a lot of confi­dence," Jones said. "I felt confidence in the offensive line and they felt confident in the running backs. It was a great game for us to get our confidence going for USC and the rest of the sea­son."

Freshman Harris gets his first start 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Spons Writer 
PITTSBURGH -Another true freshman saw playing time for the Irish Saturday as offensive tackle Ryan Harris was moved into the starting lineup at right tackle. 
Harris, who became the sixth Irish freshman to see the field this year, learned he would start Friday. 
"[Friday] Coach [Tyrone Willingham] asked me if I called my parents, and I told them, 'Yeah, I think I'm going to play this week.' He said, 'Well, you should call them again and telJ them you're going to start," said Harris after the game. "I was prepar­ing all week in case of that. Someone went down in prac­tice, so it seemed kind of inevitable that no one else was there." 
The rookie was part of a re­vamped Irish offensive line that helped running back Julius Jones to a 262-yard, 
-record-setting day. "I just look~d at it like I want to help my team any way I can," Harris said. "I just work hard everyday and pick up the system and game schemes more and that ended up hap­pening, so it worked great." 
Hartis was just one part of a different-looking right side, as tackle Dan Stevenson moved to right guard for the game. The switch paid off, as the Irish amassed 352 yards rushing. 
"I thought the combination of Ryan Harris and Dan Stevenson worked very well," Willingham said. 'That was a very difficult transition, because one is a freshman get­ting his first start, and the other is a tackle moving over to guard. I thought it was a great move by our coaches, and it worked out very weU for us." Air attack grounded 
As the Irish rushing attack shined Saturday. the passing game struggled. Freshman quarterback Brady Quinn was only 5-of-1 7 passing for 33 yards, with one interception. The young signal eaHer strug­gled to connect with his reeciw~rs, but still led his team to victory, and that is what's important, according to Willingham. 
"The measuring stick that I have for our quarterback is simply to win, and Brady [QuinnJ did that tonight," he said. "He made throws when we needed big throws. He led our football team with a calm and a presence that we expect from our quarterback." 
The disparity in the Irish offensive production -Notre Dame had 352 yards rushing and 33 passing -was almost a complete reversal from the squad's last time on the field. Two weeks ago against Purdue, the Irish had 297 yards passing and only 49 rushing. 
"I will label that part of the growth process that we're going through," Willingham said. "Some things are good one night and not so good the other night. Eventually, we'll be able to put aH of our areas in the right place." Where was Setta? 
After converting the first point after touchdown and sending ofT the ensuing kickofl', Irish place kicker Nicholas Setta was absent from the field Saturday, as junior D. J. Fitzpatrick replaced him both punting and place kicking. 

"Nicholas [Setta] suffered an injury on the first kickoff, and after that point he was ruled out," Willingham said of the senior's injury. 
In Setta's place, Fitzpatrick -who started the year as Setta's backup and holder on place kicks-was 2-for-4 on field goals, hitting from 19 and 34 yards and missing from 52 and 32 yards. He also had five punts for an average of 37.4 yards a kick. 
"Holding this year broke the ice for me, and I wasn't that nervous, but kicking and punt­ing is a little different," Fitzpatrick said. Game day captains 
Serving as captains for the Irish were safety Glenn Earl, Setta, offenslve tackle Jim Molinaro and linebacker Courtney Watson.
