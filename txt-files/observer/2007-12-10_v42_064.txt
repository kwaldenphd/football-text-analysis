The 17 members of the Notre Dame Figure Skating Club took to the ice Sunday in their annual "JACC Frost" performance.

81-year-old Scotch sells for $54,000 
NEW YORK-A bottle of 81-year-old Scotch sold for $54,000 at this New York's first liquor auction since Prohibition. 
An anonymous collector bought the pricey potable at Christie's sale of wines and spirits on Saturday. 
The 1 00-lot auction sold a total of $304,800 worth of rare wine and liquor. The top lot was a collection of' 729 bottles of whisky, which went for $102,000. 
The $54,000 bottle was distilled at Macallan in Scotland in 1926, bottled in 1986 and rebottled in 2002. 
Prohibition lasted from 1920 to 1933, but New York State did not allow auctions of spirits until this year.

Belles ring for charity group 
Saint Mary's students collect money for Salvation Army campaign 
By MANDl STIRONE 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's students got in the Christmas spirit by volunteering at the University Park Mall this weekend, ringing Salvation Army's famous little bell for the "Red Kettle Campaign." 
The first "Bells for Belles" took place Dec. 1 and continued this past Saturday. Community mem­bers signed up with the Office for Civic and Social Engagement (OCSE) and took hour-long shifts either alone or with a club or cause. 
"This past Saturday we had about twenty people participate in the bell ringing at the UP Mall, in front of Macy's," OSCE director Carrie Call said. As of Wednesday, there were 12 peo­ple signed up with one spot still open, she said 
So far the success of "Bells for Belles" has looked promising, Call said. She hopes that with the support she has received from the student body, the program will be able to continue to become an annual event. 
"The response was very posi­tive, so I hope to do it every year," Call said. 
"Bells for Belles" is run entirely through OCSE, with no student organization, Call said. It is unaf­filiated with any club on campus, she added. They are working specifically through the Salvation Army. 
"The Salvation Army, an evan­gelical part of the universal the bulk of their money raised for Christian church, has been sup­the year.

The "Red Kettle Campaign," is an important fundraiser for the Saint Mary's community to sup­port, Call said. The campaign, which has been in existence since 1891, is the Salvation Army's "most prominent fundraiser," according to ring­bells.org. 
"The Red Kettle Christmas Campaign enables the Army to provide food, toys and clothing to over six million people during the Christmas season and helps more than 34 million Americans recovering from all kinds of per­sonal disasters nationwide," the Web site said. It brought in over $100 million in 2004. 
"The Salvation Army depends on the Red Kettle campaign for clubs to dorm sec­

Resident Assistant Jackie Rothschild took part of her sec­tion in Regina Hall to work an hour shift. 
"We wanted to do a service project with the section," she said. "We had five girls come." 
For junior Emily Tarnacki, it was a rewarding experience. 
"I did it to get into the holiday spirit, and I thought it was for a good cause," she said. "I really enjoyed myself and everyone was friendly and generous. I would definitely do it again next year."

Foundation avvards 
$500,000 science grant 
Special to The Observer 
The National Science Foundation has recently acknowledged Notre Dame's growing influence as a resource for high school sci­ence teacher enrichment with a $500,000 grant for continu­ing support of the Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program. 
The three-year grant was awarded to Wolfgang Porod, Frank M. Freimann Professor of Electrical Engineering, and Alexander Hahn, professor of mathematics and director of the Kaneb Center for Teaching and Learning, to support RET@ND. 
As RET educators bring their summer experiences back to the classroom, they inspire a new, younger gener­ation of potential scientists. The program addresses "a shortage of teachers and a shortage of students going into science and engineering," Porod said. 
"A parallel motivation," Hahn added, "is to enhance the success of faculty in sci­ence, engineering and mathe­matics who seek to respond to the 'broader impact' criteria that so many grant applica­tions include." 
Grants from the National Science Foundation, in partic­ular, increasingly demand that projects demonstrate this broader impact. RET@ND establishes a structure of community outreach to educa­tors. 
While on campus, RET teachers become both Notre Dame employees, who earn research stipends, and schol­arship students, who earn tuition-free course credits. 
Besides performing research side-by-side with some of Notre Dame's most accom­plished scientists and engi­neers, RET teachers are asked to infuse their experience into their high school curricula. Nevin Longenecker, a cele­brated Adams High School sci­ence teacher and noted sup­porter of high school-levellab­oratory research, is the liaison between RET@ND and the high school classroom experi­ence. 
"Nevin knows how to trans­form discoveries made in the laboratory into classroom enriching elements," Hahn said. 
The NSF grant specifically funds engineering RET activi­ties. A parallel set of high school teachers receive stipends and credit for work­ing in College of Science labs and mathematics workshops. Stipends for science and mathematics are supported by such sources as the College of Science, the Siemens Foundation, the Community Foundation of St. Joseph County, and Teachers Credit Union.

and administra­tors charged with preserving the University's Catholic identity. 
And if "persons of other faiths and none (within the faculty] contribute decisively to forging and advancing Notre Dame's identity," as the report said, then their concerns could be justified, said Sullivan, a history professor. 
lie said the 1968 book "The Aeademic Hevolution," by sociol­ogist David Hiesman and Christopher Jencks, posed the theory that sinco universities compete for outstanding schol­ars and professors, the faculty that are in a stratngic position to influence policies. In other words, the faculty really steer a university's course, the book says. 
"If this book has any single mossage," Jencks and Hies man wrote, "it is that the academic profession increasingly deter­mines the character of under­graduate education in America." 
Sullivan said Hiesman and Jencks visited Notre Dame while they were writing the book for their specific analysis of the fac­ulty in Catholic schools. 
"(Hiesman and Jencks! deter­mined that the only thing that could actually give a Catholic school a religious identity is hav­ing brotlwrs, sist£1rs and priests teaching and running the place." 
But Notre Dame has changed a lot since Riesman and Jencks visited. 
While the University's presi­dlmt is still a Holy Cross priest and many rnsidence halls are run by priesl'i and nuns, the pnr­centage of Catholics in the facul­ty has eroded eonsiderably. 
"It was almost inevitable," Sullivan said. "As the University expanded, hiring could no longer be centralized in the Main Building, as it was during 
the  IUniversity  Prnsidcnt  
Enwritus  Father  Theodore]  
lleshurgh era."  

lin said each growing depart­nwnt and discipline began hiring profossors as it doomed fit and some fields -like psychology and biology -slowly became secularized. 
But the administration will put forth polieins to tight that ero­sion of Cath olie professors, inducting "indirect information gathering" techniques to identify Catholics in a pool of potential hires, the report said. 
"Sonw committee members think il fair and helpful to usn information available in the pub­lic domain ... for evidence that an academic is or may be Catholic," the report said. 
Some committee members, however. thought searching pub­lie sources for evidence of an aeadmnie's possible Catholicism is "an improper intrusion o individual privacy." 
So the report recommende all advertisements for facult positions state that th University is especially interest ed in hiring "women, minoritie. and scholars interested in teach ing at a Catholic university" a this kind of phrasing "invite individuals to self-identify a Catholics." 
Moreover, the committe urged all schools and colleges a Notre Dame to ask potentia hires during interviews, "Ho

Burish when h attends the Faculty Senate meet ing Wednesday to hear assessment of the faculty's reac tion to the document. 
During the Faculty Senate' meeting Nov. 7, Chair Coli Jessop, a physics professor, sai he sensed disquiet among th faeulty about the idea of hirin with religious affiliation in mind. 
"The University is worrie about the decline in the percent age of Catholic faculty member and the faculty members, i turn, are worried that in tryin to rectify this situation, th University will move away fro hiring solely on academi merit," Jessop said after th meeting. 
He and the senators hav spent the last month collectin feedback from the faculty on th report's recommendations t increase the number of Catholi professors, Jessop said Friday But he couldn't comment on th content of the feedback becaus the Senate, the administratio and the committee agreed t keep all discussions about th report confidential unti January, when the Oflice of th Provost will be finished collect ing suggestions from the faeulty. 
Sullivan and Executiv Assistant to the Provost Brando Hoach also said they preferre not to comment on the report o the ongoing dialogue betwee the Ollice of the Provost and th1 faculty about the issue. 
But Sullivan did say he expect­ed many faculty members ­especially those who are not Catholic -to be "scratching their heads, thinking, 'Is there a place for me here?'" after read­ing the report. 
The document, however, through all of its recommenda­tions, reiterated that "it is imperative that the University maintain an environment where faculty of other faiths and none are included as full members of the community." 
But some of the report's rec­ommendations might make achieving that goal complicated. 
The report, for example, said the University "must of course" appoint leaders who believe in the necessity and value of Catholic hiring, both as deans and chairpersons. 

While Sullivan could not com­ment directly on that recom­mendation, he did say a person's religious affiliation "has no bear­ing in getting tenure or promot­ed to higher positions." But the people appointed to these posi­tions, he said, should support the University's Catholic mission. 
The report also suggests fund­ing a program that would bring to campus more academics that combine their scholarly, scientif­ic or artistic work with Catholicism as lecturers, short­term scholars-in-residence or as visiting professors. 
"Departments that have identi­fied multiple outstanding candi­dates might be permitted to make simultaneous offers for a given opening. This practice can increase the probability of hiring Catholic faculty," the report said. 
But the committee made it clear throughout the doeuments that any faculty recruited by these initiatives should not be perceived as academically inferi­or to other hires. Among quali­fied candidates and on a case­by-case basis, however, "mission lit may well be determinative" when hiring a new professor, the report said. 
The report also expressed fears of misunderstandings and damaging rumors both within the University and outside about any distinctive policy of recruit­ing Catholics in all departments because of their Catholicism.

Iraq prepares crackdown in province 
BAGHDAD -Iraq's defense minister promised on Sunday to wage a new crackdown in a volatile province northeast of Baghdad where militants are trying to regroup after being routed from their urban stronghold there last summer. 
Suicide attacks have killed more than 20 people in the lac;t three days in Diyala province, a tribal patchwork of Sunni Arabs, Shiites and Kurds that stretches from Baghdad to the border with Iran.

Prosecutor Bernard A. Carter said Kalinowicz had sex with the boy several times between Dec. 2, 2005, and Sept. 2, 2006. 
The boy's father told the court that the crime continues to affect the family. His son, now 16, changed from a typical student to a chronic run­away who now is a ward of the state.

Thousands help clean up oil spill 
Supertanker crash dumps 2.8 million gallons into sea offenvironmentally-rich beach 
Associated Press 
MALLIPO BEACH Thousands of people mobi­lized by South Korea's Coast Guard used shovels and buckets Sunday to clean up a disastrous oil spill polluting a swathe of the country's scenic and environmentally rich west­ern coast. 
About 100 ships, includ­ing Coast Guard, navy and private fishing boats, were also to help contain and clean up South Korea's worst spill, said Coast Guard official Kim Young­hwan. 
At total of 7,500 police, military, civil servants and volunteers struggled to remove the oil, some bat­tling headaches, dizziness and nausea. 
The oil started hitting beaches Saturday, a day after a Hong Kong-regis­tered supertanker was slammed by a South Korean-owned barge that came unmoored from its tugboat in rough seas about seven miles off Mallipo, one of South Korea's best-known beaches. The area also includes a national mar­itime park.

IN BRIEF Trade summit ends with no progress 
LISBON -The first summit between Europe and Africa in seven years came to an acrimo­nious end Sunday with leaders squabbling over human rights and no progress on a loom­ing trade pact deadline. 
Old divisions surfaced at the two-day sum­mit as leaders swapped accusations over the crises in Zimbabwe and Darfur, and postcolo­nial tensions deepened over free trade deals. 
The World Trade Organization has ruled that the EU's 30-year-old preferential trade agreement with Africa was unfair to other trading nations and violated international rules. New deals are meant to be finalized by Dec. 31. 
Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade said most African leaders had rejected the European Union's free trade proposals, known as Economic Partnership Agreements, and wouldn't discuss them further. 
The proposals "aren't in Africa's interest," Wade said in angry comments at a news con­ference. 
Increase in credit card debt reported 
WA.';HINGTON -Consumer borrowing rose in October at a slightly faster rate than the previous month as shoppers continued to depend on their credit cards to finance purchases. 
The Federal Reserve reported Friday that con­sumer credit increased at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in October, faster than the 1.6 percent growth rate for September. 
The gain reflected an acceleration in the growth of credit card debt which offset a second straight month of declines in the category of debt that includes auto loans. 
Revolving credit, which includes credit card debt, increa'>ed at a rate of 8.3 percent in October following a gain of 6 percent in September and an even stronger pace of 10.6 percent in August. 
Credit card debt has been surging in recent months as consumers have started borrowing more heavily on their credit cards now that home refinancings have slowed. That slowdown has n~flected tighter bank lending conditions as a seri­cms slump in housing has sent home prices falling and increased the level of mortgage defaults.

Affordable and thoughtful gifts not mutually exclusive 
Everybody wants something particular for Christmas. There's always that one gift that will make a person's holi­day just perfect, no matter what happens. 
II' you're the sort of person who goes out of your way to f'ind that girt, this article isn't for you. 
Some of us, however, are just aver­age college students. "It's the thought Erik Johnson that counts" is morH of a lifnline than a saying when it comns to buying 
The Bradley 

your friends gifts. When you barely 
Scout

have morwy to get a sandwich, how arn you supposed to make everybody Bradley on the Christmas list happy? 
University

Fortunately, people have been dodging tho expensive-gift bullet for years, and now their expertise can be passed to you. 
Tho macaroni necklace: This one is highly useful because if you replace th1~ word "maearoni" with "diamond," you rnalize thn only diiTenmce bntween noodles and diamonds is tightly-bonded carbon. 
And aren't we siek of carbon? Isn't it part of carbon diox­id!~'! That means the same thing costing $1)00 to put on a chain and wear on your neck is slowly boiling the Earth. 
This is a perfect gift for your significant other because it costs about $3 to make, but it shows you really care. Granted, you only eared enough to put some noodles on a string, but if you give it in a really romantic way-or if your significant other is a 3-year-old-then you'll still get a good response. 
If all else fails, you can take the noodles off the string and eook them. 
Somebody else's elothes: Let's not mince words-clothes from Goodwill rule. Some of the coolest shirts I've ever owned were bought for two dollars in the T-shirt section of a Goodwill. You'll find a wonderful cross-section of retro T­shirts, creepy trench coats and extravagantly cheap dress­es. And the best part is the most expensive thing in the store is a couch that costs $75. 
Just imagine what you could come up with if you look really hard. A DVD costs about $20 anywhere else, but that could buy you 10 awesome T-shirts at Goodwill! And wash­ing a DVD doesn't mean it's as good the second time. 
Inside jokes: This one is incredibly easy, and you can even make it up completely off the top of your head. If you already have a long-standing inside joke with somebody, 
the job is half done. If' not, go to your friend's 
room/house/cave right now, make some obscure reference 
and hope like hell he or she linds it funny. 
Once you have a suitable joke, lind a eheap way to repre­sent it. If it's about a person or plaee, find a pieture and print it out. 
Arter that, the choice is yours. You could put it on aT­shirt, but buying iron-ons is dangerously expensive IH~hav­ior. Or you could simply wrap a $10 gift card in paper made of the picture and call it a day. 
If the joke is about an objeet, it's even nasior. Either lind the objeet in question and box it up or, if it's too big or expensive, make a scale model. This can be donn hastily and poorly, and then you can latf\r blame your lacklustnr art on lits of giggles bnr:auso the joke is just so funny, and you knew they'd love it. 
Gift cards: This one is fairly self-explanatory. Everyone knows there is maybe one thing in Best Buy that costs less than $10, but everyone is still thrilled to have a $10 gift card from there. Gift 1:ards are great because they pack a lot of meaning into a littlll bit of effort. 
You're basieally giving them money, but beeause that would be tacky as a Christmas gift, you go further and deny them the option of going anywhere but a plaee of your choice. Be it a restaurant or store, you get to choose where they spend it, and that means that you eared enough to choose where they want to go. 
If all else fails, there's one more. 
Used DVD's: Used DVD's are cheap. This also applies to video games, CD's and books. If you can find the right store, you can get an incredible amount of stuff for a small amount of money. 
I recommend Acme Comics. One year I went there for my brother's birthday and I got him a movie, a video game and a comic book for $11. I watched the movie more times than he did, stole the comic book and sold the video game to buy an XBox, but that's beside the point.

Victory for socialism 
With the defeat of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's sweeping referendum, many are proclaiming a victory of democracy over socialism, freedom over totalitarianism and autocratic government. 
I would like to defend the notion that Chavez's referendum defeat is actually a victory for soeialism, rather than a defeat. This will provide us Nicholas Zettel with several lessons about socialism. 
Socialism is meant to introduce the

out a state. Chavez lost sight of this goal 
University

of holding socialism to be a medium for ridding politics of the intervention of bureaucracies and states. 
Of course, thinking of politics without a state seems to be entirely counterintuitive. I would argue that this is actually the most important aspect of the challenge of soeialism and communism: It will necessarily challenge our thinking about our own politics by conceiving of tactical measures to rid poli­tics of the state. 
This brings us to our second lesson. Socialism is not opposed to freedom. Socialism, as a conduit for communism, is meant to be one particular development or strand of free­dom. Usually, in light of its developments in the 20th century, socialism is equated with totalitarianism and a state eeonomy, in contrast to the freedom of democracy and some sort of market economy. This line of thought is mistaken, however. Freedom is not limited to one type of regime and one type of economy. 
Socialism is not limited to totalitarianism and state economies. To equate socialism with those functions is to sim­ply equate socialism with one aspect of its political thrust, and forget that it serves a radical function of moving politics away from the state. 
Chavez's defeat is a victory for socialism because it refrains him from developing economic reforms alongside increased bureaucratic developments, especially term limits. 
Socialism should not be equated with totalitarianism, and opposed to freedom, because the tasks of socialism are ulti­mately oriented away from the state, and the totality of the state. 
Our final lesson? As soon as we make the leap to equating one regime type with freedom and dcmocraey, we will equally find ourselves en route to totalitarianism.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Fight for underprivileged at Notre Dallle 
I was shocked to read Donna Bromeling's Letter to the Editor ("Custodial staff deserves fair treatment," Dec. 4) in which she detailed her plight as a custodial staff employee, who claimed that she has been unfair­ly compensated and experienced contempt from her supervisors. With her letter, she helped put a face on the working poor among us here at Notre Dame. 
Last fall. I was excited to hear influential public officials tackle immigration issues at the annual forum. but now I worry that Americans, and indeed even our Notre Dame community, will ignore legal cit­izens who work hard and follow the rules. I believe that as Catholics, we have a moral obligation to advo­cate social justice and help those in need, just as Jesus taught us to "feed the hungry and clothe the

He claims to want to "keep Christ in Christmas," but if you ask us, that's just TMI.

naked." Furthermore, Catholic social teachings have long upheld the value of human dignity, which demands a "fair day's wage for a fair day's labor." This in turn then, implies that we, as students, facul­ty, and staff, who fulfill our own job requirements should be paid a "fair day's wage." I would argue that a fair day's wage should at the very least be enough for a laborer to remain above the federal poverty level or at least enough to secure the basic necessities of life, including food, shelter, clothing, and health­care. 
Our Notre Dame leaders challenge us with the ques­tion "What would you fight for?" After considering Bromeling's concerns, I urge university officials and students to fight for human dignity and fair wages. 
Specifically, I urge the university, at large, to carefully examine the plight of our own working poor and then strive to be a model for the world in providing "fair wages" to each human being that allows them to flourish in the society with dignity and pride for the work that they perform. How can we as future lead­ers from Notre Dame expect to enact significant changes in the surrounding world unless we first address the needs of our own workers and poor here at Notre Dame?

Facebook does not have your back 
Facebook's alarming rise to prominence has already reached mythic proportions. In the world of technology, Facebook's story is told with a "Sword in the Stone" type of esteem, the same way one might embellish a story about the time they had sex with two roommates in one night. 
Launched in early 2004 by Harvard sophomore Mark Zuckerburg and his Alex Schaefer three roommates, the site had 100,000 users by June of that year and, as of 
The Daily 

this November, claims to have over 50 
Campus

million members. Its numbers cata­pulted when it altered the registration Universitycondition requiring users to have a 
ofConnecticut 

school e-mail address to access the site. Beforehand, having a Facebook account meant having a bit of pride. Users had gotten into college and as a reward they had this online community where they could interact with other sophisticates devoid of the distraction of those undereducated brutes who plague the web. Facebook's opening to the public was a source of minor outrage, mostly directed at the fact that high school kids could now access the hallowed site. 
The first change that threw the Facebook community into real turmoil was the introduction of the vaunted news feed. This feature compiled all moves made by its users and announced them for all to see on their friends' homepages. People reacted like Facebook had started typing up their diary and sending it to their friends. It felt like Facebook was trying to teach a course in Stalking 101. The problem was that Zuckerburg didn't phase in this new development by letting users choose what is displayed; he just threw up the new feature. This resulted in a backlash that was, pre­sumably, unexpected. Or maybe it was expected. Maybe he was just taking the same approach that my landlords did when we moved into our apartment and found that our rug smelled like it had been used as a sewage transfer station. Sure, they knew about the smell -I think people three towns over knew about it-but they didn't replace it until we complained. 
When Facebookers complained, Zuckerburg quickly made the needed changes, installing a privacy control and issuing a swift and genuine-sounding apology. He defended the news feed as a tool with endless beneficial possibilities, but said that users should have the ability to control what was displayed. Everyone accepted his apology and actually quickly accepted the news feed because, well, everyone kind of likes to stalk their friends. 
Facebook apparently learned from its mistakes, and its next significant augmentation -applications -was a fea­ture that users had to agree to use before installing. These independently-developed programs can be loaded onto a person's profile and range from various games to a decla­ration of fanhood for a team; there's even an application where users can anonymously disclose secrets. I'm sure the "Dirty Rumor" and "Embarrassing Childhood Story" appli­cations are in the works. Or maybe there'll just be a feature where parents can upload pictures of their young kid naked in the bathtub. 
Now it seems Facebook is back to its old tricks, although this time it was much more subtle. At the beginning of November, Facebook launched a new feature called Beacon. Many probably haven't heard of it because it was not an optional application, nor was it a visible one. 
When a computer visits a webpage it downloads "cook­ies" from that particular site. Facebook's cookies are not warm and soft. Rather, they communicate with a third­party site that tracks all of the members' personal online movements (purchases, tastes, preferences) on about 40 other partner sites, and sends that information back to Facebook-which uses this data to tailor its advertise­ments to appeal to each particular user. Also, until recently, it put the users' online purchases into the news feed. A per­son could have bought something on eBay, in a completely separate transaction, and had it announced on the site. 
The reason Facebook is such a progressive and influen­tial site is not because of its advancements in social net­working but because of its advancements in the field of marketing. One of marketing's main hurdles is reaching the target audience; it is a constant struggle and there is always collateral damage. Anti-marijuana ads aimed at dis­suading current smokers inevitably cause some curious children to ask their parents what this weird, forbidden. Mexican-sounding substance is. With Facebook, a company can be absolutely sure about who is seeing their ad because of the individual nature of the site. 
Most people didn't even know the Beacon controversy was occurring. Obviously, it caused a minor outrage among those in the know. A petition was started, letters were writ­ten and finally Zuckerburg issued an apology, making the necessary changes; he switched Beacon to an opt-in pro­gram rather than an opt-out service. 
While the apology again quelled the mob, the bravado with which Zuckerburg has marched around Silicon Valley is remarkable. Facebook's strategy now appears to be one of arrogantly confident risk. The site has become such an addiction that people are primed to forgive it, no matter how far it pushes the limits-as long as Facebook rectifies the mistake. 
Facebook, like most other websites, is designed so people will spend as much time as possible on the site. It really is an advertiser's dream. The concern with Facebook, and the thing to keep in mind, is that it does not have its user's interests at heart. It doesn't. It is truly and utterly motivat­ed by the business of the Internet. It's the same reason that companies can pay a fee to look at prospective employees' profiles and check their Facebook history. If it was really a network devoted to college students then this would not occur. I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing. For lack of a better expression, this is just how the world works. Just remember, Facebook is not your friend.

It's not just that they've won; it's how they've won. The Patriots have destroyed nearly everyone on the slate, running up the score, going for it on fourth down with massive leads and gennrally disrespecting every hapless squad they've encountered, leaving a wake of battered and broken football teams. The Patriots have won with swagger and sneer. Their sheer hate factor is off the charts. 
Unlike the true patriots from which New England derives its name, who spent much of the Hevolutionary War using guerilla tactics to defeat the greater numbers of the imperial British, these modern-day Patriots are the decided favorites in every game they play. In the past offseason, they paired all-world quarterback Tom Brady with all-universe wide receiver Handy Moss, a eombination that has led to an offen­sive juggernaut of epic proportions.

League officials caught the Patriots using cameras to tape opposing teams' signals. The Patriots paid a heavy price for their indiscretion (to the tune of a half-million dollar line for Belichick alone and another $250,000 for the team, plus the loss of its first-round draft pick in this year's draft), but the rest of the NFL may have paid a price far greater. By imposing the penalties on the Pats, the league incurred the wrath of the Beasts of the Northeast. 
The Patriots have three remaining games in their pursuit of season-long perfection against the New York Jets, Miami Dolphins and New York Giants, all decidedly Hobbit-sized underdogs. Of the three contests, two take place within the frigid (and therefore cozy) confines of Gillette Stadium, New England's home turf.

Pullman's epony­mous novel, the Assistant Scene first in the "His 
Editor 

Dark Materials" trilogy, "The Golden Compass" is the No. 1 film at the box ofTice. With the rise of fantasy fihnmak­ing in recent years, it seems likely that that trend will continue with director Chris Weitz' new fantasy epic. 
Lyra Belacqua (13-year old newcomer Dakota Blue Richards) is the young hero­ine at the center of Pullman's novel, a quiet girl who holds the mythic golden compass. Lyra uncovers the mystery of the Dust, the source of man's original sin, while encountering Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) and the underlings of the oppressive Magisterium. 
In a world inhabited by shape-shifting soul creatures called daemons, armored beasts and even James Bond-both Daniel Craig and his leading lady, Eva Green, appear in the film -Lyra must resist the Magesterium and fight for the freedom of the world. 
Written as something of a response to 
C.S. Lewis' Christian book series "The Chronicles of Narnia," Pullman's trilogy has garnered much praise from critics who cite the books' philosophical under­pinnings as more sophisticated fare than the usual young adult novel. Secular groups and die-hard fans of the fantasy novels have criticized New Line Cinema and Weitz' decision to water down these themes in the movie for a more main­stream audience. 
The strongest opposition to the film isn't coming from Comic-Con-goers, however, but from their parents. 
Groups like the Catholic League (which is not ofTicially tied to the Catholic Church) and others are speaking out against "The Golden Compass" for what they see as the film's assault on Christian beliefs. The original novel voic­es opposition to the type of power abuse that the Church has employed in its his­tory, with an explicitly clear anti-estab­lishment message in its epic final battle. It seems logical to think that similar ideas will surface in a film version whose advertising campaign is clearly targeted 
JARED WAFER I Observer Graphic 
at fans of the "Lord of the Rings" films and the "Harry Potter" series. The question at the debate's center is whether or not the "kids are all right." 
"My parents read me the books when I was nine," Richards said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, "and I fell in love with them. I really didn't notice the religious themes back then." 
It was only during filming, Richards said later, that Pullman's anti-establish­ment themes made her think of organ­ized religion at all. 
If the books do aim to dismantle Christianity, the Church and the Almighty Himself, like Catholic League president Bill Donahue and others allege, then the kids will definitely not be all right. These groups target Weitz' film for glorifying what they see as Pullman's atheist agenda, as well as New Line for marketing the film as it would with "Harry Potter" or other children's fare. 
The problem with this movement, though, isn't the film: It's the ignorance of the protest. 
Yes, Pullman is an atheist. Yes, his books discuss complex philosophies, and yes, they also criticize organized religion and the historic abuses of the Church. But even the Catholic News Service, which gave the film a positive review, acknowledges that Christians don't need to fear the questions that Pullman's nov­els and Weitz' subsequent film have raised. 
If anything, a film like "The Golden Compass" is something to embrace. It's a chance for constructive dialogue and debate about the beliefs we might take for granted. The world questions and challenges the beliefs we hold, whatever they are, every day. If history is any indi­cation, backing away from those chal­lenges is a misguided effort that can only keep your mind closed -an aim that, to Pullman, opposes the heart of "His Dark Materials." 
"I don't think they promote anything," Pullman told Entertainment Weekly, "except the good qualities of kindness, courage, curiosity, open-mindedness." 
In the end, "The Golden Compass" is really asking moviegoers to find the answers themselves.

Associated Press 
RICHMOND, Va. -How much, if any, will Michael Vick's role as financier of a brutal dogfighting ring hurt him? What about his use of drugs while await­ing sentencing? 
Or will he benefit from his public apology? His cooperation? His voluntary early start on his prison term? 
Answers to these ques­tions, among others, will determine how much time the suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback will serve in prison for his role in a federal dogfighting conspiracy. 
And the only man who knows the answers is U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson, who will sentence Vick in a packed court-
IN BRIEF 
Pacers' Tinsley unhurt in 
shooting 
INDIANAPOLIS -More late night trouble for Jamaal Tinsley could present more problems for the Indiana Pacers. 
Tinsley and several companions were targeted in a shooting Sunday morning that wounded one person. Tinsley was not injured, but he did not practice on Sunday, the team said. 
It was the third time since last October that Tinsley has been involved in a disturbance stemming from trips to bars or nightclubs. 
"I really didn't know what to think about it," team president Larry Bird told Pacers.com. "I was just hoping everybody was all right. You feel bad any time your players are in some situations, you feel bad for every­thing that happened. I just feel bad for the organization. We'll get through this, but it's tough right now." 
room Monday while the disgraced NFL star's sup­porters and animal-rights activists rally outside. 
Vick faces a maximum of five years in prison. Hudson is not bound by sentencing guidelines that suggest a year to 18 months, or prosecutors' recommendation. 
Hudson already has sen­tenced two of Vick's co­defendants to 18 months and 21 months -slightly more than prosecutors recommended, but still within the guidelines. 
Legal experts said Hudson's willingness to stick to the guidelines in those cases is a positive sign for Vick, but by no means a guarantee he will get similar treatment because so many factors could work against him. 

For example, Vick admitted he bankrolled the "Bad Newz Kennels" dog­fighting enterprise on a 15-acre property he owned in rural southeast­ern Virginia. He also gave his associates money to bet on the fights but said he did not share in any winnings. 
"The judge could say that but for the money, this might not have happened -or might not have hap­pened on the scale that it did," said Linda Malone, a law professor at the College of William & Mary. 
Richmond attorney Steve Benjamin, secretary of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, noted the plea agreement Vick negotiated with pros­ecutors did not include any sentencing enhancement 
Brewers sigu Gagne to one­
year, $10 million contract 
MADISON, Wis. -The Milwaukee Brewers reached a preliminary agreement on a $10 million, one-year contract with free-agent reliever Eric Gagne, giving the team another option at closer after losing Francisco Cordero to free agency. 
Gagne's deal, which is subject to him passing a physical, will allow him to earn an additional $1 million in performance bonuses, a person famil­iar with the negotiations said, speak­ing on condition of anonymity because the contract has not been finalized. 
Gagne's agreement was first report­ed by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel on its Web site. 
"We're not there yet," Brewers gen­eral manager Doug Melvin said Saturday night at the Marquette­Wisconsin basketball game. 
Melvin said the Brewers' interest in Gagne didn't indicate a lack of confi­dence in reliever Derrick Turnbow. 
for a leadership role in the conspiracy. But that does not preclude Hudson from considering that role, Benjamin said. 
Perhaps a bigger con­cern for Vick, according to Malone, is the extent of his involvement in executing dogs. Vick admitted help­ing kill six to eight pit bulls. Any details the judge learns about exactly what Vick did could weigh heav­ily in his decision, Malone said . 
She said Hudson also likely will take a dim view of Vick's positive test for marijuana in September ­a violation of the condi­tions set for Vick's release after he pleaded guilty. The infraction prompted Hudson to impose a cur­few and electronic moni­toring. 

Division ID plaY.er sets single­
game record With 34 assistS 
DES MOINES, Iowa -The points kept coming, and so did the assists. 
David N. Arseneault shattered the NCAA assists record when he had 34 in Grinnell College's 151­112 win over North Central University of Minnesota in a Division Ill game Saturday. He made a total of 86 passes. 
The previous high of 26 was set in 1989 by Hobert James of Division III Kean University. The Division I record of 22 was achieved by three players, includ­ing current Dallas Mavericks coach Avery Johnson at Southern in 1988 and Sherman Douglas of Syracuse in 1989. 
Grinnell, in central Iowa, is known for a unique style of play that includes rotating five players in and out as often as possible, pressing the entire game and shooting more than 50 3-pointers.

BOXING 

Mayweather stays 
unbeaten with KO 
Associated Press 
I.AS VEGAS Floyd Mayweather Jr. didn't need to dance to beat Hieky I latton. I lis fists proved a lot more potent than his feet. 
MaywClathnr l'nmainnd unbeaten Saturday night and retainml his daim to being the best pound-for-pound fighter in thn world by stopping I lattcm in tho IOth round of a brawl that featured none of tho fancy foot­work tlw American has shown in the ring and on reality TV. 
llatton wouldn't lot Mayweathnr move, but it didn't mattor as Mayweather used precision pundws to wear down the challenger for his 147-round crown. llatton kept trying to get inside and score points, but Mayweather had an answc~r for everything he did. 
Tho ond came after Mayweather landed a crushing lel"t hook that dropped llatton on his back in Mayweather's corner. Hatton got up at tho eount of eight, but Mayweather almost immediately got him on the ropes and landed anothor flurry of punches to the head. 
llattcm went down almost on a delayod n~action, while at the sanw time referee Joe Cortez movnd in to stop the tight and llatton's corner threw in the towel at I :35 of the round. 
It was the first loss for llatton, a brawler from Manchester, England. who did his best to do what no other lighter had ever done and break down Mayweather's defenses. It was elear from the early rounds, though, that Ilatton would have trouble doing that. Mayweather, fighting for the first time since beating Oscar De La lloya in May. was able to pile up points and seemed to be cruising for 

an easy deeision win when he 
shot out the lel"t hook that was 
the beginning of the end for 
Hatton. 

"I knew it was going to be 
tough," Mayweather said. 
"That's why I didn't do anything 
halfway. lie was definitely the 
toughest competitor I've ever 
faced." 

Mayweather (39-0) was ahead H9-81 on two ringside score­cards and 88-82 when he scored the thundering punches that both stopped llatton and answered critics who said he was a boring fighter who fought defensively and rarely took any chances when it counted. 
It was Mayweather's home­town, but Hatton's crowd at the MGM Grand hotel arena. A brass band played in the upper deck, among thousands of British fans who packed the arena and needed little urging to stand up with beers in hand to sing "There's only one Hicky Hatton" to the tune of "Winter Wonderland." 
David Beckham sat ringside in the arena just down the street from where his wife was per­forming at the Mandalay Bay on the Spice Girls reunion tour. Those unlucky enough to not get tickets going for thousands of dollars watched it on dosed cir­cuit at several Strip hotels, while back home some 350,000 British homes were expected to spend about $30 for a pay-per­view broadcast that began about 5 a.m. in London. 
Mayweather countered with a little star power himself. He was joined by fellow "Dancing With the Stars" competitors Mark Cuban, Wayne Newton and llelio Castroneves on his walk to the ring, an appearance that was roundly booed by most of the crowd. 
MLB 

Rangers agree to tern1s with Bradley for 1 year 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Outfielder Milton Bradley and the Texas Hangers reached a preliminary agremnnnt Sunday on a one­year contract worth just over $5 million. 
Bradley, who also had consid­ered re-signing with the San Diego Padres. could play out­field or bt) a designated hitter with the Hangers. His deal also contains performance bonuses. 
"I would bn very comfortable with Milton Bradley," Hangers manager Hon Washington said last week at the winter meet­ings. "If Milton were to become available to the Texas Hangers, we would like to have him." 
Washington was a coach with the Athletics when Bradley played for Oakland in 2006. 
Bradley was the second-half off'nnsive catalyst for the Padres, who fell one win short of going to their third straight trip to the playoiTs. But he tore the anterior erueiate ligament and damaged cartilage in his right knee when Padres manag­er Bud Black spun him to the ground while trying to keep him from going after umpire Mike Winters during a confrontation on Sept. 23. 

San Diego and Bradley, who has a history of losing his tem­per, daimed Winters baited the player into the confrontation and directed a profanity at him. Winters was suspended for the final five days of the regular season and didn't work the postseason. 
Bradley's injury was the eli­max of a bizarre sequence of events. 
A few innings before he was injured. Bradley inadvertently stepped on Mike Cameron's right hand as the two chased Garrett Atkins' inside-the-park home run. Cameron injured his thumb and made just one appearance the rest of the sea­son. 
Bradley finished the year hit­ting .306 with 13 homers and 37 HBis in 61 games with Oakland and San Diego. 
NBA 

Wade helps Riley reach 1,200 vvins 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES-Pat Riley felt a whole lot better after his 1 ,200th regular-season victory as an NBA coach than he did Sunday morning when he brought the Miami Heat into Staples Center with a live-game losing streak. 
Dwyane Wade helped improve his coach's disposition consider­ably, getting 35 points and 10 assists in a 100-94 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. 
"Two nights ago when I got here from Golden State," Hiley said, "I was feeling a little bit low. OK? My wife's in town, and I went to the 19th floor of the Four Seasons Hotel at about 
1:30 in the morning. I was out on the balcony looking down at Wilshire Boulevard, and she said: 'Honey, don't do it. It's not worth it.' ... The value of an NBAwife." 
Hiley is the third NBA coach to win 1,200 games, and he reached it in his 1 ,842nd game. That's 248 faster than Don Nelson, the next fastest. Hiley, in his 24th season as a coach, guided the Lakers to four NBA titles before winning another with the Ileal two seasons ago. 
"It's those kind of moments that you 'II always remember, good and bad," said Hiley, coaeh of the years with three organi­zations. "The first 600 15331 were here in Los Angeles -a lot of great players, guys. You know all of them. Dwyane thinks I'm extinet, but that's OK. That's what he said to me in there." 
Wade, who had 33 points in Friday's loss to the Warriors, has recorded consecutive games with 30 or more for the second time this season. Udonis Haslem and Rieky Davis each added 17 points. 

Corey Maggette had 24 poinl'i and 12 rebounds for the Clippers, who have lost eight of their last nine games. 
Fourteen-time All-Star Shaquille O'Neal got his first up­close look at the new-and­improved Chris Kaman, who is well on his way to a break­through season while Elton Brand recovers from offseason surgery to repair a ruptured left Achilles tendon. 
"It's always a touch matchup with someone like that because you have to bring a double­team, and that leaves someone else open," Kaman said. "l-Ie's just so big. When you try to go into the middle and shoot a jumper, he doesn't have to move very far to catch up with you if you beat him on the first step." 

Kaman, an early favorite for the league's most improved player, won the statistical matchup between the 7-foot centers with 14 points and 12 rebounds. It was his 15th dou­ble-double, one more than he had in 75 games last season. lie is averaging 18.5 points and 
13.6 boards. 

"We came into the league in the same drall class. I knew he was good then, but he's even better now," Wade said. "Every year he's getting better and bet­tf~r. and this year he's having a career year. lie's got a bright future." 
O'Neal, who complained pub­tidy during the week about not getting the ball enough from his teammates, was 4-for-8 from the field and finished with eight poinl'i and eight rebounds in 33 minutes.

Runners post positive results in Blue and Gold Invitational 
By ALEX BARKER AND 
ANDY ZICCARELLI 
Sports Writers 
Notre Dame got ofT to a solid start on Friday when it hosted the annual Blue and Gold Invitational against DePaul, Marquette and Detroit Mercy. 
Sophomore Joanna Schultz captured the 200 and 400­meters and many of her team members posted Big East quali­fying times at the meet. 
"Only a few years ago, we started inviting other teams to this meet because we discovered that these marks would qualify for the Big East meet," Irish coach Tim Connelly said. 'These would not be wasted marks." 
The men's and women's teams combined to pick up 40 Big East qualifying marks on Friday. However, even for those that did not qualify for the champi­onships, the meet was an oppor­tunity to gain some meaningful experience before the end of the fall semester. 
"It gives our team an opportu­nity to compete before going home for Christmas break. They have been training since September and this gives us a chance to evaluate our team," Connelly said. 
Connelly had plenty of good races to evaluate. 
The Irish swept the 500-meter dash. Out of the 14 competitors, the top seven finishers were all Irish runners. In addition, all seven qualified for the Big East championships with their times. The winner was freshman Cora Dayon, who ran a time of 1:14:37. 
In the distance races, the Irish were without their impact run­ners, senior Sunni Olding and freshman Marissa Treece. Both have struggled through injuries and illness since training began in September. Connelly said they were not yet at full strength and probably would not be fit until February. 

The Irish throwers performed well under new coach Adam Beltran. Anna Weber qualified for the Big East meet in the weight throw with a toss of 
17.54 meters. Weber and sopho­more Jaclyn Espinoza finished first and second, respectively, in the shot put. 
Irish junior Mary Saxer became a conference qualifier in the pole vault with a mark of 
3.4 meters. Sophomore Jaime Minor finished in first place in the triple jump with a mark of 
11.34 meters. 
The team will be off until returning from winter break. Their next meet will be the Notre Dame Indoor Opener on January 18.

with a distance of 17.76 meters. 
"The freshmen are doing v e r y

Careergame brings Irish win 
Barlow nets 19 points in second half to halt Purdue in West Lafayette 
By JAY FITZPATRICK A'sociare Spons Ediwr 
!\shiny Barlow had the best game of her college earner when Notre Dame needed it most. 
The sophomore guard l'in­islwd Saturday's ()\ -48 win over Purdue with a earner­high 22 points-I 9 of which came in the second half. 
With the Irish (8-1) down :HJ-32 with 12:40 left in the game, Barlow nailed a 3­point jumpshot to bring the Irish within one. Arter a turnover from Boilermakers guard FahKara Malone, Irish guard Brittany Mallory found Barlow open for another :{-point basket 35 seconds later to give the Irish the two-point lead. 
Barlow would add two steals and another jumper in the next minute to put even more distance between Notre Dame and Purdue. 
"I thought that IBarlowf took ovfH the game in the second half," McGraw said. "Baek-to-baek 3-pointers, hnr dnfensc was exceptional, she got some steals. She really just made things hap­pen in a stn>teh in the sec­ond half and rmtlly put the game firmly in control in the sneond half by us." 
Barlow's performance was especially important because Notre Dame's leading scorer -guard Charcl Allen -only shot !i-of-13 from the floor for I 0 points. Barlow's sec­ond-half performance picked up the slack and propelled the Irish to the win. 

McGraw said Allen does not always have to be the team's top scorer, as was the case last season. 
"I think that's the great thing about this team is our balance and our depth. And we have so many dif'l'erent weapons and everybody is out there ev(HY night trying to contribute in some way," McCraw said. "You know, when you have different players with that kind of tal­ent and Ashley steps up, it takes the pressure off of everybody." 
The coach added that she felt Allen's defensive per­formance and her eight rebounds and six assists were incredibly important to the Irish effort. 
The Irish sank into Purdue's slower style of offense in the first half and were down 25-20 going into the intermission. Early in the second half, the Boilermakers stretched their lead to eight points -the largest Purdue lead of the game. 
But the Irish offense came alive in the second half, outscoring Purdue 41-23. The 48 points allowed against the Boilermakers was the lowest score ever in the rivalry and was due to the t!Htms play in its zone defense, McGraw said. 
"To hold them under 50, I thought was a great thing to do. And our zone was really, really good. 1 was pleased because we played about 39 minutes of zone," she said. "And we've worked on it quite a bit, and so I was happy to see it work really good." 
One key part of the zone was to shut down Boilermakers forward Lakisha Freeman. Freeman entered Saturday's game scoring 14.1 points per game, but the Irish zone lu~ld her to 1-of-9 from the floor with her only basket coming from beyond the arc. 
"I thought the zone was really where she was," McGraw said. "We kept her on the perimeter and didn't really give her the driving lanes, and 1 thought that worked well for us." 
One player the Irish strug­gled against was Boilermakers center Danielle Campbell. Campbell finished with 13 points, seven rebounds and six blocks but failed to score in the paint because of the Irish zone. 
The win was Notre Dame's sixth straight since falling to Maryland 75-59 on Nov. 16. In nine previous trips to Mackey Arena in West Lafayette, Notre Dame has failed to come out with a vic­tory. But now McGraw knows what it feels like to get the win. 
"It was great. It feels good to finally know that I can go there and win," she said.

Belles defeat Tri-State behind Kessler, Hovve 

By GRIFFIN DASSATTI 
Sports Writer 
After winning the battles in the post and at the free throw line, Saint Mary's got its first conference win of the season, beating MIM rival Tri-State 82­68 on Friday. 
Senior guard Alison Kessler, who finished the game with 23 points, seven assists and five steals, continued to fill her role as the Belles' key performer. With the win, the team improved its overall record to 3-4 and its conference reeord to 1-1. 
Looking at the box score, the game appeared relatively even. Saint Mary's was 28-for-64 on field goals (44 percent), while Tri-State shot 27 -for-63 ( 43 per­cent). Each team made seven 3­point field goals. The difference, however, was at the charity stripe, where the Belles went 19-l'or-22 while the Thunder shot 7 -l'or-1 0. 
While many of Saint Mary's freB throws came as a result of Tri-State trying to extend the game by fouling, it was apparent from early in the contest that the Belle's had the gamn well in hand. They led the game for all but 3:18 and never trailed after taking a 15-14 lead with 11 :55 left in the first half. 
To the Belles' credit. the domi­nance was a team ell'ort. Three of Kessler's fellow starters scored in double digits. Junior guard Kelly Hashid finished with 17 points and juniors Erin Newsom and Meghan Conaty each netted 12 apiece. The Thunder had two scorers in dou­ble figures, led by sophomore guard Sarah Howe's 23 poinl'i.

Packers dovvn Raiders, clinch NFC North title 
Associated Press 
GHEEN BAY, Wis. -The Creon Bay Packers are going back to the playoffs. 
And maybe they're bringing a running game with them. 
Green Bay didn't need Brett Favre to throw the ball all over the l'ield to elinch the NFC North on Sunday, relying on the rushing of Hyan Grant and a pair of speeial teams touch­downs from Will Blackmon in a 38-7 victory over the Oakland Haiders. 
The Packers ( 11-2) assured an end to their two-year absm1ce from the postseason with thnH~ games left. 
"I don't know if too many peo­ple gave us a shot to be at this position," Favre said. "It says a lot about this team. I'm feeling good about my decision to come baek, obviously." 
Grant's hard running and sharp cutbacks carne in handy on a day when Favre's aching right elbow and left shoulder hinderod tlw Packnrs' passing game. Favre lnf't last week's loss at Dallas bncausP of the injuries and was limited in practice this W(Wk, but still made his 2!i0th straight start. 
(;rant, who was acquin>d in a trade with the NPw York Giants just before the season and took over as the starter last month, rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown. It was his fourth 100-yard rushing game of the season. Grant's presence has boosted what had been one of the league's worst rushing oll'enses. 

"I can't say enough about Hyan Grant," Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. "I think he's really coming into his own." 
Just at the right time -as the weather turns colder in Green Bay. 
Haiders coach Lane Kiffin said the chilly 18-degree condi­tions didn't affect his team. The Haiders (4-9) trailed only 14-7 at halftime despite struggling on offense, only to unravel in the second half. 
"I don't think the cold didn't tackle today," Kiffin said. "I don't think the cold threw incompletions today. I don't think the cold had nine penal­ties. We did." 
Haiders quarterback Josh McCown, starting in placn of the injured Daunte Culpepper, was 7 -of-15 for 110 yards with a touchdown and two intercep­tions b.-fore he was replaced by Andrew Walter early in the fourth quarter.

VeNard's first goal, the Irish struck again when senior Evan Rankin found his linemate Dan Kissel in the slot, who beat Princeton goalie Alan Reynolds for his first of two goals on the night. 
Kissel also added two helpers for a career-high four points in the game. 
Rankin and juniors Christian Hanson and Garrett Regan all scored, as Notre Dame tacked up four more in the second peri­od to blow the game open. 
Freshman Brad Phillips got the start in net and picked up his first career shutout with 24 saves, including 12 in the final period. 
"(Phillips] came up big two or three times near the end of the game. i was really pleased with his performance," Jackson said. "I thought he was very focused and he looked in control. It only bodes well for the future." 
Junior Jordan Pearce, who has started most of the season in net, was between the pipes for the Irish on Friday night and made 17 saves on 19 shots from the Tigers. 
Princeton got off to a quick start when right wing Eric Pridham beat Pearce on the power play for his first goal of the season. 
Three minutes later, Regan tied the game on a rebound opportunity. Senior captain Mark Van Guilder took the origi­nal shot and had two assists in the game. 
Notre Dame dominated the second period, outshooting the Tigers 14-3, but it took nearly 18 minutes for them to get one past Princeton netminder Zane Kalemba. Junior Justin White gave Notre Dame the lead for good and freshman Calle Ridderwall and sophomore Brett Blatchford picked up the assists. 
Princeton scored once more in the third period, but a short­handed goal from junior Erik Condra -his third of the year on the penalty kill -and a late goal from Ben Ryan were enough to give Notre Dame the win. 
The Irish will not play again until Dec. 29 at the Lightning College Hockey Classic.

brought the score back to a manageable 24-18 with 
12:18 remaining in the first half. Then, Notre Dame switched its defense from man-to-man to zone and shut down the Huskies. The rest of the half, the Irish outscored the Huskies 33-7 to take a 57-25 lead into the locker room thanks to a 72 percent shooting perform­ance in the first half. Kurz had nine points during that stretch, and Harangody had one of three monster jams that sent the Joyce Center into a frenzy. 
Brey said the Irish had trouble defending screens and the Huskies perimeter game when in the man-to­man, and that precipitated the switch to zone. But Brey also added that sometimes the best defense is a red-hot offense. 
"A lot of times. offense like that is a great defense because it's demoralizing when shots are going in like that," Brey said. "This pro­gram has done that at times. Now we've gotten better at putting a body on people in the paint on the defensive end and that's where I think overall we've made a step over the last two years." 
Notre Dame continued to pour it on in the second half, which allowed Brey to give extended minutes to his freshmen and walk-ons.

year Notre Dame has lost in the NCAA quarterfinals. In 2006, the Irish lost to Virginia 3-2 on the road. 
Clark said this year's oppo­nent was stronger and the team played better because they knew what to expect. 
"The players all feel that they did well and that we really were very close to pulling it off," Clark said. 
Saturday's loss was the final game for several key Irish players. The senior class was responsible for 20 of the 36 goals scored this year. The class brought Notre Dame to its first two quarterfinal appearances in school history. 
"This has been a great group of seniors. They have been great players and lead­ers, I am very sad to see them go," Clark said. "But if we are doing our job right, there should be players waiting in the wings to !ill their shoes."

The Irish found their game early in the second half, whnn thny applied pressure to the Seminoles with shots and set pieces, a flurry of whieh eame in a live-minute pnriod and culmi­nated in Notre Dame's second goal. 
A Florida State defender knocked midfielder Amanda Cinalli's centering pass out of bounds in the 51st minute, giv­ing the Irish a corner kick. Hanks' corner kick fell short, but she was fouled while pursuing the rebound. Hanks appeared to be fouled in the 18-yard box, which would have given the Irish a penalty kick, but the om­dating crew ruled that the foul occurred just outside the box. 
"You watch it on the replay if you want," Hanks said when asked if the foul oceurred in the box. "Says it right there." 
Waldrum was displeased with the ruling as well but said he's not supposed to question the officiating. If he were to do so, he said with a wink, "Somebody get ready to pay the fine." 
Hanks' free kick 
rebounded to 
Clark, whose shot

to Jlanks, whose shot was again 
de11eeted out. ller ensuing cor­

ter, but Dew's header flew just 
above the crossbar. 
One minute later, a Florida State foul gave Hanks a free kick from the right side. Her kick found Weissenhofer near the right side of the goal, but Wnissenhofer's header went indu~s wide of thn post. 
Defender Elise Weber tied the game in the 56th minute. Weber controlled the ball on the left side and started to the outside before cutting back in. She found an opening and fired a strong shot that ricocheted in oil' tho lnft post a few feet under the crossbar. 
"We thought they would get that second goal for a while lwcause they were prnssing and pn~ssing," Krikorian said. "Sooner or latfw thny were going to capitalize, and they did." 
Weber said the goal was help­ful. but that the tnam failed to finish the job. 
"I think it gave us a lot of momentum but WP just eouldn 't put the third goal away," Weber said. 
Thn Irish could not take the lnad before DaCosta's goal and failed to convert opportunities bPf'orn time expirnd. 
"It kind or npitornizes how this loam has bnen all year," Waldrum said. "I think this ganw just showed tlwir resilien­t~y again. A lot ol' teams would fall apart completnly after giving up thn first goal 15 seeonds into tlw semifinal."

"It's hard to say you're the 
better team when you don't 
win but I thought at times we 
were better," Waldrum said. 
Unlike in Notre Dame's national championship game loss to North Carolina last season, the Irish employed their style of play for the entire 90 minutes against Florida State, eontrolling the tempo and winning the pos­session battle. 
Notre Dame's will to win was most evident in the sec­ond half. The Irish eame out of the gate aggressively, attempting to play a long ball off the kickoff for forward Michele Weissenhofer. While the play was unsuccessful, it set the tone for the rest of the contest. The Irish pressured Florida State until the final whistle, forcing the Seminoles to surrender numerous corner kicks and free kicks. 
Notre Dame's sense of urgency was reflected in the number of fouls the squad committed. The Irish were whistled for 23 infractions to Florida State's 16. 
Yes, some of those were fouls of frustration. Still, all displayed how much this team wanted to win. 
As the Irish sensed the time running out on their season, they did everything they could to punch in another goal. Weissenhofer and forward Brittany Boek flew all over the field, repeatedly diving into passing lanes in attempts to gain possession. Defender Carrie Dew kept constant pressure on Florida State's back line, charging forward to win every 50-50 ball she eould physically get to. In short, the Irish could not have exercised more effort.

But that's how the game of soccer goes. Sometimes all it takes to win is a few lucky bounces and an opportunistic mindset. Florida State got those bounees and had that mindset Friday. 
Despite the loss, it's hard to imagine a more resilient team than Notre Dame. 
The players eould have easi­ly gotten down on eaeh other after surrendering a goal 15 seconds into the game. But instead they fought baek. 
After forward Kerri Hanks was tripped inside the box and the team was not award­ed a penalty kick, the Irish could have resigned them­selves to the fact that they weren't destined to win. They could have mailed it in aftnr falling behind 2-1. 
Or certainly after giving up Florida State's third goal. But they kept fighting despitn those circumstanees. 
In fact, a team with less charaeter might even havn fallen apart after starting the season 3-4-1 like the Irish did. But that early record simply provided an incentive for the team to beat the rest of its opponents. And the Irish nearly did just that. 
Friday's game marked Notre Dame's first loss since they fell to Penn State on Sept. 23. After that setback, the Irish had more of a will to win than any of their opponents and that was often the factor that set them apart from other squads. 
The team's intensity peaked against Florida State as the Irish did all they eould to make it baek to the national title game. 
Notre Dame's. NCAA Tournament run ended Friday. But it eertainly wasn't due to lack of effort.

HOCKEY 
Irish tnake it nine in a rovv with road victories 
By DAN MURPHY Associate Sports Editor 
No. 6 Notre Dame extended its winning streak to nine games with a pair of wins against Princeton on the road this weekend, and defenseman Dan VeNard had the first multi-goal game of his career, continuing the offensive success of a senior who has had an up-and-down collegiate tenure. 
After falling behind early Friday night, the Irish scored three straight goals and later added an insurance goal from freshman Bon Hyan to win 4-2. The following night, the Irish dominated from start to finish, winning 7-0. 
"I thought that our guys were ready to play, and I didn't think Princeton was as energetic: as on Friday night and our guys capitalized on it," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said about the sec­ond game. 
VeNard opened the floodgates Saturday when he snuck a one­timer underneath the crossbar 10 minutes into the lirst period. VeNard also picked up another goal and an assist later in the game for the first multi-goal game of his career. 
"I think he's playing with con­lidence," Jackson said. "lie rnal­ly has never been allowed to establish himself or build the conlidnnce beforn this year." 
VeNard has racknd up eight points so far this year in Notro Damn's first 20 games, which matches his total for the previ­ous three years.
