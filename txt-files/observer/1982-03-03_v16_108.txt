Passengers on a jet that had landed in Miami said they were putting on a charade to convince a would-be hijacker the plane was in Cuba when a burly auto racer awoke from a nap, sized up the situation and bowled the man over. The burly passenger and the captain of United Airlines Flight 674 wrestled the man to the floor of the Boeing 727 jetliner at Miami International Airport and the passenger,John Celestin ofChicago, held him in a headlock until he "turned blue." Guillermo Lazato Major-Diaz, a 23-year-old Cuban native, was arrested by FBI agents and charged with air piracy and 
using a weapon in the commission of a felony, authorities said. "I didn't have time to be scared," said Celestin, who was credited with ending the hijackingattempt. "But now I'm shaking." Major-Diaz was allegedly carrying a·bottle ofclear liquid that he threatened to ignite with a pocket lighter unless the Chicago-to-Miami flight, carrying 92 passengers and nine crew members, was diverted to Havana, author­ities said. -AP 
President Reagan vowed no retreat yesterday from his tax cuts and Pentagon buildup, saying the alternatives ad­vanced by critics are "designed to save certain legislators' hides rather than saving the economy." The president didri't name names, but his complaint was aired in the home state of a fellow con­servative Republican, Sen. Pete V. Domenici, who has declared Reagan's budget deficits unacceptable and proposed a counterplan which has attracted keen interest from leaders of both parties. Reagan, at an earlier stop in Cheyenne, Wyo., complained that Wash­ington "seems paralyzed by hand-wringers" over the record red ink in his own program. Reagan, whose lieutenants, including Budget Director David Stockman, have increasingly talked of compromiSe with the Congress, offered little quarter on his latest excursion from the Capital. -AP 
Federal Reserve ChairmanPaul A. Volcker said 
yesterday that at least short-term economic recovery is on the way, but urged Congress to reduce federal budget deficits lest the country "slip back into the morass again." As for the immediate out­look, Volcker said there is a "great probability we're going to see a leveling off of the economy and some recovery soon." But in con­trast to President Reagan's prediction of a robust recovery lasting several years, the head of the nation's central bank questioned the "sustainability of the recovery, whether it lasts or whether it turns out to be a rather temporary affair and we slip back into the mor11ss again." Even so, he said, there doesn't appear to be a risk ofa depres­sion. Volcker provided his assessment to the Senate Budget Commit­tee while Reagan's unpopular budget proposals was taking a beating from Republicans in the House and Senate. -"" AP 
The Senate easily approved legislation yesterday that would all but eliminate busing as a method of integrating public schools. The vote capped the first round of efforts by Senate con­servatives to limit federal court authority over social questions. Al­though the 57-37 tally was a major victory for Senate conservatives, the measure faces a highly uncertain future in the House. "The fight is not over," said Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., who has fought the proposal since last summer. "Thislegislation will not be enacted into law in this session of Congress." Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., a key backerofthe bill, conceded there is "a big hill to climb in the House" and said he was aware that "tricks" in the House rules might be used against him. The bill would pass if the House is permitted to vote, Johnston said. -AP 
Polish martial-law ruler Premier Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski concluded a two-day visit to Moscow on yesterday after apparently winning promises of increased Soviet aid for Poland's rapidly deteriorating economy. The official Soviet news agency Tass reported that while Jaruzelski was en route to Warsaw he sent a message to Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev saying the visit would "contribute to a further strengthening and deepening of fraternal relations between our parties and peoples." It was the Polish leader's first visit to Poland's chiefally since he decreed mar­tiallaw Dec. 13 to stop 16 months ofstrikes and challenges to Com­munist Party authority by the now·suspended Solidarity union. Official Soviet sources, who asked not to be identified, said Soviet leaders assuredJaruzelski that more aid would be provided. But the sources did not specify how much aid would be given or in what form. -AP

I'm stttlfng down by the highway, Down by that highway side. Everybody's going somewhere, Ridingjust as fast as they can ride.

Jackson Browne 
A college education is a part of the American dream. It has become synonymous with a ticket to a high paying, highly respected white-collar job. It is used today to "justify" our lives. But many years ago it was seen as more than just a way to get ahead in the world. Some time ago, higher education was an experience of tedious years striving to squeeeze as much ofour books into our heads as we possibly can, without spending many troublesome hours letting our hearts speak back to us, we are nothing but walking encyclopedias. Before we can begin to understand the world around us, we must first understand the world within. Before we can start to change what so dearly needs to be changed here and elsewhere, the changes and disorder from within must be completed and conquered. 

The understanding ofourselves will never be taught in any classroom or book. It is a project every college freshman and senior must individually undertake, labor with, and finalize. Using the college experience to pursue self-understanding, even at the expense ofsome 

ourselves and ourlives, and not just ofchemistry, math, acquisition of knowledge, is the most worthwhile and or accounting. Somewhere

have time to begin to ques­tion their intentions and motivations behind their college education. Four years of nothing but hard studying can leave a very empty fc:eling in one's heart, a feeling that questions in­stead of justifies. Those seniors who have blindly worked and run around trying to give their lives a purpose through sheer book educa­tion, now find themselves feeling slightly misled and cheated. In their running around, they have passed so much by, including, probably, themselves. College is such a crucial time for learning and understanding. The 

easiest part ofthe process involves our books; the hard­est part involves ourselves. 
It is easy to live with a book. It is easy to dispose ofthe book. It is a chore to live with ourselves, especially ifwe don't know who we are or where we want to end up. College has so often been used by people to run away from themselves, always keeping just a single step ahead of their individuality. The more they run, the more they hide from themselves. 
The education with books is only a small part of the college experience and education. During our time here in college we must also learn about life, ours and others. Probably the most important outcome ofhigher education is self-understanding, because without it a college degree is really pointless. Ifwe have spent four down to is enjoying college and getting every possible benefit and experience out of it. Then, the trick is to learn from the plethora of experiences about our­selves; our motivations, limitations, and strengths. Four years at Notre Dame 
are very special. Although we are burdened with studies, that is a fact ofhigher education. But we do not have to let ourselves be overburdened. If we spent less time studying for a course and more time on acquiring the knowledge from the course, we might not get an A in the course, but we would have gotten all there was to learn. We would also find more time to learn about our­selves through a greater variety of experiences. Now many would claim that there is not much to do here, and that things are "screwed-up," so what good is more free time to "experience" college. That free time is where we learn about ourselves; we must do what we like to do and work for the experiences we wish to have. Notre Dame, for all ofits many, many exceptional qualities, seems to stifile individuals from becoming themselves. It takes hard work to find worthwhile things to do that allow us to experience and explore our individuality, but its definitely worth the time and ef­fort. I don't know about you, but I'd rather get a C in a course (or every course) and an A in Living rather than the other way around.

Senate discusses laundryservice 

ByDANKOPP 
News Staff 
Both optional laundry service and 
additional coin-operated machines 
on campus are possibilities for the 
future, according to Student Senator 
Brian Callahan. 

In Monday's Student Senate meeting Callahan reported the results of a study he undertook regarding Notre Dame's laundry situation. If the service were made 
optional it would result in only a ten­percent loss ofbusiness for the Saint Michael's Laundry, said Callahan. By not hiring new workers when others retire no employees would lose their jobs, according to the study. 
New machines would be needed to accomodatc extra students doing their own laundry. Callahan said that the facillty in Badin Hall is already too small. John Moorman, Director of Maintenance, told Callahan that both Keenan and Stanford Halls have 
continuedfrom pal(e 1 
students suggested SMC Security 
work more closely with ND Security 
in providing escons at night. Others 
felt the service was not as depend· 
able as it should be. Becker said "I 
tried to once but it took Security 
forever to show up. I don't suppose 
many girls use it." 
Of those interviewed, most stu· dents felt the nighttime guard that patrols the Main Avenue was a good idea. Sophomore Jan Czop said "I know that they do their job. He is out there watching. I also think it's a good idea to have them dress like students." 
Freshman Cindy Minot feels this guard is "definitely wonhwhile." Minot suggested the guard also patrol the ND side of the avenue, 
areas which could accomodate the 
twelve machines which would be 
needed. 
The bulk of the expense to the halls would be the necessary instal· lation of additional power lines to handle the extra electricity. Moor· man told Callahan that he would not be against the optional service. Moorman, according to Callahan, would just like to "wait and see." 
In other business, Student Body President Don Murday reported on a study he is undertaking about the quality of student life. Murday was commissioned last year by the Board ofTrustees to conduct the study. 
Last week Murday's brother David, who is a psychologist, was on campus where he met with ad­ministration officials, students, townspeople, faculty, psychological services personnel, and the Presi· dent of the South Bend Chamber of Commerce. With the results ofthese 
interviews he plans to compose a

which she feels to be more dan· gerous due to its greater isolation. 
Some students feel this foot patrol should wear a security uniform. One student commented "You don't know who you can trust. Without a uniform, you don't know if he's a rapist or an officer. 
Many students seem to be con­
cerned about the underground tun· 
nels linking some of the dorms at 
SMC. According to Security policy, 
the doors to the tunnels are 
supposed to be locked at all times 
during parietals. However, many 
students say this is not the case. 
One student who asked not to be 
identified complained that the tun· 
nels are locked at irregular times. 
"And they are often never locked at 
all on the weekends," she said.

Murday says his brother informed him that the main problems which students express about the univer­sity are apathy, lack of social space, male-female relations and difficulty of communication with the ad· ministation. 
Also as part of the study, Murday will travel with Director of Students Jim McDonnell and two under­graduates during Spring break to other universities. Murday says they plan to visit Duke, Villanova, Vander­bilt and Nonhwestern "not only to look at physical faclities, but to talk to students and make a comparison with Notre Dame." 
The final component of the study is a survey being distributed to stu· dents to find out what they want in a student center. Murday plans to correlate all the information and give a formal presentation to the Board of Trustees on May 6,"armed with the results of my brother's repon, with the results of our trip, and with the student centersurvey."

Carversplay Nazz Winners Night

n Sat. night, March 6, there will be a unique act opening the Winners Night at the Nazz. Like themselves, their music is warm, 
Steve Willertz 
mellow, and emotional. The pair of 
,inging guitarists, Noah and Irene Carver, are sensitive people with an 
ability to feel close to their audience. Their renditions ofsongs byJames Taylor, Bob Dylan, and Joan Baez will foster a personal and 
relaxed atmosphere. Upon hearing 
the beautiful voices of Noah and 
Irene, you may not notice that they 
are both blind. 
The Carvers' unique t blend of music is nourished through their dif­ferent musical backgrounds. Noah, originally from Kentucky, combines'­that bluegrassfrom his heritage with the type ofmusic that dominated his early career, rock-n-roll. Noah has fond memories ofhis lead guitar days innte 1960's. His band, cen­tered in Indianapolis, rocked with the sounds ofChuck Berry and the Beatles. Those were rowdie times, someofwhich Noah would prefer to leave in the past. One such time was when his band was playing the Silver Dollar Saloon. Suddenly a man came in waving a gun, threatening to

shoot up the place. Noah would 
rather be arm in arm with his wife 
than in the miost ofa bar room 
brawl. 
Irene, on the other hand, comes 
from Columbus, Ohio with a 
childhood ofpiano and voice les­
sons. She classifies her early musical background as traditional folk. Irene modeled her style after such artists asJoni Mitchell andJudy Collins. She _E;_a very vc:rsatile musician and plays the dulcimer and the harp as well as 
the piano and guitar. Irene per­
formed her mellow folk music in 
coffee houses in and around Cincin­
nati, where she had a small follow­
ing. 
Noah was playing "some old 
Chuck Berry tunes" at a concert in 
Cincinnati just before their back 
stage meeting. Within a year after 
that introduction, they were 
married, although they continued to 
perform separately. They often 
played together informally and after 
two years of marriage, they decided 
to team up professionally. They rel­
ocated in South Bend and began a 
new family as well as a new career. 
They now have a seven year old 
daughter,)oni, and a two year old 
son, Adam. 
In recent years, Noah and Irene 
have played in various clubs in the 
South Bend area. Their most per­manent night club performances were :at the Boar's Head. They also enjoyed performing in the Whitewater Series at the Century Center. The Carvers have recently faded away from the clubs. They 
have grown tired ofplaying the requested popular music, night after night. Irene described it as, "taking the place ofa juke box." The Carvers now perform less and spend more time withJodi and Adam. They also both teach guitar lessons in South Bend. 
Th(: Carvers' act at the will be a first ofsorts. They have not played on a college campus since their out­door concert a Earlham The concert will include songs from BillyJoel and Gordon Lightfoot as well asJoan Baez,.James Taylor, and Bob Dylan. Noah and Irene will also perform a couple oftheir own compositions.

James Taylor twinkles at Holiday Star 
L
ast Thursday night's crowd certainly wasn't the picture singer ~ames Taylor expected. "You folks will do just fine," the acoustic guitarist announced at the beginning ofhis third (and last) evening at Merrillville's (Ind.) Holiday Star Theatre, located on Indiana interstate 1-65 South and U.S. 30. "The last couple ofnights we've had an oil painting for an audience," he stated before beginning two hours and two encores of familiar tunes. 
Aprecise, proficient yet still exciting musician on stage, Taylor en­tertained the audience with popular hits "Fire and Rain," "Steamroller," "Mexico" and "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)." For veteran Taylor fans, however, the performer included guitar and vocal solos on "You Can Close Your Eyes,' "Love Has Brought Me Around" (both from his Mud Slide Slim and The Blue Horizon album) and 

U!

"Something's Wrong," a little 
"traveling music" selected 
Mary Agnes Carey

from the]ames Taylor albun first released by Apple · records in late 1968 in Great Britian then in America the following year by Capitol Records. 
Bass player Leland Sklar, Dan Dugmore on pedal steel, "Chicago­born" drummer Rick Marotta and Billy Payne, a keyboardist former­ly ofLittle Feat, assisted Taylor throughout the evening, oftenadding innovative variations toJT's often heard selections. 
Taylor's voice sounded clear throughout the evening and reflected his impromptu manner. Slightly balding, Taylor still retains a youthful look and enough energy, it seems, to continue the hectic concert pace for several years. 
"Riding o-n a Railroad" came early in the evening, anotherMud SlideSlim selection that featured Taylor on acoustic guitar. "Up on the Roof," one ofthe two tunes Taylor selected from hisF/ag album ("Mother Trucker" was the second cut) was quickly acknowledged by the audience, followed by "Love Has Brought Me Around," a song 
that featured musicians Payne and Sklar. 
"Sunny Skies," and "Carolina In My Mind," songs about Taylor's home state (North Carolina), "Steamroller," and "Rock and Roll Is Music," a tune from the singer's Walking Man album, were also heard. "Long Ago and Far Away" gave Taylor another chance toil­lustrate his t;tlent in combining music and lyrics. The song explains the singer's disillusionment with past romances and his hopes for the end oflong, "golden rainbows" when love will become more "than just a word" he's "heard when things are being said." 
Taylor opened his second set with the help ofa reel-to-reel tape recorder for "You'reJust in Love," from Irving Berlin's "Call Me Madam," and "Shower The People." "Music," from Gorilla, "Sweet BabyJames" and "Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight" featured ex­tended instrumentals, incorporating all stage members into the production. 
'"Country-flavored' Bartender's Blues," "Handy Man" and "Your Smiling Face," all from Taylor's]T album, ended the concert before he appeared for encores "You've Got a Friend" and "Secret 0' Life." 
Taylor's most recent album "Dad Loves His Work," was not featured during the evening due to its "big band sound" that's dif­ficult to reproduce on stage, according to Taylor's road crew person­
nel. Bobby Womack and the Chi-Lites, Larry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers Band, Tom jones and the Beach Boys are upcoming acts who will be featured Mar. 12, Mar. 14, Mar. 19-21 and Apr. 2-3, respectively, at the Holiday Star.

Sch-wartzer albutn 'Ginchiest' 
P
eople have been complaining that Rock'n Roll is dying. They 
"viiTimly 
say that the hard rebellious drive which made youth and their music unite in antithetical glory against their parents seems to be disappear· ing. Disco died (thank God). Punk is passe. New Wave is split between the search for the lyrical and the tribal. The Stont:s are pushing perfume. Big investments may slow· Iy exchange the creative anarchy of Rock'n Roll for watered -down cutesy melodies which prove profitable. It looks like Rock is tur­ning middle-aged. 
But this is not true of Morrison Schwartzcr! Hailing from the K· Marts and asphalt prairies of New Jersey, Morrison Schwartzcr and the Toxk Wastes arc lcaving debits to the CPA's and searching for the es­sence of Rock'n Roll ... RAGE! 
In his second album it's The Ginchiest (on Guinncss World Records), Morrison brings home the message that Rock can con4uer all. Tht· album opens up with a hard punk vt·rsion ofthe Nat King Colc/Donny Osmond pure pop hit "Puppy Love" enhanced with kazoos and dog yipcs. Then it changes its musical direction and starts hopping with a Schwartzcr favorite "I've Got A Thorn McAnn Mentality" whose bopping refrain and bluesy verses celt-brate the mass production banality of modt:rn life ...a recurring theme of Morrison's own brand of Microwave Rock. 
Other notable cuts from the al­bum include "No Class," a reggae tribute to delinquency. "Change the Channel," a television durge, 

It's the Ginchiest( Guinness World Records) 
marches into a melody offavorite 
television themes includingMission lmpossib/e,Secret AgentMan and Green Acres. The album's first single "To You She Might Be A Waitress 
But To Me She's Kicrkegaard" is well 
on its way to becoming a hit. 
It's The Ginchiest is one ofthe more powerful new Rock albums out in months. It is a very strong fol­low up to Morrison's first al­
bum,Damn GlatiTo Meet 'Cha 
which contained the 1 hit "Just A 
Typical Top Forty Song." Consis· 
tcncy and originality are not new 
words when applied to crt:atively eclectic rockers like Morrison Schwartzer. Such artists thrive on versatility. They are in love with all forms of music... from the lyrical to the gutteral, from the harsh screams ofa guitar in agony to the mournful stroke ofa violin bow across the strings. This album contains such range. It can boast proudly ofits subtle lyrics, booming arrangement and the great taste of the vinyl itself. 
After one listen to It's The Ginchiest it is no wonder why Bruce Springsteen said, "I have seen the future ofRock'n Roll and he is Mor­rison Schwartzcr."

Nuke attacks do not destroy land, peopledo 
I
t's not easy to find a bright side to the possibility ofa·nuclear war, but ifour cities are ever destroyed and there's anyone left to rebuild them, I hope they do a better job next time. 
Even ifyou love our country, you can't go many places in it with· out thinking what a mess we've made. Too many ofour houses and commercial buildings are ugly and we've torn up too many places of natural beauty to put them there. Where there aren't any buildings, we've covered the earth with a net of roads. 
The trouble is, ofcourse, the United States was never really planned. Even ifsomeone had had the foresight to lay out our country to make it look the way it should look, no one would have had the time, the money or the know-how to do it. When the Pilgrims got here, they weren't thinking of us. They were worried about stayingwarm and dry. They weren't builders, carpenters or ar­chitects. They'd been living in cities in England and most of them didn't even know how

as a good as the Indian wig­wam. Our cities, our suburbs and our countrysides aren't the . -----­
result ofany grand plan at all. They're the result of millions ofdif­ferent. people doing things less than the very best way because of time, money, ability orgreed. On alot ncar our hone, a developer has recently put up six houses in a space too small for three. He leveled two barns, took down a hill with all the bigold trees on it and filled in 
an interestingg swampy area at one end with rocks bulldozed from 
the hill. It broke my heart. 
That's pretty much the way all America has been put up. I suppost: when our own house was built in the late 1800's, someone in the farmhouse halfa mile down the dirt road thought the man who built it was crowding him. 
We shouldn't give in easily to badly planned and poorly located housing, though. I like thc people in any town who fight the developers, but it's very difi1cultto know what's progress and what's simply greed. Greed keeps intruding on the right all of us should have to live in an area that looks nice. The troublc is, ofcourse, gret:d isn't illegal. 

It's not only the buildings in our cities and towns that arc poorly built and located, either. Many ofour cities themselves should look better and be somewhere else. 
Several years ago I flew across the United States and back in a helicopter with a cameraman, his assistant and a pilot. The country is some sight at that speed and that altitude, but I've often thought I'd like to redesign the whole thing. 
The landscape is dominated by cemeteries, car dumps and gravel pits that have been dug out ofhillsides for road construction. These are the three things you see more offrom the air at low level than you do from the ground. The other thing I knew all along but was most impressed by from a helicopter trip across this country, is that almost all our major cities were put where they arc because ofwater. Name a city and see if it isn't on a major river, lake or ocean. 
Water isn't as important to commerce today as it used to be when our cities were founded. Sometimes the bridges and tunnels you have to use to get over or under the water and into the city now are more trouble than the water is worth. I'd move a lot ofcities away from the water. I'd rather have It to play in, anyway. 
I have a million changes I'd like to make In the layout ofourland. I wouldn't want to do anything you don't go along with, ofcourse. Just to stan with, I'd move Fort Worth a little farther away from Dallas. I'd move one major city into both Maine and Utah so that Utah had somethingother .than just Salt Lake. And there's no doubt I'd imple­ment the old plans to move Washington, D.C., to Kansas, and sell the old Washington to Disneyland.

Who says you can't have fun when you're 8-16? 
After all the frustrations, narrow defeats and embarrassing blowouts that have made this such a see-saw season, Notre Dame threw a party last night at the ACC for its three departing seniors, at the expense of Northern Iowa. 
It didn't really matter that the Irish blew away the Panthers, 86-56, or that they shot an ACC record 67 percent from the floor in the process. 
It didn't even matter that John Paxson scored a career-high 27 points ("He could have had 57," said Irish Coach Digger Phelps), hitting 12-of-14 from the floor and extend­ing his consecutive free throw string to 23. 
None of this mattered, for this night belonged to senior captain Mike Mitchell, and his classmates Marc Kelly and Gary Grassey, each of whom were playing their last games ever in the ACC. 
For Mitchell, it was an upbeat farewell to the Irish fans after an up­and-down four-year career that saw him tear apart the cartilage in both knees, sit out substantial portions of two seasons, and then defy his doc­tor's prognostications to come back and have his best season ever. 
"Mike Mitchell is very special to me,'' said Phelps. "Here's a guy whom the doctors said would never play basketball again. I made him captain because I thought he was a good leader and a mature influence on the team -and he has definitely lived up to that. 
"That was a fun game," said Mitchell, who finished with 1 0 points and a team-leading five assists before leaving to a one-minute standing ovation. "No strategy in­volved at all. We just went out and hatdaball. 
"Coming to Notre Dame was the best experience I could ever have. I learned a lot about life apart from the basketball court. If I had to do it all over again, injuries and all, I would do it the exact same way." 
Marc Kelly pumped in a season­high three points off the bench, including an awesome coast-to­coast reverse layup that reminded some ofJulius Erving, and others of Danny Ainge. 
"How'd you like my 'Doctor J' move?" Kelly asked rhetorically af­ter the game. "I was so pumped, I felt 
like I could dunk it " But the curtain .call belonged to 
Gary Grassey. After missing four straight shots, and with the clock reading :1I, it looked like Grassey would be thwarted in an attempt to 
score once more for the home folks -that is, until Panther Coach Jim Berry made his donation to the NO athletic endowment. 
He called his defense back down the floor, and earmarked ~free layup to Grassey with three seconds left. Sports Information described it this way: 
"Grassey takes a court-length p d ·bbl b it t 

ass, rt es once, es a es,
pumps with no defenders and banks shot off glass six inches above rim through center of hoop for a pair, improving his season scoring average by 67 percent." 
The only question was, why didn't he dunk? "Hey, I just wanted to put the bleep in," said Grassey. "H they were giving me a layup, I was gonna take it." 
And Digger's reaction? "I just hope tht. FBI doesn't watch a tape of this game," he said. 
Yes, it was that kind of night. 
Trainingperiodconcludes; Bengal Bouts set to begin 
ByWILLHARE 
Sports Writer 
For almost seven weeks now, over 60 fighters have been training in the boxing room of the ACC for the 1982 version of the Bengal Bouts. And the show is about to begin. 
Sunday afternoon marks the first day of opening round matches in this year's tournaroent. The winners will proceed to the semi-finals to be held next Tuesday evening, with the title fights (to be taped by NBC television as usual) taking place on Thursday night, March 1 L 
John Donovan, returning 155-lb. class champ and co-president of the Boxing Club, states, "It's the best group ofboxers in the four years I've been here." 
Indeed. Seven out of ten cham­pions return along with four or five runner-ups for what should be the most competitive and skillful bouts in years. 
Returning are Mike Martersteck ( 142-lb. class), Tom Bush ( 145lbs.), Jim Mladenik ( I 50 lbs. ), Donovan, Greg Brophy ( 165 lbs. ), Mike Burke ( 177 lbs. ), and heavyweight Mike Walsh. Senior Tim McCormick is ex­pected to challenge Walsh. 
Burke points out, "We've had a smaller number of fighters this year because the quality has been so much higher overall." 
Slightly less than half of the field are novice boxers. Starting Sunday at 
I:30 p.m., fights will go on for most of the day as the field is narrowed down. There are ten weight classes and there will be either three or four fights in each class in the opening round. 

"There usually are not good fights until the finals," says Donovan, "but not this year. The opening round and the semifinals will be better than ever. The group is in better shape and is more physically fit than in past years." 
Surprisingly, the Boxing Club is entirely run by students. This year's co-presidents are Donovan, Burke and Dickie Hillsman. They organize the training as well as the pairings. 
Rich Hunter, who coordinates the finances for the Bengals, states, "They (the fighters) run their own club with the help of adult supervi­sion. They do their own coaching." Among the adult coaches are Jack Mooney, who has been affiliated with the Bengal Bouts for over 35 years, and Mike Suddes. 
"We have a dual goal. First of all, we want to put on a good show for the people," points out Hunter. "We want to present the best of the boxing program we can possibly present. Part of this goal is to make sure the kids that do get on NBC do a credible job and show themselves as good boxers, which they have done in the past. 
"We also would like to raise a sig­nificant amount of money to send to the missions in Bangladesh. This is such an important endeavor, a worthwhile activity." 
Weigh-ins will take place tomor­row evening and pairings are due to be announced in Friday's edition of The Observer. 
The starting time of the semi­finals and finals will be 7:30p.m.

Final curtain closes on ND basketball team 
CLOSING CURTAIN -The Irish basketball team closes out its season this weekend with back-to-back road games against Dayton and Michigan . 
The Irish hold an 11-6 all-time advantage over Dayton but have only won two games at the UD arena in their last six appearances. Two years ago, Notre Dame upended the Flyers 62-54 as Kelly Tripucka scored 22 points, Tracy Jackson netted 17 and Orlando Woolridge grabbed 16 rebounds. Two years before that, at the end of the 1977-78 regular-season campaign, the Flyers caught the Irish one week after its stunning 65-59 upset of Marquette and one week before the NCAA tournament and handed them a 66-59 defeat. 
Digger Phelps is 7-3 against the Flyers, but has only won twice on the Dayton home court, in 1980 and 1976. 
Notre Dame's luck against Michigan has been anything but Irish. The Wolverines own an 8-5 advantage over the Irish, and are one of only seven Irish foes this season who boast a winning record against Notre Dame. The others are Indiana ( 29-16 ), Kentucky ( 29-15 ), Missouri (2-0), UCLA_( 18-11) and new additions Murray St~te ( 1-0) 

and SetOn Hall ·( 1-0). ----· -· -­The Wolverines have won five straight games over Notre Dame, including wins in the 1974 and 1976 NCAA tournaments. Digger Phelps has never beaten Michigan, dropping three regular season games in addition to the two tournament contests. In their last meeting, Michigan edged the Irish, 62-59, before 37,283 fans in the Silverdome. HOMECOMING -Both games this weekend will mark homecomings for three Irish basketballers. Junior guard John Pax­son will make the second and last trip of his career to hometown Dayton on Saturday. Paxson scored five points in a 22-minute ap­pearance against Dayton as a freshman. Barry Spencer and Tim Andree will return to their Motor City home for Sunday's contest. AN UPSETTING THOUGHT-This basketball season will be only the second in the last six years in which the Irish have not beaten the number-one team in the country during February or March. Last year, Orlando Woolridge's desperation jumper at the buzzer handed top-ranked Virginia its first loss of the year, 57-56. On February 27, 1980, the Irish upset DePaul 78-76 in double overtime to blemish the Blue Demons' 25-0 record and number-one ranking. On February 26, 1978, the Irish erased a 39-25 halftime deficit to subdue the defending national champion Marquette Warriors 65-59. And on March I, 1977, Notre Dame handed the Dons of San Fran­cisco their first loss in 29 consecutive games by a 93-82 count. All four ofthose recent upsets were Irish home games, three in the ACC and the latest in the Rosemont Horizon. QUICK ON THE ORAW-Inside Sports magazine has prepared its list of 1981 sports bests, and Notre Dame can stake a claim to both the first and second best Last-Minute Plays of1981. However, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that 1979 Notre Dame graduate Joe Montana's touchdown pass to Dwight Clark to beat Dallas in the NFC Cham­pionship Game was tabbed the best last-minute play t ofthe year. The bad news is that BYU basketball star Danny Ainge's drive the length of the court to beat Notre Dame 51-50 in the NCAA East Regional was the second best last-minute play of the year. THE NUMBERS GAME -The same magazine also reviews the final Associated Press basketball polls of the past I 0 years (up to 1981 ). In the past I 0 years, only UCLA has been ranked in the fmal Top I 0 more years than the Irish. UCLA placed in the Top I 0 in nine ofthe last I 0 years, finishing as a runner-up in the NCAA tournament the only year it was not ranked. Notre Dame and Marquette have each been ranked in the final Top I 0 seven times in the last ten years, with the Irish making the list six times in a row until this season. Notre Dame's best Top 10 finish in that span was in 1979, when it was ranked fourth and lost to eventual NCAA titlist Michigan State 80-68 in the finals of the Mideast Regional. In 1977, when the Irish made their first and only trip to the Final Four, they were ranked lOth in the final poll. Incidentally, the magzine points out that the NCAA champion has ranked in the Top 10 in each ofthe last 10 years, while the runner-up has been missing from the Top 10 only twice. PULL UP A CHAIR -Tickets for the 1982 Notre Dame basketball banquet are now available. The annual affair is scheduled for Mon­day, March 8 in the Athletic and Convocation Center. Cocktails are slated to begin at 6:30p.m. with dinner at 7:30p.m. Tickets cost S 16.50 each and are available at the ACC ticket office. ANOTHER TURNAROUND -Following Notre Dame's heralded mid-season turnaround, when it won 5-of-7 games in the ACC, the Irish have performed another reversal oflate, losing 5 of their last 6. However, they did win their first road game of the season, 59-55, at South Carolina and have two more road games to close ·out the season. RANKINGS WARS-The Notre Dame women's basketball team which is in the midst ofa four-game losing streak, dropped from firs~ to second in national scoring defense rankings, allowing 52.4 points­per-game. The team is also rated IIth in· field goal percentage of­fense at 49.4 percent. Mary DiStanislao's recruiting su<;cess is still shining, as a freshman has led the Irish in scoring and rebounding in 20 of their 24 games this year.
