Grant temporary injunction 
by Shawn Hill On January 23, Judge Nm man Kopec in the St. Joseph Surerior Court granted the University of Notre Dame du Lac a temporary injunction <'gainst the defendants, Fred Dedrick aTJd Brian Mcinerny, "individually and as representatives of all others acting in consort with them."  Mr. Philip Faccenda, Special Assistant to the President, answered various questions concerning this injunction. Concerning whether or not the University would seek a permanent injunction he stated that that is what the University originally sought when confronted with the demonstrations and that the restraining order and this  Faccenda went on to say that he believes that such an injunction is the best manner of handling illegal demonstrations and is a viable alternative to calling the police onto campus. He cited the success of similar injunctions on other campuses across the nation as proof of this. Fred Dedrick, one of the defendants in the injunction,

Dow-CIA demonstrations. Faccenda also explained how the injunction would work. He said that any person violating the terms of the injunction _«ould be held in contempt of court. He pointed out, however, that this was not an automatic occurence and it was up to the university whether or not to petition the court for a contempt citation. For example, he stated that even if a future demonstration was in direct violation of the injunction, it was still up to the university as plaintiff to decide if the violation was serious enough to petition the court for a contempt citation.  lie said that he was most disturbed to be named in the injunction. lie feels that he was in no way a leader in the demonstration against Dow and the CIA at the Placement Bureau. Finally he stated he could make no further comment on the case without prejudicing his position as defendant in future hearings. Whether or not a permanent injunction will be obtained or even sought is uncertain at this time. It wiJI all depend on the findings of the St. Joseph Superior Court and whether or not the university and the defendants can resolve their differences.

virus-and Lobund researchers see no way to remove the infection. They have now learned that all IS strains of mice examined carry the agent of leukemia, and that it is transmitted from mother to baby in every case. " 
However, the infection at the traditionally germ-free laboratory is by no means a tragedy, Pollard continued. 
"We are interested in studying leukemia-and in the mouse we have a naturally-occuring disease," he said. 
In addition, the mouse may become a doubly valuable model for the study of cancer in the light of speculation froni. the National Cancer Institute that a single virus underlies all human cancer, and is passed from mother to child with genetic material. 
Scientists at Lobund first suspected the mice were not virus-free when they began doing studies on the effects of radiation several years ago, Pollard said. In a contaminated atmosphere the pure effects of radiation are difficult to study, he explained, as the rays destroy the animal's defense system and pave the way for a host of unrelated infections and diseases. In a germ-free environment, no other infections are present which might disrupt the study. 
However, when researchers irradiated supposedly germ-free mice, the animals developed leukemia. The scientists immediately suspected that the mice were carrying a virus, since the air, food and bedding were unquestionably sterile.

Dr. Carberry contrasted his views on the matter to McKenna's. He feels that McKenna thinks the university places too much emphasis on academics. Carberry on the other hand expressed potential regret over the student who might tell him at some future time that parietal hours had hindered his studying.

FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3, 1966 NOTRE DAME, INDIANA 
Go back across the road 
Another chapter in the continuing saga of the co-educational sham was written Monday and Tuesday as Notre Dame converted Father Lange's old gym in Brownson hall into a center for Saint Mary's registrations. Brownson Hall which is behind the administration building was the first stop in the process. For those girls that had class changes, or "adds" or "drops", that they wanted to make the university had all the appropriate St. Mary's Deans and Department heads situated in O'Shaughnessey Hall. 
One has to wonder what the entire move was meant to prove. Apparently Notre Dame and St. Mary's are fully on the road to co-operation or merger or whatever you would like to call it. In principle we agree wholeheartedly with the co-operation efforts. We feel, however, that co-opera­tion does not mean that everything has to be done together at the expense of inconveniencing the faculty and administration of both schools. 
It seems silly to force all the St. Mary's girls to come over here to register. It might make sense to cut down on registration costs by having both schools use the same computer programing system and eventually possibly the same registrar. But the ego of the computer could have been readily satisfied if the girls were allowed to fill out their cards over at St. Mary's and if someone (perhaps a coeducational team of a boy and a girl) could have brought them over. There was no need to ask the girls to make the trip over to Notre Dame, especially in the cold weather. Nor is it justified to ask the professors or other members of the St. Mary's staff to set up quarters in exile on this side of the road. 
We support the concept of cooperation between the two schools and hope to see an expansion of the co-ex program and other mutual social and educational ventures between the two schools. We ask however that the administrations of the two schools take into consideration that it is the people at both schools that we are worried about -not some nebulous concept of co-ecucation. Co-education would be good for the communities because of the way that it will effect the people who make up Notre Dame and St. Mary's. For that reason we feel that the two 
.:;.chools should try to avoid situations like that which occurred on Monday and Tuesday. It didn't do that much for co-education and it certainly inconvenienced a lot of people. 
$5 to change courses? 
It is interesting to note that St. Mary's college hasn't improved its class scheduling procedure much since the fall. The college continues to maintain the same ridiculous policy of levying a $5 fine for each course that a student adds or drops after she files her original registration form. 
Such a procedure serves as a deterent to girls who feel that they wish to move out of a course that they had selected or pick up another. It is silly to place such an obsticle in the way of making a university curiculum flexible enough to meet the needs of the students. 
A student who comes to Notre Dame or St. Mary's is paying enough for their education. The cost of the paper work under the Notre Dame computerized registration system is minor and certainly does not come anywhere to equally five dollars per class change. The cost certainly could come out of the tuition that one pays. Students should not have to pay a tax if they should change their mind about the direction that they wish their in-class educational pursuits to go.

Editor: 
Now that coeducation has become a distinct possibility here at the University of Our Lady, I think it is necessary that we take the time to reflect upon the dangers involved in such an educational system. 
In our pagan times, it is difficult enough for the average Catholic male to lead a truly Christian life. Young men have enough to do to keep their minds fixed on their books and on acquiring the knowledge and good habits they will need later on, without having their attention divided and weakened by interest in the opposite sex. Just because sexual attraction is so strong, and in the time of youth, has the added charm of novelty, if we yield to interest in girls, to certain girls in particular, while still in school, 
we  can  easily  become  so  
absorbed  in  them  as  to  be  
seriously  handicapped  in  the  

performance of our other more important duties. 
This might sound absurd and ridiculous to those whose judgement t is already biased by. interest in girls. Therefore, in order to keep our heads clear, let our interests still be directed chiefly towards school, home, and church affairs, our sports and boy friends; and until we are old enough to think of marriage, let our contact with girls be only casual and of passing interest. 
We realize, of course, that a majority of the young college men across the United States attend coeducational u-niversities, and regularly associate with young women. But the· fact that something is being done by the majority of people does not make it right. A million people can be wrong. At the time of the deluge the whole world except Noah and his family were wrong. 
In conclusion, let us remember hat our bodies are truly temples of the Holy Spirit, and therefore, are not to be exposed to anything wkich might jeopardize their purity. Remember as the Holy Ghost tells ~s: "He that loveth danger shall perish in it."

This is not an outright condemnation of Notre Dame's society nor is it a condemnation of society as a whole. But this is a letter directed to some of those fellow "people" who attended the Titicut Follies on Saturday afternoon during the semester break.

Campus liberals form SLERT 
In answer to the growing stagnation of religious life at Notre Dame, three noted campus liberals have joined to form a Student League for Enlightened Religious Thought (SLERT). Michael Kelly, head of the Model U.N. and the Senior Fellow Committee, Chris Wolfe, Grace Hall President and former SLC member, and Tom Thrasher, Stay Senator and Chairman of the Senate lluman Affairs Committee, will lead SLERT. 
In SLERT's statement of purpose, they claimed; 
In the face of changing times and shifting coalitions, we arc forced to sadly concede that Notre Dame is not with it. ll is essential that our Christian community of authentic people be truly where the action is. If Notre Dame is to he where it's at, everyone concerned must be willing to make a sincere personal 
commitment. We, representing the progressive thought within our Christian University, call upon the entire community-the students, the faculty. the 
students, the administration, the students, the alumni and the students-to commit themselves totally here and now to a meaningful dialogue. 
Without this free and open dialogue we must declare that our university is no longer valid. 
In recent months the validity of Notre Dame and the relevancy of its students has come into question. Fierce and open debate has filled the pages of The Scholastic concerning the University's compliance in the Grape Strike, Fr. Ilcsburgh 's blatant indifference to the struggle of the Woman's Liberated Front, and thestate of Grace on the Board of Trustees. 
The Student League for Enlightened Religious Thought wishes to state firmly that it does not consider existing conditions likely. On the contrary, we feel that there is nothing which can stop an idea whose time has come and we will stop at nothing to find that idea. We must battle all rigid, dogmatic, fundamentalist 

and  immutible  values  in  the  perpetual  
revolution  for  a  huma nist,  flexible  
value-system.  


SLERT will attempt to rid Notre Dame of the Huddle's death machines.

Late at night, North having claimed he still remembered the Blackwood Conven­tion after a long lay off from bridge and a beer or two, thought he was confronted with it. Somehow taking South's 4 Spade bid as a call for Aces, he counted up from there and called 5 Diamonds for two. South took it as a cue bid showing first round control of Diamonds, a heavy hand, and an interest in slam. Bidding his 4-4-4-1 hand with Club controls and a

North trumped and stopped for a count. Needing twelve tricks, he decided his only hope lay in a dummy reversal and a 3-3 dub split. Accordingly, he played the Ace of Hearts and trumped a heart. He led a diamond from dummy and trumped. Returning with the King of clubs, he trumped the last diamond with the Queen of spades. After playing the Ace of trump, he led to dummy's King and Jack. Upon successfully splitting the clubs, North had 4 clubs, 3 trump tricks, 3

Picketting of the upcoming SUAC Camus Conference because, as one SLERT loyalist stated, '"lle symbolizes the epitome of Papal boot-licking!" 


4) An end to what Vice-Chancellor Wolfe called "the stifling aura of intolerance at Notre Dame" by the following means; 
a)University-financed chapels and University-hired chaplains for every religion represented at Notre Dame, which at last count would include Lutherans, Buddists, Followers of L ao-Tse, Presbyterians, Shintoists, Anglicans, Christian Atheists, Methodists, Baptists, Hindus, Moslems, Christian Scientists, Mormons, Jews (Orthodox, Conservative and Reform), Objectivists, Followers of 1-Ching and eighteen sects of Pentacostals. 
b)Establishment of special non-meat lines in the Dining Halls for Vegetarians (although Thrasher conceded that vegetarians could find little offensive under the present set-up) and a Kosher line. 
c)Establishment of a special infirmary for Christian Scientists. 
5) Establishment of a Department for the Non-Structural Resolution of Human Values, offering courses such as the new morality and the myth of original sin, 
6) That Sacred Heart Church be given to the people, 
7) That preclass prayers be abolished and replaced with one minute of private contemplation on "Soul on Ice", 
8) A public challenge from the leaders of SLERT to Billy Graham to debate him anywhere, at any time, on any topic, and 
9) That Father Duck be restrained from feeding the ducks and that those breadcrumbs be sent to the starving in Asia. 
In conclusion, Chancellor Kelly said threateningly, "If Notre Dame don't come around, we'll have to burn Notre Dame up!" 
CAF to screen 'Genesis II' 
"Genesis II", a two hour program of award-winning short films will be shown Thursday and Friday, February 5 and 6, at 7:00 and 9:30p.m. in the Engineering Auditorium. 
!by student and independent filmmakers from across the country will be presented by the Contemporary Arts Festival as an 
exclusive feature in this area. In addition to some wildly experimental techniques
= 
used in making several of the films, social documentaries, dramatic screenplays, and comedic styles of expression are repre­sented. The program as a whole is a representative cross-section of what is happening in motion picture production and in avant-garde filmmaking. 
Among these 16 films are a number of film festival prize winners: "Demonstra­tion Movie I", "Project I", "The Tem­pest", and "Campus Christi". The entire "Genesis II" program was featured in the San Francisco Film Festival in October as a special premiere attraction. Proceeds from nationwide screenings of the pro­gram will aid participating filmmakers in gaining exposure and financing for development of new projects. 
With over 80,000 students enrolled in film courses on campuses across the country, new developments and tech­niques are being made in film faster than the traditional movie industry can keep up. The Genesis program presents these exciting new developments to the public long before they find their way into commercial production. 
This particular series features one film in which two Notre Dame graduates participated as actors. Bill Siska and Ned Allen Buchbinder, class ef '67, collab­orated in the filming of "Campus Christi". Ned Allen portrays Satan. Bill Siska was the head of Cinema '67 at Notre Dame.

NO opposes Marquette Saturday; Sellout seen as tickets going fast 
Tickets for Saturday's Notre Dame-Marquette basketball game are selling at a brisk pace, so any student who wishes to see the contest should stop at the Convocation Center soon. This warning was issued yesterday by Donald Bouffard, ticket manager. 
bouffard estimated that as of yesterday, there were only three hundred tickets left unsold. He wanted the students to have a first chance at purchasing seats, before the general public. He felt that the students were not aware of the ticket shortage, and feared that many would be unable to see the game by waiting until the last minute to byuy seats. 
He emphasized that tickets will probably be sold out some time today. Marquette, one of Notre Dame's more formidable opponents, was ranked 7th nationally before falling to Loyola in the first half of the double header at the Chicago Stadium in which the Irish toppled Big Ten leader, Illinois 86-83. An NCAA at-large berth may be at stake in the game.

Abernathy leaves Chicago without testifying 
CHICAGO (UPI) 
The Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy passed up a chance to testify in the riot conspiracy trial yesterday. A defense attorney read a purported message from the civil righst leader criticizing the court's refusal to hear him Monday and calling the defendants "brothers on trial." 
U.S. District Court Judge Julius Hoffman called the Ahernathy statement "vilifying" 
and "a pretty horrible thing." The judge refused to explain Abernathy's failure to appear to the jury lest he make himself the target of "another vilifying tirade" by Willian M. Kunstler, the chief defense attorney. Kunstler Monday accused the judge of presiding at "a legal lynching" after the judge ruled the defense had to abide by an agreement reached with the prosecution Friday and rest its 
case without presenting another witness. 
Hoffman reversed that decision late Monday after the government protested its case had been prejudiced when Kunstler embraced and kissed the leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in open court with the jury present. 
But Abernathy left Chicago Monday and Kunstler read in 
Pope outlines his celibacy position 
VATICA.N CITY (UPI) ­Pope Paul VI hinted yesterday he might reluctantly consider the first limited change in the Roman Catholic Church's Jaw on priestly celibacy since its enactment 900 years ago. 
The change would allow married men of mature years with good family and professional reputation to become priests in areas of the world where there arc extreme shortages of priests. 
At the same time, the Pope the first time in centuries a pope has even hinted that some married men might be acceptable as priests-other than the handful of former Protestant ministers who have converted to Catholicism and been ordained with papal consent. 
Msgr. Fausto Vallainc, the Vatican press spokesman, said he believed the Pope was referring primarily to Latin America in raising the possibility · of ordaining ma-ried J:nen ff)r certain areas. "Above all this possibility does not concern Holland," he said. 
Only Sunday the Pope strongly defenced the celibacy law and said discussion on it was closed. His language Tuesday suggested he would regard ordination of some married men for restricted areas exception to the law, as is the ordination of former protestant ministers, rather than an actual amendment. 
ordered Roman Catholic bishops ,.----------==-~~-=-=,-------=-----------1 of the Netherlands to reconsider En S Thursday proposals for wider changes in the celihacy law that have brought the worldwide controversy over the subject to a boil in recent weeks. 
The Pope outlined his position in a 2,000 word letter to French Cardinal Jean Villot, the papal secretary of state. 
The pontiff expressed "grave reservations" about the possibility of ordaining married men for areas where there arl' shortages of priests and said it could only be done, if at all, by bishops of the world acting in union with him -presumahly at a synod of bishops.

Kunstler quoted Abernathy as saying he left Chicago with "a heavy heart." He said Abernathy said he had traveled through "sleet and snow to tell what I knew, only to be refused the right to do so because I was 16 minutes late." 
"My heart goes out to my brothers on trial," Kunstler read from the statement. 
The statement said Abernathy had "just returned from abroad as an ambassador of good wul for this country." 
"When I was asked difficult questions about my country's system of justice and equality I groped for words to explain that both existed," the message said. "When foreigners said 'You have no democracy, no justice in America' I attempted to prove that we did. 
"After my experience yesterday in this court I can no longer defend my country against such attacks."
