INSIDE COLUMN 



NCAA should not change policy on draft 
Anyone who 
watched the halftime 
show during the 
Tennessee game 
learned that the 

National Collegiate Bradley Galko 
Athletic Association 
(NCAA) is considering 

legislation that would Assistant News Editor allow a football player who applies for the draft as a junior and does not get drafted to retain his college eligibility. This would be a big mis­take for the NCAA because it discourages players from finishing their education and makes a negative statement about college athletics. 
Under the current system, a junior that is not drafted loses his college eligibility. This means he loses the chance to play football on national television in front of the pro scouts for another year. Additionally, in most cases, he loses the chance to finish up his education. Without a degree and without a football career, he finds himself between a rock and a hard place. 
This discourages players from applying for the draft early because they have a lot to lose for a very small chance at a gain. If the player stays in school, however, he can have another year of playing with additional exposure and often finishes his degree program. Therefore he has something to fall back on after football or in case his career is ended prematurely by injury or waiver. 
If the system is changed as the NCAA now proposes, however, far more players will leave school as juniors and relinquish their eligibility. Then a few weeks, months, or maybe even a couple of years down the road when he gets cut from training camp or waived or seriously injured, the player will find himself with no degree, no scholarship and lacking for a good job. Unfortunately the demand for sportscasters and spokes­people with a one-year or less football ca­reer is rather limited. 
Another problem with the NCAA would be the kind of image this legislation gives to college football. Are colleges and universi­ties places where people go for four years to gain an education and degree and simul­taneously sharpen their athletic skills, or are they just places to bide your time until the pros pick you up? 
Unfortunately, the new system would promote more of the latter. Essentially the proposed legislation sends a message of "go ahead and try your hand at the pros and if you're not successful just come on back for a while until you can try again." This is not the image college athletics should project. 
In light of the long-term damage to play­ers and the negative image this new pro­posed legislation would present, the NCAA should not adopt this new legislation but, rather, encourage guys to "stay in school."

A television journalist will become the first Japanese citizen in space when he joins Soviet cosmonauts on a mission Dec. 2, officials said. Toyekiro Akiyama of Japan's TBS television network appeared at a news con­ference Monday with Soviet cosmonauts Victor Afanasyev and Mussa Manapov at the Soviet space complex at Star City, the government newspaper Izvestia said Tuesday. The December flight, details of which have not been an­nounced, will be the first for a Japanese citizen. Other foreigners, including those from France, Afghanistan and Cuba, have flown on Soviet space flights. The Soviet Union has been trying to boost the image and profitability of its space program following budget problems and a series of mishaps. A hatch on the Soviet space station Mir failed during a flight this year, and a rocket exploded on the launch pad last month, destroying what a U.S. expert said was probably a spy satellite.

International students discuss life in the U.S. at Saint Mary's meeting

Br. Michael Smith, front right, Flanner Hall rector, is shown with Reginald Lechner a freshman at St. Joseph's High School, who is the recipient of the 1990 Brother Michael Smith, C.S.C. Flanner Tower Scholarship, a $1000 award presented annually to an incoming St. Joseph's High School freshman. 
By ANNA MARIE TABOR Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
If there was something the foreign students would change at Saint Mary's, they agreed that there should be a manda­tory geography course. 
Americans' geographical ig­norance was just one of the topics discussed in "To See Ourselves As Others See Us." Students and faculty from Bel­gium, Spain, Bolivia, Germany, NigBriu and India gathered to share their American and na­tive experiences to increase worldwide awanmess. 
Havi Parashar, visiting in­structor of bus·iness adminis­tration and economics, said that when he came to teach at Saint Mary's he was concerned about how people would receive him, but "students don't wonder why you're different. They expect diversity since this is a university and they take it in

stride that I'm just from an­other part of the universe." 
Born in India, Parashar has a strong Indo-Latin background that he has chosen to preserve by wearing his traditional dress. Both men and women wear "all colors of the rainbow" and Parashar's own colorful wardrobe reflects his attitude. "I feel happy and larky all the time. It's a Latin phenomenon," said Parashar, who has lived in Mexico. 
One student from India pointed out that younger stu­dents from foreign countries "come with another point of view and try to integrate their dress." Parashar attested to the graduate students being more prone to "keep their culture" in the visible sense. However, he said that no one forgets their culture no matter where they go. 
Since Parashar came to South Bend directly after living in Mexico for twenty-one years, his American experiences have been chiefly in this area. "For the life of me, I can't remember an unfavorable experience in South Bend," Parashar stated. "There are things I don't agree with, but I have many positive stories to relate." 
The bus system is a source of amazement for Parashar as he has been surprised at how ac­commodating they are. He re­called getting on the wrong bus once with two other foreigners. The bus driver called another bus, that took a detour from its route to pick them up and take them home. 
"How come people are so nice in South Bend?" Parashar mused and then answered his own question. "I think it's be­cause this is a small town. South Bend is different from Chicago and New York."

Scholarship awarded to local high school student 
By FRANK RIVERA 
News Writer 
Earlier this year, Flanner Hall awarded the Brother Michael Smith, C.S.C. Flanner Tower Scholarship to Heginald Lechner, a freshman at St. Joseph's High School. 
The scholarship, worth $1000, is presented to an in­coming St. Joseph's High School freshman on the basis of academic merit and financial need, according to Br. Michael Smith, Flanner Hall rector. 
The scholarship, now in its second year, approximately covers tuition costs for one-half 
son but does not feel that that has set her apart from the other students. 
"I don't feel anything by being older and hope nobody else does," she said. "I feel eighteen in my heart." 
Marechal described an initial "culture shock to an extent" because of the effort to "make new acquaintances, and just know your way around." The way American businesses are run was also foreign to her. 
Marechal's husband was put in a position of authority and she said that terminating em­ployees was difficult for him. 
"In Belgium, if you have din­ner with (employees), or have social contacts, you are consid­ered friends. My husband couldn't fire friends," Marechal explained. 
Atim Appio, a freshman from Nigeria, came to America after five years of schooling in Scot­land. 
"At the age of fourteen, I had to decide what I was going to do with the rest of my life," said Appio. "I wanted to change my major later on. I chose Saint Mary's to get a liberal arts education." 
Other students related the 
same reasons for going to school in the states. 
Maria Trigo, a student from Bolivia, was impressed by the attendance here. 
"European colleges try to flunk you. Here, the professors will do anything to help and ev­erybody goes to class. In Spain, no one does," Trigo said. 
Students admitted to having preconceptions of America, some of which were disproved. 
"I thought that all the land from coast to coast was like New York. When I came to South Bend, I was shocked," Elizabeth Forester, a student from London, said. "(Foreigners) are intrigued and interested by the expansive thought and territory in Amer­ica." 
She is impressed by "the dif­ferent modes of dress and practices that contribute to so­ciety." 
Parashar said that interna­tional students are pleased with American hospitality and like to return some of it by "sharing their heritage with hosts. They are usually ready to perform and show their culture." 
This informal discussion held in Haggar Parlor was spon­sored by the Anthropology Club. 
year at St. Joseph's. 
The money for the scholar­ship is raised by the residents of Flanner Hall through fundraisers, tournaments with proceeds going to this fund, collections and other activities, according to Smith. 
The recipient was named by St. Joseph's faculty and honored at a banquet held in October. 
The scholarship will be awarded annually using the same format. However, the number of awarded will not in­crease, according to Smith.

teaches that, while violence is 
evil, the obligation to avoid this 
evil is conditional," he said. 
Williams said that a 
"national, Catholic, research 
university," such as Notre 
Dame, definitely has a mission 
to educate those who aspire to 
serve in the United States mili­
tary. "To educate young men 
and women to serve in the mili­
tary is no easy task," said 
Williams. 
"What better place to edu­cate such a leader than at the University of Notre Dame, a place that strives to educate the head as well as the heart?" he asked. 
Williams read a portion of 
the university's mission state­
ment and queried, "Should we 
have ROTC at Notre Dame?" He answered, "We would be be­traying our mission if we did not." 
Williams acknowledged that Jesus' teachings stress love of our enemies and nonviolent

struggle for justice, yet he said that there is more than one way to strive for the kingdom of God. Williams said, "All Chris­tians should be actively pursu­ing justice" and sometimes there must be violence in that 
pursuit of justice. 
Christians may feel that they are being pulled in two direc­tions and an issue such as ROTC at a Catholic university may seem to present a conflict in values, said Williams. He ex­plained that violence is a legit­imate last resort and stressed, "justice seems to demand the defense of innocent persons, even if we must use violence." 
As an example of violence be­ing "clearly the lesser of two evils," Williams mentioned Hitler's regime. "What if we hadn't used violence against Hitler?" he asked. In cases such as that, Williams said violence is justifiable because the alter­native outcome would have been worse. 
In defending the fact that military training does advocate killing, Williams said, "There are worse things than death and one is not having freedom."

The first alternative raises the question of matters which du Lac calls "serious or sensi­tive or [that] involve pastoral concerns." In these cases, the repQrt allows for disciplinary conferences with Administra­tors like the ones that are held now. 
The second alternative would make the same provisions for pastoral concerns and serious and sensitive matters, and would lead to the abolition of Hall J-Boards. "It would also lead toward a standardization of rules and sanctions within the district; something that is much needed," said the report. 
The third recommendation attempts to clarify the rule on "serious and sensitive matters and pastoral concerns." 
As du Lac stands, students involved in in-hall violations have the choice to have their case heard by the hall J-Board or by the hall Rector. An excep­tion to this rule is made for se­rious and sensitive matters and pastoral concerns, in which case the Rector can choose to handle the case. 
The report asks that· "a stricter definition of 'serious 
Thursday, November 15, 1990l 
and sensitive matters and pas­toral concerns' be developed so that Hall Judicial Boards be­come more active." 
This provision was included in the report in the event that O'Hara accepts the University­wide Judicial Board, said Singh. 
"If she adopts the idea of dis­
trict J-boards, this recommen­
dation isn't needed," he added. 
The final recommendation of the report would assign the duty of coordinating the new judicial procedures to the Stu­dent Government Judicial Coor­dinator (currently Sanchez.) 
"We recommend that the duty of Judicial Coordinator be ex­panded to include working with Residence Life to set the dock­ets for University level J­Boards," the report said. 
This last recommendation would force the Judicial Coor­dinator to take on more official duties, said Singh. 
"We're trying to tell the Ad­ministration that while we are proposing all of these changes," said Singh, "we're not afraid to take on the re­sponsibility of running this."

Panel members regret late report on AIDS treatment 
WASHINGTON (API -Some members of a scientific panel said Wednesday they should have moved faster to draft guidelines for adding steroids to the treatment of a killer pneumonia in people with AIDS. 
"In retrospect, it should have happened more quickly," said Paul Meier, professor of statis­ties at the University of Chicago and vien chairman of the panel that convened last May. 
AIDS activists also said the pam1l took too long, but federal medical officials said these critics wen1 disregarding some important facts. 
Still other panel members said thn approval process could not have been significantly speeded up. 
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases on Oct. 10 sent an alert to physicians informing them that recent studies had found benefits among some patients with l'neumocycstis carinii pneumo­nia whose treatment was sup­plemented with steroids.

Steroids are known to weaken the immune system, and AIDS is a disease of a col­lapsing immune system. 
The letter, sent to 2,600 med­ical practitioners, was based on the findings of the 17-member panel organized by the institute and the University of California at San Diego. 
Mike Merdian, executive di­rector of the National Associa­tion of People with AIDS, said the five months it took the panel to come up with its rec­ommendations was "unconscionable" and "unethical" but not unusual. 
"We've long said there are many therapies available we're not aware of," he said. 
But the chairman of the panel rejected the criticism and said the time it took members to analyze the studies was well spent trying to agree on the wording of any recommenda­tions as to which patients would benefit most from steroid treatment, in what doses and for what period of time.

Panel discusses women's role and merits of ordination of women in the Church 
By STEVE ZAVESTOSKI News Writer 
Religious devotion is in­versely proportional to a woman's desire to obtain ordi­nation, according to research data presented by senior Julie Shadd, a member of the panel which discussed the position of women in the Catholic Church last night. 
Shadd said that women more involved in the Catholic Church are the ones intimidated by the thought of being ordained. This is a fear based on the socializa­tion of the church in which women are typically subordi­nate. 
According to Shadd, "we need 
to realize that there may come
a point when the (church) doc­trine is irreconcilable with the needs and desires of modern women." 
Shadd added that her genera­tion may be affected by changes

in church doctrine if women begin to speak out now. 
"Sometimes I have found in discussion of the woman's or­dination issue, that theology smuggles its way in too quickly and may cloud what I see as some of the key issues," said panelist Clark Power, associate professor in the Program of Liberal Studies. 
Power maintained that "the failure to ordain (women) is an injustice." He said, according to theologians, "the ordained min­istry is not privileged, it is not high status, it does not hold power-it is a service." 
"Obviously, in the Catholic Church ordained ministers do have power," said Power. 
He pointed out that at the latest Synnod, bishops agreed that there was no apparent problem with the priesthood, yet no women were involved in that decision-making process. 
Power also discredited the argument that men are more moral than women by referring to studies of morality tests. He noted that in most cases women and men with equal educations tested to be equally moral. 
According to Power inequality breeds immorality based on the process of power assertion while equality encourages mu­tuality and shared power. 
Power suggestnd that "such a community (as the church) may effectively keep its members in line but it will be ineffective as a moral teacher." 
Power concluded by compar­ing the subject of the ordination of women in the Catholic Church to the subject of an al­coholic father in a family. He pointed out that the family of an alcoholic usually avoids the topic just as the church tnnds to avoid the topic of the ordination of women.

Inventor reaches agreement with Ford Motor Co. over windshield wiper patent 
DETROIT (AP) -The inven­tor of the pausing windshield wiper agreed Wednesday to ac­cept $10.2 million from Ford Motor Co. to settle a 12-year­old lawsuit for patent in­fringement. 
Robert Kearns' agreement sends a signal to 19 other au­tomakers he has sued, claiming they violated his patent for in­termittent windshield wipers. 
Chrysler Corp. may be the next defendant up for trial, a Kearns attorney said. Chrysler said it is ready. 
"Because of the Ford settle­ment, we're encouraged that we will probably be able to reach agreement with Kearns without extended litigation," Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said. He would not elaborate. 
Ford attorney Malcolm Wheeler said the settlement re­solves all disputes between the company and the 63-year-old Kearns. 
"We're pleased to be done with the litigation," Wheeler said. "We still believe that if we had another shot at it, the patents would have been held invalid. We think this is an ex­tremely reasonable settlement." 
Kearns said the size of the award was beside the point. 
"I don't think the goal was the magnitude of the money," Kearns said after he signed the settlement in U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn's courtroom. "What I saw (as) my role was to defend the patent system. If I don't go further, there really isn't a patent system." 
Intermittent windshield wipers, now standard or op­tional equipment on nearly all cars sold in the United States, automatically start and stop at intervals. 
Bill Durkee, an attorney for Kearns, said Chrysler probably would be the next legal target, but he also said Chrysler has agreed not to dispute the valid­ity of Kearns' patents. 
Durkee said the $10.2 million settlement, of which his firm is expected to get 30 percent to 40 percent, was a good deal for Ford. 
"I think Ford got away with more than they should," Durkee said. "They made a profit from their infringement." 
It has been estimated that dealers have sold about 20 mil­lion Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars equipped with intermittent wipers. 
If the Ford settlement pattern were followed with Chrysler's estimated 13 million cars with intermittent wipers, it would work out to about $4.3 million. 
Kearns. who lives in Houston. claimed in his lawsuit that he installed intermittent wind­shield wipers on a 1962 Ford Galaxie and took it to the au­tomaker. 
Kearns, a professor at Wayne State University in Detroit at the time, said he was led to be­lieve by the nuJHL .Jr of ques­tions company engineers asked that Ford would buy his inven­tion. 
But that did not happen and Kearns sued. 
During the course of the liti­gation one mistrial was de­clared after a jury was unable to decide on an award. In a re­trial, Kearns left Cohn's court­room after writing an angry letter to the judge and disap­peared for several days. 
Now, with the settlement money due in an escrow ac­count by the end of the week, Kearns said he plans to pay off some legal debts and perhaps buy a house in Texas. And he will continue the legal battles to protect his patent. 
"They (lawyers) are running a business," he said. "I'm running a cause."

Retailers waiting for the Grinch Days of 'fast buckaroos' Christmas sales expected to be 'pretty lousy' gone forever for S&Ls 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Hetail 
sales growth slowed to a barely 
perceptible 0.1 percent in Octo­
ber, the government said 
Wednesday, prompting ana­
lysts to prediet that the holiday 
gift-buying season will be a 
bust. 
''I think holiday sales are go­
ing to be pn~tty lousy," said 
tlcorHJmist Bruce Steinberg of 
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets 
in New York. "Compared to 
ChristmasPs past, it's just not 
going to look very good." 
Economist Sandra Shaber of tlw FuturPs Group in Washing­ton agn~ml. basing her opinion on two months of declining salns at dnpartment and cloth­ing stores-often gauges of consumer sentiment. 
"Consumers have a limited budget." she said. "With thn rapid detHrioralion of the job market and morH inflation, consumers just simply have less money to spend." 
Tlw Commercn Department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $152.3 billion, up from $152.1 billion in Septem­ber. But like the previous two months, sales were artificially inflated by high gasoline prices, not volume. 
In fact, the department said sales actually fell 0.1 percent in October when gasoline pur­chasns were excluded. The price of gasoline has spiraled since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait disrupted world oil markets. 
Analysts saw the report as furth(~r evidence of weakness in an economy that many believe is now in a recession. Hetail sales represent about half of all consumer spending which itself accounts for two-thirds of the nation's eeonomie activity. 
Ms. Shaber predicted a repeat of last year's holiday shopping season, when many retailers cut prices and offered other promotions to lure consumers to their salesrooms. 
"It's really a very, very pro­motional Christmas already," she said. "We have too many stores and too many malls now being aggravated by the erosion of household purchasing power." 
Retailers depend on the holi­day shopping season for about half of their sales and profits. 
Automobiles, which represent about 20 percent of retail sales, slowed to a 0. 7 percent gain from a 2.9 percent increase in Septnmbnr. But Steinberg said unit salns were down in Octo­ber. suggesting the increase represented higher prices for new-model-year cars. 
Excluding the auto category, overall retail sales were un­changed from the previous month. 
Sales of durable goods, which include cars and other items expected to last more than three years, rose 0. 7 percent, just half of their 1.4 percent gain a month earlier. 
Purchases of building mate­rials rebounded 1.5 percent from a 1.5 percent drop in September, but sales of furni­ture and other home furnish­ings fell 0.3 percent. 
Non-durable sales, such as food and gasoline, slipped 0.2 percent after rising 1.2 percent the previous month. 
Gasoline service station sales were up 3.2 percent after in­creases of 5.6 percent in September and 7 percent im­mediately after the August in­vasion.

In a response to Eastnrn's n~qunst for the money, the creditors asked the judge to dose Eastern so it can be liqui­dated. The creditors said East­nrn's nconornic performance has repeatedly fallen short of Shugrue's projections. 
They worried that if any more money is handed out to keep Eastern alive, there would not bn nnough left to oversee an orderly liquidation of assets, inrluding planns and gate rights at major U.S. airports. 
Shugrue criticized tiH~ eredi­
tors for sneking liquidation, 
saying many of the airlinn's as­
sets would lose value if it were 
forend to sell them out of des­
peration. 
The two sidns prnsented their eases at a jammed hearing in Lif1and's Manhattan court­room. It was unclear when the judge would rule. 
Shugrue, a veteran airline ex­ecutive who was named by the court to run Eastern seven months ago, has sought to woo travelers with an aggressive marketing campaign that in­cludes heavily discounted seats for vacationers and first-class upgrades for anyone paying full eoach fare. 
Miami-based Eastern's traffic figures show more passengers are flying the airline, but it's still confronting enormous ob­stacles besides angry creditors and a debt exceeding $1 billion.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) ­The era of "fast buckaroos" is over in the savings and loan business, and the gov­ernment needs to work now on attracting private in­vestors to thrifts, the new chairman of the S&L trade group said Wednesday.

S&L rescue legislation en­acted 15 months ago has succeeded in ending thrifts' irresponsible growth, Don­aid Shackelford told the U.S. League of Savings Associa­tions, which completed its 98th annual convention. 
"The new guys coming in. the fast buckaroos-that's over," he said. 
However, the new law has failed to attract the in­vestors needed to reduce the government's risks, he said. Surviving S&Ls must attract new capital if taxpayers are to be insulated from future losses.

worried," Steinberg suggested. 
Shackelford, who was shunned by the league's leaders after he warned in 1985 that the insurance fund backing deposits was bankrupt, told S&L execu­tives that league policy now must coincide with public policy. 
Last year's law is forcing thrifts to increase their capi­tal and "we want capital standards that are as high as anybody who takes your mother's money, depositors' money," he said.

Bankruptcy Court charges that the collapsed Wall Street investment bank en­gaged in bribery, coercion, extortion, fraud and other il­legal activities that created huge losses for the savings and loans. 
The Federal Deposit In­surance Corp. and the Heso­lution Trust Corp. said they would seek to recover $750 million from Drexel and former Drexel junk-bond leader Michael Milken from two separate federal restitu­tion funds.

To Be Continued ... 
Orw key to a successful tnlevision series may be the ability of the program to rPITPatP situations that oceurred in the youth of the viewer. Although "The Wonder Years" has not demonstrated the quality of last year's episodes this season, the series eontinued popularity originates from its ability to present scenes universal to childhood. "The Flash" also functions in a similar manner. 
"The Flash" ean be seen on Thursday evenings at 8:30 P.M. on CBS. For much the same nmson that "Twin Peaks" could not obtain a popularity base on tlw Notrn I>anw campus. I firmly believe that no one will ever watch this program. "Cheers" will forever dominate our lives, but this continue reading this nvaluation of "The Flash" because it definitely is a program worth watching. 
Whiln "The Wonder Years" excites memories of youthful events, 'The Flash" presents the eomic book hero whose feats imitated as youths. The concept of the comic book hero is intrinsic to youth, and while you personally may not huvn had a closet bursting with old Fantastic Four comics, everyone pretnnded to bn Superman or Wonderwoman at one time or another. 
Tlw Flash may be a lesser known hero, but those familiar with the comic book scene claim that he is well-known in the inner circles, and his origins are common to all superheroes. 
"The Flash" uses the interchangeable parts of generations of comics. How did the Flash become the Flash? By an electrical storm creating an explosion in a scifmee lab, of course. Does the Flash have a girlfriend? Yes. Does she know of his powers? No, of eourse. Imagine a fast Spiderman who does not sling webs, and you have the Flash. 
The Flash is actually Barry Allen (John Wesley Shipp), a hard-working police dwmist in the Central City crime lab. His girlfriend Iris (Paula Marshall) has no due as to his identity. but she does know that her man is getting much closer to scientist Tina McGee (Amanda Pays). Tina is the one person who knows the secret powers that Barry possesses, and her assistance helps Barry deal with his more difficult situations. 
To deal with these situations the Flash has only his incredible speed, and as far as superhuman abilities go. This speed seems kind of weak. Despite this, Barry uses his talent fairly well in protecting the fair citizens of Central City.

Celtics hammer Hornets behind 45 points by Bird 
BOSTON {AP) -One night after his lowest point total in four years, Larry Bird scored 45 points and the Boston Celtics survived a late Charlotte comeback fOI" a 135-126 victory over the Hornets on Wednesday night. 
A 116-10llead with 7:35 re­maining dropped to 122-117 with 4:21 to play on Rex Chapman's driving layup. Boston's Kevin Gamble then made two free throws and the Hornets came no closer than five points the rest of the way. 
Bird, who had 5 points in a 119-91 loss at Milwaukee on Tuesday night, added eight as­sists, eight rebounds and five blocks against the Hornets.

to come back next year if they will have me." 
Holtz admits that the day-to­day pressures of coaching at Notre Dame have taken their toll on him, especially after winning a national championship in only his third year at the helm. 
"Sometimes I think you can win too early," he said. "The pressure mounts each and every game, each and every year. Frank Leahy was here three years, then went to war. Sometimes I think that's a relief. Nobody cares how rough the sea is, just bring the ship in." 
Short cornerback Rod Smith may have preserved more than Notre Dame's 34-29 victory last Saturday against Tennessee with his last-minute 
.. interception near the Irish goal line. He also may have earned back the starting position he lost to Reggie Brooks and freshman Greg Lane after Michigan wide receiver Desmond Howard burned him for six catches for 144 yards and two touchdowns in the season opener. "Rod Smith has excellent speed," Holtz said. "Whether you're talking Pat Terrell or whether you're talking Stan Smagala, he can run with any 
defensive back we've ever had here at the University of Notre Dame. 
"The ability to play the ball in the air has been his only handicap, but you talk about a 
76ers 112, Hawks 1 04 
Charles Barkley scored 34 points and grabbed 13 re­bounds as the Philadelphia 76ers turned back a late rally and defeated the Atlanta Hawks 112-104 Wednesday night. 
Philadelphia took its biggest lead of the game, 98-89'i on a layup by Rick Mahorn with 5:56 to play. The Hawks then went on a 9-2 spurt, closing to 100­98 on a driving layup by Dominique Wilkins at the 3:24 mark. 
But Barkley made a 3-point play and, after John Battle connected on a jumper, Barkley added a turnaround shot with 
1:47 remaining. 

Nets 112, Bucks 95 
Derrick Coleman scored a season-high 20 points and Mookie Blaylock got 8 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter Wednesday night as the New Jersey Nets snapped the cold­shooting Milwaukee Bucks' win streak at five games with a 112-95 decision. 
Cavaliers 113, Pacers 95 
Rookie Danny Ferry hit two quick baskets and passed to Craig Ehlo for a third during a 24-5 run in the second quarter as the Cleveland Cavaliers built a 22-point first-half lead and beat the Indiana Pacers 113-95 Wednesday night. 
worker, you talk about character, he's got everything you really like to see in an individual. Will he start on Saturday? I think there's a good chance that he will, but I won't say that he definitely will start." 
Philadelphia Eagles defensive 
linemen Mike Golic and Reggie White had more than a passing interest in Saturday's Notre Dame-Tennessee game. 
Golic, a graduate of Notre Dame, made a bet with Tennessee graduate White on the outcome of the game in which the loser would have to sing the opposing school's fight song. 
Fortunately for Golic, the Irish prevailed 34-29 and White was forced to sing the first three verses of the Notre Dame Victory March before a public audience.

Oklahoma, Duke advance with first-round NIT wins 
NORMAN, Okla. (AP) Oklahoma used a 16-0 run early in the first half to take control against New Orleans and the 15th-ranked Sooners rolled to a sloppy 95-65 victory Wednesday night in the first round of the Big Apple NIT. 
Terrence Mullins started the spurt with a 3-pointer and four other players scored during the four-minute streak that gave the Sooners a 21-4 lead. Mullins finished with 16 points, one of six Sooners in double figures. 
Oklahoma has no full-time starters back from a year ago, 
when it finished the regular season ranked No. 1, and that unfamiliarity was obvious at times. 
But the Sooners' pressing de­fensive style helped make up for some of the problems on of­fense. New Orleans committed 18 turnovers and shot 27 per­cent in the first half. For the game, the Privateers. had 32 turnovers and shot 40 percent. 
Oklahoma, which shot 44 percent overall, led by as many as 25 points in the first half be­fore settling for a 42-22 half­time lead. 
Tank Collins scored six points 
Iowa coach is frightened of Temple's tough squad 
IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -Iowa coach Tom Davis sees some­thing frighteningly familiar in the Temple team his Hawkeyes will play in the first round of the Big Apple NIT. 
The Owls remind him of the Michigan team that won the na­tional title in 1988, he said. 
Temple's lineup of guards Mark Macon and Michael Harden, forwards Mik Kilgore and Mark Strickland and center Donald Hodge bring to mind Loy Vaught, Terry Mills, Rumeal Robinson, Glen Rice and the rest of the Wolverines of two years ago. 
"They just remind me of Michigan's ball club with deep, tall talent," Davis said. "This is a very strong ball club. We

were very good, but we came 
... up short. "We are a better hockey team than we were three years ago when we went 27-4-2. We're not out to best that record, though -we'd be off to a bad start if we were. Our schedule is much more difficult now, but we are a better hockey team. The experience of the sopho­mores and juniors needs to show itself-they need to do the things that we need to do as a team." 
One of many players that Schafer hopes will key the Irish effort is junior center David Bankoske, who will return tonight after injuring his shoulder against Kent State. 
"David Bankoske only played a little bit last week, and we know he can score. We always have high expectations of him," noted Schafer. 
Last season, Bankoske led the 

know we've got our hands full." 
Temple coach John Chaney draws a blank about the Hawkeyes, though. 
"We don't have a clue about them. I've known Tom Davis a long time, and I know with him having to struggle with young players it will take some time to get going," Chaney said. 
Compared to Davis, Chaney is in an enviable position coming into the season. 
He returns five starters, headlined by Macon, a 6-foot-5 senior from Saginaw, Mich., who has scored 1,926 points in his career. That's more than all the lettermen on Iowa's team, who have combined for 1,425 points in their careers. 
Macon averaged nearly 22 points and six rebounds a game last year and helped lead the Owls to a 20-11 record and an NCAA tournament berth.. 
"Macon is being talked about by everybody as an all­American and an NBA lottery pick," Davis said. "He can jump over you, he can go around you, he can work you one-on-one, he can shoot from tremendous distance. He's capable of getting into the 30s with his scoring." 
As good as Macon is, Davis is just as concerned with Temple's front line of the 6-8 Kilgore, 6-9 Strickland and 7-0 Hodge. 
"They're NBA-type bodies," Iowa's coach said. 
Macon scored 26 points and Strickland had 17 points and eight rebounds in a 94-77 vic­tory over a Soviet national team in the Owls' only exhibition game. 
Unlike Chaney, Davis has a raft 
his team-leading totals were six multiple-goal games (including two hat tricks) and seven game­winning goals. Over the course of the 33-game season, Bankoske served only eight penalty minutes, despite playing in every game. As a freshman, Bankoske was tops on the team in assists (34) and total points (45). 
Left wings Mike Curry and Lou Zadra will also have to 
... 
have strong showings if the Irish are to survive the Beacon invasion. This season, Curry leads Notre Dame in scoring, with seven points (four goals, three assists). Zadra is second in scoring with five points (four goals, one assist). The Irish will also be counting on center Pat Arendt, who twice fueled Irish rallies last weekend with goals against Ferris State.
