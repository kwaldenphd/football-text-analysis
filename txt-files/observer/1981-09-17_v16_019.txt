Democrats t_ighten Party C(lntrol 
The House Democratic Caucus yesterday extended "amnesty" to renegade colleagues who voted for President Reagan's tax and budget cuts, but leaders said they'll exercise tighter party discipline in the future. The move came as Democrats in both House and Senate sought to resolve their internal differences and come up with a united front against Republicans in time for the 1982 elections. ''Nobody is going to be punished --nobody is going to be asked to leave the party,'' said House Majority Leader Jim Wright, D-Texas, after the closed-door session. But Wright added that in the future, only those toeing the party line on major issues will be guaranteed assignments in the Democratic-run chamber. The leadership's Steering and Policy Committee will designate the issues, Wright suggested. Of the occasionally stormy, three-hour session, House Speaker Thomas O'Neill, D-Mass., said, "It wasn't exactly a love feast, but we reached an understanding. --AP 
Communists attack Solidarity 
The ruling Communist Party Politburo, in its strongest attack yet on Solidarity, 1warned yesterday of a possibility of bloodshed and declared it would use all means necessary to prevent the independent _union.fro!? taking political P.ower in Poland. The party satd Solidanty, at Its first nattonal congress last week, had embarked on a course of "building an opposition political organization which openly set itself the goal of changing the political system of Poland." The congress called for .free elections, a national referendum on workers' reforms and sent a message of support to free trade union organizers elsewhere in the East bloc. The message of support brought a furious response from the Soviet Union and other East bloc news media, which have repeatedly criticized the Polish government and the country's year-long series of labor and social reforms. The Politburo accused the entire union of abandoning workers' interests and embracing those of "opposition and counter­revolutionary groups,'' such as KOR, the dissident Committee for Social Self-Defense and the anti-Communist Confederation of Independent Poland. --AP 

Director sets up office 
Sr. Evelyn Booms has been appointed Director of the Office of Handicapped Student Affairs of Notre Dame, announced Rev. John L. Van Wolvear, vice president for student affairs. Sr. Evelyn, the rector of the Pasquerilla East women's dormitory, has. temporarily established headquarters in the rector's office of Pasquerilla East (rm. 
626) with office hours from 12:30 to 2:00p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays. The office phone number is 283-7200. The advantages ofPasquerilla East as the temporary location for the office, according to Sr. Evelyn, are its proximity to the library and the accessability the new building's ramps and elevators afford to disabled persons. Aside from her presence in the office on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Sr. Evelyn intends to visit as many disabled students as possible "to learn from them how we can best serve them." Before becoming rector ofPasquerilla East, Sr. Evelyn was Superintendent of Schools for the Archdiocese of Santa

·visas denied to Cubans 
The Reagan administration denied visas to four top Cuban officials invited to a trade seminar because of Cuba's military involvement in Africa and elsewhere, the State Department said yesterday. Coming 24 hours after one o.f Cuban President Fidel Castro's most stridently anti­American speeches in years, the decision demonstrates the accelerating deterioration in relations between. the ~o countries. State Department spokesman Dean Ftsche satd the Immigration and Naturalization Act permits the executive branch to deny visas to aliens on foreign policy grounds. He cited u~s. opposition to Cuban intervention in Central America, Africa and elsewhere" as reasons for the denial. The identities of the Cuban visa applicants were not known although published reports have said two of them were the vice minister offoreign affairs and a senior adviser in the ministry of planning. Castro's speech o~ Tuesday, delivered at the inaus-ural session of a meeting of the Interparliamentary Unwn, provoked a walkout by the top 
U.S. diplomat in Cuba, Wayne Smith. A department spokesman said last week the administrat~on believc;s American representation at conferences 10 Cuba IS inappropriate as long as Cuba continues its "aggressive policies.'' In his speech, Castro said, ''Over the Reagan administration and its aggressive policy is the blood. . . of thousands of Salvadorans assassinated . . . hundreds of dead Angolans . . . hundreds of Libyans and Palestinians massacred --the blood of three peoples of the different continents." --AP

Federal Reserve 
U.S. needs to curb spending 
WASHINGTON (AP)--Fed­eral Reserve Chairman Paul Volker, vowing to stay on a tight-credit course, declared yesterday that President Rea­gan and the Congress have made only a "down payment" on deep budget cuts needed to drive down interest rates. 
Insisting there is no "Quick fix or painless solution that might send rates tumbling from their high levels, Volker said Reagan and Congress must find as much as $100 billion in spending cuts by 1984 to eliminate federal deficits and ease the demand for a limited supply of credit. 
In testimony before the Sen­ate Budjet Committee, Volker said the nation's central bank would not waver from its policy of rest~ictive money growth to 
squeeze inflation out ofthe U.S. 
economy. 
The I?rogress being made against mflation is too impor­tant to be halted now despite the economic suffering caused by high interest rates, he said. 
''1\ lasting resolution of our economic problems generally and the interest-rate problem ~~ particular, will be found only success in the battle against 
inflation," he said. "Indeed a sense of retreat would only aggravate the present prob­lems ... ," he added. 
Instead, Volker put the task o~ ~eagan and Congress to ehmmate government deficits, which he said are sustaining high interest rates by creating increased competition with private borrowers fot a limited pool of credit that is being kept tight by the Federal Govern-
German terrorists continue attacks on U.S. bases 
FRANKFURT, W. Germany (AP) --Two timebombs planted by terrorists were found and defused yesterday outside Rhein-Main Air Base, a main transit point for the 240,00 American troops in Europe. Meanwhile, West Germany's most feared terrorists took responsibility for trying to kill the U.S. Army's European commander. 
The planting of the explo­sives was the fifth incidenr aimed at Americans in West 
Germany in three weeks, and was presumed to be part of the terrorist Red Army Faction's self-proclaimed war "against .the American military 
machine.'' 
In the latest episode, Ameri­can soldiers found two fire extinguishers containing explo­sives and equipped with timers on a railroad freight spur less than half a mile from Rhein­Main.

ment. 
It is the government's seem­in.g voracious. cre~it appetite, with .0? en~ 1h Sight that is sustammg htgh retes, he said. 
Budget committee members, 
noting their constituents' grow­
ing anger over high interest 
rates, asked Volcker repeatedly 
if there are any faster solutions. 
"There is no quick fix," he 
replied. "We've got a problem 
that has literally built up over 
30 years .... The idea' that there 
is a rapid fix is just not realistic.'' He insisted that a loosening 
of the band's credit policies would only refuel inflatton and send interest rates higher as 
lenders rush to protect their investments. 
''Ifwe had no objective in the world other than to get interest rates down by Christmas" and the Fed pumped up the econ­omy's supply of money and credit, "the chances are very high that by Christmas, interest rates would be higher.'' 
He also rejected some calls in Congresss for credit controls, saying such remedies are arbit­rary, unenforceable and cause market disruptions that ''would likely only make the situation worse.'' 
Vokker noted that short-term interest rates have declined significantly in recent weeks, but long-term rates remain high despite a falling inflation rate. He said that is because bond markets do not believe Reagan and Congress can find enough spending cuts to offset the record three-year tax cut en­acted this summer.

''Another advantage to the program is that the response time will improve," Sergeant Larry Hostetler noted. ''The substations' response time should be cut down by at least 18 blocks, which is an improve­ment over the present system. 
Cheif Thompson emphasized that in order for this to be an effective program, he wants to create closer ties between the police and the local community --including the students of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's who live off campus. 
Sergeant Hostetler added that he would eventually like to implement a plan among off­campus students once the sub­stations have been established.

Each of the devices weighed 13 pounds. Police said the type of explosive had not been determined, and declined to say when the bombs were set to go off.

right to edit. 

The editorial world is up in arms over the Reagan crisis. "The panic," observes Mr. Tom Wicker of The New York Times, "is the panic of those who have followed Mr. Reagan not wisely but too well." And, op­posite, the editorial page said, "And how ungrateful it is for recent tax favors done. How unmindful of the Republican debacles to come. Socko! It's all very silly, of course, but understandable. After passing the largest tax and spending cuts in his­tory a month ago, the Republicans were popping with pride and already counting next year's election vic­tories. But the prospect of ever-larger budget deficits could not be hidden from investors. Now, with the finan­cial markets depressed, inflationary expectations still high and interest rates threatening recession, the presi­dent's party is seized with panic." 
Well, well. 

The record of the Reagan ad­ministration has yet to be made, and there are certainly visible piitfalls ahead. But the record of The New York Times about how to go about economic reform is, unfortunately for it, very much a matter of public record. 
During 1978, for instance, the Times vigorously opposed a diminu­tion in the capital gains tax rate. Congress nevertheless acted. A year later, on Dec. 4, 1979, The New York Times published an editorial:

Editor's Note: Ms. magazine was not the only publication to report er­roneously that The Observer ac­cepted a full-page advertisement from Screw magazine, and it has prompted questions from many of our occasional readers. Our regular readers will note that we have never run this advertisement -Screw 
merely sent us the layout for the ad, but in no way did we ever consent to run it, nor did we ever bill them for it. We do need revenue, hut not that badly. But wishing to publicize the fact that a renowned Catholic institu­tion such as ND was connected with Screw, even if it was not, that magazine's devious publicity depart­ment apparently sent out a press release saying that The Observer was one of only three college papers to accept the ad. We did not. And ifwe ever catch the & ($'who said we did

The "spice of life" that adds in­terest and romance to our existence is nothing more than a bothersome confusion of their normal routine. Part of Ann's routine is making salads for dinner. When that is upset-­when three salads are needed or when dinner has to be served early--adjusting is a major un­dertaking. She constantly re­minds herself of her new task and when she finishes, her face has the glow of a world record holder. 
"Did you like your salad today, Paul?" she will always ask, reminding me of what I know all too well: that she will to anything--anything--for a "thank you" and a hug. 
One of her greatest accom­plishments--an event that ironi­cally signaled that she was becoming more "normal"--oc­cutred this summer when she started her first job. She worked in a hospital laundry room folding towels, eight hours a day, three days a week. It wasn't a job that many would be proud of, but she bragged about it incessantly. 
On her first day she woke up my father at 6:30 and insisted that he give her a kiss goodby:e. 
She told him he had to do this every day because "that's the way they do it on Dick Van Dyke." 
She celebrated every pay day by taking the family out to dmner. The highlight" of every evening was the excitement in her eyes when she picked up the check, as if she were saying "I can't believe it!" and "Of course, why shouldn't I? at the same time. 
What she didn't spend on dinners, she would spend on us--treating us to movies and asking us to "have a beer" on her when we went out, often leaving her home, alone. Every­thing she owns has always been shared or given to the other people in her life. Now, as money is added to her list of possessions, it is not a symbol 
of power  or  status,  but  just  
another  way  of showing  her  
generosity.  

I have had the pleasure of meeting Ann's retarded friends a few times--too few. 
I have always come away from these experiences with a sense of loss, aware that I am perhaps missing something by not being closer to the retarded. Sometimes I even wonder what it would be like to become a member of their special group 
for a day. Along with that curiosity, though, is the fear that we are interfering with' their lifestyles. With each edu­cation and "integration" pro­gram we bring the retarded further into our world--cenainly a desireable accomplishment but in the process, we als~ impose our standard of matur­icy upon them. I can see their openness and honesty wane, their excitement and fascin­ation with life dissappear for the sake of what is "adult" and proP-er. I can't help but wonder if, when they are wor­kins, functional members of. soctety they will laugh together as they once did, before we "aged" them. 
Ann writes me once a week (of course, I am too busy with 
.important things to return any letters), and by the time she writes again she will have read this column due to the magic of the postal service. I can picture her next letter quite confidently and clearly: Dear Paul Kosi­dowski, How are you doing at Notre Dame? I read the article you wrote about me. I showed it to my friends. Thank you very very much. I love you, Ann. 
Ann seems to think that's what it's all about. And when you think about it--what could be more simple? 
Study in Mexico Broadens Horizons 
Last year at about this time I began to think about going abroad-to Mexico-for a semes­ter. I had heard the common stories about Mexico. You know, how they're said to be dirty, lazy, and JUSt not the type of people you'd want to get to know. I questioned the validity of such prejudices, but I still wasn't sure if going to Mexico and finding out for myself what the people and their culture were realy like was worth missing spring semester, and all that goes with it-things like basketball season, and AnTos­tal. After much consideration, I decided that my overall edu­cation would be enchanced, not lessened, by such an experi­ence, and with that decision, I said goodbye and was on my way. 
One might ask, ''What made the decision to go to Mexico so difficult?'' Well, there were several factors involved, most of them based on unanswered questions such as "Who will be my roommate next year if I'm not here for the lottery?" or ''Will I have a roommate? Or a room?'' another question was ''Will people recognise me with a moustache and sombrero, or be able to understand my Spanish-Hoosier accent? " Ser­iously, the biggest question of all was "Who will I be after such an experience?" 
Let me just focus on the last question (the others are much too difficult). I think the word that best exemplifies a healthy attitude toward education is openness. As students, we must allow our minds to be open to new ideas, to new experiences, and to new people. As a student in Mexico City, studying at Universidad Iberoamencana and livin~ with a Mexican family, I expenenced a new reality and quickly learned just how wrong those earlier prejudices were-that the Mexican people are anything but lazy or dirty, and that they're among the most sincere and generous people whom I've ever met. I also had the opportunirty to work in a small, rural community and made a couple of Urban Plunges in some of the slum areas (of which there are many) in the city. Finally, the semester was not all work, there was a visit or two to the coast. All in all, just being, in Mexico, opened my life to many new experiences. 
Kevin Walsh 
Study programs abroad are often described with such words as: exciting, challenging, frustrating, and eye-openins. My past semester expenence tn Mexico and Nicaragua with the Program in Global Community leads me to add another adjec­tive to the list--liberating~ By studying and actually living with people who are working to liberate themselves from pover­ty and other forms of oppres­sion, I was able to begin a sort of personal liberation process. 
The ftrstexample I saw was in the Mexican community where I lived for three months . The people there experience the daily realities of mjustice, and participate together as Chris­tians in the struffle for justice. There "Base Christian Com­munities," as they are known throughout Latin America, are the means by which people reflect OJ?. the.ir experience as a commumty m hght of the reading classes. 
Another, perhaps more ap­parent, example of the liber­ation process 1s the situation in Nicaragua. The revolution is over, but the liberation process goes on. The civil war was only the ftrst step in the elimination of oppression. The first major project of the new government was an attempt to free its people from the bonds of ignor­ance by implementing a mas­sive literacy campaign. This campaign increased the literacy rate from 49% to 88% in the first two years. The scope and complexity of the problems facing the nation are tremen­dous still, but there is hope to be gleaned from the day-to-day struggles for liberation of a determined people: 
-The people of Ntcaragua are in strong solidarity with others who struggle for justice, esp. their neighbors in E1 Salvadore. As if to aid in the liberation of the American people, both Mexicans and Nicaraguans re­peatedly told us to closely re-examine our structures of power, and to be spokesmen for change. 
Studying abroad is an effec­tive first step in one's personal liberation process. Through such close contact with another culture, we can see ourselves in what is often an unfavorable light. Fortunately, the people of these cultures are able to disagree with certain actions of the U.S. Government and A­merican buisinesses without feelin~ resentment toward the Amencan people as a whole.

We have the opportunity to take a look at ourselves from another culture's eyes, but are we afraid of what we might see?

Weekend 

Last week I recieved my calling in life. As one who has always believed that there is something to ftll my weekend hours with besides study, I was called upon to inform the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents about ''weekend enter­tainment.'' I am to use my own judgement and tasteful dis­cretion in deciding what is noteworthy enough to draw to your attention. Unfortunately, these two don't usually coincide. 
Naturally everyone has their own idea of what entertainment entails. lve seen it in many forms and am fearful of those that I've avoided. So, you will find that there are things going on that you will want to take part in and some that you won't. However, the purpose of this column is to inform you of what's going on. I'm not get­ting paid according to how many people · read this, or attend any activities. I'm not getting paid at all! 
Some of you have probably heard that Notre Dame is playing Michigan this Sat. A lot of people are making roadtrips, though the majority of them don't have tickets. 
City and the Program in Global Community in Cuernavaca are offered through the Center for Experimental Learning. There will be an Information Night on Thursday, September 17 at 7:30 
p.m. in the Library Lounge for anyone who is curious about these programs. For further information you may contact Marcia LeMay at CEL, 1100 Memon'a/ Library, x2788 
Those of us staying on campus can find a game watching party and catch it on ABC at 1:00 EDT. Earlier Saturday morning at 10:00, the Irish women's tennis team takes on Evansville at home. 
Movies on campus this week­end include Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Eyes of Laura Mars, and Hospital, which · is part of the Social Concerns Film Series. Close Encounters shows Friday night at 7, 9:30, and 12 in the Engineering Auditorium. Hos­pital shows Friday and Satur­day in Washington Hall at 7 and 
9:30. Saint Mary's is showing Eyes of Laura Mars Friday night in Carroll Hall, which is, for any freshmen who don't know, in Mad eleva Hall. 
Off-campus, the summer hit Raiders of the Lost Ark js still showing at University Park. Believe me, I know there is the problem of getting off-campus. So, here is another alternauve-­Van Lines. Every weekend ex­cept home football weekends Van Lines leaves N.D. circle on the hour Fridays starting at six and Saturdays at four. A de­tailed scedule of stops can be picked up in La Fortune. 
A ceramics exhibit, Indiana Fire II, opens at Moreau Gallery on Friday at 7:00. It runs through October 16. Weekly Bulla Shed mass for OC students starts Sunday at 7:00. Everyone is always welcome.

SAILING NEWS--In last weekend's meet at Wisconsin, the Irish finished fourth out of nine teams. only four races were run, however, as the lack of wind blew the meet away(?). "One more race and we might have won the meet,'' commented club president Jerry Daus. The "A" Division, led by skipper Phil Reynolds and crew Carol Silva, took first place in the meet. 
Skipper Chris Hussey and crew Daus took sixth place in the "B" Division. The Irish will host the 18"team Notre Dame Intersectional at Eagle Lake this weekend.
