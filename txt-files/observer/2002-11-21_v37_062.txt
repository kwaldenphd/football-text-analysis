INSIDE COLUMN 


Family ties keeg.spiritalive 

While I celebrate the success of the Notre Dame football team I have another team to be proud of this year. Making strides this year is Scecina Memorial High School's football team, which just hap­pens to be my Sarah Nestor alma mater. 
Scecina, a small Catholic school in Saint Mary's Indianapolis, was Editor not expected to do much of anything this year but has continually stunned their competition. Beating much larger schools from across Indiana my small little school from the city has made it to the semistate game. This Saturday Scecina takes on Southridge and is only two victories away from a state championship. 
No. I'm not one of those people obsessed with the "good ol' high school days" but having a sister who is cur­rently a sophomore at Scecina has allowed me to keep a link alive. This link to my high school has drastically changed since I graduated, but is maintained through my sister. This is especially true in regards to the foot­ball team since my sister Susan is a cheerleader, ensuring that I have to make it to at least one game. This is so I can both cheer her on and tease her. Believe me if you ever had to see her struggle to do a push up after the team scores, then you would make fun of her too. 
But as she strives to balance home­work, cheerleading, choir, student gov­ernment and what seems like a million other things it is fun for me to be able to share my experiences and wisdom [yes I am very wise] with my sister. Imparting knowledge about which teachers to avoid, especially the ones who charge you a dollar for having your shirt untucked, [remember this is a Catholic school with uniforms] and that a lunch should be packed every­day, because hot lunches from the cafeteria can be a little shady (as in unidentifiable]. 
Being the older sister I've never had to deal with being associated or com­pared to a sibling, as I got to be the first to have the new experiences. but for my sister this has not been true. Especially annoying to her is when she is accidentally called by my name in class. It's not even like my sister and I look a lot alike, she's four inches short­er than me, with dark hair and eyes, basically the complete opposite of me. 
One thing she has had that I never did while I attended Scecina was a successful football season and as my sister and her classmates experience the ups and downs of high school I can only hope that this weekend gives Scecina students, present and past, lasting memories. 
Good luck Scecina Crusaders!

SMC holds fair to promote study abroad opportunites 
By KA TE DOOLEY 
News Writer 
The Center for Women's lntcrcultural Studies will be host­ing a study-abroad fair today to highlight expanded international programs and services on Saint Mary's campus. 
The fair will feature informa­tion on both current and new abroad programs. Financial aid advisors and academic counselors will be available to show students that they can afford studying abroad and fit it in their schedule. 
Saint Mary's college created CWIL in part to emphasize the importance of intercultural expe­riences for the students. 
"President Marilou Eldred has mudc it clear that increasing the intcrcultural experience of the Saint Mary's students is an important part of our mission. Thanks to our faculty and CWIL, wn arc getting the opportunities to make going abroad more accessible to the students," said Elaine Meyer-Lee. director of International and lntercultural I.earning. 
Meyer-Lee's goals incorporate easier accessibility to financial aid funding and a wider variety of programs to help people get the true immersion experience that they desire. 
The new programs begin in the spring of 2003 and applications for these will be available at the fair. The new programs include a Greece summer study tour, a one­have already benefited from the credit Haiti spring break course abroad experience. and a Fremantle, Australia ''l think it is vital for eve11'one exchange program. to have some kind of experience

"We are making agreements with other programs in order to open more doors for Saint Mary's students to study abroad," Meyer­Lee said. 
Current study abroad programs offered at Saint Mary's include Maynooth, Ireland; Seville, Spain; Dijon, France; Innsbruck, Austria (through Notre Dame); Rome, Italy; a European Summer Study Tour and a Semester Around the World program. Students also do service projects abroad through the SURV center.

Along with the study abroad fair, Meyer-Lee has also started a resource center for abroad program information outside her office on the Saint Mary's College library mezzanine. 
"The center is filled with hooks, advice and information about going abroad," she said. "If you cannot attend the fair, but are interested in finding out more about the old or new programs, the resource center is the place to get information." 
The fair will be held today from 
4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. in the Stapleton Lounge.

ND chemistry professor earns national honor 
By HELENA PAYNE 
News Ediror 
Notre Dame chemistry profes­sor Dennis Jacobs will be named the U.S. profes.5or of the year for research and doctoral universi­ties by two prominent education­al organi­zations. 
"It's a g r e a t honor and it's hum­bling to be

thought of," Jacobs 
said in an interview. 
The award, given by the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, will be presented today at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. . 
Since 1988, Jacobs has taught in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Prior to that. he was a professor at Stanford University and the University of California at Irvine. 
At Notre Dame, Jacobs devel­oped the Chemistry 113/114 sequence that incorporates coop­erative learning with the typically lecture-based introductory chemistry course. 
"Chemistry 113 is a much more active course where stu­dents are engaged with discus­sion with each other in class," Jacobs said. 
He also inserts cooperative learning into other classes, which prompted senior Erin Carmichael to write one of the letters from Notre Dame to nomi­nate Jacobs for the teaching award. 
"He approaches teaching from a lot of different angles so what­ever your learning styles you can grasp the material." Carmichael said. 
Jacobs' latest educational pro­ject is Chemistry 331, "Chemistry in Service of Society," where stu­dents use science to confront a community problem: lead poi­soning. 
"Students are building off of and expanding their academic expertise," Jacobs said. 
The class, which works with the City of South Bend, Memorial Hospital, local company Greentree and the Center for Social Concerns, involves testing samples of dust, paint and soil collected from local homes. 
Jacobs said he wants to contin­ue challenging students to apply their classroom learning to thp, outside world. 
Carmichael, who helped Jacobs form Chemistry 331, said Jacobs commitment to students is why he deserves to be hon­ored. 
"Aside from being a wonderful professor, he really puts the stu­dents first," Carmichael said.

"I hung out for a while [and} I just enjoyed talking to different residents," said Wasmuth. "I kept [Dismasl in the back of my 
mind." 
Sturm happened upon a Dismas flyer at the Center for Social Concerns and said the program seemed like it might be for her. 
"I thought it sounded really interesting," said Sturm. "I came and visited and sat at dinner and talked to Maria." 
Students are a major factor in making Dismas a welcoming and supportive environment, said Kaczmarek. 
"Student residence really takes it from a halfway house into actually a community," said Kacmarek. "It has a huge impact." 
Kaczmarek said finding stu­dents to live at Dismas is some­times challenging because the Dismas program requires a mature, balanced caring stu­dent. 
"Students are the hardest to recruit," said Kaczmarek. "I think it takes some uniqueness [and] somebody who isn't preju­diced." 
According to the students, the chance to live and learn in a dif­ferent environment played a large part in their decision to live at Dismas House. "I wanted a different kind of experience senior year," Sturm said. "I was ready to be out of the dorms but I was also ready to live with non­students." 

In addition to a unique living experience, Wasmuth also cited the opportunity to live with peo­ple of diverse backgrounds as a key part of her decision to live at Dismas House. 
"I enjoy living here more because there's more to be learned on a day to day basis," said Wasmuth. "I was also ready to put myself in a

Many residents come to Dismas House through the state system while on parole. but all make a commitment to commu­nity living at the home. "You get to meet different people that have different goals and mind­sets," said Jessi.e Snowden. one ofthe home's residents. 
Learning from the diversity of backgrounds and experiences is a main part of the Dismas House opportunity, said the students. "It's different then being in a dorm because you're living with people who sometimes are struggling to find jobs," Sturm said. "[Sally and I] were both a little tired of the pettiness and sometimes the drama about things that really are not dra­matic." 
Along with shared diversity, the Dismas program helps peo­ple learn about themselves and break down traditional barriers, said the students. 
"You have to able to not look at the definition of a criminal or an offender as somebody that's that different from yourself," s a i d Wasmuth.

"You take with you skills on how to see people at eye level and see people for what they have to say and what they have to teach you," said Wasmuth. 
Both students intend to contin­ue to make service a part of their lives after they leave Notre Dame. 
"I want to do Teach for America or some type of teach­ing opportunity," said Sturm, who eventually plans on earning a law degree.

'61 grad confirmed as Labor Relations chair 
Special to The Ob,crver 
Robert Battista, a 1961 graduate of Notre Dame, has been confirmed as chair­man of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). 
Nominated for the position by President Bush on Oct. 4, Battista was confirmed by the U.S. Senate last week. His term extends until Dec. 16, 2007. 
"Battista is a renowned employment lawyer of the highest skill, experience and integrity," Robert Hunter, a former member of the NLRB and current director of labor policy for the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, wrote in an editorial. "We can expect to see great advancement in employee protections under his mature and balanced leadership. The president could not have made a wiser choice in appointing Battista." 
The NLRB is an indepen­dent federal agency created to investigate and remedy unfair labor practices by

employers and unions. It was created by Congress in 193 5 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law govern­ing relations between unions and employers in the private sector. The NLRB imple­ments the national labor pol­icy of assuring free choice and encouraging collective bargaining as a means of maintaining industrial peace. 
A graduate of the University of Michigan Law School, Battista has prac­ticed with the Detroit law firm Butzel Long since 1965. From 1985 to 1992, he was manager of the firm's Labor and Employment Law Group. 
He is a member of the Michigan advisory commit­tee of the American Arbitration Association, a fellow of the College of Labor and Employment Lawyers, and a member of the Michigan Employment Relations Commission's advi­sory committee.

IN BRIEF 
Oct. housing construction plunges 
Housing construction lost momentum in October, plunging by 11.4 percent, the biggest drop since 1994. 
But even with the sharp decline -which came after the level of housing construction shot up to a 16-ycar high in September -the number of housing units for which builders broke ground in October was still considered to be in the healthy zone. 
Builders began work on 1.60 million hous­ing units, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, representing a 11.4 percent decline in October from the previous month, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. 
While October's housing activity level was weaker than analysts were expecting, econo­mists predicted September's red-hot pace could not be sustained. Housing construction jumped by 11 percent in September to a rate of 1.81 million units, the highest level since December 1986. 

EchoStar, NBC settle legal problems 
EchoStar Communications Corp. and NBC have settled litigation over whether the satellite television company can broadcast local NBC channels from one city to another. 
Details of the settlement, which was announced Wednesday, were not disclosed. 
This is the second such move by the satel­lite TV company following a lengthy court battle. EchoStar settled with ABC in April. An EchoStar spokesman declined to com­ment on litigation with CBS and Fox. 
The networks sued Echostar in 1998 in Miami over the broadcast of distant network channels and accused Echostar of copyright infringement. 
They have argued that EchoStar should broadcast programming only from affiliates in each customer's viewing area. EchoStar contends that barring viewers from receiv­ing distant networks violates free-speech rights. 





United union yields concessions 
. Machinists for United Airlines approve cutbacks 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO 

The union representing 37,500 United Airlines machinists tentatively agreed Wednesday to $1.5 billion in wage and benefit concessions, giving United an important boost in its bid to stave off bankruptcy. 
The machinists were the only employee group not to have committed to its share of $5.8 billion in labor cutbacks over 5 1/2 years -the centerpiece of United's financial recovery plan. 
The financially ailing carrier hopes the cuts arc steep enough to persuade the government to grant a $1.8 billion loan guarantee United says it needs to avoid filing for. Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by year's end.

"My request to you is to get yourself in church and pray to God he for­gives you because you are mur­dering me," Chappell said. He also denied molesting a 3-year­old child that authorities said led him to commit the slayings. 
Jane Sitton, the mother of the girl and the woman who author­ities believe was Chappell's intended target in the shootings, watched the execution through a window. 
"You know damn well I didn't molest that child," Chappell said to her as the drugs flowed into his body. "You all are murder­ing me and I feel sorry for you. l don't know what else to say. Please go to church and say ...," he said, unable to complete his sentence. 
He was pronounced dead at 
6:17 p.m., 45 minutes after the 
U.S. Supreme Court denied his final appeals. 
Chappell was the oldest con­vict executed in Texas since the state took over capital punish­ment duties from counties in 1924. 
Authorities say Chappell broke 

He was sen­

"It's over and done with," Sitton said after watching Chappell die. "There's no more chance of appeals. There's no more chance of something get­ting thrown out on a technicali­ty, which happened to us before." 
In Missouri, William R. Jones was executed earlier Wednesday for killing Stanley Albert, a man he met at a Kansas City park frequented by gay men. 
Prosecutors said Jones plotted the killing after dating Albert and deciding he wanted his Camaro. Jones shot Albert five times and dumped the body near a nature center. The defense contended Jones shot Albert in self.defense after the man made unwanted sexual advances. 
On Tuesday, Texas executed Craig Ogan, 47, by injection for the 1989 slaying of a Houston police officer. Two more execu­tions are set in Texas this year, both in December.

puters pose "one hell of a potential security problem." 
"There's no way they can assure us those computers didn't have classified informa­tion on them," said Stockton, who was a special assistant to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson -now New Mexico's governor-elect -in the Clinton administration. 
The inventory of missing items also included two print­ers whose custodian was listed as Wen Lee. There was no immediate confirmation as to whether that person was Wen Ho Lee, a former scientist who was fired and accused of lab security violations in down­loading nuclear codes. 
No other employee by that name appears on a lab tele­phone list. 
Lab spokeswoman Linn Tytler did not respond on Wednesday to repeated requests for comment on the Lee notation and the memo overall. 
"I haven't heard anything The · memo 
from the nuclear weapons laboratory's chief financial officer, dated April 10 of this year, was dis­tributed anonymously. Stockton said he believed it was from the same lab employ­ees who released another memo earlier. 
The whistleblowers daim that lab leaders have been cov­ering up criminal activity including credit card, purchas­ing and voucher fraud. 
The Department of Energy's Office of Inspector General was at the lab this week investigat­ing allegations of wrongdoing. 
The Albuquerque Journal reported Sunday that internal lab documents indicated nearly $3 million worth of lab-owned items disappeared or were reported missing between 1999 and 2001. The newspa­per cited a March report from the lab's Office of Security Inquiries. 
The April 10 memo from Thomas M. Palmieri, the lab's chief financial officer, cited "disturbing negative trends regarding Laboratory manage­ment of Government property." 

It said missing property from the budget year 2001 inventory totaled $723,000 -nearly triple that of the previous year -and lost or stolen property totaled $533,000. 
"We are still trying to account for these items," the memo said. 
"Neither the Lab or DOE, can accept $1.3M in unaccounted property. We must do a better job protecting and accounting for the Government property that we manage for DOE," Palmieri wrote. 
The memo said corrective action plans were to be devel­oped. 
"Our intent is that property management at this institution be a non-issue a year from now," the memo said. 
Inventories attached to the two memos listed missing property including computers, cellular telephones, cameras and copiers, as well as more technical equipment. 
Steve Aftergood, who coordi­nates the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists said any information left on those computers would be so specialized that it would be "useless or even incompre­hensible" to the average user. 
But it's a different matter if the computers fell into the hands of foreign intelligence personnel, Aftergood said. 
If nothing else, Aftergood said, the situation "illustrates a serious flaw in the security procedures at the lab -and if this particular incident did not pose a threat, it suggests that a future incident could well do so, unless the defects are corrected."

CAL TOPS 'CANES IN LATEST POLL 


Can the 'Canes repeatl Can theSooners make it two out of the last three? Who will win the 1-Ieisman? How many polygons does a Butkus Award winner get? Where is Berkeley? The answers to these (No. No. Look to Texas. Thousands. Take 1-80 west and follow the signs.) and other pressing questions can be found in this year's College Football Top 25 poll: 
1 CAL 
So they went 1-1Olast year. Big deal. Serious time spent in the Blue Chip Recruiting Mode has made this team into a rough bunch on the gridiron. That combined with a new Power I fonnation adds an unexpected threat for this tum-around team.

How good is this team? Eight or nine oftheir starters should be in NFL Game Day·· next year. The 'Canes may have the toughest schedule in football, with games against Florida, Tennessee, Virginia Tech and the Florida State Seminoles. About the only qual­ity teams not on their schedule are in the NFL. 
3 OKLAHOMA 
New Hot Routes can put the 2000 NCAA champs right back at the top. Which means almost as much to this Sooner team as beating their heated rival, the Nebraska Comhuskers. 
4 COLORADO 
Will the Buffs defend their Big 12 crown using the wishbone? The flexbone? The full house? Only the coach controlling the play­book knows for sure. 
5 TENNESSEE 
New high-low tackling might give the Volunteers their toughest defense in years. 
6 TEXAS 
Can their quarterback capnue the 1-ieisman Trophy against what may be the toughest conference in Division I football? Can the defense come up Texas big? Not even our highly evolved artificial intelligence can answer that one. 
FLORIDA

Look for the Bruins to utilize a sensational receiving core and Hot Routes to vie for a national cham­pionship. Then look for them to vie for a championship all over again in NCM Final Four' 2003. 
10 UNIV. OF TOLEDO 
A great run in Career Mode gets these overachievers a major RCS Bowl bid and a Top 10 finish. And their coach the chance to take over a major college powerhouse. Enjoy that animated contract, coach, 
11 WASHINGTON STATE 
A strong passing offense makes them a team to beat. Explosive gameplay makes this perennial Pac IO little brother into a legiti­mate head-turner. WAZZU is ready to tangle with the big boys. 
12 ALABAMA 

The Crimson Tide has the polygons and offensive line to muscle anyone in college foot­ball. If that's not enough, new high-low tackling gives their defense the bite it needed. 
13 OREGON 
Blue Chip recruiting made the loss oftheir200 I Heisman can­didate easier to stomach. A new wishbone offense could help the 2002 Ducks rain on just about anyone's parade. 
14 OHIO STATE 
More control over the running game puts them at the top oftheir conference. But they must beat arch-rival Michigan for the Big 10 Conference title first, which won't be easy, but definitely a possibil­ity for the Buckeyes. 
15 WASHINGTON 
Unproven defense must come through for a Rose Bowl berth. Total Control Passing gives this Husky team a very potent attack. 
16 LSU Tigers are looking to claw their way to another SEC title. 
Louisiana State University's pass-and run-blocking is top­notch this year. ­
Just avengethe Colorado University mauling and beat the Sooners for all to be right in Huskerland. 
18 USC 

19 BOISE STATE 
Say hello to the first "Houston Bowl" winner. Increased frame rates show that this year these boys are definitely on their way up. 

Old coach sacked in Career Mode. Tigers should improve drastically 
on both sides ofthe ball. 
21 SOUTH CAROLINA 

Lots ofexcitement building for 'Cocks this year. Volatile offense could be a threat with the addi­tion of a full-house formation. Could make some noise this year, despite the fact that they are in a tough conference. 
22 MARSHALL 
A weak schedule equals strong wins. Will Keith Jackson, in GameBreaker's booth, call them "rumbling" or "bumbling"? 
23 TEXASA&M 
Several players converted to defense. Too bad they're in the country's toughest conference. 
24 LOUISVILLE 
Gamebreakers on both sides of the ball. Look for the Cardinals to go to their Wing T offense for big points. Look for them to top Conference USA. 
Same classic CCI unifonns. Same classic stadium. Same classic coach. Same classic spot in polls.

Officials said they hoped the oil would solidify two miles down in frigid water, limiting damage in the short­term. 
The Prestige has spilled about 1.6 million of its 20-mil­lion gallon load of heavy fuel oil, a total twice the size of the 
miles of 
Galicia's scenic 
coastline and rich fishing waters. During a visit to a soiled beach near the fishing port of Caion. he esti­mated economic losses at $42 million so far, and said the cleanup could take six months. 
"We have to wait and be pru­dent because we still don't know whether we have passed the threshold of this crisis," Matas said. 
Crews with shovels and buck­ets worked in strong wind and heavy rain to scoop up sludge along Galicia's craggy coast. 
The government said more than 250 tons of fuel oil had been recovered so far. half on land and half at sea by skim­mer boats. 
Rough seas kept two of the vessels -sent from France and Holland -out of the mis­sion Wednesday, the interior ministry said. 
In some coastal areas not yet hit by the fuel oil. seafood farmers rushed to harvest mus­sels, clams and cockles ahead of schedule. Spain's fishing industry is worth $330 million a year. 
In the inlet of Ria de Arosa, described as one of the world's top mussel grounds, harvesters pulled up ropes on which clus­ters of black mussels grow, and plucked them all. Normally smaller ones arc left behind to mature. 
"The accident has hit us very hard," said Francisco Gomez, a 41-year-old fisherman in the viUage of Cosme. "The conse­quences are going to last a long time, at least two years." 
Luis Ferreira, 42, was pes­simistic and recalled that the people of Galicia have a long history of emigration, often to Latin America. "If the situation does not change we will have to pack our bags, just like our ancestors did." 
He accused the government of understating the amount of oil in the water and said officials don't know the sea. "They only go there on vacation," he said.

It was four weeks ago that I met Danny J. Being homeless, he spent the time we shared over coffee at McDonald's telling me about St. Mungo's, the place he hoped to stay that night.

and he was walk­ing the streets ask­ing for change. He story was shady, but I was humbled the next day to find a website on St. Mungo's -London's largest homeless agency. I resolved to visit the place that gives 1,200 people like DJ a place to sleep at night. 
On Halloween night, I rode on one of the big red buses to a London neigh­borhood. I passed trick-or-treaters dressed as dead soccer players, ghouls and she-devils who asked me for candy and found the sign: "St. Mungo's ­Central Office." 
The neighborhood street was quiet, but the work that takes place within is earthshaking. 
St. Mungo's leads London's services for people who are homeless and vul­nerable. Their 11 hostels offer food for the body and companionship for the soul. Forty-five supported-housing schemes support tenants who are expected to cook, clean and shop for themselves, while staff members visit regularly to help with practical mat­ters. One hundred fifty-six residents with serious mental and physical health problems stay in locally-funded high-care homes. Resettlement and community support teams help people integrate into their own flats. Skills Training, Employment and Placement Services teams provide the employment skills needed to reenter the labor force. 
St. Mungo's comforts the wounds of homelessness. However, more is need­ed to alter the factors that cause home­lessness. The solution for many is what's known as the Big Issue. 
To some, the Big Issue is their means to a revitalized lifestyle. To others, the Big Issue is a source of current per­spectives on politics, business trends and new films. 
The Big Issue is a magazine that the homeless can sell for profit. They sign a professional code of conduct and form a sales pitch to become vendors. I first talked to a vendor when wander­ing home from a museum after an art history class. A clean-shaven man in a flannel shirt with a badge around his neck was standing on a street corner and holding out an issue. He appreciat­ed the magazine, saying, "It puts a lit­tle money in me pocket." He had bought each issue at 40 pence to be sold at £1.20 for a 65 percent commis­sion. 
The idea behind the Big Issue is sim­ple but phenomenal. The publication identifies and combats the lack ofjob qualifications which is a major obstacle to rehabilitation. Instead of judging the homeless as helpless people needing free services, the publication has faith in their potential and empowers them to be contributing members of society. 
The magazine has had an inspira­tional story since its inception. The idea for the publication came from Gordon Roddick of The Body Shop d ur­ing a visit to the United States when he saw Street News, a newspaper sold by the homeless in New York. With the assistance of The Body Shop International, Roddick teamed up with 
A. John Bird, whose own life had been resurrected from homelessness in London. Together they launched the first issue in 1991. 
Currently, the Big Issue Magazine sells 250,000 copies a week and is read by over one million people. The publi­cation now has branches in Australia, Scotland, South Africa and Los Angeles. The venture has given literally thousands a route out of social exclu­sion. The project proves that given the opportunity, the disadvantaged do want to work to improve their lives. 
The magazine's success has lead to a foundation that provides additional services. Financial training and voca­tional education promote practical liv­ing skills. Workshops rebuild self-confi­dence with creative work in various areas such as drama and photography. These innovative efforts have prove an important fact: business can be a key power for doing social good. 
There are 50 efforts in the United States similar to the Big Issue. One called StreetWise is based on South Michigan Avenue in Chicago. Graduates, who often note the lack of passionate faith after Notre Dame. can keep their souls engaged by putting their various skills to the test with SteetWise's larger Volunteer Network. 
Feeding the homeless at a shelter like St. Mungo's or teaching them job skills with the Big Issue show two types of service. Direct service comforts the pains from social problems, with activi­ties such as food drives for the hungry. Conversely, social action addresses the core causes of those problems. by edu­cating disadvantaged children. for example. Acting with these two feet of service is the mantra of the CSC ser­vice-learning seminars, and both bring out the thrill of being alive. 
With our Notre Dame background, we will have the great power to direct­ly comfort people like DJ or to be phil­anthropic greats like Gordon Roddick. 
Recognize your divinity, for you are God's answer to someone's prayer. So, what will you do?

Proposed ban on homosexual priests will create, not solve, problems for the Church 
On Nov. 6, the Vatican press office released a statement acknowledging a new internal document thal is being con­sidered that. if passed, will attempt to exclude homosexual men from becoming priests. In its cur­
Richard

rent form, the doc­ument stales that

seminaries should screen men with

"homosexual ten­
Perspective

dencies" from join­ing. 
Response to the document has varied widely, but I for one feel that fact that the document is even being considered is an insult to many Catholics. Not only does it falsely place blame for I.he Church's scandal on homosexual priests, but banning homo­sexuals from the priesthood will only serve to further alienate a population which has been repeatedly ostracized by the Catholic Church. 
To begin, the idea of blaming the recent scandal on homosexual priests has little logical basis. Even though many of the children molested were boys, in-depth research has never found a link between homosexuality and pedophilia. Likewise, it has been shown that there is little correlation between an adult's sexual preference and the gender of his chosen victims. While pedophiles tend to chose victims of one gender, that chosen gender seems to be linked to many outside variables much more than adult sexual preference. 
As with almost all things in life, sexual­ity does not affect the way one acts. This is especially true of most things relating to the priesthood. For one thing, all priests are required to live celibately. Whether their secular relationship choic­es may have been of different genders, all priests -gay or straight -must give up those types of relationships as part of their vocation. How then does one's the­oretical sexual preference make any sort of difference'? 
Along a similar line, I have also heard that gay men should not be priests because an integral part of the priest­hood is the sacrifice of a wif'e and chil­dren, something that a gay man wouldn't have anyway. 
This logic is also flawed, however, since while it is true that based on Church doctrine gay men should not be engaging in homosexual activities, celi­bate gay relationships are considered acceptable. Jn fact, several Catholic groups, such as Dignity, encourage just such a relationship. Giving up this possi­bility is just as much of a sacrifice for a gay man as giving up the possibility of a wife for a straight man. 
Besides, this reasoning also reduces the priesthood to a matter of sexual sac­rifice; whereas I would think that being a good priest is a lot more about your per­sonal relationship and calling with God than about what you have given up for it. 
Secondly, the idea of banning gay priests is likely to backfire on many lev­els. In regards to the recent scandal, a ban on homosexuality will likely end honest discussion and communication about any sexuality, a situation that is likely to breed the type of hostile envi­ronment that lead~ to the kind of abuse that the church is trying to prevent. Instead of allowing seminarians and priests to deal openly with their sexuality and to come to healthy terms with it, they will instead be forced further into the closet. Instead of having emotionally healthy priests who have dealt with their sexuality. we will have people who are suffering in silence and unable to appro­priately cop'e with their stresses and feelings. 
But it is not only the gay priests who will be suffering because of this docu­ment. The Catholic Church does not have the best track record with homosexual members as it is, but this would likely cause a large rethinking on the part of many gay Catholics. In recent times the Church has seemingly made progress towards respecting and welcoming gay members, especially on the more local­ized levels. This document would basi­cally negate all these recent efforts. 
How could the Church continue to preach that we should love our homo­sexual brothers and sisters while at the same time discriminate against them? 
The recent scandals have caused a lot of controversies in the Catholic Church and have brought out a number of issues that need to be dealt with. The Catholic Church was caught off-guard. and now it is looking for a way out. Instead of accepting the blame for what has hap­pened, the Church is instead trying to place it on others. This "step forward" they are proposing is really just the opposite. 
Gay Catholics arc already leaving the Church because of feelings that they are unwelcome and not understood. Falsely blaming homosexuals for an unrelated scandal and banning them from taking an active part in the religion will only further these feelings and cause more dissension. This document does nothing to solve the current issues or to even help them along; instead, it harms an already injured population and serves to skirt the Church's real responsibilities.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Arbitrary sanctions on Iraq exist only to control oil 
I am deeply disturbed and offended by Dan Lindley's Nov. 18 letter concerning sanctions on lraq,"llls caused by sanctions don't make war wrong." Saddam Hussein did not choose sanc­tions. Instead, sanctions were imposed against Iraq in response to the invasion of Kuwait and were to be lifted upon the with­drawal of Iraqi forces from that country. 
There have been no Iraqi troops occupy­ing Kuwait for the last 11 years, but the sanctions have not been lifted. Instead, the criteria for lifting the sanc­tions was changed to require the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruc­tion. 
By the mid 1990s, U.N. inspec­tors were reporling that task had been basi­cally accomplished, despite Iraqi obstruction. Contrary to pop­ular perception, the inspectors were not ordered out by the Iraqi government, but with­drawn by the U.N. to prepare the U.S. bomb­ings of December 1998. Meanwhile, the criteria for lifting the sanctions had again been changed to require the elimination of Iraq's capability to build chemical and biological weapons. This requirement led the inspectors to burn biology Lext books -the very same sort of books that many Notre Dame students will be purchasing at the Hammes Bookstore in preparation for next semester's biology classes. 
There is a pattern here. Every time Iraq has gotten close to fulfilling the requirements of lift­ing the sanctions. the criteria have been 
changed to make it impossible for Iraq to comply. The latest resolution goes even farther by demanding total Iraqi compliance without making any provision for lifting the sanc­tions at all. Let's be honest. The 
sanctions are being manipulated by the West, and the United States in 
particular, to control the Iraqi oil supply and the economic power that goes with it. To claim that Saddam Hussein 
"chose" the sanctions is nothing more that a transparent attempt to 
place the United States on the moral high ground and avoid admitting that we as a 

nation are complicit in the mur­der of half a million innocent chil­dren. 
To hear a professor of Notre Dame make the claim is deeply disappointing. This is one of the best Universities in the country. I think that we have a right to expect better from our pro­fessors.

Give the basketball team the support it deserves 
As one of the few who actually went to the first two mens basket­ball games, I have been appalled by the abysmal student turnout. While I recognize that the early-season slate is not exactly filled with national title contenders, it is more than ridiculous that fewer than 500 students, of the more than 3,000 with tickets. managed to drag themselves away from their precious lab reports to cheer on their fellow students for the first two games. 
Trying to gather guys from my dorm to go to the games, I have encountered mostly whiny pleas from people who claim to have "too much work." This is quite affi'fddffd tired excuse, and l assure you that the two hours of work you might miss at the game are not going to cause your GPA to plummet. 
As anyone who looks at the pictures in the Joyce Center's display cases can see, there was a time not long ago when over half of Notre Dame's undergrads packed the Joyce Center and screamed for two hours, making it one of the toughest places in the country to play and allowing the Irish to pull off some stunning victories. The stu­dent tickets the administration allots us sold out quicker than ever this year, but this means nothing unless we actually go to the games. 
As anyone who's followed us under Coach Mike Brey or attended the last two games knows, we have a talented, explosive and young team that is not far from becoming an elite squad. It needs our sup­port to help make the Joyce Center a tough place to play again. So put down your books. gather your friends, realize life needs a little fun and go scream for the Irish for a couple of hours. 
If 8,000 can rightfully pack the student section to watch our out­standing football team crush Rutgers, then there is no reason why 3,000 shouldn't pack the Joyce Center for every basketball game. We play at 9 p.m. Friday, leaving plenty of time for partying both before and after the game. Be there.

The film follows her unconventional and often rocky relationship with her husband, Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) who also served as her confidant, comrade, and mentor, as the pair took the art world by storm. From her complex and enduring relationship with Rivera to her controversial affair with Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush), to her bisexuality, and her illuminating and visceral interpretations of her life, the film attempts to capture, and does with some success. the enigmatic force that was Frida Kahlo. 
Director Julie Taymor's trademark surreal touches blend seamlessly into the biography of this Mexican painter and 20th century icon. The first is a nightmarish sequence of chattering skulls, which represent a part of Frida's consciousness immediately after her accident. They culminate in a scene wherein Taymor uses a clip from one of the old "King Kong" movies, replacing Rivera's face for the great ape's, and Frida's own for the damsel in distress. 
The surrealism also helps to give a feel for the beauty and macabre of Frida's work. (After a miscarriage, Frida insists on painting her dead child.) It also allows for amazing tran­sitions between canvas and film. Often in the film, Taymore takes Frida's original artwork and recreates the scene, using the same dress, back­ground, hairstyle. lighting etc., and slowly, seamlessly, fades from the canvas to the scene, or vice versa. (It's an amazing, and startling, effect.) 
The colors she chooses are also spectacular. My favorites are when Frida's peasant dress, green and magenta, is caught hanging out to dry just as it begins to snow on an after­noon in New York City, and also in a hotel in Paris, when Taymore chooses to color the stained-glass fixtures and canopy in the atrium, but leaves the people in sienna shades of light. 
The most beautiful and terrible scene in the film is immediately after the accident wherein Frida lays motionless on the floor of the trolley, impaled from behind, bleeding, and covered with the gold dust spilt by a miner who was also a passenger in the crash. 
Hayek and Molina both give good performances; however, neither has what it takes to fill the tall order each is presented with in playing Frida and Rivera. Hayek comes off as being too sweet and too pret­ty (which Frida definitely was not), and Molina pre­sents a Rivera who could be passed off for a Mexican Santa clause with a paint­brush. The acting in this film is by no means exceptional. but what it lacks in quality it makes up for in quantity of talented actors who appear on the screen. 


Ashley Judd plays Tina Modotti, a famed Italian pho­tographer, Antonio Banderas plays David Alfaro Siqueiros, an artist and Rivera's rival, and Edward Norton plays Nelson Rockefeller, who famously contracted Rivera to paint the lobby mural of Rockefeller Center, only to renege because it included a portrait of Lenin. 
Others in their eclectic cir­cle of friends included Russian leader and refugee Leon Trotsky (Rush) just before Stalin had him assas­sinated, muralist Jean Charlot, painter Pablo O'Higgins, composer Silvestre Revueltas, photog­rapher Edward Weston, and briefly singer Josephine Baker, with whom Frida sup­posedly had an affair. 
The cinematography and score are also well done. Rodrigo Prieto ("8 Mile," "Original Sin") does an excellent job with the lively colors of Mexico and the art­work in the film. as well as with the contrast between Frida's home and the cooler, grayer skies of New York and Paris.

Despite the film's beauty and compe­tency, some­thing is lack­ing in "Frida." 
First, even though Frida Kahlo died at a relatively young age, Hayek doesn't age at all in this film. Her dewy skin and youthful optimism stay afresh throughout her lifetime. Also, the film does not succeed in fully cap­turing the essence of the main charac­ter, as other epics such as Richard Attenborough's "Gandhi" and although "Frida" is candid about her life, it is not candid enough or in the right way for this particular figure. 
Hollywood succeeds too much in making her lovable and domesticat­ed when Frida. as a 
bisexual alcoholic artist, was anything but. However, the film does seem to capture a bit of the Van Gogh-like madness she exhibited in her self-por­traits (look for the one right after she has cut off her hair). 
The film also does not address the unresolved issues surrounding her death, which many believe was caused by her own hand. 
L_ __ _ 
The real Frida may have been attractive, but she was by no means so in any conventional sense. Often painting herself in men's suits with her hair cropped, or bleeding from self-inflicted wounds, and always sporting her infamous brow, it is easy to confuse what is interesting about Frida for what is beautiful. 
Taymor and the writers of this film, through the course of events in her life, try to crystallize Frida into an injured butterfly, when what she real­ly seems to be is a night-winged crea­ture. 
Both sadistic and selfish, absorbed and alcoholic, pathetic and powerful, sharp and sensuous, Frida Kahlo is not a creature anyone can easily cast light upon, and while this film does an admirable job, it is no exception.

Potter's 'Chamber' captures everything but the soul 
ByJACK WATKINS Scene Movie Cricic 
Children, Harry Potter fans, and fanta­sy addicts will find much to love in "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", but it might just not be worth it to anyone else. 
Director Chris Columbus's follow-up to last year's hit "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" lacks the thrill and charm of the original, relying on the audience's supposed familiarity with the novels to keep interest high. The result is nn oddly soulless movie that drags for much of the first half before the inher­ent strength of J.K. Rowling's story picks up the film and carries it through an exciling and special-effects tilled climax. 
The story is that Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), upon returning to Hogwarts for his second year, encounters a plot to eliminate students of non-wizard her­itage, including his friend Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). 
In the novel, the nature of the plot gives us a glimpse are merely hinted at. 
Beyond that, much of what was wondrous in the first "Potter" has lost its impact. In fact, the movie often seems formulaic. 
Several scenes from the first film are repeated: Harry's obnoxious relatives. Quidditch, a trip into the dark forest, Harry cowering under his invisibility cloak, etc. The nov­els avoid this problem because the depth of the content is var­ied, even if there is a certain formula for it's presentation, and because, after all, the nature of life at a school is for­mula. But it is simple truth that what is a non-intrusive formula in a 250-page novel is stifling in a two-and-a-half hour movie. 
The actors, on the other hand, cannot be blamed. It is astonishing that a film that relies so heavily on young actors can be so

Columbus's apparent need to cram in every possible second of special e!Tects, the movie omits these scenes, and the themes that give the book its meaning The returning adult actors do fairly well: Robbie Coltrane and Alan 
Rickman (Hagrid and Snape, respective­ly) are again the standouts. The additions to the adult cast also acquit themselves well. Jason Isaacs is 
perfect as the sneering, villainous Lucius Malfoy, and Kenneth Branaugh gleefully hams it up. The treatment of minor characters is disappointing: many char­acters from the novel are included for a brief cameo, as a treat for the book's readers. This has the unfortunate side­effect of making the screenplay feel oddly like a role-call -a character appears in a scene, someone (usually the late Richard Harris) intones their name, they smile and nod, and speak a line or two, and are forgotten. 
There's still quite a bit of good in the film. The second half of the movie recaptures the urgency and fun of the first film, and, of course, for Harry Potter fans, it's practically a must sec. After all, the book's readers don't need to be drawn into Harry's world, or have the book's points of interest highlighted for them. But the average movie-goer looking for a fantastic adventure would probably do better to wait for "The Two Towers."

NBA 
Delk, Williams each score 21 to lead Celtics to victory 
Asrociated Press 
BOSTON 

Tony Delk and Shammond Williams each scored 21 points to lead the Boston Celtics to a 96-79 victory over the New Jersey Nets on Wednesday night in a rematch of last sea­son's Eastern Conference finals. 
Delk went 6-for-7 from 3­point range, and Boston made 14-of-25 from the arc to snap a two-game losing streak. Paul Pierce had 18 points and 13 rebounds, and Antoine Walker added 16 points. but it was the first time this season that nei­ther of them Jed Boston in scor­ing. 
Jason Kidd scored 19 points and Dikembe Mutombo had 13 rebounds for the Nets, who scored just 14 points on 4-for­22 shooting while giving the game away in the third quarter. 
Rodney Rogers, who played for Boston at the end of last year before leaving as a free agent, had 10 points and eight rebounds. 
The teams did nothing to calm the budding rivalry that flourished in last year's play­offs, when the Nets bristled at Boston's behavior after their epic, 26-point collapse in Game 
3. Taunts directed toward Kidd's wife and son by the Celtics fans brought emotions to the boiling point before the Nets won in six games and advanced to the NBA Finals. 
Wednesday's rematch lacked the importance or the drama of that series, as the Celtics took a double-digit lead with a pair of 11-0 runs in the third quarter and never looked back. 
The Celtics led 44-39 early in the third before scoring 11 con­secutive points, getting a dunk from Tony Battie, two 3-point­ers from Pierce and one from Delk. Later in the third, Boston turned a 60-48 lead into a 22­point game with another 11-0 run, punctuated by a break­away dunk by Williams with 5 seconds left in the quarter. 
Williams was called for a technical foul -the fifth in the game -for hanging on the rim, and Kidd sank the free throw to make it 73-51 heading into the fourth. New Jersey cut it to 14 in the fourth on Kenyon Martin's three-point play, but the Celtics wou1d not reprise the Nets' unprecedented col­lapse in last year's playoffs. 
San Antonio 95, LA Lakers 88 
Stephen Jackson made eight straight 3-pointers and scored a career-high 28 points as the San Antonio Spurs rallied for a 95-88 triumph over the sputter­ing Los Angeles Lakers. 
Jackson missed his first 3­point attempt but made his next eight shots from beyond the arc. The third-year forward eclipsed his previous career high of 25 points set against Atlanta on December 26, 2000. 
Jackson kept the Spurs (8-4) in the game for the first three quarters and Tim Duncan stepped up when San Antonio needed it. 
The Lakers held a 70-67 lead entering the fourth quarter, but Duncan, who had just six points through three periods, scored six of the Spurs' first eight points. 
With Duncan and Jackson clicking, San Antonio opened the quarter with a 22-8 run and coasted thereafter. Jackson capped the spurt with a 3-point­er that made it 89-78 with 3:24 to go. 
Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant criticized his teammates follow­ing a lackluster loss to Dallas on Tuesday. Again without star center Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles played hard but had lit­tle chance when Duncan joined Jackson on the offensive end. 
Bryant scored 25 points but made just 8-of-25 shots. 
Indiana 97, Toronto 95 
Al Harrington scored 16 of his 22 points in the second half as the Indiana Pacers matched their best start with a 97-95 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night. 
Jermaine O'Neal added 20 points for the Pacers, who are 9-1 and tied the team record set in the 1969-70 ABA season. 
Indiana has won eight straight since losing at New Jersey on Nov. 1, and have the NBA's second-best record behind the undefeated Dallas MaV'ericks. 
Voshon Lenard had 22 points, and Alvin Williams 21 for the short-handed Raptors, who have lost three straight. 

Harrington scored six straight points to give the Pacers an 88­85 lead with 5:04 remaining. 
Morris Peterson tied it for Toronto with two free throws with 1:41 left, but Jamaal Tinsley made one of two free throws to give Indiana the lead. 
Williams later stole a pass from Tinsley with 19 seconds left, but Antonio Davis missed a short jumper -with 4 seconds remaining. Ron Artest grabbed the rebound, was fouled and made two free throws to give Indiana a 97-94 lead with 2.8 seconds left. 
The Pacers then intentionally fouled Peterson, who made his first throw before the Raptors committed a lane violation to seal the victory for the Pacers. 
The Raptors. who dressed just nine players, signed guard Jermaine Jackson earlier in the day after being granted their second roster exemption this month by the NBA under a spe­cial hardship rule. 
Vince Carter, sidelined with a strained left quadriceps tendon, isn't expected back for at least a week. 
Detroit 79, Miami 68 
Ben Wallace had 19 rebounds, a season-best 12 points and tied a franchise high with 10 blocks to lead the Detroit Pistone; to a 79-68 victo­ry over the Miami Heat on Wednesday night. 
The triple-double was the sec­ond of Wallace's career, and he matched the team record for blocks, which he shared with Edgar Jones. 
Chucky Atkins scored a sea­son-best 21 points in place of the injured Chauncey Billups, and Cliff Robinson added 13 for the Pistons. 
Eddie Jones scored 15 points. while Vladimir Stepania added 12 points and 13 rebounds for Miami, which failed to reach 70 points for the second time in three games. 
The Pistons led 37-34 after a slow-paced first half. Detroit's lead could have bigger, but the Pistons missed eight of 12 free throws in the half.

Tyson will face Etienne in the Pyramid arena 

,r 
Mike Tyson will return to Pyramid arena to fight Clifford Etienne on Feb. 22. Tyson fought Lennox Lewis in the same ring. 
Associated Press 
LAS VEGAS 
Mike Tyson will begin his lat­est comeback in the same ring where he took a beating his last time out against Lennox Lewis. 
Tyson will fight Clifford Etienne on Feb. 22 at the Pyramid arena in Memphis, Tenn., where Lewis stopped him in the eighth round of their heavyweight title fight. 
"I guess they liked my show the last time," Tyson said Wednesday in confirming the fight. 
Tyson's manager, Shelly Finkel, said a press conference would be held next Tuesday in Memphis to formally announce the fight. 
Tyson hasn't fought since los ing to Lewis on June 8 in a fight that drew a crowd of 15,327 and is generally considered the biggest sporting event in Memphis history. 
He will likely have more suc­cess against Etienne (24-1-1 ), who was knocked down twice and managed a draw July 27 in his last fight against Francois Botha. 
Tyson's fight with Lewis in Memphis was boxing's most lucrative ever, with ringside ticket prices of $2,400 and pay­per-view sales trailing only the second fight between Tyson and Evander Holyfield. 
Memphis got the bout only after Nevada boxing authorities refused to let Tyson fight in Las Vegas, partly because of a melee he and Lewis were involved in at a January press conference announcing the fight. 
The city got generally high marks for its first major cham­pionship fight, however, and it brought an estimated $30 mil­lion into the economy as well as the attention of hundreds of journalists during the week of the bout. 
Tyson was also pleased with the reception he got in Memphis, where he was a big­ger attraction than Lewis for most fans in the days leading up to the bout. 
The 35-year-old Tyson needs to look good against Etienne not only to get a rematch with Lewis but also to bolster his confidence that also took a beating against the heavy­weight champion. 
Sixteen years after he became the youngest heavy­weight champion ever at the age of 20, Tyson was exposed by Lewis as an aging fighter with limited skills who can't intimidate anyone anymore. 
Tyson had a rematch clause in his contract for the first fight, though both fighters were allowed to take a fight before meeting again. 
Lewis has also not fought since beating Tyson, though he is expected to return to the ring in the spring to defend his WBC heavyweight title against No. 1 contender Vitaly Klitschko.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL 
Clarett hopes to return to OSU lineup against Michigan 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio 

Maurice Clarett promised to be in Ohio State's lineup against No. 12 Michigan. Whether the freshman running back will actually play Saturday is unknown. 
Clarett has been struggling to recover from a shoulder injury that has limited his play in the last three games for the No. 2 Buckeyes. 
Michigan coach Lloyd Carr was asked if he thought Clarett would play in Saturday's game against the No. 12 Wolverines. 
"I'm too smart to expect that he won't," Carr said. 
Before being injured, Clarett vaulted into contention for the llcisman Trophy by piling up almost 1,000 yards rushing and 15 touchdowns in seven games. 
After last week's overtime victory against lllinois, Clarett made it clear what he thought of the Michigan game. 
"I wouldn't care if I was 20 percent. You 're going to see Maurice Clarctt on the field (against Michigan)," he said. 
Clarctt also missed a game early in the season after arthroscopic knee surgery. 
The freshman's shoulder injury is described as a stinger. In games against Penn Stale and Minnesota, Clarett played, but ran to the sideline with his left arm dangling after taking a hit on his shoulder. 
Clarett was not among the 
NOTRE 

15 or so Buckeyes who met with reporters Monday. Ohio State's practices this week are closed to reporters. 
Coach Jim Tressel described Clarett's status this-week as similar to last week when doc­tors and trainers said he could be available to play. 
"I can't promise you that he will," Tressel said. 
Tressel said he expected Clarett to play -just as he expected him to play at Illinois. 
"The trainers say that his strength is much better than it was a week ago," Tressel said. But, he added, the ultimate decision would come down to Ohio State's medical staff and Clarett himself. 
After stringing together five consecutive games with more than 100 yards rushing, the shoulder injury has limited Clarett to 91 yards in the last four games. 
With 1,071 yards this sea­son, he needs 56 yards to break Hobert Smith's fresh­man rushing record. 
Tressel believes Clarett will play because the Buckeyes wiU have plenty of time to recuper­ate before a bowl game. 
"We've got six weeks," he said. 
Clarett's status isn't a mys­tery to Michigan defensive tackle Shawn Lazarus. 
"I think he's going to play," he said. "I think they want him to play. We'll just have to step up to that challenge."

HORSE RACING 
Harn pleads guilty in $3 million horse betting scam 
Auocia~d P,ess 
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. 

A computer programmer admitted in court Wednesday he was the inside man for a series of betting scams on horses that culminated with a $3 million win from the Breeders' Cup last month. 
He also implicated his two co­defendants, who were his fra­ternity brothers in college. 
Chris Harn, 29, of Newark, Del., told a federal judge he used his job at Autotote, which handles most of the nation's racetrack and off-track betting, to manipulate bets during races. 
In pleading guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracies, Harn said he used one co-defen­dant's Off Track Betting account to place a Pick Six bet on the Oct. 26 Breeders' Cup "and later modified it so it would win." 
The wager -six bets costing a total of$1,152 -immediately drew the scrutiny of authorities because of its unusual nature. The $3 million was not paid, and an investigation was launched. 
On a Pick Six wager, bettors try to select the winners in six consecutive races, but they usu­ally choose different combina­tions to increase their chances of winning. The suspicious bet picked the same combination six times, selecting the winners in the first four races and every horse in the last two. 
Because of a routine delay in reporting bets to the Arlington racetrack near Chicago, Harn was able to change the wager after the first four races to make sure the bet had the four winning horses, which included two long shots. That guaranteed winning tickets. 
Now, all bettors who picked five of the six winners at the Breeders' Cup stand to earn more money. The racing com­mission in Illinois will determine how to redistribute the win­nings. 
Also Wednesday, the National Thoroughbred Racing Association announced that a consulting firm headed by for­mer New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had been hired to review the industry's electronic wagering system. 
"We have a great sport that is threatened by wrongdoing," NTRA commissioner Tim Smith said. 
The NTRA has already intro­duced steps for improved secu­rity in electronic wagering at tracks nationwide.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL 

Associated Press 
BLACKSBURG, Va. 

West Virginia's Brian King intercepted Bryan Randall's pass in the end zone with 12 seconds left as the Mountaineers defeated Virginia Tech (No. 12 ESPN/USA Today. No. 13 AP} 21-18 Wednesday night. 
Tech coach Frank Beamer surely will be questioned about calling two straight passes into the end zone when the Hokies already were well in range for the game-tying field goal. 
Before that, the Mountaineers (8-3, 5-1 Big East) stopped Virginia Tech (8-3, 3-3) on three consecu­tive rushes from inside the 1 yard-line with under five minutes remaining, and bar­ley hoog on. 
West Virginia's play-it-safe strategy following the defen­sive stops nearly backfired. After gaining only 2 yards on three straight rushes, Mark Fazzolari stepped out of the end zone for a safety with 2:30 remaining, closing the deficit from five points to three. 
But then Todd James· free kick went out of bounds, giv­ing the Hokies the ball at midfield with 2:26 left. Randall guided his team to the 11, and Tech seemed content to run down the clock and kick the field goal on third down. 
Randall's first pass was low and incomplete, but King stepped in front of the next pass, sealing Tech's third straight loss after an 8-0 start. 
Like Pittsburgh and Syracuse before it, West Virginia had no trouble run­ning the ball against a defense once ranked as the nation's stingiest, getting 125 yards on 11 carries from Quincy Wilson and 263 yards rushing overall. 
Wilson's big night included a 42-yard run for the Mountaineers' final touch­down, a play on which he ran untouched through a huge hole. 
Virginia Tech (8-3, 3-3) lost its third in a row for the first time since 1992, allowing an average of 246 yards per game on the ground in the stretch. 
Wilson, who set up West Virginia's first touchdown with runs of 24 and 27 yards on consecutive plays, gave West Virginia a 21-10 lead ½ith his big run, and then the Mountaineers held on against a late rally. 
Virginia Tech responded immediately to the touch­down, driving 69 yards in seven plays with Randall's 6­yard touchdown pass to Keith Willis. Randall tried a 2-point conversion pass, but it was intercepted in the end zone.

Restoring Trust: Perspectives after Dallas 
The Place Where the Church Does its Thinking 
¦ by Fr. Richard Warner, c.s.c. Director of Campus Ministry 
Holy Cross Father Ted Hesburgh, who served as president of Notre Dame from 1952 until 1987, often referred to Notre Dame as "the place where the Church does its thinking." If that was true fifteen years ago, and it was, it is all the more so today. Three recent events underscore this unique and important service of the University to the bishops of the Catholic Church during a time of great difficulty and challenge. 
Last March, Father Malloy appointed a fifteen person committee comprised of members ofthe administra­tion and faculty, to help the bishops prepare for their meeting in Dallas, when they would attempt to address the scandal caused by the infidelity of350 priests who were charged with sexually abusing minors ten or fifteen co fifty years ago, and some bishops and religious superiors who reassigned these men to ocher parishes, often without advising the new pastors or faithful of their past offences. This meant that some of these priests were able to continue to take advantage of children entrusted to their care. 
The bishops did meet in 1993 and developed a policy regarding chis issue in a document entitled "Restor­ing Trust". Since that date, very few accusations of sexual misconduct by priests has been dramatically re­duced. But the actions and practices that took place prior to 1993, exploded in the media about one year ago, and has been a topic covered continuously since then. 
The Committee Father Malloy appointed, referred to as the "Church Study Committee", began meeting in March to prepare a report which would be distributed to the bishops prior to their June 2002 meeting in Dallas, as Father Malloy had requested. Countless hours of work were dedicated to this task by the Commit-· 
tee.  Experts in the areas of journalism, law and

does its thinking."  The workshop for the bishops, entitled Restoring Trust: Perspectives after Dallas, attracted over fifty participants. The  
bishops present were somewhat spellbound as they listened  
to one expert after another, most of them members of the  

Notre Dame faculty. Their areas of expertise included history, law, Canon Law, psychology, theology and philosophy, among others. The opportunity to be exposed to these great teachers and scholars, which I suspect we take too often for granted, was a rare privilege for them. As one presenter after another took to the podium, the bishops present continually commented on the richness of the experience. They lamented the fact that too many of their fellow bishops were not present and should have been. They experienced liturgies which moved them, and hospitality which overwhelmed them. For chem, it was obvious that Notre Dame was still "the place where the Church does its thinking." 
Last Wednesday, Father Malloy, Professor John Cavadini and I, along with others, hosted a reception Notre Dame offered for the bishops as they finished their three days ofmeetings in Washington which basically confirmed the decisions they made in Dallas, adding safeguards to provide due process for accused priests. Over 125 bishops attended the recep­tion. Many commented on how important the role Notre Dame plays in the life ofthe Church in the U.S. is for them and for so many others. Some expressed their admiration for the rich gift to Catholic life that Notre Dame represents. Others suggested additional ways Notre Dame might serve the Church during the current crisis and in many other future ways as well. All expressed their gratitude for what was and will continue to be offered them and others by the University. 
It is important for all of us to catch at least this brief glimpse of how essential it is for the Catholic Church in particular, including its bishops, to have such a rich resource at their disposal. Notre Dame is truly the place where the Church does it thinking. That was true during the 35 years of Father Hesburgh's administration; it is true today in spades under Father Malloy's guidance.

IRVING, Texas 
The Montreal Expos will play 22 of their 81 home games in Puerto Rico next year, and the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners will start the season with the major leagues' second opening in Japan. 
Expos president Tony Tavares said that with the guaranteed income from the games in San Juan, his team will not have to conduct a "fire sale" of players such as Vladimir Guerrero and Bartolo Colon. Still. he did not reveal the Expos' planned payroll. As baseball owners ended their meeting Wednesday. commissioner Bud Selig also formed a committee to deter­mine the long-term fate of the Expos, who were purchased from Jeffrey Loria earlier this year. and formed a marketing task force to examine how baseball attracts fans. He also said he will present ideas to owners in January on the All­Star game, which ended in a tie last July when the teams ran out of pitchers. 
Baseball announced that the Expos would play three home­stands at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan without identifying specific opponents, but the hoped-for schedule was revealed by several base­ball officials spoke who on the condition of anonymity. 
Subject to negotiations with the players' association. the Expos would play a 10-game homestand in San Juan in April, with games against the New York Mets (April 11-14). Atlanta (April 15-17) and Cincinnati (April 18-20). revenue from the games on

San Juan was the host for its first regular-season game· in 2001, the season opener between Texas and Toronto. 
The Expos have been at or near the bottom in attendance in recent years at Olympic Stadium in Montreal, and the commissioner's office wants to cut losses. 
Montreal drew just 812,000 fans to its home games this year, and baseball isn't ready to decide on a permanent move. The games in San Juan 
are  seen  as  a  method  to  
increase revenue.  
"Puerto Rico will help  a  lot  

because you are collecting 
U.S. dollars and certain dol­lars, if you will, because there are guarantees involved," Tavares said.

Baseball officials hope to have a permanent solution for 2004, and probably will hold a bidding process. Charlotte, N.C., Portland. Ore., and Washington, D.C., are among the possible contenders. Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief oper­ating officer, hopes to have a decision by midsummer. 
The games between the A's and Mariners at the Tokyo Dome also require the union's approval. They are scheduled for March 25 and 26 -nearly a week ahead of most teams, who open March 31. The New York Mets and Chicago Cubs played the first regular-season games in Japan. opening the 2000 season with a two-game series at the Tokyo Dome.

making friends and going out. I started to be myself again." 
Tancredi is quick to give credit to assistant coach Amy Edwards for helping her recover from the injury and redevelop her soccer skills. 
"I remember going out to practice early and having Amy Edwards re-teach me how to strike a ball. Not fun, nor easy. The coaches did their best to keep me incor­porated, but being so hard on myself I was not going to be happy until I could prove to them what I could do on the field." 
After a year of arduous rehab, it still took Tancredi some time to establish herself alongside fellow forwards Amy Warner and Amanda Guertin. Throughout her sophomore year, she suffered from a variety of nagging injuries that limited her abili­ty on the field. 
"It took me a while to get used to their styles of play and our system on offense, but they really helped me become a better soccer play­er. As the season went along, I grew more confident." 
Coming into this season fully healthy for the first time in her career, Tancredi expected to have a breakout season on offense. but she has experienced a breakout season on defense instead. With a modest record of 7-6 and injuries to starters Gudrun Gunnarsdottir and Vanessa Pruzinsky, Notre Dame coach Randy Waldrum desperately needed someone with the right mentality to solidify his struggling defense. 
"Last year the coaches hint­ed at it, but I was terrified of being a defender. This year when Gunna and Vannesa went down, the coaches turned to me," said Tancredi. "I was kind of disappointed at first that I had to change positions because I'd been a forward all of my life. But I will do anything to help the team win. This is a team thing not a personal thing. As much as I hate to admit it, I kind of like playing defense now."

For Tancredi, the most dif­ficult aspect of the adjust­ment from offense to defense was changing her mental approach to the game. 
"At forward, you are always in more of a rush to score right away. It's kind of a panic. On defense, it's a totally different mentality," said Tancredi. "You have to be smarter. You have to calm yourself down. You can't jump into things right away. There's more pressure. A lot more depends on you because you're the last line before the keeper." 
"I think the position change has really been good for her," added Waldrum. ''At for­ward, she was so hard her­self. Now that swagger and confidence in her abilities is really starting to show. With her superior size, speed, and skills, she can match up with anyone in the country. She gives us that intimidating, physical presence we need back there." 
Since Tancredi's switch to defense, the Irish have won six of their last seven games and now find themselves in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. While Coach Waldrum has been extremely impressed with the way his new defender has performed, he is even more pleased with Tancredi's demeanor and attitude. 
"She has that charisma that all the players look up to," said Waldrum. "She has a great sense of humor and a great wit about her. She's a real practical joker. I'd like to see her to continue to develop her leadership qualities. I don't think she realizes how much the other players look up to her."

BASEBALL 
Irish sign another top class 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Editor 
After making its first appear­ance at the College World Series in 45 years last summer, the Irish baseball program used that momentum in signing another stellar recruiting class Saturday, 
Notre Dame signed nine high school seniors to letters-of­intent, including four pitchers, four position players and one of the nation's premier two-way players. 
"We met certain needs by signing power pitching arms, power bats, a tremendous two­way player, a great catcher and an outstanding athlete who can play the outfield," Irish coach Paul Mainieri said. 
The signees include righthanded pitchers Jeff Manship, Derik Olvey, Jess Stewart and Dan Kapala, utility player Chris Vasami, first base­man Mike Oury, infielder Chris Fournier, catcher Sean Gaston and centerfielder Danny Dressman. 
Four of the signees -Manship, Olvey, Dury and Vasami -are ranked among the nation's top-100 high school players by either the Perfect Game/Baseball America "Prospects Plus" or Team One Baseball. 
"Notre Dame again has signed one of the best classes in the nation, and it's an incredibly-balanced group, with speed, power, good arms and defense at several key areas," said Jeff Spelman, editor of TeamOneBasebail.com. "I'd cer­tainly grade this class an 'A'." 
The highlight of the Class of 2007 could be Manship. The San Antonio right-hander is rated the sixth best high school player in the nation, and the top player in Texas, by Perfect Game/Baseball America Prospects Plus. As a junior last spring at Reagan High School, Manship recorded a 9-1 record with a 0.66 ERA, 159 strikeouts, 19 walks and just 19 hits allowed in 74 innings. His nine wins included three no-hitters and one perfect game, 
"Jeff Manship has an out­standing fastball and a devastat­ing curveball," Mainieri said. "With his experience against top-level competition, he should make an immediate impact." 
The signing of Texas native Manship could be quite a coup for the Irish, who lured the pitcher away from in-state pow­erhouses Texas and Rice, both teams that appeared in the College World Series in 2002 with the Irish. The signing is a testament to how far the Notre Dame program has risen in recent years in the ranks of the college baseball elite. 
"Notre Dame really turned the corner with making it to Omaha, and there is nothing they can't offer a recruit now," Spelman
