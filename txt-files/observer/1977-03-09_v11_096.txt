In HPC meeting 
Casey discusses social space 
by Bob V arettone Staff Reporter 

The u~.: of social space in each dorm, and in L-ifortune, was the issue highlighted at last night's HPC meeting at St. Edward's hall. 
?, :tkc Casey, student body vice president, read a reply from Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, University president, to a report submitted by the SLC. This report noted the social space available in each dorm. 
It showed, for example, that Morrissey has had 300 sq. feet of social space for 334 residents. 
"I would like to thank the SLC for this good study which brings most of the pertinent facts to the fore," Hesburgh wrote. "There is no question but 
that  we  have  to  give  serious  attention  to  this  
problem."  
Casey  said  SLC  members  will  meet  with  

administration officials after break to come up with some concrete solutions. 
Casey also said student government representa­tives will meet with Bro. Just Paczeny, vice president of student affairs, today to discuss proposals for changing Lafortune. These proposals, Casey added, were based on suggestions made by students who responded to last month's student government questionnaire. 
In his student government report, Casey also reported that the Gassman administration is continuing its efforts to obtain campus-wide cable TV. Two weeks ago Hesburgh rejected this $500,000 project. Hesburgh said that primarily that cost was too great. 
Since then, according to Casey, student govern­ment has researched the possibility of obtaining a matching grant from somewhere outside the University. He said four different public sources have been discovered by the work of students together with James Frick, vice president of public relations, and Leo Corbaci, dean of administration. 
In another report Keefe Montgomery, An Tostal chairman, gave the HPC details of this year's An Tostal budget. Montgomery said he plans to spend $4,300 this year. He added that this would leave $330 unspent. 
Montgomery said this $330 could be used for the transportation costs of James Brogan from New York. Brogan, who started An Tostal ·five years ago, is traditionally invited to the festival. 
Montgomery, however, feared that if money were given to Brogan the An Tostal committee would not have enough money for emergency expenses. As a result, Montgomery said Brogan may not be invited this year. 
Of the $4,300 Montgomery plans to spend, the largest part will go to help pay for the circus St. Mary's has hired for An Tostal. The circus shows will cost St. Mary's $7,500, and Montgomery plans to contribute $1,750. Student admission to the circus, Montgomery at1ded, will be free. 
Other highlights of the HPC meeting included the report of Kathy Kane, HPC representative to the SLC. Kane commented on the recent SLV meetings concerning 'Human Sexuality". 
"The past three meetings have been the best we've had as far as discussion," Kane said. "It's up to the committees we've formed to see what's going to be done from here." 
Mary Charchut, St11dent Union coordinator, also announced the publication of the Social Commis­sion's "Guide to Florida". Charchut said this guide will be helpful to students who are planning to spend their break in Florida. The guide provides information on beaches, bars, restaurants and hotels. Charchut added th11t Student Union will distribute these booklets by tomorrow. 
J.P. Russell, HPC chairman, introduced three new hall presidents to the council last night; Jayne Rizzo of Lyons. Gary Fair of Zahm and Jim Daly of Howard. 
Fr. James Burtchaell, University provost, will be guest speaker at the next HPC meeting, scheduled for March 22.

Redlining solutions outlined 
by Jack Pizzolato Senior Staff Reporter 
Editor's Note: This is the last in a three-part series on the nationwide problem of "redlining" in mortgage loan procedures, with particular empha­sis on the practice in the South Bend area. The first article introduced the problem and some of the arguments advanced by each side--the lenders and their potential cUents. The second article dealt with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, discussing the effect it has had and some of the weaknesses of the law. This final article outlines some of the solutions that have been proposed or already instituted in other sections of the U.S. 
Redlining is a subtle art, and difficult, almost impossible to prove. It promp­ted one South Bend Savings and Loan (S & L) official to quip, "You can't find it, therefore it doesn't exist." 
But neighborhood citizen groups, while they have had little access to statistical information, have traditional­ly relied upon individual cases. "There are a lot of stories around," commented a local resident, "and it makes me suspicious." Anti-redlining groups in South Bend have observed that Harter Heights (upper northeast section) and the northwest side appear to be the most recent problem areas. 
Dr. Jaime Sena-Rivera, assistant professor of sociology and anthropology at Notre Dame, recently conducted, with ·the cooperation of the Holy Cross Church, a study of that northwest side 
parish.  In  conclusion,  Sena-Rivera  
wrote:  
"We feel,  though the data  do  not  

directly confirm this, that the most profound negative factor at work in creating parish problems lies in the property devaluation question. If lending agencies could be forced into allowing reasonable arrangements for home purchase throughout the parish, then the problems of absentee landlord­ism, undesirable renters, and crime and vandalism incidence would be very markedly reduced, and consequently many other stress-inducing factors." 
Sena-Rivera drew his conclusion from personal experience and from a series of unstructured interview with members

living inside and outside the parish community. "There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind, that redlining exists in South Bend," he flatly stated. 
The professor outlined what he termed redlining's "snowball effect." When heighborhoods, he said, are denied mortgage or home improvement money, a cycle of premature deteriora­tion begins. People hesitate to move into a heighborhood and consequently, Sena-Rivera maintained, property val­ues drop. Houses fall into disrepair both because their owners cannot secure improvement loans and because unreasonable mortgage terms have drained any capital that might have been invested in the homes. 
Absentee landlords, the professor continued, then buy up parcels of land and there is an increase of renters. ''There is a correlation between renters as opposed to owners, and the crime rate," he said. "Criminals know," he contended, "that renters are an easier mark.'' 
Linking redlining to urban decay, Sena-Rivera also declared that it plays a role in increasing neighborhood tension and racial stress. "Lending institutions do have to be concerned to protect their investments," he said, "but when the whole system is geared toward maxi­mum profit, that excludes a sense of social responsibility where you see human beings as an investment.'' 
Improving housing, the professor emphasized, "is a rational investment which wiii pay off in the general economic health of the area." 
The victims 

Two years ago, James Langford, director of Notre Dame's University Press, attempted to purchase a home in the Harter Heights area. The bank refused to give hi-YJ the required loan and, he charges, underpassessed the house. "They further told me," Langford recalled, " 'If you take our advice you won't buy in that neighbor­hood because it h~>s undesirable people and houses and we predict its downfall within ten j'~ars.' ·' 
Langford got a loan at another bank without problems, but, he said, he knows other people who have encount­ered the same sort of thing. 
Another northeast side resident, who buys, renovates, then resells inner city homes for a living, said he cannot get a real estate loan in South Bend. "I can easily get a personal loan with my credit rating, but not a mortgage," he remarked. 
"I work exclusively in racially mixed areas." he said. "and I was shopping around for a lender."

Where do we stand? 
Yesterday, 1be Observer published an account of several disciplinary cases from 1971 and 1972, which were recently discovered in student government files. 'lbese cases are not of mere historical interest. Because University rules and regulations are vague and contain no set penalty provisions, students must rely on the few publicly lmown cases to discover what can really happen if they violate the rules and regulations. 
Violations of parietals, though extremely commmon, are usually not punished severely unless combined with violations of drinking and-or sexuality rules. The case reported yesterday, of a student who had his female cousin in his room after visiting hours, serves as a good example of this, being the only publicly lmown case or" parietals offense not related to drinking or sex. It also reflects what Dean Roemer said in an Observer article last semester, five years after this incident. Roemer said a student who violates only parietals "will probably get some kind of work assign­ment." In the 1972 case, the student was given a fine of $50 and was put on disciplinary probation. Although the two penalties vary somewhat, they at least show that the Administration does not classifY a one-time parietals offense as serious. 
What, however, is the University's attitude toward marijuana? No statement of Roemer's outlook exists. But the case referred to yesterday, of a student who the Administration believed smoked frequent· ly, implies that smoking is also regarded as a non-serious offense. The student's penalty, aside from the URiversity's re­commendation that he seek counseling, was four hours a week of manual labor. To our lmowledge, no student has ever been suspended or expelled in the past ten years for marijuana use alone. This does not mean that the University condones its use, only that it will probably not suspend or expel students who smoke it. This does not apply to students who sell marijuana or use or sell hard drugs. 

Students should not have to rely on accidentally discovered records, anony­mous comments from confidential sources and rumors to find out how the discipline system operates. Past cases, publicized or not, do not set precedents. Administrators are free to ignore them and decide future penalties arbitrarily, as exemplified by the parietals suspensions last semester. But elementary fairness demands a consis­tent and public policy. Students should be clearly informed of the rules and the ranges of possible penalties attached to the rules. 
The Administration claimes that rules and penalties must be left vague so that students can be dealt with mercifully. Aside from the sometimes questionable quality of this "mercy", ranges of penal­ties could be attached to each rule (as in state laws) to allow for individual varia­tions. Nor need clear rules necessarily mean harsh rules. 
Oddly, the evidence we now have implies that there are some sort of policy guidelines on penalties for different kinds of offenses and that these policies are more or less consistenly followed. Yet adminis­trators refuse to publicly announce them, insisting on playing hide-and-seek with their own procedures. 
The cases described yesterday, and others like them, tell us a few things about the situation we are in. We should not however, have to depend on such fragmen­tary information. It is time to lmow where we stand.

In spite of a plea, "Give a Damn, 
SMC;" few gave a damn. In spite 
of a warning, "Don't Blow It, 
SMC;" you blew it, SMC. 

We did not get the necessary 
response to the parietals survey. Of 
1516 resident students, 540 res­
ponded to the survey. We needed 
51 percent for the survey to be 
statistically valid. Even though the 
student body was virtually hounded 
by editorials, resident advisors and 
individual letters; only 36 percent 
of the student body returned a 
survey. More parents filled out 
surveys than students did. They 
had to find an envelope, buy a 
stamp, and walk to the mail box. 
All you had to do was walk to your 
RA's room. 

The Parietals Committee's hands 
have been tied by this lack of 
response on the part of the student 
body. Everything indicates-the 
student government survey last 
spring, the open meeting in the 
fall, the amount of complaining on 
campus, the response to the sur­
veys that were turned in (almost 
unanimously in favor of extension 
of parietals)-that the student body 

is not satisfied with the present 
parietals system. The Parietals 
Committe was convinced that you 

wanted things changed, or at least 
studied. We needed concrete proof 
that this was so. The survey would 
have been that proof. What do we 
have as viable evidence of the 
student body's desires now-a 
feeling that you wanted parietals 
extended? It's not enough. 
What could have been more blatant than the statement, "Your opinion is essential to a full understanding of this issue"? That's what it said in the cover letter which accompanied the sur­vey. Your opinion was essential. It cannot be assumed that at a college the caliber of St. Mary's that 976 students couldn't read or compre­hend the meaning of "essential." Why then did 976 students not respond to the survey? 
It seems that there is a silver­platter syndrome at SMC: a large percentage of the student body expects-yes, expects-a core group of students, or administrators, or whomever, to determine what their desires are and to act upon those desires. They merely state those desires in a form of complaint commonly referred to as "bitch­ing." The concerned women on campus are then to expend all their enthusiasm, effort and energy to eradicate the gripe without expec­ting anything on the part of the student body-not even the time to place a check mark next to a few simple questions. 

SMC, you had better wake up. The core group of concerned and active women is tired, disillu­sioned, disappointed and angry. They are refusing to take silver platters in hand anymore. They are demanding that what the student body wants, it had damn will better be willing to work hard to attain. 
Parietals was the students' is­sue-no one else's. Your life is effected by parietals and you didn'teven care enough to state whether you were satisfied or dissatisfied. 
The question is where do we go from here? The Parietals Commit­tee has a lot of valuable research material. We would have been able to make a fairly sound case for extension of parietals if you had indicated that that was what you wanted. On the o~her had, if you had stated that you were content with the present parietals system, we would have been content to broadcast it to the world and let things stay as they are. 
As a committee, we have been made inpotent by the student body. We can close the book and recom­mend that, on the basis of the lack of response, we feel that pareitals should not be extended or we can make one final effort. We could try a petition. If over SO percent of the student body would sign a petition either in favor of, or opposed to extension of parietals; the commit­tee may be able to get back on their feet. But-is it worth our time? Is it worth yours? There are no more silver platters. If you want this, you work for it. · 
None of these things really bothered me until after the election though, because I overestimated the intelligence of 50.3 o/o of the Notre Dame student body. I thought J.P., with his and John's vast experience, would walk away with it. And I feel they would have, had it not been for the Observer. By "holding" Ed Van Tassel's column in "fairness" to Mr. Bend­er, the Observer deprived the voters of an experienced insight into the SLC issue. As a result many people may have actually voted for Dave Bender, thinking his proposal feasible. 
Finally, comes the Observer endorsement. While I fully respect the Observer's right to endorse a candidate, I cannot help but ques­tion the reasoning. You said that Dave Bender and Tom Soma had some good ideas and I agree. 

However, I fail to see where either has the experience necessary to turn ideas into realities. Dave Bender's only previous experience was a one year reign as president of the third smallest dorm on campus, and judging from the vote in Sorin, I wonder how good a job he did. Tom Soma, I realize though, has some valuable experience. I, for one, sleep better knowing that farmer Brown's pigs are well fed. 
In closing, I can only say they got exactly what they wanted, a clean campaign. I hope they are proud of themselves, for I know I am. As for myself though, I am not possessed of such a noble streak. I can't help but think that some­where out there, Leo Durocher is reading the results in Friday's Observer and laughing.

Gassman reveals student government survey 
by Ann Gales 
Results of a student center 

survey conducted by Student Gov­
ernment in early February were 
recently revealed by Mike Gass­
man, Student Body President. 
The survey was prepared by Gassman and a committee of five students including: Hal Munger, Joe Santello, Tom Demetrion, John Bender and Joan Hanna. This committee was formed to review the existing student center and consider possibilities for renova­tion. 
According to Munger, the com­mittee originally planned to submit a proposal recommending major changes in Washington Hall and the art building, as well as in LaFortune, but for financial rea­sons these plans were abandoned, and the committee limited itself to ideas for a renovation of La.­Fortune. 
"Structurally the LaFortune­building is okay,'' explained Mun­ger. "But we want to find ways of putting it to better use as a student center." 
In order to find out what facilities the students wanted in a student center, the committee decided to conduct a survey of the entire student body. The survey they prepared was presented and ex­plained to the · Hall Presidents Council at the second meeting of this semester. 
Copies of the survey were distri­buted to the hall presidents who circulated them in the individual halls. The survey was also made available to off-campus students during lunch periods in LaFortune. Approximately 65 to 70 percent of the student body completed and returned the forms. 
One of the questions on the survey asked: "How do you feel La Fortune is used with regards to publications, Student Government and student activities?" According to Gassman, "About 90 percent of those who responded thought it was well-used with regard to publications and Student Govern· ment, but not with regard to student activities." 
Results also indicated that a large majority of students use the LaFortune facilities only on a monthly or weekly basis, while very few use them on a daily basis. Those who said they visit LaFor­tune daily or almost daily were mostly off-campus students and students who work in publications, Student Government, or as Student Center employees. 
The major portion of the survey consisted of questions regarding what facilities students consider important to a student center. Students were asked to review a list of possilble facilities, compiled by the renovation committee, and indicate which they would like to see in a renovated student center. The list of suggestions included the following: laundry facilities, a bank machine, a florist shop, a newspaper stand and a tobacco shop. 

Laundry facilities in the student center were favored by 98 percent of those responding. A bank machine was also a popular sug­gestion, as 80 percent of those surveyed indicated they thought the student center should include this type of facility. 
In addition, :;2 percent said they would like to see a florist shop, while 43 percent thought the student center should have a newspaper stand, and 28 percent indicated interest in a tobacco shop. 
Students were also requested to write in additional suggestions for student center facilities. Among those most frequently mentioned were: a bowling alley, a pizza parlor, a grocery store and a liquor store or bar. Other popular suggestions included: change machines, a sit-down restaurant, an after-parietals coffee house, a fast food restaurant and a game room with foosball and pinball. 
Quite a number of students felt that the student center should have 24-hour facilities. 
As a follow-up to the survey, Gassman prepared a proposal for renovation, which he presented 
Hesburgh addresses freshmen 
by Marian Ulicny Senior Staff Reporter 

"There's no real life without learning what the world is about and what you can do to change it," Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, University president, told freshman honor students last night at a convocation in the Center for Continuing Edu­cation (CCE) Auditorium. 
Hesburgh outlined several objec­tives for the students' future personal development, stressing the importance of competence. "There's a difference between intelligence and competence,'' he stated. "You can really take pride in knowing all about what you're doing with competence. It goes across the board in all areas, no matter what you're preparing to do." 
According to Hesburgh, curiosity is necessary to keep one "really alive in the sense of growing." He expressed the hope that every day for the rest of his life he will learn something new. 
"Life and learning should not be dull," he commented. "For that reason, learning doesn't stop out­side the classroom." 
Noting the acceleration of tech­nological progress through time, Hesburgh remarked, "Who can tell what's going to happen in your future?" He added that today's students would need a keen com­prehension of the world into which they were moving. 
"It is my guess that there will be more change in your lifetime then in your ~~r~!~' or your grandpa:~ ents' lifetimes," he stated. 
Hesburgh concluded with a hope that students will recognize inner commitments to serve people other than themselves. ''Everybody could, but everybody won't," he remarked. "We need some people to do it, or we're in trouble." 
Hesburgh described his associa­tion with Dr. Tom Dooley who devoted his life to establishing hospitals in Southeast Asia. "He showed how terrific it is to grow up and to be somebody," he added. 

"You've-got a long road ahead, and only God knows what it will be like," Hesburgh stated. "Don't settle for anything less than you could be." . 
Emil T. Hofman, dean of fresh· man year studies, commended the students for showing "an indica­tion of things to come." 
"You can do much to make Notre Dame a better university," he stated, urging the students to take part in University activities and

this morning at a meeting with Bro. Just Paczesny, vice-president of student affairs, Thomas J. Mason, vice-president for business affairs. and Kieran Ryan, assistant vice-president for business affairs. 
The meeting was to be a preli­minary discussion on the possibility of renovation, keeping in mind finances and other obstacles. Gassman did not disclose the contents of the proposal presented at the meeting, but he said it included concrete suggestions based on the results of the survey. 
"Our goal is to have a statement on the part of the University that they will cooperate in a renovation by the end of the year, hopefully by the end of my term," said Gass­man. 
Although he mentioned that at least lO to 15 proposals have been rejected in thelast ten years, Gass­man was optimistic that his goal would be fulfilled because of the "definite, positive approach" of his proposal, and because of his "concrete ideas and evidence of student support." 
Gassman added, "The renova­tion, if approved, would be some­thing very important for the new administration to cNJtinue."

said, 'and though .Je can't do that 
anymore, we've changed our reg­
ulations in such a way that no 
properties in those areas would

Other renovators, he stated, were dropping out of the business because they had come up against similar problems. "They said it to my face," he mused. "That's hard to believe.'' 
Ray Hernandez, a southeast section resident who was forced to refinance his car in order to get a home improvement loan,said there is a strong feeling in his neighbor­hood that it is difficult to get mortgage money.. 
Southold Restoration Inc., a group interested in preserving the historic W cost Washington and Park Ave. neighborhoods in South Bend, began a "revolving loan fund" according to its director, Ruth Price, for people who were having trouble getting loans from local banks and savings institutions. 
Two ·brothers who tried to get a mortgage on one of the historical sites were refused by most of the banks and S&L's in South Bend. "We went to one bank where our family banks," they said, "and though the man happened to know our parents and know they are very hard-working, responsible people and have substantial savings in the bank, it made absolutely no differ­ence." 
The brothers told the mortgage officer they would settle for a high interest rate and they requested that the bank take a look at another home in the area which they had previously restored. "I talked to the banker for about an hour and a half," one said, "and the whole time he just laughed and said, 'No, I won't make the loan to you at any interest rate.' " 
Many solutions have been pro­posed for the redlining problem, most with an emphasis on limiting the risk for lending institutions to make inner city loans. A program originated by one lender in Balti­more, which has been labeled "very successful," allows deposi­tors to stipulate the specific area or even block where they would like to see their money loaned. When a loan is made in that area, the depositor receives a card informing him. 
In some cities such as Atlanta and Denver, banks and S&L's have pooled money to form inner city

Bengal Bouts' champions crowned 
by Ray O'Brien Sports Writer You will never mistake these fights for the Golden Gloves or the Olympics but they are never any less entertaining. The Bengal Bouts wrapped up its 46th consec­utive year under the direction of Dominic J. "Nappy" Napolitano last night at the ACC. This year's Bengal Bouts offered the seasonal boxing fan a mixture of every conceivable style. While the bouts were missing the heavy­weight gridders of last year's extravaganza, the action was no  Diamond finished the stronger of the two as he sent his opponent to the canvas at the end of the final round but Mullins was awarded the split decision. Anthony Ricci and Walt Rogers staged the quickest fight of the night as Ricci slipped in an awesome right cross to the head of Rogers at the 1:06 mark of the first stanza. Rogers recovered three minutes later and left to the ovation of a crowd he will not likely remember. Brian Kilb, a freshman from Flanner, and returning champion Jim Quinn posted unanimous deci­ his third Bengal Bout title. In one of the few uneventful fights on the agenda, Dave Bass­ette bested Terry Rogers for the 167 pound crown. In a battle of South Bend natives Kevin Smith posted an unanimous decision over Pete DeCelles. A bloodied Buzz Reynolds out­slugged Bob Derdak to take the 172 pound weightclass. Reynolds was awarded a split decision as he scored often against opponent al­though Derdak's blows took their toll. With boxers like "Nitro Nake" Naquin and "Thunder" Thornton  head of Thornton. Thornton boun­ced back in the second round with a right cross of his own that left "Nitro Nake" glassy eyed as the bell sounded. In the last round Naquin unleashed two rights to the head of Thornton forcing him to take the standing eight count twice giving Naquin his second Bengal title. Shane Carew and John Herman­ek clinched the 187 and 195 lb. crowns via knockouts. Carew did not waste much time in knocking out freshman Tomk O'Keefe as two consecutive rights ended the fight  the most exciting Bengal boxers of the future. In the premier event of the night John Vellutate and Dave Bossy staged one of the most thrilling bouts in the three day Bengal Bout affair. Vellutato took control of the fight in the first two rounds and looked will on his way to a KO win when Bossey slipped in a despera­tion left uppercut that almost turned the lights out on the Flanner junior.

The senior from  by Gregory Solman Sports Writer The playoffs--hockey's "second season,'' begins tonight at the ACC. The Irish will face off at 7:30 against the 'vtinnesota Golden Gophers, a term that promises to g1ve the Irish all they can handle-­at least, if the past is any indica­tion. One statisti says it all. After playing four g~mes this year, Notre Dame holds a mere 14-13 scoring advantage over the NCAA defen­ding champions. That, along with the characteristic play of the post­season, should be indicative of great hockey to come. Oddly enough, both of the two­game series the teams played this season were played in Minnesota. The first series. played at St. Paul December 28-29, saw Lenny Moher win a close 6-S decision the first night, and the Cophers come back to snag a 3-2 win the next night. In the seco<~d meeting betweeen the two clubs. the Irish nipped the Gophers and their standout goal­tender, Paul J,Jswiak, 3-2. The next night the fre~.hman goalie battled John PetersOJ. to a 3-3 tie. The Gophe1 s boast a host of fast­skating wing('rs in Tom Gorence,  additional pressureon myself.'' Moher, it might be added, is the winningest overtime goalie in the WCHA. The playoffs are something spe­cial for all of the players, but for Kevin Nugent, a native of the St. Paul-Minnear ''lis area, the game is even more meaningful. "For me, this could almost be described as a game within a game," commented an enthusi­astic Nugent. ''I'm really ready for this series. Most of Minnesota's players are guys that I grew up with and played either with or against. Naturally, I in particular, would like to see us win this series." For Dukie Walsh, Irish co-cap­tain and the WCHA's leading scorer, it is not at all an impossible task. "The key to this series will lie in who makes the least mistakes and who commits the least amount of penalties. In a series against a team that has played so well against you, a team has to be careful not to defeat itself." After coming back from a two goal defecit to tie in the second game of the recent Wisconsin series, Lenny Moher indicated that  he felt the team would do well. "The team has good confidence right now,'' he commented, "We've all had a good week of practices, and tying Wisconsin is a good way to enter the playoffs. I'm very relaxed and confident about the series, and optimistic that we will do well." Unfortunately for the Irish, winger-center Steve Schneider will not skate tonight, and probably won't tomorrow. s, ;meider re­ce.ived torn cartilage i 1 the ribs in the physical Wisconsin series. He hopes to play in the weekend series, should one occur. This series with Minnesota also promises to be physical, according to Kevin Nugent. "They're de­fensemen are quite big physi­cally,'' commented the Irish police­man, ''They do use quite a lot of body contact." Tickets are still available for the contests upcoming, and will be available at the door tonight. The games will be broadcast by WNDU radio, with Ted Robinson and Jeff Jeffers. The pregame show will start at 7:15. WSND will also broadcast live from the press box, at 7:20. John Stenson and Meg Morgan will be announcing.

Leading the mound corp are Jim Sholl and Don Wolfe. The former threw 23 scoreless innings last fall shutting out Indiana State, Cincin­nati and Xavier. He allowed only 17 hits and struckout 16 in his fall performance. Wolfe, a junior Ieft-hander, was the top pitcher during the 1976 spring season with a 6-3 record and a club-leading 2.97 ERA.

Last season he split the duties with two other catchers. Dave DeFacci could see action behind the plate or in the outfield. Last fall he hit .364 as an outfielder and designated hitter, so Kelly will have to find a spot for him in the lineup. Freshman Dan Voelinger, who is the most polished and powerful of the freshman crop will also see action behind the plate. Frank Fiascki and Rick Pullano head a group of solid hitting infieiders. Fiascki hit a team-lead­ing .365 last season. The senior second-baseman led the squad in hits and stolen bases. Pullano hit .500 last fall and did not commit an error at shortstop. He hit .325 as a freshman and seems headed for stardom. Bob Cleary and Rick Greenwell will be in competition all season for the starting nod at third, while Jim Abbatiello appears to have the inside track at first base. The converted second baseman had a fine fall and has a knack for getting of base. Two of the three outfield posi­tions will be manned by experienc­ed seniors. Stan Bobowski, a fine all-around athlete from Arlington Heights, Ill., will probably begin the season in centerfield. He hit .302 in only 14 games of and injury -plagued 1976 season. Mike Galloway hit .266 last season after an impressive .318 figure his sophomore campaign. He will be in left field, but is capable of moving to th,e infield. Bob Bader would be the starting centerfielder if it were not for a not-so-easily­shaken ankle ailment. The speedy junior is an excellent defensive player with his most prized asset being an ability to get a quick jump on the ball. Bill Starr, Craig Zebold, Dan Carey and DeFacci will battle for the final outfield shot.  Lind.
