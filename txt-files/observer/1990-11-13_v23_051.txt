NEH bashes the way we teach 
WASHINGTON (API Traditional methods of training teachers, testing students and selecting tnxtbooks arc so flawed they may derail creative efforts to improve learning. a report said Sunday. 
Lynnn Cheney, chairman of thn National Endowment for the Humanities. used a man­dated congressional report to harshly criticize basic U.S. educational practices. 
Cheney called the practices "tyrannical machines." a phrase coined by philosopher William James to describe mnthods that become both counterproductive and resis­tant to change once established on a large scale. 
The report cited the Scholastic Aptitude Test as "an almost classic example" of a "tyrannical machine." 
Cheney also attacked school textbook selection committees that choose matnrial. without reading them, college education programs in which tnachers spend little time studying what they eventually will tiHtch and university systems that value research more than teaching. 
"Tyrannical machines domi­nate American education and havH contributed to its fail­ures." said Cheney in the re­port. "The most effective course for dealing with tyran­nical machines is to provide alternative systHms and to nnsure that pnople can choose -and choosn wisely ­among them." 
For this reason. Cheney said "choice" -allowing students and parents to decide where to attend school -is "one of the most promising ways of dismantling tyrannical machines and revitalizing the schools." 
"When there are alternative ways to become a teacher or to choose textbooks or to assess students -and when people know about them -it is more difficult for outmoded and unsatisfactory methods to dominate. Healthy competition is anathema to tyrannical ma­chines," she said. 
Deputy Education Secretary Ted Sanders applauded the report. saying "We need a revolution in teaching and learning." 
Mansfield University Presi­dent Rod Kelchner, in Mans­field. Pa.. said that "while Ch­eney makes some valid points, they are overridden by generalizing and bashing to the point of absurdity." 
The SAT, described by the report as the centerpiece of our educational system, filled an important need when first devised in the 1920s when officials wanted to detach college entrance examinations from the high school curriculum. Now, Cheney said the SAT tries to avoid testing what students have learned about subjects such as history and literature. 
In the past 10 years, the test has been attacked repeatedly yet it continues to thrive and to exercise considerable power. She said, "not only do institutions of higher education rank students by their SATs, they in turn are ranked by them, their status going up or down depending on the average scores of the incoming class. 
"Secondary schools are judged by SATs: Local housing prices rise and fall; principals and superintendents are hired and fired; and the entire nation reaches conclusions about the state of American education." 
Cheney said an alternative would be to expand the use of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, saying it was the sole assessment tool that is both nationally repre­sentative and comprehensive in calculating what America's students know and can do in various subject areas. 
College Board President Donald Stewart took issue with Cheney's assessment of the SAT, stressing she "makes some thought-provoking and sorrie extremely questionable statements." 
"In a nation with over 26,000 secondary schools ­with varying eurriculums and teaching and grading standards -the SAT provides an independent, objective verification of a student's mathematical and verbal reasoning abilities, skills that are important to academic success in college," he said.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Permacloud over ND is here to stay 

We came back from October Break to beautiful 70 degree weather. The campus was bright and cheerful with the sun reflecting off the col­orful autumn leaves. Students made every excuse in the book in order to stay out­
doors. Homework Accent Copy Editor didn't seem so burdensome. 
Were we just imagining this scenario? It's almost too difficult to picture now as I load up each morning in sweaters, boots, coats and, of course, the cursed umbrella. 
As a good friend put it recently, "Permacloud" is back. That is, the inevitable and seemingly permanent gray mass which hovers over Our Lady, creating strings of monotonous and dreary days. 
Yes, that lovely gray sky, chilling rain and whipping wind characteristic of South ....~ ..~ has returned. The trees are now bare. The leaves, now brown, are matted to the soaked ground. Puddles the size of small lakes have taken over our pathways. 
Students make every excuse in the book so as NOT to have to venture out into the un­known. Classes are abandoned and trips to the library become less and less frequent­allowably, however. 
Who should have to subject themselves to such hell outdoors? (This argument eradi­cates the possibility of feeling the guilt you felt on those nice days while playing volley­ball when you should have been studying at the 'brare.) 
But what do we do with ourselves when we are confined to our dorms? 
This is an excellent time to start planning a spring break trip. Inevitably everyone will readily agree with your proposal to visit the Sahara. Just mention sun, heat and a CLOUDLESS sky. 
In addition, with all this bleak time on our hands and no shining sun to make us feel as if "we're missing out on something," it be­comes easier to study. Suddenly EVERYONE you know is doing it. 
This appears to be the ONLY positive aspect of Permacloud, ironic as it may seem. Study habits actually begin to im­prove. And with improved study habits we get improving grades (in most cases) and with improving grades we get "happy" (translation= generous, rewarding) parents. 
But hey, remember not to go overboard. There's a time to study, and then there's more time meant for leisure. Watch a movie, write a letter, find that sock you lost in your couch. Do those things you have been putting off for "that rainy day." 
Because, whether you like it or not, there are an infinite number of rainy days to come. 
Permacloud is definitely here to stay.

In commemoration of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Saint Mary's and Notre Dame professors held a panel discussion Friday at Saint Mary's. 
Notre Dame professors Hobert Wegs and Donald Kommers joined Saint Mary's colleagues Jurgen Brauer and Robert Ladrech to address is­sues concerning the transition of East and West Germany into one unified Germany. 
Brauer, a visiting professor in the Economics department at Saint Mary's and a native of Berlin, opened the discussion with an analysis of some of the problems the unified Germany has faeed on economic and so­eial levels. 
Focusing on employment is­sues, Brauer noted that "East German workers will have to bncnme four times as produc­tive to keep up with their West German counterparts." Citing the auto industry as an exam­ple, Brauer estimated that three out of four East German workers will become essentially superfluous. 
"In the short run there are frightening prospects for the new Germany, including enor­mous unemployment, costs and dislocation," stated Brauer. 
Brauer explained that eco­nomic hardship, particularly for thn East Germans, is to be expected. "More reported bank Brauer to exemplify the des­peration many East Germans are suffering. 
Brauer also touched on the wider implications German unification will have on the rest of the European Community and stressed that "Europe should not provide Germany with the opportunity to divorce itself from the rest of Europe." 
In terms of the future, Brauer has a fairly positive attitude. "The general outlook for Ger­many is bright; by the late 1990s, the East will be as pro­ductive as the West is today," he predicted. 
Kommers, one of the leading experts on German constitu­tional and judicial issues and a professor in Notre Dame's gov­ernment department, focused on the Basic Law, the German constitution, and the process by which unification was legally possible. 
Kommers explained that there are two ways by which unification was possible under the German constitution: under Article 23 or Article 146. 
Under Article 23 of the Basic Law, the article under which unification actually occurred, additional territories may be annexed onto West Germany. This provision required East Germany to formally petition West Germany for annexation.

convention to create a united Germany. Kommers explained that this route would have been more controversial and may "have been disastrous for the country as it would have opened a whole new can of worms to deal with." 
Kommers also explained the four major agreements neces­sary for unification to occur. First, a single monetary unit had to be chosen. Next, an elec­tion treaty was designed. 
Third, a political unity treaty designed to serve as the princi­ple governing doctrine was cre­ated. This treaty obliges Ger­many to revoke Article 23 of the Basic Law, thereby establishing the current boundaries permanently. 
An official agreement be­tween the two Germanies, as transitional provisions such as the decision to allow East and West Germany to maintain their opposing abortion policies for one year. 
Kommers emphasized that East Germany must now be or­ganized under the Western sys­tem. "The East Germany Judi­ciary must totally revise," ex­plained Kommers. He added that, "East Germany justices will no longer be qualified to preside over the Western sys­tem." 
Kommers, a professor at the Notre Dame Law school, noted that, "Legal education must be reconstructed to produce qualified East Germans." 
Wegs, an expert on Austrian history, presented an historical synopsis of the two Germanies, and what has come to be German ethnicity will be able to stretch. German problems of identity are not new. Fragmen­tation of the German people has existed for much longer than the current issues of unifi­cation, explained Wegs. 
Ladrech, a professor in the political science department at Saint Mary's, addressed issues concerning electoral politics in Germany. He explained that the "Christian Democratic Union (CDU) emerged as the largest party, not a dominating one, in the recent election." 
Ladrech also commented on the implication German unity will have on the rest of the Eu­ropean Community. 
The panel discussion was sponsored by the Saint Mary's Political Science Club and the Office of the Associate Dean.

Emperor enthroned as a symbol, not a living god 
TOKYO (AP) -In a solemn, centuries-old rite at the Impe­rial Palace, Emperor Akihito acceded to the Chrysanthemum Throne on Monday, becoming the first Japanese monarch enthroned as a symbol and not a living god. 
Leftist radicals launched 25 separate attacks aimed at dis­rupting the ceremony, police said. They fired missiles at five military bases, including a 
U.S. naval base, and set fires at religious shrines and train stations. None of the attacks caused injuries. 
A massive national security operation involving thousands of police was mounted to pro­tect the ceremony and the scores of visiting dignitaries. 
Akihito, wearing a red­brown silk kimono of ancient design, sat on an elaborate lacquered throne in front of an Imperial Palace courtyard filled with attendants carrying bows and swords. 
He vowed to uphold Japan's modern constitution. which fundamentally restructures the world's oldest hereditary monarchy. 
"On this occasion, I pledge anew that I shall observe the constitution of Japan and dis­charge my duties as symbol of the state and of the unity of the people," Akihito, speaking in colloquial Japanese, told about 2,500 guests in the heavily guarded palace. 
Seated on her own throne at Akihito's side was Empress Michiko, also dressed in full imperial regalia. 
Under the cloudless skies, gong and drum attendants played haunting court music for royal family, officials and guests. Dignitaries from 158 countries at the ceremony in­cluded Vice President Dan Quayle and Britain's Prince Charles and Princess Diana. 
The ceremony ended with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, dressed in swallowtail coat, leading the Japanese guests in three cries of "banzai!"-a 
wish for long life. He led the cheers from a spot level with the throne to underscore the constitution's emphasis on popular sovereignty. 
Following the enthronement, Akihito and Empress Michiko were to change into Western clothes and travel in an open car from the Imperial Palace to the Akasaka Palace, three miles away. Officials said nearly 10,000 police would line the route, which passes in front of Japan's parliament. 
Akihito had begun his morn­ing rituals by offering private prayers at three wooden shrines inside the Imperial Palace to announce his en­thronement to the Sun Goddess and ancestors. 
Critics say the 30-minute ceremony -and a series of accompanying rites to be held in coming weeks -are based too closely on the traditional religious rituals used for 
Akihito's  father  and  
grandfather,  who  were  
enthroned as divinities.

Bishops urge restraint on any U.S. action in Gulf 
WASIIINGTON (AP) -The nation's Roman Catholic bish­ops on Monday urged rnstraint to minimize civilian casualties in any U.S. military action in the Persian Gulf crisis. 
Citing the church's longtime "just war" theory in regard to thn Middle East situation, bishops from across the country dnclarnd: 
"The military means used must be commensurate with the evil to be overcome and must be directed at the aggressors, not innocent pPople." 
This ruins out tactics that "could clnarly target civilian lives" and "means this war would havn to be a limited war," the bishops said. 
They urged that under those cireumstances the United States "stay thn course of per­sistent, peacdul and deter­minnd pressure against Iraq," using military force as a last rnsort. 
The bishops' position was set forth in their affirming of a letter about the erisis sent last wHek by Archbishop Hoger Mahony of Los Angeles to 
Secretary  of State James  
Bakllr.  
Mahony,  head  of  thn  

bishops' international policy 
committee, later told a news conference that the bishops' stand countenanced military force "only after every other avenue has been explored and tried." 
"The situation is fluid and changing daily," he said. "It is our hope that no use of force will be attempted." 
As the bishops began their annual fall meeting, the subject highlighted their discussion and indications were they may have more to say about it. 
Although affirming the Ma­hony assessment by a 249 to 15 ballot, they also decided to modify their agenda to consider the issue further. 
But this was to be behind doors as moved by Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston and upheld by a 126 to 118 vote. 
In lengthy debate, several bishops argued for open dis­cussion of the matter. 
"It's important that we do more," said auxiliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of Detroit, adding that it was critical to Americans who "need moral guidance." about it. 
The bishops' affirmed stand firmly condemns Iraq's aggression, the taking of civilian hostages and the "brutal treatment" of civilians in Kuwait.

O'Hara rejects CLC resolution 
By SIOBHAN MCCARTHY News Writer 
Patricia O'Hara, vice presi­dent of Student Affairs, re­jected a Campus Life Council Resolution in favor of collective responsibility Friday because it contained "ambiguous and overbroad" language. 
The CLC met Monday to discuss the implications of O'Hara's decision about the resolution. Rob Pasin, student body president, said, "I am very disappointed with Professor O'Hara's decision to reject the resolution. Right now, we're trying to decide what course of action to take regarding the issues contained in the Student Bill of Rights." 
The resolution was initially composed of two parts. The first portion addressed mea­sures to be taken in case a campus-wide incident was expected to occur. Cited as a specific example of such an incident was the annual campus snowball fight. "Appropriate action to deter the incident" would then be taken by appropriate student leaders, according to the resolution. 
The second half of the resolution outlined a plan of action to be followed after such an event actually happened. This meant contacting student leaders and "adopting a course of action which stresses collective responsibility." 
Collective responsibility, ac­cording to a report created by the student Government Legal Department is a procedure in which "infractions in which many people are involved would be resolved by meeting with all appropriate parties and agreeing upon a course of action." 
"I am unwilling to adopt the resolution as a mandatory Uni­versity procedure. I do not mean to imply that I will not consult with student govern­ment leaders in appropriate circumstances," O'Hara said. She simply wanted to prevent herself from being locked into a situation "in which I am man­dated to do so in every instance of an event that has been only loosely defined." 
"I believe this issue would be better addressed if presented as part of the CLC Task Force review of existing University judicial procedures, rather than examined in isolation," said O'Hara. 
This suggestion left the CLC with three options. 
The CLC Task Force could continue, against O'Hara's wishes, to deal with the issue the Bill of Rights "piecemeal," in regard to three specific is­sues: collective responsibility, uncensored press, and judicial review. 
The 
CLC Task Force could form an "omnibus" report on all of the issues dealt with the Bill of Rights, which could be submitted to the office of stu­dent affairs. This report would then be taken under consideration during the revision of du Lac. 

The 
task force could create a create an all-inclusive resolution which would be submitted to the CLC, voted upon, and sent to Patricia O'Hara for her definite approval or rejection. 


The third option shed light 
on the fact that O'Hara has 
final veto power over all CLC 
resolutions. "I believe the 
decision on the final course of 
action rests in this office," 
said O'Hara. If the CLC 
decided to take a risk, the 
entire resolution could be .rejected. 
No definite decisions were 
made at the CLC meeting 
Monday, but efforts to work 
together and communicate 
with O'Hara were 
emphasized. 

New business included spe­
cific requests to build several 
volleyball courts and recre­
ational fields specifically 
designated for football 
playing, etc., in the South 
Quad. 

The group also dis·cussed other issues such as parking for off-campus students, security phones and on­campus lighting.

Senate discusses Anti­Apartheid at meeting 
By PETER AMEND 
News Writer 

John-Paul Checkett, president of the Anti-Apartheid Network, suggested that the Board of Trustees should be made ac­countable for their decisions in Notre Dame policy making. 
At the Student Senate meeting this week, Checkett discussed the complacent reaction of the Board of Trustees in their approach to the issue of divestment in South Africa. 
Checkett said, "In taking ref­erendums, the majority of stu­dents voted for divestment ... These referendums were pre­sented to the Board of Trustees. ... The Board stated that 'the administration was empowered and authorized after consultation with the di­vestment committee to divest immediately any and all hold­ings if, in their judgement, those companies doing business in South Africa are not influ­encing the dismantling of Apartheid or should circum­stances warrant this action be­cause of further deterioration of conditions itself." 
Even though these conditions for divestment have come about, according to Checkett, Notre Dame continues to keep to keep money in South Africa. 
However, "Divestment on this campus is no longer the main issue," he said, "the main issue, especially for the student gov­ernment, is the Board's re­sponse." 
According to Checkett, "The Board did not follow through and it did not offer any sub­stantial explanation of why it did not follow through ... If nothing happens with no expla­nation given, what does that say about our relationship?

2.

3.

Probation will consist of: 
1. 
The manager of the student business reporting to the Student Senate each semester as to the current status of the business. 

2. 
Any other measures deemed appropriate by the Stu­dent Senate or the Business Control Council. 


Probationary status will be reviewed by the Student Senate at the beginning of the follow­ing school year. This review shall result in one of the follow­ing: 
1.

2.

Katzenelson: democrats are split 
By MICHAEL SCHOLL 
News Writer 

The Democratic Party is without a coherent message for the 1990's due to a split within the party that began in the late 1940's, according to Ira Katznelson, Loeb Professor of Political and Social Science at the New School for Social Re­search. 
Katznelson presented this opinion Monday in the Hayes­Healy Auditorium in a lecture entitled "liberalism in America: Reflections on Markets, Citizen­ship and the State." 
The split formed between the party's Northern and Southern factions, said Katznelson. It began when efforts of Northern liberal Democrats to continue New Deal economic and politi­cal reforms were blocked by Southern Democrats (a.k.a. Dixecrats), who feared an ac­tivist Democratic government would force unwanted civil rights and labor protection laws upon the South. 
The Southern wing was a formidable presence within the Democratic Party, consisting of 52% of the Democratic mem­bers of the House of Represen­tatives in 1948. To prevent such a large faction from leaving the party, the Democratic leader­ship felt it necessary to reduce the liberal reformism of the party's political platform, he said. 
That decision, in Katznelson's view, prevented the Democratic Party from developing a plat­form resembling those of the Social Democratic parties of Western Europe. These parties draw most of their support from trade unions. 
According to Katznelson, the Democratic Party's attempt to appease its Southern faction robbed it of a coherent Social Democratic message that would serve as a solid alternative to the laissez faire economics of the Republican Party. 
Thus, in Katznelson's opinion, the Democrats' appeasement strategy was a failure since it failed to prevent Southern Democrats from voting Re­publican in recent Presidential elections. 
Katznelson is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Columbia University with a Ph. D. from Cambridge University.

Big city mayors say more federal funds are needed 
NEW YORK (AP) -Cities de­serve more federal aid because they supply the labor and the tax revenue that keeps the nation going, some of the nation's urban mayors said Sunday. 
"Cities are our nation's mar­ketplaces, not only for business but also for ideas," Mayor David Dinkins said. "If we choke off our cities by denying them the resources they need to function efficiently, the marketplaces will disappear." 
Dinkins and a dozen other mayors spoke at a news con­ference to kick off a two-day conference on urban issues, such as combating drug abuse, improving education and paying for costly infrastructure such as bridges and roads. 
Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said property taxes alone won't pay the bills for solving such problems. 
Boston Mayor Raymond Fly­nn said cities aren't getting enough federal aid to support drug education. 
Many of the mayors, most of them Democrats, said the fed­eral government is neglecting urban areas. In 1980, federal funds made up 19.4 percent of New York City's budget. Cur­rently that share is 9. 7

French students battle police 
PARIS (AP) -Hundreds of masked youths battled police and set 30 cars ablaze Monday as police in Paris blocked the route of more than 100,000 students demanding better conditions at their high schools. 
It was the worst violence in a month of nationwide student protests. 
·Riot police fired water can­nons and hundreds of rounds of tear gas at demonstrators, who pelted officers with rocks and bottles, smashed windows and looted stores. 
Police headquarters said 104 officers were hurt, including 18 hospitalized. Police reported 52 arrests in Paris, and a dozen youths arrested for vandalism during a protest march in Montbelaird, eastern France. 
In all, about 100 vehicles were damaged in Paris, police said. 
About 150,000 students took part in demonstrations else­where in France. 
President Francois Mitter­rand promised steps woul~ be taken to address student de­mands. They want more gov­ernment spending to improve security, upgrade substandard facilities, modernize curricula and hire more teachers. 
The main throng of protesters in Paris was orderly, but hundreds of youths on the fringes ran wild. Many rioters wore masks and carried clubs. 
Journalists were beaten. 
Mitterrand and Education Minister Lionel Jospin met with a delegation of student leaders and promised an emergency plan in response to demands for better education and safety on campus. 
Monday's march began at the Place de Ia Bastille in eastern Paris, where 201 years ago rioters stormed the prison to start the French Revolution. In the Montparnasse neighborhood

Worry grows in Congress over gulf 


WASHINGTON (AP) -Mem­bers of Congress expressed in­creasing worry Monday over President Bush's latest moves in the Persian Gulf, warning that he is stepping out ahead of his carefully created international consensus and that Americans as well as allies may balk at going to war. 
"If George Bush wants his presidency to die in the Arabian desert, he's going to get his wish," Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview. 
Bush's spokesman quickly retorted, "Not a shot's been fired. What are these guys talking about?" 
The spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Bush has no intention of leaving Congress out of his decision making. 
"They know what we're do­ing," Fitzwater said. "They've been kept informed every step of the way. It's appropriate that they be cautious, that they express these concerns. There's nothing wrong with that." 
Following Bush's announce­ment last week that the United States will begin a huge new deployment to gain an offensive capability in the region, the tone on Capitol Hill has shifted from cautious support to apprehension. 
Speaking in Albany, Ga., on Monday, Democratic Sen. Wyche Fowler said Congress should come back into session after Thanksgiving to debate the issue and to better define America's goals: "What will constitute victory, how long it might take and, more impor­tantly, to pursue every eco­nomic and diplomatic strategy, so that hopefully we can elimi­nate the military option." 
Moynihan's comment was among the harshest assess­ments yet of the president's handling of the crisis, which has enjoyed broad if nervous support from Congress since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
Others, including Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., the senior GOP member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have voiced concern over the president's failure to consult broadly with Congress on the latest deployment. 
But Fitzwater said public support for Bush "has been very strong" and added: "We don't want to go to war. Presi­dent Bush will say the same things these congressmen are saying -be cautious, follow the policy, support the U.N. resolutions, consult with Congress." 
Bush has said he still hopes economic sanctions backed by United Nations resolutions and supported by most foreign nations will persuade Iraq to leave Kuwait without fighting. 
One senior congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said lawmakers who have spent time among the voters in recent weeks are reflecting public unease with the gulf situation. The aide predicted that Bush would come under heavier fire from the Democratic-controlled Congress in the coming weeks.

lawmakers on Tuesday for the first time since Congress adjourned Oct. 28. And members of the bipartisan leadership were scheduled to meet with Bush at the White House on Wednesday. 
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said he was not consulted about the latest troop buildup and received a call only Friday, the day after Bush announced itpublicly.

"stunned" by last week's developments, including the announcement that U.S. troops would not be rotated home from their gulf positions and the administration's conclusion that the United States is free under the United Nations charter to take whatever military action it wants. 
"That's the pattern of a country going to war," Moyni­han said. "He's decided, he's gone unilateral." 
Moynihan hypothetically ~ posed two newspaper head- lines: "U.S. Invades Third World Country in Dispute Over Access to Raw Materials," and "World Unites in Support of Tiny Nation Overrun by Brutal Aggressor."

Poor planning insults those sensitive to racial issues 
Dear Editor: 
This Nov. 8, 1990, is indeed a day to remember. As I, with snveral hundred students, approached the CCE eager to see and hear Rosa Parks, we wnre stopped by someone rep­resenting authority who stopped us at the door with the intnntion of keeping us outside the building because the am­phitheater was full. 
It is ironic that those who planned the event chose such an inappropriate locale to host thn gathering of student body and faculty with Rosa Parks. Indend, their pnrception of our sensitivity to racial issues sold us -students of all ages, faculty and friends, blacks and non­blacks -short. 
Why wasn't a larger locale made available? The event could have been moved outside of the amphitheater to the atrium of the CCE building, the .IACC, Washington Hall, or even Sacrnd Heart Church. Those of us who hung around the build­ing, disappointed, humiliated and disgusted, waited for the miracle of common sense or practicality to happen. Instead, even some elderly women suf­fered the indignity of having to get on top of a precariously un­safe table situated outside of the auditorium in an attempt to sneak a view of Rosa and her soft-spoken voice.· So much for the human respect of persons of all ages. The rumor that a transcript would be made available somehow made me feel like poor Lazarus. Instead of experiencing a significant event, most of us who were there have to be grateful for the crumbs. 
What can those responsible do to redress this insult to Rosa Parks and to us who treasure social justice, human rights and the dignity of the individual, and of the black person in particular? Can they apologize for attempting to keep several of us outside the CCE building, hoping that we would just turn around and go home so as not to be conspicuously embarrassing for the or­ganizers? Apologize to the members of the black commu­nity who could not get close to their Rosa? Frankly, even though I felt insulted, I don't want an apology. I don't want this sort of thing to ever happen again. 
Just as I wanted to see and hear Rosa Parks, there are sev­eral members in this commu­nity who would have wanted to celebrate our common cause for the human rights of our black brothers and sisters. It is persons like her who particu­larly enable us to savor the monumental achievements in the quest for a better quality of life for all humankind. Her tes­timony is our victory. She is an example of what the common person can accomplish by standing up to what he or she 

Student Government explains reasons for locale, apologizes for inconvenience 
/Jear Hditor: 
On Nov. 8, Rosa Parks spoke at Notre Dame as part of Student Government's "Public Forum on Contemporary Issues." Much to our satisfac­tion. the turnout for the lecture was phenomenal. We interpret this as an overwhelming indica­tion of the Notre Dame com­munity's belief in the ideals which Rosa Parks represents. 
Unfortunately, we were un­able to accommodate everyone in the Center for Continuing Education Auditorium. We had been pursuing Rosa Parks since 

DOONESBURY 
April, and she was only able to confirm a date two weeks prior to her visit. The CCE was the only appropriate auditorium available to us at the time of Mrs. Parks' late acceptance of our invitation. Both Washington Hall and Cushing Auditorium were reserved that evening and could not be used. Upon the advice of the people who had heard Mrs. Parks speak, we decided that her voice would not be audible in the JACC or Stepan Center. Therefore, we chose the best option available, the CCE Auditorium. 
We apologize to those who were unable to see Rosa Parks. 
The lecture was videotaped, and we will be showing it on Wednesday, Nov. 14, at 6 p.m. in the Center for Social Concerns Multipurpose Room. If you are unable to attend this showing, we will have copies of the video on reserve at the Hesburgh Library beginning Nov 14. 
Once again we apologize for the inconvenience.

believes needs to be challenged. She, like many others, is a re­demptive agent for all of human history, and yet, in her own way, exquisitely unique. Regretfully, what for us should have been a wonderful event, instead turned out to be just the opposite. 
It is obvious that there is a sensitivity on campus towards the racial issue. Let us cele­brate the achievements in this area, and let us all identify where and how improvement is called for. In concrete terms, I suggest that the University of Notre Dame readdress the issue of black dignity. Let us experi­ence a redemptive moment, in which all of us can meet and rejoice in the celebration of our uniqueness and what we have to contribute to each other as individuals, members of racial groups and diverse cultures. 
For the future, what do I recommend so that we who are part of this Catholic educational institution are made to feel integrally part of the University of Notre Dame? I suggest better planning and coordination of significant events. By offering participation to the University community in a decision­making process, everyone here would have the opportunity to be informed, make suggestions and be part of the decisional process.

Crowded seating at Rosa Parks' talk shows University's lack of priorities 
Dear Editor: 

Will you please tell me who planned the Rosa Parks lecture last night? I planned all week to hear her speak, only to find there was no room in the audi­torium twenty minutes before she was designated to speak. While Ms. Parks' popularity is understandable, the choice of venue made for her speech was absolutely inappropriate. The "Mother of the Civil Rights Movement," a major figure in American history, easily one of the gems of the speakers com­ing to Notre Dame this year, was not given a place to speak suitable to her top billing? 
While Student Body President Rob Pasin apologized for the lack of space, explaining, "it was the only place available," don't you think the University could have found some better accommodation for such a public figure? Where are the University's priorities? Even though I, too, idolize George Wendt as a champion beer­swiller and all-around funny guy, I question the fact that he had the privilege of the JACC to scream his lungs out for 45 seconds while one of the most courageous women in American history was given such an unfitting venue. The students who eame in throngs to see her were short-changed.

LETTERS 

Elitist attitudes unjustly stigmatize social science fields 
Dear Editor: 
Throughout the letter written by Dr. James J. Carberry (The Observer, Nov. 5), Carberry consistently stated, "It is per­ceived that..." This was am­biguous as to whether or not the said judgements reflected his ewn opinion. However, Dr. Carberry's final paragraph led me to deduce that the opinion of his subscribers closely paral­leled his own. Therefore, I will address my reaction to Dr. Carberry. 
I first must exclaim my sur­prise at the several ignorant and "tendentious" statements put forth by Dr. Carberry. I re­alize that his suggestion was that since the Notre Dame campus is "plagued by sports and social(ist) concerns," the university has suffered academ­ically; however, the first two (out of three) of his statements regarded the undergraduate liberal arts education, including cheap remarks made against the "Social (Pseudo) sciences" as being a field devoid of value. 
I would like to address to Dr. Carberry the perceived "folly" of the "Have-Method-Will­Measure Social (pseudo) Sciences and mindless trendy 'in' concerns. e.g. Gender and Peace Studies." Dr. Carberry, have you ever studied or been, say, a psychologist or social worker? An anthropologist? A woman? I hardly believe you can describe such studies as psychology, anthropology, gen­der studies, etc., as "shallow, indeed, hollow, pursuits of 'research"' without actually ex­periencing firsthand the bene­fits from these fields. 
As a psychology major and as an individual who has worked with and endeavored to help others with emotional prob­lems, I feel particularly per­turbed at the negative refer­ences directed toward the field of social science. I have wit­nessed firsthand the frustration and sense of helplessness people endure every day of their lives because they have been tortured, physically and mentally. Should I have chucked aside the boy who put a rifle to his head and pulled the trigger because he could not handle life? Should I have ignored the desperation for help that many kids felt because they had been raped by their fathers at the tender age of two and still feel fear and confusion ten to fourteen years later? Society should not research new ways to help the manically depressed, the schizophrenics who do not un­derstand their lives, or the abused, should it? The social sciences are worthless, right? 
Is giving individuals a taste of happiness or relief from their emotional pain worthwhile? Who would decrease the pain these children and adults suffer daily, a chemical engineer? a computer? Would these people who scoff at psychology feel differently if depression hit them or if they had experienced abuse and torture? 
If a person is hit by a car and breaks his leg, it is relatively easy to heal; however, it is not as easy to heal emotional wounds. People cannot help catching a cold, but somehow they think they should be able to prevent depression or other emotional problems. Simply be­cause we do not use engineer­ing methods to solve a problem does not mean that performing scientific research to solve other difficult problems, such as how to stop 1,000 more teenagers from committing sui­cide every day is not just as, if not more, important. Elitist at­



Lecture's scheduling difficulties reflect disturbing attitude at NO 
Dear Editor: 
On Nov. 8, we tried to attend the lecture given by Rosa Parks. Like many others, we were not able to see or hear her. The auditorium at the CCE was packed by 6:30, and the people who arrived later filled the lobby, hoping, if nothing else, to hear her. Unfortunately, the audio system alternated from not carrying her voice to distorting it, so as to make listening to her lecture impossible. To make matters worse, people were literally climbing the walls and jumping on chairs to catch a glimpse of this famous woman. Many people left the lecture out of frustration and disappointment. 
This situation could have been prevented H Rosa Parks had been scheduled to appear elsewhere. Larger facilities, such as Washington Hall, Stepan Center or the JACC, could have been used. We real­ize that Ms. Parks confirmed her speaking engagement at Notre Dame only two weeks prior to her arrival. However, we cannot believe that play re­hearsal at Washington Hall could not have been resched­uled or relocated. Similarly, the 
JACC  and  Stepan  Center  
seemed to  have  been  
unutilized.  

We have to wonder whether this lack of foresight is a re­flection of a disturbing attitude found at Notre Dame. Such an attitude seems to imply that an African American woman could not draw a large heterogeneous crowd to her lecture. This pa­tronizing attitude taken toward non-white, non-male speakers has been seen at Notre Dame before. 
During the Year of Cultural Diversity (1988-89), Sr. Thea Bowman, recipient of the 1990 Laetare Medal, spoke in Knott Hall's Chapel. Obviously, this facility was inadequate for Sister Bowman, just as the CCE was insufficient for Ms. Parks. Furthermore, Father Malloy did not attend the official reception dinner held for Sister Thea Bowman just as he did not meet with Rosa Parks before her lecture. As president of Notre Dame, his absence from these events seems to propagate this insensitive attitude towards non-traditional speakers. We realize that there were many demands upon Father Malloy's time, but his presence would have been encouraging and supportive towards the Year of Cultural Diversity and the Year of Women. 
As this Year of Women pro­gresses, we hope that the speakers as well as the atti­tudes taken towards these speakers will better reflect tol­erance and respect towards all. 
Anita Varkey, Roberta L. Bryer Pasquerilla West Nov. 11, 1990 
titudes should not exist when the welfare of society is the is­sue at hand. 
It is very disturbing that in this modern society there still exists such negative stigmas regarding psychology or any­thing other than a "pure" science (or areas dealing solely with numbers or "facts"). I am not in the field of chemical engineering, but I will acknowl­edge that it has some kind of purpose or value. So, too, do psychology and all of the other social sciences have value in society. 

I cannot comment personally on all of the other areas Dr. Carberry libeled (though I am positive he knows all about those "mindless" issues con­cerning women....); however, with the callous remarks Dr. Carberry, as a professional, put forth in his letter, I can only hope that he himself is not drafted for a peaceless war or come down with a nasty case of winter depression.

'Shallow' disciplines search for truth, voice concerns of cultural minorities 
Dear Editor: 
As undergraduates in the quest for intellectual growth, we were absolutely appalled at the close-mindedness of Professor James Carberry, who wrote in response to the recent 
U.S. News and World Report's ranking of national universities (The Observer, Nov. 5). While we appreciate Professor Carberry's attempt to enlighten us as to the reasons of our falling status, he undermines this endeavor through his running commentary. His references to social concerns as socialist and social sciences as pseudo-sciences devalue his attempts at objective criticism. 
One reason he puts forth for our decline in rank is our "shallow, indeed hollow, pursuit of 'research' in areas of sheer tendentious folly," areas such as Deconstructionism, the Gender Studies Program, and Peace Studies. He basically writes in opposition to any change in the accepted intellectual canons and any search for traditions that have been lost in the construction of academic disciplines. Professor Carberry's comments are even more shocking if we consider the history of progress in his own discipline through questioning, discovery and innovation. For example, through Einstein's challenge to the existing doctrine, he revolutionized the concepts of space and time. 

Does Professor Carberry mean to say that the attempts of scholars at Notre Dame to delve deeper into the disciplines to recover the voices of the feminine as well as the masculine, of cultural minorities as well as dominant groups, and of negotiators as well as aggressors are shallow pursuits? It sounds more like a search for an understanding of reality to us -a deconstruction of the folly that only lets us see the partial truth of our rich multidisciplinary tradition in the liberal arts. 
If the persons responsible for the rankings in the U.S. News and World Report pass judgement as the author of the Nov. 5 letter does, should we really care how we are ranked by them?

Pitt football suffering season of hard times 
I'ITTSBUHGH lAP) .Johnny Majors nnver saw timns these tough. Neither did Jaekie Sherrill. Even Foge Fazio and Mike Gottfried didn't have it this rough. 
For the first time in nearly 20 years, Pitt football is Pitt-i­ful. 
The 1976 national champion, a Top Ten fixture for years, Pitt was ranked as high as No. 13 this season aftnr starting 2-0. But the Panthers (3-6-1) havn won onr.n in their last eight games and are assured of their ser.ond losing season in 18 years. 
Where have you gonn, Tony Dorsntt'? Dan Marino? Hugh Grenn? Bill Fralic? 
Unless they upsnt Penn Statn on Nov. 24. the Panthers will matr.h their 19R4 rer.ord of 3-7-1. Pitt's worst since the Carl Dnl'asqua-coachnd 1972 team finished l-10. llowever, the 1<JR4 sr.hedule started with Brigham Young and Oklahoma and included no rent-a-win opponents. 
Quarterback Alex Van Pelt talked of playing in a "major, major bowl," but the Panthers won't be going to even a minor, minor bowl. 
How bad has Pitt been in r.oach Paul Hackett's first sea­son? This bad: 
-The Panthers' only victo­ries are over Ohio University, Boston College and Rutgers. They've been blown out against ranked opponents, losing by a combined 128-32 to Miami, Oklahoma and Notre Dame. 
-The attendance for Saturday's 28-18 loss to Temple was 16,375 and would have been lower if the Golden Panthers boosters dub hadn't given away 5,000 tickets. Pitt's average attendance for its seven horne games was 3R,264, its lowest since 1973. 
HATTIESBUHG, Miss. (AP) ­Southern Mississippi has shed its no-respect image. 
For the first time, its basket­ball and football teams are in the Top 25, and postseason bowl games are courting the Golden Eagles. 
"We're opening some eyes with our accomplishments," said basketball coach M.K. Turk, starting his 15th season at the school. "It speaks well for our total athletic program to have two teams ranked." 
In football, Southern over­came a demanding eight-game road schedule and completed an 8-3 regular season by beat­ing then No. 15 Auburn 13-12 Saturday. The Eagles were 5-3 on the road, with the losses by a combined eight points to Mississippi State, Georgia and Virginia Tech. 
Southern Mississippi made its first 1990 poll appearance at No. 25 Monday and is almost certain to get its second invita­tion to a bowl game under third-year coach Curley Hallman. Both the Independence Bowl and the All-


Southern Miss on way to glory 
American Bowl have expressed interest in the Golden Eagles. 
The basketball team, which last season got the school's first NCAA tournament invitation, was No. 24 in the preseason poll Monday. And the Golden Eagles are favored -ahead of perennial pick Louisville -to win the Metro Conference title. Last season, the Golden Eagles were 20-12 and finished second in the Metro for the first time. 
And in the spring, Southern's baseball team was 42-25, and for the first time got a spot in the NCAA regionals. The last two seasons, Southern has earned berths in the NCAA women's basketball tourna­ment. 
Southern Mississippi's pro­gram has made big strides since Bill McLellan became ath­letic director five years ago. He promised growth and change and has delivered. 
"We have only got a $4.9 mil­lion budget, so money is not ev­erything," McLellan said. "We have got 15 sports and the Division 1-A commitment was made before I got here. We do the best we can on what we have and have developed a well-rounded program." 
But success on the field hasn't led to a surge in fan support. 
Even though Southern Mississippi's football team has had only two losing seasons since 1980, there have been only two sellouts at 33,000-seat 
M.M. Roberts Stadium in the past decade and both against instate opponents -.Jackson State in 1987 and Mississippi State in 1989 -that are no longer on the schedule. 
The game against Division 1­AA Jackson State was a one­game contract, while a 1 0-year series with Mississippi State ended this season before a crowd of 40,000-plus at Starkville. 
The average attendance for the three home games this sea­·-. son was 20,885. 
"Our perception on a national basis is not going to start up unless we start at horne," McLellan said. "We appreciate the fan support we have. We just wish we had more." 

Georgia Tech for 1990 National Championship? 
ATLANTA lAP) -As coach of the nation's only undefeated r.ollege football team, Bobby Hoss knows what it will take for Georgia Ter.h to win the national championship. 
"Being the only unbeaten team, we have a legitimate shot," Hoss said Monday, after the Yellow .Jar.kets climbed to No. 4 in The Associated Press poll -Tech's highest ranking since being No. 3 two games into the 1961 season. 
"As long as we continue to win, we have a big opportunity in the rankings. It's where you end up that's important." 
The Yellow Jackets stayed unbeaten Saturday on Scott Sisson's two field goals in the final 5:09, including a 38­yarder with eight seconds left, for a 6-3 victory over Virginia Tech. 
Sisson sent the Jackets surg­ing into the Top Ten at No. 7 the previous week when he kicked a 37-yard field goal with seven seconds left in a 41-38 triumph over then top-ranked Virginia. 
When Texas beat previously undefeated Houston Saturday night, it left the Jackets as the nation's only team without a loss. The only blemish on Tech's 8-0-1 record is a 13-13 tie with North Carolina, one that came on a Sisson 27 -yard field goal with just over a minute remaining. 
Tech has to keep winning to lay claim to the national crown. The Jackets also need the top three teams in the poll to stum­ble -No. 1 Notre Dame, No. 2 Colorado and No. 3 Miami. 

Although bowl acceptances don't become official until Nov. 24, it's certain that Notre Dame will meet Colorado in the Orange Bowl for the second year in a row and Miami will meet the Southwest Conference champion in the Cotton Bowl. 
Tech is headed for the Citrus Bowl against Nebraska. Ross isn't concerned how the hype will effect his team. 
"I know that our kids read the papers and listen to the radio and watch television," he said. "It's not something I try to ignore. I simply remind our kids that if we want to continue to stay where we are or improve our position, it's important that we focus on our upcoming opponent and beat them." 
Tech's last two regular season games are on the road ­against Wake Forest Saturday and at Georgia on Dec. 1.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP)-Alan Henderson of Indianapolis Brebeuf, considered one of the nation's top high school seniors, was one of two major prospects to announce Monday they plan to play college basketball at Indiana University. 
The 6-foot-9 Henderson an­nounced his choice of the Hoosier program over Duke and Stanford, the other two fi­nalists he had named earlier. 
"All three have good pro­grams. What it came down to was where I felt I could fit in best," Henderson told a news conference at his high school. 
Henderson said he decided last Wednesday and notified all three schools about an hour before his news conference. 
Indiana's next freshman class is also expected to include 7­foot Todd Lindeman, who aver­aged 22 points at North Dickinson High School in upper Michigan. Lindeman announced his intent to join the Hoosiers while attending Sunday's game between the Soviet National

team and Indiana at Bloomington. 
The early basketball signing period for high school seniors begins Wednesday and NCAA regulations prohibit coaches from discussing recruits pub­licly until after they sign a na­tional letter-of-intent. 
"The recruiting got a little hectic. There were times I was scared to pick up the phone," Henderson said. "So as soon as I knew, I didn't want to waste anybody else's time. I know how time-consuming the re­cruiting is now. I can only imagine how your mind would be wondering through the sea­son if you wait." 
Henderson, a first team all­state selection by The Associated Press last year when he averaged 29.7 points and 
14.2 rebounds, has scored 1,624 points and averaged 24.6 points in three seasons. He has a career shooting mark of nearly 55 percent from the field and has a 3.6 grade point aver­age out of a possible 4 at the private prep school.

Redskins in Philadelphia 
DiLucia of their Ball State he'll move up after this 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) Heggie White and friends proved coach Buddy Hyan's point Monday night -that de­fense can score points as well as offense. 
With a little help from Handall Cunningham and Heath Sherman, the defense set up or scored three touchdowns in a span of 3:51 late in the third quarter to lead Philadelphia to a 28-14 win over Washington. 
Tho Eagles (5-4) got back into the middle of the NFC playoff race. Washington (5-4) lost both of its quarterbacks, Jeff Hutlodge and Stan Humphries, to injury. Brian Mitchell, a wishbone quarterback in college and now listed as a running back, took over and led Washington 56 yards to a late TD, which he scored on a 1­yard dive. 
The Eagles avenged a 13-7 loss at Washington three weeks ago and joined the Redskins four games behind the un­beaten New York Giants in the NFC East. If the season ended now, Washington and Philadelphia would be wild­card playofl' entries. 
Two of Philadelphia's touch­downs came directly from the defense, a 30-yard interception return for a score by William Frizzell in the first quarter and an 18-yard run with a fumble by Clyde Simmons in the middle of the third-quarter spurt. 
White's 33-yard return with the first interception of his il­lustrious career set up Cunningham's 2-yard pass to Sherman. The fourth TD came after the defense stuffed the Hedskins inside the 10, leading to Keith Byars' 9-yard pass on an option to Sherman, whose 124 yards in 35 carries made him the first Philadelphia back in nine years to rush for 100 yards in two straight games. 
With 30 mph wind gusts hin­dering the offense, the teams went off at halftime tied 7-7 on Frizzell's return and an 8-yard TD pass from Jeff Rutledge to Don Warren. 
But Rutledge, who rescued the Redskins indoors in Detroit last week by throwing for 363 yards in a 41-38 overtime win, couldn't cope with the Eagles or the weather. He completed just six of 19 for 63 yards before leaving in the third quarter with an injured right thumb. 
The Eagles' spurt started when White sacked Rutledge for a 6-yard loss to his own 4. Anthony Edwards returned the ensuing punt 11 yards to the Washington 33 and seven plays later, Byars hit Sherman in the end zone. The drive was pro­longed by a 6-yard, fourth­down pass from Cunningham to Sherman that put the ball at the 
21. 
On Washington's third play, Hopkins plowed into Rutledge and knocked the ball loose. Simmons picked it up on the 18 and carried it in to make it 21-7 just 1:10 after the first score. 
On the next series, Humphries was at quarterback for Washington. 
After a 14-yard pass to Gary Clark and two imcomplete passes, Byron Evans burst through and tipped the ball to White, who rambled to the 9. Two plays later, Cunningham hit Sherman all alone in the left corner of the end zone.

much from us. And we have worked so hard-I don't mean to say we didn't work hard last year-but we have worked even harder this year as a team." Even with hard work, Williams will be very difficult to replace. The Irish know they will each have to be a little bit better to offset his absence in the lineup. "I think when we finally saw that Monty had a problem, I really thought the upperclassmen really got together mentally," Phelps says. "There is really another type of closeness amongst these guys. I think that chemistry is very important, and that's great for our freshmen to see this approach. I think they're loose, I think they're serious, I think they're together. "Where you knew Monty Williams was going to be able to handle the ball in certain situations, now Kevin Ellery is going to have to do it. When you look at Monty getting offensive rebounds, that's the one thing I've told Daimon (Sweet), he's got to get offensive rebounds, or Daimon, the way Monty used to get the ball and be creative, now you've got to do that. Each player has got to step into it, because obviously we've got six players rather than seven with experience." Much of the burden falls on Ellery's square shoulders. As the sixth man, he has to make a huge contribution to the first team. He also has to run the second team, which is comprised of four freshmen, and whip those younger players into shape. "With Monty not being able to play, Daimon and I have to score more," Ellery says. "With the freshmen, what I try to get across to them is that they are going to make some mistakes. But they have to continue to play hard, and maybe as the season gets going they will play more like sophomores than like freshmen." "Ellery and (Tim) Singleton have been very serious as seniors leading this team," Phelps says. "And I think that's been important, especially when Ellery barks at you. There are not too many guys who are going to mess with him. And he's serious. He wants to win, he wants to win big, and he wants to have this team do something." So can this Irish team overcome adversity and become the cream that rises to the top of the college basketball crop? Since they are not expected to do much this season, the Irish could sneak up on some people and make this a very interesting season. With LaPhonso Ellis and Elmer Bennett returning Notre Dame has a potent inside-outside scoring combination. Singleton is a reliable point guard, Sweet is a tremendous athlete with the ability to make spectacular plays, Keith Tower will take up some space inside, and Ellery can play guard or forward coming off the bench. Depth might be a problem for the Irish, but the bottom line is that this is a determined bunch. And anybody that

Irish basketball may surprise the 'experts' 
Great things were expected of last year's Notre Dame men's basketball team. The Irish were returning 10 players from a team that had been 21-9 the previous season. But even though there were several excellent players coming back, they never developed a good team chemistry and Coach Digger Phelps's squad slumped to a 16-13 record and lost to Virginia in the first round of 
the NCAA Tournament. 
This year is much different. Notre Dame had seven players returning from last year's team, and that would have provided the Irish with a solid nucleus. But then a heart ailment forced sophomore Monty Williams to end his career, and Phelps's troops have had to overcome the emotional loss of a close friend as well as the absence of a versatile player on the basketball court. 
Surprisingly, though, with all of these obstacles to overcome, this team is poised and confident as Thursday's season opener against Fordham approaches. Despite the fact that there are only six players with college experience on the roster to compete against a schedule which features such heavyweights as Indiana, UCLA, North Carolina, Duke and Louisville, the Notre Dame players seem very upbeat. 
"Last year was kind of a season when we had to win because we had everybody back," senior Kevin Ellery says. "We had guys like Joe Fredrick and Jamere Jackson and we were hoping it would be our year. This year is different because we don't have to worry about pressure, because people don't expect

The Notre Dame men's tennis team wrapped up its fall season this weekend, taking with them the singles and doubles titles of the Rolex Midwest Region Championships. Irish junior All-American David DiLucia, the only highly seeded player to play in both singles and doubles action, ousted Northwestern's Steve Herdoiza, 6-3, 6-1 in singles action before pairing with teammate Chuck Coleman to defeat Ball State's duo of Dan Kronauge and Scott Campbell, 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-5) to take the doubles title. 
The wins qualify DiLucia and Coleman for the National Indoor Championships to be held in February at Lexington, Kentucky. 
Irish sophomore Andy Zurcher, playing after a five-week layoff due to a bout with mononucleosis, put together a great tournament as well, ad­vancing to the semi-finals be­fore falling to Northwestern's Herdoiza, 6-2. 7-6 (10-8). Classmate Ron Rosas played some of his best tennis ever in a 6-3, 6-0 upset of Michigan's

Volleyball drops to Colorado 
Irish are outgunned, outdefensed as Buffaloes roam 
By ROLANDO DE AGUIAR

Notre Dame women's volley­ball suffered a tough loss Friday night, falling to Colorado in straight sets. 
The Lady Buffs played nearly flawless volleyball on both of­fense and defense, to earn the victory over the Irish. 
Colorado's Tina Murray made a spectacular showing with a .536 attack percentage, includ­ing a team-leading 16 kills. Murray added 9 digs to lead the Buffs on defense as well. 
Colorado (14-11) led throughout the contest, but was challenged early by a de­
--termined Irish squad. Notre Dame fought back from an early first-game deficit to even the score at 13-13. However, Colorado scored the final two points of the game, and carried the momentum into the second stanza. In game two, the Buffaloes came out strong, scoring the first eight points. From there, the Irish could not come back, and had to settle for a 15-3 setback. Colorado posted an incredible . 783 attack percentage in the 
second game, keeping Notre Dame's lackluster game under control. 
In game three, the Irish staged a comeback. After going down 12-5, Notre Dame fought to outscore the Lady Buffs, 7-2, to bring the match to its brink. With Colorado leading the third game 14-12, the service bounced back and forth, with each team forcing sideout after sideout. However, the Lady Buffs prevailed, winning the fi­nal point. 
With the loss, Notre Dame's record dropped to 8-22. The Irish have lost nine of their last ten matches. 
Notre Dame will close out its home schedule tonight when the Irish face Northwestern at 7:30p.m. at the JACC. 
The Wildcats bring a 14-15 record to South Bend, and an impressive 6-8 mark in the tough Big Ten, despite having lost their last four conference matches. 
Players to watch for Northwestern include Stacy Kammes, who leads the team with 324 kills, and ranks sec­ond on the squad with 326 digs. 
The Irish continue to play without four contributors. In 
fact, only seven took the court to face the Lady Buffs. The Notre Dame lineup has been decimated by an unfortunate string of stress fractures. 
Jen Slosar, Julie Harris, Cynthia May, and leading at­tacker and blocker Jessica Fiebelkorn have all gone down with stress fractures this sea­son, and all four remain side­lined. 
Though Northwestern is the only challenge left for the Irish at home, the squad has a long list of foes remaining across the country. 
The MCC tournament, in which the Irish are seeded fifth of eight, will be held at Xavier University in Cincinnati this weekend. Notre Dame plays Loyola in the first round. The Irish suffered a difficult four­game loss to Loyola earlier this season. 
After the tournament, Notre Dame will travel to Austin for the Whataburger Classic. The Irish will face national powers Texas, San Diego State, and Penn State at the University of Texas over Thanksgiving week­end. 

Dan Brackus in the Round of 16 before falling to eventual semi­finalist Jack Waite, 6-1, 6-2. 
"I couldn't have asked for a better performance from our players," said Irish head coach Bob Bayliss. "We had three guys in the final eight and two in the final four. It's great to see that in such a demanding tournament." 
In the quarterfinals, Zurcher, who played at number five for the Irish last year, faced the unenviable task of playing teammate Coleman, who earlier in the season matched up with DiLucia in the finals of the Tom Fallon Invitational. 
"I absolutely hated it," Zurcher said of facing his teammate. "I missed the whole fall season, so he was pushing me a lot in practice to do well in this last tournament." 
Coleman, who rallied back in the Round of 16 to beat Marquette's Jorge Gonzalez, 6­7, 7-6, 6-4, had nothing but praise for Zurcher, who earlier defeated Minnesota's number one player. 
"He really played a great match. He worked harder than everyone else this summer and deserved to win on that given day." 
Other bright spots for the Irish included Rosas's march to the round of 16 and the doubles combination of Ryan Wenger and Paul Anthony taking two matches before falling in the quarterfinals. 
"I was mentally up for the match with Brackus and played well from the baseline," said Rosas. 
It was an all around team effort for the Irish. 
"This is a big step forward from last year," said Coleman of the team's performance. "It solidifies our position in the region and will hopefully give us what we need going into the spring season." 
DiLucia, fresh off a semifinals appearance at last weekends Volvo Tennis Championships, encountered a marathon weekend that forced him to play 11 matches in four days. The fact that he won all six singles matches in straight sets adds only adds to the dominance of his game. 
"I was pretty exhausted in the final singles match," said

Breen-Phillips to face Howard in lnterhall title game 
By KEN TYSIAC

The Breen-Phillips and Howard football teams ad­vanced to the women's interhall finals with victories on Sunday at Stepan Field. 
Breen-Phillips reached the fi­nals with a 12-0 triumph over Farley, while Howard advanced with a 12-8 comeback win over Pasquerilla West. 
The Blitz dominated their contest from start to finish on both offense and defense to record the shutout. They got on the scoreboard in the first half on Amy Jenista's 35-yard run, but the two-point conversion failed, so they had to settle for a 6-0 lead at halftime. 
Breen-Phillips increased its lead to 12-0 when Kristy Alkidas scored on a 60-yard run in the second half, and the 12-point lead was more than enough to assure that the im­pregnable Blitz defense would hold. 
"As far as defense goes, I don't think we had one out­standing player," said co-cap­tain Katherine Mapother. "It was a team effort. In fact, we didn't even allow a first down the entire game." 
Safety Carrie Goles led the defense in the first half, as she intercepted one pass and re­turned it 30 yards. 
The Howard-Pasquerilla West contest was much less one­sided. Pasquerilla took the lead in the first half. as Jenny Tate took advantage of a Howard defensive mixup with a 60-yard touchdown reception. After the two-point conversion, P.W. went into halftime with an 8-0 advantage. 
At that point, Howard gath­ered as a team and decided that it was time to get down to business. 
"We got together and said, 'This is it. If we want it we have to pull it out now.' Fortunately we did just that," said Howard running back/quarterback Marianne Haggerty. 

With 9:30 left in the game, Howard closed the gap to two points on a two-yard option run to the left side by Becky Miller. The missed conversion attempt meant that P.W. still held an 8-6 lead, however. 
Late in the game, though, Howard's offense came alive once again. Howard got the ball in good field position, and then a 30-yard reception by Theresa Forest put the team in striking distance. A few plays later, Julie Snook took the ball down to the 
P.W. one-yard line on a sweep, and then Chris Hegg took it in on a center sneak for the win with just 2:30 left in the game. 
The Howard players will have a chance to defend their cham­pionship on Sunday. The Pasqtierilla players, meanwhile, will have to wait for next year. 
"We're still very pleased, we're glad we made it to the semifinals," P.W. senior nose­guard Kathryn Pirrota said. "We will only lose three seniors, so we should have a good team coming back next year."
