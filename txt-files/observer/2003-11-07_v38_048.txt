SMChosts presidential candidate 
First candidate to meet with students at noon today 
By MEGAN O'NEIL News Writer 
Saint Mary's took a step forward in its presidential search as the College wel­comed the first of four presi­dential candidates to campus Thursday. In the culmination of the lengthy and meticulous search process, the candidate met with administrators and answered questions posed by faculty members on the first day of the two-day visit. 
Today, the candidate is scheduled to meet with any students who are interested at noon. 
In order to maintain a fair interviewing atmosphere for each of the candidates the presidential search commit­tee asked that The Observer not publish the candidate's name or personal informa­tion. However, each candi­date's name and biographical information was made avail­able online for College stu­dents 24 hours prior to his or her visit. 
"If you keep the candidates confidential you will draw a much stronger pool of candi­dates," said search commit­tee consultant Nancy Cook. "That's why we hold many of our meetings ofT-campus." 
The candidates, when they arrive at the College, start at the Welcome Center. In an hour-long PowerPoint pres­entation, candidates will be provided with a brief look at the heritage of Saint Mary's, including some of the notable accomplishments of past

Applications remain high despite football woes 
By KATHERINE GALES 
News Writer 

Although the football team has struggled to win games this fall, the admissions office has not had much trouble winning applic:.nts for the Class of 2008. 
An applicant pool of 12,100 last year -the largest number of applications Notre Dame ever received in a single year -led to 2,002 freshmen enrolling at the University this fall, the sec­ond-largest freshmen class in school history. 
"We're still processing early action applications from the Nov. 1 deadline," said Bob Mundy, the University's director of admissions operations. "[The numbers] look very similar to last year's, and last year was an all-time high." 
According to Mundy, the num­ber of early action applications is around 3,000 -"not far ofT from last year's," he said. 
In fact, according to an article in the spring edition of Notre

Housing crunch hits transfer students hard 
By CLAIRE HEININGER News Writer 

When this year's transfer stu­dents received the news that they were admitted to Notre Dame, they were also told something more disheartening: there were no guarantees that they could live on-campus. 
Due to the increased size of the freshman class, there were few remaining empty rooms available for transfer students. Many were left scrambling to find other options, a process that only added to the many adjustments of their first few weeks. 
"It's been hard," said Jeffrey Shoup, director of the Office of Residence Life and Housing. 
"Accommodating first year stu­dents has always been our pri­ority ... In July, after we sent out everything to the freshmen, we realized that the housing situation would be especially tight this year." 
In response, Shoup and the Office of Admissions co­authored a letter warning transfer students that it would be unlikely for them to receive on-campus housing during their first semester at Notre Dame. Transfers then had the option of adding their names to a wait­ing list, which entered them in a lottery for any dorm spots that opened up. 
"We had a garbage bag with all the names in it in my office," Shoup said. "The advantage was, the earlier the student [contacted Residence Life], the more chances they had and the more times their name went into the bag." 
However, transfer students' housing problems did not just evaporate when their names were pulled. Several who had taken the precaution of making arrangements to live in off­campus apartment complexes such as Turtle Creek Apartments, College Park and Lafayette Square Townhomes found themselves locked into lease agreements for at least the entire semester. 
Colleen McCotter, a sopho­more who transferred from Bentley College, said that she felt discouraged about the pos­sibility of on-campus housing after calling and e-mailing Shoup's office several times over the summer. 
"They told us that the likeli­hood was pretty slim for females, so I signed a six-month lease in Turtle Creek because I wanted to get on-campus in the spring," she said. However, along with the shorter lease came an extra payment of $50 per month, and McCotter is no closer to living on-campus than she was in August. 
"ResLife still hasn't let me know anything about being on­campus next semester," she said. "It's inconvenient because I have to let Turtle Creek know if I'll be renewing in the spring. I asked them for a 20-day extension, but if I don't hear

Students use rallies, dorm events to bolster spirit 

By KATHERINE GALES 
News Writer 

Though many students are disheartened by this year's football season, pep rallies and dorm events try to revive student spirit. 
"The football team is not performing," said David Guthrie, a Sorin freshman, "and our spirit is lagging because our team is strug­gling." 
Justen Cheers, a Knott freshman, had a different per­spective. 
"I go to the pep rallies because they're fun," he said, "and even though the team is down I'm still behind them one hundred percent." 
Hall presidents are working diligently to keep students enthused and supportive of the Irish this season. 
"The Cavanaugh girls go to the pep rally together for the one we host -this year is the first one," said Valerie Ralph, a sophomore and co-president of Cavanaugh Hall. "It's frus­trating, as a president, to put together groups to go when spirit isn't high and large turnouts are rare. It's hard to plan to get spirit act together when people are so disap­pointed."

True fans stand out 

Try listening to 80,000 people jeer as you struggle to get your game back on track. Try dealing with instant celebrity and crushing pressure when, as a fresh­man, you become quarterback of one of the most recogniz­able college football teams in the nation. Try playing hard-core, top­ranked teams in the middle of a sea­son that has been far from the best, boasting nothing more than injured players, glaring mistakes and a coach still getting his feet wet at the University. 
I've heard a lot of students say that they could do better on the field than the current Notre Dame football team. They claim the players aren't trying-one of their flimsy excuses for lea \ling the Stadium early in disgust. 
So you try it, I say. I'd like to see you do better. 
Yes, our football team has been disap­pointingly atrocious this season. They know it. we know it, and anyone who fol­lows college sports knows it. But that doesn't mean they're not trying. The majority of these guys waited their whole lives to play Notre Dame football, and, for them, it hasn't lost its mystique, appeal or honor. They're trying their best for the school that they love -unfortu­nately, their best is not good enough at this point in time. 
But that weakness motivates some fans -not the true ones -to lose faith in the legacy that is Notre Dame. One terrible season has separated, quite obviously, the fair-weather fans from real ones. The fair-weather fans leave. They boo their players. They shirk the Notre Dame sense of family and support that differen­tiates our University from all others. 
They give reasons for this behavior, arguing that they, in actuality, are the true fans. They claim they're the ones who love Notre Dame football too much to watch it being disgraced. The current team is not fitting for a Notre Dame foot­ball program, they say, and it hurts them to see the Irish lose so embarrassingly. 
The real fans feel the same way. But their respect for Notre Dame football­the historical pinnacle of college sports -is bigger than the game, bigger than the team and bigger than themselves. The real fans are the ones who stay and suffer, supporting the team despite the fact that every moment of the spectacle is almost physically painfuL They stay until the end, when the players present their helmets and the band plays the alma mater, so the team -their friends, class­mates and roommates-will not have to bear the additional blow of facing an empty section after a horrible game. They stay, knowing that thousands ­millions -of people would give their right arms to see a game in Notre Dame stadium. They stay because they know that Notre Dame is a family-uncondi­tionally supportive, through good times and bad. 
The team has struggled before. It has overcome. It can again, and the true fans will be there when it happens. The [air­weather fans, though, may have sold

Lecture focuses on AIDS 
By ANNA GELHAUS 
News Wrirer 
The fight against HIV and AIDS does not appear as a key issue on the agendas of many black politicians, said lecturer Cathy Cohen. 
Cohen talked Thursday about the topic of "HIV and AIDS in the 21st Century: Life, Death, and Black Politics." 
Cohen spoke on the issue of AIDS and HIV in black com­munities with a special emphasis on the political response to it. She discussed the lack of political interest in the disease and what needs to be done to improve it. 
"The effort in the U.S. is falling off the political radar," said Cohen. 
Cohen first talked about sta­tistics on AIDS among various groups in the United States. She explained that while the number of AIDS cases has declined over the years, the proportion of cases among African Americans has contin­ued to increase. 
"This is not a new story," said Cohen. 
Cohen explained that 63 percent of AIDS cases among women are black, making the disease the third leading cause of death for these women. For black men ages 35 to 44, AIDS ranks as the leading cause of death. 
Because of these statistics, Cohen questioned why African American community leaders

are not speaking out on this issue. She answered this with her theory of marginalization. In response to this question, Cohen said the black commu­nity is marginalized because it is "isolated, segregated, lacking means of control ... that shape the quality of life, people are masked ... pushed to the outside." 
Therefore, Cohen explained that efforts to communicate with such groups are needed media sources should be used to discuss AIDS rather than mainstream media sources, she said. 
"[The slow response in these communities] has everything to do with a stigmatized view of HIV and AIDS," said Cohen. 
"To increase awareness of the AIDS problem, black lead­ers must recognize AIDS as a major concern and emphasize it over more positive issues."

Dame Magazine, last year's admissions statistics surpassed the record by 19 percent. 
The article attributed the sharp rise in applications to an increase in financial aid, more admissions counselors visiting high schools, expanded pre­college programs and, as the Magazine wrote, the "positive image projected by first-year football coach Tyrone Willingham, the first black head coach in any sport at Notre Dame." 
It is impossible to deny that Notre Dame's football team puts the University squarely in the national spotlight, regard­less of the team's record. 
However, the connection between the team's success and the number of applications is tenuous at best, Mundy said. 
"I don't think I see any huge connection there," said Mundy. "One example I do remember is the year after we won our last national championship [1988]. We actually saw a decrease in applications ... so I'm not convinced of the rela­tionship." 
Difficult losses like those to USC and Florida State don't seem to have an effect on stu­dents visiting campus, either. 
"We have large visits on foot­ball weekends," Mundy said, "but any weekend in fall tends to be quite busy." Despite the losses, "it hasn't affected us early on ... our pool looks pret­ty similar to last year, when we were 10-3." 

The profile of incoming stu­dents also closely matches that of last year's-the University's strongest class in academics and diversity. 
"It's rare for students to cite a very specific item [such as the football team] on their application," said Mundy. "The most common is that they've had a great desire to come here 'ever since I was a kid.' They clearly note the spirit they feel when they visit and the special sense of community present here." 
In other news, this summer Notre Dame Magazine report­ed that Notre Dame ranks in the top 10 of student's "dream schools"-a Princeton Review survey of over 1,000 students, asking where they would choose to attend if cost and admission weren't issues. The University ranked eighth, behind Stanford, NYU, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Duke and Columbia and ahead of Brown and MIT. 
Although the football team is an undeniable part of the life and spirit at Notre Dame, it is by no means the yardstick measuring the University's suc­cess. 
A variety of other factors entice students to come here, and in turn mean that very few students choose to transfer. 
"With the great academic challenge [here at Notre Dame], we get the gamut of things," said Mundy when asked why students choose Notre Dame. "It's the academic challenge, but challenge within a family-like atmosphere."

"I anticipate that the campus will ask a lot of good questions to evaluate the candidate," said Trustee and search committee member Debbi Schwiebert. "I· am hoping it will be a wonder­ful exchange." 

A particularly warm hand has been extended to the student body. Board of Governance President Elizabeth Jablonski­Diehl sits on the committee as the student representative. Moreover, the committee is hosting student-candidate dis­cussion sessions in order to introduce the candidates and students to one another. 
The opportunity has created quite a buzz on campus. 
Freshman Jill Blanchard said that the visits have been well publicized and she looks for­ward to participating. 

''I'd like to see a president, who is outgoing enough to go out and meet the students on a personal level," said Blanchard, "and also someone who has a real desire to make the school a better place." 

The selection process has even generated excitement among seniors, although they may never attend school under the new president. 
"I realize that the new President won't affect much in just one year," said senior Molly Halm. "But you need to think about the women in the future." 
The College will also sponsor a student discussion with the presidential candidate today at noon in the Noble Family Dining Hall's west wing.

Poland suffers first Iraqi casualty 
BAGHDAD, Iraq-Poland suffered its first combat death since the aftermath of World War II when a Polish major was fatally wounded Thursday in an ambush south of Baghdad. Two American soldiers died in attacks near the capital and along the Syrian border. 
In al-Assad, a windblown desert base 150 miles northwest of Baghdad, hundreds of soldiers, some wearing ceremonial spurs and black regimental hats, remembered the com­rades killed last weekend when their heli­copter was shot down in the deadliest single attack against U.S. forces since the Iraq war began March 20.

Rival politicians and health care profes­sionals criticized the plan from Prime Minister Jean-Pierre RafTarin as too little, too late. Also, France's bishops complained about the loss of the holiday, which falls on the Monday after the Christian festival of Pentecost.

Opponents call bake sale racist 
BLOOMINGTON. -A bake sale in Indiana University's Dunn Meadow drew a crowd ­and a debate -when it offered cookies for sale at different prices depending on the buyer's race or gender. 
The sale Wednesday was organized by a conservative student group called the Committee for Freedom, who said the event was intended as a protest of affirmative action. 
White males were charged $1 per cookie. The price was 75 cents for white women, Asians and Pacific Islanders; 50 cents for Hispanics and American Indians; and 25 cents for blacks. Conservative groups have held similar protests at several colleges across the country in recent months. 



New deployments announced

WASHINGTON -The

Thursday to send 85,000 
Army and Marine combat 
forces to Iraq early next 
year to relieve troops com­

rotation that when com­

they may be sent as well. 
The moves are part of a rotation plan that assumes Iraqis will be capable of contributing enough to the battle against the anti­occupation insurgency that the number of American troops in Iraq can be reduced from 131,600 today to 105,000 by May, senior officials said. 
In an added twist, the Army announced that sol­diers in every unit desig­nated for deployment to Iraq next year -whether active-duty or reserve ­will be prohibited from leaving the service during a period beginning 90 days before they go to 90 days after they return.

Canada-U.S. drug firm shut down 
Associated Press 
TULSA -A federal judge granted the government's request Thursday to shut down a U.S. company that helps cus­tomers buy cheaper prescrip­tion drugs from Canada. 
The decision is a blow to cus­tomers who use Rx Depot's 85 storefronts nationwide to buy less expensive medicine. It also could affect cities and states that are considering allowing employees to import drugs to 
cut prescription costs. 
U.S. District Judge Claire Eagan wrote that the Tulsa-based company, also known as Rx Canada, offers lower prices only because it facili­tates "illegal activ­ity determined by Congress to harm the public inter­est." 
Only manufac­turers are allowed 
to bring medicines into the country. The judge found that Rx Depot "openly and notori­ously" violated the law. 
Americans have long flocked to Canada to fill prescriptions that can cost less than half the drugs' U.S. price because of currency exchange rates and government price controls. But what began with patients cross­ing the border to buy their own drugs has developed in the past year into a booming Internet and mail-order business. 
The FDA and U.S. drug com­panies have criticized the prac­tice, saying they can't guaran­tee the safety of Canadian drugs. 
"This ruling sends a clear sig­nal that those who would put profit before safety will not be allowed to threaten the public health," the Food and Drug Administration said in a state­ment Thursday. 
Carl Moore, Rx Depot's founder, said he had not seen the ruling Thursday but would

"I'm going to do my part to see drug prices lowered in this country," Moore said. "If I have to change my way of thinking to comply with the judge's ruling, I'll do so." 
Also Thursday, the FDA accused Ontario-based CanaRx of shipping illegal drugs into the United States, misleading consumers about safety and 
putting people at 
risk. 
Anthony Howard 
said his company is "not breaking any laws in Canada or in the United States." 
The mayor of Springfield, Mass., the first city to allow its employees to buy drugs from Canada through CanaRx, said the city won't be deterred by the FDA. 
..We are not intimidated in Springfield, Mass., and we are not going to be intimidated," said Mayor Michael Albano. He dismissed the idea that drugs 1 bought by his city's employees from Canadian pharmacies were unsafe.

Three days later, he was standing in a U.S. compound near Samarra north of Baghdad when soldiers brought in the Iraqi man's bloody body. The soldiers told Pogany the man was killed after he was seen shooting a rocket-propelled grenade. 
Pogany said he was shaken, couldn't focus and kept vomit­ing. He told his commanders he believed he was suffering from panic attacks or a nerv­ous breakdown and requested counseling. 
At least one officer suggested he consider what such a request would do to his career, Pogany said. When he sought help, "I was told that I was wasting their time,'' Pogany said. 
Pogany was examined by psychologist Capt. Marc Houck, who concluded he had signs consistent with normal combat stress reaction. Houck recommended Pogany be given a brief rest before returning to duty, but he was sent home to Fort Carson in mid-October and charged with "cowardly conduct as a result of fear." 

Thursday afternoon by Fort 
Carson officials. A military 
court hearing set Friday for 
Pogany was canceled. 
The new charge was filed by the company commander after military judges dismissed the cowardice charge, officials said. "He believes that this charge is most appropriate to address the alleged miscon­duct based upon the evidence that is currently available," an Army statement said. 
Army officials did not imme­diately return phone calls for comment. Neither did Pogany nor his attorney. 
Attorney Frank Spinner, a retired Air Force colonel who handles military cases, said dereliction of duty is a minor offense that, if disposed of without a court-martial, usual­ly is penalized by loss of pay or reduction in rank. 
With a court-martial, the maximum penalty is several months confinement, said Spinner, of Colorado Springs. Whether a court-martial is held depends on the military judiciary.

Cowardice violations can be punished by death. Military code does not include a mini­mum sentence. 
Army officials have declined to discuss the case. 
Cowardice charges are rare. The last such conviction in the Army occurred during the Vietnam War. Charges were filed against a married couple during the Gulf War, but reduced to mistreatment of public property, said Eugene Fidell, president of the National Institute of Military Justice. 
"You have to look pretty hard to find any of these cases," Fidell said. "We have a well-trained army that is a motivated one." 
Pogany's case and others that are similar suggest Iraqi deployments are wearing thin, said military analyst Dan Goure of the Lexington Institute, a Washington, D.C.­based think tank.

Sony, Bertelsmann to merge 
FRANKFURT, Germany -Bertelsmann AG and Sony Corp. announced a preliminary plan to merge their music businesses Thursday, setting the stage for a music company that would vie for world primacy with Universal Music Group. 
A merger of Sony Music Entertainment and Bertelsmann's BMG, if it comes to pass, would bring together the world's No. 2 and No. 5 music companies as the industry struggles with losses blamed on music piracy. 

The new company. to be called Sony BMG, would be equally owned by Sony and Bertelsmann and run by Andrew Lack, chair­man and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment. Rolf Schmidt-Holtz, the chair­man and chief executive of BMG, would serve as chairman of the board. 
Bertelsmann didn't say whether the two companies had agreed on financial terms in their letter of intent or what issues remained to be worked out before a final agreement could be struck. Patrick Reilly, a spokesman for BMG, said the two companies had agreed to hold exclusive talks, but he did not say for how long. 
Kroger to negotiate with union 
INDIANAPOLIS -Kroger Co. and the union representing workers at 58 of the chain's cen­tral Indiana supermarkets resumed negotia­tions Thursday, two days after agreeing to a seven-day contract extension amid threats of a strike. 
Kroger spokesman Jeff Golc declined to dis­cuss whether negotiators were making progress toward a settlement and would not say whether the parties had made conces­sions. 
The two sides signed the contract extension Tuesday night -hours before the contract had been set to expire-after a federal medi­ator persuaded them to give negotiations another chance. 
Golc said he did not know whether the medi­ator was directly participating in Thursday's talks, which involve the Cincinnati-based chain's 4,000 central Indiana employees rep­resented by United Food and Commercial Workers Local 700.

ROME -Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to reassure the European Union on Thursday that the legal case against his coun­try's largest oil company was fair and would not threaten the econo­my -a grave concern for nations with strong financial ties to Moscow. 
Putin tried to strengthen ties to the EU before the bloc's eastward expansion next year, but his talks at the 15-nation summit revolved around last month's jailing of Yukos oil giant founder and chief Mikhail Khodorkovsky on fraud, forgery, embezzlement and tax evasion charges.

Big deficits burden economy 
Greenspan calls for deficit reduction, but notes improvements in job market 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Soar­ing government budget deficits threaten the econ­omy in the long term and must be brought under control, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday. But in an upbeat assessment of cur­rent conditions, Greenspan said the odds "increasingly favor" the creation of new jobs. 
In a speech to the Securities Industry Association; Greenspan delivered his ·most detailed assessment of the state of the economy since testi­mony before Congress last July. 
He struck an optimistic tone, noting a growing number of signs of strength in recent months and said that even the weak job market should soon start to show improvement. 
··The odds ... do increas­ingly favor a revival in job creation," Greenspan said. 
However, in his remarks delivered by satellite to the gathering in Boca Raton, Fla., Greenspan also gave his most blunt warnings to date about the federal budget deficit, which hit a record $37 4 billion in the just complet­ed 2003 budget year and deficits rather than raising cuts or increases in other means taking reduced is projected to top $500 taxes. taxes, a rule that would benefits. billion-in 2004. ··Tax rate increases of make it hard for Bush to Asked about Greenspan's

Putin reassures EU amid charges 
A large chunk of the company's shares also were frozen. 
Putin pledged that Russian law was not being applied in a discrimi­natory way. 
"Nobody is beyond the law," Putin said after the summit in a Renaissance villa in Rome ...No matter how complicated and con­tradictory laws can be, they still have to be respected." 
Putin has taken a hard line in the $1 billion case against Khodorkovsky, insisting that the allegations be investigated thor­oughly. Critics at home and abroad have seen the probe as an attempt to curb Khodorkovsky's financial and political clout and to retaliate for his funding of opposition par­ties. 
Putin said Russia's actions regarding Yukos would not affect Russian policy or its economy. 
"Our activities are guided by the fact that we want to put our house in order," Putin said. 
Putin criticized illegal actions during post-communist privatiza­tions but indicated that Russia would not void such deals because "the consequences would be even worse." 
EU Commission President Romano Prodi said, "We have been reas­sured that the Ia w will not be applied in a discriminatory manner. We wanted this assurance because this is key for further cooperation in the economic field."

Bush pushes for democracy 
President wants to spread democracy in the Middle East 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Repudiating decades of U.S. 
policy, President Bush said 
Thursday the United States 
and its allies have been wrong 
in "excusing and accommodat­
ing" a lack of freedom in the 
Middle East. He prodded 
Saudi Arabia and Egypt to 
lead Arab nations toward 
democracy. 
Mindful of widespread anger and mistrust in the Muslim world toward the United States, Bush also said that as democratic governments emerge in the Middle East, they should reflect their own cultures and "will not and should not look like us." 
He said it would take time for democracy to spread and the United States would be "patient and understanding." 
Bush's speech appeared aimed at complaints in the Arab world that the United States has long tolerated cor­rupt, undemocratic regimes in return for stability and a reli­able supply of oil. Washington began to rethink its policy after the terrorist attacks of Sept 11, 2001, and the emer­gence of deep hostility in the Mideast toward the United States. Fifteen of the Sept. 11 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia. 
"Sixty years of Western nations excusing and accom­modating the lack of freedom in the Middle East did nothing to make us safe -and in the long run, stability cannot be purchased at the expense of liberty," the president said in a groundbreaking conclusion. 
"As long as the Middle East remains a place where free­dom does not flourish," he said, "it will remain a place of stagnation, resentment and violence ready for export. And with the spread of weapons that can bring catastrophic harm to our country and to our friends, it would be reck­less to accept the status quo." 
Bush spoke before the National Endowment for Democracy, an organization formed during the Reagan administration to promote global freedom. In another step crucial to his policy in the Middle East, Bush later signed into law an $87.5 billion increase dangers to the American people and extin­guish the hopes of millions in the region," he said. 
While a few governments have made moves toward democracy, most countries in the region are ruled by authoritarian regimes and royal families. "Basically every Arab country has an autocratic regime," said Judith Kipper of the Council on Foreign Relations. "Some are more benign than others but there's no real democracy in the Arab world." 
Bush said some 
skeptics assert the 

package for "It should be clear traditions of Islam military and are incompatible
to all that Islam ...
reconstruction with representative efforts in Iraq is consistent with government. 
a n d democratic rule ... "It should be Afghanistan clear to all that "With this act Islam -the faith of
George W. Bush
of Congress, no one-fifth of human­enemy or U.S. president ity -is consistent 
friend can doubt that America has the resources and the will to see this war through to victory," Bush said. 
Middle East scholars said Bush's appeal for democracy lacked any followup programs. 
"No new programs announced, no new money for promoting democracy -just rhetoric," said Martin Indyk, who had been assistant secre­tary of state for the Middle East in the Clinton administra­tion 
"The rhetoric isn't going to move the hardliners in Iran, Vasser Arafat or the govern­ments in Saudi Arabia and Egypt who are now scared of the consequences of the kind of political liberalization that the president is preaching to them," Indyk said. 
Bush put Iraq at the center of hopes for democracy. 
"The failure of Iraqi democ­racy would embolden terror­ists around the world, 
with democratic 

rule," the president said. He said democratic progress has been found in predominantly Muslim coun­tries including Turkey, Indonesia, Senegal, Albania, Niger and Sierra Leone. 
There was mixed reaction to 
his speech in the region. 
In Amman, Jordan, busi­nessman Khalid Salim said: "I support completely President Bush's speech concerning democracy in the Middle East and hope that his words will be in effect soon." 
However, worker Samer Hussein said angrily: "With the justification of democracy, 
Bush and the Americans plan to occupy Arab and Muslim lands. We tell him, we do not want his democracy." 
Bush said the absence of freedom in the Mideast has had terrible consequences, including widespread poverty and denial of school and rights for women. 
Regula tors seeking pop-up ad changes 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Regulators disclosed a new legal cam­paign Thursday against an annoying method for deliver­ing unwanted "pop-up" Internet advertisements, accusing a California company of "high-tech extortion" in its offers for software to block the very ads it was sending. 
The courtroom effort by the Federal Trade Commission could dampen some of the most irritating practices by Internet marketers, who have learned ways to display intru­sive messages on computer screens using a technology built into most ver­model." 
The FTC asked the judge to block D-Squared from sending any more advertisements or selling its ad-blocking soft­ware. It also wants D-Squared to repay consumers who bought its software, whkh Beales said represents "hun­dreds of thousands" of dollars. 
The head of D-Squared Solutions, Anish Dhingra, declined to comment on the government's accusations. His lawyer, Jacob C. Reinbolt, did not return repeated telephone calls to his office from The Associated Press.

said Mark Rasch, an expert on technology law and former head of the Justice Department cyber-crimes division. 
The FTC obtained a tempo­rary restraining order against D-Squared Solutions LLC of San Diego from a U.S. District Court in Baltimore. The FTC's legal papers accuse D­Squared of unlawfully exploit­ing Microsoft's "Windows Messenger Service" feature by sending unwanted ads to Internet users as frequently as once every 10 minutes. 
The director for the FTC's bureau of consumer protec­tion, Howard Beales, said company executives were "creating a problem and try­ing to charge customers for the solution." He called that "high-tech extortion" and "a fundamentally unfair business

But some Internet mar­keters have seized upon the technology to display ads for software and pornography, unless computer users manu­ally turn it off or use firewall software to block out unwant­ed messages. 
It takes seven mouse clicks to disable the messenger serv­ice; the FTC said typical con­sumers don't know how to do this. 
The FTC's legal papers allege the advertisements caused "substantial injury" to consumers, citing lost data, crashed computers, frustra­tion, annoyance and harass­ment.

Righteous Brothers Judge blocks abortion ban 
singer found dead Ruling puts hold on 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -The most-played song in U.S. radio history, "You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling," pulsed anew over the airwaves Thursday as fans mourned the death of the Righteous Brothers' Bobby Hatfield. 
Hatfield, who with partner Bill Medley were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ear­lier this year, died Wednesday in a hotel room in Kalamazoo. He was 63. 
Hatfield's body was discovered 45 minutes before the duo was to perform at Miller Auditorium on the Western Michigan University campus, manager David Cohen said. He was pro­nounced dead at 7:02p.m. EST.

Hatfield was a smoker, but Cohen said he was not aware of any chronic health problems afflicting the singer. 
"It's a shock, a real shock," Cohen said, adding that Medley was "broken up. He's not even coherent." 
The Righteous Brothers, whose other hits included "Unchained Melody," "(You're My) Soul and Inspiration" and "Rock and Roll Heaven," were in Kalamazoo to kick off four days of performances in Michigan and Ohio. 
The duo's signature 1965 sin­gle, "You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling," has been frequently cited as the most-programmed song in American radio history. The inclusion of their songs in films such as "Top Gun," "Ghost" and "Dirty Dancing" repeatedly re-established the Righteous brand. 
Hatfield's soaring tenor and Medley's polished baritone were wrapped around pop tunes dur­ing the ascendancy of guitar rock. Their style was dubbed "blue-eyed soul." 
"Sometimes people with blue eyes transcended the limitations of what their color and culture can actually be," singer Billy Joel said during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction cer­emony for the duo. "Sometimes white people can actually be soulful. This was a life-changing idea. It changed my life." 
Speaking to reporters in March, Hatfield recalled that the "blue-eyed soul" label came from disc jockeys. not him or Medley. 
"It's kind of goofy," Hatfield said.

law to block certain late-term abortions 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -In a ruling with potentially coast-to-coast effect, a federal judge blocked the gov­ernment's new ban on certain late-term abortions Thursday in a rapidly escalating legal battle that began even before President Bush signed the measure. 
The ruling was the second such setback for the Bush administration in 24 hours. 
U.S. District Judge Richard Casey granted a request by the National Abortion Federation and seven doctors to prevent enforcement of the ban until a challenge to the law's constitu­tionality can be heard. 
While the ruling applies only to the plaintiffs, it is expected to have broad application: The fed­eration -a professional associ­tions using every resource neces­sary."

An avid athlete, Hatfield con­sidered a career in professional baseball, but found his true call­ing in music -a love he pur­sued while attending Long Beach State University, where he formed a band and performed at bars and proms. 
Hatfield teamed up with Medley in 1962 as part of a five­piece group called The Paramours. According to the Righteous Brothers Web site, a black Marine called out during one of their performances, "That second or third trimester in which a fetus is partially deliv­ered before being killed, usually by puncturing its skull. Anti­abortion activists call the proce­dure "partial-birth abortion." President Clinton twice vetoed similar bills. 
The ruling follows a separate decision Wednesday by a feder­al judge in Nebraska who also blocked the ban, less than an hour after Bush signed it. Opponents of the ban had sued even before the measure became law. The Nebraska rul­ing covered four doctors, who together are licensed in 13 states across the Midwest and East, and their staffS. 
A San Francisco judge has also scheduled arguments in a similar challenge. 
Abortion-rights advocates expect a showdown over the law with the Bush administra­tion at the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Justice Department said in a statement that it "will con­tinue to strongly defend the law prohibiting partial birth abor­is necessary to protect some women's health. He said there is a good chance that those chal­lenging the law will succeed. 
The ruling should have an effect nationwide, said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. 
"It's hard to imagine the fed­eral government would try to enforce the law against anyone who might be providing abor­tions but is not a member of the protected group," Lieberman 
said. 
American Civil Liberties Union attorney Talcott Camp said it "would be quite troubling indeed if the Justice Department attempted to enforce" the ban while the chal­lenges are pending. 
"Many physicians were indeed pan­icked at the prospect of having 
tinue to die at the point of 7­inch scissors," he said. "Certainly these judicial orders severely impede the govern­ment's ability to protect these premature infants." 
Opponents of the law said it is overly broad, lacks any exemp­tion for the health of a woman seeking an abortion and could outlaw several safe and com­mon procedures. They also con­tended it is the first step in a larger campaign to ban all abor­tions and undo Roe v. Wave, the Supreme Court's 1973 land­mark decision establishing a woman's right to an abortion. 
The federal judge in New York said it is clear that some doctors believe the outlawed procedure to face criminal prosecution for providing the absolute best medical ·care they can," she said. 
In addition, legal observers said the Nebraska ruling might be more sweeping than first thought. 
They said the ruling is worded in such a way that it could allow abortion doctors across the country to skirt the law. 
While the judge stopped short of saying his order was to be enforced nationwide, he said it applied to the four doctors who filed the suit and their "col­leagues, employees and entities ... with whom plaintiffs work. teach. supervise or refer" patients.

from the student body. Last season, the 2,800 student tickets booklets sold out by noon of the second day of sales. which was in record time -until this year. Due to last season's success, even more stu­dents want tickets. and all student booklets sold in a mere four-and-a-half hours. This swift sell-out, com­bined with confusion over the distribution procedures, caused problems for students at both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's for various reasons. This included class conflicts or other commitments. 
Saint Mary's students who attempted to purchase tick­ets faced additional confusion. Many students waited in line at the Joyce Center, only to be told they were not eligible to purchase tickets. Additionally, only 125 book­lets were available for St. Mary's students to purchase. 
Though it was unlikely the University could have pre­dicted how quickly the booklets would sell out, it must 
without missing class. The final option could be to sell a limited number of student tickets for individual games a day prior to the game, and then release any remaining tickets for purchase by the gener­al public. Students would then control whether they received tickets based on who chose to wait in line the longest. 
In light of the strong interest at Saint Mary's, the University must also allot more tickets to those students and provide clear instructions on how to obtain them. 
As the men's team continues to achieve high success and generate increased enthusiasm among fans, the University must understand that more than 2,800 stu­dents will want to watch the team at home. It must · adopt an improved distribution plan that will make the ticket allocation fair for every student who wishes to attend the games. 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Don't limit business majors 
I was disturbed to read that Notre Dame is considering limit­ing the number of students who can enroll in the undergradu­ate business school because the proportion of business majors at Notre Dame is "extremely high relative to the average per­centage of undergraduate business majors at Notre Dame's top 20 peer institutions." according to a Nov. 6 article. 
We have an outstanding business program. It's very popular among students, and it's producing successful people. How is this a problem beyond assuring that there's enough cla,ssroom space and professors? 
Well, it's a problem at Notre Dame because the universities we want to emulate, our "aspirational peers," don't have the same enrollment mix. We don't have the pride and self-respect

Israel, the bane of Europe 
The European Commission recently conduct­ed a poll asking citizens in its member states which country poses the greatest threat to world peace. Any guesses who took first prize? The United States? North Korea? China? Luxembourg? No, no, no and no. The most dangerous country, hell­bent on world domina­

tion is in fact Israel. 
Polls should usually be taken with a grain of salt, particularly ones A Voice of that only gauge opinions Reason and sentiments instead of potential voting habits, but this one is quite astounding. Who would have thought that Israel, a small country virtually surrounded by nations who resent its very existence, could strike such fear into the hearts of men and women alike? 
Unfortunately, this does not seem to be an aberration, as reports of this nature simply echo the rise of a new European anti-Semitism. Personally, I figured that post-modern Europe had moved beyond such antipathy after its last bad experience which started out as a whole "let's gang up on the Jews" movement, but recent incidents prove otherwise. 
A swarm ofanti-Semitic crimes is on the rise, ranging from verbal abuse and monument defamation to the firebombing oftemples and synagogues. Normally, one must remain skepti­cal about the popularity ofsuch movements that could represent only a fringe ofthe population, but incidents on a national level raise eyebrows as well. At least five countries have banned kosher food production, central to the orthodox spiritual lifestyle. Germany decided to halt all arms sales to Israel, despite being a steadfast supporter for decades. An international confer­ence on sanctions and divestment in London last year endorsed a boycott of Israel "not dis­similar to the campaign \}'hich contributed to the end ofapartheid in South Africa." 
After Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad boldly proclaimed that "the Europeans killed six million Jews out of 12 mil­lion, but today the Jews rule the world by proxy," the European Union considered but ulti­mately decided against condemning his igno­rant, hateful remarks. After instances ofthis nature, much ofthe world's Jewish population justifiably fears that the most powerful European officials are turning a blind eye towards blatant anti-Semitism. 
Admittedly, these decisions stem from a vari­ety of political factors with non-bigoted ratio­nales. The issues of Israeli sovereignty and Palestinian statehood are hotly debated throughout the world, as anyone who hears an argument against radical Islamic suicide bombers could counter with a list of alleged 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Support tradition of winning 
This is in response to Kathleen Tallmadge's Nov. 4 letter. While I understand her love for the team and wish to cheer them on through the darkest times, I think she fails to see the most important point. 
At Notre Dame, the most important tradition is winning. Not at all costs, but winning the right way. That is how Notre Dame football became as popular and as traditioned as it is today -they win, and they win the right way. 
Does anyone really think that the Notre Dame football tradition would be the same if we had 0 national championships, 0 Heisman winners, but we just tried our best each and every year? Of course not. All our traditions, from the gold helmets to the band to Touchdown Jesus and so on, stem from the fact that we are historically the winningest team in college football, ever. 
If, as Tallmadge says, "The achievement is in the journey -whether or not we ever reach the pinnacle of success is irrelevant," then the football tradition is endangered. If seasons continue the way this one has, then all Notre Dame will become is a past glory who can't keep up anymore. 
Banking on past traditions is important and expected, but it must be complemented by continued success on the field. If you don't believe me, ask the former greats of the college football world: Navy, Army, Princeton and the University of Chicago.

Israeli human rights violations and vice versa. 
But come on, my European friends. Almost 60 
percent ofyou have filled your nightmare-void 
left vacant when the "evil" Soviet Union fell with 
Israel? There must be something in the water. 
No level of political enmity towards Israel can validate this alarming statistic, so one must con­sider anti-Semitism as a potential explanation. When one carefully scrutinizes our national news sources, from The New York Tunes to MSNBC, Europe comes off as the most enlight­ened continent in the world with moral authori­ty so high that many a peacenik object to America's foreign policy because European sen­timents are not in our favor. While seriously considering our allies' positions on global affairs is an important goal, questioning the Old World's rational and intellectual integrity should be as well. 
The poll is heavily skewed against Israel, but anti-Americanism is almost equally rampant throughout Europe. Correlation between the two is not unreasonable by any stretch ofthe mind, which could partially explain why Europeans now hit the streets in droves to protest attacks in Afghanistan and Iraq. These two countries, one a theocracy and the other a secular dictatorship, both opposed Israel for their own respective reasons, and American action in the region aims to discourage the rise of military power in Syria, Iran and other coun­tries with an anti-Israeli agenda. 
On the other hand, these poll results may sim­ply reflect overwhelming anti-Americanism, with Israel as the temporary scapegoat. A European might consider challenges to world peace from the United States and its enemies to be rooted in America's strong support of Israel, and this relationship leads to crisis after crisis in the Middle East. This argument has some merit, as hating the big bad guy America seems mar­ginally more rational but fails to account for such the strong Israel-fearing majority that the poll suggests. 
The European Commission knows that the poll results make the continent look terrible, and early press reports thwarted an attempted suppression of their findings. Whether this por­tion of Europeans is resoundingly anti-Semitic or just plain anti-American, the most obvious conclusion to draw is that their opinions on international affairs may be more rooted in xenophobia or naive hatred than we previously believed.

How many more body bags, President Bush? 
President Bush contends that the number ofdead American soldiers has no connection to how well the Iraqi campaign is progressing. Yet the number of killings in Iraq lies in the hands of the man who ordered American soldiers into

the

public or the world to support the 
U.S. invasion, our troops are on Iraqi soil. More reservists are scheduled to serve long terms in Iraq, and American soldiers will remain as walking targets. It is so because they are there. 
It is also laughable to watch the president's new public relations blitz against the "bad news" com­ing from Iraq. Where is Fox News, the same network the president proclaimed as his favorite news outlet? Could its "fair and bal­anced" reporting be dependent on television ratings? Surely had Al Gore been president on Sept. 11, Fox would today be running a ban­ner at the bottom ofits screen 
screaming, "Day 788 ofbin Laden still at large" and "Day 191 since the president declared major hostil­ities ended in Iraq and Hussein still at large." 
Not showing those banners each day should be good news for Bush. Or maybe, even Fox cannot ignore the average 10 injuries per day Others contend that Clinton could 
have done more against Osma bin 
Laden. Clinton did believe that 
Hussein had weapons of mass 
destruction and did threaten to use 
military force against Iraq. Clinton 
also fired missiles at bin Laden's 
training camps. 
Where Clinton differs from Bush is that Clinton knew how to engage the international community. Yet Clinton could not adequately address foreign terror threats while he lost more than a year defending himself against impeachment. At the time, Republicans were por­traying his actions as diversions or "wagging the dog" stunts. 
Bush's bullying of the United Nations and unilateral invasion with a small coalition with few troops and little money for Iraq is Bush's own undoing. The presi­dent's actions cannot be undone by any public relations effort. To many foreign observers, Bush's parsing of words to scare Americans to sup­port an immediate invasion of Iraq was as masterful as Clinton's defini­tion of"is." 
Bush should have contended that it was his personal judgment for the timing and urgency of the inva­sion. The American public would 
not have doubted him as much as they are today for his assertions that Hussein would soon attack or give his weapons to terrorists. Bush also molded a blurry connection between Sept. 11 and Hussein, for which he has since had to deny. 
One year from this week 
Americans will judge Bush at 

troops surrendered early in the conflict? The British BBC reported that the general had turned himself in but nobody knew if any of his 3,000 troops would surrender since many of his officers were loyal to Saddam Hussein. The White House used the American media for false good news then but criticizes the media for true bad news now. 
At the war's height, many anti­war prot~sters relied on foreign reporting. Conservative commenta­tors scoffed at the notion ofthe for­eign press being more truthful than the American press. Today those conservatives seem to have reversed themselves since they complain about the negative truth aired by American outlets. 
Some have chastised Democrats and President Clinton for their past assertions that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. 
also holding this president accountable for the number of American soldiers dying in Iraq by asking when the body bags will cease from Iraq. 
Democrats know the answer. When a new president enters the White House in 2005 and engages the international community unlike Bush will or can, only then will the United States be respected in the Middle East. Only then will help be on the way for U.S. troops in Iraq.

and more U.S. soldiers killed since their favorite viewer landed G.I. George style on an aircraft carrier than during the war. 
When the United States invaded Iraq, the White House sought "good news." Bush never corrected false reports of Jessica Lynch's cap­ture because he wanted a hero. A 69­year-old Korean War Navy veteran won­dered why her capture qualified her as a hero. He said, "Now Audie Murphy was a hero."

he is very good at convincing the girls to confess. Many of the ministers of the period 

were known for having passionate sermons predicting fire, brimstone, and eternal suf­fering when God inflicts his vengeful wrath on the wicked. Farren chooses to connect that character with a contemporary audi­ence by using televange­lists as his inspiration. A mix between Ned Flanders and those Sunday morning preachers, Farren suc­be worse than dying. 
Another commanding male performance is turned in by Louis MacKenzie, who plays Deputy Governor Danforth. He is responsi­ble for trying and convicting the accused girls. He has a stern demeanor, yet not overly powerful, and is fair without being merciful, as the role demands. He is very controlling in the courtroom, as any judge would be, and is very contemplative, yet shows no emotion. MacKenzie plays the role with a controlling presence but also as a character that possesses a lot of self-con­trol. His role as the Deputy Governor con­trasts very well with that of Vini DeDario, who plays Judge Hathorne. DeDario plays the role with a brash outspokenness that highlights the controlled demeanor of MaeKenzie as Danforth. 
Perhaps the most vocally demanding role is that of Mary Warren, played by Maria Corso, the servant to the Proctor family who is caught in the middle of the conflict between Abigail and Proctor. She spends some of the first part, and much of the sec­ond whimpering, crying, or wailing:-three things not easily done for long periods of time in the acting world. She is very con­vincing though, in her suffering, and adds depth to what could simply be played as a superficial character that screams all the time. 
Other' strong supporting roles include Proctor's friend Giles Corey, an honest, eld­erly man played by Terry Dawson. Linda Janke plays the role of Ann Putnam along with William Svelmoe as her husband, Thomas. Janke and Svelmoe add much

through saving the lives of 
the condemned. He turns into a passionate, 
desperate man who wants Proctor and the 
others to confess, if only to save their lives. 
He provides a sharp contrast with the "holi­
er than thou" figurehead of the first part of 
the play and now places himself on the level 
of the prisoners. 
Yost perfectly incorporates the two-sided 
nature of Abigail in her performance. When 
she is alone with the girls, she is a cocky, 
wicked leader of the incident, who is out to 
save her own skin. In front of authority, she 
plays the innocent girl, who is repentant for 
her transgressions. When Abbey is with 
John Proctor, she is a seductress who will 
stop at nothing to get her man. Yost clearly 
defines and beautifully balances these per­
sonas. 
Rutz, in the role of Proctor's wife 
Elizabeth, uses traditional views of colonial women as her motivation. She is quiet, firm, and devout with her faith. She is very reserved around her husband, as anyone would be around an adulterous spouse. One of their earlv scenes alone at the dinner table is reminiscent of the distant relation­ship of Charles and Emily at the end of the dinner table scene in "Citizen Kane." Her role slowly transforms, and Rutz becomes a wife desperate to save her husband, but ·resolved to the fact that confessing would 
somehow struggles to 
convince the audience of 
his role in the play. 
"The Crucible" is a 

unique theater experi­ence highlighted even more by powerful performances. In the end, the story is less about a historical perspective of the events of 1692, and more about the place of authority in religion, the means by which to gain redemption and salvation and the search to find goodness in a world of evil and lies. 
Arthur Miller wrote the play during the Red Scare of communism to mock what was very similar to the Salem Witch Hunts of early America. His work proves to show both the silliness and frustration behind accusing people for belonging to groups without proper evidence along with the skewed roles that authority, particularly the courts, have in society.

NBA 
Johnson leads Pacers to win over former team 

New Jersey's Jason Kldd gets run over by former teammate Anthony Johnson In the first period of Indiana's 87-81 win. 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. ­Instead of backing up Jason Kidd, Anthony Johnson got the best of him. 
Johnson hit two straight three pointers to hold off a late rally by his former New Jersey team­mates and the Indiana Pacers won their third straight game, 87-81 Thursday night. 
"It's not personal." -said Johnson, who had 17 points in 22 minutes ofT the bench. "You always want to show a team what they had and what they let get away." 
Johnson spent the last two seasons as Kidd's backup, help­ing New Jersey win consecutive Eastern Conference titles. 
While the Nets re-signed Kidd, they let Johnson go and he signed with the Pacers. 
"A situation came up over the summer and they decided to go in a different direction," Johnson said. "You pick up and go and 
move on." Kidd wasn't surprised to see Johnson win the game. 
"A.J. is very confident," Kidd said after the Nets wiped out all but two points of a 19-point deficit. "He loves to hit the big basket or find the open guy. That's the A.J. I know." 
Ron Artest had 21 points and Jermaine O'Neal 15 for the Pacers who built their big lead by holding the Nets to 12 sec­ond-quarter points. 
"I am stunned," Nets coach Byron Scott said. "I do not understand why we are not play­ing with the type of energy that we are accustomed to seeing." 
Kerry Kittles had 23 points and nine rebounds to lead the Nets, who struggled with their shooting for the second straight game. Richard Jefferson added 18, and Aaron Williams had 15 points and 11 rebounds. Kidd finished with 10 points and eight assists after a 4-for-13 shooting night.

The coach says leaving North Carolina's coach, Kansas was not easy. And he Williams realized how much insists that rebuilding North had changed at the school he has always adored. 
"I had some North Carolina people criticize my actions at the press conference because I wasn't standing on the table doing cartwheels," Williams said. "But I told them it was because, six hours before, I'd just had the most difficult meeting of my life." 
That was the meeting where he said goodbye to Kansas, the school he nurtured for 15 sea­sons. He took the Jayhawks to 14 NCAA tournaments, four Final Fours and two title games, including a 81-78 loss to Syracuse last season. 
Three years ago, when Bill Guthridge left as Smith's replacement -he didn't quite live up to standards despite two Final Four trips ­Williams was the top choice to replace hi:r:n. He almost took the job, but ultimately declined. 
It was a gut-wrenching deci­sion, and the one thing he regrets is what he told Kansas fans when he announced he was stayil)g. 
"I told them if I ever had another press conference like this, it'd be because I was either retiring or dying," Williams said. 
Instead, three years later, he had one to announce that, yes, this time, he really was leaving. 
Why this time? 

"There was the feeling that I'd been very unhappy off the court the last year and a half," Williams said. The coach was in a well-documented spat with former athletic director AI Bohl, who was fired after the Final Four in what many viewed as Kansas' final 

attempt to make Williams happy. 
Another reason was Smith, who Williams claims never put overt pressure on him to return. But, after Doherty was asked to resign, Smith called his protege. 
"He said, 'We need you more this time,'" Williams said.. 
So, he ended up back at his old stomping grounds, where he played freshman ball, then worked as an assistant. 
"I was a Tar Heel born. When I die, I'll be a Tar Heel dead,'' he said the day he became the North Carolina coach.

Brovvni~plorestea~ 
to stop inner fighting 
Associated Press 
ALAMEDA, Calif. -As the 
longest-tenured member of the 
Oakland Raiders, Tim Brown 
decided it was about time he 
talked to his frustrated team­
mates. 
The message: Shut up and play. 
Brown addressed the Raiders (2-6) this week in an effort to get them back on track after the franchise's worst start in 39 years and the public criticism cornerback Charles Woodson had of second-year coach Bill Callahan. 
Callahan initiated a meeting with Woodson on Wednesday, saying they worked things out. Woodson called Callahan stub­born and said he had lost control of his team and that the Raiders were falling apart. He last went ofT after Oakland's 23-13 loss at Detroit last Sunday. 
"There will be no more com­ments about all this stuff that has been happening," said the 37-year-old Brown, who's been with the Raiders since they drafted him in the first round in 1988. "I think that was the right thing to do, the smart thing to do, and the best thing to do for this team, which is more impor­tant. 
"Talk about football, talk about the Jets, talk about football games, but all this other stuff is not going to get us anywhere at this particular point." 
The Raiders have been looking for leadership at a time they seem so vulnerable. Quarterback Rich Gannon is injured, and so is backup Marques Tuiasosopo, leaving third-stringer Rick Mirer to start Sunday's game against the New York Jets. Many vocal members of Oakland's offensive line -Mo Collins, Frank Middleton and Lincoln Kennedy -have been battling injuries. So have several defensive stars, such as John Parrella and Dana Stubblefield. 
"You can say whatever you want to say in this locker room, there's freedom of speech," Middleton said. "Nobody is mad at C-Wood and nobody is mad at Bill Callahan. They're two guys who have different feelings about each other. I'll leave it at that." 
Brown believes the Raiders were approaching "a very divi­sive situation" only eight games removed from their Super Bowl loss to Tampa Bay. The Raiders are ofT to their worst start since beginning 1-6-1 in 1964. 
"I have seen some divisive situ­ations around here," Brown said. "And at this point in my career, I do not want to be going through that kind of stuff. It was­n't just me. There were other guys speaking, too. I think at some point you have got to trust a veteran's judgment in that kind of a situation. It's not like you've got people who want to run to the microphone and say things. We don't have that going on." 
Brown even offered to let his teammates blame him for all the problems instead of their coach­es or other players. About 10 of the Raiders watched the Patriots-Broncos Monday night game at Brown's house. 
PGA 

Howell, Perry sit atop tourney 
Associated Press 

HOUSTON -Ten minutes after he watched his par putt spin out of the hole to end an aggravating day, Tiger Woods changed into shorts and a sleeveless shirt, then strapped on his fingerless gloves to go lift weights. 
"It might be a little heavier this time," Woods said of his workout. 
If anything, he needed to work off some steam Thursday. 
In a pressure-packed finale of the PGA Tour season, Woods had no trouble distancing him­self from chief rival Vijay Singh in the first round of the Tour Championship. 
It's the other dozen guys ahead of him that present the problem. 
Charles Howell III and Kenny Perry led the way Thursday, each with a 4-under 67 in the tricky breezes at Champions Golf Club to tie for the lead. 
Woods was tied for the lead at one point after a brilliant start in which he put five strokes between him and Singh after the first five holes. 
But he let a good round get away with three straight bogeys on the back nine, including a three-putt on the par-S 13th, for a 1-under 70 that left him tied for 13th. 
"I hit two bad shots, and that was it," Woods said. "The rest were mostly putting mistakes." 
Singh was even worse, using his putter 36 times in a round of 73 that kept him at the bot­tom of the leaderboard throughout the day. 
"I let the putts get away from me," Singh said. "And I got very tentative after that." over Woods and knows what

means just as much to Howell, who is des­perate not to end the season without a victory. 
"Am I frustrated for not win­ning this year? Yeah, a little bit," Howell said. "I don't think you can ever give yourself an 'A' for the season without a win." 
Perry, who had eight consec­utive finishes in the top 10 this summer, had the only bogey­free round at Champions. 

"Hopefully, that ball will keep flying at the flag and I keep making putts," Perry said. 
Fred Funk, Jerry Kelly and Chris DiMarco all had a 3­under 68. 
Only 16 players in the 31­man field of top money-win­ners managed to break par. 
Most of the focus was on Singh and Woods, a final pair­ing that figured to set the tone for the week at Champions. 
Singh has a $768,494 lead 
Woods, mean­time, looked more determined than he has all year. 
He hit a 4-iron over a canyon into 10 feet on No. 4, then moved to the top of the leader­board with a S-iron from 225 yards that landed softly on the flat part of the green and stopped 2 feet from the cup at the par-5 fifth for a tap-in eagle. 
Woods appeared to be mak­ing a statement: Hold onto those PGA Tour player of the year ballots, and don't take his name off the money title tro­phy just yet. 
But it all fell apart on three holes. 
With one swing -a drive that sailed to the right and into the trees on No. 11 -all the momentum was gone. Woods whipped his body around and slammed his club into the ground, and bogeys started appearing on his card with alarming regularity. 
He had to chip out and

missed a 20-footer for par. 
On the par-3 12th, he barely got his bunker shot out of the trap, and beat the rake handle with his wedge. Woods had to make a 6-footer just to save bogey. 
The real shocker was on his final par 5, No. 13, which was playing downwind. He drove into the left rough, hit into a bunker and then three-putted for bogey from 35 feet.

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Carroll, Chow have USC winning with game plan 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -The lights
' 
on the second floor of Heritage Hall burn late into the night while they plot and scheme, map out moves and consider contingencies. 
USC coach Pete Carroll, offen­sive coordinator Norm Chow and the Trojans' staff have shown a knack for hatching winning strategies. 
A lot of x-ing and o-ing? "Always," Carroll said, smil­ing and nodding. 
The players take note of the midnight oil-burning in the coaches' room -and its results. 
"You don't win by accident," said wide receiver Keary Colbert, one of only four seniors on the Trojans' high-powered offense. ''I'm impressed with their ability to call plays for cer­tain situations. It's kind of like they know what the other peo­ple are going to do. 
"They're here all day, all night. I tip my hat to them, fully respect them for what they do." 
The Trojans (8-1, 4-1 and tied atop the Pac-1 0) are second behind Oklahoma in both The Associated Press poll and the Bowl Championship Series standings. It's their highest ranking in the poll since they were No. 2 for a while in 1988, and their highest ranking yet in the BCS standings. 
USC moved up one slot in the poll and two in the BCS by beat­ing then-No. 6 Washington State 43-16 last weekend, a victory that came in seemingly typical fashion. Ahead 15-10 at half­time, USC stuck to its game plan, made a few small halftime adjustments and outscored the Cougars 28-6 in the second half. 
The Trojans are off this week­end, their second of three byes this year. They play at Arizona on Nov. 15. 
Carroll, who enjoys relating to the players and enjoys that part of his job, obviously also likes the strategy end of it. 
"We do a great deal of self­scouting and we go about it as our opponents would," he said. "You always want to know what the other guys know. So we hopefully know what they know -and more, if we're fortu­nate." 
The game itself then becomes a bit of a chess match. 
"When you know what you've got and what you're doing, then you know what other people have to do to attack you. When you know that, you can see it coming, or at least respond quickly," Carroll explained. 
"A lot of it is waiting for them to do the things they should do, then adjusting as they go through it." 
Carroll, 51, brought a rich coaching background to USC when he arrived in 2000, including 16 years as either a defensive coach or head coach in the NFL. 
Trojans athletic director Mike Garrett has called Carroll a "defensive genius, one of the few around." 
Chow, 57, is considered an offensive guru, particularly in developing quarterbacks. He spent 27 years on the staff at Brigham Young where he tutored Steve Young, Jim McMahon, Marc Wilson, Ty Detmer, Gifford Nielsen and Robbie Bosco. Chow then spent the 2000 season at North Carolina State, where he helped develop Philip Rivers as a fresh­man. 
Last year, Chow's third at USC, Trojans· quarterback Carson Palmer won the Heisman Trophy. This season, redshirt sophomore Matt Leinart has become one of the nation's best passers.

SAN DIEGO -Closer Trevor Hoffman was so intent on staying with the San Diego Padres that he was willing to take a big pay cut. 
The Padres had a $10 million option on Hoffman for next season but had no intention of picking it up after he missed the first five months of last season while recovering from two offseason shoulder opera­tions. 
Instead, they bought him out for $2 million and agreed to a new deal with a $2.5 million salary next year and a chance to make another $500,000 in incen­tives. 
"It's an opportunity to show the team that I am going to be healthy and that I plan on pitching a few more years beyond this contract," Hoffman said Wednesday night, "This is home." 
Hoffman, fifth on the career saves list with 352, said he didn't consider testing the free-agent mar­ket. 
"I just consider myself a Padre," he said. "The thought of going some­place else was real dis­turbing, to be real honest." 
The new deal also has an option for 2005 that Hoffman can guarantee by reaching certain perform­ance levels. General man­ager Kevin Towers would not be specific, but said the numbers should be easily attained if the reliever has a good season. 
''I'm not going to say this was easy. It was complicat­ed because of his injury," Towers said. "But it was pretty clear that Trevor wanted to wear only one uniform, the Padres' uni­form, and we wanted him to stay in a Padres' uni­form." 
Hoffman made $9 mil­lion in 2003, the last year of a $32 million, four-year contract. 
"He knew he'd have to take a much smaller base and prove to us and prove to the rest of baseball that he can perform at the level he did before the injury," Towers said. 
The 36-year-old right­hander is known for his intense stare, high leg kick and wicked changeup. All but two of his saves have come with the Padres. 
Hoffman didn't have any saves last season. Stuck in last place in the NL West, the Padres didn't want to rush Hoffman after he returned in September. His nine appearances were all in non-save situations and spaced out by three days. 

IN BRIEF 
UN officer runs NYC 
course twice in one day 
NEW YORK -A United Nations officer thought running the New York City Marathon was so nice he did it twice. 
Kevin Shelton-Smith ran 26.2 miles in the morning before the official race started, then covered another 26.2 miles along with the rest of the field in the actual marathon. 
"I'm always looking for a new challenge to find the limits of my body -to be all you can be,.. said the 43-year-old Englishman, a peacekeeping air operations officer for the UN and an accomplished marathoner. 
Shelton-Smith started in Central Park at 5 a.m. ET and ran the course from the finish line to the start, stopping along the way to talk with race volunteers. He reached the race staging area at Fort Wadsworth on the Staten Island 
side of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 3 hours, 45 minutes. 
That gave Shelton-Smith about 90 minutes to rest before taking off with the rest of the 35,286 entrants at the official start of 10:10 a.m. 
Running conservatively at the start to feel stronger in the later stages of the race, Shelton-Smith finished the official marathon in 
3:35:45. Last year, he finished the marathon in 2:47. 
Man charSled with theft of 
Stenson's SUV 
PHOENIX-A man found driving a vehicle that belonged to slain Cincinnati Reds outfielder Dernell Stenson was booked on a charge of possession of stolen property, police said Thursday. 
The man, Kevin Riddle, was arrested and jailed Wednesday night about two hours after Stenson was found dead in the Phoenix sub­urb of Chandler, police said. 
No other charges were filed against Riddle, whom police called an "investigative lead." Police said they didn't know if the two men knew each other. 
Stenson's body was found Wednesday by police responding to a report of shots fired. He appeared to have been shot and run over by the SUV, authorities said. 
Stenson, 25, made his major league debut this season and played 37 games for the Reds. He hit .247 with three home runs and 13 RBis -his homer accounted for Cincinnati's final run of the season. 
Stenson was playing this month for the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League. He was hitting .394, third-best in the league, in 18 games. 
Stenson was a third-round draft pick of the Boston Red Sox in 1996. He stayed in their system until this year, when the Reds claimed him off waivers during spring training.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL FOOTBALL 
Badin, Cavanaugh face off for right to go to Stadium 
By KATIE WAGNER and 
RACHEL SCHIROS 
Sports Writers 
For Cavanaugh and Badin, there truly is no ··1" in team. Both play a game incorporating their whole squad, and the lack of individual superstars on these teams should make for an extremely close semifinals match. 
.. Both defenses have been stingy over the season, so there probably won't be a ton of points put on the board, which makes execution on offense critical," Badin captain Jenn Carter said. "This game could easily be decided by a dropped pass or a failed extra point". 
Cavanaugh's impressive 5-1 regular season record placed them as the Blue League's top team. This gave them a bye into the semi-finals. 
Badin's having a lower seed than Cavanaugh forced them to play a semifinals qualifying game. Last Sunday, they shut out McGlinn 28-0. Carter thinks that playing this game has given Badin an advantage over the Chaos. 
··1 think having the three seed actually worked in our favor," Carter said, .. as we got a chance to play a game last week, while they haven't played since before break, and it was a loss." 
Cavanaugh captain Jessica Leibowitz is not bothered by the break, since her squad has certainly still been playing a lot of football. 
..We've been practicing a lot," Leibowitz said, ..We've definite­ly gotten better [since the regu­lar season]". 
Contrary to what Badin might expect, Cavanaugh's regular season-ending loss to Pasquerilla West has actually been very helpful for them. This only loss for Cavanaugh has taught the team to become more aware of its weaknesses. 
"We learned a lot from that game," Leibowitz said. 
Even with the lack of a stand­out player, both teams are still optimistic with their chances on the field. 
Cavanaugh sophomore Lisa Ruffer is a first year starting quarterback. 
"She's stepped up a lot this year, everyone has noticed that. She's just been outstanding" Leibowitz said. "Overall we've been playing really well. We just have to be ready for any­thing". 
Cavanaugh and Badin will fight to play in Notre Dame Stadium at the West Quad field at 4 p.m. Sunday. 
Welsh vs. Lewis 
Welsh Family plans on taking the Chicks by storm in the play­off match up this Sunday, but 
the Lewis Hall team has no 
intention of being blown down 
from its perch at the top of the 
standings. 
Lewis has the best record in the women's division, winning all six of its games this season. This is a notable amount of progress since last season when they went 3-3, missing the playoffs by one game. 
..It is the excellent coaching that has truly separated this year from last," senior defen­sive lineman Chantal DeAlcuaz said 
Welsh Family, with the fifth­place and lowest ranking of teams still in final round con­tention, finished the regular season at 4-2. The Whirlwinds are a force to contend with, however, as they proved in last Sunday's 19-0 shutout against Breen-Phillips. 
"Everything was working against Breen-Phillips," senior Jamie McEldowney said. ··we just came together like we've been trying to all season. People made the pull and con­nected on passes. It came down to the fundamentals." 
The win was especially signif­icant because in their opening game against the same team the Whirlwinds had been shutout 13-0. 
"It was important to prove to ourselves we were better than that," McEldowney said. "It really boosted our self confi­
dence as individuals and as a 
team." 
While the Chicks haven't had 
a game in several weeks, they 
have still been hard at work. 
"I can't say enough about the enthusiasm, even just in mak­ing every practice," senior cap­tain Erin Nasrallah said. 
Welsh's Whirlwinds find their strength this season coming not necessarily from specific team members, as has been the case in years past, but from the efforts of the entire team all working together. 
..Our coaches have done such an excellent job -newcomers are fit well into the team while at the same time older players are also improving," McEldowney said. 
Heading into the final games, the team looks to continue its work on executing passes on offense and making the pulls on defense. 
The Lewis team knows it will be tough to beat, as promised by a defense against whom a touchdown hasn't been scored since the first game. At the same time, they appreciate what a privilege it is to play this far into the season. 
"We are strong as a team and we have really great competi­tors as well," DeAlcuaz said. 
Welsh is equally anticipating the weekend's game. "It has definitely been a fun time. We are all very excited to

Salas falls in opening round of Indoor Championships 
Specia,l to The Observer 
Notre Dame senior co-cap­tain Alicia Salas ranked 63rd nationally in singles, fell 6-3, 6-3 to No. 8 Alexis Gordon of Florida Thursday afternoon in the Miami Varsity Tennis Center in the opening round of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association's National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships, the second leg of the collegiate grand slam. 
Following her loss to the tour­nament's No. 4 seed, Salas will compete in consolation action beginning today. 
The match marked the sec­ond time this fall that Gordon topped Salas, with the Gator also prevailing 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 in the quarterfinals of the ··adi" flight in September's adidas Invitational. 
Salas is 11-5 this fall, with her defeats coming against the Nos. 4, 7, 8, 8 and 27 players in the nation. She has eight victories against ranked foes. 

She is the first Irish player to gain entrance to the National Indoor Championships in three seasons. Current Notre Dame assistant coach Michelle Dasso reached the semifinals of the event in 2000-01.

While it's still early in the season, the Irish are already looking to get back on track. 
The women's swimming and diving team hopes to improve upon its 1-1 mark in dual meets when the Irish host the Panthers at 4:30 p.m. this afternoon. 
"In the past, [Pittsburgh] has always been a strong team," senior diver Meghan Perry­Eaton said. "They're one of our toughest competitors in conference, which means a lot to us." 
The Irish enter the meet after falling to the Hoosiers 176-124 last Thursday. Despite individual victories by Ann Barton (200-yard backstroke). Katie Carroll (100-yard butter­fly). Brooke Taylor (200-yard butterfly) and Perry-Eaton (one-and three-meter diving). 
Notre Dame was unable to top Indiana and earn its second dual meet victory. 
"In general, the team swam well, but we just got touched out," Perry-Eaton said. "There were a lot of events with close finishes, and when "When you have the support of your teammates and you're all working for a common goal, it keeps your adrenaline up and gives you that extra drive you might need." 
Ultimately, the Irish realize t h a t resolve

"Michigan State improved dramatically last year," Irish men's coach Tim Welsh said. ··we expect a very competitive meet. and there will be a lot of close races that we need to win." 
On Oct. 21, the Irish fell to North Carolina 183.5-111.5 in the first of a two-meet fall break road trip to the East Coast. Four swimmers record­ed first place finishes against North Carolina, including Ted Brown (200-yard individual medley),Tim Randolph (100­yard breaststroke), Frank Krakowski (50-yard freestyle) and Tim Kegelman (1 00-yard butterfly). 
Two days later, Notre Dame dropped a second decision against North Carolina State, 139-98. Patrick Heffernan (200-yard butterfly) and Brown (500-yard freestyle) turned in event victories in the loss. 
While the two losses would imply otherwise, according to Welsh, the meets were any­thing but a negative experience

"Our key to success this year will be improvement," Welsh said. If we do the right things, the scoreboard will take care of itself. We're not where we want to be right now, but I'm already seeing signs that it's on the way."

HOCKEY 
Irish travel to face offensive-minded Spartans 
ByJUSTIN SCHUVER 
Associate Sports Editor 
What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? That ques­tion will be answered this week­end as the Irish travel to East Lansing to take on Michigan State in a two-game CCHA road series. 
The Irish (5-2-0, 4-2-0 in the CCHA) play the part of the object, ranking first in the CCHA in team defense with a minis­cule 1.71 goals per game aver­age. By contrast, the Spartans (5-3-0, 4-2-0) lead the CCHA in offense with 4.00 goals per game. 
"Our goaltending has been really good so far, but there's also four seniors who play on defense," Irish coach Dave Poulin said. "It anchors things and makes things much better there. I think it's kind of an interesting fact being that we'd go into this series being the best defensive team and them the best offensive team. 
"I think if you turn the clock back it's usually very different. They're usually the best defen­sive team in the league." 
Both teams come into this weekend's series on a four-game winning streak. The Spartans faced last year's CCHA regular season champion Ferris State in a home-and-home series last weekend. outscoring the Bulldogs 12-2 in the sweep. 
Part of the reason for Notre Dame's early defensive success has been the play of freshman goaltender David Brown. Brown comes into the series holding a shutout streak of 186 minutes, 15 seconds -an Irish record. 
Brown's last shutout occurred this past Friday when Notre Dame defeated Nebraska­Omaha at home by the score of 2-0. 
The freshman was named CCHA Rookie of the Week for his efforts, the second time this year Brown has received the honor. He currently leads the CCHA in overall GM (1.15) and save per­centage (.964). 
Junior Morgan Cey, who was the team's No. 1 goaltender last season, also played well in his first game since returning from offseason surg~ry. Against Nebraska-Omaha last Thursday, Cey stopped 29 of 31 shots in Notre Dame's 4-2 victory. 

Poulin said that he plans to start Cey in the fiTst game of the Michigan -State series and Brown in the second. In his career, Cey has a 1-2-1 record against the Spartans with a . 943 save percentage and a 2.06 goals against average. 
While Brown receives most of the accolades, this year's Irish rookie class has quietly put together an impressive start to the season. 
Among the freshmen class' contributions forward Michael Bartlett has collected three points (two goals and an assist), defenseman Wes O'Neill has two points (a goal and an assist), forwards Matt Williams­Kovacs and Jason Paige each have two assists and left wing Josh Sciba leads the team with a 
68.8 percent faceoff win rate. 
"All the guys I'm very pleased with," Poulin said. "You look at the potential of this class and the depth of this class, and it's great. 
"It's something where every single guy has contributed in some way this year. They're adding a really nice dimension now -some of it's role-oriented and situation-oriented -but they're doing a really nice job." 
The Spartans have their own share of young talent as well, however. Freshman forward Tommy Goebel and junior for­ward Jim Slater lead the team with seven goals each. Slater also sits atop the CCHA leader­board with 15 points. 
"They're a team-based offense," Poulin said. "I think even when you have a young man like Slater putting up a ton of points, I think their offense is still a balanced offense. 

Freshman goaltender Dominic Vicari has done a good job in net so far, filling in occasionally for Matt Migliaccio -the team's No. 1 goaltender a year ago. 
Vicari is seventh in the CCHA with a 2.33 goals against aver­age and has a 2-1-0 record with one shutout. The junior Migliaccio has allowed three goals a game with a 2-1-0 record as well. Migliaccio has a slightly better save percentage,

Irish wrap exhibition season Sunday at home 

By JOE HETTLER Sports Editor 
Notre Dame will play in its final exhibition game of the sea­son when its faces off against Team Concept Sunday at 1 p.m. at the Joyce Center. 
The Irish are 19-1 in exhibition games since the 1993-94 season and won the first of their two preseason games Nov. 3 against Northwest Sports 85-65. 
Sophomores Courtney LaVere and Megan Duffy led Notre Dame, which led by 10 points at halftime. LaVere scored 21 points on 10-for-14 shooting and added seven rebounds, while Duffy had 13 assists and 14 points. The Irish also got 20 points from junior Jacqueline Batteast, and classmate Katy Flecky had 12 points, seven

offense," Big Red captain J.T. Arseniadis said. "The hangover from fall break set in, and we need to get [the offense] back in form." 
Keenan, on the other hand, is coming off a dramatic 10-7 vic­tory over fourth-seeded Knott. Falling behind 7-0 on a second quarter touchdown, the Knights drew even on a Reed Langton touchdown run in the third and advanced to the semifinals on a 25-yard field goal by Andrew Warner with only 28 seconds remaining in the game. 
"We didn't come out in the first half like we wanted to and kind of sleep-walked through it," Downey said. "However, I really liked the character we showed rebounds, six assists and four steals. 
Notre Dame started the game against Northwest sloppy but shot well to close out the half with a 45-35 lead. 
Freshmen Crystal Erwin, Breona Gray and Susie Powers all got their first collegiate action and could see more minutes this weekend against Team Concept. Erwin, who Irish coach Muffet McGraw anticipates getting in foul trouble this sea~on, picked up five fouls in 12 minutes and also added six points. Gray made her only shot, and Powers went 0-fot-3 from the field. 
Notre Dame moved the ball well in its first exhibition game and ran well in the open court. McGraw said doing both those things would be key this year for the Irish. The team also played 
in coming back, which gives us some momentum this week." 
Dillon rallied from an 8-0 deficit to defeat Keenan 14-8 in the regular season's final week. The victory not only preserved the Big Red's flawless record, but also secured Dillon the first seed in the playoffs. 
"We came out flat and Keenan took it to us," Arseniadis said. "We need to play stronger defense, execute on offense, and eliminate the stupid penalties to win again." 
Downey points to the ground game as the key to the Knights' success this year. 
"We're a running team on both sides of the ball," Downey said. "We try to pound teams by just lining up and beating our guys off the ball." 
Similarly, Dillon also boasts an impressive combination of both run defense and offense.

solid defense, especially in the second half when they held Northwest Sports to a mere 29.7 percent shooting. 
Notre Dame opens its season Nov. 14 against defending NIT Champion Auburn before facing the winner of Colorado or Old Dominion in Boulder, Colo. 
The Irish will not have Teresa Borton or Jeneka Joyce for Sunday's contest because both are out with injuries. Borton had offseason heel surgery and is out until early December, while Joyce should begin practice soon and could play in roughly two weeks. She is out with an undis­closed injury. 
Notre Dame's first home game is Nov. 21 against Valparaiso.

..Defensively, we shut down the run pretty well and just grind it out," Arseniadis said. "If you can control the line of scrimmage, you can be successful, and we've done that." 
The winner of Sunday's con­test will challenge either Siegfried or Morrissey in Notre Dame Stadium for the men's interhall football championship. 
Siegfried vs. Morrissey 
Last year, Morrissey fell to Siegfried in the first round of the playoffs. This year, the two teams square off again, but now the stakes are higher and the victor goes to Notre Dame Stadium. 
And if last year's game was any indication, the sequel should be a classic. 
Siegfried coach John Torgensen feels the same way. 
"I think these are the two best teams in the league," he said. "I know Dillon is undefeated and the No. 1 seed, but they didn't have to play Morr!ssey." 
A renowned passing offense is part of what puts Siegfried in the

upper echelon of interhall teams. Though stifled for most of last week's game against Alumni, Siegfried's explosive aerial attack showed up when needed most. Quarterback Bill Bingle authored a late fourth quarter touchdown drive, spreading the ball around the field to his favorite target John Kaup, new addition Marques 
Bolden, and finally hitting tight end Mike Wahl for the game­winning touchdown. 
Torgensen attributed the 10-6 win to the Bingle's poise. 
"Having been to the stadium twice, Bill Bingle has seen it all," he said. "We all feel confident with him running the show." 
But what the Morrissey defense faces through the air, the Ramblers defense will face on the ground. The Manorites feature a consistent and punish­ing ground assault led by the tandem of tailback Nick Klein and quarterback Marty Mooney. 
Last week, Zahm had little · success in stopping the Morrissey duo. Klein amassed 75 total rushing yards while

Mooney chipped in with a 60­
yard scramble of his own. Both 
players rushed for a touchdown. 
As for facing the Rambler 
defense, Klein plans on taking 
what the defense gives them. 
"We're planning to mix it up on 
offense and see what works well 
that day," he said. 
However, touchdowns will be at a premium for both sides. Though their offenses run opposing schemes, both defenses put up similar stingy numbers week in and week out. The Rambler defense has recorded two shutouts and is holding opponents to 4.6 points per game. Rambler cornerback John Lira feels that the Siegfried defense has a distinct advantage in its practices. 
"Playing against the top offense in practice makes [the defense] better as a whole," Lira said. "As good as their offense is, I can't say that it's as good as ours." 
However, Morrissey's defense has also been up to the task, beginning the year with three straight shutouts and allowing only 3.8 points per game. 
But on Sunday, the focus for both teams is on the present, specifically on a trip to the stadi­um. 
"That's the goal of the entire endeavor -to make it to the stadium," Klein said. "That's obviously one of our major drives of the season." 
Siegfried will be seeking its third consecutive stadium appearance, and Lira remains confident in his team. 
"The road to the championship still goes through Siegfried. As far as we're concerned, we're still driving the bus," Lira said.

the year and took the Irish to overtime at Alumni Field last month. 
Boston College advanced by beating Rutgers 2-1 in the quar­terfinals and is led by sopho­more Katie McGregor and sen­ior Sarah Rahko. The Eagles started the season 8-0 and have currently hit their stride, win­ning five consecutive games. 
"We've played them before, although not this season," Waldrum said. "They're pretty similar though personnel-wise. They are good defensively and don't give up many goals. They're a team that will give you a difficult game and is capable of beating you." 
While the Irish and Eagles have not played this season, they are familiar with each other. The Irish defeated Boston College 3-0 in that semifinal two years ago, and then beat the Eagles 1-0 last year on a golden goal from Amanda Guertin in overtime. Guertin, Amy Warner and Melissa Tancredi all scored in the 3-0 win two seasons ago. 

This time around, however, the Irish will have to go without Warner, who suffered a severely sprained ankle in the game against Miami and is listed as week-to-week. Junior Mary Boland also remains question­able for this weekend's game, which means the Irish could be without their two leading scor­ers. 
The Irish did get a boost against Miami from the return of defender Tancredi, who is still slowed somewhat by an ankle injury. 
The Irish depth up front will come into play, as sophomore Maggie Manning and freshman Lizzie Reed are very capable of stepping in alongside Guertin and sophomore Katie Thorlakson as the Irish for­wards. 
"I .don't think we'll change things too muGh," Waldrum said. "Amy and Mary give us the opportunity to press more, so we won't do that quite as often, but we'll have the same mindset. Lizzie and Maggie can give us some of the same press­ing mindset, but we lose a little without Amy's pace and athleti­cism."

off a big win over second place Pittsburgh last week, and they know that Virginia Tech is a more than wor­thy opponent. 
"I think it will be really easy [not to look past Friday] because we lost to Virginia Tech last year," Irish coach Debbie Brown said. "It's not about revenge, it's just about playing the way we know how to play, and I know [the team] won't look past them." 

This weekend is the last homestand for the Irish until the Big East Tournament, and they look to make the most of playing good teams at home. 
"[Virginia Tech] is playing well, and 
. \ that is good for us," Brown said. "We want to play a team that is on fire and playing well." The Irish have been playing well of late as well, winning their last 12 

matches. They are the No. 1 blocking squad in the country, averaging 3.84 blocks per game -nearly a half block more than their closest competition. 
Sophomore middle blocker Lauren Brewster is a large part of that statistic, as she leads the nation in individual blocking with 1.82 blocks per game. Brewster also leads the Irish in hitting percentage, as she hits .359. 
Sophomore middle blocker Lauren Kelbley is second on the team in block­ing (1.33 per game), and is another large part of the balanced Irish attack. Junior Emily Loomis leads the Irish hit­ters with 3.67 kills per game. 
Running the offense is senior setter Kristen Kinder. Kinder has been steady for the Irish ever since they switched to a 5-1 offense from the 6-2 they started the season with. 
However, Sunday's match will prove to be a challenge for Notre Dame. Miami is led by last year's Big East Player of the Year, Valeria Tipiana, who averages 4.03 kills and 2.48 digs while hitting .324 this season. Last year, the Hurricanes ended a 43-game Big East winning streak for the Irish and made it to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen in only the program's second year. The Hurricanes are two games behind the Irish in the Big East standings. 
"We're definitely ready to play good teams," Herndon said. "That is always a more fun game." 
The Irish find themselves prepared for what they deem just another week­end of conference play. 
"It's a big weekend just because we have two conference games, and our goal is to win our conference," Herndon said. "We're very excited, very pumped-up and we're ready to have a good match all the way through.." 
Today's game is set to start at 4 p.m. and Sunday's game is scheduled for 6 p.m., at the Joyce Center.

The Huskies (8-7-3, 5-3-2) don't figure to be a pushover opponent, however. Connecticut is this year's host for the Big East semifinals and finals, and the Huskies would love to .upset the Irish and return home for the remainder of the tournament. 
Connecticut is led by freshman forward Steve Sealy, who has scored five goals and three assists for 13 points, including three game-winners. Together with forward Cesar Cuellar, who has notched four goals and three assists for 11 points, they com­pose the bulk of the Huskies' attack.

No. 3 Irish hungry for their eighth Big East Tournament Championship this weekend 
By ANDY TROEGER Sports Writer 

PISCATAWAY, N.J. -Two years ago, the Irish won their seventh consecutive Big East Championship in Piscataway, N.J., by defeat­ing Boston College in the semifinals and then West Virginia in the championship game. 
Joined by Villanova, those same teams return to Piscataway this weekend as the Irish again match up with the Eagles in Big East semifinal action Friday, while West Virginia will take on Villanova in the other bracket. 
The Irish would love nothing better than to regain the championship, whether or not they follow the same form as in 2001. By not even qualifying for the Big East Tournament in 2002, the Irish are hungry to regain the championship in a tournament in which they have never lost. 
"I think that was one of the goals all along this season," said Irish coach Randy Waldrum of regaining the Big East­Championship. "Not even making it last year after winning so much, we've wanted this since the beginning of the season." 
The Irish, ranked No. 3 by the NSCAA and No. 4 by Soccer America this week after falling to Michigan in their regular season finale, hardly have an easy task awaiting them if they want to win their eighth Big East title. Boston College (No. 22 NSCANNo. 18 SA) comes in at 14-2-2 and as the second seed from the Northeast Division. 
In the other game, West Virginia (No. 10 NSCAA/No. 7 SA) comes in having been ranked in the top 10 most of the year and having amassed a record of 15-3-1. 
Villanova, fresh off an upset of Northeast Division Champion Connecticut, is 14-5-1 on 
Tourney time

It is the biggest weekend of the season thus far, but the Irish are confident. 
This afternoon, the No. 12 Irish (19-2, 8-0) face Virginia Tech ( 12-12, 6-3), when they try to avenge last season's loss. Sunday night will see Miami (19-7, 7~2) come into town hungry for a victory after the Irish knocked them out of the Big East Tournament last year.

game, because we are try­ing to focus on VIrginia Tech as of right now," freshman defensive specialist Danielle Herndon said. "Of course it's a big game, because it's a conference game, and we want to win all of them." 
The Hokies will hope to upset the Irish as they did last year. However, Sunday's game is the American Volleyball Coaches' Association game of the week, and will be televised nationally on CSTV's Sunday Night Spikers.

Irish hope strong finish in Big East Tournament will propel them into a top NCAA seed 
ByJUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
Losing was an uncommon thing for this year's Irish, but this weekend they'll have a chance to get back at one of the few teams that beat them during the regular season. 
No. 3 seed Notre Dame faces No. 6 seed Connecticut in a quarterfinal Big East Tournament matchup Sunday at Alumni Field. During the regular season, the Huskies defeat­ed the Irish 1-0 in Storrs, Conn. 
"I think that you always just want to get out there and win," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. ''I'm not sure I'd put it as strongly as saying that we want revenge, although it would be nice to get one of those lof?ses back. 
"We'd just like to go out there and win the conference. That would really help make this a very special year." 
Notre Dame comes into the Big East Tournament with a 12-3-3 record, including 6­3-1 in conference. The Irish are currently ranked No. 5 nationally and are in the running for a high seeding in the NCAA Tournament if they perform well at the Big East Championship. 
Clark said that he doesn't want his team to think about at-large bids and instead work towards receiving the automatic bid that would be included in winning the Big East Tournament. 
Each of the top four seeds nationally receive home-field advantage all the way up to the NCAA Final Four, and Clark added that is a bit of incentive for the team to do well in the Big East Tournament. 
"We're playing for home field advantage," he said. "I think that's especially important at a school where academics is so important. Finals will be around the same time as the Final Four,

"This game will be won in the trenches," Keenan captain and quarterback Patrick Downey said, alluding to the run-based oiTense featured by both squads. "We played them earlier this year and both teams know what the other is about." 
Dillon enters the semifinal contest hoping to build on the strength of a 7-0 shutout of eighth-seeded Sorin last Sunday. After a penalty negat­ed an early Big Red touch­down, both teams were held scoreless until Dillon quarter­back A.J.

game hype
Last four games vital for Willingham 

Tyrone Willingham won't be judged by what Notre Dame has accomplished during the first eight games of the 2003 season. 
It is instead the man­ner in which he leads his team through its final four games of the year that will leave a lasting impact on Irish fans. 
Despite what Willingham accomplished last season ­taking a 5-7 team and turning it into one that started the season 8-0 -the odds were certainly against him in 2003. He faced a schedule that would make any program in the nation weak in the knees. Recruiting gaps left him woe­fully thin at key positions. The offense didn't seem quite ready to generate touchdowns by the bunches. 
Those factors gave Willingham every opportunity to blame a 2-6 start, the worst in 40 years, on a series of enormous challenges. 
But he didn't. 
"Excuses aren't solutions," the Irish head coach said ear­lier in the week.

That's why Willingham's personal string of Judgement Days starts against Navy. He may say that Notre Dame is heading in the right direction, but blowout losses to top-1 0 competition aren't what fans define as returning to the nation's elite. 
In order to show that Willingham does indeed have Notre Dame "pointed in the right direction," as he said last week, the success of Notre Dame over its last four games of the season -when Notre Dame has nothing to play for but a good start for next year -will show how much of an effect Willingham can have on Notre Dame's future success. 
Because if hell freezes over and Navy beats Notre Dame for the first time since the Hugh DeVore era, all bets will be off.

the next 19. Navy won five of the next eight games between 1956 and 1963 before losing the last 39 games against the Irish. 
But the last few meetings between the teams have been especially interesting. Besides the 2002 game, Navy nearly 
· upset Notre Dame in 1997 and again in 1999. 
In the '97 game, the Midshipmen out gained the Irish 399 to 283 and had 117 more rushing yards, but still lost 21-1 7 when Autry Denson scored with 5 minutes, 48 sec­onds remaining in the game. Navy quarterback Chris McCoy threw three interceptions that day in South Bend but complet­ed a Hail Mary on the last play of the game to receiver Pat McGrew, who raced to the Irish 2-yard line before being knocked out of bounds by Allen Russum. 
But the loss that hurts Navy fans the most was in 1999. 
Notre Dame trailed 24-21 with 1:30 remaining and had the ball at the Midshipmen 37. On fourth-and-1 0, with no timeouts left, Notre Dame quar­terback Jarious Jackson hit receiver Bobby Brown for a 9­yard gain. The Navy sideline celebrated what they thought was a victory, only to see the ..referee give Notre Dame a very generous spot. The Irish got the first down by a few inches, then scored six plays later to win 28­24.

NAVY DEFENSE 

IRISH RUSHING 

The Irish have not demonstrated an over­powering rushing attack since their 20-14 win against Pittsburgh when they racked up 352 yards on the ground. Jones has carried the brunt of the load with 649 yards and all four Irish rushing touchdowns. ­
The Midshipmen have displayed some weak­nesses in stopping the run this seaso.n. They rank 78th in the nation in run defense, yielding 170 yards a game and four yards per carry. They have also allowed 16 rushing touchdowns on the season. · 
The Irish should be able 
to control the line of 
scrimmage against the 
under-sized Midshipmen. 
In some years, the Irish 
blow Navy defenders otT 
the line of scrimmage, but 
in others they struggleto 
gain any ground. If the Irish play to their ability, . they should have success. 
IRISH PASSING 
If the Irish can move the ball on the ground first, Quinn may have a break out game using the play action. His receivers have not helped him too much this year with dropped passes. The offensive line protection has improved for the Irish this year. 
Navy has been successful against this pass this sea­son. They rank fourth in the nation with 151 yards per game. The Midshipmen have allowed five passing touchdowns and have 12 interceptions on the season. Carthan leads the team with four interceptions. 
Navy's impressive num­bers against the pass may be deceiving as it does not play some of

Navy is better than usual this year and Notre Dame is much worse. The Irish will be looking to beat up on someone, while the Midshipmen want to make history on the 40th anniversary of the last time a Navy team defeated Notre Dame_ The Academy will hang tough, but Notre Dame should pull away late.

NavyMidshipmen Record: 6-3 
AP: NR 
Coaches: NR 

Notre Dame has been impressive against the run this year and has played some of the nation's better runners in guys like Michigan's Chris Perry and Boston College's Derrick Knight. The Irish rank 32nd in rush defense with 121 yards allowed per game.  The only truly established player in the Irish sec­ondary at this time is Duff. Bolen should fill in for the injured Earl, and Ellick, Beckstrom and Jackson should see plenty of playing time at-the other corner position. The Irish have allowed 227 passing yards a game.  The Irish punting game has struggled since Setta's injury. Notre Dame has allowed sever­al big returns on kickoffs and punts this season, partially due to poor kick placement. Duff has had some solid returns on punts.  While there is not much left to play for this year, the Irish can maintain and extend its current 39-year winning streak over Navy. The game is at home, but that not may prove such an advantage as Irish crowds seem a little subdued of late.  
The Midshipmen have the nation's top rushing attack. They have 27 touchdowns on the ground this season, which is nearly seven times the Irish total. Candeto and Eckel both average over 85 yards a game on the ground.  Navy is not a team that is going to beat you with the pass, and they don't dis­guise that fact. What they will due is use the run to set up a play action pass­ing situation. Candeto has completed just under 50 percent of his passes with four interceptions and six touchdowns.  Rolfs is 5-for-6 on field goal attempts this year. The Midshipmen aver­age nearly eight yards a per punt return with no touchdowns. Hampton gets nearly 22 yards per kickoff return. Navy has no touchdown returns so far this year.  If there is any year for Navy to break its losing streak to the Irish, it's now. Notre Dame is cer­tainly down after a 2-6 start, and the Midshipmen could land the knockout punch. Navy always seems to play better in Notre Dame Stadium.  
The Midshipmen run the triple option, and they run it very well. With only a we.~k J.q.,prepare for tQ!sdif(er~(·~y~ of play, ·and rfv)tFi' ~ereral younJLP.laycr~ st¥ting on ~~emfe--"' dlie to injuries, the Irish could have a big challenge on their hands.
