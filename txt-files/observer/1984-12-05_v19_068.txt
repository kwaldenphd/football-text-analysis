In Brief 
The poison gas leak from a pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, has killed 1,000 people, doctors say, and many of the survivors in this central Indian city are threatened by blindness and sterility. The doctors said many of the dead were children and the elderly, who were not strong enough to withstand · or outrun · the lethal cloud that spread over 25 square miles of this city of900,000 on Monday. The methyl isocyanate gas had begun leaking at 1 a.m. from an underground storage tank at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in a poor area ofBhopal. The leak was stopped after 40 minutes, but the gas seeped silently over the city through the early hours of the morning. -AP

Change comes slowly to ND, peer pressures remain today 
There are mornings when I wake up with my mouth tasting like the inside of a decomposing gerbil. Sometimes I hack and wheeze until I think I am having a heart attack at the age of 20. My hands smell yellow. 
I smoke cigarettes. 

Smoking is not common among undergraduates at Notre Dame. For whatever the reason, students who smoke are set apart from the norm, especially men who smoke. It's not that smokers are rejected, exactly. They just aren't quite like everyone else. 
This is a departure from the past. College has always been a time for sowing a few wild oats ·· whether it be smoking, drinking or· some other questionable pastime. The typical undergrad, as seen in old volumes of the Dome, is a disheveled, uninhibited individual. And they almost invariably have a cigarette hanging from their lower lip. 
At other schools this is often still the case. People who don't smoke are usually the ones who feel left out. I

timidated by the all-male precedent ofthe place. 
High school was always the place where students 

sneaked a cigarette in the bathroom and flushed the 
butts down the toilet. People smoked then for different 
reasons: to be cool, to be accepted, to do the French 
inhale and blow smoke rings. 
College was supposed to be the place where 

roommates laid in bed smoking late into the night 
talking about the big questions. But most students at 
Notre Dame seem to be content with calling it a night

presence. At Notre Dame the average student dresses better, is more well· groomed, and is more polite. There seems to be an atti· tude that says, "Since we are at Notre Dame, we better look and act like it." 
Generally, men try to impress the women with their niceness and women try to reflect this expression with their femininity. It really is a vicious circle. 
The stiffness between the interaction of the sexes is preventing students here from letting their hair down. This is not to say that everybody should immediately run out to the 7-Eleven and throw down a buck for a pack of Marlboros. 
You shouldn't b.cause smoking is bad for you. 

The lack ofsmokers at Notre Dame is just a symptom of a disease that is plaguing the vitality of the Univer­sity's social life. 
This could be, as one theory states, because many students come to Notre Dame from private, Catholic, single-gender high schools and the change is somewhat drastic. Or it could be because men think the women of Notre Dame are smarter and the women feel a little in-

student. They are something

subculture. 
While subcultures them­

selves aren't necessarily a bad thing, the things that people consider qualifications for membership into the Notre Dame subculture would hardly be considered "radical" anywhere else. It is hard to believe that someone at Stanford or the University of Chicago would be considered part of a seperate group because he or she smoked or wore patched Levis to class. 
Notre' Dame still is adjusting to coeducation. Change comes slowly to this Catholic university. And unfortun­ately, smokers and others who choose not to submit to the social parameters here will have to suffer disapprov­ing glances for awhile. 
Condoning cigarette smoking is not one of my goals. People should be able to decide for themselves if they want to smoke or not. But they should be able to decide without the peer pressures that exist at Notre Dame.

Bishop says 
U.S. policy is 'un-Christian' 
Assoclated Press 
WASHINGTON · Black Anglican Bishop Bishop Desmond Tutu called President Reagan's South African policy "immoral, evil and totally un­Christian" yesterday and offered to meet with the president before flying to Europe to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, 
Reagan's chief spokesman said no meeting was planned. 
Tutu brought members of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa to their feet, in a standing ovation highly unusual for a con­gressional hearing, after saying the administration's policy of quiet diplomacy toward the white 

~ minority-ruled nation "is giving 
r democracy a bad name." 
"We are talking about a moral

r 
issue," the bishop-designate of johannesburg said, declaring that South Africa's apartheid policy of ra­cial segregation "is evil, is immoral, is un-Christian, without remainder," "In my view, the Reagan adminis­tration's support and collaboration with it is equally immoral, evil and totally un-Christian," Tutu said. "You are either for or against apar­theid, and not by rhetoric," he added. "You are either in favor of evil, or you are in fuvor ofgood. You are either on the side of the op­pressed or on the side ofthe oppres­sor. You can't be neutral." 
Nineteen people, including seven House members, have been arrested during a 2-week-old series of demonstrations outside the South African embassy here. The protest spread to New York on Monday, where four arrests were made at the nation's consulate, and organizers said it will extend to other U.S. cities where the Pretoria government has diplomatic offices. 
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said, "There are no plans to meet," He said Reagan had sent Tutu a "'w~m congratulatory message" ,..-ku the bishop was announced the wmmeroft.I-Je Nobel Peace Prize ear­Rim dlis year.

Herbert Blaize elected new leader of Grenada 
Associated Press 
St. George's, Grenada -Herbert Blaize became Grenada's new prime minister yesterday with an over­whelming victory in elections that returned democracy to this Carib­bean nation nearly six years after a leftist coup. 
Unofficial results from Monday's balloting gave Blaize's U.S.-backed New National Party 14 of Parlia­ment's 15 seats, and the opponent who won the 15th said he would resign because of election "discrepancies." 
The United States led an invasion ofthe island after the Marxist regime collapsed in a bloody power struggle last year, with Prime Mini­ster Maurice Bishop among those slain. 
Blaize took his oath of office at Government House from Governor­General Sir Paul Scoon, who had ap­pointed an interim council to run the island after the invasion. 
The 66-year-old attorney also said he had sent a letter to President Reagan asking that U.S. "security forces" on Grenada remain "until such time as we have a fully equipped and trained Grenada police force." 
There are about 600 U.S. and Caribbean troopers still on the is­land. 
Marcel Peters of the United Labor Party was the only opponent of the New National Party to win a par­liamentary seat, and he said he would resign because of "discrepencies in the election process." 
Blaize said ofPeters, "Ifhe resigns, he resigns because he feels too damn lonely." 
Blaize led the government once before, in 1962-67, when the island was a British colony.

have to accept the fact that we

Vuono ha-; a four-year scholarship through ROTC. Although according to Vuono, "one can devote as little or as much time as you want to," he admits, "I put In a lot oftime ... more than most." Besides class and a two-hour lab each week, he par· tiel pates In various activities with the Irish Rangers. a division ofelite cadets. 
"I like doing It," said Vuono. "It is a release and is enjoyable." He spends approximately six hours a week in ROTC. In November he participated in an overnight mill· tary tactics outing, after which Vuono said he slt:pt and then got up to study.

If he ever decided to switch majors, Vuono says he would go towards Arts and Letters, in com­puters, government, or economics. The only major obstacle in his way would be the possibility of his ROTC scholarship being ter· minated, as it is "earmarked as engineering." 
Still, Vuono believes the engi­neering program is worth the prob­lems it presents to a point, because it is "a good field to go into."

"I'm getting pounded with learn­ing foundations. I don't feel that by the end of this year I will have the basis to make a decision (as to the choice ofengineering field)," Vuono says. 
There are people who could excel in speciaiized fields of engi­neering, but who are getting "weeded out" in the basic courses, according to Vuono. "They are good at trying to weed out people, but at the same time they might be weeding out the wrong people."

The Yankees and the Cubs completed a six­
player trade, and the Cleveland Indians re-signed free-agent Andre Thornton as baseball's 1984 winter convention began to heat up Tuesday. The Yankees and Cubs deal was the first of the meetings and sent left-handed pitcher Ray Fontenot and infielder-outfielder Brian Dayeu to Chicago for four players. Then, the Indians called a news conference to announce that they had re-signed their own free agent, Thornton, to a four-year contract. In return for Fontenot and Dayett, the Cubs sent veteran catcher Ron Hassey, 23-year-old out­fielder Henry Cotto and pitchers Rich Bordi and Porfi Altamirano to the Yankees, where they will be assigned to the club's Class AAA Columbus roster. -AP

late, it would seem that rebounding might be a weakness against defensive-minded Indiana. However, Phelps emphasized to his players the importance of the big men blocking out and the possibility of Notre Dame's guards picking up the rebounds. 
"Coach Phelps wanted me to go to the boards a lot," Hicks explained. "He feels that I have quickness to get to the open areas of the floor, and with Indiana's guards being not very good rebounders, we tried to tie up their big men underneath to allow our guards to get the loose balls." 
Hicks, also saddled with the responsibilty of guarding Steve Al­ford, finished with five boards, with four comingin the first half. Price ac­counted for three rebounds, all in the first half. 
"We carried through with the game plan," Phelps stated. "We dominated the boards, sagged on defense and executed our points. Going into the game, we were con­cerned with their big men." 
Jim Dolan added seven more boards, but his role in the Notre Dame scheme was more of a people mover to shut down the inside game ofthe Hoosiers than one designed to actually get the rebounds. 
"Dolan pushed people around un­derneath," Royal continued, "and Scott and I just looked for the openings. We were a lot more ag­gressive than Indiana, which also allowed us to get some offensive rebounds. When we are coming down the floor on the transition, I'm 
Indiana coach Bob Knight noted the intense play of Notre Dame. "Notre Dame players go after things," said a very calm Knight during his post-game comments. "They are a tough team to play, and they got the better of us in aggres­siveness tonight." 
The press also contributed to the Notre Dame running game. Phelps went to a trap press with Indiana in the lead, 22-16, after starting with only contain pressure. That strategy resulted in six points by Rivers, all following Hoosier mistakes which led to running situations for the Irish. 
"When we went to the trap press, it gave us the intensity that Indiana didn't have," Phelps pointed out. "Our big men did a job on theirs, epecially Gary Voce on (Uwe) Blab. Royal also played very well, and he has been playing to his quickness, which creates things for us defensively." 
Although Royal scored only six points, five of them came as a result of his offensive rebounding. Just over three minutes into the game, the 6-8 sophomore followed a Ken Barlow miss to put the Irish ahead 6-4. With ten minutes left in the game, after Indiana had pulled within nine points at 58-49, Royal grabbed a missed free throw by Dave Rivers, and converted a three­point play on his second follow of the shot. 
Price added his two offensive rebounds in the last two minutes of the first half, converting on a wide­open layup off of a Hicks miss, and retaining possession of the ball for the Irish after Voce missed a one­and-one opportunity. 

In the Indiana game, the Irish only picked up where they left off against Northwestern -playing an ag­gressive, pressure defense and con­trolling the boards to get their transition game going. 
Phelps claims that the Irish are "ready to go" and has no plans to change the thus-far successful Notre Dame game plan of pressing, rebounding and utilizing the transi­tion game against DePaul on Satur· day.

Jim Dolan, playing in his first game this season after missing the first three due to a preseason shoulder injury suffered against the Zadar Club of Yugoslavia, pulled down seven rebounds himself. 
"It didn't bother me too much," said Dolan of the shoulder after the game. "We'll just have to wait until tomorrow to see how it feels." 
CenterTim Kempton, meanwhile, sat out the game with the sprained ankle he suffered last week against Northwestern. Kempton had the okay of team doctors to play, but Phelps' plan was to get by without him if possible so as to further rest the injury for the DePaul game. 
"We're excited about the win," added Dolan. "It gives us a lot ofcon­fidence because we know now that we can win with injuries." 
The question becomes, then, what Notre Dame can do at full strength.

preached and preached. Practiced and practiced and practiced. Keep the ball out of Steve Alford's hands and you can beat Indiana, they were told. 
Following orders, Notre Dame did just that -kept the ball out of the talented Alford's hands for much of the night-and knocked off the II th­ranked Hoosiers last night at the ACC. The Irish go to 4-0 as they point toward a key battle with second-ranked DePaul Saturday at the Rosemont Horizon. The Hoosiers, meanwhile, drop to 1-2 and face the prospect ofgoing home to play Kentucky. 
From the outset, it was the abilityJ of Notre Dame to deny Alford the Ibe Observer/Pete Lacbcs ball time and time again that kept the

Probably most evident in Notre Dame's impressive victory last night over Indiana was its continued suc­cess using the transition game. But perhaps even more important than that was the aggressive play of the Irish on the boards and the scrappy defense which started many of the fast breaks.

More importantly for the Irish, Alford set up only two Hoosier scores. 
"We really played hard-nosed defense on him," said Irish guard Scott Hicks, assigned the difficult task of stopping Alford for most of the game. "We played a sagging defense designed to deny Alford the ball. I'd get help from other players if he curled or whatever. It was kind of a zone defense." 
"We were fortunate to get away with what we did tonight," Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps· ad­mitted. "We helped out a lot and conceaed some outside shots at the beginning. Hicks just did a fantastic job on Alford." 
"Hicks was the key on defense," said a mild-mannered Indiana coach· Bob Knight afterward. "If I were rating him on a scale of one to ten, I would say that Sco~t Hicks was over five as one of the reasons that Steve Alford didn't score a lot. 
"Notre Dame was well set-up defensively. From my standpoint, Notre Dame is the kind of team I would like to play a lot because it always plays enthusiastically. (The Irish) were tough as always tonight." 
Indiana jumped out to 22-16lead in the game's first 12 minutes on the strength of I2 points from senior forward Mike Glomi. Glomi was 9­for-10 from the field on the night, and was IU's leading scorer with 18 points before fouling out. 
At that point, Indiana had its big­gest lead. of the game. But Notre Dame responded by scoring 29 points to the Hoosiers' eight, includ­ing one 18-2 spurt, over the halfs final eight minutes. The Irish never looked back from their 45-30 halftime advantage. 
"One of the keys in the game was that 18-2 stretch," said Knight. "We got very careless in what we were doing. Now all of a sudden we're lQ down. We played well in the first 12 minutes before we hit that spell." 
After m~ng only two of his first nine shots, Ken Barlow, who finished the game with I 5 points, came back to make four consecutive jumpers in the second half, scoring eight ofNotre Dame's first I3 points in that period. Despite that, Indiana pulled back to within nine at 58-49. 
Notre Dame did not fold like it could have, though. Donald Royal grabbed the rebound of a missed free throw by David Rivers. He put up a shot that missed, but then fol­lowed it up and was fouled by IU's Brian Sloan. Royal converted the three-point play and the Irish were back up by I2, 62-49. 
Indiana was able to knock the margin down to nine again at 66-57 with 3:37 remaining, but Notre Dame matched Indiana's points the rest ofthe way, finally stretching the lead out to II at game's end. 
"In the second half, IU had its spurt but we didn't lose our com­posure," said Phelps. "The kids hung in there even though we made some mistakes. Barlow came on and (Dan) Duff helped us tremendously off the bench. 
"We hit our foul shots under pres­sure and we played the boards ag­gressively under pressure. That was the key." 
Rivers led all scorers with 23 points, including 9-for-II from the line. His free-throw shooting down the stretch iced the game for the Irish, as the Hoosiers elected to foul the freshman often. 
Royal pulled down a game-high 12 rebounds as Notre Dame dominated the boards, outrebound­ing Indiana, 39-28.
