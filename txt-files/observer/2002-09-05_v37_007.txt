Student Senate promotes The Shirt 
ByJASON McFARLEY 
News Writer 
Sport your football shirts, Notre Dame fans, but leave your ties at home. 
The coordinator of The Shirt Project told Student Senate Wednesday that students should support the annual project this year over rival football gimmicks, including wearing ties to Notre Dame Stadium in honor of new head coach Tyrone Willingham. 
Courtney Schuster asked Senate to help promote sales of "The Shirt," the T-shirt that students and other fans typically wear to Notre Dame home football games. 
"'Ties for Ty' is a cute idea, but we need to be unified as a stu­dent body," said Schuster, who wrote a Letter to the Editor that appears in today's Observer. "If we get distracted wearing the ties, that hurts the project, and I don't think any student wants to hurt the project." 
Each year, half the proceeds from sales of The Shirt goes to Student Activities for money for campus clubs. The other half is set aside for students who experience unexpected financial trou­ble. 
Shirt officials this year have stepped up promotional efforts, fol­
lowing last fall's lagging sales. In 2001, a losing football season 
and creation of competing shirts shrank sales of The Shirt -and

Tailgaters face policy changes 
. NDSP plans to patrol Saturday 
By LIZ KAHLING and 
JESSICA DALSING 
News Writers 
As the first Notre Dame home football game approaches, stu­dents and sports fans will race to local grocers stocked with hotdogs, burgers and beer in preparation for the many Saturday tailgaters to grace Notre Dame's parking lots. 
But the parking lots may not be as full as they have been in the past. 
With the new tailgating poli­cies aimed at cracking down on underage and abusive drinking, many students are trying to avoid run-ins with the law by heading off campus for pre­kickoff entertainment. 
'TU be at a senior friend's house," freshman Martin Lam said. "I think it's safe there." 
The University has estab­lished a designated student tail­gating area, Blue Field South, between Indiana 23 and Edison Road, separating students from families, alumni and other foot­ball fans. But many seniors, such as Chris Moulton, are tak­ing all the precautions they can for their tailgatcrs. 
"The majority of my friends are of-age so the policy will have little effect, but we do have some friends who are under 21. Those friends will not be allowed to drink at my tailgate," said Moulton. 
In Moulton's e-mail invitation to the tailgater, he adds the link to the University's policy on tailgating (www.nd.edu/-tail­gate) and makes his friends aware of his liability for their actions. 
Notre Dame Security/Police also will hold hosts responsible for any disorderly actions of their guests, said assistant director Phillip Johnson. 
NDSP officers and other local law enforcement will patrol the tailgate area, he said. 
The aim of these officers is to "ensure that our fans and visi­tors have a thoroughly enjoy­able experience free from dis­orderly and abusive behavior and its consequences," Johnson said, adding that any party found in violation of the tailgat­ing policy or state law will be shut down. 
Though the University offi­cials have advertised the new rules online and in The Observer, including an ad in Wednesday's paper from the Student Activities Office, stu­dents remain confused by the new process, which involves registering through Student Activities for a hangtag. 
Moulton said he and his friends wonder what factors will go into approving students' applications. 
''I'm requesting that several of my friends apply, as applica­tions can be denied on certain unknown criteria," Moulton said. 
One concern for Moulton is if this criteria includes considera­tion of applicants' history with

College sees security shift 
By SARAH NESTOR 
Saint Mary's News Editor 
Saint Mary's Security has been 
revitalized this year with new 
programming and greater stu­
dent interaction. 
The new programs have been 
implemented through the efforts 
of Dan Woods, interim security 
director; Belinda Rathert, securi­
ty investigator; and Linda Timm, 
vice president for student affairs. 
The security changes come 
after a year in which the College 
was investigated by the 
Department of Education 
because of alleged violations of 
the Jeanne Clery Act. The act 
mandates that institutions report 
crimes, including sexual 
assaults, in seven major cate­
gories and four sub-categories. 
The Department of Education 
found that Saint Mary's had not 
properly reported their statistics 
-but had not hidden any 
crimes -because of technical 
errors. 
Longtime security director 
Richard Chelbek also retired in the spring, and replacing him for a short time was Michael · Carrington. Timm said that Carrington left after such a short time because it was "not a good 
fit." 
Over the summer the depart­
ment became a division of 
Student Affairs to encourage stu­
dent interaction with campus 
security and gear programming 
toward the students. 
"We love being a division of 
Student Affairs," Rathert said. 
"There has already been more 
student interaction and interest 
this year." 
Plans for the new program­
ming began in May when Woods 
took over the department. This 
summer security officials met 
with local law enforcement offi­cers to learn how Saint Mary's could better work with the com­munity. From these discussions, Saint Mary's Security worked on ways to better serve the College and the local community. 

"We have new uniforms that are more relaxed and have been using the golf carts more so that students will see us as being more approachable," Rathert said. "Also, I will now be on call 24 hours a day so that if a crime occurs, all a student needs to do is tell their resident adviser or front desk and I will be paged." 
Five hundred students came to a Campus Security-sponsored forum to learn about the depart­ment's new Web site, the Belle alert system, and programs. The link will be available through the Saint Mary's home page and will also feature a red bell icon that will appear to be ringing when a campus crime occurs. If the red bell is ringing, students can click on it so that a bulletin will appear detailing the crime. 

"Positive steps have been taken in the interaction between security and students," Timm said. "We want to heighten awareness because I think you're always conscious of the fact that young folks have a feel­ing that it's never going to hap­pen to me."

More than enterta1n1ng 
If you are like the 100 million viewers who called in to select the winner of American Idol, you are probably mourning a loss like I am. The show pays homage to our gener­ation. We like MTV and we love pop music and we don't want to see it go away. 
Of course, there are exceptions to this rule. but just look at most Notre Dame stu­dents' MP3 files. Sure, there are the recent Billboard hits downloaded from Kazaa with DJ Clue giving shout-outs in the background. But many of us have an "old school" folder and we know for every Jimmy Eat World song, there's a Janet Jackson classic and for every Britney Spears tune, there's a Beatles hit. 
The accessibility of MP3s over the years has rounded out my music playlist with an eclectic mix of songs, and as I watched American Idol, I couldn't help but get nostalgic as the young adults belted out melodies that represented the fusion of generations, music and a dream. 1 enjoyed watching the contestants sing and dance around the stage transforming Burt Bachrach tunes with youthful flavor or making an Aretha Franklin or James Taylor song seem like it was made for them. 
American Idol gave us a breath of fresh air from the typical pop star reality show. We could sway to the beats of music of all generations hoping for the discovery of the next superstar to happen before us. 
But now, American Idol is gone ... Sure, there are larger problems in the world, but there was something nostalgic, whoiesome even, about the talent show. I doubt a sequel could match the first. Now, any future people who audition would know the heightened exposure of being an American Idol. After all, as entertaining as it is, how "real" is

There will probably never be another Kelly Clarkson or Justin Guarini. This is good because it opens the door for newcomers, but at the same time, it comes with the risk of producing imitators.

In 1966, Holy Cross College opened with a handful of students and a mission. The mission was to provide a personal, caring, educational environment that would prepare students to transfer successfully to the four-year institution of their choice. 
Holy Cross College now has over 500 students, a residence life program and an ever-increasing selection of course offerings, amenities and social opportunities. But no matter how much we grow, we will never lose sight of our fundamental mission. Every year, our students develop the skills necessary to transfer to outstanding colleges and universities like Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, Indiana University and scores of other fine four-year institutions. 
Our mission is what has made us successful. So while many things change, our mission is one thing that will not.

Clarkson named 'American Idol' by millions 
Asso~iated Press 
LOS ANGELES 

Kelly Clarkson. a cocktail waitress from Texas whose signature song was Aretha Franklin's "Respect," was judged America's next pop star Wednesday by the viewers of ''American Idol," 
After more than 15 million telephone votes were cast by viewers, the 20-year-old Clarkson beat Justin Guarini, the big-haired crooner from outside Philadelphia. 
Clarkson was the survivor among 10,000 entrants who thought they had what it takes to be pop stars. Along the way, the Fox series became the television hit of the summer, particularly among young viewers. 
Even Simon Cowell, the British judge with a penchant for the withering insult, was seen to wipe away a tear at the result. 
Clarkson earns a recording contract, and will release a CD single later this month and a full album in November. 
"How am I going to sing this next song while I'm crying?" Clarkson said before launching into her upcoming single, "A Moment Like This." She sang "Respect" for her initial audi­tion and again Tuesday, before the final voting opened. 
More than 18.2 million peo­ple watched "American Idol" Tuesday night as Clarkson and Guarini, 23, sang three songs each. More were expected for Wednesday's two-hour finale, as it has been the most popu­lar show for weeks among teenagers and young adults. 
Fox stretched out the sus­pense in a two-hour show, announcing the winner seven minutes before it ended. 
Celebrities sprinkled the crowd at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre, including sitcom stars Ray Romano and Jane Kaczmarek, of "Malcolm in the Middle." 
More than 100 million votes were cast over the course of the show this summer. 
One viewer, singer Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks, said she vot-ed five times for Clarkson, her fellow Texan. 
"I knew from the first episode that Kelly was the best one on there," Maines said. 
In Clarkson's hometown of Burleson, Texas, more than 500 students and their parents gathered in the gym of her old high school to cheer her victo­ry.

Bush will seek Congress' approval on Iraq policy 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

President Bush promised Wednesday to seek Congress' approval for "whatever is necessary" to oust Saddam Hussein including using military force, as the White House considered giving Iraq a last-ditch ultimatum over weapons inspectors. 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Congress would vote before the Nov. 5 elections on how to deal with the Iraqi president, ensuring that Iraq is a high­profile issue in the campaign for control of the House and Senate. 
Democrats who control the Senate said the non-binding resolution is possible but not certain because of the lack of time and Bush's failure thus far to make his case for war. "It would not be my assumption that the military course is the only action available to him today," said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D­S.D. 
"This is a debate the American people must hear, must understand," Bush said after a Cabinet Room meeting with 18 Democratic and Republican congressional leaders. "And the world must understand, as well, that its credibility is at stake." 
After weeks of conflict and criticism, Bush began a public relations campaign to convince Americans and wary allies of the need to overthrow Saddam and secure his weapons of mass destruction program -perhaps by opening a second, perilous front on the war against terror­ism. 
Essentially seeking a blank check, Bush told lawmakers, "At an appropriate time, and after consultations with the leader­ship, l will seek congressional support for 
U.S. action to do whatever is necessary to deal with the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime." 
Baghdad denounced Bush's "evil plans." Iraqi foreign minister Naji Sabri, speaking at the Arab foreign ministers meeting in Egypt, said: "These are whims and lies and pretexts ... all prepared with no evi­dence at all to support them." 
General Amr Moussa said the threat of war against Iraq "constitutes a danger for the stability of the entire region." But Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson said Bush was making the situation "polit­ically manageable." 
In South Africa, Secretary of State Colin Powell said he received "a solid expres-
WORLD NEWS BRIEFS 
Germany skeptical about Iraq attack: 
Body Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder rebuffed calls by Britain for Europe to help the United States against Iraq, saying Wednesday that Germany won't tone down its opposition to military action and won't "submit" to Washington. In blunt comments, Schroeder said Tony Blair does not speak for all Europe, a day after the British prime minister declared Iraq "a real and unique threat" to world security. 
Australia rethin~ signing Kyoto accord: 
Pressure mounts on Australia to ratify the Kyoto accord on climate change, Prime Minister John Howard softened his previous hardline opposition to the pact saying he might still sign. Australia has opposed the treaty, arguing that because developing countries are not covered, it would only transfer high polluting industries to poor countries without c~~t!~~ eillis~io!'s _that lead to global warming.

West Nile offers no immediate risk: 
Health officials were trying to determine Wednesday if West Nile virus can be spread through blood transfusions. But any test to screen donated blood for the sometimes deadly disease is at least months, maybe years, away, they said. Still, they emphasized that the blood supply is very safe and the risk of contracting West Nile from blood is significantly lower than the risk of forgoing any pro­cedure that would require a transfusion. 
Man threatens White House security: 
A man who police said may have made threats against President Bush was arrested Wednesday about two miles from the White House after author­ities discovered 16 guns in a car he was driving.

Security Council resolution that would set a deadline for Iraq to open its weapons sites to unfettered inspection and to apply punitive action if he refuses, three administration officials told The Associated Press on condition they not be identified. To get the resolution past a threatened veto by China or Russia, the resolution likely would not spell out the threat, but it would be obvious to Saddam, the officials said. 
Iraq agreed to allow international weapons inspectors after the 1991 Persian Gulf War, but they have been barred from the country since 1998. The United States believes Saddam is develop­ing chemical, biological and chemical

A parliamentary committee called for legalizing mari­juana use among adults, increasing pressure on the government to shift drug laws away from the zero-tol­erance policy of the United States. The report by the Senate Committee on Illegal Drugs recommended that Canada adopt a system that regulates marijuana the same way as alcohol, and expunge criminal records for marijuana possession.

Fabled bridge destroyed 
Associated Pre55 
WINTERSET, Iowa 
The covered wooden bridge made famous by the movie "The Bridges of Madison County" was severely damaged in a fire that authorilies said was intentionally set. 
Only a charred shell of the Cedar Bridge remained after the Tuesday night fire. The decking collapsed into the creek below. 
"There is no electricity to the bridge, there is no furnace," Madison County Sheriff Paul Welch said. "There is nothing there that would have initiated any fire on its own." 
A passer-by had called the sheriffs office after seeing the bridge in flames. The state fire marshal's office is investigat­ing. 
.Madison County has just five covered bridges remaining, all on the National Register of Historic Places, Welch said. Cedar Bridge, a 76-foot-long span built in 1883, was the last of the historic bridges open to traffic. 
Thousands of people have visited its span since Robert Waller's book "The Bridges of Madison County" was pub­lished in 1992. The 1995 film based on that novel featured Cedar Bridge. The bridge was renovated in 1998 at a cost of $1?R 000.

"Success in this endeavor is of most importance," Robinson said in an opening statement to fellow faculty. "Failure means we are voiceless and from that follows all sorts of ills. But, voice takes work, and we must begin that work tonight." 
Professor Remie Constable of the history department was appointed to the Senate's administrative affairs commit­tee. Classics professor David Ladouceur and aerospace and mechanical engineering profes­sor Edmundo Corona were appointed to the benefits com­mittee. 
Faculty Senate is divided into four committees, including the student committee and the aca­demic affairs committee. During the Wednesday night meeting, each committee rec­ommended a chairperson, all of which were approved by the Senate with minimal debate. 
Jacqueline Brogan, an English professor. was elected to chair the academic affairs committee and chemical engi­neering professor Al Miller was selected to lead the benefits committee.

The Senate voted to appoint Tom Merluzzi as chairman of the Administrative Affairs Committee. 
The Senate also voted to con­linue to allow Rick Rolley to occupy his seat as representa­tive for the Film, Television, and Theatre Department. Rolley's position as a profes­sional specialist had raised concerns that only teaching or researching faculty members could hold Senate seats not specifically designated for pro­fessional specialists. 
The decision to retain Rolley on the Senate, however, came also with an agreement to form an ad hoc Committee to read and revise the organization's bylaws. 
The senate elected Robinson to chair the committee and Barry Keating of the finance department and Steve Boker of the psychology department to serve on it. 
The Senate also unanimously elected Marsha Stevenson of University Libraries and Rich Williams of the Sociology Department to serve as the fac­ulty members on the Campus Life Council. 
Representatives agreed to postpone the appointment of members to the Traffic Appeals Board in order to gather more information on what the body does and when it meets.

IN BRIEF Design changes cost GM millions 
A judge upheld an $82 million verdict against General Motors for a collision that left a child with permanent brain damage and that raised questions about the automaker's design changes. 
Bullock County Circuit Judge Burt Smithart said the $82 million was reasonable because "GM made a conscious and deliberate decision to reduce safety in the Delta 88's and put occu­pants at risk." GM spokesman Jay Cooney said Wednesday the company would appeal. 
"This was just the first step in the process," he said. 
The case stemmed from a head-on collision on Dec. 10, 1999, near Smut Eye, 40 miles south­east of Montgomery. Jeffrey Jernigan, then 12, was in the front seat of a 1993 Oldsmobile Delta 88 with his seat belt on when the passenger compartment of the car collapsed on him, caus­ing him to lose part of his brain, said plaintiff's lawyer Jere Beasley. 
The boy's father, Wilbert Jernigan, sued GM, contending the car was defective and dangerous due to design changes made by GM. 
Decline in construction industry 
Construction spending was flat in July as an increase in government work helped to blunt cutbacks in private builders' construction pro­jects, which dropped to the lowest level in near­ly six years. 
After declining for two months, the level of construction spending in July was unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $834.1 bil­lion, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. That report along with more for­ward-looking data showing that manufacturing barely grew in August point to a sputtering eco­nomic recovery, economists said. 
In the construction market, the commercial side continues to be a source of weakness, reflecting reluctance by businesses to make big commitments in capital spending including new factories and other buildings given economic uncertainties, analysts said. 
United hopes to dodge Chapter 11 
+Continued service depends on unions 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO 

Bankruptcy might be a distinct possibility for United Airlines, but it is not inevitable, according to its new chief execu­
tive. 
Glenn Tilton's success or failure in avoiding a Chapter 11 filing could hinge on the support of unions at the world's No. 2 carrier -a reality Tilton acknowledged Wednesday by speaking to a meeting of union leaders just an hour after arriving in Chicago. 
Union leaders remain uneasy about the propos­al by Tilton's predeces­sor to slash labor costs by $1.5 billion annually in a bid to make United more cost-efficient and competitive. 
But union spokesmen said they appeared to be pleased by the new CEO's diplomacy and comments in a brief courtesy visit.

WTC attack cost economy billions 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

The economic impact of the World Trade Center attack could reach $95 billion and cost 83,000 jobs in New York, according to a report by the city's financial manager. 
Replacing the buildings, infra­structure and tenants' financial losses account for $21.8 billion of that sum, Comptroller William Thompson said in his fiscal analysis released Wednesday. 
"While this devastating event can never be reduced to numbers, it is clear that New York City and the nation will continue to suffer its economic ramifications for years to come," Thompson wrote in the 58­page report that provides the fullest picture to date on the economic shock felt in the city. 
For instance, the analysis found that half of the city's projected $6 billion budget deficit is directly attributable to the terrorist attack, including almost $3 billion in lost tax revenue. The city has also paid some $500 million in expenses that have not been reimbursed, includ­ing police and fire overtime and security costs. 
New York also eventually must pay some $36 million in debt ser­vice costs on the $1.5 billion bonds issued to balance its budget in the immediate weeks after the Sept. 11 attack. 
The report also found a particu­larly harsh loss in lower Manhattan in terms of its stock of commercial buildings, which represents the nation's third largest block of com­mercial office space after midtown Manhattan and Chicago's business district. 
Some 13 million square feet of prime office space downtown was destroyed -a total equal to the entire office space inventory of Atlanta or Miami. An additional 30 million square feet of office space was damaged.

Teachers contest city's decision 
Associated Press 
PIIILADELPHIA 

When art teacher Judith Wood looks around the Luis Munoz-Marin Elementary School, she doesn't see the bad teachers and unmotivated administrators that lawmakers have long claimed are respon­sible for poor student test scores. 
She secs children who are sickly thin or suffering from chronic asthma, kids boing raised by grandparents because mothers and fathers are on drugs or in jail, students from poor families who speak English as a second language. 
"These kids are struggling," 
Wood  said.  "But  it's  not  
because  they go  to  a  bad  
school."  

As a new school year begins Thursday, Wood and scores of other teachers are questioning Philadelphia's plan to trans­form its schools by turning them over to private compa­nies. They believe what goes on inside the classroom isn't the only problem facing the dis­trict. 
Munoz-Marin was one of 20 Philadelphia schools handed over this summer to Edison Schools, the for-profit educa­tion company that has become the center of debate over whether private companies can do a better job running public schools than the government. 
Twenty-five other Philadelphia schools are open­ing the school year under the control of other firms. universi­ties and nonprofit groups, including Chancellor Beacon Academies, Victory Schools and the University of Pennsylvania. 
State lawmakers, who seized control of the district in December, have heralded pri­vatiza tion, saying the new school managers will shed bureaucracy, hold teachers and students to a higher standard, and implement innovative cur­ricula. 
But teachers warn not to expect a drastic turnaround. For years they have seen other reform efforts fail in slums where children are exposed to drugs and suffer from a lack of parental involvement. 
"These private companies act like they can reinvent the wheel," Wood said. "They'll bring in a new staff, new prin­cipals, but after three years of experiments it's not going to be better, it's not going to be worse, and at the end of it all you are still going to be dealing with students who are impover­ished." 

Katrina Bulkley, an assistant professor of education policy at Rutgers University's Graduate School of Education, said com­panies like Edison have been handed the schools with the worst socioeconomic problems -a factor that will handicap their efforts to turn them around quickly. 
"They are going to have to struggle with the fact that the kids come to school with a whole host of problems that you really can't do anything about, no matter who is run­ning the school," Bulkley said. 
Edison has acknowledged the difficulty of its mission, but said the key is to refuse to hold stu­dents from poor neighborhoods to a lower standard. 
The· company's Chicago Math instruction program, for exam­ple, is considered among the most demanding for both stu­dents and teachers, and begins introducing algebraic concepts as early as elementary school. 
Edison also tracks individual students more carefully than most public schools and pro­vides extra teacher training ­something the company said is essential in an underprivileged district where many teachers cannot afford to take classes on their own. 
There are other areas, though, where the company will have less control. 

West Nile blood test 
difficult to develop 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 
Officials don't yet know if a blood test for West Nile virus is even needed -but if it is, it won't be easy to develop. · 
Health officials were scram­bling to determine if West Nile virus can be spread through blood transfusions, even as they omphasized that the blood sup­ply is very safe. The risk of con­tracting West Nile from blood is significantly lower than the risk of forgoing any procedure that would call for a blood transfu­sion, they said. 
Ultimately, a screening test is probably needed, said Dr. Lester Crawford, acting com­missioner of the Food and Drug Administration. He said govern­ment would work with industry to stimulate faster development of a test. 
Even so, testing for the virus is complicated. Some of the tests that are used to diagnose West Nile in sick patients won't pick up the virus in donated blood. Other tests are more promising, but they would require significant improve­ments to be practical on a mass scale, enabling blood banks to screen millions of pints each year. 
'Tm reasonably optimistic that if needed, it could be done," said Dr. Jesse Goodman, deputy director of the Center for Biologics, Evaluation and Research at the FDA. 
Others are less confident. 
"It's going to take several years to have a test suitable for blood donors," said Dr. Harvey 
G. Klein, chief of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health and past president of the American Association of Blood Banks. 
West Nile, which emerged in the United States just three years ago, has exploded across much of the country this sum­mer. with 673 cases and 32 deaths. But concern hit new heights Tuesday when officials confirmed that at least three of four people who had received organs from a Georgia woman had contracted the disease. One died. 
Officials said they are con­vinced that these patients con­tracted the disease through their transplants, though they don't yet know whether the virus can be spread through blood as well. 
Dozens of epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the CDC lab in Fort Collins, Colo., were trying to figure out how the organ donor, a Georgia woman who died in a car crash, got West Nile. She had received blood from more than 60 donors before she died, and they were tracing those blood donors to see if any of them have the virus. They are also tracking down about a dozen other people who had received transfusions from the same donors.

More than 30 years after his over-the-top 1971 cult shriekfest Let's Scare Jessica to Death, director John Hancock returns to the genre fold with a new flick that leaves the top but the merest speck in the (decidedly 
cracked) rear-view mirror. With enough goofy, gruesome twists to fill a half-dozen thrillers, Suspended Animation starts out as a cannibalistic Misery (complete with Kathy Bates clone Allen) as major Hollywood animator Tom Kempton (McArthur) finds himself a captive of a supremely scary middle-age sister act-backwoods Baby Jane variation Vanessa Boulette (Esterman) and her portly sib Ann (Allen)-following a Midwestern snowmobile mishap. After a couple of sadistic, squirm-inducing vignettes, the film suddenly veers into icy deliverance terrain before time-and-place-shifting to L.A. and a profusion of additional shocks and surprises so extreme as to border on literal overkill, including a close-up pimple-popping moment to rival Clean Shaven's infamous fingernail-removal scene. To delve into specifics would seriously risk ruining Suspended Animations unapologetic Grand Guignol pleasures; suffice it to say that Hancock and scripter Dorothy Tristan have the chops to pull off one of the most outlandish fearfests of recent years, one that would form a terrif twinbill with the Don Dohler gore-a-thon Ha, vesters (VS#42). Among the thesps, former screen psycho McArthur (Rampage) turns in strenuous work as an ultra-victim, rivaling Zahra Lampert's ordeal in Jessica. The Bou\ette Family-including serial-killer teen grandson Sandor (Meyers) and creepy jailbird brother Philip (Freeman)-can take its rightful place beside The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Sawyer clan as one of the nuttiest nuclear units in fright-film history. ,Vben we caught Suspended Animation at a Palm Beach International Film Festival matinee, the audience gasps were loud and frequent; this would have been a great flick to watch with a vintage 42nd Street crowd. Look for it wherever it turns up next, hopefully in time for Halloween 2002.

Sharon sees possibility for reconciliation with Palestine 
Associated Pre~ 
JERUSALEM 
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon says that for the first time in nearly two years of fighting, he sees the possibility of a negotiated deal with the Palestinians because many of them are souring on violence. 
Sharon's statement came just hours after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accused Israel of crimes against humanity for expelling two people from the West Bank to Gaza on Wednesday. The two are relatives of a Palestinian explosives expert accused by Israel of sending suicide bombers into Tel Aviv. 
On Thursday, police said they discovered a car bomb containing 1,350 pounds of explosives -one of the biggest ever -that had been brought into northern Israel from the West Bank. The car bomb was detonated in an open space and no injuries were reported. 
David Baker. an official at the prime minister's office, said the car bombing was probably planned to coincide with the Jewish New Year, which begins at sunset on Friday. 
In a series of interviews with Israeli TV stations on Wednesday, Sharon said he sees hope for a peace agree­ment with the Palestinians. 
Sharon has ruled out talks with Arafat, charging that he has encouraged militants to attack Israel. However, Sharon said he could talk to Palestinians who have reached the conclusion that by terror­ism nothing can be achieved. 

Sharon told Channel Two television. "Now for the first time I see a possibility of open­ing the road to a political set­tlement... However, he did not elaborate about what kind of settlement he envisioned. He said "discrete" contacts with Palestinians are continuing, but would not say with whom. 
Arafat complained that Israel is sabotaging efforts to stop the violence. "Unfortunately everything we face here is more and more Israeli escalation," he said after a meeting Wednesday with Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller in the West Bank town of Ramallah. 
Denmark holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, and Moeller is trying to win acceptance of a plan that envisions Palestinian state­hood by 2005. 
He said the EU concept is to combine all the plans now on the table and present a unified program to the "quartet" deal­ing with the Mideast: the United States, Russia, EU and United Nations. 
In the past. Sharon has said he would consider creation of a Palestinian state at the end of a long process. 
In the TV interviews, Sharon also said Israel is not pressing the United States to attack Iraq, but "we fully support any American decision that will be adopted with regard to contin­uation of the war on terror­ism." 
On Wednesday, the Israeli military expelled a brother and sister of a Palestinian mil­itant from the West Bank to Gaza, the first time Israel has forced relatives of militants to leave their home areas. 
World leaders blame Rio Earth Summit 
Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG 
World leaders and global activists here agree on this much: Blame it on Rio. 
The Earth Summit 10 years ago in Rio de Janeiro grandly resolved to save all of nature, from the humblest algae to the majestic elephant. And it agreed the planet's delicate cli­mate urgently needed protec­tion before global warming rises to unbearable levels. 
How to fulfill that sweeping vision -while lifting billions of people from crushing poverty ­became the ditlicult job of dele­gates to the World Summit on Sustainable Developi:nent, which closed Wednesday. 
And in the end, the world summit turned out much like sustainable development itself: Slow. Unspectacular. A handful of small victories and some promising new initiatives. 
The goal of sustainable devel­opment is to promote economic growth and alleviate poverty while protecting the environ­ment. 
But the most daunting issues -species extinctions. infectious disease, trade subsidies, cleaner energy -remain stubbornly unresolved. 
Whereas Rio produced a pair of global treaties on global warming and preserving species, this summit's final action plan offers just a few broad -and nonbinding ­promises for change. 

Summit leaders said Johannesburg established sus­tainable development as a glob­al issue on a par with peace and human rights. It was destined to be a nitty-gritty meeting marked by horse-trading deals, they said. 
The summit opened nearly two weeks ago with a flourish of lofty Rio-esque rhetoric. South African President Thabo Mbeki predicted the world summit would be "a fitting culmination to a decade of hopes" after Rio. 
By Wednesday, leaders were careful not to overreach. 
"They were naturally diflicult talks," said French President Jacques Chirac, but it brought "a new momentum to the process of sustainable develop­ment. On the whole, they advanced things." 
Chirac was the most visible Western leader after President Bush declined to attend and British Prime Minister Tony Blair left early. 
Activists left Johannesburg feeling betrayed by world lead­ers who. they said, offered "crumbs for the poor." 
"When the time came for tar­gets, timetables and money. they let the world down," said Andrew Hewitt of Oxfam International. 
The military considers the Arafat denounced the expul­threat of expulsion, along with sions as a "crime against destruction of family homes, humanity that violates all as an effectiv.e way to deter human and international Palestinians from carrying out laws." attacks. Expulsion is seen by the Palestinians as severe punish­ment. Palestinians live in extended families, are deeply rooted in their communities and arc much less mobile than people in Western societies.

Lawsuit alleges Iraqi involvement in terror attacks 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

A lawsuit filed Wednesday claims Iraq knew Osama bin Laden was targeting the Pentagon and New York City prior to Sept. 11 and that it sponsored terrorists for a decade to avenge its defeat in the Gulf War. 
USince Iraq could not defeat the U.S. military, it resorted to terror attacks on U.S. citi­zens," according to the law­suit filed in U.S. District Court seeking more than $1 trillion in damages on behalf of 1,400 victims of the Sept. 11 attacks and their families. 
The suit names bin Laden, al-Qaida and Iraq as defen­dants. It was brought by Kreindler & Kreindler, a New York law firm specializing in aviation disaster litigation. 
The lawsuit tries to draw a link between Iraq and terror­ism that the government has so far not alleged in public court actions. 
It relies in part on a news­paper article published July 21, 2001, in Al Nasiriyah, 185 miles southwest of Baghdad. 

The law firm provided The Associated Press with a copy of the article written in Arabic and an English translation. 
According to the lawsuit, a columnist writing under the byline Naeem Abd Muhalhal described bin Laden thinking "seriously, with the serious­ness of the Bedouin of the desert, about the way he will try to bomb the Pentagon 
after he destroys the White House." 
The columnist also allegedly wrote that bin Laden was "insisting very convincingly that he will strike America on the arm that is already hurt­ing," a possible reference to the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. 
The lawsuit says a former associate of Muhalhal con­tends the writer has been connected with Iraqi intelli­gence since the early 1980s. It also says Muhalhal was praised by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the Sept. 1, 2001, issue for his "docu­mentation of important events and heroic deeds that proud Iraqis have accomplished." 
Jim Kreindler. a lawyer for the firm, said Muhalhal had advance knowledge of al­Qaida's specific targets on Sept. 11 and that "Iraqi offi­cials were aware of plans to attack American landmarks." 
"Further, we have evidence that Iraq provided support for bin Laden and his al-Qaida terror organization for nearly a decade," he said. 
The lawsuit said there have been numerous meetings between Iraqi intelligence agents and high-ranking al­Qaida members to plan terror attacks. 
It said one of those meetings occurred in 1992 when bin Laden's chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, whose where­abouts are now unknown, met with Iraqi intelligence agents in Baghdad over several days.

On Sept. 11, America won't mourn alone 
What would a Middle Eastern Muslim in another country have to say about America? 
Our flats in London are in an Arab district, so this is the perfect chance to find out. In the 40-minute walk back from our school buildings, I stop by a few of the Arab stores near our flats to connect with Andrew the neighbors. I probably look like a clueless American wandering through DeBerry shops up and down the street with my backpack, but that's okay. As Fr. ND Going McNeil, the founder of the Center for 
Global 
Social Concerns, said in the book "Compassion," we must be "called out of our familiar places to unknown ter­ritories, out of our ordinary and proper places to the places where people hurt and where we can experience with them our common human brokenness and our com­mon need for healing." 
The first man who welcomes me is Haider, a Muslim from Babylon in Iraq. He verifies that I can understand his English and smiles brightly. In between customers buying fruit displayed outside and wrapped loaves of bread, we talk about Sept. 11. He tells me about his shock when he first heard the news and chides anyone claiming to have attacked in the name of Allah: "Muslim people do not approve killing innocent people!" 
A few blocks away in another store, I meet Ifran, a Muslim from Pakistan. Unlike Haider, he is wholly support­ive of America's response, saying, "I think they should do more!" He thinks that the majority in Pakistan agree with him, and only the uneducated, illiterate in his country are swayed to think this to be more of a religious conflict than one about terrorism. He views America's reaction as an effort grounded not in oil-mongering but in the protection of all: "What they are doing is good for the whole world." 
I assumed that his views are so supportive simply because he is Pakistani, but I was wrong. In another shop a few yards away I meet another man from Pakistan. However, his views are the converse of1fran's in thinking that American government should "stop killing innocent people." He thinks that the majority of Pakistani agree with him and that only the weak politicians are supporting America. He is concerned that the number of innocent peo­ple killed in the Middle East may be greater than that killed in the Towers. 
He taught me several basic beliefs of Islam. Like many faiths, Islam promotes values of peace and love. Christians at Notre Dame or in America might think that Islam dis­credits Christ all together, but they actually uphold his teachings and view him as a prophet that will return. He also emphasizes that the actions on Sept. 11 are not repre sentative of his faith: "What the terrorists did was not Islam." There arc more similarities between my faith and his than [ expected. 
My final stop in Baskin Robbins may have been the most dynamic. In this American store, I meet a Hindu, Indian man in his fifties with gray-black hair and a white apron. Although his family is from India, he grew up in Uganda before the presidency of !di Ameen, a harsh dictator who ousted the Indians from the country in the 1970s before he himself was expelled. 
Having finished a CSC International Summer Service Project in Uganda just a few weeks ago, I am thrilled to meet this person, a living history to a story I only heard about. We laugh remembering common Lusoga expres­sions. He then tells me about the goodness of the Ugandan people: "No matter what faith you have, many people have the same good values." 
The ice cream guru asks about what l've found so far, and he shares that business this time of year in his shop is slower than usual. "The people in the Middle East are scared to travel," he postulates. 
A man in a blazer stops in for a scoop. He adds an objec­tive perspective that the response in the Middle East shouldn't be about what America wants but what the United Nations decides. Though he's non-practicing, Mehdad was raised in an Islam family in Iran. 
I'm a half-Chinese, Catholic student standing in an American shop in an Arab district in London, talking with a Hindu, Indian ice cream shopkeeper whose family got expelled from Uganda and with a Muslim, Iranian accoun­tant wanting some peach ice cream. Notre Dame has a larger reach than I knew about my freshman year. 
There's something momentously important about having that direct, personal interaction with people. Like McNeil writes, "When information about human suffering comes to us through a person who can be embraced, it can be humanized." News stories may only frustrate us, but we can form a relationship with a smiling shopkeeper. 
Each person I spoke with, no matter what their political opinions, expressed concern for those hurt on Sept. 11, which my Iraqi friend Haider sums up best: 
"Tell them I sympathize for them. I know that they were innocent people who were working to provide for their families. We remember the innocent people killed in the Middle East. And we remember your families, fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters." 
With this weekend's match with Purdue, many may recall this game last year being postponed in solemn remem­brance. On the year anniversary, this American community in London will be one at heart with you in America. But we won't be the only ones.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Think twice before 
hanging the flag 
I got an e-mail message this week. You probably got one like it. It began, "On Sept. 11 wear red, white and blue." The words on the screen then faded, and for a full five minutes my com­puter flashed those images of human suffering that we all saw everywhere last fall in the glossy pages of magazines and on the flash of TV screens. I saw people running from build­ings covered in debris, firemen searching in vain for human remains among smoldering rub­ble and buildings exploding in flame. 
The images were so potent and powerful that the author of the e-mail thought they would persuade me to put out my flag and to wear our nation's colors on Sept. 11. But patriotism, I think, is no antidote to hatred. l find no comfort in the American flag. Is there no better way to honor our dead? 
Here at Notre Dame and across the nation on Sept. 11, there will plenty of flag waving. We are a patriotic people in the midst of a war against terror­ism overseas, and we are on the verge of a ground war in Iraq. 
But before you put out a flag ask yourself what it signifies. Where do your ultimate alle­giances lie? Are you first an American? Or a Christian? Or are you first a human? 
Maybe you're not an American at all. Notre Dame is not just a college for American students. We are an interna­tional university. In 2001 there were undergraduates attending Notre Dame from 64 countries outside the United States and graduate students from 87. Likewise, hundreds of non­Americans died beside us in the terrorist attacks on the United States last fall. The Catholic Church is a universal church, not an American one. Here at Notre Dame, we should under­stand that nationalism is not the appropriate response to murder on the part of our government or on the part of any other gov­ernment or group. Mourning is. 
If you must hang a flag, hang an Earth flag, in the hope that we might someday live as brothers and sisters with all people regardless of nationality. Or don't hang any flag at all. Just sit quietly and reflect, or chill with a group of people and sing, or write "Pray for peace" on your door or "We remem­ber" in your window or attend a vigil or a lecture on the conflict in the Middle East. 
Our nation's war against ter­rorism is not a football game, and the American flag is not just another trendy fashion accessory. There are no win­ners here. 
Those who died on Sept. 11 will never be brought back. War is not something to be celebrat­ed, even if you think it is neces­sary or inevitable. Then it should be understood as a nec­essary tragedy, and the nation­state a necessary but imperfect division among peoples. 
The Notre Dame family is not synonymous with the American family. Be hospitable to our international students, many of whom hail from countries with which we have at one time been at war. Examine your alle­giances and search your heart before you hang the flag.

The Shirt 


promotes unity, raises funds 
In 1989, a car accident brought the Notre Dame fami­ly together when students came to the aid of the criti­cally injured student by selling a game-day T-shirt. This display of unity has grown into the largest stu­dent-run fundraiser on campus, and is now known as "The Shirt Project." 
Through a single shirt, it seems, the Notre Dame stu­dent body combined an enthusiasm for athletics with a commitment to their fellow students, and in doing so achieved an outcome far beyond their initial goal. 
Today, after 13 years, sales of "The Shirt" raises over $200,000 annually. Half of the proceeds go to Student Activities to help fund clubs, dances, concerts and speakers. The rest of the money is set aside for a chari­ty that directly benefits Notre Dame students. 
Last spring, funding from "The Shirt" sponsored the hugely successful Domer Donors Bone Marrow drive. 
This year "The Shirt" is bright green, bright enough to show up on national television. Notre Dame is about school spirit and unity. With a proud display of green, prove that the Notre Dame family is committed to sup­porting our fellow students. 
On game day, support Coach Willingham and the Fighting Irish "Return to Glory" by wearing "The Shirt." . 
Be a part of the sea of green. Go Irish!

Rumble, don't mumble, when supporting Fighting Irish athletic teams this weekend 
Womens soccer team counts on fan support 
Help! I want to take a moment and ask all of our students for a favor . .The womens soccer program has a huge tournament this weekend, hosting No. 1 Santa Clara on Friday night at 7:30 
p.m. and No. 4 Portland at 1 p.m. on Sunday. We really need your support (all students) to help us get these victories this weekend. 
When we travel to Portland and Santa Clara, they have tremendous student support, and they antagonize and intimidate our team like crazy. We really need you to come dressed in green (or Notre Dame) gear and be loud as we face these national powers.. You guys may not realize how important you are to us and all the athletic teams here, but your support is huge. 
Please come by after the football pep rally. Your student IDs get you into the game. Even if you aren't a soccer fan, your support could really be helpful to us. Thanks so much as I truly believe we have the best sports fans in the country. 
Randy Waldrum head women's soccer coach 

Silence is not golden in Notre Dame Stadium 
Our campus has some serene places: the lakes, the Grotto and the Basilica -places where peace can be found amidst the rush of daily life. Unfortunately, the same could be said for Notre Dame Stadium in recent years. I have been truly surprised at how quiet the crowd can be during a game at times. I challenge all fans to do two things for this season 
and beyond. First, we should loudly support our Irish. When our guys are on offense and need to communicate verbally, a little less ruckus is 
appropriate. However, when Notre Dame is on defense and oppo­nents are trying to communicate, we should be shaking down serious thunder: not just after the interceptions, not just after sacks and not just on third downs when the team is on defense. What if the players decided to play only on third down? 
When Purdue and others go on offense this year, they should have a hard time hearing themselves think, let alone each other. Furthermore, I have noticed that "when the team is up 
against it and the breaks are beating the boys" that the place gets amazingly silent, to the pleasure of the opposition. If any­
thing, it is at precisely this time that the home-field advantage should kick in to lift a struggling team's spirit and energy. Second, I encourage people to find ways to get louder. Shaking keys 
is pretty lame. Bells from local craft stores work well or shaking a film container with a few quarters insides can make five times the noise of a set of car keys. 
With Coach Willingham's home debut and the new alumni cheering section, this sea­son is a perfect time to commit ourselves to making the Stadium a polite, yet very loud environment for visi­tors. If we risk getting too loud and drawing a penalty, the players and coaches will let us know and we can tone it down. 
Silence in Notre Dame Stadium is only golden on football Saturdays when it is in the section where visiting fans are seated.

MOVIE REVIEW 

'Blood Work' a film that bloody doesn't work 
By SHAWN NEWBURG Scene Movie Critic 
"Blood Work," directed and pro­duced by Clint Eastwood, was launched into the running for worst movie of the year a couple weeks ago. A shallow, predictable plot with numerous holes, extremely poor act­ing worsened only by a lame script and average cinematography left crowds either laughing or groaning at just how bad this movie was. 
Clint Eastwood plays Terry McCaleb, an ex-FBI agent living on a houseboat. The movie starts with a chase scene while McCaleb is still in the FBI. He is one of the best, but cannot seem to track down a serial killer. A chase scene ensues in which he shoots the killer, not killing him, but then he has a heart attack. 
Two years later, older and retired, he needs a heart transplant and lucki­ly enough receives one. The heart he receives belongs to a woman who was murdered, and her sister, played by Wanda De Jesus, comes to beg McCaleb to track down the killer. McCaleb has a soft spot and takes on the case despite his poor health. He is apparently well enough to shoot at bad guys, dive away from speeding cars and have a love scene. Eventually, with the help of his neigh­bor, Buddy Noone (Jeff Daniels), McCaleb tracks down the killer. 
Daniels is the one bright spot of the movie. His character is well developed and has a few good lines. He alone seems to further the entire movie until the big anticlimactic shoot-out finale. His friendship with McCaleb helps save a little of Eastwood's per­formance. 
De Jesus turns in a refreshing per­formance as Graciela Rivers. She is McCaleb's love interest and the sister of the murder victim. She carries the supporting role well and adds a little depth to a character despite having to work through poor scripting. 
Nearly everyone else's acting is extremely forced, especially 

Eastwood's. His days as Dirty Harry only serves to allow Rodriguez to are long over and his performance throw out awful one-liners. He feels very tired. He attempts to pull attempts to provide comic relief to a

character's position. The audience sees her only as a doctor who per­formed the heart transplant surgery, but she seems to have way too much emotion invested in McCaleb's case to not have any other motives. 
Overall, "Blood Work" is in an over­worked genre-film starring an aged Eastwood that fails to deliver the way he or the genre used to. The plot is very predictable, the dialogue is awful and the cinematography is average. If you want to see a good Clint Eastwood detective movie, save some money and rent a Dirty Harry movie.

a movie with brain and brawn 
more like stealing than praise. Still. Spielberg's skill at composing scenes speaks for itself. 
The CCI effects in the movie are breathtaking. From spider-like scan robots to a computerized highway. Spielberg incorporates each sci-fl ele­ment into his film in such a way that, despite the stunning effects, they are secondary to the movie's plot. 
The movie presents a number of interesting philosophical and ethical debates. Unlike similar mind tickling movies like "The Matrix" and "Vanilla Sky," "Minority Report" actually exam­ines more difficult issues than the average first­day Phil 101 student who learns what epistemics means. The entire audience wiH leave the theater discussing the problems the movie presents. 
While movies in this genre often examine the existence of free will within an external system like a computer program or determined future, "Minority Report" takes more educated look at what it means to know the future. 
Spielberg's real charm in this film is his ability to incorporate the load of college bull philosophy 
with state of the art special effects and classic cinematography. The result is a movie that isn't all intellectual, visually over indulgent or campy. "Minority Report" is a sci-fi movie the genre can be proud of. 
Cruises' star-power doesn't hurt the film either. Cruise. whose career seemed doomed to being just another pretty face close to twenty years ago, puts in one of his best performances to date. Despite a convenient sob story, Cruise puts in enough energy into his role to convince the audi­ence to suspend their disbelief. Of course, he's not exactly looking at Oscar nominations here either. 
Almost everybody should find something enjoy­able in "Minority Report;" even if you're not interested whether denontological or consequen­tialist ethics are superior, there are always rock­et pack chase scenes to make up the difference.

Derek Lowe (18-7), who had pitched six scoreless innings this year in his first career start at Yankee Stadium, got out of a two-on, no-outs jam in the first when he retired Giambi, Bernie Williams and Jorge Posada in order. 
But Lowe, who had been 6-1 in his previous nine starts, couldn't hold the lead in the third. He gave up a leadoff opposite-field double to right to rookie Juan Rivera, then hit Alfonso Soriano just below the left shoulder with a pitch. 
Cubs 3, Brewers O 

Moises Alou is doing his best to salvage something from a for­gettable first season with Chicago Cubs. 
Alou was 4-for-4 with an RBI and Carlos Zambrano pitched eight shutout innings to snap his five-game losing streak as the Cubs beat the Milwaukee Brewers 3-0 on Wednesday. 
Alou raised his batting aver­age to .281. 
"The beginning of the year I struggled a lot," Alou said. "I was very disappointed in myself and kind of embarrassed, too." 
Zambrano (3-6). who retired 13 of the first 15 batters, struck out six and walked four in his longest career outing. Robert Machado got the first of Milwaukee's three hits off Zambrano in the fifth inning. 
"The potential has been there, it is just the matter of consisten­cy," Cubs interim manager Bruce Kimm said. "I saw him last year at times like today and at times he would be so-so being a young pitcher" 
The 21-year-old right-hander won for the first time since July 
15. Antonio Alfonseca got three outs for his 17th save in 23 chances. 
The Brewers only had three runners get past first base. Richie Sexson, who went 2-for­4, did it twice -reaching third in the seventh and second in the ninth. 
"If he is pitching hard like that, not may people are going to hit him," Brewers manager Jerry Royster said. "The stuff he threw today was electric. They have some starters who are for real." 
Fred McGriff led off the Cubs fourth with a double, moved to third on Alou's single, and scored to make it 2-0 on Nelson Figueroa's wild pitch. 
The Cubs loaded the bases against Figueroa in the sixth on Alou's single and two walks. Valerio De Los Santos relieved and issued another walk to Bobby Hill to force in Chicago's final run. 
Albu singled in Sammy Sosa in the first inning to give the Cubs a 1-0 lead. 
Figueroa (1-6). who has lost five straight decisions, allowed all three runs on six hits and five walks in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out a career-high eight. 
Twins 3, Mariners 2 

When the Minnesota Twins needed to get out of their funk, Rick Reed's big-game experi­ence showed. 
Reed outpitchcd Jamie Moyer and the AL Central-leading Twins snapped a season-high five-game losing streak with a 3-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday. 
"He's proving why he's been an All-Star," Minnesota manag­er Ron Gardenhire said. "He is proving now why he has been around for so long. He's a veter­an who 'knows how to compete and get people out." 
Jacque Jones had three hits for the Twins, who won the sea­son series (5-4) against Seattle for the first time since 1992. 
Reed (13-7) stymied the Mariners until the eighth inning, sending them to their fifth loss in eight games. 
An All-Star in 1998 and 2001, Reed started the only game the New York Mets won against the New York Yankees in the 2000 World Series. 
Reed wanted to halt Minnesota's losing skid in the worst way. 
"Yeah, I wanted to stop it," he said. "I was tired of losing. I'm kind of hoping everybody in this clubhouse is tired of losing." 
Third-place Seattle fell three and one-half games back of Anaheim in the wild-card race. The Mariners began the day six games behind Oakland in the AL West. 
"What are you going to do?" Mariners manager Lou Piniella said after watching his defend­ing division champions fall far­ther back in the race with 23 games left. "These games here are precious and they're getting away from us." 
Eddie Guardado pitched the ninth inning and got his AL· leading 39th save in 45 oppor­tunities despite giving up a lead­off home run to Edgar Martinez. 
Guardado pitched for the first time since Sunday, when he gave up a three-run homer to Miguel Tejada in the ninth in a 7-5 loss in Oakland. 
The Twins came to Seattle after losing three straight in Oakland. 
"There is a lot of pressure out there," Guardado said. "Hopefully, we can learn from the Oakland series and this series. This is our job and we have to battle through it." 
Reed won a rematch to Moyer (13-7) after losing to him last Thursday in Minnesota. 
Reed won for the fourth time in his last five starts. He blanked the Mariners until Jose Offerman homered to lead off the eighth. 
In 7 1/3 innings, Reed gave up six hits and one walk, with five strikeouts. When Martinez walked in the fifth, it was just the fifth walk given up by Reed since the All-Star break. 
Indians 9, Tigers 3 
Jaret Wright is finally starting to gain some confidence. 
Wright won for the first time in nearly 15 months as the Cleveland Indians took advan­tage of sloppy Detroit fielding to beat the Tigers 9-3 Wednesday night. 
"To bring your confidence back after what went on and what not, it takes a couple of good innings," Wright said. "You see what you have for that game and keep it going." 
Wright, one of the most promising pitchers in the game before being plagued by injuries, had been 0-5 with a 
17.83 ERA since beating Minnesota on June 5, 2001. He spend much of the past three seasons on the disabled list or on rehab stints in the minors after undergoing surgery on his right shoulder in August 2000. 
"It felt like a long time, so this felt pretty good," he said. 
Wright (1-3) allowed three runs -two earned -and six hits in five innings to get the win against Detroit. 
"That's a building block for him right there," Indians man­ager Joel Skinner said.

A complaiut, on file in the Montgomery County Clerk of Courts, was filed against Chattams on Aug. 12 alleging he was involved in a theft of property valued at $500 or more. No charges had been filed against him as of late Tuesday, and the case has not been given to a grand jury. 
Tressel said he was waiting on a phone call from Chattams that might clarify the situation. 
"The only thing l know is, we had him go home to find out a lit­tle bit of what the situation is, so that we can respond to it," he said. 
Tressel said Chattams told him "that there may be something he had to take care of." He said no further decisions would be made regarding Chattams' status on the team until more information was known. 

Chattams, a 5-foot-11, 185­pound sophomore, had two catches for 26 yards in nine games last year. He played in Ohio State's season opener against Texas Tech on Aug. 24. 
His departure is the latest blow to a team that has lost several key players recently .

Teams will pause in memory of Sept. 11 
Associated Press 
All major league baseball night games on Sept. 11 will pause at 
9:11 p.m. local time for a moment of silence in remem­brance of last year's terrorist attacks. 
NFL fans. meanwhile, will hear an address this week on last year's events from President Bush and team personnel will wear logos commemorating the events. 
Following the moment of silence at the baseball games, a videotape will be shown in mem­ory of those who died. During afternoon games on Sept. 11, the moment of silence will be held during the seventh-inning stretch, and the video will follow. 
"All of us in baseball were dev­astated by the horrific attack on our country last September 11, and it is with a great deal of sad­ness and grief that we will mark the first anniversary," commis­sioner Bud Selig said Wednesday. 
"We take this opportunity to honor the memories of those lost and to pay tribute to the firefighters, police officers, res­cue workers and all those who sacrificed their lives trying to save others," Selig said. 
Bush's talk to NFL fans will be shown on CBS and FOX tele­casts and played on stadium screens for the 10 season-open­ing games Sunday that start at 1 
p.m. EDT. It will be followed by the Marine Corps Band playing "America The Beautiful." 
In addition, sideline personnel from all the teams will wear a 9/11 patch on their clothing along with an American flag. 
Members of the New York Giants and Jets will wear caps with the initials or logos of the New York fire and police departments or the New York/New Jersey Port Authority personnel. The Giants open the season Thursday night against San Francisco, part of the cele­bration of Sept. 11. 
The Washington Redskins will wear caps with a Pentagon logo. 
During the baseball games, a special logo will be displayed on the field, outfield walls, bases and lineup cards, incorporating the Stars and Stripes, the major league baseball logo, a red­white-and-blue ribbon and the phrase "We Shall Not Forget." Players' caps and outerwear that day will include the American flag, and each fan attending a game that day will receive a commemorative T  shirt that features the logo. 
Fans will be encouraged to wear the T-shirt during the game, specifically for the moment of silence. 
In addition, New York Knicks players A1lan Houston and Charlie Ward will sponsor an event at Madison Square Garden on Sept. 11 called "A Tribute to Grace and Hope." 
On Saturday night, NASCAH and Richmond International Raceway are planning a pre-race tribute to include a spectacular card display by more than 100,000 spectators, a flag salute by Winston Cup drivers and crew members as well as a special "Gentlemen, Start Your Engines" command by American Military personnel via satellite. 
In the Busch series race on Friday night, Bobby Hamilton Jr. will drive a car with a special paint scheme from his sponsor, the U.S. Marine Corps. The No. 25 Ford will be called "The Patriotism Car" in support of the Marines. 
It will be draped in an American Flag on all sides, with the Marines logo on the hood. 
"I am proud to be a part of such a tribute," Hamilton said. "I don't think anyone will forget where they were or how they felt when they first received word of the terrorist attacks. 
On Sept. 22 at Dover International Speedway, Bobby

Labonte will drive a Pontiac with the phrase "Let's Holl" splashed across the hood in conjunction with the Todd Beamer Foundation. The No. 18 Pontiac, usually bright green, will be red, white and blue during the race. 
"Our team couldn't be more thrilled to be honoring a tremen­dous American hero through the Todd Beamer Foundation," said team owner Joe Gibbs. "When we learned that this foundation is all about helping kids, we knew we needed to be partners. I hope all of our fans will rally around and support our 'Let's Roll' car." 
Any money made off the car through merchandise will be donated to the Todd M. Beamer Foundation. Action Performance is will create a full line of No. 18 Pontiac "Let's Roll" die-cast cars and donate all proceeds to the Beamer Foundation. 
Aretha Franklin and Art Garfunkel will sing "America The Beautiful" prior to men's and women's finals this weekend at the U.S. Open.

Defensive line has i111.portant role against Boilern1akers

Weaver, who earned second­team All-American honors from ABC Sports last year, helped instill leadership in the group of defensive linemen who would carry on for him when he left. More than anything, he relied less on words and more on his strong work ethic to set an example. "He left an impression on us," Campbell said. "A lot of us tried to mold our game, our tech­nique after him because he was simply flawless. It was beautiful watching him play."

Ans,Ner the Call 
¦ by Fr. Richard Warner, c.s.c. Director, Campus Ministry & Counselor to the President 
This past weekend, in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, two men accepted ordination as members of the Congregation of Holy Cross. Tom Eckert, C.S.C., who pronounced his perpetual profession on Saturday, August 31, was ordained a deacon on September l. He will serve as a deacon at St. John Vianney Parish in Phoenix during the coming year. Our own Sam Peters, C.S.C., who works in Campus Ministry and is rector of Sorin Hall, W4S ordained a priest in the presence of many Sorin Hall residents. 
Ir was my privilege to offer the following reflection.,; at a prayer service the day before rhe ordinarions cook place. 
There are probably as many places in the Gospel where Jesus invites people to become his disciples, as there are passages with clear assurances that as many ministries and services are available to every Christian Commu­nity as there are needs. In each situation, however, accepting discipleship and its costs and blessings, and providing for the needs of God's people, depend on decisions we make; decisions which Tom and Sam have made. These decisions can only be made in that place where God speaks to us most directly, and where we recognize and know and understand that "it is the Lord who beckons." 
The events which we will celebrate this weekend were born at the moment of the Annunciation and

the importance of human relationships, love and service. Jesus showed us what it means co love and to act with compassion towards everyone. 
The events which will take place this weekend in our presence and with so many believers as witnesses was perfected on Calvary, when Jesus Christ himself showed through his passion and death, realities also freely accepted, how deeply human love can change the course of history, but especially the course of individual human lives. 
Every sacramental moment brings with it a commitment. It is a moment when God touches our lives through Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ will touch both of you this weekend when you pronounce your vows, Tom, and are ordained a deacon; and when you, Sam, become a Holy Cross priest after the manner ofJesus Christ. I do not know what chis will mean for you. But I know that something wonderful and unexpected will be the result, because God can never be outdone in loving generosity. Someday, and maybe even most days, you will recognize how Jesus Christ has touched you and changed your lives tomorrow and Sunday. 
In view of the problems our Church has experienced recently because fallible human beings carry out the mission of Jesus in time, one could be tempted to think that to be ordained a priest today is a difficult challenge and concern. 
I don't chink there ever has been or ever will be a better time to accept the grace ofordination and to live one's life as a Holy Cross priest, as you will do Sam within a matter of hours. That is because of the overwhelming sense ofwhat it means to be a Catholic priest, and to dedicate every day to the Church's sacramental ministry. To celebrate Mass, to be an instrument ofreconciliation, to claim as Christ's own, people who are young and old and in between through the baptism, to be a soothing and even healing presence in the face ofsickness and death, to witness the love of two people in marriage and to lay hands on countless others who will be ordained Holy Cross priests after you. How can there ever be a bad time or a difficult moment to accept che call of the Church to do all of chis and so much more? 
Sam and Tom, I know that you will both continue to make a difference in the Church, in our Holy Cross Community and in all the places and among all the peoples we carry our our ministries. For service is at the heart of the Gospel, because Christian life is the bonding of each person with Jesus Christ. It is what transforms servants into friends, friends into disciples, disciples into brothers and sisters in Christ, and brothers and sisters in Christ into fruitful instruments of God's grace for the sake of salvation. As Jesus reminds us, we first learned from him that God is love. We have learned from him that we have been created by God because ofGod's intensely personal and passionate love for each one of us. As a finally professed Holy Cross religious and deacon, Tom, and as a Holy Cross priest, Sam, you will continue to be visible signs of that love by the way you continue to live out your commitments, old and new. 
So, in these moments of joyful anticipation of what \s to come soon, we can only thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your generous and patient response to God's call. As your commitments reinvigorate us and give us even more reasons for crying to be more generous ourselves, our brotherhood is strengthened, our own vocations are renewed, the Congregation of Holy Cross and che Church are enriched, and God's people will be better served starting Sunday after­noon than they are tonight. 
We thank God for your parents and your families, who have shared their faith with you, and brought you to chis 
moment. We thank God for your friends who have challenged and supported you through the years of formation. We thank God for you, Tom. We thank God for you, Sam. We thank God for calling all of us to share, each in our own way, in rhe saving mission of]esus, in which we participate, 
strengthened by the bonds and the vows that unite us as Holy Cross priests, brothers, sisters and temporarily professed seminarians; deepened by the faithful witness that surrounds us; grateful for the Catholic Church which sustains us as our mother, teacher and guide; and above all, eternally grateful to our God whose loving c~ kindness never fails us.

New labor contract to be ratified by owners Thursday 
The Obse:'7/er . SPORTS Thursday, September 5, 2002 
Associated Press 
Baseball owners are expect­ed to ratify a new labor con­tract when they meet in Chicago on Thursday, a stark contrast to their four-month deliberation before approving their agreement in 1996. 
decades," Selig said. 
Nothing has been signed yet, and negotiators for players and owners are drafting a memo­randum of understanding, which they hope to complete by next week. The executive board of the players' associa­tion also must ratify the agree­mimt. 
"It is our intention to ratify before the season is over," union lawyer Michael Weiner said. 
The deal, which expires in December 2006, increases the amount of shared local rev­enue from 20 percent to 34 percent, institutes a luxury tax with fixed thresholds from 2003 to 2006, increases the mrn1mum salary from $200,000 to $300,000 and pro­vides for mandatory random testing for illegal steroids, which will start next season on a survey basis. 
"This agreement will make significant contributions to restoring competitive balance," Selig said. 
The agreement was reached three and one-half hours before the first game that would have been affected by a strike, which would have been baseball's ninth work stoppage since 1972. The last labor deal achieved without a stoppage had been in 1970. 

On Friday, commissioner Bud Selig embraced the new deal, calling it "historical." Six years ago, he refused to pub­licly discuss the agreement for more than two months, then submitted it to owners without any recommendation. 
When teams voted that Nov. 6, they rejected the contract 18-12. Twenty-one days later -after Selig recommended approval -owners ratified the deal in a 26-4 vote, with Cleveland, the Chicago White Sox, Kansas City and Oakland opposed. 
"A long and winding road has come to an end," Selig said that day, speaking at the same Chicago airport hotel where owners are to meet Thursday. 
This time, he immediately acknowledged the tentative agreement, appearing one hour after it was completed at a news conference in New York with union head Donald Fehr. 
"This has been a long, very difficult and winding road spanning over three-plus

Kelly not ready to play football yet 
 Viking still mourning death of pregnant wife 
Associated Press 
EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. 

His thoughts still far from football, Lewis Kelly is not ready to return to the Minnesota Vikings. Kelly is mourning the Aug. 25 death of his pregnant wife, Rakiva, who contracted a rate blood disorder. The offen­sive lineman called coach Mike Tice at 3 a.m. Wednesday to tell him he needed more time before corning back to play. 
"We're very concerned right now with the state of Lewis Kelly's mind," Tice said shortly after visiting Kelly at his home. "We're going to support Lewis in every way we can as an orga­nization. I could not imagine the type of pain he is suffering through right now." 
Kelly, after a week off, prac­ticed with the team Monday and spoke candidly afterward how his Christian faith kept him from killing himself. He was to start at le ft tackle in place of unsigned first-round draft pick Bryant McKinnie. 
"We totally understand," cen­ter Matt Birk said. "We're here for him." 
With their season opener Sunday against Chicago, the Vikings are left thin on the offensive line. Everett Lindsay will start at left tackle, and Corbin Lacina, who's been bat­tling an ankle injury, will be the starting left guard. 
"I was actually surprised he came back as soon as he did," Lacina said. "He's got some things he needs to work through. I don't know what I would do. I couldn't begin to fathom what I would do in that situation." 
With Birk at center, David Dixon at right guard and Chris Liwienski at right tackle, Cory Withrow becomes the top back­up. But the group, which endured the heatstroke death of Korey Stringer at training camp last year, isn't so worried with 
'.'.>..
the depth chart right now. 
"Lewis, he needs to do what he needs to do," Withrow said. "The boys back here are going to do anything for him. Football, it's reallv not a concern of the guys. w·ere more concerned about him." 
The Vikings were granted by the league a two-week roster exemption for Kelly, whose spot will be filled for now by Mike Malano, one of their final cuts on Sunday. 
Kelly. in his third season since being drafted in the seventh round out of South Carolina State in 2000, improved his stock with a solid season in NFL Europe this year. Tice originally wanted Kelly to play right tackle with McKinnie on the other sside but the rookie's holdout is going on six weeks.

SOCCER 



By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Saint Mary's soccer team is already off to a bet­ter start than its 2001 counterpart. 
On Wednesday after­noon, it took the field against another young team. The Anderson Ravens came to South Bend with just a year more experience with their coach. Following the 2000 season the Ravens lost nine players and their coach. That seemed like a prime target for the Belles and first year head coach Chris Pfau. 
The Belles capitalized on the Ravens youth and took home their first win of the season. The 4-0 win came much earlier in the season this year than the Belles first win last year. Saint Mary's was over halfway into its season when it finally defeated Rose Hulman. 
The first half of Wednesday's game looked like it might lead to a dead end. The Saint Mary's defense had held Anderson to only one shot on goal­the only shot the Ravens had all game. 
Belles goalie Maureen MacDonald didn't record a single save because that 

IN BRIEF 
Volleyball 
After a long weekend playing in a tournament, the Belles needed to regain their energy and their strength before beginning confer ence play. But two days just wasn't long enough. 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team had it's first disappointing confer­ence loss of the season on Wednesday night.The Kalamazoo Hornets came into Angela Athletic Facility with a clean MIM record. The Belles had a clean record too. 
But the Hornets finished last sea­son with a fourth place finish in the MIAA. The Belles had finished sev­enth. 
Kalamazoo proved the stronger team once again and took the match in three games (30-14, 30-26, 30­10). 
Saint Mary's made a run in game two, staying with Kalamazoo nearly point to point. But the Hornets final­ly came out on top. 
Without Angie Meyers and 
single shot on goal went wide. 
But the Belles weren't doing much better. At the end of the first half of play the score was 0-0. 
But after that, the Belles offense kicked into action. Four of Saint Mary's 44 shots on goal found their way past Anderson's goalie and into the net. 
Emily Wagoner got scor­ing underway. She scored the first goal for the Belles off of an assist from Jen Concannon. 
Concannon, Saint Mary's leading scorer last season, was not content to have her name go into the stats with only an assist next to it. Just 21 seconds after Wagoner scored her goal. Concannon put one into the goal herself, unassisted. 
Midfielder Stephanie Artnak also added an unassisted goal and, to wrap up the scoring, Wendy Irvin hit a penalty shot in the final minutes of the game to give the final 4-0 score. 
The win brings the Belles record to 1-2 and drops the Ravens record to 1-2. 
Saint Mary's will have a week of rest before it plays again against Taylor University on Tuesday.

Elizabeth Rupright, who led the Belles last season, the Belles strug­gled. Allison Shevik led with six kills, but attack errors hurt her final percentages. Bridget Wakaruk had 16 assists and Michelle Gary led the defensive effort with 10 digs. 
The Belles head to Chicago on Saturday for the University of Chicago Triangular 
Golf 

The Saint Mary's golf team will look to take home it's second all­time conference victory on Saturday. 
The Belles will head to Pine River Country Club where Alma will host the first of four MIAA golf tourna­ments. 
Since the rule change, the stand­ings in this tournament have no effect on final MIAA standings, but it will be a good opporunity for the Belles to see how they match up to the rest of the MIAA conference. Last season the Belles took home a first place finish in the first MIM tournament of the season. 
Under the leadership of Stefanie Simmerman and Julia Adams, Saint Mary's is coming off of a record breaking one-round. 
Hope and Albion will again prove to be tough competition for Saint Mary's and will vie for the first place spot at all four tournaments this season. 
Cross Country 
The Belles will be looking to start the season off on the right foot at the Run for One Invitational this weekend. 
Saint Mary's returns its top run­ner in junior Jackie Bauters, who transfered last season and finished on the second team All-MIAA. Senior Nicole Prezioso and Erin Thayer will also return to give some depth to a Saint Mary's squad that was the first to finish higher than last with its seventh place finish last season.

Hurricanes, Gators set to meet 
. First meeting in 15 years for interstate rivals 
Associated Press 
MIAMI 

After a 15-year wait, the Hurricanes and Gators resume their regular-season rivalry at The Swamp on Saturday with more than a national champi­onship run riding on the out­come. 
There's 
"It's definitely a tough place to play," said Miami quarter­back Ken Dorsey, who, along with Florida's Rex Grossman are among the top Heisman Trophy contenders. "They get into it. It's a place you don't want family members to go." 
Florida hasn't had many problems winning at home, but playing top-ranked teams ­and defending national champi­ons -is a different matter.

Whenever the Gators and 'Canes show up in the same town. there's bound to be a memorable moment. 
This game will be no excep­tion when No. 6 Florida (1-0) challenges No. 1 Miami (1-0} and its 23-game winning streak, which is longest in the nation. 
While numbers seem to be in the Hurricanes' favor, Miami center Brett Romberg already has given the Gators an emo­tional lift. 
"I hear I'm already up on Florida's bulletin board," Romberg said. "I said at the Big East meetings that, "We're going to go up to The Swamp and shut some fans up.' I stand by my words. I'm confident. If you aren't confident, you'll get eaten alive up there. We're going up there to shut some people up." 
Miami has backed up its words with a rare winning record at The Swamp, perhaps the toughest place in the coun­try to play. The Gators are 69-5 at home since 1990. Miami is 11-8 in Gainesville.

If Grossman takes a pound­ing, the Gators won't have a chance. If Grossman has time, he can pick apart the all-new Miami secondary. 
The Hurricanes have been helpless before against the Gators. 
Remember the Flop in '71? Florida's John Reaves needed 345 yards to break Jim Plunkett's NCAA passing record. It was the last game of the season. and the Gators led 45-8 late in the game. Reaves was still 14 yards short of the mark. 
Miami was at the Florida 8­yard line with 1 :20 to go, and the Gators decided to let Miami score. John Hornibrook took the snap, the Gators flopped face down, and the quarterback ran in for a TD. Florida got the ball back, and Reaves threw a 15-yard pass to break the record. 
In 1980, Miami led Florida 28-7 late in the game played at

Room for improvement 
By JOE HETTLER Associate Sports Editor 
Ryan Grant was happy Notre Dame won 22-0 against Maryland on Saturday. He couldn't say the same about his own performance, however. 
"First and foremost we won the game," Grant said. "That was the task that we came there to take care of. We went down there, and we did that job. It was a good win for us as a team to start things off the right way for the season, kind of get us on a little roll. That was really a great point for our squad." 
The sophomore running back carried the ball 23 times for 66 yards against the Terrapins, which is an average of just under 2.9 yards per carry. For Grant, that's just not good enough. 
"On a personal note, I'm not very happy with my perfor­mance, but I understand that it's behind me now and I'm going to just make the best of this week and understand that I can't let that happen again," Grant said. 
For Notre Dame's offense to be effective against the likes of Purdue, Michigan and Michigan State in the next few weeks, its running game must improve.
