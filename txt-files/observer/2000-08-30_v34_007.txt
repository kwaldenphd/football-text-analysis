Zahm, Sorin rectors ease 
into jobs 
Editor's Nole: This is the first of two stories about the new rectors and rectress on Notre Dame's campus. 
By NATE PHILLIPS 
News Writer 
Perhaps even more eager than the first year students to experi­ence the traditions and rigors of Notre Dame are the new "fresh­men" rectors. These rectors have the responsibility of maintaining order in the dorm and helping stu­dents spiritually and emotionally. 
Both Father Tom Bednar of Zahm Hall and Sean Seymore of Sorin Hall have accepted the chal­lenges of this job and enter their first year in their respective posi­tions. 
Unlike many of his colleagues, Seymore is not a Holy Cross priest. He will finish his graduate degree in Chemistry at Notre Dame this May. He attended the University of Tennessee for his undergraduate degree, and received his master's degree from Georgia Tech. 
Sevmore has been the assistant rector of the dorm for two VPars. ­and decided to take the job as rec­tor after the administration approached him concerning the opening. He is uncertain as to how long he is planning on remaining rector, considering he will gradu­ate this year. 
"I am just focused right now on taking Sorin into the 21st centu­ry," he said. "It seems like a nat­ural progression for me [to go

As the Viewpoint Editor, I have the honor, sometimes the pain, of reading all letters sent into Thti Obs1~n'er. These letters vary in content, but g,,nerally focus on the same issues every year. This early in the school year, I usually get an assortment of pre-foot­ball hype letters, dining hall anger and, of course,

received no such letters. 
Editor

Actually, I received one let­ter, with one sentence including an explicative, "For (*****'s sake, fix the sprinklers!" Since no om~ els11 will r.omment on the dysfunctional sprinklers. I will. I know other people are irritat­ed about the sprinkler system, have heard you as I walk to DnRartolo. 'Tm glad the sidewalks am being watered." As a senior, I have realized that the sprinkler systmn will never work correctly. In fact. I have gained an apprnciation for the wet sidewalks. I realize as I make my way to classes that even though I am not fully conscious at 9:30 
a.m. I should b1\ able to strategically maneuver around the grass so as not to get wet. 
Some ptrnplc see the required maneuvering as an annoyance. As a senior, I see it as another tal­ent the University is giving me for later use in lifo. I may not be able to get a job as a history major; but by golly, I will be able to dodge. Dodgeball was fun in elementary school, but dodge-sprinkler is better. When you hear the 
ll.O.T.C. department talking about how large our program is, they aren't kidding; they train the whole student body, indirectly, in army tech­niques. Besides being able to swerve, turn and tumble. the sprinkler system has another bonus -some people get wet. Usually, those caught under the spray on the way to DeBartolo are bicyclists. When the sprinkler rounds the bend, walkers flee quickly, but bicyclists are caught, unable to move, in the spray. Now, I like bicycles, however since I don't ride one around campus, they can bt' a bit irritating. How many people have you seen run over by people on wheels? N1md I say more? I imagine if you really wanted thn extra IO minutes to sleep in the morning, you could also skip your shower and refresh yourself on the way to class. This is something, I wouldn't do or recommend, but some really lazy guys might. 
Onto other topics missing l'rom the Viewpoint pagP. South Dining Hall is confusing and it has been taking freshmen awhile to get the hang of things. Some advice: ask an upperclassman if you have doubts and never stop moving in the middle of the isles. North is less confusing but can seem overly safe. There is a direction at the food stations; usually this is indicated by the posi­tion of the platr.s. Also, you don't have to wait in line for soup. General notes to all, do not nibble directly out of the cereal bins. it is just plain gross. Some personal advice for freshmen, if a large football player is walk(ng towards you in the dining hall and there is a chance of collision, make sum you move first. Generally they are big and really don't have anywhere to go in the nar­row isles. 
Football! Good luck to the players, we will sup­port all of you and we are all looking forward to the first game.

On Tunsday, U.N. officials said pro-Indonesian militiaman and pnarekPepPrs exchanged gunfin' near East Timor's lrou­blf'd border.

army uniforms and weapons. 
But Indonesia's U.N. Ambassador, Markarim Wibisono. rejer,ted suggestions that the mere presence of army uniforms among militia members implied army involvement, noting "such material can be easily acquired on the black market." 
While r,ondemning the recent attacks on U.N. personnel. Wibisono stressed that 
But several Security Council members said Indonesia was responsible for curbing the source of the violence -the militias who operate across the border in West Timor. 
The spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees er,hoed that senti­ment Tuesday in Geneva. A "just and lasting solution to the refugee problem" depends on law and order being imposed in West Timor's sprawling refugee camps, said spokesman Kris Janowski.

PHILIPPINES 
Rebels threaten to kill U.S. hostage 
Associated Press 
ZAMBOANGA 

'.\1uslim rebels in tho Philippines threatened Tuesday to kill an American man th<>y have kidnapped unless the United States,accepts their demands. 
Jeffrey Craig Edwards Sr.hilling, of Oakland, Calif., was seized Monday by a faction of' the Abu Sayyaf rebel group, ·which this week released six other Western hostages in return for a rnportcd $Ci million ransom but was still holding 18 other captives. 
In a radio interview. rebel 
spokesman Abu Sabaya said the rebels would "not hesitate to execute this American guy if the Philippine government and the U.S. will not lis­ten to our demands." 
Sabaya said the specific demands would be announced in three days. 
"We demand for our principles, we demand for our religion, we demand for our ideology," he told the Radio Mindanao Network. 
"We have been trying very hard to get an American because the Americans may think we are afraid of them," he said when asked if they had abducted Schilling to prevent a military operation against Ab.u 
Sayyaf. 
Chief government hostage negotia tor Robert Aventajado confirmed Schilling had been kidnapped. saying an envoy had seen him in an Abu Sayyaf camp on southern .lolo island. 
Sabaya said Schilling had contacted Abu Sayyaf rebels in Zamboanga and identified himself as a Muslim con­vert who was interested in visiting the camp of the rebels, who are fight­ing for an Islamic state in the south­ern Philippines. 
The rebels suspected he was a CIA agent when they discovered he knew little about Islam and decided to abduct him to Jolo, Sabaya said. 

SOUTH KOREA 
Korean leaders strive for peace 
Associated Press 
SEOUL 

A five-member govern­ment delegation from South Koma traveled to North Korea on Tuesday for three days of high-level talks on P.asing tensions between the two countries. Seoul officials said. 
The talks, the second since late last month, aim to follow up on an accord reached at a historic summit in .lunP, whl'n loaders of the two Koreas pledged to work together to promote peace and eventual reunification. 
Thn unprecedentnd sum­mit between the two Koreas provided the best hope yet for peace on the divided peninsula, the world's last Cold War frontier. 
"We have taken a great first step forward ... but we still have a long way to go to 

achieve national reconcilia­
tion. co-prosperity. peace 
and unification," South 
Korean Unification Minister 
Park Jae-kyu said in a state­
ment issued in Pyongyang, 
the l\orth's capital. A copy 
of Park's statement was 
released in Seoul. 
Park, ar.companied by 20 
assistants and 10 reporters, 
arrived in Pyongyang 
aboard a chartered com­
mercial plane after a 50­,minute flight Tuesday. 
During a dinner hosted by North Korean Prime Minister Hong Sung Nam, Park made a speech calling for more reunions of fami­lies separated by the 1950­53 Korean War. The two Koreas sent 100 separated family members to each other's capitals for four-day temporary reunions in mid­August. 
South Korean ollicials said 
key discussion points in the 
talks include opening a mili­
tary hot line, a detailed 
schodule to reconnect a rail­
way across the heavily 
armed border and the first­
ever meeting between the

sides.

The Seoul government also says North Korea abducted 3,756 South Koreans after the war ended. All but 454 of them -mostly fishermen -were sent back to the South. Pyongyang denies the alle­gation, calling it a smear campaign. 
In another sign of thawing relations, a South Korean fishing boat that drifted into North Korean waters with navigational problems was returned Tuesday. In the past, many South Korean ships that crossed the bor­der could not come back, with the North holding them and their crews on spying charges.

In Zumarraga itself, at a special town meeting cal!Pd to condemn the killing, one of three councilors who belong to the pro-ETJ\ party Euskal Herritarrok tried to read a communique but was drowned out by shouts of "murderers." 
While security force mem­bers have long been ETA's main target, in recent years the organization has begun killing more politicians, par­ticularly those or Prime Minister Jose Maria J\znar's Popular Party.

"The time for generalities with­out specifics I think is just about over," said Gore. "It's kind or put up or shut up time." 
Speaking w i t h reporters on his cam­paign air­plane, Bush was scorn­

"H's not very prcsi-

The Democratic National Committee backed up Gore with a new ad on prescription drugs for Mtidicare. "Bush has no spe­

"Let's not play games with this. Let's put tho facts on the table,'' Gore said, then underscornd his point with details ol' his plan. 
His $100 billion, 10-year chil­dren's health proposal is an expansion of an existing program o!Tering coverage to children of the working poor. 
Gore would cover children in families making up to 250 per· cent of the federal poverty level. He said that would ofTer coverage to the 11 million uninsured chil­dren by 2005. 
"We need to cover every child in the next prPsidcntlal term," said Gore. "Every child ought to have good, high quality health care." 
Gore argued he's flying solo in the health care debate, becaus1~ Bush is ducking on offering 
specifics for child and senior health care. 
"l encour­age our opponents to enter that debate also with a spe cific plan," said Gore. "I

Gore on Monday touted his plan to add a prescriplion drug question is what will he do for the children? What does Governor Bush intend to do about tlrn 11 mil­lion uninsured children in t.lrn country, 1.4 mil­lion or whom livr, in Texas?"

SACRAMENTO. Calif. 

Calif'orni.a, the Wild West of political giving and spending, and two other st.ates will offer votflrs the chancP in November to ovr,rhaul thr,ir campaign finance laws. 
California's ballot proposal would limit political donations. whilr\ initiativos in Missouri and Oregon wuuld finance campaigns with taxpayer money. 
The measures in Oregon and Missouri would put those 
staks in the foro­l'ront of' thc1 campaign­finance rPform movement. California, on the

kinds of donation caps that 44 states alrnadv have. 
In Calil'or.nia. individuals, corporations and other special interests can donate as murh as thev want. 
Dcrriocratic Gov. Grav Davis has r,xploitf1d that system like no onr before him, shattering rncords by collecting more than $21 million for his re­election two years from now. {By comparison. Al Gore has raised $38 million in the same p11riod for his Democratir. pres­

Political parties could give unlimited amounts to candi· dates but collect no more than $25,000 a year from any one donor to support or oppose specific candidates. "Soft money" donations not target­ing a candidafo would be unlimited.

prompted an outpouring of criticism from government watchdog groups, who say it is so riddled with holes it would be worse than the current system. 
"In most states that would be a step backward," said Nick Nvhart. executive director of P~1blic Campaign, a Washington-based group. 
The measure's donation lim­its would be among the highest in the nation. said Tony Miller, who is leading the campaign against Proposition 34. California's campaigns are also among the most expensive to mount, because the state is so big and has so many television markets. 
Proposition 34 would make it

harder tn track who is seeking to buy influence, Miller said. Instead of giving directly to a 
c,mdidate, a special interest could give to a party, which could then channel the money to the politician. 
"It's really money-launder­ing, is what it is," Miller said. 
Among Miller's other objec­tions It would permit special interests to "bundle" contribu­tions from their employees to increase their impact, and it would supersede far more stringent restrictions approved by voters four years ago, now moving through the courts. 
Republicans, too, take a dim view of the proposal. 
It exempts statewide office­holders -of whom all but one are Democrats -from the donation caps until after the 2002 election, leaving Davis unaffected by its provisions. 
And it defines oach union local as a separate entity, rather than belonging to one statewide or larger organiza­tion. So countlPss union groups could donate the maximum. Unions generally support Democrats. 
"The worst part of the plan is the transparency of giving Gray Davis the right to contin­ue pillaging donors for the next two vears," said Shawn Steel, vice chairman of the California Republican Party. "A plan crafted by Democrats, support­ed bv Democrats and designed specifically to help Davis can­not be good for the people." 
The measure was placed on the ballot by the Legislature and Davis, who complained that he had been blindsided by it. Burton moved it through the Legislature with no public hearings.

GUEST COLUMN 
Tuning in on the 
Republican 
Convention 
CltATTANOOGA, Tenn. 
"They have had their chance. They have not led. We will." That was the theme of Governor George W. Bush ·s accep­tance speech at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. He also commented "so much promise to no great purpose," referring to the Clinton-Gore administration and their lack of leadership over the lasl eight years. Catherine 
This administration has presided 
Middleton 

over one of the gnmtest economic booms in our country's history, yet there arn so many things they haven't The University accomplished. Social Security is still Echo bankrupt, our health care crisis con­tinues, and just last month Clinton vetoed the removal oft.he "marriage-tax penalty." (For those of you unfamiliar with this phenomenon, married couples filing jointly pay a higher tax than if they were single and filed separately. It basically punishes you for getting mar­ried.) 
Many people expected Bush to attack Clinton. but I thought the speech was rather mild. He made the expected references to a lack of character in the White House, as did vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney, but they were rather veiled. Primarily, Bush took the opportunity to introduce himself to voters. 
Ile described his childhood, his marriage to Laura, their children, etc. He also laid out goals for his administration which included increased pay for members of the armed 14.irces (the number of armed services members who receive food stamps is staggering), giving private insurance tax credits for lower-income people and reducing the tax rate from 15 percent to 10 percent on the lower-income brack­ets. 
From the very beginning of the convention, there were comments about the radal makeup of the convention dele­gatr.s, participants and speakers. The Republican Party is not known for its diversity. but that is beginning to change. Locally, an African-American man, Johnny Horne, is the Republican nominee against Democrat Brenda Turner for State Jfopresentative. The national convention attempted to rcf1ect the increasing role o!' minority groups in the Hepublican Party. 
They say in politics that no matter what you do, you'll manage to offend someone, and that was definitely the case at the convention. Republicans are called the party of "old, rich white guys," and sometimes that seems to be true. The average delegate was a 47-year-old white male. However, the youngest delegate was 19 and there were more minority delegates than ever before. 
This is not to say that we're getting the support of the NAACP just yet (although after the anti-Semitic comments by the chairman of the Dallas, Texas NAACP about Democratic VP candidate Joseph Lieberman, I'm not sure I'd want their support). 
The nepublicans were accused of "trotting out the token minority" by having former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Colin Powell {widely discussed as possible Secretary of State in a Bush Administration) as headline speaker the first night of the convention. In my opinion, this was an unfair comment. 
There were several minority speakers, including Congressman J.C. Watts, an African-American minister from the Philadelphia area and an openly gay congressman. The speaker I was most impressed with, however, was Condoleezza Rice. She spoke before Sen. John McCain on Tuesday night. 
Although she is unknown to many voters, she is an expert on Hussian politics and is George W. Bush's foreign policy advisor. ShP is expected to be named as National Security Advisor and to the best of my knowledge, would be the first African-American woman to hold that post. 
The Democratic National Convention was two weeks ago in Los Angeles. where the party nominated Joe Lieberman as its vice-prPsid,mtial candidate. Al Gore receivPd a large bounce in the polls after the Convention, making it a statisti­cal dead heat according to the latest poll numbers. Labor Day weekend is traditionally the beginning of the final strntch to the Presidency, and it appears to be getting inter­esting. Stay tuned ...

CSJ (of

Dead 
World

Man Walking book/movie fame) concluded her powerful talk after receiving the Laetare Medal with the words, "May you he blessed with passion and may you follow it all your life." She returned to Notre Dame and DeBartolo a few months ago to a standing room only crowd and amrmed the importance of passion and our call to our com­munity-based mission of "loving tenderly, acting justly and walking humbly with God" (Micah 6). 
During the past 12 days, I have experienced events which are energizing and encouraging for me as executive director of the Center for Social Concerns. In the next few days, I anticipate an ini­tiative which is very challenging. This spring we at the CSC worked hard as a staff and with students, faculty, alumni and other con­stituents to revise our mission statement as part of a compre­hensive strategic planning process. I am grateful to share these brief and personal reflec­tions on how our mission is more than words and is being lived out passionately by many in our com­munity as I write to you. 
Our mission statement is as fol­lows: Rooted in the Gospel and Catholic social tradition, the Center for Social Concerns of the University of Notre Dame creates formative educational and service experiences in collaboration with diverse partners, calling us all to action for a more just and humane world. 
This past Saturday morning, I celebrated with the more than 200 students and collaborators who participated in Summer Service Projects, discussing the way their passions were engaged during the eight weeks nationally and internationally in service­leo.rning. With readings, journals and written reflections over the summer, they discovered how their "formative eductional and service experiences" were "rooted in the Gospel and Catholic social tradition." A few days before in our Theology seminar with SSP returnees, I relished the way stu­dents responded to the video of Sr. Helen Prejean's talk and relat­ed it to the passions and collabo­ration of "many diverse partners" who made their service experi­ences possible. 
On Thursday afternoon, August 24th, over 100 First Year students gathered in our Center Multipurpose Room with their professors for a new course 
initiative. They will be able to incorporate comm unity-based learning opportuni­ties in the South Bend community into their First Year Composition writing course because of the collaboration of four groups: Oflice of First Year of Studies, First Year Writing Program, agencies in the South Bend area, and our own Center. I was especially pleased to share the enthusiasm of two First Year stu­dents in McGlinn Hall who expressed their appre­ciation for the opportu­nity and for the passion of their profes­sors for this challenge. 
I am also anticipating my joy at Activities Night to see many options in the area of social concerns and ser­vice in the midst of other invitations for you students to share your gifts with the Hall, campus and off­Neighborhood, which has includ­ed "many diverse partners," on and off campus. The CSC has wel­comed the initiative to be deeply involved in this effort to have out the best of our ND mission to be collaborative and sensitive to our "neighbors." 
This past Sunday, August 27th, 

I participated in a special 
Eucharistic Celebration in the African-American parish of St. Agatha in North Lawndale (Chicago). Fr. Mike Ivers, who was a dynamic speaker at the conference last February, "Reconciliation and Renewal in the Cities: Faith-Based Initiatives," was leaving the vibrant parish community after 12 years of shared ministry. In his homily, he asked those of us 
with Notre Dame connections to stand. As I looked at our current Notre Dame African-American students, other students and alumni who learned so much from Mike and the "diverse part­ners of St. Agatha," I was moved to tears with gratitude. 
Many Notre Dame alumni of St. Agatha had trans­
formative experi­ences and will con­tinue to on SSPs and 
Urban Plunges. 
Thanks for your interest. We of the CSC welcome your 
 
ideas, suggestions, passions and sharing in our mission.

campus possibilities. It is encouraging that all received by mail the listings of the multiple Social Concerns Seminar offerings during breaks which often complement other CSC programs in "calling us all to action for a more just and humane world." 
I am grateful that a press con­ference on Thursday will clarify a new program, called New Initiative in the Northeast

OLYMPICS 

Track twins look for combined win 
Associated Press 
HRISBANE 
They think, talk, act and run alike -and they're making his­tory together. 
They're the IIarrison brothers -Alvin and Calvin -the first twins tu make a U.S Olympic track team. 
"We've already made history by being the first twins on the tnam. now we want to add to it." Alvin said. 
They will get that oppnrtunily at Sydnny. hoping to run in the 1.bO0-meter relay final, win gold medals and break the world record. 
Alvin is virtually assured a place on the relay team. after finishing second to Michael Johnson in the 400 meters at the Olympic trials in Sacramento, Calif., last month. Calvin was fifth at the trials and he is con­tirnding with his brother, plus Johnson, third-place finisher Antonio Pettigrew and fourth­place finisher Jerome Young for a spot in the final. 
Even if the brothers don't run in the final. they would still earn gold medals if they run in pre­liminary rounds on the way to a 
U.S. victory. 
Alvin already has an Olympic gold. l le ran the second leg on the winning 1996 team that included Lamont Smith, Derek Mills and Anthuan Maybank and was timed in 2 minutes, 55. 99 seconds, the fourth-fastest in history. 
Alvin finished third at the '96 trials and fourth in the Olympic 400-meter final, while Calvin was eliminated in the semifinals at the trials. 
The relay gold still left Alvin 

..We've already made history by being the first twins on the team, now we want to add to it. ,, 
Alvin Harrison Olympic track team member 
with an empty feeling. 
"I couldn't get into my race," he said. "Virtually everything r do. I do with my brother. 
"Now, we foe! whole." 
Calvin agreed, of course. 
"We're complete," he said. "This is rndemphon." 
To consider where the identi­cal twins are now and where they were five years ago is remarkable. 
In 1995, they were homelPss and lived in a Ford Mustang coupe for about three munths. At the time. Alvin resided in Orlando. Fla.. with his father and Calvin was living in Salinas: Calif., where the brothers went to high school 
Alvin had just completed working at an assembly line plant Calvin visited him in his car. Their father wanted them to remain in Florida, hut the twins decided to head back to California. That's when the car living began. 
"That wasn't such a bad situa­tion," Calvin said. "Not as bad as people think." 
"It made our bond stronger ber,ause we seemed to be drift­ing apart then," Alvin said. "We realized we needed ear,h other for what we had planned. We realized that the assembly line wasn't for us. Living in the Mustang was an obstade we had

to overcome. Everyone has to go through hardships and we had ours." 
Now. the twins earn their liv­ing through track and are in much better finandal condition. 
"We're living a lot better than in the car." Alvin said. 
Calvin has a son, JarUah. 4, and Alvin has two childnm -a son. Shrace, 2. and a daughter, Shivah. 6. ­
fhe 26-year-olds resemble each other very closely. Calvin can be distinguished by his longer goatee and earrings shaped like the letter "C." 
U.S. coach John Chaplin had trouble telling them apart at first, introducing them bv their wrong names. The brothers still tease him. 
"When he calls one of our names, the other answers," Alvin said. 
"If one wins and the other goes to the podium, you'd never know the difference," Chaplin said. 
While the twins wuld fool a lot of people by changing places, they have done it only once. That was in their senior year at Salinas High, where Calvin went to Alvin's English class and Alvin attended Calvin's science class. 
This is the second time the brothers have been on an international team together. In 1993, Alvin ran the second leg and Calvin anchored the U.S. team that won the 1,600 relay at the World Championships. 
The Olympics are much more special. 
"This is the pinnacle of any­thing we've achieved so far," Alvin said. "Calvin and I are what the Olympic Games are all about -unity and brother­hood." 
MAJOR LEAGUE BAEBALL 
Blue Jays, Rangers look to Puerto Rico 
Associated Press 

NEW YOHK 
After season openers in Mexico and Japan, baseball is discussing starting next year in Puerto Rico. 
The Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers are likely to open the 2001 regular sea­son in San Juan on Sunday night, April 1, several base­ball officials said Tuesday. 
"I would say it's in the dis­c ussion-of-d etails stage," 8,lue Jays general manager bord Ash said. "There's a willingness to participate. It's just a matter of getting 
·the details done." 

Toronto would be the home team in the game at Hiram Rithorn Stadium, Ash said, and the teams would play an exhibition game in Puerto 
Rico  the  previous day.  A  
decision  on  the  trip  is  
expected in a few weeks.  

ESPN could televise thn game as part of its Sundav night package. Network spokeswoman Diane Lamb said ESPN wouldn't comment until after baseball makes an official announcement. 
It would be the third straight international opener for baseball, which started the 1999 season at Monterrey, Mexico, with a 
game between San Diego and Colorado, and opened this season in Tokyo with a two­ga me series between the New York Mets and Chica.go Cubs. 
Hangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez, the 1999 American League MVP, would be the top attraction for the game. Hodriguez, who is out for the season with a broken right thumb, was born in Vega Raja, Puerto Ric:o, and lives in Rios Pedros. 
Texas infielder Luis Alkca was born in Santurce and lives in Florida. 
Toronto first baseman Carlos Delgado is from Aguadilla, Puerto Hirn. While he agreed last December to a $36 million, three-y<1ar con­tract extension, he has the right, in the 10 days after the World Series, to demand that Toronto trade him by Feb. 15. 
Last year. ba.sr,ball dis­cussed moving a three-game series between the Hangers and the Chica.go White Sox this May 10-12 to Puerto Hico. but nothing became of those talks. 
News of these negotiations originally was reported earli­er this week by The Globe and Ma.ii in Toronto.

U.S. OPEN 
Willams begins title defense with straight sets win 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

Nevnr shy. Serena Williams arriVfid in defense of her U.S. Open title resplendent in tic­dyed lilar, and blar,k, and flash­ing a pert smile that bespoke the ronfidenr.e or r,hampion. 
The r,rowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium was still buzzing from the dismissal of French Open rhamp Gustavo Kuerten, the men ·s No. 2 seed, who fell vir.tim to lanky Australian qualifier Wayn0 Arthurs· 26 ar,es in a 4-6. fl-3. 7-6 (4l. 7-6 (1) defoat. 
If' the fans thought that upset would be a prelude to another, Williams qukkly set out to dis­abuse them of that notion and any thought that her rec1:mt heel injury might hinder her. 
First she made her r.olor-coor­dinated fashion statem~mt, slow­ly perding off her lilac jacket to reveal a sh0er. flowing dress that perfoctly matr.hed hor lilac sneakers. 
"It shows how good I look. how in shape I am." Williams said with a laugh. 
Then shP made a tnnnis state­nrnnt, ripping a return winner on the first point as slrn pror,eed­ed to r,rush l 9-year-old Slovenian Tina Pisnik 6-3. G-2. 
In beginning hPr quest to 
reach the final along with her at love in the fourth game, and older sister Venus, 18-year-old once again in the second set, Serena did not display her finest ~ when Pisnik broke her at 15-40 tennis. even if it was enough to with a backhand at the net. overwhelm a player of Pisnik's But those lapses were perhaps modest ability. to be expected after Williams 
"I was not the usual Serena," missed a week to allow an she said. "It inflamed

There were Limes when Once in a while, Arthurs, a Williams soared spectacularly on left-banded Australian, gets into overheads and lunging volleys, a serving groove and seems and times when she walloped unbeatable. It happened at serves at 111 mph to rack up Wimbledon last year when he four aces and six service win­held serve for 111 consecutive ners. But there were also times games through three rounds of when she found herself out of qualifying and three matches of position, when her lilac shoes the tournament before falling in got tangled up, when Pisnik four sets to eventual finalist made her look quite ordinary. Andre Agassi. 
That happened once in the This time, after a solitary first set, when Pisnik broke her break by each player in the first two sets, Arthurs and Kuerten held serve the rest of the way and let the tiebreakers decide matters. ln those. Arthurs proved dominant and he ended the affair with a 1 34 mph ace up the middle. 
Despite the urging and cries of "Guga" from Kuerten's fans, the bearded Brazilian failed to impress his gamP. on Arthurs, who first began winning the bat­tle from the baseline, then took charge of the match at the net. 
Time and again, Arthurs. best known as a doubles player, would chip Kucrten's second serve and charge the net, ready to knock off a feeble attempt at a passing shot. On his own service games, Arthurs would keep Kuerten on the defensive with his blistering serves. 
Arthurs rea~hed double match point on Kuerten's serve in the ninth game of the fourth set. Kuerten Sflrved an ace to save the first one. Ile thought he had his second straight ace on the next serve, but it was called wide. 
It made no difference. Kuerten won the next three points and held for 5-5. Two games later, they moved into a second straight tiebreaker, which Arthurs dominated, racing out to 6-0 lead. 
Kuerten won the next point, but the hole he was in was much too deep. Arthurs then pounded his final ace to complete the upset. 

Told that Kuerten was one of the favorites to win this tourna­ment, Arthurs replied, "Not any mon~." 
Kuerten became only the sec­ond No. 2 seed to lose in the first round of the U.S. Open since 1956, when the present system of seedings started. The only other time it happened was in 1994 when second-seeded Goran Ivanis1wic was ousted in his opener, Ivanisevic lost anoth­er first-round match on Tuesday. 
Kuerten was the second seed­ed player to tumble from the tournament on the second day. Earlier, No, 16 Julie Halard­Der.ugis fell to Miriam Oremans 6-3. 6-4. 
Lindsay Davenport, the 1998 women's champion, romped past Gala Leon Garcia of Spain 6-0. 6-1 in 44 minutes. 
In the fourth game of the sec­ond set, Leon Garcia, who prefers to play on clay rather than the hardcourts of' the National Tennis Center, whipped a winning forehand into the cor­ner and raised her arms in tri­umph. Two points later. she had won her first -and only ­game, breaking Davenport at 15.

PITTSl3UIHil I 
Bill Cowher isn ·t saying much about what benched quartPrback Kordell Stewart's role will be in the Pittsburgh Stfrn!cirs' oppnr.r Sunday against Baltimorn. 
By not saying anything, Cowher might br. saying a lo( 
Cowher tiptoed around questions Tuesday whP-thcr Sir.wart might reprisr his for­mer role of Slash now that Kent Graham has beaten him out at quarterback. 
"You don't want to rlabo­rate, obviously. for competitive reasons," Cowher said. "They have different styles. and I plan on using those styles." 
It is just as obvious tlrn Steelers don't want Stewart. one of their highest-paid play­ers, to waste away on the bench. So, just as he did while backing up Neil O'Donnell in 1995 and 1996, Stewart just might show up at wide receiv­er. Or running back. 
Or, maybe even at quarter­back, to run a series here or there, or in a long yardage sit­uation in which his scrambling ability would give offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride another option or two. 
By returning Stewart to his 
Slash rolP, a tnam that was offensively ddk.it:nt in the! prn­snason potrntial!y !'.ould rPViVP what was an cf'frrtiv0 weapon in 199:i and 1996. 
In those sr.asons. StPwart produced 11 touchdowns despitn touching tlw ball just :~7 timns as a passnr. :,4 tinws as a rusher and ;31 timns as a rncrivl'r. 
The only dif'l'nrr.nct' bctwr,rn tlrnn and now is that Strwart had ncv0r bnon an NFL start­ing quarterback and he con­sidr.red his Slash rolr. as men~­ly part of his apprenticeship. Now that he has started, it may bi! difficult !'or him to return to thr rolr, with much enthusiasm or any hope that it might again Ir.ad to him start­ing. 
"No. that isn't my focus right now." Stewart said. "I have to study film of thn opponent as if I were thr starting quarter­back, as opposed to going out there and trying to please peo­ple and make them cherr and make them happy by playing wide receiver." 
Cheering isn't something that Stewart has heard much of the last two srasons in Three Hivers Stadium, where a fan once threw a beer on him and thP. booing began this summer with the first series of the first preseason game.

I suppose it's just as ,vdl Notrn Damn foot­ball !"ans k<wp indulging in that wonderful sµring and sumnwr 
pastinw: spPculating about the job status ol' Bob OiLvic. 
When disrussing this topi1·. PVPry supporlPr of thP Irish sn<'ms to havP a standard that l)avir must nrnPt to k""P his job. There an' g(nnrally two schools of thought. 
First, th<'rl' is option A: "S-7'? ,\n! you kidding nm" II' hn doesn't go to a BCS Bowl lw should bP canned!'' 
And tlwn Llwr<' is tlw slightly IPss dPnHtncling option B: "S-7'? ,\rP you kidding nw? II" lw doesn't go at lnast 8-:~ lw should be nrnned 1"

In his prPsPason issue, PristPr writes " ... thN<' should b(! enough experi1mcn, talent. and pridf>. on this tmtm to finish at least 8-3. Anything less than that is a crimc ... if lthn coaches; don't lead this team to a New Year's Day bowl, the school has an obligation to lind the right coaching combination." 
A crimP-? I can't say I disagrer>. 
But will athlctir director Kevin White see it that way? All thes11 opinions on what Oavi<' nrnds to stay could differ f'rom what hH actuallv nePds to do in the cves of White. Is there any way i-4 could be enough? Consider th1)s11 scenarios: 
Notrn Dame loses to N1\braska, Purdue. West Virginia. and USC All are close losses. Nebraska looks primed for a national titl1). Purdue has a IIcisman trophy candidatP at quartflrback.
