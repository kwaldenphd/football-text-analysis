Clinton honors Hesburgh with Congressional Gold Medal 
By LAURA SELLINGER 
News Writer 
President Clinton signed legislation on Dec. 9, 1999 to award University president emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh the nation's highest honor bestowed upon civil­ians, the Congressional Gold Medal. 
Now Public Law 106­153, the Father Theodore Hesburgh Congressional Gold Medal Act authorizes the President to give the medal to Hesburgh in recognition for his many outstanding contribu­tions to civil rights, high­er education, the Catholic Church and the nation. 


Hesburgh 

Congressman Tim Roemer introduced legislation in the House of Representatives last May and sought the support of his 292 colleagues to cosponsor the legislation. 
"The Congressional Gold Medal honors Americans accomplished in one area -but Fater Hesburgh has three fields of integrity and honor. He has made outstanding con­tributions in the fields of religion, higher education and civil rights -that is what 
caused me to push this award," Roemer said. 
"I believe that this is the most appropri­ate time for Congress and tho entire nation to join me in recognizing this remarkabl11 man and living legend of freedom in AmArica," RoAmer said. 
Hoerner said that he considers Hesburgh's public service career tu be as distinguished as his many contributions to education. Hesburgh served as Notre Dame's president froml 952-1987. Holding 15 presidential appointments, Hesburgh's involvement ranged far and wide. 
He was a charter member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights from its establishment in 1957 and chaired the commission from 1969 to 1972. He was also awarded the Medal of Freedom by Lyndon Johnson in 1964, another one of the nation's highest civilian honors. 
During the 1980s, Hosburgh was also actively involved in a private initiative to unite international scientists and religious leaders in condemning nuclear weapons. Hesburgh also helped organize a meeting of 58 world-class scientists in Vatican City in 1982. This meeting not only called for the elimination of nuclear weapons, but it also brought together leaders of six faiths

Snite displays colorful Cuban art exhibition 
. On-campus museum welcomes art influenced by life on the island nation.

News Writer 
The sound ol' Cuban music may come as a surprise to someone ente. ring the normal­ly quiet Snite Museum. 
llowever, the upbeat music 
provides an appropriatf1 accompaniment to the vibrant colors of many of the paintings within the gallery. 
The music and paintings are part or an exhibit at The Snitc entitled 
"Breaking 
BarriPrs: Selections from Cuban artists exiled from their native country due to the atrocities of Fidel Castro's Communist rule. The govern­ment suppresses individual f'rcedoms and punishes dissen­sion. and official artists are restricted in what they can create. 
"There are a lot of images of despair," Costa said. adding many of the artists attempt to deal with "being Cuban but not being able to live in Cuba." 
Some of the artists left Cuba as children, while others fled as adults. Most of the 55 
"The works deal with contemporary issues ... and at the same time deal with issues ofartists who have fled." 
Gina Costa Marketing and Public Affairs Specialist, Snite Museum 
the Museum of Art Jiort Lauderdale Contemporary Cuban CulltH'.tion." 
''The images am all very large, lots of bright colors." said Gina Costa. public rela­tions and marketing specialist at the Snitc. 
The exhibition celebrates 
artists fea­tured are now living in Europe and the 
u . s .. 
including many in southern Florida. 
There is a great deal of variety in the collec­tion, which 

contains paintings, sculptures, photography, video and instal­1ation. Not all of the work reflects a significant Cuban influence. 
"The works deal with con­temporary issues ... and at the same lime deal with issues of' artists who have fled," Costa said. 

The Snitc arranged the work based on themes. For exam­ple, one gallery focuses on humor. including a piece that contains parts of a broken Kentucky Fried Chicken sign. Other galleries focus on more serious issues such as religion and life in Cuba. 
Artist Glexis Novoa came to The Snite for its opening and drew on the wall in one of the galleries. 
American-born photograph­er Andres Serrano, who is also featured in the exhibit, earned fame in tho U.S. when his con­trnversial "Piss Christ" raised questions about his funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. 
As its title suggests, tho exhibit is intended to break barriers by not limiting the artists who are included. Two artists in the exhibit, Serrano and Coco Fusco, are second­generation Cubans not born on the island. Two photographers featured. Juan Carlos Alom

lete in her own right. 
But then last September. she startt'd getting really associate tired. She would come sports editor home from si:hool and field hockey practice completely exhausted and complaining of being cold. At first we thought nothing of it. It was her first year in high school and she probably just wasn't used to the tougher practices. But Moog didn't get better. She was still cold and tired no matter how much rest slrn got. 
So mv mother took her to the doctor The diagnosis wasn't good. My sister had an immune system disease known as lupus. Her body was attacking itself Unable lo distin­guish between the threatening particles and her own cells, her immune system was destroying her blood cells and causing her anemia. 
The doctors were amazed that she was able to even play field hockey. let alone start and be among the scoring leaders on her team. When field hockey season ended, she exchanged her cleats for a pair of' sneakers and became the point guard for her basketball team without missing a beat. 
Every day. Moog went to school and practke and then came home and slept for hours. One minute she would be hustling up and down Lhe basketball court, the next she would bare­ly havP enough energy to walk to the i:ar with­out help. 
Week after werk she went to doctor after doctor and specialist after specialist who all seemed to say different things. 
But Moog never complained. She never questioned why the disease chose lwr. Without a complaint. she took her pills and submitted to numerous tests and blood draws by inept nurses. some vvho couldn't even find a vein. 
l' d like to say she got her toughness from my brother and I, but I know she really got it from my morn. Throughout this whole ordeal, my mom has fought to make sure my sister gets the best treatment possible. 
From battling New York traffic to get my sis­ter to sper,ialists in the city to arguing with school administrators who refuse to resched­ule tests so my sister can go to the doctor. this disease has been just as tough on my mother as it bas been on mv sister. 
But the light at the end of the tunnel may be in sight. The right mixtures of drugs may have finally been found and the worst could be over. 
Some people say professional athletes are tough, but I know they have nothing on my mom or my sister.

Three peopll\ -none of them students -were detained for fighting on Sheridan Hoad outside the Technological Institute as protests against white supremacist Matt llale turned violent Friday, said Al Cubbage. vice prnsident for university relations. Police escorted llale from Tech "for his own safety" at 2:20 
p.m. af'ter the leader of the World Churi:h of the Creator announced he had nine or 10 signatures from NU stu­dents in a petition for official university religious recog­nition. About 200 students, faculty and community members rallied at Tech to voice their opposition to Hale's racist message. Cubbage also said there is no proof that Hale has a student contact at NC. Hale told The Daily on Wednesday a male Northwestern student may publicly announce himself as I I ale's host sometime before his visit. Ilale received a bloody lip in the si:u!Tic and was escorted to an unmarked police car after appearing for about 20 minutes. The leader of the racist organization did not set foot on campus, but stood on the strip or grass between Sheridan Hoad and the sidewalk in front of Tech.

Bill could ban opposite sex visitors 
TUCSON; Ariz. 
Under a bill proposed this week by HPp. Jpan McGrath, H-Glendalo, students living in University ol' Arizona residence halls would not be allowed to havP guests of the opposite sox in their rooms. except for immediate family. She said when she was a student at Arizona State University in the late 1950s, students had "lots of' places to meet" outside of' their dorm rooms, which she described as "bedrooms." She also said dorm rooms underwent a "white glove" inspection each week. but now, no one cares how students main­tain the state's property. This is the fourth bill McGrath bas submitted for this term of the Arizona State Legislature to regulate universities. The other propos­als would require Arizona universities to install or sub­scr~be to Internet filters on all campus i:omputnrs. allow students to use campus Internet connnctions only for a "specifii: educational purpose," and requirP "acr,urate and complete" course descriptions in univer­sity syllabi and catalogs. McGrath said the bill regard­ing i:ourse descriptions is going to be replaced with a bill by another representative.

llesburgh stepped down as head of !',;otre Dame in 1987, completing the longest tenure among active presidents of American universities. 
"Despite his retirement, Hesburgh continues much as he did as the nation's 
senior  university  chief  
executive officer  - as  a  
leading  educator  and  

humanitarian inspiring generations of students and citizens. and generously sharing his wisdom in the struggle for the rights of 
man," said Hoerner. 

Hesburgh has been a member or the United States Institute of Peace Board, which is attempting to solve problems in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 
Heshurgh considers his involvement in the Catholic Church tu be the most important aspPct. of his lifo. "l am very happy and honored . t ()

trying to 
be good at ev1>rvthing you do-for me, being a priest is the most important thi11g in my lil'P," said Hesburgh. 
lleshurgh served the Catholic Church from 1965 to 1970 as a member of the Moly See's delegation to the United Nations and as the permanent Vatican repre­sentative to the Atomic Energy Agency on behalf of Congress. 
llesburgh's medal cere­mony will most likely take place in spring or early summer in Washington, 
D.C. Specil'ically designed for Hesburgh, his medal will include two important parts of his life -the seal of the Congregation of the Holy Cross and the seal of Notre Dame. 
Created in 1776, the medal has been awarded to over 250 people. Recent recipients include the rev. Billy Graham Nelson Mandela. Hosa Parks and Colin Powell.

Ecuador's new president, Gustavo Noboa, stands with his wife Maria Baquerizo as he greets the press Sunday in Quito. Noboa took over as president after Jamil Mahuad was ousted by a three-man military junta. 

VP becomes president after coup 
Associated Press 
QUITO 
Ecuador's new presi­dent, Gustavo Noboa, comes into office with almost no experience in government except for 17 months as vice president. 
That's a plus for most Ecuadoreans. 
It means that Noboa, an academic and former uni­versity rector. has not been contaminal0,d by the r,orruption that has stained most public offi­cials sinc0, democracy was 
restored  to  this small  
Andean  nation  two  
dnr.ades ago.  

Well aware of public outrage over corrupt gov-
Georgia storm cuts power to thousands 
ernments. Noboa stressed in his first remarks as president that his priority would be to bring dishon­est officials to justice. He said he is prepared to fight to extradite them from abroad. where many have fled after looting the pub­lic coffers. 
"lie won't tolerate cor­ruption. That is something that characterizes him. He has never acquired wealth." said Walter Spurrier. a distinguished economist who has known Noboa for yAars. 
Noboa took office Saturday after the military forced President Jamil Mahuad from power. The military said it was taking the step to avoid "a social explosion" after hundreds of Indians and young mili­tarv officers stormed the Congress building and announced the formation of a new government to fight corruption and work on behalf of the poor. 
In his only public state­ment since assuming the presidency, Noboa sought to bring a message of hope to Ecuadoreans, who have grown increasingly dis­trustful of promises by political leaders. 
"My profound conviction as a Christian permits me to hope that vvith God's help Ecuadoreans today can begin the march toward better days." the 62-year-old president said. 
Noboa, a politiral inde·

The rain had been fore­cast to end late Saturday in Georgia but was still falling Sunday afternoon. Temperatures in the Atlanta area didn't warm above freezing until the middle of the day. 
Ice accumulated a half­inch thick on trees in parts of northern Georgia, and the weight of the ice on power lines pulled down utility poles.

In his only previous experience in public office prior to being elected vice president. Noboa served briefly in 1983 as the appointed governor of Guayas province. He also has experience in business as the former manager of a sugar refinery.

Rain and freezing tem­peraturrs spread a coat of ice across parts of Georgia Sunday, knocking out elec­trical service to more than a half-million customers. 
Many of those house­holds and businesses could be without powrr until at least Tuesday as crews struggle over slippery roads to reach downed lines and ice-coated tree limbs continue to snap, pulling down more. 
"This is the worst storm since Hurrkarni Opal came through in 1996, and it took six days to get power fully restored for that one," said Georgia Power spokeswoman Becky Hlaylock. "If it keeps rain­ing and it freezes again ... we could be looking at more people without power. We're in for a long haul." 
Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state· of emer­gency Sunday for six north­ern counties. and the Hed Cross opened eight shelters around the state for people who had no heat.

Chancellor Viktor Klima suggested for the first time Sunday that his Socialists could f'orm a govPrnrnent coalition with Joerg Haider's. far-right party -a group he had steadfastly rnj~c-rnd as autidemocratic. 
In an interview with ttrn Austrian newsmagazinc Format. Klima tempPred his changed stancP with a call for Haider's Freedom Party to support his proposed minority government of Socialists and independent exptffls.

The comments come as Austria's political leaders worked to end four months of political deadlock on forming a new government. Talks have been going on since parlia­mentary elections in October, when Klima 's Social Democrats finished first ­but without enough seats to rule on their own. 
While Haider's Freedom Partv finished second. Klima had ·firmly rejected any possi­bility of forming a coalition as long as Haider remains its head. lie then attempted to rev,ive the previous coalition of Socialists and the center­right People's Party -which came in third -but those efforts collapsed last week.

the scandal. Parliament has launched an inquiry to exam­ine whether bribes or kick­backs influenced government decision!-> under Kohl, who was chancellor from 1982­98, and he also is the subject of a criminal investigation. 
Kohl stepped dow11 as hon­orary chairman ol' tlrn Christian Democratic party last week under pressure from party leaders who demanded he identify the donors. Some party officials have even hintr,d of possible l<'gal action against Kohl to compel him to rov,~al the donors. 
Angela Merkel, party secre­tary-g1ineral, was meeting with senior party leaders Sunday ernning to review an audit of the party's finances. She told reporters that accountants were unable to clarify where $5.7 million in party money had come from, although $1 million were believed to be from Kohl's anonymous donors. 
The audit was to be made public Monday, but Merkel said it revealed nothing new about the part of the scandal disclosed over the weekend involving Mitterand, who died in 1996, and the French oil company Elf-Aquitaine. 
ARD television reported Saturday that Mitterrand arranged payment of $15.7 million to the Christian Democrats and that the money was transferred as part of alleged bribes total­ing $44 million paid by Elf­Aquitaine for its 1992 pur­chase of the former East German Leuna refinery. 
The alleged bribes have long been the subject of investigation by Swiss and French prosecutors. 
Officials in the German chanr.ellor's office also have been searching for missing government files on the pri­vatiza tio n deal sought by parliam,,,nt as part of its inquiry into tlrn scandal. This week, the government said it would appoint a special inv1\stigatur to track down what happened to the files. 
AHD said there was no evi­dence Kohl was aware of tho $15.7 million transfer, and Michael f!oik. Kohl's spokesman, called the allega­tion a charactPr assassina­tion of tlrn fornrnr chancellor. 
In a joint report with J:irench Television 2, ARD cited sources close to Mitterrand as saying the money was not bribes but was intended to serve "state interests for Europe." 
The report said the French and German secret services met regularly with middle­rnr.n in a Geneva hotel to make the payments. 
Meanwhile Sunday. the leader of Germany's Jewish community said he had received an apology from Christian Democrat leaders for a false comment by Prince Casimir Sayn­Wittgenstein, a former state party treasurer in Hesse, that some of the money in the scandal came from Jewish estates. 
"It came late, but not too late," Paul Spi1~gel, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. 
"men of 
honor." 
Those com­ments have dogged him ever since, though he has apolo­gized, and his party's str<!ng anti-foreigner stance has lur­ther besmirched its reputation abroad -Israel has threat­ened to break diplomatic rela­tions with Austria if the Freedom Party enters the gov­ernment. 
"It is a question of credibili­ty," Klima said in the Format interview. "I believe the pre­sent situation is a chance for the Freedom Party to prove that thev can take on respon­sibility for the state." 
President Thomas Klestil. who has had a strong voice in the post-election attempts to form a new government, favors a Socialist-People's Party coalilion, but bas indi­cate.ct he prrif'ers a Socialist minority government to a coalition that would include Haider's party. 
Both Klima and Klcstil will meet with all party hiaders per that the fax was a forgery and reiterated that he would not identify the donors from whom he has admitted soliciting $1 million that was kept off party books. 
"I don't have the intention to make such a statement," Kohl was quoted as saying.

Study: Seniors bored in school 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
College freshmen say they often were bored as high school seniors, coming late to classes or missing thorn entirely, evidence of what uni­versity researchers call "acad­emic disengagement." 
Theso students also worried 
about how to pay for college 
and one-quarter indicated 
there was "some" or a "verv 
good" chance they would have 
to work full time while in 
school. 
The 34th annual American 
Freshman survey questioned 
first-time, full-time college 
freshmen last year about their 
habits and attitudes during 
their final year of high school. 
More than 260,000 students 
at 462 two-and four-year 
schools participated in the 
research by the University of 
California, Los Angeles' 
Higher Education Research 
Institute, primarily during 
summer orientation or in the 
first few weoks of college. 
A record 40 percent of the 
students said they were "fre­
quently bored" in high school 
elasses, compared with the 
one-quarter who answered 
yes when the questions first was asked in 1985. More stu­dents also reported they were late to classes or skipped them. 
College and universities "need to make sure if the stu­dents are already feeling dis­engaged in high school that they arc going to get the sup­p o r t . mentor­

Elian's grandmothers pray in NYC 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez blew kisses and wiped away tears as they stood before 2,000 people praying in a Manhattan church Sunday for the 6­year-old boy's return to Cuba. 
The two women, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana, did not speak as worshippers at the interde­nominational Riverside Church gave them a standing ovation. 
"Raquel and Mariela are grateful for your love," said the Rev. Bob Edgar. a former Democratic congressman and head of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A., which spon­sored the grandmothers' trip from Havana. 
Randy Naylor, a spokesman for the church group, said the two women would leave New York on Monday. The two women arrived in New York on Friday and met Saturday with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno in Washington D.C. 
In an interview published in Sunday's New York Times, Quintana, the paternal grandmother, said: "We're not politicians. What we want is the well-being of the child." 
Referring to the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and other relatives whom the boy is staying with in Miami, she added: "I don't know why they want the child to stay here after the trauma he's been through. They are not close relatives." 
Elian was rescued from an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day after the boat in which he had left Cuba capsized. His mother. her boyfriend and nine others perished. 
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the boy returned to Cuba. His great-uncle has filed suit to stop the INS. And lawmakers in Congress plan an attempt this week to declare Elian a U.S. citizen. If such legislation becomes law, the boy no longer would be an immigrant under INS jurisdiction. 
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush. speaking on ABC's "This Week," said granting Elian citizenship "would be a won­derful gesture." 
He added that the boy's father should come to the United States. 
"A couple of weeks I would think would be reasonable so that the man could get a taste of freedom, so the man could understand the same emotions and the same senti­ment that evidently the boy's mother felt," Bush said. 
But Rodriguez, Elian 's maternal grandmother, scoffed at those who say Elian's mother would have wanted him to stay here. 
"None of them knew her," Hodriguez told the Times. "How can they know what she thought?" · 
The grandmothers told the Times that the boy was extremely close to them and to his father, and that he spent part of each week with his dad, who had divorced Elian's mother and remar­ried. 
So far the grandmothers have announced no plans to go to Miami. But the Cuban American National Foundation, a group opposed to the Cuban Communist regime of Fidel Castro, offered to fly them there. 
Jorge Mas Santos, the Miami-based group's chair­man, said the grandmothers are being manipulated by Castro and his supporters and would have come to Miami to sec Elian if not for "the fact that their loved ones remain as virtual hostages back in Cuba."

The argument would carry greater weight if, after pouring mil­lions or dollars into Iowa since his failnd l 996 bid, Forbes rares bettN than the new poll suggests -23 points behind Bush. 
The polls show that about one in 10 voters am undecid­ed, giving the candidates incentive to campaign hard Sunday. 
"The only thing I know to do is to encourage our folks to get out and vote. We nef'd as big a vote as possible," Bush Lold rnporters between cam­paign stops. 
In a lfmgthy interview with MIC, Bush struggled with his explanation for supporting a sales Lax increase in Texas aftf'r making a no-tax pledge. The second-term governor said he had qualified the promise by also pledging to reform education funding in the state, an effort that pre­sumably led to the tax propos­al. 
Dismissing the issue, Bush said "There's pledges all the tinrn" and reviewed a record as governor that included two major tax cuts. 
He also continued to flesh out his views on abortion, a critical issue to many GOP -caucus-goers. Asked about the topic ror the fourth day, he predicted that Texas would outlaw rirsl-trimester abor­tions if the Supreme Court reversed itself and let states impose strict an ti-abortion laws -a position Bush says the court should take. 
Maintaining a caucus tradi­tion. several campaigns had supporters papering churches and their parking lots with leallets. Religious conserva­tives represent a third of like­ly caucus-goers and are more likely than most voters to attend the sessions.

Orrin Hatch of Utah are carving up the reli­gious base. Keyes, Bauer and Halch am likely competing for third place; finishing lower could doom their candidacies. 
Addressing a congregation on the city's industrial north side, Bauer said Christians should vote more on principle than on "selfish" issues such as taxes. 
"Do what you think God would have you do," he said. 
Looking to New Hampshire, Bush pressed his case against Sen. Jolrn McCain's tax-cut­ting package. The Arizona senator, who did nol cam­paign in Iowa, is in a tight race with Bush in the New England state. 
"The fundamental debate is do we leave money in Washington or do we give it back to taxpayHs''" Bush said. 
McCain would cut fewer taxes than Bush, saving some projected government sur­pluses to bolster Social Security, Medicare and pay down lhe national debt. While Bush was in Iowa, McCain was campaigning Sunday in New Hampshire where he picked up endorsements from two of the state's biggest newspapers. 
Public polls suggest that Gore has opened a slight lead over Bradley in New Hampshire. though the vice president's own polls still show the race in a statistical dead heat. Bradley aides also consider the race tied. On the Republican side, McCain is maintaining a lead in the high single digits over the Texas governor, although Bush has an edge in at least one poll. 
A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll Sunday on the New Hampshire contest had \1.cCain ahead of Bush, 42 percent to 33 percent, among likely Republican primary vot­ers, with an error margin of plus or minus five percentage points. On the Democratic side, Gore had a lead over Bradley, 43 percent to 52 per­cent, with an error margin of plus or minus four percentage points.

Major refuses vaccine; confronts court martial 
Associated Press 
ELLEND/\LE. Del. 
Maj. Sonnie Bates is so cau­tious about following military rules that he won't talk to a reporter in his home without first changing out of his uni­form. 
But the decorated pilot has not followed all his orders. Bates, 35, is believed to be the highest-ranking officer in the Air Force to face a court-mar­tial for refusing to be vacci­nated against anthrax. 
"I fully expect to be in a court-martial inside of six weeks," he said. "And I'll lose the court-martial. I don't have any doubt." 
An investigating officer is to hold a hearing next week at Dover Air Force Base where Bates will be able to argue against the charge. IIc doesn't expect to win, and he believes thn Pnntagon intnnds to make an example of him. 
Lower-ranking soldiers con­cerned about getting sick from the anthrax vac­

Maj. Frank Smolinsky, chief of public affairs at Dover Air Force Base, said the proceed­ings don't have tn lead to a court-martial. There are sev­eral steps in the process that could lead to the charge being dismissed, Smolinsky said. 
But in the Bates home, the family is convinced that it will end badly. It has meant weeks of anxiety, sleepless nights, crying jags. 
The night before Hates heard the charge read against him, his wife's grandfather died. In her kitchen, Roxane Bates recounted how the dealh added to her stress. 
"Pop-Paw died?" Candy, their 14-ycar-old daughter, interrupted. 
"Oh my God, Candy, I didn't tell you," her mother said. She clasped hn hands to her face and Candy twisted into tears. 
"You can see what this has done to us, done to my fami­ly," she said. 'Tm so worked up about things I

The military has ordered all of its 2.4 million reserve and active-duty soldiers, sailors and airmen to be inoculated as a defense against biological warfare. 
Several military personnel have been prosecuted for refusing the shots, and some reservists have quit to avoid taking them. The military says they are safe. 
The consequences of Bates' decision are severe. He could lose his rank and pension. He could lose his house. And he could face up to five years in prison, away from his wife and three children. 
That is a thought that terri­fies Roxane Bates. She doesn't know what it will mean for Seth, their 7-year-old autistic son.

through Northern Kentucky University. He joined the Air Force in 1986, the year he graduated with a bachelor's degree in math. 
His study is littered with plaques for commendations and medals, including one for landing a plane in October 1998 after a storm knocked out its instruments. 
His concerns over the anthrax virus grew after he was assigned to Dover Air Force Base in August. He said 12 to 15 members of his 250­member squadron were out sick with serious illnesses: thyroid damage, infected cysts and lesions. The only common thread was their illnesses fol­lowed anthrax injections, he said. 
"Never in my time in the Air Force have I seen such a sick unit," Bates said. 
During a visit to the base last month, Defense Secretary William Cohen said he had halted production of the vac­cine at a Michigan factory that failed an inspection by the Food and Drug Administration. But Cohen !said the inoculations would continue with stockpiled vac­cinfl. 
"We have enough safe, reli­able vaccine stockpiled to continue this for anotherlyear." Cohen said, adding that he had begun taking the series of six shots that make up the inoculation himself. 
That isn't enough to con­vince Bates. 
"J thank God every day or my life for my health," Bates said. "And I'll be dadgummed if I'm going to give it up for anybody. If l give up my health, not only can l not defend this country, but I 
lean't protect and provide for my family."

In the elections on Julv 2. Labastida will face Vicente Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive and former gover­nor of Guanajuato state, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the former Mexico City mayor who is a pillar of the Mexican left.

Labastida promised that the elections will be "the freest, fairest and most hon­est in the history of the coun­try."

TUCSON, Ariz. -Growing up, chil­dren are typically taught to paint and draw using watercolors, oils, markers, crayons and colored pencils. As a kid, Chris Ofili was apparently far Maggie from typical. 
Burnett 
Last September, the Senate publicly condemned Ofili University of for his outlandish Arizona artwork and even stripped The Brooklyn Museum of Art of its funding for the exhibit. This is all very absurd, especially since Ofili was simply using his unique art as a vessel for self­expression. 
One of the more talked-about pieces by Ofili, a picture of the Virgin Mary covered with fecal matter and cutouts of "butt shots" from porn magazines, was referred to as "sick" by New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. 
Yet another, more local form of cen­sorship involves vulgarity on the Internet. Arizona State Representative Jean McGrath (R-GlendaJe) has pro­posed two bills, which, if made law, could prohibit students from surfing sexually-explicit Web sites on the Internet. 
Campus computers would be equipped with or subscribed to Internet filters, preventing access to this type of material. According to McGrath, if the material accessed on school computers is not related to a specific educational purpose, the student would be discon­nected immediately. 
This is not to say students every­where should overload school comput­er networks trying to access porn sites in case the filter becomes law. 
Frankly, anyone who would sit in a public area on campus to view online porn has a whole lot of nerve. But the government is trying to regulate free, unlimited Internet access to adults. Who's to say the proposed Internet fil­ter will only filter the smut? 
Before long, everything on the Internet could have to be censored, passed through a

does not.
These are two fair­ly hefty instances of attempted censor­ship and infringement on free speech. Both deal with prohibition of freedom, but who is to say where the line can be drawn? 
If the Senate feels the need to ban art that may offend certain people, then it is going to have to ban everything that offends people: clothing, books, music, language and maybe even food (sorry, Martha Stewart, your cherry tarts are just way too vulgar). 
Jnstead of worrying about what offends people, Jhe American govern­ment needs to take a long hard look at what truly does not. 
There is no right or wrong solution to censorship and questionably offensive forms of expression. What deeply dis­turbs one person might hit the funny bone of another. People all over the world have been arguing this fal£for centuries. Politicians like Guliani and McGrath have been poking around in other people's business since the begin­ning of time.

University of Notre Dame Cultural Diversity Timeline 
"vt'e are tied together in a single garment ofdestiny. caught in an inescapable network ofmutuality. And whatevPr affects one directly q_[fPcts all indirectly ... this is the uay God'suniverse is made, this is the wa!J it is structured." 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., March 31, 1968 
1988 In response to the 1987 Provost's Committee on Minority Students Report, President Malloy announced a university-wide enrollment plan to increase the presence of minorities at Notre Dame, and "to create a University community clll'iclied by minority presence among students, 
faculty and administrators.'' By the next year, the freshmen class minor­ity enrollment was raised from 11 percent to 15 percent, the goal of hiring 14 minority faculty was met and $12 million was a<lded to an endowment fund set aside for minor­ity scholarships. 
1992 The Task Force on Cultural Diversity, comprised of students, faculty and administrators, present­ed a final report of recommended actions for creating: 
 
a more diverse student population and faculty; 

 
academic support services for minorities; 

 
inclusion of cultural diversity in the curriculum; 

 
cultural diversity programming and residential life; 

 
expansion of the Office of Mino1·ity Student Affairs; and 

 
inclusion of "becoming a commu­nity of harmonious cultural diversi­ty" in the Notre Dame mission state­ment. 


The first annual "Celebration of the Life of Dr. Martin Luther, King, Jr.'' is planned and implemented at Notre Dame. 
1997 A crowd offans at a Bookstore Basketball tournament divides along lines ofl·ace. In response to con­cerns raised by lettern to The Observe1·, the Task Force on Cultural Diversity recommends changes to the organization and administration of future tournaments. 
When a racially-offensive comic strip appears in The Observer, the group PEACE (People for Equality, Action, Community and Education) forms to bring about cultural and racial tolerance at Notre Dame. 
A series of "Listening Sessions" with President Malloy, then Vice President of Student Affairs, Patricia O'Hara, and Provost Nathan Hatch, are held. 
1989 
The "Year of Cultural Diversity" is celebrated on campus, and declared a great success in heightening cul­tural awareness. 
1991 Students United For Respect (SUFR) is formed by a group of minority stu~ dents to call attention to shortcom­ings in the University's commitment to insure a welcoming and inclusive campus climate. A demonstration and sit-in is held at the Registrar's Office. 
Father Malloy creates the University Task Force on Cultural Diversity, and issues an "Open Letter on Cultural Diversity." 
1993 Keenan and Lewis Halls host a one­day event focusing on diversity at Notre Dame. 
1995 Keenan and Lewis Halls annual one­day multicultural event becomes "Diversity Week." 
1996 An African American student sparks a serious re-examination of race relations at Notre Dame with her letter to The Observer, describ­ing a racial incident which she experienced on campus. This letter becomes the focal of three forums entitled "The Race Issue at Notre Dame: Who's the Victim." 
'l'he Task Poree on Cultural Diversity is reinstated by Father l\'lalloy. 
1998 A conference is held at Notre Dame to examine reinstating the Latino Studies Program on campus. 
African American administrators Chandra Johnson and Davis Moss are appointed Assistant to the President and Asst. Vice President of Student Affairs, respectively.

his dream of desq~T"gation in the mo::;t famous civil rights speech Anwrica has known. 
King grew up in a world where people lived differnnt lives based on the color of tlwir skin. A hlat·k person could not sit next to a white p1\rson on a bus. A blal'k pNson could not drink water from tht' sanw fountain as a white person. A black pnrson did not havn the sanrn t:areer opportunities as a whitr1 p<1rson. 
But King dared to dream differently. He dreamed of a world in which boys and girls of any ('Olor could attend school togntlrnr and learn l'rom one anotht~r. llis vision was onn ol' richnnss. in which diffnrern·es werr 1\mbrared and apprPciatPd. 
"Now is the lime lo make justice n reality for all r~f' (ioc/ ·s children." 
Martin Lutlwr King Day was last Mondav. ThP dav cPIP­brated not only King's accomplishmPnts, but also his idnals. As tlw Notn· Dam(! t:<!lnbratPs tlw holiday this week. it is important that Pach mPmber of' the Notn l)am<' com­munity pt>rsonally captures King's spirit. 
If' lw were lwre today. if' hn walked on campus. walked past the gold1)n dome, walkPd past tlw dorms and walked into the mind of' a typical Notre Danw studPnt. what kind of' prrjudicrs would hP find tlwrt>? Prrhaps the grPatrst ]ps­son a person ran learn from King is tlw lesson of' sPll'­examination. 
King's nrnssagc was one of' dnsegrngation. That nwssage still applies today. lr1ss for surh obvious things as tlw rnlor of' a person's skin. and more !'or subtler things such as rPli­gion. sociorconomic status or sexual prpfpnnce.

Wlwn ashd if King would be happy with what lw were to see on this campus. junior Timothy Brick said, "On this campus? Cornparnd to his day, yes. On the otht>r hand. r.omparnd to otlwr colleges. no. The 'normal' and 'liberal' portions of' tlw world arP rPally VPry tolerant. It's only tlw rnally, really conservativn and/or psycho factions ol' tlw country that might l'rightnn him." 
Frnshman Christin<' C:any said, "I think that tlw Univnrsity tries to put up a false l'arn of tolt'rancP. It is. however. blatantly obvious how prPjudict>d tlw UnivPrsity and,,many of' its studt!nts arn toward ('(irtain types ol' pno­pln.

From his youlh onward. King showed the girts of' passion and discipline. In 1948. al tlw age> of I 9. King graduatPd from \11uirPhousP ColkgP without evnr having gradualPd from high school.

This speech dnfined the moral basis that would serve as the foundation of the civil rights movement. Before his death. Kennedy had created the Civil Hights Bill. Finally, the Civil Bights Act of' 1964 took hold of segre­gation and tossed it aside by prohibiting racial discrimination in public places. and by calling for equal opportunity in employ­ment and education for African Americans. 
In 1965, Congress passed another bill entitled the Voting Bights Act of 1965. This bill allowed African-Americans to vote in all public clt1ctions and came into action partly because of a protest in Selma, Ala., that King helped organize. The protest indudcd a maJTh from Selma to Montgomery, the state capital. It was interrupted with tear gas and police brutality, but the point came across loudly and clearly. They would fight for their rights using weapons of words and tactics of peace. 
In 1968, the life of Martin Luther King Jr. came to an end when a sniper assassinated him at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. lie died moments later in St. Joseph's Hospital from a gunshot wound to the neck. 
In 1842, Father Edward Sorin started this Liniversitv. He, too, had a vision. A vision of young pe~iple learning to use the gifts of knowledge, wisdom. discipline and integrity in order to better this world. With the cele­bration or !\1artin Luther King Day, it is important for Notre Dame students, faculty and administration to think about the strong correlation between the visions of Sorin and King. 
Both Sorin and King worked for a world in which people would rise above petty judg­ment a.nd dosed minds. a world in which people would learn togP-tlrnr and work together f'or L11e good or one another. 
If Kin~ were to walk onto this campus, one hopes that be would be pleasr.d. It is up to each individual to eradicate prnjudices and to confront any foar of those who are dilTPr­1~nl. 
"And uhrn this happens, when we allou· freedom to ring, when we let it ring from euery village and el'ery hamlet. from every state and every city, we will he able to speed up that day when all of God's chil­dren, /Jlark men and white men, Jews (Ind Gentiles.

Another Seminole arrested 
Associated Press 
TALL/\! IASSEE. rla. 
Sebastian Janikowski, Florida State's two-time All-American kicker. was arrested at a night­club early Sunday and accused of attempting to bribe a police officer into releasing his room­matr. 
The arrest was yet another problem v.ith the law for the championship Florida State team. 
Bribery is a third-degree felony but it is up to the state attorney's office to officially charge Janikowski. However. police said he can be charged with greater or lesser offenses. 
Janikowski was released from Leon County jail at 7:42 a.m., on $1,000 bail. If found guilty, he faces up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. 
The arrest stems from a dis­pute at The Grove nightclub. when' police officer Chris Knight was working as an off­dutv bouncer. The dub told Kni.ght that Janikowski was welcome, but his friends were not. police said Knight told Janikowski's roommate, Aaron Silverman, LO leave. 
Silverman refused, and af'ter several warnings was taken into r,ustody. police said. Janikowski approached Knight as he was doing paperwork in his patrol car and asked a few questions. 
When Knight loohd up again. "Janikowski was smiling at him and counting out money," police said. "Janikowski stepped back to the car and asked 'How much?"' 
Police said Janikowski offered $300 to persuade Knight to let his friend go. 
Janikowski has kicked 50 field goals the past two sea­sons. and most of his kickoffs were beyond the end zone. He is the only current player on a recently selected college team of the century. 
Earlier this month, Janikowski said he will leave school a year early to enter the \!FL He has said he wants to 
turn pro so his mothr,r in Poland can join him in thP United States. 
.Janikowski is known to frn­quent late-night spots around Tallahassee While in New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl, he mis!:ied curfew. 
The Seminoles' most promi­nent legal trouble this past srm­son involved star wide receiver Peter Warrick and teammatr Lavcranues Coles in connection with a department store scam. 
Warrick was suspended two games and reinstated after pleading guilty to a misde­meanor. Coles was kicked off the team. 
Several other players also had run-ins with the law. rang­ing from marijuana possession to drunken driving. 
Janikowski's arrest came only hours after he was hon­ored at a rlorida State football banquet. Earlier Saturday, the entire team was feted by more than 25,000 fans at a ccdebra­tion also attended by the gover­nor and several top state~ offi­cials.

Sroring wasn't the only strong point for the Irish as Lhcy out-rebounded the Hurrir,anes 40-27. 
The Miami defense had trou­ble containing Irish center Huth Riley and forward Julie Henderson. Hilev scored 15 points and Henderson added 
13. as they led the Irish to an impressive 54 shot percentage. 
Henderson had the only dou­ble -do u b Ie between the two teams, with a game-high 11

rnbounds. 
The Hurricanes, a team that has struggled to remain above the .500 mark, fell to 8-8 on the season and 2-3 in Big East play. 
Center Martha Bodley scorr,d 13 points to lead the Miami squad, which shot only 39 per­cent from the field. 
The Irish will only have a few days to prepare for their next conference test -the squad will be back in action Wednesday when they travel to new York to take on thP Hcd Storm of St. Johns. 
AUSTRALIAN OPEN 
Williams falls in straight sets 
Associatcd P rc,s 
MELBOUHNE, Australia 
Serena Williams held out her palms as if pleading to the heavens, trying to figure out why nothing was going right. 
She talked to herself, talked to her racket, and still she whacked balls into the net as though her arms had inexplica­bly lost all their strength. 
The 18-year-old U.S. Opcm champion sank in a sea of errors at the Australian Opc,n, going down in straight sets in the fourth round against Elena Likhovtseva. 
Williams, who had looked so sharp in her previous victory, could barely control the ball in a 6-3, 6-3 loss replete with 32 
unforced errors  - a  doznn  
more  than  the  No.  1 (>  
Likhovtseva.  

"I couldn't make any shots ... 
I couldn't do anything," said the third-seeded Williams, who came into the Australian Open after not playing a match in three months. "There's no excuse for me to have lost this match. I just couldn't find my rhythm throughout the whole match. · 
"I don't why I made so many errors. I just didn't do anything right." 
Williams refuted suggestions that she was unprepared for the Australian Open after com­ing here from Florida just a few days before. 
"I was here long enough." she insisted. "That's no excuse." 
Unlike her net-charging style earlier and in her U.S. Open title run last September. Williams rarely attempted to attack against the Hussian baseliner.

Late LeClair goal ties Penguins 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH 
John LeClair scored with a minute to play and . the Philadelphia Flyers tied the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-4 Sunday night despite squandering a third-period lead. 
The Penguins led 2-0, fell behind 3-2 as the Flyers· top­ranked power play scored twir.e, then took back the lead at 4-3 on goals by Jiri Slegr and Robbie Brown 1:04 apart in the third period. 
But with the Penguins trying to run out the clock and win for the second time in seven games, LeClair directed the puck past Tom Barrasso at 19:00 of the third -his 26th goal and 11th in his last 15 games against the Penguins. 
The Penguins, playing their third consecutive game without the injured Jaromir Jagr (ribs), remained winless in overtime ­0-5-4. The Flyers, also without their star as Eric Lindros sat out with a concussion, are 3-2-7 in overtime. 
The Flvers had been held to thrPe goals while going 0-3-1 in their previous four games. 
Slegr made it 3-3 at 6:06 of the third with a shot through tratlic from just inside the top of the left circle that eluded rookie goaltender Brian Boucher, who had allowed two goals in his previous two starts. 
Slegr, scoreless for 16 games, was so happy he finally scored that he took several strides on skates and banged his chest into the glass along the left-wing boards. ·.-yqf 
The Penguins, outshot 33-16 at the time and 39-27 overall, retook the lead at 7:10 when Brown. stationed along the goal line. punched in the rebound of Jan Hrdina's shot for sixth goal and second in as many nights. He also scored in Pittsburgh's 4­2 loss at Montreal on Saturdav. 
German Titov, who critici~ed coach Herb Brooks last week in a Russian newspaper interview for his lack of playing time, scored twice in the first 3:02 as the Penguins -losers of five of six -jumped into a 2-0 lead. 
But the lead and the sudden burst of offense from a team that was held to 29 shots in its previous two games didn't hold 
up. 
The Flyers, reconfiguring their lines with Lindros out and Rod Brind'Amour gone after being dealt to Carolina for hold­out Keith Primeau earlier in the day, had plenty of scoring chances but couldn't convert 
-enough of them. Philadelphia outshot Pittsburgh 20-4 in the first peri­od and killed off a five-minute Penguins power play early in the second period, yet trailed 2­'l until Marc Bureau scored his

The game started hours after Carolina traded Keith Primeau to Philadelphia, ending specula­tion that Coyotes owner Richard . Burke wanted to unload Tkachuk and his $8.3 million salary to acquire Primeau in a three-way deal involving the Hurricanes and New York 
Rangers.

second time in three games. 
This time, though, the Coyotes 
recovered thanks to Lumme's 
seventh goal and 99th of his 
career. It was the Swedish 
defenseman's 400th career 
point. 
Nolan got his 30th goal on a

Ziggy Palffy had a goal and an assist and Luc Robitaille had two assists. helping the Kings hand the Northwest Division leaders their second loss in 13 games (8-2-3). 
Adam Deadmarsh and Dave Reid scored for the Avalanche. 
Los Angeles needed just eight shots to grab a 3-0 lirst-period lead against rookie Marc Denis, who entered with three straight victories. 
Pa!ffy and Murray opened the scoring with power-play goals less than two minutes apart against a penalty-killing unit that in the last six games had allowed only one power play goal in 27 short-handed situa­tions. 
Peter Forsberg was serving a penalty l'or roughing up Craig Johnson when Palfly opened the scoring at thP. 8:51 mark. Denis stopped Hob Blake's one-timer from the left circle with his glove, but Hobitaille got the rebound at the left of the net and slid the puck behind Denis and through the crease to Palffy for the easy tap-in.

NBA Nelson picks up 900th victory 
Associated Press 
There won't be an asterisk in the record books to denote Don Nelson's 900th victory. 
Still, beating the Pistons without Grant Hill was a lot easier than doing it with Detroit's superstar in tho line­up. 
The Mavericks took advan­tage of Hill's absence and made Nelson the sixth NBA coach to reach 900 victories as they beat the Pistons 99-91 Sunday.. 
'Tm just glad I won't have to talk about it any more," Nelson said with a smile. "The thing I'm happiest about is that it was won the way gamns are supposed to be won. I'm only going to remem­ber that everyone played hard for us. we changed strategies and made adjustments and then we found a way to win it in the end." 
The Mavericks were also shorthanded with Gary Trent on the bench with a strained groin. They made up for it with a balanced attack, led by 22 from Cedric Ceballos and 18 from Michael Finley. Ceballos and Finley also pulled down 10 rebounds each. 
"That's the way this team plays -we go to whoever is hot at the time," Ceballos said. "And we love winning. Yesterday, after the Nr,w Jersey loss, everyone was quiet. The room was quiet, the bus was quiet and the plane was quiet. But the nice thing about this league is that you can come right back and get it off your back. That's what wn did tonight." 
Hill sat out with a bruised hip and back suffored Saturday in Chicago. He is not expected to play again until at least Thursday. Jerry Stackhouse led all scorers with a season-high 36, but Jud Buechler has the next highest with a season-high 12.

"There's a couple guys on this team that aren't coming out to perform," said Seattle guard Gary Payton who had a game-high 29 points. "We nfled to do something about this. We beat three or four

Playing at home certainly helped Notre Dame's confi­dence shooting the ball. The Irish shot 62 percent from the field and connected on a school record 14 three-point­ers. 
"Every team has been hav­ing a field day with us lately," Pitt forward fiicardo Greer said. "Today they were red hot and it killed us. We tried to go to the zone to prevent Troy Murphy from scoring. We knew Graves and Carroll could shoot but were more worried about Murphy. The others that shot well all year just shot well todav too."

Notre Dame sr.ored more than hair of it.-; points from three-point land, brr~aking thr. previous school record of' '13. The team shot an astounding (ii percent l'rom long distance, touring apart Pitl.sburgh 's defense. 
As Notre Dame won by the three, Pittsburgh lost by the three. Not only could the Panth11rs not prevent the rod­hot shooting of the Irish, they only shot 23 percent on their 26 shots from behind the arc. 
"I think that's 38 in three games," Pittsburgh coach Ben Howland of the number of thrne-point shots the Panthers have given up of late. "With our lack of depth, it's hard for us to play much man-to-man. I think that they along with the other four teams we've played in the Big East [St. John's, Connecticut, Seton I!all and Syracuse], are all NCAA tfmms, and I would be surprised if that doesn't hap­pen." 
Balancp, in the game was kC1y for th11 Irish, as five players hit multiple treys for the Irish in the Big East victory -Carroll, Graves, Troy Murphy, Martin Ingelsby and Jere Macura. 
"At times you think that Troy's the only one that can score," Notre Dame head coach Matt Doherty s.aid, "But we've got other guys that can knock the ball in thr. basket." 

The Irish WPre hot from the beginning as NotrP Dame was hitting its shots from the open­ing seronds, as Murphy and Carroll scored three-pointers on the first two possessions. 
Carroll and lngelsby each 
dialed long distanr.1~ three 
times, while c;ravcs and 
Murphy were both two for four 
from three-point range. 
"It doesn't matter who 
sr.ores," lngelsby, a senior point 
guard, said. "We've got some 
n~ally good shooters. If we're 
hitting our shot.-;, it's going to 
make Murphy more elfer.tivc." 
But it was the freshman reserve Macura who was thP most surprising sharp shooter. Ile hit four thrn11-pointers in the first eight minutes. 
"He's a grnat shooter," Dohertv said. 'Think back to Indiana, he had 13 points in tlrn Ind'iana gamr.. I want that Jore back." 
Macura, who averages only 
4.3 points per game in his first season at Notre Dame, scored 12 points in 20 minutes. 
"Macura impressed me," Howland said. "Hr. has great form as a shoott1r. Ingelsby we knew was a grnat shooter. We were late getting to him [on his shots]." 
Every player who took a shot from behind the arc for the Irish nailed at least two. All five shot 50 percent or better in the con­test. 
Doherty said the team's improved offensive execution was a big factor in the hot shooting. 
"We worked a lot since the Syrar.use game on our zone offense," Doherty said. "Because against Syracuse, we didn't exe­cute our offense very well. We've got good shooters. If they can get open, I feel confident they can get the shot."

the kev. I've been hurting his confid~nce." Whatever it was that was holding Notre Dame (12-7, 3­
2) back, Macura and the Irish responded Saturday with a 81­66 victorv over the Panthers (8-8, 0-5) in front of 10,030 fans at the Jovce Center. 
"It's nice· to win again against a team that I think is a very good basketball team," Doherty said. "I was very con­cerned. After two losses you want to come home and play well for yourselves. for your team and for the crowd." 
Macura came off the bench to hit four three-pointers and finished with 12 points, while Troy Murphy scored a game high 21 to lead the Irish . 
"I felt very good off the bench and in warm-ups," Macura said. "I thought this was going to be my day." 
"He's a great shooter. He hasn't played as well over the past few weeks," Doherty added. "So hopefully this will

In overtime, Carlson was the hero once again. His goal 52 sec­onds into overtime ignited a cel­ebration by both the Irish play­ers and fans. Carlson's game­tying and game-winning goals gave the Irish a trilling come­back victory highlighted by three goals in the final 4:18. 
"Dan Carlson was the best player on the ice tonight," said Poulin. "There were a lot of good players but he was definite­Iv the best." 
· The Irish had 21 shots on goal in the second period with no goals to show for it. They came back out in the third and put 25 shots on goal. In addition to tlrn impressive offensivB sho½·ing the Irish defense took the Bronco's 2nd ranked powerplay out of the game -limiting them to few scoring chances. 
"After the second period, I thought that we had played our best period of the year, until the third," Poulin said. "We were dominating and losing, but our attitude through the whole game was we are going to find a way to win. It was an enormous win for us." 
Notre Dame carried the momentum over from the first game to take an early lead on Saturday night to pick up its sec­ond straight win with a 4-1 win. 
Dusbabek scored less than seven minutes into the game on a hard slap shot from the blue line. With the lead the Irish kept the pressure up, both on offense and defense, and never looked back. 
Ryan Dolder added a power play goal with six seconds remaining in the opening pBriod to stretch the lead to two. Carlson added a power play goal early in the second to give Notre Dame eight power play goals in its last13 goals scored. 
The defense continued to keep Western Michigan off of their game, limiting the number of good scoring chances and effec­tively killing eight Notre Dame penalties. 
Freshman Michael Chin scored the fourth Irish goal at the 15:51 mark of the second period ­finally capitalizing after several good scoring chances earlier in the game.

when Western Michigan finally found the back of the net seven minutes into the third period. 
"We were much better tonight [in the second game]," Poulin said. "We had a controlled effort from the start. We give out game pucks to the guys that play very well and this time the puck went to the whole team." 
Dusbabek finished the week­end with six points -one goal and two assists in each .game .,.... while Carlson added four points (2G-2A). All four Notre Dame lines contributed strong play to the offensive outburst in the series. The Irish scored seven goals over a 40-minute span car­rying over from the last five min­utes on Friday and into Saturday's game. 
Notre Dame has struggled in the second games of series, but the strong play this weekend finally broke that problem. The Irish are now 5-2-2 in the first games and.2-5-2 in the second. 
"It was definitely a factor going into the game," said Poulin. "We knew that we had to put back-to-back games togeth­er." 
The sweep pushed Notre Dame (10-13-5, 7-7-4 CCllA) into sole possession of fifth place in the CCHA. The Irish trail the fourth-place Lake Superior State Lakers by just three points.

There was little pain in Mc·Nair's stats -except to the Jags, who won 15 games this year and lost just three. all to the Titans.

Tampa's gallant defensive effort looked like it would be enough to steal the victo­ry. 
Kut quartPrback Shaun King made sev­eral critical mistakes down the stretch, including an interception at mid field by fellow rookie Dre' Bly that set up the win­ning drive. 
"We brought them into our zone, w11 brought them into our misery.'' said Warren Sapp. the Defensive Player of the Yr.ar. "and we had them down 6-5 and just kept battling ... and it came down to one play." 
Tampa Bay ('oar-h Tony Dungy said· "It's a very tough fer,ling. difficult tu be that <;!ose to a Super l:3owl and not get it dorm.

"I think we showed people we can play l'very kind of game." said l\rlarshall Faulk. the NFL Offensive Player of the Year who certainly didn't play his kind of game. The record-setting running back was held to a total ol' 49 yards. 
"They wanted Lo play ball control and take the deep ball away from us. We did the same lo them and thought our offense rnuld make more plays than them." 
They made one more play, offsetting the defensive effort by the Bucs, who held St. Louis to 309 yards, 91 below its sea­son average. 
But the Hams had to survive a last­ditch march on which they got two of their five sacks on King, who still man­ag-ed to lead the Bucs to thci St. Louis 22. 
"We made a couple of plays, but I took a coup!(\ of sacks, and that's a no-no at that time." said King, who finished 13-of'­29 for 163 yards and two interceptions.

started off the season by beating 
Western 
\.'tichigan. Ball State and Michigan State Pasily, Notre DamP finished 2(, points ahead of Western l\hrhigan, on the strength of seven event victo­ries. 
"Thc Big East is always the big focus for us," Mishka said. "I think we took a few giant steps towards winning that tonight, which would be really great for the seniors. We've never been able to bring that home." 
Mishka won the 800-meter dash in 1 minute, 49.68 sec,­onds, nearly two seconds ahead of his nearest competi­tor. That time was good enough to earn the senior run­ner a provisional qualification for the NCAA Indoors Championships. He also ran a leg in the victorious men's 4 x 400-meter relay team. 
West, a senior All-American, leapt 25-4 1/2 in the long jump. falling just shy of break­ing his own Notre Dame record. The mark met provi­sional NCAA qualifying stan­dards. whirh earns him a spot

to jump at nationals if thrre are not enough jumpers who meet the automatic qualifying mark. 
"I want to gflt an automatic, because you nf'ver know with a provisional." West said. "I didn't get that mark until much later in the season last yf'ar." 
Sophomore distance runner Luke Watsnn was the third member of the men's squad who met provisional qualifying standards. Watson carried the :-LOGO-meter race with a win­ning time of 8:09.50. 
"I've never in 26 years," head track and licld coach Joe Pianc said. "had four pt1oplc qualify-f'or nationals in the first meet of the year. That's amaz­
ing." 
Senior Chris Cochran scored a double-win in the sprints, winning both the 60-meter dash and the 200-meter dash. He also led off the first place 4 x 400-meter rclav. 
"On the men's side. we had a lot of personal bests." sprint r.oach John Millar said. "Chris Cochran ran his best times Pvcr in the 60 and the 200, and just missed an NCAA qualifying time. Terry Wray ran the fastest 400 he's run since he's been here. Travis Davey, ran the fastest 200 and fastest 60 that he's ever run." 
Wray finished third in the 400-meter dash, while Davey placed among the top six in both his events. 
Senior Tim Kober ran the third-fastest time in Notre Dame history in the 600-meter run, winning the event in 
1:19.88. Ile also anchored the 4 x 400-meter relay with a 
48.2 leg. 
"We did extremely well if you think it's the first meet of the season," Kober said.

HOCKEY 
Notre Dame sweeps into fifth place 
. Dusbabek, Carlson lead ND to wins over WMU 
By !,1ATT OLIVA 
Spom Writer 
Despite trailing 3-1 with less than fom minutPs remaining in the third period. the Irish hock­ey team did not panir. and ral­
lic d for a 4-3 over­time victo­ry over Llw Western Michigan Broncos. 
Thr win in the first 

game of Carlson the two-g a m e seriPs was critical because a strong wePkend would boost the Irish ahead of the Broncos and into 5th placP in the CGIA. Losing would drop them further out of contention for a top SPPd in the playoffs. In the last five minutes of the tirst game, the Irish would turn the game around. The only Irish goal had come in the first period on a fluke bounce off of Joe Dusbabek's leg. They had out­played tlu~ Broncos throughout the entire game but had only a two-goal deficit to show for it. 
The Irish held their opponent to only one shot on goal for the t>ntire third period. and out-shot the Broncos by an amazing 44 shots in the game, 56-1 G. 
With 3 minutes, 26 seconds left in the game, the brcilks started to go Notre Dame's way. David Inman scored off assists from Andy Jurkowski and Sean Seul'erth t;J bring the game bark within in one goal. Then. with about a minute and a half left in regulation. head roach Dave Poulin called il timeout to db­cuss a play. After pulling goal­tender Tony Zasowski to give tbe Irish an extra attacker, the Irish won the ensuing face off and created a fury of shots in front of' Bronco goaltender Jeff Reynaert. 
Dusbabek knocked a shot off of the post and the rebound came out to junior left wing Dan Carlson, who put the puck in the net to tie the game at three with 1:23 left. 
"We were on tbe power play in their encl and we have to win thf' game." Poulin said. "We had worked on a new faceoff play with four or five options to score off of. We pulled the goalie early because in this situation we needed to win." 
A major factor in the outcome of the game came with 28 sec­
onds left as Western Michigan's Mike Bishai took a penalty that 
Jay Kopischke maneuvers through the neutral zone in Friday's 4-3 overtime win against the see HOCKEY/page 23 Western Michigan Broncos.
