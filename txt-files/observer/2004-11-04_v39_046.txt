Bush wins election 
Senator Kerry concedes defeat in Ohio, stating hopes the nation 'can begin the healing' 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Bush daimed a re-election man­date Wednesday after a record 59 million Americans chose· him over Democrat John Kerry and voted to expand Hepublican con­trol of Congress as well. He pledgPd to pursue his agenda on taxes and Iraq while seeking "the broad support of all Amerieans." 
Kerry conceded defeat in make-or-break Ohio rather than launch a legal fight reminiscent of the contentious Florida reeount of four years ago. "I hope that we can begin the healing," the Massachusetts senator said. 
Claiming a second term denied his father, George H.W. Bush, the president struck a conciliatory tone, too. "A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation," he said, speaking directly to Kerry's supporters. 
"To make this nation stronger and better, I will need your sup­port and I will work to earn it," he said. "I will do all I can do to deserve your trust." 
It was a warm-and-fuzzy dose to one of the longest, most nega­tive presidential races in a gener­ation. 
Bush didn't use the word man­date, but Vice President Dick Cheney did, and the president's intention was clear as he ticked off a familiar list of second-term goals: overhaul the tax code and Social Security at home while waging war in Iraq and else­where to stem terror. 
Bush stands to reshape the fed­eral judiciary, starting with an aging Supreme Court that voted 5-4 to award him Florida four years ago. In all branches of gov­ernment, the GOP now holds a solid, if not permanent, ruling

SENATE 
Group debates ticket sales 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Associate News Editor 
In a continuation of dis­cussion from Monday's Council of Representatives meeting, the topic of men's basketball ticket distribu­tion was brought up Wednesday at Student Senate. 
Senior Karl Wahoske took the podium to make sena­tors aware of the problems he perceived with the cur­rent ticketing process and to suggest possible solutions. 
"For the second year in a row, I don't have basketball tickets. Last year I was the second person in line not to get them; this year I was the fifth," Wahoske said. "There has got to be some kind of change made to the system." 
Echoing arguments made by Siegfried senator James 
Leito at the COR meeting, Wahoske said that he saw the reservation of 200 tick­ets for Saint Mary's and Holy Cross students as unfair for those Notre Dame students left empty-handed. 
"When there are a limited number of tickets-not like football, where everyone can get tickets -all of the student section tickets should be offered to Notre Dame students first," Wahoske said. "I just want to the chance to watch my school's basketball team play." 
Morrissey senator Josh Pasquesi said later he did not believe that eliminating fans from Saint Mary's and Holy Cross was the answer.

majority. 
Bush's vote totals were the biggest ever and his slice of the vote, 51 percent, made him the first president to claim a majority since 1988 when his father won 53 percent against Democrat Michael Dukak.is. 
Like Dukakis, Kerry is a Massachusetts politician who was labeled a liberal by a Bush. This president also called Kerry a flip-flopping opportunist who would fight feebly against terror. 
None of that rancor was evi­dent Wednesday, when Kerry called Bush to concede the race. 
He told Bush the country needed to be united, and Bush agreed. But the numbers suggest the country is deeply split. 
Bush's victory ensures Republican dominance of virtual­ly every quarter of the U.S. politi-. cal system for years to come ­the White House, Congress and the federal judiciary. Democrats pored over election results and sadly determined that the GOP base was bigger, more rural. sub­urban and Hispanic than they had ever imagined.

Thank you especially to my f1~llow young votl~rs for their stellar turnout at the polls. Your engaged attitude is truly heartening. In 20 years we will have the privilege of bearing the bil­lion dollar burden of social security.

Congratulations voters, on re-elect­ing a man for whom diplomacy equals militarism. The country has been granted another four years under someone who largely ignored the already existing violent conflicts in thn world, and added to the mix two of his own. 
II urray indeed for choosing a man who promised the liberation of the Iraqi people and the securing of pro­lific amounts of dangerous weaponry. Our returning president did indeed lasso a dictator, but in his place rose heated violence and alarming American and Iraqi casualties.

Chicago professor lectures on 'confrontation of evil' 
Elspeth enlightens Harry Potter fans and religious scholars on St. Augustine and children's series 
By EILEEN DUFFY 
News Writer 
Professor Jean Elspeth of the University of Chicago enlightened "!larry Potter" fans and religious scholars alike Wednesday after­noon in her lecture entitled "St. Auf.,rustinP, Harry Pottm. and the Confrontation with Evil." 
Elspeth began the talk, which was sponsored by tho Schmidt Foundation and the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture, with an assessment of evil today. 
"Evil is in the air these days in our political life." she said, recall­ing President Reagan's reference to the Soviet Union as the "empire of evil;" Pmsident Clinton calling the perpetrators of the Oklahoma City bombing "doers of evil;" and Pn1sident Georgia W. Bush terming the Iraq, Iran and North Korea regimes the "axis of evil." 
Evil has been a notion recog­nized throughout history, Elspeth noted. She related a story from her childhood: a Russian family was forced to immigrate to her tiny hometown in Colorado, nar­rowly escaping Stalin's destruction of small farms throughout Russia. 
"When talking about her experi­ences, !The mother] would weep softly and rock back and forth," Elspeth explained. "Evil was what she had faend." 
Elspeth then turned to St. Augustine, who, she said, has made "the most monumental of all efforts in Western thought to grapple with the question of evil." As a child, Augustine was caught up in a world of physical hedo­nism, said Elspeth; in error, he recognized evil as an external force which he could blame for his wrongdoing. This erroneous thought was known as dualism. 
Eventually, Augustine realized that it was his own impiety that had led to sin, Elspeth said, com­ing to reject the notion of evil as a force and beginning to under­stand it as a falling away from the good. 
'"Evil' is the name we give to an assent to temptation that might become servitude over time," said Elspeth. She noted that doers of evil do not understand what it is like to live in the world of the good, and often search for some­thing to attach themselves to. 
"Evil lies in limited, hollowed­out, empty men and women who do horrific things," Elspeth said. "Good relies on unrehearsed deed-doing of men and women who occasionally achieve extraor­dinary things." 
Elspeth then began her discus-· sion of the ·"Harry Potter" series, attributing much of her explana­tion to her grandson, Bobby, with whom she had read the five books this summer. She noted that despite the overwhelming pres­ence of evil throughout the stories, there is good that is always able to light back. 
From volume one of the series, "l larry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Elspeth noted three main points. First, she pointed out that Voldemort is a powerful wizard who has gone to the dark side, much like the fallen angel Satan. Second, she noted Voldemort's important idea that there is no good and evil, there is only power." Third and finally, she highlighted the point that Harry escaped Voldemort's death curse because of the love and sacrifice of his mother -evil could do nothing in the presence of such good. 
In volume two, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Elspeth pointed out the ability of evil, represented by Voldemort, to feed off of an evil subject (the younger version of himself, Tom Riddle) as well as a good one (Ginny Weasley, younger sister of Harry's friend Ron). Harry is saved by Dumbledore's phoenix Fawkes, whose tears of compas­sion heal Harry's wounds and blind an evil snake. 
Volume three, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," introduces readers to "Dementors," evil guards of the Azkaban prison whose "kiss" sucks out a person's soul. 
"Like evil," Elspeth said, "the Dementors take away, but cannot give anything." 
Elspeth compared the feeling that the characters experience around the Dementors is like one who has succumbed to evil ­such as Ron Weasley experiences in volume three when he says '"I felt weird, like I would never be cheerful again,"' Elspeth said. 

Finally, Elspeth noted the ability of humor and wit to drive the demons away. She explained that Christians have often spoken of good humor as one of God's gifts to humanity. 
Elspeth mainly chronicled Voldemort's desire to gain materi­al form in volume four, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire." Voldemort uses a servant called Wormtail to help him remain alive. feeding mainly on snake venom. 
"Does this not suggest," Elspeth asked, "that if no one fed evil, it would not continue? IVoldemort] is kept alive through the willing actions of others." 
Vlsiting Professor Umbridge was Elspeth's foeal point in her .discus­sion of volume five, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix." Umbridge often belittled and embarrassed her students. "This notion of a kind of mockery at the suffering of others is recognized as a characteristic of evil," said Elspeth. 

In conclusion, Elspeth admitted that the books could be troubling for some children. "Harry Potter offers children a serious picture of a moral universe, in which very bad things sometimes happen," she said. "But none of us is with­out a way of fighting back against it."

good policy to follow in general," Pasquesi said. 
Wahoske also took on the poliey of allowing students to line up with six IDs whon purchasing tickets. Calling six IDs "excessive," Wahoske suggested that limiting the numlHlr to two or thrnn would help elimi­nate casual fans with wnaker att11ndanee num­bnrs and reduen incidences or linn cutting on distribu­tion day. 
Wahoskn said that one of the main detriments to an inereasnd ticket allotment l'or the student section was the poor avnrage attel)­danen of tieknt holders, and that it was impnrativn for senators to nneouragn students to go to games. 

"You guys are leaders, so push for the necessity of students with tickets to come to games, so we can get more tiekcts in the future," he said. 
After Wahoske spoke, senators briefly discussed ways to improve the sys­tem. 
Welsh Family senator Stephanie Pelligra said that her dorm had already insti­tuted an informal system of exchange within the dorm. Other senators were eneouraged to talk with their hall governments about doing the same until a campus-wide system could be devised. 
The issue was sent to tlw University Affairs commit­tee for further investiga­tion and discussion. 
In other Senate news:

Academic Affairs commit­tee chair and head of the TCE project Vijay Hamanan said that the resolution had been intended to force the administration and faculty to act on the TCE concerns. However, after faculty members were reportedly "warm and open" to the proposal Monday's Faculty Senate meeting, the resolu­tion was deemed unneces­sary in its current form. 
Student body president Adam Istvan said that a more idea-specific resolu­tion would come to a Senate vote by Nov. 17.

Bin Laden releases new videotape 
CAIRO, Egypt-Terror mastermind Osama bin Laden claimed in new video footage broadcast Wednesday that President Bush ignored warnings against invading Iraq because he was dazzled by the country's "black gold" and ended up leading the United States into a quagmire. 
The full video, portions of which were broadcast Friday, was posted on a Web site used by Islamic groups Wednesday. The tape show the author of the Sept. 11 attacks accusing Bush of actfng out of what he calls "private" interests -and allusion to his oil business past. 
Bush ignored the warnings because "the darkness of the black gold blurred his vision and insight, and he gave priority to private interests over the public interests of America," bin Laden says in the portions of the tape that the Arab network Al-Jazeera did not broadcast Friday. 
Muslim violence closes schools 
BANGKOK, Thailand -Violence in Thailand's Muslim-dominated south forced hundreds of schools to close Wednesday, while two lawmakers scuffled in parliament over the government's handling of a riot in the region last week that left 85 people dead. 
Warnings that Muslim insurgents may try to abduct Buddhist teachers and students prompted most schools in the country's three southernmost provinces of Narathiwat, Yala and Pattani to shut until at least Monday, education officials said. 
The closed schools were in the countryside where they cannot easily be protected. Schools in urban areas mostly remained open.

Kerry decides to concede election 
BOSTON-Notwithstanding his athleticism and fighting spirit, Sen. John Kerry waged an occasionally awkward, run-walk-run cam­paign, a maTathon bedeviled by his slow start and a lumbering response to attacks by the Swift Boat veterans. 
''I'm sorry that we got here a little bit late and little bit short," Kerry told a crowd of family, friends· and staff Wednesday at Faneuil Hall as he formally ended the race. 
In what seems like ages ago, the Massachusetts senator began the campaign with a certain appeal for Democrats deter­mined to oust President Bush -a decorated Vietnam War record to counter the com­mander in chief, a wealthy spouse even if she could only contribute a limited amount and an experienced campaign team. 

Bush claims re-election mandate 
WASHINGTON -President Bush claimed a re-election mandate Wednesday after a record 59 million Americans chose him over Democrat John Kerry and voted to expand Republican control of Congress as well. He pledged to pursue his agenda on taxes and Iraq while seeking "the broad support of all Americans." 
Kerry conceded defeat in make-or-break Ohio rather than launch a legal fight reminis­cent of the contentious Florida recount of four years ago. "I hope that we can begin the healing," the Massachusetts senator said.

Leaders offer to let bygones be bygones as they hope for changes in foreign policy

PARIS -European allies alienated by President Bush's first four years in power offered Wednesday to let bygones be bygones, saying they want to work with the new administra­tion and seeking, right from Day 1, to get the new White House to listen more to overseas opinion. 
French President Jacques Chirac, in a con­gratulatory letter, said he hoped Bush's second term "will be the occasion for strengthening the French­American friendship." 
"We will be unable to find satisfying responses to the numerous chal­lenges that confront us today without a close trans-Atlantic partner­ship," wrote Chirac. He addressed the letter to "Dear George."

Tallying continues despite concession 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -The count­ing of more than 150,000 provi­sional ballots cast in Ohio will go forward, despite John Kerry's concession that President Bush had won the state's 20 electoral votes, election officials said Wednesday. 
Elections workers planned to spend the next 10 days verifying that each provisional voter lives in the precinct where he or she cast a ballot and RJ.eets age and citizenship requirements. 
"The pressure is off in the eyes of the media," said Jeff La Rue, spokesman for the Franklin County Board-ofl!lections. "The pressure to count every vote and validate every vote that is a valid vote -that pressure is never off." 
Provisional ballots -required in all states for the first time this year -are used when voters believe they are properly regis­tered but their names do not appear in registration records. 
The ballots are counted later if election officials determine the voters' registrations are valid. 
Kerry acknowledged Wednesday in his concession speech that the provisional votes would not be enough for him to win the state, where President Bush had a lead of 136,000 votes. 

Mark Weaver, a lawyer for Ohio Republicans, predicted that elec­tion officials would throw out most of the ballots after deter­mining the people who cast them were not eligible to vote.

One-third of' Hispanics said they were born-again Christians and nearly 20 percent listed moral values as their top issue, suggesting they have more. in common with Hepublicans than Democrats. 
The election also vindicated Bush's unorthodox strategy of governing from thn right and then targeting his voters with a volunteer-driven organization run through his campaign head­quarters. Kerry played to the center and relied on a loosely knit conglomerate of liberal groups who paid gnt-out-the-votn workers.

Young voters didn't increase their turnout as Democrats had hoped. Neither did blacks or union members, two keys to the party's base. 
Bush, meanwhile, saw a surge in rural and evangelical voters, according to strategists on both sides. The rural vote, once reli­ably Democratic, swelled in size and supported Bush over Kerry. 
In Ohio, exit polls suggested the rural vote increased from 15 . pnrcent of the electorate in 2000 to 25 percent on Tuesday. Hural voters backed Bush over Kerry 60 percent to 40. 
In Ohio and Florida, the two most important states Elnction Night, Democrats said they met their turnout targets, only to see Bush's forces trounce them. They said state ballot measures to ban gay marriage may have driven GOP voters to the polls. 
The most stinging defnat was in Ohio, which may no longer be considered a swing state. With 232,000 jobs lost under Bush and state voters uneasy about Iraq, it was as ripe as it will ever be for Democrats, strategists said. 
Ohio's 20 electoral votes gave Bush 279 in the Associated Press count, nine more than the 270 needed for victory. Kerry had 252 electoral votes, with Iowa's seven unsettled.

WASHINGTON -An empty subway train backnd into an occupied one Wednesday, injuring 20 people, transit offi­cials said.

IN BRIEF 
Businesses pleased with agenda 
NEW YORK-President Bush's re-election and the Republican Party's larger membership in the next Congress have made small business advocacy groups optimistic about some of the issues on their national agendas. 
The National Federation of Independent Business welcomed Bush's re-election in a statement Wednesday, and Dan Danner, the NFIB's senior vice president for public policy, said in an interview, "We believe very strongly that this president -probably more than any other in my recollection -has gone out of his way to be a supporter of small business." 
"We are optimistic that will continue," Danner said. 
With health care costs a major concern for business owners, the election has raised hopes that national association health plans will become a reality in the second Bush term. Under AHPs, small businesses can buy into group health insurance plans anywhere in the country, giving them greater leeway in shopping for a cheaper plan. 
Time Warner reports decline 
NEW YORK -Time Warner Inc., the world's largest media company, reported an 8 percent decline in third-quarter earnings Wednesday and set aside a $500 million reserve in anticipa­tion of settling government investigations into its bookkeeping. 
The company said it would restate earnings for 2000 and 2001 to correct its accounting for AOL Europe. 
The moves put the company a step closer to resolving the investigations, which have caused anxiety among investors after dragging on for more than two years. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice are still investigating accounting prac­tices at America Online, including its advertising arrangements and the way it reports subscriber numbers.m Inc., including the departure of Jonathan Dolgen, who had shared power with Lansing at Paramount. 
Dick Parsons, Time Warner's CEO, told investors and analysts on a conference call that while the investigations were ongoing, the com­pany had "some visibility" into the costs that would likely be required to resolve the inquiries.

Four executives convicted of fraud 
Merrill Lynch employees charged with conspiracy in first criminal trial of Enron 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -A jury con­victed four one-time Merrill Lynch executives and a former midlevel Enron Corp. finance exec­utive uf conspiracy and fraud Wednesday in the first criminal trial of Enron and Wall Street exec-utives for their role in the energy company's 2001 collapse. 
The deal at the center of the charges involved a bogus sale of interest in power plants mounted on barges to the brokerage at the end of 1999 so the company could appear t~ have met earnings targets. 
The barge case marked the first time Wall Street bankers were charged with active participation in a criminal Enron scheme. While Enron's former auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, was convicted more than two years ago of obstruction of justice for destroying Enron docu­ments before the collapse, the barge case was the first to involve former Enron employees as defen­dants.

Bloggers blamed for inaccuracies 
News organizations say online sources spread incorrect poll data 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -News organi­zations promised Wednesday to look into why their Election Day exit polls showed an ini­tial surge for John Kerry, but also blamed bloggers for spreading news that gave a misleading view of the presi­dential race. 
The exit poll data was deliv­ered at several points Tuesday to ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and The Associated Press by the National Election Pool, a com­pany formed in the wake of the networks' blown calls on election night 2000. 
The first wave showed Kerry with a lead of three percent­age points in Florida and four points in Ohio -both battle­ground states won were happy with it. But that was not good last night." 
Other network representa­tives said their confidence in NEP remained unshaken. 
The Florida and Ohio exit poll results, along with those in other states were Kerry was strong, was quickly dissemi­nated on Web sites such as Slate, the Drudge Report, 
But the people who read these numbers -among them, thousands of ordinary Americans with an intense interest in the election -put too much faith into them and leaped to conclusions, said Bill Schneider, CNN's polling expert. 
"I think people believed

expectations that may or may not be met. I think it's a good exercise because it reminded people that early exit polls can be unreliable." 
Bloggers picked out different numbers to use for their pur­poses, said Joseph Lenski, who ran the poll with partner Warren Mitofsky for the NEP. As the day wore on, later waves of exit polling showed the race tightening. 
"Doing an early poll is like reporting the results of the game at halftime," Lenski said. "You only have about a third of the information. No other survey research is held to that level of accuracy."

Marathon was a city long before it was a sporting event. It was at Marathon in 490 B.C.E. that 10,000 Athenians, aided by 1,000 Plataeans, faced the forces of the Persim1 emperor Darius. Despite being severely outnum­Peter Wicks bered, the Greeks won a decisive victory Englishman and sustained Abroad remarkably few casu­alties. 
Legend has it that after the battle the messenger Philippides ran the 25 miles from Marathon to Athens bearing the news. Upon arrival he exclaimed "Rejoice, we conquer," before collaps­ing dead from exhaustion. Since the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 athletes have run a similar distance to commemorate Philippides' achieve­ment, which has always seemed to me to rather miss the point of the story. 
Along with the battle of Salamis, the victory at Marathon saved Greece, the cradle ofWestem Civilization, from Persian conquest. Those who fought in the battle took great pride in their achievement. Aeschylus was the great­est of tragedians and yet his epitaph, which he wrote himself, does not men­tion his plays but instead identifies him as a veteran of Marathon. 
To understand the Greek view of war one must bPgin at the beginning, with llmner. Thomas Paine called Homer a warmonger, but actually he was some­thing more complex. lie celebrated heroism and martial prowess, but he was also acutely aware of the extent of the suffering that war produces. 
Salvador Dali once offered the dis­tinctly sub-Wildean aphorism, "Wars have never hurt anybody except the people who die." Homer knew better. The Iliad is sufl'used not only with death but with bereavement. Homer has Diomedes say, "lll-fated are those whose sons oppose my strength." A lesser poet would have written "Ill­fated are those who oppose my strength." The poem ends, not with the 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 
sacking of Troy, but with the funeral 
rites of Hector, the Trojan hero. The 
scene in which Hector's wife, 
Andromache, laments that without his 
father her son will not reach manhood 
is as moving as any in Western litera­
ture. 

It would be a misunderstanding to describe Homer's attitude to war as balanced. War was inevitable ­although some particular conflicts might be avoidable-and hence not the kind of thing that one could be for or against. And yet, alive to both the glory and the devastation of war, the blind bard of Ionia seems to have achieved a more stereoscopic view of war than most of the artists of the last century who took it as their theme. With some exceptions, the consensus of the creative class seems to have formed around what we might call the Apocalypse Now position: War is hell, next question. 
The controversy surrounding the invasion and occupation of Iraq has been a catalyst for questions about mil­itary recruitment. In the run-up to the election the national Rock the Vote campaign, along with other groups and campaigners, warned of the impending reintroduction of the draft. That many of those who made this warning felt no compunction about berating the Bush Administration for creating a "climate of fear" was of course hypocritical, but hardly surprising. 
There will not be a military draft in the United States in our lifetime. The bill to reintroduce the draft (which was defeated in the House of Representatives by 402 votes to 2) was sponsored by Hep. Charles Hangel, a Democrat concerned about the fact that the military disproportionately recruits from the poor and underprivileged, the attractiveness of a military career will naturally vary according to the other options that are available to you. 
A further problem arises when, as has bnen the case since the Vietnam era, the most privileged demographic in the United States, the graduates of the 
country's elite collBgcs, am the most 
likely to oppose the projection of' 
American military power abroad. 
Members of that elite may be reluctant 
to enlist knowing that there is a high 
chance that they will be asked to risk 
their lives in military actions which a 
substantial amount of their peers will 
regard as unjust. 
I cannot see any good solution to this problem. For that matter I cannot see any reason to believe that for every problem there must exist a good solu­tion. 
Next Thursday is Hemembrance Day in England, Veterans Day in the United States. Nov. 11 is the anniversary of the Armistice that ended the First World War, which was often called "the war to end all wars" -a phrase llomer would have dismissed as na'ive, and rightly so. 
At the center of the village in which I grew up there is a memorial to the sol­diers who lost their lives in the two world wars. As a member of the local Scout troop, each year I was required to attend the mflmorial service, which mostly involved standing outside in the rain. The solemnity of the occasion was not entirely lost on me, but I would bP lying if I said that I was lilled with pious sentiments towards those who fought and fell defending their country. But now I am grateful that I was made to attend those services. "Allez aIa messe," said Pascal, "et Ia foi vous vien­dra." Go to mass and faith will come. 
There is much to be said for going through the motions. The gratitude I now feel for those who gave what Lincoln call11d the "last full measure of devotion" is, I suspect, made possible by those November days in which wn stood in silence outside in the rain.

Revolt of the orange slice eaters 
When I was in 7th grade, I did what every red-blooded, Communist hating Indiana pre-teen does once in his life: I joined th~ junior high school basketball team. Now, I may have stood all of five feet flat and weighed 90 pounds dripping wet, but at the time I owned a pair of Reebok Pumps, so I had no doubt that I could be reasonably assured of a Larry Bird-esque ascension to Hoosier Hardwood glory.

These humble hoop dreams were quickly deflated when the reality of my-athletic ability hit me in the face. I mean that

Floor and I'm
Panthers, I was struck in the head by a rope of a pass so vio­
Laughing
lent that I can still make out the word SPALDING across my forehead. We had spent weeks practicing and mastering the bounce-pass, baseball-pass and no-look-pass, but no one had prepared me for the basketball-to-the-cranium pass. This illustrious beginning kicked-off an ath­letic career of bench-warming, day-dreaming, orange slice-eating and at least two broken bones. Oh, how I loved those half-time orange slices. 
As I enter the autumn of my sporting endeavors, however, I find myself in the bizarre position of high sovereign lord ruling over some of the National Football League's finest athletes. Each and every Sunday without fail seven All-Star cal­iber professionals line up at my very behest and answer to my beck and call. Two-time Super Bowl champion quarterback-and on-again, off-again beau of Tara Reid -Tom Brady takes his walking orders from a man who once ate 50 donut holes on a dare. Sticky-handed Steelers' receiver and all-around super freak athletic specimen Plaxico Burress has a dude who can't be troubled walk­ing all the way to the Hock deciding if he starts over the equally mind-blowing Isaac Bruce. 
In short, I have become a Fantasy Football franchise owner. 
My friend Joe, a recent Notre Dame alum, invited me into the league as a way of keeping in touch with mutual friends who have since graduated. We picked our athletes and gave our teams ridiculous names and decided exactly what color we wanted the lighting bolt on our helmets to be. We left jovial instant mes­sages and exchanged polite emails, wishing each other well on the {make­bP.lieve) field of {pretend) competition. 
This good-natured spirit of sportsmanship worked just fine until the first week of the season when we discovered the intoxicating blood-lust that accompanies destroying your good friend with a fictitious team of professional head-hunters. Our instant messages and emails these days would make Patton blush and I myself have sunk into such a state of unbridled coaching rage that even Bob Knight's professional sensibilities would be offended. As our young season moves along, I find myself at two major infuriating disadvantages which fuel this hyste­ria: my players stink and I don't scare anybody. However, my boys are pros and I trust they'll turn it around. We've been in worse spots. 
Ultimately, what I've learned as a pretend footballer is that the appeal of a Fantasy League is sp,lf-evident. It is, pure and simple, fantasy. Our generation grew up in the age of ESPN, maturing in a sport-centric universe that extolled the virtue of being "Like Mike." We are the young people of one sports-nation of the Adidas logo, for the Adidas logo, by the Adidas logo where you didn't get on the school bus until you saw the Top Ten plays of last night on the 7 a.m. Sportscenter. In Sports-Nation the Fantasy League becomes the great tool of ath­letic democracy. We, the average-athlete masses, rise to equal footing with the NFL's All-Pro aristocracy. We are the common bench-warming, orange slice­eaters ... but in a Fantasy League we get to be the hero on our childhood bed­room wall. 
But still I feel this isn't enough. In a truly democratic Sports-Nation, we orange-slice eaters wouldn't be relegated to the realms of internet fantasy. That's why today, inspired by my illuminating Fantasy experience, I advocate a full­scale bench-warmer revolution, a Bastille Day for the short and fat where we, as one body, take over our nation's athletic institutions and redistribute them to each according to his never-lettered-in-high-school needs. 
We must strike first with our local basketball team. Now. Mike Brey is one fan­tastic coach and one fantastic man. But he's just one man. One tie-hating man_. Thus, he should not be that difficult to lay siege upon him in the first battle of our Not-So-Hard-Worker's Revolution. Much like the first guns at Lexington and Concord, the Battle of the JACC Basketball Office will signal a new and glorious age of freedom from oppression. 
Ask yourself, wouldn't our team receive a greater benefit from having the col­lective will of 10,000 non-varsity students all at once deciding if Jordan Cornette should shoot the 3 or pass the ball? Isn't such a democratic coaching theory more akin to the ideals of our Founding Fathers? Wouldn't coaching the Irish make me feel better about the time when I scored two points for the opposing team? The answers are "yes!" and "shoot!"

Politicians promise to 
The Oracle 
bring change to our lives. The signs dearly show all around us that they did exactly that during this election cycle. Hundreds of thousands of people registered to vote for this election. Dozens waited in lines for hours to mark their ballots early. And as Rev. Jessie Jackson said this week on 95.7 The Beat's morning gospel show, young black men in America have gone from planning funerals to planning futures. His comments referred to celebrities such as hip-hop mogul Sean "P. Diddy" Combs and Def Jam Records founder Russell Simmons encouraging voter participation. 
Former President Bill Clinton said during a Wild 98.7 interview Tuesday morning that this country will live with the results of this year's election for the next 20 years. But beyond the policies that our newly and re-elected officials will create, we are a nation that has been awakened. 
The elections four years ago came at the eve of our politically conl')cious resurrection. The Sept. 11 attacks hadn't happened yet. And most Americans couldn't spell Condoleezza Rice, let alone even knew that she's the U.S. national security advisor. Since Sept. 11, our nation has paid more attention to who runs our country. We know their names, and Tuesday we showed up at the polls in droves to give thumbs up or thumbs down to our elected officials. 
Politics and religion remain two subjects you learn to avoid at any social gathering. You still may not sit at a bar and discuss the war in Iraq, but there's a chance that while walking to class you had a conversation about the differences between the RepHblicans and the Democrats. From the Mel Martinez and Betty Castor U.S. Senate campaign attack ads to celebrity endorse­ments, discussing politics has gained popu­larity. 

Don't let the disappointing outcome of a race in this year's election cause you to turn your back on our democracy. Use the les­sons you've learned and the contacts you've made to fuel your interest and participation year round. · 
Don't wait another four years for a major election to get involved. Stay involved. 
This year's election marked the beginning of a revolution in the United States. Keep in mind that the uprising should be a peaceful one. No doubt there will be days of contest­ed results ahead of us in some races. The campaign sign stealing that has been a problem around Tampa Bay this year was like a side show to the main event. One would almost have expected to hear an announcer say at the dose of the polls Tuesday, "Let's get ready to rumble!" A radio personality on 970 WFLA joked that we'll need some kind of spray to get rid of the attorney stench once this is over and every race has a clear winner. 
To other countries, we may seem like a nation divided. I say we are a nation ignit­ed. 
We've survived pregnant and hanging chads and butterfly ballots. The person who is in office doesn't change the fact that you still have a voice. 
Thank you to all those who worked tire­lessly this year to advocate for change. Thank you to all those who voted. And a special thank you to those who woke up Tuesday morning and pledged to finish the work they started by remaining politically aware and socially active.

Bush should open oil reserves for winter 
After the 1973-7 4 oil embargo, a Strategic Petroleum Reserve was estab­lished to protect against future crises. The reserve was placed on the Gulf of Mexico and consisted of a number of gigantic salt caves. The science

tower could be dumped into with room to spare, was originally perfected by oil companies along the Gulf. The United States government bought a few caves from them and then drilled many more, creating a space that now has a capacity of 727 million barrels. 
The circumstances in which petroleum can be withdrawn from the reserves are outlined in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act {EPCA). For a full draw­down of the reserves, the president must deem there is an energy shortage that would adverse}y affect either national security or the national economy. However, a limited drawdown of resources may occur if this action would aid in a circum­stance in which there is a supply shortage, and thus lessen the effects of the crisis. 
President George W. Bush ordered the reserves filled in 2001, and as of this September the reserves were nearing capacity at 669 million barrels. It is on track to be filled by July 2005. 

OPEC asked the United States on Oct. 27 to dip further into its reserves. OPEC President Purnomo Yusgiantoro was quot­ed as saying, "We have qsked them [the United States I to use their oil reserves to help cool down the prices." 
With gas well above $2 and winter com­ing, requiring still more oil for heating, one must ask why the Bush administration has only loaned out oil from the reserves in small, insignificant amounts. The govern­ment should open the reserves more to help families in need, since heating bills will have doubled since several years ago. If the government won't help the prices of fuel for cars, it should help keep us warm. 
If the government is truly confident that everything will be fme, then there should be no hesitation in releasing the reserves to aid citizens. Unless, that is, the govern­ment is not confident that it will not need the Strategic Petroleum Reserves later. If the Bush administration wants us to believe everything will return to normal , once Mexico and Nigeria get their produc­tion on track, and we're not in the early stages of peak oil, it should convey that confidence by aiding its own people.

ALBUM REVIEWS 
Kweli's latest not up to par 

The Explosion shreds through 'Black Tape' 

By KENYATTA STORIN A'sistaut Scone Editor 
On his last album, .lay-Z rappnd, "If' skills sold, truth lw told, I'd probably bn lyrkally, Talib Kwnli." 
II' anyorw is worthy of' such a eompliment it would surnly bn Talib Kwnli. Sinen l!JlJH, whnn hn and Mos Dd' blow crities away with t.hnir dw.;sit~ album. "BI<u~k Star~" Kwnli hw.; mnsistnntly wowed rritics with a flow that is both skilll'ul and intnllnetual. Contrary to most of tlw rap you hPar on tlw radio, which is of'tnn about as thought provoking as a Schwarzmwggnr flit~k. Kwnli raps about sod­ntal issuns, with an nmphasi'i on tlw harsh rnalit.ies or lif'n. But despitn his eritical an~lairn and skillful llow, hn has always flut­tered ju~t undemnatl1 mainstmarn populari­ty. 
In "Tim Beautiful Struggle," Kweli dearly trins to ridn on .Jay-Z's shout out and bridgP the gap f'rom underground to mainstrnam. a.:; it is by l'ar his most commen:ial album to date. Kweli arms himsnlf witll a slew of' hit­making weapons, bringing in popular pro­dueers The Noptunes, Kanyn West and Just Blaze, as wnll as radio-li-inndly singers Mary .1. Blign, Anthony Hamilton and Faith Evans. lie nven brings back old partner, DJ lli-Tek, who lwlped jumpstart Kweli's <:arnnr. On paper, "The Bnautif'ul Struggle" h<L'> thn mak­ings or a pop-juggernaut likP Kanyn West's "Collngn Dropout." llowever, a.'i it turns out, whiln Kweli's rhymes are strong lor the most part, his supporting east lets him down and the result is an awkward album that is not eatehy nnough li>r li>llowers of' mainstream hip-hop, and may alienate some of' hi.., long­time underground fans. 
Kwnli is afton called a political rapper, and he dearly takes offense to this, for on the title trark of tile album, Kweli raps "They call me the political rapper I Even af'tnr I toll 'em I don't lexpletivel with polities." Even though he is political in tl1e sense tllat he addresses important political issues in his rhymes, there is certainly some truth to his words beeausn he does not tell listeners to eondemn a particular political party or take political action. Instead his rhymes are more about the trials and tribulations of' lifo, which he calls a "beautiful struggle" in rnlcrenee to the album's title. 
Under this general theme, Kweli rellects on a number of diffnrcmt topies and the results are generally quite satisfying, and often rather provocative. On "We Got the Beat" he urges people to bn wary of igno­rance: "It don't matter if you're Muslim, llnbrew, or you a Christian I Information is the newest relihrion." And on "Around My Way" he criticizes Americans who suddnnly became patriotic after 9111: "The way be saluting flags I Wrapping tllem around our heads I When [people] ain't beeome Amnrican till 9111." 
Kweli's only real lyrieal misstep is "We Know," a love song with mundann lines like, "Hey baby I Look like you need a break tonight I Let me make it right, baby, won't you stay tile night." 
Despite Kwoli's generally strong lyricism, none of' tile songs really draw you in as much a.'i they should primarily beeause of a lack of' strong beats and occw,;ionally weak chorus­es. The production showcases a wide range of' diJlcrent styles, but after a lew listens, it loses much of its charm. Even The Neptunes' "Broken Glass," Kanyc West's "I Try" and DJ lli-Tnk's iliree traeks, do not match tile quali­ty of tll(~ir past work. This is not to say that the heaL'> are bad, but rather that they simply do not quito rnaeh tile high bar set by previ­ous Kweli efforts. 
While most of tile choruses work, a hand-

Kwnli is an imprnssivo MC, but he might bn better oil' going back to his rooL'i in futurP albums. "The Beautiful Struggle" has its moments, especially lyrimlly, but overall it lacks the unique sound and fi.1el of hi'> previ­ous albums. Altl10ugh tim so-so production is not entirely Kwnli's fault, his dncision to usn pop produeers in thn first placn is question­able. Simply put, Kweli tries too hard to join the ranks of mainstream rappers, and it dearly shows.

.I ust whnn you havn fidlen oil' your skate­board and you cannot seem to find any glass to smash The Explosion comes out with "Biark Tape." 
llailing from Boston, The Explosion touts a blue-eollar harder-than-thou attitude. "Biat~k Tap<1" features straightforward punk rock very similar to The Explosion's prnvious rnleasns. "Street Punk" or 70's styln punk are the easiest terms to use when classifying this album. Simple guitar rifTs and repnating chanting vocals ·will rmnind listnnnrs of a more produced ver­sion of old school punk bands.. Power chord aftor power chord. The Explosion knops tim short. fa'it, loud 1~ulturn moving. 
The lyrical contnnt of "Black Tape" stays trun to punk rockers everywhere. There is not one song about girls or love, yet the album is extrnmely romantic. The album romanticizes being dedicated to your beliefs and loyalty to your friends the only way distortf~d guitars and scratchy vocals can. With lines like "We both know that pnople eome and go I But it's alright cuz good friends never din" and "Facing truth is in our blood," "Black Tape" is perfect background music when you an1 slapping high lives with buddies. 
The band's front man, Million Dollar Matt lloek, has a gorgeous voice. lie rasps and chants with punchy energy, but beneath the gravely voeals his voice finds a melody that works remarkably well. His voiee porfeetly compliments "Black Tape's" lyrical content. Hoek sings about being battle-hardened and the modern revolu­tion in an optimistie way. Listening to him sing feels authentie, like he's been there, or at least his voeal chords have.

hand, it is a whole lot of fun, and perfect for singing along or playing air guitar. But on the other hand, it offers very little in terms of' originality. There is next to noth­ing that sets this album apart from other list-pumping punk outlits. 
The first spin of this album is a rush. It opens with "Deliver Us" which begins with some funky feedback that leads intJ ring­ing guitar ehords until a pick slido cues havoc in the mosh pit. The very first lyrics of the album lets the listener know what they aro in for: "Give us this day our daily dead." 
From here "Black Tape" has several hard and true punk traeks like "Filthy Insane" and "Go Blank," both of' whieh quickly repeat their respective titles over and over again. These songs will please harder punk fans but 
The Explosion also has some more bal­lad style roek songs. "lleavyweight" gently roeks at a slower pace but still maintains a thrashing naturo. 
"Blaek Tape's" first Iiston is high-energy and diverse enough for tho listener to want to put the thirty-seven minute disc right back into the player. But after a fnw listnns the album does not really endure. Some of the traeks are vory catchy and memorabh1, keeping the listener coming back for morn, but on the whole tho album gets a little boring. Hepcat listening is the downfall of' this album. 
For artistic, intolligent, soft music ignoro The Explosion, but if' you want l'urious, gutsy punk roek, piek up "Biaek Tape."

More like going out of business 
By BRODERICK HENRY Scene Music Critic 
There is no love lost between Jay-Z and H. Kdly. 
A string of eaneelled shows at the onset of a tour in support of their new release, "Unfinished Business," already had fans and musie insiders speculat­ing about the relationship between the two hip-hop stars. Such speculation has only been fueled by a recent con­cert appearance at New York's Madison Square Garden in which Kelly was aetually pepper sprayed by a member of Jay-Z's entourage. In response to the aforementioned event, on a New York radio station Jay-Z described Kelly as a jealous egomaniac. and Kelly portrayed .Jay-Z as an unsympathetic friend who was willing to permit woeful stage pro­duction. Clearly, this exchange has done little to alleviate the tense situa­tion. 
These recent events beg the question: why did these two giants of urban music join together to create a second collaborative album? 
The artists' first collaboration, "Best of Both Worlds," can easily be catego­rized as disappointing. Commercially, the album did not move a million units and fan support for the album was minimal at best. Also, at this point in their careers neither needs a spark if you consider that Jay-Z has retired as a solo artist, and Kelly's latest release from a little over two months ago has been a solid hit. 
Whatever the reason, the two should have stayed far away from each other, for "Unfinished Business" is unques­tionably the most abysmal effort from either of the stars. Overall, the album is characterized by the reluctance of either performer to explore his artistic abilities as he would usually on his own album. As a result, each relies heavily on the other to pick up the slack, but neither does. Fans of Jay-Z's last release will not find the artist who answered the questions surrounding the lack of a father in his life and the impact of life in the ghetto. Those same fans hoping Kelly would bring some of his "Chicago-step" flavor and R&B standards will be surprised to discover there is not a hint of either on this album. 


Instead, what listeners will find is that "Unfinished Business" sounds a lot like music they have heard before. In fact a number of the album's tracks are tweaked up versions of songs that were on "Best of Both Worlds." 
Regrettably, the producers of the album, Trackmasters, have not had a real hit in close to five years. Their staccato beats, equipped with a fair share of tired guitar and piano melodies sound like something straight out of 1998. Jay-Z's lackluster rhymes focus on his new Maybach, girls and homes, and Kelly's constant sex talk­ing, fail to provide a reprieve from the albums lackluster production. Undoubtedly, at this point in their careers neither should be rhyming or singing on a track that sounds like something his cousin produced in his basement studio. 

Occasionally, Kelly and Jay-Z find a way to remind listeners why they love their music. "Feelin You in Stereo" serves as a fine example. On the track, Jay-Z states that everything cannot be hardcore and allows Kelly to sing in the rap/singing style for which he has become famous. Jay-Z also adds a verse with an atypical rhyme pattern that is clean and suits the song perfect­ly. "Mo' Money" also a reused track is the only other standout. 
Overall. "Unfinished Business" is aptly titled. It definitely sounds like it is unfinished. Much is left to the imagina­tion, and it is clear this merger is fated to go out of business.

Action Action has impressive debut 
By MARTY SCHROEDER 
Scene Music Critic 
Action Action's -debut album on Victory Records includes some of the best emo songwriting to come out in a long time. 
It takes the synth of emo godfathers, The Get Up Kids, a step further, and also just plain rocks out. "Don't Cut your Fabric to This Year's Fashion" is an amazing blend of the "I just broke up with my girlfriend and it reeeeaaly hurt" mentality combined with a matu­rity that is rarely seen in an emo release. This album also makes some departures from the traditional emo­fuzzy guitars with a dash of heart­break recipe. Synths, loops, and sequencers play along side the guitars and drums. 
The opening track, "This Year's Fashion," meanders through a weave of synth pop and crunchy guitars. This song displays some of the emotional tendencies of the band when frontman Mark Thomas Kluepfel croons, "Sweeten my tea you lied, you lied, you lied I you've got your hands around my throat I you're got your eyes inside my back." However, these typical lyrics are countered by the opening lines, "Head trip on the scene again, pump­ing in the veins of the rabid mouths to feed. I head back, obsolete I trapped with the secrets that I cannot keep today." These lyrics will not be heard from the slew of punk "boy-bands" out there. Action Action is emotional but they write with a maturity that puts them a cut above the rest. 

"Photograph" is the first real upbeat song on the album and mixes a sugar­coated Andrew WK melody, which is actually quite disarming. Dan Leo's drums drive this song forward and Adam Manning's guitar adds the emo­tional punch to Kluepful's lyrics: "And I never should have kissed those lips before I I never should've let you out my door." 
"Instructions on Building a Model Airplane" is the hardest song on the album, giving more attention to tradi­tional rock and less on the synths, even though they still play a part. This song is the sonic pinnacle of the album as it tears through its 2:28 track time, making it the shortest track on the album. 
However, after putting the pedal to the floor with that track, Action Action slows it down on the next song, "A Simple Question." A wandering synth loop guides the first half of this song as Kluepfel laments on a relationship turned sour. About halfway through this song, however, the pace picks up and Kluepfel's keyboards and Manning's guitar walk hand-in-hand with a sound that ends the song on a happy note even though its lyrics are of a more morose nature. 

Perhaps the most visceral song on this album is the closing track. "The Short Weekend Begins with a Longing." Keyboards open this track, as Clarke Foley's thumping bass kicks in. The title gives away the theme of this song: contradiction. The chorus is a pleading "And when I get to dig too deep I when I get too high (I'll never ask of you I I'll ask oO and when I talk too much I don't talk enough (I'll never ask of you I I'll ask oO." These lyrics run from the microphone like a teenager running into his room after his first heartbreak. The emotion is palpable and when Kluepfel yells, "And when I fall apart over the week­end I and the pills begin to stop work­ing,"· the seriousness of this song is made apparent. 
Action Action will make you laugh, and they will make you cry. They take emo and indie roek and meld the two with keyboards and mature song writ­ing. This mixture of rock and synths is the next step in the world of popular rock music and Action Action have proven that they will be one of the har­bingers of this trend with "Don't Cut your Fabric to This Year's Fashion."

considerations... 
What are YOU doing here? 
by Courtney Schuster Intern, Campus Ministry 
We all know when it hits. You're running to La Fun because the COMO cluster is closed for a class. They have classes in there? It's a cluster not a classroom. Quick, no time to worry about that. You've got a co-ree game tonight and hall council is at 10. Shoot! There is no paper in the printer. Class starts in ... it started 5 minutes ago. Great, your cell phone is ringing, now your roommate wants to borrow your car. You just want to get that paper off your hands. Your group needs to meet tonight to go over tomorrow's presentation. Ugh! You shouldn't have gone to bed last night. .. 
You're ready to throw in the towel when the BIG question hits~-WHAT are you doing here anyway? 
Have you asked yourself that lately? You know, between that job interview and your Meijer run? 
I don't mean, 'What are you physically doing here at NO?" I mean the BIG, 'What are you DOING here, as in with your life?" Whether you're a freshman and you're just getting started or you've only got a semester and a half to go ... between all the running around have you thought about what you're really here to do? 
Have you taken time to slow down? Taken time to reflect? When's the last time you really cleared your mind? Went for a walk? Intentionally found silence? 
! graduated last May. I was your typical Hail President, super-fan run around in circles, I have three meetings at the same time, but I do-this-because-it's-fun kind of girl. Until somewhere along the way, between an interview with General Mills and the ACE information session, it hit me. I spent four years making great friends and doing a lot, but I was not really sure where I was going or why. 
And then after 21 years, I decided to learn how to listen. It wasn't easy. First I had to see the clutter rn my life, put it to the side and be silent. Who am I? What am I going to do? I made time. What is important to me? How am I to love? Finally, I could listen. What is God telling me to do? 
Suddenly, running around the lakes wasn't just exercise; it was reflection time. Eating alone wasn't just a quick embarrassing trip to the DH; it was my time to be quiet No plans on Friday night became my time to read. 
People find peace in many ways, through the liturgy, journaling, meditation, artwork or a walk around the lakes. How do you find time to listen? We are all called to do God's work, but first we need to listen to what God is telling us to do. 
In addition to everything else, allow your time Notre Dame to be time for contemplation and growth. Take an hour for daily Mass. Spend some time in your dorm chapel journaling. Take a walk to the Grotto after class. Just be. 
So, keep running around. Make sure you soak in every last speaker, late night pizza party, sporting event, and service project Notre Dame has to offer. BUT, take time to ask yourself the big questions ... and more importantly, LISTEN to what God has to say. 
A: 
Images of Jesus, Mary, and the saints have been used by Christians for devotional & decorative purposes since the very beginning of Christianity. Their purpose in our midst serves to remind us of those who are the focus ofour Christian worship (the Holy Trinity) or those we love, honor, and respect for having lived the model Christian fife (ie, Mary &the saints). In our everyday lives, this resembles our use of family photos to remind us ofthose we love. Just as we would never value the photos more than the people themselves, the images in our churches are never the object of our worship. Rather, the use of statues & icons should only seek to draw us closer to our loving God.

Ingredients: Most energy drinks usually contain high sugar content, water, vitamins, minerals, caffeine, and/or some other type of stimulant. 
*17u:' vitamins and minerals contained in energy drinks are alreadv supplemented in our bodies through good diet. There is not need for supplemental doses of these vitamins and minerals unless prescribed by a doctor. 
*Depending on the energy drink they can contain up to three or four means of caffeine and or sedatives. 
 Ca!Teine (typically the amount in 2.5 Cokes) Cfuarana (calleine-Iife stimulant from Brazil) Taurine (stimulant) Ephedrine (stimulant banned by NCAA) Bitter Orange Extract or Citrus Aurantium (stimulant banned by the NCAA, same properties as Ephedrine) Crreen Tea (stimulant) Kola Nut (stimulant) Ma llaung (stimulant) Crinscng (herbal stimulant) Crinkgo Biloha (herbal stimulant) Mate (caffeine-like) Kava Ka\·a (traditional Polynesian sedative) 
What does this mean when mixed with alcohol? 
Caffeine and alcohol arc a dangerous combination. Both arc diuretics (cause dehydration) and as a result the drink causes: 
 
A greater likelihood of hangovers. 

 
J\ masking of the intoxication level. 

 
J\ tem.Icncy to drink for longer periods of time due to the stimulant keeping one awake. 

 
A risk of complications by ingestion of a heavy depressant and heavy stimulant to the body. 

 
Deaths have been linked to the severe dehydration. 


What does this mean as an athlete'! 
 
Ephedrine and caffeine together has been proven to cause deadly hem1 problems . 

 
Bitter Orange extract is banned by the NCAA . 


Issues of Concern 

*The FDA cannot authorize or test dietary supplements such as Energy Drinks (which means no quality standards.) 
*Supplement manufacturers do not have to provide information to the FDA before they market a product. (I low do you know what you arc getting?) 
*Companies do not have to prove safqty or efficacy before selling supplements. ('l11cy do not have to put a warning label about the dangers or the deaths that have occurred.) 
 
Drinking energy drinks before performance can severely dehydrate you and maybe linked to several athlete deaths . 

 
Energy drinks can cause over-stimulation of the heart, high blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmia .

Associated Press 
PIIILADELPIIIA Charlie Manuel will be the next manager of the Philadelphia Phillies, replacing the fired Larry Bowa, baseball officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday night. 
Manuel will be intro­duced at a news confer­ence Thursday or Friday, one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Two other sources also said Manuel was the team's choice. 
Manuel's hiring was first reported by The Philadelphia Inquirer. 
The 60-year-old Manuel managed the Cleveland Indians from 2000-02. He takes over a talented but underachieving club that hasn't reached the play­offs since 1993. 
Phillies general manag­er Ed Wade didn't imme­diately return a phone message Wednesday night. 
Manuel spent the last two seasons working as a special assistant to Wade. He was the second of eight candidates inter­viewed by the Phillies after Bowa was fired with two games remaining in a disappointing season in which the Phillies finished 10 games behind first-place Atlanta in the NL East. 

Manuel, Jim Leyland and Jim Fregosi were the three finalists for the job, according to one of the sources. Fregosi managed the Phillies to the NL pen­nant 11 years ago. Leyland led Florida to its first World Series champi­onship and guided Pittsburgh to three divi­sion titles in the '90s. 
Manuel had a 220-190 record with the Indians and led them to the AL Central championship in 2001, but was fired after a 39-47 start in 2002. 
Known as a player's manager, Manuel is close with Phillies first baseman Jim Thome, who thrived in Cleveland when Manuel was the Indians' hitting coach. 
Manuel's affable person­ality and folksy nature make him the anti-Bowa. Though he was popular among fans in Philadelphia, Bowa wasn't well-liked by some of his players because of his fiery demeanor. 
Manuel also beat out former major league man­agers Grady Little, Don Baylor, Buddy Bell, and Braves hitting coach Terry Pendleton and Pirates third-base coach John Hussell.

Brown has hip surgery, out 
seven to 10 days 
.AUBUHN HILLS, Mich. -Pistons coach Larry Brown had surgery on his left hip Wednesday and is expect­ed to be away from the team for seven to 10 days. 
Assistant coach Gar Heard will run the NBA champions during Brown's absence. Heard coached the Dallas Mavericks in 1993 and the Washington Wizards in 2000. The 64-year-old Brown could return in time for Detroit's home against Minnesota on Nov. 17. 
"I talked to the doctors in the oper­ating room, and they told me that seven to 10 days is a conservative estimate," Pistons president Joe Dumars said. "It all depends on how Larry is feeling, but that's what we are looking at." 
Brown had his hip replaced 15 years ago, and this latest operation was the result of wear on the artifi­cial joint. It had recently caused him severe pain, the team said. 
Brown is expected to spend two to thme days in the hospital. Dumars wasn't sure what kind of rehabilita­tion his coach faces. Seau to miss rest of season 
with torn pectoral muscle 

DAVIE, Fla. -Junior Seau avoided a major injury for 15 NFL seasons ­until now. 
A torn pectoral muscle has ended Seau's season, and perhaps his career. The Miami Dolphins line­backer will undergo an operation Thursday in his hometown of San Diego, and he'll decide later whether to return in 2005. 
"Of course, I will play again," Seau said with a grin Wednesday. 'Til say that now. But that could change tomorrow.... Assessing my situation after surgery is definitely going to be something that I need to do." 
Seau, 35, has missed only nine games during his career. In an emo­tional farewell speech to his team­mates, the former Pro Bowl line­backer said he regretted leaving when the Dolphins (1-7) have the NFI:s worst record. 
"That's the toughest thing," he said. "I wanted to fight through it with the men in that locker room.... I shared with them how hard it is going to be, and how to persevere during these times. The only way through this is by loving the game."Predators center Zholtok

NHL 
All-Star weekend cancelled due to lockout 

Players, owners face loss of entire season 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-In another sign the NIIL season is slipping away, the league canceled its All-Star game Wednesday because of the lockout. 
No regular-season games have been played since the season was scheduled to begin Oct. 13, and NHL arenas have been given the go-ahead to release dates on a 45-day rolling basis. With the All-Star game now off the sched­ule, the next announcement could be the cancellation of the entire season. 
"To call off something that's a lot of fun for the fans to enjoy is a shame," nine-time All-Star Jeremy Roenick of the Philadelphia Flyers told The Associated Press. "It has no bearing on anything. They still haven't canceled games in January. Why haven't they can­celed games in January but they're canceling the All-Star game?'' 
Bill Daly, the league's chief legal officer, said this decision "is hot tactical at all," saying it was more of a practical decision to free up blocks of hotel rooms and other facilities that would've been needed. 
"We had to make a decision on whether making those advance commitments made sense," Daly said in Dallas prior to an open forum with fans. "Given where

we are with the status of our negotiations, it didn't warrant making those commitments.... It's not tactical at all." 
The lockout, now in its 49th day, was imposed by commis­sioner Gary Bettman after the collective bargaining agreement expired on Sept. 15. Bettman declined comment on the cancel­lation of the game, which was scheduled to be held in Atlanta in February. 
The NHL and the play~rs asso­ciation haven't met since Sept. 9 and have no plans to return to the bargaining table.

Over 70 players got together in Toronto on Tuesday to get an update from union leadership. The meeting came after a hand­ful of the more than 700 mem­bers said they would be willing to play under a salary-cap system or would return to the ice next season if the NHL decided to use replacement players if a deal wasn't reached. 
The NHLPA made the last pro­posal in September, a plan cen­tered around a luxury tax instead of a salary cap. The NHL rejected it because the league says that won't achieve "cost

The lockout during the 1994­95 season also forced the All­Star game to be canceled. 
"I don't know if it's so much a ploy as to get anybody all riled up or nervous that they're can­celing stuff like that," Roenick said. "I don't think it changed the mind-frame of what the PA is getting behind." 
The previous lockout ended when an agreement was reached in January 1995. Each team then played a 48-game schedule. 
A new deal would have to be reached by the same time in this season for any part of the cam­paign to be salvaged. 
"The season is likely to slip away," Bettman said in an inter­view this week with TSN in Canada. "Whether or not we miss half a season or three-quar­ters of a season, or don't have a season at all that is not the issue from our standpoint. We need a deal that is the right deal to address the problems and let us go forward.

''I'm hopeful that there will be a season, but I have to tell you, there's a good chance there won't be," Goodenow said. 
Atlanta would've held its third All-Star game in five years, after hosting the Major League Baseball and NBA events. The weekend scheduled for Feb. 12­13 would've been the first time the Thrashers, who began play in 1999, served as the host. 
"This is another unfortunate casualty of the owners' decision to lock out the players and shut down the game," said Ted Saskin, the NHLPA senior direc­tor. "Players would obviously have enjoyed participating in an All-Star Game that could have helped build interest for hockey in Atlanta." 
In the NHL's statement, the league said the earliest Atlanta can hold All-Star weekend is 2008 since the 2006 game has already been awarded to the Phoenix Coyotes and plans for the 2007 game are near comple­tion. 
"We apologize to the fans, to the city of Atlanta, to the Thrashers and to all those who already have devoted so much effort to planning this important hockey celebration," said Frank Supovitz the group vice president of NHL events and entertain­ment. 
Waddell said league officials made it clear that Atlanta would be one of the first cities in line for the next available All-Star game. 
"We're more disappointed about where we are with the season, but with the All-Star game we would have had an opportunity to showcase our city and our great venue," Waddell said.

Walsh, Welsh renew rivalry 
By TOM DORWART Sports Writer 
After a dramatic, come­from-behind victory in the quarterfinals, the No. 2 Welsh Family Whirlwinds ride their momentum into a semifinal showdown with the No. 3 Walsh Wild Women. 
"We're ready to play," Welsh wide receiver Kelly Bushelle said. 
Tonight at 8 p.m. at McGlinn fields, Welsh and Walsh collide for a spot in the championship. With their seasons and goals on the line, the two teams head into the contest fired up. 
"It's going to be a tough game. We both have good teams," Welsh offensive line­man Whitney Endsley said. "It's a huge game, and no one wants their season to end." 
The Whirlwinds came from 13 down against Brecn-Phillips for the 22-19 win. This time around, they know they must play a complete game. 
"We didn't play up to our potential,;, Welsh center Katie Heynolds said. "We turned it around after halftime and picked up the intensity." 
The Wild Women pulled out a nail-biter of their own in their 12-7 semifinal win against P.W. Walsh captain Carrie Campbell expects an even tighter game tonight. 
"We saw them [Welsh I play 
B.P. the other day," she said. "They're a really good team. Welsh Fam has been kind of a rivalry; it's a longtime rivalry." 
The rivalry stems from Walsh's 2001 semifinal loss to Welsh during Campbell's fresh­man season. 
"They beat us a couple of years back when l was a fresh­man. We're out for some revenge," Campbell said. 
Welsh and Walsh each use their own unique methods for rational movies," Campbell said. "We watched 'Hemember the Titans."' 
The Whirlwinds know they'll be facing an inspired Walsh defense. Walsh lost cornerback Katie Ilesmond during the final regular season game due to a sprainnd ankle. 
"We'rn facing one of the toughest defenses in the league," Welsh quarterback Melissa Sands said. 
They might not have watched "Hemember the Titans," but tho Whirlwinds certainly have motivation. 
"This is the game that wP lost last year [the semil'inal game]. so obviou~ly we're motivated," Sands said. 
"It's been a great season; everyone's really excited," Campbell said. "This is a game we've been looking forward to a lot. What better place to play a rival than in the semifinal?"

Irish offer problems for tired Volunteers 

By PAT LEONARD A,sociare Sports Editor 
Tennessee opened its season against UNLV and had an early bye week. But the Volunteers' game against Notre Dame Saturday will be their eighth straight, and the coaches are letting people know it. 
"I would have liked to have [the schedule format] changed," Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said. "But, I think it came out of the Memphis game where they had to change that game with them canceling and finding a time 
when Louisiana Tech could play." 
Notre Dame is coming off a much-needed bye week. The Irish are 23-2 all-time coming out of bye weeks. 
"The other thirtg is that ... we are about to go to 12 games sooner or later," Fulmer said. "They need to look at that, · because if they do go to 12 games then they need to start the season earHer so that everybody ·can still have two open dates." 
The leading headline of a Nov. 2 article on UTSports.com, Tennessee's athletic Web site, read "Vols face rested Irish opponent Saturday." 
Respect Brady · 
Irish quarterback Brady Quinn received ample compli­ments from Fulmer during the week as Tennessee prepared to face a Notre Dame passing attack improved from last sea­son. 
"Coach [Willingham] was talking about his quarterback Brady Quinn, who is one of those guys that is going to be a star in the future," Fulmer said. "He is big, athletic and has a great arm, and he sees the field well. He is one of the better quarterbacks we will have played against this year." 
Quinn has completed 132 out of 246 passes .for 1,890 yards, · ten touchdowns and seven 
interceptions. 

The only other Notre Dame players to attempt a pass this season are backup quarterback Pat Dillingham (3-for-3, 28 yards) and running back Marcus Wilson (0-for-1). 
The Irish are No. 34 in the country in passing offense, averaging 241 yards per game. 
Vols' defense suspect? 

No, at least Bill Diedrick says so. 
Even though South Carolina went for 567 yards (226 rush­ing, 341 passing) in a loss to Tennessee last week, Diedrick said the numbers do not fool him. 
"I think a lot of it was in the latter portions of the game," Diedrick said. "[Tennessee] was kind of in a semi-prevent, and [South Carolina] got .a lot of what you would term as maybe wasted yardage." 
The Notre Dame offensive coordinator knows Tennessee holds opponents to just 21.1 points per game and is No. 26 in rushing defense, giving up just 109.7 yards per game.

beating up on each other ever since we stepped on· campus," Irish co-captain Jordan Cornette said. "It's going to be great take some of it and kind of unleash it on another team and I think it'll be a lot of fun for us." 
As for tonight's game, Brey has some things he'd like to work on, specifically starting to find the right combinations of players where different line­ups will work in different situ­ations. 
Having an extremely deep bench will allow Brey to try some different things in prepa­ration for the non-conferenee and Big East schedules. 
"I would hope you want to see different groups play 
together, see when we substi­tute and use depth, keep our momentum up and not lose any intensity," Brey said. ''I'd like to see us be better defen­sively, but it may not be a real­istic evaluation of us defen­sively because they are not real big, and our big guys may have to chase smaller guys for awhile." 
The disappointing end to a disappointing 2003-04 season was a quarterfinal loss in the National Invitational Tourn­ament to Oregon on the Joyce Center floor. That memory has stuck in the minds of the veter­ans returning to this year's team, and it's something they want to correct starting tonight. 
I think the guys that experi­enced that last year left a taste in their mouth," Cornette said. "We're going to unleash that on St. Joe's and carry it out through the season. 
"It starts [today] against St. Joe's i'n the exhibition, and nobody is taking them lightly." Note

Brey said forward Rick Cornett will be held out of tonight's game due to a lower back strain and it's only a pre­cautionary measure.

Willingham thought a rnportnr pinpointed Uw word to deseribn thn overall del(msive elliJrt. 

"'Struggle' is probably a cor­rect word to some degree, because we have been inconsis­tent," Willingham said. 
Dnspite Notre Dame's woes, Tennessee head coach Phillip Fulmer says he fears this Irish tmun no less as he welcomes them into Neyland Stadium Saturday. 
"We have great respect for Notre Dame and thn job thPy have done," Fulnwr said. "You don't beat Michigan unless you larl'! ~~ pretty darn good f(lOtball team.

"II' we eould be a little bit more consistent, then I think we could improve on our record and be a much sounder ... football lPam," Willingham said. 
The Irish know the improve­ments need to start immedia!ely, and there have been whispers of possible new faces on the ollen­sive side of the ball. 
"Those decisions haven't been finalized yet," Willingham said. "We start the week oll' with what we think, as we start the week who will be the starting group, and as we progress through, we see how they track what they do and then we'll look at it and see. In thn vast majority of eases. those will probably come just before the game, once we have seen exactly how things worked out thls week." _ 
But the improvements will gear in particular to improving thn running game and making it more consistent. 
"We do believe that the run­ning game is so important, that you have to be a solid running team and be able to execute in that area," Willingham said. "And when we do ... when we have Hyan Grant and Darius Walker contributing to our run­ning game, then we are a much stronger and much better team."

our starting team, we have four upperclassmen, and I would expect all four of them to carry the load." 
Three of Notre Dame's fresh­men, guards Charel Allen and Tuylah Gaines and center Melissa D'Amico, saw significant minutes and made the most of their playing time. Allen and Gaines showed off their quick­ness, while D'Amico displayed soft touch on her jump shots. Allen led the team in rebounding with nine and added 1 0 points, while Gaines and D'Amico scored four and 10 points, respectively. , "I think that our freshmen are going to add a tremendous amount of good things," McGraw said. "I think [they! makes us a little more versatile. We'll be able to up-tempo a little bit more." 
During the last ollicials' time­out. McGraw put in all four of her freshmen and sophomore Crystal Erwin to get the younger players some work together. 
Notre Dame, who opens its regular season against Illinois State Nov. 12, played its first of two exhibition contest this sea­son. The team also faces the Hoosier Lady Stars Saturday at noon inside the Joyce Center.

None of the seven will be available for tonight or Friday's games. But Irish coach Dave Poulin isn't letting his team get caught up in the controversy. 
"We just have to go out and win games," hP said. "We want to be rewarded l'inally for all the good effort we've put in so far this season." 
The Irish head into Bowling Green tonight after the worst offensive start in the program's 37-year history. Notre Dame has scored just 10 goals in its first seven games of the sea­son, including only two last weekend at home in a two­game series against No. 15 Northern Michigan. 
"I think we really havP to simplify some on offense," Poulin said. "We continue to pass on our shots too often, so we really have to go out then'l and shoot the puck a lot more. There's always the chance for a rebound, or a fluky bounce ­good things happen when you shoot the puck. 
"We have a lot of unselfish players on this team, and that can actually be too much of a bad thing because goal-scoring takes a little bit of selfishness and the willingness to take a shot when you have it." 
Perhaps one reason for Notre Dame's slow start has been a schedule that can only be described· as brutal. The Irish. have yet to play a team who is not ranked in the top 15 in the country. 

That will change tonight, with both teams currently unranked. Even after being depleted by the suspensions, Bowling Green has still proven to be a competitive team ­primarily because of tho play of starting goalin Jordan Sigalet. 
Sigalet is considered one of the best goalies in the country, and his statistics so far do a lot to defend that status. The sen­ior has started all four games for the Faleons so far. and has amassed a 1. 7 5 goals-against average and a .946 save per­centage. 
Last season, Sigalet was named a first-team all-CCIIA team member al'ter leading the nation in saves with 1,140 and in minutes played with 2,210 minutes, two seconds. 
"II' you look at all the teams in this league I don't really see any who have fallen off," Poulin said. "That's what makes this a great league, all the teams are good and so you're really battlo-testPd any­limP you play a eonfernncn ganw." 
Poulin's own hot goalie, Morgan Cey (1.92 GAA, .942 save pPrcentage) will start tonight's game. The coach said he would make tlw decision on who would start Friday night based on the results of tonight's game.

"So your preparations are more game-likP than rolling it out and pickup game-like."

But Brny fools Saint Joseph's will come out on an emotional high as it gets to travel to South Bond and play a nationally rec­ognized opponent. 
"I think they are going to come out and really battle us," Brey said. "For them it's their biggest game on the schedule. I look at this like the Harvard game. We better feel like this one counts. They are going to come out unlike the MU teams of the past." 
With only one new scholar­ship player on the roster for 2004-05, Brey has a veteran bunch on his bmu:h this season. Combine that experience with the fact this team has been playing in the summer, working out or pmetieing together for months, and they're finally ready to sec new faces.

Irish look to reverse troubles 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
Notre Dame can't get caught up in Bowling Green's prob­lems. The Irish have enough troubles of their own to worry about. 
Notre Dame (1-4-2, 0-3-1 in the CCIIA) travels to Bowling Green (3-1-0, 1-1-0) tonight to take on the Falcons in the first game of a home-and-home conference series. The Falcons return to the .Joyce Center to face the Irish Friday night at 
7:35 p.m. to close out the series. 
Bowling Green is still reeling from a disciplinary incident that has gutted the team of several of its best players for an undetermined amount of time . 
Falcon coach Scott Paluch suspended seven players indef­initely Oct. 19 after the coach was shown a pieture of a nude Bowling Green player with profanity and racial slurs writ­ten on his body, aecording to uscho.com. 
The sevon players suspnndod by Paluch inel uded the team's senior captain Alex Rogosheske. Also susponded were senior Stnve Brudzewski and juniors Hyan Bar-nntt,
