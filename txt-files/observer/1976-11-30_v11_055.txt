Until April 
South Shore gets extension 
by Marion Ulicny Staff . Reporter 

South Shore will extend its rail service from South Bend to Chicago until April, according to Albert Dudley, president and general manager of South Shore. 
This service extension is the result of an Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) investigation concerning the matter of South Shore's intended discontinuance of operation, Dudley stated. "The investigation probably started after Oct. 23 when the notice of the South Shore's discontinuance was put out. "It's a rather complex procedure, but I would assume that the matter is currently under consideration," he added. 
ICC action was prompted by the. response favoring continued opera­tion generated by South Shore users. This response included letters from students of the Notre Dame-St. Mary's community. "Quite a few people take advant­age of the service and have expressed their opinions about discontinuing it," Dudley noted. 
According to Dudley, public hearings on the matter will be held. 
"It's normal procedure for a service of this type to be open to a public hearing of some sort," he stated, adding, "Although, to my knowledge. no dates have been set yet."

Although the South Shore will function until the ICC results are released in April, additional service extensions are doubtful. Because fo the heavy financial burden of the service, funds other than passen­ger fares are necessary to keep the line in operation. 
According to Dudley, the rail­road line currently loses $3 million per year. In addition, "the passenger cars are worn out," he stated. "The railroad can't pur­chase new ones because of the steady losses. New cars and the appropriate operating facilities would be approaching a capital investment of $50 million. The only chance that we can see is if the public funds are appropriated for this purpose." 
Dudley stated he had :-.no idea" if fares would be affected during the extension period. 

Supreme Court to end Nixon tape controversy 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Su­preme Court said yesterday it will decide whether former President Richard M. Nixon should control records of his administration, inclu­ding 888 reels of White House tape recordings. 
The court agreed to hear argu­ments by Nixon's attorneys that Congress violated the ex-presi­dent's rights to privacy and inva­ded the powers of the presidency two years ago when it gave control 
of  the  massive  records  to  the  
General  Services  Administra tion  
(GSA).  

A three-judge federal court in Washington upheld the Presiden­tial Materials and Recordings Pres­ervation Act. discounting argu­ents by Nixon's lawyers. If the justices agree with the lower court, an entimated 42 million pages of documents, including about 200,000 prepared or reviewed by Nixon, and the tapes will remain with the GSA. 
If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Nixon. the material would be shipped to San Clemente, California, the ex-president's home since his resignation Aug. 9, 1974. 
The court will hear arguments in the case next year. 
After the Watergate scandals forced his resignation, Nixon asked · the government to ship the docu­ments and tapes to San Clemente. The GSA agreed to let Nixon retain title to the presidential materials in a pact that required Nixon to donate a substantial portion of them to the government at a later date. 
That agreement was side-track­ed, however, when Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski requested a delay in handing over the documents to Nixon. 

The former president sued and Congress then passed the legisla­tion. 
The act calls for the GSA to govern public access to the nateri­al. The Senate has rejected one set of proposed regulations for such governing and another proposal is pending. 
The material is available to Nixon but such access is subject to GSA regulation. 
In their appeal to the high coun. Nixon's attorneys said the materi­als reflect the former president's "entire personal, political and offi­cial life." They said he "never intended the records or his diarv to be reviewed by anyone other than himself or his family· ... 
Nixon said the materials covered by the 1974 act include notes and letters from friends and family members as well as taped conver­sations with his wife. daughters. physician. attorneys and friends. 
The Justice Depanment and several groups who filed friend of the court briefs opposing Nixon's bid for control said the presidential records are government propeny, even if Nixon mixed personal records with those of the office he held. 
Among the tapes are the 30 segments played during the Water­gate cover-up trial of Nixon's top advisers. 
The U.S. Circuit Court of Ap­peals in Washington last month ruled that those tapes now can be released to the public. 

Steel producers increase prices 
PITTSBURGH -Three major steel producers, including the nation's largest, closed ranks with their competitors yesterday by announc­ing a six percent price hike on steel used in consumer products. 
U.S. Steel, the nation's largest producer; Bethlehem Steel Corp., and Republic Steel Corp. on Mon­day joined six other firms which earlier announced price increases on flat-rolled products which are used mainly in the automotive and appliance industries. The hikes are effective Dec. 1. 
Flat-rolled produc.ts are used mainly in the automotive and appliance industries, and consum­ers could soon feel the impact of the increases in the form of higher prices for those products. 
"The increase amounts to 1.5 percent of the company's total steel product line and reflects a continu­ing strong demand for flat-rolled products and continuing cost in­crease," U.S. Steel said. 
The steel price increases, which range between $15 to $20 per ton, are the second on flat-rolled steel in 1976, making those products about 12 percent more expensive ~han they were last year. 
The auto industry, which will use about 25 percent of all steel made this year, is the largest purchaser of flat-rolled steel. So far, there has been no reaction from the major. car makers to the increases, although a Ford spokesman in Detroit said his firm was "review­ing" the increases.

The last time the steel companies announced a price increase, auto makers raised prices on cars about six percent, or an average of $300 per car, and said the steel hike was one of the reasons.

Common Market nations seek stability 
THE HAGUE, The Netherlands [AP] • Leaders of the European Common Market nations, facing demands by poor countries for trade and debt concessions and the. threat of an oil-price rise, began a search yesterday for ways to patch up their own wobbly economies. 
Francois-Xavier Ortoli, head of the executive commission of the nine-nation economic union, said in his report to the close-door summit that the West European economy is stagnating and could get worst if the price of oil goes up again. 
Ortoli told the presidents and prime ministers that the weakening of the currencies of three member nations -Britain, Italy and France . puts the over-all Common Market balance of payments further into the red. 
As for the stagnation Ortoli said consumer demand was slow, indus­try was spending little for new plants and equipment, business­men were no longer buildi111g up stocks and governments have curbed their spending. 
Some European officials hope that the United States and West Germany, which have the West's strongest economies, will stimulate their own economies and thereby create demand for imported goods. 
This in turn should create jobs and increase foreign exchange earnings in countries which trade with the two nations. 
But sources close to West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt predicted he would con­tinue to oppose such measures. The policy of the incoming Carter administration in the United States is still unknown. 
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is scheduled to meet in mid-Decem­ber to decide whether to increase oil prices above the present 11.51 for a barrel of benchmark crude. 
An increase somewhere between five percent and 15 percent is thought likely. 
President Carlos Andreas Perez of Venezuela and said in a weekend interview that OPEC would be justified in raising the price more than 30 percent because of inflation but will probably make it much smaller to avoid world economic damage. Venezuela is the third largest oil exporter. 
Each ten percent increase in the price of OPEC if passed along to consumers, would add more than a penny a gallon to the price of gas in the United States and two or three times that in Europe. The United States imports about 40 percent of its oil, whild most oil in Europe is imported. 
An oil price increase which would be the first since October 1975, is also likely to be felt throughout the economy -in costs of heating, electricity, industrial productions, public transportation. 
Italian Premier Giulic -Andreotti said each one percent increases in oil prices would cost Italy about S80 million. 
Adreotti suggested that the OPEC nations delay any increase for six months to "avoid grave shocks." In the meantime, he said, there could be a round table conference of oil countries, indus­trialized countries and poor coun­tries without oil. Excerpts of ndreotti's remarks were distributed outside the meeting. 
take effect Oct. 1, eventually were rolled back because of a weak market, but Detroit let the new car prices stand. 

About 1-112 tons of steel goes into the average mid-size car. Therefore, under the new steel prices, the cost to automakers for each car would go up by about.$30. 
National Steel Corp. initiated the latest round of increases last Wednesday and prompted swift criticism from the White House. 
President Ford ordered the Wage and Price Council to investi­gate that increase. 
On Monday, a council spokes­man said U.S. Steel would be asked along with the other companies to provide information on costs, sales and profits. The spokesman said the agency hopes to have its investigation of the steel price increases ready for President Ford before he leaves office. 
Neither the council nor the President has the authority to roll back the price hikes. 
Balkom to speak against KKK 
by Peggy Schumaker StUf Reporter 
James Balkom, a Ku Klux Klan fighter will recount his experiences with the ~lan toni2ht at 7:30 in 
the Library Auditorium. 
Balkom, a KKK fighter since 1950, has given testimony to the House on Un-American Activities 

Committee,  and  revealed  Klan  
strategies and helped  send  Klan  
members to prison.  

Haltom gained public recogni­tion when he permitted blacks to sit in a theater balcony in Georgia. The KKK responded to this action by driving the Blacks out. The Klansmen also burned a Black church next to the theater, shot at Balkom' s country store and led repeated raids in the area. 
Haltom, whose appearance at Notre Dame is sponsored by the Student Union Academic Commis­sion, claims his fight against tbe KKK will stop only when tbe K1aD is abolished.

Tuesday, November 30, 1976 the observer Lecture series to bring influential economists toND 
by Mary Pinard StaH Reporter 

The Notre Dame department of economics is sponsoring a lecture series entitled ''New Directions in 
I Public Policy." · "The series is designed to bring 
,, the best known people in the field 
·of economics to Notre Dame for four days instead of just one day for one lecture," according to Dr. Charles K. Wilber, chairman of the 
j economics department. 
There are four lecturers sched­uled to visit Notre Dame between December and April of next year. Each speaker will give two public lectures and participate in numer­
, ous related seminars. "The goal of

Irish peace movement _ supported by Norwegians 
OSLO, Norway [AP] -Declaring that they are "no petticoat bri­gade," leaders of the women's peace movement in Northern Ire­land pledged yesterday to use a $32S,OOO gift from the people of 
Norway to benefit both Roman Catholics and Protestants. 
Mairead Corrigan, a confounder of the movement, said a trust fund would be set up with the money to provide care for children, to esta­blish small factories to create jobs and to begin other community projects. She said unemployment is 26 percent in Northern Ireland. 
Corrigan, 23, and Betty Wil­liams, 32, will receive the Norwe­gian People's Peace Prize at a ceremony tonight in Oslo's seaside town hall and then be honored at a torchlight parade. 
"It is fantastic that the Norwe­gian people -many hundred of miles away from us -show their support for us in this way1" Corrigan said at a news conference. ''They started what has snowballed into support from America, Ger­many, France, The Netherlands and many other countries. 
"It will help us win this battle of 
will  to  create  peace  and  love  
between  all  Northern  Irish  
people."  

The prize money was collected among individual Norwegians after Gunnar Borrevik, foreign editor of a newspaper in Kristiansand, said the two women deserved an award for their efforts to end sectarian warfare in the British province. 
A number of other newspapers joined the effort and a goal of $14S.OOO was set. But the collec­tion snowballed, growing to double the amount that would have been awarded as this year's Nobel Peace Prize. 
The Norwegian Storting, or par­liament, which makes the Nobel award, decided not to give it this 
year after a parliamentary commit­tee reviewed the qualifications of SO candidates. 
There was widespread sentiment here for giving the Nobel to ' Williams and Corrigan, but they launched their peace campaign in August-too late for the 1976 Nobel deadline. 
The two Roman Catholic women began their movement after Wil­liams saw three children killed by a runaway car whose guerrilla driver had been shot by British soldiers in Belfast. Corrigan was the aunt of the slain children.

Is every one out there sick and tired of sauteed burger a Ia catsup? 
Or has it been hot dogs all this week? If so, allow me to suggest something to put a little variety into your menu and change back in your pocket. 
For some reason or other, everyone has seemed to have forgotten about the lowly cod filet. For $1.45 to $1.70 a pound, you cdh make yourself a healthy, grease­free meal that requires absolutely no cooking skill. And, since ther's no fat to fry away, you'll get more protein for your money than a good grade of ground chuck. 
How? Buy one-half pound per person of frozen cod filets, throw them in a pot of boiling water, with about half a table spoon of salt and boil for 20 minutes. In the mean time, melt about one four cub of butter per person in a sauce pan. When the fish are done serve them with the melted butter to dip the fish in at the table. Fresh lemon juice on the fish is always a good idea. 
What to serve with it? A green vegetable is best. I particularly like broccoli spears with a mild cheese sauce. Oh, and as long as I'm on the subject I might as well tell you the basics of any sauce. The first thing you start with is melted butter in the bottom of a one quart sauce pan. For an amount needed for four people melt 4 tablespoons of butter or margarine (slowly, not to burn it). Add one tablespoon of flour and stir constantly over very low heat for about 2-3 minutes. Make sure this mixture doesn't burn either. If the mixture is hard to stir, add a little more butter until ifs of smooth consistency. To this add slowly 3/4 cup of milk and turn the heat back on and stir until the sauce thickens up. Now add whatever type of greated cheese that you may desire. Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Velveeta and­American all work fine. If you're adding wine to your sauce, a white semi-dry of sorts are best. 
Next week I'll be back with some hamburger recipes for those out there who hate fish. And to the same, "May Ronald McDonald's flying hamburger land on your record collection."

Action and Awareness 
By Mark Stypula 
1-ourteen years ago CILA was founded by a group of Notre Dame students whc, wanted to express their concern for other people. These students felt a need tc· explore this concern through some mean­ingful action in the United States and 
oreign lands. 
Thus. the first CILA summer projects were organized. Students traveled to Peru and Mexico that first year. later returning to various parts of Latin America (Chile, Panama, Peru. Columbia. Mexico, St. Lucia). In recent years, CILA 's emphasis has shifted from the Third World to the United States (Boston. Oakland, Tennes­see, New Orleans). 
Prospective summer project sites are investigted and arranged by the summer project director during the fall semester. His job is to find out what type of work is available at the project site. how many ~tudents can be accomodated. and handle yarious other organizational matters. A list of these proposed sites is made available to interested students before Christmas, who are then interviewed in early February by an interview team consisting of a faculty advisor, an officer, and a past project member. 
.Preparation for a summer project, comprising six meetings with fellow project members. as student advisor, and a faculty advisor. begins soon after the interview. The meetings give the students an oppor­
unity to air their expectations. doubts. and ~uestions. The most important goal of the project preparation is to build a Christian ommunity among the students, some of ~·hom may not have previously known each pther. This Christian community will enable the students to cope with the problems and ch allenges that confront 
hem at the project site, not as individuals, ~ut as a group from which each may draw ~piritual support and emotional comfort. 
Rosemary Marks, a junior who worked in Boston, elaborated on the community aspect of a summer project in her project evaluation. "As Christ warns. it's not an easy thing being a Christian. But He also says that true fulfillment only results from our giving of ourselves. I deepened my understanding of Christianity through community living in that we shared and celebrated our oneness with each other. We ate. worked. and had fun together. We were frustrated and down and we were "oyful and crazy together, as well." 
The student commits himself to stay at the project site 8-10 weeks. and to write a project evaluation during the final two days at the site. Upon returning to Notre Dame a student is expected to give a presentation to CILA. and continue his involvement in CILA in whatever capacity he can.

Cinema '77 
Inside Joke 
By Dauid 0 'Keefe 
Day For Night 
Directed by Francois Truffaut 
Starring Jacqueline Bisset, Truffaut, Jean­Pierre Leaud 
Movies about moviemaking are usually self-indulgent little pieces, of passing interest and no great significance. Such films five cinema a chance to peek in the mirror and smile at the sight. Day For Night is an exception in style if not in attitude. 
The characters on the set of Meet Pamela, (the melodramatic movie-within­the-movie), are all excessively typical. Alphonse (Jean-Pierre Leaud) is an effe­minate and childishy stubborn leading man. the one-time movie queen Severine (Valentina Cortesse) has seen better days. Alexandre (Jeans-Pierre Aumont) is a handsome screen veretan whose seemingly solid wisdom often holds the whole tenuus thing together. Beautiful Julie (Jacqueline bisset) is perhaps most typical. She is warm and friendly but psychologically frail, having recently recovered from a nervous breakdown. Ferrand (played by Truffaut) is the guiding light of sorts, the harried and hurried director who typifies everything you've always imagined about Hollywood filmmakers. 
The movie is a lot of fun at times, owing to its willingness to engage in self-.satiriza­tion. There are moments that stand out not onlv for their comedy, but for their simplicity. For example, one scene. in Meet Pamela calls for a kitten to run ut/o.t lick milk from a bowl. The tiny creature refuses repeatedly, however, running around the set and causing untold anguish to the assembled cast and crew. 
Truffaut delights in showing us the tricks of his trade. We marvel at technicians as the make snow and rain, stuntmen as they survive cliff-diving crashes. At moments like these, the director seems to be saying to his audience, "Look what I can dol" 
The film stumbles in the obvious homage it pays to great filmmakers. · Truffaut makes no effort to disguise his blatant paeans to Godard, Cocteau, Bunuel, Hitchcock, and others. He also throws in a dream sequence showing a young boy stealing Citizen Kane posters from the neighborhood moviehouse. What we don't knowis that it is an episode lifted straight from Truffaut's childhood. . In the end, Day For Night is a very funny and highly interesting in its depiction of the filmmaking process. But Truffaut makes his presence obvious once too often and gives the thing an atmosphere of intimacy that appeals to few but the film insiders. 
The French directors has achieved an outstanding reputation through the past decade as one of the foremost geniuses in film. It is well-deserved. Day For Night is ltis tribute to the art that he loves so well. It isn't difficult to enjoy. But even if it were, respect would compel us to sit back., smile, ~~~11 say, "So what." 
first time this year, students who would normally be unable to give up a summer's wages can qualify for financial aid in the form of a job working for the university in the following school year. A student must fill out a Parents Confidential Statement over the Christmas break in order to be eligible. 
A CILA summer project provides a student with an opportunity to become aware of social injustice through his personal action at the project site. It is a brief. alternate lifestyle through which a student can view himself, others, and his world from a different angle. A student is exposed to a learning experience at the project site throu!'h actual work and is then challenged to reflect on it. by kt·cping a journal at the site, and subsequently writing the evaluation and giving a project presentation. 
A student participation on a summer project cannot effect great social changes in the area he is working. Rather he is learning what needs to be changed. how to change it. and then perhaps. if he is an exceptionally hard worker. effect a little change. 
The Mexico group. which worked in an orphanage outside of Mexico City. stated in their report what they got out of their summer project. "Mexico. summer of '76, was an experience which will never allow us to forget how richly we at duLac are blessed. or how gifted "little kids" are. or with how much they can gift us in the long run. Our eyes have been opened a bit wider, our hearts have somehow grown, our horizons have expanded." 
The value lesson that a summer project teaches is that a student is not always giving. while the people with whom he is working are not always taking. Often a student works for a while before he realizes that he is receiving so much more than he can give; with this realization comes an important lesson in humility. Fran Evans states the value of her participation in the Oakland by saying, "I suppose that what I have learned is that. yes, ideals can be implemented through action; and that I must view a problem through the eyes oftlie 
people who live with it and let them 
decide how to solve it, if they opt to solve it 
at all. All I can hope is that maybe by 
being present and working hard something 
good might result." 

There will be a CILA general meeting on 
Sunday, Dec. 5, at 7:00 pm in the 
auditorium in Haggar Hall (psychology 
building). The meeting is open to the 
campus and anyone who is interested in 
CILA, in general or in summer projects, is 
welcome to attend. If you are unable to 
attend the meeting and still want to know 
more about summer projects, call Mark 
(233-3613) or Lee (1054).

Brian Cummings 
Bu Scott Applebu
:1 :1 
After braving ~ stifling hiatus with the 
Guess Who, Burton Cummings has re­
truned to a place of prominence among the 
leading singer/songwriters of the day. 
Early 1970, when Randy Bachman 
packed his bags and left the Guess Who to 
form his own rock 'n' roll band (he has 
since settled for the flaccid, pretentiously 
raucous Bachman-Turner Overdrive), Cummings was saddled with the responsi­
bility of composing the bulk of material for 
the band, a task which required somewhat 
more mettle than Cummings could muster. 
As a result, the seven post-Bachman 
albums suffered form a marked lack of 
musical inspiration. 
In his first solo album, over a year in the 
making, Cummings proves beyond reason­
able doubt that he has indeed learned and 
grown from previous mishaps; conse­
quently, he has admirably filled out his 
own compostions on this album by in-
eluding three excellent renditions of songs 
by other artists. "Nothing Rhymed", a 
wispy platitude for teeny-boppers when• 
----~1f~·~.._...,_.,-....~.-4..~·----·1W·-~·~,.~ 
let's Stick Together Brian Ferry 



B~ Dominick Salemi 
Whereas most artists come to be considered decadent because of concern with the scatalogical, Brian Ferry has been given this appellation because he is so unabashedly sentimental. His reliance on cliched romantic themes has led his detractors to accuse him being pretnetious and affected. 
Yet by intentionally cultivating the image of a displaced romantic, however affect~d, Ferry has illustratively proven how divorced from sentiment and tradition the concept of love has become. Through his emphasis on the cliched, Ferry has done nothing so much as to force the realization that our present concepts of love are sterile ones, predictated on physical rather than spiritual attraction. 
Ferry's solo albums are eclectic works that draw upon a number of sources. While not as interestng as his work with his band, they have shown him to be somewhat of an engaging stylist with a lair for imaginative arrangements. Let'• Sdek Together, his third solo lp, bears a superficial resemblance to his earlier Ips; but upon a closer inspection, it reveals a troubled romantic spirit. For one thing, half of the songs on the lp are rewortings of material from earlier Roxy albums. They are moody pieces infused with a sense of pathose and self-pity. The six non-origi­sung by Gilbert O'Sullivan, is effectively matured by Cummings' soaring vocal and accompanying piano/clarinet riffs. Truer to Burton's own bouncy rhythm'n'blues style is Ray Charles' classic "That's Enough'', to which producer Riclr.ird Perry "appropriately awards a skillfully­coordinated" brass. 
But the album's masterpiece is Cum­mings' playfully ironic imitation arrange­ment of his old writing partner's biggest hit to date. Randy Bachman's driving. raspy tribute to careless love, the hack­neyed "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet". i~ here given the full. slow, soulful Big Band treatment. Cummings' vot"al. from the casuQI, inviting intonations of the opening verses to the bubbly "b-b-b-baby. you ain't 
seen n-n-n-nothin· ··of the closing fadeout. is superb. His mockery of Bachman's sonorous. limited vocal range reaches the superlative in comic effect. Producer Perry works the same miracles for cummings as he has in the past for the likes of Barbara Streisand, Ringo Starr. and Carly Simon that is, he places the performer within the musical framework most appropriate to his/her stylistic ten­dencies. This knack for melodic intuitive­ness is most evident in Cummings' own compositions. "Stand Tall"a successful top fortv entrv. and the lyrically provocative "I'm Scared", a song about Cummigs' latent spiritual awareness, find the vocalist at ease in his own medium: honest, flowing insights into Burton's self-confessed loneliness. which rely primarily on the strength of the singer's virtuosity as a crooner and balladeer. Eclectic as well as thorough, Cummings delivers such toe-tappers as "Your Back Yard" and "Sugar­time Flashback Joys" with impressive deftness and conviction. The lyric sheet to the album uses Cummings' own words to sum it all up -­"I'm back." In a total work which is as fast-moving and progressive as it is enjoyable, one can hardly doubt him. 
nals although all pervaded with a lively sense of humor all deal with unfulfilling relationships of some sort. 
Ferry however, would like us to think that this disc is nothing more than a commercial venture for him. He brilliantly uses inconsequential melody and lyrical unsophistication to belie his thematic concerns. It's as if he doesn't want us to know what's going on inside of him but paradoxically can't help wearing his heart on his sleeve. 
His concern is not iri articulating his feelings but concealing them under the guise of romantic pretension. In singing corny songs like "Chance Meeting," and "The Price of Love," Ferry is asking not to be taken seriously; but because he is constantly singing about love and its iUlportance Ferry purosely betrays his intentions. His constant use of sloppy sentimentality becomes a form of self-deni­gration; a means of laughing at himself so he can shrug off the pain he really feels. The pain that comes from unfulfilled desire ("It's Only Love"), from feelings of inadequacy ("You Go To My Head"), and from wondering whether you're even capable of being loved or needed and· whther you can go on much longer without love ("Remake/Remodel"). 
You're all probably thinking right now that I'm making too much of all this, that I'm mistakenly attempting to relate this to my personal life in some way. That might well be true, but the subtle cracks that have suddenly appeared in the normally cool, veneer of Ferry's pose: the shrill repition of the phone number n the chorus , of the propulsive "Remake/Remodel," or his insistence that he doesn't mind paying for the price of love or his rejection of tht' Casanova persona on moment embrace of the Bogart mythos in the next (2HB). Something is terribly wrong here. When after 2 sides of this Ferry concludes: 
I've tried but I could not find a way Looking back all I did was pay and pay Next time is the best time we all know But if there is not a next time where to go? 
and then closes with "Heart On My 
Sieve," I know we're both in trouble.

Finale footnotes 
====================================:=======================:=========================================History repeats
L.A.Coaches may say that the team that executes the fundamentals the best will emerge from a contest victorious. Notre Dame out-played a lackadaisical number three-rated USC team, yet the Trojans handed the Irish their third loss of the season. The record is reminiscent of last year, another 8-3 season. Yet, with a few breaks, the season may have ended 10-1. Had the Irish not been stung by a fired up Georgia Tech team and had Notre Dame beaten the Trojans on the scoreboard as well as in statistics, the Irish would be putting the pressure on number one-rated Pittsburgh for a shot at the national title. 
All of this is only what could have happened. Unfortunately, the record still stands at 8-3. Many people thought the Irish did not stand a · chance in the colliseum against the Trojans. The gridders proved their 
potential before a nation-wide audience. 
There's a lot of knowledge and skill behind football, but a team has to have a certain amount of luck, or at least not have any unfortunate instances go against them. All the turnovers that Miami gave the Irish were in turn transferred to the Trojans this past weekend. 
There was a lot of discussion on some of the "judgement" calls of the referees. Did Joe Restic's punt in the fourth quarter really sail into the end zone,:»r was the ball knocked out of bounds at the one yard line? Were all of those pass interference calls legitimate? 
A team has to play so well that even poor game officiating does not determine the final outcome. The USC defense never really stopped the Irish attack: Notre Dame stopped themselves with fumbles and interceptions. With those unfortunate incidents, the penalties hurt even worse. 
Fans may question the officiating for a while, but in a couple of years all that will be remembered is that the Trojans emerged victorious. Once again the Irish can only wait until next season. Hopefully, the 17-13 defeat will be remembered most when the Trojans visit South Bend on Oct. 22 next year. 
Many Irish supporters were disappointed with the outcome, however, their feelings are probably minimal compared to the Notre Dame squad. The Irish seemed to give everything they could possibly muster throughout the entire game. The pain of defeat must linger in the hearts, yet there must be room for pride, being proud for giving the Trojans a contest until the bitter end. 
The Notre Dame team never quit. When they were down by 14 going into the fourth quarter, they marched down the field to strike paydirt and change the entire complexion of the game. The score with four seconds to go in the battle reflected the Irish determinism throughout the contest. 
The team over-all put fourth an excellent effort. Some individual attention should got Ross Browner, who played one of his best, if not the best game of his career at defensive end. It seemed as though whereever the ball was, so was Browner. 
On offense, reconition goes to AI Hunter, who became the first back in Notre Dame history to run for over 100 yards in a single season. 
Right now, the Irish have to prepare for the Gator Bowl on Dec. 27 and their clash with Penn St. The Nittany Lions suffered defeat against the panthers last Friday night. After a 7-7 halftime score, Pitt exploded for 17 more points after intermission while holding Penn St. scoreless. 
Both Dan Devine and Joe Paterno will be trying to regroup their: troups and try to end their respective seasons on a winning note. ' 
USC is over; preparation for the Nittany Lions must get underway. Some people say that things have a tendency to come in groups of threes. Well, the Trojans have had their three consecutive victories over the Irish. Hopefully, next year will insure that that's as far as the string wiii extend.

========>=====::=======>==============::;::::::::::::::::::=:===:=:=:=:=====:=<:======:::::::::::=====================: Terp profile 
College Park, Md. The substitution buzzer rang, a roar went up in the crowd, and you knew who was coming in the game Saturday. It is Brian Magid. Don't feel bad if you have to ask the person reading the paper next to you who he is. He's Maryland's crowd pleaser, the Bernard Rencher of College Park. · 
This 6'2" sophomore is a favorite of the Terp fans who immediately begin to yell "shoot-shoot" as soon as he touches the basketball. Magid, who is known mainly for his ability to connect on long jump shots. is praised by Lefty Driesell who says "Brian shoots the basketball like it h_as radar." Magid shot a remarkable 63 percent from the field last year wh1Ie hitting on 81 percent of his shots from the charity line. 
Described by many as a "good shooter, no defense." he certainly proved this description to be unbefitting during Saturday's contest. While shooting 5 for 8. he held his man. Duck Williams, to a low shooting percentage for the game (8 for 22). Commenting on how people describe his basketball talents, Magid stated that "people should also respect my ability to play defense. I proved myself today by the difficulty that my man had completing his shots in the second half. He only made 3 of 14." 
On the question of whether the game was a coaches' dual between Digger Phelps and Lefty Driesell, he responded that "the game was won on the court. not on the sidelines.'' Brian had respect for the Notre Dame freshmen who he felt were instrumental in the final outcome of the contest. Hearing that Coach Phelps wanted to regularly schedule the Notre Dame-Maryland game for the fourth Saturday in January in future years. he felt that playing a game of this caliber was a great way to start off the basketball season. 
Magid was very pleased with the vote of confidence that his teammates displayed for him on the court during Saturday's clash. "Breezie (Brad Davis) kept telling me to take the shot whenever I was open and that really made me feel at ease out there on the court." 
Magid. who is also a Maryland Scholar Athlete carrying a 3.5 g.p.a., really values the chance to play. He gave no excuses for losing stating that "the game was won and lost by no one else but the players on the noor." 
After talking to Magid, one realizes his shyness and almost hesitant speech off the court are a complete turnabout from his mannerisms on the court. He seems to be a Walter Mitty-type character whose dreams are brought alive by the encouragement of the crowd. They made him believe that he can hit from any distance and he just about does it. Fortunately for the Irish. the onlv shots that he did miss came at the end of the game where any one of them could have made a difference in the final outcome. The smile that appears across his face after making each shot is one of appreciation and thanks to all the people that want him to play and help him to perform at his best. 
Look to hear from Brian Magid in the future. Being only a sophomore. he has plenty of time to improve. His attitudes about the game are refreshing and arc certainly a welcomed change. We need more players of his character. players who know how to have fun playing the game while still having respect for everyone else. on and off the court. 
So the next time you arc at a Maryland basketball game and a loud roar goes up in Cole Field House. don't make the mistake I made and look around the crowd to see what all the commotion is about. Focus in at the scorer's table and you will have the answer. Brian Magid is coming into the game.

MADISON -Notre Dame invaded the hostile Dane County Coliseum this past weekend and walked away with a win and a loss, a feat only one other team has accomplished this year. The Irish downed the Badgers 4-1 on Friday night and then dropped a close one on Saturday, 4-3. 
Friday night a record tying Badger crowd went home early after seeing Notre Dame jump out to a 3-1 advantage and then ice the victory in the third period on Clark Hamilton"s third goal of the night. 
The Irish jumped out to a 1-0 advantage at 12:49 of the first period when Hamilton topped in a

Saturday night's game was a seesaw battle that could have been won by either team. The game wasn't decided until timt! expired with the Irish pressing Wisconsin after pulling Moher for the extra attacker. 
The Badgers took a 1-0 lead on a controversial goal at the 19:59 mark of the first period on a shot that went off a screened Moher and caromed into the net with little or no time remaining on the clock. Former Olympian John Taft drilled a shot from the point that sent Lefty Smith over to the scorer's box in protest. 
Jack Brownschidle answered with 0:46 clasped in the middle period on a nip shot that beat Baretta after caroming off the ice. Mark Johnson came right back for the Badgers to give them the lead once again at 5:23 but the lead was short-lived as Kevin Nugent got his third goal of the year 35 seconds later. 
With play turning very physical Wisconsin· s Les Grauer scored the fourth goal of the period but once again Notre Dame got it right back as the first line combined for the Irish.
