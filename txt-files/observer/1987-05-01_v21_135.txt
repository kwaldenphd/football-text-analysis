ND students . plead guilty in accident cases 
Cogswell accident driver is sentenced 
By ANN MARIE DURNING Assistant News Editor 
A 21-year-old Notre Dame student pleaded guilty and was sentenced Thursday in connection with the Dec. 6 fatal traffic accident involving junior Michael Cogswell. 
The student, who pleaded guilty to a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol, was sentenced to 120 hours of community service. 
Judge William Albright also imposed a $130 fine and suspended the student's driver's license for 180 days. 
Explaining the sentence, Albright said the grand jury investigation of the 

Reagan refuses to lift sanctions 
Associatt-d Press 
WASHINGTON -President Reagan promised Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone on Thursday he would veto legislation requiring trade retaliation against Japan, but he refused to lift sanctions already in place without evidence Tokyo has stopped unfair sales practices. 
In a move that pleased U.S. officials, Nakasone told Reagan he had directed the Bank of Japan and the Finance Min­istry to lower short-term interest rates. 
Lower interest rates would stimulate economic growth in Japan, providing "a major opportunity for increasing markets for U.S. goods, for increasing the buying power of Japan," said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. 
"Anything that stimulates markets abroad is good news for American workers and American products," Vice President George Bush said. 
Reagan and Nakasone met at the White House against the background of the sharpest trade friction between the two countries since World War II,

accident found "no significant causal link" between the DUI charge and Cogswell's death. 
In light of this, the court decided that "the most appropriate position" was to sentence the student to speaking about his experience in the community where it occurred. 
Cogswell, a 20-year-old Zahm Hall resident, died from severe head injur­ies hours after he was hit by a car. 
Cogswell's mother had written the court asking that the 21-year-old stu­dent be permitted to do community ser­vice rather than serving a jail sentence, Albright said. 
The student had faced up to one year in prison and a $5,000 fine for the Class A misdemeanor. 
Albright, however, sentenced the stu­

Student accepts manslaughter charge 
By SEAN HICKEY Senior Staff Reporter 
A 20-year old Notre Dame student has pleaded guilty Thursday to a charge of involuntary manslaughter in connec­tion with a traffic accident that killed a South Bend man last fall. 
In exchange for the guilty plea to in­voluntary manslaughter, a Class D felony, a Class C felony charge of reck­less homicide was dropped. 
The student faces a minimum sen­tence of 1 year in prison and a maxi­mum sentence of 4 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. By pleading guilty, the student could also be sued in a civil case. 
Sentencing was set for May 28. 
The student was accused of striking and causing the death of South Bend resident Buddy Moore, 52, on Nov. 15, shortly after the Pennsylvania State University football game. Moore was walking on Edison Road, near Ivy Road. 
The accident occurred when the stu­dent's car made a U-turn on Edison Road, headed east and then struck Moore, police records show. 
Moore died of severe head injuries a day after being struck. 
The student admitted in court that he had been driving too fast and in the opposite direction from which the police were directing traffic.

Holy Cross forms lay Board of Trustees 
By SHANNON OAKES Staff Reporter 
Holy Cross Junior College has joined Notre Dame and most U.S. Catholic colleges and universities in placing it­self under the governance of a board of trustees. 
The college, which had been under the control of the Holy Cross brothers since its found­ing, established the board on April 5. 
The 18-member board has taken over most of the work previously done by college President Brother John Dris­coll, Treasurer Brother James Leik, Administrative Assistant Brother James Bluma, Chief Accountant Joseph Goepfrich and Registrar Richard Sullivan. 
"It's a major change for us. We've been working on this for one and a half to two years now," said Leik, treasurer of the college since 1966. "The Board will have the power to rule and lead and to guide us in a new phase of college de­velopment. That's the key to ' it right there." 
The Board was established with concern for both short and long-range planning. Leik expressed the need for an out­side perspective that is diffi­cult to achieve by being that close to the college. 
''We're coming from a point of strength. (Holy Cross) is in no trouble. We received no pressure from anyone outside of us (to make the chan­geover)," he said. "We need the help. No religious issue is involved at all in this. It's good, smart business prac­tice." -. 
The Board of Trustees elected additional officers on April 25,1987. William Shan­non, professor of business economics at Saint Mary's College was elected as chairman and Ruth Kelly from the Notre Dame Credit Union was elected as vice­chairwoman. 
Additional members of the Board include Kenneth Andre Jr. of Calumet City, Ill.; Elizabeth Barkyoumb of Oakbrook, Ill.; J. David Brown of Colummbia, S.C.; Arthur Decio and Frank Vite both of Elkhart; Brother Mi­chael Flanagan, and Brother

ND students subpoenaed to testify in Lee's Ribs case 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI and JIM RILEY News Editors 
At least one-third of the more than 200 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students cited in the January raids of Lee's Grill and Barbecue were subpoenaed to appear this morning at legal proceedings, according to several of the students. 
The students received sub­poenas ordering them to ap­
pear in  the  Mishawaka  City  
Hall  Council  Chambers  this  
morning at 10.  

According to the subpoena, the students were to testify at proceedings involving the In­diana Alcoholic Beverages Commission and Lee's Grill and Barbecue. 
Although the exact number of subpoenas served was not known, students reported that nearly everyone they knew who was cited, was also subpoenaed to testify. 
Students said they did not know what form of testimony they would be giving. But they said they expected to be asked whether or not they were re­quired to show identification when they entered Lee's. 
Three separate students said they thought the commission was trying to take away Lee's liquor license. 
During January, Lee's was raided twice by the South Bend Police, Indiana State Police and the Indiana State Excise Police. 
At the Jan. 15 raid, more than

allowed this sort of merrymaking, the customs survived. The Maypole dance especially be­came a part of the May Day festival in this country. 
All the fun and frivolity was not for nothing. The people were celebrating the end of a long, cold winter, and awaiting the warm season to come. Spring has been associated through the ages with growth and new life; the arrival of May signaled the height of the season and en­couraged people to celebrate the past and an­ticipate the future. 
So it should be with us. 
We have much to celebrate. We have a whole year of fun and friends, of academic ac­complishments, of learning and growth behind us. We have an entire summer of fun and friends and family, of academic freedom, of rest and relaxation ahead of us. 
How, then, do we celebrate this carefree month? 
There are any number of ways. The impor­tant thing is to do something just because we enjoy it. I think we need to let the child in each here, sometimes we forget the importance of acting like a kid once in a while. 
Last weekend witnessed the An Tostal­induced transformation of this campus from study haven to appropriately spring­worshipping festival, with no purpose other than plain, simple fun. Of course, such occa­sions should not occur too often; just like , Christmas, they would lose their specialness if they were to come around more than once a year. However, neither should the celebrating spirit of fun be downplayed. 
This is the lesson of the month of May. It is a reminder to stop taking life so seriously, to enjoy some fun and freedom, to take a little time for ourselves without feeling guilty. 
May certainly deserves its title. The days be­tween the end of the school year and the begin­ning of a summer job provide a worry-free time away from responsibility. What a waste it would be to let them slip by. 
Here's to a brand new month and all the fun it brings. May it be a happy, safe, lusty one for us all.

Trade bill clears House, veto threat 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The House on Thursday approved, 290-137, a sweeping trade bill with stiff retaliatory features, defying a presidential veto threat and forecasts that the Senate would wipe out its most stringent provisions. 
"Although you may not like parts of the bill, let's move it along, let's get it into the process. Surely the other body (the Senate) will make modifi­cations," Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, urged before the House acted. 
Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., declared before the 900-page measure won approval he doubted that "anybody in this House today believes this bill will go through the Senate and be signed by the president in its present form." 
"I hope all of you realize that this bill isn't going anywhere," he said. 
The vote for the measure represented two thirds of the 435-seat House, the margin needed to override a presiden­tial veto. 
On the roll call, 247 Democrats and 43 Republicans voted in favor of the measure, while six Democrats and 131 Republicans voted against it. 
Japanese Prime Minister Yasubiro Nakasone, who met earlier with President Reagan, visited senators shortly after the House acted. 
The Senate Finance Commit­tee, which is drafting its own trade legislation, may take up a punitive provision similar to one sponsored by Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and adopted by the House on Wednesday by a four-vote margin. 
But Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D­Texas, the committee chair­man, says he does not expect either the panel or the full Sen­ate to approve the measure, which calls for sanctions to en­force 10 percent rollbacks in trade surpluses by Japan and 
other nations if talks fail. The Observer Friday, May 1, 1987-page 4

Kelly said Thursday in South Bend. 
Ungaro said he and represen­tatives of City Council traveled to Indiana last week to meet with Kelly and tour the plant there. 
"We're just really happy for the whole town -not just be­cause of the job creation but because it's national exposure and it's a positive event," said Ungaro. 
The Mahoning Valley region had long been dependent on the steel industry for jobs and has been hit hard by the slump in the U.S. steel market. 
In March, the unemployment rate in Mahoning County was 
10.0 percent while neighboring Trumbull County's rate was 
10.4 percent. That compares with a rate of 7.9 percent for the entire state. 
In November 1982, the un­employment rate for Mahoning County peaked at 21.7 percent, while Trumbull was at 24.5 per­cent. 
"If it was 25 jobs, I'd be hap­py," Ungaro said. 
The mayor said the city had made commitments to A vanti to provide public improve­ments and demolition in the area, tax abatements, and grants, but he declined to elab­orate. He said the details would become public soon when City Council acts on the authorizing legislation. 
"What's good for the valley is good for all of us," said Daniel Sferra, mayor of nearby Warren. "I'm glad that it's going to Youngstown and not South Bend."

YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio Mayor Patrick Ungaro said Thursday's announcement that a luxury automobile plant will be built on the city's northeast side will help the Mahoning County city shake its image as a depressed steel town. 
"People perceive us as a steel town all over," said Un­garo. "We're convincing people we can do something else. We're retraining mill people to do other jobs." 
The New Avanti Motor Corp. of South Bend, on Thursday said it will open an assembly plant in Youngstown and em­ploy 450 people to make four­door touring sedans and limousines. Avanti will con­tinue to produce two-door coupes at its South Bend plant. 
The Youngstown plant will be located in the Ross Industrial Park in a joint venture with the Cafaro Co. of Youngstown, a shopping center mall developer that owns the indus­trial park. 
"Youngstown, Ohio, offered the right political climate -a mayor who indicated a burning desire for Avanti and a willing­ness to do everything possible to make a second plant for Avanti a reality," Avanti owner and president Michael the highest number ever delivered to students in one

ND Big Brother gets service awar 
Special to The Observer 
Marc A. Bergin of North can­ton, Ohio, a senior at the Uni­versity of Notre Dame, has been named the 1987 recipient of the Patrick John Niland Award for his services as a Big Brother in St. Joseph County. 
Bergin accepted the award at a reception Tuesday which was co-sponsored by Big Brot­her&Big Sisters of st. Joseph County and the organization's Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Col­lege Association for volun­teers. The r~ception was held at the University's Center for Social Concerns. 
The award is given in honor of Patrick John Niland, a 1982 University of Notre Dame graduate from East Lansing, Michigan. Niland was a Big Brother for three years while a student at the University. 
Niland was killed when the car he was driving was struck head-on on a rural road by a pick-up truck attempting to pass another car. 
The award wa presented to Bergin after a three member committee considered several candidates. Judges were Dr. Charles Pressler of St. Mary's College, Professor Terry Phelps of the University of Notre Dame law faculty, and Big Brother James Moore, a junior at the University. The memorial award is given to an undergraduate or graduate Notre Dame senior who ex­plifies a quality relationship with Little Brother or Little Sister. 
First runner up for the Niland award was Notre Dame senior Tracy Claire Thoman of Columbus, Ohio.

ATLANTA -Cases of tuber­culosis in the United States are up significantly for the first time in the 34 years records have been kept, and the spread of AIDS may be partly to blame, federal officials re­ported Thursday. 
New TB cases had declined by an average of 1,706 a year from 1982 to 1984, but by only 54 in 1985. In 1986, the number of new cases recorded rose by 374 to 22,575, an increase of 1.7 percent, the Centers for Dis­ease Control reported. 
"This indicates to us that we have a very serious problem; we need to pay attention to this," said Dr. Dixie Snider, director of the CDC's tuber­culosis division. He warned that an increase of TB among AIDS patients may mean an in­

The report said the matching of lists of AIDS and TB patients in roughly half the states found that 4.2 percent of the AIDS patients in those states also had TB. The relationship between AIDS and TB could be better understood if all states matched AIDS and TB registries, the CDC said. 
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal condition that destroys the body's ability to fight disease and leaves it open to a variety of infections, including tuberculosis. It has been diagnosed in more than 33,000 Americans, and more than 19,000 have died. 
In July, the Journal of the American Medical Association said AIDS patients often suffer severe and unusual forms of TB and said tuberculosis should be writers... but maybe it's because they issued 15,700 parking permits for 11,000 available spaces. -The National On-Campus Report

Deteriorated situation warrants divestment 
"We must ask ourselves how we got here, to this prison," Mandela said. "A system put us here, a system with a chain ofcommand. These overseas cor­porations are a vital link in that system."-Nelson Mandela, 1966 quoted in James North, "Freedom Rising" 
John Gardiner 
guest column 
Since the Board of Trustees' last meeting, the world has witnessed con­tinued human rights abuses in South Africa stemming from the State of Emergency which was imposed by the government last summer. The police and the army have been given virtually total control. Even any action, word or written document that protests the practice of detention without trial or calls for the release of detainees has been outlawed. This includes public prayer. A scathing report on the situa­tion of human rights in South Africa was released by the United Nations, al­though a vote of condemnation was not passed by the Security council for po­litical reasons. Meanwhile, the South African Government has strengthened its curtailment of the international press, cutting off a major vehicle for international scrutiny. Finally, the Rev. Leon Sullivan, author of the prin­ciples to which the University currently subscribes, has called for a total eco­nomic embargo, as the means for ef­fecting change, unless the situation seriously improves by May 1987. 
"Change in South Africa cannot come too quickly for those bearing the indig­nity and injustice of apartheid." -US Catholic Conference Statement (Sept. 11, 1985) 
The question which arises is: "Has the criteria established by the Board of Trustees been met?'' The first criterion was that the Board would divest if the situation deteriorated further. As dem­onstrated above, it is obvious that the situation in South Africa has further deteriorated. Words mean nothing un­less acted upon; therefore, the Board must act. 
In reference to the second criterion, the idea that the corporations could ef­fect change by staying there is unrealis­tic. Past experiences show that any or­ganization of workers or potential threat to the regime has historically been responded to by the South African government with force, including bru­tal repression. The only force that the regime appears to respect is interna­tional pressure. The regime is most powerful when confronted by internal subversion or force -it gives the regime its "legitimacy" in its own eyes. However, it cannot respond to interna­tional pressure by force; it must respond with positive action. 
The effectiveness of this interna­tional pressure is due to the fact that foreign investment in South Africa is the lifeblood of the white regime in terms of administrative expertise, cap­ital, technological advancements and the maintenance of machinery. Pulling capital out makes it difficult of the white regime to continue repression. In addition to the technological effect, the loss of revenue brought by foreign dis­investment would hinder the govern­ment's ability to meet the costs of repression, detention, and the State of Emergency, forcing them to negotiate. 
There is always present argument that if we should remove our "leverage," we will no longer have an effect upon the regime. As I have shown above, the presence of foreign compan­ies is not really a "leverage." Marginal improvements in workers' conditions are not the central issue; what has to be achieved in South Africa is a negotiated settlement between repre­sentatives of the liberation movement toward the negotiating table. The al­ternative is a prolonged and bloody civil war. International groups can still retain pressure through the rewarding of the start of serious negotiations. 
Some recent announcemnts of withdrawals have proven to be inaut­hentic. Thus, it is necessary to include the following guidelines, sponsored by the American Committee on Africa, in any effective divestment policy. A cor­poration is considered to be doing busi­ness in or with the Republic of South Africa if it, its parent, or its sub­sidiaries: 1) have direct investments in South Africa, or have entered into fran­chise, liscensing or management agreements with or for any entity in those countries; or 2) are financial in­stitutions that have not prohibited new investments, loans, credits or related services, or the renewal of existing fin­ancial agreements, ·inciuding those for the purpose of trade, with any entity in those countries; or 3) have more than five percent of their common stock beneficially owned or controlled by a South African entity. 
"We, therefore, ask all men ofgood will to take action against apartheid...Don't buy South Africa's products and ... Don't trade or invest in South Africa... " ­Martin Luther King, Dec. 10, 1962 
People are saying that "things are improving." They point to the fact that only 25 people died in a recent month (as compared to other months). Such an indicator is ridiculous. These people also point to the granting of permission to blacks to use the white beaches. Are they serious? What is the next step for the Board to take? Will they postpone a policy decision until a civil war en­gulfs the country? Why does the Board continue to delay what many consider to be the inevitable? Already, the bis­hops of the United States Catholic Con­ference are preparing a divestment strategy in anticipation that the situation in South Africa will not im­prove by their May deadline. The bis­hops have claimed that their "religious and moral teaching is daily con­tradicted by apartheid." Is Notre Dame immune from such teaching? Given King's words above, are we not twenty­five years overdue? 
John D. Gardiner is a senior govern­ment major. 
P.O.BoxQ 
Homosexuality in print nauseates some readers 
Dear Editor: 
As I read both The Observer and 
Scholastic regularly, I have noticed 
that there has been much written about 
the homosexual communify at Notre 
Dame. The guest column series by 
Jenifer Naughton in the April 27-29 edi­
tions of The Observer have re-ignited 
the controversy of this problem over 
the lunch tables and my dormitory sec­
tion. I feel that I must speak out against 
this terrible misuse of University 
media to forward the aims of a minority 
group whose very existence I cannot 
condone. 
If it is your intent to educate the 
"straight" students of this campus as 
to the supposedly widespread existence 
of a homosexual community, this is not 
the way. Scholastic's December 4, 1986 
cover and content were devoted to this 
concept, which forced me to re­
evaluate the merit of this institution. 
Perhaps Scholastic ran out of material 
and turned to the gay1esbian issue to 
fill empty space. I can't believe that. 
It is one thing to tell the student body 
that there are homosexuals on campus 
and another thing entirely to say that 
these people should be recognized as a 
group. If Mr. Acosta could have it his 
way, he would make homosexuality 
" ... an ordinary, noncontroversial 
aspect of everyday life." IfI could have 
it my way, homosexuality would not.ex­
ist. 
After Scholastic published this issue, 
I had many discussions with other "straight-minded" people, all of whom were nauseated or at least slightly un­settled by the idea of homosexuals in the community. The Observer guest columns of these last few days has vi­ciously re-opened that festering wound. 
Even if I concede the alarming fact of homosexuality at Notre Dame, I find no reason that I should be continually subjected to numerous "revolting" scenarios over the lunch table. Reading that I could be "checked out" by a male turns my stomach. And how can you not expect someone to complain when you print the trash of two young men "John" and "Chris." The idea of two young men "blissfully" in love and being "very happy, very romantic," would cause any decent, red-blooded American to see his lunch again. If you want to tell us about the problems in our community, please do not make the detail so graphic that we become ill. 
I can admit that there are homosexuals at Notre Dame. I do not approve of it, and above all I do not understand why there is so much writ­ten by and about them. Ms. Naughton said in her column Monday that homosexuality is "a natural orientation (of) probably ten percent of the popu­lation." I still can't see how that makes it right. Even though it exists, I don't have to read about it in the school paper or magazine or anything connected with this University. In the future, please consider the majority of people who provide the majority of funding for this paper and write for their tastes.

The following story, a tale of Casey Kasem, vodka and Russian police, may seem too incredible to have taken place. Nonetheless, several Notre Dame students in Innsbruck not only say that it could have happened, but insist that it did ... 


PETE GEGEN features writer 
Every weekend the internationally-syndicated radio program 
American Top 40 can be heard throughout the world. The Notre Dame students currently participating in the lnnsbruck,. Austria foreign study program, for example, can listen to this program every Saturday night at 7. But unlike the wealth of current popular music available in the United States, current American songs are scarce in Austria, so American Top 40, or AT40 for short, is one of the few means through which the students can keep up with the music. 
On the evening of March 14, several students were listening to the program in the room of sophomore Joe DePiro as they heard AT40 Disc Jockey Casey Kasem read a postcard on the segment of the show known as the "long-distance dedication." 
Now we're up to our long distance dedication, and this one is a first on AT40. It's our first letter from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, from Moscow, and we're not even heard in Russia. The letter is from a young Russian woman who wrote her dedication on a postcard. And here's what it says, 'Dear Casey, My name is Lina and I write to you because I met here in Moscow some American friends. They visited Russia from Austria where they are foreign exchange students from a university in the U.S.A., Notre Dame.' 
Immediately they popped a blank cassette in the tap'e player to catch the rest of the letter as Casey kept reading. 
They gave me a tape ofyour show. Bven though I know I will not hear this letter, I want to thank them for something. They taught me that we are not enemies at all butjust people. I hope other people can learn this too. Can you please play "American Pie" for my American friends in Austria. Thank you, Lina Bestemyanova. ' Lina, here's your long distance dedication. 
Most of the Notre Dame students in Austria did not hear the recording until the tape was played for them. 
"I was so surprised," says sophomore Susan Hrach, one of the students who had met Lina in Moscow. "The next day I ran into some other people and they asked if I heard Casey Kasem last night, and I said, 'No, I wasn't listening last night." They said that they aired a letter from that girl that you met in Russia that you gave the Top 40 tape to. 
"I just couldn't believe it. Joe brought the half of the tape he had to dinner and we all listened to it. 'Ve were really excited, "she said. 
The intriguing part of this story, though, involves the way these Notre Dame students met Lina Bestemyanova. The explanation turns into a tale of initiative, chance and daring on the parts of Lina and the students. 
hi February, Sophomore Robert Brown organized a trip to Russia through the Austro-Russian society in lnnsbruck. He invited any interested students to go on a week-long trip to Russia, splitting time between the cities of Moscow and Leningrad. A total of 32 students took Brown up on the offer. 
The group departed from Vienna the last day of January, a Saturday. Moscow was the first stop on the trip. 
Like any culture-conscious Notre Dame student, the group made a stop at the liquor store to pick up some authentic Russian vodka. 
"We had thought that vodka lines in Russia was something that was made up," says Hrach. "But there really are lines there. We wanted to get some Russian vodka because that's what they are most famous for, so we had to wait in line."

farewell from a father to his son going off to war. If this article Is flavored with a twist of Celtic melancholy, It's because I'm offering an ave atque vale at year's end to readers who are on the way out the door.

Letters to a Lonely God 
You could stlll be In trouble If you accept candy from strangers. You are not children, so I'll re-phrase the warning in an adult way you have heard many times: "There's no such thing as a free lunch." 
Late one evening In Green­wich VIllage, I saw something which looked like a sign of trouble. A woman's suitcase lay open on the steps of the public library, and its contents were scattered over the steps. I noticed blouses and other clothing that had obviously been Ironed with care; they might have been my sister's. I could Imagine her with my mother, packing things she would want on a Manhattan 
I 

holiday. 
Where was the owner of the suitcase? She obviously hadn't brought lingerie and toilet arti­cles to the City, lugging them downtown from the bus sta­tion, so that she could strew them around for strangers to gape at. and unfailingly steal. I doubt that she had been pulled kicking and screaming into some pimpmobile cruising Sixth Avenue; the VIllage isn't 


that much of a jungle. But she could have accepted candy -­booze, drugs, pills, flattery-­from a cad in sheepskin cloth­Ing who invited her to join him for a night on the town. Maybe whatever happened wasn't quite so Gothic. Nonetheless, the suitcase with its contents half spilled caused me worry and sadness. 
I remember the suitcase that had lost Its owner as a symbol of our vulnerablity. All of us leave evidence behind us. A dorm room after the students have moved out seems almost anonymous. Yet. a picture taped to the wall reminds you that Kilroy was here. Cigarette butts left In an ashtray are a

with your name, rank. and serial number painted on it. Even If you've been promised that beyond that door lies the stairway to paradise, the steps don't necessarily go all the way up. You may quickly discover that you're treading on thin air, as a prelude to dropping down a bottomless black pit. 
Years ago, a former monk brought me to an apartment on Sutton Place belonging to a woman with mystical preten­sions. The rooms were crowded with what Kipling would call "heathen Idols." The air was perfumed with Incense; carpets from Persia made the place feel as rich as a temple. 
The couple was very loving In making me an offer they hoped I couldn't refuse. "Christians search for God in the world of nature," the lady explained. "The East directs us to the God within." Would I like to be in­troduced to an Eastern god? 
"I argue with the Church, but I'd never switch Gods in the middle of the stream of con­sciousness." I replied in an at­tempted pun. Next, she volun­teered to take me on a controlled LSD trip. "You need the sound of a familiar voice, with music like Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons' playing in the back­ground. You will be able to see the divine energy flowing through the plants. Pluck off a leaf and watch It die like a fal­len star. A tree In the park can turn into the Burning Bush of Moses." 
1 don't get many offers like that. The sight of a Burning Bush would help my faith, but those two smoothies could have gotten me out on a limb I wouldn't get back from. I was angry at them for tempting me Into a false religion. 
As a grownup, you don't need much common sense to turn down the offer of candy from a priestess of Shiva. When you're younger, as I re­member, It Is harder to watch your step. "Golden lads and girls all musV As chimney­sweepers come to dust." 
You can't blame me for wan­ting to keep you golden. You only pass this way once. Be simple. pure, and loving. to avoid summer's ending In an early fall. Darby O'GIII and I never said we didn't love you. 
clue useful to a detective trying to Identify a suspect. Personal linen soiled by the dirt on a sidewalk Is a sign that someth­Ing unforeseen, and probably sinister, has taken place. How would my mother react to the sight of her daughter's laundry being stepped on by the feet of pedestrians, many of them un­washed? 
Whatever drections our lives take, we leave a trail that could be cheerful or ominous. It could tell a story or serve as Information that not all is well. Bloodstains on a towel, an emptied tlfth of Jack Daniels, a bicycle with a twisted frame--a cry for help couldn't chiH us more than these signal flags of an Inescapable human fragility. 
The brightest and best are not promised that harm can t touch them. For the sake of those who love us, we could be kind enough to avoid taking chances. Everyone is essential to the universe. No man or woman is an island. Romeo and Juliet changed the shape of the universe by exist­ing early. They could have writ­ten great poetry or discovered the cure for a terminal Illness. But, they were already poetry for the friends who loved the sound of their voices. Their disappearance was as depress­ing as an Illness for which there could be no cure. 
It's not necessarily your enemies that cause you great harm, even If they send you home crying. The friendly voices calling out, "Come ln. The water is nne," may draw you In over your head, to sink or swim. Your enemies, with their derision. at least give you an Idea of the sharks waiting to circle your Inner-tube. Don't trust anybody with your pearl of great price, even if they promise you your heart's desire. 
A college friend of mine once got the "Dear John" treatment from his girlfriend. As a result, he decided to enter the semi­nary. For weeks he worked to persuade his buddies to join him in becoming a missionary father of an order bringing Christ to the African desert. "What does It protlt a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his soul?" he kept asking them, as he passed out holy cards picturing the lives of the saints. 
They took him as seriously as the voice of God, and he had a bunch of them getting up early to attend dally Mass. Four or tlve guys even wrote the vocation director for Infor­mation. Sometime during this early exchange of letters however, the proselytizer met another girl who changed his mind about joining the desert monks. The fellows who had climbed on his bandwagon felt

Every gospel of liberation has Its eloquent evangelist whq Is thinking more of himself than of you. "candy1s dand)l'But liquor Is quicker," wrote Ogen Nash.

Demons Begone is early favorite in 113th running of Derby 



Associated Press 

LOUISVILLE, Ky. -Phil Hauswald, who failed to win the 1986 Kentucky Derby with a 60­1 shot, will go after the 113th Derby Saturday with favored Demons Begone. 
"He thinks he's king of the world right now," the 28-year­old trainer said of the colt, who is unbeaten in three starts this year, including the Arkansas Derby. 
"He thinks he can beat anybody.'' 
Demons Begone was the 5-2 early favorite to beat 16 other 3-year-olds and give Hauswald, a native of nearby New Albany, Ind., a Derby victory in his second try. Last year, he saddled Bachelor Beau to finish 14th in a 16-horse field. 
The last favorite to win the 1 V4-mile Derby at Churchill Downs was Spectacular Bid, who went off at 3-5. 
Free agents to sign with teants 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Tim Raines is expected to re-sign with the Montreal Expos Friday and Rich Gedman and Ron Guidry are close to rejoining the teams they tried to leave, ending their unsuccessful efforts to find new homes. 
A meeting between Raines and the Expos was scheduled for one minute after midnight Friday, the first day since Jan. 8 on which free agents can negotiate with their former clubs. 
Gedman seemed certain to reclaim his slot on the catching-poor Boston Red Sox, and Guidry is likely to return to the New York Yankees' pitching staff. 
But the futures of Bob Boone and Doyle Alexander were un­clear. The California Angels have filled Boone's catching spot with Butch Wynegar and the Atlanta Braves have not shown much interest in Alex­ander. 
Andre Dawson, Lance Par­rish and Bob Horner, the other three premier free agents, have found new teams. Dawson left Montreal and signed with the Chicago Cubs at a substan­tial pay cut, and Parrish departed Detroit and joined Philadelphia for less money. Bob Horner left the Braves and 
The wide open aspect of this year's Derby is reflected in the morning line. 
The entry of Gulch and Leo Castelli, trained by LeRoy Jol­ley, was made 4-1, while Cryp­toclearance was listed at 5-l, and Alysheba, Masterful Adv­ocate and Bet Twice each were rated 6-1. Trainer D. Wayne Lukas' entry of Capote, War, and On The Line was made 8-1. 
Demons Begone, owned by John Ed Anthony, can earn a $1 million bonus offered by Oaklawn Park to any horse who sweeps the Rebel and Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn and the Ken­tucky Derby. 
Saturday's winner also will take a first step toward one of two bonuses. 
Triple Crown Productions, Inc., is guaranteeing $5 million, including winners' purses in the three races, to any 3-year­old who sweeps the Derby, 
signed with the Yakult Swal­lows in Japan. 
Dave Kingman, Tom Seaver and Lonnie Smith were among several others who became free agents when their former teams did not offer new con­tracts. Those players can go anywhere, although clubs may wait to sign them until June 1 when it will not cost them a draft pick. 
Raines, Gedman and Guidry all talked with other clubs, but none of the proposals ap­proached offers they got from 


FESTIVAL 

Preakness and Belmont Stakes. 
Any 3-year-old competing in all three races also can earn a $1 million bonus by amassing the most points, which will be awarded on a basis of 5 for a win, 3 for second, and 1 for third. 
If 17 start, the Derby will be worth a record $793,600, with a record $618,600 to the winner. 
ABC will televise from 4:30 to 6 p.m. EDT. posttime will be 5:38p.m. 
Completing the Derby field are Shawklit Won, Templar Hill, Momentus, Avies Copy, Candi's Gold and No More Flowers. Templar Hill, Momentus and A vies Copy will

their former teams. That resulted in renewed charges of collusion by the players' union, which claims that owners have conspired to restrict free-agent movement and increasing salaries.

Hawks look to clinch after rude awakening 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -The In­diana Pacers may have caught the Atlanta Hawks looking ahead, a mistake they don't want to repeat when the clubs meet Friday for Game 4 in their best-of-five series NBA playoff. 
"We got a rude awakening," said Atlanta's Randy Wittman of Wednesday's 96-87 loss in Market Square Arena after the Hawks opened the series with two victories on their home court. 
Wittman, an Indianapolis na­tive and a member of the 1981 NCAA champion Indiana Uni­versity team, admitted the NBA's Central Division cham­pions "could have been looking ahead" to a, second-round matchup against Detroit. 
The Pistons, having swept their best-of-five series with Washington, can now rest while the Hawks and Pacers com­plete their series. Game 4 is scheduled Friday here at Mar­ket Square Arena and the final game, if necessary, will be Sun­day in Atlanta. 
Wittman also thought the home crowd of 12,303 provided some help in Indiana's first­ever NBA playoff victory. 
"The fans here are always great," he said. "I'm sure the crowd added a little spark to their (Pacers) game." 
Wittman, who had 15 points on seven-of-10 shooting from the field and one free throw,

and Dominique Wilkins, who 
led the Hawks with 22, had dif­
ferent ideas on how Atlanta can 
avoid playing a fifth game Sun­
day. 
"The Pacers played well 
defensively," Wittman said. 
"You can't take anything away 
from them. Still, I think we can 
play better offensively. 
"Our game is not 87 points. 
The last two games we've 
kinda stalled offensively. 
We've got to get back to basics 
screen and pass the ball." 
Wilkins, 19 points under his 
average in two victories at At­
lanta, said the Hawks didn't 
play good individual or team 
defense. 
"That's our strong point," he 
declared. 
Wilkins faced an array of 
defenders. But, it was rookie 
Chuck Person, who had 23 
points, 17 rebounds and seven 
assists that did the bulk of the 
bumping and grinding. 
"Person played well," said 
Wilkins, who was just nine of 
23 from the field Wednesday. 
"But we didn't play our type 
game. We didn't hit the boards. 
(Indiana outrebounded Atlanta 
42-31 and held the Hawks to 
three offensive rebounds.) I 
think we were looking to go 
home and get some rest for the 
next series. 
"We didn't come out to play. 
That's as simple as you can put 
it." 
Wilkins thinks the Hawks will 
respond better Friday night. 
"It's going to be tough, but if 
we play half as well as we did 
the other two games (in At­
lanta), we'll come out on top. 
"We have to come out attack­ing and not give 'em any breaks or easy baskets." 
The Pacers demonstrated the scoring balance that has them in the playoffs for only the second time since joining the NBA in 1976. Five players finished in double figures with Herb Williams contributing 19 points to the victory. 
"Our intensity and effort was magnificant," Indiana Coach Jack Ramsay said. 
"A lack of concentration and passing hurt us," said Atlanta Coach Mike Fratello. 
Bosox lose in brawl 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE -Jim Presley hit two home runs and Scott Bankhead held Boston to five hits as the Seattle Mariners beat the Red Sox 11-2 Thursday night in a game which featured two bench-clearing incidents and a full-scale brawl. 
Bankhead, 4-1, struck out seven and walked one. Loser Bruce Hurst, 2-3, was roughed up for seven runs in 3 2-3 in­nings as the Red Sox lost for the sixth time in their last seven games. 
In the fourth inning when Bankhead hit Mike Greenwell on the wrist. Greenwell,who homered in the second inning, charged the mound but no punches were thrown. 
In the seventh, Boston's Steve Crawford hit Presley in the ankle. Presley started for the mound but was wrestled down by catcher Marc Sul­livan. Many individual fights broke out and both Crawford and Red Sox Manager John McNamara were ejected.

Gooden adinits cocaine 'Inistake' as COIDIDISSioner gives warning 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK Dwight Gooden, warned by Commis­sioner Peter Ueberroth that he faces at least a one-year suspension if he goes back to drugs, admitted Thursday he made a mistake by using cocaine and said he hoped he could put his problem behind him. 
Gooden, who rejoined his New York Mets teammates 24 hours after ending a 28-day stay at a drug treatment cen­ter, will face frequent drug testing. 
"I know I made a mistake and I regret it, but I must turn the page once again because life goes on and I want to put all this behind me," Gooden said, reading from a prepared statement. "I want to get back to doing the things that I like, and that's playing baseball and having fun again." 
The 1985 Cy Young award winner appeared nervous and uncomfortable as he rushed through his remarks in less than a minute at a briefing at Shea Stadium. The Mets had said he would not answer ques­tions. 
Earlier, the 22-year-old pitcher was presented with his 1986 World Series ring and then spent a short time throwing from the mound and running in the outfield. He did not get any exercise other than climbing steps during his stay at the Smithers Alcoholism and Drug Treatment Center. 
The Mets hope Gooden can resume pitching in the. major 
June, but General Manager Frank Cashen emphasized the team would not hurry him. 
About the time Gooden ar­


rived at the stadium, Ueber-
..__. roth's office released a state­ment that said, "Any return to drug use will result in his suspension from baseball for a ..__. 
mimimum period of one year.'' 
The statement also said that Gooden will not be subject to disclipinary action if he con­tinues with the after-care pro­gram, which includes drug testing. 
"We wish Dwight Gooden well in his ongoing rehabilita­tion. We will continue to consult regularly with his doctors and the Mets regarding his prog­ress," the commissioner's statement said. 
Cashen said Greg Pavlick, the Mets' traveling minor pitching coach, would accom-
Mets rout Montreal 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK Rick Aguilera pitched hitless ball over the final eight innings and Keith Hernandez, Kevin McReynolds, Howard Johnson 
and Dave Magadan homered as the New York Mets defeated the Montreal Expos 11-3 Thursday night. 
Aguilera, 2-1, fell behind 3-0 

in the first inning on Tim Wal­
lach's RBI single and John 
Stefero's two-run homer,
Montreal's final hit. But he al­lowed only two baserunners over the final eight innings,

pany Gooden on the road once he comes back. But Cashen ad­mitted it would be impossible to monitor the right-hander's off-the-field activities. 
"I think he  can  be  on  his  
own," he said.  
Dr.  Alan  Lans,  associate  

director of Smithers Center, declined to discuss the specifics of Gooden's case and said the pitcher's recovery depends on his after-care pro­
gram. 
"Of people who do follow the program, we can look for suc­cess in 75 percent," Lans said. 
The Mets, who have tried to shield Gooden from the media since his arrival in the majors in 1984 at age 19, plan to be es­pecially protective now. 

The team's clubhouse was closed to the media after the briefing until after Thursday night's game against Montreal. Cashen said no one-on-one in­terviews with Gooden would be allowed in the near future. 
Mets Manager Davey Johnson said Gooden would begin 15 minutes of light throw­ing on Friday and would soon start throwing 10 minutes from the mound every other day. In about three weeks, the Mets hope Gooden can pitch three in­nings in a minor league game. 
Cashen speculated that Gooden could possibly make his 1987 major league debut after the Mets conclude a West Coast trip in the first week of June.

Midwest Catholic nteet on tap for Irish track 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
Tomorrow the Notre Dame track will battle with a short squad as it hosts the sixth an­nual Midwest Catholic Cham­pionships. 
The meet begins at 1 p.m. at the Monogram track behind the ACC. 
Marquette, DePaul and Detroit are the featured squads among the the eight-team field. The Irish expect the toughest competition to come from the Warriors, who have a well­balanced attack that features strong athletes in every event. They are particularly a threat with their distance crew, led by Mike McTiernan and Steve Orthman. 
Notre Dame should hold a sizeable advantage in the field events but will suffer overall with the loss of several team members to the National Invi­tational meet that takes place tomorrow in Indianapolis. 
The Irish will be without the services of senior captain Robert Nobles, junior Nick Sparks and freshman Mike O'Connor, and possibly junior Brian Driscoll and freshman Glenn Watson as well. 
The absence of these mem­bers may prove an important factor on the outcome of the meet. The recent perfor­mances of O'Connor and Wat­son will be missed and the gap will have to be filled by fellow teammates also performing well lately. 
"I think overall we stand a chance of winning the meet," said Irish head coach Joe Piane, "but when we start sen-

outscored Notre Dame in the second half, 10-1. 
"Michigan State is a very ag­gressive team," noted O'Leary. "They got the lead, and then they ran a lot. Since we were down, we had to run with them, and we wound up giving up a lot of goals." 
The Irish had their opportu­nities to stay in the game, but a missed shot here and a nice save there added up to a 16-5 loss in East Lansing. 
Brian McHugh scored the lone Irish goal in the second half, and co-captain Dave O'Neill and John McNicholas each had an assist in the game. 
The Irish lost more than a game at Michigan State. Senior John McLachlan, Notre Dame's leading scorer, separated his shoulder as he scored the tying goal and is questionable for Saturday's finale in Columbus, Ohio. 
Saturday's game shapes up to be another difficult contest for the Irish, as Ohio State fields a team similar to that of Michigan State. 
"They have a lot of speed and are a very aggressive team," commented O'Leary. "They may not be as talented as MSU, but they will definitely chal­

ding guys to other meets it weakens the team con­siderably and that does not help our chances." 
Even without the team at full strength, the Irish hope to do well enough to qualify more people for the IC4A and NCAA Championships before the season comes to an end. 
Garrett and sophomore Ron Markezich have come close to the IC4A qualifying time of 
13:57 in the 5,000-meter run with times of 14:10 and 14:11, respectively. And Watson, who has recorded a time of 14.08 in the 110-meter high hurdles, will try to shave his time down to 
13.88 to qualify as well. 
"Dan Garrett, David Warth and Watson have all been doing very well," said Piane, "and O'Connor has been doing a fine job."

Irish to face Xavier as season nears end 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Sports Writer 
Trying to end a disappointing season on a positive note, the Notre Dame baseball team will face Xavier at home Saturday, and goes to Northwestern Sun­day before returning home for the season finale against those same Wildcats Monday. 
Tomorrow's doubleheader with Xavier will start at noon in "Ethel Merman Day" at Jake Kline Field. The Irish face the Wildcats of Northwestern at 1 p.m. on the following day. The Irish plan to start Brian
 
Piotrowicz, Kevin Chenail and possibly Mike Passilla during the three games. 
"I haven't been able to see Xavier's team stats, but they have a lot of team speed and a good pitching staff," said Irish head coach Larry Gallo. "In Jeff Ahr, they have a guy who hits well and steals a lot of bases. "Northwestern is right around .500. They have some good tal­ent and a new coach this year." 
Gallo is hoping these games can help the Irish end the season with a little momentum after suffering through a year which close losses to Big Ten schools and unexpected losses to smaller schools have led to a 13-25 record heading into Thursday's doubleheader with DePauw. 
"My hope is that this team will end up on a winning note," said Gallo. "I don't think the team can go through more ad­versity than it has this year. We haven't had any injuries, but besides that everything that can possibly go wrong has. We just have to keep looking ahead and can't look back." 
Two slumps during the season have hurt Notre Dame's record during the year. The Irish lost eight-straight games early in the season, including four close contests with In­diana, Wisconsin and Michigan State. More recently, the team has lost five-of-six games to Butler, St. Louis, Western Mic­higan, and Purdue, in which 
Irish split at DePauw 
Special to The Observer 
GREENCASTLE, Ind. -Jim Hebert went 2-for-2, scored three runs and stole two bases to lead DePauw to a 5-3 win over Notre Dame and a split of their doubleheader in non­conference college baseball Thursday. 
The Irish won the opener 13-3. 

Joe Klupchak drove in the other two Tiger runs in the second game on a single and a bunt. 
Freshman Ed Kelly, 3-1, went the distance for the win in the second game. 
Mike Coffey evened out his record at 2-2 with the loss. 
In the first game, first baseman Kim Hutson hit a two­run homer to start a four-run third inning for Notre Dame, 14-26. 
Tom Shaw, 3-1, claimed the win for the Irish. Brice Dun­shee, 2-4, took the loss for DePauw, now 16-14. 
every game could have gone either way. 
"We're like 6-14 in games decided in the last inning, extra innings, or in games decided by two runs or less," said Gallo. "If a few of those could have gone the other way, it could have been a lot different. 

"We play a lot of good teams. We're right with them, but they keep just having a little bit more. Being competitive doesn't win you any games, but I can say we're very competi­tive," said Gallo. "It'd have a really appeasing effect to win these after games after what we've gone through the last three weeks. It's been a very trying season, and most of our Not enough scenes like this have cost the Notre players will be back next Dame baseball some close games. In his story season."

Era draws to close in weekend tennis action 
By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
As the Notre Dame men's tennis team plays its matches this weekend, it will be more than just the wrap up of the reg­ular season. It will be the end of an era. The matches against Michigan State and Kalamazoo mark the last days of Tom Fal­lon's coaching career at Notre Dame. 
And what a career it has been. Fallon is the winningest coach in Notre Dame history, and his 516-201 record over 34 years is nothing short of in­credible. This year's team has overcome a slow start because of injuries to put together an­other typically fine Fallon season. 
"The 1959 NCAA champion­ship team was the best team, no doubt," said Fallon, looking back on his career. "But I wouldn't trade any season, win or lose, for anything." 
The word 'lose' has not often been a part of the men's tennis team vocabulary during Fal­lon's tenure. Only two of his teams have had losing seasons, and ten have topped the twenty victory mark, including the 1987 squad. The 1959 champions went 14-0, and the 1966 team had 15 victories without a defeat. 
Not only have the teams been winners on the court, but the members have also made thier marks academically. Fallon has always been an Irish coach who emphasizes the student in student-athlete. 
"The teams have been great, but we've always kept tennis in the proper prospective," said Fallon. "Most every player has graduated and is doing well. We've had fun with the game but never lost sight of the main objective -a college degree. season, the Irish record stands That's the most important at 22-11 going into the final thing." home weekend. Fallon doesn't

think his leaving has provided any extra incentive for the team. 
"That's a nice thought," he said. "We had the injuries ear­ly, but now everyone is playing well, playing up to potential. 
When that happens, things fall into place. 
"Once you get on a win streak, there's extra incentive to keep it up." 
The Irish try to continue the streak against Michigan State tomorrow and Kalamazoo Sun­Tom Fallon

This year's team matches up "We're going to have two favorably to those of the past. really good matches," The Irish are working to make predicted Fallon.

Call this the dead letter office if you will. Or bet­ter, spring cleaning. There are a few things left to touch on before clearing out for the summer. 
First, pro wrestling. I love it. So it's fake. So what? They used to pack 'em in at the Coliseum for Christians and Lions, and everyone knew who was gonna win that one. Pro wrestling is a chance to go scream and have a great time. 
It's classic good guys anp bad guys. It lets out a lot of stress and aggression, especially if you've pulled an all-nighter the night before to get that government paper handed in on time. It's not a pure sport but for a good time, pro wrestling can't be beat. 
Second, Bookstore Basketball. Steve Wenc and his crew indeed are to be commended for this year's tourney. After a sticky situation with team names, the 16th edition of the tourney had some great games and teams. The refereeing wasn't that great, and the final was marred by racial slurs, but it was a super tourney. 
Third, Wrigley Field. Up until Wednesday, I had been privileged to see the Cubs lone home win on my first trip to the friendly confines. If you've never been, go. It's a super park. 
We sat upstairs, way upstairs, but the view was still perfect. Of course with the wind blowing it was it's a Big Ten school, so that's always a tough challenge for us." 
Kalamazoo will be another challenge for the Irish, who narrowly defeated them last season, 5-4. 
"Like Michigan State, they have a good record and nearly identical scores against teams we've both played," said Fal­lon. 
So Coach Fallon will take his .720 winning percentage into retirement and leave his young team and incredible legacy to his successor. This seems to be a year of good-byes at Notre Dame, and, as in the cases of Father Hesburg and Father Joyce, the sucessor will have a hard time following the career of Tom Fallon. 
"It's been very wonderful, very enjoyable," said Fallon of his long career. "Good people, good times, and good tennis." 
Lax faces OSU after MSU loss 
BY CHRIS DALLAVO Sports Writer 
Let's just say, it wasn't pretty. The Notre Dame lacrosse team fell Wednes­day to a hungry Michigan State squad by a 16-5 score and now must face a similar Ohio State team Saturday in a showdown for second place in the Great Lakes Conference. 
"They (Michigan State) played par­ticularly well, and we didn't," said an obviously disappointed Head Coach, Rich O'Leary. "They came out with fire in their eyes and took it to us." 
O'Leary wasn't kidding. The Spar­tans scored twice before Notre Dame was able to even touch the ball, and it was 3-0 before the Irish finally set up its offense. 
When the offense finallly arrived, it was effective. Goals by freshman midfielder Mike Quigley and juniors Tom Lanahan and Art Brady tightened the game up. When John McLachlan tallied, the score was knotted at four. 
Unfortunately for the Irish, that would be the lone highlight of the after­noon, as Michigan State went on to take a 6-4 halftime lead. The Spartans then

Fourth, Special Olympics. If you're going to be here this summer, try to help if you can. You won't regret it. The event here will be at true Notre Dame moment. Don't miss out. 
Fifth, some personal goodbyes. The first to Irish men's tennis coach Tom Fallon. One of my first stories for The Observer was on his team, and this weekend he will coach in his final two matches of his 34-year career. Wait a minute, didn't somebody named Hesburgh begin his job a year before that? Both he and Fallon have pretty good records. The second goodbye, although it's not really goodbye, is to Irish hockey coach Lefty Smith. I spent most of last year's season as the hockey beat writer and got to know Smith pretty well. After interviews, he always had a few minutes just to chat. 
While Smith won't be behind the boards for the Irish for the first time in 19 years, he will be over at the new Loftus Indoor Athletic Facility currently under construction. Still it will be odd not to have the man who brought hockey back to Notre Dame after a 41-year absence on the bench. 
The third goodbye is to women's basketball coach Mary Distanislao. She is simply· a class act. I re­member interviewing her at midseason when the Irish were in more than just trouble, yet she an­swered all questions about the situation forthrightly and honestly. We also had an ongoing and friendly verbal sparring match throughout the season after I wrote some snide comment about about her team's new 'gold' uniforms. Myself and the rest of the sports staff will miss her. She is a good friend. But, Coach, those uniforms, yech. 
Finally, I'd like to say thank you to all the Irish coaches and administrators who took time out from their hectic schedules and talk to my writers. We really appreciate it. The same goes to the Sports Information Department. They are the most most cooperative and helpful people. Thanks from all of us for all your help. See you in the fall.
