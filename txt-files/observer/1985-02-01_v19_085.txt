Faculty insurance revised by senate 
By BOB MUSSELMAN 
StaffReporter 
Progress has been made in the Faculty Senate's bid to influence fac­ulty health care coverage, according to former senate Chairman Associ­ate Professor Mario Borelli and cur­rent Vice Chairman Associate Professor Donald Barrett. 
"We now have a three-choice health insurance plan," said Borelli. 
The senate took notice of the issue at a meeting in September of 1983, when Borelli told the senate he had voiced "various concerns, both with economic and procedural matters" to University Provost Timothy O'Meara after reviewing the terms of a new group health in­surance plan implemented that sum­mer. 
Under the previous program, faculty essentially paid nothing for insurance. The new plan required those covered to pay a deductible and a co-insurance fee (a certain percentage of the total) on certain medical services, but a premium was not charged. 
The purpose of this change was to "get people more directly involved" with the payment of rising health care costs, according to G. Thomas Bull, director ofpersonnel. 
Having not been consulted and feeling that the new program in­tended to combat rising costs "was not the best solution," the faculty objected, according to Barrett. 
The Faculty Affairs Committee, then headed by Barrett, conducted a one-year study in order to present the administration with "options that might be improvements." The group made 11 recommendations to the administration, recommen­dations Barrett said were both sensitive to the budgetary concerns of the University and to the health care needs ofthe faculty and staff in­volved. 
In November of 1984, the admin­istration implemented a new

Students apathetic to goverttment, according to Ombudsman Sllirvey 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI 
StaffReporter 
According to a recent Om­budsman survey 74 percent of stu­dents polled could not name their student senate representive and 45 percent could not name the student body president. 
"Student government is laughed at," said Javier Oliva, district five senator, "Many students don't take it seriously." Oliva said he believes this year's senate has done more than any recent senate. Oliva cited the student-run general store and t­shirt shop as examples. 
However, students "just aren't paying attention," said Oliva. 
In the first 17 meetings ofthe sen­ate this year, all of which were open to the public, less than five students attended. District four senator Tom Abood said, "People should take more interest." 
Another reason cited for the lack ofstudent knowledge about student government is the difficulty in get­ting the senators' newsletters into the hands of students. Paul Healy, district one senator, said, "If there are two people in a room only one will get them." 
District two senator Pat Browne issued 18 newsletters. They were either never delivered to the mailboxes or thrown away, accor­ding to Browne. 
Healy said many ofthe senate's ac­tivities are "too trivial, and not worth reading about." Bertino said, "People don't want to read Observer articles" concerningsenate activity. 
Bertino said he feels many stu­dents are just not interested in who represents them, and that "only at election time" do students care. "They lose interest after the elec­tion," Bertino said. 
Abood said students take interest "only at peak times" when their senator has done something newsworthy. 
Abood believes the results of the poll may have been different iftaken at a different time and he would like to see a more comprehensive poll with more students involved. 
juniorJerry Murphy ofGrace Hall feels there is apathy among the stu­dent body towards student govern­ment. He and freshman Paul Cottey, of Cavanaugh Hall, admit they don't take student government that

In Brief A few ideas for Commencement 1985 
The Navy ROTC change-of-command ceremony took place yesterday afternoon in Stepan Center. The event marked the transfer of command from Midshipman First Class Robert McMonagle to the new Battalion Commanding Officer, Midshipman Second Class Michael Leary. Leary, a Marine option candidate, is a junior from Philadelphia in the Program of-Liberal Studies. Prior to attending Notre Dame, Leary served four years in the Marine Corps..

rested last week after strolling un-invited into the White House, "hears voices" and spent time in a mental hospital last june, accor· ding to documents filed in District of Columbia Superior Court. Latta, a watt·r meter reader, was arrested one floor below President Reagan's living quarters on Jan. 20, just hours before Reagan was sworn in for a second term. He was found in a ceremonial area ofthe White House near where the president took the oath. Psychiatrist Norman L. Wilson, who interviewed Latta in his cell, reported that Latta had told him "he wanted to enter the White House to see the president." He had been in a mental hospital in June and "he hears voices saying, "You blew it," Wilson said. -AP 
The comatose youth shot with three other teen· agers by Bernhard Goetz last month in a subway train had a $50 million lawsuit filed in his name Wednesday against Goetz.

Police, citing witnesses' accounts of the Dec. 22 incident, have said the youths stood surrounding Goetz while one demanded the money. -AP

Although the announcement of this year's com­
mencement speaker is probably two months away and 
May 18th is even further, many seniors are picking up 
the topic of who will be the keynote speaker for the 
event that celebrates their four years ofhard work here. 
What if I, or some other plain old student, were to 
make the decision on whom to invite? What would we 
consider in making the choice? 

Obviously, that is not the case, but the question still 
remains. How is this man (or woman, as the case may 
be) chosen? 

I don't think information is distributed on what kind 
of profile Notre Dame wants in its speaker. The 
qualifications are probably very broad in scope, yet 
since University President Father Theodore Hesburgh 
is intimately involved in the choice, what are the 
criteria he uses? 

So, in order to satisfy my curiosity, I spoke with Fa­
ther Hesburgh personally. 
I've always thought that 
my peculiar name was a det· 
riment to meeting people, 
so I wasn't surprised when 
he asked me to repeat 

Choosing a
"Theron" after I identified 
myself. 
Hesburgh was quite open in telling me what he looks for. "We want to get some­one who is a household name. When Ronald Reagan came here, the news was carried across the nation," he explained. "We'd also like the person to have a point-of-view that is ofinter­est to the students." 

"The hardest part is fin­ding someone with a Notre Dame connection. Sometimes we find someone with one, and sometimes not." 
So far, he's on the right track in my book. And Notre Dame has been very succesful at attracting such people. Everyone remembers Reagan, then Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and Chicago Archbishop Joseph Bernardin. They all were great selections. 
Come to think ofit, the person whom I'd like to have there the most is Father Hesburgh himself. In the first two of three formal occasions held on campus during a student's four years · freshman orientation and Junior Parents Weekend· this year's senior class has not seen Hesburgh fully participate in either. 
Father john Van Wolvear celebrated Mass upon our arrival to Notre Dame. Father Hesburgh presided over the Mass during our junior-year doldrums, but did not say the homily and was rushed out the doors ofthe ACC afterwards, presumably on his way to another impor­tant destination. 
Theron Roberts 
Sports Copy Editor 
He assured me he would be at commencement, though, along with the chosen "great" speaker. Yes, fel­low seniors, our commencement destiny has already been written. 
After a disappointing, if not controversial, person made the address last year, I am getting pretty curious thinking about who will speak to the graduates. 
I'm sorry the class of 1984 was the victim ofthe Loret Ruppe experiment. Evidently, Notre Dame was a late entry into the commencement speaker sweepstakes. But if that result led to lan­ding a more suitable person to take the speaker's plat· form this year, that's fine
~ with me. 
I I I I Too bad I didn't get in I' ' touch with Father Hesburgh a little sooner. I could have lent him a couple of household names · my great ideas on the pecfect choice. 
How about Joe Montana? Nearly everybody remem­bers the fine career he had playing football for the Fighting Irish. Those who don't surely heard Notre Dame mentioned along with Montana's name in the Super Bowl. 
Or maybe rock star Madonna, whose name is even similar to that ofour Uni­versity. I know a lot ofpeople anxious to hear her views on the upcoming U.S.· Soviet nuclear arms talks. 
Let's just say I'm glad not to be responsible for making the selection. I'll stick to bringing up the subject over lunch and worrying about making it to graduation day.

Berkeley offers land and plumbing to area denizens of motor vehicles 
The city and the residents of "Rainbow Village" along a two-block stretch ofsemi-industrial Fifth Street also are trying to keep quiet about the location of the lot. Castellanos said the lot is about 18,000 square feet, fenced, and has portable toilets and showers. 
Details -such as who pays how much for towing disabled vehicles to their new home, shower rentals and other costs -were worked out yesterday but some people were already moving in on Wednesday. 
The campaign to move the denizens of "Rainbow Village" began when local residents and busi­ness people began complaining that the neighborhood had been taken over in the past two years by the un, employed, transients and others living along the street. 
The newcomers have complained that they can't afford to pay local rents and have nowhere to go. A

"I hate to see them out in the cold, but contrarily, with all the publicity, we're getting a lot of new vehicles coming in," said Marion Hammond, a neighborhood resident since World War II and freelance photog­rapher. Temperatures often get down into the low 40s on winter nights. 
Castellanos said the city was forced to do something, not only to help the homeless but to solve health and safety problems created by people living in close quarters without showers, toilets or running water. 
"We think we're going to be able to provide a humane answer to a very complex question," said Castel­lanos. "The main thing is to get them off the streets and into some loca­tion."

Student Affairs CoJmmittee considers male/femlale ratio 
ByLORIZAPF 
News Staff 
A proposal to increase the percentage of women admitted to Notre Dame has recently been pre­sented to the Student Affairs Com­mittee ofthe Board ofTrustees. 
The proposal, sponsored by Lyons 
Hall PresidentJoan Cahill, suggested 
the number of men admitted be 
decreased and the number of wo­
men admitted increased. 
Cahill presented the proposal to 
the Student Affairs Committee prior 
to Christmas break. 
Recently, Cahill and Cathy David, 
student body vice president, met 
with Terry Keating, president of the 
National Alumni Board, to promote 

Kirk's rivals were united in back­ing a propm.al to require a new elec­tion for the at-large members. The present group, whose terms expired yesterday, is composed primarily of Kirk supporters. 
Kirk has the backing of organized labor. Wh:ile the AFL-CIO an· nounced it was not taking a position in the race, labor officials have been pushing hard for Kirk. 
Pelosi has strong support in her home state as well as from Gov. Mario Cuomo ofNew York. 
Sanford's backing was centered among sou1hern party leaders with additional support from the Ohio and Pennsylvania chairmen.

Sister Keating, president of the Sisters of St. Joseph in Springfield, a teaching order, said the letter to Regan was approved by the Sisters of Providence, who run hospitals in Holyoke and Worcester; the Sisters of Mercy, .another nursing order with hospitals in Rhode Island, Con­necticut, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire; as well as the Sisters of St. Joseph in Boston, Sisters ofNotre Dame in Connecticut and Boston and Dominican Sisters in Boston. 
the equal access admissions policy. 
The option of increasing the total number of students admitted each year is opposed by Cahill and David because it would push total enroll­ment over the set limit of 10,000. 
Long-range plans for the Univer­sity includt: the addition of one more men's dorm and several more women's dorms. 
The original presentation made by Cahill wlill eventually be sent to each trustet:. The issue will be pre­sented at the February Board meeting by Keating. 
Board member Philip Hawley has shown interest in the topic and will be influential in the board's deci­sions concerning a modified admis­sions policy. said Cahill.

Administration stops Middle East arms sales 
AsSQC!ated Press 

WASHINGTON -The Reagan ad­ministration is suspending all new arms sales to the Middle East while it reviews the defense needs of Israel and moderate Arab nations, White House spokesman Larry Speakes said yesterday. 
Speakes said the review is ex­pected to be completed in four to six weeks, and that it will not inter­fere with shipments of spare parts and weapons already destined for the region. 
He declined to call the action a suspension of sales, emphasizing that arms shipments would not "come to a scree,·hing halt." 
However, he said the administra­tion would not send any new re­quests for arms sales to Congress while the review is under way. 
"I think we will have to wait until the study is complete before we proceed with any sales request to
,. 
Congress," Speakes said. ,.r The spokesman said the review will not include a re-examination of
r 
r President Reagan's 1982 blueprint for peace in the Middle East. 
The action came as Reagan con­tinued to press his case for the MX nuclear missile system and a large military budget with members ofthe House Armed Services Committee. 
And one day earlier, Reagan promised visiting Israeli Defense

developed a series of medical tests he will perform on himself in an ef­fort to shed some light on the space sickness that has affected many shuttle astronauts early in flight. 
Garn and the other six crew mem­bers discussed the mission at a news conference and in a daylong series of interviews with rt·porters. They are scheduled to be launched Feb. 20 for a four-day trip aboard Chal­lenger. 
The other crew members are commander Karol Bobko, pilot Donald Williams, mission specialists Dr. Rhea Seddon, David Griggs and Jeffrey Hoffman, and payload spe­cialist Patrick Baudry, a French astronaut. 
Garn said that on launching he will wear a battery ofsensors to mea­sure various body responses to lift­off forces and the sudden entry into weightless space. 
"One will measure if the gut or bowel shuts down," the senator said. "Several shuttle astronauts have vomited, but few of them have suf­fered nausea or perspiration. So we're checking to see ifthe vomiting might be caused by a bowel shut­down." 
He said he also will wear devices to measure blood pressure, body fluid transfer and hrain waves. 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin the president would ask Congress to approve S1.8 billion in military aid for the coming fiscal year. lbat would be an in­crease of S400 million over the 1985 grant level. 
Although Speakes allowed that "there could be changes" because of the review, he said the administra­tion did not anticipate any "fundamental changes in our policy or commitments to the region." 
He described it as a "comprehensive look at security­related issues in the area ... a refined overview." 
Speakes said the study was aimed at providing Congress with a com­prehensive "justification and rationale" for administration proposals in the Middle East. 
He denied that there was any con­nection between the temporary halt in arms sales and the scheduled Feb. I 1 visit of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd. But he added that the study will not preclude discussions ofarms sales to Saudi Arabia or Egypt.

Do not come back until you can appreciate 
Dear Editor: 

The letter by one Sister Maurita concerning the students' "reprehensible" behavior at the Notre Dame -DePaul basketball game pro­vided me with a much-needed laugh. In fact, it was more ofan outburst. 
Obviously, Sister Maurita does not under­stand the meaning of the term "home-court advantage." The purpose of home games is to allow students to support their team, which invariably involves taunting the opposition. 
were not meant to be taken literally, we are still faced with his words on the cross: "Father, forgive them, they do not know what they are doing." Perhaps the reference to God as Fa­ther is enough to convince Ms. Pettifer that the whole line is a figment of a male chauvinist's imagination. 
Pettifer may be right when she states that a new breed of non-woman is on the move. Sadly, this new breed seems to be moving away from the heart ofChristianity in its haste to become socially active. Social justice is im­portant, but not as important as our eternal welfare.

students from being worthily educated. Stu­dents who rely upon federal assistance to fund their education will have one hell of a time paying for four years at Harvard, Princeton, M.I.T., or any other institution in which one year oftuition, room and board can cost more than S 13,000, without such aid. 
The second proposal exhibits the ridiculous nature of these recommendations. By not pertnitting special circumstances to concern student loan approval the Reagan ad­ministration is disregarding that some families have many children or others have extraordi­nary medical bills and that these families rely heavily upon the $2,500 loan to cover the cost ofhigher education. 
The wealthy will continue to indulge them­selves in education while prohibiting the less fortunate, though in many cases more deserv­ing, of the same advanuage. 
I think Barry McCarty, director of financial aid at Lafayette College, best stated the case. In a recentNew York Times editorial McCarty said, "If enacted, these proposals will in­evitably produce a greater stratification in higher education, one based not on ability to benefit from a p~ll'ticular institution but simply on the strength of the family check­book."

Y
ou know that Greenwich Village isn't the permissive, Bohemian place it used to be when non­smokers make scenes in public if you light up a cigarette. Four times over Christmas as I was eating in classless joints, I was asked by diners at distant tables to stop 
·smoking. God wouldn't have given us coffee to linger over if He hadn't intended for us to enjoy them with cigarettes. Four meals were ruined for me by obnoxious strangers, whose air space I wasn't breathing on, who didn't like the idea of my using tobacco in the world they wanted to keep to themselves. Greenwich Village's greatest attrac­tion has always been its tolerance. Now the blue noses are clamoring for smokeless public rooms. I've never met a blue nose I thought was fair. · 
I may be the only priest in America who is fighting for smoker's rights. It's the smugness of non-smokers that drives me crazy, their self-righteousness that drives me up the wall. I've spent three quarters of my life learning to be open minded. I've taken the time to learn respect for lifestyles and minority members whose preferences are wild. Women who wear eye makeup, for example, remind me of the cosmeticians who wax the faces of the newly em­balmed. Nobody who goes with you to dinner should have a face belong­ing on the freshly dead. Men who chew gum should be arrested as a public nuisance. Who wants to watch a wad of Wrigley's shift across the mouth from one bulging cheek to another? Later they'll lose the gum in a place you're bound to step on. Nothing ruins your day quicker than a gummy shoe. I've walked through neighborhoods in the Village where there's been a role reversal; men wear mascara, and girls chew gum. Instead of staying angry, I remind myself that people, despite their crummy habits, deserve my love and respect, and it's none of my business if they're marching to the beat ofa different drummer. "Live and let ljve," they say. Not many folk have been saying it lately to us smokers. 


I wouldn't mind giving up smoking. A cigarette as a friend isn't entirely trustworthy. The first mil­lion cigarettes can leave you cough­ing. The second million can leave you dead. Last summer in the vil­lage, I attended a session ofSmokers Anonymous at the Episcopal Church. People introduced them­selves with their case histories: "My name is Bert. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm gay. You name it, and I've done it, including hard drugs. I've been sober for a year, and clean of tobacco for a month." 
Or, "Hello. I'm Cynthia. I'm a bi-sexual alcoholic just starting the program. I've been sober for a week, and I'm trying to kick cigarettes." Or, ''I'tn Richie. I'm an alcoholic and straight, Tonight I celebrate my tenth birthday on the program, booze-free and butt-free." 
There was a round ofapplause for Richie's sobriety, and he was pre­sented with a cake with ten candles to blow out. In the meantime, I was getting nervous. I wasn't there to present myself as a case history. Before I had to tell them of my pleasant involvement with Pall Malls, they all took a coffee break so 
-they could eat Richie's cake. Half of them lit up cigarettes over the second cup ofcoffee. I could see that Smokers Anonymous as the overflow ofan Alcoholics Anonymous meeting wasn't the place where I could find help, and so I left. I would work harder to give up smoking, if the non-smokers would 
Friday, February 1, 1985-page 8-9 
leave the smokers alone, because smoking isn't so wonderful. The blue noses have begun their crusade, and I'd rather fight them than switch. Wh~tt gets my dander up is that the non-smokers want to leave me no choice. I'm turned off in the way some ofthe women clamoring to be ordained are turned off. They're not passionate to become clergy, but they're as mad as hornets at the Pope for telling them he will not let them be clergy. I'll probably die ofruined lungs, the victim ofa habit dear to my heart only because ofthe princi­-­ple ofthe thing. 
Now, according to Time maga­zine, the R.). Reynolds Company is coming out with the last word in smoking chic -dt:signer cigarettes. In March, Reynolds will begin test­marketing Ritz, a brand that will feature the Yves Saint Laurent logo on the package. The country needs designer cigarett~s like a hole in the head. As a smoker, I'll be cheering for a company giving those ofus favoring nicotine a status symbol. 
"Why do you do it?" a reporter asked the mountain climbers who were attempting the ascent of Mt. Everest. "Becaust: it's there," they replied. They knew the danger, and they were willing to take the risk. "Why do you smoke· cigarettes?" I couldn't answer, "Because they're there." To tell the truth, I had to go and get them. I do it for the same reasons people do anything foolish, like driving a sports car 200 miles per hour on an icy road: for the poetry of the thing, without which life would be lonllier and duller. Every person nee·ds a controlling vice, to keep the other vices dor­mant. I prefer a v:ice that the Church has never condemned as illegal, immoral ur fattening. The blue noses will kc:ep me smoking until the poetry has burned down to nothing, as wo.rthless to joy as white ash left in tile tray. The altern­ative is to quit, and join the Puritans. God doesn't have room in His wide, blue heaven for the blue noses. I'd rather smoke here, than burn later.

In Inter hall hockey 
Grace, Alumni win with d.efense 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN 
Sports Writer 
Defense was the key word in the third week of interhall hockey ac­tion. Strong blue-line play and re­sponsible goaltending profited Alumni and Grace Halls in both of their victories. 
In its first outing of the season, Alumni used tough defensive tactics to down previously unbeaten Zahm 5-1. By bringing its wings back into the defensive zone to assist the defensemen, Alumni limited Zahm to just six shots on the night. After a tight 2-1 first period, Alumni broke the game open with three second­period goals to ease the pressure on netminder Paul Zaremba. Each of Alumni's three lines contributed to in the victory as John Keltenmark, Brian Aquado, Mark Nemec, Bill Nemec, and Tom Krus each re­corded single goals. 
Charlie Hackett notched Zahm's lone tally. Hackett has scored in each of Zahm's three games, includ­ing two game-winners. 
Alumni captain Ed Domansky said his team's long layoff didn't affect its play.

"Everyone was really excited to fi­nally be able to play. We had scrimmaged the night before the Zahm game and lost," Domansky said. "It didn't really bother us, though. We got ~together and realized that now it was for keeps. We wanted to to go out and play someone for real." 
Goaltending was the key in Grat:e's 3-0 victory over Flanner. Grace came out flat after tying a tough Off-Campus team last Thursday, but goalie Pat Chura thwarted Flanner's bid to catch Grace on the rebound. Grace got balanced scoring from Lance Wil­liams, Jim Rataczck, and Kevin Stone in the winning effort. · In other action, Jay Lewis of the combined Cavanaugh-Howard squad scored in the final minutes of the third period to tie Morrissey 2-2. Morrissey had held the lead on goals by team captain Ted Gradel and Tim O'Brien.

In the field events the pressure will be on senior James Patterson to win the long jump and triple jump as he did last year. High-jumper lloyd Constable is also expected to con­tinue his winning ways. 
Saturday will also mark the return of sophomore Jeff Van Wie, who is coming back from a severe car acci­dent. He won the 800-yard run last year and will compete in the 1000 tomorrow. 
"Although the game was a tie, it was really fun to play because both teams were so evenly matched. It was really competitive throughout," Gradel said ofthe game. 
In the only other game scheduled for earlier in the week, Fisher for­feited to Pangborn due to lack of players. With the forfeit, Fisher's record fell to 0-4. With the two points, Pangborn gained a share of the Corrigan Division lead with Stan­ford and Zahm. Alumni is two points behind the leaders. Alumni and Stan­ford faced each other late last night. In another late-nighter, Off-Campus tangled with Morrissey.

The annual Saint Mary's-Notre Dame swim met"t should be another fine display of women's swimming from both campuses. Traditionally the rivalry between the two schools has not been a close one, however, with the Irish women getting the best of the Saint Mary's team. 
'lbe Belles will be entering the meet on Saturday after a post­Christmas loss to Calvin College on january 23rd. The team wa~ sched­uled to face Albion College in Mic­higan on January 25th but severe weather conditions hampered their trip and the Belles continued to prepare for the Irish. 
The women from both teams were able to train together when Notre Dame and Saint Mary's traveled to Sanjuan, Puerto Rico for a I 0-day, intensive training session. 'lbe Belles were able to get four hours of water time each day due to the optimum weatht"r conditions 
and Coach Dan Flynn thinks this will 
help them during the rest of the 
season. 
"The trip went very well," Flynn said. "We had excellent training facilities and I think the girls are now in good physical shape." 
The culmination of the San juan trip for both teams was a competion held at the Pan American Games Natatorium which featured more than 20 teams from all over the United States who had trained in Puerto Rico over the holiday. 
Although the Belles are missing their top two swimmers from last year, Gail Casey and Rosie Whalen, senior captain Ellen Byrne will try to lead her teammates to a high-scoring competition. Byrne will be seen in the short-distance freestyle while teammate juniorjoyce Murtagh will try to better her performance in the middle-distance freestyle events.

Chargers to avenge losses 
Hockey team travels to Huntsville 

By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -Both the Notre Dame and Alabama-Huntsville hockey teams have had a chance to play at each other's arena. And each time the home team has emerged with a sweep. 
Last February, the Irish ventured to the Von Braun Civic Center unde­feated in Central States Collegiate Hockey League play and hoping to win the league title. 
The Chargers were also unde­feated and had the same thoughts on their minds and came away with 6-5 and 6-4 victories before raucous 
crowds  in  excess  of 6,000  each  
night.  
Hoping  to  avenge  those  two  

defeats, Notre Dame welcomed Huntsville to the ACC for two con­tests on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 of this season. The Irish more than made up for the defeats in the South by taking convincing 10-4 and 8-4 wins. 
Notre Dame is once again back here in Dixie, but this time there is no league title on the line. The Irish 
SMC-ND rivalry set in swim meet 
Dugan and Susan Ridenhour will see some stiff competition again on the boards when they face the experi­enced Irish women. 
With the current season record at 0-2, the Belles are eager to test their improvement from their San Juan training trip and tomorrow's meet will be a good place to do it. The Belles will not only be facing the rival Irish team but an even bigger opponent -the clock. 
( 6-14) are out to prove that they are 
a better team than their current 
record shows. They would also like 
to find a way to end the jinx which 
has left them winless in 10 tries away 
from home this season. 
"I think we'll see a much better 

club than the one that was at Notre 
Dame at the end ofNovember," said 
Irish head coach Lefty Smith. "We 
will have a very difficult time down 
here." 
The contests between the 

Chargers ( 14-6) and the Irish have 
regularly emerged a~ hard-hitting, 
penalty-filled affairs, but this time 
each coach is emphasizing the im­
portance of staying out of the 
penalty box. 
"We're looking forward to a good 

series," said Huntsville head coach 
Doug Ross. "Notre Dame is a good 
team. They really took it to us in 
South Bend in some penalty-filled 
games, so this time I'm telling our 
kids that if we get a solid effort, take 
advantage of our chances and stay 
out ofthe penalty box, we'll do fine." 
"Officiating is a very difficult thing to predict in this area," said Smith. "It can have a very big effect on the game. But the way to avoid prob­lems is to keep sticks down and not get cheap." 
In the series at Notre Dame, 57 penalties were called, 28 against the Irish. 
But one aspect which Smith was pleased with despite all of the penalties was the fact that I 0 of 18 Notre Dame goals were scored in specialty situations, either on the powerplay (four times), or while each team was shorthanded. 
Huntsville is led by sophomore right wing Dave Wallenstein with 23 goals and 33 assists. Left wing Mike Finn is four points off the pace with 
3 I goals and 21 assists. Center Brian 
Kelly holds the third spot with 48 
points and I 7 goals. 
Steve Moerner is the top Charger 
goalie with a 3.79 GAA in 11 games. 
Ross is counting on a strong perfor­
mance from him this weekend. 
"Steve was not at his peak the last time we played Notre Dame," said Ross. "This time a good performance from him could help us tremen­dously." 
The Irish will go with junior Marc Guay tonight. Guay has looked sharp in his last two outings, including the 6-3 victory over Lake Forest jan. 23 which stopped an eight-game losing skid for the Irish. 
In the injury department, junior Left wing Dave Waldbillig will be out of action again with a separated shoulder suffered in the second­round loss to Lake Forest in the Forester Classic two weeks ago. 
"Dave's loss will hurt," explained Tim Reilly. "He's a consistent player for us. But if we get a good effort from everyone, we will come out all right." 
It is homecoming weekend, here, and once again crowds in access of 6,000 are expected each night. 
"They're trying to build a program and our beating them kind of set them back," offered Reilly. "They'll be out to prove to their fans that last year was for real. Ifwe can beat them in front ofbig crowds, it will be even better for us."

After a three-week rest, the Irish fencing squads will get back into the swing of things tonight against pe­rennial power Wayne State in Wayne, Mich. 
Wayne State boasts the title of 1984 NCAA National Champions in men's fencing, and there is little doubt that the 19-1 Irish would like nothing more than to dethrone the champs this spring after the Irish finished third in last year's NCAA tourney. 
Due to the harsh weather of a week ago, the Irish were unable to participate in a nine-team tourna­ment at Ohio State. According to Irish Head Coach Mike DeCicco, the Irish might be slightly rusty due to their inactiveness in competitive events. 
"Last weekend, we were stranded here when the snow fell," said DeCicco, "and we didn't get to fence any of the schools that we had planned to in preparation for Wayne State. 
"We haven't had any competitive fencing since January 13. I had planned to have this meet last weekend to get us back on track," DeCicco continued. "If anything, last weekend's sit-out may make us a little stale, and I hate going up a against a team like Wayne State with any excuses not to be at our best." 
Last year the Irish men suffered their only loss in a 20-meet season in a dual meet to the eventual champs, 12-1 5. While the Irish did out-fence Wayne State in the Great Lakes Championships last season and took first in the process, they were outdone in the NCAA tourney, fal­ling short by 15 points. 
Overall, Notre Dame has a posi­tive mark of23-14lifetime against its arch-rivals. 

While the Taters lost some key fencers to graduation and transfer, they have entered the 1985 season with an equal or superior team to last year's squad. 
"Wayne State might be as good as they were last year and maybe even a little better," said DeCicco. 
Leading the defending champions is 1984 Epee Champion Ettore Bianchi. Joining Bianchi are fresh­men Michele Giulietti and Guillermo Lande. This far into the season, the young Giulietti is unde­feated at 1 5-0 and is leading a squad that is 36-9. 
"They've got two kids to go along with Ettore Bianchi in epee that could make them a pretty nice epee team -a very competitive one in fact," said DeCicco. 
According to DeCicco, if Wayne State has a soft spot it is in its sabre squad. In the sabre, Giovanni Girotto (a fourth place finisher in the 1984 NCAA finals) is joined also by two newcomers -Neil Kessler and James Klemic. Bela Kogler who finished fifth in the NCAA's last year, weakened the squad after he trans­ferred during the summer. 
In the foil, Wayne State is strong with returning French fencer Step­han Chauvel. Chauvel, who finished fourth in last year's NCAA foil finals, is joined by Peter Dinsdale and Avore Goldstein. Dinsdale was crowned as the Australian National Foil Champion in 1984. 
"Their foil team is their best team overall right now, their epee team is right behind, and their sabre team is going to be good with Girotto," said DeCicco. "It's going to be a tough one, but we've got some fencers, too. What we have to do is get back into the meet-situation attitude again." 
According to DeCicco, all of his fencers are healthy and prepared to fence. Junior foil captain Mike Van der Velden is back in relatively good form and strength after suffering from an early-season injury. Junior foilist Craig Funai ( 34-24 lifetime) is back from studying in Rome last year, and has surprised DeCicco of late after a 5-4 1985 start. 
"Craig Funai is fencing up a storm and he may be our starter against Wayne State (in the foil) in place of Dave Reuter (5-7)," said DeCicco. 
Other than Van der Velden ( 1 0-4) and Funai in the foil, the Irish will most likely fence 1984 foil cham­pion Charles Higg-Coulthard. At 13­1, Higgs-Coulthard is currently leading all Notre Dame fencers. 
In the epee, senior captain Andy Quaroni ( 1 1'1 ), junior Christian Scherpe (9-2), and junior Mike Gos­tigian ( 8-1 ) will be the likely trio to start. 
In the sabre, senior capatain Mike Janis ( 9-1 ) and junior Don Johnson ( 9-3) will be two of the likely starters on what DeCicco calls "the best sabre squad in the country." Juniors John Edwards (6-3) and Tony Consoli ( 6-6) will vie for the third spot. 
"Last year, their epee team with Ettore Bianchi beat our epee squad 7-2," said DeCicco. "I ·don't see that happening again, and if we could turn that result around and win that weapon, we could be as competitive as we were last year and beat Wayne State. 
"My predicted store is about a 15­12 Notre Dame win. But it would mean that the sabre team is going to do a lion's share ofthe work because in the foil and epee, the bouts are going to be a little bit tougher to

Constable changes technique, sets all-time high jump record 

By NICK SCHRANTZ 
.\ports Writer 
Increased confidence and a con­sistent jumping technique have en­abled lloyd Constable to establish himselfas the leading hi~ jumper in Notre Dame history, and only the third Irish performer in 14 years to qualify for the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships. 
The senior high jumper achieved this feat last weekend by jumping seven feet, three and one-halfinches in a dual meet against DePaul. Con­stable's leap set a new ACC and all­time Notre Dame record. 
Qualifying for the NCAA's, the goal of Constable and most track performers, will hdp Constable the rest of the year. 
"It takes most people most of the season to reach their goal, and so doing it early takes a load off my shoulders," Constable said. "I had technical problems until now, but now I'm more confident that I can go 7-3 and higher." 
The DePaul meet continued an outstanding season for Constable. He cleared 6-I 0 to win the high jump at the Western Michigan Open on January 1 I. One week later he lept 7-2 to capture the event in a home meet against Iowa. In the Iowa meet he cleared 6-8 and 6-10 to win the event, and then went on to jump 7-0 and 7-2, which was the previous ACC and Notre Dame record. At the DePaul meet, Constable also cleared 6-8 and 7-0. and just missed at 7-'5.

lbe post-John Wooden years have been less than the greatest for the Los Angeles school.

'Ibe pressure to win at UCLA is un­believable. Bruin fans have been spoiled by all the winning of the past, similar to the situation here at Notre Dame with football.

season can be a must-win game, but 
Notre Dame, at 11-'5, could really 
use this one. 
"We need a big road win," Phelps 
says. "We've got some chances com­

· 
Constable dearly ranks as the all­time Irish high jumper, both indoors and outdoors. He lept 7-2 in 1982 in an outdoor meet, which is four inches better than the number two man on the all-time list. During in­door meets he has jumped 7-0 three times, 7-2 twice, and his record height -all of which far surpass the next best height of6-I 0. 
Constable entered Notre Dame with impressive credentials and had a fine freshman year. However, he slumped in his sophomore year and was academically ineligible for his junior year. The North Babylon, New York native gives several reasons for his comeback and suc­cess this season. 
"I haven't had any really good years until this year. I was frustrated, and I knew I could do better," Con­stable explained. "This year I have more confidence and I feel more comfortable with my technique. Feeling good about myself really helps, and not letting things bother me helps my concentration. I'm calm and under control, so there's less pressure and I can just think about jumping." 
Despite his fine high school career, Constable had to adapt to a new jumping technique when he en­tered Notre Dame. He credits the new technique for causing some of his problems earlier. 

how I finished over the bar, the steps in my approach, and really my whole style of jumping. It took me three years to get used to it, but this season I feel comfortable with it." 
Constable waits almost two minutes before he jumps, while the crowd waits quietly. The silence helps him concentrate and gives him confidence. 
"When you have a lot of people watching you, you really want to do your best," he said. "Its a real confi­dence booster to see everyone in 

Lloyd Constable 

the stands waiting for you and wan­ting you to do well." 
During this wait, Constable prepares himself for what he has to do to clear the height. 
"I first think about what I did wrong the last jump," he explained. "I think about the last three steps of 
Constable began his track career in seventh grade, where he ran, long jumped, and threw the shot put. He switched to the high jump in eigth grade because he felt the other kids were too fast for him. 
He jumped 6-6 during his sopho­more year at North Babylon High School, which was four inches bet­ter than his previous personal best. He continued his improvement by leaping 6-10 in his junior year. He capped off his senior year and a suc­cessful high school career with a jump ofseven feet, one-quarter inch to win the New York state champi­onship. 
Despite his fine high school career, Constable was not highly recruited. He played basketball during high school, which forced him to miss the indoor track season and only compete in the outdoor season in the spring. However, col­lege recruiters usually start recruit­ing during the winter and he was passed up. 
"Before Notre Dame, only C.W. Post and Syracuse asked me to visit," he said. "It was a freak thing because we had an outdoor meet moved in­doors because of the snow, and I jumped 7-0 in flats. Someone from Lorig Island sent the article in the paper to Notre Dame, and then the coaches called me. I came out for a visit and decided to come here." 
Constable will graduate this spring with a degree in communica­tions, concentrating in film and video productions. The degree has not come easily for him, and even forced him to miss his junior year in track due to academic difficulties. 
"I really struggled in school, and made a few mistakes In studying," he admitted. "But in the long run, I earned my degree and came out ahead. I feel I've matured here at Notre Dame." 
After graduation Constable plans to return to New York and interview for a job. His high jumping career will likely end this year, unless he can find a sponsor to get him the neccessary facilities, equipment, and coaching. 
During grade school Constable watched the world class high jumpers like Dwight Stones, and felt that someday he could jump as high as. them. He set a goal of one day jumping 7-6. With his continued im­provement, consistent technique, and new found confidence Lloyd Constabalc should reach his goal and set Notre Dame high jumping standards higher than he already has. 


"I had an eight step approach my approach, then exploding off the when I got here, which was a bad ground, and finally clearing the bar. I way to jump," he said. "Coach Kelly repeat this until I feel prepared to (an Irish assistant coach) changed jump."

Irish ·set to defend MCC Track title 
ByJOHN COYLE 
Sports Writer 
The action promises to be fust and furious under the North Dome of the A.C. C. Notre Dame, who will be defending the title it has won the past two years, hosts the Midwestern City Conference Track Championship tomorrow afternoon bcginnign at 1:30 p.m. 
The Irish. however, will face some strong competition from Oral Roberts and Butler. The two teams have finished second and third, respectively, in this meet the past two years and both have several fine middle and long dis­tance runners. 
Leading the way for Oral Roberts will be Kim Berghal, a native of Finland, and Kenyan­born joe Bungei. Scott Harper, who qualified for the NCAA championship, will also be tough. 
The size of the Butler team lends credence to the old saying, "there's strength in numbers." The Bulldogs has over 25 mem· hers and is always a threat. Loyola also has two solid runners in Gary Donzelli and Steve Doran. 
Despite the quality of the op­posing runners, Irish head coach, Joe Piane is confident that his team will be successful again this year. "If they compete and do as well as they can, we should be victorious," says Plane. 
The main reason for Piane 's op­timism is his talented sprinter contigent. Junior Mitch Van Eyken will be looking to repeat his winning perform01nce of last year in the 300-and 440-yard dashes. Dan Shannon, a senior, will try to top his winning time of last year in the 600. Other ous­

UCLA looks to extend streak over struggling Notre Dame 
ByJEFF BLUMB 

AssistantSports Eattor 
LOS ANGELES -Ifthe Notre Dame basketball team should beat UCLA on Sunday in Pauley Pavilion, excuse the players for their unfamiliarity with the situation, for no Irish player has ever played on a team which has beaten the Bruins. Notre Dame is 0-7 in the last seven games with the L.A. school and will be looking to end UCLA's recent domination in front of a national television audience on NBC-TV beginning at 3 p.m. EST. 

The Bruins struggled out of the gate this year under first-year head coach Walt Hazzard. They were blown out on the road early this season, first at DePaul and Memphis St. and later against St. John's in New York City. Since a 3-6 start, though, UCLA has rebounded to win six ofits last seven games and now stands at 6-2 in the Pac 1 0 and 9-7 overall with a dare at USC scheduled for to­morrow. 
"This UCLA team is very good and very talented," says Irish coach Dig· ger Phelps. "They have some fine athletes. Early in the season, it was just a case ofsitting into a new situa­tion. 
"Now they're playing some excel­lent basketball. They've just won three big games over Washington, Stanford, and California, and are going to be in the thick of the Pac 1 0 race by the end of the season." 
While this UCLA team may not resemble past UCLA teams in terms ofthe number ofwins and losses, the resemblence to the past is clearly there. The aura of John Wooden remains with UCLA Basketball under the coaching of Hazzard, a former player of "The Wizard of Westwood." 
"The system's pretty much as it used to be. I don't think Hazzard's changed it that much," Phelps says. "He's added just a few wrinkles but it's 90 percent Wooden. 
"It's definitely the Wooden sys­tem. We'll see a zone press and then they'll drop back into a man-to-man. We won't see any zone defense at all. Offensively, it's the same otfenses that were there during Wooden's last four or five years there." 
About all that has changed is the personnel. The Bruins have some fine players left from last year's team that beat the Irish, 51-4 7, at the ACC. Sophomore forward Reggie Miller, perhaps better known as the younger brother of Cheryl Miller, star of the USC women's team, leads Seniors Brad Wright and Gary the UCLA team in scoring and assists.

Women try for home win against Evansville 

By LARRY BURKE 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's basket­ball team will play its first home game in 18 days tonight, and the Irish hope to make it a happy homecoming as they take on North Star Conference rival Evansville at 7 
p.m. in the ACC. 
Tonight's game features the first of several promotional Domino's pizza-eating contests at halftime, but it is Mary DiStanislao's squad that could be in for a real feast. The Lady Aces are just 3-12 this season, and while they have shown some im­provement oflate, they will need an extraordinary effort to overcome an inspired Irish team that is coming off a 79-40 thrashing of Butler W ednes­day night. 
The Irish last played at home on Jan. 14, when they scored a convinc­ing 70-49 win over Illinois-Chicago. Before that, Notre Dame's last home game was a 71-59 victory over Mic­higan State. The Irish are 4-1 at home this season, but only five of their 16 games, and just one oftheir last eight contests, have been played at the ACC. 
The Lady Aces are coming off a 4­22 mark last season but figure to im­prove on that record this season. They have had their best success in North Star contests, where they are 2-1 so far. Evansville has beaten Xavier and Butler this season in NSC games, and flirted with a big upset before falling to Dayton, 63-60. 
Guards Barb Dykstra and Shelly Brand-Adlard are the two dominant players for the Lady Aces. Dykstra, a 5-7 junior, stands eighth in the con­
terence in scoring with a 14.4 
average, and Brand-Adlard, a 5-6 
senior, is ninth at 14.3 points per 
game. Dykstra joined Brand·Adlard 
in the 1,000-point club when she 
broke the mark against Dayton last 
Saturday. Brand-Adlard is also 
second in the league at 6.3 assists 
per game. 
The Lady Aces also have 6-0 Sue 
Rathmacher at center, a freshman 
who is fifth In the conference in 
rebounding at 6.7 boards per game, 
and 5·11 Karla Hughes, who is sixth 
in rebounding at 6.5 per game. At 
the other forward spot is 5-8 senior 
Denise Spear, who averages 10.4 
points per game and has hit 62 per· 
cent of her shots from the field in 
conference games. 
Despite these respectable individ­ual stats among the starters, the Lady Aces have not been very successful · as a team. They rank last in the con· ference in field shooting ( 38 per­cenc), seventh (out of eight teams) in free· throw shooting (64 percent), seventh in scoring (60 points per game), seventh in team defense ( 73 points allowed per game), and seventh in team rebounding differ­
ential ( -11.3 ). 
"Obviously, Evansville has their 
liabilities," says DiStanislao. "What 
we have to do in order to beat them 
is exploit those liabilities. I know 
that Evansville will come in here 
very fired up Friday night. 
"It's very easy to take them lightly, 
which is what I think Dayton did last 
Saturday. Evansville was on their 
own court and they caught Dayton 
by surprise and gave them a good 
ball game. Dayton wasn't ready, but 
we'll be ready. I fully expect 
Evansville to give us a good game." 


Streak-ending upset of 1974 sets tone for classic series 
LOS ANGELES -It hangs there like the aftertaste ofdiet cola. Long and lasting. 
But one win of 1209 in the history ofbasketball at Notre Dame and but one loss of492 in the history ofbasketball at UCLA. Yet, the memory ofthat Notre Dame-UCLA battle on Jan. 19, 1974, still reverberates today as one ofcollege bas· ketball's classic rivalries continues Sunday in Pauley Pavilion. 
In many people's minds, Notre Dame's 71-70 upset of the Bruins in 1974 at the ACC · thus ending college basket­ball's long~t winning streak at 88 games-marked the start­ing point of modern-day Notre Dame Basketball. When he had come to South Bend two seasons earlier for the 1971­72 season, Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps first set his sights on reaching the level of the legendary UCLA pro­gram. Notre Dame's stunning victory gave its program the credibility it had previously lacked, and which it still holds today. 
National champions the last seven seasons and nine of the previous J0, UCLA Basketball was at its pinnacle that fateful January day when the upstarts from Notre Dame rallied to outscore the Bruins 12-0 over the game's final 
3:22 for a win that shocked the entire nation. UCLA was to college basketball what the New York Yankees were to baseball or what Notre Dame was to college football. The

Irish had come away with the ultimate triumph, and its effect.<; on Notre Dame Basketball would be felt years into the future. 
The game still lives on in the memory of Irish assistant coach Gary Brokaw, who was the game's leading scorer with 25 points. "It was the most important game that I have ever played in as a basketball player," he says. "That covers over 25 years, including four years of professional ball. "People remember me because I played in that game, not because I played in Milwaukee with Kareem Abdui·Jabbar arui Oscar Robert..o;on. They remember me because ofwhat Notre Dame did to UCLA on January 19, 1974. It's a game that people remember 10 years later, and I'm sure they'll still remember it 10 years down the road. I'll never forget them telling us it was a Notre Dame moment." 
Phelps has repeated the phrase 'Notre Dame moment' many times since, but it was that one game which made possible all those to follow. The series has lost some of the luster it once enjoyed, although Sunday's game still will be telecast to a national television audience on NBC. It un­doubtedly will be a special game Sunday, but there are a couple of reasons why this one isn't likely to match previ· ous Irish-Bruin battles. 
Beginning last year, the series reverted to one game a season. It had been a home-and·home series since Phelps became Irish head coach but that arrangement ended by UCLA's choice. Arizona and Arizona State joined the Bruins' conference, the Pac 10, in time for the '78-'79 season, forcing UCLA to play four additional conference games per year. The Bruins have felt the pinch of playing four more tough games, and decided that it would not be in their best interest to play Notre Dame twice a year. 
Because the teams only visit each other in alternate years, a good deal of fan involvement with the series has dissipated, taking away from the excitement that comes with a UCLA game. The Bruins, obviously, aren't what they once were in college basketball. Parity has overriden domination in the last few years, so UCLA finds itself unable to do what it once did so easily -win national champion­ship after national championship.
