Task force examines SYRs 
By THERESA ALEMAN 
News Writer 

Students view all-hall semi­formals (SYRs) as a suitable means of social interaction on campus, according to the findings of the SYR task force created by the Hall President's Council (HPC). 
The task force was designed by the HPC in an effort to improve dance restrictions after the cancellation of three dorm SYRs in the 1992 fall semester. The dances were cancelled due to failure to meet the 70 percent dorm mm1mum attendance requirement specified by DuLac. 
The group consisted of seven Notre Dame students of various backgrounds who re­ported their findings to the Campus Life Council (CLC) after almost a month of visiting halls and various dances. 
Meeting for the first time in late January and making final recommendations in early February, the group

Kirk: Controversial new policy to solve moving problems 
By JOHN LUCAS 
Assistant News Editor 
Despite student concerns, the revised moving-out process should actually alleviate headaches instead of causing them, according to Bill Kirk, assistant vice president for Res­idence Life. 
In the past, room inspections were handled individually by each hall, and Residence Assis­tants (R.A.s) examined rooms and assessed fines for damage, according to Kirk. 
Since there were so many problems and complaints from students and parents, the Uni­versity decided on a new in­spection plan which involved the use of University inspectors from the Facilities Operations Department, Kirk said. 

"The R.A.s used to determine reasonable damage and room charges. What we have now is a more consistent policy to cut down complaints," he said. 
The new policy requires stu­dents to have their rooms ready for inspection by 10 p.m. on April 25. Inspector will begin examining rooms and assessing fines during the upcoming study days on April 29 and 30. 
Although the new inspections are meant to help students, many students feel that the deadline to have rooms disas­sembled comes at a bad time, according to Mike Gaunt, an 
R.A. at St. Edward's Hall. 
"People have complained... 
they don't understand why the 
inspections had to happen this 
weekend. It's a bad combina­
tion of inspections, room picks .and finals coming up," he said. 
Sister Annette George, rec­
tress of Lewis Hall, agreed, ex­
plaining that many students 
have complained of the incon­
venience of having the inspec­
tions before. 
"Some students are afraid the 
new policy will disrupt their 
rooms before they would like to, 
but I think once it is over, 
students will be relieved and 
grateful," she said. 
While many students feel that they are required to have their rooms disassembled a week early, the date for room in­spections is the same as last year, according to Kirk. Since last year's inspections were made at a hall level, most oc­curred during Senior Week, when most students were not around, he said. 
According to Lyons sopho­more Meg Garzelloni, the same 
R.A.s who made the initial in­spections in the fall should also inspect in the spring. "Outside inspectors don't know the situation in each dorm. The same people should be inspecting rooms from the beginning to end," she said. 
The inspectors will be un­derstanding and receptive to 
explanation of the room dam­age students are not responsi­ble for, according to Kirk. 
"The inspectors will be very reasonable as far as explana­tions of damage go. Obviously they don't want to charge stu­dents if the damage is not their fault," he said. 
Seniors and other students who will be staying at Notre Dame after finals can re­assemble their rooms after in­spections, according to Kirk. "Seniors can bring their rooms back to a comfortable level. It doesn't have to look like a bare cell," he said.

Long history precedes battles for gay, lesbian recognition 
Editor's Note: The following is the third of a three-part series examining the place of gays and lesbians on the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's Campuses. 
By JASON WILLIAMS 
Assistant News Editor 
Despite being the unrecog­nized minority, homosexual students at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's have had a long history of existence on campus. 
The administration continues to deny recognition of gay and lesbian groups due to the con­flict with their "Catholic charac­ter and teachings of the Uni­versity." But other national, Catholic universities including Georgetown University and Catholic University have homo­sexual organizations on cam­pus. 
"Notre Dame sees itself as be­ing absolutely unique," said Michael Yore, former co­

THE UNRECOGNIZED MINORITY 

chairman of Gays and Lesbians of Notre Dame/Saint Mary's (GLNDSMC). "They will never give up that conservative Catholic identity-they see that as the one way they define themselves." 
Although the most recent controversy surrounding gays and lesbians has been their re­quests to form student groups, simply sparking dialogue about homosexual issues used to be a major achievement in the 1960s. 
The earliest discussion of gays occurred in two articles from 1961 issues of Scholastic. The administration refused to even verify the existence of gays on campus until groups began to organize unofficially. 
"One of Hesburgh's famous quotes ... was that there was no homosexual students at Notre Dame until 1968," said Chuck Colbert, a 1978 graduate and member of the board of direc­tors for the alumni club of Boston. "That claim is abso­lutely ridiculous. We've got alumni in our data base to prove gays existed on campus long before then." 
Gay and lesbian groups first began appearing on campus around 1972, Colbert said. He said he attended his first Gay Community at Notre Dame meeting when he was a sophomore. 
"It was a very, very under­ground, quiet sort of thing," he said. "In those days-especially as an undergrad-it was not heard of to be out and open about it." 
The Gay Community at Notre Dame was not exclusive to Notre Dame students. They shared concerns with groups of people from both South Bend and Saint Mary's. 
The Gay Community dissolved during the early 1980s, but independent "cells" of ho­mosexual students continued to thrive on campus, according to Yore. 
The spring of 1984 saw the emergence of Gay Students of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's (GSND-SMC), the predecessor to GLND/SMC which was estab­lished in 1985. One of their main concerns dealt with establishing a hotline to serve as an avenue of communication between the group and stu­dents. 
One of the most historic events which involved gay stu­dents on campus dealt with a conflict between the adminis­tration and the WSND-FM campus radio station in 1986.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Living off-campus: the ultimate housing solution 
Notre Dame, perhaps 
more than any other 
school in the nation, is 
surrounded and defined 
by tradition. 
The legacy of football, 
single-sex dorms, 
parietals, the Golden 
Dome, the over-priced 
bookstore "on the 
campus," that wacky An News Copy Editor 
Tostal-all of these are 
deeply rooted in Notre Dame tradition. There is 
another ND tradition, however, that I don't 
understand. Why do so many choose to live on 
campus all four years? Too few students explore 
the opportunities for off-campus living. 
Last year, when the time for room picks and such came around, I chose to become one of a very small number of off-campus juniors. I'm not some kind of outcast, and I didn't necessarily have a serious gripe with the university. I just thought I might like off-campus living more than on-campus living. And as it turned out, I was right. 
When I decided to move off-campus, I wondered if it would be a bad decision, because ·uniors normally remain on campus. But as I settled in early this year. I questioned more and more why a larger number of people don't move off. I still wonder, because I have never regretted moving out of the dorm. Some may say that it's bad for the GPA, thinking that an off-campus student misses classes more than an on-campus student.That couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, my first semester off­campus was my best semester so far. 
Living off-campus forces you to take responsibilities that you wouldn't have on campus (but certainly not too much for a 20­year old to handle), and as I became more responsible my classwork improved. So, if you are considering moving off-campus, you shouldn't be afraid that your classwork will suffer. It's in your hands. 
Living off-campus allows you, even forces you, to create your own schedule. In other words, the day is not structured around when the dining hall is open. For example, last night I went to the Library at 4:00 p.m. to begin working on a paper, and I didn't have to take a dinner break. After I was finished, I went home and fixed my own dinner. I can have dinner any time I want. 
There are other bonuses to off-campus living. For one, there isn't a dorm room on campus as big as my apartment. That means plenty o room to spread out. It's quiet enough to have privacy, yet I live around students and live close enough to campus that I feel just as much a part of the university as I ever did. 
Another bonus to off-campus living is the cost. Outside of a dorm, it's much easier to stretch your academic dollar. If you look, you can find some real bargains. Plus. it's nice just knowing that your money is going somewhere other than the University of Notre Dame. A common misconception is that off-campus living is more expensive; but I have saved money this year. Living off-campus allows me to control where my money (especially my food money) is going. Off-campus living has been very good to me, and it can be very good to you.

Mathematicians converge on SMC Chalmers: New models 


By NICOLE MCGRATH Saint Mary's News Editor 
The last time the Mathemati­cal Association of America met, the United States was heavily immersed in World War II. 
Over 50 years later, the as­sociation's first tri-section meeting will be hosting more than 400 mathematicians at Saint Mary's college this week­end, according Donald Miller, local arrangements coordinator and math department chair at Saint Mary's. 
On the conference's agenda are many of the same concerns addressed at the 1943 confer­ence. Those include pedagogi­cal concerns in teaching calcu­lus and the incorporation of ap­plications into the undergrad­uate curriculum.

TO ORDER 
needed for Latin politics 
By CHRIS HANIFIN News Writer 
The end of the Cold War, a communications revolution, and the changing role of the state in Latin America necessi­tate a new view of international politics, according to David Chalmers, director of the Insti­tute of Latin American and Iberian Studies at Columbia University. 
"I find it increasingly desir­able to make a conceptual shift on the way we view the role of foreigners in Latin America," Chalmers said. "We need to shift from conventional models of politics to what I like to call an international model." 
"It is clearly not true that in­ternational actors are new-one can look all the way back to the conquests. What changed was the patterning of the interna­tional actors," he added. 
Chalmers characterized the 
conventional model of politics 
as the belief that most foreign 
influence travels through 
diplomatic channels or military 
intervention. 
"Outsiders are active in Latin America, treated in one of two ways-as elements of dependency theory [on the U.S.] or as intervening militarily. It seems that foreign countries have been setting conditions which these countries must meet," Chalmers said. 
Chalmers said that a more accurate picture can be con­structed as one sees the variety of internationally based actors who influence governments. Chalmers defined these actors as being as varied as multi-na­tional corporations and human rights organizations. 
"An international actor is any entity playing an ongoing, long­term role in the region while maintaining an international base of resources and identities," he said. "My rule of thumb is to include any actor with a stake in the decisions made by a government," Chalmers added. 
"The simple thing I am sug­gesting is that any interna­tionally based actor will play a role in the region," Chalmers said.· 
Some nations might be dis­pleased with the apparent loss of independence that increased international cooperation brings about. 
"Sovereignty is a very tangled issue in these cases. For example, people speak of human rights organizations as limiting sovereignty by bringing pressure to bear on governments. What in fact took place was the creation of a series of important groups within each country who then drew on international support," said Chalmers. 
"This is not the imposition of 
an international regime," 
Chalmers emphasized. 
"We must consider roles not 
in terms of a direct impact and 
effect, but instead consider the 
institutional dimension," said 
Chalmers. 
As an example he cited the 
changing role of the United 
States in Latin America. The 
U.S. once had a proconsular role, determining who would be established in government.

History 
continued from page 1 
The administration pulled the 
plug when WSND started run­
ning gay and lesbian public 
service announcements. Eileen 
Ridley, the station manager, and 
most of her staff resigned when 
the University refused to let the 
station run the announcements. 
"I rnalized that because of the 
principles involved I had to 
stand against the Administra­
tion's decision," she said in a 
1986 interview. "I resigned with 
the intention of fighting for the 
public's right." 
GLND/SMC was the first ho­mosexual group to apply for recognition to the University. They were denied office space and a telephone by the admin­istration on July 7, 1986. Saint Mary's rejected GLND/SMCs proposal for recognition on Oct. 6, 1986. GLND/SMC was most recently denied recognition as a student group in May of 1992. 
Student Senate also denied GLND/SMC the right to reserve campus rooms for meetings and communication through University media. Student Af­fairs denied any homosexual group from publishing adver­tisements in The Observer in the spring of 1991. 
On Saint Patrick's Day 1990, Mike Miller, former co-chair of GLND/SMC, helped establish Gay and Lesbian Alumni of Notre Dame (GALA-ND). Statis­tics show that many alumni have become more open with their sexual preferences since this group's establishment. There is currently over 130 alumni on GALA's mailing list. 
Another substantial event in the history of gays at Notre Dame came with the resigna­tion of Father James Burtchaell in the fall of 1991. He was dismissed from the University for having homosexual rela­tionships with students. 
"Many gays on campus were 
The Observer Friday, April 23, 1993 
real angry, but at the same time many were real sad," Vore said. "Like it or not, Burtchaell is gay. Seeing somebody you understand go through something like that was a terrible thing." 
Most recently, a book pub­lished last week verified suspi­cions that Tom Dooley, a 1948 graduate and humanitarian, was a homosexual. Vore said he believed the University knew about this long before the recent publication. 
"Dooley was a national hero, and there is no question that he was gay," he said. 
On Sunday, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's faculty, students and alumni will take part in the largest civil rights demonstra­tion in America's history. The March on Washington for Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Rights is expected to attract over one million participants. 
"We're going to be there car­rying our 'Gay and Lesbian Fighting Irish' banner and wearing our Notre Dame clothes," Colbert said. "The real story is that we've survived for over 30 years at Notre Dame despite all the heavy restric­tions and the Administration trying to enforce invisibility. When will they realize that we're real and that we're here to stay?"

rooms after the inspections may not be that great a help for many seniors who will sell their furniture and carpeting, ac­cording to Gaunt. 
"How many seniors keep their carpeting? Most sell it and it goes into hall storage along with their furniture, until next year," Gaunt said. 
The changes have been made to benefit students and are not meant to inconvenience them, Kirk said. "The perception is that we're just doing this to be difficult, but actually it (the pol­icy) should eliminate some of the complaints we've had from students and parents." 
Kirk said he hoped that dorms and R.A.s would have been able to clear up any confusion that resulted from the new policy, which was sent to each student. 
"We tried to make it (the pol­icy) clear, and our hope was with the letter we sent out, we could set the ground rules," he said. "A meeting with rectors looked like a good idea, but un­derstandably, it's difficult to get all the rectors together at this time of year." 


SYRs

and attended the gatherings to witness interaction. 
They reported that five major issues needed to be addressed including the purpose of SYRs, alcohol consumption, food, 24-hour space and some miscella­neous items. 
The committee concluded that SYRs serve to provide students with "an opportunity to date and to learn how to relate with members of the opposite sex." 
The group also included in its report one student's statement that "an SYR is the sole event on campus that promotes dating, dorm unity, spirit, and overall social interaction." 
Hevised recommendations of the committee included lowering the mm1mum attendance to 60 percent dorm participation and changing the number of days needed to process an SYR request from one week to three days. 
The committee also proposed that the Office of Student Affairs and the halls sponsor a non-alcoholic semi­formal for freshmen during orientation week. 
The CLC will review the task force's proposals and decide whether or not to amend campus policies this summer when revising DuLac.

SMC women celebrate leadership successes 
By CHRISTINA CANNON 
News Writer 
"Celebrating a Leadership Community," a conference that will highlight the achievements of Saint Mary's students, hopes to get people thinking about women in leadership roles, said Marlene Johnson, leadership development committee chairperson. 
The event, which is to be held April 25 and 26, will include a series of programs that, "explore the ways in which Saint Mary's fosters leadership and the ways in which we are a leadership community," said Johnson. 
Although Saint Mary's has had programs similar in nature, this is the first to recognize the whole Saint Mary's community. The main difference this year is that "in the year's past we had a student appreciation day," said Johnson. 
"We decided to build on the aspect of leadership and bring in all aspects-the student body, student government, and classroom leaders this year." 
On Sunday there will be a workshop in which students will be given the opportunity to work with recent alumnae and graduating seniors to "shape plans for individual growth and change," said Johnson. 
The following day a wider range of activities have been planned, including a display of past and present Saint Mary's leaders in the Cushwa-Leighton library. A luncheon giving stu­dents an opportunity to talk and eat with faculty and administration will also be a part of the day's activities. 
The luncheon will feature Maggie Berlin, a law student at Washington and Lee University and a 1991 Saint Mary's graduate.

(AP)-Earth Day was cele­brated around the world on Thursday, but not everyone was optimistic about the planet's future. 
India's environment minister said that despite the endorse­ment of an environmental agenda by world leaders in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, last year, the emission of gases that con­tribute to global warming con­tinues to rise. 
"Emissions are going up while the availability of funds to the developing countries are going down," Kamal Nath said in New Delhi, the United News of India reported. 
In Washington, researchers released a report that shows the protective ozone layer dropped to record-low concen­trations last year, with the biggest decline seen over areas that include North America, Europe and parts of Asia. 
J. F. Gleason, a scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said measurements last December and January by a NASA satellite showed that the ozone layer surrounding the Earth was thinner than in any previous measurements. 
Richard Stolarski, another

scientist at Goddard, said ul­traviolet radiation not filtered out by the ozone layer "is en­ergetic enough to break the bonds of DNA," a measure of the potential for causing genetic change. 
In many international cities, celebrations of Earth Day were nowhere to be seen or weren't going to be held until the weekend. 
Still, the creator of Earth Day has watched his cause grow considerably from a small envi­ronmental fringe movement. 
"The environment has moved into the establishment," said Gaylord Nelson, the 76-year-old former Wisconsin senator who persuaded his colleagues in Congress back in 1970 to create a day honoring Mother Earth. "Every year there's more interest than there was the year before." 
In Pullman. Wash., members of the Washington State University zoology club cele­

brated by buying 2 acres in a South American rain forest for dlrs 80. 
In Missoula, Mont., a group opposed to nuclear weapons testing planned to read ac­counts of 950 nuclear explo­sions. 
"We'd like people to leave with a greater awareness of how little we know, and how much has been hidden from us," said Deborah Bond, a spokeswoman for the group. 
On Grand Cayman in the Caribbean, volunteer groups cleaned the resort beaches and children planted mahogany trees, which are native to the island and have been depleted by development. 
And in Paris, a 46-foot inflat­able blue whale was displayed on the Champs de Mars, in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, by the environmental group Greenpeace. Members said they hoped to pressure the In­ternational Whaling Commis­sion to ban whaling when it meets next month, in Kyoto, Japan. 
About 100 high school stu­dents participated in a "green march" in Warsaw, Poland, carrying green and white ban­
ners and strings of trash to call
attention to pollution. 
The chairman of the Russian parliamentary environmental committee, Vladimir Vor­
folomeev, issued an Earth Day appeal to citizens.

UVA faculty to consider relations ban 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -University of Virginia faculty members on Thursday endorsed a compromise pro­posal that bans sexual relations between instructors and the students they teach. 
The Faculty Senate voted 31-4 for the ban instead of a strict prohibition against all sex be­tween students and faculty that a Women's Concerns Committee had advocated. 
Supporters said the strict pol­icy would curb sexual intimida­tion of students, but opponents decry it as an unconstitutional limit on love. 
Women's committee members said they were satisfied with the compromise. 
"We just weren't going to win," said third-year student Angela Kline. "We wanted something to protect the stu­dents." 
The faculty vote will be sent to university President John Casteen Ill. who will make a recommendation to the board of visitors. The board sets pol­icy at the 18,000-student school Thomas Jefferson founded in 1819. 
"We've gone to a lot of trouble and I'm certain that he'll pay a great deal of heed to our advice," said Robert Kretsinger, president of the 98­member Senate. which repre­sents the school's 2,000 faculty members. It wasn't immediately clear why only 35 Faculty Senate members voted. 
The proposal offered by the women's committee would have banned all sexual or amorous relations between un­dergraduate students and fac­ulty. It also would have barred similar activity between profes­sors and graduate students in the same department, teaching assistants and their students, and financial officers.

Hunt's chief defense attorney, George Beck, said no appeal would be filed before the May 7 proceeding. 
Hunt would be restored to office if the verdict is over­turned on appeal by January 1995, the scheduled end of his term. 
"Whether the governor vio­lated the law to such an extent that he deserves the peniten­tiary, it's up to the judge," said Attorney General Jimmy Evans, the chief prosecutor. "Is the defendant remorseful or is the defendant arrogant?" 
Hunt's conviction automati­cally elevated the 43-year-old Folsom to the governor's office that his father, the late Gov. James "Big Jim" Folsom, held for two terms in the 1940s and 1950s. 
On leaving the courthouse after becoming Alabama's first governor ousted for conviction of a felony, Hunt said he would go to the Governor's Mansion to pray with family and friends.

FBI sifts through Waco rubble Clinton strives to regain 
WACO, Texas (AP) -Inves­the 51-day standoff. tigators began removing bodies "I am not sure where they from the burned rubble of the_ received that information," 
Branch Davidian compound Thursday and the top medical examiner disputed federal assertions that some victims had been shot. Authorities said 46 bodies had been found. 
"We heard rumors ... that there were several people who might have shot themselves or who had been shot," said Dr. Nizam Peerwani, who heads the Tarrant County medical ex­aminer's office in Fort Worth. "There is absolutely no evi­dence of that as far as we are concerned at this stage." 
Carl Stern of the Justice De­partment in Washington said Wednesday at least three bodies suffered gunshots. That raised speculation that cult members may have committed suicide or been shot by other cultists before Monday's fire that ended Peerwani said. 

Stern on Thursday defended his statement, saying that Peerwani's medical team has just started its investigation. 
Cult leader David Koresh and 85 followers are believed to have died in the fire that broke out as the FBI attempted to force a surrender by using ar­mored vehicles to punch holes and pump tear gas inside their compound. Nine survived, six of whom claim the FBI started the blaze. 
The FBI says Koresh com­manded a fiery mass suicide. 
Peerwani said 46 bodies, many of them "soft and crumbling" have been found, including some children. But, he said, none have been identi­fied.

Peerwani said many of the children killed in the blaze ­there were believed to be 17 children 10 years old and younger -may never be found because the blaze may have "literally incinerated their bod­ies." 
The 46 bodies will likely be transported to Fort Worth and autopsied Friday, Peerwani said. 
Dr. Rodney Crow, a forensic dentist who's assisting in the case, said dental records may be the only way to identify the victims. 
"There are no faces on some of them and the faces are just completely powder," Crow said. "Hopefully, the teeth, taking a much higher temperature to destruct, will be in this debris. But as it stands now, I have seen several that the facial features are completely gone." 
Crow said identification could take months because many of the dental records will have to be obtained from places as far away as Australia, England and the Caribbean. Many of the cultists were foreigners. 
Crow said at least nine bodies have been located in a bunker containing "millions of rounds of ammunition."

Other White House aides said 

WASHINGTON (AP) -The White House, still reeling from its jobs-bill defeat, searched Thursday for initiatives on which to score a clear-cut victory before getting enmeshed in other looming disputes over campaign finance reform and national health insurance. 
One candidate: Clinton's proposal to restructure the college loan program to allow students to pay off their loans through national service. 
Clinton announced that he'd send the measure -a key campaign promise -to Congress next week. While not without controversy, the program at least is relatively straightforward and holds out the possibility of attracting bipartisan support. 
Meanwhile, the administration worked -without much optimism -with Democratic leaders on ways to salvage parts of Clinton's decimated jobs-stimulus package. 
"There are a number of options," White House communications director George Stephanopoulos said. 
"The president wants to move forward on summer jobs, he wants to move forward on investments in highways and mass transit, and he wants to that a supplemental appropriations bill might be introduced in the House next week that would include spending for these jettisoned programs. 
The mood at the White House was clearly dark a day after Clinton was handed his first major legislative defeat as Democratic leaders failed for the fourth time in a month to break a Republican filibuster on Clinton's $16.3 billion jobs­stimulus package. 
The White House and the Democratic leadership then abandoned the proposal and approved instead a $4 billion program to provide jobless benefits for unemployed workers who have exhausted their benefits -the only part of the package that wasn't resisted by the GOP. 
Other parts of Clinton's overall economic plan also appeared to be unravelling. 
White House officials reluctantly signaled they might have to reconsider a part of the package -an investment tax credit -which is opposed by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and other key Democrats. 
"We're looking at it right now," White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers said. ''I'm not ruling it in, I'm not ruling it out."

New museum dedicated to memory of Holocaust 
WASHINGTON (AP) -A half century and a world away from the gas chambers of Auschwitz, Majdanek and Chelmno, a new Holocaust museum was dedi­cated Thursday to teach future generations the lessons of what one survivor called "the black hole in time. the black hole in history." 
Before 7,000 people, many of them survivors of the concen­tration camps erected by Nazi Germany in World War II with a mission to exterminate the Jews, came a repeated admoni­tion: Never again. 
From Elie Wiesel, who won a Nobel Prize for his efforts to keep the Holocaust memory alive, came this recollection: 
"In Poland, SS officers used Jewish infants for target prac­tice. The only emotion they ever showed was anger when they missed," he said. "In Kiev, an SS officer beheaded two Jewish children in front of her mother, who in her anguish, in prey of some mystical madness, held them close to her bosom and began to dance. In Romania, the Iron Guard hanged Jews on meat hooks and displayed them in butcher shops, with signs, 'Kosher Meat.'" 
Through starvation, execution, and overwork, Hitler's henchmen executed 6 million Jews, two third of the pre-war population of Europe, in their drive for a "Final Solution." 
In his dedication address. President Clinton said the mu­seum binds "one of the darkest lessons in history to the hopeful soul of America." 
At the end of his speech, Wiesel turned to Clinton. 
"Mr. President, I cannot not tell you something," he said. "I have been in the former Yu­goslavia last fall. I cannot sleep since (because oO what I have seen.... We must stop the bloodshed in that country. People fight each other and children die. Why? Something. anything, must be done." 
The president, who is con­sidering using military force in the former Yugoslavia, said "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia is 'but the most brutal and bla­tant" example of evil in the world today. 
The museum reminds the world "again and again how fragile are the safeguards of civilization," he said. 
Throughout the ceremony. held on a rainy, windy day on a plaza fronting the museum, the derisive chants of demonstra­tors who spread the falsehood that the Holocaust was a hoax, could be heard by the crowd. 
As if in answer, Clinton said, "Look at the liars and the pro­pagandists among us, the skinheads and the Liberty Lobby here at home, the Afrikaners Resistance Move­ment in South Africa, the radi­cal party of Serbia, the Russian Black Shirts .... 
"The evil represented in this museum is incontestable .... We must stop the fabricators of history and the bullies as well. Left unchallenged, they would still prey upon the powerless. and we must not permit that to happen again." 
The museum, built with $168 million in donated funds, will open to the public next Monday. Its admission is free but agencies that handle the tickets charge a fee. 


In the audience were the heads of 12 states and members of the Senate and the House. But attention was not on them. It was on the speakers. 
-Wiesel: "There were only two categories: those who were there to kill and those who were there to be killed." 
-Chaim Herzog, president of Israel: "For us, one of the major lessons has been that it is not 
AP/Aian Baseden 
sufficient to have justice on your side; it is essential to be strong enough to defend it." 
-Harvey Meyerhoff, chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council: "This building tells the story of events that human eyes should never have seen once, but having been seen, must never be forgotten .... It is not sufficient to remember the past. We must learn from it."

900-number industry claims government over-regulates 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The once flourishing world of 900 number telephone calls is in danger because of over-regu­lation by the federal govern­ment, industry executives told the Federal Trade Commission on Thursday. 
Take, for example, the warning the government wants in every TV commercial for a 900 number service. 
It absorbs nine seconds, or almost one third of a 30-second ad, said Francis Mooney of the American Association of Ad­vertising Agencies. 
"We needed a kick," said Bruce Fogel, chairman of Phone Programs Inc., whose company runs several sports information 900 number lines. But he said the industry got the message and cleaned up its act after previous FTC actions against it. 
The industry is shrinking, he said, "These rules will put us out of business." 
Consumer advocates have pushed for greater protection, particularly for 900 services aimed at children. 
The rules are being made to enforce the Telephone Disclo­sure and Dispute Resolution Act passed by Congress last Oc­tober. 
During a two-day workshop that started Thursday, the FTC is holding an open discussion of the rules with consumer ad­vocates, trade association rep­resentatives, 900 number ser­vice providers and phone com­panies.

Business Writer 
Tom Lowe, CEO of Playing Mantis Toys Inc., spoke on Wednesday to students as the featured speaker in the En­trepreneur Club's Lecture Series. 
One of the secrets to Lowe's success is that his goal in life was to be an entrepreneur. He definitely has become that, suc­cessfully selling many of his products to stores such as Ven­ture, Target, and Woolworth's. His sales figures show this suc­cess, as his company grossed $1.6 million in 1992, and $4 million in 1993. 
Lowe's company, based in Cassopolis, Michigan, which is in the Michiana region, does not manufacture any of its products. Instead, it only im­ports its products, which have been developed from Lo\Ve's ideas. 
Over one hundred various products have been developed, including a lock for Nintendo game systems and a stack rack for video games. However, Lowe does not develop just any product. "If I can't profit off the products, I won't use them," he said. 
Lowe also shared with the group his fourteen lessons for an entrepreneur whh;h he said he developed "through the school of hard knocks." 
The first lesson for an en­trepreneur is to formulate a business plan. "This is neces­sary to do from day one,"according to Lowe, 
Lowe next noted that not only will everything cost more than a person might think, but it will also take longer to ac­complish than previously planned. A wise entrepreneur should thus leave allowances for tl}is in his or her strategy planning. 
The next lesson is to make sure that a new venture is never undercapitalized. A problem for many en­trepreneurs that occurs all too often, said Lowe, is that they underestimate costs and over­estimate profits. 
In addition, owners of busi­nesses should make sure that

WASHINGTON-A General Electric whistleblower who sued his company for over­charging the United States for aircraft parts for Israel will get $11.45 million through a set­tlement with the U.S. govern­ment announced Thursday. 
Chester Walsh, represented by the Taxpayers Against Fraud, initially sued GE in 1990 under the False Claims Act that enables whistleblowers to share in recoveries from companies that defraud the government. 
The federal government 
oined in the litigation in 1991, nd last year, it entered an greement with GE requiring 
the company to pay $59.5 mil­lion. In addition to that amount, 
U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin in Cincinnati also imposed a $9.5 million fme. 
Last December, the judge ordered that Walsh should get some $13.4 million of the total, but the government objected, alleging that Walsh had been a party to GE's initial false claims. 
The government appealed the ruling, but while doing so, opened negotiations with Walsh leading to the agreement an­nounced by the Justice De­partment on Thursday. 
Since Walsh receive,d $2 mil­lion from the GE settlement as the appeal was pending, the government owes him $9.45 million more and must pay that within five days of court ap­proval of the agreement. 
The government also agreed to drop its appeal. 
The company last year admit­ted defrauding the Pentagon and the Israeli Defense Ministry by filing more than $40 million in false claims and was allowed to plead guilty to criminal charges of defrauding the federal government of $26.5 million. 
Walsh was working for GE in Israel when he became suspi­cious in 1987, he said at a news conference in Cincinnati last year. 
He said he waited four years to pursue charges against GE because he feared for his life while in Israel and that he couldn't prove his allegations until he smuggled some docu­ments out of Israel. 
He said he pursued the case because he believed it was the right thing to do. 
"It's always easy to sit back and do nothing," Walsh said. "You grow up with certain ethics, you believe in certain things, and you respond to that." 
CEO Lowe speaks to club 
they pay themselves last. An entrepreneur must be prepared to take his salary last. 
Besides performing market research and talking to poten­tial customers, it is important for an entrepreneur to have mentors and listen to their ad­vice. 
The proof of success is in how much of a product is sold. In order to sell successful amounts, an entrepreneur must love sales, going door-to-door and selling banks on their bank plan. 
It is also vital, said Lowe, to get the business' accounting books set up correctly from the beginning. 
A successful entrepreneur must learn to delegate his time, as it is his most precious asset. In addition it is always impor­tant for one to learn form his mistakes. 
An entrepreneur must realize the difficulty of finding quality people to work for his company. In the end, said Lowe, the only thing an entrepreneur can count on is his own individual persistence and enthusiasm.

PCC: Politically Correct Catholicism 
In re: Recommendation 1 of the Report of the Committee on Academic life for the Colloquy, "All who participate in hiring faculty must be cognizant of and responsive to the need for dedicated and committed Catholics to predominate in number among the faculty." 
Sed contra: As a communi­cant of the Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, I am obliged to find Recommendation 1 to be totally preposterous -indeed a historical. It, Recommendation 1, gives Roman Catholicism a very bad name, to say the Least. It seems, to be charitable, blatantly parochial as opposed to catholic. As a criterion for appointments in a primitive seminary or monastery, this recommendation "might" at best be valid. 
However, as a prescription for a totally catholic academic community (college/university), Recommendation 1 is insulting and a historical to "friends of the work" whose faith resides in diverse yet meaningful aspects of the great Graeco­Judeo-Christian Tradition -it an heterogeneous one rooted in a vast array of spiritual, moral and intellectual inspirations 
(e.g. Greek-Jewish-Christian, inter alia, Arabic, Asian, African thought. Yes, St. Au­gustine was of African origin). 
J. J. Carberry 
Pariah in Residence 
Given the most generous translation of Recommendation 1, are we then to deny a faculty post to a Maimonides in favor of a Tetzel? Deny a Sidney Hook in favor of some species of a Phil Donahue or Sister "Madonna"? Deny a Gertrude Himmelfarb in favor of a Mary Daly or Ann Quindlen? 
Who of the above is a "friend of the work" -a task which the great, sainted Professor Frank O'Malley described as that of "redeeming the times". 
We redeem not the times by capitulating to the more primi­tive, naive, though popular nostrums of political correct­ness -whether secular or transcendental. On the latter, more anon. 
A signal portion of this ad­ministration has surrendered to the most egregiously banal notions of a university per se, and now the most puerile con­cepts of Catholicism. 
Social concerns (legitimate ends) are fostered with scant regard for the substance of in­tellect which is the means nec­essary for the true realization of noble ends. 
Sports concerns (again legit­imate ends) have been deni­grated to bargain basement greed ... means scarcely com­mensurate with the concept of the university as a House of Intellect, Body and Spirit ­once revered but now distorted cavalierly by a simplest perver­sion of :·For God, Country and Notre Dame". 
The mindless dogmas of PC (Politically Correct) have at du Lac been "baptized" as PCC (Politically Correct Catholicism). 
This, the University of Notre Dame du Lac, is becoming naught but a pious, mindless College of Social and Sports Concerns with, if Recommen­dation 1 is not summarily re­jected, an academic appendage presided over by Catholic Cot­ton Mathers whose parochial­ism gives the Inquisition a good name, indeed. 
Recommendation 1 of the Committee on Academic Life for the Colloquy, is, whilst pleasing to the feeble minds of "Politically Correct Catholics", naught but an insult to the very notion of a catholic Catholic university and as such, an egregious distortion of Roman Catholicism.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Weapons are not the cure for 'corrupt' nations 
Dear Editor, 

I am writing in response to John Davenport's letter "European Development Needs Examination, Action" (April 14, 1993) in which he condemns the war in former Yugoslavia and compares the Serbs in their warfare to the Nazis. So far, so good. But when he urges the "European Unity" (EU) to take military action against the Serbs (and also against Neo­Nazis all over Europe) things get a little more complicated. 
It is his rhetoric that bothers me, such as the initiative," To purify American from the rotting corruption we had fought the Civil War." 
Oh, so the killing was a purification! And I guess this cleansing was successful or else we would still have the K.K.K. or politicians like David Duke, right? And how comforting to know that the enemy, who comes of course from the outside, can so easily be identified, isolated and extinguished! What Mr. Davenport is watching now is "the corruption of the very spirit of Europe." 
Being from Western Europe, it surprises me to see how homogeneously Europe is perceived in this statement and how in Mr. Davenport's head all Europe finds itself united by a spirit. This essentialist discourse is dangerously close to the very rhetoric that is produced out of the nationalistic ideology against which Mr. Davenport ostensibly writes. His call for "military steps" to "cure" the "disease" reiterates the pseudo­arguments with which many warfarers, including the Serbs, 'justified' their attacks. 
And although Mr. Davenport has found the root of all wars: "overconfidence" he does not shy away from what seems to me a rather over-confident "message from me to the peoples of Western Europe." 
Moreover, what he asks for is a participation of the EU in the war. Most astonishingly, Mr. Davenport claims that such an expansion of the war will prove that Western Europe is "fit to hold a place among civilized nations." Apart from factual mistakes in his letter, his suggested solution to the Balkan war -or, as he put it -his "cure" for a "highly infectious disease" is precisely a continuation of nationalist and essentialist rhetoric and, most irritatingly, a clarion call to war. 
Let me be so presumptuous as to conclude with a personal wish-list from me to all the Davenports: "Please be more aware with which rhetoric you align yourself; don't fool yourself into believing that there is a truly good essence or spirit of one nation or another and one which, if corrupted, has to be cured by weapons; and don't fool yourself into believing that war is a pragmatic inevitability.

Tropical paradise finds its way to South Bend 
By TONY POTTINGER 
Accent Writer 

Seeking a tropical paradise but don't want to pay the air­fare? If so, the Hawaii Club's Annual Luau may be just the the thing you're looking for. 
Hula dancing, traditional singing, and a raffie round out Saturday evenin,g from 7 to 9 p.m., in the LaFortune Student Center Ballroom. 
For Notre Dame's Hawaiian students, the luau provides an important opportunity to reaffirm their cultural identity in faraway South Bend. 
Saturday night's event will allow the Notre Dame commu­nity to experience an often

misunderstood culture as well as raise funds for local charities sponsored by the Hawaii Club. 
Keeping with the cultural 

elements of the Islands' traditional feast and celebration, the luau will blend old customs and those of contemporary Hawaiian cultural life. 
Much of the folk dances which will be performed at the luau precedes Captain Cook, whom is considered the "discoverer" of the island chain. 
"We want to have traditional elements but with modern things as well," said Rob Nobriga, newly elected president of the club. 
Island foods will be served as well. All foods have been sent from the islands and are native recipes. Pineapples and poi, a type of root which serves as the Hawaiian's staple, will be served in addition to more ex­otic dishes such as kalua pig. Kalua pig is a native specialty which is covered in tea leaves and cooked in a hole dug into the ground. 
"The luau serves as an in­valuable and refreshing social change for the students in the Hawaii club. Often, we lind our­selves forgetting that we arc in South Bend," explains Nobriga. 
With most island students unable to return home other than for Christmas and summer breaks, "the luau enables us to keep the homesickness at a minimum by hanging out with the local guys and girls," he said.

"Our quarterback is going to have to carry our offense to 
a large extent." LOU HOLTZ Head Coach 
Sophomore Lee Becton's performance this spring has given him the edge at tailback. 
The Observer/David Hungellng 
By BRIAN KUBICKI Assistant Sports Editor 
The storm is over. The dis­play of Thunder and Lightning has passed over Notre Dame leaving the Irish looking for a break in the clouds. 
With the departures of last year's standouts, Heggie Brooks and Jerome Bettis, the Irish backfield was hoping that break might come during their spring practices. 
"The people we have now are at the same stage as Heggie Brooks before his senior season," offered backfield coach Earle Mosley as a comparison. "We're a very close knit group. We're not a unit of stars. We've had stars, but we've never had that attitude." 
According to head coach Lou Holtz, Lee Becton has secured the tailback spot with fellow sophomore Travis Davis to back him up. "(Becton) is not a flashy runner, but a very very solid runner, a very very consistent runner and plays well without the football," he said. 
Holtz gave Ray Zellars the nod at the fullback spot. 
''I'm trying to show I can be consistent and to show the coaches what I can do,"

Lou Holtz called Lake Dawson's spring, "the best by a Notre Dame reciever." 
; 
explained the sophomore of his spring performance. 
Holtz was quick to point out this is not in granite. Lytle and freshman Marcus Thorne will be battling for the second spot, as well as a possible starting spot. 
These positions are even less stable in light of the incoming freshman class. Both tailbacks, Randy Kinder from East Lansing, Mich. and Robert Farmer from Bolingbrook, Ill., were named to the Parade All-America team. At the fullback spot, Marc Edwards comes from Norwood, Ohio as the USA To­day player of the year for the state of Ohio. 
"Their biggest obstacle is learning what to do," said Mosley of the incoming fresh­men. 
Mosley said that the backs have focused this spring on avoiding turnovers (fumbles), and getting at least four yards on each carry during these practices. 
The Irish backs have not gone through this spring trou­blefree, however. Midway through the practice season, Lytle severely sprained an an­kle, and his is not listed in the depth chart for Saturday's Blue-Gold game. 
Dawson draws rave reviews 
By JASON KELLY Associate Sports Editor 
All eyes have been on the quarterback battle between Paul Failla and Kevin McDougal, but regardless of who is throwing the ball, Notre Dame has a talented group of receivers who can catch it. 
The loss of lrv Smith, Ray Griggs and Jerome Bettis took away three of Notre Dame's top pass catchers, but there is a solid crop of veterans returning, led by junior Lake Dawson. 
Dawson made the biggest splash this spring, securing a starting position. 
"Lake Dawson will start," Irish coach Lou Holtz said. "He's had the best spring of any receiver we've encountered here." 
Dawson was quick to spread credit around for his 
Spring outlook on 

Line changes permanent 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN 
Sports Editor 
Despite a variety of position changes, unsettled players, and injuries, the offensive line has emerged from spring in its normal position, as the strength of the offense. 
Aaron Taylor and Todd Nor­man completed successful transitions from starting guards to first team tackles, joining returning center Tim Huddy along the front five. 
Offensive line coach Joe Moore needed only to fill in the holes between his trio of vet­eran lineman, a task which is easier said than done. 
The left guard appeared to be set when freshman Will Lyell performed well in the early part of spring, but an ankle in­jury sidelined him for the later part of practice. Fifth-year se­nior Lance Johnson took ad­vantage of his chance, impress­ing the coaches in the final three practices. 
Johnson is penciled in as the starter going into fall but Lyell is not out of the equation. His ankle is only a slight sprain which should be fully healed come fall. 
No starter was named at right guard. Sophomore Mark Zataveski and freshman Dusty Ziegler will continue the battle they waged in spring during the fall. 
Zataveski started spring drills as the favorite, but gave way to Ziegler in the final few prac­tices. Ziegler moved over from tackle and has impressed in only a few days at guard. His footwork is considered the best on the team, but doesn't appear to be as aggressive as Zataveski. 
"Dusty Ziegler has a chance to be an outstanding football player, but Zataveski is an ex­cellent competitor so I wouldn't rule him out of that race as well," commented Holtz. 
"I need to work on my legs, keeping my feet under me, and my flexibility in the offseason," said Zataveski. "I improved a little in those areas this spring, but I need to keep improving."

The other starter hasn't been determined. Senior Adrian Jarell, junior Clint Johnson, sophomore Mike Miller and freshman Derrick Mayes will compete for the position. 
"It's wide open, we just can't pick a starter at the present time," Holtz said. "(Mayes) has a slight edge, but he needs to aquire some of Dawson's habits." 
Dawson made a habit of catching the ball last season, pulling in 25 passes for 462 yards and a touchdown to lead the Irish. And he continued his torrid pace this spring to stay ahead of the pack. Three tight ends remain in

contention for the starting job this fall, led by junior Oscar McBride. Freshmen Leon Wallace, and Pete Chryplewicz will also contend for the job. 
"McBride has a slight edge over Wallace, but its unfortunate that Peter Chryplewicz missed much of spring," Holtz said. "All three players improved, but we need to make more improvement there." 
McBride was pleased with the strides each player made at tight end, and he is not concerned about the pressure of filling the big shoes of lrv Smith. 
"Irv is the best, and playing under him will eventually make you the best," McBride said. "There is no pressure because the coaches have confidence in us and we have confidence in ourselves." 
Kicker,

unsettled 
By MIKE NORBUT Sports Writer 
With the upcoming gradua­tion of Craig Ilentrich, who earned Honorable Mention All­American honors this year from Football America, Notre Dame finds itself in need of a 
s o I i d 
replacement to take over the kicking Kevin

duties. 
This spring Pendergast revealed only two likely replacements Kevin Pender­gast and Drew Marsh. "They've both been doing fairly well this spring," said special teams coach Keith Armstrong. Pendergast has a slight edge over Marsh. The former soc­
cer player booted two field goals of 32 yards into a stiff wind in a scrimmage two 
weeks ago. 
"He (Pendergast) is pretty ac­curate and has a strong leg. That's why he's in the lead," continued Armstrong. "Marsh needs to work on his strength." 
The Irish can only look to walk-on Brent Boznanski to handle the punting duties. Though he has had good distance in pre-season drills, his hang time has been lacking. He will be chal!mged by recruit Brian Ford in the fall.

Bereich, Wynn earn jobs 
By JASON KELLY 
Associate Sports Editor 
Hidden for three seasons in 
the shadow of Demetrius Du­
Bose, junior inside linebackers 
Anthony Peterson and Pete 
Bereich finally emerged from 
the darkness this spring. 
They anchored an Irish de­fense that has been dominant during spring practice. 
"We knew we could play well," Bereich said. "We picked up the defense pretty quickly in the spring and it was surprising how fast we came together as a group." 
The loss of DuBose and 
Brian Ratigan left some holes 
at linebacker, but Bereich and 
Peterson proved in spring 
practice that they can fill those 
holes. 
"Pete Bereich had an excel­lent spring and Anthony Peter­son is an outstanding linebacker," Irish coach Lou Holtz said. "Bereich lacks the speed and he won't be able to do everything DuBose did, but he'll make us better in some other areas, and I think Peter­son is a very underrated player." 
Peterson is Notre Dame's top returning tackler, and he and Bereich are the only veterans with considerable playing ex­perience. 
"(Peterson) and I have both played a lot in the past, and we will have to be leaders on the field," Bereich said. "But the whole defense has been there before, except for Renaldo." 
That is freshman Renaldo Wynn, who made quite an im­pact at outside linebacker this spring, earning the starting spot heading into the fall sea­son. 
"Renaldo Wynn will be our outside linebacker," Holtz said. "He has definitely established himself there. He has great speed and he could be a very, very good football player." 
Sophomore Jeremy Nau and freshman Kevin Carretta will also compete for playing time at outside linebacker. 
"I am really pleased with our linebackers," Holtz said. "They have been a really pleasant surprise."

Young heads talented group 

By JENNY MARTEN 
Associate Sports Editor 
Everyone has heard of the Four Horsemen. Now, it looks like the Notre Dame football team is going to have another feared foursome, but this time on defense. 
Defensive coordinator Rick Minter changed the Irish de­fense to best utilize the strength of the returning defensive linemen and switched to a four­mao line this spring, allowing the Irish to best use their talent on the line. 
With juniors Brian Hamilton, Bryant Young and Jim Flani­gan, Oliver Gibson and sopho­more Germaine Holden return­ing with signifigant playing time, the four-mao front will make sure that the bulk of that experience is on the field. 
Since instituted this spring, the 4-3 defense with its strong line has worked well in the spring practices and scrim­mages, but it has been just a small change for the linemen. 
"We really didn't change that much," said Irish defensive line coach Mike Trgovac. "We just changed words... Everything is easier. That's why we did it, to cut down on the mental and physical aspects, so they can perfect more techniques." 
So far the players have been pleased with the way the new line has worked this spring. 
"I think it's gone exceptionally well," said Flanigan. "The defense has been playing really good and I think it'll continue to do well." 
Flanigan, who started 10 games at nosetackle last fall, saw his position disappear in the new system, but has found his job to be easier now. 
"It's easier for me because I'm just playing on one side of the line rather than flip-flop­ping all the time," said Flani­gan. 
Hamilton has also liked the change. 
"It has helped us out a lot be­cause a lot of guys play now," said Hamilton. "Basically, it's the same." 
The Irish have the benefit of a number of talented replacements. Junior Oliver Gibson, and freshman Paul Grasmanis and Thomas KNight have shown to be capable backups. 
Although the defense and the line has been strong in spring scrimmages, there are still work to be done. Trgovac is looking for more consistency and he says although he has five players he feels confident with, he wants to find more back-ups. 
Hamilton agrees that consis­tency needs to be worked on. 
"We're still getting continuity. We need to keep continuity," said Hamilton. 
None the less, Trgovac is confident the line can handle it. 
"The great thing about them is the way they've worked hard. They know they have a long way to go," said Trgovac. 
Defensive backs all but set 
By JONATHAN JENSEN 
Associate Sports Editor 
As a tribute to their unique 
combination of experience arid 
talent, this spring the respon­
sibilities of the defensive sec­
ondary have evolved to the 
point that each member is 
deemed as "interchangeable." 
Defensive backs coach Joe 
Wessel has been able to take 
advantage of their strengths 
and avoid weaknesses this 
spring by having juniors Jeff 
Burris, Greg Lane, and John 
Covington, and freshman 
Bobby Taylor learn both the 
corner and safety positions. As 
a result, each has grown more 
aware of each other's roles on 
the field, and the group sees 
themselves becoming not only 
a strong, cohesive unit, but the 
strength of an outstanding de­
fensive fc Jtball team. 
"This defense is going to be a 
real strong point on this team," 
noted Lane, who collected 57 
tackles last season. "I think 
this is going to be the best 
defense that people have seen 
in a while." 
As of the present defensive 
alignment, Taylor and Lane are 
the designated as the safeties, 
whereas Burris and Covington 
are the safeties. However, con­
trary to how it has been in past 
years, there is really no desig­
nated field or wide corner, 
strong or free safety this year. 
"In this defense, we have 
more of a chance to run loose. 
I the past we've had to play 
like we're on a rope," noted 
Covington, "It lets you relax 
and do more. It lets you make 
more chances." 
Though each of the defensive 
backs are anxious to play 
under the new system, one 
would think that such a system 
would sometimes create 
match-up problems for the 
Irish defense. However, they 
are confident the defense can 
flourish under the new system. 
"We have confidence that 
we're going to put them in a 
situation where they can suc­
,
ceed," noted Wessel. "We can make situation changes, and they'll be capable of doing that. You can't put a barometer on what their experience brings to the defense."

but neither looked impressive enough to put a stranglehold on the job. Holtz hinted towards a slight edge for McDougal but felt neither had played well 
... enough to dismiss thoughts of the other starting. "Kevin McDougal basically because he has been in the program a year longer would get the nod," said Holtz. "If we went into the situation with our football team the way it is right 
r· 
now one would start and the other would play. It would be a two quarterback situation. 
"Kevin probably throws the ball better, has more experi­ence and more arm strength. It is natural for him to be farther along because he has been in the system longer, but Paul has done some good things, and the team has responded to both of sive line, which also includes sophomore Mark Zataveski, a challenger for one guard spot. 
A lack of experience in the Gold offensive line should be tested by three first team play­ers on the Blue defensive front. Lineman Brian Hamilton and Jim Flanigan join linebackers Pete Bereich and Renaldo Wynn to form a imposing unit. Jeff Burris and Greg Lane anchor the Blue secondary. 
Kevin Pendergast will handle the kicking duties for the Blue, Drew Marsh and Brent Boz­nanski for the Gold. 
Holtz will watch from the press box, as his assistants do the coaching. Defensive Coor­dinator Rick Minter will head the Gold, while offensive Coor­~-­dinator Skip Holtz will call the signals for the Blue. 
"Truthfully., the game isn't the best thing for our players," said Holtz, "a scrimmage would be more beneficial. If it wasn't benefitting the scolarship fund of the Notre Dame Club of Saint Joseph't Valley, we would have a scrimmage instead. 
"But we want our players to have fun, and we want to be able to evaluate how they perform in front of people," said Lou Holtz. 
All proceeds from the game benefit the Notre Dame Club of Saint Joseph's Valley scholar­ship fund . 
Following the game, the team will not practice again until fall 
them." 
During the spring both play­ers have had their moments, but it has been more of a learn­ing process. 
"We have tried to get them better fundamentally," said Quarterbacks Coach Tom Clements, "and they have both improved over the course of ttie spring." 
The development of McDou­gal and Failla was hampered at times. Failla has had to con­tend with baseball practice and games, while McDougal missed the majority of one scrimmage and was slowed in another be­cause of an ankle injury. 
"Basically, I've been really run down, my arm hasn't had the pop," commented Failla. "It has also been very mentally taxing, but I am happy with the way I played." 
"The ankle feels good. I practiced on it Tuesday and it felt fine," stated McDougal. "I wish that I wouldn't have missed part of that one practice, but overall I feel that I performed OK." 
Their performance in Satur­day's Blue-Gold game will have some relevance, but for the most part the quarterback for the 1993 Irish will be deter­mined during fall drills. 
"We are going to bring them in (during the fall) and give ev­erybody a chance," added Holtz. "We are going to have to make decisions very early, and go from there." 
Come fall the quarterback equation will increase by two with the addition of prep starts Tom Krug and Hon Powlus. 
The lack of a number one quarterback entering fall camp only fuels speculation that Powlus, the naiton's top high school player, could come in and start. 
"The freshman will get an opportunity," added Holtz.

o AnTostal to perform for students 
"I never really liked Blues Traveler's music from their CO's that much, but when I saw them in concert over this past December I thought they were phenomenal. Their show was amazing," said Sean Moran, a Cavanaugh resident. 
"We drew from our experi­ences of living in and around New York City," said Kinchla of the 
deeper in direction they took when writing Thieves, their most recent album, Save His ed their Soul. musical Although Save His Soul has not had enough time to tell whether touring or not it will be a big hit, the ­covered band is very optimistic about it. 
"The sessions got off to a really great start and it was natural and part of a maturing process to collectively produce this album," said Kinchla of the band's idea to produce this album by themselves. 
After all that time in the studio and off the road, Blues Traveler is ready to get back on the road and begin touring again. 
"We've really missed being out there for the last six months. We've got a really bad case of needing to play for people. We're all determined to keep on the road and out of the ditch," said Popper.

Punk opera debuts at Saint Mary's 

By MATT CARBONE 
Assistant Accent Editor 
You've seen the signs plas­tered all over campus. 
Next to an illustration of a goofy-looking, beer-guzzling reptile are words urging you to "Experience Frogboy." 
Who, you ask, is Frogboy? 
"Frogboy is half frog, half boy," said James Kennedy, Sorin Hall sophomore and writer, director and producer of "Frogboy." 
Sure, but that doesn't really te II us anything we didn't already know. 
So there's more. 
Billed as a "rock music and drama spectacular," Kennedy describes "Frogboy" as "a punk rock opera -kind of like Fugazi meets The Cocktails meets 'Star Wars."' 
The idea for "Frogboy" was conceived by Kennedy and Joe Cannon, a Stanford Hall junior, before Christmas break. 
"It was [final] exam week and we wanted to waste time," said Kennedy. 
For two days, Kennedy, a member of the campus band Bother and disc jockey at WVFl, and Cannon, a member of the campus band Emily, sweated and pored over the "Frogboy" saga. 
Kennedy wrote the dialogue, while Cannon provided all of the songs. 
"The music isn't too terribly punk," said Kennedy. "It's kind 
'The music is not too terribly punk. It's kind of like lounge/ jazz/ hard core music. It's kind of hard to explain without seeing it in person.' 
-James Kennedy 
of like lounge/jazz/hardcore music." 
The opera centers around a conflict between a group of frogs and the toads who over­whelm them. 
The hero Frogboy then enters the picture, leading the frogs over the toads, then suffering a tragic fall as he becomes bloated with power. 
"It's a morality play I sup­pose," said Kennedy. "It's kind of hard to explain without see­ing it in person." · 
"Frogboy" will be staged April 25 at 9 p.m., at the Qalloway's Coffeehouse at Saint Mary's.

"Living afSaint Mary's allows the students to feel comfortable with the other students in the residence halls and this opportunity makes the transfer to Saint-Mary's easier the following year," said admission counselor Denise Martin. 
Martin explained that this arrangement provides incentive for the students. The students get to be a part of the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame community while at the same time being a Holy Cross student. 
In order for the students to transfer to Saint Mary's the fol­lowing year. they must maintain a 3.0 grade point average each semester. 
If, at the end of th!'l school year, the students have fulfilled these requirements, they may transfer to Saint Mary's as full time students without reapplying. 
This option to enter the Linkage Program is not available to everyone. This program is only introduced to the students who demonstrate academic promise and a strong desire to become a Saint Mary's student. 
Martin said that very few applicants are offered this option and being that the 1992-93 school year was the first year it has been implemented, few accepted. 
As participants in the program, students must report to Brian Greve, academic advisor for Holy Cross, and also to Susan Vanek, the freshman academic advisor at Saint Mary's, as well. This advising serves as a basis for entry into the Saint Mary's community. · 
The program has been met with a positive response among the students involved in the program. 
"I feel that everyone involved has been given a wonderful opportunity," said Saint Mary's freshman Maureen Davis. "We have been warmly welcomed in to the Saint Mary's community. This program has made it possible for us to be­come the students we've wanted to be." 
The Linkage Program continues to grow as plans for next year's students increase. Promising applicants receive a brochure and a videotape outlining the program and provid­ing information, Martin said. 
"Speaking for others as well as myself. this program and the people involved have been very helpful and we think the Linkage Program is a wonderful idea," Davis added.

Top eight dominate 
By BRYAN CONNOLLY 
Sports Writer 
Bookstore Basketball XXII completed the Sweet Sixteen round of the tournament yes­terday without one of the top eight seeds being upset, sur­prisingly. 
Ironically. the top three seeds had a more difficult time oust­ing their foes than did the five seeds below them. 
Top seed Malicious Prosecu­tion took a fast lead over six­teen seed Smooth Momentum in the first half, and it seemed that the game would be a Iaugher. Smooth refused to let up, however, and surged in the second half to make the game interesting. Malicious pulled out the victory 21-15 behind Brian McDermott's nine points. 
"We didn't play very aggressive," said Malicious captain Ken Boehner. "We let down a little bit. 
"I think we probably under­estimated these guys." he added. "They should've been in the top eight." 
As opposed to Malicious, Te­quila White Lightning started the game poorly and finished off strong. Fifteen seed NO's Most Wanted jumped out to leads of 3-0 and 5-2 before Te­quila tied the game at seven and gained a lead which it would not relinquish. 
Tequila adjusted to NO's 2-3 zone by forcing the ball down low to Eric Jones and football

player Brian Ratigan, who sim­ply overpowered the smaller defense. Tequila, who elimi­nated ND's Most Wanted from last year's tournament in the Round of 32, won the match 21­14 "We didn't shoot the ball like we like to," said Tequila captain Mike MacKinnon. "We did well when we got the ball in close, and defensively we played alright." Three seed H-A-H-D-K-0-R-E allowed seventeen points, the most any losing team scored all day, to The More We Win, The llarder It Gets. The contest was fairly close until the second half when II-A-H-D-K-0-H-E ex­panded its lead to a seemingly untouchable amount. However, with the score 20-12 The More We Win threw a slight scare into its opponent by rattling off five unanswered points. 11-A-R­D-K-0-H-E stopped its show-

boating attempts and worked it down low for the final point. 
"It's a catch twenty-two," said captain Ray Griggs. "When we start playing bad, we start do­ing well. They were tough." 
None of the five other victors allowed their opponents to score as many points as each of the other three losing teams scored. 
In response to recent unruli­ness from both spectators and players, commissioners of Bookstore Basketball XXII have expressed concern about the potential for inappropriate be­havior in the final three rounds of the tournament. 
"We've had many complaints concerning the treatment that the crowd has given to both the teams playing and the referees," said Head Commissioner Andy Sinn. "If we continue to see this harassing behavior we may resort to roping off the area around the courts." 
"We will have professional

sioner John O'Rourke. "They're easily the best team in the tournament." 
#2 ANTHONY TRAVEL 
Anthony Travel is led by Irish women's basketball coach Muffet McGraw and her two as­sistant coaches Sandy Botham and Sara Liebscher. The team rebounds well and likes to run the fast break while playing a zone defense. They will face a major challenge this weekend because McGraw and Botham will be out of town tomorrow, Saturday, and possibly Sunday. 
"Sara will have to pick up the slack because she can do it in­side and out," said Botham. 
#3 RING MY BELLE 
This squad has two six-foot tall ex-members of the St. Mary's varsity team. It tries to get it inside to them whenever it can and it tries to run the fast break. 
"With the excitement of Bookstore you get very nervous and anxious," said Ring My Belle player Jennifer Conville. "If we just take our time and think things through, then hopefully everything will click together." 
#4 KISS OF FINESSE 
Captained by ex-Notre Dame player Comalita Haysbert, this team mainly plays play-ground basketball. It relies on its de­fense and the superior individ­ual talent of its players. 
"Right now we're just hoping to make it to the Final Four," said Haysbert. 
#5 SLIAMM &J 
Consisting basically of Farley Hall's interhall starting five, Sllamm & J is a tall team which rebounds, blocks shots well, and plays together on offense . 
"If we play well together and click as a team." said captain Leslie Fautsch, "we'll go pretty far." 
#6 YOU DON'T HAVE BALLS EITHER 
All members of Pasquerilla East's semi-finalist interhall team, this short squad relies on its passing and solid outside shooting for success. 
"If we can keep our outside shots going," said team member Melissa Gutierrez, "I think we have a pretty good shot at it." 
#7 YA YOU KNOW ME 
With a Run 'n Gun offense bolstered by two St. Mary's veterans, this team likes to 
maining patient on offense when necessary. 
"We need to play together, keep up the fast pace, relax, and have fun," said team member Carrie Piercy. 
#9 FIVE POSITIONS AND A ONE NIGHT STAND 
Just having knocked off eighth seed BWA, this team carries momentum into the Fi­nal Eight. With two players who can post up down low, it has a combination of an outside and inside game. 
"We're not going to be intim­idated," said team captain Jeannine Trezvant. "We're going to have fun and play our game."

SMC softball splits with St. Francis 
BY JENNIFER GUSTAFSON Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
The tables were turned for the Saint Mary's softball team on Wednesday. After defeating the Lady Pilots of Bethel College in both games last year, the Belles dropped both contests this year, 2-1 and 8-1. 
Following these two losses, the Belles improved yesterday by beating Saint Francis College in their first game, though they fell in the second. 
Freshman Michelle Limb was the winning pitcher for the Belles in game one. Junior Stacy Bogataj, who was the second leading hitter for the Belles last year and continues to be a power house at the plate

spring break in Florida, where the Belles were easy 13-7 win­ners. 
"Although we beat them, they were a good team," Murphy pointed out. "Our defense needs to back up our pitchers more because they are a strong hitting team." 
However, Anderson was without their starting pitcher for the contest. Anderson coach Larry Holloway feels that this will help Anderson today, for although she is not a quick pitcher, she consistently throws strikes. The Belles, who have been plagued by fielding errors this season, must also watch Anderson junior Kim Lawson, who had two hits in as many at­tempts against the Belles. 
Saturday will find the Belles on the road again as they travel to Chicago to take on the Uni­versity of Chicago. 
Pitching will again be a strength for the Belles. Murphy, who is the starting catcher,feels that although both starters are freshmen, they play with much experience. 
"Our pitching has been very consistent this season," she explained. "The contributions of the pitchers have added to many wins this season."

Lacrosse tries to regroup at Ohio State 
By KEVIN MCGUIRE Sports Writer 
After losing their last two out of three and falling to #16 in the rankings, the Notre Dame lacrosse team (9-2) hopes to find the perfect tonic to cure them of their uninspired play when they travel to Columbus, Ohio on Saturday to faceoff against the Buckeyes of Ohio State.

But the Irish have to come into the game focusing all their attention on what is at hand, and not looking ahead to a much better team in Michigan State next week. The game against the Buckeyes will begin the key two-game set the Irish will play versus Midwest Hegion opponents.

Baseball travels to MCC foe Evansville 
By JENNY MARTEN Associate Sports Editor 
A tough weekend is ahead for the 24th-ranked Notre Dame baseball team (24-8) as the Irish travel to Evansville to take on the Purple Aces (23-12). 
The four-game Midwestern Collegiate Conference series features a rematch of the MCC championship game from the last three years. Evansville took the title in 1990. but the Irish have won it in the last two years. Notre Dame leads the MCC while Evansville is looking for some wins over the Irish to climb back into contention from fourth place. 
Notre Dame is 15-1 in the MCC and Evansville is 7-5. Last weekend, the Irish swept a four-game series against Duquesne while Evansville dropped three of four to Detroit-Mercy. 
Evansville will definitely be looking for some wins from the Irish, according to Irish coaeh Pat Murphy. 
"They're probably tired of us beating them. It's a hostile environment down there," said Murphy. "Evansville at home is a very tough club." 
The Aces are 12-3 at Bosse Held in Evansville this season, with bi!} wins over Indiana, Louisville and Western Kentucky. Evansville will also be fired up to beat the Irish because head coach Jim Brownlee is just one win away from his 400th career victory. 
Senior Aaron Gries is one of Evansville's hottest hitters with a .307 average and 25 runs batted in. Gries went 7 for 14 with four runs scored against Detroit Mercy last weekend. His 16 extra-base hits this season are more than he has had in any previous year. Gries is also dangerous on the basepaths with a team-leading 13 stolen bases. 
The Aces will count on Marty Watson (.366, 36 HBI. 12 IIHl. Pat Schultz (.361, 22 HBI) and Sal Fasano (.350, 29 HBI) for more power at the plate.
