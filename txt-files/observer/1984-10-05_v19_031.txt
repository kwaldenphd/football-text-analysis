No United Way funds will support agencies that sponsor abortions 
ByJOEREID 
News Staff 
No money collected in this year's 
United Way fund drive will support 
agencies that provide abortions, said 
Patrick Mangan, United Way staff ad· 
visor. Also, this year dorms can 
specify what agency will receive the 
money they collect. 

"Ninety-nine percent of the money collected will remain in the local agencies and one percent will go to the national United Way. The one percent covers administrative costs and none will go to the other United Ways," said Mangan, associ­ate director for campaign and com­munication of St. Joseph County's United Way. 
President of Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Right to Life, Teresa Donovan, said, "We understand the St. Joseph County United Way does not contribute in any way to Planned Parenthood (an agency that considers abortion an alternative to pregnancy). The University Right to Life Organization has no problems with this year's drive, although some people may on principle." 
Although the local United Way does not sponsor agencies that promote abortions, one percent of the money collected covers admin­istrative costs for the national United Way, and some United Way branches do choose to promote such agencies. 

Besides the annual door to door approach, Co-Chairmen of Notre Dame's United Way Drive, Tom Lezynski and Steve Bert asked each dorm to do something extra to generate funds. Keenan Hall Presi­dent Kevin Howard said, "We are going to give a week's revenue from our game room and raise the price of our SYR tickets Sl." Howard said most dorms will probably adopt a particular agency to support. 
Campus events are also planned this year to help the drive attain its S12,500 goal. Lezynski said planned events include "Monday Night Foot· ball" night at Senior Bar, two showings ofOctopussy, and possibly a dance in the ACC Monogram Room Oct. 12. 
Lezynski emphasized there was "no limit in giving" and calls on the students to support the activities. This year's slogan is, "Caring costs a lot, not caring costs more." 
Non-alcoholic social events are successful, says SMC dean 
By CATIIYANN REYNOLDS 
News Staff 
"More events that are fun are without alcohol,"said Saint Mary's Dean of Student Affairs Karol Jack­owski last night in Regina Hall's South Lounge. 
Her talk was a part of Alcohol Awareness Week. She spoke on the history of alcohol policies at Saint Mary's. 
Dry since 1844, in 1977 Saint Mary's revised its policy. Since then the administration, the faculty and the students, have worked together 
to examine the use of alcohol at so­
cial events. 
The "hardest obstacle with a policy is the attitude 'we can't have a good time without alcohol,' "Jack­owski said. This fall she notices "angry Notre Dame students coming here and drinking." Jackowski says this "anger will take time to work out." The success of an alcohol policy depends on the "attitude of the administration," Jackowski said. 
In 1979, a national survey of col­lege students showed that of those surveyed, 1S percent ofSaint Mary's students, eight percent of Notre 

Congress fails to approve emergency finance measures 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON · Despite last· minute attempts by Congress to keep federal funds flowing, the White House told hundreds of thousands of federal workers to go home at midday yesterday after law­makers failed to appru¥e a $';00 bil­lion catchall spending bill needed to keep most of the government sol vent. 
While the government was par­tially shut down, Pn:sident Reagan and congressional leaders traded partisan charges of who was to blame for the mess, which also left in doubt whether Congress could meet its target of adjourning for the year by the end of the week. 
'Ibe House voted yesterday mor­ning to approve an emergency spending extension to finance out­of-ca'ih government agencies through 6 p.m. EDT today, and the Senate followed suit early in the eve­ning. 
Edwin Dale, spokesman for the White House Office of Management and the Budget, said the president was expected to sign the temporary money measure. All furloughed workers, he said, sbtiuld report for work at their regular time today. 
Before acting on the temporary measure, the long-term bill -the most expensive, most-inclusive piece of legislation ever to be con· sidered by Congress -gained final Senate approval on a voice vote after more than a week of debate cul­minated by two around-the-clock Senate sessions. 
Congressional negotiators, 

' meeting to work out a compromise version of the spending bills passed by the House and.Senate, indicated they would be bargaining all night and into Friday morning. 
Dame studt:nts, and 12.7 percent of Asked about the decrease in al­national students were heavy coholism since this council formed, drinkers. This study prompted the Jackowski said "no one knows the administration to form a committee the causes of the disease," but there of faculty and administration mem­has been a "decrease in problems bers to study creating an atmo­relative to abusive drinking." sphere where people could drink Jackowski says that the reason for responsibly. This included ending abusive drinking as of 1979 was that the tradition of a 'champagne break­drinking was "socially acceptable, fast' at the Sophomore Parents it's part of family life, and culturally weekend. it's the drug ofchoice." Another re.a­
sun for alcohol abuse is that in upper-middle-class society, it is "okay to do it." 
Jackowski admits "drinking pat· terns are different among men and women." However, "based on our experience we will see a de· emphasis of alcohol" at social func­tions at Notre Dame once anger over the new alcohol policy is diffused. 



Brown students consider cyanide 


as alternative to nuclear survival 
By VIC SCIULLI 
Senior StaffReporter 
Suicide could become an al­ternative for the survivors of a nuclear war says jason Saltzman, a Brown University sophomore who is attempting to get cyanide stocked in the Rhode Island school's health center. 
Saltzman is one of the originators of a referendum that would allow cyanide to he made available for students to <.·ommit suicide in the event of a nuclear holocaust. Seven hundrt"d stu­dents signed a petition that will allow the referendum to he in­cluded on the the ballot for stu· dent council elections next week. The upcoming vote has at· tractcd national media attention. 
Saltzman said he got the idea for the referendum from the movie "On the Beach," the story of a group of people surviving in Australia after the rest of the world perishes in a nuclear war. 
Saltzman said he became more 
interested in the possible after­
math of a nuclear holocaust two 
years ago when he tried to get the 
university's . administration to 
declare the SO fallout shelters on 
campus i.Jseless. 
A student approached him 
about the idea of having suicide 
pills made available on campus in 
the event of a nuclear war. 
Saltzman said that he thought the 
idea was a good one but did not 
get much response from anyone 
else. 
After a one year leave from the university, he thought about the idea again and decided to start a petition to have the Student Health Center stock the pills. Five hundred forty signatures, 10 percent ofthe university's under­graduates, were needed to place the referendum on the ballot. 
Saltzman said that he does not agree with those who think suicide is an insensitive way to deal with the issue. "Nuclear war would not only destroy civiliza­tion hut also our value system · our moral matrix," he said. "In this world, suicide would be con­sidered a horrible thing. In the world after a nuclear holocaust, it could be an alternative." 
Saltzman also disagrees with the idea that suicide is a fatalistic alternative to attempting to survive after a· nuclear blast. "Life would be over because society is gone. It's scary to think that we could not want to survive," he said. 
Saltzman stressed the impor­tance of educating students on the seriousness of nuclear war. 
"People get distraught at the mention of the word 'suicide' but don't get as distraught about nu­clear war, " Saltzman said. "Both are equally distressing and we're tring to get people to equate the two."

A fairy-tale show makes a not so fairy-tale profit 
In an explosion of light, sound, lasers and smoke, the kiddie show begins. Creatures who resemble Big Bird's friend from Sesame Street, Mr. Snuflle-Upugus, land on stage and dance around in a technopop version of E.xcaliber. More lasers, more smoke and one or two sundry detonations later, a sword is pulled from a stone by a blinded silhouette who later turns out to be the one, the only, Mr. No Drugs At My Show--Michael Jack­son. 
It's the first concert of the Jacksons' Victory Tour at Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium, and preteenage kids of all shades are dancing with their parents. White gloves bob up and down in agreement as Michael and his five brothers perform with 32 tons of sound-and­light equipment, and belt out a total of 16 songs--none of which is on the new but very mediocre album, 
Victory. 
It's a 90-minute show that costs S30. 

No doubt about it, these guys are gifted entertainers, but the greed and arrogance that has undermined the Jacksons' tour leave a bad taste in the mouths of the more than 3 S million people who bought Jackson's al­bum, Thriller. 
"What good does a drug­free, liquor-free, 1-brake-for-animals image do when the overriding message is, 'Give me your piggy bank'?" wrote national columnists Glen and Shearer. 

The charges against Mi· chad's Disneyland tour take aim primarily at a handful of Jackson promoters who realized that the fairy-tale show could make lots and lots of not so fairy-tale dollars. Prices for the concert were outrageously set at S30 by promoter Don King, one-time Muhammad Ali impresario. But before the first concert, King was dumped for Chuck Sullivan, a promoter from the football industry who had an even better idea for collecting money. 
Sullivan announced that control ofticket sales would be taken away from the local arenas and given to Sul­livan's office in New York. Prospective ticket buyers had to send in a $120 money order (for four tickets) to become eligible for a ticket lottery. People not selected at random wouldn't get their money back for several weeks. 
Sullivan also proposed that newspapers run, as a "public service," coupons which would be mailed with the money order in a standard No. I 0 envelope to tour headquarters. Jackson promoters maintained that this was the only way to guarantee fairness in ticket distribu­tion.

Officials at 23,000-seat Rupp Arena in lexington, Ky., weren't amused. On May 21, Michael's mother, Kat· herine, announced that the first concert would definitely be at Rupp Arena. The concert looked likely until Sullivan's lottery plan became a requirement in the concert contract. 
In no uncertain terms, arena president Tom Minter said that he didn't care if it was the incredible Michael jackson or the Southern Division Tractor Pull; no one except arena officials would handle ticket distribution. 
Other big-name arenas, including New Orlean's Su­perdome, Seattle's Kingdome, the los Angeles Forum and the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., fol­lowed suit. It looked for one shakey week this June that the jacksons' tour might not go anywhere. 
Sullivan called some ofhis contacts from football and quickly signed concerts in three football stadiums: Ar­rowhead Stadium, Texas Stadium and the Gator Bowl. 
In the meantime, a little girl named LadonnaJones of UIC TORY Dallas wrote a letter to Mi-· 
chael asking, "How could you, of all people, be so selfish?" The note bothered Jackson, and the day before the first concert, he an­nounced that he had "asked the promoter to end the mail-order system." And, he added, his share ofthe tour profits would go to charity. 
The curious announcement showed that Michael himself is probably not behind the greed and arrogance of the tour, but it also pointed out that as the main man of the show, his orders could have ruled all along. Jack­sons' promoters have soured the image ofthe show, and all the lasers, light and smoke in the world can't change the fact that this once happy tour ain't no ordinary fairy tale.

Reaction to the referendum by the students has been "mixed" ac­cording to Beth Grossman, student body president. "The stu­dent body has reservations about it, but it's all being taken fairly seriously." she said. 
Grossman said that the student government has not taken an official position on the referendum and is waiting for the results ofnext week's election. 
Dr. Sumner Hoffman, director of the Student Health Center, said he thought the petition "somewhat frivolous" at first and could not believe it. After thinking about the proposal for a while, however, Hof­fman said that he believes there is a reason to be concerned. "We at Brown should be taking a hard look at educating students about how to prevent it (nuclear war) from ever happening." 
Sumner also said, however, that 
he thinks the students have "an un­
realistic, no win attitude" which he 
believes is "unrealistic. In history, 
Civilizations have been nearly 
destroyed but were rebuilt by sur­
vivors, " he said. 
He added, however, that the "symbolism of the petition has been achieved. Students want answers and want to talk about it. We have scheduled forums." 
Sumner said that he "believes it is highly unlikely" the university's in­corporators would allow the health center to stock cyanide even if the referendum is passed. 
Saltzman said he believes the peti­tion has been "very successful. beyond my wildest dreams."

Prof lectures high schools by telephone 
By MIKE MILLEN 
StaffReporter 
Yesterday's lecture given to a group of Kansas high school stu· dents by Notre Dame's Robert Schuler was uncommon. However, it was not the physics lecture itself which made the class "unique in the country," but the fact that it was conducted by telephone, with Schuler never leaving the campus. 
Described as a "valuable program for high school students interested in advanced modern techniques in science," the class consisted of two parts. Last week, the 80 students scattered throughout 25 Kansas high schools were given a one hour lecture on radiation chemical studies. This week, the participants asked questions of Schuler during the 1 1/2 hour session. 
It's designed to "get the very best scientists to participate without having to travel," said John Eck of the Kansas State University physics department. The honors seminar se­ries, which Kansas State is sponsor­ing for seven different topics, is designed to give top students infor­mation on different areas ofscience. 
In his lecture, Schuler described the facilities and experiments using radiation methods to study chemical reactions in the Radiation Labora­tory. He said Notre Dame was selec­ted to participate because of its internationally known radiation center. 
After each class, students are re­quired to submit papers to Eck. Those who satisfy the requirements will be awarded two class credits at their high school. 
Schuler said "Kansas State has had this program for the last ten years," and he thinks the initiative to ex­pand it must be taken by universities around the country. Although he doubted the effectiveness for using the telephone to conduct a lecture on college level, Schuler seemed op­tomistic about the current high school program, saying "hopefully, it will be effective." 
SMC installs new lights on N. Road 
By KELLY O'NEIL 
News Staff 
lights are being installed on Saint Mary's North Road as part of a plan to relocate the security building closer to the College's main gate. This change will cause 
heavier  traffic  on  North  Road,  
thereby  increasing  its  lighting  
needs.  

The lights will cost approxi­mately S 1 0,000 to install, and, ac­cording to security, it is a convent project. The cost of in­stallation is greatly reduced be­cause the lights are not brand new, but were originally in the LeMans' parking lot. 
Eight lights were replaced in the parking lot, but only seven of these will be installed on North Road. The eighth light is reserved as a spare. 
Installation began, according to Dick Kenny,"approximately last Thursday" and will be "finished and functioning by the end of next week." The lights are high pressure sodium lights as are the new lights in the LeMans parking lot. 
Meg McGinity, a freshman at Saint Mary's, said "I think that the lights will promote an atmo­sphere ofsafety."

At first I thought it would not be necessary to write any type of article in regard to Presi­dent Reagan's stance on abortion. It is my per­ception that the N.D. campus in general realizes that the unborn child should have all the rights guaranteed in the Constitution to all other individuals, most importantly, the right

to life. We have witnessed a great deal of en­thusiasm for this view prior to and since Governor Cuomo's now famous speech here at Notre Dame. Due to the pro-life support on campus, and the recognition that Ronald Reagan "is one of the most committed, most outspoken pro-life presidents in history," I felt it was not necessary to overkill the subject. 
That was before Gary Wills' article ap­peared in The Obseroer on Sept. 28. Wills at­tempted to convince the readers that Reagan had made only a half-hearted attempt in his fight against abortion. This is simply not true, but rather than harping on Wills fallacies, I would like to point out the successes Reagan hru; made in protecting the lives of the unborn, and the possibilties for the future if he is given the opportunity to continue his fight against the injustices of abortion. 
Reagan's personal views on abortion have been explicity outlined in countless public forums. In fact, on the lOth anniversary ofSu­preme Court decision Roe vs. Wade, he pub­lished an article detailing his views ("Abortion and the Conscience of the Na­tion.") The President is against abortion in all cases except in the rare, but very real, circum­stances in which the mother's life would be endangered by carrying the pregnancy to term. Yes, this means he is against abortion in the case of incest and rape. His fundamental belief is that the unborn child, the human being, is guaranteed his right to life, and to claim special circumstances (i.e. "the mother does not want the child") does not change the basic fact that the child has these rights. In those unique and rare cases of pregnancy by rape or incest Reagan believes that we must be sensitive to the mothers difficult situation, but we must not destroy life in an attempt to rectify the already tragic situation. 
Reagan is very serious about his views on abortion and his importance to the Pro-Life movement is often understated. He consis­tently reminds people of his view, but to the dismay of many he is not widely quoted on this issue. In a presidential proclamation (Jan. 22, 1984) he publicly stated: "Since 1973, more than I 5 million unborn children have died in legalized abortions ... a tragedy of stunning dimensions that s1ands in sad con­trast to our belief that each life is sacred. lnese chidren .-.. will never laugh, never· sing, never experience the joy of human love; nor will they strive to heal sick, or feed the poor, or make peace among nations. Abortion has denied them the first and most basic ofhuman rights, and we are infinitely poorer for their loss." 
Reagan has taken many steps toward the ul­timate goal of outlawing this merciless na­tional disaster. First he supported the Hyde Amendment, the Smith/Denton Amendment and various other forms of legislation which prohibit the federal funding of abortion (except to save the life of the mother). In ad­dition, Reagan had funds cut off funds to or· ganizations "which preform or actively promote abortion in Foreign Countries." (For example the International Planned Paren­thood Federation, which promotes abortion · as "family planning" -no longer will receive S I 1 million Federal dollars it used to get.) 
In addition Reagan contacted many un­decided Senators when the Hatch/Eagleton constitutional amendment (which would overturn Supreme Court decisions) was up for debate. He did the same when Senator Helms was supporting legislation which would urge the Supreme Court to reexamine its decisions. Both times unfortunately the President lost his battle, but his did not prtvent him from succeeding in other ways. 
It was in 1983 when the Supreme Court reviewed (and reaffirmed) "Roe vs. Wade". This unfortunate decision was challenged strongly by Reagan's appointee to the Su­preme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor. During a second term there is the distinct possibility that Reagan will have the opportunity to ap· point several Supreme Court Justices. He has publicly stated and it is soundly reverberated in the Republican Party Platform that "we reaffirm our support for the appointment of judges ,at all levels of the judiciary who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life." This will be Reagan's greatest opportunity to come to the aide ofthe unborn. 
Concurrent with his strong beliefs about abortion President Reagan has come out strongly against denying regular  medical treatment to those chidren who are born severely handicapped. He issued an executive order which prohibited hospitals receiving federal funds from letting those children die. Discrimination is prohibited by law and detailed regulations were issued to protect these children's rights. The "Baby Doe" children, like the unborn children, need their rights protected in a more signficant way asccording to President Reagan. This is why he is supporting the Human Life Amendment to the Con.'ititution. Reagan believes that it must be spelled out in the law ofthe land that innocent children must be protected. He has made significant steps in that direction, and he will continue to given a second term.

A breath of fresh air

livens what otherwise promises to be a repetition of the rather drab exchanges of prior campaigns. 
As in the past, this year's debates will likely include much rhetoric about the wisdom, ex­perience, and competence of the two party leaders to deal effectively with near-term eco­nomic factors such as jobs, interest rates, taxes, inflation, and budget deficits. Vigorous charges and countercharges will be made about how serious our ecopomic problems are and about which party is most responsible. Neither candidate will dare suggest that the solution of these problens requires a funda­mental reappraisal ofthe United States' role in an increasingly interdependent global eco­nomy. 
Competitive exhortations will be heard about toughness towards the Soviet Union. While there are certainly significant differ­ences between the candidates concerning se­curity issues, both will vow to maintain a strong defense but to expedite arms control. Neither will discuss the need to reduce our unduly heavy reliance on the military element ofsecurity. Otller critical foreign policy issues will be carefully skirted and comments will be limited to general discussion of the nature of the problems and vague suggestions on how they might be resolved. All of this will be topped with emotional appeals to patriotism cast in the context ofthe United States against, not with, the rest ofthe world. 
Nor can we hope for much from the debate questioners. The questions posed to Reagan, Mondale, Bush, and Ferraro by media­oriented panelists will concentrate on the im­mediate and the near term. So, too will the debaters' answers. This is a natural conse­quence of the short-term emphasis of the United States' political system. Candidates 
concentrate on what may happen during the 
next four years. 
Wouldn't it be refreshing and illuminating if 
part of the debate were structured to compel 
we presidential candidates to look to the 
future? How would they adapt U.S. plicy to 
deal with the growing interdependence ofthe 
world? What should be done to regain an ac­
ceptable balance ofpayments, to make U.S. in­
dustry more competitive without resorting to 
practices damaging to the global economy? In 
the long term, how would they cope with 
structural unemployment, budget deficits, 
and other domestic economic issues stem­
ming from the evolution of the world's eco· 
nomy? 
What should be the role ofthe United States 
in the quest for secure peace with freedom 
and justice? What have the candidates learned 
about military intervention in Vietnam, 
Lebanon, Nicaragua, Grenada, and El Sal­
vador? How would they check and reverse the 
insane arms race? What approach would they 
use to lessen tensions between the United 
States and the Soviet Union and to begin to 
build a long-term, more stable relationship 
with our primary adversary? How would they 
utilize the United Nations and other interna­
tional organizations? 
An exchange of outlooks on such is~ues would help develop the long-range focus so lacking in the campaign rhetoric and in the deliberations of the administration and Congress. It would be educational for both candidates and voters and would give all ofus a better understanding of the United States' role in today's world. Armed with that, voters would be better able to choose candidates. 
The quest for the go;Us we seek · prosperity at home and a secure peace with freedom and justice in the world · will remain futile as long as one administration after another concen­trates on the confrontations of the day. More attention to the long view would help chart the course to progress. It would be a breath of fresh air.

An extinquished faith 
"Laws cannot rekindle an extinguished faith." The words are Alexis de Tocqueville's. They come to mind often in the current talk about religion and politics. Not that I think re­ligious faith has been extinguished · far from that. But I do not agree with those who see a great resurgence, a new vitality, in American

religion. Its vitality is suprisingly constant, as Seymour Martin Upset has noticed, through­out our history. 
This religious energy finds various chan­nels. In the past, it was put at the service of causes as different as nativism and abolition, Prohibition and city machine reform. 
At the time when Tocqueville travelled America, in the 1830's, we had a socially es­tablished religion, though not a politically es­tablished one. We were a Christian nation. There would have been no protest, then, at using the Lord's Prayer in schools, or nativity scenes on public property. The rights of non­Christian minorities were not so much denied as not even brought into view. Even some Christians were discriminated agaiast · e.g., Catholics. 
In general, that has been the pattern of our social establishment, though with diminishing force down through the years. It was unneces­sary to pass censorship laws in many places because the religious leaders could inhibit the distribution of material offensive to them by social pressures on their congregations. 
Tocqueville thought of religion as operat­ing primarily on women: Morals were their sphere. But because they controlled the raising and education of children, religion has already done its work in these pre-political stages. It did not have to proceed to overt legislation -the laity, formed by their educa­
tion, could be trusted to do that when it was 
called for. 
To some, this may seem a distinction with­
out a difference. Ifreligion has already shaped 
the minds ofpeople, what is to be gained from 
a kind of sudden and artificial restraint in the 
area ofovert electioneering? 
But electoral politics in America has its own 
mystique, for a very good reason. Foreigners 
could not understand the fuss Americans 
made over the break-in at a rival party's 
headquarters in 1972, and the efforts of the 
White House to cover up its involvement in 
this "third-rate burglary attempt." It seemed a 
petty crime in itself· and was. 
Americans settle one ofthe touchiest points 
of any political regime · succession · by the 
electoral process. It decides legitimacy 1n of· 
fice. That is why it must emphasize procedural 
niceties, the observance of proper forms. Un­
less the process has not been tampered with, 
we do not have a legitimate officer. 
Our electoral process, as Madison pointed 
our in Federalist No. 1 0, resembles an arbitra­
tion on points of equity. It must retire, some­
what, from the ordinary give-and-take of 
social argument and pressure, a thing sym­
bolized by the secrecy of balloting and the 
cordoning-off ofcampaigners from the imme­
diate vicinity of the voter. 
On certain issues -many of them sexual · one form of American religion has lost its old pre-political dominance. If it had not, we would not have a divorced man in the White House. Nudity in films is an everyday occur­rence, even in the White House. Even the first lady says she might favor abortion in cases of rape. Male-female dormitories are the norm, even on some religious campuses. The tooth· paste, as it were, is 0ut of the tube. 
Religion has lost its pre-political dominance over many of these topics. So a few preachers are attempting to remedy the matter by direct action in elections. But "laws cannot rekindle an extinguished faith."

U.S. intelligence finds suspects in bombings 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -U.S. intelligence belieVt:l> it has itkntified the terror­ists behind the fatal Sept. 20 bom­bing ofthe American embassy annex in east Beirut, but lacks precise in­formation about their location and suspected ties to Iran, administra­tion and congressional officials said yesterday. 
Asenior Reagan administration of­ficial, who insisted on anonymity, I also said the possibility of military i retaliation against those responsible for the attack has been discussed at the White House, but has met resis­

' 
7 behind the suicide bombing attack, although it stiU is "not 100 percent 7 sure." The group is described as one 
of a number that use the name Jihad Islami, or Islamic Holy War. 
The official did not give the group's suspected headquarters and said it may move frequently. He said the United States would also have to consider the difficulty ofstriking the suspected terrorists without inflict­ing heavy civilian casualties. 
Following last October's bombing of the U.S. marine barracks in Beirut, President Reagan declared that per­petrators of the attack "must be dealt justice," but the United States never launched a retaliatory strike. 
Since then, the administration has consistently refused to say publicly what, if anything, it would do if a group behind an attack could be pin­pointed, and spokesmen again refused to discuss such possibilities yesterday. 
In April, Reagan signed a secret policy directive authorizing preemptive strikes and reprisal raids against terrorists, according to ad­ministration officials. But the directive does not mean that a retaliatory strike must follow an at­tack. 
After the latest . bombing that killed 14 people, including two Americans, Democratic presidential nominee Walter F. mondale said that "if the perpetrators of this deed can be identified," he would back 
Reagan  in  "appropriate  counter­ 
measures."  
A  senior  administration  official  

said that the U.S. intelligence com­munity also believes that the terror­ist group is aided by Iran and Syria, two anti-U.S. governments in the Middle East. But he said their degree of control over the group is not clear. 
In a report Wednesday, the House Intelligence Committee said U.S. in­telligence has information that "implicates a particular terrorist group as responsible for the bom­bing attack" and that it "may have received support from Iran and may be one of several organizations which use the name Islamic Jihad." 
In an interview with the New York Times published yesterdaay, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said his government had no knowledge of the shadowy Islamic Jihad and does not support it.

Hurricane Warning: 
ND Stadium, but lrist 
By lARRY BURKE 
Sports Writer 
lhe date wa'i Saturday, November 13, 1982. The Fighting Irish of Notre Dame were preparing to square off against the Penn State Nittany Lions in front ofa sellout crowd in Notre Dame Stadium. Notre Dame was fresh off an upset ofthe then-No. I Pitt Panthers, and the Irish knew that a victory over Penn State would put them back in thick ofthe race for a major bowl berth. 
That game, though it was two years ago, has special sig­nificance in light of this Satur<Jay's clash between Notre Dame and Miami. Back in '82, the Nittany Lions, who stood at 8·1, were ranked fifth in the nation. The Irish, then 6-1· 1, were ranked 13th nationally. 
When the Hurricanes of Miami visit the Irish this Saturday, it will mark the first time in nearly two years that two top-twenty teams will do battle in Notre Dame Stadium. And, coinciden­tally, the Irish find themselves in much the same situation that they were in two seasons ago when the Nittany Lions came to town · ifthey are to retain any hope of contending for a national championship, this is one game they must win. 
On the other side of the field, the Hurricanes need a victory just as badly. The defending national champions are 4-2 this season with a schedule that ranks among the country's most difficult. Having already suffered defeats at the hands of Michigan ( 22-14) and Florida St. ( 38·3 ), Miami still. must face Pittsburgh, Maryland, and Boston College this season. 
Under first-year coach Jimmy Johnson, the Hurricanes are ranked 14th in the nation on the strength ofwins over Auburn, Florida, Purdue, and Rice. If Miami can add the 16th-ranked Irish to their list ofvictories, it will mark their first-ever win in Notre Dame Stadium. 
Although Johnson is making his first coaching appearence in Notre Dame Stadium, he is no stranger to major college football. He previously directed Oklahoma State to a 30-25-1 record in five years as head coach, taking the Cowboys to two bowl games during that span. 
Because both teams need a victory on Saturday to improve their national ranking, and because both squads have an abundance oftalent, the game figures to be a war. The difference could be the one extra motivational factor on Notre Dame's side · the desire to avenge the 20-0 thrashing which the Irish suffered at the hands of Miami in front ofa national television audience last season. 
Irish coach Gerry Faust is hoping that the desire for revenge against Miami will inspire his troops to fare better than they did two years ago against Penn State in that last big game in Notre

Alonzo Highsmith 
Miami's sophomore leads Hurricane rushing attack, provides another threat besides Kosar's passing 
ByJOHN BEAULIEU 
Associate Sports Editor 
Miami Hurricane 
Two years ago Alonzo Highsmith was on top of the world, having just earned prep all­American honors as a defensive end out of Columbus High in Miami. Now the calendar has changed, but Highsmith remains on top · only now, as the University of Miami's star fullback. 
Highsmith, a 6-1, 230-pound sophomore 
business major, made the change from defensive 
end to fullback at the beginning ofhis UM 
career, and everyone is glad the change was 
made · well, maybe not UM opponents. 
Through the first six games ofthe Hurricanes 
tough schedule, Highsmith has emerged as a 
force to be teckoned with. He has carried the 
ball 71 times for 488 yards ( 6. 9 yards per carry 
average) and three touchdowns. 
During Miami's opening game against Auburn in the Kickoff Classic at the New Jersey Meadowlands, everyone expected Bo Jackson to assert himself with his running game. Instead, Highsmith stunned his audience with an electrifying 140 yards on 22 carries. In Miami's third game of the season against Michigan, a 2 2-14 defeat, Highsmith continued to pile up yards with 126 yards on 16 carries. 
Highsmith is soft-spoken when it comes to his individual statistics, but he is quick to give credit where and when it is due. "The offensive line has been doing a great job all year long blocking for me," Highsmith says. "They are the ones who have helped my success the most this year. The offensive line and the people sur­rounding me like Eddie Brown, Bernie Kosar, and Stanley Shakespeare · they've been great. 
"Whether I run the ball one, five or 20 times, it doesn't matter to me as long as I help contrib­ute to the team. Even though the offense is pass-oriented, I still like to go out and catch the ball. I enjoy blocking also, so I try to do the best I can out there when l'm not runnmg the ball. · 

As far as the running aspect of his game is concerned, Highsmith is doing quite well, to say the least. But he isn't bad at the receiving end, either. His 16 receptions is the fourth-best total on a team that features the likes of Brown, Shakespeare and Willie Smith. 
Highsmith burst onto the scene in Miami during last years thrilling 3 1-30 victory over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. He rushed for SO yards on seven carries to lead the Hurricane's ground game. He also notched his first collegiate touchdown in the thirdquarter of that game. This spring he secured his spot as the Hur­ricanes No. 1 fullback and he's been turning heads ever since. 
"Probably my best asset as a running back is my speed," Highsmith says with a look of deep concentration. "Although I'm not a super-fast running back, I do have pretty good speed and that helps me a lot." 
Against Notre Dame on Saturday, Highsmith will have to kick it in high-gear if the Hurricanes hope to come out of South Bend with a victory. He'll need to keep the ground game going when Kosar and Company take breathers from passing against an inexperienced Fighting Irish second­ary. "I believe the key to the Notre Dame game will be to execute well and to perform with a minimal amount of mistakes on the field," Highsmith says. 
As long as Highsmith remains healthy, the Hurricanes' running game will prosper, and his statistics will blossom. It is a deva'itating mix . the passing game of Kosar and the running game of Highsmith. Yet, Highsmith says that he's not very big on statistics. ''I'll look at my stats but I don't worry too much about them," he says. "What matters is if we can put the victories in the win column." 
There's little doubt about it. Alonzo Highsmith has helped put four victories in Miami's win column. And there will be many more to come.

Dame Stadium, when the Nittany Lions downed the Irish 24-14. 
Miami's offense vs. Notre Dame's defense: 
All ofNotre Dame's opponents so far this season have tried to 
heat the Irish via the passing game, and the Hurricanes figure to 
be no exception. The major difference is that Miami throws the 
hall better than any team Notre Dame has seen so far this season. 
Sophomore quarterback Bernie Kosar has connected on 113 of 189 passes this season, picking up 1,573 yards and eight touchdowns in the process, and is coming off the best performance ofhis career, a 25-of-~7. 368-yard, three· touchdown day against Rice last week. The Irish are well aware of Kosar's game-breaking potential after last year's game in Miami. 
"Kosar caused us problems a year ago," says Faust, "and he's obviously come a long way since that time. He's a big, rangy kid who sees the field well and has that innate sense to know where to go with the ball. He's going to make your linebackers work because he throws so many of the middle-distance passes." 
Top receivers for the Hurricanes are senior split ends Eddie Brown ( 6-0, 185 pounds) and Stanley Shakespeare ( 6-0, 179). Brown has 25 catches for 440 yards and four touchdowns, while Shakespeare has 22 receptions for 333 yards and three touchdowns. Tight end Willie Smith ( 6-2, 212) has hauled in 22 passes for 329 yards and tied the school record for receptions by hauling in 11 passes against Florida earlier this year. 
The Hurricanes can move the ball on the ground, as well. Sophomore Alonzo Highsmith has been Miami's most produc­tive rusher, with 71 carries for 488 yards and three touchdown;; Halfback Darryl Oliver, a S-11, 190-pound freshman, has rushed 54 times for 233 yards and two touchdowns. The Hurricane running backs have also proved that they can catch the ball, as Highsmith and Oliver have combined to haul in 25 aerials for 254 yards. 
"Everybody knows Miami and Kosar can throw," says Faust, "but the improvement oftheir running game may be the most impressive aspect of this team. They've got their entire offensive line back, and their running is more of an integral part of their offense." 
Miami's offensive line, the self-proclaimed "Blitzbusters," consists offour seniors and a sophomore, and ha'i an average size of6-3, 252 pounds. Left tackle Paul Bertucelli, center Ian Sinclair, right guard Alvin Ward, and right tackle Dave Heffernan are all returning starters from the '83 national championship team, while senior left guard Mike Moore is the only newcomer. 
Miami's offense has been its own worst enemy so far this season, as Kosar has thrown 10 interceptions and the Hur­ricanes have fumbled the hall 13 times, losing six. Penalties have also hurt Miami · they have beer:t whistled 49 times this year for 395 yards. 
This is an offense that has not been as productive as it can be, mainly because the pass protection has not been up to par. Kosar has been sacked 16 times this season, which has toned down the Hurricanes' passing statistics a bit. Nonetheless, Miami's aerial attack ranks sixth in the nation at 282.3 yards per game. IfKosar gets solid pass protection, then the Hurricanes offense could put some big numbers up on the board just as they did against Rice last Saturday, despite bad weather conditions. 
"I think the fact that Bernie Kosar was able to set a single­game passing mark in the rain is a tribute to our effort as an offensive unit," saysJohnson. "The line did a remarkable job, especially since we had Dave Heffernan playing out of position (center) and we were starting a guy (sophomore tackle Gregg Rakoczy) for the first time. We certainly took control ofthe Rice game from the very start. We also did not put all the pressure on the quarterback to win the game. We established the running game early and made things easier on ourselves." 
The Irish will be trying to stop Miami with a defense that has been severely hampered by injuries. Notre Dame lost inside linebacker Tony Furjanic for six weeks when he injured knee ligaments against Missouri. Furjanic had been a defensive leader and the team's top tackler so far this season. John McCabe, a 6-3, 228-pound junior, will start in Furjanic's place against the Hurricanes. 
Injuries have hit the defensive line the hardest, with nose tackle Eric Dorsey (ankle) listed as doubtful for Saturday, and right tackle Greg Dingens (shoulder) and nose tackle Mike Griffin (knee) also hampered. Dingens and Griffin are both probable for the Miami game, but reserve left tackle Byron Spruell (knee) is doubtful. Reserve nose tackle Mike Kiernan, a 6-2, 248-pound junior, will most likely see some action agaist Miami after handling the nose-tackle spot for most of the second half against Missouri. 
"We're banged up," says Faust, "and it seems like we lose someone new with something serious every week. But the people we've thrown in there have played their hearts out, the Mike Kiernans and the John McCabes. We just have to keep plugging along and hope we don't get any more nicked up than we are already." 
The Irish will need to mount a strong pass rush, with senior left tackle Mike Gann (five sacks this season) leading the way, in order to take the pressure off their defensive backs. · 
Notre Dan1e's offense vs. Miami's defense: 
Irish quarterhack Steve Beuerlein has some impressive stats of his own, connecting on 51 of 77 passes for 7 S 3 yards and four touchdowns this season. Like Kosar, Beuerlein is coming off his most productive game ever, having completed 16 of 25 passes for 256 yards against the Tigers. That performance helped move the Irish sophomore into seventh place in the NCAA quarter­back efficiency standings. 
"Steve ha'i gotten a little bit better every week out," says Faust. "We'll take whatever a defense will give us, and so far this year we've had more opportunities to throw the ball than we 
have in the past."

ears, two ranked teams will play in must stop Kosar to stay ranked 
Notre Dame's top receiver is junior tight end Mark Bavaro,  
who has 14 catches for 185 yards. Beuerlein's other targets  
include junior flanker Milt Jackson ( 11 receptions for 1 S 1 yards  
and two touchdowns) and freshman split end Tim Brown ( 1 0  
catches for 118 yards). Sophomore split end Alvin Miller will be  
out for four more weeks with knee ligament damage suffered  
against Michigan State, but senior split end joe Howard is ready  
to return at full strength from a hamstring injury.  
Notre Dame's passing success this season has been due in part  
to opposing teams' concern with stopping the potent Irish  
running game ­especially Allen Pinkett. The junior tailback has  
been drawing plenty of attention this year, but has still managed  
to score seven touchdowns. He has yet to top the 70-yard mark  
in a game this season, however.  
"Every defense we have seen has been stacked with seven or·  
eight people on the line to stop Pinkett," says Faust_ "The other  
teams have been saying, 'We're not going to let Pinkett get 200  
yards and beat us by himself.' Because of that, we're throwing  
the ball a lot more than people probably expected. But our  
offensive line also has to start coming off the ball better. We're  
just not opening the holes inside, and we should have the  
personnel to do that."  
In addition to Pinkett, the Irish will be trying to spring  
sophomore tailback Alonzo Jefferson, who has 2S carries for 86  
yards and two touchdowns this season. Fullbacks Mark Brooks  
( 20 carries for 85 yards and two touchdowns) and Chris Smith ·  
( 1 5 carries for 44 yards) provide the Irish with powerful  
blockers and short-yardage runners. Although Notre Dame's  
running game has not been that productive this year, Faust  
knows that Saturday's game may not be won by the pass alone.  
"It's the same way as the Missouri game," says Faust.  
"Everyone thought the score would be 40-35, but even with all  
the yardage gained by both teams, the game was won on  
defense. This week could be the same way. Everyone thinks you'll see both teams throw the ball40 times, but it might be a  Allen Pinkett  
Pinkett or a Highsmith who makes the difference." Turnovers have been the biggest enemy of the Notre Dame  ND tailback  
offense in its first four games. Beuerlein has thrown six  
interceptions this season, and the Irish have fumbled nine times,  
losing five. The Irish have frequently appeared difficult to stop  
on offense · when they can avoid self-destructing.  
Miami's defense lost many ofits big names to graduation, but  
still maintains its agressive style of play. On the defensive line,  
end julio Cortes, a 6-1, 215-pound senior, and tackle Kevin  
Fagan, a 6-3, 260-pound junior, figure to put some heat on  
Beuerlein. Notre Dame's offensive line will suffer ifLarry  
Williams (questionable with a knee injury) is unable to play.  
Two other key players in the Hurricane defense are roverback  
Ken Calhoun and cornerback Reggie Sutton. Sutton, Irish fans  
may remember, blocked two Irish field goal attempts in last  
year's game.  
The keys to the game:  
There are several factors which make this Saturday's game  
different from any other that the Irish have played this season.  
The most obvious is that Miami is far more talented than any of  
Notre Dame's previous opponents, and that fact alone is enough  
to turn this game into a war. But the intangible factors present  
could have a substantial effect on the outcome ofthis contest.  
The most important intangible factor is that these two teams  
do not like each other. The Hurricanes love beating Notre  
Dame, and ifthey can embarass the Irish as they did last season,  
then that's all the better. They would like nothing more than to  
pull offa repeat of last year's game, right here in Notre Dame  
Stadium. c ontinued from page 9  
The Irish have been looking forward to this game for quite  
some time, because it provides them with the long-awaited  
opportunity for revenge. In addition to their own motivation,  
the Notre Dame players will have a large, boisterous crowd  
supporting them · an element which just might turn the game in  
their favor. fo r the young quarterback.  
Motivation may just be Notre Dame's biggest weapon because  
injuries will make it difficult to contend with a powerful Miami  
team. Ifthe Irish can motivate themselves to a cqnsistent, higher  
level ofperformance and draw some energy off the crowd, then  
they can gain the upper hand.  
The key for Notre Dame will be to establish the momentum in  
the early going, and play consistent, agressive, errorless football h ave made good plays."  
from then on. Ifthey can accomplish this, they may just have  
their revenge.

their minds on what they were doing," he said. 
The strategy may have worked last year, but many of the Irish players seem determined to make the Hurricanes eat their words on Saturday. "The best thing about the sport of football is that you can pay somebody back for something they do to you," says tailback Allen Pinken. "Football gives you that chance. Our enthusiasm is high, especially after the humiliation. They made a program known as a dynasty look like the Little Sisters of the Poor." 
"We remember getting our faces rubbed in the dirt last year," says split end joe Howard. "We remember hearing them say how we looked scared and how they bad­mouthed us after the game. That gives us more incentive to know we have to go out and play them again." 
JoeJohnson says the game is probably one of the most important ofhis career. As a senior he has seen the good and the bad, but he sees this game as a key to the rest of 1984. 
"This game is probably the biggest game of the year in being asked to throw the football more often. With the Irish running game having little success through the first four weeks of this season, Hudson has been opening up the offense more which means more passing attempts 
Beuerlein has enjoyed success throwing the football, even though two of the top receivers for the Irish have been out with injuries for the past two games. "I feel a lot better throwing the ball when it's to people like the receivers we have on this team. Even the younger players who have been filling in because of the injuries

terms ofhaving to prove ourselves," he says, "but, more 
importantly, we have to prove to ourselves that we are a 
good football team." 
"Everyone has a lot of pride and we certainly want to show that we're more capable than we showed last year," adds Scannell. 
Rivalries always stir enthusiasm, and Howard, a senior like johnson, finds that the Miami game is one which has great significance. "I've been associated with this particular game for four years," he explains, "and ifthere's really any game I want to play in, it's Miami. lbe game with USC also means a lot personally, but, right now, my mind is on Miami." 
When the defending national champions take the field, they will bring with them their same balanced attack, and, no doubt, their same intimidating tactics will come as well. But what the Irish hope to prove is that they are a much better team than the one the Hurricanes blew apart last season.

the time this season, Beuerlein has been protected by 
the offensive front five like a fragile commodity. "I've 
had plenty oftime to set up and throw most ofthe 
time," Beuerlein says. "The offensive line takes a lot of 
pride in that and I appreciate it an awful lot." 
Even though the 6-3, 203-pounder has shown the talent for picking out secondary receivers and possesses a precise throwing arm, he still must overcome his relative inexperience. "Steve is still a young player, and he still is making some mistakes," Hudson points out. "He forces the ball sometimes when he shouldn't, just like all quarterbacks who have a lot ofconfidence, and he throws some interceptions because of that. Even though he has played well, Steve has yet to be in a 'pressure cooker' where he has to win, but that will come up eventually." 
Ifnone ofthe Irish games yet have fit that description, Saturday's matchup will certainly be the first one. "There's no doubt in my mind that we will be fired up for the game," says Beuerlein. "After what they did to us last year, we definitely owe them one." 
The Notre Dame field general has similar thoughts about the prospect for a good season. "We've got the talent, the coaches and the system to do really well this year. I've been confident all year. Each game I'm learning more things about reading defenses and about our own players. The offense has been doing better lately. The times when our offense has been most effective is when we throw the ball on first and second down. That, in turn, opens up holes for the running game. We had things rolling against Missouri, but the coaches started to get conservative. We have to try to continue to keep the defense off-balance." 
For only being a sophomore, Beuerlein has performed like a seasoned veteran in the crucial situations in the first four games. The Miami contest will be a good time to measure his performance under fire, and Bernie Kosar will be the yardstick against which his ability will be gauged.

''The Wild Life:" a waste of time and money 
by Shelli Camfield

efore you read this review, ask yourself the following ques­tions. Please he honest --this is for your own good. 
1. 
Do you have an LQ. that is the equivalent of Cool whip? Do you, for any reason whatsoever, have less than 50 functioning braincells? 

2. 
Are you easily amused? That is, do you get a big kick out ofanyth­ing that insults your intelligence? 

3. 
Do you have a date coming up with a person who, for some reason, vou are determined to bore to



death and impress upon that you 
are an ignorant, tasteless clod? 
Ifyou have answered "yes" to any of the above, have I got a movie for you! lr's called "The Wild Life," and it is brought to you from the same people who gave us "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." 
Don't be misled. True, both movies are lacking in plot, fairly tasteless, and typical ofteeney-bop sex comedies (although "The Wild Life" has little in the way ofsex). Somehow, "Fast Times" managed to pull it off. It was easy to follow, fast-moving, and fairly humorous. 
On the other hand, "The Wild 
Life" never gets off the ground. It is 
slow-moving, unorganized, and 
brainless. Furthermore, you won't 
exactly find yourselfon the floor in 
front ofyour seat, suffering with 
uncontrollable paroxysms of 
laughter. You may wind up on the 
tloor,alright --but just make sure 
someone wakes you up when the 
movie is over. 
As for the plot --well, there is none. Or rather, there are several-­all irrelevant, all meaningless.The central plot seems to revolve around our main man, played by Christopher Penn-· incidentally, the brother ofSean Penn of"Fast Times" fame. 
Naturally, Penn plays the same slow boneheaded character that big brother played. The only difference is that he sports short hair, a flowered Hawaiian shirt under his wrestling uniform, and instead of dubbing everything with "Awwwe­some!" he inflicts his philosophy of "It's casual" upon every dis­crepancy he encounters. (My best guess is that it's the only three­syllable word he knows.) His main thing seems to be his attempts to win the heart ofhis former girlfrknd, Eileen (Jenny Wright) --a salesgirl at "Fashion Dynasty" --and getting his first apartment with his best buddy, a red-headed, clean-cut guy who looks like Little Opie grown up. 
There are a few subplots. There is a 13-year-old counter-culture rebel (played by llan Mitchel-Smith) who is hung up on Viet Nam and his mystery "dream girl" at the local howling alley. We are also sub­jected to the heartbreak of Penn's roomy, whose donut-shop girlfriend (Lea Thompson) is having a torrid affair with a young, gor­geous, married cop. Finally, there is spiky-haired Eileen, who is preoc· cupied with fighting off the ardent Penn and the advances of her manager ·· another funky flamer donning round specs, boxy checkerboard-like clothing, and mega-gelled bulletproofhair. In spite ofit all, the whole mess is J slow-moving and stupid. j 
So, you ask, why the title? The j best answer I can come up with, besides the fact that "wild life" refers to what said apartment har­bors after slob and party-animal Penn moves in, is the incredible party that serves as the culmination of the whole shebang. It is, after all, the best scene in the movie, though it hits short ofthe drunken oblivion of Delta Frat in that comedy classic I need not mention. 
Still, it is wild. Where else can you see Penn and his cement­headed wrestling team smash through the wall ofthe neighboring apartment in order to create a hig· ger party room --with their beads ? Wake up, audience. The party scene --as well as the aftermath -· is the most exciting scene in this movie. 
Overall, "The Wild We " isn't the life. It is wildly slow, wildly predic­table, and wildly meaningless. Save your money.

Irreconcilable inconsistencies spoil this film 
by Don Seymour 
features staff writer 
A new movie that opened at the .l"l.scottsdale Mall last weekend, Irreconcilable Differences, suffers from a lack ofconsistency. From its advertising, I got the impression that it was going to be a cutesy comedy --a nine-year-old girl divorcing her parents. The first scenes confirm this view: a lawyer cautioning his client on the finality ofdivorce only to cut to the client ­nine-year-old Casey Brodsky, played by Drew Barrymoore ofE.T. fame; then, outside a crowded courthouse, Casey citing to the press that she and her parents have irreconcilable differences, which she mispronounces, being only nine years old. However, inside the courtroom, as each member of the family testifies, a series offlashbacks reveals the rather grim drama ofthe Brodskys' life. 
Albert Brodsky, played by Ryan O'Neal, owner ofa PhD in film, is hitchhiking across the country to a job at UClA. Caught in a rainstorm in Indiana, he predictably finagles a ride with a hesitant Lucy Van Pat­ten, played by Shelly Long of Cheers, who is driving her fiance's car out to San Diego where they'll marry. Her intended, a navy macho man, has made cassettes to guide her through every state following a 
very precise plan wh1ch he's mapped out. The tapes supply some ofthe movie's best humor. Along the way, we discover that Lucy is an aspiring children's writer. Of course, she and Brodsky fall in love, marry, and have a daughter: Casey. 
Brodsky, being a prominent film professor and critic, is invited one night to a screening ofa producer's new movie. Badgered by the producer for his opinion, Albert points out the flaws, and is offered a 
job fixing them. Lucy, horrified by the lifestyles ofthe Hollywood crowd, cautions him: "I don't want to become like these people." but Albert takes the job. 
What unfolds next is a drama of people who should never have had a child, ofpeople who typify the Hollywood nightmare -letting the excesses ofsuccess consume them. Brodsky is askedd to write and direct an original project. He gets Lucy to help him write it and the picture becomes a smash. 
Gradually, we sense an uneasi­ness in Lucy about Albert's fame. And poor Casey is largely ignored. Together, Lucy and Albert write a second film, but Albert falls in love with the leading lady and kicks both Lucy and Casey out ofthe house. 
The second film becomes a

~mash and pushes Albert over the brink. He buys a huge mansion and caters to his starlet's every whim, including production ofa huge musical ripoff ofGone wtth the Wind. Lucy, on the other hand, falls into a deep emotional rut. During this time, Casey is shuttled back and forth like a toy, used as a weapon to obtain child support or revenge. One ofthe most poignant and definitely the saddest moment of the film comes after Albert's big­budget musical flops and his starlet abandons him. Bankrupt, he lives in a rundown hotel. On one visit, he and Casey have an argument. She defiantly states that he can't tell her what to do, and he retorts that he can because he's her father. She replies, "No you're not, you don't pay child support any-more." 
Lucy eventually returns to life by writing a bestselling novel based on her relationship with Albert. Despite her aversion to Hollywood people at the start ot the him, she becomes a conceited, artificial prima donna. The height ofher egoism is perfectly demonstrated when, upon finding out her book hit number one on the bestseller list, she calls her attendants and servants in for the big announce­ment and they react awkwardly, forcing smiles and words ofpraise. 
By this time, the film has made its point about the way in which egoism destroys deep personal relationships by ignoring responsi­bility and compassion. The problem with the film lies in its inability to decide what kind offilm it wants to be. Starting as a breezy comedy, it becomes a searing indictment of the way in which Americans ap­proach marriage and child rearing, only to end as a tearjerker with Barrymoore making an obvious, moralistic speech to the courtroom. 
The film does work to a degree. 
At the beginning, I sided with the 
parents, dismissing the kid as a rich 
l'he pertormances in the movie are average. O'Neal plays a charac­ter similar to many other characters he's played. Long does a fine job despite the inexplicable contradic­tions written into her character. 
spoiled brat, but by the end ofthe 
film, I was so angry with Lucy and 
Albert that I wanted Casey to win 
some greater vindication than just 
living with the maids' family, the 
only people who ever really cared 
for her. Barrymoore suffers from cute child syndrome. She was great playing a little sister inE. T., but when called upon to do any substantial acting, she merely recites the lines with 
cliched emotion. 
lrreconcileable Differences looks like it could have been a promising comedy, but as a drama, it falls short of the catharsis it could reach. The whole mess winds up mostly depressing. I'd wait for this one to come to cable.

Not a perfect roommate 
by Lisa Visingardi 
features staff writer 
"zelda?Zelda Castolanavich?" "Hi! You must be my roommate," she replied. 
My heart moved six inches closer to my throat as I stared at the per­son I would be living with during my freshman year at college. It took a few moments, but I pulled myself together. My mother's words echoed through my head: "You can't judge a book by its cover." 
It's been six weeks since that first day ofintroductions. With the passing ofeach week I come closer and closer to being committed to Bellvue. I never thought that rooming with someone I didn't know could affect my lifestyle so immensely. But it has! 
To know Zelda is to know my problems. She remind'i me ofa type ofperson depicted in movies and magazines. Living with her wouldn't be so bad ifshe didn't take every­thing to such extremes. For exam­ple, she loves Michael jackson: Michael jackson music; Michael jackson clothes; Michael jackson dancing; Michael jackson every­thing. To top it off, she has turned our room into a Michael jackson museum! (Mr. jackson -"Here is your life.") Morning, noon, and night, it's MJ time with Zelda. 
On a typical day, which is every day ofthe week, Zelda gets up at 
6:00 a.m. She showers and washes her hair. By 6:37 she's back in the room with her MJ albums on the stereo. Go MJ! Sing it Zelda!! As she sings, she goes through the motions ofblow drying her hair. 
Finding it impossible to sleep any longer, I drag myselfout ofbed at 
7:05. After I have showered, I go back to the room to do my hair. By 
this time, roomie has full control of 
the mirror. Until 8:30 she puts on 
her make-up and styles her aero­
dynamically designed hair. IfI want 
to be on time for my 9:05 class, I 
have to get ready in the bathroom. 
"Ibe steam from the showers does 
wonders on freshly curled hair! 
Upon returning from my morning classes, I find roomie lying on her bed watching her favorite soap operas. Because ofthe little amount ofsleep I get at night, I try to take a nap. This is extremely difficult to do when my roommate keeps com­menting on every scene that flashes across the television screen. Realiz­ing that I'm fighting a losing battle, I decide to catch up on writing the letters I owe to relatives and friends. 
When 1 :05 comes along, my heart begins to pound within my chest. Zelda has a 1:1 5 class, which means that I will get to take a nap for one hour! The minute she leaves, my head hits the pillow and I drift into a deep sleep within five minutes. At 2: 1 5, roomie returns to the room to begin her homework. 
During the late afternoon and early evening while Zelda is finish­ing her homework, I'm at my classes, followed by crew practice. ~'hen I return to the hall at 8:30 to begin my studying, roomie has her friends in for socializing. Whether she's entertaining or not, she goes to bed precisely at 10:30. I never finish my studies before 1 :00! Con­sequently, I must remove myself to the study lounge located four floors down in the basement. 
As I sit here at my favorite table, I reflect upon how Zelda has changed my lifestyle. I used to sleep in until noon, but now I'm up before the birds! I used to enjoy listening to Michael jackson, but now I find it torture! I used to hate going to class, but now I look for­ward to it! Yes, living with Zelda is an experience which has greatly affected my life. 
Despite all of the problems, there are a few good things that have resulted from this living arrange­ment. For example, I have made several new friends who are always willing to offer their rooms as places ofrefuge. Who knows, ifI'm not committed by Christmas, I may get a new roommate!

St. Francis, IUPU-Ft. Wayne 
Saint Mary's tennis team wins two 
By PAM CUSICK 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's tennis team once again proved its worth in yesterday's dual matches against St. Francis and Indiana University/Purdue Univer­sity at Fort Wayne with 9-0, 8-l vic­tories, respectively. These two wins should serve to increase the players' level of confidence going into the Irish Invitational this weekend at Notre Dame. 
Against St. Francis, senior Debbie Laverie led the Belles at number-one singles, beating Tracy Johnson, 6-3, 6-4, while Mary Carol Hall, a sopho­more, defeated Pam Bergeron in their number-two match, 6-2, 6-1. Number-three singles player Caroline Zern shut out Darleen Daly, 6-0, 6-0, and freshman Susie Craig, at the number-four spot, defeated Amy Koomler, 6-0,6-2. 
Junior Kim Kaegi beat Jill Arnold, 6-3, 6-2, at number-five singles, and 
Kim  Drahota  defeated  Mary  
Zehringer, 6-3, 6 -1.  
The  Belles  continued  their  

domination in doubles competition as Laverie and senior Renee Yung came back to win against the first doubles team of Johnson and Ber­geron, 1-6, 6-1, 6-3. Number-two doubles partners Kate McDevitt and Karie Casey overcame Darleen Daley and Amy Koomler by 7-6, 6-2 scores, while Craig and Kaegi at number-three easily topped Arnold and Zehringer, 6-1, 6-2. 
In the IUPU-Ft. Wayne match, Laverie again led Saint Mary's from her number-one singles position, winning, 6-2,6-2, against Bab Spidel. Meanwhile, Hall dominated Marla Christen, 6·1, 6-2, at number-two, as Zern was easily putting Reth Clark away at number-three, 6-0, 6-2. 
Craig beat Manju Usman, 6-0, 6-1, at number-four and Yung was able to come out of a close two-set battle at number-five with a 7-5, 6-4 victory. Kaegi's opponent, Sara Yaggy, took her to three sets before she came away with a 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 win at number-six. 
In doubles competition, Laveric and Hall defeated the number-one

team ofSpidel and Christen, 6-3,6-2, as Yung and Zern bettered Clark and Usman, the number-two team, 6-0, 6-1. The number-three pair of Casey and McDevitt lost to Hines and Yaggy, 6-1, 6-2, in the Belles' only setback ofthe day. 
Last weekend, in their own Saint Mary's College Invitational, the Belles played host to a bevy oftalent and placed fifth overall with a 31­point performance. 
Toledo placed first in the invita­tional in front of Marquette and Ball State, with the three scoring 56, 40 and 38, respectively. 
"The concentration and mental effort of the doubles teams were the best performances we've seen in the last two or three years," said Saint Mary's coach John Killeen of his team's play in the invitational. Kil­leen added that the doubles teams also won "proportionately more matches than did the singles" by 
being aggressive and by attacking 
their opponents. 
The Saint Mary's coach also com­
mented that Yung, who reached the 
finals in both her number-five 
singles position and at number-two 
doubles teaming with Zern, should 
be credited with an "outstanding ef. 
fort" for the weekend. Her two 
matches accounted for 12 of the 31 
Saint Mary's team points. 
Tuesday's match with Hillsdale, which the Belles won by a 5-3 score, was "closer than anticipated," said Killeen. The number-two doubles match was called after the first set due to darkness since the outcome of the match had already been decided. 
Killeen now must prepare his wo­men for another weekend ofquality competition as the Belles challenge a talented field in the two-day Notre Dame Irish Invitational, scheduled to begin Sunday at the Courtney Tennis Center. 
Saint Mary's volleyball teaiTI sweeps three from Tri-State 
By KELLY PORTOLESE 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team 
record stands at 9-4 after a convinc­
ing victory over Tri-State on Tues­
day night. The Belles took their 
opponent in three straight games, 
15-3,15-12,15-3. 
Saint Mary's coach Brian Goralski was pleased with the win and noted the joint effort displayed by the team as everyone got a chance to play. 
In game one, Tri-State proved to be no match for Saint Mary's. The visitors could not handle the power­ful serves oftheir host and thus were unable to set up very many offensive plays. Sophomore Mary Dilenschneider led the Belles' attack with six service points. 
In the second game of the match, Tri-State jumped out to an early 5-1 lead. 'lbe score then see-sawed back and forth until it was knotted at 11. 
The Belles, however, remained in 
control of the match. Senior Ann 
Boutton rattled off a couple of kills 
with assists from freshman setter 
Erin Smith. 
Behind the serving of freshman 
Mary Carole Feldman, whose eight 
serves included a couple of aces, 
Saint Mary's took charge early in 
game three. Senior Molly Baker had 
some well-placed hits as outside hit­
ters Kara Tekulve and Jane Reichert 
also fine all-around games. 
Goralski says that his team will be practicing intensely in the next few weeks as it gears up for the latter half ofits schedule, which features some extremely tough competition. 
The Belles begin three week..o; of away matches tonight as they take on both Hillsdale College and Spring Arbor College. Saint Mary's first match of the evening is slated for 7 p.m.

Ironically, it was Cannon's love for tennis that led him to realize his 
running talent. He went to Cranbrook High School in Michigan, a boarding school, in order to play tennis. In the fall of his first year at the school, he entered a cross­country race and won. As a result, he began to run track instead ofplaying tennis. 
His high school accomplishments included being a two-time state mile champion and being ranked in the top 10 for high school runners nationwide in the 1,500 meter run.

SAN DIEGO -Kevin McReynolds hit a three-run homer and Garry Templeton cracked a two-run double as the San Diego Padres scored a 7-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs last night and stayed alive in the National League Champi­onship Series. 
The Cubs, now with a two-games­to-one lead in the best-of-five series, still need one victory to advance to their first World Series since 1945. 
No team has ever won an NLCS after losing the first two games, but the Padres kept that possibility open with last night's win. 
Trailing 1-0, Templeton's double ignited a three-run fifth inning against Cubs right-hander Dennis Eckersley. The Padres finally had found a chink in the Cubs' pitching · armor, which had held San Diego to only 11 hits and two runs in the two previous playoff games, won by Chicago at home, 13-0 and 4-2. 

McRcynold's homer, his first since Sept. 3, capped a four-run sixth in­ning that put the game away.

ND Invitational 
Irish play host to 45-team field today 
By NICK SCHRANTZ 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame cross-country team competes today in the Notre Dame Invitational at the Burke Memorial Golf Course. The 45-team field, which is split into two divisions, begins the five-mile race at 2 p.m. 
The Irish will be going after their third straight meet champion­ship of the year. In the young season, the team has already won the National Catholic Meet as well as a tough five-team meet. As a result of its impressive start, Notre Dame is ranked 18th this week in a poll of national coaches. 
However, the Irish will be heavily challenged for today's meet championship. Among the teams entered in the field is Michigan, the 12th-ranked team in the country and one that Irish head coach Joe Piane feels is extremely tough. Illinois State, a team which received honorable mention in the national poll, is also entered, along with tough Division I schools like Bradley, Ohio State, Eastern Michigan and Western Michigan. 
"lbe Notre Dame Invitational is the oldest and largest intercol­legiate cross-country meet in the nation. The meet was started by Alex Wilson, a former Irish cross country coach, in 1953 and has grown to be one of the best meets in the country. 
The top 18 teams in the field, based on performance in last year's meet, race at 2 p.m. The other 27 teams in the field begin racing at 4 
p.m. Additionally, each college is bringing three extra men and those runners will race in an open collegiate race at 3 p.m. 
The Irish, along with Michigan and Illinois State, should be the favorites. This is the best field Notre Dame has run against this year, however, so the meet should be an accurate indicator of the team's strength. 
Changes in Tim Cannon's life parallel those of team

Three-time cross-country monogram winner Tim Cannon returns to Notre Dame for the final year of an already impressive career. During these four years, the Irish cross-country team has undergone changes that parallel changes in Tim Cannon's personal life. 
Cannon explains that during his first few years at Notre Dame the cross-country team was more individually focused. The individual would stand out and he recognized, instead ofthe team and its group accompli1'hments. 
Tim Cannon was one of those individual runners who stood out. As a freshman, he was coming off a great high school career and was one of only three Irish freshmen to earn a monogram. His sopho­more year, he ran an excellent race in finishing second to Big Ten Conference championJim Spivey at the 1982 Indiana Big State Meet, establishing himself as one of the top runners on the team. 
In his junior year, he was elected co-captain and had another fine year. He won dual meets against Ohio State and Northwestern, and captured fourth-place hnno..., .,, h.   h Ll. ·"at. -1al Catholic Meet and the Notre Dame lnvn.t .. unal

Yolleyball team faces St. Louis U. looking for 3-0 conference record 
By MARY SIEGER 
Sports Writer 
Dedication is one of the es..o;;ential 
elements that drive a team and, 
thanks to two victories this week, 
the Notre Dame volleyball team is 
more determined than ever to ac­
heive its season goal, the North Star 
Conference Championship. 
Tonight at 8 p.m. in the main arena of the ACC, the team will be taking an important step toward that goal as the Irish host St. Louis Uni­versity in their third conference match of the season. Notre Dame hopes that tonight's match will push its season record over .500, in the process improving its conference mark to 3-0. 
Although St. Louis lost some key players to graduation last year, the Billikens promise to be a power­house in the conference again this season. Last year, St. Louis took second place in the conference and defeated Notre Dame in two close contests. Tonight the Irish will be looking to even the score. 
"We're vastly improved," says Notre Dame assistant coach Renee DeGraff. "I don't think (St. Louis will) be in the same spot in the con­ference they were last year, and we're hoping to knock DePaul and them out ofthe top slots." 
DeGraff believes the Irish will defeat the Billikens tonight if Notre Dame plays up to its potential. 
"Ifwe combine the desire we had against Bowling Green and the in­tensity and unity of the DePaul match, I think we can do it," she says. "We have the capabilities and, if we put it all together, we'll win." 
Wednesday night's victory in Joliet, Ill., over St. Francis College gives the Irish confidence going into tonight's match. Although it took Notre Dame four games to overcome St. Francis, 11·1 5, l 5-13, l 5·8, 1 5-4, the contest improved the team's season record to 6-6 and should help the players with the mental part of their game. 

Notre Dame's errors in the first game gave Saint Francis an edge early in the evening. 
"The beginning was a nail biter," said DeGraff. "They didn't score as many points as we gave them." 
When St. Francis took command early in the second game, something clicked with the team and the Irish turned the game around for a 15-13 win. 
"The 1 1-1 5 loss was the turning 
point," said DeGraff.' "When they jumped out in the second game, we realized they weren't that good and we could beat them." 
St. Francis is one of the most com­petitive teams in the NAIA and the 
Irish  were  surprised  when  St.  
Francis  was  not  as  tough  as  its  
reputation.  

"We may have been intimidated in the first game," explained senior spikerJosie Maternowski. "Then we started to hit well; our hitters had a field day with their shorter players."

Saint Mary's names Wood basketball coach for 1984-85 
To fill the spot that former coach Mike Rouse recently vacated due to a budget contro­versy, Dr. Jo-Ann Nester, Saint Mary's director of athletics and recreation, announced yesterday that Marvin Wood has been named the Belles' new basketball coach. 
Wood, who is scheduled to of­ficially accept the position on Monday, boasts 27 years of In­diana coaching experience, in­cluding both men's and women's teams of various statures. His background is based in high school competition, where he boasts a 1954 boy's state champi­onship at Indianapolis North Central, recent hoy's fourth-and ninth-place state finishes at Mis­hawaka High School, and a 22-2 Mishawaka girl's team that made 

What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. 
-William Shakespeare 
Football hadn't been invented back in Shakespeare's day, but he seems to have had a good grasp on some basic football tenets. The famous quote above, for in­stance, could be changed slightly to a statement that Notre Dame fans can understand:A win is a utin, even if you are outgained or outplayed. 
As Irish football fans have learned, the team that receives the win is the one with the higher point total at the end of the game. It's not enough to outgain the op­ponent or control the ball for most of the game. You have to score the most points. 
This lesson seems so obvious, but, until last week's Missouri game, we have watched Notre Dame push mari} of its opponents all over the fidd and lose. Last year, for instance, the Irish outgained every opponent but Boston College and finished 7-5. Somehow, they managed to lose games in which they seemed to be in control. Whether it was a turnover, an unsuccessful fourth-and-inches play, or just plain bad luck, Notre Dame found some way to finish with the low score on the scoreboard five times. Very rarely have the Irish been dominated i~ the past few years. 
For this reason, the Missouri \\-in was much more in­portant than many people realize. Fur three years, the Irish have been losing games very much like Missouri did on Saturday. The Tigers controlled the hall for most of the game, hut couldn't come up with the big play when they needed it. Despite all this, they had a good chance to pull off a win at the end ofthe game, but blew it. It was almost an exact duplicate ofNotre Dame's per­formance against Air Force last year (which was also televised hy ABC). 
Winning the Missouri game the way they did was definitely a good sign for the Irish. They made their first successful goal-line stand in more than three years, and they won a game that was televised by a major network for the first time since the Michigan season opener of 1982. So what if Missouri is l-3? The Tigers are still a good team with a very good offense who was playing at it to semt-state competition during the 1981-82 season_ 
Presently coach of the Mis­hawaka summer A.A.U. women's squad, -wood continues to produce winning teams as, under his direction, the Hoosierettes have won the state tournament the past two years; in addition, they have earned eighth-and fifth-place  national rankings, respectively. 
"I am really looking forward to getting started at Saint Mary's," says Wood. "It is a first-class school, and I am sure that they are going to want a first-class pro­gram." 
It now only remains to be seen ifWood can pick up where Rouse left off with an up-and-coming program, and if the Saint Mary's administration is willing to back it_

home_ So what if ND was lucky that Lhe Missouri kicker messed up the kick? He missed the kick, Notre Dame won the game, and that's all that matters. It's as simple as that. After three poor seasons, it doesn't matter how Notre Dame wins, as long as it wins. 
Of course it's a little early to say what effect the Mis­souri game is going to have on the rest ofthe season, hut it is safe to say that it has assured that the Miami game will be one ofthe best games in Notre Dame Stadium in a long time. 
With both teams ranked, the Hurricane-Irish matchup is what Notre Dame football is all about_ Miami is the defending national champion. Notre Dame is looking to move into the Top Ten. And both teams hate each other. 
If ever there was a game for students to get psyched up about, it is this one. Last year's loss was embarrassing enough, hut the Miami players were anything hut gra­cious winners. They verbally abused the Notre Dame players and coaches, many times with anti-Catholic taunts. It would he nice to make the Hurricanes feel as unwelcome in South Bend as they made the Irish feel in Miami. 
"Ibis is a very important game fur the Irish. A win would be a big confidence-booster for the team and the fans. A loss wouldn't ruin the season, but it would be very frustrating to think that Notre Dame couldn't win an important home game against a team that it was em­barrassed by in two of the last three years. 
Hopefully, the Missouri game was a sign that the Irish finally are getting some good breaks. If it takes a stroke ofgood fortune to win, so he it. Ifthe Irish can batter the Hurricanes and win, that's even better. 
It really doesn't matter, because a win is a win, and a win over the Hurricanes would be even sweeter.
