A national conference on "New Lives for Existing Educa­tional Facilities" will be held in the University of Notre Dame's Center for Continuing Education November 6-7. 
The objective of the con­ference is to exchange views on effective utilization of existing educational facilities and on pos­sibilities for modification of facilities to accommodate new educational programs. 
"Too many modernization programs are really no more than simple maintenance or re­habilitation -new lighting, new paint colors, acoustical tile ­and when we're finished, the classrooms are still the same size, and they still dictate or limit the

educational program possibili­ties," commented Ben E. Graves, research director of Educational Facilities Laboratories in Chi­cago. "We have spent our money locking the school right back in its egg crate." 
Graves' organization is one of three groups involved in spon­soring the Notre Dame con­ference. The other two are the University of Notre Dame's de­partment of education and the School Facilities Council. 
Obsolescence is one of the problems the conference will analyze. "When educational change kept a steady but slow pace," said Dr. Richard H. Metz­cus, Notre Dame assistant pro­fessor of education, "school plant obsolescence was manage­able. But now obsolescence not only affects schools only a decade or two old, but is often partially introduced even as buildings are completed." As examples he cited the absence even in recent buildings of ade­quate audio-visual facilities and flexible-size classrooms. 
Conference speakers, in addi­tion to Graves and Metzcus, in­clude Dr. Eugene Campanale of Notre Dame's department of

Tom Murphy Beat the Beatles 
Rather than plunging headlong into another great political problem of today, this week we'll take a new look at an "old" group --the Beatles. 
WANTEp: DEAD OR ALIVE 
PAbL McCARTNEY 
During the past few weeks (especially since the release of Abbey Road) there has been a race to discover clues, hidden in past alb,u~s, that point to Paul McCartney's death. Accroding to some, Paul died in an auto accident in November of 1966 ("He blew his mind out in a car" on "Wednesday morning at five o'clock ... "). Since that time, a substitute Paul has been used. The clues begin in Sgt. Pepper but don't reach full proportion until Magical Mystery Tour. In this later album, phrases such as "I buried Paul," a chant "Paul is dead," and a newscast, that never became a reality, announciqg McCartney's death, can plainly be heard when you know how and where to find them. "Walrus," supposedly, is a Greek word meaning "corpse" and, when John sings "Glass Onion" in The Beatles, the clues appear to be a give-away: 
I told you about the walrus and me --man 
You know that we're as close as can be-man 
Well here's another clue for you all 
The walrus was Paul. 
Right now, there are two schools of thought: I) Paul is dead, 
somehow the Beatles covered it up (possibly afraid of a decline in 
popularity) and they began to give out hints of his death because 
they could not restrain their grief; and, 2) as always, the Beatles are 
having some fun and created as wild a joke on the world as they 
could imagine. 
The first theory has many practical problems in it -most obvious, how did the death remain a secret? If true, however, (and many contend the Beatles's records evidence this fact), it could be an accurate explanation of both the change in the Beatles's music 
since 1966, and John Lennon (who was closest to Paul). Certainly John was extremely depressed immediately after Paul's death. "Day in the Life" exactly expresses John's feelings -he contemplates Paul's death, goes into a dream, suddenly P>aul is alive again (singing, "Woke up, fell out of bed ... "), but John fades out of the dream and becomes depressed once more. However, because he has done such a marvelous job of keeping Paul alive through a Paul "look-alike" and some recordings, John is n0w rejoicing. On the cover of Abbey Road, he pictures himself as God-he resurrected a dead man, or, if you prefer, he re-incarnated Paul through records. 
Despite all this, it is still quite possible the Beatles are all alive and laughing at us as we buy up old albums and play them backwards so 
WASHINGTON (UPI)­
Antiwar groups yesterday 
disclosed plans for a massive, 
three day mid November protest 
against the Vietnam War and 
vowed the only thing that could 
stop it would be total and 
immediate withdrawal of U.S. 
troops. 
In back to back news 
conferences to emphasize their 
unity, the Vietnam Moratorium 
Committee, which sponsored the 
Oct. l 5 nationwide action, and 
the New Mobilization 
Committee to End the War in 
Vietnam supported each other's 
demonstrations. 
The Moratorium Committee has set Nov. 13 and 14 for its two day demonstrations on the local level, with emphasis on getting congressmen return to their home districts to participate on those two days. The New Mobes plan a "march against death" in Washington beginning Nov. 13 and lasting around the clock until Nov. I 5 when they plan a big rally south of the White House. 
Rumor ·had it that the two groups would not support each other, but leaders of the grqups said those reports came only 
from Boston and New Haven, Conn., where there was local friction. 
Sam Brown, coordinator of the Vietnam Moratorium Committee, said, "the immediate withdrawal of troops from Vietnam is the only thing President Nixon can announce Nov. 3 in his nationwide televised address that would cancel the demonstrations." 
WASI-IlNGTON (UPI)­Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield said yesterday he thought a cease fire had already 
been  essentially  achieved  in  
Vietnam.  
Mansfield  issued  his  

uncharacteristically strong appraisal as a wave of optimism engulfed senior members of the Senate in advance of President Nixon's Nov. 3 address to the nation. 
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee quietly postponed a planned series of public hearings that had been expected to produce sharp criticism of the President's Vietnam policies. 
The committee's ranking Republican, Sen. George D. Aiken, R. Vt., predicted that all 
U.S. ground troops would be out of Vietnam in one year, implying he had been told so by the White House. 
In his regular morning meeting with reporters, Mansfield went out of his way to praise Nixon's policy of ''protective reaction," which recently replaced the "maximum pressure" tactics employed by 
U.S. troops. 
He said it represented a basic change in policy and when asked

The two groups said they held a four hour meeting into the morning hours Tuesday to make sure they were "marching in the same direction."

Regardless of which theory you accept, the most fascinating (and frightening) thought is that the Beatles are able to control life and death (if only on their records) and are able to completely bewitch their audience. Whether Paul is dead or alive, the Beatles will emerge 
from this more popular than ever (Paul included). That could be what they are attempting to tell us -"Our popularity will grow after we're dead even as Christ's did." It's something to think about.

if it was a de facto cease fire, said, "I think that is what protective reaction means." When asked if he felt there was now a cease fire, Mansfield nodded his head "yes". 
Aiken said in a statement 

"unless the unexpected happens, 
I expect that practically all of 
our ground troops will be 
withdrawn by a year from now." 
Aiken made a similar 
prediction several weeks ago in 

an interview with United Press 
International. This time, 
however, the Senate's senior 
Republican issued a carefully 
prepared press release 
emphasizing he had "been kept 
well informed on the progress of 

the President's withdrawal 
policy." 
The Foreign Relations Committee hearings had been set to begin Oct. 27. Chairman J. William Fulbright. D. Ark., said the committee decided "as a matter of courtesy" to defer them until the President addresses the nation Nov. 3. The hearings were called to disuss various antiwar measures introduced by critics of the war, including a bill to require total 
withdrawal by Dec. I, 1970.

Black studies 

Thomas Musial's report that the Committee for Black Students is finalizing definite plans for a black studies program should dispel the belief that the university is sitting on its hands when it comes to black studies. 
Musial, secretary of the committee that was set up last year, outlined a number of definite proposals that the board was to vote on at a meeting last night. Especially significant is the fact that the committee's work will keep the black studies program from getting lost in a larger ethnic studies 
program. The broad outline for coursed, the creation of an Archive for Black Arts and Sciences which would provide for films, video tape documents, artifacts, extensive telecommunications hookups, and library materials will be meaningless without the selection of a black director for the entire effort. The problem with finding a director lies in the fact that almost every major college and university in the country is looking for one. Qualified directors are scarce and money is an all important factor in attracting one. 
Father Hesburgh at his meeting with students three weeks ago, emphasized that getting the program off the ground was his top priority. We believe he is sincere in that effort. 
We hope however, that the administration is not moving unilaterally on the issue. The Committee for Black Students has six black members who have a say in what suggestions will be made on the content of the program. However, Dr. Thomas Stewart, special assistant to Father Hesburgh is working independantly on the problem of finding a director. We feel that he should remember the need to get student opinion on the type of director that should be obtained. 
Student participation in the decision will occur only if students realize the need to approach Dr. Stewart and other members of the administration with their opinions. The people responsible for making decisions should not have to guess which students have ideas on the issue and need to be approached. Students with definite ideas on the black studies program have to come forward and present them. 

Alumni problem 

Tensions have arisen in Alumni Hall over Sunday night's scuffle in the room of Matt Connelly. 
The Observer story on the incident was Connelly's version of what happened. It was that way because no one know the names of the people of the other party to the incident. 
Since the article was printed we have got several reports from blacks that all the factors in the incident were not reported. The blacks felt however, that it was too late now to report the side of the incident. We feel that is not the case since the community deserves to hear both sides of the case. 
The Observer does not intend to preside as judge and jury over any situation. We feel also that no student or group of students on campus have 
Ed Roickle Vietnam Moratorium 
I think there is a very real danger that the Vietnam Moratorium is being, or has been, co-opted by the very system it is addressing itself to. 
In New York City, for instance, Mayor Lindsay announced his support for the Moratorium, and ordered that flags be flown at half-staff and that bells be tolled at noon. Is this the same Mayor Lindsay who high-handedly engineered the municipal election ballot change this past September? (The mayor's machine had the Socialist Workers and the Socialist Labor Parties thrown off the ballot; it is being contested in the courts.) Is this the same man who allowed police to close schools in New York City last year, against the wishes of both parents and students? The same one who used pressure tactics 
to force and end to the Sanitation Workers strike? You bet he is, and he knows exactly what he is doing. He's taking a calculated pohtical risk that antiwar sentiment, particularly among minority groups and the poor, as well as among white liberals, will elect him mayor. 
Here at Notre Dame, Senator Goodell took much the same stand as Lindsay took. He maintained that the United States made a mistake in getting into Vietnam, and that now we should get out. He explained that his Senate Bill set a limit of Dec. I, 1970, so that the Thieu government would have a chance to stabilize itself. Here is the danger we must guard against: the obfuscation of the real issues implicit in Vietnam. 
Vietnam was not a mistake. Our financing of the French occupying forces, the establishment of the Diem puppet govern­ment, and the subsequent escalation of the Vietnam conflict were the direct results of a calculated risk the United States took to protect her worldwide imperialist interests. It was necessary for the United States to make an example somewhere to frighten other nations into submitting to her foreign policy. What the United States did not count on was the stiff popular resistance it encountered in Vietnam. 
Now the death toll rises, and the cost in men and money becomes unbearable to a large segment of the U.S. population. No longer do many people buy such myths as the international communist conspiracy and the domino theory. The South Vietnamese govern­ment has been shown up for what it is-a puppet government without popular support which owes its continued existence to the force of American arms. Now we are spoon fed a new myth-the myth of the mistake-in order to take our attention off the real issues of the oppression, racism, and imperialism which make up 
U.S. 
foreign and domestic policies. When the Vietnamese conflict is over, what then? If the present 

U.S. 
policies continue there will be another. Right now we are supporting unpopular, oppressive governments in Brazil, Angola, and Iran to name but a few. One of these could easily become the next country in which the U.S. will try and defend its foreign policy. 


lindsay, Goodell and the others know this. They all have a big stake in the present system of government, and they're doing their best to make sure it continues. So it serves Goodell very well to talk about mistakes, while ignoring the disease which infests the whole system of which he is a part. Likewise it serves Lindsay well to support the Moratorium. It may be his last chance for reelection by an electorate which attacks him from all points of the political spectrum. 
Beware of those who harp on Vietnam as a mistake. Look to the disease and not just to the symptoms. Unless we address ourselves to the basic problems of imperialism, racism, and oppression which underiy the Vietnam conflict and our whole society, then there will be many Vietnams, both foreign and domestic. 
that perogative either. Some members of Alumni Hall, both black and white, have expressed the feeling that they are not going to let Connelly and the other members of the incident work out the situation among themselves through the proper judicial channels. We feel that Connelly and the others involved have the right to work out a just settlement of their differences. They are meeting with Father Riehle this afternoon to discuss the situation. We feel that the other members of Alumni Hall can only hinder justice from being done by trying to involve themselves in the situation in any way.

Letters 
Civil disobedience 
Editor, 
In response to the events and discussions of the recent Moratorium, I would like to clarify my position on Civil Disobedience. 
The United States is founded and stands on its Constitution. If we are to be citizens, we are to support and uphold that document. · 
The constitution states that the people have the right to elect representatives who shall make the laws which govern the land and to set up punishments for those who do not wish to obey these laws. It establishes an executive branch of government to enforce these laws and a judicial branch to judge, first, if the defendant is guilty of breaking the law, and second, if that law is in conjunction with the principles upon which this country is founded, as established in the constitution. 
A man must follow his conscience, a right preserved under the law. He can choose to obey the law he feels is just and disobey the law he feels is unjust, inspite of the fact that the majority of the people's representatives feel it is justified. He must, however, feel strongly enough in his convictions to bear the consequences of his actions. 
Accordingly, a man has the· right to destroy his draft card or refuse induction if he is willing to serve his sentence as established by the legislature and upheld by the court. But no man has the right to in any way infringe upon the rights of others in voicing his dissent, such as destroying draft files or 
causing harm or inconvenience to any other person. Dissent is possible under the 
law. The constitution established not only the right to free speech, free press, and free religion, but also the right to petition. If a law which is established no longer has the backing of the majority of the people, they have the right to petition the government to change the law to recall their elected officials, and to elect representatives who will carry out the will of the people. If one can prove that the majority of the people do not agree with the law, through petition or elections, then the law must be changed. Demonstrations, rioting and violence, on the other hand, do not prove anything; they merely voice the opmwns of the dissenters. They are fine in bringing ideas out, but they have no consequence on the law. Therefore, isn't it wiser and more effective to dissent within the law? 
One further note, it is my 
Political activism 
Editor: 
It seems that after October l 5, Notre Dame could no longer be called apathetic, if it was that before. That political activism has arrived is obvious to all; from there opinions diverge. 

However, all such beliefs aside, who has the authority to associate Christ with any partic­was questioning a West Pointer. She expressed herself quite well and was succeeding in over­whelming this fellow with all sorts of present day troubles in America caused· by the Viet Nam debacle. As my friend was telling me this I secretly relished the thought of this far-out intelli­gent chic confronting some guy who I imagined could not see beyond the stripes of his uni­
form. 
My friend then told me how she started to get caustic, goad­ing this fellow to answer her points which had now developed into accusations. The cadet, si­lent up to this point replied mildly: "l respect your right to dissent, and I am willing to give my life to preserve that right."

Look homeward, soldier, from Vietnam 
The following was submitted to us by Maura Carroll, a sophomore at St. Mary's College. Joseph Carroll, the author of the article and her brother is currently serving in Vietnam. The article originally appeared in the Rockland County Journal-News of Nyack, New York. Carroll wrote it from a hospital in 
Vietnam while he was recovering from wounds received in action at an advanced firebase along the Cambodian border some 40 miles northwest of Saigon. He has received the Army Commendation Medal and the Purple Heart for distinguished service. -ed: 
There is a war being waged, and it is a war of annihilation. And for the first time in the history" of this nation, it is a war intended to annihilate the American soldiers fighting it. Somewhere in the course of the war a new philosophy emerged, and this philosophy has broadened in its scope, deepened in its implications until now, in this eighth year of battle, we must realize the philosophy as patent national policy. It has three basic tenets: The soldier is an enemy. The war is an atrocity. The military is an ignominy. 
The military est<~ blishment has come 
under fire not only from minority 
dissidents, as has been the trend in wars 
past, but by the rank and file of the 
nation. It is harangued in the press and in 
the media, in the homes of its citizens 
and in the very chambers of its Senate. Its 
recruiters are attacked on campuses, its 
records, along with the flag of this nation, 
are burned in the streets; all by 
citizen-vigilantes who manifest no shame 
in the open act. 
The power of rational thought has been lost in the shuffle, discarded in the emotional upsweep of black and red banners. The ends are not considered, the means have become ends in themselves. The iconoclasts have accepted a doctrine that demands no thought to consequences; a mass hysteria has developed to obviate the necessity of logical thought. Review the expedients and consider the possible end. 
I. ABOLISH ROTC: Lower the quality of the military leader. Make the Army grovel for officers. 
2. HATE THE MILITARY MAN: Remove the dignity and the respect from the service of one's country. Leave the man an enemy to his own people. 
3. 
SKELETONIZE appropriations: Inform the generals that the nation is no longer concerned with what they consider absolutely essential to the support of the man in the field. Inform them that they'll have to cut corners, regardless of the consequences. 

4. 
DISCREDIT The Generals: Allow the Senators to criticize the Generals on their own ground, to dictate to the Generals how to run the war. 

5. 
UNDERMINE the spirit of the Soldier: Let him know that the nation for which he is fighting considers him dirt, considers his leaders inept, considers his cause futile. 


The situation that has arisen is so 
absolutely ludicrous that a rational man 
would question the very foundations of a 
nation that could permit it. We accepted 
the situation for so long that we have 
taken it in stride, and no longer consider 
its deathly irreversible implications. The 
situation, basically stated, is this: We are 
waging a war to lose. 

We have no intention of winning this 
war, we have no intention of moving 
forward or backward. The present policy 
is simply to sit tight in a combat area and 
hope that the casualty rate of 300 
Americans a week will not fluctuate 
appreciably up or down. This situation 
can be no more apparent than in the 
recent testimony of the General who 
replied in testimony before the Senate 
Armed Services Committee. "We haven't 
escalated the war. We've had Jess 
battalion-size actions this year than last 
year. It's them, ~hey're the guys trying to 
win the war." 

A GENERAL on the defensive. 
Nothing does the heart more good. And 
how, indeed, could he stand under the 
bombastic accusation that he is actually 
trying to win the war? This nation has 
reached the point where it no longer 
attempts to disguise the enmity it holds 
for its own military forces. A general, 
accused of try1ng to win, and 
cons~qu~ntly end a war, is forced to cry 
out m h1s defense that it is not true that 
he wouldn't think of such a betrayal of 
the nation. An army is hobbled, its soldiers are 
disgraced, its appropriations are cut, its officer corps is undermined. Is the enemy capable of inflicting more damage from without than are the American people from within? This nation has left an ar111y in the field, and has given them express instructions to sit and die; its greatest shame being the desire to win the war. 
WHAT OF THE FIGHTING man in Vietnam? What of the man in the rice paddies who realizes that he is thr sacrificial lamb of a nation that suddenly "changed its mind"? What of the man who 
realizes that his purpose is simply to wait until the politicians can find an excuse for withdrawing him, while his numbers drop off in the hundreds each week? And for what purpose? Is there a greater horrm than dying without a purpose? This natior. has no intention of supporting them. Then why do they continue to do battle? Either they are disbelieving that their people could actually betray them in this manner or are too dedicated to the ideals which the nation has since abandoned to be concerned with the betrayal of that nation. What has no one informed them that the political situation has taken a turn, and that death is now in vain? 
And to be completely consistent in the absurdity, the nation sits at the conference table and attempts to win an "honorable" peace, while the enemy knows full well that they are hobbled and are no longer a serious threat. What bargaining tool can be effective when an enemy knows that you are totally resigned to defeat and withdrawal? 
ON THE CONDUCT of the war itself, 
Senator Teddy Kennedy has accused the 
military of mismanaging the war. 
Hamburger Hill, for example, was not 
"handled well." And Senator Kennedy is, 
of course, an authority on military 
matters. Who could cast shame upon a 
man who has the guts and courage to 
speak out against war-mongering generals? 
Vote? What have votes to do with truth 
and justice and good old righteous 
indignation of ogre generals! 
And, of course, it's always good sport 
to attack a man you have officially bound 
and gagged. General William 
Westmoreland, queried as to the validity 
of Senator Kennedy's statements replied 
in typically aggressive fashion: "I do not 
think it proper for me to comment on the opinions of a Senator." And when asked if it were at all proper to comment on the tactical situation in the first place, replied: "I do not think it proper for me to comment on what is proper for a Senator to comment on." 
We have lived with the irrationality so long that we have accepted it, let it go unchallenged, and it has reached a point where our minds now refuse to question, refuse to sift through the facts and reach a logical conclusion. What better witness to this than the proclaimed end of the 
agitators? That end, of course, is the total abolition of the Military. 
BUT THIS, TOO, can be accepted with the same non-thinking ambiance. For who would be foolish enough, in this day of idealism and love, to suggest that we actually need an Army to protect the nation? Who would be unpatriotic enough to suggest that force is a legitimate instrument of national policy? Who would be naive enough, in this frenzy of peace and charity and good-will, to suggest that we cannot trust our brothers and Russians and the Chinese? 
When did we first start to obviate the practical in lieu of the idealistic? When did we first begin to believe that a nation can survive without an Army? When did we first begin to believe that the Communists are brother-lovers? When did this once 
mighty nation succumb to the belief that a defense can be managed without strength, that a nation can be preserved without might, that ideals which we 
consider precious can survive in a world 
where they are attacked on all fronts, and 
we are left with only our slogans and Jove 
beads to protect us? 
And then there is the voiceless man in the field. The one who cannot defend himself, for, like General Westmoreland he is too bound by honor and duty t~ speak against the will of the people. The m!litary !radition is one of compliance w1th national demands, not arguments. The soldier is an n [ nted cause, a burden, and a drain. He is the man in the field who reads of his own malevolence and ignominy in the papers of his country. He is the man who sits in the rice paddies of the murky Delta and wonders why the BS 2 strikes have been cut when they are sorely needed. He wonders why his country has forsaken him. 

Board committee makes recommendations 
(continued from page 1) 
that within the year plans be looked into for building a new library. The building would offer more study and typing areas, expanded audio-visual facilities, and office space. 
If passed, the proposal goes to 
the Library Committee which 
will make the investigation. 
The committee was informed 
by Sr. M. Alma, special assistant to the President in charge of foreign studies, that SMC is purchasing a seminary in Rome from the Holy Cross Order. 
The move is part of an expansive program which hopes to make study there possible for 70 sophomores (and juniors, if their schedules permit) as of September, 1970. Students in the program will pay the $3200 they pay now. 

The college hopes to make a profit if it can manage to have the building donated. The student fees could then be applied elsewhere. 
Rome classes next year will be conducted in English and there will probably be no language requirement for admission. However, beginning September 1972 at least one year of Italian will be necessary. 
Defense department critics leak United States military secrets 
WASHINGTON (UPI)­Senate critics of the recently passed $20 billion weapons procurement bill exposed defense secrets wholesale during their debate, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R. S.C., said yesterday. 
Thurmond, while acknowledging the bill's opponents had a right to details about the proposed weapons, said they could have studied classified records inste<Jd of airing details on the Senate floor. 
Thurmond, in a Senate speech, said that during the six weeks of debate, defense critics went to "unprecented length" to 
challenge the weapons item by item and spread secret information on the public record. 
"During this debate the thought often occurred to me that our enemies would have been required to pay millions to espion<~ge agents for the information revealed in a copy of the Congressional Record," Thurmond said. 
Referring to the bill carrying the Nixon Administration's proposed Safeguard antiballistic missile system and a wide variety of other weapons, and now pending in the House, Thurmond said Senate debaters "precisely pinpointed locations of planned missile sites and expected interception points with enemy missiles, and discussed all points of strength and weakness of the proposed system. 

"Furthermore, we revealed to a large degree exactly what we know and what we do not know about the military strength and pl<~ns of the Russians and the Chines. 
"Can you imagine the copies of the Congressional Record which have been shipped to Russia, Chi<~n, Cuba, and other unfriendly countries during the last month." 
If St. Mary's students do not fill the quota, the program will be opened to students from other colleges and universities. 
The committee discussed the pass-fail system and made a statement to the effect that it encourages the investigation of, and further experimentation with, the system. 
According to Pam Carey, the other student representative to the committee, the statement was "a reinforcement of what is being done by the Academic Standards Committee" which stated the intention last spring. 
The SMC Development Committee made a recommendation to the Board that over the next three years five million dollars be raised to finance faculty salary increases and various academic programs. 
A large amount of the acquired sum would be allocated to physical building-extension of the library, expansion of the science facilities, and development in other vital areas which could be proven inadequate to student, faculty and administrative needs. 
The committee recommended that the remainder of the funds be used for scholarships and student aid. 
Julie Dwyer, student representative, said the plan would be to "hit the alumni, hunt down grants, and approach people who can afford to contribute significantly." 
The main recommendation made by the Student Policy Committee was that the advisory programs on campus be allowed to continue as they stand. It was felt that both the program headed by Miss Martucci and the system of orientation utilized this fall provide the best service for the student. 
However, Miss Martucci and the committee maintained that a need existed for more people qualifies in her field to handle the numbers of students asking for help with problems. 
The SMC Spiritual Life Coordinator, Fr. Richard Downs spoke on the different programs-such as the advances and the Stapleton Masses-existing as St. Mary's. He continued with a discussion of the role of the priests on campus and their relation to theology as presented to the students in their classes. 
Student representative Karen Schultze said of the committee "I think that the committee i~ acting in an informative capacity. I hope that in subsequent meetings that status will change." 
Eadh of these committees meet twice a year, the next meetings to be held in spring.
