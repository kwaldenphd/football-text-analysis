Special Olympics seeking support 
By MICHAEL DUNCAN 
News Staff 
Notre Dame basketball players were not the only ones who enjoyed cheers and applause from fans at last Monday's basketball game against Hofstra. 
Playing at half-time, two Special Olympian teams, the first of many spons programs for the mentally­handicapped sponsored by the St. Joseph County Special Olympics, also entenained the crowd. 
These Special · Olympic programs are scheduled to last through the end ofMarch. 
To finance these events, the or· ganization has announced a major fund-raising campaign in which they hope to make S55,000 in donations .to provide for the ap· proximately 550 athletes. 
Susan Coffman, an area coor­dinator for the Special Olympics, said "the resources we obtain will enable us to maintain our current programs, which include training sessions and competitions on a lo­cal, area and state level." 
Coffman also stressed that all money for these programs must come from private. sources such as "businesses, civic groups, school organizations, and individuals," be· cause they receive no funds from any other organizations, including the United Way. 
Notre Dame's Special Olympic Commissioner Erik Hickey said he wants Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students to become in-

Saint Mary's EXCEL fund nearing goal of $25 million

With S 3 mlllion yet to raise by the 
end of the fiscal year, EXCEL, the 
fund for Saint Mary's, offers every in· 
dication ofsuccess, according to Be­
dey Drury, director ofdevelopment. 
"This is a major undenaking and 
accomplishment for Saint Mary's,". 
said Drury. 
EXCEL, which began inJune 1980 
under the direction of national 
chairman Mary Morris Leighton, has 
set its goal at S2'5 million. Thus far, 
S22 mlllion has been raised and the 
final S3 million is expected to be 
reached by May 31, she said. 
Of the S25 mlllion, according to 
Drury, S7 million has been car· 
marked for the endowment. "The 
Bruno Schlesinger chair will be es· 
tabllshed in humanistic studies," 
said Drury, explaining the long-term 
plans for the endowment. 
The endowment fund also is being 
used to establish 25 scholarships, 
she said. 
The cost ofoperating Saint Mary's 
budget will be offset by S4 million of 
the planned S25-milllon EXCEL 
fund, said Drury. 
The remaining SI4 million was 
originally earmarked for construe· 
tion, she said, but the actual amount 
is· uncertain because contractors 
may overbid or underbid the figure. 
Contributions to the fund have 
originated from several sources, ac­
cording to Drury. 
The Institutional Development 
Counsel/Mail Program, in which 
College alumnae and friends receive 
letters requesting contributions, is 
targeted toward people who give 
under S500, according to Drury. 
This program asks for three year 
pledges. "So Saint Mary's becomes a 
constant part oftheir philanthropy," 
she said. 
Other sources arc the National 
Endowment for the Humanities 
Challenge grant, the Ully Challenge 
grant, the Madaleva Society, the an­
nual Fund Mail Program and EXCEL

volved in the organization in con­junction with the fund-raising campaign. 
Hickey said he hopes to have "a representative from each dorm take the responsibility of raising money within their own dorms," and perhaps have a competition among other dorms for the most money earned. 
The St. Joseph County Special Olympics has been providing progtams for special athletes for 15 years . 
During this time "we have seen them make great strides both physically and emotionally," said Coffman. 
Also planned in the future is the International Summer Olympics to be held on the Notre Dame and Saint Mary campuses in 1987.

Only students can blow off classes, not 'horrendous' snow storms 
It happens every January. 
Meteorologists repon high temperatures that couldn't possibly be considered "high" by any rational person south ofJuneau. I awaken to the grinding sound ofsnowplows scraping concrete and hope that Dick Ad­dis' weather word has proved prophetic and that condi­tions really are "horrendous." Of course, this being South Bend, they are. Visions of"classes cancelled" bul­letins dance in my head. 
Ofcourse, this being Notre Dame, they aren't. 
According to the Provost's Office, which makes the decision to cancel classes in consultation with Saint Mary's, classes haven't been cancelled since 1966, when a blizzard forced the University to close for one day. More recently, during the blizzard of1977, the Uni­versity was shut down for business for a day. 
"We didn't close for classes--we shut the University down for business. I don't recall ever closing for classes 
in  my  tenure,"  said  University  Provost  Timothy  
O'Meara.  He  added  that  
"Generally  speaking,  the

According to  Head Groundskeeper Bill Thistleth­

professors were able to make it in," O'Meara said. 
Even though it would appear from this history that class cancellation at Notre Dame is a very slim pos­sibility, the Provost's Office does not arbitrarily issue an edict from the dome ordering that they be held. O'Meara says he considers such factors as weather predictions, the current conditions at the time the deci­sion is made, and estimations from the Office ofStudent Affairs and the maintenance departments as to what condition the campus will be in at the time classes are scheduled to start. 
So perhaps my hope ofbeing snowbound is foiled not by the Provost's Office, as I had originally thought, but by the groundskeepers. 
If this is the case --if classes will only be cancelled if the omnipresent snowplows cease to operate --then I think we're in for a long and busy, albeit snowy, winter. 
After all, anyone who has strolled the campus when even a few flakes are lillling, knows the zealousness and

itselfdetermines whether or not classes will be cancelled, as Physical Plant Director Don Dedrick noted. 
"Every snow is different and it depends on the in­dividual storm, the day it occurs, the time it ends, the wind velocity, and the depth ofsnow," Dedrick said. "If you have a hard-type blizzard situation with high winds and blowing snow ... then the men really can't do much. They exhaust themselves and their equipment. The snow we've had so far this year has ended around mindnight or 1 a.m., which gives us time to get the men out and the campus in shape by morning," he added. 
Perhaps if these plows were not so effective, and the wind velocity was at the perfect level throughout every snowstorm, and the snow began falling at 4 a.m. instead of 11 p.m., and the administration wasn't so dedicated to academics, and ... well, then classes would be can­celled. 
But don't count on it.

Mexican air crash kills 18 passengers, 3 crew 
Los Mochis, Mexico An AeroCalifornia airliner DC-3 carry­ing 21 ~ople crashed yesterday on a hill ncar the fog-covered airport of this Pacific port, and an airline spokeswoman said all aboard were killed. 
"There were no survivors," said Mara Castellon, spokeswoman for the airline's main office in La Paz on the Baja California peninsula. She said the two-engine propcllor plane was flying from Ciudad Constitucion on Baja California to Los Moe his, car­rying 18 passengers and three crew members. 
Ernesto Zavala Valdes, the spokes­man for AeroCalifornia in Los Mochis, said all aboard were Mexican citizens. He said the plane crashed because "of lack of visibility." 
Associated Press reporter Cam Rossie, who was flying above the Los Mochis airport in a six-seater Cessna at the time of the crash at ap­proximately 10:1 '5 a.m. EST, saw the accident. 

"It l>urst into flame and from the air you could see the tail section was 
separated  and  it  looked  like  the  
plane  was  totally destroyed,"  she  
said in a telephone interview.  

"We were approaching, our pilot said we were not going to land in Los Mochis because of fog and the air­port was closed. Then he changed his mind and said we would go ahead and go to Los Mochis and see what it looks like," Rossie said. 
"We were in the air and this DC-3 was in the air. He said we'll wait and see if it lands, see how it does. 
"It (the AeroCallfornia plane) made an attempt at the landing strip, partially covered with fog. We were circling the hill by the airstrip, and the DC-3 plane couldn't land on its first attempt and so it came back around and it started to climb over the hill. Its wing went down and it crashed on the side ofthe hill." 
A man answering the telephone at the AeroCalifornia office in Los Mochis said there were 18 pas­sengers and three crew members aboard.

Counselors help students, adults cope with loss of famous teacher 

Associated Press 
CONCORD, N.H. -Adults and children in the city where Christa McAuliffe taught school cried openly yesterday as they con­fronted their anger, sadness and disbelief over the death of their colleague and teacher. 
"The teachers seem to be more upset than the students," saidJohn Reinhardt, coordinator of school psychology and guidance programs for the Concord school district. 
"They are closer to her, her col­leagues and personal friends. The kids for the most part seem to be handling it well." 
Twenty-five psychologists, guidance counselors and therapists went into the public schools to help the 4,500 students deal with their griefover the death 
ofthe hometown space teacher. 
Classes were canceled at the 
high school where McAuliffe 
taught, but teachers and coun­
selors were available, if students 
wanted to come in and talk. 
Reinhardt said that other school 
districts across the nation might be 
doing the same thing, depending 
on their students' reaction to 
seeing the explosion which killed 
McAuliffe and six astronauts. 
"It affects every child in the country that saw it," said Rein­hardt. "Christa was dynamic, down to earth. She spoke in a language children could understand. NASA public relations did a tremendous job in publicizing the event, em­phasizing the educational benefits. This flight was part of the students' curriculum." 
Many students expressed sym­

pathy for McAuliffe's family includ­ing her two children, Scott, 9, and Caroline, 6. 
Reinhardt said children at the Kimball Elementary School, where Scott is a classmate, asked the counselors for every bit of in­formation they could get: why did this happen? what caused the acci­dent? 
Clint Cogswell, the principal at Kimball who had been in Cape Canaveral to witness the launch, spoke to all of the classes, describ­ing everything that happened. 
Eighteen children in Scott's third grade class who also had flown to Cape Canaveral to watch the launch were given the day off yesterday because they returned home so late Tuesday night. 
"They feel the event is almost like a dream," said Reinhardt. 

Shuttle

credible jigsaw puzzle confronting the space agency. 
The officials reiterated that there will be no more shuttle flights until investigating teams have made their report and corrective actions are taken. 
"I want to assure you, as others have, including the president of the United States, that this loss will not stop us as Americans from exploring the frontiers ofscience and the fron­tiers ofspace," said Graham. 
"The space shuttle is our principal 
space transportatin system," he said. 
"It will remain our principal space 
transportation system for the 
foreseeable future." 
Moore said an interim investigat­ing board is meeting almost con­tinually and forming teams to investigate different aspects of the accident. A formal board, including representatives of the space in­dustry, the Air Force and other ex­perts, will be convened later. 
"Our job is to make sure we don't miss any evidence and to preserve it in as pristine a shape as possible," he said, adding that once the problem is corrected, "We intend to move ahead with the space program." 
Mission Control, with all its sop­histicated technology, had no war­ning of the impending explosion, said Greene, who was directing Challenger's climb to space. 
"We train awfully hard for these flights and we train under every scenario you can possibly imagine," he said. "There was nothing anyone could have done for this one. It just stopped." 
He described the mood in the

control room as "extremely profes­sional under the circumstances, very somber, there was not much said." 
When computer screens showed no more data was coming in, he said, engineers watched the views from television cameras. 
"We were hoping something bet­ter would come out of it," he said. After a while, we resumed gathering data, put it all up and called it a day." 
Speculation focused on an ominous bright flash that was visible at the base ofthe fuel tank before the explosion, but shuttle directorJesse Moore said he wanted to discourage that. 
"You are asking me to lay out causes." he said. "I'm not prepared to do that." 
NASA scheduled a memorial service at the Johnson Space Center in Houston tomorrow and said Presi­dent and Mrs. Reagan will attend. 
In Palm Bay, a community south ofthe space center, plans were made to name a school after Christa McAuliffe of Concord, N.H., who was aboard the shuttle as the first "common citizen" to fly in space. She had planned to teach two les­sons from space to schoolchildren all across the country. 

Killed along with McAuliffe were commander Francis Scobee, 46; pilot Michael Smith, 40; Judith Res­nik, 36; Ronald McNair, 35; Ellison Onizuka, 39, and GregoryJarvis, 41. 
An investigation team held its first meeting to start the long inquiry into why the $1.2 billion shuttle, ap­pearing to be on a perfect course, suddenly exploded 7 4 seconds after liftoff Tuesday, raining fiery debris into the Atlantic Ocean. 
Lt. John Philbin, commander of the Coast Guard cutter Point Roberts, brought back the first load of debris. He said there was 600 pounds of it, much of it in small pieces. 
"Most of what we found was bulkhead-type material, aluminum with insulation attached to it," he said. "There were a couple of charred pieces and we did bring in some small cylinder-type tanks this morning." 
The Point Roberts was the first military ship on the scene. He said his crew watched the debris coming down and got the location from a tug in the area. 
The space agency impounded every scrap of paper, film and data connected with the launch and pleaded with souvenir hunters to turn in anything they find on the beaches in this central Florida area. 
"We need every piece of that be­cause we don't know where the clue might be," said Richard Smith, the director of the Kennedy Space Center. 
Eight ships, including four Coast Guard cutters, and nine airplanes searched the 50-by-1 00-mile rec­tangle where Challenger's wreckage fell.

NASA acting administrator Wil­liam Graham said the shuttle will not fly again until investigators know what caused Challenger to blow up and measures have been taken "to make sure it doesn't happen again." 
The most immediate loss of the Challenger disaster is to studies of Halley's Comet. 
Challenger was carryinga satellite designed to take unprecedented photos and instrument readings on the comet. A mission scheduled for March also was to conduct a HaJJey study, but that now, too, is lost.

It's a debate that has raged in the scientific community since the first days ofexploring the heavens. 
"Nobody wants to say 'I told you so' the day after seven people have died," said Gordon Pettengill, a planetary astronomy professor at the Massachusetts Institute ofTech­nology. "I wouldn't be surprised if this did cause some re-examination. It would be strange to me if it didn't." 
While experts are hesitant to revive the debate so soon after Tues­day's tragedy in which the ·seven crewmembers were killed, con­cerns are surfacing over the impact the Challenger accident will have on unmanned projects. 
"I don't want to sound callous but one of the things we always worry about in a tragedy like yesterday is

"If we miss the May launch dates for the satellites, then we would have to wait for 13 months for anot­her launch opportunity," said a JPL spokeswoman. 
Both Ulysses and Galileo are to be launched toward the planet jupiter. Ulysses is to use jupiter's gravita­tional boost to soar over the top of the sun and become the first known object to orbit the solar poles. Galileo is to be sent to a permanent orbit of jupiter for a concentrated study of that massive planet and its moons.

the money that it's going to take to correct (the problem) is likely to come out of the hide of unmanned (projects)," said John Freeman, a Rice University space physicist. 
"The thing that strikes me is that this happened four days after the successful Voyager rendezvous with Uranus, a planet we've never even had a photograph of," said Dr. Ed­ward Ney, a University of Minnesota professor of physics and astronomy and a shuttle critic. 
Data recently radioed back by Voyager 2 have given scientists new photographs of the five major moons of Uranus. The moon Miranda emerged as an icy world unlike any other ever seen in the solar system. 
In a recent issue of Scientific American magazine, Dr. James Van Allen, a longtime shuttle critic, argued that manned flights were diverting important resources from unmanned probes.

Israeli jets attack Palestinian bases 
Associated Pre!l8 
SIDON, Lebanon Israeli warplanes streaked in at dawn yes­terday and rocketed Palestinian guerrilla bases in citrus groves that border a sprawling refugee camp, flattening one building and badly damaging two. 
Hospitals in this ancient sout­hern port said one guerrilla was killed and five guerrillas and a Lebanese civilian were wounded in the first Israeli air force attack this year inside Lebanon. 
Four jets rocketed the bases of Syrian-backed guerrillas on the outskirts of the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp near Sidon, which is 25 miles south of Beirut. 
They made several passes at the three targets nestled among orange and lemon trees around the camp. 
The air attack occurred shortly before an infiltrator from Jordan killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded two in an ambush at the border settlement ofMeholain the occupied West Bank. The Israeli military command said the in­filtrator was shot dead. 
Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, who was in Berlin, said the air raid would not affect the plan for Middle East peace negotiations he is promoting on his European tour.

Americans spend more for better bill of health 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Americans are healthier and living longer, but also paying steeply for it, the govern­ment said yesterday in its annual report on the nation's health. 
Life expectancy is at a record high and infant mortality at a new low, the report said. 
Although infant mortality fell to an estimated 10.6 deaths per 1,000 births in 1984, health experts said they continue to worry about the slowing pace of the decline, and a persistent gap between the rate at which white and black infants die. 
Achild born in 1983 could expect to live 74.6 years, a new high, the study said. The longest life expec­tancy is enjoyed by white females, 
78.7 years; the shortest by black males, 65.4 years. 
On average, a man who turned 45 in 1983 could expect to live the age of 74.7, more than three years longer than his 1950 counterpart, while a woman celebrating her 45th birthday in 1983 could expect to live to 80.4, more than 4% years 
longer than the 45-year-old woman of 1950. Gains in the nation's health have not come cheaply, however. 
Per capita spending on health reached $1,580 in 1984, three times the amount spent 10 years earlier, the report said. And medical infla­tion continues to surpass the overall rise in consumer prices, although at a slower pace than in recent years. 
In his report to Congress, Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen called the record "impressive." 
Gains in life expectancy were at­tributed in large part to the decline in cigarette smoking and to im­proved treatment of high blood pressure. The latter has been a focus of government educational cam· paigns, particularly among blacks. 
While more than half of all adult males smoked in 1965, that figure dropped to approximately 35 per­cent in 1983. Statistics for women showed a much smaller decline in smoking, from 34.2 percent to 29.9 percent -and black women showed an increase. 

Official: Non-smokers have legitimate rights 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-It's time to stop dismissing non-smokers as "finicky busybodies" when they complain about inhaling other people's smoke, a government health-safety official said yesterday. 
John Topping Jr., staff director of the Environmental Protection Agency's Office ofAir and Radiation, said evidence linking "passive smoke" to disease, though fragmen­tary, "seems sufficient to warrant strong steps to cut down involun­tary exposure to cigarette smoke." 
He said his own agency was not proposing cigarette-smoke regula­tions. But he spoke approvingly of scattered cities, such as San Fran­cisco, that have passed laws on the subject. And he said public health warnings would be a good idea. 
Topping, speaking at a National Academy ofSciences public hearing, said that: 
Last 
year's projection, by govern­ment and other researchers, of 5,000 annual lung-cancer deaths from non-smokers' exposure to passive smoke has "gained accep· tance in the public health com­munity." 

A 
"mountain of evidence" links smoking parents with infants' il­lnesses. 

Other 
studies have indicated ex­posure to passive smoke "may significantly increase risks of heart attack." 


"The non-smokers' rights move­ment has been portrayed by tobacco interests as an assemblage of finicky busybodies intent on imposing their values on smokers," Topping said.

Much work is necessary to improve book sale 
Many people, at some time in their lives, are confronted with the problem of the poor among us. Throughout life, there is always someone who has less than-we have. 
Jeanne Grammens 
ask not 
Sometimes feelings ofguilt accompany this reality. We might ask why we were given the opportunity to study at such a university while many struggle to finish high school, or why we want another pair of Guess jeans while some are in rags. While material wealth, intelligence, good looks, luck and many other factors are unequally distributed in this life, we cannot let guilt overshadow the utilization ofsuch gifts. 
Somewhere along the way, someone told me the more gifts we are given, in whatever form they come, the more responsibility we have to share these gifts with those who are lacking. The most promising way to share these gifts, however, is not in a better-than­thou giving offish, butin a more Christian way of teaching how to fish. It's all in the attitude. When I first went to the Center for the Home­less in South Bend, 1had a fear that could have overshadowed my intentions. I was afraid to be among "those people" because they would think I was some snooty college student wearing my heart on my sleeve. 
I soon found the answer to this stigma lies in an understanding of humanity. Come on, we're all in this together. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. When we have poor among us, we, as human beings, are poor. When we have hungry, sad, lonely, cold, dirty people among us, we are hungry, sad, lonely, cold and dirty. When we feel one with these people, not above them, then we can truly help them. How do we help them? There is not an easy answer to this question, but through limited experience, and unlimited contemplation, I have developed a theory. 
There are three types of people in this world: those who need help and are willing to help themselves, those who need help and are not willing to help themselves, and finally, those who cannot help themselves. The last classification is the easiest to explain. They are the ones many people are ashamed of. Some of them are the ones we try to get rid of or hide. The ones we try to get rid ofare the ones who never have a chance to help themselves. They are killed before they see the light ofday. 
Millions of people, millions of Christian people, more specifically, millions ofCatholic people, believe a woman has the right to deny these people -excuse me, these "potential people" -the right to make a life for them­selves. Who knows, these tiny fetuses may have had gifts to share with us in this world. 
Old people, along with the physically and mentally ill, share in this reality that they can­not really help themselves. These people truly need our help. Their needs are the true test of Christian compassion because they can never pay us for our time and efforts. 
The second group of people are discourag­ing to work with. They have the ability to help themselves, but they have reached a point of despair. This is when the human feeling ofdig-

nity has been worn away. Contrary to com­mon belief, this feeling is not born with someone. It is painfully scraped away by cir­cumstances and by fellow human beings. It is on the faces ofthe people at the Center for the Homeless, the people in the Detroit soup kitchens and the people on the park benches right behind the glorious White House. Who knows if the feeling of dignity and human value can ever be recaptured in the people who have reached this point. We can only try to show them that they do have a purpose in life. They too have gifts to share. 
Only with this belief will the beginning of human potential be realized. The last group of people, those who are willing and able to help themselves, are the closest to reaching this potential. The major problem is the fact that they are often not aware ofthe tools they have for helping themselves. Surprisingly enough, there are institutions attempting to show them. 
In Detroit, Michigan, there is a temporary shelter which requires a contract from every person who enters the doors. Each guest must participate in daily upkeep of the center, along with keeping his or her section clean. They must also spend hours a day seeking employment and permanent shelter. Some of the members have united to form a commit­tee to mediate between shelter administra­tion and guests. Being treated like human beings, responsible for themselves, gave them the incentive to stand up for their rights. They united and formed an organized, legitimate committee. 
Other organizations in Detroit work with the same beliefin human value. Soup kitchens, shelters and neighborhood renewal organiza­tions work to incorporate the neighborhood people into the administration. The people are realizing that they can and must help themselves. These people, who learn to value and take control of life, may be the ones who can reach the people in despair. 
Human beings place value in things in which they have invested time, energy and ef­fort. That is whyJoe Domer values the date he has called six times. Or why Mary SMC values the "A" she has studied for. The first step to dealing with the poverty in our midst has to come from the poor. They have to value their lives and realize their potential. 
Many times human beings need a push or an insight to the potential at hand. As gifted people, we are expected to offer the insight, the push. Sometimes the needy are not far off, in Washington, D.C., Detroit, Mich. or the in­ner eity of South Bend, Ind. Sometimes they are in the room next door, or in the Business Ethics class. 
Often the solution to human despair lies within the human being himself, but more times than not we cannot reach the answer by ourselves. We need to see a hand extended in human compassion. We need to be shown how to use the fishing rod, rather than be given fish. As long as there are human beings who are not realizing their potential, human beings on the whole are incomplete.

Does anybody know what happened at the Student Activities Board book sale? The people in charge of the sale don't seem to know. When I asked them if they had ab­solutely any record ofthe book I placed in the sale, the only answer I repeatedly got from those who were incharge was"I don't know." 
Sam Siewert 

guest column 
The SAD people did produce a haphazard listing of books that were supposed to have been accounted for upon my insistence. Un­fortunately, a complete list had not been made prior to the sale as it should have been. This seems to be a practice that would be con­sidered basic to any sales venture. I am sure I am not the only existing casualty of this chaotic extravaganza that was a "Mutt and Jeff' scene from start to finish. Finally, even if you personally were not affected I still feel it is important students ofa major university such as Notre Dame should know their Student Ac­tivities Board seems to have some accounting practices which are questionable. 
I enjoy very much the activities the board promotes; however, in my admittedly limited experience with its business practices, I feel it is quite unsatisfactory. I am quite sure anybody who was involved in the booksale, purchaser or solicitor, can commiserate with me. I believe the sale was a great idea although grossly mishandled. 
Let me explain the pitfalls of the past sale and offer some ideas for badly needed im­provement ifsuch a sale is to be held again. A record was not made ofthe book I dropped off to be sold on the day before the actual sale. Those in charge did have a contract that was filled out at this time; however, in my case, they did not keep a record themselves and in­stead gave the sole copy back to me. 
Those who attended the sale, I'm sure, are quite aware of the disorganization and result­ing mayhem of that operation. The location was poor. For any sale such as this, mucb bet­ter control should have been exercised and the sale should have been better staffed. With controlled check out turnstile exits the service to the purchasing students would have been infinitely better and would most

likely have thwarted stealing which obviously happened. 
Perhaps worst ofall, the books were left out in the hall in LaFortune after the sale, unat­tended, and in heaps open for many days (and they still are) to anyone who wanted to take them. 1 trust most students and I'm sure we all have a lot of integrity, but this was ludicrous. Yes, I know this is a Catholic university, but would you leave the equivalent of 20 dollars on the floor anywhere and expect it to be there the next day? Maybe the people who ran the book sale would. 
Further, when I inquired about my book, I was told I would be called later when they had checked their records. First I was told the book was stolen, then a day later that it had been sold, and finally nothing. I guess it was stolen, but nobody could even confirm the book was in the sale. If the board could not handle such a procedure due to lack ofstaffor interest and determination then the sale should not have been held the way it was. 
Let me offer now a possible alternative for the future. Because a sale such as was held does require a lot of planning and work, both of which were lacking, a much simpler program could have been held. For a fee or percentage, the board could have sponsored an exchange network of books, names and phone numbers through The Observer. 
The student would have simply had to enter information into a computer and await phone calls and productive exchange of books criti­cal to the education they're getting here. I'm sure there are many alternatives. Please do not think I am taking unwarranted cheap shots at the Student Activities Board. I am simply reacting out of concern. The fact my practi­cally unopened 33 dollar Fortran 77 book is in Limbo somewhere never even accounted for is only a small part ofthe issue. I wonder what other funds may be accompanying my book. Finally, I want to make an offer to the board. Please check into this matter, and if you need help, you can count on me. I urge all students to forward their input. This is our organization and money: Let's make sure it is beneficial to us.

Continued pioneering would be fitting memorial 
America watched as the space shuttle Chal­lenger made its 75-second rise into the air, fireballed and then returned to the Earth in thousands of pieces. Across the country, mil­lions witnessed the launch firsthand, express· lng shouts of joy which turned abruptly into cries of horror. The event Itself stands out as the greatest space tragedy in U.S. history, with none of the seven crew members surviving the explosion. 
Cindy Rauckhorst in perspective 
Amid the confusion of NASA investigations, assl·ssments of space travel benefits and at­tempts to grapple with shock and grief, much can be learned from the unplanned and pain· ful twist of events which occurred Tuesday. New Hampshire school teacher Christa McAuliffe and her six colleagues prove to be world-wide educators, even in death. 
Most Importantly, the seven astronauts represent thousands of pioneers, many also risking their lives for a cause:, who have helped the United States to progress to its present state in science, medicine and other fields. These leaders realize perhaps better than most that failure is an integral part ofeventual success, a stepping stone which often answers questions and opens up even more. 
We should not be startled that Challenger malfunctioned; with so many possibilities for mechanical and human error in the complex launching system, the surprise: is that an acci­dent did not occur sooner. Some failure is in­evitable each time man enters a challenging scientific or technological field, venturing vir­tually unarmed into the unknown. 
The fiery fate of Challenger brought crash­ing to Earth the sense: of routineness that had become associated with missions to space. Maybe that's one way to positively assess the tragedy of the crash. The startling realization that nothing is secure, that man is not all­knowing and that nature will at times test the brave explorers by reasserting its mysterious dominion over mankind is a difficult but in­valuable lesson to learn. 
"No one wants a failure in which seven Jives are lost," said Helenmarie Hofman, assistant director of the National Science Teachers As­sociation. "But maybe this will help us redefine what we mean in science by failure... When failure is a part ofhistory, it can become the underpinnings of success. We often get our heroes and heroines in sad ways." 
The catastrophe terminates a success period of more than 20 years oflaunches con­ducted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the deaths of the seven crew members mark the first fatalities to occur during actual flight in more than 50 manned 
U.S. space missions. Only once in that previous history did death occur, during a 1%7 fire which broke out on the launching 
pad and killed three astronauts conducting an 
equipment exercise. 

The solid NASA success record, however, sometimes masks the difficulties and near­disasters which have occurred more often than realized. The closest brush with death during an American flight came on Apollo 13 in 1970, when three astronauts were left in space without power or heat after an oxygen tank exploded. Another malfunction oc­curred in 1966 when the Gemini 8 spacecraft began spinning out of control, rotating crew members Neil Armstrong and David Scott at 60 revolutions per minute. 
Learning from these: mishaps and many ot­hers, NASA scientists continually have made adjustments and revisions to bring the program up to date. Yesterday's dream of reaching the Moon has evolved into the far greater ambition ofexploring remote planets in the solar system. And only our inability to learn from past mistakes will hinder the fur­ther progress of the space program. 
Throughout history, man and machine have worked both for and against each other, man trying desperately to harness this intriguing and challenging power. The relationship has endured triumph as well as tumult. 
The early example of the Wright brothers, for instance, sparked interest in the incredible idea that men could fly using machines. The discovery of a polio vaccine by Jonas Salk showed that man did have some control ofthe diseases which invaded his body. Both success stories evolved, however, only through frustration and failed attempts, and lifetimes ofdedicated work. 
Even the greatest leaders fall sometimes. But the key is treating the fall as a temporary setback, not a brick wall. Persistence, effort, time, money and occasionally even human life are sacrifices in the quest for excellence and discovery. 
The United States should continue Its drive toward excellence In space exploration, using the tragedy of the Challenger as a chance to stop and evaluate its program, and to then move on more determinedly. It seems that would be the most fitting memorial to the seven astronauts, who would want the United States to usc: the new information they have taught us in both life and death. 
We are all pioneers in a sense:, discovering that only through a progression offailures can greater results be achieved and new goals set. Small victories lead to some answered ques­tions and bring up hundreds more. But much can also be learned from malfunctions, failures and even tragedy. 
In the words ofSenator Gordon Humphrey, commenting on the tragic fate of Challenger, "Learning and growth· that's what mankind Is all about."

We must not let the tragedy set our nation back 
I watched with horror and sadness the replay of the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. Seven lives lost In a horrible acci­dent. This tragedy Is truly one to which we have not been exposed before. Most of us are too young to remember how 19 years ago three astronauts were killed during an ex­ercise:. Never before have we lost a life while in !light. Suddenly that has all changed. And we need to ask ourselves, what does It all mean? 
William Wilson or to tear the pages 
The many problems which plagued this mission were almost prophetic -the constant problems and delays almost seem to have been saying ·~don't do it now." But we took a chance, and we failed. 
I cannot help but wonder what the seven astronauts experienced in the last seconds of their lives. Did they know what was happen­ing. did they even know it happened? We cer­tainly realized something happened when we saw what appeared to be a normal flight sud­denly erupt into fire and smoke. 
While we, as a nation, must mourn this loss, we cannot let it set us back. We must inves­tigate to our fullest potential the cause: of this tragedy in an effort to prevent its reoccur­rence. We must not, however, end our space program. Think about the first time someone was killed in a plane crash or an automobile accident, and think where we would be today ifwe had opted then to stop our progress. 
We have so much to learn about our uni­verse:, our world, ourselves from space, and we cannot afford as a people to stop learning. Yes, the events ofJan. 28, 1986, are a tragedy, and we do not want it to happen again. But the knowledge we gain from each trip, which af­fects mankind as a whole, is something valuable which we cannot give up. It is hard to decide if the knowledge is worth seven lives, but perhaps It is. 
I feel for the families and friends of those lost, and I wish they never had to experience this pain of losing a loved one. These: seven astronauts were special people, and they will be sorely missed by their families and friends. Their deaths, however, were not in vain. They gave their lives for us as a people. They were willing to risk everything so that our world would be a little bit better a place in which to live. Let us mourn our loss of these: people, and pray that others will bravely step in to take their places in the continuing quest for knowledge and understanding. 
Our space program's record is still good. And no matter how many times we might fail, we must keep trying. Once we become con­tent to live only on our world, we stop growing as people. President Reagan noted there could be no better memorial to these: astronauts than to keep our space program alive and flourishing. Perhaps the astronauts aboard Challenger would want It that way. 
Let us never forget these: seven brave people, and let us be thanllful there are those few who are willing to give everything so the rest ofus may grow.

potholes and other Impediments In their path. Furthermore, motorists cannot see the run­ners until they are just a few feet from them. This Is dangerous for both the runners and motorists. As this road around the campus Is the only road on which It Is safe to run at night, something definitely should be done. 
Because: there already are several sections of the shoulder paved, the job of paving the remaining sections will not be a difficult one, and It should be accomplished Immediately.

P.O.BoxQ 

Those remaining behind must continue challenge 
Dear Editor: 
If you were like me, you received the news 
of our space shuttle tragedy sometime Wed­
nesday afternoon. And I do mean 'our tragedy' 
· for the entire program belongs to our 
country. It Is our pride, our creation, our tes­
timony to our knowledge and our challenge 
to the heavens. 
And If you watched as I did, you sat in dis­
beliefand horror as you witnessed the telecast 
ofthat terrible explosion. Though I knew oflts 
fate as I sat and watched that craft soar up to 
the heavens, the impact, the pain, and the 
heart-rending sorrow was nonetheless im­
mense. It was as if our nation's dream sud­
denly transformed before us Into a fearsome 
nightmare. We suddenly faced death's cruel 
mistress whom we had so often eluded in our 
missions past. I could feel only the helpless­
ness and pain which we all shared. 
Yet it wasn't supposed to happen that way. Twenty-four previous missions: perfect Such was the routine nature of our launches that many of them went hardly even noticed. We scarcely believed we could fall. And yet we did. 
Let us never forget the lives of those: seven. Let us always remember their families and loved ones. And let us never forget why they died. For it is our human nature to step for­ward and accept whatever challenges lie before us, and though we know the risks, we must always take them. And this is just what they did. It is up to those who remain behind to step forward and continue in their places and to raise our challenge to the heavens once more. As in the immortal words ofJohn Gil­lespie Magee Jr. In his poem "High Flight", those: brave seven crew members have 
"slipped the surly bonds ofEarth And danced the skies on laughter silvered wings sunward climbed, and joined the tum­!Jiing mirth 
And while with silent, lifting mind they 
trod The high untrespassed sanctity ofspace Put out their band, and touched the face of 
God." 

Michael Smith, Francis Scobee, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Christa McAuliffe, Gregory Jarvis, and Judith Resnik, we will never forget you.

Lack of paved surface is hazardous to runners 
Dear Editor: 

I agree with Steven A. Sley's letter ofJan. 24, 1986, concerning the need to pave the shoulders ofthe road from the east gate to the far end of Notre Dame Avenue. As a runner, I often have been inconvenienced by the lack of a reliable running surface in the aforemen­tioned area. Running at night is especially hazardous, as the runners cannot discern

UCLA, North Carolina, Syracuse and Duke. And the Irish already recruit on a nationwide level. 
It appears that at this point in time the Irish have little to gain and a great deal more to lose by joining a conference. For example, in most conferences, television revenues are shared, and it seems the Irish would only lose through this sharing. One gets the impression that Notre Dame would be helping the other three schools at its own expense. 
"If I were them (Marquette, Dayton and DePaul), I wouldn't wait on Notre Dame," CBS announcer Billy Packer told the Tribune. "I don't think they can afford to wait on Notre Dame, and they can exist wit­hout Notre Dame." 
For ·now, it seems, the other in­dependents would rather not take that chance. 
There may come a time when it would be in Notre Dame's best inter­est to help in forming a conference. But, for now, why ruin a good thing?

Chicago defensive specialist Ryan takes Eagles top coaching position 
PHILADELPHIA · Buddy Ryan, ar­chitect of the Chicago Bears' awesome defense, was named head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles yeaterday and promised to lead the National Football League team into the playoffs within two years. 
Ryan, after toiling in relative obscurity for most of his 18 years as a defensive specialist, was given a five-year contract for his first try as a head coach. 
Eagles owner Norman Braman in· traduced the 52-year old Ryan as the best coach in the NFL who would give the Eagles "the winning consis­tency they lacked over the last few years." 
Ryan promptly issued a predic· tion as bold as the Bears' attacking defensive strategy. 
"It will not take the five years to go to the playoffs," he said. "I'm not going to wait that long. We'll be con­tenders in a year or so." 
Bears head Coach Mike Ditka wasn't upset by Ryan's departure. 
"The Bears played challenging, ag­gressive defense in the 60s," he said in Chicago. "It didn't start when Buddy came here, and it won't end because Buddy left here." 
Ryan was the third choice in Braman's six-week hunt for a succes­sor to Marion Campbell, whom he fired less than a week before the end of the season. 
Braman first sought David Shula, 26-year-old son of Miami Dolphins Coach Don Shula, and an assistant to his dad with the Dolphins. Negotia­tions collapsed when young Shula help the punchless Eagles put points on the board. He had said he did not want a defensive specialist. 
Braman said he wasn't concerned that Ryan's status as a defensive coach would hurt his offensive ac­cumen. 
"He offers something to this game that is really unique. He's an in­novator. He's an individual who ap· proaches this game by attacking it. 
refused to accept a five-year option  He's changed the whole concept of 
on a five-year contract. 
Then came Jim Mora, highly successful coach ofthe United States Football League Baltimore Stars. Just when it seemed Mora would be the new coach, there was an unex­plained hitch. Mora on Tuesday was named head coach of the New Or­leans Saints. 
Braman said Ryan first caught his attention Dec. 1 in an article in the New York Times. The subsequent feat of the Bears shutting out two playoff opponents vaulted him into contention for the Eagles job. 
Ryan's selection was surprising since Braman had been seeking an offensive-minded coach who could defense and what you'll see in Philadelphia is a new concept of of­fense as well. 
"... I expect he (Ryan) will be the next Vince Lombardi ofthe National Football League," Braman said. 
Ryan became known for his "46" defense, a 5-1-5 set named after the number ofa former player. It was the formation that made the Bears the top defensive team in the league and crunched the New England Patriots in the Bears' 46-10 Super Bowl tri· umph. 
Ryan said the Eagles, who played a 3-4 under Campbell in posting a 7·9 record last season, would switch to the 46, and predicted it would take "35 minutes" to do it.

AT&T Tournament still played in memory of Crosby despite change 
Associated Press 
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. · The name has changed. It's now the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. But it's still Crosby weather. 
Rain, wind and cold swept over the Monterey Peninsula Wednesday on.the eve of the new-old event. 
That squally, blustery weather, so familiar to the veteran touring pros and celebrity amateurs · some of whom have been playing here for three decades · is forecast to con­tinue through the end ofthe week. 
"We'll give the weather to AT&T," said Harry Crosby, son ofthe tourna­ment founder, the late Bing Crosby and his widow Kathryn. Harry is an investment banker and is playing as an amateur in the tournament that has been rocked by controversy. 
In a dispute with the official or· ganizers of the tournament · the Monterey Peninsula Golf Founda­tion . Kathryn withdrew the Crosby name from the event that has grown into one of the most celebrated on the PGA tour. 
"It's the same tournament, just a different name," said actor James 
Garner,  a  long-time amateur  par·  
ticipant.  "Nothing  else  has  
changed."  

The format remains the same: each of the 180 pros is paired with an amateur partner and they play one round on each of three courses before the field is cut for the final round Sunday. 
Among the touring pros there are 
Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Johnny Miller, Ray Floyd, Fuzzy Zoeller, Curtis Strange and Lanny Wadkins, all long-time par· ticipants, and such relative new­comers as Masters champion Bernhard Langer of West Germany, British Open titleholder Sandy Lyle of Scotland, 1985 Crosby winner 
Mark  O'Meara  and  the  probable  
favorite, Hal Sut ton.  
In  addition  to  Garner,  the  

amateurs include a couple who have been competing here for more than 20 years, Clint Eastwood and Jack Lemmon, along with George C. Scott, Willie Mays and Tom Seaver. 
"The players still think ofit as 'the Crosby.' It's still a men::torial to the memory ofBing," Nicklaus said.

Gipp was quite a gambler while at Notre Dame despite Rock's beliefs 

Associated Press 
At halftime of Notre Dame's game 
with Army in 1920, Coach Knute 
Rockne was exhorting the Fighting 
Irish to come from behind in one of 
his patented locker room harangues. 
One of the players wasn't 
responding to Rockne's theatrics 
and the coach admonished him, 
growling, "I don't suppose you have 
the slightest interest in this game." 
"You're wrong there, Rock. I've 
got S400 on this game and I don't 
intend to blow it," replied George 
Gipp. 
That tale appeared in the Decem· ber issue of Smithsonian, the monthly journal of the Smithsonian Institution. It became appropr)ate last Sunday when President Reagan said In an interview during the Super Bowl pregame show that Rockne once "threw a gambler out of his office one day bodily who had come to see him and was seeking informa­tion about who was going to win. He just hated the idea of gambling as· sociated with football." 
Reagan, ofcourse, played the role of Gipp in "The Notre Dame Story," a 1940 movie. 
NBC newsman Tom Brokaw noted that as much as S2 billion might be wagered on the game, most of it illegally, and asked the presi­dent if that bothered him. Reagan replied: 
"I wish that it could be without, because I think when it gets up to that kind of money then there is too much temptation to try and fix things. And, human nature being what it is, we know from past history 


Associated Press 
FOXBORO, Mass. · The New England Patriots' drug controversy heated up yesterday with the naming of six alleged drug users. The team's player representative said the disclosure dooms its volun­tary testing plan and could lead to a strike. 
"A terrible injustice has been done with the naming ofthe alleged players," Brian Holloway told the Pittsburgh Press. "The idea that those names have come out does not mean that they have used drugs." 
The Boston Globe reported Wed­nesday that Raymond Clayborn, Tony Collins, Irving Fryar, Roland James, Kenneth Sims and Stephen Starring admitted to Coach Raymond Berry they had used drugs. 
"Some ofthose guys have been in a (rehabilitation) program and they're not on drugs any more," General Manager Patrick Sullivan said. 
Sullivan said he was called by  
Utah 
continuedjrompage 16 
how they got out of the blocks," Ar­chibald stated. "They shot well and our kids got down. It rattled some of our players being here." 
'"Notre Dame was somehow upset after the North Carolina game and took it out on the Utes," he added. "We didn't show you how theUni­versity of Utah can play." 
Besides shooting well, the Irish used their large height advantage to qutrebound the Utes by a 46-32 mar­gin. Also, the height differential enabled Notre Dame to easily get the ball Inside for easy baskets and shoot uncontested from the outside. 
Voce agreed that Utah's lack of 

that sometimes they get away with 
that." 

The magazine story pointed out that Gipp, a minister's son, went to Notre Dame on a baseball scholar­ship at the age of 21 after spending the previous three years in construc­tion work and driving a taxi in his home town of Laurium, Mich. Besides playing in an amateur baseball league, the magazine said Gipp also excelled at pool, poker and dice. 
"Personally, he was totally untamed, a potential star to whom practice was a bore, discipline some­thing to be ignored," the article said. 
The late Ring Lardner wrote that Notre Dame had one formation and one signal: " ... have the team line up, pass the ball to Gipp and let him use his judgment." 
In 1919, Gipp and several teammates played for money in a football game at Rockford, Ill., but no one at Notre Dame found out. Gipp also picked up money by fre­quenting the pool halls of South Bend; a joint called Hullie and Mike's became his second home. At the Oliver and LaSalle hotels he took on some of the sharpest pool hustlers and card sharps on the Chicago cir­cuit. 
"I'm the finest freelance gambler ever to attend Notre Dame," Gipp once said. 
According to his roommate, Ar· thur "Dutch" Bergman. "nobody around South Bend could beat him at faro, shooting pool, billiards, poker or bridge. He studied the percentages in dice-rolling and could fade those bones in a way that had the professionals dizzy. At three-pocket pool he was the terrors ofthe ... parlors." 
Gipp's winning, however, helped put some of his friends through col­lege. 
"I've seen him win SSOO in a crap game and then spend his winnings buying meals for destitute families," Bergman said. "No wonder he was idolized by the South Bend townies." 
Bergman also recalled that Gipp ignored curfew, drank and smoked heavily and often stayed up all night carousing or playing cards. 
In 1920, Walter O'Keefe of the South Bend News-Times saw him stumble out of a hotel elevator the morning of the Purdue game "unshaven sleepy-eyed downright soggy. I gave him hell for staying up all night." 
That afternoon, Gipp rushed for 129 yards, including an 80-yard touchdown run. 
Betting by players was common in college football. Wagers often were made on the eve of a game when the two teams met for dinner. Players bet on their own team, or on them­selves as individuals. 
And after drawing Rockne's ire during that aforementioned halftime, Gipp piled up 38'5 yards in total offense, more than the entire Army team, as Notre Dame rallied to win 27·1 7. He didn't lose his S400. 
Six weeks later, Gipp was dead. 
Pneumonia and a streptococcus throat infection that developed after a cold had weakened his lean body. 
"George, it's tough to go," Rockne told to his 25-year-old star. 
Gipp looked up from his deathbed and whispered, "What's so tough about it?" 
Pats reveal drug users to dismay of Player Association's representitive 
Globe reporter Ron Borges, whose story included the six names. 
"He read me the names and he said, 'if I print those names are you going to stand there and deny it?' And I said, 'I wouldn't stand and deny it.' " Sullivan said. "I'm reluc­tant to do that but I'm also reluctant to be put in a position of not telling the truth." 
Holloway, the Patriots' union representative, said the source of the confirmation was not impor­tant. He was more concerned that the names were revealed. 
"I can guarantee you, with the release ofthose players' names, you have seen the end of the voluntary program with the Patriots," he said in Hawaii, where he will play in Sun­day's Pro Bowl. 
After losing the Super Bowl 46­10 to the Chicago Bears last Sunday, the Patriots voted Monday morning in New Orleans to become the first team to institute voluntary drug tes­ting. 
Holloway said confidentiality was one of the conditions ·for the program. Sullivan and Berry denied 
height (no starter over 6-8) helped the Irish both inside and outside. 
"We could pretty much turn around and shoot over them at will," Voce stated. "Their inside men weren't a factor on our shots." 
"We were able to run our offense, which is to feed it into the post and kick it back out to our shooters," Voce continued. "Plus, our outside shooters, like Scott Hicks and Sean Connor, took good shots and hit them." 
When the game turned into a rout many fans stayed in their seats just to see Nicgorski. The sophomore walk· on looked nervous as three free throw attempts hit the back of the rim and bounded away. 
Finally, Nicgorski rewarded the that, saying that even ifthey refused to comment, there was no guaran­tee that drug users' names would not be published. 
"I told the players it's a pos­sibility" that their names would become known, Berry said. "There's nothing I could do about that. I hoped they wouldn't but that was out of my hands." 
Doug Allen, secretary-treasurer of the Federation of Professional Athletes, said from the union office in Washington, "It's incredible to me that the Patriots breeched con­fidentiality. 
"As I understand it, the players had insisted on confidentiality. If that was one of the conditions, management has ignored the agree­ment." 
Allen's federation is an umbrella organization for player associations of the National Football League, United States Football League and Major Indoor Soccer League. 
"You can be assured that this thing is not over yet," Holloway told the Press. 
fans for their patience by taking a pass from Voce and easily canning a turn around jumper. 
The Irish moved their record to 
13· 3, but needed the confidence: 
boost as they head into a tough por· 
tion of their schedule. 
"We're just looking at a stretch of five games in ten days," Phelps stated. "We still have Marquette on Saturday, Maryland on Monday, and then at Dayton and at Syracuse. It's all still in front ofus. Tonight we just wanted to be able to shoot well, hit the boards and play hard." 
Even with many tough games ahead on the schedule, a fine perfor­mance against Utah must give the Irish hope as they work their way to the NCAA Tournament in March.

Belles basketball uses stiff defense in consistent effort against Goshen 
By.Jll.L SARBENOFF 
Sports Writer 
On Tuesday night, the Saint Mary's basketball team improved their record to 6-7 by defeating Gos­hen College, 61-57, at Angela Ath­letic Facility. In an earlier match-up this season, Goshen won by a 30 point margin. 
The Belles took an early 2-0 lead offa lay-up by junior guard Kris Pan­telleria. Twice in the first half, the Belles had a five point lead, 15-1 0 and 17-12. Goshen overcame the deficit to take a 25-23 lead with un­der four minutes left in the half. 
Saint Mary's fought back and recaptured the lead on consecutive baskets by Laura Danch and Beth Kreber. The College went into half­time with a slim 27-26lead. 
In the second half, Saint Mary's again got the tip-off, but they turned the ball over to Goshen, who then proceeded to jump to a 28-27 lead. For the few minutes, the lead switched hands several times. The Belles gained back momentum on a rebound by Kreber. 
Kreher then proceeded to take the ball down court and make three consecutive baskets. The score was now 37-30 in favor of Saint Mary's. Throughout the rest ofthe game, the Belles' defense played tough and the offense was aggressive. 
With 1:1 5 left in the game, Gos­hen pulled the margin to-within two points at 55-53. The Belles never let up, however, and with 23 seconds left in the game, Pantelleria made two free throws to give her team a 61-55 advantage. 
Goshen scored on a last second basket, but it was too little, too late. 
The key to the Belles' success, ac­cording to Coach Woods, was their ability to get the important shots when it counted. 
"Getting a couple baskets in the end when we needed them the most (was the key). I also felt we played an excellence defense," said the coach. 
Woods went on to comment about his team's improvement throughout the season. 
"Our girls have played well in the last seven or eight games. I've been proud of the improvement and togetherness of the team. However, we have not reached our potential yet. We have room for improve­ment," added Woods. 
Pantelleria also felt the Belles' defense was instrumental in the vic­tory. In addition, she cited that not committing many fouls was another important aspect in winning. 
"Ifwe don't foul we'll win because we make more field goals than the other team," Pantelleria said. 
Pantelleria went on to say that she felt her team should be over .500 by the end ofthe season. 
"I think it's realistic to say we can finish above the .500 mark. The way I figure it, we could end up 11-7." 
Teammate Tammye Radke thought the Belles' defense has im­proved considerably throughout the season, as did the players' con­fidence in the team. 
"I think everyone's gained more confidence in themselves and as a whole (team). The freshmen have helped us a lot. The contribution from the bench has helped also," said Radke. 
In Tuesday's game, several players put in outstanding performances. Defensively, sophomore guard Radke had eight rebounds, as did Kreher. Top scoring honors also went to Kreher, who led the Belles with 22 points, and Radke who had 20 points. Radke, in addition, con­tributed eight assists. Pantelleria had seven. 
The Belles will be squaring off again on Saturday at St. Francis Col­lege in Fort Wayne. However', neit­her team has played each other before, so there might be a few surprises in store for Coach Wood and the Belles. 

Alumni handles Sorin in inter hall hockey, Zahm defeats Cavanaugh 
By ORLANDO RUBIANO 
Sports Writer 
In interhall hockey action Tues­day night in the ACC was a night that Sorin would like to soon forget. It was apparent from the start that this one was your classic mismatch as Alumni ( 3-0) went on to overwhelm Sorin in every phase of the game as proven by its 13-1 victory. 
Sorin decided that a checking style game was more to its liking. Sorin players didn't seem to mind the humiliation, and with their fans cheering them on, they decided to play the man instead ofthe puck. On several occasions the action became heated as Alumni players began to take exception to Sorin's tough-guy tactics. 
However, when it came to playing 
hockey, Alumni showed no mercy as 
it let fly with all its weapons. Pat 
Hogan and Jim Vizzini were the 
catalysts as each one scored the hat 
trick. 
The best goal ofthe night, though, 
belonged to Sorin's Chris Kyhl as he 
blasted a shot from the red line that 
caught Alumni's goaltender nap­ping. It was the lone bright spot for winless Sorin as the game clearly belonged to Alumni. 
Alumni captain John Kaltenmark knows that the tough part of the season is yet to play. "We have been using our first three games as a tuneup for our upcoming games. Tonight we played good position hockey, and let Sorin have fun playing their brand of hockey," said Kaltenmark. 
In Tuesday's second game, the Rabid Bats of Zahm handled Carroll fairly easy as they won, 7-1. Zahm ( 2­
1) put the game away early as they raced to an insurmountable lead. Carroll ( 2-1 ) could only comes as close as 3-1 before Zahm was able to pull further ahead. Charlie Hackett had two goals, as did Tom Keating, including a short-handed goal. 
The result was one that Coach AI Parkin and his Bats had to have as Zahm vies for a playoff berth. "Our game next week against Alumni will be a tough challenge for us, said Parkin. "Ifwe can win next week, we should be in good position to make the playoffs. We have been improv­ing steadily in certain areas of our game which have been giving us problems." 
The outcome left both Zahm and Carroll one game behind Alumni and Pangborn in the Corrigan League race. 
On Monday night Off-Campus was surprised by Morrissey as OC was able to play the pre-season favorite to a 3-3 tie. Chuck Curley had two goals and Tim O'Brien scored once for Morrissey ( 0-2-1). 
"We are happy that we got the tie, but we should have won (because) we outhustled them. Our goaltend­ing was good enough to keep us in the game. This game should give us a boost for the remainder of the season," said Morrissey coach Tom Murphy. 
In other rink action, Cavanaugh/Howard (2-0) edged Holy Cross/St. Ed's (1-2) by a 3-2 margin. Pangborn ( 3-0) kept pace with Alumni as they blanked Stan­ford ( 0-3 ), 6-0. 
Fisher ( 1-2) won its first game over Keenan ( 1-2) by a 4-1 margin. Cavanaugh/Howard's win put them in a tie with Grace for the top spot in the Krause League.

Notre Dame sees no advantage in conference 
Saturday the Notre Dame men's basketball team faces Marquette University at the ACC. This will be Notre Dame's second game of the year against one of the Mid­west's great independents, who for the second year in a row are participating in a double round-robin regular­season schedule with the Irish. 
Marquette, Dayton, DePaul and Notre Dame again will play each other twice this season. Last year, the Irish proved to be the best among the nation's independents, finishing with a 21-9 record overall and a 4-2 mark in the round-robin setup. 
Dayton and DePaul both finished 19-10 (3-3 in the round robin), while Marquette ended up 20-1 1 ( 2-4 ). 
"We had the best record when it was over, but it was close all the way between the four independents," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. "I think all 12 games bet­ween the four teams were sellouts, and that really helped create enthusiasm for the matchups. 
"The games were all real battles, the same way it is for Georgetown, St. John's, Villanova and Syracuse in the Big East." 
In the first year ofthe double round-robin format, Notre Dame, Dayton and DePaul all made the NCAA Tournament. Marquette participated in the NIT, and many even felt that the Warriors might have been unjustly neglected by the NCAA selection committee. 

Eric Scheuermann 
Assistant Sports Editor 

In fact, the round-robin format was such a great success in its first year that DePaul, Dayton and Marquette all pushed for the formation ofa formal conference at the end of last year. Notre Dame held out in favor of its indepen­dent status, and the simple round-robin concept was con­tinued. 
But the speculation continues over whether the Midwest independents will need to form a conference in the near future. There has been talk ofgetting some other Midwestern Catholic schools to form a conference with the four mentioned above, but as yet this talk is not even close to becoming reality. 
"It has to come," NBC announcer AI McGuire recently told the Marquette Tribune. "There is no way they (the four major Midwest independents) can procrastinate any longer." 
"The key team is Notre Dame," continued McGuire, who already refers to the linking ofthe four independents as the Vatican Conference. "I did ask Digger Phelps the other day if it would happen before 1990 and he didn't think so. But they need a conference." 
Notre Dame seems to differ in its thinking, and rightly so. 
A healthy conference setting u~ually brings three major benefits. First, it aids in postseason tournament selection. For example, the fourth and fifth place teams in the Big East are selected for postseason play mainly on the strength of their conference. Astrong conference can improve televi­sion revenues, and can also bring increased visibility. This increased visibility helps a team in its ability to recruit and to schedule strong, out-of-conference teams. 
But these arguments fail in the case of Notre Dame, at least at this point in time. The linking of the four indepen­dents in the round-robin proved last year to accomplis1 the first objective of improved credibility for postseason selection -witness the fact that three of the four made the NCAAs. 
Notre Dame has a great deal of visibility without a con­ference, and pulls in enough revenue from independently negotiated television contracts. The Irish, as a result ofthis visibility, are able to schedule strong teams, even in the middle of their respective conference seasons · witness
