Vandals hit student cars 

in D-llot 
Tom jackman StaffReporter 
Thirty-two student-owned au­tos parked in the D-1 lot were the victuns of petty vandalism last Dec. 15. According to Director of Security Joe Wall, the exact cause of the vandalism, which occurred at night, is unknown. None of the cars were believed to have been broken into and all of the damage was external. 
The vandals seemed to aim for the most expensive autos they could find. The cars damaged included a Corvette. Wall said, ''Hoods were walked upon, roofs kicked in, mirrors broken off and tail lights were smashed.'' 
One student noted that four car-owners from the same section ofFlanner Hall were vandalized. Wall believed that the vandals were Notre Dame students, '.'probably just several inebriated guys releasing the frustration of final exams.'' 
Another student pointed out that the group usually damaged the same parts of each car, such as outer rear view mirrors and tail lights. 
Though the damages were not large (no thorough estimate was made), repairs have been costly, and several victims have already filed insurance claims hoping to recoup their losses. The Uni':ers­ity has not been held responstble. 
Wall was quick to emphasize that security has been beefed up considerably since the incident. The parking lot detail has been increased from one to ten persons and four part-time studernts will make the patrols each night on foot. The purpose of the l'atrols will not be to tssue more tickets, but rather to prevent further acts of vandalism, Wall said. He also noted that the security force as a whole has returned to full strength. It previously had been short as many as eight men. 



BANKOK, That/and [AP) ­
Vietnamese-piloted American and Soviet warplanes darted over the skies of Cambodia yesterday, bombing and straf­mg remnants of the Cambodian army still resisting the huge Vietnamese invasion force, an­alists ·reported. 
Units of the Cambodian army reportedly were engaged in ground battles in wtdespread areas of the country with the Vietnamese and their Cambod­ian rebel protegees. 
One analyst described the Vietnamese air strikes as a ''replay" on a smaller scale of American air raids during the Indochina War. The Vietnam­ese got the American jets the United States left behind when the communists conquered South Vietnam in April 1975. The Soviets are al!tes of the Vietnamese and supply them with planes and other war material. 
Military analysts said Viet­namese forces assaulted the Cambodian island bastion of Kong, launched heavy air strikes against ·twO embattled coastal port areas and were faced with resistance in at least half a dozen areas in Cambodia, Vietnamese troops, supported by gunboats, reportedly made their attack from the seaward side of Kong, located just off the coast of southwestern Cam­bodia. 
The Vietnamese moved large gunboats into Kompong Som Bay to pound onshore resist­

Cambodians withstand Vietnamese bombing 
ance and brought r~inforce­
ments to the area along High­
way 4, Phnom Penh's 125-mile 
route to the sea, the sources 
said. 
Fighting also was reported at 
Kampot, further along the coast 
toward Vietnam from Kompong 
Som;Sisophon in the northwest; 
near the 11th-century Buddhist 
temple of Preah Vihear in the 
remote north; around the pro­
vincial capital of Mondolkiri in 
the northeast, and southeastern 
Takeo province. 
Thai reinforcements have been sent to guard the nearly 500-mile-long border with Cambodia. Authorities at the Thai border said 30 Cambodian troops escaped yesterday into Thatland' s Surin Province, ar· riving in several trucks that sped along a dirt road from Cambodia's Oddar Mean Chey province. Border police said the Cambodians were chased by a Vietnamese tank that turned back near the Thai frontier. 
Fifteen Thai villagers and one of the Cambodians were wounded later in a land mine explosion at the border crossing of Chong Chom, a physician said. The villagers went to the border after hearing of the soldiers' escape. 
Thailand has expressed con­cern about the fighting, which has come as close as six miles to its frontier. Thai Prime Min· ister Kriangsak Chomanan said yesterday his government

Chaos, death continue in Iran 
TEHRAN, IRAN [AP] --Arn:tored troops r~n down protesters' cars with thetr tanks, royahst gangs rampaged in the streets and guerillas attacked from across the Iranian border as Iran, sinking deeper into chaos searched for a way out of political limbo. 
Between seven and 21 persons were reportc;d killed and more than a dozen others wounded m bloody fighting across the country. "Beca':'se of the chaos the nation is headed for a new kmd of

trying to assert control, was dealt a new blow yesterday by Ayatullah Khomaini, moral leader of the movement that drove Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlazi from the country. Bahktiar had sent an envoy to try to negortiate with the exiled Khomaini in France, but the Moslem holy man rejected any discussi~m. of_a rec1;m<:iliation. 
Aides satd Khomatm sttll mamttans that t~e Shah-endorsed, U.S.-backed government ts 
illegal, demands its abolition and intends to 
establish a new government. "No ifs, ands, or 
buts," said one aide. This was a rebuff of 
President Jimmy Carter's appeal to Khomaini 
Wednesday to give the new government "a 
chance to succeed." 
The worst bloodshed of the day was the western oil-belt town of Dezful. Iranian military sources said tank-borne troops battled several thousand anti-shah militants after some of the protesters harassed the families of military officers. 
Troops battered protesters' autos with their tanks the sources said. They said six persons were killed. Others said as many as 20 persons have died.

Americans. 
Private economists have less confidence in President Carter's ability to bring inflation under control. All agree, thou~h, that a recession with much htgher un­employment will occur if inflati?n is not brought down from tts current rate of about 9.5 percent. 
Government as well as provate economists had predicted that unemployment would remain a­bove 6 percent in 1978. However, economic growth proved stronger than antictpated, and the jobless rate fell from 6.2 percent last winter to 5.8 percent during the final three months of the year. 
The government's forecast was disclosed as Carter prepared to send Congress next week what he called an austere 1980 budget proposal. 
The administration will use its relatively optimistic employment forecast to justify a proposed $700 million cut for 1980 in the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act public jobs pro­gram. 
The proposed cutback would eliminate 158,000 adult jobs and 250,000 summer youth jobs by Se_et. 30, 1980, when the new budget year ends. 
The CETA cuts are 'lOt as severe as first proposed by Carter's budget manager~, and administration officials satd the cutbacks would be offset by a new $500 million tax credit besigned to encourage provate employment -rather than public employment -of young and poor adults. 
Administration officials believe the credit would prompt the hiring of some 60,000 disadvant­aged adults. 
The employer tax credit, pass­ed 6y Congress last year, would allow employers to deduct up_ to $3,000 from their 1980 tax bills for each eligible employee hired. 
It has been learned that the budget calls for spe~ding of $5,32 billion, compared wtth ~493 btl!· ion in 1979, and a defictt of $29 billion, down from a projected $40 billion deficit in 1979. 
To fulfill his pledges to hold the deficit below $30 billion and increase defense sl'ending by more than the rise m inflation, Carter is proposing cutbacks in some soctal programs and is holding down mcreases for other programs.

Palm Springs' police forces plan extensive security for Shah's visit 
PALM SPRINGS, Ca/if.[AP]­Authorities in this desert re­sort, long-accustomed to millionaires and famous names, were quietly beefing up security yesterday for the expected arrtval of the Shah of Iran. 
Area law enforcement agencies, concerned that the Shah's presence could touch off bloody riots by anti-Shah Iranian students, want to be sure they can protect the 205 acre estate belonging to Wal­ter Annenberg, the former publishing magnate, where 
. . . Carter 
(continued from page 1) 
would "resist fiercely" if the fighting spills over into Thai­land. President Carter warned the Vietnamese in a news conference Wednesday against crossing the Thai border. 
Analysts estimated 100,000 Vietnamese troops were in­volved in the blitz that caused Premier Pol Pot and other leaders of his government to abandon the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh to the Viet­namese on January 7.

There has been no official word on the Shah's plans after he leaves Aswan, Egypt, and makes a stop in Morocco. But State Department sources in Washington say the former ruler has decided to move to the Palm Strings area, 100 miles east o Los Angeles. 
"We're just waiting to see if he decides on Texas, Acapulco or Colorado," said Lt. Max Thomas, a spokesman for the Indio station of the Riverside County Sheriff's Deparment. 
Thomas declined to discuss the size of the security force available for protecting the 59 year old Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and his wife, Empress Farah. 
Annanberg's estate has pre­viously been a haven for visiting dignitaries, including former presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, who built a home a mile away after his election defeat in 1977. 
Annenberg's sprawling es­tate was rec('ndy the refuge of the Shah's 90 year old mother and sister who fled there after violent anti-Shah demonstra­tions broke out Jan. 2 at the Beverly Hills home of the Shah's sister. A number of Iranian students were arrested after brush around the Beverly Hills home was set afire. 
There were no incidents during their short stay here, according to police.

Letters to a Lonely God 
A night journer into life 


Michael Madden, who graduated as an art major from Notre Dame in the Oass of 1978, died in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 1979. 
. A week and a h#ago, I made the night 
Journey by tram from New York to 
Washington for Mike Madden's funeral. 

0~ my way to Penn Station, I kept 
thi~ng: "Grieved young people are 
gomg to ask me to help them make sense 
out of Michael's death, and I don't know 
what to tell them.'' I stopped at a news 
stand, and immediately found James 
Agee's novel A Death in the Family. ~ 
"Maybe, " I thought hopefully, "God 
has inspire_d ~e to buy this book; maybe 
Agee has insights that will lead me to 
reflection.'' Unfortunately for my 
depression, Agee was not writing of a 
young man's death; and after an nour of 
reading, I closed the book, and stared 
out the train window at the darkness. 

"Perhaps Michael's loved ones will 
forgive me if I don't try to comfon 
them," I thought, "ifI explain I am also 
a friend mourning the death ofa friend.'' 
At Union Station, waiting for a ride I 

talked with an old man from Israel wh~m 
I had see~ reading a Jewish newspaper 
on the tram. 

"You are waiting for someone?" he 
said. I nodded. 

"I am also waitin~,'' he said. "Why do 
you come to Washington?" 
"I'm here for a funeral,'' I replied. 

"You will speak at the funeral?" he 
said. 

''I wiil,'' I answered, ''if I can think of 
something to say. " 

"Birth, death, marriage,'' he said, "I 
believe in them. Birth, death and 
marriage are what life is all abou~." I 
wasn't sure what he meant; it seemed 
ambigious. 
"Would you believe it,'' he said, "my 
grandfather died at ni~ety-six? He killed 
himself at the age of runety six. The old 
~ said: 'I have lived too long; enough 
1s enough:' And do you know, sir, I think 
h~ was .nght: enough is enough. At 
runety-s1X, why should he want to live 
longer?" 
I wanted to say: enough has not been reached when a young man is only tw~nty-two years old. Enough is not dym~ young when you have a family who chenshes you and friends who adore you.. E~ou~h is not leaving a world you are nch.y liifted to serve. I'm sorry for your grandfather who decided at the age of ninety-six that enough was enough because even at ninety-six, he couldn'~ know what adventures he cheated him­selfof. For me, enough is enough means only. that I have had enough of this conversation. So leave me alone to feel sorrowful and angry at a death out of due season that I do not understand, and go off and read your Jewish newspaper by yourself. 
The old man did not deserve such an outburst. Instead, I said:' "It's a very dark night, and it's very cold. God help poor wretches on such a night,'' and I gave a dollar to a kid at the station who said he needed busfare home. 
The following morning, as I tried to prepare a funeral homily, I thought: ''Out of all that I know about Mike, and out of my own limited experiences with ~. ,I must speak comfoningly about Mike s death to a congregation of mourners. But first, I must put is all together for my own peace of mind. 
''All that I . have ever known about Mike . has been truly good and truly beautiful. All that his friends and family have told me about Mike has been good and beau~iful; his love_, his thought­fulne~s, hi~ kindness, his laughter, his loy~ues, his compass10n, his generosity. 
Mike's family and his friends whom I ha_ve met, who were so much a part of Mike_, are also good and beautiful J:'eO'JIC" ~Now that Mike has taken hir1Srl1 ltf to God, the goodness and be< ut. :..tr ~ still his. God knows how to

I believe that Mike, the good and beautiful young man, arranged his peace with God Who gathers the shadows of eanh that wear ~ colors of goodness and beauty and JtlVes them substance in His holy 1mmortal life. 1 ' '

11IE GRAPES OF WRAm

It deals with the grinding dustb?wl poveny _of the depression era, and Its con~ormtaQt . impact on the farmworkers m the rmdwest re~ion of the_ US. It depicts the Joad fam1ly and thel! struggle to overcome the misery perya~g the~ lives. They head for Califorrua, hopmg for a better life but find the goin~ extremely difficult. Henry Fonda rums m a sterling performance as the intrepid leader of the Joad clan. An enduring masterpiece, directed by John F?rd. Assisting Fonda are John Carra­dine, Jane Darwell and Charlie Grape­wine. Black and white. 
COOL HAND LUKE 
In my estimation, unquestionably the fmest performance Paul Newman has ever enacted. As Luke, Newman portray~ a rebellious chain-gang priso­ner_. W1th cool contempt and courageous acnm?ny \ he bears the dehumanizing brutallo/ 1mposed on him by the ruling authonnes. Two classic scenes involve the voluptuous female tease washing her car as the gang work on a nearby road; the other has Newman brawling with George Kennedy. His incredible resilli­ence and refusal to quit, although thoroughly pummelled, leh: me emotion­ally exhAusted but full of deference for his audacity and raw will to survive despite insurmountable odds. Directed by Stuan Rosenburg. 1967. Color.

Government refuses to declare 



counttes 'disasters' 
[APJ The Federal Government refused yesterday to declare four northern Indiana counties a disaster area and then said it would reconsider If the state could prove that life and property is threatened by heavy snow the last week. 
Willian). Watt, an aide to Gov. Otis R. Bowen, said the state would resubmit the application but he was pessimistic about the chances of approval. 
Bowen asked President Caner to declare Lake, Porter, LaPorte and St. Joseph counties disaster areas after a weekend blizzard dumped almost two feet of snow on the area. The declaration would make those counties eligible for federal reimburse­ment ot two-thirds of snow removal expenses. 
State civil defense officials said Wednesday that all four counties already had exceeded their snow removal budgets for the year, but they had no other documentation of storm-related losses. 
For that reason, Watt saidthe state never really expected that the request would be approved, adding, "The passage of each day weakens the case." 
In a letter to Bowen early . yesterday, Bill Wucox, administ­rator of the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration, said there was no indication that the situation was serious enough to warrant federal help. ''There are no identifiable threats to life,

Holiday buying reduces chances of recession 
WASHINGTON [AP] -An 
end-of-year holiday buying 
spree by shoppers pushed the 
nation's economy ahead at an 
unusually fast pace and re­
duced the chances of a reces­
sion, a government report in­
dicated yesterday. 
The 6.1 percent growth rate 
in the fourth quarter has nearly 
double what many economists 
had been predicting several 
months ago. It was considered 
high enough to keep. t~e unem­
ployment rate fro~ nsmg about 
6 percent for awhde. 
The Commerce Department 
report showed that consumers 
led the fourth-quarter boom by 
buying more autos and Christ­
mas gifts, but they also bor­
rowed more money for their 
increased spending.
One reason they went further 
into debt was worsening infla­
tion, the report showed. 
It said that prices for all 1978 
averaged 7.4 percent higher 
than they were in 1977, the 
highest inflation rate since the 
9.6 percent figure recorded in 1975. 
Inflation was getting worse at the end of the year as prices rose an an 8.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter. 
Some economists have siad that consumers may be overex­tendin~ themselves. When borrowmg eventually slows, they say, the economy may grind to a halt. 
The Commerce Department's report on the gross national product (GNP) showed that the nation's output of goods and services grew by 3.9 percent in 1978, after inflation was taken into account. That is consider­ed a healthy rate and one that is sufficient to keep unemploy­ment in check. 
Carter administration sources said the government is 
predicting that unemployment will rise from 5.9 percent in December to a peak of 6.2 percent by the end of this year and throuBh 1980. That is far more optunistic than predic­tions by many private econo­mists, who say the jobless rate may rise to 7 percent. 
These private economists contend that inflation is forcing the government to tighten credit substancially. As a result, businesses and home buyers will have more trouble borrowing money, and a reces­sion will result, they say. 
· The GNP report and other economic indicators have shown, however, that if a recession is coming, there is no sign of it yet.

Watt srud that while all four counties already have exhausted their snow removal budgets for this winter, the situation is less serious than during the statewide blizzard a year ago. In 1978, he said, federal money was needed urgently to hire contracts to dear major transportation arteries, while this year it's more of a long-term, budgetary problem. 
There also was a chance of snow or freezing rain and sleet in southern Indiana last night, but forecasters said that should change to rain today as warmer air spreads over the state.

Wrestlers over . 5 00 for holiday break 
by Bill Marquard Sports Writer 
The Irish wrestling team upped 
their season dual meet mark to 
5-4 over Christmas b'reak, 
postin~ a bener-than-average 4-3 
record over the last two weeks. 
The grapplers journeyed to Greencastle, Indiana, on January 9 for a quadrangular meet with DePauw, Franklin and Wright State. The Irish finished 2-1 on the day, posting impressive wins over DePauw (31-13) and Franklin (30-14) while falling to Wright State by a 26-13 count. 
Notre Dame was paced by junior co-captain Dave DiSabato who defeated both ofhis opponents by a combined score of 40-7. John Iglar also posted a 2-0 meet mark, as neither of his opponents scored on the 167­pound freshman. Freshman 134-pounder Curt Rood and sophomore 150-pounder Steele Mehl each notched second-period pins against their DePauw opponents. 
The Irish matmen invaded 
Chicago's Addison Trail High 
School the next ni~ht to challen~e 
Big Ten power Ilbnois. The Ilhni 
proved too tough an opponent for 
the Irish, as they commanded a 
39-2 ·decision. 
Junior Dave Welsh thwarted the 
Iflini's bid for a shutout as he 
tussled to a 5-5 draw. The match 
was a little closer than the final 
score indicated, as three Irish 
grapplers lost their matches by 
one or two-point decisions. 
The matmen closed out vacation with a January 13 quadrangular meet at Middle Tennessee State. Notre Dame climbed back over the 500 mark with a 2-1 perfor­inance, downing host Middle Tennessee 23-20 and Cincinnati 45-11 while succumbing to Virginia Tech 36-5. Dave DiSabatoregistered another per­fect day with 17-4 and 7-0 decisions, the laner being the team's only win over Virginia Tech grapplers. Notre Dame won three of Its four matches a~nst .a decimated Cincinnati squad in that 45-11 win. The squad returns to the ACC pit tonight for a 6 PM match against perennial rival Marquette. Notre Dame will be gunning to even the overall score as the Warriors hold a slight 11-10-2 edge m the 
all-time series. 
"In Marquette we have a team with basically the same caliber wrestlers that we have, "notes Irish grappling coach Ray Sepeta. 
"This even match-up, as well as the good natured rivalry, should make for an interesting match tonight.'' 
  . leers 
(conh'nued from page 8] 
The mind can be a tough opponent and thinking too much on the ice can hinder a team. Come game time, the Irish will have to put everything out of their minds and concen­trate on the game they are playing in. They will have to start reacting naturally to play as it develops, and not think the play through before doing it. 
When 7:30 rolls around to­night at the ACC, the wait will be over, and then we'll see whether or not the new version of the Irish icers will make the climb out of their slump.

Irish breeze past USF as Woolridge nets 18 
by Ray 0 'Brien Sports Editor 
Notre Dame solidified their 
claim to the number one rank­
ing in the country last night at 
the ACC, as they combined a 
quick opening lead and a decis­
ive fimsh downing San Fran­
cisco 88-69. 
Playing before the most en­thusiastic crowd of the season, the Irish caught the Dons standing around on defense at the outset and forced them into turnovers on offense to build a 20-5 lead with 9:30 gone in the contest. 
Orlando Woolridge set the stage for the game as he outmaneuvered the 7-1, 260 pound All-American Bill Cartwright scoring eight points in the Irish's opening streak. 
On defense, Notre Dame sagged on Cartwright, forcing~ :,an Francisco to take long range jumpers. The Irish then won the battle of the boards in a very physical first half. 
"We got behind early. We lost the game in _the first ten 1minutes,'' emphasized Dons' head coach Dan Belluomini. ''Notre Dame is a great team and they are especially hard to play catch-up against." 
Cartwright managed 7 early points before being smothered by Bruce Flowers. Notre Dame edged to a 34-19 lead as Tracy Jackson came off the bench to a add a hot hand in Notre Dame's balanced scoring attack and settle for a 40-27 lead at intermission. 
It was more of the same for ND in the second half as Branning, Woolridge and Tripucka all scored layups giv­ing Notre Dame a 46-29 lead. 
Billy Reid, Doug]emison and Guy Williams countered for the visttors with shots from the perimeter. 
The Dons cut the lead to 59-52 when Williams sank a 20 footer with 9:30 left in the game. However, Phelps' team regrouped and ran off 12 unan­swered points in the next six minutes to put the game away. 
"In the second half we came out with intensity and built up the big lead but let it get away with turnovers,'' explained Phelps. "But we showed a lot of poise and confidence down the stretch to get the lead back." 
Branning explained the tem­porary letdown; "We had a couple of turnovers and relaxed a httle bit. They tried to intimidate us, but as the num­ber-one team we expect that. They just talked to us like we were out on the playground.'' 
For a number-one ranked team the Irish played as if it was just a playground game. "We executed a good game plan,'' offered a satisfied Phelps. "We defensed them full court and shut down their big man. We figured they would eventually miss from the outside." 
Cartwright was almost non­existent in the second half, as he finished the game with mne points. Williams and Jemison led all scorers with 21 points each on 19-33 from the floor.

ND signs Ohio guard 
John Paxson, one of the premier high school basketball guards in the nation, has announ­ced his intention to enroll at the University of Notre Dame next fall. 
The 6-2, 180-pound backcourt­erfromKettering, Oh,,last week signed an institutional letter-of­intent with Notre Dame explain­ing basic scholarship condittons. He plans to sign a national letter with the Irish once high school athletes are eligible to mk schol­arship agreements on April 11. 
Paxson, now in his third year as a starter at Alter High School, has averaged 24.3 P.oints per game this season while helpmg the Knights to an 11-0 record to date. In those 11 games, he has hit 57 percent of his field-goal attempts while connecting at an 80 percent clip from the free­throw lio,e. 
Last season, Paxson paced Alter to a 24-1 record and Ohip AAA state championship while contributing 15 points per game and earning the state tourney MVP award. He helped the Knights to the regional runnerup spot as a sophomore and now has seen Alter compile a 55-5 record under Coach Joe Petrocelli dur­ing Paxson's three years as a regular. 



leers try to rebound vs. Tech 
by Bnan Beglane Sports Wn"ter 

Has the Notre Dame hockey team's bubble burst? That appears to be a question without an answer right now. 
First act a big success 


'QB story' needs a sequel 
Once upon a time there was a young blond haired boy named Joe. Now Joe hved in Monongahela, Pennsylvania, and loved all sports. He especially loved to throw things; a rock, a baseball and even a football. Some people said he could throw a nickle across the neighboring Allegheny River. When Joe grew up he went to a school called Notre Dame. And the rest is now history. 
It reads like a fairy tale, but fairy tales are make believe and Joe Montana was the real thing--ask the Houston players. But when you look back at Montana's collegiate career and how it ended with the last pass on the last play in the last second good for a miraculous game winning touchdown, you begin to wonder if it was real or if you were just watchin~ a corny, "too much to believe" movie; a movte that got terrible reviews because it didn't depict a real life situation. 
But]oe Montana swears it was real life, all five · years of it. And don't forget that it wasn't always that rosy. Montana overcame terrific 

odds, but that is the story of his life. And while Joe Montana owns few Notre Dame records, his story will always be remembered. 
Remember in October of 1975 when Joe came off the bench against North Carolina with six minutes left and ND trailing by six. Watch him complete 3-4 passes for 129 yards as the Irish score th:e go-ahead touchdown with 1:03 on the clock.

-Sure, but many "flash in the pans" have done that. How many come back the next week and pass and run for two ID's in a 21-point fourth quarter to give their team a 31-30 victory? You say two thrilling games does not a "Comeback Kid" make. ' But Montana's biggest comeback was not on the field. In 1975 he injured his hand and 
 missed the last three . games. A preseason shoulder injury kept him out of action in 1976. By the fall of 1977, this hero was almost

O'Brien 
forgotten as Notre Dame prepared to take the National Championship. 
On September 24, 1977, Montana proved to any skeptics that he was truly a "Comeback Kid.'' On that day he came off the bench as the third string quarterback with 16 minutes remaining in a game against Purdue that saw Notre Dame trailing 24-14. Montana promptly went to the air completing 9-14 passes for 154 yards enabling the Irish to score 17 points and beat the Boilermakers, 31-24. In retrospect, a season that might have spelled disaster became an immaculate success. On that day Montana not only won the game, but won his team a National Championship. His transformaton to a starting role paralleled his team's success. 
Remember the 49-19 trouncing of USC in a game that saw the "Monongahela Minuteman" shine for a full hour as he completed 13-24 passes for 167 yards and two TD's and rush for two more earning him ABC's Offensive Player of the Game Award. 
Remember the come-from-behind win at Clemson? See Montana pass for a ftrst down after a ftrst and 50-plus yards-to-go situation. 
Remember  the  Cotton  Bowl  that  made  the  
Texans forget the Alamo.  
But perhaps  Montana  saved  his  best  two  

games for last. His .(>erformance against USC and the final play agamst Houston willl rank as two of the grearest comebacks in Notre Dame history. After all, it only seems appropriate that it end that way. 
Yes, everyone will remember part one of the Joe Montana story. 1 can hardly wait for the sequel! 
With the trouble the-Irish have 
been having on the ice as of late 
(losing five of their last six), it's 
obvious something is missing. 

The trouble is no one can really 
put their finger on just what has 
gone wrong. For sure, the 
bubble has deflated. 

Ah, but one deflated bubble 
docs not a season make. 

Lefty Smith and his Fighting Irish began their task of re­building that bubble this week with some adjustments in the lines and on defense. They -have been in a slump, and as Smith says, only divine guid­ance may get him the answer to 
his team's troubles. 

"Heaven only knows just 
what has gone wron~," offers 
the lOth year coach. 'We have 
definitely been in a slump and 
we can't really find a reason for 
it. It has not been a case of the 
players letting up and not 
trying nor has it been due to 
injury. We /'ust have not been 
working wei as a team like we 
were.'' 

"I think we have had a 
tendancy to skate a little bit 
tight and not open up like we 
should. · We have had the 
opportunities and have just not 
been able to put the ruck in the 
net. With schoo back in 
session we are back to our 
normal routine, and having the 
students back in the stands 
should help out a little.'' 

But despite having dropped 
in the standings and losing four 
of its last five league contests, 
Notre Dame, tied for fourth 
place, is still only four points 
away from first place Minne­
sota in the WCHA standings. 

That's the kind of year it has 
been. Only four points separate 
the top five teams. 

"We have been seeing the 
kind of thing that has happened 
to us happen around the 
league," continued Smith. 

"Last week Minnesota outshot 
Minnesota-Duluth by a very 
wide margin both nights (107 to 72 total both nights) yet UMD came away with a win and a tie from Minnesota's rink. Hockey can be a funny game in this respect and sometimes hard to figure.'' 
So to try and break out of the slump and get things rolling again, Smith has altered the offense and defense. Here is. the new version: OFFENSE: FIRST--Dave Poulin at center for Greg Meredith and Kevin Humphreys; SECOND --Tom Michalek centers for Steve Schneider and Jeff Perry; THIRD--Ted Weltzin at center for Jeff Logan and Bill Rothstein; FOURTH --Brian Burke at center for Kevin Naguski and Tom Farrell/Dick Olson. DEFENSE: FIRST -­] ohn Friedmann and Scott Cameron; SECOND Jeff Brownschidle and Jim Brown; THIRD --John Schmidt and John Cox. 
This new version of the Irish gets its ftrst test tonight and tomorrow at the ACC (broad­cast around campus on WSND AM 640) against ftfth place Michigan. Tech. Notre Dame and the Huskies split in early December up in snowy Houghton and Tech is never a team to be taken lightly. 
The Huskies bring the WCHA's top goal scorer, Gord Salt with 20, and freshman standout Rick Boehm to South Bend to highlight a tough forechecking team that has more than enough strength and size. They will provide a good test for Notre Dame's speed, especially with the · latest re-, arrangements. · 
But Michigan Tech is not the only opponent the Irish will face this weekend. After losing five of its last six and dipping noticeably in effectiveness, Notre Dame will also be up against the fact that they need to break out of the slump. 
Don't laugh at this notion.
