Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity at Purdue University has been disciplined by the Dean of Students office for hol<~ing a beer party. Stephen Akers, associate dean of students, said the frater­nity was being "deactivated" or barred from participation in cam­pus activities through August. Any failure in that perioQ to comp­ly with university regulations could result in Phi Kappa Sigma los­ing university recognition as a social fraternity, Akers said. He said the fraternity sent out flyers to various soroities, impling an open invitation to a party at the house on Jan. 15, resulting in a violation of the university's recommended 3: 1 ratio of guest to members at fraternity parties. The fraternity was involved in an "improper exchange of money" for beer at the party. Beer drinkers were reportedly asked to pay $1 for a plastic cup. John Hudson, fraternity president, claimed the money was being ac­cepted as donations to the "Roger B. Chaffee Scholarship Fund." Chaffee, one of the Purdue-educated astronauts, had been a member of the fraternity. He, fellow Hoosier Virgil "Gus" Grissom and Edward White II were killed Jan. 27, 1967, ina fire in a module while training as the crew for the first Apollo space flight. -AP

Ten years after COUP 

In the Soviet Union, every five years the mysterious 
Central Planner issues an aptly named "Five Year 
Plan." It is an occasion for optimistic predictions of 
prosperity for the comrades. Five years later, the fail­
ed quotas of the "Five Year Plan" are officially 
forgotten and a gleeful new plan is produced. 
Notre Dame has its own variation on the Soviet system. Roughly every ten years or so, an all­encompassing report on every facet and nuance of the University is compiled. The latest one is the highly touted, inconsequential PACE report. Ten years ago, however, it was the COUP' (Committee on University Priorities( report. It was c:ompiled by a group of ad­ministrators, faculty members, and students. Their challenge was to chart a policy that would take the school into the eighties. 
At the time, the University was financially weak. Since then, largely because of the recommendations by COUP, the endowment has been infused with hun­dreds of millions, most of which came from the ubi­quitous "Campaign for Notre Dame."

After the heady days of liberalism in the late sixties and early seventies, the authors of the report voiced concern for the colleges of Engineering and Science. Their worries have proved to be unwarranted since 

students  have  largely  returned  to  
potentially-profitable  career  pursuits.  And,  
although  women  had  just  been  admitted  to  the  
University,  the report showed  concern  that  female  

alums historically contribute less than males. The on­ly female member of the committee was Sister Madon­na Kolbenschlag. She was later denied tenure. 

The report stressed the need for increased minority enrollment. This was something that its author, and then Provost, Father James T. Burtchaell was cham­pioning to the consternation of many alums. Ten years later the minority population has shown little 
change.

Inside Tuesday 
Parts of the report are still relevant. Hall over­
crowding and a lack of social space are mentioned as 
problems. These problems still exist. The report 
recommends Exploration ofspecific ways of enhanc­
ing the intellectual role of the rector. The success of 
this scheme is debateable. 
COUP also explained the necessity of top-notch 
graduate programs. They attract high quality faculty 
and are the true centers of learning at a University. 
Yet last week, The New York Times reported on a 

survey of the top graduate schools in 33 fields. Notre 
Dame was mentioned only once, for Chemical 

Engineering. 
Coup bluntly stated the sorry condition of the 

library and called for marked increase in expen­
ditures. Like trashy Barbara Cartland novels, this 
complaint keeps recurring. The library still has an in­
ferior national ranking. And improvement plans are 
still circulating. 
In one area, COUP missed the mark. It questions 

the cultural, and educational value of the then money­
losing WNDU stations. Things have changed. The 
stations are now based in a fine new building, paid for 
from the profit~ generated by limiting the cultural 
contribution to profitable M*A*S* H reruns. 
However the educational aspects have been exploited 
to the benefit of numerous students and interns. 
One portion of the report obviously was left out of the copies distributed to the powers that be. "Open ar­chitectual competition might ensure the involvement of the widest range of architectual talents the country has to offer." "There are qualified persons on our campus who would gladly give their advice and use their talents to help the University in finding economical solution to its prati.::al problems of buildings and grounds." It is ironic that in the same issue of Notre Dame Magazine which printed these two statements, was a news blurb about the then just­completed renovation of the Law School -designed by, you guessed it, Ellerbe Architects. 
For the most part though, the COUP report had a remarkable effect. Several of the key goals mentioned in the report have been met. Expanded chemical research and engineering facilities, an enlarged art gallery, a fine arts facility, and a faculty office building, are all almost, if not already, completed. It has been said the COUP report primed the University to take off as a first-class institution. The question now is, will the new PACE report ignite the rocket or leave us on the pad? The Observer will be looking into this question in the weeks ahead.

Valenzuela seeks n1illion dollar contract 
NEW YORK (AP) -Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela asked yesterday that he be awarded a $1 million salary for 1983 as he formally filed for salary arbitration. The Dodgers reported­ly sibmitted a figure of $750,000. 
Both figures are the highest ever filed since salary arbitration was in­troduced in baseball in 1974. 
If agreement is not reached between the Dodgers and Valen­zuela before a hearing next month, an arbitrator will choose one of the two figures he was asked to con­sider. Either way, the salary will be the highest ever awarded through arbitration. 
Bruce Sutter, then a reliever with the Chicago Cubs, received $700,000 through arbitration in 1980. 
Valenzuela held out duringspring training last year, his second in the majors, and eventually settled for $350,000. He was not eleigible for arbitration until this year. 
Valenzuela had a 19 -13 record for the Dodgers last year, with an ERA of 2.87 and 199 strikeouts. 
Nolan Ryan of the HOuston Astros is the only pitcher to reach the $1 million-a-year salary level in the majors.

Dan Flynn, Glen Battle, and Blaise 
Harding were the other winners as 
each performed well in a 200-yard 
race. Flynn took first in the but­

backstroke race and Harding won 
the breaststroke. 
Things had turned out better. for 
the Irish against the Falcons of 
Bowling Green. Notre Dame open­
ed a large lead, powered by strong 
performances in the early freestyle 
events, and hung on to win the 'meet. 
This time it was Bohdan who 
grabbed two first-place finishes to 
lead the team. The sophomore 
standout shattered the varsity mark 
in the 1000-yard freestyle with a 
winning time of 10:02.24. His 
other victory came in the 500-yard 
free. 

Blaise Harding was also a double 
winner as he won the 200-yard in­
dividual medley and the 200-yard breaststroke. 
His brother AI made a fine show­ing by taking first in the 200-yard free and getting touched out in the 100-yard free for a second place finish. 
"There were a number of close finishes today," Irish Coach Dennis Stark said. "I was pleased to see such an enthustiastic performance. 
"It is good to start off like this after a long layoff." 
However, things did not go too well for the Irish women as they were soundly defeated by Bowling Green, 91-58. 
The Falcons who have been building a Mid-American Con­ference power in women's swimm­ing for the past few years, over­whelmed Notre Dame with their depth. The Falcons had eleven vic­tories and six 1-2 finishes, while the Irish could manage only six firsts. 
Karen Korowicki and Venette Cochiolo were triple winners for the Irish. Gina Gamboa was Notre Dame's only other individual win­

Super Bow/1983 


Dolphins seek glory days again 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first of four Super Bowl preview columns by Sports Editor Emeritus Skip Desjardin, who will be in Pasadena as pan of the Obsen·er's unprecedented coverage from the West Coast this weekend. 
A decade. 
Almost hair a lifetime for some of us. Even more 
than that for others. 
It has been ten years since the Mtami Dolphins did what, almost certainly, will never be done again. They went through the entire NFL season without los­ing a game. 
In the Los Angeles Coliseum, the Dolphins ­despite an ill-fated attempt to pass by a part-time tie salesman by the name of Yepremium and the resulting interception return. by Mike Bass -defeated the Washington Redskins, 14-7, in Super Bowl VII. 
They did it without their star quarterback. They did it with a defense so anonymous they became known as the "No-Name Defense." But they did it. 
And in a small town in Maine, a kid sat glued to the TV every Sunday, waiting for word. The same kid came running home from school on Thursdays, check­ing the mail for the clippings he knew were on the way from Florida. 
See, the kid had forsaken the Patriots and the Giants -the teams most New England youngsters pretended to be when the touch football games were played in countless backyards. 
Three years before, he had travelled to Florida, and his uncle had made him a Dolphin fan. Since then, the mail and brought weekly clippings, hats, T-shirts, and bumper stickers. Everything a long-distance Dolphin fan needed to root his team to victory. 
That Christmas, a new bike and a pile of other presents went largely unnoticed as the kid wandered around showing relatives his autographed copy of Larry Csonka's book. 
And when the Super Bowl rolled around, the kid got out the hats and the stickers and the pins and the pictures. He lined them all up in front of the TV ­"for luck."

Skip Desjardin 
Sports Editor Emeritus 
And it worked. Ten years have passed. Not too long ago, the kid came across a box that still contained all the clippings. 
There was Griese breaking his leg. There was Fer­nandez making the sack. There was Howard Twilley with the fingertip catch. 
And there was the picture. 
A kid and his uncle, resplendent in Dolphin T-shirts and hats, waving white hankies. 
Ten years is a long time. But the moment the pic­ture was taken is frozen in the kid's memory. 
See, Miami is a community of many retirees, and the uncle was among them. Many are no longer around to see the Dolphins every week -riding the bus to the game and sitting in the end zone -and the uncle is among them, too. 
Moments after the picture was taken, the kid and the uncle parted for the last time. 
This weekend, the Dolphins go back to Southern California. Back to the Super Bowl. Back to face the Washington Redskins. Ten years have passed, and many of the names have changed. 
Kiick and Warfield went to the WFL with Csonka. 
Morris was sentenced to prison this week on drug 
charges. Buonoconti is doing a weekly show on HBO. 
Little is a college coach. Scott was traded to the Red- skins before he retired. 
Now there is Duhe and Hardy and Woodley and Franklin. But Shula is still there. So are Kuechengerg and Den Herder. 
And the kid is still a Dolphin fan. 
Sunday, a white hankie will wave in the Rose Bowl -for the kid, and the uncle, and the time they've been apart.

The Notre Dame men's swim team, coming off of a long six­week layoff, returned to action over the weekend and was able to split a pair of meets, winning at home against Bowling Green before dropping a tough road meet to Ferris State. 
Both meets went right down to the wire and were marked by ex­citing finishes in many events as the Irish had to battle to hold off Bowl­ing Green, 58-55, on Friday and then travel to Ferris State the next day only to lose on the last event of the day. 
At Big Rapids, Mich., Notre Dame went into the final event, the 400-yard freestyle relay, tied with the Bulldogs. A victory would have swung the meet to the Irish.
