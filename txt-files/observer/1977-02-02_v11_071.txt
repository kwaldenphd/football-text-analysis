0-C holiday break-ins 
Police arrest suspects 
by Jack C. Silhavy Staff Reporter 

More precautions and coopera­tion with police are the best way to avoid break ins at off-campus student homes, South Bend police advise. 
This statement came after the round-up of several suspects in connection with the rash of burgla­ries at the residences of Notre Dame students and others during Christmas break. 
Detective Sergeants William Adelspe rger and Robert Tomas­zewski of the South Bend Police Department have already arrested six juveniles and one adult sus­pected of the burglaries. They still have papers to be processed for the apprehension of two more adult suspects. 
Six robberies have occurred since the seven suspects were taken into custody in the area and police hope the arrest of the two remaining adults will curb the problem. 
Well over $5000 in goods has been recovered and most of this has been returned to the owners. Must of the stolen goods will never be found though, Tomaszewski commented, due to lack of serial number identification. 
The detectives said they were lucky because one youth appre­hended told them exactly where he took individual items from. 
The recovered loot consists of stereos, televisions, clothing, household appliances, and many smaller items. 
'Roots' attracts largest TV viewing audience ever 
NEW YORK [AP] -The serializa­tion of "Roots" made television history last week, according to A.C. Nielsen figures made available today. 
Last Sunday's concluding episode was the all-time most watched show in America. In addition, four of the ten most watched shows in the history of television were episodes of the serialization of Alex Haley's novel. 
With "Roots" listed in last week's national prime-time aver­ages as seven of the top seven shows,ABC carried the entire week ending Jan. 30 with 16 of the top 16 shows. 
The concluding episode of "Roots" posted a 51.1 rating, meaning it was viewed in 36.4 million households. 
A Nielsen spokesman said it outpaced last fall's record-setting broadcast of "Gone With the Wind" on NBC. He said the rankings of the top shows in television history now stood this way. 
"Roots," Jan. 30; "Gone with the Wind-Part I;" "Gone with the Wind -Part II ;" "Bob Hope Christmas Special," 1970, "The Fugitive," 1967, and "Roots," Jan, 28, tied in fifth place; "Roots" jan. 27; "Bob Hope Christmas Special," 1971; "Roots" jan. 25; "Ed Sullivan Show," with the Beatles in 1964. and Super Bowl last month. 
.ABC said that during -the eight. 
Police believe at least ten stu­dent he .Ises were burglarized over Christmas break. Most of the burglaries were discovered by re­turning students, but some were discovered in progress or shortly afterward. 
Those first apprehended, on Jan. 21, implicated others and police began the round-up and recovery of goods. 
At the home of one suspect youth a four-year old girl pointed out suspected stolen goods being stor­ed openly in the living room. Most of the goods were recovered from persons who knowingly or unknow­ingly purchased them. 
Police described the youths as "bold," citing the case where youths carried a television for a number of blocks in a residential area at midday. 
Police have therefore asked peo­ple especially students, to be more observant of activities in their neighborhood. They stated that 85 per cent oftheburglaries take place in daylight. 
If people would report any suspicious activities, it would 
greatly  aid  police,  Adelsperger  
stated.  
"Students  should  look  out  for  

each other," he said, adding that by helping each other they would be helping themselves. 
Adelsperger and Tomaszewski also recommended students be more careful in taking down serial numbers and model numbers off all valuables in their house. Some sort of marking on each item would be an additional heln. 
nights "Roots" was aired starting Jan. 23, it was seen by 85 percent of the potential viewing audience, or 130 million persons at one time or another. 
It had an average 44.9 rating, which translates to 32 million homes, and was seen by an average of two-thirds of the televi­sion audience all week. 

Casey surveys HPC on social space 
byTomByme Contributing Editor 
Student Life Council Chairman Mike Casey requested the assis­tance of the Halt Presidents Coun­cil last night in resolving the problem of the lack of social space on campus. 
Casey, who is also Student Body Vice-President, distributed floor plans of each hall and asked the council members to measure the common rooms in their dorms. Noting that "some halls have more space than others,' he indicated the information gathered by the hall presidents would be used by the SLC in their study of the issue. 
Casey cited Pangborn, Sorin and Morrissey as halls with very little social space. He expressed his hope that upcoming proposals to tbe: SL~. w.ould h~lp re.m.edy the 

Notifying police before leaving for any period of time would aid their job too. Police would then check the house periodically. 
Adelsperger said most of the suspects live very close to the house they ''hit.'' They knew when students were around and when they weren't, he said. 
In most cases, robbers had been in the house at one time to see what valuables were in it and where, he said. This is mostly done at parties where burglars simply walk in and mingle with the guests "for a beer or two." 
With this in mind, students should inform the police before leaving town and again when they return. Adelsperger said names of landlords should also be furnished so they could be contacted to

Fuel Crisis triggers more steel mil/layoffs 
INDIANAPOLIS [AP] -The fuel crisis spawned by the coldest month on record deepened yester­day with more layoffs in the Indiana steel belt and a kerosene shortage that the governor's ener­gy aide said "is changing from critical to gruesome." 
William J. Watt, chief energy adviser to Gov. Otis R. Bowen, said suppliers didn't have enough kero­sene to get through the new month. 
Kerosene is a major heating fuel in rural areas, particularly in south­western Indiana, and in low­income, substandard housing. 
Bowen expanded his previous request to President Carter for federal disaster assistance in clear­ing snow-clogged state roads and moving food and fuel. Bowen sent Carter another letter late yesterday asking that federal programs such as loan guarantees be extended to individuals and businesses affected by the energy crisis. 
Even as the governor acted, the number who might qualify for the federal aid he sought was growing. 
John F. Coppes, director of the Indiana Employment Security Divi­sion, said the total layoffs the last two weeks because of the fuel and weather crisis topped 52,000, but didn't include 7,100 recalled to work since late last week. The recalls included 2,400 in Fort Wayne the last two days. 
The economic situation deterior­ated as the weather and other · conditions improved slightly. Temperatures inched into the 20s around the state, and the 
National Weather Service said the mercury would climb into the low 30s Wednesday. 
That was a welcomebeginningfor February after January, which the weather bureau said was the coldest month on record, with average temperatures almost 20 degrees below normal. The av­erage temperature at the weather service's four main reporting sta­tions were 8.4 degrees at Fort Wayne, 10.3 degrees at Indiana­polis, 12.3 at South Bend and 14.8 at Evansville. 
With all main state roads reopen­ed, 250 Indiana National Guards­men mobilized over the weekend were released from rescue and snow removal duty. Most schools reopened, many for the first time in weeks, and the last of stranded motorists left refugee centers at National Guard armories. 
Barge traffic, stalled on the frozen Ohio River for two weeks, began moving again,carryingvalua­ble fuel oil and salt for icy roads. 
But State Energy Director Tho­mas Kibler said the barges held little relief for Hoosiers. 
"The Ohio doesn't have either of the two fuels I need the most right now-kerosene and propane gas," Kibler said. 
"I've had 12 different requests today for kerosene that I cannot begin to handle. We haven't got the product to deliver to them." 
Watt said that with better wea­ther, officials hoped to divert more kerosene to residential use by reducing the amount used to dilute heavy diesel fuel in extreme cold.

problem. 
The survey of hall presidents follows a recent Student Govern­ment campuswide questionnaire concerning the use of the LaFor­tune Student Center, the largest single social area available to students. 
In other business, Student Union Administrative Coordinator Mary Charchut informed the HPC that no block seating would be available for the Feb. 28 appearance of the rock group "Boston" in the ACC. The Student Union had arranged for the halls to reserve large groups of seats for the same concerts last fall in order to prevent long ticket lines. 
Charchut added that the Student Union was exploring the possibility of obtaining block seating for the concert of "Electric Light Orches­tra", scheduled for March 26.

O'Lear also briefed the council on the progress of the Infirmary Advisory Board, a six-member committee designed to correct problems involving the campus infirmary. He reported that Uni­versity Physician Robert Thompson had suggested that some type of booklet describing campus medical services be distributed to students. O'Lear remarked that many stud­ents were probably unaware of the kind of health services available on campus. 
"This is a problem that we found and that the administrators fou­nd," said O'Lear. "Not enough people know that things like Psych Services exist.'' He added that instead of publishing a separate booklet on the infirmary, more extensive information n{ight be contained in the student handbook, duLac.

Twenty Notre Dame students are presently involved in a contest sponsored by General Motors Cor­poration (GM) to examine the present and future role of corpora­tions in the U.S. 
About twenty universities are participating in this program which will award $5,000 to th~ winning group. The Notre Dame students, mostly junior and senior economics majors, will receive University credit fm their work on the project. ·

Although the participants will receive credit for this special studies project, it involves no formal classroom setting. Professor Bonello contacted students that he felt would be interested in the topic and would provide a diversity of opinion. Once the group was formed, Bonello's function became that of an organizer, as the students themselves decided the direction in which they would work. 
The body split into two parts, .vith one group concentrating on research and the second working on drawing up and distributing a su~ey to sample the community's attitude toward corporations.

In an effort to improve the student social life, a local bar has planned an open partey, hoping to attract a wider variety of students along with their regular patrons. 
Senior Bob Smith, who organizes such parties, stressed that the idea is "not to have them (the students) get drunk or rowdy.'' Instead, he said, the parties will provide the opportunity to have a good time without spending a lot of money. The party will guarantee an unlim­ited amount of beer after payment of a cover charge. 
Energy bill snagged by amendment 

WASHlNGTON [AP] -The House 
gave President Carter new powers to deal with the nation's natural gas shortage yesterday but tacked 
on a price ceiling provision that 
delayed final congressional action on the emergency legislation. 
The House version of the bill, approved by 367 to 52 vote, contains an amendment tacked on during earlier committee delibera­tions that puts a price ceiling on gas purchased during the emer­gency. The Senate bill, approved Monday night by a margin of 91-2, contains no such provision. 
Efforts to reconcile the two versions began immediately but there were indications a House­Senate conference may be neces­sary to hammer out a compromise. An aide to Sen. Adlai Stenson (D-Ill.), the prime Senate sponsor of the legislation termed the House-passed measure "unaccepta­ble to the Senate." The Senate 
earlier  beat  back  an  attempt  to  
impose  a  similar  ceiling  in  its  
legislation.  

However, House Speaker Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill (D­Mass.) told reporters he was certain a quick compromise could be reached with the Senate. He claimed that there is "no great concern as far as the White House is concerned" over which of the two versions prevails. 
Congressional leaders had hoped to get the bill to the President yesterday, but the new snag could delay final action for a day or two, aides said. 
Both bills would give Carter the authority he sought to order gas moved from interstate pipelines where it is relatively abundant to those where supplies are so scarce that homes, hospitals and small business are threatened with cutoffs. 
Both Carter's original proposal and the senate bill would allow pipelines to buy gas through Aug 1 at the unregulated prices found in intrastate markets, where gas is currently produced and sold within the same state. 
But the House bill would set a ceiling price on these purchases of about $2.02 per thousand cubic feet. That is far above the $1.44 per thousanii cubic foot price that prevails in the federally regulated interstate pipeline market but still below the price charged in recent weeks in the unregulated intra­state market. Those prices have ranged up to $2.25 per thousand cubic feet. 
The House approved the bill after 40 minutes of debate in a speeded-up procedure that barred amendments from the floor and which required a two-thirds vote. 
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the chief House sponsor, said although the legislation would not solve long-range energy problems, it is "the best legislative response that could be developed in the limited time available."

The Northern Indiana State Hos­pital (NISH) and Developmental Disabilities Center is currently recruiting volunteer workers from the ND-SMC community. 
The hospital, located at 1234 N. Notre Dame Ave. on the corner of Notre Dame and Angela, treats mentally retarded children of all ages. 
According to Sally Glaser, occu­pational therapy assistant at the hospital and coordinator of the Notre Dame--NISH volunteer pro­gram, students are needed primari­ly to work in the rehabilitation department. This department con­sists of physical, occupational, and recreational therapy. 
Volunteers work with the child-· ren in a variety of programs, including both group and individu­al projects. Some of the activities in which ND-SMC students can help the children to participate are: 
Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, ice­skating, swimming, arts and crafts, music and Special Olympics Bas­ketball for boys and girls. 
Although a majority of these activities take place at the hospital itself, some are held at Logan Center, the A.C.C. and other nearby locations. 
Glaser stressed the fact that most of the actual volunteer work is done on a one-to-one basis between the retarded child and the volun­teer, and added, ·~Yotn' volunteer. participation is needed and will be rewarding to both you and the child, you work with." 
· Interested Notre Dame and St. Mary's students should contact Sally Glaser at 289-1408 or 234-2101 for further information. 

J-boards meet with 'resistance' 
byTomByme Contributing Editor 

Despite the efforts of Student 
Government Judicial Coordinator 
Bob Bode, the judicial boards in 
many halls have yet to be firmly 
established, in contradiction to the 
official disciplinary policy of the 
University. 
According to the University 
guidelines for disciplinary proce­
dure, listed in the student hand­
book do Lac, students subject to 
disciplinary action for violations of 
hall regulations may "choose to 
have their cases considered by the 
rector, provided the rector accepts. 
They will otherwise have their 
cases considered by the Hall 
board." 
Resistance from some rectors 
and lack of student interest, how­
ever have prevented the do Lac 
guidelines form becoming reality. 
"There hasn't been a formal 
resistance from the rectors but a 
sort of passive resistance," said 
Bode. "We had a meeting this fall 
between rectors and j-board chair­
men and only a little over half the 
rectors showed up. Of course, the 
ones that don't want to use the 
j-board don't come. Basically the 
rectors are kings in their halls, 
especially the more established 
ones." He added that the more 
recently appointed rectors seemed 
to be more receptive to the concept 
of judicial boards. 
Bode indicated that the Flanner 
judicial board was in the  'worst 
shape" of any hall board. 
Peter Arden, chairman of the 
Flanner judicial board, explained 
that Fr. John Mulcahy, rector of 
Planner, was opposed to the idea of 
j-boards. "He wants to handle 
everything personally. If some­
thing comes up, he won't tell the 
person involved that there is a 
j-board." 
Mulchay refused to comment on 
the matter. 
While other rectors are more 
favorable to the presence of judicial 
boards in their halls than Mulcahy, 
several are reluctant to grant 
extensive responsibilities to what is 
a relatively unproven body. To 
prevent irresponsible action on the 
part of the board, some do as 
Pangborn Rector Fr. James Riehle 
and reserve the right to veto 
j-board decisions, fearing that they 
might be "too severe." 
Another impediment to the de­
velopment of judicial boards is the small number of infractions in . many halls. Parietal and drug-re­lated offenses are technically Uni­versity violations and as such must 
be immediately sent to the dean of students. Violations of "the good order of the hall" serious enough to warrant a j-board hearing are uncommon in many dorms. 
Students in many cases find the judicial board process less conven­ient than a relatively quick decision by the hall staff. "The hall has expressed no real interest in the j-board," said Dillon Rect11r Fr. Daniel Jenky. "People have tended to let violations be handled by the staff." 
"I don't really think too many students are interested in it," remarked Riehle. 
"I think most students would prefer the rector to hear their case," said Fr. Matthew Miceli, rector of Cavanaugh. "Generally rectors are understanding. The students would prefer to do it quietly." He added that the "hoopla" surrounding a j-board proceeding often made the student apprehensive, and causes him to prefer a hearing by the hall staff. 
Bode noted that the judicial boards in women's dorms rarely hear a case because there are so few violations. He speculated that women were "clever enough not to get caught." 
But although many hall judicial boards have been dormant a few have been active throughout the year, particularly in Keenan. 
Fr. John Conyers, rector of Keenan, commented that the judi­cial board concept was "very important." 
The judicial board is an operation

Mondale returns from world trip 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Vice-Pres­ident Walter F. Mondale returned home yesterday from his ten day mission to Western Europe and Japan, proclaiming that "all of our relations with our friends are on the firmest. most optimistic basis." 
Mondale arrived at Andrews Air Force Base from Tokyo where he met with Japanese Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, the final session in a series of talks with leaders in his diplomatic debut that took him to Brussels, Bonn, Rome Paris, Lon­don and the Japanese capital. 
Mondale's wife, Joan, gave him a hug as he stepped off the airplane and President Carter greeted him. 
"We were received warmly," Mondale told Carter, reciting the cities that he visited on the tour. There is a spirit of optimism among our friends inspired by your leader­ship." 
<:arter, with Mondale at his side, said of the vice-president, "He's done an absolutely superb job. He has made me and the nation proud. 
My only order to him is to go home and get some rest." 
In an interview during the flight home, Mondale told reporters a­board Air Force Two that his mission "opened up close consul­tations and personal relations be­tween a new governmet in the United States and our-traditional allies and friends in Western Europe and Japan." 
The key discussion topics, as outlined by Monda!~ at the start of the 22,215-mile journey, were the upcoming summit conference, co­ordination of economic . policies, and nuclear proliferation. Each was dealt with successfully, he said yesterday. 
It is expected now that the summit will be held in London and that an announcement on its tim­ing, possibly mid-May, and loc­ation will be made within the next ten. 
Mondale was to report to Carter this morning at the White House. 
During the trip, Mondale said he won from West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and French Pres­ident Valery Giscard d'Estaing the promise to talk more about limiting nuclear proliferation. 
France and West Germany have deals in the works to sell nuclear equipment to Pakistan and Brazil, respectively. 
The new vice-president, for 12 years a senator from Minnesota, found himself ina new role on the diplomatic stage. He said in the interview that he expects to be given future foreign assignments but that they would most likely focus on specific problems. · 

His trip included a visit to the Berlin wall, to emphasize con­tinued U. S. support for West Berlin, an audience with Pope Paul VI and a brief meeting with Geir Hallgrimson, the prime minister of Iceland, while the plane was re­fueled in Keflavik on the 20-hour trip from Paris to Tokyo.

Sociology club announces appointment and prepares for February convention 
Sociology Club President Ed Singer announced Monday the appointment of Lisa Luccarelli to fill the newly created Sociology Club office of administrative assist­ant. 
Luccarelli's role in the club will be largely concerned with handling matters of publicity, as well as providing assistance to the other officers. 
The Sociology Club also an· nounced the Alpha Kappa Delta (AKD) Mini-Convention for Feb. 
19. Alpha Kappa Delta is the National Sociology Honor Society. 
Hearing on nuclear plant postponed by commission 
PLAINFIELD, Ind. AP Public Service Indiana (PSI) opposed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's decision to postpone hearings on the proposed Marble Hill power plant, wiring Chairman Marcus 
A. Rowden yesterday that the delay "virtually assures large areas of Indiana of a very serious shortage of electric power in the early 1980's." 
''Already this project is nearly one year behind schedule, and we see no way for us to meet the energy needs of our customers if plagued by further delay," wrote PSI Chairman Carroll H. Blan­char. 
"Current heating fuel problems are a mild foretast of the impact on jobs and economy if we, run short of electric energy," he predicted. 
The NRC hearings, which were scheduled to begin Feb. 15, could have been a large step toward federal approval of the $1.5 billion nuclear project, planned for a site ten miles southwest of Madison, along the Ohio River. 
The delay was greeted happily by environmentalists and other Kentucky and Indiana, groups opposed to the project, which would be located 31 miles upstream from Louisville. 
The hearings postponement, which a federal spokesman said might mean nothing more than a procedural delay of "a couple of months,'' was apparently the result of PSI's failure to list the Wabash

Students should also inform neighbors when leaving and ask them to watch the house. "The 
biggest asset we've got is people," Adelsperger stated. 
Patterned after last year's AKD Regional Convention held at Notre Dame, the mini-convention is a prelude to the 1977 Regional Sociology Convention to be spon­sored by the Sociology Club on April 1. 
All students are invited to submit papers they have written for any sociology or anthropology courses. They should notify the Sociology Office in 325 O'Shag. by Feb. 9 of their intention to submit a paper. 
The club also wished to remind members that all AKD fees are due by Feb. 7, in the Sociology Office. 
There will be an informal gather· 
Valley Power Association ana the East Kentucky Power Cooperative as co-applicants as required by federal law. 
Original plans called for PSI to own 65 per cent of the plant, with the remaining 35 per cent owned by Wabash Valley and East Kentucky along with the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO). However, NIPSCO later relinqui· shed its ownership role. 
Blanchar's telegram noted that PSI had yet to receive official notification of the postponement, only learning of it "via rumors and news media inquiries.'' 
"Regulatory delays in our pro­ject to date, some of which have resulted from overzealous regard for irresponsible nuclear opposition have added more than $100 million to the total project cost," Blanchar said. He called on Rowden's "sense of fair play and under­standing of energy realities," to get the hearings underway Feb. 15 as scheduled. 
Darby O'Gill throws party 
Darby O'Gill, the celebrated proprietor of Darby's Place, has invited the University community to his seventh birthday party. The party will be held tonight in Darby's Place beginning at mid­night. Cake and refreshments will be served. O'Gill issued the invitation through his spokesman, Fr. Robert Griffin, University chaplain. He stressed that he saw nothing arrogant about throwing a party in his own honor. "I want to squelch the rumor that I'm an arrogant s.o.b.," he said. "An s.o. b. perhaps, but never arrogant." 
Joe Gill, Darby's Place manager, will hold a wake for his hometown, Buffalo, after the party.

Nazz does well in opener, draws large student crowds 
The Nazz concluded its Grand Opening this weekend with im­pressive performances by Cincin­nati's Arnie Brav. The talented singer-guitarist delighted audien­ces with folk-rock show consisting of music by Gordon Lightfoot, John Denver, Dave Loggins and some excellent original material. 
Last Tuesday night Billy Adams and Bill Mahn presented the first student performances of the sem­ester. Bill Mahn entertained the crowd with a superb Bob Dylan­Beatles sound. The Nazz received a sprinkling of British rock with Billy Adams' Peter Townshend/Jimmy Page renditions. 
John Steinman presented a large Wednesday night crowd with some impressive finger-picking and vocal work, focusing primarily on Lennon and Mcartney compositions. The Thursday night audience welcomed­the superior acoustic guitar work of Dave Shaheen and Greg Mandoli­ni. The evening was highlighted with an excellent recital of Ian Anderson's "Thick as a Brick." 
Standing-room-only crowds jam­med the Nazz Friday night when the Notre Dame Jazz Combos hit the stage. The Nazz staff is pleased to announce that the Jazz Combo will return this Friday night for 
another performance.

WASHINGTON (AP) -The Carter administration plans to ask Con­gress this week for authority to re-organize the executive branch of government, White House aide Jack H. Watson said yesterday. 
Watson said the administration will seek the same author.iqr which Congress gave former President Richard M. Nixon in 1~ for reorganization changes. 
Under the authoricy given Nixon and, other preside~ in the past, changes could be ~ade within Cabinet departments and take ef­fect in 60 days unless vetoed by Congress. 
Watson, President Carter's as­sistant for intergovernmental rel­ations, spoke at a meeting of about 600 city and county officials here for the annual federal briefing of the National Association of Reg­ional Councils. 
He drew loud applause when he said the administration is going to make an all-out assault on federal regulations, forms and reporting requirements. 
He recalled that at first Cabinet 
meeting of the new administration, 
President Carter said "There are 
too many lawyers in the federal

Bill  Murray,  organizer  of  the

Gerni will pull about 30 shots out of his 170-shot repertoire tonight, complete with humor and the history behind each shot, according to Murray. 
Having ~tarted playing pool at the age of 6, Gerni won his first championship only a year later. He has achieved the status of World Champion twice and has won the 
U.S. Masters Tournament and the 1975 European Championships. Gerni, 28, has also hosted his own pocket billiards television show. 
In addition to his billiards a­chievements, Gerni also holds bachelors degrees in marketing and economics and a masters in comsumer affairs, all from Purdue U nivers: i:y.
