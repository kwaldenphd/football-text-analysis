South Bend beer distributor may be cause 
h~ Hob Mader Starr Rl"porter 

A South Bend beer distributor's representative may have m­fluencedMichigan authorities to deny the liquor license request for the Irish Wake. Irish Wake com­mittE-e members said yesterday. 
The representative was out of town yesterday and unavailable for comment. 
The Irish Wake is now ten­tatively scheduled for Saturday night in Stepan Center. 
Wake committeeman Alan Roehl 
was contacted Tuesday by Michael 
Corn. the "Notre Dame 
Michigan where the beer would be purchased. Wake committee mt-mbers stated Corn's primary association is with Sunnyside 
beverages in South Bend. 
Corn call~>d Roehl Tuesday af­tl.'rnoon and informed him that the party could be held at the Michigan site but the Michigan State Police \I.Ould arrest Irish Wake com­mittee members and Conservation Club officials. 

At the same time Corn suggested a park on the far east side of South BPnd where the Wake could be held without police interference. if the· Wakt-were held at this South Bend to the Niles police, the Michigan State Police and Samuel Egan of the Niles Liquor Control Board had proved fruitless. 
Pears said he tried to dissuade Gibson and obt-ain the permit. "I told him An Tostal is a fun weekend," Pears commented, "and it would be wound up with a party which would be well chaperoned. The party would be legally conducted with a beer license." 
Pears also said he talked to a Mr. Lake at the Conservation Club who said the Club would cooperate in ~vry way and offered to request 
Roehl contacted another beer distributor in Dowagiac after his conversation with Corn. The distributor said Corn had already called him and said the Wake committee had been denied the license. 
Committeeman Bob Quakenbush upon calling Gibson was told that tht> license was denied because of the size of the crowd. "He told me that the crowd would increase by :lO percent with minors sneaking in." Quakenbush said. "Then I told him we would have it in a large tent and check for school ID's at the entrance. He told me fit in the tent." 

Roehl was told by Corn that he'd attempt to arrange use of the South Bend park for Roehl. Roehl has not been contacted yet. Corn, who has handled beer arrangements for Armory Parties, is out of town on a vacation. 
Committee member Betsy Kall said the most likely alternative available is to hold the Wake in Stepan Center and serve "mixers". Admission will be $1.00 and the Pezband from Chicago will play as planned. 
Committee members said they "'ill still attempt to get a license for

Seventh in a series 
Starvation topic of panel discussion 
by :\lary Pat Tarpt'.' 
Starr Rt>portt>r 
"The Chinese Case", the seventh of a series of panel discussions on ' Epidemic Starvation, centered around the history and agricultural conditions of the H<>public of China. The panel, led by Prof. Basil O'Leary fo the Non­Violence Program and including Prter Moody from the Gevernment Ikpartment, Yu-Ming Shaw of the lh•partment of History, and William Liu, director of the Center for the Study of Man in Con­temporary Society. 
SpPaking in O'Shaughnessy Hall Thursday night, Shaw opened the discussion with a brief historical outline bPginning with the r<>volution ird by the Nationalist's Party in 1911, which overthrew the dynasty systrm. He stated that the basic problems which have trubled the country sincd the founding of thP H<>public are political unity, social cohesion, and the economic problem dealing with feeding the population. 
"The missionaries say that God mut have loved the Chinese the most because he gave them so manu people. God didn't give the same special help to them to feed so many people. So the problem of any Chinese govern­mPnt since the beginning of the 20th century was to feed their millions of people and make them happy," stated Shaw.

Shaw Pxplained how these problPms lPd to the formation of th ChinPse Communist Party. His prPsPntation continued with a dPscription of the different periods of Communist China and con­cluded with reflections on Maoism. II<> pointed out that he believes the organization of the peasants to be lhP driving force in solving major <>conomic and social problems. 
Mao made the modification of 
t>mphasizing the peasant and their 
role. The peasants can be made 
into main forces in a revolution. 
lthhink the greatist contribution of 
Mao is his main emphasis on the 
pt>asant... 
Moodv followPd with a con­tinuation of the history of Red China but with a different ap­proach. He briefly covered the distribution systems and agricultural policies established in China from the early 1950's to 1969. H<> also Pxpressed his view on the collective system and communal type living. 
Liu described the different agricultural regions of China which deal mainly with wheat and rice. Commenting on this arrangement, Liu said, sub­rPgions of agricultural production w<>re stable no matter what they wt>re politically." 
OthPr topics covered during the course of the panel and the question pPriod afterwards in-eluded the health picture of China with its innovative medical supply transportation system to the rural areas, the irrigational im­provemrnts, the welfare system, and a revolutionary outlook on family planning. 
Moody stated in reference to the eoncept of perfect man, "The t>nergies of the people are directed to work for the good of the Ht>public. It is the idea of developing an entirely new man, an unselfish man, yet evidence is ample to prove that he hasn't been born." 
ThP t>ighth part of the Epidemic Starvation series, entitled "Multinational Corps" will be held on April 21.

The Parents Council of Saint l\1ary's College met Friday and Saturday placing most of their emphasis on the Career I>Pvelopment office and the Piection of new co-<:hairmen. 
The Parents Council is made up of 25 to 30 couples who have daughters attending SMC. chosen by the College President as representatives of all of the students' par«:>nts. Their duties include supporting and advising the college. 
Tht•ir meeting began Friday afternoon with new programs being explained by administration members. Later, individual committees of the Council met. These mt•etings continued Saturday morning followed by I alks given by SMC student leaders t·oncerning their relationship and position to the Parents Council.

The Plected co-<:hairmen for futur«:> Par«:>nts Councils were Mr. and Mrs. Max Gabreski, who are to take over next year, and Mr. and Mrs. Whilliam Shemer, who will take over the year after next. 
The main discussion of the meeting center«:>d on the Career l>PvelopmPnt office. First, per­sonnel from the office talked with the Council in depth about their work and what the parents could do to assist them. This was followed by an intra-council discussion on the topic.

"ThP Career Development office is part of the Student affairs departmt>nt." explained Sr. Lynch. 
"The Council was concerned with finding ways of supporting it more Pffectively so that the office may better serve the students," she added. 
Also during the two days of the Parents Council, SMC Sophomore Parents Weekend was held. When asked if the two events conflicted, Sr. Lynch responded, "Both events wPre timed like that so that part>nts of sophomores serving on 
the Council could attend both. Normally the Parents Council mPt>ting would have lasted only one day, but we spread it out over two so that these parents could attend everything." 
Commenting on the overall results of the meeting, Sr. Lynch said,"! thought it went very well.

P.O. Box Q 
Grad 

Priorities 
lll'ar l·'•litur. 
I>ue to !he controversy ovPr housing. University priorities with n·spPct to graduate vs. un­dt'rgraduate. the Graduate Student l 'nion ·s 1GSU l activities (or lack of l. and graduate student living in general. I feel it is necessary to attempt to clear the air and focus 
on the major issues involved. 
First graduate students are older and have generally demonstrated their ability; in terms of educational fitness, maturity, responsibility, and experience. Due to their com­mitment toward their career training, graduate students usually have definite and clearly defined goals and priorities. As such, graduate study takes into account the natural reality that, when seen from an educational viewpoint, the graduate student and the undergraduate student tend to reflect divergent and sometimes totally alien per­spectives, that these individual student groups are differentiated on the basis of their disparate social. cultural, political, and economic orientation toward life, and that each of these groups embodies divergent systems of values and norms of behavior which not only differ from the other's system (and in some spheres quite significantly), but which affix in each separate student group a characteristic impreo;sion on the personality and educe~tional development of its members. The above statement does not require that one group be judged in comparison to another with respect to University resources. For an outstanding university such as Notre Dame needs the dedicated and sincer input of both groups. Con­sequently. the problem is not so much one of University priorities 
toward determing resource allocation as one of inclusion into 
DOONESBURY 

the decision making process which will in turn determine resource allocation as well as define resource content. 
Secondly, the assumptions that 1a l the major concern of advanced 
• students is to obtain a degree and 1b l due to the intensity of their program 1increased pressure of grades. studies, etc.) social, political, and cultural con­tributions toward the University eommunity are not important or are Sl'\'t'rt'l~· limited by a time constraint are a fallacy. Both of these assumptions imply that our role at Notre Dame is specifically limited to specialization and that as a result we are simply technicians. 
In my opinion our task should be educational preparation for the total life experience; to gain ex­posure to experiences we can utilize and reflect back on when we 
rPtin·. experiences that can serve us when we relax and during our spare time, and experiences to help us appreciate life around us. For we will, in all likelihood, never have the opportunity again to combine educational specialization with social and cultural enrichment on the level that it is presented to us in a university environment such as Notre Dame offers. It is my belief that one of the problems now present in society today. as depicted by Watergate, is the training of technicians--people who have little or no formal exposure and perception of society's moral values, direction, and content. Notre Dame offers us the unique opportunity of its "Catholic character." Something that those of the Catholic religion can explore and become more intimately .in­volved with and those who are non­Catholic can explore and may ultimately appreciate. 
Thirdly, what is the position of the graduate student at Notre Dame? The administration. in my view, has indicated very explicitly what its position is, i.e., via the Lewis Hall decision, the exclusion of a GSU representative from the meeting of University officials

Wrong Premises 
Bt>ar Editor: 
Your recent SLC editorial camP to somP correct conclusions, but it Pvolved from faulty 
prPmises  which  we  could  have  
corrected  if WP  had  been  con­ 
sulted.  

Quoting from your editorial, "A popular Pxplanation was that the SLC was not a legislative body, but a problem-solving one." Describing the explanation as "popular" suggests that it was the best and possibly the only one givPn Ino others wPre mentioned in the editorial. l 
We felt that in order to rPgenPrate interest and encourage potential leaders to run, a reduction in the number of studPnts on the board was t>ssential. Now. an aspiring candidate will havP to do more than carry his or her own hall to take a seat. she-he must win an PntirP quad. The elections will gPnerate interest and the representatives themselves will lParn and communicate a lot more in thP coursP of their campaigns. 
By reducing our size to fifteen we will be required to solicit outside assistance for committee work, a positive pffect we did foresee when considt>ring the change. 
Our impact as a legislative body is Pntirely dt>pPndent upon how WP arP perceivPd by Fr. HPsburgh and thP Board of Trustees. We feel confidPnt that by reducing the SLC's numbers tothe council will hecomP more dficiPnt and its work will be of better quality. 
Five students can rPpresent 6600 studPnts as effectively as Pight studPnts can. so the h·gislativP crPdibility is not at all impaired by last Monday's decision. In fact, by decreasing the number we can increase the visibility and ac­countability each board member will have with his or her ~n­stituency, thereby improving our IPgislative clout. '"

Renovation 
ran blil:ch 

lldore spPaking of thP LaFortunP renovation, onP should be aware nf thP prol'Psses that haw lTPatPd it. ThP history of thP rPnovation hpgins in !ht' fall sPmPstPr of 1972 wht'n a group of intPrPsted studt•nts formPd the LaFortunP Hmovation ('ommittPP with the purpose of P\·aluating lhP t'xisting facilitiPs and dt>tPrmining a tuturt· courst' of action. lw it rPnovation or new construction. li<·nm·ation was chosPn lweausP of thP sound structural and historieal qualities of lhP original building. thP considerablP eost of sa\·ing on·r a nPw building. and becausP of adequatP space within tlw building with which to work. 
~pring st'mPstPr of 197:3 saw thP formation of LaFortunP l:<·nm·ation :\rchi!Pets. Inc .. composed of fourth-yPar architPcture studPnt K<'n Knt'\'l'l and sophomorP architPcts HoxannP Jabbra and m~ sl'!f. .\I lhP Pnd of the sPmPslt•r. April 1973. thP combinPd <·ommittPt'S prPst'n!Pd their plans to thP Board of TrustPPS. ThP Trusfl•ps appron•d thP coneept of the renovation and wt•rp VPry ph•asl'd \\·ith !ht• work that had bPPn donP. . 
Ttw fall of 1973 and spring of 1974 wt•re involvPd in attPmpts to ;1equin• funding for the projPct. finally accomplishPd at thP spring Hoard of Trusll•ps mPeting. wht>rP $250.000 was allocated for the n•no,·ation of tht• lluddlP. studPnt offices. and main loungP. ThP li<·no\·ation ('ommittPP was ht>aded by fifth-yPar architPcture st udmt Kt•n Knt'vPl: Blitch and Jabbra being in Home for :lrd yPar ;throad studit's. 
This~ Par has sPPn ,·pry little intPrPst or involvemPnt by studPnts 111 1hP projPl'l. which is now partially funded and progrPssing as 
plannt•d in April of 1973. Tht> only mt•mbers of thP original com­llllftt'P arP Hoxanm• Jabbra and mysplf who. havP solely bt>en in­\ oln·d in thP implPmmtation of tht> plans. With this history pn•st•nlt'd. tht• curn•nt status of the rPnovation ocan bP PxplainPd. 
l'art of lht' $250.000 which was allocated has bt>Pn usPd to com­ph•fp thP nPw publication and studPnt union-govPrnment offices on 1lw sPcond and third floors of LaFortunP. ('urrPntly. the main loungP is ht•ing rPnovatPd. delayPd by a furniturP holdup (the 
.,furniture is now t'XpPeted to arrivP May 10). ThP banners and plants schedulPd for thP main loungP arP being installed shortly. to <'omplt•tt· thP nPw lighting-painting-graphics and carpeting. 1\••no\'ations as a rule arP subjPct to dt>lays because of the many dillt·n·nt intt•n•sts involved. Nonetheless, the final product will be ;1 rdketion of tht• original plans and philosophy. 
Tlw futurt' of the Huddle is currently in limbo, as no final dt•eisions have hen made by the Office of Business Affairs as to the I~ pt• of food sPrvice to be employed. There is little hope that the ! !uddlt' will bP renovated this summer -the longer the delay -the highPr the cost will be. A scramblP s~st!'m similar to that t•mployed by the South Dining Hall was proposPd two ~·pars ago hut was eonsiderPd unfpasiblP by the Husint•ss :\!fairs OfficP. Current planning is towards a fast food ":\ldlonalds-BurgPr Chpf" typP operation. HopPfully decisions \\ tlllw madP quickly to PXpPdite thP Huddle's completion.

ford visit revisited 
fr. bill toohey 
If anyone was aglow and atingle over 

Prt>sident Ford's visit to the campus, they 
will probably not like this column (and are 
advist>d to go immt>diately to the sports 
pagP. l 
WP say we are a place' of learning. Yet 

littlt>, if anything, has been said about the 
Ford visit: no investigative reporting by 
this newspaper; no effort, that I know of, on 
the part of those who invited the President 
and arranged for his visit to find out the 
university's reactions and impressions. 
Whether we like it or not, people learned 

lots of things from that E'Xperience; and it 
st>Pms inPxcusable for us not to at least 
surface some of it for consideration. Having 
said that, I immediately insist that this 
column doesn't pretend to be anything more 
than one small effort to bring together some 
of the main themes and principal ob­
st>rvations that I have picked up in listening 
to mPmhers of this community these past 
thrt>e wPeks since the Ford Visit. 
I have sensed that a good many of the faculty and students have grave reser­\·ations about what struck them as an ex­cercise in granting favors in order to gain favor. They sense that we were being used and manipulated; that, as one faculty mPmher put it. "lt is just possible that Ford understood and used academia much better than wt> understood him and his purpose for the visit." 
ThPre seems to be little objection to in­viting the President to the campus, but only in allowing him to shape the occasion to his own political purposes. Thus, for example, WP see what a mistake it was to bestow an honorary degree on the President. There was no necessity for such a move. No one will buy the argument that we had no choice: that you do that sort of thing, as a matter of course. when a President visits. The national publicity in a visit to Notre DamP <on St. Patrick's day yet!) was quit1• sufficit•nt for Ford's purposes. 
So there was great advantage for Ford ­just in coming. By granting him a degrE>e, wt· got caught in the trap of having to dream up something for which to honor him, when what wE>should have hoped for was some 
halfway decent commitment for future action. Consequently,the citation for the honorary degree E>nds up a literary stret­ching and twisting, a scrounging for 
-;oml'lhing to say that would not immediately provoke waves of heartburn in the audience. It didn't really succeed. What are we going to honor him for? His reactionary record in congress? His efforts to impeach Justice Douglas? His attempts to cut health and Pducation programs? His rationalizing of our illegal and immoral intervention in Chile by saying that communist nations operate the same way? His appointment of NPlson Rockefeller. who will be remem­herPd in history for his promotion of abortion and his responsibility for the Attica Tragl'dy. 
Ill'spPratl' for something for which he can he commended, we applaud him for his dt>rnPncy program-which is great, if what thP country needs is a clemency program. l'nfortunately, what we need is an amnesty program. a quite different thing. Ford's demt>ncy program reached only about 18 per cent of those eligible. That's lamentable mough: but. what too few people seem to appreciate. some 500,000 young men with lt>ss-than-honorable discharges were not Pven t'ligible for this program. Ford's continuing rl'fusal to grant amnesty to thousands of men exiled from their loved om•s, makE's his pious words about recon­ciliation a mockery. 
Another favor granted was an opportunity to present a "major address," to be known henceforth as "Ford's Notre Dame speech." 
That's a very risky thing to do; and many members of this community breathed a sigh of rt>lief that it wasn't as bad as it might have been. The President did say some good things about interdependence and concern for other notions, especially the poor and oppressed. But the spt>ech was filled with platitudes, and generalities and at least one devastating half-truth. 
By speaking in generalities, the President made it possible for people to .interpret ke~ points in a variety of ways. You could almost hear the shudders in the audience when he said: "We must continue to sup­
port security against aggression and sub­version." People prepared themselves for the worst -a hard-sell for more military hardware for Thieu. When he didn't follow through, we relaxed and naively thought we had bPen spared the obscenity. Hut that was before the press conference. That's when Ford gave clarity to his generalities; and any hope that the national press would give more than scant attention to his con­vocation talk was destroyed. 
Surt> t-nough, the next day papers across the country\\ l'rt' ht-adlining the fact that at Notre Damto PrE>sident Ford revived the old "domino theory," and that other cold-war favoritt>: opposition to foreign aid programs to countriE>s like South Viet Nam and Cambodia is t>vidPnce of an alarming rE>vival of American "isolationism." About this, James Reston, of the New York Times, wrote: "Thest> are the vivid simplistic analogies of the Hitler thirties and the Stalin fortie~. but in the mid-sl'vPntit>s. it's like saying that if Notre Dame loses one game, all othE'r games are lo~t ... 
rtw tragic half-truth haJ to do with his magnanimous announcement that his Administration has increased U.S. assistance by $600 million. What he failed to acknowlE>dge. howE>ver. was the fact that, of tht> 5.5 million tons of food allocated for 1975, less than half has bePn shipped. And a lot of it probably won't be shipped. And what does gl't shipped reaches "political interest countrit>s" much more rapidly and ef­ficiently than those countries listed by the liN as "most sE>riously affected·' by hunger. 
OnE' also detects considerable dismay on campus ovE>r the fact that the President's visit was prE>sented under the rubric of a strictly academic occasion. Faculty and students have serious doubts about the genuinenE>ss of this claim. As onE' person put it. "Most of the arrangements were designE>d to kPE'p studE>nts and faculty away from Ford rather than bringing us into a 
serious discussion and scholarly exchange <or isn't that 11:hat thE' university is all about?>." 
If President Ford's visit was to somehow begin to bridge that gap between the world of academia and the world of government tan admirable goa)), surely it implies passagE> in both directions. How great it would have been if representative students had had the chance for somE' honest sharing with Mr. Ford. In light of what might havE' been. we can appreciate the disappoinlmPnt wht-n an authentic cross-section of student leadE>rs was preventE'd from meeting with thE' President. They WE're told that this was bt'causP of the "strict acadE>mic naturt'" of the occasion. StudE>nt disillusionmt•nt hE>camP complete when '.hey discovered that the first persons with whom President Ford mE>t after his :\< '( • ·'PPE'Ch were mt>mbers of our athletic coaching staff. No student begrudges our hPad coaches an opportunity to meet the l'n•sidmt But to PXcludP kE>y student !E>adE>rs from thE' sam!' priviledgp undt-r a claim that tht> t'vt>nt is strictly academic. strikes tht>rn as pure hull< or. if you prefer the nicE>ties, un­conscionable dissemblance.> 
This lack of candor seernE>d to pE>rrnE>ate the day. There was a phoniness, an aura of thE' unrE>al, about the whole thing. People WPre so uptight you could hear them squeak. 
Nothing should happen so that the l'n•sidl~'nt should bE' Prnbarrassed -by a hard question. an honest opinion, a probing cornrnPnt. I was informed there was even a question about hanging a partieular painting whert> Ford would dine. The painting, they said, was considered too provocativE': it containE>d a message; it might make sornl'one uneomfortab!P. 
Finally. library personnel report that the 1-'ord Administration take-over of the campus was so complete that White House aids made the Provost remove his pots and pans from the kitchen of the 14th floor of tht> library.<You should have picketed, .Jim'>
