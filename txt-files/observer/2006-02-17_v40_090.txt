Rape prevention is common goal 
with student government and the Orestes Brownson Council -a campus group dedicated to the study of traditional Catholic teachings -to collab­oratively host a fundraiser for groups that benefited finan­cially from previous years' pre­sentations of "The Vagina Monologues." 
Student body president Dave Baron said representatives from Feminist Voice, Hight to Life, the Orestes Brownson Council and student govern­ment met Feb. 8 to discuss a way -a benefit formal -to raise funds for sexual assault prevention in an attempt to replace those not earned from this year's "Monologues," held in DeBartolo Hall Monday through Wednesday.

Amid 'Monologues' controversy, groups fight campus violence

Assistant News Editor 

While the production of "The Vagina Monologues" has long been a polarizing issue on campus, one of the play's stat­ed goals -stopping sexual violence against women -is a constant objective at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. And various organizations on both campuses are making efforts to emphasize it, whether or not they support the play.

Junior parents pour onto campus for weekend event

The parents of Notre Dame juniors have migrated annual­ly to South Bend for Junior Paronts Weekond since 1952, when University President Emoritus Father Theodore llnsburgh wanted juniors' par­ents to have the opportunity to take part in their child's Notre Dame life prior to graduation. 
More than 1 ,200 families an1 scheduled to arrive in the South Bend area today to cele­bratn the 54th annual Junior Parents W11eknnd (.JPWI. This year's .JI'W theme, "Traditional Notre Dame," 1nnbraces the true nature of' tho three-day gathering -for parents to experience the spir­itual, soeial and academic aspects of Notre Dame. 
JPW 2006 chairperson Marri Kajfez, a junior herself, expressed enthusiasm for the weekend and all its family-ori­ented events. 
"We hope that the juniors and their parents enjoy the traditional Notre Dame that we have sewn through our events," she said. ''I'm really excited to see all the parents that are going to be here expe­riencing Notre Dame in such a unique way." JPW kicks off at 9 p.m. today with the Opening Gala, a for­mal event at the Joyce Center to include dancing, a cash bar, hors d'oeuvres and portrait photography. On Saturday morning, the College of Science, College of Engineering, College of Arts and Letters and Mendoza College of Business will hold Collegiate Workshops for their students in which juniors and parents will hear faculty addresses and attend depart­mental presentations. Juniors and parents then will head to each student's residence hall for hall luncheons, where par­ents can mingle with rectors and roommates.

Running on en1pty 
Between a costly, poorly-led war and Social Security complications, the Bush Administration faces numerous problems as George W. Bush begins his second term. Unfortunately, the one issue that remains largely overlooked -the

environment -will unquestionably prove the most dis­
Photgrapher
astrous. 
At first Bush's concern for the environment looked promising -while speaking to several environmental advi­sors in May of 1999, he pledged that after his term as president, "the air will be cleaner, the water will be cleaner, and the land will be better cared for." 
Today, this statement is less true than the threat of WMDs in Iraq. In his first three months after being sworn into office as the 43rd president of the United States, Bush announced that the United . States would not take part in the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement between coun­tries to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Without the United States which, with only five per­cent of the world's population, emits almost a quarter of the world's carbon dioxide, the goals of the Kyoto Protocol cannot be reached. 
Alarmingly, Bush refuses to take part in the agreement in part because he believes the rise in global temperatures is a natural phenomenon, despite countless research indicating that global warming is human-induced. 
Since rejecting the Kyoto Protocol and undermining the threat of global warm­ing, Bush has also supported drilling in the Arctic Wildlife, weakened clean air and water standards, broken his promise to protect and repair our National Parks and slowed the cleanup of toxic waste dumps. It is not surprising that environ­mental protection groups see the Bush White House as the most hostile in our country's history. Last month, six former heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, five of them Republican, accused the Bush Administration of neglecting global warming and other environmental problems. 
President Bush has made many irre­versible, serious mistakes during his presidency. None will prove as cata­strophic as his decision to ignore the pressing environmental issues that face our world. The Bush Administration's regressive environmental policies are destroying the health of the American people, our standing in the world, the companies who are struggling to imple­ment. environmentally safe technology, and the irreplaceable biodiversity of our earth. 
In his recent State of the Union Address, Bush spoke of further clean­energy research, ethanol as an alterna­tive energy source, and increased American energy independence. I sin­cerely hope Bush carries out these promises, but his past environmental record suggests otherwise. I can only pray that the successive leaders of our country take these environmental issues seriously -considering that ifour coun­try continues to approach environmental issues as the Bush Administration has, the irreversible damage inflicted on our world will be devastating beyond imagi­nation.

Ruined Iraqi city promotes peace with olive trees 
FALLUJA, Iraq Residents of Falluja, the Iraqi city devastated by a 
U.S. offensive in 2004, have begun planting thousands of olive trees in a bid to pro­mote peace. 
The first trees were plant­ed Wednesday near a foot­ball pitch that became a graveyard for the victims of the U.S. military assault against insurgents holed up in the city. The aim is to plant 250,000 trees by April, organizers said.

Falluja, 50 km (32 miles) west of Baghdad, was a stronghold of Sunni Muslim militants until the U.S. offensive, which left much of the city -known as the "city of mosques" -in ruins. 
Mourners photograph deceased wtih cell phones 
TOKYO -Japan's obsession with camera-equipped mobile phones has taken a bizarre twist, with mourners at funerals now using the devices to capture a final picture of the deceased. 
"I get the sense that peo­ple no longer respect the dead. It's disturbing," a funeral director told the Mainichi Shimbun newspa­per. 
At one ceremony several people gathered round the coffin and took out their phones to photograph the corpse as preparations were made to begin a cremation, she was quoted as saying. 
''I'm sure the deceased would never want their faces photographed," she said.

With the football season over and a bristling winter setting in, most students go months without seeing their family.

The weekend concludes Sunday with the Closing Brunch, also in the Joyce Center Fieldhouse. The brunch will feature a speech by Father Mark Poorman, the vice president for student affairs. 
Local hotels and travel services have prepared for the annual influx of junior parents. 
Anthony Travel began organizing trips for JPW par­ents as early as last March. Pat Walsh, vice president for business service at Anthony Travel, said the agency "has helped a few hundred par­ents book trips this year ­we book air flights for many parents, but the biggest part comes from booking hotel r o o m s " The Inn at Saint Mary's, Walsh said, is the most popu­lar hotel for those parents booking through Anthony Travel. Aware of their high popularity and demand, The Inn at Saint Mary's has raised its rates for JPW. Other hotels in the area, however, do not raise prices for this weekend. The South Bend Marriott, Holiday Inn and The Morris Inn keep their prices at normal week­end rates. 
"We do not need to raise our rates because there is not a huge demand of rooms for us," said Dawn Boulac, Holiday Inn general manag­er. "JPW is not a like a foot-

Most students will not attend every event. 
"I'm sure we'll go to most of the events, but my parents have not met any of my friends yet, so that will be what most of the weekend is for," sophomore Natalie Manese said. 
McKevitt said her parents wanted to have a tailgate before the disco party on Friday, but "we'll see if that actually happens," she said. "We're definitely going to the tour of the chocolate facto­ry." 
Whether or not the stu­dents attend all of the events, the weekend is about creating interactions between family and friends, McKevitt said. 
"It is going to be a totally different situation than the last time all of our parents were here with us," McKevitt said. "That was back moving in our first year, and every­one was wondering how their daughters would do away from home. This time is to show them that we're all just fine."

Only two out of the six South Bend hotels inter­viewed are booked this weekend -the conveniently located Inn at St. Mary's and Morris Inn. The Morris Inn, located on campus, has a unique way of booking hotel rooms for JPW parents. In the fall of each semester, most of the rooms in The Morris Inn go to a junior class lottery. Those parents who enter the lottery are then chosen at random to stay in one of the designated hotel rooms for JPW. 
A committee of 13 juniors began coordinating JPW in April 2005. 
Kajfez is confident this weekend will be a fun yet meaningful time for the Class of 2007 and the families. 
''I'm really excited for JPW this year," she said. "It's hard to believe that 10 months of planning is finally here." 
The JPW committee also includes one advisor, Brian Fremeau, the coordinator of student welfare and develop­ment at the Students Activities Office, and two sophomore committee chairs. The sophomore committee chairs, chosen a month before JPW, are in charge of organizing sophomore volun­teers to manage the behind­the-scenes work so the jun­iors on the committee can actively enjoy their JPW. All undergraduate residence halls will have parietals at midnight Friday and Saturday of JPW.

her to make the SMC Monologues an annual College event. 
"The performance is very pow­erful and we received a great response," she said. "These are stories for us, created for us, per­formed by us, performed by real women who tell real stories." 
Vice President of Student Affairs Jjnda Timm, who attend­ed last year's performance and plans to go again this year, said the SMC Monologues have proven to be a "powerful experience" of stories from the Saint Mary's community. 
'These individuals are willing to share their experiences, their issues and, in some instances, their pain with us," she said. "That takes courage and a great deal of faith that in sharing their stories, it may help someone else." 
A 1 0-person board comprised of students, faculty, staff and sis­ters selects approximately 25 monologues for the performance and then reviews the submis­sions, which include a variety of genres from poetry to essays. 
CARE faculty advisor and College psychology professor Catherine Pittman said not only do the SMC Monologues allow for a more intimate look at campus issues, but they also showcase the students' superior writing skills. 
"(Saint Mary's] is a place that has a strong focus on writing," she said. "Writing expertise is a strong characteristic of our stu­dents . . . and I think we some­times take for granted that we get so many people to respond [to our request for monologues]." 
Francis said the idea for the SMC Monologues stemmed from the worldwide V-Day campaign, which dedicates February to activism targeting violence against women. 
"We really wanted to do activism work focused on the experiences of Saint Mary's women," she said. "The Monologues reflect the deep, per­sonal issues within the Saint Mary's community." 
The 27 actresses in this year's production will each read one of the selected monologues, and Francis said no one will recite her own submission. 
Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership [C.W.I.L.] research analyst and Monologues actress Joy Evans said her partic­ipation in the SMC Monologues allows her to get involved with students who are proactive in changing the College community. 
"It's really been a phenomenal process both years to watch stu­dents develop their own voice and become empowered to speak out on challenging issues," she said. "It's also a real honor to be able to give voice to a fellow SMC woman's experiences." 
Senior SMC Monologues actress Stephanie Snyder said she per­forms to help break the "violence of silence" and acknowledge that no one is alone in his or her per­sonal struggles. 
"The power of presence is what makes the monologues different than any other publication [at] Saint Mary's," she said. "The presence of the women on stage combines with the presence of the women they are reading for to create a space in which all feel sorrow, joy, embarrassment, pain and, most importantly, healing." 
Francis said she believes that the College is one of the first in the nation to create a version of Ensler's "Monologues" written solely by the members of the immediate community -a fact that is gradually confirmed through SMC Monologues' .cover­age in "Women in Higher Education" and discussion at national educational conferences. 
Francis is creating a documen­tary about the SMC Monologues' production process and said she hopes it will serve as an instruc­tional tool fQr other communities who wish to create their own ver­sion. 
"I hope to premier my docu­mentary in April," she said. "I also will hopefully present it at my next [educational] conference in Wisconsin." 
But for now Francis is focused on this weekend's performances at 7 p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday in Carroll Auditorium. She said she hopes to surpass last year's $600 donation -raised from the $3 admission fee ­made to S.O.S., the local rape cri­sis center. 
"When you walk out of the SMC Monologues, you'll be changed forever," she said. "The axis in which you live [will bel shifted ... it will open your eyes and shift your thinking." 
Snyder said she too wants the audience to experience a change in their thoughts and attitudes after viewing the performance. 
"I hope the audience feels uncomfortable at times, sad at times and happy at times,"she said. "The overall effect is that there is one monologue that each person in the audience resonates with. [But] mostly I hope they take from it that we are strong, effective, powerful women and we will not be silenced."

Skilling blatned for dispensing false info 
Rice claims he was told to mislead Enron board 
Associated Press 

HOUSTON -Kenneth Rice, chief of Enron Corp.'s strug­gling broadband unit, testified Thursday that his boss, Jeffrey Skilling, directed him to paint a rosy, misleading picture for the Enron board of directors that was in line with false state­ments Rice said he already made Wall Street analysts who influ­enced the company's stock price that the business was well-positioned for strong, long-term financial perform­ance. In reality, however, EBS was spending $100 million per quarter and generating little revenue and business, he said. 
He told the board, after mak­

Skilling and founder Kenneth Lay that he had no documents and "only my recollection" to back up a conversation he had with Skilling, Enron's chief' executive, as he prepared for a May 2001 meeting of the com­pany's board. 
"What I took from meeting with Mr. Skilling was he wanted me to put a presentation together that was more consis­tent with the analyst confer­ence and less direct on some of the challenges we were facing at EBS," Rice said. 
In January 2001, Rice told 
they had an "excellent deal flow" in trading activities. 
"What I presented to board was inconsistent with what was going on at EBS," said Hice, who is among 16 ex-Enron executives who have pleaded guilty to crimes stemming from the government's investigation of the energy company's swift tumble into bankruptcy pro­ceedings in December 2001. 
But as he has done through­out his three days of testimony, Rice stopped short of saying Skilling lied to investors about the health of Enron.

XM Radio posts wider quarterly loss 
NEW YOHK -XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc.'s losses soared in the fourth quarter on higher eosts for marketing and acquiring sub­scribers, and a key director quit over disagree­ments about the company's direction, warning of a looming "crisis." 
Investors punished the shares of the Washington, D.C.-based company, sending them down $1.27, or 5 percent, to close at $23.9/ol in very heavy volume Thursday after­noon on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They reached a 52-week low of $22.94 earlier in the day. 
Of particular concern to investors was the unexpectml departure of Pierce J. Hoberts Jr. from XM's board of directors, who said in his rnsignation letter that he was "troubled" by the company's current path. 
"(iiven current course and speed there is, in my view, a significant chance of a crisis on the horizon," Hoberts wrotn in the letter, which the eompany disdosed in a regulatory liling. "Even absent a crisis, I believe that XM will inevitably serve its sha.~eholders poorly without major changns now.

Senate nears Patriot Act passage 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The Senate pushed the Patriot Act a step closer to renewal Thursday, overwhelmingly rejecting an effort to block it. 
Passage is expected next month for extending the law that was passed weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as a weapon to help the government track terror suspects. 
The 96-3 vote Thursday was no surprise to Sen. Russell Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat who was the lone sen­ator to oppose the law four and a half years ago and is the chief obstacle to extending 16 provi­sions now due to expire March 10. 
Feingold, who is considering seeking his party's presidential nomination, plans to make the Senate spend several more days on the bill. He complained that Majority Leader Bill Frist, R­Tenn., had used procedural maneuvers to prevent him from trying to add more protections for people investigated by the government. 
"We still have not addressed some of the most significant problems with the Patriot Act," Feingold said. 
At the White House, spokesman Scott McClellan urged the Senate to keep up the momentum on the legislation, which he called "a good faith effort" to improve the law. 
"Yet there are still some Senate Democrats that want to continue to engage in obstruc­tionist tactics and prevent this vital legislation from being reau­thorized,'' McClellan said. "We hope the Senate will move ahead quickly and reject the continued obstructionist efforts." 
Only Sens. Jim Jeffords, 1-Vt., and Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., supported Feingold on Thursday's vote to stop what Frist had characterized as a fili­buster preventing the Senate from acting on the legislation. Sen. David Vitter, R-La., did not vote. 
The changes Feingold was seeking included an amendment that would set a four-year expi­ration date on Patriot Act provi­
sions  regarding  National  
Security Letters  - demands  
made  to  banks,  libraries,  

Internet providers and others without warrants -for records of their customers or clients. 
Another amendment would require the government to notify the subject of a secret search within seven days or obtain court permission to maintain the secrecy for a longer period. The bill would give authorities 30 days after a search before they had to notifY the subject of it. 
Feingold said the new deal some Senate Republicans bro­kered with the White House on civil liberties protections would "still allow government fishing expeditions." 
Other senators also had advo­cated more curbs on the govern­ment's power to investigate peo­ple. But with the law already extended temporarily twice since December and a midterm election approaching, most of those who share Feingold's con­cerns are willing to accept the compromise struck last week with the White House. 
Virtually all of the 45 senators who had stood with Feingold last year to kill a House-Senate agreement abandoned the effort this month after two of them, Republican Sens. John Sununu of New Hampshire and Larry Craig of Idaho, struck a deal with the White House to add more privacy protections. 
"Compromise and consensus require concessions and flexibil­ity,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who sided with Feingold in December but who will now vote for the bill. "It is the responsibility of the Congress to 'provide for the common defense,' and I believe we live up to that duty in this bill." 
Sixty votes were required to overcome Feingold's filibuster. 
Supporters expected the Senate to pass the bill March 1 and the House to quickly add its approval. 
Under the deal, recipients of court-approved subpoenas for information in terrorist investi­gations would have the right to challenge a requirement that they refrain from telling anyone. The bill would also remove a requirement that an individual provide the FBI with the name of an attorney consulted about a National Security Letter. A third change, supporters say, makes clear that most libraries are not subject to National Security Letter demands for information about suspected terrorists.

Academic 'Monologues' belong at ND 
Let's hope he saw what we saw. 
A blunt, vulgar, shocking production that without hesitation por­trays masturbation, extramarital sex and lesbian seduction onstage. And a production that absolutely belongs at the nation's top Catholic university. 
University President Father John Jenkins said he attended "The Vagina Monolo!-,rues" Wednesday -Notre Dame students' third and final performance of the Eve Ensler play this year -to "listen and learn." That is exactly what he needed to do bnfore deciding whether aeadmnie departmnnts ean continue to sponsor the play at the University. and he should be commended lor his attendance. Now-with the V-Day campaign's demonstrative peak finished for another year -comes the waiting game, as the Notre Dame community anticipates the president's verdict. 
And now that .Jenkins ha..<; seen the play in the academic setting he required, he should choose to allow the "Monologues" to remain -a dwice he should make not only in favor of academic frePdom. but in favor of the University's Catholic character, as welL

continue to be held in a large elassroom, an environment that plays an important part in setting the audi!mm's expm:tations and the event's academic tone. Other campus aeademie evenl<; don't charge money for attendance, so the "Monologues" shouldn't either -the funds the play raises (()r charities fighting violence against women can be raised through other means, just as earn­pus clubs are attempting to do this spring. Stopping sexual vio­lence, as Jenkins said in his academic lrnedom and Catholic char­actBr addresses last month, is an undoubtedly worthy cause, and the Notre Dame community should show it<; support by pledging its dollars to the l'undraising alternative the groups eonceive. 
Also crucial to preserving the academic character of the "Monologues" is the continuation of tlw panPI discussions that fol­lowed this year's perfi)fmances. The diseussions provided valuable insight into the themes of the play, as well as a wider context f(w itscontent that enhanced the audinnce's understanding of the play's purpose. Futurn pands should maintain those goals, while also ensuring a range of viewpoint<; arn represented by seeking out both supporters and detractors of "The Vagina Monologues" to speak on behalf of it<; meril'> and laulL'i. And studenL<; and faculty must make speakers' educational elli.Jrt worthwhih~ by listening to the panelists respectfully. questioning them intensely and seeking in the discussion implications 
Ensler's approach wa..<; dearly within the president's bounds. Though .Jenkins should allow the play's performance to continue, criticism oft.he "Monologues" is certainly valid. 
However, Notre Dame, to quote its 15th president, Father Theodore I Iesburgh, strives to graduate "some of the most intelli­gent. Catholics in America." It's a lofty and unique goal, one the University recognizes can't bB accomplished by simply reinforcing Church teaching. In and out of the classroom, students already are encouraged to critically examine their faith in light of contempo­rary challenges. Confronting and engaging Church teachlng while at Notre Dame -MassBs-in-residence-halls Notre Dame, crucifix­es-in-lecture-halls Notre Dame, "God, Country, Notre Dame" Notre Dame -allows studenl<; to strengthen and deepen their under­standing of Catholicism in a pervasively Catholic context. 
Intelligent young Catholics who will lead the Church for decades to come must understand how their beliefs apply to American society in 2006, a society that includes masturbation, extramarital sBx and lesbian seduction -not to mention rape, sexual abuse, female genital mutilation 'hnd other atrocities the "Monologues" brings to light. Exposing Notre Dame students to aspects of con­temporary culture through a production like "The Vagina Monologues"-performed by their talented peers, in a classroom, followed by an open discussion of Catholic teaching versus the play's content -is a positive educational force to open their eyes and put their professed Catholic beliefs into practice. 
This academic context is essential, however. If academic free­dom is cited to justify "The Vagina Monologues"' presence at Notre Dame in future years, then the play must retain the academic character it showed in the past week. The "Monologues" should 

Notre Dame productions of the "Monologues" should leave no question about whether the production bBiongs underneath the University's academic freedom umbrella. Academic departments should be able to decide to sponsor the play on the grounds of sponsoring learning, not on the grounds of endorsing the content of the "Monologues." If the University administration is squeamish about the play attracting publieity and prompting qw~stions about Notre Dame's Catholicism, it can simply make a public statement that while Notre Dame does not endorse the play's content and values due to the University's Catholic character, some of its departments have chosen to spon­sor the play as an academic exercise. 
"The Vagina Monologues" has been performed at Notre Dame for five years now, and the play has yet to cause the drastic shift in Catholic character that some continue to predict. There has been no upsurge in pro-choice, or pro-war, or anti-charity, or otherwise Catholicism-conflicting events on campus. Notre Dame is still widely recognized as the best Catholic university in the country. Its president is still gre!~ted fondly by the popn. And to retain that character and that status, as associatn professor of theology Father Paulinus Ozodor said at Tuesday's panel, events like the "Monologues" that conflict with Catholic teaching "cannot go unchallenged in a Catholic university." 
Indeed, Father Jenkins, they cannot. So challenge them -not by banning the "Monologues." not by silencing student<;' voices, but by fighting spench with spneeh: holding panels, sparking dis­cussions and pushing intelligent Catholics to graduate from Notre Dame having challenged, utilized and strengthened their faith, not having hidden behind it. 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Administration defines academic freedom 
I have followed with some interest the discussion in the Viewpoint section on academic freedom at Notre Dame and other, secular, universities. However, I believe certain participant<; in this discussion have made a subtle but important category mistake. 
For example, Professor Gary Anderson discusses the case of a prominent Oberlin professor who was "subject to terrible harass­ment" for espousing views critical of "the normalization of homo­sexual behaviour" ("Lessons from other universities," Feb. 15). While I hope readers across the political spectrwn can agree this was, prima facie, an incident of terrible injustice, it seems to me to be completely irrelevant to the issue of academic freedom ­unless Oberlin has an official or unofficial policy of discriminating against people with these particular views (which strikes me as highly unlikely), the harassment was no doubt carried out by indi­viduals, not the administration as such. 
By eontra..<;t, the issue at Notre Dame is whether it is consistent with justice for our administration to systematically restrict the expression, oul<;ide of a narrowly-construed "academic" context, of views that are thought to differ from official Church doctrine (whether this diflerence actually rises to the level of contradiction or not). Thus, whether it is consistent with justice for the adminis­tration to bar "The Vagina Monologues" from using theatre spaces on campus and raising funds for local rape crisis centers; or whether it is consistent with justice for the administration to forbid the formation of student organizations ba..<;ed on support fi)r access to abortion or the "normalization of homosexual behaviour;" or whether it is consistent with justice lor the administration to adopt policies that would recognize the reality of sex, both consensual and otherwise, among the student body (pun intended). 

Certainly the incidence of discrimination by individuals at other, secular, universities is a mark against those schools. But this does not imply the administration of these universities restricts social conservatives the way the Notre Dame administration is thought by many to restrict social liberals; nor does it imply that it's some­how just for Notre Dame to tilt the scales in favor of social conser­vatives because they are discriminated against elsewhere.

An unholy approach to television's lure for tithing 
The new year accentuates a need for revnnue by so-called tnlevangelists. Whiln their methods sometimes differ, they laser on specilie rhetoric for pledges, vows or tithes. Hecently bill­boards, direet mail­ing pinces and tdevi­sion broadeasts have permeatnd our lives. This writer surfnd the channnls well past midnight to record some requests and has concluded that P. T. Barnum was correct when deelaring that a stu:knr was born nvnry minute. 
Spirituality is the most private and pnrsonal aspeet of' our lives. Factions in any religion should not "preaeh" on how to corroctly worship. Yet time aftor time tolevangelists instruct us on thn propnr way to worship, mostly with a "born again" conversion. Hernarkably Jimmy Swaggert contra­diets fellow ministers saying that they may lead to the death of souls in a black pit. Swaggort reveals that a docade ago the Lord told him to write a new Biblical interpretation which he snlls for a m(lre $125 with three musi­cal CDs -usually a $17 5 offer. 
Pat Hobertson's "700 Club" recently hosted a telethon to raise $450,000. Interestingly, Hobertson's approach was twofold, targeting the wealthy 

Gary Caruso 
CapitalComments 

while asking the poor to contribute just 65 cents a day. Drawing on our human greed, viewers were told that if we want a $100,000 job, we must begin to think at that level and give to the Lord (i.e., Robertson) at ten per­cent of that amount. Once we have committed to God, He will, in turn, reward us by opening a door to such a position. Robertson's son noted that many viewers were able to give $10,000, and "you nend to call." Pledges totaled $582,000. 
It seems to this writer that Hobertson "needed" those people a bit more than the wayward flock watch­ing the telethon. A staff person hand­ed the younger Robertson a yellow paper with a pledge for $10,000 fol­lowed by another pledge of an unusual $5,004 amount. Moreover, the elder Hobertson 's quick math left this watcher bewildered. lie asked for a mere 65 cents a day, "about $20 a month" or about $200 a year. Actually, 65 cents a day equals more at $237.25 a year, but less than $20 a month. The crawl below the screen listed names and "$20 per month." 
One televangelist offered "free mira­cle water" with a call to his 800 toll­free number. Never mentioning contri­butions, he promised "miracle money." After airing sessions where he healed others by touching their foreheads before they fell to the floor, the program cut to testimonials from those receiving "miracle money." One woman told of $7,000 miraculously transferred into her checking account. Another claimed that $10,000 appeared in her account. 
Testimonials are the lifeblood of fundraising, and each program aired several. Many begin describing how desperate the people were for hous­ing, money, a job or their own lives. A February flyer from Hon Hembree of Cornerstone TeleVision Network, which airs the 700 Club twice a day, features an upbeat cover story about a woman who planned to kill her boyfriend and end her own life. She has transformed her life since she began watching Cornerstone. When Cornerstone last contacted her, "she had a thriving ministry as an author, songwriter and speaker." 
Cornerstone also offers live ways to contribute-monthly plndge, telethon pledge, special gift, memorial gift and caring hearts -but nowhere does it list how to obtain an accounting of income and expenses. To take the message of Jesus Christ to the ends of the earth, Hembree offers a $5,000 special gift feature which raises a for­eign flag on his Avenue of Promise leading to "Signal Hill." After a year, the foreign flag will be sent in a pres­entation box to the contributor. Hembree writes, "Prayer not only helps us align our will with that of our Lord but also spurs us on to fulfill His command to reach a world He loves an died for." 
Kenneth Hagin Ministries touts that "your believing brings about your receiving." lie quotes Mark 9:23 with editing, "Jesus said ... If thou canst believe, all things arn possible to him that believeth." lie writes that "some people quote the same scriptures they've heard a preacher quote and wonder why they don't get results." The answer might come from fellow preacher Hobert Tilton whose January 2006 plea targeted desperate people facing bankruptcy which he could see through the television. Asking for a vow of $1,000 seed money to God (envelopes included). hn may havn recycled his tnlevision "visions" onen too often for the credits ending the program revealed it had been filmnd in 199H. 
Give this Catholic writer the origi­nal, traditional Christian outlook which was never designed to be com­fortable and whose "born again" notion meant leaving this life for the next. Even thnn we are not releasnd from tithing as demonstrated by a bill­board on the road to Detroit's Super Bowl soliciting us beyond our graves, "Is God's will in your will?"

Sooner or later, more than a few of us do a mountain stint. 
For me, movie scenes from "Brokeback Mountain" flash bigger­than-life reminders of time I spent on 
that lonely hilltop.  
My Brokeback occurred 20 years ago in San Francisco. Snrving as a naval officer, I was engaged  Chuck Colbert Guest Columnist  
to be married to a  
woman.  

But a severe case of cold feet pushed me to a critical turning point. Unlike Ennis Del Mar (lleath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), the movie's protagonists, I broke off' that engagement six weeks short of my wedding day. 
Bnlieve me, it was not easy telling my fiancee a hurtful truth. I was gay. 
Sure enough, it was during an Engagnd Encounter weekend, that I, then a Homan Catholic, prayerfully faced up to my own truth. 
I was an only son; and pressures of family, church and state weighed hnavily on me. So much expectation restnd on my shoulders to marry well and carry on the family name. For Ennis and Jack different societal pres­sures nnsnared them. 
I look back and lind it nothing less than a miracle the courage that I, a then very conflicted 2H-year-old naval office, managnd to muster. It was dou­bly risky for me. My fiancee's father was a retired naval officer. In this good Catholic family, rage and hurt could nasily have given way to pay­back-reporting mn to military ofli· eials as I brokll the silence and came out of the doset. 
Instead, my fiancee's mother phoned a few days after breaking off the engagement; and said to me, "Chuck, I know that what you did for my daugh­ter, telling her, you did out of love for her. 1\nd I will never forget that." The parish priest, who had mentored 

A 'Mountain' of discovery 
and confirmed me into the Catholic faith in my hometown of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, encouraged me to break off the engagement and come clean. He assured me that he would provide sensitive pastoral care for my parents as they dealt with a bitter disappoint­ment. 
Fortunately, I lived in California. Gay life and same-sex love had traveled a long way from 1963 to 1983, from the loneliness and heartbreak that E. Annie Proulx's short story tells in wrenchingly stark prose. 
The story's plot line and mood are only enhanced on film. The motion picture captures all of the pathos and more, with full moons and crystalline blue skies, the alpine beauty of big-sky country Wyoming-style, the wide-open stretches of landscape that Ennis and Jack share with coyotes, bears and herds of sheep. 
For me, Gustavo Santaolalla's haunt­ing music captures perfectly the pre­vailing melancholy. That music and the dark Wyoming skies pierced only by moonlight enabled me to go back in time, connecting with my own private Brokeback. In the film, it is the.moun­tain's biting cold that brings Ennis and Jack together, if only for the warmth of human connection in a bedroll. Suddenly, the spark of same-sex male desire ignites and never really dies out. 
Many of us have been there. It's a breaking point-where only the raw male physicality of sexual desire cuts through. Words can't quite bridge the disconneetion and loneliness many of us feel-imprisoned behind walls of stultifying silence and denial. 
But you don't have to be a cowboy to feel the pain of the ill-fated love story of Ennis and Jack. My husband and I saw "Brokeback Mountain" before vis­iting my family for the holidays. If thtlre is ever a gay-themed story with hometown resonance, this story quali­fies. 
There I recalled another powerful scene from the movie. It's the one in which a highly constricted, emotional­ly disconnected Ennis holds two shirts. One shirt is Jack's; the other belongs to Ennis. That clothing and the memo­ry are all that remain. 
Undoubtedly, during the last 40 years, society's knowledge and under­standing of gay people and same-sex relationships have grown. Yet I fear that that for far too many Brokeback's chains still shackle and bind. From small towns in rural America and even within close-knit urban communities -I wonder about men too constricted to trust their true feelings, too afraid to come out fully, too burdened to be more honest with themselves, family and friends. I wonder also about the silently painful Brokebacks -past, present and future -within the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's extended fami­ly. 
I guess I'm lucky. More than 20 years later and well off my Brokeback hilltop, I celebrate nearly two years of being happily and legally married to another man here in Massachusetts. Still, married or single, there is some­thing about "Brokeback Mountain" in all of us. Personal narratives on the lilm's Web site, 
www.BrokebackMountain.com, testify 
to the lilm's universal appeal. 
Despite the movie's box office suc­
cess, four Golden Globes, and eight 
Oscar nominations, a "Brokeback" 
backlash of misunderstanding has sur­
faced. 
A few weeks ago, the movie was 
pulled from a theatre in Utah. For 
some, its showing at Notre Dame 
seems to threaten the University's 
Catholic character and very identity. 
But I am not worried. The truth­telling power of this film derives from its -ability to break the back of preju­dice, intolerance and misunderstand­ing. For those who leave Brokeback's pain behind, there's no turning back -no return to the self-destructiveness of self-denial, to the prison of silence.

'Triplettes' transcends atypical fare 

By MOLLY GRIFFIN Assisranr Scene Ediror 
"The Triplets of Belleville" is a difficult movie to categorize. It's animated, but it lacks the "feel good" quality of Disney and Pixar films. It's tech­nically in French, but lacks any real dialogue. It's also about things -cycling and an ancient trio of jazz singers -that a viewer would be hard­pressed to find in any movie, let along an ani­mated one. 
Somehow, the mix of European visual flair and antiquated references to people like Josephine Baker and Django Reinhardt manages to cohere into a stunning film. In spite of its failure to fit into the usual film categories, "The Triplets of Belleville" is a highly entertaining movie that will leave the viewer with a song in his or her head and a burning desire to see the movie again to discover what was missed the first time. 
The film didn't receive a wide release in the United States, as Sony Pictures was naturally nerv­

ous about a PG-13 rated, The Triplets of Belleville is present throughout the French animated film, but it entire film. For example, will be playing this Friday Where: DPAC Browning Cinema Madame Souza's every and Saturday at 10 p.m. in When: Friday and Saturday at 10 p.m. step is marked by her the Browning Cinema at the Tickets: $6, $5 faculty/staff, clunky orthopedic shoe, DPAC. $4 seniors and $3 for all students Champion perpetually 
The film visually pokes fun at a variety of cul­tural stereotypes. Paris is portrayed as an expanding metropolis so big that it has expanded to the point that it has swallowed up its rural suburbs, while Belleville is painted as an over­whelming, gaudy city. The citizens of Belleville are obese and the French in the film actually eat frogs. 
Once viewers become accustomed to this dif­ferent animation style, it becomes addictive, par­ticularly because it allows the story to be effec­tively told without words. While speaking is nearly absent from "The Triplets of Belleville," the emotive animation and music allows the characters to express genuine emotion without dialogue. 
The music in "The Triplets of Belleville," which is an eclectic jazz sound that uses found objects like bike wheels and vacuum cleaners, emerges as one of the best aspects of the film. The music is distinctly French, but the film manages to add enough to the songs to make its own distinct 
sound. 
Sound, musical or not, 

The film follows Madame Souza, the grandmother of a young orphan boy named Champion. He becomes fascinated by bicycles and Madame Souza becomes his dictatorial trainer. Champion eventually makes it to the Tour de France. During the race, Champion is kidnapped and Madame Souza, along with her dog Bruno, must go to Belleville, a distinctly Manhattan-esque city across the ocean, in order to find him. 
While in Belleville, she meets the Triplets of Belleville, an aging trio of frog-eating, found­object-playing singers who were famous decades ago. They help Madame Souza find her son, who has been abducted by the French mafia for sur­prising reasons, and the movie is truly a testa­ment to her dedication as a parent. 
With very little dialogue, the animation becomes the central focus of the film. The images have a distinctly European flair and the style of the entire movie is really unlike any other. 
The movement of the characters and the exag­gerated shapes of their bodies, such as the cyclists with enormous calves and the bad guys literally shaped like blocks, gives the movie an entirely different feel. The animation is also darker, grittier and in some cases more grotesque than the Disney or Pixar gloss that American viewers are used to. 

pedals his bike and each one of the triplets is con­stantly tapping out a rhythm on something. 
It is rare to find a foreign film sans subtitles, but "The Triplets of Belleville" makes effective use of alternate means of communication. 
With its blend of jazzy rhythms and an unusual percussion section, the extremely catchy fea­tured song "Belleville Rendez-Vous" is undeni­ably one of the highlights of the movie. It deservedly received an Oscar nomination for "Best Song" in 2004 and is nearly impossible to get out of your head for days after the film is over. 
Writer and director Sylvain Chomet, who also write "Belleville Rendez-Vous," clearly had a dis­tinct vision for "The Triplets of Belleville," and the movie refuses to cave into the common ideals that viewers would normally expect from an ani­mated film. 
It is a celebration of European style, whether through the use of innovative music or the love and tenacity of a woman for her child. "The Triplets of Belleville" is truly unique and quite unlike any other movie -particularly among modern day animated features -out today and is a must-see for any fan of European cinema, animated or not.

Undefeated Irish face two ranked opponents 

By DAN TAPETILLO 
Spores Writer 
After coming off a dominating 6-1 win over rival Michigan Tuesday, the No. 15 Irish (5-0) are confident as they head into this weekend's matches against two top-30 opponents. On Saturday, the Irish face No. 22 Tennessee, and the competition will only get tougher Sunday with No. 9 Harvard coming to the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
"This weekend is definitely going to be tough," junior Christian Thompson said. "But ever since we beat [then-No. 
10] North Carolina, we know we can compete with the best teams in the country." 

This season, Tennessee has proven themselves with wins over Purdue and Illinois. However, the Lady Vols are coming off of a recent loss to No. 23 Wake Forest, a team the Irish defeated 4-3 last weekend. 
"Wake Forest was not an easy team to beat," junior Catrina 
Thompson  said.  "So  
[Tennessee's  loss  to  Wake  
Forest]  does  not  mean  

Tennessee is going to be an easy win for us on Saturday." · 
Heading into this weekend's matchup, Tennessee holds a pair of nationally ranked dou­bles teams. Playing at No. 1 for 
NBA players have cleaned up the league's reputation 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -David Stern is happy to be talking basketball as the NBA gathers for its All-Star weekend. 
After what he had to deal with last year at this time, the com­missioner knows the alternative can be a real drag. 
"It beats getting poked in the eye with a sharp stick," Stern said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. 
Stern referred to All-Star weekend as a "celebration," but there wasn't nearly as much joy around the game a year ago. That was a particularly tough time for Stern and the league, just three months after the brawl between Indiana Pacers players and fans in Detroit, and months before the collective bargaining agreement was set to expire. 
"Last year we were going in post-Detroit. [It] wasn't a lot of fun to contemplate," Stern said. 

"The year before we went in sort of post-Olympics and potentially pre-lockout, so there have been issues and there are always issues. The reality is if there's nothing to write about, you guys have to find something to write about anyway." 
Following the brawl, Stern made it a point to improve -the image of the NBA players. A dress code was introduced this season, mandating that players dress in "business casual" attire when conducting league busi­ness. Players sitting on the bench who aren't in uniform are required to wear a sports jacket. 
After a few early objections, there has been little criticism of the rule. 
Even the one big potential headache that brought a reminder of the brawl passed fairly quickly. Antonio Davis was suspended five games for going into the sta-nds in a game at Chicago, but there was little out­rage toward him because he was calm and seemed to be going to support his wife. 
"We haven't had excessive fisticuffs. These are things that commissioners worry about,"

the Lady Vols this season is the national No. 28 duo of Blakeley Griffith and Bryce Marable. The second nationally ranked pair­ing for the Lady Vols is Melisssa Schaub and Samantha Orlin, who stand at No. 38 in the country. 
But the Irish are the only pro­gram in the nation that post three ranked doubles pairings. The No. 1-ranked duo of Christian and Catrina Thompson have led the Irish this season with only one loss to their record. The Thompsons are followed by the No. 35­ranked pairing of sophomore Brook Buck and freshman Kelcy Tefft, who are currently on an 
NBA 

Stern pleased with new attitude 
Stern said. "And truth be told, our player reputation in the test­ing that we do is rebounding quite well from a year ago." 
Stern reiterated that he has lit­tle concern about bringing next season's All-Star weekend to Las Vegas, despite the recent gam­bling ring that the wife of former NHL star Wayne Gretzky was linked to. 
"You have to parse the connec­tions," he said. "And to us the parsing requires you to say that our players shouldn't be engaged in illegal activities and they shouldn't bet on basketball games. If they behave there, that's all there is in terms of reg­ulations."

"[Stastny and Connelly] have been such a big part of our suc­cess this season," Christian Thompson said. "They have a great record in doubles and· we wouldn't be as strong as we are without them." 
Leading the team in singles this weekend are Christian and Catrina Thompson, who both have earned national rankings at Nos. 24 and 44, respectively. Christian Thompson is coming off of a tough win over Michigan's No. 48-ranked Nina Yaftali (6-4, 7-5) last Tuesday. 
"The win at Michigan [over Yaftali] was really big," Christian Thompson said. "It was because it took a lot of mental strength for me to pull it out. 
In Sunday's match against Harvard, the top-ranked Thompsons will face the chal­lenging No. 6-ranked doubles pairing of Melissa Anderson and Elsa O'Riain. 
"This weekend is definitely going to prove where our team stands against the best in the country," Catrina Thompson said.

The Irish eontingont will join noarly 2,000 other ath­letes at the ovent, split between junior (under-21) and cadet (under-17) divi­sions. Players eould either qualify by winning regional tournaments or by amassing mwugh points on the national

NO looks to cap off a successful winter in Akron this weekend 
By JASON GALVAN 
Sports Wrirer 
Notre Dame will put its strong record to tho test this weekend at the 2006 Big East Indoor Championships in Akron, Ohio. 
The top athletes from the con­ference will perform at their most competitive meet before the NCAA Championships in March. The Irish men's and women's teams are looking to shine this Saturday and Sunday. 
"I think we can do well and hopefully improve on what we've done," junior sprinter Maryann Erigha said. "Our conference gets more and more competitive each year, and the high level of the athletes who compete there makes this event something to really look forward to." 
Erigha is oil' to a strong start with several wins during this season's campaign -two alone coming at last weekend's Windsor Challenge at Ontario, Canada. She will look to improve upon her best times in the 60­meter (7.42), and 200-meter (23. 7 4) sprints. 
"We have a lot of good com­petitors and our freshmen ... have been really impressive this year ~s well." Erigha said. "We're looking to perform well in all our events and do our best to win it this weekend." 
Freshmen jumper Mary Saxer and multi-event speeialist Alyissa Hasan have put together solid starts to their careers at Notre Dame. Hasan set a sehool rocord for tlw JWntathlon ­3,6(,5 points at the Notre Danw Invitational on Jan. 27 -and Saxer dmtred a !wight of 4.05 meters, setting a new school rncord in the pole vault. Thn two are looking to make strong showings and build upon already solid perfornutn1~es this year. 
"I just have to koep going up in my heights, qualify for Ithe NCAA Championships] and koop gotting bettor," Saxor said. "We're protty hopoful about doing well and everyone just wants to do their best and win 
it... Other athletes, such as senior All-American distance runner Stephanie Madia, are set to take their performances to the next level. Madia 11nished fourth at tho Meyo Invitational in the 3,000­meter run and qualified for the Big East meet with a time of 9:27.47, but she wants to build upon this finish. Madia will com­pete in the 5,000 and 3,000 meter runs. And though she also qualified for the mile, she has decided to eut this event from her list. ''I'm not really thrilled with how I did at Meyo. and I have sort of a ways to go from my expectations," Madia said. "Hight now, though, it's just a matter of getting into the raee and getting it done, and I'm defi­nitely n~ady fi1r it." Irish junior All-American Kurt Bmminger, who earlier this year at the Notre Dame Invitational boeame tho first Irish runner to clock a sub-four-minute mile 
(3:57.40) twice in his career, also will compote for the Irish this weekm1d.

"· 

ALEXARAE ANTEKEIER/Observer Graphic 
OptiDliSDl 
continued from page 24 
Five years ago, the Irish beat Connecticut -twice -the second win coming in the 
Final Four just two days before the Irish won the 2001 national championship. 
Beginning with that victory, the Irish won four out of their next 10 games against the Huskies, becoming a yearly threat on UConn's schedule. A young rivalry began to bud. 
On Sunday, Notre Dame again squares off with the Huskies in a must-win game. But this time, the Irish are fighting to salvage their sea­son, struggling to turn around a disappointing stretch in the Big East that has them at 5-7 in-conference with losses to mediocre opponents like Seton Hall and Villanova. 
"This year I think of it a lit­tle bit different-it's a big game for us," McGraw said. 
Connecticut, like it has so often these past years, enters the game with an imposing 22­3 record and a No. ·3 national ranking. 
The Huskies, however, have a lot to lose. "They're fighting for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament 
right now," McGraw said. 

Most coaches of back­against-the-wall teams are pretty worried when a hungry, top-5 team comes to town. McGraw, however, seemed excited when discussing Sunday's match up and appears to view the game in more optimistic terms -an opportunity for major progress. 
"It's really a great time for us to play them," she said. "We need to play a really good team to help our HPI." 
The Irish, a classic bubble team, need an impressive fin­ish to qualify for the NCAA tournament. A win Sunday would go a long way to help Notre Dame on that front. 
Perhaps McGraw is so confi­dent because she knows her team can beat the Iluskies. After all, they did it last year. 
In the Irish's 65-59 win in 2005, All-American senior Jacqueline Batteast shot 3-of­17 from the floor, and senior center Teresa Borton had five points. That day, Notre Dame was led by Courtney LaVere, Megan Duffy and Charcl Allen, who had 14, 12, and 11 points, respectively. 
All of them were hot that day. And all of them arc peak­ing now. 
Duffy has been the team's anchor all season, averaging 
15.5 points per game, and at times she has been responsi­ble for keeping the Irish in games. 
LaVere has recently redis­covered her form in the post, scoring in double figures in each of her last four games. 
Against Villanova on Feb. 7, Allen had 14 points in the sec­ond half and almost single­handedly led the team back from a 20-point deficit to send the game to overtime. 
Maybe McGraw is so confi­dent because she knows her team is dangerous. She fully expects Connecticut to play that way. 
"They won't look past us," she said. "They'll be ready to play." 
Connecticut is one the best teams in the country, and its national ranking accurately reflects that. But the way McGraw sounds, maybe it won't be so shocking if the Huskies weren't ranked No. 3 Monday morning. 
Rivals have a way of making those things happen.

prospects for making the NCAA Tournament. With a less-than­stellar conference record, McGraw said she knows Notre Dame must improve its current RPI of 40 to be in good position when the selection committee makes its decisions. 
Connecticut enters at the other end of the spectrum. The Huskies have won 11 of their last 12, dat­ing back to Jan. 7. Their only loss in that stretch was a hard-fought 60-56 loss to Rutgers, which is unbeaten in the conference, on Feb. 7. It was Connecticut's only Big East loss. 
"They're really peaking; they're right where they want to be for the Big East Tournament," McGraw said. "It's really a great time for us to play them because we need to play a really good team to help our RPI. And if we play well, it will give us confi­dence for a strong finish." 
Connecticut has four players with scoring averages in double digits. Guard Ann Strother leads the team with 14.3 points per game on 43 percent shooting from the floor, and her backcourt teammate Mel Thomas is scoring at a clip of 12.7 points a contest while shooting 50 percent from the floor. Forward Barbara Turner is shooting even better ­54 percent -and averaging 11.3 points a night. Huskies guard Chardc Houston has started just four games all year but averages 

10.7 points in just 16.5 minutes. 
"It's a big challenge for us, and I think defensively, one of our biggest challenges of the year," McGraw said. "Because generally everybody we play, there's some­body on the team that we don't have to worry about. But this is a team that not only in their [whole] starting group, but also coming off of the bench, players who are capable of having a big game." 
Connecticut's strengths are not limited to the offensive end. The Huskies have 262 steals on the season (10 a game), compared to 173 for their opponents. What's more, Connecticut grabs an aver­age of five more rebounds than its opponents, and the team is plus-30 on blocks for the season. 
"They're a really good defen­sive team, and I think it's some­thing they don't get enough credit for," McGraw said. "People over­look that because they score so many points." 
That combination of offense and defense has led to sheer domination of Connecticut's opponents. The Huskies average scoring 74.9 points per game and giving up just 55.5. The 19.4 average margin of victory is sixth in the nation. 
But McGraw said Notre Dame's win in Storrs, Conn. last year, which snapped Connecticut's 112-game conference home win­ning streak, gives the Irish hope heading into the matchup.

"We have the confidence to know that this group, right here, has the ability to beat them," she said. "If you look at the stats of that game, it wasn't because [for­mer Irish star forward] Jackie [Batteast] had a great game, so we have confidence." 
The stars of that game included Courtney LaVere (14 points) and Charel Allen (11) -both of whom should see a considerable amount of playing time Sunday. And like she did a year ago, when she scored 12 points while adding five assists and four rebounds, Megan Duffy will run the point for the Irish. 
McGraw said she will not start Allen Sunday for strategic rea­sons. 
"I think we need a spark off the bench; I think that she gives that energy coming in off the bench," McGraw said. "We thought about starting her, but if we changed the lineup, I'm not sure who would give us that energy off the bench." 
The Irish enter the game in a tie for spots 9-11 in the Big East, with West Virginia a game back at No. 12. The Mountaineers face Pittsburgh Sunday in Morganstown, W. Va. and then host Notre Dame Wednesday at 7 p.m. 

Despite the loss to DePaul, the Irish are nearly assured a spot in the Big East Tournament, held in the Hartford Civic Center March 4-7. For Notre Dame to miss the tournament, Seton Hall likely must win its last four games and the Irish would have to lose out.

Bender also thought her team should stick to the game plan that's been driving the winning ways. 
"Wn don't nend to change, just play like we know how to play," she said. "We can win if we do that. IllopeI was our first horne game. Now we've played for two months, improved, and we know we're going to do well." 
Despite their struggles last time, the Belles think that a sea­son's experience will make this contest much more competitiw~. 
"We are going in with a lot more conlidmH:e, more expori­ence, and we've improved so much from Novnmbnr," Brod1~riek said. "Our eoaeh has devised a really, roally good game plan. We're playing with more conlidenen, and, knowing that it is the last game this lrogu­larl season, the seniors will give it all they have; lay it on the line, like they do every game." 
Bender also thought her team would play just as hard in their tinal rogular smson game. 
"We're just going to go out there and play," she said. "We've been improving every day, and we're planning to play a lot 
longer. Everyone is just more and

architecture program. But as the year progressed, he realized he would have to either find a new major or quit the football team. 
"It had been going on for quite a while," 1-Iiben said. "During the fall I realized that there would be a point in time when I would have to pick architecture or football because at this University, it's impossible to do both at the same time. I had known that this would have to happen." 
Hibnn, who saw little aetion as a rookie tight end -playing sparingly in seven games ­would have been in the mix for playing time at the position next season. 
Senior Anthony Fasano decid­ed to forgo his final year of eligi­bility to enter the NFL Draft, leaving junior John Carlson as the probable starter and senior Marcus Freeman as the only other returning scholarship tight end. 
Freeman's status is unclear because he would be a fifth­year senior, and those players coming back for a fifth-year have not been announced. 1-Iiben's departure opens the door for highly touted signee Konrad Reuland, who was a first-team USA Today All­American out of San Capistrano, Calif. 

Hiben said he spoke with director of personnel develop­ment Ron Powlus throughout the process, and Powlus told him that if architecture was the best choice for him, he should pursue it. lliben also said that although Weis was surprised when he informed him of his final decision, he is leaving the team on amiable terms. 
"I think [Weis] was surprised -he wanted me to stay," Hiben said. "[He was] telling me he wanted me to think about it, that hopefully we can work something out. However, the reality is that you do have to choose either architecture or football ... It was very pleasant when I left the team, which was a relief. It was my decision, and I think people will respect that." 
Since he is leaving the team, lliben will no longer attend Notre Dame on a football schol­arship. But he said he has been working with the Office of Financial Aid to ensure he can stay at Notre Dame. 
"The scholarship will be cut off in a few days," said Hiben, who said that after talking to Powlus he almost immediately went to Financial Aid to get things squared away. "That's one of the big things that my family's been aware of. We were prepared for that to happen." 
Hiben, who was also a track and field standout in high school by setting school records in the hurdles and shot put, said he has not ruled out competing for the Irish track and field team at some point. But he emphasized that if it happened, it would occur in the future. For now, he's focused on the major that took him away from football. 
"The reason for leaving the team is so that I can excel at architecture," Hiben said. "So I have to make sure I adapt to life without football, that school is going great for me and after that I will definitely talk to the track coach. I'm not sure if that will be this spring or next year or when I return from Rome, but that's definitely in my future. 
''I'm in the best shape of my life -how can I stop competing all together? So that's some­thing to look forward to."

continued from page 24 
The Irish prepared for a tough match, knowing that any team playing a regional rival like Michigan would have to battle for every point. 
"While we had had the upper hand of late, I remembered that they were very capable of playing a great match at home and they certainly did," Bayliss said. 
The Irish fell 4-3 in a match that had a severe negative impact on their NCAA Tournament seeding, dropping the team to the lower part of the top-10. 
Although the Irish would beat Michigan in the first round of that year's NCAA Tournament at the No. 14 rank, Bayliss still remembers that crushing loss. 
"I've got a lot of memories of going to Ann Arbor," he said. 
The Irish return to the scene of those memories tomorrow, tak­ing on the Wolverines in an evening match in Michigan to continue the streak of Big 10 teams in the schedule. After a loss to Illinois on Feb. 7, the Irish have posted dominant wins over Northwestern, Purdue, Wisconsin and Michigan State. They play Ohio State at home on Feb. 24 and travel to Indiana on March 7. 
"I want to play the better teams in the Big 10 every year," Bayliss said. "I want to play the very best teams in the country." 
Bayliss said the team's almost­uninterrupted stretch of Big 10 teams from January through the beginning of March is the result of scheduling around mid-semes­ter breaks. 
"The Big 10, of course, has mandatory round robin schedul­ing that begins in late March and goes through late April," Bayliss said. "Because of our spring break and most other schools' spring breaks taking up two weeks in March ... those dates are usually not available." 
The Irish are riding a four­match winning streak going into Ann Arbor, improving to 6-4 with Wednesday's win over Michigan

Hustlin' the Huskies 
Irish look to upend No. 6 Connecticut this weekend 
By KEN FOWLER 
Sports Writer 
It's the kind of game that can define a season. 
Coming off a 79-50 drubbing at the hands of DePaul, the Irish (14-9, 5-7 Big East) host No. 6 Connecticut (23-3, 11-1) Sunday at 7 p.m. in the Joyce Center in a matchup of conference rivals heading in opposite directions. 
Notre Dame has struggled all season, playing inconsistent offense and defense and rarely winning the battle on the boards. But the team is looking forward to the game with Connecticut. 
"We had one of the best practices of the year yesterday. At this point of the year, some teams have quit," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "But we have battled ... and I think that shows a lot about the character of this team." 
The Irish want to rebound after their 29-point loss Feb. 12 and improve their

ND faces familiar foe in unfamiliar circumstances 
Five years ago, it wasn't a rivalry. 

Five years ago, Notre Dame had never beaten Connecticut, one of the standard bearers of women's basketball over the last decade. 
Back then, Irish head coach Muffet McGraw announced that sentiment, mak­ing it clear that one-sided rival­ries aren't rival­ries. Rivalries involve back-and­forth action. They involve winning on both sides. As Notre Dame began to establish itself as a national power, the UConn matchup was a must-win game ­the cover charge to get into the elite door of NCAA women's hoops.

MEN'S TENNIS 

Maize and blue set to show ND's true colors 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 

Notre Dame travels to Michigan tomorrow at 6 p.m., nearly four years after the Wolverines pulled a stunning upset of the Irish in a match at the William Clay Ford tennis facility. 
Not a single player from that match remains on either team, but tennis coaches have long memories. 
It was March 2002, and the Irish were No. 4 in the national team rankings. The team was traveling to Ann Arbor to play the Wolverines, barely in the national top-50. 
"We had just moved up to No. 4 in the rankings, which is the highest we'd been in a while," Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said. "Michigan had beaten us there two years prior [in 2000] with pretty much the same team ... These guys knew each other pretty well."
