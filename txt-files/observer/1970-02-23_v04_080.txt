Conscientious objection at NO 
by Tom Hampson 

This is the last of a six part series on conscientious objection by Rich Smith, Dr. John Yoder, Tom llamp­son, and /lave Lammers. 
The avowed purpose of this series of articles was to demytholigize the C.O. position. This is a most important goal. The C.O. is not necessarily a freak or a fanatic. lie i.f a conscien­tious christian. He holds a legally recognized position. Too often people equate the conscientious objector with civil disobedience; this is completely inaccurate. To be a conscientious objector is just as legitimate a position as the soldier. Although this position has in the past led to more extreme actions for the sake of conscious, the position itself is as much a part of our system of law as the draft. 
Perhaps this path of the C.O. is not for every Christian to follow, however it is the respo~sibility of ~very membe~ of the.mystlcal body ot Chnst to consider this cou.rse. The cha~lenge ?f the peacemake~s IS not to be hght~y Ignored. Nor are 1ts conseque~ce~; m W~l _the penalty for co~scwnt10us ?bJe~tJOn was death, m WWII­~mpnsonment, and at present the C.O. IS req~ued to. do two ~ears of alternative serv1ce.. !he. difference between these penaht1es IS the result of more and more men considering the alternative. It has progressed be~ause the government could not fall to recognize the willingness of sincere Christians to investigate the more difficult implications of the gospel and having done so attempt to live the~. 
It 1s an unfortunate fact that at th1s university to pursue this path of C.O. is extremely difficult. Information and a sympathetic ear are not readily available. To remedy this situation a club is being formed at this university. 
The Club will attempt to consider 
both the pers~nal anu 1ega1 aspects ot 
the C.O. Sl~u.atJOn. 
The decisiOn to apply for a C.O. for the Notre D~me s~udent has typ~cal~y been one ~f 1sol~h~n. (An exe~c1se m con~emplat10n. w1t~m the ~on~mes of ones room, w1th ht~le reahzat10~ t~at there are oth~rs trymg to fmd s1~1lar answers.) Th1~ .awareness I beheve could be benef1c1al to the student who believes his search is singular. The C.O. club hopes to faci.litate. this discovery. Notre Dame clmms Itself to be a Christian community, certainly a major portion of this familial concern should be to provide information and su~p~rt for ~ny important decision. 
Th1s IS espeCially relevant for C.O., since it is a decision based on Christian teaching. 
Rather than questioning the posi­tion itself the C.O. club hopes rather to be a place of personal investigation and comparison through di~cussion. If you think you may want to follow the way of conscientious objection it certainly makes sense to talk to others both in the same position and even more important to people already committed to this idea. Realizing that eventually the final decision must come from within, it is hoped that through this preliminary dialogue everyone will be able to answer the challenge of seriously living the gospel. 

Besides discussing the questions involved in making such a decision the club will attempt to relate the personal experiences of those people who have become conscientious objectors. Both alternative service and the long term effects must be examined. The C.O. position is not a trivial matter; you carry it with you to every job, on every job application in the section on

Students represent silent majority 

Small reaction to Biafran campa1gn
by Steve Lazar 
Tom Hamilton, the National Director of the Students for Biafran Relief, thinks that the students at Notre Dame repre­sent the "silent majority." 
Referring to his organization's campaign to end the senseless starvation in Biafra, Hamilton Though disappointed in the said, "The reaction from campus local response, Hamilton seems is disgustingly small.

Henry Margenau, Danforth Visiting Lecturer and Yale University professor who is a leading authority on the philo­sophical foundations of physics, will be the featured speaker during the Saint Mary's College Humanistic Studies series on Thursday, February 26. The session, which is open to the public free of charge, will be held at 8:00 p.m. in the Moreau Hall Little Theater. 
Dr. Margenau, who will speak on "The Role of Science in Human Experience," has made important contributions to physics in his work on inter­molecular forces, spectroscopy, nuclear physics and electronics. 
A Higgins Professor of Physics and Natural Philosophy at Yale, Dr. Margenau is well known as an author and lecturer. He served as a consultant to the Atomic Energy Commission, the Air Force, the National Bureau of Standards, the Argonne National Laboratory, the Rand 
Corporation of California, as well as Lockheed and A vco P ~search Laboratories. He has oeen a staff member of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, New Jersey, and the Radiation Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech­
nology and has held a Guggen­heim Fellowship and a Fulbright Grant. 

During World War II, Dr. Margenau did important work in microwave theory, particularly duplexing ~ystems--the devices 
that make possible the use ot a common antenna in a radar set for both transmitting and receiv­ing operations. 
Dr. Margenau has been visiting lecturer and professor at many universities throughout the 
United States and in Germany, Japan, and Switzerland and has received at least six honorary doctorate degrees from univer­sities in the U.S. and Canada. 
free advertising." 
Recognition of the SBR has come from many sources, in­cluding senators, congressmen, Catholic and Protestant news services, and the National Stu­dent Association. But Hamilton feels that "politics" is preventing the legislators from acting to aid the starving Biafrans. 
To counteract that trend in which government officials en­dorse movements to help Bia­frans but take no action, Hamil­ton has written a "mandate" to President Nixon urging that he act according to a campaign speech he made in September, 

Let's talk about DREAMS 
1968. In that speech, candidate Nixon suggested the U.S. Gov­ernment should help prevent the destruction of the Biafran peo­ple. Hamilton plans to circulate the "mandate," which he called the "official policy statement" of the SBR, to every senator and congressman in the Capitol. 
As a further measure, he will try to get an official policy statement from President Nix­on's Special Assistant on Nigeri­an Affairs, Mr. Ferguson. He hopes that the goals of the Students for Biafran Relief will be recognized and assisted with the help of Mr. Ferguson. 
Hamilton briefly outlined the three point plan which he feels will aid the cause of Biafra. Under the first point, the United States and the Organization for Afri~an States would cooperate to end the food shortage. Sec­ondly, the United Nations would contribute food and medical supplies. And thirdly,, the Nigeri­an Government would be asked to cooperate in resolving the problem; but if they refused, 
economic and political pressure 
would be used to help them 
change their minds. 
Recent statistics have shown that about 41% of the children under four years old in Biafra are now dead. This will mean that the Biafrans will miss almost an entire generation, as the death rate continues without any substantial decrease. 
Referring to the local scene again, Hamilton said the SBR has filed papers with the City of South Bend and St. Joseph County which will permit solici­tation of funds. He also express­ed his appreciation of the efforts of the Student Senate and the Sophomore Class Committee to aid the SBR. 
Hamilton noted there is a possibility that the student Din­ing Hall employees will donate at least one meal's wages to the poor of Biafra. Any donation from anyone he said, no matter what amount, would be greatly appreciated. Donations can be mailed to P.O. Box 516, Notre Dame, Indiana.

the ..nsky" nature of running concerts since it is difficult to gauge the response to a group. 
Grand Prix will also be held this year. Veechi said that it had been put on a break even basis, and that several changes have been made so as to insure against a loss. 
The only losses incurred were on two of the five concerts and on the homecoming ball. The ball, according to Veechi, lost money because "we didn't anti­cipate the 40% drop in atten­dance that occured." 
John Monnich, head of Stu­dent Services, claimed the suc­cess of the commission was due to "having two steadily run organizations, campus press, and student publications and· also because they made no major 
expenditures during this year."
Monnich said that this year the organization worked on a "different philosophy." They 
used the profits from the money making ventures such as the busses to O'Hare to build up a bank to be used for contingen­cies. With this money the com­mission this semester plans to spend more money and take in 
less revenue. Plans include a centralized ticket booth for travel and activities, which will 
be set up this semester. "Last year when this admini­stration took over we decided on 
a re-evaluation. We wanted to better serve the students and the entire university community," Union head Denny Clark stated. 
Clark claimed that the most important task which faced the administration was the "need to create some sort of financial 

stability." This was done, he said, with the introduction of a new financial system and a 
re-structuring of the UnJ·on. Claiming that "the financial system has been the biggest change," Clark asserted that "we have reached a strong financial position as of February !." Tito Trevino, assistant Union director, commented saying that he would "like to thank the people responsible for our finan­
cia! situation. We received a lot of help from the administration, particularly from Fr. Joyce and 
Professor Stewart." Trevino also 
cited various faculty members 
for their help for the academic commission. "Those who are most respon­
sible for the success are the people working in the offices up here. We're a very tight knit 
group, and I'm very happy for 
that," Trevino said. "Overall," Trev,·no stated, "We set as gour goal, to make 
the students aware of what the Union does for them. We wanted to try to make their lives here just a little bit better. Thanks to the fine personnel we have, I 
think that we did it this year." 
He went on saying that he felt the "credibility gap" between the Union and the students had been "narrowed considerably if not completely reduced." 
"The Union wasn't designed to be a profit making organiza­tion. Actually it was formed to be a service organization. I think that this year we have done this better than ever before " Tre­vino claimed. '

ND sen1ors begin analysis of judicial system 
Working on the premise that "justice delayed is justice de­nied," seniors studying industrial engineering at the University of Notre Dame will begin a three­pronged a~alysis of South Bend's criminal justice system this semester. 
According to Dr. James M. Daschbach, Jr., professor of aerospace and mechanical engi­neerilig, they are seeking ways of shortening the extended delay which occurs nationwide be­tween the date a man is arrested and the date he is sentenced. 
Daschbach, who teaches the four-credit engineering work analysis course, requires his students to perform an actual work measurement analysis of some organization in the com­munity as the laboratory exer­cise for the course. Students beginning the analysis of the justice system, for instance, will make a thorough study of the police, county court, and prose­cutor's office, especially examin­ing the interaction among the three branches. They will graphi­cally display the flow of re­sponsibility from arrest to verdict, study the work habits and patterns of the branches, and make engineering sugges­tions for more effective proce­dures. 
The project is an attempt to implement suggestions of the Crime Commission Report is­sued under Lyndon Johnson, Daschbach explained, which asked that the courts of Washington, D.C. employ "sys­tems analysis" in evaluating the criminal justice system of that city. 
The primary advantage of such laboratory problems, Daschbach believes, is that they give the student a chance to apply theoretical precepts to an actual problem. "For many students," he said, "this is the first exposure to the frustrating environment of the business world. They have to limit their ideas by criminal justice analy­s·Js. . reason of economics,

difficult." 

All the students in the work analysis course are mechanical engineering majors, industrial option. The problems they tackle are created by Daschbach, who often spends as much as six months planning and checking before the students begin their study. He contacts the organiza­tion involved, arranges such details as whom the students may see, where they are allowed, and how often they are wel­come. He then wntes a state­ment of the scope and purpose of the study, and obtains final approval from the superinten­dents. 
In attacking such a problem, students spend the first two weeks getting acquainted with the physical layout, people and procedures. After that, they are expected to conduct irilerviews, draw a floor plan, perform simulations on the computer, and come up with a few workable suggestions. 
Dasch bach's students in past semesters have undertaken ser­vice projects for the Memorial Hospital, the Sibley Machine and Foundry Co., the South Bend Clinic, and White Farm Indus­tries. Often, their studies have proved so interesting that a graduate student was funded to complete the project when the semester ended.

Stop false fire alarms 
The Notre Dame fire department spent its usual weekend answering false alarms -usual, at least, for the past two or three years. 
Friday night the department, which consists of the Brothers who live above the fire station and some volunteer graduate students were called to a false alarm in Walsh Hall. After spending time checking out the call they returned to the station. As soon as they returned they were called out again --this time to the area near the Grotto. Apparently some prankster saw the truck returning to the station and decided it would be cool to turn in a false alarm. 
Saturday night was the same story. About midnight an alarm was turned in for the ll th floor of Grace where a party was going on. The crew arrived in time to barge in on the affair, probably much to the delight of whoever it was that was looking for a laugh. One of the fire volunteers remained on the truck while the others went up to the eleventh floor. He had to stay there, he said, because in the p~'st they have had problems with people stealing equipment while the volunteers would leave the truck unattended to investigate an alarm. While he stood there he had to put up with the taunts and jokes of the hall residents. 
Such actions are ridiculous to say the least. At the most they are dangerous. Someday they might prove less than funny if the staff is out chasing a false alarm while a real fire is taking place or if they discover that ·some drunken student has picked up a piece of equipment from the truck that is needed. Not insignificant is the fact that the men in the campus fire department are volunteers. They are giving up their free time to help protect the campus and certainly shouldn't be required to put up with all the pranks that take place. 
We feel that members of the halls should begin to take a more active role in assuring that such ridiculous actions are not allowed to continue. The number of false alarms has picked up in the past few years. Three or four years ago there used to be a false alarm or two when there was some kind of "big weekend" according to officials. Now it is an acknowledged fact that the company is out almost every weekend--often more than once. 
Usually a person can not turn in a false alarm without someone spotting him. It is often done as a joke and the person no doubt likes to talk about it. It would seem that the responsible segment of the student body could see that these people are not allowed to get away with their ridiculous actions. They should be stopped before they turn in alarms or should be turned into the hall judicial boards. If a student takes a piece of fire equipment he certainly can not keep it in his room without being noticed. It is time that responsible students do a little something. Perhaps if students were forced to evacuate a building every time an alarm were turned in people would be a little more concerned about the issue. 
Such a suggestion is ridiculous but there is something to be concerned about. Fire protection' is no children's toy. The juvenile delinquents who are using it to get their kicks ought to stop or be stopped.

Genocide 

An essay by Bertrand Russell, entitled "On American Violence," published posthumously in the March issue of Ramparts magazine, describes the general character of the war in Vietnam as "genocidal." Russell says, 
"(The war) has been fought from the air with napalm and fragmentation bombs, helicopter gunships and pellet bombs, the spraying of poisons on thousands of acres and the use ofenormous high explosive weapons. Civilian areas have been declared 'free fire zones' and the policy has· been one of mechanized slaughter. On the ground, search and destroy missions have used gas in lethal quantities, the killing of prisoners, and systematic interrogation under electrical and other tortures. " 
One must look beyond the general mass media to determine the 
true extent of American genocide. David Dellinger reported after his 
trip to North Viet Nam in 196 7 that no village over 600 persons had 
survived the American bombing raids, despite President Johnson's 
promise that only military targets were being attacked. The latest 
Guardian reports many other incidents similar to My Lai that have 
gone unreported. 
This gruesome review is necessary because Americans have 
accepted the genocidal character of the war as "necessary." We 
realize that the purpose of destroying the Vietnamese is not to hold 
territory, but to inflict more pain, suffering, death, and destruction 
on-the Vietnamese than they are able to bear. The tactics that 
Russell described make little distinction between soldiers and 
civilians. We kill Vietnamese because they are Vietnamese, much as 
Hitler killed Jews because they were Jewish. 
Jean Paul Sartre, in his essay, On Genocide, says that "genocide 
represents itself as the only possible reaction of the American 
government to the rising of a whole people against its oppressors." 
Honeywell Corporation, which has been recruiting here at the school of Our Lady, at this "Christian university" this past week, is the main producer of anti-personell bombs. In the Honeywell Report Report, (available in the Administration Building) there is this descriptiop: 
"The main fragmentation bomb is the cluster bomb unit (CBU), which consists of a "mother bomb" filled with 640 small baseball-size secondary bombs called 'Guavas.' These 'guavas' are released from the mother bomb % mile above ground and dispersed over an area 10 football fields in length. They may be set to explode in the air, on impact, or after laying on the ground for some time. When they do explode, each one sends about 250 steel pellets flying in all directions with great force. The pellets do no harm to concrete, brick buildings or weapons but they tear flesh, spiraling forward and ripping insides. Their erratic course makes removal extremely difficult." 
In January of 1968 the Air Force spent $11,191,730 for 31,288,059 bomblets. 
"I've seen reports of enemy soldiers actually being nailed to trees by these things," one officer commented. (December 14, J967, AP) 
I think we have a right to know from the Administration of this 
"Christian" university what war research is going on here. I think W<' 
have a right to know why Father Hesburgh allows the producer of 
anti-personell bombs and other genocidal weapons to recruit here. It 
is not enough for the head of this university to say that he sees the 
nation "falling apart," or that he would end the war if he could. 
The lamb of innocence is daily being defiled; we do our part. 
300,000 Vietnamese lie dead; we did our part, and now we 
prepare fresh graves. 
We, (students, faculty, administrators) must stand up, or continue 
to be the "white-washed sepulchres" of hypocrisy and complicity. 
Our silent witness to genocide will not go uncondcmned.

LEONARD BERNSTEIN 
Leonard Bernstein is noted equally for his accomplishments in serious music and his pedagogic flair. 
This American composer and conduc­tor was horn in Lawrence, Massachusetts in (l) IS. lie studied music and became an accomplished pianist at Harvard Univer­sity. 
In 1943, Bernstein was appointed Assistant Conductor of the New York Philharmonic. His technical self-assurance under difficult circumstances and hi~ interpretive excellence made an im­mediate impression, and marked the beginning of a brilliant career. l-Ie subsequently conducted the New York City Center Orchestra· from 1945 to 1947. 
lie became permanent conductor of the New York Philharmonic in 1958. He has toured extensively with this orchestra hoth in the United States and other continents. 
When Bernstein was named conductor of the New York Philharmonic, he regretfully had to resign his teaching post al Brandeis University. His popularity increased through his Young People's Concerts and his appearances on tele­vision not only as conductor and pianist hut also as a commentator and enter­tainer. 
Bernstein has composed a variety of works. lie has written Jewish liturgical themes, ballets, jazz rhythms, and scores for musicals. Among the latter, he wrote the score for West Side Story and for the film On the Waterfront. 
duration for manned space flight. After his trip around the moon, Frank Borman moved into the executive staff of 
the National Space Administrational. Today, Borman directs the astronaut program as well as the development of 
the manned space station. 
In recent months it has become apparent that Borman is increasing in influence with the Nixon administration and is widely considered to be the voice of the administration in aerospace development. 
Borman graduated from West Point 8th 
in a class of 670 and received a M.A. in 
aeronautical engineering from the Cali­
fornia Institute of Technology. 
ALLARD K. LOWENSTEIN 

AI Lowenstein, the 40-year-old Con­gressman from New York's Fifth Congres­sional District (Nassau County), has dedicated his life to the reform of the American political system and through­out his life he has made use of the student population to achieve this re­form. 
Lowenstein organized the Conference uf Concerned Democrats that first put pressure on President Lyndon Johnson to step down from office. He, was instru­mental in persuading _Eugene _McCarthy to Convention, he organized the Coalition for an Open Convention. lie is a former President of the National Students Association which is widely considered one of the more beneficial national student organizations. 
Lowenstein is widely considered "the most liberal man in Congre~s." 
ARTHURJ.GOLDBERG 
Few men in this past decade can match the scope of public involvement attained by Arthur J. Goldberg. He was the son of impoverished Jewish-Russian immigrants living in the slums of Chicago. As a fitting climax to a Horatio Alger-youth, he graduated number one in his class at the Northwestern University Law School. 
That was 1930. By 1948 he was one of the most important men in the world of labor law. In that year he became general counsel for the C.I.O. and the United Steel Workers. Goldberg helped plan the important A.F.L.-C.I.O. merger in 1955. In his work for the unions he was known as a shrewd and tenacious negotiator. 
It was on Capitol Hill as a union representative that he met John Kennedy. They became good friends and soon Goldberg was one of Kennedy's most trusted advisors. This close association led to his appointment in 1961 as Secretary of Labor. 
He was the most visibly active 
Secretary who ever held the job. He believed in opening friendly channels of communication between business and labor and attempted to make government an active third party in collective bargaining. Although an outspoken Dem­ocrat, his record made him the favorite labor spokesman not only of President 
.Kennedv but of as l"i!!ht-wing a Republi­r;an as Senator Barry Goldwater. Goldberg's. public service took a new turn in 1962 when he was appointed to the Supreme Court. As a Supreme Court Justice, he was always one of the leading

reflection on his career, "Throughout my life I have been deeply committed to the

ruie of law. The law gives form and substance to the spirit of liberty and to mankind's sacred stir for justice." 
ABRAHAM A. RIBICOFF 
Mr. Ribicoff has had a successful and varied career in politics. He has served as Governor of Connecticut for 6 years, Secretary of HEW for 2, and thus far 7 years as Senator from Conn. In 1968 his reputation was enhanced at the Democra­tic Convention by two different speeches. The first was the nominating speech for George McGovern for President, the other was an attack on Mayor Daley for the Gestapo tactics of the police. 
Considered somewhat of a crusader, Mr. Ribicoff has been an active war critic as well as social critic. He has concerned himself with the urban crisis, with poverty, education, housing, medical aid and national health goals, auto safety standards, and pollution. His concern for the poor dates back to his own childhood experience in a slum-type environment where he grew up. 
ARTHUR M. SCHLESINGER 
Arthur Meier Schlesinger, Jr., born it. Columbus, Ohio, October 15, 1917, is a noted historian and Pulitzer Prize winning writer. Receiving a B.A. from Harvard in 1938, M-r. Schlesinger joined that school's faculty in 1947 and served in that capacity until 1961. 

He was an active member of the Adlai Stevenson Campaign Staff in 1952 and served as special assistant to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson from 1961 to 1964. 
In 1966 he joined the faculty of the City University of New York as the Schweitzer Professor of Humanities and is currently serving in that capaCity. ' 
As accomplished writer, Mr. Schlesing­er was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for history in 1946 for his book, The Age of Jackson. In 1966 he again was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for biography for A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House. 
Among his other works are: Orestes A. Brownson: A Pilgrim's Progress ( 1939); The Vital Center ( 1949); Politics of Freedom( 1950); and The General and the President ( 1951 ). 
He also wrote a three volume work on The Age of Roosevelt, published in 1957, 1959, and 1960. 
Mr. Schlesinger was awarded the Gold Medal for History in 1967 by the National Institute of Arts and Letters.

tions that underclassmen could 
make to an effective adminis­
tration of Student Government. 
St. Mary's, in its present 
restructuring of student govern­
ment, is intentionally shifting 
emphasis from the class level to 
that of the halls. We are 
attempting to ease St. Mary's 
out of its class consciousness and 
restrictiveness into a sense of 
individual awareness. Certain 
upperclassmen seem to have 
missed this point of our bill 
entirely. 

Opening the office of SBP to 
present sophomores and juniors 
could only make for better 
elections at SMC. While, as 
Susan Turnbull stated, we will 
probably never find the 
"perfect" president, allowing 
sophomores to run also would 
provide more candidates from 
which to chose. We must not 
lose faith here in the individual 
voter; a poor candidate will be 
recognized no matter what class 
she is from. 

The momentum of enthu­
siasm building in the freshmen 
and sophomores does seem to 
droop as juniors. What better 
way to capture and channel this 
enthusiasm in our student 
government, so long the target 
of criticism for lack of vitality? 
Jeanne Sweeney (Observer, 
Feb. 19) pointed out that class 
distinction makes no difference 
in regards to the qualities of a 
good leader. Miss Sweeney's 
vantage point as a two year 
reporter on St. Mary's Student 
Government contributes to her 
perspective on the matter. 
Perhaps all this is anti­
climactic and unnecessary. We 
have been defeated twice on this 
issue. But what we witnessed in 
our Assembly last week was far 
too valuable to be readily 
dismissed: students really 
activated over an issue. The 
possibility of an all-school 
referendum remains open to us, 
but whatever the outcome, we 
hope that this issue will not be 
forgotten by those committed to 
its true intent. 

Yours in St. Mary's,

Students for Biafran Relief 
EDITOR: 

STUDENTS FOR BIAFRAN 
RELIEF is an organization head­
quartered at the University of 
Notre Dame, established for the 
sake of saving the millions of 
starving people from death in 
the former rebel state of Biafra. As you are aware, an estimat­ed two million lbo tribesmen have died as a result of the Nigerian civil war. Students in America are now seeking to do . their part in constructive acti­
vism to alleviate conditions 
which cause the atrociously large 
number of Nigerians to starve. It 
is estimated that almost 5,000 of 
these former Biafrans are dying 
each day because of the lack of 
distributed food. 

STUDENTS FOR BIAFRAN 
RELIEF seeks to enlist aid from 
students, laymen, political lead­
ers and corporations nation-wide 
to express their views to the 
world on the situation. It is our 
opinion that the United States 
government, through its state 
department, could make a great­
er effort to cause a change in the 
abhorrent conditions of hunger 
in the former enclave. 
That is why we are appealing 
to you; to ask your endorsement 
of any effort to end the problem 
and for support in entreating the President of the United States to follow his own stand on the subject: "The terrible tragedy of the people of Biafra has now as­sumed catastrophic dimen­sions ..... this is not the time to stand on ceremony or to 'go through channels' or to observe the diplomatic niceties. The destruction of an entire people is an immoral objective, even in the most moral of wars. It can never be justified; it can never be condoned." R.M. NIXON, 
SEPT. 10, 1968 
STUDENTS FOR BIAFRAN RELIEF is operating as a non­profit organization staffed com­pletely by volunteer help. We are now operating with the advisory assistance of many faculty mem­bers, university administrators, and United States Senators. 
It is our intention to make available the funds raised to the 
NIGERIAN RED CROSS, through the ICRC. We hope that the political conditions will change soon so that the only organization bringing relief to the Biafrans will NOT be the incompetent NIGERIAN RED CROSS. For the present, how­ever, they are getting SOME food through to the starving; some does not get through. 
Sincerely, 

STUDENTS FOR BIAFRAN RELIEF

To avoid any misunderstand­ing concerning the recent "lamb-burning" demonstration, I wish to make it absolutely clear that I participated in no way in the planning or execution of said demonstration. In fact I was as much in the dark about the final outcome of the demon­stration as was that venerable bard, Mr. T.C. Treanor. 
I am only too happy to accept Mr. Treanor's kind invitation to engage in debate on the issues he mentioned near the end of his column. I leave it up to him to contact me so that we can discuss such particulars as time, place, and number of people involved. 
As for the rest of the column,

the Off-Campus Housing Com­mittee. 
According to Cusick, the proposal of the Director of !lousing would permit "a senior not on scholastic or social probation" to apply to live in housing approved by the Hous­ing Office. 
The alternative proposal would allow any 21 year old sophomore, junior or senior with a parental signature to apply, provided that the quota for 0-C students (any number above the 1277 who are to live in the dorms) is not filled. 
The Ohserver erroneously reported on Friday that the Board of Trustees of St. Mary's College would meet on March I. However, the meeting will be for the Executive Committee of the Board and it will be held on March 14.

To Butler with an eight -man squad 
by Jack Schaefer Observer Sports Writer Notre Dame triumphed im­pressively 114-7 8 over West Virginia Saturday night before II,350 fans in the ACC. Austin Carr once again set a new Notre Dame single game scoring record as he popped in 55 points (Carr 
broke his "old" school record of 53 ·set last Monday against Tulane). However, the game was not a very pleasing one for the ~rish. In the process of destroy­Ing West Virginia two of the finest Irish players sustained injuries. Sophomore Doug Gem­mell broke his ankle and is most certainly out for the season. Senior guard Mike O'Connell sprained his ankle and at last 
report he might be out for a week.

Grapplers runners-up 
Jim Hansen and Phil Gustaf­son won individual honors in their respective weight classes but their efforts were not enough to prevent the Notre Dame wrestling team from finishing second in the Wheaton Invitational Tournament held Friday and Saturday in Wheat­on, Illinois. 
Augustana College of Rock Island, Ill., showed that they were the class of the tourney, totaling 74 points to runnerup Notre Dame's 49. Marquette and McMurray finished in a third place tie in the competition with 43 points. 
Hansen notched four straight victories, outpointing his oppo­nent each time, to capture the 
 
158 pound event in the tourney while Gustafson registered three decisions and a semi-final round pin to cop first place in the heavyweight division. 
Three other Irish grapplers turned in good performances and managed to reach the semi-final round of the tourna­ment. Tom Ciaccio (118) and Ken Ryan (142) both captured third places while Tom Powell picked up a fourth in the 167 pound weight class. 
Notre Dame will oppose the Illinois Institute of Technology this Tuesday at 6 p.m. (not Wednesday as previously an­nounced) in the ACC. The Irish will enter the match with a dual meet record of 3-6. 

good ball for the Irish since getting the starting nod against Illinois in Chicago Stadium on January 31st. Since then the Irish have won eight of eight. Doug gave the Irish mobility and speed which complemented the 
N.D. game plan perfectedly. Gemmell turned in some of his best performances against the better teams and his presence is going to be dearly missed come tounament time. 
O'Connell's injury, though far less serious than Gemmell's, will cost the Irish a valuable reserve for the Butler game. Mike was in the process of turning in what could have been his best game when the injury occurred. He had 7 points, making all three of his shots and hitting his only foul attempt. 
Saturday's starting five for the Irish included John Gallagher, Jay Ziznewski and Mike O'Connell-graduating seniors playing their last game at home. Gallagher put in two quick buckets and finished the game with 6 points. He has turned in a number of good performances for the Irish and throughout his four years he has added a lot to 
the character of the team. "Big Ziz" has had some great mo­ments while subbing up front. Jay was especially effective in the Villanova game while playing opposite Howard Porter. One thing that can be said about Jay is that the crowd loves him. O'Connell has had his ups and downs but his performances of late have been very strong. He has helped to pull quite a few games out of the fire, notably this year's big Marquette game. 
Good news for the Irish is the continued improvement of Jackie Meehan. Jack had 13 assists as he continually sparked the Irish attack. Meehan is adept at getting the ball to Carr and if he continues his fine passing the Irish will be tough.

Austrailian star of CCC 
Southern Illinois, led by double-winner senior Alan Robinson, captured the Central Collegiate Conference meet Saturday in the Convocation Center. The Salukis' 85\/z points nosed out a surprising Air Force squad with 83 points and a segment of the Kansas team which was in contention with 
77. Trailing these leaders were teams from Eastern Michigan with 69,_ Western Michigan with 50\/z, Kent State with 46 and Drake with 45. The Irish finish­ed eighth with a mediocre 33 points. 
Robinson's victories in the mile in 4:09.8 and his meet record 8:44.8 in winning the Two-Mile were two of Southern Illinois' five firsts. They also captured the Distance Medley, the Triple Jump, and the High Jump. The Air Force squad won only the 300-Yd. Run but relied on consistent scoring to close fast. Kansas' 77 points was easily the most impressive total because they left much of their team at home to rest for the Big Eight Championships next week. Kansas' Julio Meade broke his own meet record in the 440 yd. run with a "good" 48.3 and anchored a winning Mile Relay team. Doug Knop their best shotputter easily won his event with a 59' 4" effort. 
The only Irish winner of the meet was Rick Wohlhutter who took the 600 Yd. Run going away in a time of I: 10.1. The Irish also took third in the

300-Yard Dash: 
ing records. Carr hit 20 of 37 from the floor (practically an off-night for Austin) and IS of 18 from the foul line. His 55 point tally was another N.D. record. Carr also had another good night off the boards as he pulled down thirteen rebounds. 
Collis Jones was outstanding in the rebounding department; he had 21 rebounds to go along with his 13 points. Tom Sinnott also had a good night scoring seven points. Sinnot could become a very important man this week. He has been a strong rebounder and good shooter and seems to be the likely replace­ment for Gemmell. Also, Sin­not's ball-handling could take some of the pressure off the Irish if Meehan gets into foul trouble while O'Connell is injured. 
NCAA tournament bids come 
out this week and on the 
strength of their 19-5 record the 
N.D. team appears to be almost certain of a berth.

Two-Mile and Distance Medley Relays and NO's Kevin McAuliffe took third in the Triple Jump. The host trackmen were severely handicapped by the injury to Mike McMannon, the versatile performer, who would have had an excellent shot at both the Triple and Broad Jump events. Mike's ankle injury will force him to miss at least two weeks of action. How soon he will be back is depend­ent on his personal progress but it is hoped he can make it back for the tail-end of the indoor 
season. 
The Notre Dame trackmen 
will be at home again next 
Saturday to entertain the team 
from Miami of Ohio.
