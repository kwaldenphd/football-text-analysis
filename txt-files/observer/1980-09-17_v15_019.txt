Seniors: Bahamas or busted? 
byJim Rosengarten 
The Senior class may lose thousands of dollars due to un­expected student cancellations of the Senior trip to the Bahamas. Today the Senior committee will meet to deCide whether the trip itself will be cancelled. 
The original plan was for the Seniors to take a flight to Los Angeles during October break to see the Notre Dame-USC game. However, in March the date of the game was moved so that it could be seen on television, and the Senior trip to L.A. fell through. It was then suggested that the trip be moved to the Bahamas. A survey was taken and 
I everyone seemed happy with the decision. The cost ofthe trip is $415 and last week the balance was due. According to Fr. Pedi, the Senior class advisor, only 98 of the 169 students who paid the $50 de­posit paid the balance, which leaves 71 empty seats on the reserved plane. Ofthe 82 stu­dents from St. Mary's who paid the deposit, 67 paid the balance, leaving 15 more empty seats. If the committee decides to cancel the trip today, then the Senior class will have lost $15,000. However, ifthey decide to leave the trip open to students for one more week and then have to cancel, they could lose $35,000. 
The debt, if there is one, will have to be paid by the university, and if it is a large debt then future Senior class trips could be in jeopardy. When asked why there were so many cancellations Fr. Pedi said that the reasons given by stu­dents varied from those not wanting to go because their friends were not going, to lack of financial resources to meet ex­penses. "Then there seemed to be a snowball effect. We got more and more cancellations." 
Fr. Pedi said that part of the reason that the students took the committment lightly might be because of the previous year's

Patrick Lucey earned a spot on Indiana's ballot yesterday as the running mate of independant presidential candidate John Anderson, after a week of court-ordered delays. 
During a hearing in Marion Superior Court, Anderson supporters turned over petitions with 7,762 signatures nominating Lucey as the National Unity Party's candidate for vice president 
The hearing was scheduled to consider the need for continuing a temporary restraining order which the Anderson camp obtained last week to prevent the state from printing the presidential ballots until Lucey could qualify. Indianapolis lawyer Karl Stipher,sitting as judge pro tern in the case, called a recess to allow John N. Shanks II, executive director of the State Election Board, time to count the signatures to make sure they had at least 6,982-the minimum required by law. · 
Battle ofBritain pilots met up again yesterday with some of their former German enemies, 40 years after saving England from a planned Nazi invasion. 
British and German aces who took partin the aerial dogfights that changed the course of World War II flew together from London's Gatwick Airport to Winnipeg, Canada, for a four-day Commonwealth war-time aircrew reunion. 
Among 93 veterans leaving fot Canada was Group Capt. Sir Douglas Bader, 71, who became a national hero after rehabilitating himself from the loss of both his legs to lead a Spitfire squadron in the Battle of Britain. 
There were similar reunions in 1970 and 1976. "We reckon this will be the last reunion. We're all so old," Bader joked with reporters. 
Guatamala's winged national symbol and 83 other species of birds have been driven to the verge of extinction in Central America, an American ecologist said yesterday. 
Dr. Nicholas Smythe, head of the Smithsonian Institute Conservation and Education Office here, said the Quetzal, also known as the bird of peace, may soon be visible only on Guatamalan state emblems unless there is an immediate halt to "the indiscriminate and irrational" cutting of trees in Central America. 
Smythe said other endangered species in the region include all members of the cat family, as well as bear, wild pig, boar, rabbit, rhesus and other monkeys, anteater, armadillo, partridge, peacock, green turtle, golden frog, ring-dove, dove, hawk, boa constrictor and iguana. 
The Ice Age National Scenic Trail, winding through the state ofWisconsin was created by legislation in the House yesterday. The bill, approved 397-3, adds the trail to the national trails 
system. 
The House Interior Committee, in its report on the bill, said the trail winds some 1,000 miles from Lake Michigan to the Minnesota border, following the natural path of the great Wisconsin ice sheet that covered the land 15,000 years ago. 
The bill now goes to the Senate. 
U.S. aid to poor countries is over-estimated because of misstatements in the national budget, according to figures in a report from the Congressional Budget Office. 
It says the figures for economic and development aid fail to take account ofrepayments to the United States on past loans. Thus the $2.8 billion budgeted in 1978 disregards $302 million in repayments of principal and $217 million worth of interest payments. 
So the net flow ofaid to the poor countries was overstated by $529 million, according to this calculation. 
"A different misstatement," the report says, "occurs in the food aid budget request, which does not include an estimate of farm-support expenditures avoided by the existence of this program." 
That is, ifthe U.S. government did not buy up farm products for distribution to other councries, it would have to pay out more tax dollars to keep up prices for the benefit of U.S. farmers. 
Terrorists fired three anti-tank rocket grenades at the U.S. ·.mbassy yesterday causing some damage but apparently no 1juries, security forces reported. 
They said the grenades probably were fired from a building bout 50 yards away from the fenced embassy compound. 
"Something put a hole in one ofour upper stories butas far as ve can tell, nobody was hurt," said an embassy spokesman ;ontacted by telephone. 
Security officials said no group pas asserted responsibility for the shelling. 
Washington has expressed firm support ofthe junta ofthree .civilians and two army officers installed last October after the conservative regime of President Carlos Humberto Romero was ousted in a coup.

HPC organizes United Wavfund 
by Tim Vercel/otti Staff Reporter 

Organizers of the 1980 Notre Dame United Way campaign announced plans for the upcom­ing fund drive at a meeting of the Hall President's Council last night. The campaign, which will take place the week of Septeft'ber 18-0ctober 5, will be conducted by each dorms' hall council. The goal of the drive is %100 student particif1!tion, with each student donating two dol­lars. 
Brother Joseph McTaggert, advisor to the campaign staff, called the HPC a necessary link in the student drive. "We need your planning and· encourage­ment in the halls. We need you squarely behind us," McTaggert said. 
He pointed out that Notre Dame is a significant part of the South Bend community. Ac­cording to McTaggert, thirty-six area organizations benefit from the proceeds of the United Way drive. He also pointed out that no money goes to either abor­tion clinics or to Planned Parenthood. McTaggert called the campaign "a gospel project. It's part of Christianity." 
Mike Sexton, chairman of the drive, thanked the HPC for their assistance, and announced a meeting, to be held on Sunday, September 21, at 7:00p.m. in the

trip, where cancellations were encouraged due to the large number of students who signed up. "Perhaps they felt that they didn't have to go if they signed up," he commented. 
One of Fr. Pedi's main con­cerns is what effect this year will have upon future Senior trips. If the university ends up having to pay thousands ofdollars because of the cancellations, they won't let it happen again. "And un­derstandably so," Fr. Pedi added. "They won't want to take the chance that something could go 
wrong  due  to  a  whim of the  
students."  
Who  is  to  blame  for  the  

economic problems of the trip? "It's hard to fix the blame," he said. "If there is a fault, it would have to lie with the individual who didn't keep his or her 
...Bahamas 
committment. However, I don't think that the cancellation of the 
L.A. trip is to blame." He said that the students were given enough warning of the change and that the general consensus was to go to the Bahamas. However, Anne Fink, one of the two Seniors running the Senior trip, said that more students than just the ones interested in the trip filled out the surveys, and as a result the decision to go to the Bahamas may not have been the decision of those who were planning to go on the trip. She went on to say that they had to move quickly to get the Bahamas trip scheduled. 
Now the Senior trip is being opened to anyone who wishes to go-from seniors to freshmen. All ofthose concerned hope that this will solve the problem, yet unfortunately the outcome does not look too promising.

Students renting two of the three houises seemed generally satisfied with their landlords who live in Stanford Hall. The third house is rented to a family, though Mannix said the group does try to rent to students, and rented one of the houses to former hallmates. 
Tim O'Malley of the house at 806 St. Louis said that he and his housemates were victims of the recent rash of break-ins in the area, but added that his landlords were not to blame and have since installed lighting in the back yard. 1 i 
Commenting on the crime problem. in the Northeast neighborhood, which has so far not str~ck the other of the group's ·houses, Mannix said, "You can look far and wide on these streets and not find two streetlights." He feels that the break-ins will continue since, "everyone in town knows where the students live and knows they leave their houses empty." 
Mannix said he tried to attend last week's meeting of Student Government with the police chief aii,d mayor of South Bend, but was: told by Dean Roemer's office that he was not invited.

the meeting," he commented. 
Both Method and Mannix spent the past summer in one of their houses renovating the attic as a bedroom. "We do all the work ourselves because there's no. other way unless you have loads of money," Method said. Mannix said that the only ex­ception to this was a Iawnboy they briefly hired. 
Method is the only one of the four member corporation who does not plan to continue in the real estate business affer grad­uation. He' still plans to go to medical school, but senior Mannix has learned enough from his landlord experience to lean away from psychology, his major, towards MBA school and continued business dealings. 
None of the members see any reason to collect their assets and pull out of the partnership. Instead they stress that their goals are long range, and repeat that real estate is no place to make a fast buck. 
Method sees himself attracting investors to the firm ifhe goes to medical school. "We pay 15 percent interest on loans to the business, and if we add a few houses and a condiminium or two to our property, I can see a lot ofpeople wanting to invest."

Mohammad  Mahammadi,  a  

member of The Struggling Moslems Movement which has close ties to the militant stu­dents holding the Americans, bitterly objected. ''Everything should be open to the nation," he shouted. "I am absolutely against any kind of secret session.'' 
Rafsanjani twice warned Ma­hammadi to stop shouting.

Egypt educates 
late 

shah's children .. 

-~------------------­
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -The daughter ofthe late Shah oflran, sitting on the steps of a private 
American  school  in  Cairo's  
suburbs,  said  yesterday  her  
family  is  gradually  emerging  

from seclusion two months after her father's death. 
Looking like ay other teenager in tight jeans and a white cotton blouse, Farahnaz-or Farah as her classmates call her -said with a note of relief in her voice, "At least we are all together and that is very good for us." 
I am very happy here... the school is good and I have already made friends." 
Farah, 17, just started her senior year at the Cairo American College, a primary and 

The projeCtile slammed into the target at better than 33 million miles per hour. There was no explosion. Rather, the Carbon 12 nucleus fused with the stationary Neon 20 atom, form­ing Magnesium 24 and various sub-atomic particles. 
Physicists at the University of Notre Dame, using the University's own Tandem Accelerator, are studying just such reactions. 
Research has been underway since 1937 when the University's first accelerator was built. It was an open air contraption. The second one, more powerful than its predecessor, was situated in the basement of the LaFortune Student Center, in what is pre­sently the Pool Room.

New research underway 


NDphysicists smash atotns 
The third was home-built after WW II. It was used exclusively for years, until the)'andem idled it. It was recently resurrected as an injector for the present ac­celerator. 
Research has been funded since 1946 by the Office ofNaval Research, Atomic Energy Commission, and this year, by the National Science Foundation (NSF). 
The NSF recently granted the project one year's operating budget or $428,000 to continue their studies ofnuclear structure. 
A substantial portion goes toward operating costs. The remainder is used to fix the mechanism, buy parts, and pay 
salaries,  including  those  of  
graduate  students  and  the  
researchers'  summer  pay.  Re­ 
cently  the  NSF  granted  the  

project an additional $73,000 which will go toward updating and eventually replacing ·the facility's computer. 
A number of faculty and graduate students conduct re­search on the accelerator. 
Professor Sperry E. Darden -is investigating the spin-depen­dence of nuclear forces using polarized particles, or sub-atom­ic particles thatare all spinning in the same plane with the same direction of spin. 
Dr. John W. Mihelich, pro­essor of physics and spokesman for the group, and Professor Emerson G. Fupk study the gamma rays given off as the target nucleus returns to the ground, or unexcited, state of existence. 
Cornelius P. Browne, profes­or ofphysics (currently on leave), specializes in the precise measurement of nuclear reac­tion energies. 
James]. Kalata, associate pro­fessor of physics, and Ronald E. Malmin, assistant professor, study reactions induced by heavy ions. Also working on the project are E. D. Berners, J. W. Kaiser, associate professional specialist, and many others. 
The accelerator actually con­sists of two accelerators, the home-built·of the post-WW II era, and the Tandem itself. The old is used to ionize atoms and accelerate them to one-tenth ofa percent ofthe speed oflight, and inject them into the Double­-Ended Van de Graaff, or Tandem Accelerator. There the ion is accelerated to "several percent of the speed of light," 
'says Kalata, and then used in the experiments. 
Mihelich said, "We're not looking for anything particularly useful, but on the other hand, what we do find may well be useful eventually. "Lasers, now used extensively in microsurgery and treating lacerations of the eye's retina, were at one time laboratory curiosities." 
"Th~s is pure research, just as nuclear power once was."

N.D. boycotts·: More facade than fact? 
The student body of Notre Dame professes to be a very socially conscious group. The Urban Plunge and the World Hunger Coalition are examples of such social consciousness, and I whole-heartedly support these programs. How­ever, in recent years we have been subjected by certain groups to the rigors of boycotts. The two outstanding examples of student organized boycotts in recent history are the Nestle's boycott and the Campbell's boycott, both of which were brought to referendum and passed by the student body. However, it is my contention that these boycotts are not truly representative of social consciousness. 
The concept of a boycott is clear, and I will not elaborate on it, but remember its essence is to inflict material harm or at least some sense of shame on the boycotted party. But what is a socially conscious action? Three criteria should be exhibited in a socially conscious action. First, the action should serve a noble and humanitarian cause by improving the human condition. Second, the action should involve a visible protest and sacrifice on the protester's part, so that his action might be a meaningful sign ofsacrifice rather than being merely symbolic. Third, the act must be a conscious one, exhibiting an effort 'by the protester to come to grips with a social problem. 
Under these criteria, such activities as theWorld Hunger Coalition and the Urban Plunge serve a socially conscious function. But can the same be said of the two boycotts mentioned above? The Nestle's boycott, while possibly making a moral statement concerning the actions of that com­pany, is not a socially conscious action. The students have not made a meaningful sacrifice to draw the attention of society; we have .nerely substituted other name brands for the products involved. 
I would also contend that many students who voted for the Nestle's boycott did not consciously act on that decision. Neither did they adequately weigh the issues involved, but acted rather im­pulsively in their decision; and those same people probably did not go home and ask their families to boycott Nestle's products, thus keeping the effect of the boycott minimal. 
The Campbell's boycott also cannot be con­sidered a socially conscious action. Again, no student has done without tomato products (I have yet to see a Domer do without ketchup on his greasy, dining hall french fries) or any other farm products of the like which should have been the true aim of the boycott. Migrant workers in many states such as Arkansas, Colorado, New Jersey, and California have suffered at the hands of un­scrupulous employers, but we have not rallied to 
-their support. We have merely transferred our business to the competitors of Campbell's, who ·undoubtly are as responsible for the plight offarm workers as Campbell's. In fact, Campbell's can only exert indirect and tenuous pressure for improvement of farm labor situations. 
IfND boycotts are to become true acts ofsocial consciousness, the ND community must be willing to make sacrifices to reinforce and give meaning to our statements. What shape could such a boycott take? Here are a few proposed' boycotts we could undertake now, or that should have been undertaken in the past. 
1.) Boycott A.T.T. (and its subsidiary Indian~ Bell) for its role in the violent subversion of the Allende regime in Chile during the early 70's. This would be a truly conscious act, reinforced by the sacrifice of our phone service. 
2.) Boycott the productive elements of the military-industrial complex for irs unresponsive­ness to the American people, and its blatant commercialism that is such a dehumanizing drain 
Dave Cockerill · 
on us all. All such articles as TV's, calculators, stereos, computers, automobiles, and the other abominations of our highly over-technicalized society should be removed immediately from the campus. Due to the deluge ofpaper and hard copy that would result from the boycott ofcomputers, Grace Hall residents should be placed off-campus, wheels and drawers added to the world's largest mobile filing cabinet to accommodate the overflow. All engineering and science students should also be supplied with appropriate abacuses or sliderules. 
3.) The planting of organically-grown crops in the quads would be a meaningful gesture in the face of the pollution of our bodily fluids by additives in processed foods. Ample amounts of fertilizer could be obtained by sifting through Administration statements. 
4.) Anyone who has seen the movie Norma Rae or who has read articles on the textile industry knows that textile workers are one ofthe most oppressed labor groups in this country. To show meaningful support of textile workers, we should boycott all clothing on campus, which would be a real sacrifice in South Bend. If this seems too farfetched, we could at least boycott Calvin Klein and Gloria Vanderbilt designer apparel. 
You know, it just might be possible that socially conscious boycotts could go a bit too far if taken seriously.

Optimism remains 

Belles win once, but fall twice 


by Kevin Donius Sports Writer 

Corning off a 5-4 season last year, and with ~ive returning starters the Saint Mary's field hockey-team is looking forward to another winning season. The cause suffered a slight set back Monday, falling to Toledo, 2-0, but remains optimistic. 
Under the direction of new head coach Marcee Wiese, the Belles opened their season last Saturday in a tri-meet with Taylor and Valparaiso. They managed to stay even for the day by edging Valpo 2-1, after losing to Taylor 1-0 in a close contest. 

"We played well against Taylor, although we might have been able to play better. Against Valparaiso we won so what else cartltyou say," said Beth Welsh, senior tri-captain for the Belles. 
"We've looked a lot better than in previous years and I think we have a lot ofpotential, butit's hard to predict how we'll do because I don't know what the other teams are like," concluded Welsh. 
Wiese, optimistic on the season's outlook added, "We would like to win more barnes then we lose ...We expect to win because of the talent we have." 
Tri-captains Welsh, Nannette Krauss, and Peg Blum provice much of the talent that Coach Wiese talks about. The captains along with sophomore Lisa Keeley are expected to create the needed sparks for the Belles this year. 
Nevertheless, Wiese empha­izes that the team can use all the support it can get. The first-year­coach encourages students to come out and root for the team saying, "If they come out and watch us I think they'll get hooked on field hockey." 
The next home game for Saint Mary's is Saturday against Franklin. 

Consecutive shutouts befall Irish girls 
by David Wilson Sports Writer 
Despite tremendous defensive efforts the Irish field hockey team suffered back-to-hack shut­outs this past week, dropping its overall record to 1-2. 
According to head coach Jan Galen, Saturday's 5-0 defeat to the University of Indiana at loomington came as no surprise. 
"We played a tough game, especially in the first half," commented the first-year coach, "but one must remember that Indiana is a Division I team and the Irish are a Division II team. 
"Our inexperince hurt us against Indiana. We played well but we still have a lot to work on. We .still have a lot of games to play on our schedule so we should be a skilled team by the time the state tournament rolls around." 
Galen added that the Irish played a brilliant defensive game, limiting the Hoosiers to a single goal in the first half. 
"]ean Grasso did a super job on defense," concluded Galen. 
The team's other loss came at the hands of the University of Toledo on Monday afternoon at St. Mary's, by a score of 1-0. 
Co-captain Pat Crowley main­tained that the ruggedness of the field made it anybody's game. 

"We played a very had game," Crowley said, "and the goal may have just been a lucky break for them." 
Crowley remains confident that the Irish can win Friday ina4 
p.m. contest against Franklin College on Cartier Field. Notre Dame will also host Kalamazoo at home on Monday, Sept. 22 with game time at 7:30 p.m. on Cartier Field.

SOME PEOPLE NEVER CHANGE-Onetime Irish 
basketball star (and I use the term loosely) Bill Laimbeer, now a 
rookie with the Cleveland Cavaliers, has not hesitated to voice 
his disenchantment with Notre Dame. Laimbeer told a reporter 
for the Cleveland Plain Dealer that he played a year in Italy to 
regain the confidence he lost while playing for the Irish. 
Of Notre Dame, the 6-ll center said "I was happy with the 
school, but notwith the way I played, or not with the program." 
We were happy with you too, Bill.

As Irish golf coach Noel O'Sullivan stresses every year, the Notre Dame Open is not supposed to serve as a tryout for the golf team. "I make selections for the team based on past ex­perience and performance, not just on four rounds," he says. 
O'Sullivan believes that the Notre Dame Open serves a much different purpose. "The most important thing about the Open," he emphasizes, "is the prestige." 
Part of what O'Sullivan is referring to is the fact that the top three finishers in the tour­nament receive handsomely em­broidered gold, silver, and bronze medallions. 
As always, this year's tour­nment was open to all Notre Dame students, rega-rdless of their ability. Due to some rainy weather this past week and also a play-off for second place, the Open wasn't completed until yesterday afternoon, nine days after it began. 
But the-delays didn't seem to bother junior Bob Horak, who came away with a 72-hole final score of 291 and the gold medallion for first place. Horak, a business major out of Rochester, N.Y., managed a two­under-par 69 in his first round and then added rounds of73, 75 and 7 4 to win by one stroke. 
Right on Horak's tail at the end of regulation play were seniors Tom McCarthy and Rick Ruffin, both at 292; thus, a play-off was necessary to decide second and third place. McCarthy won on the first hole of sudden-death, sinking a five-foot birdie putt, moments after Ruffin rolled in a seven-footer for par. 
So, looking at the top three finishers, it appears that the upperclassmen dominated this year's open. But, this certainly wasn't the case. Of the 25 lowest scores in the tournament nine were fired by freshmen. And this surprising statistic makes Noel O'Sullivan very happy. 
"I'll have to give a strong look at the freshman before filling the remaining spots on the team, "O'Sullivan says. "I cap honestly say that the field for this year's Open was the best in the last five years and this is mainly due to the fact that there were so many talented freshmen entered." 
O'Sullivan is going to have the top finishers from. the Notre Dame Open play some of the tougher courses in the area: South Bend Country Club, Hampshire Country Club, and Elbel. After seeing how they perform on these more challeng­ing layouts, he will then fill the remaining five orsix,positions on the team. 
It won't be an easy job, but O'Sullivan is glad that he has such a wealth of talent to choose from. 
The team will open its fall competition on Sept. 29 with the Indiana State Championship. The Irish will then return home to host the Notre Dame Invitational on October 6. 

To Chicago Griffin 
Ruggers drop opening contests 
by Armand Kornfeld Sports Wrtter 
The Notre Dame Rugby Club opened its fall season against Chicago Griffin last Saturday, dropping the "A", "B", and "C" games by scores of 20-4, 12-8, and 10-8 respectively. 
The Windy City squad may have presented the toughtest opposition the Irish will face all season. And as Rich Harper, the Irish captain and head coach noted, "The weather played a definite factor. It was hot and muggy and they were in better shape due to a cross-country program they set up this sum­mer. We just haven't had time to get into shape yet." 
Even in the losing cause, how­ever, there were sterling per­formances turned in by several of the Irish ruggers. Danny Pearl and Rich Levielle played excel­lent games for the "A" team, while Greg Brophe and Bob Murphy led the "B" team. In the "C" game, Pete Ney had what Harper termed "a fine all-around game," scoring once and setting up the other try. 
The Irish will host Ohio Northern Uni;,ersity Saturday at 
Stepan Field immediately pre­ceding the Michigan-Notre Dame clash. The Polar Bear squad is a collegiate club, as opposed to Chicago Griffin which is composed of older players. 
Harper is planning to utilize the "C" and "D" squads against Ohio Northern in order to build valuable experience. 
Palmer College was originally slated to meet the "A" and "B" teams this Saturday, but was forced to cancel at the last minute due to unrevealed cir­cumstances. 


WHO'S AFRAID OF THE BIG BAD WOLVES?-Notre Dame might be, since the Michigan Wolverines bound into South Bend this weekend holding a 10-3 edge in the all-time series. Bo's boys and their predecessors have been invincible in South Bend, having won all five games played here in the series. 
Michigan upended Notre Dame's first football team ever 8-0 in 1887, and their last victory here occur,ed two season ago when they handed the Irish their second loss ofthe 1978 season, 28-14. 
(Interestingly enough, Notre Dame went 0-2 to start its football season in 1978, the same year Pope Paul VI died. The last time Notre Dame went 0-2 at the start ofa football season prior to '78 was in 1963, the year Pope John XXIII died.) 
Notre Dame's grid series with the Wolverines was contested semi-regularly from 1887 to 1909, and then suspended until the '42and'43 seasons. The rivalry was renewed in 1978 and, except for off years in 198 3 and 1984, plans call for the teams to meet every year until at least 1990. 
WHO WAS THAT GUY?-Notre Dame upset the highly­regarded Wolverines 12-10 in Ann Arbor last year. Chuck Male's four field goals carried the Irish offense, while Bob Crable's last second heroics iced Notre Dame's win. Crable, then a sophomore linebacker, mounted the back of a fallen Michigan lineman to catapult himself over the line and into the path ofBryan Virgil's 32-yard field goal attemptwith only seven seconds left in the regionally-televised contest. 
THE DAN AND BO SHOW -Irish coach Dan Devine and Michigan mentor Bo Schembechler rank among the top five active college coaches in career victories. Devine's 165-54-8 lifetime mark is second behind Alabama's Paul "Bear" Bryant, while Schembechler rates fourth at 145-36-6. 
WATER WORKS~ Devine took time to poke a little fun at Schembechler on Monday. Some 50 reporters were gathered in Ann Arbor to interview Schembechler in personand Devine via a telephone hookup with his ACC office. Recalling how much trouble the fleet-footed Michigan team .had with the rainy weather and drenched field on Saturday against Northwestern (Michigan beat the perenially-hapless Wildcats 17-10), Devine hung up from the interview saying, "You'll have to excuse me now-I have to go over to the Stadium and turn on the water." 
CAN YOU TAKE A HINT?-The Associated Press followed the Observer's trend last week, naming Irish defensive end Scott Zettek and linebacker Mark Zavagnin its college stars of the week. The two Z's shared the honor with New Mexico quarterback Brad Wright. 
OPINION-The NCAA's recent decision to ban Notre Dame football broadcasts is just another feather in the Association's fully-plumed dunce cap. If the NCAA wanted to be consistent (perish the thought!), why not ban college football games from ABC-TV too, since ABC coverage certainly cuts into the attendance at many smaller colleges around the country? 
However, it is ABC's television rights payments which keep the NCAA afloat, and the powers that be certainly won't biteth the hand that feedeth. No one, particularly the NCAA, has mentioned that recent ratings have shown WNDU's Notre Dame telecasts have outdrawn ABC's national game here in South Bend, sometimes by a three-to-one ratio. Certainly someone at the alphabet network has made their unhappiness known around Shawnee Mission. 
One really wonders what the NCAA's priorities are when they deliver such crucial edicts as this, along with the banishment of varsity basketball players from the BookstoreTournament and the punitive measures taken against Marc Kelly for playing basketball in the movie "Fast Break" prior to joining the Irish varsity his freshman year. At the same time, gross academic and recruiting violations are being uncovered at universities across 
-the country, with little definitive action being taken by the Association. · Maybe ifthe NCAA stopped watching TV they might find out what's going on next to them. 
GOLDEN'DOMES-While most Irish faithful imbibe in their favorite beverages at Corby's, Senior Bar and V ilia Angela 
·the night before a football game, the Notre Dame student managers labor away in the recesses of the ACC. Their job: repainting the well-known metallic gold helmets of the Irish football team, a task which requires some six gallons of gold paint. 
PLENTY OF HARDWARE -The upper concourse of the ACC is getting a new look. The familiar semi-circular trophy case with its imitation marble pillars has been removed in lieu of several new wood-and-glass cases. The earlier pillar design, an ACC mainstay for ten years, was originally supposed to be used for only six manths. 
A NEW NAMATH-Former San Francisco quarterback John Brodie, a quasi-analyst (and TrashSports expert) on NBC­TV for the last seven years, is high on the potential ofex-Irish signalcallerJoe Montana. The "Comeback Kid," who led Notre Dame to its 1977 National Championship, is now a back-up
