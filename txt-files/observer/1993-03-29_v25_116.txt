THE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER SERVING NOTRE DAME AND SAINT MARY'S 
esc celebrates tenth anniversary 
Law school to mark 25th year of women 
By ALICIA REALE 
Associate News Editor 
The 25th anniversary of women attencling the Notre Dame Law School as full-time students will be commemo­rated today at 3 p.m. in the Barry Moot Courtroom. 
"These women really were pioneers here," said Janis Johnston, acting director of the Kresge Law Library and program coordinator. "They came to a facility without women's restrooms or dorms. They were very much in the minority at Notre Dame." 
The program will celebrate the achievements of women graduates of the law school and reflect on women in the practice of law, according to Johnston. "We will asses the real accomplishments and where challenges remain." 
Justice Shirley Abrahamson of the Wisconsin Supreme Court will deliver the keynote address on the state of women in the legal profession titled, "A Courtroom of One's Own: New Roles of Women in the Legal Profession." 
ln her speech Abrahamson will "talk about women in the legal profession, how the in­crease of women in numbers has changed it and the prob­lems that still remain," said Johnston. 
Following her presentation, five ND Law School alumnae, engaged in various types of legal practice, will participate in a panel discussion of their experiences as students and women lawyers. "The panel will reminisce about days as students in the law school and comment on being women attorneys in their particular field of practice," said Johnston. 
The panel will include;

Center helps community and students 
By CHRIS HANIFIN 
News Writer 
Several hundred members of the Notre Dame and South Bend community gathered on Saturday to celebrate the lOth anniversary of the Center for Social Concerns, an organiza­tion which has programs which are designed to benefit both the community it serves and the volunteers who serve it. 
"All great religions teach us that we have an obligation to serve our fellow human beings. I am extremely proud of what has been accomplished here through the intensity of the esc staff," said University President Father Edward Malloy. 
'The center was conceived in the imagination of students and we continue to develop in re­sponse to students' dreams and ideas. Students give us purpose and share with us a curiosity and enthusiasm for life," said Kathy Royer, the center's co­ordinator for service and social action. 
"Our friends in the commu­nity have helped teach us about life. You have been hospitable neighbors welcoming us into our Jives," she said.

Confusion in tryouts disrupts cheerleading program 

By JOHN LUCAS 
Assistant News Editor 
Amid confusion over recent changes in cheerleading style and the number of Saint Mary's students allowed to become Notre Dame cheerleaders, the cheerleading squad will hold a meeting on Thursday afternoon to clarify the direction of the program and announce the new coach. 
According to former cheer­leading captain Tyler Moore, the new coach of the program will be Kathleen Clements, wife of assistant football coach, Tom Clements. Clements will re­place Sports Marketing Director Jim Fraleigh, who became the interim coach of the team after Maria Maierek was dismissed in February. 
Majerek, who said she actu­ally chose to leave the program, said she thinks the Athletic Department has mishandled the che erle acting situation, particularly in the cases of Saint Mary's students Dana Bel­trondo and Julie Radca. 
Beltrondo and Radca were told minutes before tryouts that only one Saint Mary's girls would be allowed on the varsity squad. Both were varsity cheerleaders for the majority of last season. 
"It automatically put tension on us because we were sud­denly competing against each other for the varsity spot," said Radca. "The other girls from Saint Mary's were devastated. Some said they wouldn't even have gone through the trouble of trying out." 
Notre Dame has always had a policy of taking no more than one Saint Mary's student on the varsity squad, said Missy Con­boy, associate athletic director. "That stance was the most fair to Notre Dame students, while still maintaining our long­standing tradition with Saint Mary's," she said. 
But Majerek said that she was told at the beginning of the sea­son to "forget the quotas," and that she knew of no rule that would prohibit two Saint Mary's students on the varsity squad. 
Clements is expected to pre­sent her plans for the squad and outline the new nature of the program at the Thursday meeting, Moore said. 

The Athletic Department has set limitations on the team, prohibiting stunts that go above the height of two body lengths, according to Majerek. The limit will prohibit many stunts. 
"I think it's a step back," she said. "It will definitely be more difficult to lead the cheers. Stunts help the cheerleaders to be visible and reach out and at­tract attention," she said 
The changes in the cheer­leading program were made for insurance liability, reasons and to change the focus of the program to one that involves less performance and more cheering, according to Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal. 
But Majerek contended that the athletic department did not back up their reasoning. 
At clinics before tryouts, she said, "there was no adult su­pervision and no representation by the athletic department. If they were so concerned about injuries, someone should have been there," she said. 
Fraleigh, who directed the program at the time of the clin­ics, explained that the stunts were under two body lengths high. 
"The clinics were run by the captains, as was the case with all practices, with the stipula­tion that stunts were to go no more than two body lengths high," Fraleigh said.

The condition has become almost chronic. My fear could strike any time-watching the evening news, at_tendin~ a movie or walking down the quad With a fnend. I feel trapped by this horrendous mental condition ... The term homophobia has become quite a "buzzword" the past couple of years. Anyone who disagrees with the lifestyle and behavior o homosexuals is instantly termed a homophobic. T~e problems li~s in the fact that people accept !his term as bemg accurate, when it is highly maccurate. Homophobia is a mental condition. It means an exaggerated and often disabling fear o homosexuals. If we are to believe left-wing homosexual groups, then nearly nine out 10 o us would be incapable of movement. We would be incapable of going to work or school. or functioning in any normal capacity. This is surely not the case. The majority o use do not fell this anxiety, because the majority of. us are not homophobic. What these groups fail to understand is that there is a difference between fearing a lifestyle and simply disagreeing with it. · I believe that everyone is free to pursue the mo~e of happiness. that suits them, as long as their mode of happmess does not interfere with others. If people are happy as homosexuals, that is their right. Yet I also believe I have the right to disagree with their lifestyle. I don't wish homosexuals to die. I don't believe that a homosexual is any less a person than myself. I don't think that a homosexual should be deprived of any freedoms I enjoy. But I am not going to condone homosexuality because someone says I am homophobic. I do not suffer from a mental condition and do not need the treatment of a doctor. Certainly homosexuals do not prefer the lifestyle o heterosexuality, and some homosexuals probably disagree with my heterosexual existence. But how many homosexuals have been called heterophobic? During the 1920's, Josef Stalin order the murder of thousands, possibly millions o peo~le. Homosexuals where singled out specifically to be tortured and killed. Stalin was obviously a homophobic, Stalin was obviously mentally deficient. Isn't it unfortunate that a majority of the population is being lumped into the same category as this monster? No, it is not just unfortunate, it is insulting. Stalin was homophobic. Don't pin that term on me.

De K!erk may take oyer homelands 
 CAPETOWN, South Africa -The government is considering plans to restore South African control over three nominally independent black homelands, a newspaper reported Sunday. Government officials said the report by The Sunday Times was "unfounded speculation." The newspaper reported that President F.W de Klerk's government was considering taking control of Transkei, Ciskei and Venda. It said de Klerk was under pressure from within his National Party because of reports that Transkei's military government has harbored black radicals responsible for a recent wave of attacks on white civilians. A plan to take over the administrations of the three homelands will be put to multi-party constitutional talks later this week, the newspaper said.

ICLU warns schools against prayer 
 SYRACUSE, Ind. -The Indiana Civil Liberties Union is warning state school districts not to consider a vote by students permission to override a ban on prayer at graduations. The ICLU's action was prompted by a vote last week at Wawasee High School, where seniors decided to ~ave stude~ts give prayers at the opening and closing o their graduation ceremony. The district left the decision to the students after the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that prayer at a Rhode Island junior high graduation was unconstitutional. Wawasee seniors had voted 127-14 in favor of prayer early last week. Another vote on Thursday passed 147-10. Alex Tanford, ICLU vice president, said his organization has had calls from several Wawasee school ~istrict resi_dents who are upset by any prayer at gradua­tiOn. He said the ICLU hopes to reach a compromise that would take prayer out of the graduation ceremony without having to go to court.

Panel: Listening will aid race and gender relations 
By MICHAEL O'HARA 
News Writer 
Understanding and listening are needed to alleviate the con­flict between race, gender and society, according to the pan­elists of "When Race and Gen­der Clash!" forum held Sunday. 
The forum featured students, professors and members of the South Bend community. 
"I think we need to recognize both race and gender." Tony a Callahan, Notre Dame sopho­more, said. "Race and gender go hand in hand and are two sides of the same coin." 
Other panelists agreed. "The two are hand in hand because both are discriminating tools used in society," Virginia Calvin, Director of Curriculum for South Bend Community School Corporation, said. 
In a historical perspective, "race is far more important than gender." Washington said. Yet. "race and gender are parallel in regards to the black experience." 
However. when race and gender do clash one will have to take precedence over the other, concluded the panelists. 
"It depends on the situation," Calvin said as to which should take precedence over the other. 
I lilary Hadner. assistant pro­fessor in the department of communications and theatre, agreed. "One has to look at the context," she said. 
But Callahan expressed a somewhat different view. "It does not come down to a spe­cific time," she said. However. there is "never a time for a woman to disrespect herself in order to uphold the black race."

at Saint Joseph's Medical Cen­ter, said that race holds a dif­ferent place than gender. 
"Racism is a defining issue for our culture," he said. "If there was no Civil Rights movement, than there would have been no feminist movement." 
Radner agreed with this point 
and said she saw a  potential  
problem  with  the  feminist  
movement.  

"Part of the problem of the feminist movement is that it tends to exclude other groups," she said. "There is a real dan­ger in the feminist position in that it favors gender (over problems of race). 
"Gender is not the only posi­tion where discrimination takes place," Radner said. 
Callahan said she sees this problem as well. "I think women fail to realize they must face a question of gender and of race." 
Because of the position of African-American women, they must sometimes compete with their male counterparts. This competition, according to Smith, is straining male/female relationships in the African­American community. 
The male perspective should be "l am not trying to take the whole show but rather share the show with you," Smith said. 
lrv Smith, Notre Dame senior, also said he felt instead of the male or female "making it" the entire African-American community should make it." 
Calvin, however, disagreed. 
"The male of color is less likely to succeed than a female of color," she said. 
But Clarence Thomas did succeed by succeeding Thur­good Marshall on the Supreme

Court. 
"What he (Thomas) did, if that be fact, was wrong," Callahan said. "Clarence Thomas has done nothing for the black race ... I am not sure how much of a black male Clarence Thomas is." 
Smith had more of a problem with Anita Hill's side of the is­sue, but not with what she stood for. 
"Anita Hill had the right, my problem is with the timing," Smith said. "The problem is not what Anita Hill did, but when she did it.

"The bad light was not just on Clarence Thomas, but on the black race," Smith said. 
The panel tended to agree that the solution could be found if people listened to each other. 
"We need to listen with un­derstanding," Tina Buchanon, Saint Mary's senior, said. 
But according to Calvin, "Understanding is not coming fast enough." 
She said that nothing could be achieved until "we have ad­dressed the issue of race ... until we address the issue of race we are all talking to the wilder­ness." 
Callahan agreed to issue of difference needing to be ad­dressed. 
"We do have differences, we are all different people, that's what we need to realize and that's what we need to share," she said. 
Washington also saw a need for respect. 
"We really do need to respect others, love ourselves, and cel­ebrate our diversity," he said. "I think we all have a lot to learn."

Yeltsin, Khasbulatov survive removal vote 
MOSCOW (AP) -Bot.h Presi­dent Boris Yeltsin and his chief political rival claimed victory Sunday after surviving an at­tempt by the Hussian Congress to remove them from office. 
But the secret ballot by the Congress of 
... People's Deputies left the country's political crisis unresolved 
after a Boris Yeltsin dramatic day of rejected compromise and huge street rallies. "A communist coup has failed. The people have won," Yeltsin told thousands of cheer­ing supporters outside the Kremlin after the vote. Waving his fist, he then led the crowd in a chant of "Hussia! Russia! Russia!" 
Despite the euphoria, Yeltsin is now in the same predicament he faced before the Congress 
convened Friday. He vowed to press ahead with an April 25 referendum to resolve his power struggle with the parliament, dominated by former Communists who want 

. to slow his free-market re­forms. 
The parliament's electoral commission announced 617 legislators cast their ballots for Yeltsin's ouster, short of the 689 votes, or two-thirds of the Congress, needed to remove him. 
Only 339 lawmakers voted to replace his rival, parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov. At least 517 votes, a simple ma­jority of the 1,033-member Congress, would have been needed to replace the 50-year­old parliament leader. 
The vote followed Congress' rejection of a compromise pro­posed by Yeltsin and Khasbula­tov in an effort to end t!Hlir po­litical battle. 
The compromise enraged the legislators because it would have eliminated the Congress -and their jobs -in favor of a smaller, bicameral legislature. 
After the vote was an­nounced, the Congress ad­journed until Monday. Khasbu­latov thanked the lflgislators for their support and said he was surprised by the outcome. 
"During the three years that I have filled this post ... I thought many more deputies had reason to be dissatisfied with me," he said. 
Khasbulatov added that the voting signaled the need for a change in Yeltsin's economic reforms. "When an enormous number of deputies ... almost remove the president from of­fice, we all have to think about this signal very seriously."

Bresnahan: Compassion needed in care for the dying 
By ROB ADAMS News Writer 
Hospitals must be able to re­
vive the spirit of humility in 
their care for the dying, 
according to Father James 
Bresnahan, who spoke Friday 
on compassionate care for the 
dying. 
"At this point in history, each of us must take responsibility as an exercise of freedom to prepare for death," Bresnahan said. "We must start now to express this personal responsi­bility for our own death to avoid wasteful care." 
Bresnahan is not in favor of artificial means of prolonging life. "We must plan to manage our deaths by preparing testa­ments which would allow us to forego burdensome treatment at the end of life," he said. 
Bresnahan believes that hospice care, a method which involves constant attention from hospital employees and no machines. best exemplifies the necessary care for the dy­ing. 
"We need personal, social, and compassionate care for the dying. We must respond to the aging's fear of death by listen­ing to their life in review and helping them figure out who they are," Bresnahan said. 

Friends don t let friends drive drunk. 
"With hospice, there is no 
need to ask to be killed, we can 
act freely wit!l regard to dying, 
and we can all understand for 
ourselves what we take to be 
the meaning of death," said 
Bresnahan. 

Many people think they can 
play a game with death, he 
said. But postponing death only 
makes it harder to accept, and 
people still struggle with the il­
lusion of immortality, he said. 
Giving up trying to control death makes one more inde­pendent, Bresnahan said. Death should be accepted as part of the human condition. 
"We must regain the mobility to let the barriers of morality down and look for the kind of political response that would support hospice care," said Bresnahan. 
"We live in a culture where physician-assisted death is OK, where aging people cannot trust the people in the hospital to know when to stop, and where some older people think that the only way to avoid pro­longed treatment is rational suicide," said Bresnahan. 
"We must honor our ideals, realize that death is inevitable, learn how to care for the dying, and do it well, through hospice care," Bresnahan said.

Religion is changing with times 
By AMY SANTANGELO 
News Writer 

As the country moves to ac­cept its diverse population. American churches are evolving to meet the needs of their members, according to Professor R. Stephen Warner of the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
"Churches can flourish when they articulate the cultural differences of their members," said Warner. If religion can change and adapt to meet the new demands of society, it cannot help but grow in strength and influence. 
Warner presented a lecture Friday on the topic of the "New Paradigm in th.e Sociology of American Religion." 
The "new paradigm" refers to the American experience of religion, which is quite differ­ent from the traditional paradigm of European secular­ization, he said. The current trend of worship is toward openness and disestablishment of the churches. 
Warner encountered this new attitude toward religion during a field trip to a liberal Protestant church in Chicago, where 90 percent of the con­gregation is male, and a majority of the couples are same sex. 
Warner said he saw life and enthusiasm atnong the con­gregation. They sang, held hands, cried, laughed, and took an active part in tho liturgy. The normal communion rite that takes about ten minutes in a Cathedral, took a half hour. he said. The female pastor took time with each person or cou­ple as they received commu­nion. 
This visit was the impetus to­ward the writing of Communi· ties in Faith, his most recent book. 
The thesis of his book is that homosexual churches will exist and no one has power enough to stop them. In the book, he discussed various topics about America and roligion that sup­port his idea. 
The book discusses religious freedom in America that allows people to start new religions. He emphasizes the idea of religious pluralism, the idea that the various ethnic groups in the U.S. can only enhance American religious variety, and its connection to religion. 
These groups embed Ameri­can traditions into their wor­ship practices, while maintain­ing their own autonomy, he said. 
Warner also presents the idea of a New Voluntarism in religion, which advocates that people are no longer required to accept the roligion "given" to them at birth. Rather, they are being offered many possibilities from which they may choose.

E
very year, a lot ofpeople make a huge mistake on their taxes.They don't take advantage of tax deferral and wind up sending Uncle Sam money they could be saving for retirement. 
Fortunately, that's a mistake you can easily avoid with TIAA-CREF SRAs. SRAs not only ease your current tax-bite, they offer a remarkably easy way to build retirement income-especially for the "extras" that your regular pension and Social Security benefits may not cover. Because your contributions are made in before-tax dollars, you pay less taxes now. And since all earnings on your SRA are tax-deferred as well, the money you don't send to Washington works even harder for you. Down the road, that can make a dramatic difference in your quality of life. 

What else makes SRAs so special? A range ofallocation choices-from the guaranteed security of TIAA to the diversified investment accounts of CREF's variable annuity-all backed by the nation's number one retirement system.

SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS WEEK 
Survivor has pushed memories into past 
Dear Editor: 
I don't think about it every day anymore. I have managed to recover both physically and psychologically. I have pushed those memories to the very back of my mind. I am no longer afraid of every man that I meet, and I no longer blame myself for what happened. I have regained my self-confi­dence and I am whole once again. But it was not always this way. 
I used to replay the events of that night over and over again in my head: the drinking, "hooking up," breaking pari­etals, laying in bed with him, falling asleep, and finally, wak­ing up to the sharp pain of a man's penis inside me for the first time. 
I wanted to scream, to cry, to run out the door, but I could do nothing. Later that morning I tried to convince myself that it was only a dream. The blood­stained sheets, however, told 
~ Y'" 
me that it was real. 
I had a hard time accepting that I had been raped by some­one that I had known and trusted. This is Notre Dame, after all, where bad things don't happen to good people. 
I hated myself for having al­lowed him to take control of me. I consider myself a strong person, and so this violation was devastating to me. It was as if he ripped a piece of my soul away. 
In the three years since the rape I have had to rebuild my self-confidence, my trust in others, and my faith in myself. No one would ever guess from observing me today that I was once a helpless victim. Today I refer to myself as a survivor. I write this letter not to elicit sympathy or pity but to inform this community that rape hap­pens at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's.

C.A.R.E. wants to help rape victims 
Dear Editor: 
We, the chairpersons of ND/SMC C.A.R.E. (Campus Al­liance for Rape Elimination), would like to explain the pur­pose of the letters found in to­day's Viewpoint. These letters were written by ND/SMC stu­dents who are survivors of sex­ual assault. We thank and commend them for their courage and honesty in writing about an issue that is very per-

Talking about assault is first step back 
Dear Editor: 
I am a Notre Dame senior. Five years ago, when I was a junior in high school, I lost my virginity to a rapist. At first, I only blamed myself because I liked him, I went to school with him, and at the time of the rape, I was drunk. It wasn't until my freshman year at Notre Dame that I realized that I was raped and that I was not at fault for what had happened to me. 
Sophomore year at Notre Dame, a close friend of mine told me that she was raped, a year earlier, in a situation simi­sonal and difficult to talk about. 

Our hope in publishing these letters is to sensitize the mem­bers of our community to the occurrence of sexual assault. National statistics indicate that one out of every four women will be assaulted in her lifetime and that 10% of all rape victims are male. 
These statistics indicate that sexual assault affects many people-both women and men. 
Jar to mine. It made me feel strong to be there for her and to support her through her traumatic experience. 
Through my four years at Notre Dame, I have been able to talk to many women about my rape experience and have surprisingly discovered that a large number of these women at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's have had some type of sexual assault experience in their lives, also. 
By telling my story, I have been able to come to terms with my rape. I know that being raped has forced me to become

who I am today. I am a happy, self-confident, successful woman who is going to make sure my experience will benefit others, as I plan to attend graduate school next fall to receive a degree that focuses on social service. 
The rape will never leave my past. I know that I am not the only woman who has been a victim of rape. I also know that I do not want other women to be forced to experience the trauma of rape. I am a survivor and I will continue to fight for the survival of others.

SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS WEEK 
Assaults can steal childhood Assaulted woman could be 
Dear Editor: 
As graduation rapidly ap­proaches, I have found myself evaluating my time here at Notre Oame. While not com­pletely unique. I believe my ex­pllriences here havll been quite different from those of many others. They are unique in that during my freshman year while my friends worried over grades, parties and boyfriends. I was faced with the painful ordeal of remembering sexual abuse which occurred during my childhood. 
The abuse that I endured was inflicted upon me by my grand­father. My grandparents lived with my family and because my parents were unable to spend much time with the family, I looked to my grandparents as my primary caretakers. During my childhood my grandfather was the most important person in my life and I trusted him and loved him more than anyone else. 
That all changed, however, my freshman year of college when I began remembering the abuse. I had managed to suppress it for many years but I finally reached a point where I had to face the ugly, painful truth. 
Once I began remembering the abuse, my life became a liv­ing nightmare. I felt so many emotions at once: hurt, anger, betrayal, sadness, guilt and shame. I could not believe what I was remembering and I just wanted to hide from everyone and everything. I felt like my whole childhood was a lie, and in the instant that I remem­bered the abuse, I felt like !lost my childhood. 
This issue consumed my be­ing and I withdrew into myself to protect myself from others. I naturally assumed it was im­possible for me to ever trust or depend on anyone ever again since the one person I cared about the most in my childhood betrayed my trust and hurt me as no one had ever hurt me before. 

It took a long time for me to muster the courage to talk about the abuse for I had con­vinced myself that others would be horrified and would some­how hold me responsible. 
Working through the abuse has been a long uphill battle. I never knew anything could be so painful and difficult and quite often. so all-consuming. As I have worked through the abuse, however, I have grown an incredible amount and it has shaped me into the person I am today. 
I am a much more compas­sionate and sensitive person because of my own life's expe­riences. The one good I see as a result of the abuse is being able to use my own experiences to help others work through theirs. I am now able to recog­nize my own strengths and abilities and I realize that I am not a victim but a survivor . 
.Although there was a time when I was upset that my time here at Notre Dame was so dif­ferent than the majority of others, I have come to see the beauty in that difference. Re­membering the abuse and working through it has changed my time at Notre Dame but it has definitely been a change for the better. 
My focus has been redirected to areas and issues that are of true value and importance and I cherish those people who have been true friends and have walked my difficult path with me. I am grateful that I was given the opportunity to change myself for the better and that I was able to change my future by working through my past.

Woman lives with fear and pain 
Dear Editor: 
I never thought a vacation could turn into a traumatic ex­perience until I was a sopho­more in high school. My aunts, my brother, and I drove from the North to Miami in a little Ford Escort. As we entered Florida, the sun shone bright and radiated its humid heat upon us. An aura of happiness, joy and love surrounded us as we arrived at my cousins' home. 
When we reached our desti­nation, we piled out of the car and headed for the beach. Un­fortunately for us albino north­erners, the sun's hllat was a little too shiny. Needless to say. I fried. My brother, a freshman in high school, was under­standing I helped to put mois­turizer on my burnt back. 
I remember laying on my stomach, totally exhausted, and thinking what a great guy my brother was! The next thing I knew, I was on my back with my brother on top of me saying. "Do not scream. You do not want someone to know what is going on in here." lie got up and locked the door. 
I was never so seared in all my life, even though I had be­come accustomed to my brother's violence. As I lay there, I remembered his violent 

sitting next to you right now 
Dear Editor: 
I was molested when I was 13 years old. My mother always told me to beware of strangers. She never told me to beware of family. That's right, I'm an incest survivor, and I go to Notre Dame. 
Now, I am an adult. I've had a relatively successful academic career thus far; I have many wonderful friends; I even have a healthy relationship with a man whom I love very much. Many people (including myself) would say I am a well-adjusted individual. 
Yet, when I am around this particular uncle, I feel as if I'm 13 again. Somehow, what hap­pened is once again my fault-even though logically I know this isn't true. The responsibility of dealing with the situation is mine. The pain and discomfort are all mine. With my family (those who know about the molestation), personal loyalties are divided: they love me, but they love him, too. 

They don't know how to rec­oncile their feelings, so they don't discuss it. Therefon~. I am alone as his mere presence drains my self-esteem-which I have worked so hard to regain. 
I know this is all pretty deso­late, but I didn't write this lettnr to invoke your pity. Please, don't get depressed about this. Get angry, because anger yields action. If you are angry about what has happened to me and millions of others, act. Haise your awareness. Become involved in the struggle against sexual assault. 
And for those of you who don't care, I only ask that you keep your sentiments to your­self. Who knows-! might be sitting right next to you.

behavior from the past year. During that period he would throw me into cupboards, downstairs and punishing me until I bruised. Then I realized what was really happening -I was being raped by one of the people I loved and trusted most in the world. He was my best friend. I remember thinking, "Why is he doing this?" I must be an awful person. I felt dirty, angry. humiliated, scared and confused all at the same time. I did not think I could ever look him in the face again without remembering that day. 
I kept thinking, "I must have done something to provoke the attack. It was all my fault." I cried myself to sleep for weeks. My parents thought I had gone psycho on them. Little did they know my fear and actions re­sulted from an incident that has scarred my life forever. 
I did not tell anyone about this until I was a senior in high school. Telling someone was very difficult since I never be­fore dealt with the rape. I never went to counseling or a help or support group. For two years, I lived in constant fear of my brother. I never though I could trust him again. My friend helped me realize that the rape was not my fault. I was still a good person who was capable of loving someone else, being loved by someone else and genuinely caring. This experience has made a definite impact on my life and I find it hard to trust males, even if they are my best friends. Now that I am in college, I have male friends and would not trade them for the world. 
I have a friend whom I would hate to lose. lie knows the story of my brother and sympathizes with me. He gives me encouragement and protects me from uncomfortable situa­tions. But even under his pro­tective wing, I fear I will be hurt again. Hopefully, someday this fear will vanish and I will feel the pain subside. But until then, I live with the fear of rape and my brother.

Three Irish men qualify for IC4A's 
By SEAN SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
The men's track team had an exemplary weekend. The team split off into three separate 
squads that competed at North Carolina State, Purdue and Eastern Kentucky. At all three of these meets the team had 

q u a I i t y Jon Smerek 
performances. 
At Purdue, Tom Mescall high jumped 6'9 1/2" and long jumped 23' 6". Dan Grenough pole vaulted 15' 3" and placed second. 
"Dan did a real fine job," said Irish head track coach Joe Pi-ane. 
At Eastern Kentucky, Chris Lilly set a big time personal record by running the high hurdles in 14.46 seconds. Ray Holder won the long jump with a mark of 22'8 1/4" and he won the triple jump with a mark of 23' 5". Joe Dunlop placed sec­ond in the 5000 meters with a time of 15.23.08. And finally Mike Dierks won the 800 me­ters. 
"We had a good meet. Ev­eryone that went down there competed really well," said Notre Dame Track coach John Miller who attended the meet at Eastern Kentucky. "However, the weather was a lot nicer in South Bend than it was there so it may have played a role in some of the performances." 
At North Carolina State, Brian Headrick placed second in the high jump. Jon Smerek and Stuart Tyner both qualified for the IC4A's in the discuss. 
Piane said, "The 4 x 1500 meter relay team did a credible job." The team finished fourth. 
Keith O'Brien finished thirrd in the all freshman 1500 meter run with a time of 3:56. 
Finally, also at North Carolina, John Cowan placed second in the 3000 meter steeple chase and qualified for the IC4A's. 
"But when you consider he ran in a driving rain storm and a hail storm he did a terrific job," remarked Piane. "It was less than ideal conditions, but he still ran very well." 
"All in all we had a good weekend. The guys competed well. What we're trying to em­phasize is not necessarily trying to get a particular time or jumping a particular distance or getting a particular height, but just competing," said Piane, "All the good marks will come if you compete well." 
Wet conditions don't dampen women's performances 
By MIKE NORBUT 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame women's track team competed at East­ern Kentucky and North Carolina St. this past weekend against not only some tough east coast competition, but also some rough weather. 
The elements played a key role in limiting individual ef­forts on Friday and Saturday. Hail pounded the track in Raleigh, NC, and poor weather conditions forced the Irish to scratch runners in several late events. Despite the conditions, the team felt good about returning to racing form in their first outdoor meet of the season. 
"I believe we needed the rest, but it felt good to race again," said Kala Boulware, who com­peted at Eastern Kentucky Sat­urday. "With a month off, we felt fresh at the meet this weekend." 
Before the weather halted activities at Eastern Kentucky, exceptional performances were turned in by Emily Husted, who was second in the 1500 and the top Irish finisher in the 800 meter run. Kristi Kramer finished in second place in the 5000 meter run, and freshman Erica Peterson led the team in the sprinting categories. 
At the Raleigh Relays, Sarah Riley and Stefanie Jensen

Rain hampers Winthrop Invitational 

By DOMINIC AMOROSA Sports Writer 
While Notre Dame students played outside in warm and sunny South Bend for the weekend, the Notre Dame soft­ball team continued their string of bad weather in Rock Hill, SC. 
Instead of completing seven games in a warm environment, the Irish only had the chance to play twice on Friday before rain wiped out the rest of the schedule. 
The two games produced an extra inning 3-2 loss to the University of South Florida and a 8-0 romp over Mercer Uni­versity to improve Notre Dame's record to 9-7 on the year. 
"It was a tough situation to play only two games," said coach Liz Miller. "We can't control the weather and it's be­come really frustrating." 
"We need to get more games in," added Miller. "It might hurt us in terms of regional competition because other teams did play." 
In Friday's 9:00 AM contest against South Florida, the Irish broke out to a 2-0 lead in the top of the third inning. After singles by seniors Ronny Al­varez and Lisa Miller to start the inning, junior shortstop Christy Connoyer doubled to score both runs. 
"We finally came out ready to play in a morning game," said co-captain Alvarez. "Unfortunately, they came back and caught us." 
After cutting the deficit to 2-1 in the fifth inning, South Florida scored an unearned run in the sixth to tie the score at two. The score remained

tied at the end of regulation, and the teams played international tiebreaker rules for the extra inning period. The rules state that the previous inning's last batter starts on second base with no outs. 
The Irish had the first shot at it, but failed to score. South Florida scored in the bottom half of the inning on a check swing base hit to win it. 
"One mistake in the sixth, and bad luck in the eighth inning lost it for us," commented Miller. "It was a fluke hit, but it cost us a victory." 
Freshman Terri Kobata went the distance on the mound for the Irish. Her record fell to 3-2, but she gave up only three hits, while striking out ten and walking one. "I made some I pitched well," said Kobata. 
Kobata has allowed only 17 hits in 33 innings pitched for the season. Also, she has struck out 36 batters. "The whole team working together has really helped me on the mound," continued Kobata. 
At the plate, the Irish re­mained in their mini-hitting slump with only five hits. Al­varez's two singles and Con­noyer's double were the high­lights. 
Fortunately for Notre Dame, their bats came alive in the second game of the day. They pounded out 13 hits, while freshman pitcher Kara Brandenburg limited Mercer to only two hits in seven innings. Brandenburg improved her record to 2-0 for the year. 
"We came alive at the plate, because Andrea Keys and Sara Hayes got us going," said Miller. 
The two sophomores pro­duced seven hits between them and drove in five of Notre Dame's runs. Keys had four hits and Hayes contributed three. Brandenburg helped her own cause with a two out bases loaded double which drove in three runs. 
"Mercer wasn't really a good team," said Alvarez. "But we did play well." 
Coming up for the Irish, they open their home schedule at the new complex across from the Eck Pavilion on Tuesday against Indiana. They face Western Michigan on Thurs­day. 
"We're finally coming back home," said Alvarez. "We're fired up about this week." 
"It's our home opener," concluded Miller. "We're ex­cited and we'll be ready to go."

own. 

A key to Notre Dame's defen­sive revitalization was the in­sertion of sophomore goalie Ryan Jewell, at the end of the first quarter, to replace senior Chris Parent. Jewell responded with aggressive goal play, chasing down loose balls and securing key possessions for the Irish, at a time when the team could have easily withered under Hobart's offensive attacks. 
"I was psyched to go in be­
cause the team was in a bind 
and really needed me to step up 
and stop the ball," Jewell said. 
"Hobart had an organized and 
patient offense which made us 
be patient and work the ball 
out of our zone up to the 
offense so we could get back in 
the game." 
With the halftime score 8-7 in 
Hobart's advantage, Notre 
Dame scrapped and clawed to 
an 11-11 tie after three quar­
ters. The Irish offensive finally 
cracked the Hobart defense for 
four goals with three of those 
coming from Colley, who would 
finish with five goals and two 
assists on the afternoon. 
So the scene was set for the 
fateful fourth quarter, and after 
senior attacker Bo Perriello 
scored four minutes into the 
quarter, the Irish were once 
again on top and looked as 
though they had finally climbed 
out of the hole they had dug for 
themselves. 
Hobart, however, was not 
through, and after scoring 
three unanswered goals, took a 
14-12 lead with four minutes 
remaining. Then freshman 
middie Greg Glenday scored an 
improbable goal by swatting a

Kevin Mahoney past the un­suspecting Hobart goalie. 
With the score at 14-13, Sny­der and Colley took over, pro­ducing the game-ending heroics. 
"We'd battled back the whole game, and we weren't going to let it slip away in overtime," Ahmuty said. 
Butler next for streaking Irish lacrosse

over Hobart on Saturday, 
Notre Dame (6-0) must 
regroup and focus their 
attention nn Monday 
afternoon's game against the 
Butler Bulldogs at 3:00 at 
Moose Krause Stadium. 
Because Butler lacrosse is 
in their initial season as a 
varsity sport, their team is 
made up of junior college 
players and freshman. Coach 
Kevin Corrigan describes the 
Bulldogs as it "good, unsettled 
team that will play 
aggressively." 
After coming off such an 
emotional high with their 
comeback victory. the Irish 
will have to guard against an 
emotional letdown that could 
result from playing an 
opponent that the Irish should 
have no problem with. 
"The team realizes what is 
at stake here, so I don't think we'll have any problem with a letdown. We only play 14 games a year, so therefore it isn't difficult to get the players focused on what we .. have to get done," explain~:Jd

Blame it on his teammates, who picked up the slack in overtime, leading the Tar Heels back to the Final Four, where they are frequent visitors, but rarely the honored guests. 
Kansas is another Final Four punching bag. The Jayhawks have been to four of the last eight of these yearly get to­gethers, winning only in 1988.

Powerful LSU defeats men's tennis 
Irish win just two matches against sixth-ranked Tigers 
By JONATHAN JENSEN 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame men's tennis team, playing its eighth match against a top-ten team this season, fell to the sixth-ranked LSU Tigers 5-2 in Baton Rouge, La. 
Coming in, the 16th­ranked Irish thought they would have a chance to pull the upset if they could

doubles point to begin the match. However, the Tigers stormed out of the blocks, winning all three dou­bles matches and setting the tone for the match. 
Notre Dame's tenth-ranked tandem of Will Forsyth and Chuck Coleman were first upset in a wild affair by LSU's Michael Wesbrooks and Juha Pesola, 9-8 (9-7), in the top doubles match. In two-doubles, Mark Schmidt and Todd Wilson dropped a 8-5 decision to the team of Tamer El Sawy and

Alex Guevara, and in the third match seniors Ron Rosas and Chris Wojtalik fell to Ryan Ideta and Chad Dudley by the same score. 
Unfortunately for the Irish, LSU's dominance continued into the singles matches. At the Irish's win at the Blue-Gray Classic two weeks ago, they were continually able to over­come the loss of the doubles point because of st-rong singles play. However, this was not the case against the Tigers, who boast a dePp lineup featuring three ranked players. 
At one-singles, Forsyth fell to Egypt's Tamer El Sawy, cur­rently the fourth-ranked singles player in the nation, by a 6-1, 6-0 score. El Sawy has been nearly unbeatable this year, going 27-3 with all three losses coming to players ranked among the top five. 
One bright spot for the Irish was Coleman's 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) upset win over Finland's Juha Pesola, who was ranked 32nd in the country. The loss drops Pesola's record to 11-2, and should push the 51st-ranked Coleman up in the next ITA rankings. 
The Irish got another win from Rosas at four-singles, who beat Guevara 7-5, 6-2, but dropped the remaining singles matches. 
Schmidt lost to the 90th­ranked Wesbrooks, 6-3, 6-0, and freshman Mike Sprouse fell to Ideta, 6-2, 6-1, but it took Dudley two tiebreakers to dis­pose of Wilson. The 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (9-7) marathon at five-sin­gles characterizerl the match for the Irish, who gave it their all but just could not help suc­cumbing to a superior team on their home court. 
The loss drops the Irish to 13­8, and will most likely be the last time the Irish will face off against a ranked team before the NCAA Championships in May. Until then the Irish will be tackling some of the Midwest's best teams. 
With solid performances they should be able to secure an automatic bid to the NCAAs, which is afforded to the best team in the Midwest.

Irish lacrosse handles Hobart in a thriller 
By KEVIN MCGUIRE Sports Writer 
In possibly the most exciting lacrosse game to ever be played in Notre Dame history. the 16th-ranked Irish battled back from a five goal deficit to defeat Division Ill powerhouse Hobart College 15-14 in overtime. 
As a result of their courageou's comeback. the Irish vaulted over Georgetown to claim the 14th slot in this week's United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association's coaches' poll. This is the highest Notre Dame has ever been ranked. 
The Irish had to overcome an apathetic start as well as an extremely quick and aggressive Statesman team in order to be in position to tie the game in the 4th quarter and force overtime. 
The hero of the game was junior attacker Hobbie Snyder, who seored the tying goal with eight seeonds remaining in the game, and then put the winner home with 59 seconds left in sudden death overtime. Both goals came off feeds from fellow junior attaeker Randy Colley. It was ironic that Snyder, who had four gaols and an assist. scored the crunch-time goals because he hails from Geneva. N.Y., living only minutes from the Hobart campus. 
"It was kind of weird seoring the tying and winning goals against Hobart because they were the one team on the schedule that I really didn't want to play because I grew up rooting for them and I knew most of the guys on the team." 
Snyder explained. 
As for the last hectic minutes of the fourth quarter and overtime, "I was nervous yet confident we'd get the goals. Each time Randy did a great job of drawing the defenders and then finding me wide open on the backside so I could score," said Snyder. 
Coach Kevin Corrigan was impressed with how the team reacted to the pressure of the moment and not allowing themselves to be beaten. "Not for one second did the team get down or demoralized. It was always what we were going to do to win. Our concentration was tremendous. we always focused on the positive, always looking ahead." he explained. 
But from the way the Irish began the game, it looked as though there would be no way that they would be in any position to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. 
After sophomore defenseman Mike Iorio took the ball the length of the field and scored the first goal of the game for the Irish, llobart quickly regained their composure and looked much like a team that was going to teach the #16 Irish a painful lesson. 
Hobart responded by rattling off four unanswered goals, and after junior midfielder Willie Sutton scored at the 
6:25 mark, proceeded to score three more times before the quarter ended, establishing a 7-3 lead. Hobart was clearly the more aggressive team in the game's first quarter. witnessed by the fact that they gobbled up 27 ground 
Women's tennis upsets Clemson 
By AlAN AKEY Sports Writer 
Has the 23rd-ranked Notre Dame women's tennis tnam been watching the NCAA basketball tournament? More specifically, have the Irish been watching Kentucky mercilessly thrash every opponent in its path? 
They might well have been. because in the last two weeks. Notre Dame's level of play has certainly been Wildcatesque. In six matches the Irish have claimed six wins, but more impressive is the level of dominance that they have displayed in achieving the victories. 
During one four-match stretch, Notre Dame won 35 consecutive singles and doubles matches, shutting out Drake. Michigan. Kansas State, and most recently Miami (Ohio). On Sunday, though the Irish finally gave up three of six singles matehes, they again swept the doubles to claim a 6-3 llpset win OVIH 19th-ranked Clemson,

"I really don't know what happened at the end," said Tholen. "Even when I was down early, I never felt like I was out of the match. I guess I just sort of lost it at the end, though."

"They were a very quick and athletic team that came out with an aggressive game-plan. They were ready for us, and did a great job executing," Corrigan said. "I don't know what it was with us, whether we were overconfident or a little flat at the beginning." 
The Irish looked better in the second period behind Snyder's two goals and junior midfielder Billy Ahmuty's two assists. They controlled the ball better and began to match Hobart's aggressiveness with strong play of their
