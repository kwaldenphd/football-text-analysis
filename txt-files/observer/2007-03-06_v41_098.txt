ND plans construction ofnew donn 
By KEN FOWLER News Writer 
Notre Dame will break ground Thursday on the all­male Duncan Hall, the first of four new dormitories the University hopes to build in the next 10 years. 
The new building, funded by 1952 Notre Dame graduate Raymond T. Duncan, will be completed by the summer of 2008 and house students that fall, Executive Vice President John Affleck-Graves said Monday. 
"We put it on accelerated time schedule because we're very eager [to finish the proj­ect)," Aflleck-Graves said. "We know that there's urgent needs on campus right now." 
Duncan Hall will house 232 students and stand next to McGlinn Hall, which was the last dorm built by the University, completed in 1997. 
The University is not disclos­ing the total cost of the dorm, said Shannon Chapla, assistant director for News and Information. 
Chapla said Duncan Hall will ease the housing crunch in men's dorms that have con­verted spaces to increase occu­pancy, but she could not pro­vide a breakdown of what reductions individual dorms would see. 
Affleck-Graves said the University has three main goals for Duncan Hall and the three other dorms it wants to build: Reduce the stress of overcrowding in current dorms, accommodate more transfer students with addi­tional on-campus housing options and allow juniors and seniors more on-campus living arrangements with more sin­gles, doubles and triples. 
Duncan Hall will feature six

Portions of roads closed 
Three campus streets cordoned offfor work 
By EVA BINDA News Writer 
Three internal campus roads closed Monday to begin a new phase of construction that will make the campus more pedestri­an-friendly, said Vice President of Business Operations Jim Lyphout. 
The University closed sections of St. Joseph Drive, Moose Krause Drive and Juniper Road so work­ers can remove Juniper Road, realign parking lots and extend underground utilities, particularly the sewers, Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) said in a March 1 e-mail. 
Lyphout said this construction is part of the "campus master plan that was written in 2002 and adopted by the Board of Trustees." 
This plan will reduce the num­ber of vehicles traveling through campus by routing traffic around the perimeter of campus, he said. 
Another goal of the construction project is to improve the campus sewer system. 
Lyphout said working on the sewers is necessary to increase their capacity since the campus has grown, making the current system insufficient. 
The construction crews are tak­ing precautionary safety meas­ures while they work on this new group of construction projects, University Architect Doug Marsh

Fleming hopes to excel in role 
New vice president ofacademic affairs is excited to join administration 
By KELLY MEEHAN Saint Mary's Editor 
When Patricia Fleming visit­ed Notre Dame for an academ­ic conference in 1975, she said she could not help but notice the quaint campus across the street. And 32 years later, she's been named Saint Mary's vice presi­dent of aca­d e m i c affairs and dean of fac­

ulty. 
Fleming, a California native, was named vice president of Saint Mary's on Feb. 20 and will begin her duties on July 1. 
"I believe that Saint Mary's is the best Catholic women's College in the nation," she said. "I want to work at the best ... I want to return to the kind of college which formed me as a scholar and leader." 
Fleming will replace acting Vice President and Dean of Faculty Jill Vihtelic, who will return to the Department of Business Administration and Economics as a full-time mem­ber of the faculty this fall. 
As Vihtelic makes the move from the administration to the classroom, Fleming plans to put her passion for philosophy aside to guide the College's academic realm. 
During her visits to Saint Mary's, Fleming said she admired the College's teacher­scholar model -a system she said she shared with other members of the faculty. 
"My teaching really profits from my scholarship," she said, "especially in the area of envi­ronmental ethics. But for me my scholarship also needs to connect back to the ways we can transform lives through the classroom." 
Fleming said her time at Holy Names College in Oakland, Calif., and Marygrove College in Detroit "contributed to [her] formation in distinct ways when [she] was 17-21 years old." 
She said the foundation of her growth was her learning

Degree recipients na111ed 
Supreme Court justice among 2007 honorees 
By KELLY MEEHAN Saint Mary's Editor 
A U.S. Supreme Court justice, an advocate for Philadelphia's homeless population and a the­ologian will be the recipients of honorary degrees during Saint Mary's com­mencement ceremonies, College offi­c i a l s announced Monday. 
U.S. Sup­reme Court Justice Samuel Alito -who will also address the 2007 gradu­ates -will be the recipient of an honorary degree, along with Sister Mary Scullion, co­founder and executive director of Project H.O.M.E. (Housing, Opportunities for employment, Medical care, Education) and Dr. Bernard McGinn, the Naomi Shenstone Donnelly Professor Emeritus at the University of Chicago Divinity School. 
Executive Assistant to the President Susan Dampeer said this year's recipients fulfill the College's quest for "someone who has achieved the highest level of success within their field and made a difference in the world." 
Dampeer said the honorees are chosen in a method similar to the commencement speak­er's selection.

Student travel safety tops University priorities 
Anthony Travel books band, sports team trips with reputable, insured bus companies 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
When Notre Dame student athletes or members of the University Marching Band travel away from campus to play at other locations, their safety is "always number one," said Pat Walsh, the vice presi­dent of business services at Anthony Travel. 
Walsh said the travel agency in LaFortune arranges approx­imately 300 bus trips a year for the varsity sports teams ­and during those trips, there's always the possibility of an accident like the one last week involving the Bluffton University baseball team. 
A bus carrying the team from Toledo, Ohio to spring training in Florida drove off an overpass in Atlanta and crashed onto a pickup truck traveling below. Six people were killed -including four students -and 29 others were injured. 
That means for each of these trips, safety is a huge concern, Walsh said. 
"Notre Dame does absolutely everything to ensure the safety of student athletes, coaches, staffs and administrators," he said. "The nice part about an athletic department of Notre Dame's size is that they can afford the best safety possible." 
Notre Dame lived through a tragic accident of its own 15 years ago, Walsh said. 
The women's swim team was returning to South Bend from a meet at Northwestern University in January 1992 when its bus turned over on the Indiana Toll Road. Sophomore Colleen Hipp and freshman Meghan Beeler were killed and 38 others were injured. 
This was a "horrible acci­dent," Walsh said, and one that will "never ever be gone from people's memories here." 
"It was an extremely difficult moment for everyone in the University," Walsh said. "It's a very close reminder that is always foremost in everyone's minds that safety is number one." 
When Anthony Travel arranges trips, it uses bus services that meet high stan­dards of safety, Walsh said. 
"Everyone looks at costs too ... but Notre Dame always makes the decision with the safety standards of that com­pany foremost in mind," Walsh said.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Quinn: status quo 
Forget, for a moment, that Brady Quinn led the Irish to a 10-3 record this season. Forget that he threw for :3,426 yards and 37 touchdowns, third-most in the nation. Forget that he's been under the tute­Bill Brink lage ofone ofthe sport's greatest Sports offensive minds for Production Editor 
two years. 
Ifyou can man­age to do that, you might be able to piece together the reason behind Quinn's sud­den plunge in the pre-NFL draft predic­tions. It's been said he lacks spectacular arm strength. He has a low yards-per­attempt average. His throws over 20 yards float on him. He fails to win big games. But the main culprit behind the reversal of opinion concerning Quinn is LSU quarter­back JaMarcus Russell. 
Russell has a cannon, throws tight deep balls and decidedly outplayed Quinn in the Sugar Bowl. All are legitimate argument<;, but all eventually fall short. 
Poor arm strength? Explain how he hit a diving Jeff Samardzija on Purdue's one­yard line for a 41-yard completion last season, a replay seen before every broad­cast. Or how he found David Grimes between defenders in the corner of the end zone for a 36-yard touchdown against Navy this year. 
Some cite Russell's 9.1 yards per attempt, when compared to Quinn's 7.3 ypa, as evidence that Russell can throw the deep ball better than Quinn. But any­one who watched Notre Dame football this season remembers the three-yard dump­otis to Darius Walker at least once per set of downs, passes that decreased his aver­age. 
Quinn's play unquestionably suffered against Michigan. In the Sugar Bowl, how­ever, Quinn spent the game racing around the pocket to avoid pass rushes. And let us not forget the comeback against UCLA in the final minute of the game, during which Quinn led the team on an 80-yard drive that culminated in Samardzija's winning touchdown catch. 
The fact that Russell has superior arm strength does not make him the superior quarterback. He suffered in big games as well-Russell threw one touchdown and three interceptions two losses to Florida and Auburn. 
The final argument lies in the possibility ofcombining Russell's arm strength with the size and speed of Randy Moss of the Oakland Raiders, who have the first pick of the draft. The Raiders tried something similar in 2004 when they brought in for­mer Giants quarterback Kerry Collins, also known for his strong arm. 
That worked well. Collins played in 29 games for the Raiders, had a 54.9 comple­tion percentage, averaged 6.52 yards per attempt and threw just 14 passes of40 yards or more. 
Without any action in the past two months, imaginations run wild and blow Quinn's potential shortcomings out of pro­portion. Hopefully, completing 58-of-63 passes in his Sunday workout for NFL scouts will reverse that. 
He is still a future franchise quarterback with the size, athleticism, skill and where­withal to be a star in the NFL. Russell, while a great quarterback, is just a novelty pick iftaken No. 1. Let's hope the Raiders keep their head out of the fabricated clouds of suspicion and make the right decision.

Firecrackers cause ostrich to lose sex drive 
BERLIN Three teenagers may be on the hook for a hefty fine if a court decides that their fes­tive firecrackers outside an eastern German farm scared the libido right out of an ostrich named Gustav. 
Rico Gabel, a farmer in Lohsa, northeast of Dresden, is claiming $6,450 in damages for the alleged antics of the three youths, ages 17-18, between Dec. 27 and 29, 2005. 
According to his lawsuit, the farmer claims that fin~­head with a hammer. Richard Edison Johnson, 76, is charged with attempted murder. He is accused of striking Elizabeth Alwine, 81, who was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, officials said. 

Both were residents of the Lend-a-Band retirement home in Davenport. 
Johnson and Alwine were in the smoking area of the building when an argument between the two became violent, said Davenport police Capt. David Struckman. 
Information compiled from the Associated Press. 

works set ofT by the boys made the previously lustful Gustav both apathetic and depressed, and thus unable to perform for a half-a­year with his two female breeding partners. 
Before Gustav regained his sex drive in the second half of the year, the farmer estimates he lost out on 14 ostrich offspring -worth $460 apiece.

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 
Group discusses pornography in male dorms 
By KATHLEEN McDONNELL 
News Writer 
Campus Life Council (CLC) members discussed Monday measures the Conduct Awareness task force can take to alleviate uncomfortable situations arising from pornographic images dis­played in residence halls. 
Carroll Hall rector and task force member Father Jim Lewis said he wanted to open the' debate to the CLC. 
"It is not the desire of this 
Council that we aspire to do some­thing that would be overly intru­sive," Lewis said, "[but] at the same time pornographic images are so counter to the University mission and to our Catholic identi­ty that I feel it bears addressing." 
Professor Gail Bederman, who brought the issue to the CLC last spring, said her female students told her they often feel uncomfort­able entering rooms in male resi­dence halls when there are porno­graphic images displayed either on TV or the walls.

body vice president Bill Andrichik said the committee's investigation focused not on access on a person­al computer -since accessing pornography on the University's server is regulated by the student handbook, du Lac -but instead on displays "either in the dorm room, common rooms or places that could become common space." 
"That goes beyond the person who individually places it and extends it to anyone who walks into your room," he said. 
But Alumni Hall senator Danny Smith said these images are cul­turally pervasive and pointed to a blurred line between what people consider acceptable and objection­able. 
"It's hard sometimes defining what is pornography and what isn't," he said. "The swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated, for example -is that pornographic or is it not?" 
Student un'ion Board (SUB) president Patrick Vassel said the problem is likely related to stu­dents not speaking up in uncom­fortable situations.

"I would say the big problem or topic for discussion on this cam-. pus is on a personal basis," he said, "People say, 'We always hang out in that guys' dorm but I hate those posters on the wall.' If it offends you, tell your friends so." 
But Bederman said the posters suggest a larger problem. 
"The comments tended to come from students who felt that there was an unhealthy sexual climate on campus in that women felt they were being turned into sexual objects," she said. 
With this in mind, Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs G. David Moss advised consulting with the Gender Relations Center (GRC) to start programming that might address pornography and related concerns. 
Andrichik said the task force will look into working with the GRC to further investigate the issue.

These safety measures are "to protect pedestrians from falling into what will be very deep trenches and pits dug into the ground within these areas," Marsh said. 
This construction project should be finished in mid-August before fall classes begin next year, Marsh said. Landscape work will be completed during the fall. 
But Lyphout said Notre Dame Avenue could experience heavy traffic, since he -expects the next couple of years to be "very busy in terms of construction." 
Construction is set to begin on a new Law School this summer and also on an engineering building next year. 
"It's going to take a lot of patience on the part of the Notre Dame community," Lyphout said. 
Marsh also said the campus construction will cause some interruptions to normal campus life. NDSP instructed people who park in. the B, C or Legends lots, for example, to enter from the Edison Road driveways east of Eddy Street. 
"We appreciate very much the campus community's patience with these inconveniences," he said. 
Marsh and Lyphout both said these safety precautions have nothing to do with the gas leak that occurred near the Hesburgh Library a few weeks ago. 
"It's totally independent," Lyphout said. "These precautions are very normal. We try to keep a proper distance from the potential hazards of construction."

EU halts restoring Palestinian ties 
BHUSSELS, Belgium-The European Union will wait until a Palestinian unity govern­ment finalizes its policy toward Israel before deciding whether to restore financing to the Palestinian Authority. 
The issue of whether to offer early encour­agement to the new Palestinian Cabinet ­perhaps even without the condition that the militant llamas movement fulfill internation­al demands on recognizing Israel -domi­nated Monday's meeting of the bloc's 27 for­eign ministers. 
Traditionally pro-Arab nations such as France have been keen to resume direct assistance to the Palestinians after a year­long boycott of the Hamas-led government that economically devastated the Palestinian territories. The bloc's position has been to insist that Harnas recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept past agreements before ties can be re-established. 
"We simply cannot decide yet when, or even if, we will be able to re-engage with the new Palestinian government of national unity because we will need to see its program and we will need to see its actions," said the EU's external relations commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner.

While the procedure is still far more com­mon in adults, it appears to be slightly less risky in teens, according to an analysis of data em 12-to 19-year-olds who had obesity sur­gery from 1996 through 2003.

IINDIANAPOLIS -Pedestrians who fall on icy sidewalks cannot sue adjacent property owners despite an Indianapolis ordinance requiring walks to be cleared, the Indiana Court of Appeals has ruled. 
In the 3-0 ruling, the appeals panel said Denison Parking cannot be sued for damages by a woman who fell on an icy sidewalk in January 2001 outside a parking garage in downtown Indianapolis. 
Barbara L. Davis sued Denison and the city after her hip and back were injured. A Marion Superior Court judge denied Denison's pretrial request for a judgment that would clear the company of liability, and Denison appealed.

Baghdad blast kills 38, wounds 105 
Violence errupts after suicide car bomber and Sunni insurgents target Shiite pilgrims 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD-A suicide car bomber turned a vener­able book market into a deadly inferno and gunmen targeted Shiitfl pilgrims Monday as suspected Sunni insurgents brought major bloodshed back into the lap of their main Shiite rivals. At least 38 people diec;l in the blast and seven pilgrims were killed. 
The violence -after a relative three-day lull in Baghdad -was seen as another salvo in the Sunni extremist campaign to pro­voke a sectarian civil war that could tear apart the Shiite-led government and erase Washington's plans for Iraq. 
The Shiite Mahdi Army militia has so far resisted full-scale retaliation through a combination of self-interest and intense government pressure. But the militia's leader, the rad­ical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, is now being cornered in new ways that have put him on the defensive. 
An expected Cabinet reshuffie could take a seri­ous bite out of al-Sadr's voice in government -a move strongly encouraged by Washington.

experiences with religious women -particularly the Holy Name Sisters who fostered her love of philosophy. Their academ­ic inspiration also motivated Fleming to go on to graduate school at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., where she earned her master's and doctoral degrees in philosophy. 
She also said a foundation of her work is her educational and administrative experience as a philosophy professor at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., where she has taught since 1977. 
At Creighton, she focused on environmental and medical ethics, as well as the philosophies of science and social science. She was appointed to senior associate we encounter today," she said. "The Saint Mary's women I had lunch with in January spoke of their own desires for a more diverse student experience." 

Fleming said she hopes to ere­ate a diverse and enriching edu­cational experience for all stu­dents. 
"I hope that Saint Mary's women will be as proud about Saint Mary's as I am about my undergraduate experiences at Marygrove and Holy Names," she said. 
Fleming said as she works to meet the College community she hopes to model herself after a former Creighton administrator who was greatly admired by the students and faculty because or his openness with the communi­ty. 
"He had a bench [on campus] he sat on when the weather was good," she said. "Some faculty lacrosse team is taking a bus to Chicago to take a flight to

"The bus driver will some-· times get on the intercom and tell us not to walk around or stand in the aisles too much," he said.

dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in 2001. 
Fleming's career will come full circle this summer, however, when she moves into her admin­istrative office on the first floor of Le Mans Hall -a building that she said fosters the school's spirit. 
"Aside from aesthetics, I found Saint Mary's to be a warm, wel­coming and very spirited place," she said. "I loved the way the stu­dents identified themselves as 'Saint Mary's women."' 
And Saint Mary's women will be the central focus of Fleming's goals and plans for the College. 
"I hope to look back at some point in my tenure as Saint Mary's Vice President of Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty and be able to say that the largest goal we accomplished in the academic arena is one that both energized the students and faculty and met a very real edu­cational need," she said. 
As Fleming works to get acquainted with the College com­munity, she said she strives to discover the best academic goals for the students and faculty. 
"I really look forward to the complexity of Saint Mary's College," she said, such as the ability "to work more closely with faculty and staff from such wide­ranging areas as nursing, educa­tion, business, science, humani­ties, social science and profes­sional education." 
Although Fleming acknowl­edged that it's impossible to think the administration will always agree on difficult College issues, she believes the deep respect they show towards each other will allow them to accomplish their goals. 
Fleming also said she is "partic­ularly excited" about working with College President Carol Ann Mooney -someone whose "love of the College and fierce determi­nation to send it to new heights comes through so clearly," she said. 
Fleming will also work closely with Associate Deans Deborah McCarthy and Joe Incandela, who will work in these positions for three more years. 
Incandela and McCarthy both said that they have not had the opportunity to work closely with her, but look forward to the start ofher administrative term. 
An objective Fleming said she shares with College administra­tion is making Saint Mary's one of the nation's top bachelor degree awarding institutions -a posi­tion that would require the school to reassess its demographics, she said. 
And to better comprehend the needs for a new demographic, Fleming said she would work to become involved with student life. 
"Our world is rapidly changing, and the demographics for 10-to­30 years out suggests that our everyday encounters will be with even more diverse people than and staff would even venture up to the bench to chat." 


As Fleming begins her adminis­trative quest at the College she asked that the students find her a bench, where she "promises to sit as often as possible."

IN BRIEF 
Wall Street fluctuates, finishes low 
NEW YORK-Wall Street seesawed through an erratic session Monday, trying to stabilize but ultimately finishing near its lows of the day amid worries about mortgage defaults, a strengthening yen and tumbling stock markets abroad. 
The major indexes fluctuated throughout the session, with the Dow Jones industrials bob­bing between positive and negative territory as investors tried to size up where the market was headed after last week's big decline. The Dow finished 63 points lower, having fallen in eight of the last nine sessions. 
The market remained jittery about losses over soured subprime loans, or loans to cus­tomers with poor credit ratings. HSBC Holdings PLC, Europe's largest bank, said its 2006 earnings rose 5 percent but that it suf­fered $10.6 billion in losses on bad loans from its U.S. subprime mortgage operations. 

Wal-Mart fires systems technician 
-NEW YORK -Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said Monday it fired a systems technician who allegedly recorded phone conversations between the company's public relations office and a newspaper reporter. The case is now being investigated by federal authorities. 
Wal-Mart said the technician, whom it did not identify, also intercepted text messages using his own personal equipment. The retail­er said he was acting alone, _but declined to say what his motive may have been. 
Wal-Mart said its internal investigation began on Jan. 11 after an unidentified party alerted the company. That led to the discovery that the technician had monitored and record­ed phone conversations between Wal-Mart's public relations staffers and a New York Times reporter between September 2006 and January 2007. Wal-Mart said it notified The New York Times earlier Monday. 
A New York Times spokeswoman, Diane McNulty, identified the reporter as retail writer Michael Barbaro. She said the newspa­per does not plan "to take any legal action at this time." · 
During the investigation, Wal-Mart said it discovered that, in separate instances, the same technician had intercepted text and pager messages, including communications that did not involve Wal-Mart employees.

World markets continue to fall 
European, Asian and U.S. markets plunge, investors fear 'global slowdown' 
Associated Press 

LONDON -European and Asian markets fell again Monday, extending their slide into a second week as investors worried about a possible global slowdown and dumped stocks that had surged in recent weeks. U.S. stocks fell after trying to steady themselves.

"The fact that the FTSE closed Friday's session vir­tually unchanged may have left some thinking that the recent slide in equity mar­kets may be at an end, but triple-digit losses on the Dow ahead of the weekend break have taken their toll on Asian markets," said Matt Buckland, a trader ai CMC Markets. 
Also sparking jitters was the yen's jump to a three­month high against the dol­lar as investors reversed so-called yen-carry trades.

Rediscovering Eucharistic Adoration 
Let's look at a new phenomenon you may know very littlo about. It is the rmnarkable rise of Eucharistic Adoration in Catholic parishes and iustitutions in every part of the world. Why is it happening? And what is it? 
"The Catholic Church," says the Catechism, "offers to the ... Eucharist ... adoration, not only during Mass, but also outside of it, reserving the consecrated hosts ... exposing them to the solemn venoration of the faithful, and carrying them in pro­cession" {No. B7S). 
But why do we do this'? "In the ... Eucharist, tho body and blood, ... soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ and, therefore, tlw whole Christ is truly, really and substantially contained. This prosence is callod rnal, by which is not intended to exdude the other types of presence ... but because it is presence in the fullest sense ... it is substantial prnsence by which Christ, God and man, makes himsolf wholly and entirely prnsent" (Catechism. no. 1374). 
This conversion of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, promised in the sixth chapter of John's gospel and fulfilled at the Last Suppor, is called transubstantiation. 
"Substance," as Cardinal Avery Dulles put it, "denotes the basic reality of the thing, i.e., what it is in itself." A change in appearance does not afl'ect the sub­stance of the thing. When the angel Haphael stood before Tobiah, his appearance was that of a "young man," but his substance was that of an angel (Tobit, 5:5, 12:15). 
"Christ is present," wrote Cardinal Dulles, "by his dynamic power and action in all the sacraments, but in the Eucharist, His presence is, in addition, substantial. For this reason, the 

EDITORIAL CARTOON 
Eucharist may be adornd. It is tho greatest of all sacraments" .(Feb. 15, 2005). 
You arn in the rnal prnsencn of Christ every time you step into a Catholic church with the lighted lamp or candlo indicating that tho Blessed Sacrament is in the tabernade. At any such timn one can he with Christ in adoration. The term Eucharistic Adoration, how­ever, is usually appli1~d to the Exposition of tho S;u:ramnnt to view. Christ is as fully presnnt in the dosed tabernacle as he is in the monstrance during Exposition. It is conducive to devotion for us to bn able also to look upon him in thn host in which "tlw wholn Christ is truly, roally and sub­stantially eontained." 
"Thn central problom of the Chun:h today," wroto Boston College professor l'etnr Krneft, "is that most of thn gener­ation now becoming adults ... are not mnrnly unawarn of right doctrino ... but of Christ llimsnlf. If is rnal presencn. Nothing less than Christ eould have christianiznd tho world, nothing lnss than Christlessness has do-christianiznd it, and nothing lnss than Christ can rn­christianizn it" (Crisis, March 19SS). 
So what can we do about it'? We have Eurharistic Adoration in the Basilica on Friday from noon to 5 p.m., with Benediction at 4:45 p.m., and in tlw Coleman-Morso chapel Monday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., with Benedidion daily at S:45 p.m. 
When Pope John Paul II instituted Eucharistic Adoration at St. Peter's Basilica in 19S1, hn said, "The best ... way ol' establishing nverlasting peace on thn face of the earth is through ... Pnrpntual Adoration ol' the Blessed Sacrament." Why is this so? "Above all," said Pope Benedict XVI, "Abovo all, thn Eucharist is thn great school of love. When we participato regularly and with devotion in Holy Mass, when we spend a sustained time of adoration in thn presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, it is easier to understand the length, breadth, height and depth of his love that goes beyond all knowledge" (cf'. Eph. 3:17-lS). In his message in 2005 for the National Day ol' Young Catholics of the Netherlands, Berwdict XVI exhortHd them to "go to the encounter with him in the Blessed Eucharist, go to adore him in the churches, kneeling bel'oro the tabernacle: Jesus will fill you with his lovo and will reveal to you the thoughts of his Heart. If you listen to him, you will feel ever more deeply tho joy of bnlonging to his Mystical Body, the Church, which is the family of his disciplos held close by the bond of unity and love." 
Benedict XVI has insisted on this point: "Eucharistic Adoration is an essential way of being with the Lord ... In thn Sacred Host, lle is present, the true treasure, always waiting for us. Only by adoring in this presence do we learn how to receive him properly .... Let us love being with the Lord! There we can speak with Him about every­thing. We can offer I lim our petitions, our concerns, our troubles, our joys. Our gratitude, our disappointments, our needs and our aspirations... " (Sept. 11, 2006). 
What can we at Notre Damn do to fix a world in cultural meltdown'? The greatest event in the history of the world is tho Incarnation, when God beeame man. It's just possible that Christ, tho God who bPeame man for us, ean give us some answers. Why don't you go ask him? Maybe you don't feel like it. Then pray for the desire to see him. Maybe you have too much to do. As Peter Kreeft put it, "That's why you can't afford not to give God five loaves and two fishes of your time so that he can multiply it." In short, we need to go meet with the Boss.

'Oregon Trail' highly offensive 
For those of you who didn't make it out to see St. Edward's Hall Players' comedy, "The Oregon Trail," I applaud and envy you. For those who did, I am sure that you will agree with me that the play was offensive on many grounds, and the only "humor" garnered by the cast was through making crude and insensitive jokes. 
I can recall a particular scene in which a stem cell was used to revitalize two oxen to help carry the family wagon to Oregon. The Catholic Church teaches that it is wrong to use embryonic stem cells for medical purposes, as adult stem cells are just as useful in the medical world and human life does not have to be wasted in order to obtain them. Also, the mode by which the stem cell "revitalized" the oxen was through blatantly sexual and perverted acts. 
In another scene, Native Americans were brutally shot down. Amid the audience's laughs during these scenes (and many others), I had to wonder: How is this funny? These things really did happen to real Native Americans who were murdered or forced from their land by the "white man." 
Our culture today is too desensitized to sex, violence and murder, and this play was exemplary of our moral decay as a society. At a Catholic university like Notre Dame I don't see how a production like this could be allowed, and I would hope that in the future similar productions will not be shown on campus.

Young people need to take risks in life 
A small conversation with a student led me to find out that one of the greatest regrets of older people is not taking risks during their life. Whether these risks were related to careers or relationships, what people had the opportunity to do but did not do bothered them the most. Think of the most successful and Gina content people you know of. Hosterman Chances are they took several risks in their past to get to where The Poly Post they are today. Just as easily as we can recall success stories, we can recall many people who have suffered because a lost opportuni­ty. 
We ourselves have experienced this type of regret. Think back to a time when it was in your power to do something you would have liked to have done, but decided not to take action and an opportunity was lost. Perhaps you wished you had tried out for a sport in high school but talked your­self out of it because you hadn't made it the year before, or maybe you could have applied for a job you really wanted but felt your skills were not ade­quate. Maybe it is as simple as wishing you had told that person how you felt but instead remained silent. It may not be possible to change the past, but making a conscious decision to not make the same mistakes in the future is the first step in leading a life that you will look back on with satisfaction. 
So what are some practical ways you can take risks in your everyday life? Say hi to that attractive person in class. Initiate conversations with random people you meet because you never know where it will lead. Everyone has something to teach you if you are open to learning. And it works the other way too. You have experiences that can help others if you are willing to share. Give someone a daringly honest compliment. Chances are they will remem­ber you in a very positive way. Raise your hand in class. You have valuable insights to share. Remember that those who speak up are the most influential. 
If you're a little intimidated, start with small steps. Venture to speak up just once in each class or in every other class. When you see a job or vol­unteer opportunity posted and it interests you, make a conscious decision to follow up with it. Contact the person in charge and ask how best to get involved or apply for the position. Ask other students what their favorite class was and sign up for it. 
Be looking for opportunities at all times and don't be quick to turn down invitations that at first seem to hold little or no immediate benefit. Not every­thing will be what you expect, but you will certainly have some surprises, and you will find that the ben­efits far outweigh the risks involved in risk-taking.

whole 'Generation Me' thing. We weren't spe­cial enough." There is no doubt my friend is a special guy. While his observa­tion might be a bit oversimplified, it is a good one. 
According to NBC.com, five psycholo­gists recently conducted a study on col­lege students across the country and found that students today are more nar­cissistic and self-centered than our pred­ecessors. 
The study, lead by San Diego State University professor Jean Twenge, asked for responses to prompts such as, "If I ruled the world, it would be a better place," "I think I am a special person" and "I can live my life any way I want to." The number of people who agreed with these statements rose from previous studies. The study makes clear that stu­dents today believe they're each special in their own little way. Actually, no. 
People of our generation don't like to do anything for anyone else, unless they can see a clear and present benefit to themselves. 
We want to be the center of attention; we want to make a lot of money, have a lot of nice things and have fame and power wherever we go, at least accord­ing to this study. 
And why shouldn't we? Our preschool teachers began drilling our "specialness" into our brains at age five; it's no wonder we have to deal with the consequences now. Everyone was an artist and an ath­lete; you got a gold star for smiling on cue and a ribbon for showing up. As time went on, the competitions started -and there were no losers. All the teachers made a calendar with everyone's birth­day and on each special day, that student got a cupcake. We were all equal. 
Today, most college students have a Facebook or MySpace account-or both -to celebrate their own uniqueness and contribution to the world. People upload hair cuts, dumb dog antics and their music videos to YouTube to gain fame. Those sites are all about us and sharing ourselves with everyone else. Wherever we go, we're plugged into our own music, so we never have to listen to something so demeaning as the radio. Our choices are best. 
The study may be a bit harsh, but the ultimate conclusion is right on target. At the risk of making an over-broad state­ment, all members of our generation believe they are the ultimate member of the generation. They don't see the rest or see their responsibilities to the world. It's all about them. 
As for my friend, I'll make him a cup­cake. If I ever get around to it.

Spring break travel itinerary includes the couch 
With only a few midterms and papers standing in the way of a week of nothing­ness, I figured it would be about time to plan my spring break. After booking a trip to the Bahamas, I was shocked to hear that United Airlines doesn't accept Flex points. Nor could I make a charge to my student account. Once I realized this, spring break was on me. 
I decided it might be in my best interest to suck it up, swallow my pride and endure all my friends' awe­some stories about their 18-roorn villa in the south of France, and just go horne. However, I've concoct­ed a loose itinerary of my spring break that I think will appeal to those of us who aren't jet setting around the globe. 
Days 1-3: Operation Sleep Coma 
After ingesting a copious amount of my morn's homemade meatloaf and mashed potatoes, I plan on duct-taping blackout sheets over my windows and slipping into a three-day state of hibernation that will rival even the deepest of post-TC inspired sleeps. 
Supplies needed: Meatloaf, duct tape, blackout sheets (Please, no one get the wrong idea.) 
Days 4-5: Redefine Couch Potato 
I recently learned something about par-ents. When we children move out of the house, other interests-namely personal happiness and material possessions ­replace the time and energy spent on us. A new pet replaced my sister (at least this is living and breathing) and, unsurpris­ingly, a new television replaced me. I would like to think this is because I may share some positive characteristics with the television, in that it is entertaining and informative. Unfortunately, it's more likely I share the characteristics of taking up space and being expensive. Whatever. 


Despite this, the new TV plays directly into my plan to spend the entirety of these days on the couch, watching bas­ketball and taking advantage of Sam's Club's 2-for-1 sale of cheese pull's. I really can't wait to slip into an orange finger­stained state of bliss. However, I can't decide what is a more effective way of calling for new refreshments from my parents-a buzzer or a whistle, and I would like to use this opportunity to con­duct an informal pull on the position. Feel free to send me an e-mail with your choice. 
Supplies needed: Couch, television, remote with fresh batteries, whistle/buzzer 
Days 6-7: Operation Parental Mooching 
I know, I know. This sounds awful. I'm a bad person, right? Well, to quote my good friend God, "Let he who has not sinned cast the first stone." These last two days will involve some serious mooching efforts, for what I like to call the "Big Three Cs"-cash, cookies and card upgrades. I want Domer Dollars like you don't even know. Errands will be run. Foot-rubs will be given. Cars will be washed. Hopefully, with the right combi­nation of incessant hints (i.e. "I would love to help the needy ... but it's just so gosh darn expensive and I really can't afl'ord it right now") and carefully placed mooching tasks (i.e. "Don't worry about it Mom, I'll make dinner. You just rest.") I hope to leave home a richer man. 

So those are my spring break plans. They may not be a trip to Cancun com­plete with a torrid love affair with Hamon, the saucy pool boy, but it's all I could muster up. 
So while you chumps are sweating it out in some shady dub or removing the pounds of beach sand from your shorts, I'll be taking it easy on the couch, which is just fmc by me. I guess.

DVD REVIEW 

'Platoon' reloads with 20th anniversary DVD 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 
Two decades ago, Oliver Stone was the toast of Hollywood. The "Scarface" and "Midnight Express" screenwriter's direc­torial breakthrough, "Platoon" was a smash hit, winning the Best Picture Oscar and awarding the filmmaker the Best Director Statuette. 
But Stone would never equal the raw power of that early masterpiece, and it's not hard to see why. "Platoon" crackles with passion and purpose fueled by its semi-autobiographical perspective, which examines war from the point of view of one of its lowest soldiers. 
Written and directed by Stone, who was a soldier in Vietnam, "Platoon" follows Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), who drops out of college to join the war effort in 1968. Under the watchful eyes of two commanding officers, Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe), Taylor slowly becomes disillusioned with the war and witnesses it devolve into chaotic fighting. 
At the time, "Platoon" was evolutionary because it offered a different perspective than its contemporaries. Unlike "Apocalypse Now" or "The Deer Hunter," which were epic and allegorical in nature, "Platoon" is immersed in minutiae, with its mostly realistic portrayals of the nature of individuals in war. Although it ultimate­ly goes over the top with some of Stone's patented spectacle, the first three-quar­ters of "Platoon" are among the finest depictions of war ever committed to film. 

Barnes and Elias form the crux of the film's conflict, as the two have differing opinions on how to approach the war. Initially enamored with Barnes, Taylor begins to realize the futility of his rage and eventually sides with Elias, whose genuine afl'ection for his troops is one of the few reprieves from misery in the jun­gle. The performances of Berenger and (especially) Dafoe guide the film, though Sheen is undoubtedly the weakest link. 
"Platoon" already had a special edition, but that never stopped a studio from going back to the well. The new two-disc 20th Anniversary Edition comes in beau­tiful packaging that features some essays and photos from the film. The image quality is sharp and clear, with several 
noticeable improve­ments over the last edition. The sound has been augmented with a DTS track in addition to the stan­dard 5.1 Dolby Digital. The DTS track is deep and irnrnersive, which is a major improvement over the sometimes­thin Dolby Digital track on the special edition release. 


The special features include a commen­tary from Stone and a separate eommen­tary from Dale Dye, who was the military consultant on "Saving Private Hyan" as well as "Platoon." Both of these commen­taries are ports from the Special Edition, though they are also both insightful and interesting. 
The second disc retains "Tour of the Inferno," an insightful 52-minute docu­mentary, from the original release and also adds several new featurettes and doc­umentaries, many of which give real-life context to the film, framing it in terms of the situations in both America and Vietnam in 1968. 
In the wake of films like "Saving Private Hyan" and "Letters from lwo Jima," "Platoon" already feels a bit antiquated, but its immersive quality is undeniable. Of all the films in Stone's rich oeuvre, this is among his finest and certainly his most personal. The third time seems to be the charm for MGM and makes the 20th Anniversary Edition of "Platoon" the definitive take on a classic war film.

Turkoglu's 25 points lead Magic over Bucks 
James has double-double as Cleveland defeats Houston in Yao's return; Miami climbs above .500for first time in months 
Associated Press 
ORLANDO, Fla. -It was about this time last season that Hedo Turkoglu heated up. lie may be doing it again for the Orlando Magic. 
Turkoglu hit 10 of 14 shots from the field, including three 3-pointers, and scored a sea­son-high 25 points to push the Orlando Magic to an easy 99-81 victory over Milwaukee. 
Turkoglu, who has struggled with his shooting all season, hit­ting only 41 percent from the field, is 29-for-41 (70. 7 percent) in his last four games. He is averaging 22 points over that span after averaging 11.8 points. 
"I knew my shot was eventu­ally going to come around," Turkoglu said. "It's just a mat­ter of confidence and getting the shot to fall. I might have relied too much on the jump shot, but I've been mixing up the drives with jumpers, and now it seems to be clicking." 
Turkoglu's backup, Trevor Ariza, was almost as good, scor­ing 20 points and grabbing six rebounds in 31 minutes. In fact, Ariza was playing so well that Turkoglu didn't get off the bench in the final 16 minutes. That prevented Turkoglu, who had a season-high nine rebounds, from getting his first double-double of the season. 
"I wish I had known that because it would have been nice to get a double-double," Turkoglu said. "But really, stats aren't important at this point in the season. We have to reach our goal of making the playofl's and I want to do what I can to help us get there." 

The Magic currently hold the eighth spot in tho East. barely ahead of New Jersey and Nnw York. 
Michael Hedd led Milwaukee with 15 points, but hit only three of 16 shots from the lield. This came one day after Redd scored 52 points on 18-of-:~2 shooting in an overtime loss to Chicago. Hedd, who made night 3-point attempts against the Bulls, was 0-for-:~ from behind the arc against Orlando. 
"We were a little spent emo­tionally and physically arter the overtime loss," Milwaukee coach Terry Stotts said. "Michael (Hedd) had some good looks early and his threes were open, but we dug ourselves a hole early and couldn't get out of it." 
Dwight lloward had 10 points and nine rebounds for the Magie, who ended a three-game losing streak. Orlando had 24 fast-break points to just five ror Milwaukee. 
The Bucks started slowly and were never really in the game. They were stone euld from the opening tip, hitting only two of their first 10 shots while turn­ing the ball over six timos. Milwaukee finished the half shooting 32.4 percent with 10 turnovers. 
The Magie, meanwhile, shot 50 percent in the first half and led by as many as 20 points before settling for a 49-34 half­time advantage. Turkoglu had 15 points on 6-for-9 shooting

and added eight rebounds. 
The Magic scored nine straight points to start tho sec­ond half to boost the lead to 24. Turkoglu had seven of those points, ineluding the 3-pointer that made it 58-34 with 9:42 left in the period. 
The Bucks never got closer than 16 points from there. 
Huben Patterson scored 14 points, while Charlie Villaneuva and Lynn Greer had 11 eaeh for Mila waukee. 
Cleveland 91, Houston 85 
LeBron James seored 32 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers held ofT the Houston Rockets on Monday night to spoil Yao Ming's first game baek from a leg injury.

Yao returned to ac:tion after missing :~2 gamos while reeov­ering from a broken bono undor his right knee. llo finished with 16 points, 11 rebounds, two bloeks and live turnovors.

Wearing a blaek bnu:e on his right knee, Yao looked slow and out of syneh on oiTonsn, lntting a crisp pass tip off his hands and missing open shots. 
But Yao, who played 27 min­utes, helped spark the Rockets in the fourth quarter after they trailed by 14. lie scored seven straight points and provided a presenee inside that forced Cleveland to take outside shots. 
The Hoekets, who have lost four of five, pulled to within 84­82 on Traey McGrady's jumper with 1:34 left. But Zydrunas Ilgauskas put back James' missed jumper on the next pos­session to protect the lead.

Hughes scored 22 points with seven assists and six rebounds. llgauskas had just eight points but added three blocks, two steals and made things difficult for Yao. 
James opened up a 43-33 lead on a three-point play just before halftime. McGrady shot 2-for-13 and Yao 1-for-9 in the first half. 
Miami 88, Atlanta 81 
The Miami Heat got above .500 for the first time in nearly four months by beating the Atlanta Hawks Monday night. 
Eddie Jones had 14 of his sea­son-high 21 points in the final quarter and Shaquille O'Neal added 14 points and nine rebounds on the eve of his 35th birthday. 
Jones hit a 3-pointer to start a game-deciding 13-2 run over a 5-minute stretch of the fourth quarter by the Heat (30-29). The defending NBA champions last had a winning record on Nov. 10: 3-2. 
Gary Payton had 11 points and seven rebounds and James Posey added 10 points for Miami, which got promising news earlier in the day from star guard Dwyane Wade. Wade announced he will not have immediate surgery to repair his dislocated left shoulder and will attempt to return by the end of the season. 
Josh Smith and Anthony Johnson each had 16 points, Josh Childress had 14 and Joe Johnson had 12 -13.3 below his average -for Atlanta, which dropped its sixth straight.

Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. ­Sacramento Kings forward Ron Artest was arrested Monday after a woman called 911 from his home saying she had been assaulted. 
Placer County sheriff's deputies responded about 
9:30 a.m. to Artest's five-acre estate in the Sacramento sub­urb of Loomis, where they found a woman who had suf­fered injuries, officials said. She declined medical atten­tion. 
Deputies arrested Artest on suspicion of domestic violence and using force or violence to prevent the woman from reporting a crime, sheriff's spokeswoman Dena Erwin said. 

"lie and the female were in the house and separated," Erwin said. "The deputies interviewed them and took Mr. Artest into custody." 
Artest was booked into the Placer County Jail and released later on $50,000 bail. 
Erwin said she could not disclose the woman's injuries or characterize her relation­ship with the player. She said Artest was cooperative when deputies arrived at his home. 
The Kings did not respond 
· to a telephone message left by The Associated Press. But spokesman Troy Hanson told The Sacramento Bee, "We are aware of the situation and are in the process of gathering information." 
Artest has had previous run-ins with police. 
He was at the center of the infamous brawl on Nov. 19, 2004, between Indiana Pacers players and Pistons fans at The Palace in Detroit. Just when a confrontation between players seemed to be over, Artest, lying on the scor­er's table, was hit with a cup filled with an icy beverage. He bolted into the stands in a rage, followed by fist-swinging teammate Stephen Jackson. Artest and teammate Jermaine O'Neal later slugged fans on the court. 
Two days later, Artest was suspended for the rest of the season -73 games, plus the playoffS -in a move that cost him almost $5 million. 
Artest and Jackson were sentenced to one year of pro­bation and 60 hours of com­munity service after pleading no contest to misdemeanor assault charges. In January, Artest was released from that probation. 
Artest also has had trouble with local authorities. 
Last month, county animal control officers seized Artest's Great Dane, Socks, from his home about 25 miles north­east of Sacramento. They said the animal wasn't being fed. 
County records showed the NBA star had paid nearly $2,000 in boarding and impound fees for his dogs, which had spent 77 ' nights at the pound since July. 
IN BRIEF 
Eleven plead not guilty after 
steroid raid of pharmacy 
ALBANY, N.Y. -Eleven people con­nected to a Florida pharmacy at the center of a nationwide investigation into the illegal sale of steroids pleaded not guilty Monday, a growing case that has linked the online drug network to doctors and health care centers in at least tlrree states. 
Robert Stanley Loomis and wife Naomi, the owners of Signature Pharmacy in Orlando, Fla., were arrested last Tuesday during a raid in which police confiscated truck loads of drugs and other evidence. Both are registered pharmacists in Florida. Robert Loomis' brother, pharmacist Kenneth Michael Loomis, and Kirk Calvert, Signature's marketing director, also were charged. 
The four are charged with 20 counts each of criminal diversion of prescrip­tion medications and prescriptions, criminal sale of a controlled substance and insurance fraud. 

Beckham to be sidelined a 
month for knee injury 
MADRID, Spain -David Beckham's return to form has taken a new twist-a bad twist of his right knee. 
The Los Angeles Galaxy-bound midfield­er will be sidelined for about a month after hurting a knee ligament during a Spanish League game last weekend, an injury that eliminated his chance of being recalled to England's national team for upcoming European Championship quali­fiers. 
The 31-year-old hurt his right knee dur­ing Real Madrid's 1-1 tie with Getafe on Sunday when his momentum following a cross took him into an advertising sign behind the goal. He limped off the field, and a scan Monday revealed the injured ligament. 
"Obviously, we hope it's not a serious injury so he can get back to helping Real Madrid challenge for the title," Galaxy general manager Alexi Lalas said. 'We do not expect this injury to affect his arrival in Los Angeles or his debut with the Galaxy."' 
Henry signs with Denver 
aftercutbyTenn~ 
DENVER, Co. -It took Travis Henry only two days to get a job -with a team that turns running backs into star. 
The former Titan and Bill, cut by Tennessee on Saturday, agreed to terms with Denver, which has made one-year wonders of Olandis Gary, Mike Anderson, Reuben Droughns and others, largely because of its schemes. 
Henry is more than that, having rushed for 1,211 yards and a 4.5 aver­age last season for the Titans, who released him after he and the team could not agree on restructuring a contract that called for an $8.3 million bonus. He is getting $12 million in guaranteed bonuses from the Broncos. 
The Broncos did not announce the signing, which was disclosed by some­one familiar with the deal who requested anonymity because it had not yet been signed.

has decided to delay surgery and  Pat Riley Heat coach  of next season. The Heat would  

rehabilitate his shoulder with the goal of returning to help the Miami Heat defend their league title. 
"It could have been easy for me just to shut it down," Wade said at a news conference. "You don't know if you're going to be able to attack the same way and dive on the floor the same way. I'll find out after therapy and rehab how my body responds to things." 
Wade's decision was good news for the injury-plagued Heat, who entered Monday night's game against Atlanta at 29-29. But even with rest and therapy, there's no guarantee Wade can return this season. 
"The fact there's a possibility would give us hope," coach Pat Riley said. "He's a pretty good player. He probably would be a pretty good player one­armed." 
The Heat went into Monday's game 4-8 this season without Wade, but 3-2 since he was hurt Feb. 21 in a collision with Houston's Shane Battier. At the time, he was the league's third-leading scorer, averaging 
28.8 points. 
Wade underwent extensive tests and received a second opinion from specialist Dr. James Andrews before decid­ing he would try to return. 
Wade disclosed Monday that his injury included a torn labrum. He was without a sling at the news conference but still wears one when he sleeps to keep the shoulder stable. 
The decision to attempt a comeback this season was dif­ficult, Wade said, even though Andrews and team physician Dr. Harlan Selesnick supported the idea. Wade said he was told he can't further damage his shoulder by playing, although another dislocation is possible. 
"The main thing I can do is feel that same pain again. That's one thing I don't want to feel," he said with a smile. 
Wade said he has received encouragement from team­mate Eddie Jones, who missed 15 games with a dislocated left shoulder and torn labrum in March 2001. Jones returned late in the regular season and played in three playoff games before undergoing offseason surgery. 
Jones talked to Wade last week about what to expect during the rehab process. 
"You're going to get a work­out, a big-time workout," Jones said. "There's going to be days when you don't want to do it. But you've got to stay on top of it. ... I think he can get through it. He's a tough guy."

Classic concludes with tense playoff 
Wilson wins the four-way extended overtime 
Associated Press 
PALM BEACH GAHDENS, Fla. -Mark Wilson was a math major at North Carolina and confesses that one of his favorite things is crossing off items on his to-do lists. 
He can now erase the top entry on that sheet of goals. 
Wilson made a birdie to beat Jose Caceres on the third play­off hole and win the Honda Classic at PGA National on Monday, the 32-year-old play­er's first PGA Tour victory in 111 career tries. He won a four-man playoff that began Sunday, was interrupted by darkness, then ended when he hit from 10 feet on the par-3 17th hole. 
"I didn't sleep very good last night at all just because I real­ly wanted to finish it off here and win," he said. 
He got into the playoff with some big putts Sunday: par from 45 feet on the 16th hole, par from 8 feet on the final regulation hole, then a 3D­footer -in near-dark condi­tions, r.emember -on the playoff first hole. 
Some of his competitors acknowledged buckling under pressure. 
Wilson seemed cool the whole way. 
"Maybe in these moments, I'm nervo].ls," said Caceres, who also lost a playoff to Fred Funk last week at the tour's stop in Mexico. "Mr. Wilson, he played very good." 
With the win, Wilson got a $990,000 winner's check, an exemption through the 2009 season and a reprieve from making an 11th consecutive trip to the tour's qualifying school. He also vaulted 179 spots to No. 86 in the world rankings. And, if he can stay in the top 10 on the money list, he has a chance at playing the Masters for the first time. 
His ca~die, Chris Jones, got two things: a nice cut of Wilson's earnings, and a huge

sense of relief. 
Wilson, Caceres, Boo 

Weekley -who missed a 3­
foot par putt Sunday on the 
18th hole that would have 
given him his first career win 
-and Camilo Villegas all fin­
ished the 72 regulation holes 
at 5-under 275. But Wilson's­
score included a two-stroke . penalty from his round of 66 
on Friday, after Jones made a 
major goof. ­
On the fifth tee Friday, Jones 

overheard Villegas and his 
caddie talking about club 
selection at that par-3 hole. 
Jones blurted out, "It's an 18­
degree," referring to the 
hybrid club that Wilson carries 
in his bag. 
Offering advice to competi­

tors like that is against the 
rules, and Wilson knew it. So 
he summoned a rules official 
at the next hole and docked 
himself two shots. 
"I felt like I almost cost us 

this tournament Friday," said 
Jones, who cried after Friday's 
round and was fighting tears 
after Wilson got the win 
Monday. "But he hung in there 
and knew I didn't mean to do 
it. It was just a mental error. 
... A lot of guys wouldn't have 
even called it on themselves." 
If that's true, Wilson isn't 

one of them. The rule was one 
of the first things he discussed 
with Jones when he hired him 
to carry the bag. 
"Part of me thought he was 

just upset with me for even 
making a big deal about it," 
Wilson said. "But then I finally 
just put my arm around him 
and said, 'Hey, let's go; let's go 
play golf.' Camilo was a gen­
tleman. He did the same thing. 
... From there on, I just played 
some of the best golf of my 
life.'' 
On the second playoff hole 

-the first one played Monday 
-Wilson used that 18-degree 
hybrid to set up a putt that 
nearly ended the tournament. 
A 224-yard approach put him 
in birdie range at the par-4 
10th, but he settled for par. 
Weekley and Villegas 

weren't so lucky. 
Weekley's drive landed in 

the left rough, buried so 
deeply he had no chance of 
reaching the green. He 
chopped the ball out, advanc­
ing it about 100 yards. His 
third shot hit 8 feet from the 
pin but spun backward, and 
his par try slipped past. 
He walked to the front of the 

green, hands on hips, head 
bent, knowing his chance was 
gone. 
"It's a learning experience. 

I'm disappointed in myself 
after yesterday, but that's golf, 
man," Weekley said. "That just 
happens.... Just a part of it." 
Villegas missed the 1Oth 

green to the left, but hit a 
great flop shot to within 4 feet. 
His par attempt, though, 
ducked beneath the hole, end­
ing his day. 
"I was feeling good over it. 

... I wasn't shaking as much as 
I thought," Villegas said. 
Caceres made his par putt. 

and he and Wilson headed to 
the par-3 17th, where each hit 
tee balls to about 10 feet. 
Wilson putted first, made his, 
and Caceres couldn't answer.

Colts ~e-sign free agent linebacker 
Morris returns after aiding in Super Bowl win 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS Th1~ 

Indianapolis Colts will have one 
of their free agents back to 
defend the Super Bowl next sea­
son after ro-signing veteran line­
backer Hob Morris on Monday. 
Team president Bill Polian said keeping Morris was one of the team's top priorities and that he expects the converted middlo ·linebacker to continue to start on tho strong side, where ho exeOIIed in the playofl's. Terms of' tho contract wore not immedi­
atoiy disclosed. 
"It's in line with our philoso­phy that you re-sign your own." Polian told The Associatnd Press 

.late Monday. "We felt Hob played awfully well for us down the stretch and it gives us some security knowing we've got a starting linebacker." 
A message was left on the voice mail of Morris' agent, Ethan Lock. 
Morris was expected to anchor the defense when Indianapolis selected him with the 28th over­ill! pick in the 2000 draft.

But his development as a rookie was stunted by a lengthy contract holdout. and his season ended after just seven games when he was carted off the field after rupturing the quadriceps in his right leg. 

Insight comes from 
Over the next four years, Morris piled up the tackles but eventually lost his starting job to undrafted free agent Gary

Brackett in 2004. He had re­signed with the Colts long after he became a free agent each of the last two years. 
It wasn't until his emergence late last season, at outside line­backer, that Morris finally gained the respect of those out­side the Colts organization. When he replaced Gilbert Gardner as the starter in December -the only lineup change coach Tony Dungy made -the Colts run defense went from the league's worst during the regular season to one of the best in the playoffs. 
Morris' ability. to adapt to a position he had never before played, and his performance in the playoffs, made him a more valuable part of the Colts' hopes to repeat as world champions. 
"He made it clear he wanted to come back and we wanted him back," Pollan said. "For us the issue was that we have a guy we really covet and he wanted to be a part of it." 
It's the first major signing the Colts have made since beating Chicago 29-17 in the Super Bowl although they have tendered all of their restricted free agents, which include starting guards Ryan Lilja and Jake Scott.

year," McGraw said. "At this time I think we [had] 18 wins. I think we played a little bit better [than last year!." 
The Irish are 2-3 against ranked opponents this season. They did a great job of win­ning at home -a facet stressed repeatedly by McGraw -going 14-2 in the Joyce Center. On the road, however, they struggled with a record of 5-8. 
Notre Dame has had its ups and downs. The Irish lost three straight road games in January, only to come back and win their next six straight. That stretch included a 64-55 defeat of No. 17 Louisville and ended on a high note as they defeated Georgetown 73-48. 
"That stretch in February I thought we played really well," McGraw said. "So I feel good about our chances." 
After that, the team some­how lost momentum, as well as its final three games of the season. 
The Irish are likely compet­ing for one of the final spots in the field with DePaul, Hofstra, Seton Hall, Western Kentucky and Auburn. DePaul, having defeated Notre Dame twice in three games and with a chance to continue to prove its worth in the Big East tour­nament, would most likely get the bid over the Irish. Notre Dame defeated Seton Hall 64­61 on Jan. 2, giving the Irish a leg up on the Pirates. 
Hofstra is 23-6 and 13-5 in the Colonial Athletic Association. With a quality win over Michigan State early in the season and a seven­game winning streak to close out the year, the Pride are in a good position to get an at­large bid. 
Western Kentucky, playing in the Sun Belt Conference, does not get the chance to gain quality wins often. It fin­ished with a record of 20-8 and 14-3 in regular season play, good for second in the East division of the confer­ence. The end of the Big Red's season, however. was not spectacular. They lost two of their last three games. 
Auburn is least likely to bump the Irish out of their spot. The Tigers arc 17-14 and just 7-9 in SEC play. They also failed to defeat any ranked teams during the sea­son. 
Even with the rocky end to the season, Notre Dame has a fairly strong resume and a good chance at a spot in the Tournament, which begins March 1 7. And if the Irish are granted a bid, they will have the chance to forget the last three games and start their season anew.

23.6 points and 12.8 rebounds, both team highs, his senior year. 
But aside from his high school experience, Ilarangody is quick to note that the variety of post moves he brought to Notre Dame actually eame from his AAU days with the SYF Players. Now, near the end of the season. he has improved those and added some new ones. 
"My AAU coach taught me a lot and the eoaehing starr here has taught me as well," llarangody said. "It's a combi­nation of both."

Big East beckoning 
Harangody's post play frustrates opponents, key for ND success 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 
Six months ago, Notre Dame's inside game was considered its weakness and forward Luke Harangody was a freshman adapting to college workouts. 
Now, after a season of basket­ball, the Irish are 23-6 and Harangody has become one of the most feared and effective inside players in the Big East. 
The 6-foot-8, 250-pound freshman is averaging 11.3 points and 5.3 rebounds per game this season, including a 22-point outburst in Notre Dame's win over Marquette Feb. 24. 
Harangody, who also pulled down 13 rebounds against the Golden Eagles, frustrated Marquette's defense with his physical style that wore down opposing defenders.

Irish guards Russell Carter and Colin Falls were named to the all­Big East first team Monday, mark­ing the only time in school history two Notre Dame players made the first team in the same season. 
''I'm just happy for two seniors who have paid their dues," Irish coach Mike Brey said before prac­tice Monday. "Their paths have been a little bit different -Colin being a consistent guy from day one, Russ taking a little bit differ­ent route, and it's a great story. 
"I think anytime you can have seniors make the All-Conference team I think it says you're guys are getting better every four years." 
Meanwhile, guard Tory Jackson and forward Luke Harangody made the cut for the Big East All­Rookie Team. Jackson took over the starting point guard position
