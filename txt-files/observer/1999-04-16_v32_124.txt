;\uthoritins are still investigating the cause of a fire and explosion that caused an estimated $1 to 2 million in damages to the Notre Dame power plant early Thursday morn­ing. 
Original reports that an ov1irhcat­cd electrical transformer caused the explosion were dnterminnd false after invostigators found the sus­pected transformers intact. said Michael Garvey, assistant dirnr.tor of Public Relations. 
The power plant's cooling towN, which assists in campus air condi­tioning. was severely damaged in the blaze. 
Jim Lyphout, assistant vice presi­dent for Business Operations, expects that campus air r.onditioning will be out of service until ·the sum­mer of 2000. 
"This typCl of equipment is not something you buy off the shelf," he said. The University is looking into temporary air conditioning options for this summer. 
Security officer Jami Thibodeaux, one of two University employees injured in the explosion, remains at St. Joseph's Medical Center with a brok!111 right claviclP. cuts and abra­sions. 
"I don't know in mndical terms what [hisl condition is," said Dmmis Moore, director of Public H<)lations and Information. "Wfl !ward this afternoon that hr had IH'<m upgrad­ed to fair condition." 
Thibodnaux co11ld bn rnlnasnrl today. Moorn said. 
Chief electrical enginnn l'aul Knmpf' returnml homP Thursday fol­lowing surgnry on his hrok,in wrist. Kempf' also sufl'nrnd a brok1•11 l1ig and injured his back in t.lw incichint. 
"Thnsn two pPopln ani so lucky that they weren't hurt worsn," Garvey said. 
Both nmployp,ns am nxpnctnd to makP a full rncovPry, lw said. 
University lirn oflicials contai111id the blaze, which began at 12:58 a.m., by 2:25 a.m., almost an hour al'tPr the nxplosion. J\. small building next to the powpr plant that housed switching nquip11wnt was also dam­aged in the firn. 
Fire damage did not intPrrupt tlrn plant's pownr-producing capabili­ties. 
Oflicials said thny hopn tho invnsli­gation will only takn a l'nw days bul said it may tak11 as long as a few weeks.

Art for better or w-orse 
To write, to draw, to play music, to dance. to act. to paint. tu sculpt ... to make some­thing from your own good brain with your own good hands: to have an idea, to see it to an end, to sefl it from nothing all the) way to something you can hold or see or share ... oh boy! AllT! Who cares? 
It's self absorbed. It's self obsessed. It's entirely selfless. I'm not sure which, artually. 
Art docs not make a betier person or a deaner soul. Nobody is getting into heaven because of a neat T­shirt that he made or because of a great nude movie that she shot that challenged our concept of the miniskirt. Creating art can make you down right mean and nasty somPtimes. I swear. 
And nobody should care about art. There is no "i should go see their rock and roll show," "I should go see their art exhib­it," "I should go see your play," when 1 would rather be with my friends. in my bed or eating ice cream. 
Art is arguably the most important aspect of society. Art is arguably the least impor­tant aspect of society. 
Is there something GOOD about being sur­rounded by art? Is there some better part of life awaiting the sorrowful neglecters of campus art? I guess I might think yes. 
As a community, it has been said, Notre Dame does not like art. I guess that I often agree. 
My point is that there is no "ART IS GOOD, NEGLECTING ART IS BAD", despite the fact that I actually think that art is good and that neglecting it is bad. 
I'm !Paving in a month or so, and I would love to thank every person who has come to see me perform or who has seen my band, The Florida Evans Showband and Revue. And in some way. I'd like to thank everyone who didn't come out and who ate ice cream instead because they felt more like eating ice cream. 
Notre Dame's Battle of the Bands is tonight at Senior Bar. Should you go see it? YES! or, NO! or, I REALLY WANT YOU TO WANT TO. 
That's the conclusion. That's it. I wish that every student at Notre Dame would take the time to be interested in a branch of art and learn about it and DO it and watch it and be a part of it. 
And every artist should complain less and act more, should MAKE an event that will interest people if they don't see it happen­ing. There is a community and an interest to be tapped, but it takes work. Work that isn't always fun. and doesn't always get done. 
Finally. I would like to wish a sincere good luck to artists of next year and the next and the next ... you have a good strug­gle ahead.

Student to seek SI million after alleged police racial attack 
TUCSON, Ariz. 
A Nigerian University of Arizona graduate student Wednesday said he will seek $1 million in damages after an alleged racially-motivated inci­dent in January involving four uni­versity police officers. 
Nurdeen Lawal, an electrical and computer engineering teaching assistant, filed a complaint alleging he was "treated in a physically rough manner"' by University of Arizona police offic('rs 
He is seeking monetary damages from the Arizona Board or Regents, the University of Arizona, UAPD and lliefumom~~onilicwoon~ili~ his civil and constitutional rights were violated. l'APD spokesman sgt. Mike Smith declined comment yes­lerday. 
The claim states that CAPD offi­cers wrongfully identified Lawal as a suspect in a campus robbery and 

Officer Floyd \1allory allegedly "used the fu II force of' his body" to throw Lawal "face-first" into Lhe wall and pulled him up with his arms while handcuffing him, the claim states. 
The complaint also states that Lawal "heard a loud 'pop' from his shoulder area" as Mallory allegedly pulled him to his reel. 
"They could sec in my face-­'please stop humiliating me,"' Lawal said in an interview ycist.erday. 
According to the complaint, police failed to read Lawal his Miranda Bights before questioning him. Lawal sought legal assistancn from attorney Paul Gattone. 
"I was outraged wlrnn he told mn the f'acts," said Gattonci. an attornny at the Southern Arizona Pr.ople's Law Cc11tcr. "lie didn't cvPn look like the\ alleged suspect. The only thing that was Urn same was the color of his skin." 
UA attorney Michael Proctor and Howard Boice, public relations. for Arizona Bureau of Bisk Managl'ment. both said they have not yet received copim; of the claim.

Parents sue over admissions process 
NEW BRUNSWICK, N .J. 
A class action suit, alleging the University treated stu­dents applying to the School of Business-New Brunswick unfairly, is currently underway. "The facts will show how (the University] is patently doing an illegal thing by having different GPA [requirements) in Newark and New Brunswick," Donald Phillips, whose daughter was denied admission to the Rutgers-New Brunswick School of Business, said. The minimum grade point average required for thr, Newark school is 2.5, PhiHips, who is planning to file a suit within the next month, said. The minimum requirement for New Brunswick is 3.1 ­recently changed from 3.0, he said. Donald Phillips, David Rough, whose son was denied admission to the New Brunswick school, and Frederick Stein, whose son applied to New Brunswick, all wrote letters in March to president Francis Lawrence concerning the discrepancies.

BERKELEY, Calif'. 
A 10-hour standoff over the "whittling down" of CC Berkeley's ethnic studies department ended late last night when UC police officers arrested more than 40 students who had stormed and locked down a building on campus. The protest ended violently between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., when police stepped in to break up the protest, pulling resisting demonstrators by the ears and using choke-holds. The stu­dents locked themselves clown in the home of the ethnic studies department after a noontime protest over what they call the "starvation" of the first-of-its-kind program. Protesters threw food, cursed and screamed in anguish as UC police officers forcibly pulled and dragged away the non­compliant protesters. Students locked arms and legs, while police tried to untangle them. In addition to the 43 students, several dozen chanted "Inside, Outside, We're All on the Same Side."

COLLEGE PAHK. Md. 
Some campus students will be up late Thursday studying economics, but not for a class. Instead, they will be putting the finishing touches on their 1998 state and federal taxes, which must be postmarked by midnight. Thos(i who are not brave enough to fill out their 1040s by themsr.lves can consult a tax preparer. Barbara Redlield, the recep­tionist at an H&R Block office, said students have been coming into the office throughout the year. "They've been coming in since about February because of the new Hopp credit," Redfield said, referring to thr. federal tax credit that gives up to $1,000 for the first year of collego and up to $500 for the second year. Hedfield said the price for H&H Block's services is $58 and up. "That includes Maryland and federal taxes," she said. "The extra foes would be for different forms, like capital gains tax and child care credit."

LINCOLN. Neb. 
The high from the drug can last up to 1(1 hours, it's 
cheaper than cocaine and it is increasingly bning made in 
makeshift labs across Nebraska. Sen. Chris Pderson calls 
meth th~ "Midwest Nightmare." Lawmakers advanced a 
bill 26-0 on Wednesday that would increase sentences for 
methamphetamine dealers, making the penalties compa­
rable to dealing crack. "It is less expensive, morn rnadily 
available than cocaine and it has a longer-lasting high," 
said Peterson, who is sponsoring the bill. Currently, peo­
ple who deal 7 ounces or morP of meth recdve a flat sr.n­
tence of one to 50 years in prison. With no mandatory 
minimum, aperson could be eligible for release after serv­
ing the minimum of one year. A person caught dealing 7 
to 16 ounces of meth would spend at least three ynars in 
prison -which is the mandatory minimum -with a 
maximum of 50 years.

General Motors sets new earnings record 
Push from the business community wins Clinton over 
ASSOCIATED PRf.SS 
DETROIT 
General Motors Corp.'s earnings climbed :Sl percent in the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street expectations on continued strong profits in North America. 
GM reported today it earned a record $2.1 billion, or $3.04 a share, in the first three months of the year compared with $1.6 billion, or $2.27 a sharo. during the sameperiod of 1998. 
A rncent survey of analysts by First Call Corp. estimated GM would earn $2.88 a share. 
"It looks like very solid, good results, with a stronger-than-expected perfor­mance in most business units," said analyst David Bradley or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. 
But GM stock was down $1 at $88.75 a share in early trading today on the N(lw York Stock Exchango. 
Sales at the world's largest automak­er totaled $44.05 bil1ion, up 6 ptlrcent from $41. 6 hHlion a year ago.

"Bradley said GM's $25 million loss in Brazil was far less than expected. He had estimated a loss of$130 million.· 
GMAC, the company's financial sub• sidiary, earned $392 million, up 13 percent from $349 million in the com­parable quarter of 1998. It was the host quarter for GMAC since 1991. 
"The financial results reflect our 
continued efforts to improve product 
quality and increase manufacturing 
efficiency," GM president Richard 
Wagoner Jr. said. "Combined with our 
unrelenting cost-reduction activities, 
those factors aUowed us to moot tho 
intense competitive price pressure.'' 
The quarter marked the first time 
GM had back-to-back quartorly earn• 
ings increases since the first two quar­
ters of 1997. 
GM's total autornotivn-rnlated 
income, excluding Delphi, was $1. 5

highly profitable models in the North 
American market, led by tho 
redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and 
GMC Sierra, twin full-size pickups. The 
bi14 truck is <,M's most popular model. 
Although GM's U.S. vehicle sales 
were up 6 percent in the quarter, its 
market share declined to 28.8 percent 
from 30.2 percent in tho first quarter.

By Tuesday afternoon, a president who only a few days before had sounded in no par­ticular rush to conclude a huge trade deal with China was sud­denly in a big hurry. 
Please recycle The Observer. 
Clinton trackf'd Zhu to a suite at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, where the prime minister was warning American executives that many of' the concessions China had made to try to get into the World Trade Organization would unravel if the deal was not finalized, according to some executives who met with Zhu. Taking his case to American business interests, Zhu insisted that compromises allowing American telecommunications firms, farm products, banks and insurance companies into the Chinese market could all perish. 
Tho president and Zhu talked for 20 minutes, during which Clinton offered to issue the third "joint statement" in five days. administration officials said, struggling to explain why

one summit meeting needed three successive announce­ments. 
Clinton promised Zhu that the statemirnt would reiterate that the United States was commit­ted to getting China into the WTO this year, and said the negotiations could be resumed as soon as a team of /\merican negotiators could travel to Beijing, officials said. When Zhu resumed his Waldorf meet­ings with New York investors and business executives Tuesday night, he conf1dently relayed that the deal was "99 percent done," the executives said. 
While I louse officials conced­ed on Wednesday that the turn­about occurred because they had misjudged the dynamics of the China summit. In the end, they had not only angered those in Congress who oppose any deal with China, but those who think one is essential. 

Clinton, thev said, focused on the issues far.too late, and then was stunned by the news reports emphasizing the "fail­ure" to reach a trade agree­ment rather than the conces­sions that the administration had wrung out of Beijing on issues that had dogged American trade relations with China for decades. But what really stung the White Housr. was harsh criticism from the business community. 
Clinton had earlier com­plained privately that business lobbyists had not worked hard to persuade Congress to get the deal done, officials said. But as news of the partial agreements was released last week. with details of the concessions by China disclos!~d. busi1rnss exec­utives conclud<1d that tlw prnsi­dent should just tak<i what he had in hand and dnsP tlH~ <kal. They began a campaign ol' n­mails and phone calls to try to bring Clinton quickly back to tlrn table to finish the accord. 
On Friday, Maurice Grnenberg , the chairman of' the /\merican International Group, a pathbreaker in selling insurance to the Chinese, com­plained to Treasury Secretary Hobert Hubin that the adminis­tration "had missed the train." And when the White !louse hastily that day set up a Monday briefing about the trade deal, Urn administration encountered what one partici­pant cal!Pd "a firestorm."

$1. 7 4 trillion budget passes with tax cuts 
Associated Pres< 
WASIIINCtl'ON 
With unusual speed, Congrnss approv1:d a linal $1.74 trillion budget for fiscal 2000 today that llepublicans hopn will sharpen tlwir image as lax cut­lers and as a party that has moved beyond Prcsidnnl. Clinton's impeachment. 
The Snnatll approved lhn GOP-written plan today by a 54-44 vole that was along party lines. 
The llouse passed the pack­age yesterday by 220-208 in another sharply partisan vote. The two snnators who didn't vote were Tim Hutchinson, H­Ar k.. and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N,Y. 
-r°he measure maps a t 0­year tax cut of at least $778 billion and underlines other issues the GOP will emphasize during this year's run-up to tho 2000 elections: using Social Security's enormous surpluses to reduce the nati.onal debt and spending more for defense and schools. 
Budget passage today marks only the second time Congress has completod the m1msurn on time since setting the April 15 deadlinn in 1987. Eagflr to counter l)(imocratic charges that 
Congress ha·s done little beyond illl(H\achment of' tlw prcsidnnl in recent months. GOP loadnrs want t.o c~ast tlwmsnlvPs as cfficinntly pnr­forming l.lw public's work.

SIIANGIIAI 
A cargo plane crashed min­utes after takeoff Thursday, killing at least five people as it explod~cl in a migrant worker communitv. 
The Kt;rean Air plane, a 7­year-old McDonnell Douglas MD-11. crashed into an indus­trial development six miles southwest of llongqiao airport, Korean Air and Chinese offi­cials said. 
The Seoul-bound plane, car­rying 68 tons of cargo, then plownd into housing for migrant workers, said employ­ees with Shanghai's Minhang district fire deparlment who saw the crash. 
Korean Air said tlrnre was "a 
high possibility" explosives destroyed the plane. 
All three members of' the 11ight crew and four others on the ground were killed, said Moon Chang-boo. the South Korean consul in Shanghai. 
However, at a news confer­ence in the South Korean capi­tal of Seoul, Korean Air said five people died and the fate of the three crew members was unknown. 
Moon said 25 people were injured, some seriously. A doc­tor with Minhang Central Hospital who refused to give his name described 37 people as critically injured. Korean Air said tho plane reached an alti­tude of 15,000 feel before crashing at 4:10 p.m., six min­utes after takeoff.

Another World Less Than Two Hours Away 
A few days ago, a friend and I traveled to Hillsdale College in Hillsdale, Mich., the Mecca of Conservative Liberal Arts Colleges. My friend wanted to see if he should encourage his brother to apply. I'm always up for a new experience. Hillsdale makes ~otre Dame look like a radical liberal East Cnast Ivy League institution. See, it's not that hard to give Notre Dame Ivy League status, it all depends on one's standard of compari­son. 
Jeff Langan 
I think, however, others on this cam­pus will benefit from a pilgrimage to Hillsdale. For example, Right Reason should require all of its staff writers to make a pilgrimage to Hillsdale before writing their first article. It will give them a standard from which to criticize. The Progressive Student Alliance could send its members there after a long fail­ure-filled year. It will give them a rea­son to give thanks to Gaya for how good they have it here after all. Communitarians and States' Righters will see what it takes to buck the federal government. a stubborn will and a lot of monev. 
IIill~dale, in case you don't know, is a small liberal arts college in Soutlrnrn Michigan. It was founded in 1844 by the Free Will Baptists (What is a Free Will Baptist? l, though it currently maintains an indeprndent status. From the begin­ning, it accepted women and men rugardlnss or race, crncd or class. Many of its stu<lPnts fought for the North in tho Civil War. l11 fact, they sent more stmlents into battle than anv other pri­vate school. 
rt is unique among colleges in that it accepts no federal aid. This way, it doesn't have to comply with federal pro­grams. In fact, its students can't even get federal loans. The Supreme' Court decided that if its students accept feder­al loans, then the college has to abide by federal education standards. For exam­ple. foderal law would require Hillsdale to publish its enrollment / statistics, but Hillsdale refuses to publish statistics about the racial make-up or its stu­dent bodv. lt thinks it is able to do a fine job encouraging racial har­mony without the help of the federal govern­ment, thank you. The college opted for its freedom. 
Of course, Hilldale is not for everybody. We met one young lady named Jeannie with orange-dyed hair. She was leaving Hillsdale because it lacked a good science program. l have a feel­
ing it really lacked another student with orange-dyed hair. Jeannie 'lo 
prised to find a decidedly conservative religious bent. Specifically, a bent that would not want the ideas of freedom and religion as articulated by the likes of Mill, Paine and Emerson applied to them. This seems to be a strange ten­
sion in 


found Hillsdale stiffling, but 
many of the other students we met found it liberating. Freedom is a big theme on campus. We counted over 10 statues of eagles. Each 
statue had a quote by a famous individu­alist conservative like John Stuart Mill, Thomas Paine or Ralph Waldo Emerson. I wonder why they didn't have any quotes from any economic anarchists as well? 
On a campus whero freedom and indi­vidualism are on such public display, I was surprised to find a decidedly con­servative studirnt body. I was also sur­

many American con­servative groups. 
On the one hand, there is an advor,acy of radical individualistic er,onomic, social and military policy. Policy r,reatwl on this principle seems at times to be destructive uf traditioual religious and social practices. There is also an advo­cacy of all-embracing hierhrchic and ordered religion. Have the wolf and the sheep embraced too quickly? 
We asked two track stars the moral/political/social makeup of the campus. Without missing a beat, they responded, almost in unison. "Conservative. Definitely conserva.tive. Probably 99 percent conservative." They

¦ LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Operation Allied Force 
No Vietnam, But No 
Desert Storm, Either 
Daniel Leger makes an interesting case both for and against tho ll.S. moral 
stance in the Kosovo crisis, but he rests his case on an ambivalent note, saying 
I.hat it is appropriate to question the moral basis for the bombing. (The 
Obst1rv1-Jr, April 12). But .is it? Th11 crisis, likt~ any other, involv1~s both moral 
and political dilemmas, that makes judging the crisis as difficult as the inter­
vention itself. His concluding point is that it is okay to stand back und tak() no 
forct~t'ul action Ifft produces more evil. Now this is not easy: orn1 can only pic­
ture two different scenes -displaced men, women and children looking for 
food and shelter, or punitive bombing seeking to prevent this human misery. 
Polng p-0thlng and WM1~hing a crisis blow o\1t of proportion was the 
European policy; this was a replay of the crisis in Bosnia in tho narly '90s. 
European dithering brought things to a breaking point there: U.S. action 
pulled things together, ushering peace, Tho Europeans lookod on as this crisis 
unfolded. like the crisis in Bosnht, This crisis has boon in tho making for somH­
time, but with little serious effort on the part of the Europoans to stem its tide. 
Once again, the U.S, watched and waited, and jumped in before it got too late 
-in sorrte ways itwas -'-first with a diplomatic initiative, and wtum it failed, 
with air-strikes, aftnr many warnings went unlrneded by thn Serbs. 
It Is s0111ewhat disconcerting that while the Europeans move toward an inte­
grated community, and with the coming of the Euro al'e II ship clos1)r to it, they 
stiJl lack an effective mechanism for dispute resolution and con11ict provontion. 
The Balkans fall outside the EU framework, but within their backyard, affect­
ing the security of some of the NATO and EU members, They were unable to 
prevent this in Bosnia, and they have been unable to do this in Kosovo, while 
thousands have been mercilessly displaced by Serb warlords. As in the case of 
Bosnia, this may be due to political differences within the Union. 
While thu U.S. role has been mostly welconrnd and supportnd, many ol' its 
aspects are problematic and alarming, having serious implications for tho 
future. The U.S. role signifies a new departure in the role of the United 
Nations ht applying international law, and in the moral use of' f'orce. This 
offers the U.S. license to act unilaterally in any conflict of its choice. on its 
terms, While some Europeans did not seem very keen, and llussia opposed 
this, none had a viable alternative plan to avoid either the conmct or U.S. air­
strikes, apal't from some face-saving diplomatic moves. 
It is the events in the Gulf and the Balkans in the '90s that have emboldened 
Washington to choose its battles, and strike with impunity. bypassing the U.N. 
The capture of three American soldiers and the plight of the rnfugees add

Ah, who the hell cares? 
It's about baseball, it's funny and it's fun. And some­times, that's all a movie really needs. That's what "Major League" delivers, too. It's not high drama, but fun and spirit is what baseball is all about, and few movies can top it without becoming either too silly or too sappy. 
The story is of a new owner, Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitton) who takes over the Cleveland Indians from her deceased husband and comes up with a greedy little plan: Put together tho worst club she pos­sibly can under a no­name manager from a minor league team. Her incentive is that if she can get the team to bring in less than the average attendance quota as deter­mined in the l them to Miam more money nothing new1 though Mr. Re to get the Cit White Sox.

Dumb kids' movie? 
Definitely not. 
Sure, "The Sandlot" has its share of immature jokes and childish themes, but this story of life in simpler days possesses timeless truths, giving it the ability to span generations. 
It is summer. The decade is the '6Os. A kid about 10 years old has just moved into a neighborhood where he knows no one except his mother and his recently acquired stepfather. While most guys his age are out hit­ting baseballs and getting into trouble, this kid is indoors playing with his erector set. He sees the other kids and tries to be friendly. He relates that everyday these kids go to the same lot, hence the title, and pick up the same game they had left yesterday. 
They never pick sides, he says; they never have teams, they never keep score and they never finish a game. He describes it as some ideal game of baseball that nearly has magical qualities. But this kid cannot just jump right in and start playing. For he cannot play baseball -he does not even know how to throw a ball. So, when he attempts to hang out with the gang, he not only does not fit in, but he is chastised. 
That i.s until one member of the team befriends the newcomer and forces the others to accept him into the group. Benny, the best player on the team who breathes, sleeps and dreams baseball, teaches "Smalls" how to throw and how to catch. Before long, it seems as if he was always a part of the group. 
The big conflict comes when Smalls hits his first home run -right over the fence. 
Unfortunately, the ball was autographed by Babe Ruth himself. Unfortunately, the ball belongs to Smalls' less than friendly stepfather. Unfortunately, the other side of the fence is the back yard to a home which houses a "killer beast" of a dog. So, lost to the beast, the ball is gone forever. Unless they can devise a plan.

The All American Girls' Professional Baseball League was developed during World War II for the entertain­ment of' the American baseball fans whose men were off fighting in the war. "A League of Their Own" is a realis­tic portrayal of the real life events of the groups of women who came together to play ball. 
The film focuses primarily on the trials and tribulations of' two sisters, Dottie and Kit (Geena Davis and Lori Petty). Dottie is chosen by a recruiter to play baseball for the league, mostly because of' her looks. Little does he know what a killer catcher and overall ball player she is. She agrees to join the league on one condition: Her kid 

sister Kit can try out as well. Kit loves baseball and Dottie knows she would make a great addi­tion to the league. 
The other women. who were recom­mended by various scouts, eventually gather at a general tryout session where those who arc quali­fied -and look pret­ty in a baseball skirt -are placed on teams. During the tryouts, we are intro­duced to Doris (Rosie O'Donnell) and Mae {Madonna). They seem like bullies at first, but deep down they're just as scared as the rest of the "girls" who arc try­ing out. AU of the women involved in the league eventually form a bond that the audience dis­covers has lasted through a lifetime. 
When the rosters came out. Dottie and Kit were both assigned to the Hockford Peaches, coached by legendary baseball star Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks). Hanks' por­trayal of Dugan is hilarious; whether he's stumbling around drunk in the locker room or yelling at Alice for crying, "Are you crying? Are you crying? There's no cry­ing in baseball." Hanks definitely delivers many laughs. 
The lilm also shows the interaction between members of the Peaches as well as all of the league's teams. 
When Kit is accused by one of her own teammates of not being able to hold her own, a fight erupts and she is traded to the Racine Belles. 
After Kit leaves the Peaches, it is only a matter of time before an expected showdown occurs between the rival teams; and between the sisters. They get that chance at the World Series, where the Belles face the Peaches. 
The sisters face each other head-to-head in the game where loyalty prevails. After the game, Kit and Dottie say their farewells; Dottie leaves for Oregon with her hus­band Bob, who just returned from the war. Kit tells Dottie, "Thanks for getting me on the league." And the respectable Dottie denies responsibility for Kit's success: "I didn't you on the league, you got yourself' on it. I just got you on the train." 
When the A.A.G.P.B.L. was formed, many fans and oven team organizers viewed it as a temporary activity that would continue only until the men's baseball teams regrouped following the war. 
On the contrary, the A.A.li.P.B.L. developed into a truly competitive contest and draws as many fans as the men's teams. The women become impressive baseball players, physically and strategically. They leave the lield knowing that. they changed history and left their mark on the game of baseball. Although there isn't a league today, the success it had was significant enough tu tell the story. 
"A League of Their Own" is not a film simply about baseball, as many "baseball movies" are not either , but rather it is a look at what was happening on the home­front to the women who were left behind during World War IL

the 'Angel Street' 

Saint Mary~ presents a psych.otic tale of . . . paranoia, trust and 1nsan1ty 

By MIKE VANEGAS 
Scene Editor 
MeeUng with the casl of this weekend's "Angel Street." prior to any background concerning the nature of the play, one would guess that they were about to put on a vast comedy, ripe with a harsh sar­castic tone and tfmder comic interplays. 
Yet when the lights dim the Little Theater at the Moreau Center for the Arts at Saint Mary's, and the stage lights brighten, one realizes immediately that the performers truly are performing, having trans­formed into the seriously mad characters who walk along "Angel Street." 
Written by Patrick Hamilton in 1938, "Angel Street" follows Mrs. Manningham (Theresa Carder) as she battles her great fears of insanity. which happened to her mother to the point of death. 
Thrown into the mix is her husband Mr. Manningham, whose intentional lack of trust concern­ing his wife only worsens Mrs. Manningham's state of mind. Switching rambunctiously from a loving hus­band into a secretly cunning madman, Mr. Manningham (David Scott Carroll) becomes the sub­ject of a murder mystery that serves to fling Mrs. Manningham into a deeper paranoia in which she is forced to cboose between insanity or self-assured­ness. 
The man who presents this murderous scandal to Mrs. Manningham is Inspector Rough (Ted Billy). whose trust both Mrs. Manningham and the audience must doubt upon his first appearance. Sporting a laugh that can be taken as either devious or jolly, Rough creates the extreme for Mrs. Manningham ­that she completely mistrust her husband. who allegedly murdered a woman 15 years prior to the time of the play, and is planning to murder her, all in search of some hidden rubies.

Now Playing at Moreau Center for the 
Arts, Little Theater 
Performances Friday and Saturday, 8 p.m. Sunday, 2:30 p.m. 
Ultimately, "Angel Street" gives a glimpse of how the modern thriller has come into existence. Director Mike Morris describes the play as "the granddaddy" of todav's horror lilms, such as "Scream." But he also noted that its age might be a problem for today's audiences. 
"It is pretty intense. I expect the audience will in some cases be terrified," Morris said. "I have exploit­ed the dramatic tension as much as possible, and kind of made things a little bit more risky and violent than the original because of the tastes of modern audi­ences. I've taken every opportunity to imply a little more ... violence than is there." 
Morris assures that any violence is only implied vio­lence, but that the show is not for children, nor for persons with childlike sensibilities. 
Presented by Saint Mary's College 
"Angel Street" still touches on some universal rnn­f'licts that may emerge in anyonn's lifn. Morris described the main theme of the play. 
"In this case, [the conflict isl how advisabln it is for a woman to put all of her self-esteem into the opin­ions of her husband and other people," he said. "Slw has to struggle with believing her own intuitions and her perceptions of things ... what she actually believes to be the truth. 
"In the end, she has to make that decision whether or not to believe what she thinks, or what everybody else tells her [to think]." 
As for the cast, the chemistry is no doubt its strongest attribute. Standing in a larg11 circln 20 min­utes prior to Wednesday evening's dress rnlrnarsal. the seven actors were pleasantly upb!'at and c:alm, considering that the rnhearsal was their last chance to line-tune before opening night. 
But really, it seemed that there wasn't much to li1w­tune when the rehearsal actually began. Asidn l'rom a few jumbled lines, the actors' calmnnss was wnll-sup­ported by an impressive focus that began l'orming wnll bnforn they went on stage. 
The fact that "Angel Stre1~t" is a thrillnr makns this focus that much more important. 
"This is such a specific genrn, wlwrP ewrything is so timed, that it's benn a cld'initl'iy cliffnrPnt Pxperi­ence, to work with such important timing." said Margaret Schugt, who plays the snrvant Flizalwth. 
One misstep on stag1\, thernl'on~. could ruin an entire scene, or even an entire act. Tlw cast is lticky to have such chemistry and such an intPnse rnllnctive focus. This same chemistry allows [or some playl'ul interaction, bordering on a joking bitterrrnss. 
When Billy tried to put the play into a historical pPr­spective, stating that "Angel Street" is "a f'nminist psy­chodrama written by an Englishman in tlw 1 'HOs." the three actresses immediately questio1wd his juxta­position of the words 'feminism' and 'psychodrama.' An argument ensuncl in which all tlw actors gavn tlwir opinions concPrning the possibln fominist implications of' the play, at the same time.. 
The actors also gracefully discussed tlw !'act that ''The School for Scandal" is playing at Nolrn Damn this weekend as wnll. Initially joking that tlwy hadn't heard about the play. or. ewm Notn• l>anw, tlw cast eventually admitted that it was just a casn of'. poor liming. They also exprnssed their d1\sirn lo bn able to support the playors in "Tim School for Scandal.. by going to watch the play, and to havo thosn actors visit the Little Thnator to check out "Angnl Strnnt." This was clearly compounded by tlrn fact that "Angol Stroot" costume dosignnr Greta Zandstra is acting in the Notro Damn production. 
But still, the show must go on, and clearly this cast of seven surely will rnmemlrnr "Angel StrPd" not only as the thriller it excitedly is, but for tlH1 f'rinnclship and l'amily thny all have gained by working on thn play. Carroll summed it up in anotlwr witty comnwnt. 
"We~ just bought a house togcth1)r," he said. 
Though the theater is not a house. throughout this wnckend, it is a homP l'or this tight-knit group of' actors. And it surely is a sweet honw.

Dear Notre Dame Students, 

This weekend April 16 and 17, the University will host approximately 800 members of The Edward Frederick Sorin Society, a financial support group for Notre Dame. Made up of alumni, parents, and friends, this generous crowd gathers once ·every year for what we call "A Weekend of Recognition," an effort on the University's part to say thank you for all that they do for Notre Dame. The group is responsible, for example, for funding $2.2 million annually in ~xpendable scholarships. They have also supported a variety of campus 
improvements. 
During the weekend there will be several events, a couple of which will, unfo~unately, _inconvenience your usual schedule. In particular, on Saturday evening we will hold our closing event, a dinner, in the North Dining Hall. As a result, those who normally eat in North Dining Hall are asked to use the South 
Dining Hall for Saturday dinner. On behalf of the Sorin Society, please accept our sincere gratitude for your great cooperation. Special thanks too, to all the students participating in the weekend~-the event simply would not occur without you.

Vanderbilt, DiNardo settle suit 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. 
Both Vanderbilt and Gerry DiNardo claimed victory Thursday in their long-run­ning dispute over whether the former football coach broke his contract and owes the uni­vNsity $281,886. 
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati sided with Vanderbilt on Wednesday in finding DiNardo broke terms of a five-vear contract in 1994 when ·he took the coaching job at LSU. 
But the court scnt the case back to U.S. District Court in NashvillA to detArminA whether he also violated the terms of a two-year contract extension be signed that year. 
"We won 75 percent of the case. and it was a draw on 25 percent," Vanderbilt lawyer John Callison said. " ... From our perspective, it's a great victory. It's not just about money, it's a matter of princi­ple. We honor our contracts with the coachns; the coaches should honor their obligation to us." 
DiNardo said in a statement from Baton Rouge, La., he was "very pleased" with the appel­late court decision. 
U.S. District Judge Robert Echols ruled in 1997 that DiNardo owed Vanderbilt $281.886 for the final year of the original 11ve-year contract and the two-year extension.

The figure came from tlHi base salary of $91,781 per year for the three years, plus $6,541 for the tirrrn between DiNardo's Dec. 12, 1994, res­ignation and the Jan. 5 expira­tion date on his contract. 
Callison said because the appeals court ruled DiNardo broke his original contract, he owes the school a minimum or one year's salary plus interest. 
DiNardo said he will pay one year's salary if Vanderbilt drops the case.

"I want to restate that I remain prepared to satisfy my obligations under my original employment agreenrnnt. In fact, I have f'iled papers with the federal district court in Nashville stating that I would fulfill that obligation," he said. 
Callison says Vanderbilt isn't willing to settle for that. 
"We have said all along that we are cntitlod not only to tlrn last year, but to the two-year extension. We entered into them in good faith. We expect coach DiNardo to honor them in good faith," Callison said. 
The key questions am whether DiNardo's brother and lawyer, Larry DiNardo,

On Aug. I 7, 1994. Gerry DiNardo signed thn extension but told tlrnn-Vanderbilt ath­letic director Paul Houlahan, "Larry nAeds to see a copy before this thing is linalizod," according to court documents. 
The Tennessean niportBd on Aug. 20, l 994, that DiNardo's contract had lrn<\11 extended and the coach stated publicly that he was "excited" about it 
Four days later. Callison faxed an unsigned copy of th<\ draft to Larry DiNardo, writ­ing on it to "let me know if' you have any questions." 
On Sept. 27, Callison faxed Larry DiNardo about his brother's television and radio contract, adding that: "I would like your comments on the contract extension." 
Larry OiNardo tBstified that he neither participated in the draf'ting nor suggested changes to tlw contract. 
"It is not unreasonable to infer that the partios had not completely nngotiatnd thP details of tlrn contract nxtnn­sion; the original contract did not expire for another year," Appeals Court Judge John Gibson wrotn. 
"We cannot say that Larry DiNardo's failurn to objnct by Dec. 12, 1994. constitutes an acceptance of tlrn addendum."

Tlrn draft has been dominat­ing the front pagi~s and home­pagns of' most sports sourcns for a solid wnnk and a hall' now. 
This kind of' coverag,, is usu­ally only resorvcd l'or the Supnr Bowl and tlw mmlia blitz that accompanies it. Let's sit f'or a minutn and ponder this: Uw l'Xcit<•rnPnt ol' tlw draft vcrst1s Llw excitenwnl or tlrn Supnr Bowl. 
Watd1ing three stuffed suits ponder wtwt.lrnr a :-WO-pound man who can nm a 4.9 is a bnt­tPr pick than a 250-pound man who can run a 4.!i vnrsus watching tlw Buffalo Bills losP again. O.K. bad examplo, but you gnt my point. 
ThA draft is usually exciting for about as long as the World Series of billiards. flow neces­sary is it to show nvery single pick in the draft? 
We could instead be showing a baseball game or even co-cd hurling. I understand the excitement of watching the first round. 1 understand watching the snr.ond round. 
But even thP commissioner cannot put up with all eight rounds. Ilis lifo is supposed to be dedicat11d to football and he doosn't find the sixth. seventh and eighth rounds exciting. Does it really observe the intnnse cov11ragc and specula­tion that the media gives it? I think not. 
Speaking of spnculation. I havn a problnm with Mel Kiper Jr. I mean really, who is this guy'? He has onn weekend worth of' work the entire vear. 
Yeah. yeah he has to do r<'SParch the play11rs, the teams and their needs. And I under­stand Lhat Im occasionally docs college football commentary. but ESPN kenps him to analyze the draft. Is this really a job'? 
l can only imagine the job description. Wanted: Porson to predict football draft on one weekend of the year. Need little in terms of broadcasting skills. Must have thn perfor.t face for radio. Must be able to sound like you're an expert even if you have little idea of what you're talking about. Good pre­dictions are not necessary. Only need about a 25 percent suc­cess rate after the first round. More importantly, must be abie to gloat when you get a pick right and act shocked when prediction is wrong. 
In return. you'll get an all expense paid trip to New York. a spot on national television, your own Web site, an hon­orary title of "draft expert. .. and salary that those people who must have bolter success ratn in guessing accurately, like doctors, can only hope to see someday. Predicting the draft is your only responsibility. 
Do you realize that aside from the first round, Kiper guesses wrong more than he docs right? Sometimes, Im doesn't even do well in thn first round. Ol'lhn top 10 picks last year, Kiper got l'xactly four right. I don't think many stock analysts could stc1~· in busiiwss with that kind of a n•rnrd. Could you imagi,w tlw turmoil if the leading seismologist could only prndict earthquakes accu­rately if they wern above an 8. Or how about if airlit11\S could only predir.t your destination within a fow miles'? 
The point is that Kip('r's suc­cess is no better than anv m•pr­agn Joe could do with a iittln hit of research. Consider that last yoar KiJwr had Ryan Leaf' and Knvin Dyson alwad of Handy Moss, Fred Taylor. Hobnrt Edwards and Vonnin llolliday. 
In f'act. KipPr had Moss, · arguably Urn bnst ro"kin lo entnr the NFL in a long time, 20th on his top 60 prospncts. Close Mel, closn. 
To fmjoy this kind of' succnss and havn this lw your primary occupation is absurd. If anotlwr one of thesn jobs open up with the same expectations Int nw know. I'm ganw.

Rocket finally signs with Dallas 
A,.ociare<l Press 
IHVING, Tt>xas 
After a. month of reported signings, th1-1 Cowhoys made a real deal with th£' Rocket on Thursdav. 
Dallas 'signed fr1;p agent widr recci,er Haghib "Rocket" Ismail to a seven-vear, $21.5 million rfoal that ir{rlndes a $5 million signing honu;;, 
Humors of a deal had been rampant sinco March, and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said thP signing makes the Cowboys a little faster. 
"He's got the speed, the run after the catch, he really knows how to make something happen after he catches the ball."Jones said. "We've been criticized internally, as well as externally, about our speed situation, and he addresses th2.t." 
For tbe past three seasons, Ismail has playP.d for Carolina, and he has been working out at 
¦ MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
the Panthers' facility this off­soason. He recently acquired a new home in Charlotte, N.C. 
Jones said Ismail will help take pressure off rece.iver Michael Ir;-in. 
"Thev won't be able to dou­ble-or·triple-team Michael likl' they did at the end of last sea­son."Jones said at a news r.on­ferencc Thursday, which Ismail did not aLtend. 
On Tu1>sday, the Cowboys re­worked Troy Aikman's con­tract. Aikman's new deal will pay him $85.5 million through 2007. making him the highest paid player in the ;\/FL -again. 
Th<' Aikman deal, which included a $20 million signing bonus, freed up room under the Cowboys· salary cap, which reportedly had a mere $400.000 to spare beforehand That gave Jones the money to strike deals with three players on his wish list. 
In signing Ismail, Jones goL 
his second wish. 
Also Tuesday, the Cowboys signed contor Mark Stepnoski to a five-year, $10.5 mi.Ilion wntract, plus a $3 ..5 million signing bonus. Stepnoski spent six years with the Cowboys until signing with Houston aftor lhe 1994 season. 
Jones said Thursday that the Cowboys were in negotiations with linebacker Quentin Coryatt and hopPd to have a deal donP by f.'riday. Coryatt played in 78 games for the Indianapolis Colts over six seasons before he was released after last season to make room under the salary cap. 
The Cowboys reportedly have had verbal agreements with Stepnoski, Ismail and Coryatt for several weeks but couldn't finalize Uw deals until they had lhe salary cap room lo sign them. The !'.FL is invest.igating whethn that happenod and if the team violated league rules. 
Nomo speaks out from minors 
Associated Press 
DES MOI!\ES, Iowa Nomomania mav have sub­sided. but only a little. 
Nearly 30 reporters and pho­tographers, including a dozen from his native Japan. gathered Thursday night to hear Hideo Nomo talk about his hopes of getting back to the major leagues. 
"iomo is pitching for the Chicago Cubs' Triple-A team in D1-1s Moines. the Iowa Cubs. He won his first start at Salt Lake City last Sunday and is sched­uled to pitch again Friday night in the team's home opener against Las Vegas. 
"So far it's been a real com­fortable environment," Nomo said through an interpreter. "The coaches, managers and players have all been great. It makes my job a lot easier." 
Nomo became a national sen­sation in Japan when he rr,achecl the major leagues with the Los Angeles Dodgers and was the National League's rook­if! of the year in 1995. 
-
Dozens of reporters from Japan chronicled his every movr, and the games he pitched were televised back in his homeland. Thursday, on a cold, rainy night, he continued to draw attention, though not to the extent to which he had become accustomed. 
"It's settled down a bit," Nomo said. "It's not like it was back there." 
Nomo was traded last June to the New York Mets, who released him after he went 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in four appear­ances this spring. The Cubs snapped him up and will evalu­ate him after three minor league starts. 
Asked if he thought this was his last chance to return to the major leagues ;\/omo replied. "That I don't know. It's hard to say." 
In his first start, Noma gave up three earned runs and six hits in five innings. After a rocky start, he retired nine of his last 10 batters, striking out three. 
Whether he can continue where he left off in that game remains to be seen, Nomo said. 
"All I can say right now is physically I'm well prepared for the game," he said. "If I make good pitches and they hit them. there's nothing I can do about it. All J can say is I will be pre­pared."

'.'iomo's scheduled appearance has been a money-maker for the Iowa Cubs, who have sold more than 9,000 tickets for the game. 
But the weather might not cooperate. As much as 2 inches of snow is forecast for Friday and light snow and tempera­tures in the low 30s are predict­ed for Friday night. 
Nomo said lousy weather won't bother him. 
''I've pitched in cold weather before in the major leagues so I'm not worried about it," he said. 
Nomo would not speculate on his chances of getting to Chicago or whether he would need more than three starts to prove himself.

Defensive line to take on a new look next season 
By MIKE CONNOLLY 
Associate Sports Editor 
While much attention has been focused on new offensive coordinator KPvin Rogers and the Irish offense, the 1999 I r i s Ii ,--------, 
defense is adopting a new look this spring. 
Defensive coorel inator G r c g Mattison has 

instituted a Bob Davie new four­man defensive line this off­season. The Irish have not lost a single letter-winner from last year's rlel'f•nsive !ill(> and havn· furthor bolsternd the line by moving junior Grant Irons to thP defensive line. 
"I think the four-man front fits our personnel well," head coach Bob Davie said. "We have good dPpth along the defensive line." 
"That's thP biggest reason we have gonf' to four down­Iinemen; because we do have so much experience," Mattison said. 
In his first two seasons as defensive coordinator. Mattison took advantage of the talented linebacker core by running a 3-4 defense. The 
¦ FOOTBAU 
three defensive linemen and four linebackers allowed Mattison to use Korv Minor, Bobbie Howard and Jimmy Friday most effectively. 
With the graduation of Minor, Howard and Friday, however. l\1attison has been forced to adjust his philoso­phy. 
Hemnants of the 3-4 defense will still remain in this vear's four-man front defense. Rather than playing one mid­dle and two outside lineback­ers, the defense will keep two inside backers and shift the outside lirrnbacker to either side of the defense depending on the formation. 
Junior Anthony Denman and senior Ronnie Nicks have omcrged as the leading candi­dates for the two inside line­backrr spots. Denman backed­up Minor at outside linebacker the past two years and has successfully made the transi­tion to inside linebacker. 
Nicks played well last year as a back-up inside line­backer, but injuries have plagued him throughout his career. 
Sophomores Tyreo Harrison and Carlos Pierr'3-Antoine also have impressed Mattison this spring. 
"Anthony Denman hasn't played all that much -but in 
my mind he has played," Davie said. "From that point. it turns into young players who haven't played a lot, like Harrison and Pierrc­An toine and even Bonnie Nicks, who just needs to stay healthy." 
At outsirle line­backer, Rocky Boiman has emerged on the scene as the starter. The sopho­more has impressed the coaching staff' with his work ethic and intensity. 
Without a single returning starter and early season games against Big Ten pow­ers Purdue and Michigan. the linebackers must continue to improve. But at this point of the spring. Mattison has been impressed by the improvement of' the linebackers. 
"I think our kids are working very hard to improve and right now I am happy with their progress," he said. 
On the defensive line, Anthony Weaver, Brad Williams, Lance Legree and Lamont Bryant have emerged as starters. 
Mattison hopes that the four­man front will give the Irish a better pass-rush. Tim Irish only got eight sacks from their defensive linemen in 1998. 

"We have to get better on the pass rush," Mattison said. "That has been a big negative of ours so we need to get bet­ter on the pass rush." . 
Weaver, who was named to the 1998 All-Freshman first team by Football News. start­ed every game last year at defensive end. He finished sec­ond on the team in tackles for losses and will be expected to 
play even strongPr this year.
