Candidates running for the 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students tend toward conservatism in the issues relevant to the Mock Convention platforms, according to this week's survey by The Observer and the Mock Convention Committee. A majority were against abortion and favored a national drinking age, although only 39 percent favored capital punish­ment. 
Of the 120 students interviewed, 70 percent were on-campus Notre Dame students, 20 percent were Saint Mary's students and 10 percent were off-campus students from both schools. 
The questions and results were as follows: 
On the issue of abortion, are you pro-life or pro-choice? Pro-life ... 70 percent Pro-choice ... 27.5 percent Undecided .... 2.5 percent Of pro-lifers: Are you in favor of a con­
stitutional amendment making abortion illegal? 
Yes ... 66 percent 
No ... 32 percent 
Of those who were pro-choice: Are you in favor of legalized abortion? 
Yes ... 68 percent 
No ... 32 percent 
Are you for or against a national drinking age?

paign posters and platforms. 
Many promises have been made by each of the nine tickets running for the offices of president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer for the class of '87, each fairly similar to the others. 
The largest concern of the can­didates is focused on class unity and making the upcoming sophomore class more aware of events taking place on campus. Class trips, dinners, and masses are a constant among the candidates' promises, but there are also many interesting activities that will set each ticket apart. 
On the whole, the posters express an attitude of hope for success to come, and each ticket asks to become a vital part of the Notre Dame community.

Two Democrats drop out of race after severe New Hampshire losses 

Associated Press 
Democratic presidential can­didates invaded the South yester­day with John Glenn proclaiming himself the "new underdog" and Gary Hart saying he would fight for votes in the region. At the same time, two southern contenders were forced out of the race by dismal finishes in New Hampshire.

cent of Tuesday's primary vote, told a Washington news conference the results "got me back to a hard reality." 
Askew got only one percent in New Hampshire and told a Miami news conference, "I tried to be true to myself and my deepest convic­tions." 

Glenn spoke to the Alabama Legislature at the state Capitol in Montgomery, while Hart stopped at the city's airport for a news con­ference at which he said, "I don't expect to be rejected in the South." 
Glenn told the Legislature, "I guess I'm what you would call the new underdog today." The Ohio senator finished a distant third in New Hampshire after winding up fifth in the Iowa caucus~s. 

Hart was the surprise winner of the New Hampshire primary, and the Colorado senator quickly was challenged by Walter F. Mondale to compete for support throughout the South. 
"Well, Fritz, here I am," Hart 

said on his arrival in Alabama. 
"I think the voters of Alabama 

just like the voters of New Hamp­
shire will send a message to the 
Washington establishment and the 
special interests and will not submit 
to insider control of the 
Democratic Party," he added. 
Mondale was in Washington yesterday and planned to campaign in Maine and Georgia today. 
Bowing out of the race, Hollings said, "I announce today that I will be stepping aside as an active can­didate in this presidential contest." 
"It was one of the best educations I've ever had," he added. 
Hollings said he wasn't certain which of the remaining contenders he might support for the nomina­tion. "I won't be bashful," he said, adding that he would announce his choice at the time of the March 17 South Carolina caucuses. 
"The usual statement is 'a funny thing happened to me on the way to the White House,' " said Hollings. "Nothing happened to me on the way to the White House." 
Askew told reporters in Miami that "I believe I succeeded in meeting all my goals, yet I've not succeeded in winning any votes." The former governor said lack of money was the big reason forcing him out of the race before his home state primary March 13. 
"I think I could carry Florida, but it would also require substantial expenditures," he said. "It would put me into substantial debt and I'm not ready to do that." 
Askew sought support in Iowa and New Hampshire by campaign­ing as "the different Democrat." On most issues, he and Hollings were the two most conservative candidates in the race. 

Bubble

Belmear received her Ph.D. in microbiology from Notre Dame in 1965. She was an associate faculty fellow until she left Notre Dame in 1971. Most of her research was in bone marrow transplants. 
"Dr. Belmear actually did most of the work with David," said Pollard. She stayed with him until he was almost five years old. Cur­rently a biology professor at Roswell Park Memorial Institute, she was also for a time at Baylor, where she did research in ex­perimental biology. 
Neither Wilson nor Belmear were in the movie, "The Bubble Boy,'' which starred John Travolta and was about a child with immune deficiency syndrome. Belmear said, "David never saw the movie 
because we didn't think it would have been good for him." She thought that the movie had some "parts that were well done." But she also felt that some of the movie was "a little far out, because :t showed things that just aren't po·,si­ble." 
Belmear said, "We taught David to love Notre Dame; he had Notre Dame sweatshirts and if he had liv­ed we were going to send him to Notre Dame."

"Chapman probably is as good an individual player as we've seen all year," says Irish coach Digger Phelps. "He scores, he rebounds, and he makes them go. They're all a tough, hard-nosed group of kids, and they don't ever quit. DePaul found that out the hard way two weeks ago." 
Sedric Toney, a 6-2 junior out of Dayton, adds 10.8 points from the backcourt to go along with the 6.6 of fellow junior Larry Schellenberg. The 6-3 Schellenberg is known for his drive and reckless abandon when out on the court. 
The other Dayton starter is 6-6 Damon Goodwin. The versatile sophomore contributes 10.4 points to the Dayton cause per game. 
As for the Irish, Tom Sluby con­tinues to be the man Notre Dame looks to for the bulk of its scoring. The senior captain is now averaging almost 18 points a game(l7.9) after his 30 point showing last Saturday against Marquette. 
''Sluby probably played his finest game for us Oast Saturday), " says Phelps. "He reminded a lot of peo­ple of Adrian Dantley." 
Tomorrow, it will be to a high degree, a battle between two ex­citing offensive stars in Sluby and Chapman, but there will, of course, be much at stake for the two teams involved. 
Before this season started, Dayton coach Don Donoher asked Phelps to design new uniforms for his team, which the Irish coach agreed to do. "I hope they get uniform of the year," Phelps cracks. "It's -probably the only award I'll get this year." 
Now, near the end of this season, if Notre Dame has any hope of get­ting the award of making the NCAA tournament, it must design tomorrow's game to be a win.

five of these tournaments. In the sabre, the Irish will be represented by three fencers with outstanding records. Leading the way is junior captain Mike Janis (40-3 on the year) along with sophomore Don Johnson at 35-6. Sophomore John Edwards, who has been out of action for the past two weekends due to an ankle in­jury, will complete the trio with his 27-1 record. 
The epeeists will be led by junior captain Andy Quaroni who went 34-3 in the regular season. The lineup will also include sophomore Brian St. Clair (31-9) and freshman John Haugh at 29-8. 
Among the competing Irish foilers will be two U.S. Junior Olympians -sophomore Mike VanderVelden and freshman Charles Higgs-Couthard. 
VanderVelden (32-8) won the gold medal in foil at the Junior Olympics in Portland two weeks ago while Higgs-Couthard led the Irish fencers in wins with a 43-6 record. Senior captain Chris Grady who has been truly impressive late­ly, will anchor the squad with his 29-12 mark. 
According to DeCicco, the tour­nament will be dominated by Wayne State and Notre Dame; however, "a fencer here or there will be competitive."

Besides the men, the lady Irish will also be competing for NCAA bids. The Irish, who ended the season with a 13-5 team record will be represented by three underclassmen. 
Freshman Pia Albertson (37-2) and Cindy Weeks (20-13) along with sophomores Janet Sullivan (21-12) will be trying to overcome an equally strong women's Wayne State team. 
Those who fail to qualify for the NCAA tomorrow will be in action again on Sunday at Northwestern where the final bids for the national tournaments will be announced.

Pete Culhane, the Bengal boxer who collapsed shortly after a sparring session, will be released from St. Joseph's hospital today, according to one of the Boxing Club's officers, Angelo Perino. 
Culhane, an MBA student from Seabrook, Tex., suffered a minor concussion Monday, passing out about five minutes after finishing a sparring session with a friend. After finishing the fight and taking off his equipment, Culhane had talked to some of the other fighters before complaining of dizziness. He was on his way to the trainer's room when he passed out. 
He was immediately taken to the hospital where he regained consciousness. His injury was not as serious as had been feared and, according to Perino, was never seriously in trouble. 
"One of the first things he said to me in the hospital was, 'Can I still box?' " said Perino. "He was really disappointed he couldn't fight. He really looked forward to the Bouts. 
"It's really a shar.1e bc:cause he was one of our more talented 160­pounders and he was evenly matched with the guy he was sparring with. He just got hit by a good punch."
