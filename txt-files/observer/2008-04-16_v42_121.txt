Former athlete starts non-profit org. 
Injuredfootball player Abdel Banda created SBIG to give back to community, movefonvard with life 
By AMBER TRAVIS 
News Writer 
When Notre Dame senior Abdel Banda suffered a career ending football injury during his sophomore year he didn't know in what direction he wanted to take his life. After some search­ing, he and his friend Thomas Killian, Jr., created Students Bridging the Information Gap (SBIG), a non-profit organization based in New Jersey. 
Banda said he wanted to create SBIG because of the combination of hardships he endured and the fact that he has the ability to be able 
to give back. 
"A lot of people have helped me out and they have always told me a lot that you've got to give for­ward," he said. "I feel like God has given me a lot of gifts and I have a responsi­bility [to give back]." 
SBIG plans to choose an orphanage to give funds to each year based on a needs assessment process, Banda said. 
Each orphanage chosen will receive adequate fund­ing to install approximately 12-15 computers, build fully equipped facilities such as computer labs and libraries and hire full-time computer teachers in order to teach various technological skills, he said. 
This year, the organiza­
tion will be donating  over  
$50,000  raised  at  two  
fundraisers  held  in  New  

York City in February and March to Basco, an orphan­age with about 300 children of all ages located an hour outside ·of Accra, the capital of Ghana, Banda said. 
Banda recruited former teammate Maurice Crum Jr. to help him work with the organization while he is at Notre Dame. 
Crum said he was excited when Banda told him he was going to start the organization because he thinks helping others is nee­
essary. 
"I jumped at the opportu­nity based on the back­ground information of what the organization is and what it stands for," he said. "Anything that I can do to help anyone, I'm all for it." 
Banda agreed, saying the organization follows Notre Dame's teachings of helping others. 
"Notre Dame is always teaching about humanity and service, and we are doing it," Banda said. "The importance of service has really been instilled in me here at Notre Dame." 
Banda and Crum are in

Indiana state treasurer Richard Mourdock spoke about the opposition Abraham Lincoln's presi­dency faced at the College Republican's inaugural Lincoln Day dinner Tuesday night. 
Mourdock described Abraham Lincoln as a presi­dent who succeeded in the face of challenges.

He said the challenges Lincoln faced as president during the Civil War are comparable to those faced by George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. 
"Every life we have lost in Iraq, all 4,000, is precious," he said. "Imagine if tonight, 3 percent of those who went on patrol did not return. During the Civil War, it was 3 percent of the entire American population.

Seniors reveal class gift 

SMC to donate portrait of Sister Madeleva 
By LIZ HARTER Saint Mary's Editor 
The Saint Mary's Senior Gift Campaign announced the Class of 2008 will donate a portrait of Sr. M. Madeleva Wolff to the College as they graduate to honor their experience on campus. 
The new portrait will replace the current one in the lobby of Madeleva Hall, which has begun to show signs of disre­pair.. 
"The old Madeleva memorial greatly needs updating," 2008 senior gift chair Beth McKevitt said. "The current portrait is extremely faded." 
McKevitt said her committee wanted to find a gift that would reflect the Holy Cross mission of the College and originally considered leaving funds in place to repair the cross on top of LeMans Hall but that was too expensive. The committee then found out that Madeleva Hall would be renovated once the new aca­demic building, Spes Unica Hall, opens in the fall. 
"Once we discovered that Madeleva Hall would be undergoing major renovations in the near future it seemed very fitting to honor Sr. Madaleva in this way," McKevitt said. "[The Class of

By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 

Around 400 students woke up early last Saturday to help make a difference in the South Bend community through the city's Rebuilding Together St. Joseph County project. 
Rebuilding Together is a not-for-profit partnership between local government and business volunteers as well as other nonprofit organizations in the area to help refurbish homes and neighborhoods in the South Bend area, according to the project's Web site. 
This ye.ar the project worked to improve 23 homes in the Northwest side of South Bend, said Darrell Paulsen, Campus Ministry assistant director for retreats and. national pro­grams. 
Due to rainy weather, vol­unteers were not able to work on outdoor painting projects, but accomplished a lot of interior work such as washing down homes and cleaning garages and exteri­or work such as raking yards and overall landscaping, Paulsen said.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 



Group discusses issues with CCAC 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY and 
MANDl STIRONE 
News Writers 
Student body vice president Sarah Falvey announced that she attended the third Community/Campus Action Coalition (CCAC) meeting as a proxy for student body presi­dent Mickey Gruscinski at the Board of Governance (BOG) meeting Tuesday. 
At the meeting the CCAC addressed issues including approving the mission state­ment of the coalition, she said. 
Falvey read the mission state­ment aloud to BOG. "CCAC will be a viable mecha­nism to enhance partnerships and build positive long term relationships within the cam­puses and community in order to address safety in residential neighborhoods, build stronger neighborhoods and enhance the quality of life for all," she said. 
In addition, the CCAC addressed three major issues the community has been having with students, she said. 
The first issue was "illegal use of single-family housing that violates zoning ordinances," Falvey said. 
Another problem was "unruly off-campus behavior," during Senior Week in particular, she said. 
The third thing addressed was promoting safety for all residents, she said. 
"We might try and set some­thing up that's like a neighbor­hood watch for students, and set up some kind of off-campus list serve," Falvey said. 

Both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's were praised during the meeting for their efforts in the Rebuilding Together project this past weekend and for students' efforts in general, she said. 
"They commended us --not just Saint Mary's but Notre Dame as well and all off-cam­pus students -for our efforts so far," she said. "For the efforts of the members of the CCAC for really working togeth­er. We're creating something positive, and it might not seem like it but we are making great strides." 
In other BOG news: 
The 
Board of Trustees will be arriving on campus tomor­row and staying through the weekend, Gruscinski said. 

There 
will be a memorial mass for the victims on the shooting at Virginia Tech, chief of staff Lauren Theiss said. The mass is at 9 p.m. in Holy Spirit Chapel in LeMans Hall. Afterward candles will be lit and the list of the victims' names will be read. BOG will hand out black ribbons in the Student Center atrium during breakfast, lunch and dinner hours in memory of the victims, Theiss said. .  As a part of Hunger and Homeless Awareness week there will be a "Faces of Homelessness" panel, made up 


of residents of the Center for the Homeless, will be held in the West Wing of the Noble 
Family  Dining  Hall  on  
Wednesday from  5:30-7:30  
p.m., said Falvey.  

 
BOG is sponsoring a bus trip to Chicago on Saturday. Students can get tickets at the front desk of the Student Center. 

saint 
Mary's is teaming up with Indiana University-South Bend (IUSB) to hold joint com­munity productions of their monologues, women's issues commissioner Becki Faunce said. The production will be held at 7 p.m. at the Century Center. Tickets are $10 each. 

several 
sessions on salary equality in the workplace will be held in Carroll Auditorium from 1-5 p.m. on April 22 as part of the "Bridging the Gap: Reaching Pay Equity in Indiana" forum, Faunce said. 

+The Center for Spirituality is bringing Dr. Barbara Fiand to campus Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in the Little Theatre in Moreau Center for the Arts to discuss "Awe-filled Wonder: the Interface of Science and Spirituality," Falvey said. This lecture is part of the Madeleva Lecture series.

ND to hold events for sexual assault aw-areness 
Special to The Observer 
It is a highly troubling U.S. Department of Justice statistic that an estimated one in every four women will be sexually assaulted during their college years. In the interest of prevent­ing such crimes and informing students and others about resources that are available to them, Notre Dame is observing Sexual Assault Awareness Month through a number of campus programs. 
"Rape and sexual assault are very real problems on virtually every college campus in the nation, and Notre Dame is no exception," said Ann Firth, asso­ciate vice president for student affairs. "The University's stance is clear: rape and sexual assault are unacceptable at Notre Dame and cannot be tolerated." 
Firth added: "As we work to eliminate sexual violence on this campus, every member of this community shares responsibility for creating and maintaining an environment which promotes the safety and dignity of each individual. Sexual Assault Awareness Month is an opportu­nity for each of us to reflect on whether we, individually and collectively, are thinking and acting in ways that are congru­ent with this responsibility." 
The student group Feminist Voice of Notre Dame will host a "Take Back the Night" event for students, faculty and staff from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross on Monday, begin­ning at 7 p.m. with a prayer service at the Grotto, followed by a march through campus and a reception. The event is free and open to the public. 

"By encouraging members of this community to speak out, Notre Dame organizers of Take Back the Night' hope to support and empower survivors of rape and sexual assault," said Heather Rakoczy, director of Notre Dame's Gender Relations Center (GRC), which is coordi­nating the event with Feminist Voice. "In the process, they strive to raise awareness ­reminding members of this com­munity that rape and sexual assault happen on and off cam­pus to members of our Notre Dame family." 
A related student group, Men Against Violence (MAV), current­ly is conducting a campus-wide poster campaign titled "No Matter What You Do... Be a Man Against Violence," which fea­tures male Notre Dame students from various athletic programs and student groups encouraging other men to take a pledge against violence. 
Through its annual pledge drive, MAV aims to put an end to sexual assault and domestic vio­lence in the campus community. Participants sign a statement promising to never allow anyone to be raped, abused or exploited if the act is in any way preventa­ble, and to never commit such crimes themselves.

French bill takes aim at ultra-thin 
PARIS -It started with pro-anorexia Web sites, secretive corners where adolescents with eating disorders share sickening sagas of starvation. But Valery Boyer's mission didn't stop there. 
Protruding ribs on catwalks, gaunt frames airbrushed to look even thinner on magazine covers -the French lawmaker says these images are dangerous, too. 
So dangerous that she drafted a bill making it illegal to promote extreme thinness or anorexia. A majority in France's lower house of parliament agreed, joining her Tuesday in adopting the draft legislation. 
While outsiders may still think of the French as trim and chic. France's body shapes are undergoing the same mwlution found in indus­trialized countries everywhere: Rising obesity, especially among children -and rising num­bers of eating disorders.

The remains of the cockpit and tail rose over the 11attened fuselage, Anna Ridout of the aid agency World Vision said from the scene. Heseue workers carried about 20 bodies from the plane, many on stretchers, she said.

Investigators found a body in the rubble Tuesday morning, Pierce County sheriff's Detective Ed Troyer said. They believe they know the person's identity but did not release details. 
He said the couple who owned the house told authorities late Monday they had returned from a trip and found their tenant was acting strange­ly and making explosive devices. 
Troyer said the man was in the kitchen when deputies arrived. He quickly grabbed bottles and a duffel bag containing what the deputies recog­nized as components of explosive devices and ran upstairs, where he turned on loud music. 

Chicago colleue reopens after threat 
CHICAGO -St. Xavier University in Chicago is planning to reopen after being closed several days because of threatening graffiti. 
The Catholic school has been closed since Friday after graffiti was found in a restroom that read "be prepared to die on 4/14." Authorities found no evidence of a continuing threat to the school, though they say the investigation is con­tinuing.

TERRE HAUTE, Ind. -A joint state-county project will turn a 1,250-acre tra.ct of Wabash River flood plains into wetlands to create a magnet for wildlife and also control flooding. 
Gov. Mitch Daniels announced the project Tuesday before presenting Vigo County park officials with a $295,000 check that will go toward the county's land purchases for the Wabash River National Road Wetland Heservation. 
"This joint effort will conserve another beautiful habitat as well as enhance the quality of life for Hoosiers," Daniels said in a prepared statement. 
The land between Terre Haute and West Terre Haute will become a mix of shallow water marsh, wetlands, hardwood trees and native grasses that will eventually be turned into a park.

Officials estimate nearly 60 deaths in Baghdad's deadliest bombing in weeks 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -Bombings blamed on al-Qaida in Iraq tore through market areas in Baghdad and outside the capital on Tuesday, killing nearly 60 people and shat­tering weeks or relative calm in Sunni-dominated areas. 
The bloodshed -in four cities as far north as Mosul and as far west as Hamadi -struck directly at U.S. claims that the Sunni insur­gency is waning and being replaced by Shiite militia viol!mce as a major threat. 
The deadliest blasts took place in Baqouba and Ramadi, two cities where the U.S. military has claimed varying degrees of success in getting Sunnis to turn against al-Qaida. 
In Baqouba, the Diyala provincial capital 35 miles northeast of the capital, a parked car exploded about 
11:30 a.m. in front of a restaurant across the street from the central courthouse and other government offices. 
Many of the victims were on their way to the court, at the restaurant or in cars passing through the area. A man identifying himself as Abu Sarmad had just ordered lunch.

The idea evolved from the plan 
for a Midwest college council, but 
Student Union co-directors of 
external affairs Jeff Lakusta and 
Kathleen Donahue, who are 
organizing the project, said they 
decided to expand the group due 
to the small number of academi­
cally excellent schools in the 
area. 
"How many schools in the 
Midwest are there that are really 
up to our academic standards? 
Not many," Donahue said. 
The new group would be mod­eled off of the Ivy League's Ivy Council and could include school<; as diverse as Stanford, Vanderbilt, and Princeton, she said. 
Lakusta said he wants to begin 
organizing the group's inaugural 
meeting immediately because 
there isn't much time left in the 
school year. 
"We want to let schools know 
that we plan on doing this before 
the summer." Lakusta said. 
Donahue and Lakusta still have to lind willing participants, corpo­rate sponsorship and modes of transportation. 
"You need to turn into sales­men for the next couple of months and sell your soul to the project," Class of 2009 president Joey Brown said to Lakusta and Donahue. 
Many COR members expressed concerns over Notre Dame's abili­ty to attract other high profile col­leges to this new council when they will have to travel across the country. 
"Generating interest is a prob­lem," club coordination council president John Burke said. "Any west coast school like Stanford would be hard to get out here." 
Class of 2011 president Cynthia Weber said Lakusta and Donahue will need help organizing the event and that student govern­ment needs to be relentless in order to convince other schools to attend. 
"You're going to have to bn per­sistent," she said. "I know this sounds like a silly idea, but send their oflice a fruit basket from Notre Dame." 
Heish also suggestPd that the group should be for Catholic insti­tutions only, though several con members were critieal of this idea.

IN BRIEF Venezuela approves oil taxing law 
CARACAS, Venezuela -Venezuela moved Tuesday to take a greater cut of windfall oil prof­its, approving a 50 percent tax on foreign oil com­panies when crude tops US$70 a barrel. 
The tax rate would rise to 60 percent when the average monthly price for benchmark Brent crude exceeds US$100, according to the bill approved by Venezuela's National Assembly. The legislation will take effect as soon as it is published in the official gazette. 
Revenues from the tax could reach US$9 billion 

( 5.7 billion) annually, Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said after meeting with lawmakers. "That's why, for the executive branch, it is urgent to create this law," Ramirez said. 
The new legislation will let President Hugo Chavez further extend state control over foreign oil companies operating in Venezuela -home to the largest petroleum deposits in the Western Hemisphere -as he steers the nation toward what he calls "21st-century socialism." 
Analyst Juan Carlos Sosa, editor of the Venezuelan oil industry magazine PetroleoYV, said the measure "is going to force foreign companies to think twice about making new investments" in Venezuela, "because their opportunities to turn a profit are diminishing." 
Bush to propose climate change strategy 
WASHINGTON -President Bush, stepping into the debate over global warming, plans to announce on Wednesday a national goal for stop­ping the growth of greenhouse gas emissions over the next few decades. 
In a speech in the Rose Garden, Bush will lay out a strategy rather than a specific proposal for curbing emissions, White House press secretary Dana Perino said Tuesday. She did not disclose details of his announcement and would not say whether the president would propose any kind of mandatory cap on greenhouse gas emissions. 
The president wants every major economy, including fast-growing nations like China and India, to establish a national goal for cutting the emissions believed responsible for global warm­ing. 
In his remarks, Perino said, Bush will articulate a "realistic intermediate goal" for the United States.

Airlines face merger challenges 
Delta-Northwest merger could mean higher prices and fewer flight options 
Associated Press 
PHOENIX -Getting hitched may be the right move for Delta and Northwest. But for belea­guered air travelers, it could usher in an era of higher fares, fewer flights, more confusion at the airport and even more crowded planes. 
The merger could kick off a wave of airline consolida­tion. And while the effects would not be immediate because the combinations could take months to get regulatory approval, indus­try observers say get ready anyway for fewer carriers in the sky. 
"It's not an industry that works," said Mark Cooper, director of research for the Consumer Federation of America, who lobbied Congress against a bid by US Airways for Delta last year. 
"We're now getting to the point where there are so few carriers left, and they still can't make money," he said. 
Mergers, combined with a recent spate of airline bank­ruptcies, ·mean passengers in many cities can expect fewer flights to choose from, and they'll be packed even fuller than they are now. 
Greater demand for remaining seats translates into higher ticket prices. 
"There's no doubt in my mind fares are going to go up," said Rick Seaney, chief executive of FareCompare.com, which tracks changes in airline ticket prices. "Consumers are deluding themselves if they think that's not the case." 
Peter Schiff, president of brokerage firm Euro Pacific Capital, said the changes could put air travel out of reach for Americans of modest means.

WASHINGTON -Republicans on a congressional panel Tuesday said the Federal Communications Commission should re-auction a block of public air­waves to the highest bidder and turn the proceeds over to public safety pro­fessionals to fund a nationwide emer­gency communications network. 
The idea was raised as the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and the Internet heard testimony on why a plan aimed at using public airwaves and private money to create a nation­wide emergency communications net­work failed to attract any interest in an otherwise successful spectrum auction. 
Rep. Joe Barton of Texas, the rank­ing Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Rep. Cliff Stearns, ranking member of the subcommittee, both suggested the solution as an alternative to trying to fix the current plan. 
"With consensus, Congress could pass a law to use proceeds from the com­mercial re-auction for the public-pri­vate partnership," Barton said. 
The subcommittee heard from all five members of the Federal Communications Commission as well as key figures in the behind-the-scenes negotiations that failed to lead to an agreement to con­struct the wireless broadband network. 
The recently completed auction of a portion of the public airwaves, while raising a record $19.1 billion, failed to attract a bidder to build the network. 
Disasters like Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, revealed limitations of the nation's emergency communications networks, like the inability of police and firefighters to communicate with one another. 
Ideally, a new network would help solve the interoperability problem and avail emergency personnel of many of the advances in wireless technology that are available to commercial users. 

The FCC approved the emergency communications plan last summer. Under the plan, the FCC set aside about one-sixth of the recently auc­tioned airwaves. The "D block" would have been combined with a roughly equal portion of spectrum controlled by a public safety trust to create a shared network. 
The winning D block bidder, in exchange for use of the public safety spectrum, would build the network and make a profit by selling access to wireless service providers. But the block failed to attract a bidder. 
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell, D­Mich., said he was "presently unmoved" by suggestions that the block should be auctioned for "purely commercial use" and the proceeds handed to public safety. 
"At this moment, I consider such an approach to be an admission that we are not serious about attaining true interoperability," he said.

Financial death by government 
This is the last column for the Obserww that I will ever write. Seeing as how I often get e-mail'> suggesting that I eat babies and hate poor people, I can say with a reason­able amount of confidence that I probably 
just made your day. In 
mturn for making your day, I would like you to actually finish 
this column. ((}r it 
deals with the most 
important political issue facing the coun­try: the impending 
linancial demise of 

the us Federal  Mark Poyar  
Government.  
The nonpartisan  Bulletproof  
Congressional Budget  Ideas  
Office's 2007 "Long­ 

Term Budget Outlook" begins with tlli.s seemingly innocuous statement: "Signilicant uncertainty surrounds long­term fiseal projections, but under any plau­sible scenario, the federal budget is on an unsustainable path-that is, lederal debt will grow much faster than the economy over the long run." The last time I heard an understatement of this magnitude was when I told my friend that licking tl1e Backer pole "isn't a very good idea." 
The main reason for the coming fmancial meltdown of the US government will be its rising spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, particularly the last two. There are two major drivers of increased spending. First, costs per Medicare enrollee have increased 2.4 per­centage points faster than per capita GOP over the last 30 years, meaning the per­centage of GOP spent on health care will continue to increase. Secondly, the baby boomers are nearly eligible for Medicare which will dramatically increase Medicare and Social Security spending. Four months ago, the first baby boomers claimed Social Security benefits and they will be eligible for Medicare in less than three years. The proportion of the US population over 65 will grow from 12 percent to 19 percent by 2030, while the proportion of adults from 20 to 64 will fall from 60 percent to 56 per­cent. 
Currently, Medicaid and Medicare spend­ing accounts for 4.1 percent of US GOP and 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 

makes up about 20 percent of the federal budget. The CBO projects that this will increase to 12.5 pereent ofGDP in 2050 and 19 percent of GOP in 2082. 19 percent of GOP is roughly equivalent to the amount that the entire federal government will spend this year. Assuming that federal gov­ernment revenue maintains its historieal average of 20 percent ofGDP and discre­tionary spending maintains its average of just under 10 percent, there would be a deficit of 22.5 percent of GDP in 2050 and 
54.5 percent in 2082. To put this in per­spective, the US's current record setting deficit of about $400 billion is less than 3 percent of GOP. Interest payments alone on the national debt would consume 13.6 per­cent ofGDP by 2050. A vicious cyde would result in which the government would issue ever larger ammmts of debt to meet its ever higher interest paymenl'i. But what would large persistent deficits mean to the US economy? 
Consistent budget deficiL<; adversely affect the economy because they absorb the nation's savings and reduce capital investment, thus making US workers less productive. Heal wages, which typically lol­low productivity, would stagnate or fall. Capital would become scarce and interest rates would rise. The CBO estimates that the reduction in the capital stock would reduce real GNP in 2040 by 13 percent and 25 percent by 2050 compared to what it would have been. In short, the US would enter another Great Depression caused entirely by excess government spending. 
The CBO says that this bleak scenario probably understates the risk to economic growth because this model assumes people do not anticipate future changes in debt. Consequently, the United States' destruc­tion would unfold much quicker. If investors expected a crisis, they would pull their money out of US securities, causing the exchange rate of the dollar to plummet, interest rates to climb, and inflation to increase dramatically. The stock market would likely collapse amid the uncertainty, domestic spending would dry up, and the US's economic woes would spill over to the rest of the world just as it did in the last Great Depression. 
The CBO uses the term "fiscal gap" -a measure of federal shortfalls over a given period-to help assess the long-term fisntl challenge. The fiscal gap rnpresenl'i the amount of spending rnduction or tax increases needed to keep debt as a share of GDP at or below the currnnt ratio, essen­tially balancing the budget over a long peri­od of time. However, this measure does not take into account the adverse impact of higher taxes. If the fi~deral government wanted to close the fiscal gap today, it would need to reduce~ spending by 6.9 per­cent ofGDP immediately and permanently. This would be a 35 pereent permanent reduction in fi1deral spending. If the gov­ernment wail'> until 2020 or 2030 to close the gap, a decrease of 9 perennt or 11.5 percent of GDP would be~ necessary, respectively. 

These estimates do not even indude the possibility of expanding medieal eoverage to every American -it nwn~ly is an estimate of the fi.~deral government's currnnt obliga­tions. It is obvious that the li~deral govern­ment can't even meet these obligations; any talk of new obligations, whether in the form ofllillarycare, Obamaeare, or eontin­uing President Bush's $1 trillion prescrip­tion drug bill, is both naive and dangerous. The only debate should be about how to phase out these federal programs as they threaten to ruin America finaneially. 
This should not be a partisan question. Whetl1er or not you agree with the libertar­ian views I espouse, the faet remains that providing such care is fmandally impossi­ble. Certainly, the US could increase taxes dramatically to pay for such boondoggles, but even closing the current fiscal gap would require an 82.5 percent increase in individual income taxes. Such taxes would wreak economic havoc on the US economy. 
We have a choice: we can either be equally poor and miserable, or we could let people keep their own money and make their own choices. I choose the latter and so should you.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The spirit of The Holocaust lives 
This article is written in response to Florian Plocek's letter ("Abortion not a Holocaust," Apr. 1). This past Saturday, Alice von Hildebrand spoke at Notre Dame's Annual Right to Life conference. Mrs. von Hildebrand is the wife of the late Dietrich von Hildebrand, a famed German Catholic intellectual and philosopher who was once informally named by Pope Pius XII as "the 20th Century Doctor of the Church." 
Pertinent to this discussion. Dietrich von Hildebrand lived during Hitler's rise to power in Europe and was forced to flee from Germany to Austria for voicing stark public oppo­sition to the Nazi regime. In Austria, he founded an anti-Nazi weekly paper, Der Ch~istliche Stiindestaat (The Christian corporative state), for which he was sentenced to death in absentia by the Nazi regime. As Hitler's reign of terror spread, he was forced to flee from Austira to Switzerland, before moving to France, from where he was again forced to flee to Portugal, then Brazil, before arriving in the United States in 1940. 
In 1976, a few months before the end of his life, Dietrich von Hildebrand said to his wife: "Hitler won the war." Taken aback by such a stark statement, Alice pressed him as to his meaning. Dietrich contin­ued, "Hitler lost the war militarily, of cbi.lrse. But his·soctal ideologies of ­abortion and euthanasia, as well as his general disrespect for the sancti­ty of human life, survived in Germany after World War II and have spread across the world ever since. His understanding of the nature of man was victorious in the Great War." 
It is of utmost importance to remember the great scourge of the Holocaust in our human history as a uniquely horrible event, but, as von Hildebrand makes clear, it is a false judgment to assume that Hitler's ide­ologies died in 1945. The social poli­cy articulated by Hitler in his 1942 policy statement on abortion of the Slavic people bear stark similarities to the writings of Margaret Sanger and even the abortion policies in place today. 
Fundamentally, it is the same dis­respect for human life that continues to kill the unborn. In this sense, it is very appropriate to call abortion a holocaust, as allying it to that from which it was proliferated enables all to see the evil of its ways and per­haps, in the name of those who died in the extermination camps, save those who are still dying in our abor­tion clinics.

''Holocaust'' not the same as ''holocaust'' 
In response to ("Abortion not a Holocaust," Apr. 15), I would like to point out that the word "holocaust" can be used to describe any mass killing or destruction. Only when capi­talized does it specifically refer to the events of World War II. In no way is the killing of six million Jews under the Nazi regime trivialized when the word is used to describe abortion. 
The students and faculty of Notre Dame are not ignorant of world histo­ry during the 1940s, they simply know that the Holocaust is not the only holocaust. Since holocaust has been mostly used to describe the slaughter of the Jews, it is not appro­priate to use it too loosely because it now carries the connotation of death and destruction on an epic scale. Pro­lifers believe that abortion is the killing of innocent defenseless life in its most fragile stage, and for this rea­son I think it is still entirely appropri­ate that they use the word holocaust to describe the millions of lives that they believe have been lost to abor­tion.

An embarrassment to education 

Wow. It is a bi-monthly pleasure to get a laugh out of Mr. Yatarola's column ("Let's talk about alcohol, baby" Apr. 15) and to talk with my classmates about how poorly thought out his opinions generally seem to be, but today's column really is preposterous: ''I'm not sug­gesting it's good to go through high school drunk. But better high school than college ... High school's largely a waste anyway, needlessly long and hardly challenging (I say this as a high school teacher)." 
That is embarrassing for the University and embarrassing for the education system. God help him if this paragraph gets brought up at parent-teacher conferences. I would hope any teacher worth their certificate wouldn't hold opinions like this. Maybe the education sys­tem in this country wouldn't be "a waste" if people like Mr. Yatarola were kept out of the classroom and off of the editorial page.

University's mission is to educate, not indoctrinate 
As a lifelong practicing Catholic, a Notre Dame alumnus and the parent of a current Notre Dame student and quite likely another one come September, I am, frankly, troubled by the con­tinuing controversy over The Vagina Monologues as played out in this paper, and more recently, on the pages of The Wall Street Journal. 
If the University was to ban that play, is it next to ban all films that convey a message that could be deemed inconsistent with Church teachings? Is it to scour the library and purge it of all books that could be similarly construed? It seems that the vocal opponents of The Vagina Monologues are advocating a kind of modern day bonfire of the vanities. I did not send my kids to Notre Dame to be inculcated in the faith. That has been my job and my wife's for the past 18 years. I sent them to Notre Dame to receive an education both within the classroom and with­out. Ifthat education is to serve them once they enter the wide world, then it must include expo­sure to all manner of thought, even those with which I and the Church might strongly disagree. 
If I have done my job, if the seeds of faith have been properly sewn and cultivated, then that faith will stay rooted even when exposed to competing ideas. If I have not, then no amount of censorship, for that is what we are talking about here, will keep that faith from withering. I applaud Fr. Jenkins for his courageous stand on this issue.

Abortion and The Holocaust 
In his April15letter to the editor ("Abortion not a Holocaust," Apr. 15) Florian Plocek objected 
to the use of the term "holocaust" in reference to abortion in the United States. I am quite famil­
iar with the phenomenon by which modern Germans, and as an odd vestige of the Anschluss, . Austrians, ofall ages feel compelled to express guilt over sins committed half a century ago by 
other people. But this does not make Mr. Plocek's specific protestations any less absurd. 
In all fairness, several of Mr. Plocek's statements are correct: Legal abortion is not the result of 
centuries-old animosity towards Jews that resulted in the industrialized extermination of Jews 
throughout Europe. Rather, it is the result of centuries-old Enlightenment animosities that have 
resulted in the lucrative industrialized extermination of 48 million people in the last thirty-five 
years (the nation's leading abortion provider grossed over $1 billion in 2007). 
Again, Mr. Plocek is correct in saying abortion (an act) is not comparable to the gas chambers 
(a place), if for no other reason than by virtue ofthe old "apples and oranges" maxim. But when 
you compare the end result of the two (dead people), that difficulty resolves itself. Mr. Plocek's 
further statement, "the Holocaust is not comparable to any other event in human history," 
almost defies categorization. Perhaps it simply reflects an ignorance of the fact that mass mur­
der is neither a unique nor a new event in human history (e.g. Stalin killing over 20 million peo­
ple). The Nazis have no monopoly on evil and the Germans no monopoly on responsibility. So the 
Nazi murder of 12 million Jews and other people, while horrible, hardly rises to the level of 
being beyond comparison. 

American law enshrines the right to kill unborn children as a fundamental liberty and an 
~trinsic element of the American dream. Mr. Plocek objects to our referring to referring to abor­
tion as a holocaust because he knows the scars Europe still bears from Nazism. He should thus 
at least be sensitive to the similar wounds, not yet closed over, that abortion has left in American 
society. The Nazis killed millions who thought they were safe in their homes and communities. 
We continue to kill millions who ought to be safe in a place far more sacrosanct: the womb. So 
people will continue to refer to abortion as the holocaust of our time because we know all too 
well that John Paul II was correct: "A nation that kills its own childi-en is a nation without hope."

Review: E=MC2 a Winning Equation 
By CHRIS HINE 
Scene Writer 
In 2005, Mariah Carey released "The Emancipation of Mimi, which gamemd three Grammy awards and became the biggf1St-selling album of 2005, with 5.8 million copies sold. 
Even though it included the classic hit "We Belong Together," most of"Mimi" was hit or miss, with some bona fide club-hangers and striking ballads, but still others that missed the mark. 
On Carey's long-anticipa~.follow-up, E=MC2, she stuck close to the formula that made "Mimi" such a success -a mixture up-tempo H&B and catchy mid-tempo ballads ­but this time around, she's made an album that is listen­able 1:r.:om beginning to end. 
The album opens with a song destined to invade the air­waves this summer. "Migrate" (with T-Pain) features a bouncing beat and a chorus that'll be stuck in your head for days. Though the lyrics are nothing more than an ode to partying, the melody is infectious and Carey's voice pro­vides enough sultriness to make it a runaway hit. 
The next two tracks, "Touch My Body" (Carey's 18th Billboard 'No. 1' hit) "Cruise Control," continue the run of pleasant, upbeat tunes, though the album picks up steam with track four, "I Stay in Love." 
"I Stay in Love" is this album's "We Belong Together." It's a g<~rgeous mid-tempo ballad that features an outstanding performance from Carey. The theme is a common one in Carey's songs, not being able to let go of a former lover, but few times before has she sung about it with this much heartbreak. 
On "I Stay in Love," Carey continues a trend she began with "We Belong Together." No longer is she singing the majority of her songs in her upper register. Rather, she sings in a lower key, and in a full voice. 
Melodieally, Carey is singing more words per measure, and it's a good thing. It requires Carey to cut down on her melismatic singing, for which she has been widely, and rightfully, criticiZf1d in the past. Basically, the technique of melisma means the singer ha.; a tendency to turn one note into five and fluctuate his voice up and down the scale dra­matieally. The efl'ect is an annoying warbling sound that exprnsses little emotion. Since she's singing more words per mea.-;un>,., she has no time for melisma if she's going to sing all the words. · 
On E=MC2, Carey has cut down on the melisma and eonvnys more emotion using the lower portion of her voice. This is-evident on the songs Carey wrote with 
Jermaine Dupri, who collaborated with Carey on a num­~er of songs in the past, including "We Belong Together," Always Be My Baby," and "Shake it Off." 
"Love Story," "Thanks for Nothing," and "Last Kiss," provide this album's best melodies and strongest vocals for Carey. 
But the high point of the disc is the Young Jeezy collabo­ration, "Side Effects." With lyrics such as "It didn't stop I no one was there I couldn't be real I had to keep quiet I once in a while I put up a fight I but it's just too much I night. after night," Carey gives her audience an in-depth look mto her former marriage with music mogul Tommy Mottolla, who helped launch her career in the early 1990s. 
Never has Carey put out such a confessional and moving record that also easily applies to any repressive or dam­aged relationship. With this song, Carey is able to pull off a tough accomplishment for any singer, make a song of high quality that is both universal and deeply personal. 
~arey closes the set the same way she closed "Mimi," With a gospel-tinged vocal acrobatic exercise. "I Wish You Well" contains Bible quotes and a choir and Carey shows that even though her voice has deteriorated over the years, she still has plenty of power to rise above the hun­dreds of American Idol contestants who aspire to be her. 
It's too bad Carey's label decided to release the worst song on the album, "Bye Bye" as the second single. The song is about death and is as sappy as a musical Hallmark card. Don't be fooled when you hear it on the radio or see Carey performing it in the coming weeks, because aside from that song, Carey has made one of the best pop!R&B records of the past year.

NEW YORK -Rachel Robinson walked past cheering construction work­ers and into the Jackie Robinson Rotunda for the first'time, stood on a bal­cony above the 160-foot wide floor and was awed as she gazed at the 70-foot high arches. 
"It's like walking into a cathedral in a way," she said. "I love St. Peter's in Rome, but I don't know if I can compare this to St. Peter's." 
On the 61st anniversary of the day her husband broke major league base­ball's color barrier, more than 330 players, managers and coaches -including nine entire teams -wore Jackie Robinson's No. 42 to celebrate the Hall of Farner's accomplishments. The center of the celebra· tion was at Citi Field, the New York Mets' $800 mil­lion ballpark under con­struction adjacent to Shea Stadium. 
The Mets unveiled designs for the rotunda, which will contain eight huge pictures of Robinson and have an 8-foot statue of his number in Dodger blue. It will be the central entrance for the ballpark, which opens in 2009, and the Mets estimate 30,000 fans per game will pass through. 

"People will say: Til meet you at 42.' Everybody will know where that is," Mets owner Fred Wilpon said, lovingly putting his hand on the back of Rachel Robinson, still spry at age 85. 
BU:t even as her husband's legacy was being memorial­ized in stone, brick and ter­razzo, a study was released that said blacks made up only 8.2 percent of major league players last year, down from 8.4 percent in 2006 and the lowest level in more than two decades. The figure was 19 percent as recently as 1995 accord­ing to Richard Lapchick of the University of Central Florida's Institute for

''I'm very disappointed by that fact," Robinson said. "Competition from other sports is certainly a big fac­tor but there are many fac­tors. We've got to work on it in terms of getting younger children playing, into the game, and getting commu­nities behind the pro­grams."

IN BRIEF Thome fined for actions, sus­
pended for one game 
NEW YORK -Jim Thome of the Chicago White Sox was suspended for one game Tuesday and fined an undisclosed sum by Major League Baseball for "inappropri­ate actions" during a game against Detroit last week. He was ejected for arguing a call after he struck out. 
Thome said he would not appeal and would serve his suspension Tuesday, when the White Sox were home against Oakland. He said he was due for a day off anyway. 
"You get caught up in the situa­tion, emotions. No grudges, you move on," Thome said in the club­house before the game against the A's. 
Thome was ejected in the fifth inning last Friday following a third-strike call by plate umpire James Hoye. Replays showed the 3-2 pitch borderline low. 
Jones seeks trade, holds 
off on application 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -Suspended Tennessee Titans cornerback Pacman Jones said Tuesday he's delayed filing for reinstatement with the NFL until a possible trade is worked out. 
Jones told the Michael Irvin Show on ESPN Radio that he had planned to seek reinstatement but changed his mind for now. 
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Jones for the 2007 season for his off-field conduct, which includes six arrests since being draft­ed. Goodell rejected appeals to let Jones take part in training camp or return after 10 games. 
The suspension does not stop the Titans from trading Jones' contract. 
"I was going to file for reinstate­ment, but I didn't," Jones said. "I want the situation to work out, if it be a trade or if it don't be a trade and I go back to Tennessee, before I file for reinstatement with the commissioner. 

Freshman Rose leaves 
Memphis, declares for Draft 
MEMPHIS, Tenn. -Memphis freshman Derrick Rose announced he was jumping to the NBA Tuesday, the same day coach John Calipari agreed in principle to a contract extension with the school. 
Rose capped his spectacular first season by leading Memphis to the national championship game, where they lost to Kansas in over­time. 
The 6-foot-3 guard from Chicago averaged 20.8 points in six NCAA tournament games and will likely be taken with one of the top picks in the draft. · 
Terms of Calipari's deal have not been finalized. 
Rose, who helped Memphis to an NCAA Division I record 38 victo­ries last season, said he enjoyed his year in college but is ready to make the leap to the NBA.

Danks earns first vvin in 12 starts for White Sox 
Angels rally to beat struggling Rangers 
Associated Press 
CIIICAGO -Given how much time had passod, it figured that John Danks would have trouble romembering his previous win. 
"I think it was in June some­time," he said. Almost. Mid-July was the cor­reel answer. 
Danks celebrated his 23rd birthday with his first win in 12 starts, taking a shutout into the eighth inning to lead the Chicago White Sox past the Oakland Athletics 4-1 Tuesday lor a two­game split. 
Chicago just missed its third shutout in four games, and this performance carne against a team that entered with the American Loague's best record. The Athletics won six of their first seven on this eight-game road trip, but thny couldn't touch Danks artor beating Mark Buehrle 2-1 on Monday.

What he had. though, was a big improvement over his previous outing. when he got knocked out in the third against Minnesota. "You know, last year if I felt like I did today I probably would­n't have made it out of the third or fourth inning," Danks said. "I would have tried to overthrow. Today I dido 't feel like I had the best stuff I've had but I just kind of went out there with the best stun· I had and kind of went on from there. I don't know. I feel like I'm taking those steps for­ward and growing." Bobby Jenks came on with runners at first and third in the ninth after Scott Linebrink walked Daric Barton and allowed a single to Mike Sweeney. Jenks threw two pitch­es, resulting in a sacrifice fly for Emil Brown and double-play grounder by Bobby Crosby, for his firth save in five opportuni­ties. Oakland's Dana Eveland (1-1) had a tough time gripping the ball on a dry but windy after­noon, allowing four runs -three earned -in 4 2-3 innings. He walked thren, struck out two and hit two battnrs with pitches after allowing a total of one run in his lirst two starts against Cleveland and Toronto. "I started trying to Ioree it and started to lose my mechanics because of it," Eveland said. "I started flying open a bit and drifting. I just got out of whaek and could never really get back on traek after that long fourth inning." Eveland startnd having control problems when he plunked Nick Swisher in the right shin with two outs in the third, threw a wild pitch and walked Orlando Cabrera before getting out of trouble. Eveland then hit Paul Konerko leading off the fourth and walked Joe Crede before ()uentin, in a 2-for-17 skid,

Angels 7, Rangers 4 
Gary Matthews Jr. snapped out of a slump with a tiebreaking, three-run double, and the Los Angelns Angels rallied to beat Texas Tuesday as the Rangers ended their lirst homestand of the season with their fifth straight loss. 
Matthews was in a 3-l'or-27 
slide before his double to left­
center in the sixth inning off 
Josh Rupe (0-1) broke a 4-all tie. 
Rupe took over to start the sixth for Kevin Millwood , who left after 70 pitches due to a bruised left shin sustained when he was hit by a batted ball in the second. The Rangers said Millwood came out because his leg started to stiffen up on him. The problem didn't appear to be serious. 
Rupe walked two batters and allowed a single, with a sacrifice bunt in between, before Matthews cleared the bases. 
Darren Oliver (1-0). like Matthews a former Ranger, threw 2 2-3 scoreless innings in relief of starter Dustin Moseley . Francisco Rodriguez worked the ninth, overcoming two walks for his lifth save in six chances. 
There was no indication that Millwood was hurt after a ball hit by Maicer Izturis ricocheted off the pitcher's left leg and rolled to first base, where Ben Broussard picked it up and tagged the bag for an easy out. Millwood was even smiling when manager Ron Washington came out to check on him. 
Millwood was also hit on the throwing hand by a batted ball, when he reached up attempting to grab a ball in the fourth that turned into a groundout. That play came between a single by Garrett Anderson and Casey Kotchman 's two-run homer. 
Millwood then snagged anoth­er comebacker by Izturis for an out before allowing three straight singles, the last by Chone Figgins driving in a run. Vladimir Guerrero and Anderson had consecutive dou­bles in the fifth to tie the game at 4. 
The Hangers finished their first homestand 2-6, sweeping a dou­bleheader from Baltimore for their only victories. They were swept in a three-game set by Toronto and lost both games in the short set against the Angels, who dropped two of three to Texas in their first homestand.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
IU's Senderoff hired at Kent St. 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND Rob Senderoff can't change his past or what happened at Indiana. He's only looking forward. 
Senderoff, involved in a phone-call scandal that led to Kelvin Sampson's resignation and NCAA scrutiny at Indiana, was hired Tuesday as an assistant at Kent State, returning to the school where he spent four years before joining Sampson's staff. 
"I couldn't be happier to be back," Senderoff said. 
Last October, Senderoff resigned from his job with the Hoosiers amid a universi­ty investigation that he broke NCAA rules by making illegal phone calls to recruits. The investigation led to Sampson accepting a $750,000 buyout in February. 
Months after Senderoff stepped down voluntarily at Indiana, an NCAA report said Sampson and he knowingly participated in three-way calls with at least three recruits. The report said Senderoff initiated those calls. 
The Feb. 8 NCAA report accused Senderoff of provid­ing "false or misleading infor­mation" to the NCAA and fail­ing to abide by its expected ethical standards for honesty. 
"I've learned a lot from my mistakes," Senderoff said, "and I'm looking forward to mo~ing on to the next chap­ter. 
Indiana will have a hearing in front of the NCAA's infrac­tions committee in June, and Senderoff said he will take part. Sampson and IU offi­cials will also be present. 
"I hope it closes the book on it," he said. "Whatever the NCAA says, I will follow. I was here (at Kent State) for four years and I never had a problem and always abided by the NCAA rules compli­ance.... I'm not going to say I didn't do anything wrong. I've learned from my mis­takes." 
Last season was the first time in 13 years that Senderoff wasn't coaching. He missed it terribly, and is looking forward to being back in the gym and on the bench. 
Senderoff previously worked at Kent State from 2002-06, when he was hired by Sampson. He'll be an assistant under Geno Ford, who recently took over the Golden Flashes after Jim Christian left for TCU. Ford and Senderoff worked on Christian's staff together. 
Kent State athletic director Laing Kennedy said Senderoff will be involved in recruiting and is under no restrictions. Kennedy said he and Kent State officials reviewed Senderoff's past before decid­ing to bring him back to the Mid-American Conference school. 
"We wouldn't have moved forward if we didn't feel good about it," Kennedy said. "Rob is an excellent coach and we're excited about what this will mean for our student athletes." 
Senderoff was grateful for the chance to restart his coaching career. 
''I'm coming back to a place where everybody knows who I am," he said. "I can't wait to get started and to work with Geno again." 
Kent State has become one of college basketball's elite mid-major programs in the past decade. The school has posted 10 consecutive 20-win seasons and has made the NCAA tournament field four times since 2000. 
Senderoff began his coach­ing career at Albany before becoming a graduate assis­tant at Miami of Ohio from 1995-97. He also worked at Fordham, Yale and Towson before coming to Kent State.

Belles stay hot in

wtn over Bethel 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's (7-9) grabbed its seventh win of the season yes­terday, 7-2 at home against cross-town rival Bethel College (10-5). 
"It's always nice to beat a cross-town rival," Belles coach Chuck Rubino said. "We played excellent doubles, which really got us going. And in singles, Laura [Arnold] made a nice comeback after losing her first match and winning the tie­breaker." 
The Belles kept up the momentum from their 8-1 win over Tri-State this past weekend as they swept the doubles divi­sion. Leading Saint Mary's was the No. 1 duo of sophomore co­captain Camille Gebert and freshman Jillian Hurley, who defeated Bethel's Bree Oles and Jade Walus 8-2. Gebert and Hurley move their record to 8-8, 4-1 MIAA. No. 2 pair of sopho­more co-captain Lisa Rubino and freshman Betsy Reed made up for their loss this past week­end as they defeated Sherra Milender and Lindsey Dixon 8-3, putting them at 6-8 as a pair. At No. 3 doubles were freshmen Jessica Camp and Franca Peluso, winning 8-5 over Carrie Edison and Serena Frey for their second match as a pair, moving them to 1-1. 
"Our doubles were really strong today," Hurley said. 
"They have improved a lot over the course of the season." 
Saint Mary's strength contin­ued in its singles matches as the team won four of the six match­es. No. 1 Gebert defeated Oles 6­0 in one match before Oles dropped out of competition for the day. Gebert moves her record to 8-8. No. 2 Hurley won her fourteenth match of the sea­son in her 6-0, 6-2 defeat of Walus, putting her at 14-2. At No. 3 singles, Reed lost 6-1, 6-2 to Edison, moving her to 7-8. No. 4 Jessica Kosinski was defeated as well for Saint Mary's, losing 7-6, 6-1 to Milender, putting her at 6-9. No. 5 Rubino beat Julia Horn 6-4, 6-2 for her seventh victory of the season, moving her to 7-8. Freshman Laura Arnold won at No. 6 singles over Frey in a 10-8 tie-breaking third match after losing the first match 6-2 and winning the sec­ond 6-2. 
"I think this win will boost our confidence for the upcoming matches," Hurley said. "We're playing really competitive teams, 

-
and this win will help." 
Rubino outlined the goal for his team's next matches very simply. 
"We need to keep our momen­tum going," she said. 
Next up for Saint Mary's is a home match against conference foe Adrian at 3:00 p.m. Thursday.

ForgivP tho Irish if thny nxpnrinnen a hit ol' (l«',jil vu. 
At this tirnn last season, Notrn Damn was sporting a 10­:~ rncord. a spot in tlw national rankings and was corning ofT of a win ovnr No. 9 (;norgdown. But a loss to Vandnrbilt in their rwxt gamn was thn beginning of the end for thn Irish. eoaeh Traey Coyne said. 
"That was thn bnginning of the three-game slide for us last year," Coyne said. "We went to Vanderbilt and lost. They worn really tired up for the game." 
-
Fast forward to this season, as the Irish (10-4, 3-1 Big East) eurrently hold the No. 10 spot in the national polls. They are coming off of a win over Georgetown, this first in the program's history in Washington, D.C., and the 
same Vanderbilt team stands in their way this year. This time, Coyne thinks her team has the maknup to defeat the Commodores. 
"It is really an important game," Coyne said. "Our goal is not otT in the distanee, it is
-right there. I think that we are really foeused, especially after the disappointment of last year. We are in the cxaet same situation we were in last sea­son, exeept now we have the knowledge of what we did last year." Coyne has said all season that the tnam's goal is to win 
the Big East eonfnrenen and rnakn a run toward thn nation­al c~harnpionship. ;\ win on Wndnnsday would go a long way toward those goals. 
Thn Irish eo me into Wodnnsday's game riding a wave of rnomnntum. AJ'ter falling to No. I Northwestnrn last Wednesday, 16-2, the Irish rlosnd out their five-game road trip at Georgetown, a plaee where thn Irish had never won in .Program history. Thanks to a great team performance, the Irish wcwe able to break their strnak and notch a historie 1O­S win. The win dosed out the road trip which saw the Irish go 4-1 and beat two top-1 0 teams. Coyne was quiek to mention the defense as a rea­son for the suecess. 
"I think the defensive unit gave huge performances in the big wins at Duke and Georgetown," Coyne said. "We have relied on the attaek in other games, but the defense really set themselves apart on the road trip." 
The stellar play of the defense is a welcomed sign for the Irish, who relied on their potent offense earlier in the season, but now seem to be coming together for the streteh run. Also important was the atmosphere in whieh the game was played, one which Coyne ealled a "ehampionship atmos­phere." 
The Irish will take on the Commodores at home on Wednesday at 4:30p.m.

The second half opened with three straight buckets from The Knight'>, who were on their way to dominating the last 20 minutes of the game. Shot<> from senior cap­tain Milo Dodson were key in the vietory. 
"The wind played a good factor in [our shot<>), but we kind of just had to adjust our game to take lay-ups as opposed to just taking jumpers," Dodson said. "We also got offensive rebounds and put­backs by [senior) Nate [Prochaska[. He defmitely carried us down-low as well as [senior] Leo IFerrine) getting easy lay-ups and just playing physical." 
The Knights' defensfl was also integral to thPir win. 
"First, [The Dark Knight<> ... and Nato[ were in a zone [in thP first halfl. and so we were able to get more open looks," said captain Mike Crocker, a computer engi­neering graduate student of the Engineering Giants. "Then they switched to man-to-man, and they play a tough man-to-man. That was probably the biggest differ­ence ~ that, and in the second half, we just did not shoot as well." 
Crocker said the reason for his toam's loss was simple. 
"We had to play very well to win, and we didn't play as well as we needed to," he said. 
No. 10 The Delivery Boys 2l., No. 23 Muhammad All Enterprises 8 
Freshman David Hudy put up 10 b<L<>kets for The Delivery Boys in a dominating victory over Muhammad Ali Enterprises. The Delivery Boys scored quickly on · the fast break and were never down in a match-up that L<> certain to go down as one of the fastnst games played in the round of 32.

"We need to work on our dunk­ing, but I think we'll have a lot tougher competition coming up," junior captain Kevin Kelly of The Delivery Boys said. 
"We didn't condition too much in any of our practices," Muhammad Ali Enterprises cap­tain Kevin Washington said. "We had about two of them, and they consisted of NCAA [Basketball video games]. We were practicing on game sticks. Those plays didn't work out too well for us. The other team just ran up and down the court, and we couldn't hang with them." 
No. 1.1. Mathletes 21, No. 22 I Can't Believe We're So Butter...SPRAY! 14 
This contest started off on a slow pace as baskets were not dropping for either team until the Mathletes exploded from a 3-2 score to an 11-4 halftime lead. 
"In the first half, we were get­ting good looks, and we just could­n't convert," I Can't Believe We're So Butter ... SPRAY! eaptain Hick Loesing said. "They were using their athleticism, and they were pushing the ball on us pretty well. We were playing good defense, but they were converting on their shot<>. We just couldn't hit ours." 
The No. 22 seed came out of halftime poisPd to make a come­back. At first, it seemed like the Mathletes could not put I Can't Believe We're So Butter ... SPRAY! away in a game that got immedi­ately more competitive. Loesing and junior Pete Leonard buried some nice jumpers from the back­court, and senior Fritz Shadley playp,d well on the inside. 

But it was too little, too late as the teams were trading buckets down the stretch. 
"They were a rp,ally good team -definitely our closest game yet," Mathletes captain Peter Kelly said. "We're just really a strong group. We complement each other pretty well. Camouflage was tough to see, but I caught him sometimes." 
Loesing was resigned about the loss. 
"We started getting warmPd up at the end of the first half, and then we started feeling good in tl1e second half," Loesing said. "We kept getting open looks, and we just starting converting. [However], at that point, it was too late. They were still shooting well, and by that time, it was over."

The Irish (22-IJ-1, 10-2 Big East) made it nino in a row and 15 of thnir last 1 7 with a 6-1 win over tlw Toledo Hoekets Tuesday at Frank Erk Stadium. 
When asked about the mood in the clubhouse during the win­ning streak, Irish coach Dave Schrage played with the supm·­stitious stigma embedded within baseball.

"Shhhh," he joked, mockirig the mention of the winning so his players wouldn't hear him. "We're just a eonl'ident group right now. We really arc. We're

Notre Dame to take on Northern Illinois at U.S. Cellular Field for charity 
By FRAN TOLAN Associate Sports Editor 

On Feb. 14, the latest in a series of shootings on college campuses occurred at Northern Illinois. A gunman opened l'ire in a full classroom and six of the 22 stu­dents shot in the incident died. 
Notre Dame will face off against Northern Illinois tonight at U.S. Cellular Field, home of the Chicago White Sox, in a benefit for the NIU February 14 Scholarship Fund. The foundation will distribute scholarships to deserving students in the name of the victims of the shooting. 
So what, one might ask, can a baseball game played two months after such a tragedy do to help heal the still-raw wounds of those involved? 
A lot, according to Northern Illinois coach Ed Mathey. "The hook about baseball is it
