VOL. IV, NO. 81 Serving the Notre Dame. and Saint M_ary ·.~ College r'ommunity 
SLC OK's parietal recommendation 
b.y Uill Carter 
The Student Life Council last 
night passed a resolution calling 
for the individual determination 
of parietal hour procedure by 
eac!I residence hall after consul­
tation with, and the approval of, 
the llall Life Board. 
The resolution, however, will 
not become university policy un­
less it is approved by the Board 
of Trustees. It will be considered 
at their meeting on March 21. 
The Council's discussion of 
the parietal question had been 
extended over numerous meet­
ings. When last night's meeting 
opened, Fr. Edgar Whelan repre­
senting the Hall Life Board 
asked that the matter be im­
mediately settled. "The timehas 
come for the Council to vote on 
the resolution before it." Whelan 
sa~d "Continuing the debate ad 
nauseam is not going to help." 
The meeting last week had 
ended with the resolution failing 
to secure the necessary two-
thirds vote required to bring the 
motion to a formal vote. 
Fr. Charles McCarragher, Vice 
President for Student Affairs, 
passed out a five page rationale 
discussing the administration's 
opposition to the Life Board's 
m o lion. McCarragher's state­
ment expressed the concern that the resolution would pave the way for complete Hall Auto­nomy which the administration opposed on the grounus that some university-wide regulations must be retained in order to preserve the "cohesion of the student body." 
He argued that the request for allowing each hall to determine · its own hours after negotiating with the Hall Life Board failed to take into account the fact thut there were areas of common concern to students on campus

effect on their own. 

The Chair then noted that the 
discussion would come under 
the third part of the resolution 
which explicitly stated what the 
hall life board's role would be in 
finalizing each hall's plans. 

A vote was then taken on the 
part of the resolution which 
granted the halls the right ot 
decide on their own hours. It 
passed I0 to 6. 

The Council then continued 
debate on whether or not the 
report on off-campus housing to members of SMC Student Affairs 
Hall Life Board or the SLC would have the final say over whether or not a hall was grant­ed the parietal hours that it sought. The Council passed an amendment by Professor Houck which gave the Hall Life Board final authority to approve each hall's changes but which also granted the SLC the right to review the action.  
The question then arose again over whether or not the plan could go into effect immediately or would have to be approved by the Board of Trustees.SLC Chairman Professor Massey ruled that the Trustees would have to approve the plan before it went into effect. 
McKenna challenged the chair's ruling stating that the proposal should go into effect immediately. The Council sup­ported Massey's ruling though 10 to 6.

where members of the opposite sex reside. Many of the other proposals in her report paralleled those in Miss Cusick's. 
Two major topics ot discus­sion which followed the reading of the reports were room and board scholarships, and the change in St. Mary's from a residential college to a more urban commuter school. Sr. Alma, asked about the college picking up the tab for scholar­ship students living off-campus. This was discussed in the light of dis..:rimination against stijdents who couldn't afford to live off­

campus and lose their scholar­ships by doing so. The second discussion concerning the change in the residential complexion of St. Mary's, and the resulting loss of community was disputed by Miss Cusick. "What is gained," 
she stated, "in having people off ca.mpus, is more diversity, more freedc;>m, and an exposure to realities." 
The entire issue of off-campus housing arose from the expan­sion of St. Mary's, and the lack of room space due to the expan­sion. There was discussion of moving more beds into LeMans Hall and making forced triples · out of doubles where possible. This proposed bill would allevi­ate the problem of room space, and allow those students desiring to move from the dorms to do so. 
The proposal, accepted by consensus of the Committee, will be presented to a meeting of the Executive Committee of Trustees March 14. A survey will be passed out to the students before then asking their reac­tions to the proposal. 
Tunisian talk given 

Under the joint sponsorship of the ASC/ AlA (Architecture Club) and the U.S. Peace Corps, Royce LaNier, a former volun­teer architect-planner in Tunisia, will give two multi-media presen­tations on Wednesday, February 25 in the Architecture Building Auditorium (Room 202). 
At 3:30p.m., Mr. LaNier will present "Tunisia" -An analysis of the effects" of climate, ma­terials and cultural patterns on traditional architectural form and spatial organization. 
At 7:30 in the evening, a· nother presentation will be given entitled "Between Two Worlds". This is described as a survey of the physical, economic and cul­tural environment of Afghanis­tan. It also portrays the life styles and job situations of Peace Corps volunteers in the cities and villages of Afghanistan. Both presentations will be followed by discussions and open to ques­tions. 
Mr. LaNier received his Bache­lor of Architecture degree from the University of Texas in Aus­tin and has studied city planning at Chalmer's Institute in Sweden before serving for two years in the Peace Corps. Since returning to the U.S. in 1967, he has

Fro sh Senate plans activities·; Schedule includes m1n1-m1xers 
by Ann Therese Darin 
SMC's Freshman Class Senate proposed plans last week for a number of social activities this 
semester. 
Subject to ratification by stu­dents, the Senate's list of acti­vities includes "mini-inixers," a scavenger hunt, and a prom. 
Tentatively scheduled for the first two weeks of March, the "mini-mixer" plan will be an opportunity for groups of five ND and five SMC freshmen to 
meet informally with a freshma'n 
senator from each school in a 
social atmosphere. 
"The purpose of the mini­mixers is just to have more boys meet more girls and vice versa," explained Anne P. Ryan, fresh­man class vice-president. 

"We hope it will foster better relations between the two schools in an enjoyable, relaxing way," she said. 
Similar to the "mini-mixers " the scavenger hunt, schedul~d for April I 0, will be organized in

Szalay rebukes Dr. Spock 
by Cliff Wintrode 
Observer Associate Editor 
Mr. Joseph Szalay; chairman of the Support the President for Peace Movement in South Bend, yesterday rebuked the "anti-American" views of Dr. Ben­jamin Spock and offered his own evaluation of the state of the union. 
Mr. Szalay is a familiar figure at any speech or discussion of the left on campus or in South Bend, and he was a speaker at the Vietnam moratorium events held on campus last October 15th. 
Mr. Szalay is also the head of the South Bend Hungarian Free­dom Fighters. He lived for twelve years under communist rule in Hungary and escaped to this eoun try after Russia squashed the Hungarian Revolu­tion of 1956. His father was 
groups with a senator !rom each 
school as advisor. 
"The joint social commission 
will divide the list of objects to 
be collected among the groups," 
commented Lolo Stankus, presi­dent. "After the hunt everyone
will come back hopefully to Notre Dame's Holy Cross Hall for a mixer until one o'clock." 
Senators are also considering a freshman prom to be held April 

18. "Subcommittees (decora­tion, publicity, favors, band, and mi'dnight champagne brunch) would be chaired by class mem­bers and advised by senators," added Stankus. 
ln order to sponsor not only these activities, but possibly a 
· 
killed in 1964 when Mr. Szalay refused to return to Hungary. 
Mr. Szalay personally ques­tioned the outspoken war critic and famous pediatrician whose attitudes toward child rearing many people have blamed for the revolution of the young 

when  Spock  spoke  here  last  
Thursday.  
The  disturbing parallels,  Mr.  

Szalay said, between the events which culminated in the commu­nist domination of Hungary and the violence and revolutionary rhetoric of today was the pri­mary cause for alarm. 

Me. Szalay believed that peo­pie like Doctor Spock only seem to be interested in "bearing down" or "burning down" the United States while they never voice their appreciation of the country that gave them the free­dom to say what they wish. 
Mr. Szalay stressed that he felt there were some very neces­sary changes to be made in our society, but insisted that the United States was still by far the best country in the world. The changes, he claimed, could only 
be made by following a "down the middle" path to change. The central tenets of Mr. Szalay's "down the middle" 
policy -a willingness to learn and to listen -were essenti-al he said, if the dangers of the ex­treme right or the extreme left were to be dissolved. 
Mr. Szalay was adamantly op­posed to the use of violence to bring about change and felt that violence in accordance with Newton's second law of motion could only be the catalyst for returning and escalating violence from the other side. 

The social problems of today -race, poverty and starvation ­drew sharp comments from Mr. 
Szalay. He felt that these pro­
blems have to be brought to the 
conscious level of the people by 
educating them to the existence 
of the problems. 
He expressed a very optimistic 
attitude that once the people 
were made aware of the social 
evil of this country that they 
would respond in a humanitarian 
manner. He did admit that he 
had been somewhat disap­
pointed in his attempts to edu­
cate other people. 
On a more optimistic note, 
however, he believed that the 
present generation of young peo­
·ple is the best educated genera­
tion in history. According to 
Szalay, this situation will greatly 
help in eliminating social injus­
tices. 
Mr. Szalay viewed the Viet­
nam conflict as a war against 
communism and said he was a 
strong believer in the "domino" 
theory. He felt that our presence 
in Vietnam was welcomed by 
the Vietnamese peasants who do 
not want to live under the "com­
munistic" North. 
Mr. Szalay was also quite crit­
I·cal of the tr t ent that A ·

the administration's Vietnam policy was seen by Mr. Szalay as aiding the enemy and weakening 
ourselves. An immediate peace by withdrawing all our forces, he said, would be a peace "dic­tated" by the communists in the Kremlin and in Hanoi and he termed the idea a "liberal plan of surrender."

The war in Vietnam 
The other day I received a fascinating letter from a good friend of mine at Yale University. Before he went to Yale, he could have been roughly classified as a moderate in his political views. The last time I wrote him, though, I made the mistake of including some various phrases about how I hoped for peace with honor in Vietnam. Well anyway Saturday I got back a letter which clearly indicated the extent of my friend's political feelings, and revealed the tremendous gap between us. 
"To Glen the facist?", the letter began Uokingly I assumed)"... Peace with honor. Oh God. Peace, with honor. Do you really think any of us can ever again claim that this country knows even what honor is? It is our god-damned sense of 'honor' that prompted, even dictated that we would destroy a country to save it, would destroy a people to save them." 
Perhaps honor was a bad word to use, perhaps not. At this point I'm not really sure. I am sure though that the war in Vietnam is moral and is justified, if not honorable. 
One of the prime motives as to why I support the war is due to my belief in the "domino theory". For years now, professional liberals, and radicals have laughed at the theory. They claimed that all the North Vietnamese were interested in doing was re-uniting their country. Funny thing though, I remember looking at screaming headlines Saturday proclaiming that North Vietnamese troops had over-run the Plain de Jars in Laos, oh well, perhaps they are only interested in re-uniting Laos to their country also. 
To tell you the truth, I partially agreed with my friend's statement. By introducing U.S. ground troops, by indiscriminately bombing cities, and by propping up the Thieu government, we have done wrong. 
Yet I strongly feel that good will come out of this cauldron of horrors that is called a war. By taking a stana we have bought precious time for Southeast Asia, if not for South Vietnam. I will probably be ridiculed by the intellectual left, but I honestly think that freedom will be forthcoming in South Vietnam, within the next few years, as long as they remain independent. It is easy to scorn this statement now by merely pointing to actions of the Thieu government, yet need I remind people about the governmental oligarchy that our founding fathers envisioned when they set up the constitution? Or the views that several influential members held, concerning the mass of people? 
My friend also talked about the need for change in his letter, and how he felt that the American people were becoming too complacent and too self satisfied, and that perhaps if things remained the same, America would be destroyed. 
"Yes, I know what America could be like. But I know what it is too. You say it is the greatest country in the world, I say that that is a reflection on the world and not on the U.S. It doesn't say much for the world. All of a sudden Americans are very complacent about their country, AMERICA IS GOOD cries Spiro and the crowd echoes AMEN. Well how in God's name are we ever going to change things with people thinking like that? And things have to be changed, because they won't change themselves, and if they aren't changed then America is going to rot from the foundations up and collapse into its own accumulating pile of shit." 
When I first read this part of the letter, I just didn't quite know how to take it. After re-reading it several times, I realized that this paragraph points out the huge gap between the left and right. 
My God, no one is against change. Do you think that I like to see women have numerous illegitimate children, merely because the government welfare system rewards them for it? Do you think that I enjoy seeing our cities rotting from within while some riot, and 
others smirk about how blacks are stupid and lazy? Do you think I want to see my friends and relatives go halfway around the world and get shot at in a war that was never fully explained to the American people? Do you really think that the Arneri.can people want life to stay the same, and not have any change at all? 
What Agnew and others are saying and challenging is the totality of your condemnation.. They are saying that AMERICA IS BASICALLY GOOD. True there are numerous injustices, but the system itself does not have to be entirely scrapped. They are working for reform, perhaps too slowly though. That point is debatable, but that they are not working at all is insane. 
I believe that America is great, not as great as it should be by a long shot, but I will never never harken to the calls of those who consider us evil.

Editor: 
In Monday's edition this week various views were espoused on the effectiveness of the McKenna-Dedrick administra­tion. I think that in order to evaluate this we must . first examine what the student body expected of their administration. McKenna and Dedrick had offered a greater vision and insight into what Notre Dame should represent as a Christian University than had their oppo­nents. Many students considered these views over-idealistic, but 
the majority decided that they 

represented the heart of this 
community. Trust, honesty, and 
brotherhood were essential. 

Since that election McKenna 
and Dedrick have had·to apply 

this philosophy to many unanti­
cipated events. Their participa­
tion in all the Moratorium and 

the Dow-CIA affair both repre­
sented natural extensions of 
their philosophy. However, at 
this point many students, who 

had agreed with the administra­
tion, became alienated. They 

had never understood the philo­
sophy which they had at first 
supported, but now opposed. 
They cannot see the relevance to 
their entire lives of this Christian 
doctrine. Rather, they would 
like to relate it to · student 

government only, something 
which does not affect them too 

directly. So those who say that 
M.cKenna is responsible for not 
communicating adequately with 
the students are missing the 
main point. It is true he has not 

gotten out in the halls quite as 
much as he should have. But 
specific issues are not what must 
be emphasized. He should have 

shown the students once again 
the total view of government at 
this university, to show them 

that they, the students, were 
inconsistent in their criticism of 
his actions. Therefore, as we 
evaluate student government in 
this last year, we must evaluate 
ourselves and whether we have 
been faithful to those ideas we 
haveprofessed. 
On another level, if one cares 

to evaluate an administration by 
its actual achievements, McKen­
na and Dedrick enumerated over 
a dozen areas where they have 
had success. This year there have 
been no major issues for stu­
dents to become aroused about. 
Hence, this year's accomplish­
ments have not been fully felt or 
appreciated. However, the 
effects will eventually be appre­ciated by the university com­munity since they are consistent with Christ and brotherhood, and will bring the university closer to the great Christian Uni­versity concept so often echoed.

Spock and the women 
Editor: 

As we cannot judge black rage because we are white, so, too, we cannot judge women's anger because we are men. Yet, we can pass a judgment upon fellow white men; in particular, a criti­cism on the actions of Dr. Ben­jamin Spock and members of SUAC who participated in Dr. Spack's address on campus. 
Spock was persuasive and pas­sionate in his defense of dissent in the United States. Yet his conduct and the conduct of SUAC officials in the last five minutes of the question-and·· answer period almost totally dis­credited the preceding two hours. By Spack's own logic, the women who asked those many questions had the right to hang on to the microphone, even to the discomfort and anger of the rest of the audience. Again, by Spock's own logic, the duty of the hard-core radical is to grab the complacent majority by the lapels and shake them into see­ing what the radicals view as immoral or unjust. Those wo­men did exactly that: they shook us by the lapels and should at least be cornrnendt;d for their courage if not for their arguments. 
The events of the last few minutes of the speech reminded one of the Chicago Democratic convention, while the SUAC of­ficial who claimed that the wo­men's protest was "none of my concern" sounded ominously like the Democratic National Party Chairman ignoring the cries from the floor of the Chi­cago convention. 
In short, the actions of Dr. Spock proved him to be at least partly a hypocrite revolutionary, hardly paying lip service to what is a serious growing radical movement. 
We do not agree totally with 
the contentions of the women; 
nonetheless, at the risk of being 
dismembered by fellow male stu­
dents, we cannot support the 
brush-off given to the female 
revolutionaries.

Dreams ---Catch 'em quick 
by Jim Porst 
For the last several years, Notre Dame students have been asking for top musical talent to fill the social void of winter and early spring weekends, not just football weekends. This weekend the social com­mission has arranged to take care of this desire, and take care of it in style. Since the rise of Blood, Sweat, and Tears, many gf(>Ups have attempted to perform in the jazz-rock style, but few have met with any significant skill or success. This week­end, though, the appearance of The Dreams will introduce to the midwest a group which has not only developed a sound with great potential, but has elimi­nated many of the complaints people have voiced about BS & T. Gone is the cold perfection and unenthused style of BS & T, while the improvisational, spon­taneous, original sounds of Dreams step in. 
· Much of the originality displayed by The Dreams is due to the diverse back­grounds of its members. Doug Lubahn, the bassist, was the leader first of aear Light and then went on to play base for both the Doors albums. Jeffrey Kent, the composer for the group, has over 50 compositions to his cre?it, done in associ­ation with Doug Lubahn and Steve Still (Super Session) undoubtedly one of the finest talents in the group is Randy Brecher, who In "Jazz and Pop" Maga­zine, the February issue, was voted trum­pet player of the year. Randy recorded Blood, Sweat, and Tears'first album with them, and left to find his own group when Al Kooper left BS & T. Randy had previously been with Horace Silver, Pharoh Sanders, and numerous other groups. Now it seems he's come into his own. Billy Cobham, Jr., the drummer, also has fine credentials, from the James 
L.amb -Hutcherson concert tonight 
Down Beat International Jazz Critics Poll (placing him ahead of such luminaries as Lionel Hampton, Gary Burton, and Milt Jackson of the MJQ). 
Among the sidemen appearing with Land and Hutcherson is Richard Abrams on piano. He appeared last year at Notre Dame's Black. Arts Festival, performing with the AACM group from Chicago. He has agreed to serve as a judge for the 1970 Collegiate Jazz Festival, March 19-21.

Brown band, to work with The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, Joe Tex, Sam and Dave, and above all, The Beatles where he did much of the studio drum­ming in place of Ringo for Beatles re­cordings. 
Add to these people Randy Brecker's brother Mike, also on horns, and Barry Rogers, you have the group which drove the Fillmore East crowds wild more than the Jefferson Airplane ever did. 
Notre Dame has often been split musically between the jazz buffs and the rock fans, but finally there seems to be a new potential "super group" which can end the split. What makes The Dreams stand out over so many other groups is that they don't sound like just a group of session men reading parts. The Dreams aren't over-arranged (one of BS & T's problems), but are individual musical personalities doing their own thing. No previously written material hashed over for one more round, but original material to bring out the best of each member. All six members have been bouncing around from one top group to another, looking for the right spot. Now they're together, and the sounds are coming out stronger and better than ever. There's a lot of good music being played today; Dreams won't settle for less than great! 
Better catch 'em quick.

The Harold Land-Bobby Hutcherson Quintet, one of the nation's most exciting jazz combos, will appear in concert to­night at the Indiana University at South Bend Auditorium. Starting time is 8:00 p.m.; tickets are $2.00. 
The concert is being sponsored by Michiana Friends of Jazz, a non-profit civic group which orginated last year at Notre Dame's Collegiate Jazz Festival. Though less than a year old, the organi­zation has already promoted highly suc­cessful concerts by the Bill Hurd Trio, Clark Terry, and The Elvin Jones Trio. 
Harold Land is a tenor-saxaphonist of longstanding reputation. He is a veteran of many West Coast groups, particularly ­those of Max Roach, Clifford Brown, and Art Blakey. 
Bobby Hutcherson is still under 30, but he can no longer be referred to as a "future" jazz star. The stardom of thi~ dynamic and eloquent vibe-player, who has been receiving critical acclaim for over a decade, is in the present tense. He was voted No. 1 vibist in the most recent 
Jewish theologian 

exam1nes religious life 
The insights of radical theology, psychoanalysis and Jewish tradition are blended--perhaps for the first time--in an authoritative, highly readable analysis of the everyday problems of personal and family life published today by McGraw­Hill: Morality and Eros by Richard L. Rubenstein ($5.95). 
Rabbi Rubenstein, who is director of B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation and adjunct in the Humanities at the Univer­sity of Pittsburgh, examines the gap between traditional values and the real­istic need of the contemporary Jew and Christian for insight and guidance. 
"We are not the kind of people our grandparents were," the author notes. " .. . The techno-cultural revolution of our times has radically altered our environ­ment, the ways in which we enc.ounter it, and, consequently, our very identities." 
Among the decisive transformations of 
our time Rubenstein highlights the 
psychological and moral consequences of 
the contraceptive pill, the communica­
tions revolution, the collapse of autho­
rity, and the arrival of a moment in 
human history which he calls, "the last 
days": 
"Instantaneous mega-murder can now 
be inflicted on whole nations. The 
built-in restraints to aggression operative 
in hand-to-hand combat with a single 
individual do nc;t work where millions of 
lives are at stake. The computer, the 
rocket, the nuclear bomb,. and other 
refinements of electronic technology 
m:~ke mass death possible through a mere 
hand-motion.... Every day is potentially 
our last." 
In the light of such apocalyptic threats, 
and in view of the religious skepticism 
and pessimism which prevail, the author 
contends that man today requires a partially adequate in the areas of self-knowledge, personal encounter, mar­riage and the family, business and professional life. 
"Our most agonizing problem may very well be our extraordinary freedom," he writes. "We need no longer worry about incurring God's wrath.... We pay a heavy price for this freedom." 
Rubenstein doubts our ability to create a new system of values adequate to cope with the stresses and opportunities of our times: "There are too many people with too many radically different back­
grounds, personalities, and needs for any one set of values to be the new way. Instead, we may require a number of

Grad uat'e students seek to move on campus 
by Bro. Patrick Carney 
While some undergraduates at both Notre Dame and St. Mary's· have been attempting to get per­mission to live off campus, a number of graduate students have been trying to move on. Apparently this movement has met with some success according to information made available at Friday's Graduate Student of University Village has been turned down because of the pro­blems of scheduling and mone­tary considerations. 
Both a minorityand majority report were presented by the Cafeteria Committee. They have met with Mr. Price concerning the problems he faces .in trying to run the food services. To­gether they have decided to con­duct a survey of graduate stu­dents to discover their ideas and complaints regarding the quality, quantity and prices in the pay cafeteria. 
Another question which is being referred to the consti­tuents is that of the desirability of a university-wide textbook co-op. This would enable G.S.U. members to buy their books at wholesale prices. 
Dave Folts presented the body with a proposal to suggest that the university institute a Dr. of Arts program. He explained it by contrasting it with the pre­sent Ph.D. program. The new program would involve more class hours but eliminate the dissertation. Folts pointed out some other schools which have begun such programs and cited the difficulty of coming up with original topics in some of the 
Liberal Arts subjects as a reason 
for inaugurating the new degree. 
Reports on many of the items which have been brought up during the second semester are expected to be made at the next meeting in early March. An ex­traordinary session to vote on the constitution will also have to be held. This will probably be at night so that it can be open­ended.

Carr, Jones key run -gun VICtory 
by Mtke Pavlin Observer Sports Editor 
How they did it no one knows, but Notre Dame and Butler treated over 15,000 fans to a fantastic display of break­neck basketball, resulting in a 121-114 Irish victory. The win established two new team rec­ords and gave ND nine straight triumphs, a 20-5 season slate, and a shoo-in bid for the NCAA Tournament. 
The Irish entered the contest facing a potent set of negative factors. It was Tony Hinkle's final game as basketball coach in a career that goes back over forty years. In Hinkle's last foot­ball game (he coaches three sports and quadruples as Ath­1 e tic Director) his Bulldogs pulled off an upset. 
Butler has been a high-scoring squad this year with two great shooting though tiny, guards in Bill Shepherd and Steve Norris. In their last outing, however, the 
Bulldogs lost undisputed posses­
sion of their conference crown 
on a shot at the buzzer. 
Notre Dame had to play in this emotionally-packed atmos­phere with only seven players in uniform -minus Doug Gemmell and Mike O'Connell due to in­juries and Sid Catlett due to his missing the team bus to Indian­apolis. 
Given the situation, it was obvious that ND needed a big night from Austin Carr and Col­lis Jones. And after an initial cold spell, these two combined for the first 16 Irish points. But Butler's balanced attack held the lead until 13:40 left in the half when Jay Ziznewski stole a pass and fed Carr for a basket. 
A pattern began to emerge as the half progressed. The Bull­dogs ran whenever possible, but 
the Irish dominated the boards, givin~ them extra shots. Carr and Jones continued to pour in the points as ND ran up a six-point lead on several occasions, the last at 3:00 left. Butler con­tinued to run effectively, how­ever, and regained the lead at 1: I 0. 
The upper hand switched throughout the remaining min­ute, but Jack Meehan's three­point play enabled the Irish to take a 63-60 lead into the dressing room after the orgy of scoring. Carr had 27 points and Jones 20. Dave Bennett and Shepherd each had 17 for But­ler. 
First half shooting stats bore out the outrageous score. Butler burned the nets for 57% while the Irish were 28-57. ND led in rebounding 30-22. Bob Schroe­der, Butler's 6-2 forward, shot 6-6 from the floor. 
Unbelievably, the pace con­tinued throughout the remaining half. After an initial Irish spurt which gave them a seven-point lead, 5-10 Shepherd began to work. Height is no factor at 25 
Hoosier Hysteria this week

Act 1 of Indi-an a-, s-60th tial giant killers waiting in the annual high school basketball wings, opens at Fort Wayne tourney, a four-week spectacle It will be Wednesday and that includes two "solid" favor-Thursday before the month long show will really hit the road in earnest all around the state, with a field of 443, the smallest since 1921, shooting for 64 sectional titles up for grabs Saturday 

Fort Wayne, by virtue of entertaining two sectional tour­neys, again gets the honor of firing the opening shots in the "Hoosier Hoopla," Indiana's most celebrated sports extrava­ganza. 
Fort Wayne Catholic will be the first sectional defending champion in action, in the opener against Carroll. Fort Wayne Elmhurst plays Woodlan in the second game_ None of the four was considered a threat to cut down the nets as winner Saturday night. 
For the third year in a row, major teams were represented among the unbeatens in the field, and top-rated East Chicago Roosevelt and No. 2 Seymour, both 20-garne winners, were tabbed in a pre-tourney UPI "Pick the winner" poll as the most likeliest teams to suc­ceed Indianapolis Washington as state champion. ­
Oddly enough, the two front runners drew first round byes and are idle until Saturday after­noon. Indianapolis Washington, 8-12 for the season, opens the Hinkle Fieldhouse sectional here Wednesday night against city foe Ritter. 
Fencers drop 2nd, tankers lose 
Last Saturday in Columbus, host Ohio State upset the Irish fencers (14-13) making it the second year in a row that they have turned this trick. The Buckeyes overcame a 13-12 Irish lead, capturing the last two foil matches for the win. Rich DeJa drier and John Albright in epee kept the Irish in the match with 3-0 performances. They led a strong showing (7-2) in their weapon, but poor showings by both the sabre and foil squads cost the Irish. 
The fencers bounced back against Michigan State, whipping them 19-8 as substitutes handled much of the action. Deladrier and Albright each added two more victories to cap 5-0 days. The match was never in doubt as the Irish brought their record to 12-2 for the season. 
The Irish will return horne Saturday for three matches in the Convocation Center. N.D. opponents will be Big Ten squads from Illinois and Wiscon­sin and independent Tri-State College. 
John Cox and Gene Krathaus each took two firsts, and John Sherk set a new varstty 500 freestyle mark, but Purdue won eight events and defeated the 
This afternoon, the Irish grapplers will host a double-header in the ACC, a match which was originally scheduled for tomor­row. At 4:00, the 'B' squad will take on Kalamazoo with the varsity contest following at 6:00. The match will be held in the Auxiliary Gym of the Convo. Enter at Gates lor 2. 
Irish 76-4 7 Saturday at Lafa­yette. Cox scored high in the one meter and three meter diving, 
195.1 and 210.8 respectively, and Krathaus triumphed in both the 50 free (22.3) and the I00 free (50.2). 
Sherk timed a 5:0 I . 2 in the 500, erasing his previous mark set against St. Bonaventure Feb. 
14. However, he was defeated in the I000 for the first time this year, taking second with a 
10:46.6. Ray Kenny managed the only other second for the Irish in the 200 breaststroke. 
Notre Dame was without the services of star butterflier Frank Fahey, who recently had his appendix removed.

feet and the little guard threw in several long ones to bring the Bulldogs back. 
At 11:57, Jim Hinga's fourth foul resulted in an 82-81 Butler lead, but ND got the margin back. Carr shook off a cold spell for a couple of buckets and his three-point play gave his mates a 101-92 bulge. Shepherd's suc­cessful long-range bombing, however, brought his team back to within a basket, I08-106, with 3:33 left. 
A lay-up by Carr and a three­point play by Jones took the Irish out of danger and they proceeded to run up a 121-l06 lead _before allowing Butler to chalk up the final eight points. 
Jones was the clutca man for the Irish, getting his varsity ca­reer high of 40 points. Carr liad a rather mediocre shooting night, but still ended up with 52 ppints, the fourth time he has reached that plateau this season. His average now stands at 36.6 and he is fifth on the all-time scoring list. Meehan was superb in his floor play and chipped in 
16 markers. Shepherd had 38 and Bennett 30 for Butler. 
The 121 Irish points was the most ever scored by the team on the road and the combined total of 23 5 broke the mark set against St. Peter's earlier this year.

To Tell 
the Truth 
© 1970, .Los Angeles Times 
The world of fishermen, to say nothing of the Burlington Liars' Club, the ghost of Izaak Walton, and the operators of charter boat landings everywhere, was shocked so to speak, to the gills last week when a poacher in illegal waters turned in a record-sized fish and, ultimately, himself, out of compassion for the fish_ 
"This fish," he confessed in a note left along with the dead fish on the warden's door step, "deserves more recognition." In other words, he didn't want his catch to become the Judge Crater of the fish world. 
The man showed a laudable respect for sporting traditions, and we take you now to other fields and other times where this spirit might become infectious, as exemplified by the following hypothetical, not to say, far-fetched news stories: 
"DODGER STADIUM -Willie Mays made a sensational diving catchof a long drive off the bat of Maury Wills with the bases loaded and two out today to give the Sau Francisco Giants the 1970 National League pennant, but, as the fans were dancing in the streets of San Francisco, and the champagne was popping in the dressing room, Willie quietly advised the Dodgers to tag up and advance. 'I trapped the ball,' he told urnp Tom Gorman. 'The hit deserved more recognition than that. It was at least a double.' The Dodgers ultimately won the pennant, and Giant manager Clyde King, when he was revived, lauded Willie for his 'honesty in the best traditions of baseball.' Giant owner Horace Stoneham could not be reached for comment." 
"SUPER BOWL, NEW ORLEANS -Mike Garrett, of the Kansas City Chiefs, won the third straight Super Bowl for the AFL today when, with 10 seconds to play and the Chiefs trailing by three points, he ran 88 yards with a Lenny Dawson swing pass for a touchdown. But, as his teammates lifted him on their shoulders, Mike commanded, 'Put me down.' He then went to the field judge. 'I stepped out of bounds on the 50 when their safetyrnan took out two of my blockers. A move like that deserves more recognition and my left foot was out as the gun went off.' Coach Hank Stram later said a study of the films showed Garrett to be telling the truth. 'I drill these boys in fundamentals,' he said, 'and truth is the first of them."' 
"MADISON SQUARE GARDEN -Joe Frazier won a unanimous decision over Cassius Clay in their heavyweight title fight here tonight but refused to accept it after pointing out he had fouled his 'opponent in three of the rounds he had officially won. The referee -and two judges had an identical 7-6 scoring with two rounds even, but Frazier leaned through the ropes to advise the judges, 'You will recall I butted in the 13th, I hit on the break four times in the II th and I stuck my thumb in his eye and hit him low in the 15th. H~ deserves to be champion even though he can't see out of one eye and I hereby forfeit.' The news brought Gene Tunney out of retirement to announce he was returning his championship belt and his retired-undefeated status to Jack Dempsey as subsequent research has shown he was given a count of 14 when floored by Dempsey in 1927. 'There is no doubt about it, under Marquis of Queens berry rules, I was knocked out,' admitted Tunney, apologizing for the delay.'' 
"MADISON A VENUE -TV Account Executive Irving Shrill, 
shot by his wife, aschbed it all to a case of mistaken identity today. 
'I carne horne with lipstick on my button-down and my wife blamed 
it on my secretary_ I said, 'No, it was the blonde receptionist. A girl 
like that deserves recognition.' Shrill will recover, but has been taken 
off the agency's cigarette account. When last heard in his delirium, 
he was saying 'Our cigarette has killed more mice two-to-one than 
an other brand. A cigarette like that deserves more recognition.'"
