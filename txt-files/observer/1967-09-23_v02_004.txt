BY TERRY O'NEIL 
The Golden Domcrs host the Golden Bears at 1:30 today at Notre Dame Stadium in what should be the glittering start of a season for the Fighting Irish. 
The defending National Cha­mpions, trying to improve on last season's 9..1J-l slate, will field 23 returning lettermen and rely heavily on the Midas-touch pas­sing combo of Terry Hanratty to Seymour. 
Already, the Associated Press 
(in its pre-season poll of writers and broadcasters) and Sports Il­lustrated have predicted the Irish will haul down their 13th nat­ional crown since 1924. 
California enters on the wave of a 21-13 picnic with Oregon Saturday in the opener at Ber­keley. But, like Yogi, the Golden Bears might want to pack up their goodies and go home after facing the Irish. 
This will be the last ND..Cal encounter for at least the next ~ix year3, since the clubs are not scheduled through I 973. The Irish have swept the previous three games, winning 28-6 in 1959, 21-7 in 1960 and 48-6 in 1965. 
In an attempt to better last year's 3-7 log, Cal is banking on junior quarterback Barry Br­onk and a raft of newcomers. Bronk suffered a shoulder sep­cration last fall and underwent an operation just before spring practice, missing the entire ses­sion. However, the 6-2, 200­pounder gave evidence during the Oregan game that he is phy­sically sound. 
California has a new look this year after Coach Ray Willsey brought in more than 20 jun­ior-<::ollege .transfers, an all-time high for the Bears. Add to these boys a dozen men from last year's unbeaten frosh squad and ten fellows who were academ­ically or physically ineligible in 1966. 
Tailback Paul Williams, a spe­edy 5-ll, 180 pound junior, is the breakaway threat. He went to Berkeley this past spring from Benedict Bollege, a small South Carolina school that gave up football. 
At fullback is John (The Hor­se) McGaffie, ~~ 6-1, 215-pound­er who was twice selected jun­

all Notre Dame Knights who have made this gift possible."

2. 
Do not under any cir­cumstance learn the verse that precedes the chorus. It begins with ' Rally sons of Notre

3. 
When the Fight Song is being sung, always begin with the chorus. This will confuse the band and cheerleaders, who al­ways begin with the verse. The verse is vaguely similar muscially to the chorus but is about two lines shorter. Thus, ~hey will be starting the chorus as you finish it. Try to drown them out.

THE og&'IIR; 
Offense Is •• Outa Sight •• 
BY KEN CANGE 
Problems, problems, proble­ms. Naturally. What else could be expected when a team loses five consensus All-Americans and 
five  other  stalwart  performers  
who  recieved  partial  All-Amer­ 
ican  acclaim.  How  can  a  team  

be rebuilt to a power strong 
enough to hope to defend its 
National Championship? 
It would seem to be an im­probable feat, !ndeed, but as Sports Illustrated so accurately (for a change) put it, '·Notre Dame has always had a lot of ways to beat you.'· 
Last year tile lrisll ground out an impressive 2.1 16 yards on tile ground. Some of these y:Hds were made going througll and over the defensive linemen of the opponents, and why not when there arc runnins backs with the speed, finesse and de­sire the likes of a Nick Eddy or a Larry Conjar. 
However, there were numer­ous times when Eddy and Con­jar could have taken the handoff and merrily skipped through the line blindfolded for a five yard gain before even being brushed by a defensive man. Some shots from an end zone camera often pictured holes big enough to drive a Mack truck through. 
But this is another season and there will be different backs go­ing over and through the defen­sive line and. perhaps, even through a hole or two. But can a line with only two regulars re­turning be expected to create the gorges that Conjar and Eddy were as accustomed to? 
In effect. can such outstand­ing men as center George Goed­dekc. 1\11-Amcrican guard Tom Regner. and tackle Paul Seiler. a top pro draft choice, be replaced'? Well, everyone in the nation who annually picks their dream -team -to -he seemingly thinks so. Many say it will be 
even better tllat the '66 squad i.lnd perhaps the greatest Irish team to hit the gridiron. 
!f this is to become a reality the interior offensive line will have to prove its mettle. The offensive line will have three returning starters from last year's team and tllesc spots should not prove to be anything but a de­light to head coach Ara Parse­~hian. 
Last sc:~son Notre Dame's ends accounted for I, 115 yards per catch. Leading in this cate­p,ory was. of course, .I im Sey­mour. This tall, r:~ngy split-end accounted solely for 1:!62yards on 48 receptions and 8 touch­downs establishing Notre Dame 
records for most passes caught in one game ( 13 vs Purdue), most yards on pass receptions (276 vs Purdue), and tied the record for touchdowns caught in a single game against the same boilermaker team. 
This was all :~ccomplishcd while playing full time in only seven of the Irish encounters. lie 

was sidelined through the entire Navy and Pittsburg games, and saw only limited action in the Oklahoma and Duke games due 
to injuries. 
This will be Seymour's se­cond season of varsity competi­tion, and with a year of exper­ience under his belt his dazzling speed and shifty moves which gained him recognition as an All-American mention with the Associated Press, United Press International, the Sporting News and the Newspaper Enterprize Association, not to mention Time Magazine, should make him all the more tough to de­fend against. 
! r trouble should develop. however. the unusual depth at that spot should more than suf­fice. Seymour's back-up men will be juniors Paul Snow and Curt llcnci.•han, both of whom 
JIM SEYMOUR 
were sidelined with injuries most of last season. Snow, the bro­ther of former All-American Jack Snow, and a standout in the spring Old-Timers game can in no sense of the word be con­
sidered only a "sub." Curt Hen­eghan, who was originally rated with Seymour could very well be playing opposite Seymour in someone else's system. 
At the tight end position Dun 
Gmitter's replacement will be a 
6-4, 240 pound junior, George 
Kunz~ who played brief1y as a 
regular at the tackle position as 
a suphmore. Kunz, who sus­
tained a leg injury was a Shrine 
All-Star pick in 1964. Providing 
the needed depth at the pos­
ition will be Jim Winegardner, 
a 5-4 225 pound junior who saw 
only limited action as a tight end 
last season. 
The right tackle position will be filled by junior Bob Kuechen­berg, 6-2, 245, the only soph­starter in last years interior line. playing next to last year's stand­outs he was almost forgotten, but should be one of the leaders of this year's team. Behind Kue­chenberg will be sophomore Charles Kennedy, 6-3, 240, who had an excellent freshman year and who whould bolster the in­terior crew considerably. 
Parseghian had hoped to use Rudy Koniecany, a 6-0, 225 pound senior, who was sidelined last year with a knee injury, at the other tackle spot. However, Konieczny did not fully respond to winter surgery and Jim Reilly will get the nod as the starting left tackle. This should not be any letdown. though, because Jim proved himself to be more than capable in spring ball as a tough man to move around. Rei-Jly, a 6-2, 230 pounder will be hard-messed to keep his position by junior Terry Brennen. At 6-4 235 pounds, Brennan has good 

speed and agility and was hon­
ored in spring practice as the 
'·outstanding offensive freshman 
lineman." 
A regular from last year's 
team, Dick Swatland will hold 
down the right gurad slot. The 
6-2, 235 pound junior was side­
lined during the entire 20-day 
spring practice session with a 
thigh injury, but has fully recup­
erated and should be back to the 
form that earned him a starting 
birth last year. 
The line will be, for the most part, young and inexperienced, but so was the battery of Terry Hanratty and Jim Seymour last year. When things arc going well on offense the line is usually for­gotten, but when the tables arc turned everyone wonders where the holes are. 
Last year's offense was explo­sive and powerful, a mass of hu­manity that steamrolled up and down the turf at an earth-shak­ing rate. The pressure will be on this new breed to do the same to 
retain the national trophy. Can a team be rebuilt by such leaps and bounds? Don't bet against 
the luck of the Irish!

McGaffie was thrust into a starting role during the off-sea­son when Rick Bennett was hurt in an auto collision. Bennett, last year's leading bear runner 
as a sophomore, is shelved wiih 
a dislocation in the pelvis area. 

The Irish aren 'c in top phy­sical shape either. Coach Ara Parseghian reported Monday that All-American candidate Kev­in Hardy is doubtful because of the shoulder injury he suf­fered during a summertime base­ball game. So the defensive~nds.,. will probably come from a four­some which includes soph Dew­ey Poskon, juniors Brien Stenger and Chick Lauck and senior Kevin Rassas. 
The Golden Bears left Oak­land, California, by United Air­lines, at 8 a.m. yesterday and arrived 2 p.m. at the South Bend Airport. They are staying at the Hotel Elkhart and will leave South Bend immediately following the game.

Alas and alae Irish diehards, it is indeed true. The running game will not be as explosive as last season. And it would seem that all this 'fear and trembling' must have some effect on the team's confidence in its air arm and es­pecially on the ballplayers who are being called upon to fill the gaps created by those who have left to play in Notre Dame's on­ly post-season game, the Money Bowl, Right?

THE IRISH EYE-----­
No Honey, For Bedrs 
--------------------------N~~~ 

BY TOM FlGEL 
When the Golden Bears came up against Notre Dame two years 
ago, they went away looking like cubs, slapped down and without 
the honey. The Irish ran inside, outside, but primarily over a weak­
er team. 
There had been some apprehension over that game. Many felt 
that Notre Dame, strong on the ground, lacked the power through 
the air which had characterized the '64 squad. When Dick Hacken­
berg of the Chicago Sun-Times described the game, "carried" was 
the word he used. In '65 the Irish ran until they dropped; they al­
most succeeded in their one-way offense because of the runners 
they had that year. The California game set the doubts to rest and 
showed that the Irish running game was strong enough to pick up 
the slack of a weak passing game. 
It wasn't that Bill Zloch was a player without talent but just ·that so much talent surrounded him. When you bump elbows with 
the likes of Bill Wolski, Nick Eddy, and Larry Conjar, you don't of­
ten bring the stands to a roar for something you yourself accom­
plish. Even Avis is only No. 2 and Alf Landon would probably 
have stammered in the company of a Washington, Jefferson, or 
Lincoln. 
Bill Zloch had a tough position to fill and a tough year in which 
to fill it. The ' 64 team had almost stolen home and the man consi­
dered responsible was a surprise named John Huarte. Huarte and 
Jack Snow had brought the bomb back to Notre Dame and Notre 
Dame ate it up. Even Ara has said that the game he prefers is a 
passing game. 
But the object of the game is to win and Notre Dame eats up 
winning even more than passing. The plan in'65 was to run and Bill 
Zloch was surrounded by runners. When Wolski, Eddy, and Conjar 
are right there with you, who needs pass protection? Even with­
out the long bomb, the '65 team had more to go on than a moth­
er's prayers or a vigil light at the Grotto. They had a winner's soul, 
even if the wins had to come ground out. 
The school that invented the forward pass had to go without; 
but it was ready to go just the same. Bill Zloch was enough of a te­
am man to use the ability which surrounded him and to forge the 
electric effect of a passing game. He relied on what was sure and 
passed only when the chips were down. Though not as fancy as a 
Huarte or a Hanratty, Bill Zloch usually came through when the 
pass was the only way. 
This year the Golden Bears come up against a more balanced 
attack. Notre Dame's quarterbacks have arms and the accuracy wh­. ich makes the game exciting and the stands a wild free for all. Whereas in '65, the team surpassed expectations, the '67 team is so highly regarded that it can only live up to predictions. 
Not that the team has no running attack. Rocky Bleier has 
been consistently impressive and Dan Harshman is no pansy. In a 
fight, it's nice to have the left jab as well as the strong right arm. 
Notre Dame is almost strong enough to use both at once. The of­
fense is such a diversified scoring threat that at the end of the sea­
son every defense should be on warm milk and soggy bread at 
bedtime. 

When Notre Dame takes the field and begins its season this afternoon, it should be "Here come the Irish" in more ways than ·one. It's nice to win but it's exciting to pass. At any rate it keeps 
them guessing and this year every play has got to be a question 
mark. The only sure thing you can bet on is that the play will 
work.
