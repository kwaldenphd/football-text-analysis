Weather 

Back to reality: partly sunny and cold today with highs in the middle to upper 50s. The cold will continue into the night with clear skies and lows around 40. Tuesday it will be mostly sunny and a little warmer with highs in the in the middle 60s. 


As the year continues, an increasingly frequent question asked of seniors is "Who are you i_nter­viewing with and what do you plan to do after graduation?" 
Being an English major, I usually hear the "Are you going to be a teacher?" variation of this ques­tion, delivered in tones ranging from slight in­credulity to open consolation. 
I used to react with rather fierce denial when asked this question; after all, I rather naively· believed I was going to set the world afire in a1 fast-paced and lucrative career. I certainly wasn't going to teach. 
Jl1y attitude, like the attitudes of those who sym­
pathetically questioned me, was not particularly 
surprising; it was merely a personal expression of 
the low-regard in which modern society holds 
teachers·and their profession. 
In my case, however, the circumstances are a 
little different than an uninvolved observer reflect­
ing a simple social more. My father is a teacher, 
and has been for the last 22 years. 
I used to wonder what could compel a person 
to endure low wages, poor working conditions, 
little chance for professional advancement and 
the lowjob status which a success-oriented society 
has attached to the teaching profession. 
In a recent national survey, a former teacher 
driven from her profession because of financial 
considerations noted, "People view teaching as ·a 
no-talent no-challenge occupation," and my ob­
servations while growing up yalidate this state­
ment. 

I remember the anger and confusion I felt when 
a friend's father casually remarked "Those who 
can, do; those who can't teach." I can still vividly 
picture the cold fall days when my father and his 
colleagues were forced to walk a picket line in 
order to achieve the raises which other profes­
sionals automatically received. And I remember 
the contempt and often cruelty which permeated 
popular opinion of teachers during these strikes. 
According to the report of the Carnegie Task 
Force on Teaching as a Profession, "average 
teacher pay, which has increased by 2.3 percent 
over the past three years, now stands at $25, 240." 
Hardly a lucrative salary, and one which most 
teachers must augment with income from part­
time jobs. My father, for example, used to tune 
pianos and play in a band to offset his low wages. 
This low salary is ironic when one considers the 
multi-faceted duties society expects teachers to 
perform. Teachers must not only be educators, 
but psychologists, disciplinarians, counselors and 
role-models. They receive constant criticism for 
not performing these multi-faceted duties and are 
blamed for the developmental and social difficul­
ties of many of the nation's children. Society's tax 
aversion, however, makes a true commitment to 
upgrading salaries and working conditions hypot­
hetical at best. 

Yet my father, and thousands like him, continue to teach. Clearly, their motivations are beyond the realm of monetary and social success. They are

compelled to teach by a sincere commitment to education. 
Henry Brooks Adams wrote "A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops." This idea that a teacher can shape the future is not mere rhetoric; next to parents and family, teachers are probably the most influential figures in a person's life. I remember the English teacher who introduced me to Shakespeare's ver­bal mastery, the history teacher who made chronological and often dull texts come alive for me, the physics teacher who patiently explained to me the vagaries of scientific laws, trying to touch some part of my hopelessly unscientific mind. 
All of these people had a profound effect on my life, enhancing it through the benefit of their knowledge and experience, shaping it by unearth· ing untapped talents and potentials. Perhaps it is this satisfaction in helping others realize their goals that causes teachers to sacrifice some of their own ambition and continue in an socially­denigrated profession. 
Now when people ask me if I want to teach, my "no" answer is no longer based on some mis­guided notion that "bigger" opportunities await me, but on the practical admission that I don't have the dedication and selnessness that the teaching profession requires and respect for my father and the many others that do.

Pope attacks divorce, abortion 
Associated Press 
LYON, France -Pope John Paul II pursued his attacks on abortion and divorce during a rural Mass on Sunday, calling them signs of sickness in so­ciety, but his message evoked a tepid response from the au­dience. 
On his second day ofa four­day visit to France, the leader of the world's 800 million Roman Catholics was sur­rounded by heavy security as he traversed the countryside before returning to Lyon late Sunday. 
Police carefully scrutinized the crowds at the Mass in the Burgundy town of Paray-Le­Monial and during an earlier visit to a small ecumenical community called Taize. 
At Taize, pathways used for 
SENIORS: 
with 
contemplative walks were thick with gendarmes. A bel­ltower was converted into a watchtower with sharpshooters at the ready. Security men peered out from neighboring corn fields and cow pastures. 
John Paul said at the Mass that rising abortion and divorce rates were signs that modern civilization is devel­oping a "heart of stone." 
Speaking in an open field of green grass before an esti­mated crowd of I 00,000 people waving colored scarves, the pope urged Cat­holics to work at conserving "a heart of flesh, a heart that has a human sensibility and a heart that lets itself be con­quered by the Holy Spirit." 
He said the increasing num­ber of broken families and abortions were "signs ofa real and true sickness that hits at people, couples, children and society itself." 
He noted that economic conditions, influences of soci­ety, uncertainty about the fu­ture and other reasons are put forward as explanations, but said "this cannot ... justify that a fundamental good be abandoned, that of the stable unity of the family." 
There was polite applause as the pope spoke out against ab0rtion, but the overall response seemed subdued. 
Though 80 percent of the French people consider them­selves Catholic, polls indicate a steady erosion in the num­ber who attend Mass regularly and who support the pope's positions on moral issues, particularly sexual matters.

Healthy games can become dangerous obsessions 
We live in an obsessive culture. We want the best the most, the greatest and we are willing to sacrifice our health, our families and our bank rolls to achieve "the good life. " 
Carol Brown 
on second thought 
Gone is the casual jogger, the devoted family man, and the laid-back college stu­dent of yesteryear. Instead we have the fitness freak, the stressed workaholic ex­ecutive, and the overachieving study monster. 
The weekend jogger is now training for the marathon. What was once an in­vigorating romp along the beach has be­come a mad pursuit of endurance and stress fractures. Why are these emaciated, knob-kneed, drawn-faced sadomasochists running themselves into the ground? For health, of course. 
And what about the young women who are so obsessed with being thin that they are starving themselves. Why? Because being so thin you can see your bones leads to a successful, better life... right? 
Here is a classic: the workaholic father who has pushed his blood pressure to new heights. Now that is achievement. Maybe he is a little stressed now, butwhen he gets that new Porsche he will finally be happy, right? Oh, but remember he is doing it all to make a "better" life for his family. Tell that to his family when daddy misses Junior's birthday, and is too busy to realize his marriage is falling apart until mommy files for divorce. 
Then there is the college student who has learned all he knows about college life from books. So what if he's never seen a football game or been to an SYR; he has a 4.0 and an ulcer to prove it. 
In our obsessiveness we have actually created modern diseases. Stress and anorexia rate in the top ten. Maybe I missed the boat, but since when have self-denial and overwork become virtues? ("Hey, you know I really admire that guy. He's a big-time self-denialist.") Come on. 
What are we pushing for? Why do we work ourselves into the ground? In search of a better life? In search of happiness? Sorry, itjust doesn't work that way. 
Sure, goals are important. We have to work for something right? Right. But how far are we willing to go? 
The only real goal is to live how we want to live. Of course, maybe we want to live as obsessive health nuts, workaholics and throats. But will the hap­piness we are striving for, sweating for and sacrificing relationships for be there when we finally reach perfection? Can we ever reach perfection? 
The point is, perfection does not equal happiness. We can never be thin enough, rich enough or smart enough to make ourselves happy. I forget who it was who said that happiness is not something we can reach for, it just happens along the way. We want happiness so much that we deny ourselves the freedom to be happy. We work too hard for it. Maybe threejobs and two ulcers later we will realize that it was there all along. We werejust too busy to see it. But why waste 60 years to dis­cover this? 
This is not an article written by a leftover flower child as a plug against goals and ambition. Go for it! Just know when to stop. If the cost is your friends, family, health, or sense of humor, the price is too high. 
Ifyour nose has been in a book so long 
you have forgotten that grass is green, if 
you have had more meetings with your 
boss than you have had with your family, 
if you are working out so much that you 
are too tired to toss a football with friends, 
stop and look at yourself. What is it all 
worth? Has a healthy pursuit become an 
obsession? How much is too much? 
Blair Sabol, former fitness addict and 
health columnist for Mademoiselle, in 
changing her obsessive attitude toward 
fitness wrote: "I find it very boring to get

P.O.BoxQ 
Nicaraguan gives first hand account of reign 
Dear Editor: 
Jurgen Brauer's article of Sept. 23 was interesting, but inaccurate. And as for the summer, I was going to school, and all my friends at Notre Dame were working or studying, not whiling away the while. 
As a Nicaraguan citizen I can tell you that the road the Sandinistas have taken is of their own choosing and not due to military pressure. As early as December of 1979, just 5 months after Somoza's departure, they were cracking down on freedom of the press. I know so from first hand experience, not from 3rd or 5th wit­ness accounts. I was told to shut my mouth by a Sandinista officer for inquir­ing about the shutting down of a small paper that had sprung up. The man had a gun as well. So much for the press freedom we were to enjoy... I dare not ask about LaPrensas "infinite shutdown" 
now. 
Early in 1980 one of the Orega brothers made a statement about economic policy: "We shall hang all the bourgeoisie from trees along Nicaragua's roads." This is their idea of mixed company. before the contras were of any significance. 
That 67% of the vote you quote is the 
count only of those who voted. Most 
people did not vote. Arturo Cruz, former

MORNING. 
\ 

Sandinista Ambassador to Washington, formed a coalition that included most in­dependent parties and withdrew because they had reason to believe that there would be no respect for the final vote. The censorship prevailing then was lifted for two weeks before the election. That is not enough time to educate 3 million people on the views of a political party, is it? Your saying that those elections were valid is like asking me to believe what Bayardo Arce said before the elec­tions: "Elections in Nicaragua will not be a bourgeoisie raffle; the people of Nicaragua have already chosen the San­dinista Party as their popular Vanguard." 
And here is where the misconception lies. The afternoon that I hid two kids in my jeep and drove them away from the National Guard I did it to help them and cooperate in the national effort to oust Somoza. I could have been shot along with them that afternoon, but the last people in my mind were the Sandinistas. And most Nicaraguans acted in this fas­hion; rich, poor, middle class. 
It was a time all Nicaraguans were united behind one national effort, and that was to oust Somoza. Pegged to this was the idea of freedoms. No one had in mind to hand power to nine thugs. 
And how do they maintain power if most people do not like them? It is simple; they intimidate people. Guns are extremely useful for this, and there are other methods ofcoercion. Food ration­ing and neighborhood spy committees where the head receives per~ from the government. This happens in Nicaragua. It creates an environment of fear which keeps most people in line. Another fear­some practice are jails, many of which are located in suburban homes. 
The standard of living has sharply declined. By their own admission, exports were close to a billion in 1978, they are now about 300 million. Food rationing and coupons are used now. Cooking oil is now Russian bear fat, which gives food a rancid taste. I can remember taking polio vaccines in the early 1960's, for free. Much of what the Sandinistas boast is mythological. This decline began before the contras were of any sig­nificance. There is no meat in the markets and the contras do not function in the cattle growing regions yet. It is a propaganda feat to blame the contras. 
Education is better, you say? I do not 
agree. Do you know how they teach chil­
dren to add? By drawing rifles and hand 
grenades on a piece of paper...one hand 
grenade plus one hand grenade equals 
two. Do you know how they teach them 
to read? With thoroughly politicized ma­
terial, slogans included. This is not edu­
cation, this is brainwashing to serve the 
aims of a political party. 
The Sandinistas have intentions for Central America as well. This has been shown beyond any doubt by the capture

and well guarded. 
The victims in Nicaragua are the victims of the Sandinistas. We welcome the help we receive from the United States and the more supplies we receive the more people will join the contras. 
The contras are men and women, living heroes, who risk their lives every day to 
fight Sandinista tyranny. The Sandinistas deserve to be held by the nose and kicked in the pants. They are following dictator Somoza's footsteps at a quicker pace. 
The Sandinistas do not negotiate with us because any of our demands are mor­tal to them: freedom of assembly, freedom of press, free speech, free elec­tions, respect for honestly acquired prop­erty. We will settle for no less and there is no reason why we should. 
There are many tough situations in life requiring courage, and I certainly have both courage and backbone to see the 
situation  in  Nicaragua  as  it  has  
developed.

During the summer he reaf­firmed his career goals by taking a look at what he would be doing in the future. Having performed the tasks for which he is now studying has been beneficial for Hofbauer--particularly in his auditing class where he had on­the-job experience. 
'"There was always something to do in the city," said Hofbauer. 
His favorite activities were playing squash, softball and es­pecially volleyball near the Potomac. Other sites of interest included a sidewalk cafe adjoin­ing a bookstore and all-night cafes hosting live bands. While in town Hofbauer also attended the Monkees concert but what impressed him the most was the Fourth ofJuly celebration on the White House Mall with its bands, fireworks and national sym­phony. 
'"It was just like a huge party," said Hofbauer. 
For these three students, Washington D.C. proved to be an interesting city for working, learning and having fun.

Men's cross country slowed by rain 
By KATHLEEN McKERNAN 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame men's cross­country team splashed through the Burke Memorial Golf Course Friday on its way to a I Oth-place finish in its own Notre Dame In­vitational. 
"We just ran terrible," said sophomore Dan Markezich. "It was not a good meet. Everyone ran bad -except Mike O'Connor." 
The freshman O'Connor, turn­ing in his second-consecutive solid performance, finished third with a respectable 24:59 run in the swampy course. 
"It was a mess," freshman Tom O'Rourke said. "It was the mud­diest meet I've ever been in. It had been raining all week, so the course was really slowed down." 
"The course was a lot worse than last week," Markezich agreed. "There was a big lake that we had to run through right in the middle of the course." 
Lake is hardly an exaggeration for the puddle the Irish and the other teams, which included last week's National Catholic champs St. Thomas, had to swim through. 
"The lake was knee-deep," O'Rourke said. "We had to go through it three times -and there was no way around it." 
Nine of the 13 other teams finished ahead of the Irish. Eas­tern Michigan came away with the championship. Edinboro finished second and St. Thomas came in third. Also ahead of the Irish in team competition were Bowling Green, South Florida, Mankato State, Malone, North Central and Wisconsin-Lacrosse. 
Individually, Ron Johnson of Central Michigan came in first with a 24:54 run. Eastern Mic­higan's Don Johns placed second at 24:55. Notre Dame's O'Connor, coming off a fourth­place finish at the National Cath­olic Invitational, improved his placing to third and lost only 19 seconds off his time despite the swamp. 
Notre Dame's other runners didn't do so well. Dan Garrett's 
25:35 was not bad considering

the course's condition. He finished 2 I st overall. Markezich came in 59th; Tom O'Rourke ran the course in 26:43; co-captain Rick Mulvey turned in a 26:57 mark and finished 76th in the 96-man field. 
Notre Dame's difficulties in staying together as a group during the race became apparent with the distances between the runners. 
"We have been trying to run as a group," O'Rourke said. "We do it in practice, but we get in a meet and it doesn't seem to work. If we want to win, we really have to do it. But we're all different types of runners, so it's tough." 
"We're sort of looking forward to getting off our course in a couple of weeks," O'Rourke con­tinued. "We haven't done that well here." 
In addition to their poor showing Friday, the Irish finished fifth in the National Catholic In­vite and lost to Ohio State in a triangular with the Buckeyes and Michigan State. 
"It just was not a good meet" Markezich concluded, "but we have two weeks to get ready for the Indiana Intercollegiate in Terre Haute on October 17."

a good (five-of-six) first half. "We 
weren't moving the ball and they 
dominated. It was very distract­
ing. It takes your mind off the 
game because every time you go 
to the line you're looking to see 
where they're coming from." 
Notre Dame's offensive num­
bers in the second half reflected 
the Tide's awesome defensive ef­
fort: zero points allowed, four 
turnovers, 3-of-1 7 passing, a 
total of 98 net yards. 
"Their pass rush was the key to the game," said Beuerlein. "They put a lot of pressure from the outside and they took us right out of It in the third quarter. One thing is for sure; that Ben­nett gave me a couple of good whacks today." 
Perhaps Beuerleln can find some consolation in the fact that he's not the only one to ride on the Tide's Bennett all the way to the turf. Bennett already has five sacks this year to go along with his career mark of 21 caught­behind-line plays. 
"The game was won by great defense the entire game," said Alabama head coach Ray Perkins. "Bennett is a prototype linebacker, at least one of the top five players in America." 
Perkins would get no argu­ment from the Irish.

Crimson Tide rolls to 28-10 victory over Irish 
Notre Dame joins growing list of NCAA ticket-violators

Alabama's Cornelius Bennett (97) zeroes in Irish on Saturday. Marty Bums has the on Notre Dame tailback Mark Green (24) in game's details at right. and features the play the Crimson Tide's 28-10 victory over the of the highly-regarded Bennett below. 
Bennett sparks Alabama defense 
The Observer/Justin Smith 
By MARTY BURNS Assistant Sports Editor 
BIRMINGHAM, /\Ia. -He came like a Crimson Tidal Wave out of the Bermuda Triangle. 
Cornelius Bennett a.k.a. 'Bis­cuit' charged out from behind the Alabama defensive line, whipped past two surprised Notre Dame blockers, and let his 6-4, 235-pound mass sail full force into Irish quarterback Steve Beuerlein's chest. 
Ouch! Beuerlein, who was at­tempting to run a naked bootleg and who therefore never saw Bennett until immediately before impact, hit the ground horizon­tally and laid there for a few min­utes without moving. 
"I never saw anything, I just felt the hit," said a still-dazed Beuerlein after the game. "I re­membe~ getting up slowly and looking around. Everybody was talking to me but I couldn't hear their voices." 
Around Oklahoma, they call what Bennett did a 'Boz' in honor 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS-Notre Dame, along with three other Indiana schools-Ball State, Purdue and Indiana State-has been added to the growing list of universities with some football players in violation of an NCAA rule on the use ofcomplimentary tickets. 
In compliance with the NCAA guideline, each university has suspended com­plimentary game pass privileges for those athletes in violation. 
Indiana confirmed Wednesday that 26 of its football players had lost all or part of their four-ticket complimentary allot­ment for the season. 
When contacted by the Indianapolis News by telephone last Thursday, repre­sentatives from Notre Dame, Ball State and Purdue revealed that some of their players also were in violation. 
of bad-boy Sooner linebacker Brian Bosworth. Bennett, however, does not like to get too excited about great hits that dis­able players, as his main oppo­sition to the Outland and Butkus Trophies does in Oklahoma. Well, maybe he gets a little ex­cited. 
"WelL you know I don't try to hurt anybody but that's my job," said Bennett. "My mind was made up before the play started to go get him, and nobody picked me up. I just had a big smile the whole day because I really did have some fun today." 

"That hit he made?," asked teammate Curt Jarvis, who re­corded a 13-yard sack of his own that spoiled one Notre Dame drive. "That was probably one of the most vicious licks I've ever seen on a quarterback. I think that kind ofset the tempo for the rest of the day." 
Irish players were a bit more certain than Jarvis that Bennett's hit turned the momentum around for good. The capacity 
Notre Dame Athletic Director Gene Cor­
rigan said the figure was confidential, 
"but it was a fairly good number." 
Under last year's NCAA guidelines, each player was allotted four tickets per game, which he could distribute only to family members and fellow students. As an ex­ample, girlfriends who didn't attend the school were not eligible for a ticket. The athlete was not allowed to give the passes to anyone else or sell them. The players who violated the ticket rule lost one ticket per infraction, but did not lose any eligibility. 
"My viewpoint of NCAA rules is that you've got to do your darndest to stay within the framework." said King. "But you can stumble over some of those rules and not even know what you are doing sometimes and break 'em." 
"The whole thing irks me," said IU crowd of well over 75,000 literally shook the ancient rafters of Legion Field with delight at the hit, and then continued hol­lering while Beuerlein and Notre Dame stalled on the drive. That exuberance turned into absolute mayhem on the ensuing punt when 'Barna's Greg Richardson returned the kick 66 yards for a touchdown to put the Tide up for good at 7-0. Incidentally, the last player who had a shot at Rich­ardson, Irish punter Dan Soren­son, was taken out by -who else -Bennett. 
"Bennett and the whole team played extremely well," said Holtz. "His quickness, especially on the astroturf, is amazing. That (sack) really gave them the mo­mentum and excited that crowd." 
Things turned from bad to worse in the second half, as Ben­nett and crew really began penetrating toward whatever Notre Dame quarterback hap­pened to be in the game trying

coach Bill Mallory. Wnen a Kid loses his tickets because of last year, it's a shame. It's a ridiculous rule. 
"It's been awhile since something has come out that has got me more uptight than this." 
"It's nit-picking," said Corrigan. "The regulation was designed to prevent players from selling tickets for a profit." 
None of the five Indiana schools was found in violation of selling tickets since the players never have possession of the actual tickets. Their guests are on a pass list. 
Still, Mallory said he had no qualms about players selling tickets. 
"They have four tickets and they can do what they want with them. Students will be out there selling them. They'll scalp 'em. If they've got some games where they can pick some extra bucks up on, I don't think there's anything wrong 
Alabama's impressive win was easy as one-two-three 
By MARTY BURNS Assistant Sports Editor 

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -All in all, Alabama's 28-I 0 victory over Notre Dame was as simple as one-two-three. 
One punt return by speedy 'Bama wide out Greg Richardson, two crucial scores by even speedier 'Barna wide out AI Bell and three touchdown passes by senior quarterback Mike Shula added up to a Crimson Tide whipping over the Irish before 75,808 noisy Legion Field pa­trons. 
The impressive win upped second-ranked Alabama's season record to a perfect 5-0, while Notre Dame, still strug­gling to put all the pieces to­gether under Head Coach Lou Holtz, fell to 1-3. 
The big-play offense and spe­cial teams of the Crimson Tide may have put the points on the board and won the headlines, but it was a fine defensive effort on both sides of the ball that characterized the contest. And, ultimately, it was the stronger defense of Alabama, led by the incessant attack of Tide linebacker Cornelius Bennett, that pecided the ballgame. 
"I really must pay special trib­ute to a fine, fine Alabama foot­ball team," said Holtz. "They came prepared to play, and it 
Losing streak continues as soccer team drops pair 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame soccer team dropped two contests over the weekend. 
On Friday against Wiscon­sin, the Irish took a 1-0 lead on midifielder Rolfe Behrje's goaL but the Badgers scored twice and downed Notre Dame, 2-1. 
Yesterday the Irish traveled to JVIilwaukee to take on Mar­quette. The Warriors scored the first goal of the game, but

with that. It's been going on a long time." 
Representatives from all five univer­sities felt the penalties were too severe for the crime. 
"I think we need to take a look at it after all of this has shaken down," said Corrigan. "I hate to see the players penalized for leaving a ticket for a friend, but unfortunately we had to take some tickets away." 
In one case at Notre Dame, a player left a ticket for a high school coach. As it turned out, the coach could have received a ticket from the Notre Dame coaching staff. 
"A family gets to be rather nebulous sometime," said King. "How far does fam­ily go? Stepfather? Common-law mother and father? It's a rule that needs to be looked at carefully to see that some legitimate people don't get penalized." 
was no nuke. The better team won today. 
"Bennett and the whole team can put tremendous pressure on you, and they forced us into a lot of turnovers." 
On the day, the Irish commit­ted five turnovers, two of which were promptly converted into touchdown scores for Alabama. The Crimson Tide, meanwhile, were hurt by only one of their three turnovers, when Irish quar­terback Steve Beuerlein con­nected with nanker Tim Brown on an eight-yard scoring pass after Shula had the ball jarred loose at his own I 1-yard line by Notre Dame linebacker Darrell Gordon. That touchdown pass pulled the Irish within a touch­down at 14-7, but it was as close as they would get. 
But, as has been the case all season for Notre Dame, mistakes in the kicking game and poor coverage on one or two plays al­lowed the stymied Alabama of­

scoreboard.  
"It  shouldn't  have  been  so  
high-scoring  because  the  

defense on both sides of the ball played hard," said Gordon. "But it was the one or two big plays we gave up that beat us. We shut down their run, but then the big play hurt us."

This game, much like the Bowling Green contest was very physical, with 60 fouls and six yellow cards issued by the referee. 
The losses extended the team's losing steak to three games and left it with a 9-4 record.
