Gaal's removal near? 
By Hob Cosentino, Jerry Lutkus <Observer News Editor), and Ann Therese Darin (Observer Associate Editor) 
Wednesday night may mark the ter­mination of the short reign of John Gaal as St. Mary's student body vice-president. Judicial Board Chairman Sue Welte will present the Board's decision tomorrow night to overide the student assembly's decision to elect Gaal. 
Observer Insight 
"The election is being contested," ex­plained Miss Welte, "because they are at least two distinct· violations in the election procedure of the SMC Procedural Manual." 
Although Gaal was elected to the post by student assembly representatives with a 10 -5 verdict excluding 3 abstentions, Miss Welte contended the election is invalid because Gaal is not a St. Mary's student 
"The manual clearly states that the SBVP must be a St. Mary's student," Miss Welte substantiated. She contends he directly violated election regulations. Gaal has not paid the student government fee. He also did not run for his office in a school-wide election. 
Miss Welte is not alone in her opposition to the seating of Gaal, a sophomore government major from Grace Hall, with no prior campus or high school student government experience. Jean Seymour, delegated by the student assembly to act as chairman for the special election, also believes Gaal's election to be invalid. 
"Personally I think Sue's right," she claimed. "It has to be a St. Mary's student, all right. It could be a boy Possibly. but practically it has to be a girl. 

contest John Gaal's election 
"I feel badiy about John Gaal. He's a 
very nice guy and when he called me on 
Sunday he impressed me with his 
knowledge of the Student Government 
Manual. But we have worked so hard for 
this student manual, that it seems a shame 
to throw it out and to not follow the rules 
that were set up by students themselves 
which we would be doing by validating 
Gaal's election," she claimed. 
In supporting Miss Welte's claims, Miss 
Seymour anticipated trouble getting the 
St. Mary's administration and faculty to 
recognize Gaal as vice-President. 
"Sue's worried that the faculty and 
administration will not recognize him as a 
voting member of the Student Affairs 
Committee and the Student Affairs 
.. Council. Those are two tri-partite 
committees that the SBVP sits on with 
voting privileges. And that was the main 
reason for having this whole election in the first place -we need someone who will be ablle to vote at the meetings of these two committees in the next month," she said. 
Miss Seymour also confirmed late last night that she has been instructed to act as election chairman during the coming student body presidential and vice­presidential campaigns. Normally (ac­cording to the student procedural manual l, the SBVP has served as chair­man of the election committee and organized and tabulated election resuls. 
Somemembers of thestudent assembly, however, reacted in opposition to Miss Welte's proposal. 
Jim Clarke, at-large student assembly representative, claimed that "the assembly should not rescind their decision. I personally objected to it, but since he was voted in, he should stay in." 
Molly Kowalczyk, student assembly secretary, agreed with Clarke. She declared Miss Welte's first point (that a student had to be an SMC student to run for office) technically wasn't right ac­cording to the Governance Manual of the College. 
According to the Governance of the College Manual, Article II, page 1, it says, cited Miss Kowalczyk, "All St. Mary's students are a priori members of the student government body." This does not keep the ND guys out of SMG"' student government, she commented. Look .at the three at-large members on the assembly from Notre Dame. 
Miss Kowalczyk also disagreed with Miss Welte's decision to disqualify Gaal because he does not conform to the article: "Each student will have the responsibility of paying student government fees.

Ulster Catholics plan protest campaign 
by Bernard Weinraub 
<cl 1972 New York Times 
Belfast, Northern Ireland, Feb. 7­Roman Catholic civil rights leaders, buoyed by Sunday's mass peaceful protest in Newry, announced today the start of a campaign of sit-ins, picketing and telephone and postal disruption. 
The civil disobedience campaigmwill start Wednesday, six months after the Northern Ireland government began to intern Catholics without trial in an effort to crush the illegal Irish Republican Army. Roman Catholics view internment as a repressive measure that ignores Protestant terrorists. 
"On Wednesday, roads will be blocked, pickets will be placed at R.U.C. (Royal Ulster Constabulary) stations, there will be a blocking of administrative processes and telephone services will be disrupted," said Kevin McCorry, a key organizer of the Northern Ireand Civil Rights Association. 
"It will be nonviolent peaceful disruption," he said. "This is a completely 
new departure in civil disobedience here. It's never been attempted before on such a massive scale." 
Although Wednesday -which the rights leaders termed "disruption Day" --will include protests in Belfast, Londonderry and other cities, the organizers em­phasized that the disruptions would continue thereafter attempt to focus at­tention of their demands. 
What the young civil rights leaders urge is an end to internment and legislation that would ensure job and housing equality. On a broader scale the Catholics here insist upon the withdraw! of the 15,000 British soldiers in Northern Ireland and the resignation of Prime Minister Brian Faulkner, whose Protestant Unionist Party has dominated the six northern counties for 51 years. 

"We do not accept the administration of Brian Faulkner," McCorry, a former student at TrinityCollege, Dublin, said in the office of the civil rights association in downtown Belfast. "An entire community is alienated from thisgovernmentmd the system that has oppressed them for half a century." 
Civil rights leaders here were angered at Faulkner's remarks Sunday night that the march of 15,000 to 20,000 Roman Catholics was "an exercise in irresponsible brink­manship." 
McCorry said: "What Mr. Faulkner feared was what happened yesterday. People marched peacefully and without incident. Mr. Faulkner was not afraid of the I.R.A. but more afraid that a mass body of people would take to the streets without violence and show the world what they think of his unionist regime." 
McCorry, as well as two dozen other civil rights leaders and political figures here, faced a summons today for breaking the g-overnments ban on marches. They are due to appear in court in Newry, Feb. 16, to answer the charge, which has a maximum sentence of six months. 
Civil rights officials declined to discuss the specific details of Wednesday's disruptions, except to say that telephone services will be jammed and postal ser­vices blocked. They said that milk and bread deliveries would not be affected. 
The outcome of Sunday's march clearly delighted the civil rights officials. 
"The people showed their revulsion at what happened last week in Derry," said Frank Gogarty, vice chairman of the civil rights association. "The policy of going back to the streets must not only continue but escalate." 
Thirteen Catholic men were killed in Londonderry a week ago Sunday when British Paratroopers opened fire on a civil rights demonstration in the bogside district. Catholic spokesmen insisted that the army shooting was unprovoked, but soldiers said that nail bombs had been tossed at them and that snipers had opened bombs.

SMC Judicial Board objects to Gaal 
(Continued from page I) 
She also felt that "things should not be dragged out any more than they absolutely have to ... that there should not be a general school-wide election . " 
According to Miss Kowalczyk, the election of Gaal, despite the rule that the SBVP must be elected by a school-wide vote, will catalyze the merger prospects. She stated that most of the constituencies have been polled and that students reported to their assembly representatives that theydid not wish to have an election, when the elections for next year's officers will take place in less than a month. 
Some of the student assembly representatives feel that the power of the decision rests wilh the assembly. Kathy 'Barlow who isthestudent body president, cited the clause in the College 'Governance Manual that the student assembly can settle all questions within the 'jurisdicition of student government. 
Gaal also cited the manual clause saying that "The assembly has full control and the final say." 

Welte, however, claimed that this is not the case. In the opinion of the judicial board, this clause does not infer that they have jurisdiction over this situation. 
Miss Welte said that "the vice­presidential election is spoken to in the procedural manual. It is stated explicitly how to fill the vice-presidential position. The powers of the assembly are too vague, she claimed, they can only be applied to what isn't in the manual. 
The student assembly could chose Wednesday to sustain the Judicial Board.s decision. However, it could also vote to appeal thedecision. If it chooses this route, the case will go before the tri-partite appellate board. 
Gaal was not the only can­didate to file for the position of vice-president. According to Miss Seymour, two other can­didates, Jack Gillis, an ND senior, and Maureen Rogers, sophomore class president, a.lso filed for the post. 
The assembly disqualified Gillis because he was a late applicant. They also disqualified Miss Rogers application con­tending that she was a member of student government and her election would be in violation of the Procedural Manual which says that the nominee cannot already hold a position in student government. 
Gaal expressed surprise that he was in fact elected. "I didn't expect to get it. I really didn't think they'd give it to a guy." 
Furthermore, he cited the SLC's failure to seat Ann Marie Tracey as another reason for his surprise. "They didn't allow girls over here, I didn't think they'd allow a guy to run over there." 
Finally, he thought that "somewhere in the procedural manual there had to be a point about who can run for vice­president." .. Apparently, Miss Welte feels likewise.

Blantz quitting to return to History faculty

Anyone who happens to loiter around the entrance to the office of the vice-president for student affairs might wonder why people are dashing in and out every few minutes carrying checks and forms.

The_post is not only full time; it is many hours of overtime as well. Father Tom Blantz, the out­going vice-president, will return to teaching in the history

Why did he resign'?

Minority businesses in financial difficulty can receive help from the Graduate Business School and the Law School 
through the Minority EnterpriseSmall Business Investment Corporation <MESBIC). 
One shop taking advantage of the opportunity is the Quan-Tiki and Boutique Shop owned by Eduardo Rueda and located on 208 Front Street in Niles. 
The shop specializes in medium priced men's and women's fashions including jeans, T­shirts, pant suits, dresses and accessories. 
Rueda's two biggest problems are: lack of advertising funds and poor business management. MESBIC has been trying to strengthen the shop's business for over a year. 
The store manager, Mrs. Lock­bridge works part time. Graduate students have taken up the slack by keeping the store's books and taking inventory but the poor business practices of the past have left Quan-Tiki with a $12,000 deficit. 
Rueda is "hopeful that the shop will stay open." He has extended its hours to 5:30 hoping that the increased sales revenue will reduce his store's loss.

Father Blantz is also serving as University Archivist. In this position. he is charged with the care of one of the best collections of documents on the Catholic Church in America. 
"My main reasons for leaving at the end of this two-year term is simply a desire to return to teaching, which might not be possible if I remained out of touch with it many more years, and secondarily, to return to the 

Archives. -I guess my first love is simply teaching." 
One of the most important changes Blantz made was to create the office of assistant vice­president to supervise student activities. His assitant, Father James Shilts, works with Student Government, Hall Government and student activities like the Dome, the Juggler, the Scholastic I<'arley Hall and teaches a course in the Physics Dept. 
Father Blantz tries to make himself as available as possible. He finds the personal contacts with students a most rewarding aspect of the job, although in many instances students-are referred to particular ad­ministrators unoer his super­vision. 
"I personally do not find budget decisions, personnel matters (hiring and firing), and long meetings particularly attractive. I certainly wish I had more time simply for reading and a lot of the other things I miss doing. On the other side, I would say that contacts with students in the office have been the most satisfying aspects of the position, though it is still unpleasant at times to have to turn down requests, refuse premissions, or simply not be able to agree on specific policies. But in general, the work with students directly has been very interesting and challenging."

One year later 
Remember the great campaign rhetoric from last year? The two people who presently occupy the offices of Student Body President and Student Body Vice­President were going to "merge the student governments as soon as possible," they said near the beginning of their epic battle for the coveted positions. 
It is now nearly one year since John Barkett and Orlando Rodriguez were elected. One year in which there has been no overt move to merge the student government. One year, despitge the fact that both administrations elected last spring pledged to merge. 
Not all the blame for the inaction lies with John Barkett and Orlando Rodriguez. St. Mary's student government has never displayed any all con­sumingfieryzeal to merge either, butSunday they did offer a first step. 
The upcoming student body elections would have under the proposal, required the Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates to come together in a bloc, and had both student bodies vote for the bloc they preferred. 
That course of action, the only substantial move made all year long towards the merger of ths student governments, was vetoed by John bBarkett and Orlando Rodriguez. Acting in concert with the rest of the members of the ND election committee, they destroyed hopes for a facilitated merger, with a few pious platitudes. 
That there "is a different structure and a different spirit to hall like at Notre Dame and hall life at St. Mary's" that could not be adequately represented in a merged student government, according to Rodriguez, is misleading and specious 
rhetoric. The issue at stake is not one of representing Canadians and Bolivians under the same government, or chickens and hawks or any groups that have large and fundamental disparities separating them. The issue is one of representing men and women, who, at present, attend institutions that will soon will be fully merged, hopefully. 
The Student Senate will have a chance to correct the foolish posturing exhibited by ND's student leaders. They can overturn the election committees findings and substitute their won. We hope that they do and force Mr. Barkett to redeem one of his campaign promises, finally.

The Notre Dame-St. Mary's merger has joined the ranks of the Paris Peace talks and the latest UAW strike now that all the parties involved consider the question urgent enough to warrant a news blackout. Depriving the students and faculty of information surrounding a situation in which both have had a concerned and vital interest for several years is a serious measure. It places as many responsibilities on the negotiators as it presumes of the journalists asked to comply. 
A journalist expects a blackout to be short term and ultimately in the best interest of both the negotiating teams and the public. In­formation does not exist outside of its context. It is precisely because many of the lldministrators and writers who discussed the merger in the details necessary to present a clear picture of the critical problems, that some information control is warranted. It is just as unfair for an administrator to represent finances as the critical problem as it is for a writer to conjecture from severly limited in­formation that some financial solutions are better than others. Both actions are deceptions. They ask the public to believe that the only relevant information is what one man decides that they "need" to know rather than the facts which that man used to make his presumably rational decision. . 
The negotiators have an obligation to release only information that reports firm decisions. The May 14, 1971 press statement that an­nounced the original merger agreement placed a heavy emphasis on the willingness of both sides to negotiate. Now that this willingness has been challenged, announcements broadcasting "continuing willingness" are meaningless. Progress is the goal of secrf"t con­ferences. Straight-forward statements of "progress" or "no progress" are the only honest approach to rebuilding public con­fidence in boht schools' willingness to negotiate. 
Students and faculty will be hanging in limbo during the period of secrecy. The fifty dollar enrollment reservation is due next week. High school seniors seeking admission and financial aid must be notified. Faculty rank and tenure decisions are pending. Any decision which would adversely affect any of these or many other con­tingencies should be announced immediately. Public confidence has been broken once and it is pure folly to expect that any measure of this confidence could be restored if both administrations play games with the lives of the people who were burned once. 
Of course, any one of the negotiators could take matters into his own hands by handing out premature information. He would, once again, be making the kind of unilateral decision which places his own per­sonal interests in conflict with the public good. This does not mean that a news leak would not necessarily be in the common good but it places most of the deliberation concerning the public interest squarely in the hands of the talkative negotiator. Since he is deciding what in­formation he wishes the journalist to consider in making his decision to print the story, he cannot shirk the final responsibility for breaking the news silence. A writer can use all the facts which past coverage has provided but he cannot consider information, previously con­fidential, which the news leaker has chosen not to give him. 
Ultimately, the burden of secret negotiations falls squarely on the bargaining parties. They are taking the common good into their own hands and out of the correcting influence of public scrutiny. Besponsibility is a two way street. It cannot be expected of others if it is not practiced in the first place.

Dr. Matthew Baigell 
The prints of Chafetz: satire 

1n academe 

Sidney Chafetz is intensely committed to 
the important problem of our time: im­
proving the quality of higher education. 
Like many artists he is a teacher, but 
unlike most he has turned to the problem 
of his community. "The university is my 
environment," he says, "where I find 
subject and motivation". In view of the 
various art movements of the past 20 
years, Sidney Chafetz is an anomaly: an 
artist dedicated to a public cause. He finds 
his raw material not in junkyards but in 
classrooms, searching not only his own 
mind, but also those of his colleagues and 
students. Knowing the importance of 
education he also knows that centers of 
education do not always live up to their 
promise. He feels a sense of urgency about 
joining forces with such critic critics as 
Paul Goodman and James Conant, who in 
their prescriptions for our educational ills 
combine the surgeon's knife with massive 
doses of penicillin. 

As a result of his concern for quality in 
academia, his work has gained such 
prominence internationally that he might 
be called "The Artist Laureate of 
Academic Discontent". He is also one of 
the few artists producing a thematically 
consistent body of work concerned with an 
important public issue of the day. Begun in 
1948, the series now numbers some 40 
prints. Chafetz prefers the graphics 
medium not only because it lends itself to 
his subject matter, but also because he 
wants to associate his work with the 
tradition of social criticism enriched by 
such artists as Goya, Daumier and 
Kollwitz. 

Though Chafetz does not moralize as did 
the Englishman, William Hogarth, he 
intends his prints for an audience. He 
wants them to be seen and "read", and to 
be incendiary. 

His point of view is as causatic as the acid he uses for his etchings, yet his works intended to function as a conscience for the dedicated teacher. The perpetuation of mediocrity and the perpetual substitution of entertainment for instruction frighten him. Appalled by the conceptual barrenness and abuses of common sense of sorrow in his work. "Sorrow is personal", he says, "indignation is public and my prints are indignant". Finding purposeful activities and intellectual pursuits often ending in a promise, he holds up to view those actions and attitudes which then 
become the primary reasons for a university's existence. 
The view is not pretty. Populated with figures more real than imagined, more ethically evil than merely ludicrous, the personal inferno he makes of the American campus rings all too true. Pudgy professors in academic gowns wear 
Mickey Mouse hats. Bloated teachers cry lollypops or penants inscribed with their school motto "Medicritus". Empty­headed instructors hide behind their harlequin masks. I one prin, Une histoire sans paroles (Story Without Words), ob­viously derived from Pieter Bruegel's parable of human folly, The Blind Leading the Blind, a horse's posterior stumbles along leading its parrot-like,sheepish and blindly foolish students. In such works, where satire gives way to biting criticism, Chafetz spares neither teacher nor student, neither himself not his colleagues. 

But as he likes to say, "These prints are 
not made out of malice. Their purpose is to 
remind ourselves not to let these things 
hannPn" 
Like the artists of the medieval wood­cuts, Chafetz also intersperses words and phrases with figures. Written in Latin, the traditional language of scholars, as well as in English, some are purposefully misspelled as if to bedevil the freshman instructor. But where the medieval artist railed against the devil and vanity, Chafetz attacks the achievement of mediocrity. "If you can't teach them, entertain them", he engraves on one print. "Ineptitute in place of imagination", he writes on another. Quoting Ovid in Latin, he headlines across one woodcut, ''He who goes safely, goes in the middle". Figures pontificate, "Act Goodly-Think Hugely." 
Naturally, subject matter is often triggered by particular campus events--­processions, orientation day, Ph.D. candidates digesting departmental "party lines". All are informed by Chafetz ability to see the ludicrous and the absurd, as well as the unfortunate and the sad, in each situation. Processions show scholars as cretins. Nursery school substitutes for orientation day. Professors wind up their students with skate keys, few of whom, as Chafetz points out, have broken their mummy wrappings. 
Although his interests differ markedly from other artists, Chafetz does not criticize those who choose to interiorize their feelings and reproduce them by means of a highly personal vocabulary or respond with negative lack of purpose to social issues of the day. His prints, which call to mind the art of the socially con­scious 1930's, come from a person who matured during the late 1940's and 1950's. Far from agreeing, therefore, with the attitude well summarized in 1936 by the painter Louis Lozowick that " ... nothing could be more sterile than exclusive preoccupation with technical ex­perimentation and nothing more foreign to the best traditions of the graphic arts." Chafetz welcomes purely technical, compositional and poetic experiments. But he would prefer to synthesize his twin roles as artist and educator rather than devote the greater part of his creative energies to inventing private imagery and solving formal problems. 
Though critical of the present in­tellectual order, Chafetz is not defeatist. In a complementary series of prints, begun at the same time as the satiric works, he glorifies the heroes of mankind's. intellectual struggles. Through these works he projects his hopes for the future as well as his positive.committment to the present. Sympathetically portraying men such as Freud, Fros and Whitmen, whose personal accomplishments have made them culture heroes, Chafetz acknowledges is personal faith in man's ability for achievement. 
These portraits redeem what the satiric prints set out to destroy. Both groups complement each other and both forge integral parts of Chafetz's vision. They show him as a critic in the best sense of the term. for they show that he hopes and cares. 


Scott Joplin: ragtime composer rediscovered 
Ry Harold C. Schonberg ( C l 1!172 New York Times News Service 
Atlanta(undatedl-The big rediscovered American composer of the last few years has been Scott Joplin. This black pianist out of Texas, who was the father of ragtime and who died in New York in 1917, has been the subject of much recent talk, and there is even a Collected Edition of his music on the way. 
Joplin composed the "Maple Leaf Rag" and other works along that line. These piano pieces breathe a sweetness and period charm an echo of race and sadness, melodic and rhythmic ingenuity, that conquer all who hear them. And that is not merely a reflection of the current vogue for nostalgia. Scott Joplin was an ex­tremely interesting and original composer in his own reight. 
In 1911 he published an opera, at his own expense. Nobody was interested, and the work was never staged. Through the years even his orchestration was lost. Not until the Friday before last (Jan. 28) in Atlanta did the Joplin opera, "Treemonisha," get a public hearing. The performance, by an all-black cast at the memorial Arts Center came as a climax to an Afro-American music workshop that Morehouse College has been sponsoring. 
In writing "Treemonisha,' -the libretto was his own -Joplin clearly intended to author a social as well as musical document. He set up the forces of ignorance and superstition against liberalism and education represented by a young lady named Treemonisha. 
The only hope for the black community, Joplin stipulated, is through education. At the end of the opera Treemonisha becomes the leader of a group of blacks on an Arkansas plantation. The opera is not only a symbol of black aspiration; it also turns out to be a symbol of women's liberation, as many blacks around here are quick to point out. 
They also are quick to point out that "Treemonisha" must be regarded as a period piece, and they are right. As an opera it is naive, with a libretto virtually devoid of tension or literary ability, and the music that makes no pretense at development. 
Joplin thought naturally in small forms, and his opera is a collection of set pieces rather than a work with any kind of musical thread running through it. And Joplin, too, unfortunately tried to echo European harmonies and part writing in some of "Treemonisha." 
This is not a ragtime opera, although several sect.ions make use of ragtime elements, and there llrl' s~ctions of the work that reflect the strained writing of a composer floundering outside ot h1s 
natural style. But -and this is a very big 
but -"Treemonisha" makes an impact 
despite itself. Joplin could write 
extremely attractive melodies, and they 
were the kind of folk-tinged, Afro-American melodies that no white com­poser could have written. There are moments when "Treemonisha" comes unforgettably to life, as in some of the choruses that reflect the tradition of the spiritual, or above all the slow drag -"a real slow drag," as Joplin called it -that ends the opera. This slow drag is amazing. 

Harmonically enchanting, full of the tensions of an entire race, rhythmically catching, it refuses to leave the mind. Talk about soul music! 
The audience Friday night went out of its mind after hearing "a real slow drag." There were yells, and great smiles of happiness, and curtain call after curtain call. If the rest of the opera were as breathtaking as this, and also the second act, "and Dinah has blowed de horn," the opera would run forever on Broadway. 
Thus "Treemonisha" remains more than a historical and sociological oddity. It ends up transcending itself, breathing a peculiar kind of sweetness and hope. It may be that the militant blacks will dismiss Joplin's humble little plea as Uncle Tom music. One hopes not. And one hopes that the sophisticates will not dismiss "Treemonisha" for its innocent simplicity. For if the operadoes not have the purity of Joplin's ragtime piano solos, adulterated as it is by an attempt at a fancy kind of writing, it nevertheless remains an honest attempt. Joplin should not be faulted for being a child of his time. 
Morehouse College, aided by a Rockefeller Grant, gave "Treemonisha" an ambitious performance. Thomas J. Anderson, a visiting professor at the college, orchestrated the opera in a style that follows the one example of Joplin's orchestration that has come down to us. Robert Shaw conducted the small or­chestra, and Katherine Dunham was the 
stage director and choreographer.It would be hard to fault the pincipal singers -Alpha Floyd, Louise Parker, Seth McCoy and Simon Estes. . . All are experienced artists, and all sang with style and vocal security. Special mention must be made of Miss Floyd in the title role. The tessitura runs surprisingly high, and Miss Floyd sang the role with never a hint of strain in that silvery voice of hers. There was one pianissimo on a high B that will not easily be forgotten. 
Mention must be made also of the fine work of the chorus and dancers, most of them from Morehouse College. The dancers were an eager bunch of loose­limbed youngsters, and they were mar­velous in Miss Dunham's simple but ef­fective patterns. There is only one major miscalculation in the production, and that occurred at the end of the second act. Joplin, who had only a primitive sense of theater, wrote the billiant "And Dinah has blowed de horn" and made it last only a few minutes. But this could be one of the sock curtains of American theater and Miss Dunham should have given' it a reprise. And another. And yet another.

Letters to the editor 
...editorial policy, anti-abortion ads 
Editor, 
In the most recent editorial ­"Scorn where Scorn is Due," (2-4­72 editoriall -you responded to the barrage of intelligent criticism of your recent products. 
You attempted to defend your editorial policy. 
You made one logical statement -"The editorial that doesn't take a strong stand, the editorial that doesn't state clearly and concisely the writer's feelings on the matter at hand, isn't worth a damn!" What is debatable is the manner of this "taking a strong stand." Your manners are poor and boorish. 
You employ two different styles of writing, c01·responding with the subject matter. For example, your 1-21-72 editorial page has two editorials. The first 
editorial  entitled,  "The  Ideal  
Plan,"  is  a  quiet,  sensible  en­ 
dorsement  of  the  Law  School  
expansion.  It is a  logical,  con­ 

sistent piece of writing. 
The second editorial, entitled, "Good-bye Sister Alma", is a departure from sensiblity. ·You resort to the perrenial weaknesses of extremist writings -bitter sarcasm, name-calling, and misleading colloquialisms. You assume an ugly, divisive stance. 
Your style and attitude towards the Provost (1-28-72 editorial) is equally unimpressive. What about respect of authority? What about the dignity of the in­dividual? 
What I found most disgusting is your attempt to show off your competence through the use of excess verbiage. Your exploiting tactics ineffectively mask a certain lack of writing skill; and they force you <by their nature) to fall victim to the logical fallacy of argumentum ad hominem. 
Finally, your hasty, unbacked generalizations about the editorial writers of America's newspapers are opposite of fact. The writers I am familiar with differ from you in one basic point -they do not try to pass off opinion as truth. Some times they print bullshit; but they label it as such. You will do well to follow suit. 
James Reagan 314 Farley 
Open letter to the Knights of Columbus 
Sirs: 
We wish to protest your taste­less anti-abortion campaign on several grounds. 
The first objection is purely gastronomical. The Observer is circulated around lunch hour, and we are no more charmed by pictures of aborted foetuses than we would be by graphic depic­tions of appendectomies or squashed frogs. We assume your intent is to gross out the infedels, in the tradition of the nuns who tell Isaac Jogues stories to traumatize school children into passivity. Sacred brutality is no less brutal. 
This leads to the further ob­jection of the basic primitiveness of your campaign. We feel that you insult the University com­munity by your explicit assertion that we are incapable of discussing the real question of essence preceeding existence. We don't mind the invalidity of your equation of morbidity being necessarily sinful . but we resent your archaic approach to a complex moral question in this intellectual community. 

Finally, we object to your campaign on the grounds of egotistical hypocrisy. The uproar generated by last year's abortion referal advertisement should indicate that abortion is not a topic to be publicly discussed. Instead it appears that we are with Pharissees, fervently thanking God that he has not made them as other men. 
If the topic is to be discussed in the campus media, let it be a debate. If your position is so self­
. evidently righteous, why bother to state it so repulsively? We do not wish to declare ourselves for or against abortion. We consider it a moral question which must be answered by the individual, but not on the basis of hypocritical, peurile polemics.

Hughes book info traced to previous publications 

By Wallace Turner 
(C) 1!172 New York Times First of a two part series. 
San Francisco, Feb. 3 ­Selections taken from what was described as the purported autobiography of Howard R. Hughes indicate that these ex­cerpts could have come from previously published anecdotes about the reclusive industrialist, without any special inside in­formation. 
There was no indication in any of the excerpts that Hughes had a part in preparing the manuscript. 
Irving appears inN.Y. court 
By Douglas Robinson 
(C) 1!172 New York Times 
New York, Feb. 7 --Clifford Irving, the novelist who said he prepared the disputed autobiography of Howard R. Hughes, made his first ap­pearance before a federal grand jury today and refused to provide a sample of his handwriting. 
Federal Judge Morris E. Lasker, after a closed session in his chambers, ruled that the government's request for Irving to "execute certain writings" was proper. 
Irving, in addition to con­tending that his material from Hughes was gathered in a series of secret meetings with the in­dustrialist, has said that a number of documents received by McGraw-Hill, Inc., the con­cern that planned to publish the book, were in Hughes' hand­writing. Some of the documents were given to the publisher by Irving. Others came by mail. 
The Internal Revenue Service said today that it had filed a tax lien against Irving; his wife, the former Edith Sommer; and Richard R. . . Suskind, the 
researcher  whom  the  novelist  
hired  to  work  on  the  Hughjes  
project.

Information about all the in­cidents discussed in the excerpts is available in the clipping files of various publications, so that the skeleton of fact had already been established. 
However, without seeing the other portions of the manuscript, it could not be determined whether the rest of the book could also have been based on material already published elsewhere. 
A source familiar with the manuscript, who said that he had selected the sections at random, read the excerpts in a telephone interview. 
In addition to showing that the excerpts could be elaborations of facts known about Hughes' life, the material showed that the book, if it were published, might be an immediate target of libel suits from many persons. 
The tone of the excerpts is bitter. Hughes is presented almost as a paronoiac. His language is vulgar, according to the excerpts, which have him revealing intimate details of his personal life. 
McGraw-Hill, Inc., which in­tended to publish the book on March 7 until trouble developed two weeks ago, paid $650,000 to Clifford Irving, as author of the book, under the belief the money would go to Hughes.
