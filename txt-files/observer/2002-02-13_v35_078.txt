of the Hesburgh Library  in DeBartolo from  
auditorium stage and did  12:30-3:30 p.m.  
for the first time what  
they had wanted to do  

since the campaign season began last month: compete. 
The debate, a face-off between the tickets that emerged as the top vote-getters in Monday's primary election. was candidates' first chance to question directly each other's experience and goals. 
They took full advantage of the opportuni­ty. 
Vice-presidential candidate Oxley chal­lenged several of Bishop and Foley's platform ideas -revamping Freshman Orientation, organizing a "Welcome Ty Willingham" tour for the new head football coach and installing detex entry systems for residence halls -as plans student leaders and University admin­istrators have already begun. 
"Initially. we weren't aware [that the pro­jects were underway]," presidential hopeful Bishop responded. "That's a fundamental problem -no one was aware of these things. But work on these issues is not fin­ished." 
Moscona. the current student body vice president, countered, saying that his office had spent countless hours researching and planning the initiatives and looked forward to bringing them to completion. 

"I just wish students knew how many hours you were putting in," Bishop said, emphasizing the need for student govern­ment to communicate more effectively with its constituency. Bishop and Foley further contested their rivals' ability to communicate well, asking whether Moscona and Oxley would represent student concerns to admin­istrators. 
"Absolutely," Moscona said. "Keri [the cur­rent sophomore class president] and I have established relationship with administrators. We'll work to improve the lines of communi­cation with students." 
Bishop replied with a swift barb: "I just feel like it's a little late," she said, apparently in reference to student displeasure with University officials' crackdown on tailgating. "I wish communication had been open more last semester." Moscona pressed Bishop and Foley on the tailgating issue. He asked how they expected to interact next fall with administrators who have vowed to continue their tough stance against underage drinking and alcohol-focused tailgaters before home football games. 
Bishop answered that Father Mark Poorman, vice president for Student Affairs, hadn't offered an explanation of why officials cracked down or presented a clear definition of the school's tailgating rules. That wasn't true, according to Moscona, because Poorman in a full-page Observer advertise­ment last fall addressed the concerns. 
Foley rebutted, "He didn't say what the policy was in clear language." 
The Bishop-Foley ticket, which has cam­paigned on the idea of eliminating repetitive student government-sponsored program­ming, faced questions from Moscona and Oxley about a lack of spiritual-, service and academic-oriented goals on its platform. 
Bishop and Foley said objectives such as "Grab 'n Give" food collections and distin­guished lecturer series satisfy those areas. 
"I think we spoke earlier about overlap ...," Oxley responded, pointing out that many University clubs and departments already sponsor Grab 'n Gives and lecture series. 
Bishop said their opponents' platform pre­sented discrepancies of its own. Moscona and Oxley have campaigned on the issue of creat­ing less programming and facilitating other clubs' events. 
"It's contradicting to say that you're not going to sponsor programming, as I feel most of your platform is," Bishop said about

Malloy opens Ethics Week at Mendoza 
. Weeklong series will address ethics and morality in business 
By JOHN FANNING 
News Writer 
University President Father Edward Malloy outlined the qualities that lead to profes­sional success at a keynote address Tuesday t h a t kicked off Ethics Week in t h e Mendoza College of Business. 
Ethics Week, in its fifth consecutive year, is a week-long series of talks sponsored by the college to encourage morality and ethi­cal practice both in job set­tings and other areas of life. 
"The practitioners of vari­ous professions should be held to the highest standard," said Malloy. However, Malloy warned that one's code of ethics must not only be applied to oneself, but also to the actions of others. 
"Judgements about hard cases involving people you know are very difficult to make," said Malloy. 
Malloy said the safety and care of others must come before hiding the wrongdo­

"Sex and the City's" author advises aspiring writers 
By SHEILA EGTS 
News Writer 
Candace Bushnell, author of the popular best seller "Sex and the City," stared blankly at the crowd in Washington Ball last night after receiving some notable information about her audience. 
"I sort of don't know what I'm doing here because I just found out this school is really conserva­tive and well, I'm not," Bushnell said frankly at the opening of the lecture. "I was going to read from my books, but I've been told maybe I'm not supposed to do Lhat either." 
While she planned on dis­cussing the ethics of journalism in the 21st century, Bushnell threw that plan out the window and had the audience in the palm of her hand as she told per­sonal anecdotes from her climb to the top of her field. 
Bushnell started working as a journalist because she needed to pay her rent. but she knew from age 8 that she wanted to be a famous writer. She started small. and one of her first jobs actually involved sharpening pencils for other writers in the office. 
"I don't know if anyone really wants to hear about the ethics of journalism and how it has changed. But I guess that's one way the field of journalism has changed. Twenty years ago, peo­ple used pencils," Bushnell said. 
As she advanced in the jour­nalism field, Bushnell planned her whole career in a way that would eventually lead her to a career as a novelist. She began writing a regular column that addressed relationships between men and women among Manhattan's elite. The columns were later combined into her first book, "Sex and the City." 
"My column started out in first person, but then I created Carrie Bradshaw because I didn't want my parents to read it and know what I was really doing," said Bushnell. "It was horrifying, the dating experiences that hap­pened to me and my friends. But every bad date lead to at least 2 or 3 good characters, so you can get some use out of those guys." 
As a writer, Bushnell said she tends to find the uncommon character that is interesting to write and read about to keep readers turning the pages. She attempts to look at human nature without being shy about discussing the "underbelly" of human nature. 

Bushnell did not design her novels to encourage people to go out and have random sex. Rather, she portrayed characters that would make readers think twice about what they are get­ting themselves into. 
"I am trying to get people to ask what they will really get out of these kinds of relationships. I at least recommend that they don't end up like any ofmy char­acters because these women are really messed up," Bushnell said. 
Bushnell said she felt pressure from her empty bank account to produce another novel and wrote her second best seller. "Four Blondes." She is currently work­ing on her third novel and has nearly completed the first draft. 
She advised aspiring writers tu be disciplined by getting up every day and writing something even if it's just a term paper. 
"Follow your dreams, or at least chase some hunky guys," Bushnell said. 
In response to popular demand from the audience, Bushnell con­cluded by reading two clips from her novels featuring characters based on real-life dating disas­ters. Bushnell was the last speaker featured in the week­long Sophomore Literary Festival.

Meatless Fridays 
Ash Wednesday kicks off one ofthe most important and longest running traditions at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. No, I am not talking about Lent. Preparing for the remembrance of the death and resurrect.ion of Christ is surely important but doesn't 
seemed to incite the passion and debate that this other tradition does. Ash Wednesday is the official start to the "Complain about not having meat in the dining halls on Fridays" season. 
Even as you eat your Blazin' Sea Nuggets or what­


ever other meatless contrap- Mike Connolly  
I.ion the dining halls are dish­ 
ing out today, the in box at  
Viewpoint.l@nd.edu is  Editor in Chief  
already filling with com­ 
plaints about the injustice of  

forcing students to give up meat on Fridays whether the authors are practicing Catholics or 
not. 

Shortly after a few ofthose letters run in the paper, the in box will fill with more letters attack­ing the first set of letters. These letters will have the basic message that giving up meat is a sacri­fice for Christ and that it is only a tiny thing we can do to remember his suffering. 
Next will come the retort from the first group pointing out that without the option ofmeat in the dining halls, there can be no chance to choose a meatless meal and therefore, no true sacrifice. 
This debate will continue back and forth for a few days until finally all the letters just repeat themselves and Viewpoint stops publishing them. It's the same every single year. 
So please, just stop. 

There are greater injustices in this world than eating spaghetti with tomato sauce and no meat­balls once a week. There are greater crises than whether or not you can have a steak. Ifyou really want some beef on Friday, go to Lafortune and order a 'Whopper. 
As far as the logic ofchoice and sacrifice, the pro-meat on Friday people are exactly right. If the dining hall s don't offer the choice of meat on Fridays then it really isn't a sacrifice to eat the fish sandwich rather than the non-existent cheeseburger. You can argue logically as much as you want but that still won't change the menu. Logical argument seem to have no effect on the administration and University big wigs. At the same time, you can't honestly expect a Catholic school to break one ofits own dogmatic tradi­tions. 
Ifyou are really concerned about making a true meat sacrifice today and every Friday until Easter, walk through Lafortune before heading to the dining halls. Walk past the Whoppers and pepperoni pizza. Ignore the roast beefsandwich. Then head to the dining hall and shovel down your vegetarian lasagna. Then you will have made a true sacrifice. 
And if not eating pork on Fridays in Lent is still that big a deal to you. move off campus. Get your own room. your own kitchen, cable, much cheap­er rent and no parietals. Then you can cook whatever you want and you won't feel oppressed anymore. 
But until next semester rolls around and you are happily eating beefwhenever you want off­campus, avoid the Blazin' Sea Nuggets. Those things are scary.

BEYOND CAMPUS 
Duke smoking ban follows national pattern 

DURHAM, N.C. 

Although Duke University's decision to institute a smoking ban in residence halls has elicited mixed reaction, the policy follows the lead of many schools nationwide as administrators cite the need to protect students' health. 
"If the University bans smoking in academic and administrative build­ings, banning it from a place where students live 24-7 is reasonable," said Larry Moneta, vice president for stu­dent affairs, adding that the policy will help foster a healthy living environ­ment for students. 
Many other universities have similar policies. 
The University of California at Berkeley originally banned smoking in all university-owned facilities except residence halls, but the school expanded the ban to dorms five years ago. 
"I never heard any complaints or problems," said Michelle Kniffin, assistant director of assignments and cashier for UC-Berkeley Housing and Dining Services. "There are less than 200 smokers out of 5,300 [students], so there's really no issue about it." 
Purdue University instituted a smok­ing ban in all undergraduate housing last semester. and in fall 2002, the policy will extend to on-campus grad­uate and family housing. 
"The overall reaction was one of great acceptance," said Bill Schnackel. Purdue's senior director for university residences. 
"I don't recall anyone being angry about it. Smokers are finding areas to smoke, and they are even requesting for non-smoking rooms because oflin­gering odors and so forth." 
Schnackel said buildings were ini­tially designated as either smoking or non-smoking; but separating out the smoking and non-smoking areas became too complex, he said, so Purdue decided to ban smoking entirely. 
At Duke, the impetus for the ban was a Campus Council resolution in the fall, although University adminis­trators have been discussing the issue for several years. 


UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA 
Student kills parents, takes own life 
MISSOUIA, Mont. University of Montana student Jared Hope killed his parents and then shot himself while visiting the fam­ily's Whitefish, Mont., home over the weekend, Whitefish Police Chief Bill Dial said. No one told Tim Gibbins.Hope's roommate in Craig Hall. until Monday morning. "He didn't seem like a violent per­son," Gibbins told the Kaimin Monday. 'Tm shocked. I think what he did is disgusting." Gibbins said he met Hope two weeks ago when both were assigned to a room in Craig Hall. Both were transfer students, Gibbins said, new to UM this semester. Hope's moth­er had called last week and left a message on the answering machine, Gibbins said. "She left a mes­sage saying she was looking forward to seeing him," Gibbins said. The bodies of 24-year-old Jared Hope and parents Chester and Carol were found by a neighbor who went to the home Sunday morning to meet one of them for a ski trip. 

SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY 
Newspaper editors apologize 
SYRACUSE, N.Y. The topic of racism dominated the debate of Syracuse University's Student Association meeting on Monday night, as many members expressed anger and concern about a comic published in Monday's issue of The Daily Orange. The cartoon, "Posthumously," by Matt Cohen and Devin Tanchum, was seen as racially insensitive because of its depic­tion of a black man breaking into the home of a white man. The student response to the comic led assembly members Anthony Buissereth, Geri Weinstein and SA Vice President Shawn Hardie to draft a resolution asking for a formal written apology by the paper and the immediate ban of paper distrib­ution on campus. This problem comes just one day after stricter policies regarding comic publication were instituted by the paper. Both Editor in Chief Tito Bottitta and Managing Editor Ashleigh Graf explained to the Assembly that the paper required all comic artists to attend a meeting Sunday night.

USA Today pilots readership program 
ByALISON ROCHE 
News Writer 
On Monday. Saint Mary's students may have been sur­prised to find complimentary issues of USA Today, The Chicago Sun-Times, The Chicago Tribune. and The Elkhart Truth in every resi­dence hall. The papers were donated for a four-week pilot participation in USA Today's Collegiate Readership Program. 
More than 170 other col­leges and universities across the country are currently a part of the readership pro­gram which aims to increase students' readership and knowledge of current events. 
"People don't necessarily go out and buy papers, but if they're right in front of them on their way to class. they are more likely to read them," Tracie Sexton, Senior Account Manager from USA Today, said. 
Sexton, along with repre­sentatives from each of the participating newspapers, came to Saint Mary's campus Tuesday to distribute surveys to learn about students' cur­rent readership habits. 
A post-survey will be admin­istered at the end of the pilot to gauge the program's affect on students. Results from the two surveys are compiled by an out service. It is then the College's choice whether to make the program a perma­nent fixture on campus after the free, no-obligation pilot is over. 
Jerry Madsen, the assistant director for residence life, was involved in bringing the pro­gram to campus and says that the decision to keep the pro­gram will be made two to three weeks after the comple­tion of the pilot. 
"The pilot program will determine if, one, we can afford it, and two, if we can afford it. will it be worth it?" said Madsen. 
If the College decides to con­tinue the program after the pilot, The South Bend Tribune may possibly decide to partic­ipate. Mike Lee, The South Bend Tribune's Circulation Director, said the paper is not contributing to the pilot for financial reasons, but that they are willing to speak fur­ther with Saint Mary's and USA Today on the issue. 

"We chose at this time not to be involved in the pilot pro­gram. It's nothing against Saint Mary's or the program. We'll continue to deliver indi­vidually wherever we can," said Lee. 
During the pilot, the number of papers left on the racks in the residence halls· will be counted each day to form a rough estimate of how much the program will cost the College. If the readership program is enacted, the col­lege will pay only for the papers that are taken. Remaining papers are deduct­ed from the bill. 
Sexton said the cost to con­tinue the program is typically around $10 to $15 per stu­dent per year, whereas a reg­ular subscription to a paper is about $70 per year. She also said that other colleges usual­ly implement this cost into student or activity fees. 
The readership program began at Penn State University in 1997 and USA Today took over the coordina­tion and distribution in the fall of 1999. "Every college campus exists to a certain degree inside a bubble -this program works to burst that bubble," said Madsen.

tor or businessman has a drug or alcohol prob­lem, which is affecting his interactions with his patients. then one must intervene for the benefit of everyone involved. 
Malloy talked about the various elements that typically character­ize a professionally suc­cessful person. 
First, Malloy noted, one must have creden­tials -specialized training in the area or field in which he or she want to work. Second, they must have certifi­cation, such as a mas­ter's degree or a Ph.D.. which gives validity and title to all of the prepa­ration that they have done in order to pre­pare for the career. 
Finally, Malloy stressed the fact that an individual can only be truly successful in the most complete sense if he or she also lives by a certain code of ethics that governs their actions in both their personal and profes­sional lives. 
In illustrating this point Malloy offered the example of someone entering the medical field. As part of the ter­ritory in health care, physicians typically deal with patients when they are at their most vul­nerable. Malloy said. As a result of this imbal­ance of power, doctors and nurses must be cer­tain not to violate their patient's rights in their weakened state, by sticking to an ethical code to guide their actions. This principle also holds true in the vocation of the priest­hood said Malloy. When members of the church come to seek council and forgiveness through the sacrament of penance and reconcilia­tion, it is the duty of the priest never to reveal these confessions to anyone, even in a court of law. 

"All of the established professions have at times taken major hits," said Malloy in reference to the recent unethical practices of ENRON. However, in the spirit of the upcoming Ethics week, Malloy encour­ages graduate and undergraduate students to attain and live by a code of ethics in order to ensure their complete success as they venture out into the real world.

Moscona and Oxley's platform that features several festivals and carnival-type events. 
Oxley told them that they had "the wrong idea about our platform." At another point, Moscona and Oxley played up Moscona's experience as vice president, questioning Bishop's fitness to take over the presidency. The student body president chairs such groups as the Campus Life Council. Executive Cabinet and is usually closely involved with the Student Senate and other Student Union committees. 
"You've never been to the CLC or other meetings," Moscona said to Bishop, who he worked with last year when he was sopho­more class president and she was vice pres­ident. "Having no experience with what these groups do, how will you lead them?"Bishop. who studied abroad in London last semester, said, "When you take a step back [from involvement in student government]. you gain insight. Leadership is not how many hours you spend on the sec­ond floor ofLaFortwie." 
The run-off election is Thursday. On-cam­pus students vote in residence halls. Off­campus students vote from 12:30 to 3:30 
p.m. near the first-floor DeBartolo Hall com­puter cluster.

Lecture addresses the battle of the sexes 
By KA.TIE RAND 
News Writer 
Basically, men and women are different from each other. 
That's the point Saint Mary's professor drilled home in an informal lecture called "He Said, She Said" Tuesday night in the Women's Resource Center. Ella Harmeyer, a nurs­ing professor, said the differ­ences boil down to communica­tion. 
"We process differently, and that's what often gets us in communication books is that 
trouble,"  Harmeyer  said.  
"  W  he  n  
there's  a  


"women internalize, men exter­
nalize," Harmeyer said. : This difference has the poten­
tial to cause problems between 
the sexes since women are 
more vocal about their prob­
lems then their male counter­
parts. 

Harmeyer suggested that this comes from men's fear of appearing weak. 
Another common problem is the difference between listening and hearing. In this day and age listening is becoming a lost art, Harmeyer said. 
"When we talk we're often

why women will typically go on for hours on end talking about their problems, analyzing 
everything and asking ques­tions. 
"On the other hand, men seem to come to terms with problems more so by retreat­ing," Harmeyer said. 
"They want to think it all through, compartmentalize it and then come out with a solu­tion." 
Gray says that from the very beginning men want to fix; things, while women tend to look at a problem, list all possi­ble solutions and then maul them over. 
One phrase commonly used in today to get on 

to the next thing and not living in the pre­sent." 
One other difference is that women often make assump­tions about their relationships. Women assume that they're significant others will know how they feel before vocalizing it. 
"Last time checked extrasensory perception was not a gift that God gave men!" Harmeyer said. 
She also said that people wrongly assume they can "fix" their significant others later, so they put problems on the back burner. 
This misconception that

behaviors will change as the relationship intensifies can lead to problems and disappoint­ment. 
"If he spends every Sunday watching football and drinking beer, why would you think he'll start going to the opera once you sign the marriage license?" Harmeyer said. 
She suggested that women discuss their concerns openly with their partners before it is too late. 
Harmeyer also quoted Dr. Phil from Oprah in her discus­sion about assumptions. Dr. Phil uses the example of taking out the trash to show the differ­ence between how men and women think. 
"For the guy, it's just some­thing on his To Do list that he'll get to later," Harmeyer said. 
"For us, when he does it, this shows how much he cares. We think that if he waits until tomorrow or doesn't do it at all that he must not care any­more." 
Another problem that women bring on themselves is that they too often resort to negative self­talk, which men do not do as frequently. 
For example, if a guy has not called after three days. the female immediately assumes there is something wrong with her and blames it on herself. 
They never stop to think that maybe he had a good reason or that maybe it was his fault. 
The discussion was sponsored by The Community Leadership Team, a group that started after last year's conference. 
The group is trying to make the Women's Resource Center more visible on the Saint Mary's campus.

Trigiani relives influential roots at Saint Mary's 
By SARAH RYKOWSKI 
News Writer 
Adriana Trigiani put Saint Mary's College in her novels not just because she went to the school, but because it fit the story and the characters. 
In fact, Ave Maria Mulligan's attendance is a pivotal point of "Big Stone G a p , Trigia.ni 's bestseller, and also affects Trigiani's upcoming novel. "Milk Glass Moon," which will come out in July of this year. 
"Ave Maria went there because I wanted her to go to a women's college that was Catholic in origin," Trigiani said. In the third book, Ave Maria tries to get [her daugh­terl to go there, and Etta docs not want to go." 
"A person is really formed here," Trigiani said. "I took [Sister Jean Klene's Shakespeare] class twice, the second time I just took it to listen and enjoy and gain knowledge. 
Trigiani revealed in her lec­ture that she had been shy, an admission met with roars of laughter from the chairs in front of her. 
"I learned bravery here," Trigiani said. "Max [Westler] would make us get up and read our poetry in class. I was shy about it but the poetry really helped me. You were getting behind yourself and saying 'This is what I am.'" 


Trigiani was so moved by 
·her own experiences at Saint Mary's that she could not resist a plug for the school in her books. 
Trigiani ended her visit to the Saint Mary's/Notre Dame community as a guest of the Sophomore Literary Festival with a trip to her alma mater, where she spoke with The Observer, met with faculty and friends, and talked to students and staff alike about her expe­
. riences as a writer. "If you keep falling in love with the process of writing it's easy," Trigiani said. "It is such a part of my psychology -If I didn't do it, I'd die. Everything else I do comes from writing." Trigiani graduated from Saint Mary's in 1981 with a degree in Visual and Performing Arts and headed to New York. By the mid-1980's, Trigiani was writing for noted sitcoms like The Cosby Show and A Different World. She supplemented her income by working in the mailrooms of financial institutions. Trigiani wrote, directed, and produced "Queens of the Bigtime," a documentary about her father's family, set in Roseto, Pa. "I was born in Roseto," Trigiani. "We moved to Big Stone Gap when I was little.'' When that film won several awards, she was approached 
with an offer to do her next in a poem she read while at movie. She began work on a Saint Mary's. screenplay that would eventu­"The crux of the book is ally become "Big Stone Gap." when you have a child and

"My mother will babysit while I'm shooting the film," Trigiani said. Both of her par­ents still live in Big Stone Gap. 
"I felt like I needed to be established before I had a baby. A year off now is not going to kill me. I think it all depends on how you live your life."

Actresses Trigiani is consid­ering for the starring role of Ave Maria include Toni Collette, Marisa Tomei, Cate Blanchett, and Jennifer Ehle,

Prejudice.  
Casting  Jack  Mac,  Ave  

Maria's love interest, is more difficult. 
"Jack Mac is the American prototype, the strong silent type," Trigiani said. "As to whether she will film the sec­ond novel as well, Trigiani smiled. 
"We really have to see if we fall in love with the cast of Big Stone Gap,'' she said. "Then we might do it." 
As if that weren't enough to do, Trigiani is also thinking about a fourth novel, to be set in 1950's New York. 
"I already have my fourth book that I want to do," she said. "It's a completely differ­ent vibe. It's about the life of a woman, and takes place in 1950's New York. It is based on a true story, starting in the present and then going back in time." 
Max Westler, Trigiani's old creative writing and poetry professor, admires his former student. 
"She started off small, but there was a progression," Westler said. "You could walk past a dormitory and hear laughter, and you would know Adri was there. Adri is going for nothing less than the entire world. What this world needs is the wisdom that comes with a good laugh."

It's that time of year again when walls are filled with colorful decorations in the elementary schools around the country. No, unfortunately I am not talking about Valentine's Day, but rather Black History Month. Yes, it's that time Elizabeth of year, 28 days

some influence in this country. Twenty-eight days for teachers to pack 
all the information into their restless students' minds that they can about 
blacks in the United States. 
Memories of Black History Month in elementary school bring to my mind thoughts of posters with pictures of famous blacks like Martin Luther King Jr. who received most of his accolades on one day last month, Garrett Morgan, Mary McCloud Bethune, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver and a paragraph at the bottom high­lighting their most well-known accom­plishments. 
Maybe at your school your teacher read a book by a black author or read some book with a main black character like "To Kill A Mockingbird." Maybe your class all got to take a field trip and see the play. Maybe in music class you learned the song "We Shall Overcome" or "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot." 
And maybe if you don't know, or dare I say, don't care, I can see how this would pose a problem. But then my problem would be realizing the irony in trying to celebrate the accomplishments of a race of people for a month whose ancestors, in reality, were from the place where life began. Don't be shocked. I did not mean for this to come as a surprise. Yes, life began in Africa. 
And no, I am not saying this because I am some militant black woman, feeling empowered by 28 or, if we're lucky, 29 days in February. I am saying this because it's an anthropological fact. The bones of the first human, Lucy, a lady about three feet tall, were found in Africa. Did you know that most of the books of the Bible, expect for Luke, were written by people of African descent? Solomon, supposedly the wisest man on earth at the time, was African. 
If one thinks about it, when Joseph took Mary and Jesus to hide from Herod, he took them to Egypt. The last time I checked, Egypt was in Africa. It seems to me that if you are trying to hide from someone, you generally hide somewhere where you wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb. So even if I don't say that Jesus was African, or at least had a couple drops of African blood in there somewhere, I am just saying that Jesus had some color in him. 
But let's get away from all the shock­ing facts about blacks and their descen­dents -I won't even begin to talk about all the accomplishments of the ancient Egyptians: the first surgeries, astrono­my. the architectural mysteries of the pyramids and how they were built. 
I remember when I was little my aunt got me a T-shirt that I wore to Ms. Halloway's third grade class which had names of different objects all across the front and back. The sentence, "Do you know what all these have in common?" was on the front. When I turned the shirt over to see, it said at the bottom on the back, "They are all inventions and discoveries of African-Americans!" 
And just to give you a brief rundown so you don't leave this month without some extra knowledge of the accom­plishments of blacks to show for yourself here are a couple things that a black person invented: the washing machine, the gas mask. the stop light, the folding chair, the propeller for airplanes, the folding bed, the shampoo head rest, interliners to prevent tire punctures, the railway signal apparatus, biscuit cutters, the clothes line support, the jack, the release valve, the coin changer mecha­nism, the rotary engine, the letter box, dough kneaders, stainless steel scouring pads, the locomotive smoke stack, the fitted bed sheet, the spring seat for chairs, the ironing board, the street sweeper and the apparatus for automat­ically transmitting messages over a tele­phone line. 
I could go on, but I'll spare you -all these facts about Africa and blacks might be too much for one day. In 1926 Dr. Carter G. Woodson took the initiative of launching Negro History. He chose the month of February for the celebra­tion because of certain key events that happened for blacks in the month of February throughout history in this country. 
In Feb. 1870, blacks got the right to vote, and in that same year the first black, Hiram R. Revels, took his oath of office. In Feb. 1909. the National · Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was founded by a group of citizens in New York City. 
In 1960, a group of college students began a sit-in at a segregated Woolworth's lunch counter, which would soon become a civil rights mile­stone, and in Feb. 1965, Malcolm X was shot and killed. So since 1926, first known as Negro History Week, blacks have been recognized for contributing to the history of the United States. 
In closing. I guess what this month comes down to, for me, is a certain sense of sadness that all the contribu­tions of blacks to this country have to be crammed into a month and that without this month I would venture to say that they would continue to go unaccounted for. The irony of it all is that we recog­nize the "first" blacks did something when in ancient cultures in Africa. They were already doing things ahead of their time. 
It's strange that black children learn that they came from slaves when some of the greatest kingdoms of the ancient world were in Africa. In history books, our history seems to start with slavery. So while I feel saddened, on the other hand I feel vindicated because we go on learning about the same select group of blacks that history books chose to high­light. 
While history books do highlight a few blacks who did great things here, we were already doing wonderful things there. I don't need 28 days to tell me that I am important and to show me that black people were indeed intelligent enough to think great thoughts, start colleges and invent things. I know the truth.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Show real love for Valentine's 

Valentine's Day is quickly approaching. Are you ready? Have you picked up that special gift for the one you love? Why is it lhat in our society we feel that is such a touchy subject. something to be guard­ed and kept at bay until just the perfect moment arrives when we feel we can truly express ourselves? 
As I wander the store aisles, pink and red goodies, chocolates and flowers abound. Is this a true expres­sion oflove? It seems that in this commercialized world of ours, love has become a sort of commodity. Instead of simply expressing an sense of connection between two people, we seek out that perfect gift to express the love. How about redefining and learning to understand what it means to care about another person so deeply that you worry when they worry or are upset when they are upset? 
This Valentine's Day, why not take a new approach and just love? Why restrict it to one person or that special someone. How about borrowing a lit­tle wisdom from Mother Teresa and doing "small things with love." Ifthere is one thing that I have learned in my four years at this University, it's that love is all around us, but often we are so caught up in our academic lifestyles or making plans for the weekend that we forget to take a moment and appreciate the place that is Notre Dame. We are here at a very special place, a place that I dare say thrives on individuals and yet we never really stop to express that to anyone. 
This Valentine's Day, why not wipe away the barri­ers that we try to place on love and just let it thrive? We have so much education and yet we Jack the abil­ity to express one of the fundamental human emo­tions. How can this be? If any of you have worked with the disabled or seen the movie "I am Sam," per­haps you can relate. Although they may lack a for­mal education or the "book knowledge" that we have all acquired over the years, they have something that we can often only dream of-they have no qualms about showing love to another individual, about sharing that human connection. Maybe it's time that we set those books aside and take 10 minutes out of our day to learn that lesson ourselves. What do you say? 
This Valentine's Day, why not let go ofthe fences which we put on our emotions and just live? May we seek not to do great things, but to do "small things with great love." On Feb. 14 go out and just let go of the social barriers and reconnect with that childlike innocence and the true passion that is love. Tell your friends how much you love them, go out and show those who don't have any family nearby how much you love them, call your family and tell them how much they are loved. Just for one day, forget about the chocolates or the flowers associated with Valentine's Day and just tell someone you love them; reach out and show them how much you really care. For it is then that you might really know what it means to have a Valentine.

Comments on Israeli conflict 
Israel and Palestine both to blame 
I am writing this letter in response to Seth Hiland's Feb. 11 letter entitled, "Arafat should not be tolerated." I do agree that Arafat sh01.ild not be tolerated and that his actions have proven that he is an ineffective leader in the peace process. However, Mr. Hiland's view on the situa­tion as a whole is disturbing. He cites that the "number of Israelis killed by Arab terrorists in the years since the Oslo Accords has been higher than in the 10 years prior." 
He also describes how Israeli efforts of patience do not have anything to show over the past 20 years and describes how Israel has "taken more drastic steps toward holding the Palestinians accountable for their actions." The Palestinians have not agreed to peace and extremists have stepped up suicide bombings in the last 16 months. 
This is all true and cannot be disputed. However, what Mr. Hiland's letter failed to address is that not all Palestinians are evil and not all Israelis are noble. 
So what about the other half of the picture? The Palestinians do not agree to peace because their land, which they believe was given to them by God himself. was not back in their possession. And let us not forget that it was the Palestinians who were forced from their land after World War II to form the state of Israel, which resulted in the refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan and the surrounding area now home to thousands of refugees. 
Don't let the media sway your objectivity of the situa­tion. All you have to do is look at the pictures, not the biased text that is sympathetic to Israel. What do you see when you see Israelis in the Associated Press? You see soldiers with M-16s, reports of Palestinian homes being bulldozed and F-16s bombing buildings. 
What do you see when you see Palestinians in the Associated Press? You see young men 15 to 30 years old throwing rocks with their faces covered to protect from tear gas. What does this tell you about who has the power in this region? It certainly isn't the Palestinians. 
Israel is backed by us. the United States, which is why M-16s and F-16s find their way into the control of an Israeli soldier. Yes, the number of Israelis killed is high­er. but that number pales in comparison to the number of Palestinian civilian casualties. In this conflict, Israel has lost less than 100 soldiers in contrast to over 2,000 Palestinian civilians. 
At any moment, if Israel so chooses. it could annihilate the Palestinians and any combination of nations in the Middle East. The reason that Arafat's forces were caught smuggling in weapons was because they don't have any to fight with. Israel has guns, planes. bulldozers, heli­copters and gunships. Palestinians have rocks. It really isn't a fair fight. 
· Mr. Hiland said that President Bush was wise to side with Sharon, Barak and the rest of Israel. Of course he is and that is the side that will win this fight. But do not for­get that Bush inherited a nation that has a large Jewish population with plenty of representation in both Congress and the Senate, i.e. Senator Joseph Leibermann, which means that it would be political sui­cide if he did not side with Israel. The social and political uproar would be unheard of. 
I do agree with Mr. Hiland on many of his points, mainly that Arafat should be ousted because I do believe he is harboring terrorists and not succeeding as a leader. But try not to be swayed that Israel is a sinless entity. Neither side has been angelic.

America can strongly influence the Middle East 
It is rare to see an American give honest appraisal of Israel's strategy in the ongoing Israeli and Palestinian conflict. In his Feb. 5 letter entitled, "U.S. Middle-East policy dangerously unbalanced," Tony Lusvardi gave us that, showing that Israel has done much in recent months to stoke the violence, that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has consistently pursued a strategy designed escalate the conflict into full-scale war and that a more balanced U.S. policy would serve both American and Middle Eastern interests. On Feb. 11, we saw a response from Seth Hiland, applauding America's one­sided approach. His letter essentially boiled down to one point: Palestinians have also done bad things. 
Hiland's approach to policy making in the Middle East mirrors that of the American media and, sadly, many of our Washington representatives. This consists in choos­ing the morally superior position and unconditionally supporting that side. Ifthis is indeed our strategy, then it is by no means clear that Israel is the more deserving party. Hiland's grossly distorted view of the conflict ignores many historical facts, including those cited in the very article to which he was responding. 
His claim that Israel has been "more than patient" with the Palestinians was effectively refuted in the unan­swered arguments of Lusvardi's original letter, but just in case that list was not sufficient, I will add to it. Israel has continued to place settlers in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in violation of international law and despite the fact that this unquestionably incites the rage of the Palestinians. 
They have shown blatant disregard for human rights. Amnesty International has cited Israel for hundreds of violations in the past year alone, including unlawful arrest, extrajudicial execution and mistreatment of pris­oners. 
They have broken promises. Sharon repeatedly claims to target Palestinian leaders alone, yet his attacks have killed hundreds of non-combatants and children, and his siege of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has destroyed the Palestinian economy and quadrupled unemployment. 
Hiland's call to hold Palestinians accountable for their actions is fair. but should we not be even more con­cerned about the accountability of those who use American tax dollars to fund their atrocities? Perhaps, instead of searching for that elusive moral high ground, we should support the course of action that is most likely to bring peace to the region. Here, again, Lusvardi's call for change is justified. 
He argues that Sharon's policies will plunge the region into war and chaos. Hiland does nothing to rebut this analysis and in fact, he implicitly agrees with it, but evi­dently thinks that this is an acceptable price to pay if it ensures the punishment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Those with less vindictive motivations would do well to recognize that peace must start somewhere, and Arafat, currently trapped under house arrest, will find it difficult to persuade his people to ensure security for a nation that continues to bombard their villages and besiege their towns. 
Significant changes are called for on both sides, but. as Israel's primary financial supporter, this is clearly the place where the United States has the most potential to make a difference. If we demand changes -an end to assassinations, for example, or a freeze on settlement building -then Israel will have no choice but to comply or face losing the resources that have made their mili­tary dominance possible in the first place. 
Given Sharon's present course, such changes could only be an improvement. They would also, by the way, be in our own country's best interests. Given our current international ambitions, America has nothing to gain and everything to lose by appearing to support Israel to the detriment of all Arab interests. 
Peace in the Middle East is, unfortunately, a far-off goal. Nonetheless. our country is now too deeply involved to ignore the wider ramifications of the state­ments that we make and the checks that we write. Are the Israelis and Palestinians moving closer to a solution or is the situation deteriorating even further beyond recall? Whether we like it or not, it may be America that decides.

Cyrano and country classics can reclaim Valentine's Day 
Ah. love. 

Such a wonderful, mysterious phenomenon. For those of us who own stock in Hallmark or have a significant other, February snow is romantic and dreamy. For everyone else, it can accentuate embit­tered and hopeless feelings about Cupid ignoring us for the rest of 

eternity and spending the rest of our days in solitude. 
But St. Valentine never meant to damage our fragile, hormonal egos, and being single should be celebrated just as passionately as being in love. 
Instead of boycotting February 14, I've come up with a list of comforting and festive rituals to engage in, so that nobody has to send themselves sweetheart roses or leave love messages on their own dry erase boards. Valentine's Day is about love, not resentment. 
1. Read "Cyrano de Bergerac." 
For the type of single who wallows in sor­row on V-Day, reading this classic is the per-feet remedy for putting your own measly problems in perspective. Here is unrequited love, being too shy to approach someone,

falling in love with your cousin. If you're short on time and don't want to read the play, the Clitrs Notes are available in the bookstore. If you're short on time and also broke, you can stand there and read the synopsis of the play. 
Bottom line is, Cyrano was desperately in love and possessed great charisma, but had a nose which could be described as "a rock -a crag -a cape .... a peninsula!" The moral is clear: don't judge people by their noses, and you may find true love. There is too much emphasis placed on appearance by this society in general, to say nothing of our campus where there are many beautiful people walk­ing around the quad. Give someone a chance, or else you might inad­vertently pass up your soul mate {see No. 4). 
2. Get yourself a pre-emptive SYR date. 

Even if you don't have an impending formal or SYR, you can never be too prepared. Be creative. The next time you're in the presence of members of the opposite sex, quickly assess their potential fun factor and then take the plunge. Prime opportunities include a lull in class, walking across South Quad, in the library, waiting for your waffie to bake, etc. If he or she accepts, then you can feel good about being single and free to ask any old random to your dances. If you get shot down, eat a Whitman's Sampler and proceed to No. 3. 
3. Go country. 

Too often at this school, we hear some variation of the line, "I like all music ... except for country." Before the criticism begins, let me clarify that I have yet to hear a country song about somebody's dog dying. (The tractor thing is true, but still.) No other genre of music could have possibly produced so many different love songs for so many situations. 
Are you in love? Reveling in singleness? Broken heart? No doubt about it, there's no better way to pick yourself up from rejection or loneliness than a little bit of Garth and two pina coladas. 
4. Find your soul mate. 

While this may sound alarming, bear in mind the Notre Dame sta­tistics for meeting a future spouse. I've heard both 50 percent and two-thirds, which translates into keep your eyes wide open. Whether pr not you believe in love at first sight or the idea that we're destined to be with a certain person for the rest of our lives, the fact is that there are a lot of girls here. And a lot of guys. And you pass hun­dreds of them every day without a second glance. 
Think about the possibilities! Girls, consider the 55:45 ratio as promised in the brochure. Guys, think about how every single party is packed with 62 females for every three males. (How does that hap­pen?) This goes along with the idea of Cyrano and SYRs -keeping an open mind and maybe getting lucky. 
5. Call home. 

Who made the rule that Valentine's Day love had to be romantic? The first people who ever loved you don't even expect you to buy them Godiva or serenade them with Billy Joel songs in public. So call your parents. Or if this approach sounds a little drastic, call your other relatives or friends from home who don't get to go to Notre Dame, and tell them how much you miss them. 
These are only suggestions, of course, so if you feel the need to be miserable about singledom, then don't crank up the country. However, having fun with this much-hated, much-loved holiday may get you a date, or at the very least some warm fuzzies.

Don't despair at the ND/SMC dating scene 
By JULIE BENDER 
Scene Wricet 

We've all been through it. 
You fidget uncomfortably in class, every now and then throwing a nervous glance at that cute certain someone over in the corner. You hope to make eye contact and have that mutual explosion of fireworks and instanta­neous love. but when you actually do make eye contact, it's a different story. 
Caught off-guard, you quickly avert your eyes in a rather violent head swing, only to sneak a quick look back to see if your crush is still looking. Instead of focusing on the biology professor's rant about hormones, your mind is constantly thinking of scenarios for you to "accidentally" bump into your crush in the halls. 
You envision a romantic encounter in which you will sweep him or her off of their feet with your endearing charm and lovable nature. Of course, once again, when the opportunity presents itself, your throat closes up and all you can muster is a quick "pardon me" as you rush off with scarlet cheeks. 
Ah... the torture of love. It seems that here at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, everyone is feeling a bit discouraged lately. Maybe it's just the time of year (Valentine's Day can do it) or maybe it's just the student body in gen­eral. 
Everyone has a complaint about how diffi­cult it is to find a good date here on campus. Ask anyone about the dating scene and you're bound to get a roll of the eyes and the bitter comment of "it sucks" thrown back at you. Girls complain about boys. Boys complain about girls. It seems to be a vicious cycle. 
Of course, there are the selected few that do have a boyfriend or girlfriend on campus. Perhaps they were lucky varies so widely based on who is describing it. Someone involved in a relationship is likely to be pretty optimistic, whereas someone who has been unlucky in that category will generalize dating as a negative experience. According to Notre Dame freshman Sarah Brown, much of the difficulty with dating stems from the stark lines separating the genders on cam­pus. 

"Relations between guys and girls on campus are pretty strained," s a i d Brown. ''Just look around the din­ing hall." 
This is a valid point. A glance around the dining hall clear­ly reveals the divi­s i o n s between males and females.

It's enough to make you want to scream or cry about the unfairness of it all. When did dating become so diffi­
cult? When did it lose the magic it once had? It always seemed so perfect on the te1evision programs growing up. The hit show "Saved by the Bell" always portrayed teenage drama so well. Every episode provided some sort of fias­co between Zack and Kelly, with 
A.C. Slater getting involved in one way or another. 
Lisa and Screech were a great pair as well. Screech was such a gentleman when he took Lisa to the sock-hop even when she had a broken ankle. Why can't dating be as easy as that? Reality never seems to live up to its television counterpart. 
Students at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's agree, for tho most part, that the dating scene here is pretty weak. It is difficult to assess Notre Dame's dating with that of other schools because opinion

to meeting the love of your life. 
Somehow gyrating to ear­pounding dance music in a dark, sweaty room with a strobe light doesn't lend itself to formulating long-term 
relationships. 
Freshman Shantha Ready summed up the situation: ·'Crowded dorm parties are definite­

With the odds stacked against finding a nice, decent date here, how does one manage to find a girlfriend or boyfriend? There's also 
her senior year sophomore 
year, Elizabeth 
finally relented 

and took Rudy up on his offer. 
Though neither could have imagined it, the relationship took off. The couple went to each other's dances and even found for themselves a tree on campus where they could take their lunches to be alone. 
Their relationship has endured right through to their senior year. Rudy is now such a common sight on the third floor of Lyons Hall where Elizabeth is an R.A. that some have been heard to comment that Lyons has started admitting male residents. 
In addition to this, the third floor's section event during fall semester study days was to witness the Zahm bun run through Lafortune, since Rudy, a Zahm resident, was an organizer and participant of the event. 
This past October, Elizabeth and Rudy's relationship took a new twist. On a particu­larly warm autumn afternoon, the couple returned to their tree for a picnic, for old time's sake. As the couple lunched on sand­wich es and fruit, Rudy subtly called Elizabeth's attention to the tree. Glancing up haphazardly, Elizabeth's eye caught some­thing etched into the bark. 
Squinting for a closer look, Elizabeth read the words aloud: "Will you marry me?" Rudy then knelt down before the astonished Elizabeth and taking her hands, uttered the words himself. In the midst of a flood of emo­tions, Elizabeth managed to choke out her "Yes" before the tears of happiness arrived. 
The pair then was met by a surprise gath­ering of Lyons girls for an engagement cele­

in mind that this is not a one-case scenario. Dating here at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's isn't a hopeless cause. 

It may take a little effort, but getting past the first step is always the most difficult. As Elizabeth herself said, "If it hap­pened for me, it can happen for anyone!" 
So next time you're feeling down as you look at the happy couples around you, just remem­ber that it's not impossible. 
After all, Rudy didn't let Elizabeth's refusals deter him from his goal. He shamelessly persisted, and he got the girl. Just like the football chant: "Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!"

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL NBA 
Sale of two teams approved 
. Loria sells Expos to league, then purchases Marlins 
Associated PreS> 
NEW YORK 
Baseball owners approved the sales of the Florida Marlins and Montreal Expos on Tuesday, setting the stage for the teams to hire new managers and front offices just three days before spring training starts, 
John Henry, whose group was given approval last month to buy the Boston Red Sox for $660 million from the Jean R. Yawkey Trust, is sell­ing the Marlins to Jeffrey Loria for $158.5 million. 
Loria is selling the Montreal franchise to Baseball Expos LP -a Delaware limited partnership owned by the other 29 teams -for $120 million, with the commission­er's office loaning him the difference between the prices. 
Even though the sales won't officially close until later this week, baseball commissioner Bud Selig immediately announced a new manage­ment team for the Expos: team president Tony Tavares, vice president and general manager Omar Minaya and manager Frank Robinson. 

Jeff Torborg, who had been the Expos' manager, was hired as the Marlins' manag­er and Larry Beinfest, who had been Montreal's interim general manager, became Florida's senior vice presi­dent and general manager, David Samson, Loria's step­son and the Expos' executive vice president, became the Marlins' president. 
Loria will become the third owner of the Marlins, who began play in 1993 and won the World Series in 1997. Founding owner H. Wayne Huizenga, frustrated he couldn't get government funding for a new ballpark, sold the team to Henry in 1999. 
"Our commitment to the Marlins and to the South Florida community is com­
plete," Loria said. "Our intent is to succeed by doing what­ever is necessary to ensure that the fans will enjoy a relationship with the Marlins for generations to come." 
Baseball owners originally intended to fold the Expos and Minnesota Twins, to teams that also have failed to gain government funding for new ballparks, but a Minnesota judge issued an injunction that forced the Twins to honor their 2002 lease at the Metrodome. 
The ownership changes in Boston and Florida left the Expos with no owner, leading the commissioner's office to take the unprecedented step of operating a major league team for an entire season. 
"I am very pleased with the management team that we have assembled," Selig said in a statement. "They have long experience in the game and they are first rate in every way. Now that they are in place, they will have the authority to operate the club with complete autonomy." 
Tavares, who quit last month as president of the Anaheim Angels and the NHL's Mighty Ducks, will submit a budget similar to Expos' budgets of recent years. According to the com­missioner's office, Tavares "will have complete and inde­pendent operating control over the club and the bud­get." 
Minaya. who had been senior assistant general man­ager of the New York Mets, becomes the first Hispanic general manager in the major leagues and the sec·ond minority, joining Kenny Williams of the Chicago White Sox. who is black. 
Robinson, a 66-year-old Hall of Farner, had been the vice president in the commis­sioner's office in charge of disciplining players, man­agers and coaches for on­field misconduct. He is the only player to win Most Valuable Player awards in both leagues and is fourth on the career home run list at 
586. He spent parts of 11 seasons as manager of the 
Indians, San Francisco Giants and Baltimore Orioles, com­piling a 680-751 record. 
Montreal's only holdover in senior management will be Claude Delorme, promoted to executive vice president of business affairs from vice president of development and stadium operations. 
Selig at first contemplated having owners meet Tuesday in the Chicago area, but some teams didn't want to travel for a vote in which tho out­come was certain. Some teams already had mailed in their votes before the call. 
Owners approved these deals with a speed unprece­dented in recent decades. The Red Sox sale, agreed to on Dec. 20, was approved at a Jan. 16 meeting in Phoenix by a 29-0 vote, with the Yankees abstaining. 
Henry's sale of the Marlins to Loria was approved even though they don't yet have a signed agreement. 
But the start of spring training put pressure on baseball to speed the trans­actions. The Marlins and Expos open camp Friday, and Loria and Henry hope to close of the Marlins' sale by then. 
Meanwhile, Selig will not testify at Wednesday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the sport's antitrust exemption and instead will send his chief lawyer. 
DuPuy and union head Donald Fehr are among wit­nesses scheduled to appear, a spokesman for committee chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D­Vt .. said Monday. 
Also scheduled to testify are Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, Minnesota Deputy Attorney General Lori Swanson, and Stan Brand, a lobbyist for the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, the gov­erning body of the minor leagues. 
Sen. Paul D. Wellstone, D­Minn .. and Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich,, proposed legis­lation Nov. 14 to strip base­ball of its antitrust exemption as it applies to franchise moves and folding, 
Bryant faces boos 
in return home 
Associaced Press 

PHILADELPHIA 
Kobe Bryant should wear ear plugs the next time he comes to the First Union Center because fans plan to keep boo­ing him. 
Philadel­phia fans ­the few thou­sand who actually got tickets to Sunday's NBA All-Star game booed the Los Angeles Lakers guard when he was introduced, continued whenev­er he fook a shot early in the game, then did it almost every time he touched the ball in the second half. 
When commissioner David Stern presented Bryant with the MVP trophy for scoring 31 points and leading the West to a 135-120 victory over the East, the boos were long and loud. 
Bryant. who went to nearby Lower Merion High School, and whose father, Joe, played for the 76ers, was visibly shak­en and later admitted he was 
"hurt." 

But what has he done to deserve such venom from a city known for its boorish behavior? 
It goes beyond the "coming to Philly to cut their hearts out" comment he made during the NBA finals last season, when the Lakers beat the Sixers in five games. 
Some fans simply don't con­sider Bryant one of their own. others view him as a sellout because he only comes back to Philadelphia when the Lakers play here, and a few just resent his success. 
"Kobe didn't go to Simon Gratz or Overbrook, he didn't go to Germantown Academy, he didn't go to Roman Catholic," Sixers fan Willie Russell said Monday. referring to some Philadelphia-area schools. "Kobe went to Lower Merion. He isn't from Philly. 

He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth." 
Brvant was born in Philadelphia, but spent eight years of his childhood in Italy before returning to go to high school. He skipped college, entered the 1996 NBA draft, and quickly established him­self as one of the best players in the league. 
A four-time All-Star, Bryant 
has won two straight champi­
onships with the Lakers. And, 
he's only 23. 
Some fans still hold a grudge because he chose the draft over going to school at La Salle, where his father was an assistant coach. or another of the city's Big 5 colleges. 
"Michael Jordan grew up in North Carolina and went to North Carolina. Allen Iverson grew up in Virginia and went to Georgetown. Kobe didn't do that," Sixers and Temple fan Alvin Stewart said, ignoring the fact that Philly favorite and Portland star Rasheed Wallace shunned Temple to go to North Carolina. 
The fans' actions at the game prompted Philadelphia Mayor John Street to call Bryant on Monday. 
"I want you to know that you are highly respected and loved in the city of Philadelphia," Street said. "We want you to come back in the offseason so that we can show you how much we appreciate what you've done for the game and the thousands of kids who look up to you as a role model." 
Philadelphians are blue-col­lar fans and they love an underdog -a real-life Rocky Balboa that they can relate to. 
They appreciate Allen Iverson for his grit and deter­mination more than Hall of Farner Julius Erving because the game came easier for Dr. J. They revered Pete Rose for his hustle more than Hall of Farner Mike Schmidt because he had a more casual approach. Eric Lindros could never live up to Bobby Clarke because he didn't play with the same zest and zeal, though he had more skilL

need is all three of them to have a big game on the same day." 
That kind of an all-around performance could come tonight. St. John's is coming of a 12-game losing skid, as compared to Notre Dame's five-game winning streak. But, after close calls against both Seton Hall and Pittsburgh on the road, McGraw is not so ready to call this an easy win. 
"[Against Pittsburgh] I thought 'This'll be a good chance for us to play a lot of people,' but we didn't defend well," she said. "I don't think you can ever look at a game and say this is what's going to happen." 
To play a good defensive game, the Irish post players will have to be aware of the Red Storm's offense. St. John's post players hit jumpers, looking, at times, more like perimeter players. 
"They present some problems for our post defensively," McGraw said. 
But coming out of one of its best defensive efforts of the season, the Irish should be able to handle the change. On Sunday the Notre Dame played very little zone, a defense they've been able to make use of this season, because of Boston College's outside shot. 
But tonight they should be able to change up their defensive style. 
"I think we'll be able to do a little bit more in terms of switching things up [defensively] and playing some zone," McGraw said. 
Tip-off is 7 p.m. at the Joyce Center where the Irish have a 49-game winning streak. 
Notes: 
. Sophomore guard Jeneka Joyce is listed as questionable for tonight's game. After return­ing from an Achilles Heel injury against Boston College on Sunday, pain in her foot may pre­vent her from playing against St. John's.

Friedgen withdraws from Bucs coaching list 
l'i 

Associated Press 
COLLEGE PARK, Md. 

Maryland's Ralph Friedgen withdrew his name from consid­eration for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' head coaching opening Tuesday. 
Friedgen, fresh off leading Maryland to a 10-2 record in his first season as a head coach, met with officials of the Buccaneers on Monday. 
f'riedgen is the latest in a series of coaches interviewed by the Buccaneers, who are seek­ing a replacement for Tony Dungy, fired last month after the team's first-round playoff loss in Philadelphia. The Bucs already talked to former NFL coach Bill Parcells and Marvin Lewis. 
Parcells backed away from the offer and Lewis, then defensive coordinator for the Baltimore Ravens, was ultimately shunned. 
Then, less than 24 hours after speaking with the sons of Bucs owner Malcolm Glazer, Friedgen announced that he was staying put. 
"It's very flattering to be con­sidered after so many years of

Fricdgen, speaking in a news conference at the university, said he was never formally offered the Bucs job, and never discussed financial terms with the Glazers. But he said he agreed to the meeting out of curiosity. 
"It's something you have to look into from a monetary standpoint," he said.

Friedgen signed a 10-year contract with Maryland in December after leading the Terrapins to their first Atlantic Coast Conference title since 1986 and a berth in the Orange Bowl. Two days after signing the extension, Friedgen was named Associated Press College Coach of the Year. 
Lewis. who later accepted a job as defensive coordinator of the Washington Redskins, criti­cized the Bucs on Monday for their handling of the coaching search. 
"It was a meeting that was already set one way," Lewis said of his session with the sons of Bucs owner Malcolm Glazer.

FitzRandolph takes gold in 500 meters 

Associated Pres 
KEARNS, Utah 

As Casey FitzRandolph turned into the 
final curve, an orange cone suddenly ric­
ocheted off his right clapskatc. He wob­
bled a bit, his left hand dangling along 
the ice as he struggled to stay upright. 
Dan Jansen revisited? No way. 
FitzRandolph had come too far to suffer 
another disappointment. 
Erasing his own agony from Nagano, 
FitzRandolph won the 500 meters 
Tuesday in a stirring speedskating duel 
with defending Olympic gold medalist 
1-Iirovasu Shimizu. 
"There's too many things going 
through my head and they're not sticking 
around long enough to grasp any of 
them," FitzRandolph said. ''I guess I real­
ize that I just won the gold modal." 
He gave the United States its first 
speedskating victory of the Salt Lake City 
Games, and it came with an unexpected 
bonus -unheralded teammate Kip 
Carpenter took the bronze. 
FitzRandolph persevered through a 
mistake-filled pairing with Carpenter, 
the most glaring glitch coming at the ·start of the last turn. 
Carpenter cut the corner too tight as he 
switched to the outside lane, his left knee 
catching the small pylon that divides the 
lanes. It flew into FitzRandolph's right 
skate, nearly causing him to fall. 
He managed to stay on his feet, though 
he swung wide out of the turn and sent 
another lane marker flying. 
"I didn't have a great race," 
FitzRandolph said. "I knew I had to drop 
the hammer and just go for it." 
FitzRa11dolph became America's first 500 champion since Eric Heiden won all five events in 1980. Jansen was favored in three straight Olympics, but a fall, a slip and a slushy track denied him a medal in his favorite event. 
"I think D.J. should have gotten one." FitzRandolph said. 
But enough of the bad memories. The Americans have three medals through the first three events at the Utah Olympic Oval. putting the home team in excellent position to reach its goal of 10 medals, including the short-track competition. 
The speedskating squad, which has never won more than eight medals, leads traditional powers the Netherlands and Germany, which have two apiece. 
FitzRandolph edged Shimizu by a mere 
0.03 seconds -about the length of a skate. The blonde-haired, blue-eyed Wisconsin native threw up his arms when he saw the final standings, break­ing out ina smile that appeared more relief than jubilation. 
FitzRandolph skated an Olympic­record 34.42 seconds and had a 0.19 advantage over Shimizu after the first round Monday. Ile needed the entire cushion to hold off the world-record holder, who had the second-best time of Day 2. 
FitzRandolph crossed the line in 34.81 for a two-day total of 1 minute, 9.23 sec­onds, another Olympic mark. Shimizu skated the llaps in 34.65, giving him a 
1:09.26 total. 
"I really could have done better. I feel a bit of regret," the Japanese star said. "I was not able to give it my ultimate. I didn't even come close to my own world record." 
Street finishes 16th in Olympic finale 
Associated Press 
SNOWBASIN, Utah 
Picabo Street, her star-spangled pony­tail flapping as she sped down the Wildflower course, finished 16th in her Olympic finale Tuesday -even trailing two U.S. teammates. 
"This is the last race of my career," she said. 'Tm not going to have to live with­out skiing. I'm just going to have to live without trying to be perfect on my skis everyday, which is wonderful." 
Street, who was trying to become the first American woman to win three Olympic skiing medals, had the best time at the top of the mountain, but lost speed in the middle of the course as she fought to control her skis. 
After blowing kisses through her hel­met to the wildly cheering crowd, she grabbed a microphone and thanked the fans. 
"This is the best day in my ski racing career and it's because of you. Thank you," she said. "Thanks Mom and Dad, you always supported me. You waited for that phone call at 4 o'clock in the morn­ing. And you won't have to wait any more, because I'll be home." 
Street finished behind compatriots Jonna Mendes, who was 11th, and Kirsten Clark, who was 12th. The fourth 
U.S. skier, Caroline Lalive, missed a gate near the bottom of the course and did not finish. 
The winner was a shocker. Carole Montillet of France, who has never won a World Cup downhill, won in 1 minute, 
39.56 seconds. 
Isolde Kastner of Italy was second in 1:40.01, and Renate Goetschl of Austria won bronze in 1:40.39 in a race post­poned from Monday because of high winds. The start of the race also was delayed more than two hours Tuesday by gusting winds. 
Montillet's victory was salve for a 

French squad that has been in mourning since the October death of team leader Regine Cavagnoud, killed in a training accident. 
Montillet, 28, went to San Diego for a few days before the Olympics, leaving the World Cup circuit, telling friends she needed to get away from the repeated questions about Cavagnoud. 
"I still think of Regine Cavagnoud and I will continue to do so. She will always be in my heart and on my mind," said Montillet, who carried the French flag at the opening ceremony Friday and was wrapped in a blue, white and red French flag in the finish area Tuesday. 
For the 30-year-old Street, it was remarkable that she was even racing. 
A month after her victory in the super giant slalom at the 1998 Nagano Games, she broke her left leg and mangled her right knee in a crash and was off skis for 21 months. 
She got off to a good start Tuesday, posting the best results at the first two timing spots and quickly getting into the tight tuck position that allows her to glide so quickly down hills. 
But she flew a bit high at the first of the course's jumps and then struggled to maintain her balance as she left a trail of snow in her wake. She also was too high off the second jump. losing crucial time. 
After she crossed the finish line, she stared at the scoreboard in disbelief and then lowered her head. But then sh·e waved both hands to the crowd and blew kisses. 
Street was trying to become the first 
U.S. skier to win medals in three Olympics. She won the silver in the down­hill at Lillehammer in 1994 and a gold in the Super G in 1998. 
The prospect of an Olympic farewell on home snow motivated her through her comeback, a process she was all too familiar with after blowing out a knee twice before.

ND WOMEN'S SOCCER 
Two defenders honored 
. Gonzalez, Pruzinsky named Academic All-Americans 
Special to The Observer 
Two Notre Dame women's soccer player s have been rec­ognized as Academic All­Americans for the 2001-02 academic year, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America. 
Junior defender Vanessa Pruzinsky -who impressively has maintained her 4.0 cumu­lative grade-point average as a chemical engineering major ­repeated as a first team Academic All-American. 
Fifth-year defender Monica Gonzalez became the 38th all­time student-athlete in Notre Dame history to earn All­America and Academic All­America honors for the same season. She was a second team All-American and third team Academic All-American. 
Pruzinsky joins former bas­ketball star Bob Arnzen (1967 and 1968) as just the second student-athlete in Notre Dame's storied Academic All­America history to be named a first team Academic All­American as both a sophomore and junior. Arnzen closed out his career by making the first team for a third time in 1969. 
Notre Dame was one of just six schools that placed multiple player on the 33-member Academic All-America teams, with Notre Dame and Nebraska being the only schools from that group that were ranked in the national top 25. 

Gonzalez is the fourth Notre Dame women's student-athlete to recently complete the unique All-America and Academic All­America distinction, with soft­ball players Jarrah Myers and Jen Sharron and women's bas­ketball standout Ruth Riley doing so in the spring of 2001. 
Gonzalez joins former goal­keeper Jen Renola as Notre Dame's second women's soccer player to receive both honors in the same season. Renola is one of just seven ND student-ath­letes from all sports to do so in multiple seasons. 
Notre Dame women's soccer players have combined for 10 Academic All-America honors during the past eight seasons, with the pervious seven years of the awards coming under the fall and winter "at-large" program. 
Renola and forward Amy Van Laecke earned 2nd-team hon­ors following their junior sea­son and were 1st-team selec­tions as seniors, with Renola named the Academic All­American of the Year. 
Jenny Streiffer then earned 1st-team honors after the 1997 season and was a 2nd-team pick as a junior while another Irish forward, Meotis Erikson, was a 3rd-team selection for the 2000 season. 
Pruzinsky was one of five players with 4.0 GPAs that were named to the 2001-02 Academic All-America squad, including fellow first teamers Katharina Lindner (Hartford) and Llza Nowoslawski (UAB). 
A two-time second team NSCAA all-region selection. Pruzinsky also earned first team all-BIG EAST Conference honors in 2001 and was a final ist for the Missouri Athletic Club National Player-of-the­Year Award. She has started 71 of 72 games during her ND career and registered her first goal at Notre Dame in the 2-1 loss at Rutgers before scoring again in the NCAA loss to Cincinnati. 
Gonzalez -who was the 11th overall selection in Monday's player draft for the Women's United Soccer Association -capper her career with NSCAA second team All-America honors before posting a 3.62 semester GPA and graduating with a 
3.39 cumulative GPA, as a dou­ble major in management information systems and Spanish. 
A founding member of Mexico's women's national team, Gonzalez joined Pruzinsky as a central defender in 2001, when she started all 21 games while scoring once and adding two assists. She totaled 17 goals and 17 assists in 95 career games played, with 49 starts. 
Gonzalez and Pruzinsky com­bined with freshman Candace Chapman as just the sec9nd trio of Notre Dame defenders to be named NSCAA all-region in the same season. The 2001 Irish defense allowed just 18 goals in 21 games, including nine shutouts and eight other games with one goal allowed.

Improved Irish ready for Red Storm 
..... By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Spom Editor 

After dropping out of the rankings in early December, the Irish have been playing the underdog role. They've defeated three ranked opponents in the last three weeks and now they'll have the top spot going into tonight's game against St. John's. 
With the Irish ranked 23rd in Associated Press bal­
.... loting and second in the Big East, tonight's game may be more about Notre Dame's play than the play of the 3-20 Red Sturm, who are ranked last in the Big East. 
"We've got to focus on us," said head coach Muffet McGraw. "That's our primary concern ... There are some things coming out of the Boston College game that we feel we can do better at." 
At this point in the season, although the Irish have made strides to 15-7, McGraw is still looking for improvement in her team. The Irish have strung together several strong offensive appearances and many solid defensive performances. 
However, they don't seem to be coming in tandem. 
"I want to see great defense and great offense in the same game, that's what I really want," McGraw said. "We've had a lot of games where we've played one or the other." 
A combined defensive and offensive effort isn't all McGraw wants from her team. She wants a team effort -period. Post players Jacqueline Batteast, Ericka Haney and Teresa Borton have all taken their turns being the go-to player, scoring on the block and really helping the team out. But McGraw would like to see a game where all three play well on the same night. 
"I think the problem is, it's been different people and I would like it to be all of them," McGraw said. "Teresa's had some big games; Ericka's had some big games; Jackie's had some big games. So what we

Belles confident heading into Adrian game 

By JOE HETTLER 
Sports Writer 

When Saint Mary's faces off against Adrian tonight, it will be a battle between a team with confidence and a team that has been struggling. 
The Belles are the confident team com­ing off a 65-61 win over Olivet College on Saturday and winners of two of their last three while Adrian has lost two straight games. 
The reason for the Belles' recent suc­cess has been defense and rebounding, according to head coach Suzanne Smith. 
"The main thing is that we've played great defense and rebounding," said Smith. "We've done a much better job the last couple of weeks of boxing out and going to get the rebound." 
While the Belles were out-rebounded last game, they feel they can improve on that against Adrian. 
"In our defense we do a lot of rotating aro4nd," said Smith. "Many times that leaves someone open and we just really talked about going back and finding your person and making sure everybody's matched up and they box out their per­son and put a body on them." 
Aside from rebounding, the Belles will rely on another outstanding perfor­mance from freshman forward Emily Creachbaum. Creachbaum scored 26 points against Olivet, which included 11­15 shooting from the field. 
Creachbaum's performance was good enough to earn her an honorable men­tion for MIAA Player of the Week hon­ors. 
"She's just real consistent," said Smith. "She's not trying to do too much but it seems like the opponent's defense is giv­ing her some great opportunity's and she's taking advantage of everything." 
The Belles are hoping to continue play­ing well and pick up some victories before heading into the MIAA tourna­ment on Feb. 19. 
"We're focused on Wednesday night first, said Smith. "We haven't really gone to Saturday yet. But tomorrow night it's a great opportunity. I know one of the team's words today was revenge because it was a close game last time. So we really want this one tomorrow night."
