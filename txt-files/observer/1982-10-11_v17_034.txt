The 4-year-old brother of a toddler killed at Rome's main synagogue battled for his life yesterday as police searched for five "professional commandos" who cut down 36 other people in the grenade and submachine gun attack. Police said they are looking for five men, probably of Middle Eastern origin, and that they suspect that Black June or another Palestinian terrorist group may be behind the attack. Four-year-old Gadiel Tache, who had been earlier identified as Gabriele and then Marco in the confusion that followed the attack Saturday, was shot in the head and chest. He was reported in critical condition at Rome's San Camillo hospital. Doc­tors said he has lost his right eye and may lose his right arm. Gadiel's 2-year-old brother Stefano was hit by shrapnel and died shortly after. Officials added three other names to the wounded toll yesterday, bringing the total to 37. -AP 
An "erratic" man holdingtwo children hostage in an Amtrak sleeper car stuck his head out ofa window, displayed a white sheet and accepted food for the first time in the three-day standoff. The thin, bare-chested, bare-legged man yelled in Spanish and waved his arm in a circular motion for about 10 seconds while leaning out ofa window police had broken open earlier. He did not display a gun and police don't know what kind ofweapon he has with him. The man had fired at least 1 5 shots at police during the standoff, and said yesterday that he had 24 bullets left. After pulling down the window shade and leaving the sheet hanging outside, the man, iden­tified as Mario Rodriguez, 29, talked with police by radio. The gun­man, who claimed at various times that a woman and a man in the tiny compartment had been shot or dead, was heard to say in 
Spanish, "Don't shoot. Don't shoot. I want water." -AP 
Brush fires fanned by hot, dry Santa Ana winds rushed from ridge to ridge across Southern California during the weekend, injuring 147 people and destroying 122 homes before dying down yesterday, authorities said. Thousands of people fled choking smoke and red ash blown by screaming, gale-force winds. Property damage was put at !36 millon. At least four of the seven fires were set, authorities said. The fires crackled through more than 74,000 acres of brush-covered hills and tinder-dry valleys in five counties and sent blankets of smoke and soot across the sky all weekend. At least a half-dozen firefighters were among the injured. Several horses were killed by motorists racing from fires, officials said. Firefighters, battling the blaze on the ground 1,000 strong, got a 
break yesterday when the winds dropped off from their high of60 
mph. That allowed eight planes and four helicopters equipped with 
water tankers to take to the sky for the first time. -AP 
Longtime women's activist Judy Goldsmith 
won the presidency ofthe National Organization for Women yester­
day and pledged to mold American feminists into a political force to 
defeat President Reagan and "right-wing" politicians. Goldsmith, 
NOW's executive vice president, bested four other candidates 
including firebrand Sonia Johnson in the voting by the nearly 2,000 
delegates to the group's convention in Indianapolis. She will 
succeed Eleanor Smeal. The victory by the 43-year-old Manitowoc, 
Wis., native signals that NOW will continue the electoral focus 
begun by Smeal, who had privately endorsed Goldsmith's candidacy. 
That political emphasis includes major involvement in the off-year 
elections next month and a commitment to working toward 1984. "I 
see the (NOW) election results as a very strong mandate for a con­
tinuation ofour electoral, political and economic direction that we 
have taken in the last year," Goldsmith said yesterday at a news con­
ference. -AP 

Defense ministers of the six-nation Gulf

cil are Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman, 
all conservative states. It is expected that the Airborne Warning and

States will form the nucleus of a defense strategy. Sources who did 
not want to be identified said the Saudis also were expected to 
propose using U.S. made Hawk missiles in a unified air defense sys­

Heavy shooting eruptedin Kampala, the Ugan­dan capital, Saturday night and the official radio said yesterday it was caused by drunken soldiers and police, some of whom were ar­rested. "The exercise offinding those responsible in various parts of Kampala continues," according to the broadcast monitored in Nairobi. The drunken revelry was apparently connected with celebrations Saturday marking 20 years of independence from Britain. Kampala residents reached by telephone from Nairobi said there was some panic in the Ugandan capital and initial speculation that a coup attempt or guerrilla attack was under way. -AP

The Art of Engineering 
Engineering students are thrust into the world of 
specialization long before they understand what 
engineering is all about. 
Someone, for example, once asked me what kind of 
engineering I wanted to study, when I wanted to ask 
someone else what engineers study in the first place. 
That's why I laugh when I hear freshmen engineers 
proclaim to be "biomedical genetic engineers" or some 
other overly specific label, and I wonder why they so 
readily leave the world of the general at such an early 
stage. 
Freshmen engineers, after all, belong in the world of the general. Professor A. E. Miller is quietly doing his part to see that they stay there. 
He's the coordinator of the freshmen introductory course in engineering, EG 120, "Introduction to Engineering Concepts." And he wants his students to get a general grasp of what engineers do and how they do it before some scheduling counselor asks for specialization. 
"Some students come in here terribly naive about engineering," says Miller. "They don't have relatives who are engineers, and they don't have much mechani­cal experience." That's 
why it was a bit of a shock Engineering problems are last August when Miller and not like calculus problems the other EG 120 professor, in that there isn't one John Lucey, walked into answer or one approach. En­their classes and announced gineers have to pull from a that at the end of the semes­whole bag oftricks and skills ter, any student would have in order to do their job.

picture and boil it down so that any student fresh out of high school can see if he's kind of got a feel for that." That "feel" is what engineering is really all about -in general terms; and appropriately, that's what Miller is trying to introduce to his prospective engineers. 
The "power plant" approach represents a positive step toward the third era in the history ofEG 120. When engineer-professors Gadja and Biles premiered their 400-page introduction to engineering textbook in 1978, they closed the door on the first era -when EG 120 was nothing but an introduction to FORTRAN programming. 
Gadja and Biles thought that a three credit course ought to integrate programming with other engineer­ing skills to give students an even broader overview of engineering problems. 
So for four years -the second era -engineering students have muddled through assignments on modelling, optimization, function searches, and economic analysis in addition to FORTRAN program­ming. If you hate this stuff, the EG 120 theory goes,

This meeting will be held in the comfortable Library Auditorium. 
Come with your gripes, ideas, and suggestions. 

engineering probably is not your bag of tricks. That's the theory anyway. But both Miller and students won­der if the strictly textbook approach gave a better un­derstanding of engineering to EG 120 alumni than to those who never took the course. 
In fact, some of the best engineering students still consider EG 120 a waste oftime. 
The point is well taken, but misguided. To be sure, EG 120 -the old way -did seem a little disorganized. What did FORTRAN programming, for example, have to do with least squares methods? Mastering the individual skills seemed like an end in itself. 
But perhaps the dissatisfaction with the course stemmed not from the content of the course, but from students' misconception of what engineering is all 
about. 

as a power plant), they will see the very real need for knowing how to use a com­puter, of knowing how to model data, of knowing how to do material balances. 
In other words, the skills taught by Gadja and Biles are hard to appreciate unless integrated in one typical engineering situation. "We cannot be tied to a black­board or an overhead," Miller says. "You have to remember that what we're doing has never been done before. l think it's exciting." 
And if Notre Dame engineering students never ap­preciate what EG 120 did, then maybe they are too con­cerned with the "specialized" to appreciate the "general" that is at once the art ofengineering.

National Peace Academy 

Peace campaigners to speak 
BY CINDY COLDIRON 
SeniorStaffReporter 
The founders ofthe movement for a National Academy of Peace are being sponsored by CILA and the Notre Dame Coalition for Peace to speak on their campaign for a nation­al peace academy. Rose and Dan Lucey of Washington D.C. will talk on Mon. Oct. 11 at 7:30 p.m. in Hayes-Healy Auditorium. 
The National Peace Academy Campaign (N-Pac), a member­supported organization, has a single goal -the establishment of the United States Academy of Peace. Believing that it is crucial that the "U S in the last two decades of this ce~~~ry. devote at least as much at­
tention to strengthening its peacemaking ability as it does to maintaining its military power," the organization seeks to improve society's ability to handle "conflict 
without violence." 
The three objectives of the Academy include periorming and assisting research about internation­al peace and peacemaking; educat­ing and training persons from government, private enterprise and voluntary associations about inter­national peace and peacemaking skills; and establishing an informa­tion service in the field of learning about peace. 
Havingwatched their dreams for a 
National Peace Academy grow in the 
1960's and die away by the early 
1970's, the luceys' organization is 
currently experiencing a great 
resurgence in membership 
The original idea for " National 
Peace Academy occurred to the 
Luceys' in the early 1960's while they and their eight children were visiting Washington D.C. Realizing that so many of the nation's monu­ments commemorated war and fighting, they resolved to do some· thing about it. The Luceys' decided that the establishment of a Peace Academy was essential. 
Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, who is on the advisory board for the campaign, published a letter in early 1982 supporting the Academy. Stating that "as a priest and an educator, I am one who is convinced that we can and must find non-violent means ofresolving our disputes," Hesb .rgh supported the proposal in Congress that would have created a U.S. Academy of Peace. 
Emphasizing ·the need for an 
Academy of Peace,"not to do away 
with conflict, but to learn and teach 
how to creatively 'manage' conflict," 
Hesburgh felt that the Peace 
Academy proposal was, in many 
ways, "much more dramatic a 
development than the freeze." 

The reason for this, Hesburgh stated, was that it would "concentrate all ofour resources for peace and would address the greatest power on earth to the more fundamentally long-term challenge of finding constructive and non­violent ways of resolving all kinds of disputes." The student contact for the Luce ys', Angelo Cappozzi, referred to the fact that the Luceys' spoke at Notre Dame 16 years ago about this same proposal. 
Congress appeared to be on the 
verge of recognizing the need for a 
Peace Academy · last November 
when legislation was introduced in­
to the Senate. Fifty-three senators 
from both parties and more than a hundred members from the House co-sponsored Senate Bill 1889. 
Currently, there is only a bare pos­sibility of the bill being passed in the Senate. Even if it does manage to pass in the Senate. it means starting over again in 1983. Senate majority leader Howard Baker is the key per­son in the Senate yet to be con­vinced of the need for a National 
Peace Academy. 
... Hesburgh 
continuedfrom page 1 
players putting his name on a list of potential mediators, Hesburgh said he was too busy to get involved in something that might take four or five weeks, "although if there's something I could solve in a couple of hours, I think it would be in the public interest to do it."

Solidarity calls for strike 
WARSAW, Poland (AP) 
Responding swiftly to the outlawing 
of their independent union, 
Solidarity's fugitive leaders yester­
day called for a four hour, 
nationwide strike on Nov. 10. 

"At every enterprise, and at every department, a clandestine commit· tee preparing the protest of Nov. I0 should be organized," said the state­ment dated Oct. 9 and signed by four ofthe underground union's leaders. 
"The course of the protest will decide the further strategy of the unions." 
The statement called for the strike on the second anniversary of Solidarity's registration by a Warsaw court. 
Noting that Poland's parliament, the Sejm, Friday banned Polish uni­ons and imposed severe limits on any new unions, it said: "solidarity exists and will exist, no matter if someone likes it or not." 
That phrase was taken from a speech by Solidarity's founder­leader Lech Walesa, who along with more than 600 other union leaders has been interned since martial law was imposed Dec.l3 and suspended 
the independent union. 
The statement was signed by the three Solidarity leaders still at large: Gdansk, Zbigniew Bujak of Warsaw and Wladyslaw Hardek of Krakow. signed in place of Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, who was captured last Tuesday. 
The four head the underground National Coordination Commission that has run the union since April in place ofother union leaders who are interned. 
"The commission appeals to working people, to all trade unions for a common boycott of new trade unions," the Solidarity statement said. "We appeal to all working people, no matter to which unions they belong for a massive nationwide protest against lawless­ness and poverty." 
Earlier yesterday, Roman Catholic Primate Jozef Glemp accused mar· tial law authorities of "embittering the nation" and several Warsaw priests urged calm as other signs of protest emerged against the outlaw­ing ofSolidarity.

sent a letter condemning the ban and urging workers to boycott new unions. There were unconfirmed reports that Solidarity's under­ground leadership may consider calling a strike next month. 
In a sermon viewed here as moderate, although sharper than earlier public statements, Glemp said: "there are so many examples of the trampling of man, of disrespect for man's dignity. We wish we could free our country from such evil. 
"We learned about the delegaliza· tion of Solidarity as a trade union with real pain," he said, citing the "bitterness of recent days. But we know that what is just, what is ideal and what is good cannot perish." 
The Sejm, or Parliament, Friday banned Polish unions and imposed severe limits on any new unions. 
Glemp addressed more than 10,000 people who converged at the Niepokalanow monastery to honor the Rev. Maximilian Kolbe, a Franciscan friar who was canonized by Pope John Paul II at the Vatican yesterday as the 17th Polish saint in history. 
Kolbe died on Aug. 14, 1941 in the Auschwitz death camp from an injection ofcarbolic acid two weeks after he volunteered to take the place ofa Polish sergeant in a starva­tion bunker.

Respite at a crossroads 
My father retired last Friday. After 27 years with a steamship company, he left two days before his 62nd birthday because he could stomach his job no longer. There was no 
Paul McGinn 
Roper Review 
hoopla, no great party, no splendid hand­shakes with executives, only a sigh of relief. He was tired of the psychological game­playing and one-upmanship characteristic of so many large companies. 
Now he stands at a crossroads. He is unable to set out on a quest for fame and fortune, yet he is not content to sit back and collect retire­ment or social security. He is, in a sense, choosing a new career, an avenue by which to finally do what he wants. And he is optimistic. 
Because ofthis tum ofevents, my father and I now share more than ever. We see each other as participants in the same process: we know that the near future brings with it the 
challenges and headaches inherent in any 
vocation. And with this new outlook comes 
the all-too-familiar realization that as I have 
become older, my father has become smarter. 
And I too, am at that fork, deciding what I 
want to do when I pass from this womb ofcol­
lege. This respite has given me oppurtunities 
that my father never experienced. My 
presence here commits me to cramming the 
meaning of humanity into four years, a 
meaning which he already knows so much 
more fully than l could ever hope. 
I constantly complain about the endless routine of classes and insurmountable workload and rarely think of how fortunate I am to be here and about how much my father sacrificed to send me here. And as he begins his long-awaited respite, I become acutely aware ofthe load I must soon carry. 
But while I follow the physical motions of 
academics and extracurriculars, we share in 
Notre Dame. And although forty years and 
1,000 miles separate us, we entrust our hopes 
and fears to one another; we intimate those 
meanings which only father and son can per­ceive. 
Psychologists spew endless criticism of a parent who lives out his dreams through his children, yet I know there is much more be­tween my father and me than simple vicarious 
experience. 

We are committed to the same ideals. We believe in voicing our beliefs and in remaining dedicated to those beliefs: we detest the un­committed Independent who shirks group responsibility; we applaud the staunch Democrat or Republican; we regard the Islas Malvinas and Palestinian crises as prime ex­amples of how stupidly men can act; we criticize the Church's inconsistencies, yet remain ready to support it. 
We no longer speak to one another; we speak with one another. But it has never been easy, nor will it ever be any less ofa struggle. We still scream, curse, and glare at one anoth­er every time we think the other is getting the upper hand. Yet we only use our tempers to vent our frustrat~on. Our targets are necessari­ly those whom we love. 
And as the pressures of work are now lifted from my father, I sense the stress which lies less than two years away. My only hope is that I may cope with that frustration as well as he. 
We have become closer now that I see him so infrequently. We realize how much it means to assert independence and how easy it is for one to encroach upon the other. 
In a sense, we have become of one mind. We have grown from completely separate in­dividuals to become philosophic allies, and yet we have never surrendered our freedom or personal culpability. 
We never solved any great riddle of human relationships. We never experienced a mind­boggling catharsis. We only slowly learned to show each other respect as equals. And I for my part, learned more about dignity from him than I could ever hope to bestow upon anoth­er. Yet because of his retirement, I acknowl­edge that I must pass that same spirit ofhuman worth which he upholds. My only hope is that that dignity I pass on may be as pure as it was when he gave it to me. 
Opening of adoption records: needless pain 
Among the many "social rights" issues being debated in and our of the courts is the opening of adoption records to adoptees. If the courts decide in favor of the adoptees,

they would be able to find out who their natural parents are; the parents would no lon­ger have the'protection ofanonymity. 
The most persuasive argument ofthe aaop­tees' is that they have the "right" to know who their natural parents are. That's very fine, but this supposed right does not hold up very well under questioning. For example, why should they know? Their natural parents do not have 
any rights or responsibilities to the child they gave up. So their parents don't "owe" them anything -certainly not an "explanation" of why they didn't keep their child. Neither does the adoptee owe anything to his/her parents. One can rationalize that the adoptee is in­debted to his/her parents for "the gift oflife." But that is not really true. As a "gift," it does not need to be repaid, and how would you go about repaying it anyway? The best analogy is an anonymous gift, which you accept even though you do not know the donor. 
And what good will the information be to 
the individual? It is not too likely that the 
parents will be thrilled to see their child after 
all these years. 
It should be clear that the adoptee should not impose himself on or expect anything from his natural family, which is not to say that he would not at least be tempted to try to get it if he knew who they were. Ifthe only motive behind wanting to know the identity of one's 
natural parents is curiosity, which is perhaps the only ethical motive, then the argument is reduced to nothing. Even if you do not con­
sider the rights of the parents, it is hard to see what value the knowledge would have. The odds are very low that the natural parents would have been better than the foster parents; very few parents who are able and willing to raise a child would give it up, and very few parents who are unable or unwilling to raise a child would adopt one. 
Since it is possible that I have not convinced you, here is the other side of the dispute: the natural parents gave up their child, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, knowing that they would be protected from future meeting by law. To change that now would violate their trust. It is quite likely that some of the parents would have had an abortion rather than give the child up for adoption without that guarantee. Ofcourse, it seems to me that many of the people who are in favor of opening adoption records are also pro-
abortion, but that is a generalization I probab­
ly should not make. In any case, it would be 
more than a little unjust to change the law the 
parents agreed to. 
The terms of the adoption contract and the natural parents' right to privacy override1> what amounts to, at best, curiosity. Ofcourse, in some medical cases it would be neccessary to open the records, but only to the doctor. Many people simply want to keep their past behind them and do not want a knock on their door from someone expecting handouts. 
As I am not adopted myself, I cannot claim to completely understand the desire to know that some adoptees have. And I must add that not all adoptees possess this desire to the de­gree that others do; they are satisfied with not knowing for sure. Foster parents sacrifice as much as natural parents for their children; it seems ungrateful to insist on knowing your "real" parents. 
P.O. Box Q  
Riuer City packages are ajoke Dear Editor: In light of the recent cancellation of the Who concert bus trip, I regret that I did not write this letter a month ago. You see, I too, was a victim of River City Records. In early September, River City advertised in this newspaper a charter bus trip to the Chicago Bears -Detroit Lions football game at the Pontiac Silverdome. Sandwiches, beer and a 35-yard-line seat were included in the S49 package price. I had several friends and family members that would be attending the game, so it sounded like a good deal. Little did I know what I was in for. On the Friday preceding the September 12th concert, I telephoned River City Records and spoke with Mr. Peter Kernan, the owner, to verity the Sunday morning departure. Mr. Kernan told me that the bus would depart from the store parking lot at 7:00a.m. He also confirmed the seat location and that refreshments would be served. Everything sounds super, right? Wrong. Upon my arrival at River City, a fellow pas­ senger informed me, to my total disbelief, the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students recognize there are homosexuals in the that the charter bus was actually a van and who planned on attending the concert.

the third inning to bring the Brewers within one run, at 3·2. Oglivie had missed a game with bruised ribs and had committed two errors before his homer. 
Cards 6, Braves 2 
ATLANTA (AP) -Rookie Willie 
McGee drilled a two-run triple and a 
home run as St. Louis charged into 
the 1982 World Series, clinching the 
National League pennant with a 6-2 
victory over the Atlanta Braves last 
night. 
The triumph, with the help of an­
other door-shutting relief job by 
Bruce Sutter, completed a three­
game sweep of the National League 
Championship Series for the Car­
dinals and put them in the World 
Series for the first time since I968. h 
is the 13th NL pennant for St. Louis, 
which hosts the first two games of 
the World Series against the 
American League Champion Mil­
waukee Brewers beginning tomor­
row night. 
Joaquin Andujar, the National League's pitcher of the month in September when he won five games and had a 0.80 earned run average, throttled the Braves on just two hits over the first six innings. But he tired in the seventh, surrendering both Braves runs on four hits before Sut­ter, who led the league with 36 saves, came on to nail down the vic­tory and the pennant for the Car­dinals. 
The Cardinals gave Andujar a comfortable early cushion, knock­ing out Atlanta starter Rick Camp in the second inning with four quick runs in a rally started by Keith Her· nandez, who opened the inning with a single to left field. 
Camp got two strikes on the next batter, Darrell Porter, but lost him, issuinJt a base on balls. 
When George Hendrick followed 
with a single to right, Hernandez 
dashed home with the game's first 
run. That brought pitching coach 
Bob Gibson to the mound for a word 
with Camp. Th advice didn't do 
much good because McGee drilled 
the next pitch up the alley in right­
center field, scoring Porter and 
Hendrick. The ball got to the wall on 
two bounces and McGee zipped into 
third with his second triple of the 
series. 
On the next pitch, Ozzie Smith, 
who had three hits, singled to cen­
ter, scoring McGee and giving the 
Cardinals a 4-0 lead. 
That finished Camp and the Braves were faced with playing catch-up. But Andujar wouldn't let them come close. 
Then Claudell Washington and Bob Horner opened the seventh with consecutive singles. But An­dujar got Chris Chambliss to rap into a double play. One run scored on the play, and when the Braves added an­other on hits by Dale Murphv and 
Glenn Hubbard sandwiched around a wild pitch -Sutter came out of the bullpen to retire Bruce Benedict on a fly ball. He finished up, mowing the Braves down in the final 
two innings. 
The Cards had turned over two other double plays earlier, both against Jerry Royster after leadoff man Rafael Ramirez had reached base in the first and fourth innings. A diving catch by Hendrick in right field saved him more trouble in the fourth. 


St. Mary's volleyball rolls over Tri-State U. 
ByJUDY McNAMARA 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's Volleyball team 
bettered their record Friday night to 
6-3-1 with a victory over Tri-State 
University. The Belles downed the 
Trojans in three easy games to take 
the match. 
Rita Schubert, Saint Mary's "serving specialist" provided eight points in the Belles first game rout of the Trojans by a score of 15-2. The second game was taken in similar fashion, with Mary Garvey and senior captain Peg ·Pieschel each serving four points to win the game 15-7. The final game, however, was truly a team effort with all players contributing in the I 5-12 third game win. 
"Despite the weak competition, we remained sharp all evening and played well as a team," commented Assistant Coach John Klebba. "Mary Ann Viola played exceptionaly well as our middle setter and spiker, as did all the girls who were played during the victory," Klebba added. 
Sophomore Ann Boutton was an­other stand-out during the match, as she exploded for nine completed spikes (kills) and five points in the final game. 
Pieschel is the emotional leader of this squad, made up largely of fresh­man and sophomores who show much potential for the successful completion of their schedule this season, and in seasons to come. 
Saint Mary's next home match is against Goshen College and Saint Francis College tommorow night at 
6:00 p.m. in the Angela Athletic Facility.

Memoto Miami 
Neverunderestimate tradition 
Going into Saturday's ND-Miami game, I was unsure 
just how the whole thing was going to turn out -that 
is, until I got hold of a copy of Friday's Miami Hur­
ricane, the Miami student newspaper. 
I knew that Miami had a tough defense, a coach with 
pro experience and a substitute quarterback who, al­
though not quite as good as his predecessor, had a lot of 
talent in his own right. 
What I didn't know was that Miami, its coaches, its 
players and its students had an irreverently cocky at­
titude. 
But as I read through Friday'sHurricane, I knew that 
Notre Dame was going to win. 
Here are some excerpts from that edition: 
"There is a lurking suspicion thatyou have notreal­ly arrived untilyou can invade South Bend and beat 'the damned Gipper.' Miami has never done that. Tomorrow they willget the chance to dojustthat. They will." -jean Claude de Ia France, Sports Editor. 
"We are not worried about their stadium, their traditions, the damned Gipper or anything like that." 
-Kim Helton, Miami assistant coach. 
"There is a degree ofconfidence on this Hurricane team that will make them come out and chase the ghosts ..."-Our buddy jean Claude, again. 
That was Miami's attitude entering Saturday's game -forget the tradition and the "damned Gipper," we're going to win. 
Instead, the Irish won the game, 16-14, on a last­minute field goal by Mike Johnston, and thereby penned still another chapter in their never-ending book ofgreat comebacks and miracle finishes. 
What made it miraculous was not so muchJohnston's 
kick -the guy hasn't even come close to missing this 
year -but that the Notre Dame offense was able to 
move the ball with authority, almost at will, at crucial 
points in the fourth quarter. 
It was almost as ifthere were a 12th man on the field 
for the Irish. 
The ghost of George Gipp, perhaps? Nah, you say, it 
couldn't be. 
Well, then, who mysteriously opened up those 
gaping holes for Phil Carter on the final drive, when 
none were to be found earlier? And who helped Miami 
call that ill-advised quarterback sneak on third-and-two 
when the Hurricanes desperately needed a first down 
with two minutes left? And who huffed and puffed to 
make suce Johnston's field goal slipped inside the 
upright? 
George Gipp and all other Notre Dame football legends have been questioned and attacked over the years by scores of jealous rivals. 

Last week, the mystique came urrder heavy attack by some overconfident Miami folks, some of whose com­ments you read above. It is that general feeling, instilled by Coach Howard Schnellenberger, that sent Miami to its sixth straight loss at Notre Dame Stadium. 
Schnellenberger is the most envious of all. He's en­vious of schools that get more national publicity, have more financial support and have a more storied past than his. For this reason, he hates the big-time, big­money schools. 
But, hopefully, Schnellenberger learned his lesson Saturday -that those who fail to respect history and tradition end up becoming part ofit. 
Ofcourse, the Irish players and coaches were respon­sible for Saturday's victory, not some past "tradition." 
But, as everyone knows, tradition is an important part of every Notre Dame football team, and opponents must prepare for that aspect as much as they must get ready to stop Phil Carter, Larry Moriarty, Blair Kiel, et al. 
And when I discovered that Miami was taking this "tradition" business very lightly, I knew the Irish would win. 
After the game, Irish center Tom Thayer had an 
interesting story that pointed out the Hurricanes' com­
placency. 
Following Miami's crucial interception of a Kiel pass in the end zone with 2:58 to go, Thayer ran into Hur­ricane middle guard Tony Fitzpatrick as the teams left the field. 
"Fitzpatrick came up to me and said, 'It's over,"' 
recalled Thayer. "And 1said to him, 'This is Notre Dame 
-it's never over."' 
The Notre Dame football tradition can be magical, mystical, almost eerie at times. But it is real, not a myth; opponents should accept it as part ofthe game plan and attack it accordingly. 
But it should never be laughed at, sneered at, cursed or just plain overlooked. And that was Miami's fatal mistake Saturday.

continuedfrom page 12 
of Richt in the second quarter led to a fumble that was recovered by Mike Gann. Three plays later Kiel broke the scoreless tie with a six-yard TD run. 
There was the familiar sight of Gerry Faust raging with a vengeance on the sidelines over what he felt were unjust calls made against his club. 
There was the familiar sight ofthe conservative, but effective, passing attack implemented by Assistant Coach Ron Hudson this year as Kiel completed 21-of-33 passes for 167 
yards. 

Finally, there was a familiar dis­
gruntlement by the fans for the 
second week in a row that perhaps 
the offense was too conservative. 
After Richt's 79-yard rocket ro Rocky Belk with 13:03 left in the game, however, there was the un­, familiar sight this year of the Irish 
having fallen behind. 

The wills and desires of the Notre 
Dame players, questioned through­
out the 1981 campaign, was now put 
to the test against the powerful Hur­
ricanes, who clung to a 14-10 lead. 
What ensued was a battle that had everything but the main theme of Chariots ofFire blaring through the stadium. 
"You push harder, you bear down more, you run faster, and you hold onto your blocks longer when it counts," said Thayer. "It takes a lot of pride. We proved a lot." 
In those final 13 minutes, Notre Dame had the ball for three posse­sions that produced 1 5 1 yards and two Mike Johnston field goals. In its nine previous possesions the offense managed only 210 total yards. 
"Gradually as the game went on we got better," said Kiel. "That's one ofour goals:" 
Carter, who had gained only 33 yards on his first 13 carries, picked up 59 in 11 carries on Notre Dame's final three drives. Kiel, meanwhile, completed five-of-six passes on the final drive for 39 ofNotre Dame's 55 yards gained in that drive. . 
The defense also came through when it counted the most. After its touchdown, Miami gained 12 yards on six plays on its last two full posse­sions. ln its last full possesion Miami needed only two yards in two plays to pick up the clinching first down. But sophomore Mrke Golic, in for the injured Griffith, stopped Speedy Neal for no gain: A questionable quarterback sneak by Richt on third down gained only one yard as middle lineoocker Mark Zavagnin stopped him cold. 
"We knew we had to stop-them as quickly as we could and get the of­fense the ball," said Zavagnin. "I was a little surprised by their third down play -but that's something they have to live with, not us." 
All of which set the mob scene at the end as Johnston booted his 32­yard field goal with just 11 seconds showing on the clock. 
"When we were marching down· the field, l tried not to think about 

·what was going on out there," said Johnston. "l just kept kicking the ball in the net on the sidelines and tried to stay loose. 
"Sure I was nervous (when he 
went in), but when you get into a 
situation like that you just have to let 
your mind go blank and concentrate 
on kicking the ball. I knew it was 
good when I kicked it -then I went 
crazy." 
Johnston, and his teammates, had 
good reason. 
"The Notre Dame football team 
showed a lot of heart and a lot of 
character," praised the jubilant 
Faust. "They came away from a lot of 
adversity and played a heckuva foot­
ball game." 
As Parseghian would tell anyone, 
adversity does that for you.

Irish 'come of age,' beat Miatni on late FG 
By LOUIE SOMOGYI 
Sports Writer 
"Adversity elicits talent which under prosperous conditions would have remained dormant." 
-Ara Parseghian 

There was perhaps one significant question that still needed answering before the Miami game about the 1982 Notre Dame football team. 
How would it respond in adverse situations in game conditions? 
Quarterback Blair Kiel along with many of his teammates perhaps found the answer in last years 37-1 5 season-ending debacle at Miami. 
"We learned that you win and lose on the football field and that the Notre Dame tradition can't win it for you," he said sadly after the loss. 

The lessons learned from last year's disappointments came to full fledge in the fourth quarter ofSatur­day's stirring 16-14 Irish victory, when Notre Dame fell behind for the first time this year. It was not a time for disappointment and fear. but one of revival and hope. A time not for wallowing in self-pity, but for reach­ing back for the most of what inner resources were left in their already exhausted bodies. 
"Last year we would fall behind and we would start to hang our heads," admitted newly converted center Tom Thayer after the game. "I think we really came of age today." 
Falling behind on the scoreboard wasn't halfofthe hardship, though. 

"We had some really bad calls against us out there" said fullback Larry Moriarty of the I05 penalty yards assessed against the Irish. "We had too much pride though to lose to Miami again." 
"You can't depend on the referees to be always right," echoed defensive tackle Mike Gann. "We kept our composure when we had to." 
Football Special 
--page 10 

The composure was most evident after Blair Kiel threw an intercep­tion in the Miami end zone with only 2:58left in the contest. 
"It's over," Miami middle guard Tony Fitzpatrick told Thayer after the interception. "It's over." 
"They were somewhat mouthy out there," said Irish tri-captain Phil Carter. "But I knew the defense could do the job and hold them. I believed all along that we would have one more try." 
For the first 47 minutes, it seemed like the question of how Notre Dame could handle adversity would remain moot, as the game was following the same script as pre­vious Irish games this year. 
There was the familiar sight of the 
Notre Dame "Gold Rush," led by 
mainstay Kevin Griffith, wreaking

Hunter gets 1 OOth win 
Irish defeat Louisville, tie WMU 
By AL GNOZA 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame soccer team headed into this weekend's action hoping to hand Head Coach Rich Hunter his 1 OOth win. However, a 1­1 tie with Western Michigan on Friday night held Hunter's ledger at 99. 
After a sluggish start yesterday, the turn of events worked to Notre Dame's advantage as the University of Louisville was whistled for a push in front of its goal and Irish forward Kenny Harkenrider scored on the subsequent penalty kick to put the hosts up 1-0. The Cardinals then folded as the Irish rolled to a 4-0 win, giving Hunter his 1OOth career vic­tory. 
Harkenrider's blast into the top 

right corner ofthe net at 24:20 ofthe first half proved to be the game-winner. He would later add another tally. Rich Hertegen also scored twice. 
"Their goalie just pushed one of our guys from behind," said Harken­rider. "I couldn't understand their complaining, it looked pretty flagrant to me." 
Less than ten minutes later Her­
tegen took advantage of some loose 
play in front the Louisville goal and 
belted one home to give Notre 
Dame a 2-0 halftime lead. 
"Overall, I could tell that we were 
a better balanced team," remarked 
Hunter. "They had one or two 
chances to score early but then we 
pretty much turned it around." 
"Friday night's game was a tough
