THE OBS£RIJER. Monday, 1971
February 8, 


WITH MAX SHULMAN 
(By the author of Rally Round the Flag. Boys . .. Dobie Gillis . .. elc.) 

Everything you always wanted to know about college ... but were too classy to ask 
The other night when the little woman and I got home from our 
encounter group, I said to her, "Isn't it odd, my dear, that colleges 
still haven't tried non-verbal communication?" 

(Incidentally, the little woman I refer to is not, as you might 
think, my wife. My wife is far from a little woman. She is, in fact, 
nearly seven feet high and mantled with rippling muscle. She is a full­
blooded Chiricahua Apache and holds the world's shotput record­
908 feet. The little woman I refer to is someone we found crouching 
under the sofa when we rented our flat back in 1924. She has been with 
us ever since, although to be perfectly honest, she's really not much 
fun to have around. She never speaks except to make a sort of moist, 
gagging sound when she's hungry, and she'll often sneak up and tusk 
you while you're busy watching television. Still and all, with my wife 
away putting the shot most of the time, at least it gives me somebody 
to hack around with.) 

But I digress. "Isn't it odd, my dear," I said the other night to: 
the little woman, "that colleges still haven't tried non-verbal commu­
nication?" And it is odd. Why do teachers keep talking to students'! 
:;urely they've learned by now that talkJ:ng is no way to communicate. 
t's been proved over and over in encounter groups, T-groups, sensi­
.ivity groups and grope groups that people don't really, truly reach 
other people with language. How can they? Words, by their very na­
ture, are ambiguous and artificial and conceal more than they reveal. 
There is only one way to really, truly communicate with another hu­
:nan being, and that is to touch him and feel him. This is honest and 
natural and basic and beautiful and legal in some states. 

And yet teachers go right on talking. No wonder they get no feed­
back. Let us say, for example, that a teacher is trying to get a student ,to learn Boyle's law. Talk won't do it, not even if the teacher talks the whole semester long. But if one day he will simply and silently reach out and just hold the student for a minute or two, maybe even dance with him a little bit, he will find that the student has learned not only 
Boyle's law but probably the fox trot too. 

And what is more, the teacher will discover he has a new friend. 
No longer will student and teacher snarl and make cparse gestures 
when they see each other on campus. Instead they will run together, 
clasp and nuzzle, trade hats, and finally, without a word-for what do 
friends need with words?-repair to a nearby tavern for that friend­
liest of all ceremonies: the sharing of Miller High Life Beer. 

No beer binds a friendship the way Miller High Life does. I could tell you why if I wanted to. In fact, I could go on for hours about the glories of !-'1iller High Life. But I won't, for we all know, don't we, that language Is not the way to communicate? So here is all I will say: 
Get yourself a can or bottle of Miller (a keg if you are a very large person). Pour a glass for your friend, a glass for yourself. Link arms. Tie your neckties together. Drink. 
Can words describe the ,resultant euphoria, the enveloping one­ness, the ripening occlusion? No; words are useless. Just Miller and a friend; that's all you need to know. And if, by chance, you don't have a friend, get two Millers. You'll never walk alone. 
But I digress. Talking, as we have seen, is obsolete. And of course, writing is on its last legs too; in fact, I give the literature game another six months at the outside. Naturally, being a sort of writer, I'm a little sorry to see this happen, but on the other hand, I'm not really worried. The shotput game, thank Heaven, is better than ever, and I feel confi­dent my wife will always earn enough for me and the little woman. 
* * * 

The brewing game also looks healthy from where we sit, which is in Milwaukee, from whose storied environs we have been bringing you Miller High Life, the Champagne ofBeers, for more than 115 flavorful years. Try some; you'll see why.

Reorganization marks Alumni Board meeting 
. 
A partial reorganization and a change in election procedures were among the achievements of the Alumni Board at its winter meeting which concluded Satur­day. The Board also considered other issues involving the alum­ni, the administration, and the student body. 
The theme of the meeting, according to James Cooney, Ex­ecutive Secretary of the Alumni Association, was "introspection" of the alumni, a "look at who we are, what our role is, where we are going, and what we should do in I 0 years that we aren't doing now." This was in keeping with the suggestion made by Rev. Theodore M. Hes-burgh, University President, at the beginning of the first semes­ter that this be a year of "con­solidation." 
One of the most vital accom­plishments of the meeting, ac­cording to Cooney, was a re­vision of Board election pro­cedures. The Boar<!__s:aw a need to gain some younger members, since, at present, there is no representative from a class that has graduated since 1957, Cooney said. At the next elec­tion a representativ'e of a class that has graduated within the 

Apollo alters path 
SPACE CENTER' Houston (UPI) -Apollo 14's astronauts, their spaceship crammed with rocks that could be part of the moon's primitive cnJst, trimmed their course yesterday to line themselves up for a Pacific O­cean splashdown near the Inter­national Dateline. 
Depending upon which side of the Dateline they land, the end of their $400 million mission techni-cally could come either tomorrow or Wednesday. But whichever side it is, it will be midmorning in the South Pacific and about 4:05p.m.. EST tomor­row. 
The men who will fish the astronauts from tht: warm, four mile deep waters of the Pacific, near Pago Pago made their final practice recovery Y'~sterday and all was reported in readiness.

last 5 years will be chosen along with the 5 regional representa­tives. This at-large member will hopefully bring a fresh dimen­sion to the Board which has lacked youth. This scarcity re­suited because younger memhers were "not visible in normal channels" and thus were not nominated, Cooney said. 
A progress report on the alumni's role in recruitment was presented. 
The state of the SUMMA fund raising program, which is one year from completion, was studied at the meeting. This 5 year capital campaigning fund has been run in conjunction with the annual alumni fund, which was formerly the single most important channel and will re­turn to its number one position as "SUMMA's sun sets," ac­cording to Cooney. 
A progress report on the alunmi recruitment role was pre­sented. Intra-alumni affairs, such as class vs. hall identity and future alumni seminars in the vein of continuing education, were also of concern. 
Thereportonannexationwas in keeping with the informa­tiona! aspect of the Board meet­ing. The alumni were reminded ot 
Generally clear skies and gentle sea swells of three to six feet are expected at the time of touch­down. 
Mission commander Alan B. Shepard and his two copilots, Edga r D. Mitchell and Stuart A. Roosa, enjoyed a hard earned restful day in space yesterday. They ran some oxygen supply tests related to future space­walks in lunar oribt and arranged to hold a news conference bile hurling horne at 4000 MPH this evening. 
Ground controllers said the three space fliers would spend 30 minutes before their televi­siQn camera today answering re­porters' questions relayed to them by ground controllers. 
News of the day was read to the astronauts yesterday, and one item contained quote from the commissions working on the feasibility and "dollars and cents" of co-education. The 47,000 alumni nationwide will be polled for their reactions to the Park-Mayhew Report, with the results to be presented at the Board of Trustees meeting in early March, added Cooney. 
One of the final activities of the Board was to visit with rnem hers of the Athletic Depart­ment, which provides the best contact between university .and alumni, Cooney said. "The guy in Seattle," suggested Cooney, "hears more about his university when Notre Dame beats UCLA," than in its academic or social accomplishments. 

Shepard's golf pro to the effect 
that Shepard has a good swing, 
and could be a good golfer if he 
worked at it. The observation 
was prompted by the now fa­
mous golf shot Shepard made 
before leaving the moon. 
"The only way AI can keep 
his arm straight though is to 
wear the space suit and that gets 
cumbersome on the golf 
course," Mitchelljoked. 
The Apollo astronauts have 
I09 pounds of moon rocks load­
ed aboard their spaceship, and 
scientists are hopeful some of 
them may be fossil chunks of 
the primitive lunar crust. 

If so, the rocks would be a · billion years older than those returned by other Apollo crews. This would help fill in a miss­ing chapter in the geological 
history of the universe. 
The astronauts had difficulty 
finding room for all their lunar 
treasure and long after ground 
controllers thought they had 
bedded down Saturday night, 
they were still busy stowing the 
rocks away. 
"We'd thought you'd all gone 
to sleep up there," astronaut 
chief Deke Slayton said. 
"Yeah, we're working on 
that," Roosa said, "but we did­
n't have any place to sleep. 
We're inundated So, we've been 
trying to get things IIi some sort 
of order." 
The astronauts were awakened 
at I 0:45a.m. EST yesterday and 
reported they were "feeling 
great" despite a restive night's 
sleep in the cramped quarters. 
In addition to the moon 
rocks, the astronauts also had to 
find room for an 80 pound 
docking mechanism that once 
proved troublesome. 
Normally, the probe is jetti­
soned, but experts want to in­
spect it and correct any flaws so 
future flights will not be similar­
ly trpubled.

Co-Ed Cominission form committees 
(Continued from Page 1) 
Having analyzed the various categories, including some not found in the catalogues, the com!Tiittee has begun to '·'outline the policy of the two schools." 
The Merged Departments Committee has been sharing goals similar to those of the Academic Committee. Currently they are concentrating on the departments that could eventual­ly merge when the colleges be­come coed. 
Candon said his committee is 
"studying the feasibilitY of merging where there are comple­mentary departments on both sides of the road." He also point­ed out that in some areas Notre Dame and Saint Mary's "stress different types of education." 
Referring to the Park-Mayhew 
Report, Candon felt that there may have been a "misunderatinding" in the pur­pose of the report on campus. He said it was supposed to "give direction" and that "it wasn't 
designed to give details." 
"I thought it would be more specific" Candon said, He evalu­ated it as "mediocre at best." 
After all of the committees have organized the report it will be presented at a student assem­
bly  later  this  month,  and  will  
also  be  taken  to  the  Trustees  
meeting in Florida.  

Candon feels that "the stu­dent assembly will be of para· mount importance" and that the coed supplementary report"must have student sup­port to bring to the Trustees."

backing."  
According  to  Carol  Hennin­ 

ger, there are about 80 people now working on it, with the aid of about 20 administrators and faculty members. Both Andrus and Cahdon stressed the need for full student participation in this effort, and added that it is not just a student government project. 
The two students involved in proposals handling co-ed housing, James Thunder and Michael George, are confident that co-education living conditions will become a reality by the fall of '71. 
Jim Thunder, co-author of the Thunder-C'onway report, sees his proposal as both feasible and practical. The displaced students from Stanford, said Thunder, can be absorbed into Keenan, and with solely women in Stanford, a separate living situation will definitely exist. Both these aspect<; should carry weight with Board of Trustees consideration of the plan at their March meeting in Florida. 
Thunder sees as a major question the SMC reaction to the exchange, To realize a more

The final form of the Flan:ner Academic Commission report of co-ed housing will be ready by this Friday, according to George. 
George's main objective is to "get to the people that make the decisions" with the Flanner proposal. 
He feels that an exchange with Flanner will prove "very beneficial" for SMC. St. Mary~s the Flanner Commission reveal than an exchange with Regina Hall can be realized. 

"The University has already admitted that the question of co-education now is how far and how soon," said George. "Co-exchange was a logical step -this is the next logical step." 
George would like to either send representatives to the March meeting, or make information available for queries received from the trustees. 
The Flanner report will also

Redu.ction 
What the Notre Dame College of Arts and Letters needs, apparently, is a good five 
cent Professor. Failing that, they will need to somehow streamline their operation. 
The Arts and Letters budget is being cut,.and there is a good possibility it will be cut 
again next year. 
The most immediate consequence will be a cutback in the faculty, further 
impairing the all-important student-teacher ratio. This consequence, of course, 
appeals neither to the student, who would be part of that new student-teacher 
ratio, nor to the teacher, who might not be part of that new ratio. A good student ­
teacher ratio often motivates serious and intelligent high school seniors to choose a 
college; add a grosser ratio to the present depraved coinstitutional system and the 
calibre of student applicants would in all probability decrease notably. Obviously, 
then, Notre Dame's best choice is to make this move a temporary one. 
The realm of permanent moves, otherwise, known as solutions, is, however, 
unfortunately limited. One solution which appeals to a lot of people -· particularly 
Arts and Letters Majors -involves taking money away from the Engineering and 
Science departments (where the amount of money spent per student is 
disproportionately high) and pouring it into Arts and Letters. Unfortunately, any 
sustained cutback in the Science programs will cripple those programs far worse than 
the proposed Arts and Letters programs, for the need for Professors in the Sciences 
is as great as it is in Arts and letters, and there is additional demand for Laboratory 
and Research facilities in Science. So, despite the Elysiac promise of budget 
relocations, the program would be quite impracticable. 
Nonetheless, the problem remains: how to reverse the ominous trend in the College of Arts and Letters towards unpleasantly high student-teacher ratio? The answer, painful always, is staring us all in the face. It is to reduce the number of students in the College of Arts and Letters until the student-faculty ratio is once again both financially supportable and scholastically respectable. 
Two things must be done before the number of students in the College can be reduced to an acceptable level: the University must be resolved to be more selective in its A&L Freshman admittance, and the College of Arts and Letters itself must be more willing to block the admittance of those people who are intellectually unable to succeed in the other departments. 
Let's face it, half a semester of Emil T. drives a lot of Engineering Freshmen into the noble and glorious pursuit of the Christian Aesthetic. Rather than automatically accepting the refugees from all the other departments, the College of Arts and Letters ought to consider applications to their department as though those applying were transfer students -that is to say, the College of Arts and Letters ought to reject most of them. The action, supplemented by a corresponding rise in the College's admission standards, should raise the calibre of the average student,which should encourage good Professors to come here, while at the same time improving the student faculty ratio, which would not only encourage good Professors to come h~re but good students to apply as well. The subsequent improvement in the quality of the department will encourage alumni who are interested in the school's Academic reputation to contribute more money,thereby negating the loss of money the University might s_uffer by the loss of immediate. tuition. (Since the University act~~ly l~ses money, m the e11d on each student, it is a short-range loss indeed.) In addttiOn, tf the decrease in A&L students is not accompanied by an increase in other students, the move might do quite a bit towards alleviating the housing problem. 
Sometimes the best solution is neither the most obvious nor the most pleasant solution. But since the University has decided to reduce its losses and its aspirations, and most importantly, its budget. might as well reduce its student body as well.

~·· 
Imagine that suddenly by some unknown meth_od Y~>U were totally deprived of all your physical senses. In a state hke thts, where you could not see anything, nor he~.r any sound.~, no.~ tas~;· smell or feel the touch of any object, your personality or self would be thrown back into the remoter caves of your deeper consciousness. Not being able to perceive anything from the physical world you would be more or less "lost" in an unfamiliar and potentially 
terrifying dimension. 
This new dimension would necessarily exclude some of the more familiar dimensions within which we ordinarily live our lives. The dimension of space, for example, being physical, would automatical­
ly be eliminated from this new state. The dimension of time, ti would seem though, may not be so readily excluded. Just what the nature of time is is hard to say obviously, and usually we would not think of it as something physical. But despite the nature of time, our perception of it seems to be distindly physical. We measure it t!wrugh our senses; for example, when the sun comes up there is light and when the sun goes down there is darkness; our eyes perceive this phenomenal shift and our mind, reflecting on it, concludes that time has passed. Our ears, too, help us perceive the passage of time: the varied rhythms and melodies of music let us know as they themselves are changing that there is a change in the time element. Similar examples can be cited for taste and touch and smell, but the point is that in every case we perceive time only by the changes in physical states. Whatever time itself is, we can know it only as it passes. 
It would be interesting to ponder what would happen if time, like 
any other dimension, were suddenly to collapse. If space collapsed, 
for example, everything would suddenly become two dimensional, 
and for once (at last!) we'd all be up against the same wall. If, on the 
other hand, time collapsed, everyone and everything that ever 
existed would all be present at once. This situation would be just as 
sticky as the last one but invariably more fun. The creation and 
destruction of the earth would take place at the same instant, and all 
of us would be both born and dead at the same time. And yes, we 
finally could have our cake and eat it too. 
Being humans and being aberrant creatures by our very nature, we 
sometimes stumble upon instances in which the dimension of time 
really does seem to collapse, at least partially. Most persons have had 
at least one experience about which they remark afterward, 
"everything happened at once." And likewise nearly everyone has 
had the deja vu experience in which he gets the feeling that 
somehow "this has already happened before." This may well be an 
illusion, but so may everything, including our perception of these 
words now as we read them. Such questions are bummers however. 
To get back to the original example now, it would seem that being deprived of all our senses would be a rather timeless experience. Possibly it could be compared to the state of sleep in which the notion of time is either very distorted or is lost altogether But sleep would be a significantly different experience. For one thing, the physical senses, though reduced, would not be lost entirely. Another difference is that in sleep the conscious mind is willfully seeking the relief of being subordinated to the unconscious, but in the hypothetical case we have put ourselves into the process would be just the opposite --the unconscious mind would seek to regain equilibrium by making contact with the physical world. Thus in this second case the experience of time is the thing for which we're searching, whereas in sleep it is one of the things we're trying to forget. 
Now the point which is trying to come out here is that time, like space, is an abstraction by which we orient our physical and mental lives. But the paradox of this conclusion is that when we are deprived of our ordinary physical and mental capacities time and space seemingly disappear too. Thus maybe our physical lives are the abstractions and time and space are the only true realities. Perhaps it would help us out of this dilemma if we pondered in our spare time the antithesis of what we have examined here--in other words, what happens when time is too much with us.

GOODTIME 
WAS HAD BY ALL 
As I have explained before (perhaps we'd better make that "as I have opined before") there are groups and there are bands. Add now, to these categories, a third, which we will call by the name of act--The Supremes is an act. 
An act is something that just got back from playing the Royal Bux in New York or The Thunderbird in Las Vegas or some other place similarly glittery. It comes with about IS or 16 middle-aged musi­cians in tuxedos, a couple of trunks full of shiny costumes, a small box of sheet music. and a number of full-fledged stars. 
More and more in the past few years, acts have been coming out of Detroit, home of Berry Gordy, Smokey Robinson, and the Billboard-revered "Motown sound." As the Motown record industry started to suffer from over-exposure, its people began to abandon the famous Detroit studios and took to the nights spots where people spend big money and come to see a big show. 
The transition required a few small adjustments. For one thing, the most

But it all doesn't unpretentious. Ostentatious, yes, but pre-matter that much. For me, the nice thing 
was seeing those girls on the stage all smile and glitter and knowing that they probably can't stand to sit next to each other on the plane. Or watching them leave the stage, count ten, and prance right back on for another phony encore.

What I mean is, look: the whole thing was nothing more than a show· The Supremes knew it, the audience knew it, ­and what makes it gooQ was, they knew that we knew it, and they didn't give a damn, and neither did I. 
Music can be art, but it doesn't have to be. Rock music rarely makes it, but alot of the time (lately, must of the time) it will do its best to fool you into believing otherwise. Well, The Supremes weren't trying to fool anybody, and a good time was had by all. 
Dennis Wall -------------------------------------­
·----------·------We shaII never f0 rget 
DAC'HAU' GERMAN FEDERAL RE­PUBLIC --The train stops at a small station in Germany This village is like so many others that line the tracks from Munich to the north. Yet this place is imprinted on histor's pages. A quarter of a century ago, thousands of people had Dachau as their destination, though they did not wish to come here They were the unwilling victims of man's most brutal arrogance. 
A bus-trip today completes the "pilgri­mage" to what was their destination so long ago. As I walk from the bus-stop, I can see children playing soccer on what was, twenty-five years ago, an excercise field. Another hundred yards and I walk through the entrance of a massive wall, flanked by two white washed guard tow­ers. This is the Dachau Concentration Camp. On the inside of the wall is a moat, with barbed wire fences on the far bank. I enter the first building I see, then admini­strative offices, today a museum. The exhibits of the museum are graphic, poignant and detailed. Inmates in their seemingly God-forsaken wretchedness and jailors in their inhumanity are shown, and the story of this camp is told, fron; the very beginning to the end. 
The photograph in this exhibit that most struck me was one portraying an American Army Medical Corpsman, the picture having been taken on the day of the camp's "liberation from terror." The Corpsman is standing amid a pile of corpses, corpses whose facial expressions show only too clearly that they did not die naturally. Their emaciated, broken bodies tell the same story. The Corps-man's own facial expression serves as a summation for the entire Dachau experi­ence: I hope never again to see such a look of horror, anguish and futility upon a man's face. He was struck dumb by the horrible reali1.ation of what had happened here, and by his own inability to do anything about it. He was here then, I am here now -and yet there is still a horrible realization that comes with experiencing Dachau. The last exhibit in the museum is a quote from Santayana: "Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it." 
I leave the museum now and walk the road that the prisoners here tread so many times. On my way to the prisoner's quarters I pass a monument. It says, in five languages, "Never Again." Someone has placed a flower on the top. The prisoner's rooms are small and tidy. They 
were originally built to serve 52 inmates per room, every two rooms sharing one wash-room and one lavatory. However, when the Reich expanded, the number of people here followed suit, although the "accomodations" available for them did not. 
Tri-decker beds, originally one per person, gave way by the end of the war to triple-tiered arrangements of boards, sleeping as many people as it was possible to squeeze onto them. I leave this build­ing and travel the "main street" to the gas chambers. Never used hear at Dachau, and covered with rust, they are neverthe­less frightening. 
Even more so are their bloody neigh­bors, the ovens . I do not wish to go into

Price IS rightl 
What this University needs is a good five-cent pack of chewing-gum. And, by all rights,, students at N.D. ought to be able to get it at the Huddle candy counter. However, even though the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. did not increase its wholesale pr;ces when all its major com­petitors decided to raise theirs, the retail price of the Wrigley's five-stick, "five-cent" pack of gum at the Huddle candy counter went up to seven cents along with all the others, and remains at this price. 
Several months ago, Mr. Ernest Ferro, in charge of the Huddle's operation, was shown a quarter-page newspaper ad run by the Wrigley Co. In this ad, Wrigley's told gum-buyers that if they were paying more for Wrigley's gum now than they used to, they really shouldn't be, since Wrigley's wholesale price had not gone up. Mr. Ferro's only comment was that nowhere in the ad were the prices "0.5" and "0.7" specifically mentioned -­therefore the ad must have been about dealers who were charging ten cents for a pack of gum. The issue died for lack of evidence. 
An article in this week's Time mag­azine reopened the subject, as did a little research. On page 79 of the Time dated February 8 is an article about the rising prices at candy counters. Within the article is this sentence: "Chicago's Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co., the largest chewing-gum maker, is one of the few producers to have kept the price of its basic five-stick pack at a nickel." 
Another article brought into light be­cause of this one was in the August 20, 1970, edition of the Wall Street Journal (on microfilm at the library), page one, column five: "Wrigley Co., the Chicago chewing-gum maker, tries a bit of jaw­boning. It runs ads in 540 newspapers to tell consumers it held the line when competitors raised prices in June. Wrigley says it has increased the wholesale price on its five-stick pack once in half a century (in 1960, to three cents from 
2.75 cents)." 
Mr. Edmund T. Price, director of Food Service, explained the price increase as a result of the fact that the Food Service had simply "grouped all brands of gum together, instead of differentiating," ap-
Jarently because it was easier that way. 
le also said that the Food Service does 

ndced pay as low as three cents a pack or gum, and high· as 4.4 cents, depending on the brand and from which wholesaler 
the gum is obtained. Mr. Price also 
inscription reads as he himself would seem to be saying: "This is a reminder to the living of the honor of these dead." 
The lesson of Dachau, as I see it, is this: noone has a monopoly on opinion. Neither members of government nor "sim pie citizens" have the right to deny any other man his views; no man has the right to claim priorities on judgement. Men may disagree, they may fight and. argue and indulge their passions; this may even be the nature of the world as it is now constituted. It is when men try, overcome by their prideful arrogance, to go one step further, to go beyond these moral limits, that brutality rules the world. If there are those in our own society who seek to portray their own 
opinions as the only opinions, if there are those who choose to deny the rationality that is common to all men, then I would ask them to visit Dachau. Whether they be vice-presidents or housewives or stu­dents, they must Jearn the lesson of this place. So must we all. There is a sign on the Jewish Memorial that reads: "We shall never forget." Neither will I. Let us all, for ourselves and or our children, resolve that this shall happen "never again." 
The "small Margin" the Food Service is making on Wrigley's gum certainly should appeal to many other businessmen who 
are not in the gum game. The "small 
margin"  beiug  enjoyed  by  the  Food  
Service  is  as  much  as  133%  of  the  
wholesale price.  
As  a  monopoly,  the  Food  Service  

should show some sense of fair play in this matter, and allow the student to purchase the bargain brand --if he chooses.

It was a great day for Irish 
by Jim Donaldson Observer Sportswriter "It was a great moment for Notre Dame hockey," said Irish 

r coach Lefty Smith, his face wreathed in smiles, as he sat in his office at the ACC minutes after his hustling, young skaters had upset the Denver Pioneers 4-2 Saturday night and snapped Denver's 12-garne unbeaten streak. Freshman winger Ian Williams scored three goals, registering the first hat trick of the season 
goalie Dick Tornasoni played an outstanding game in the nets to lead the Irish to victory. 
"I was very, very pleased with everyone," Smith commented after the upset. "Beating a club of Denver's caliber is a big ac­complishment." 
Denver coach Murray Arm­strong added his words of praise after Notre Dame's victory, say­ing, "They played well and de­served to win." 
The triumph gave Notre Dame a split of their weekend series edged the Irish in an exciting game Friday night, 4-3. Notre Dame is now 9-11-1 for the year, 5-l 0-1 against WCHA clubs, while Denver is 15-7-1 on the season. 

Both teams played tough de­fense in the first period Saturday and it wasn't until the last min­ute of the session that the scoring ice was broken. With Denver a man short because of a tripping penalty, the Irish tallied the first goal of the game when John Noble, taking a pass from 
upper left hand corner of the net 
from 30 feet out. The Irish led 
1-0 at the period stop. 
Notre Dame wasted no time 
in getting their second marker 
on the scoreboard as Williams 
notched his first goal of the 
game in the first minute of the 
second period. Denver goalie 
John McWilliam had gone be­
hind fhe net to clear the puck 
and ran into heavy traffic on his 
way back into the nets. While 
McWilliam was fighting to get 
back in position, Eddie Bum­
bacco gained possession of the 
puck behind the cage and passed 
out front to Williams who easily 
put the disc into the net. 
Vic Venasky cut the Notre 
Dame lead to 2-1 at the I0: 00 
minute mark in the second stan­
za when he fired a I 2-footer 
past Tomasoni. The period 
ended with the Irish on top, 2-1. 
Both clubs ran into penalty 
problems . early in the third' 
period and it was on a power 
play that the Irish registered 
their third goal. With the Pio­
rteers two men short, Bill Green 
skated over the blue line and 
into the corner to the right of 
the net. Green whipped a pass 
from there to Williams, breaking 
in toward the goal, and Williams 
lit the red light on a I 0-foot shot 
2:51 into the period. 
Less than a minute later Den­ver sprung Rick Bragnalo loose on a breakaway and he headed in alone on Tomasoni. Steve Curry came up quickly for the Irish and hooked Bragnalo from behind, although the Pioneer did manage to get off a shot, which Tomasoni turned aside. The of­ficial, instead of merely sending Curry to the penalty hox, awarded Bragnalo a penalty shot. The record crowd of 4222 was on its feet as Bragnalo took the puck at the blue line and 
skated in on Tomasoni. He faked, shot, and Tomasoni made a great save. The fans roared their approval at Tomasoni's clutch stop. 
Denver kept pressuring the Irish, however, and tallied their second goal on a power play at 
7:09. A Pioneer shot had bounced off Tomasoni's pads in front of the net where Green tried to cover the disc, but it rolled loose and Rob Palmer fired it home from 15 feet out. 
Williams pil:ked up his hat trick, and the final goal of the. night, 9:02 into the period, banging in the rebound of a shot by Bumbacco. 
Denver went all out in an attempt to tie the game, even pulling their goalie in favor of a sixth skater for the final I: 05 of

the game but Tornasoni stopped 
everything that came his way 
and protected the victory. 

Tomasoni made 42 saves in 
the game, 20 in the last period, 
and a number of them were 
spectacular. 

Coach Smith was full of praise for Tomasoni after the game, saying that "Dick had a fantas­tic game." ' Ian Williams echoed Smith's remarks, commenting, "I was pretty happy to get the hat trick but Dickie kept us in the game. Everybody just played fantastic." 
The Irish played good hockey Friday night but Pioneer net­minder McWilliam proved to be ti1e difference in that game as he turned aside a number of Irish scoring opportunities. 
Although Notre Dame put on most of the pressure in the first period of Friday's game, it was the Pioneers who got the first goal. Chris Cathcart, who played goal for the Irish, made a good stop on a shot hy Bragnalo midway through the opening stanza but the rebound went out to Palmer who, with Cathcart still on the ice, easily flipped the puck into the net. 
The Pioneers moved out to a 3-0 advantage in the second period, scoring two goals in 29 seconds early in the stanza. Brag­nalo rammed home a power play goal at 3:30 for Denver and Palmer scored his second goal with 3:59 gone. 
The Irish kept hustling though, and their efforts paid off at the 4:51 mark when Larry Israelson took a pass from Kevin Hoene, on a 2-on-1 break, faked McWilliam to the ice and slipped the puck into the net. 
Eddie Burnbacco made it a 3-2 game 8: 18 into the period, pumping in a rebound of a long slap shot by Noble.

Noble brought the Irish within one again, 4-3, at 4:54 in the third period, when he picked up the puck among a crowd of players in front of the net and put it past McWilliam. 
The Irish just couldn't tie it up, although they carne close in the final minute of play. A Denver penalty at 18:36 gave the Irish a man advantage and Coach Smith pulled Cathcart to put in a sixth skater, giving the Irish two more skaters than Den­ver, with 59 seconds to ~ hut McWilliams came up with three fine saves to preserve the win for the Pioneers. 


Austin Carr tossed in 38 points, and the team shot 67% in the second half as Notre Dame defeated Creighton 102-91 Sat­urday in the ACC. 
Sid Catlett and Collis Jones added 21 points apiece in the offensive battle which was pol­luted by 43 turnovers. Cyril Baptiste of Creighton scored 31 points and tied Catlett for high man in rebounds with 19. 
Sid was the hero for the Irish Saturday. Despite five turnovers and a couple of shots that missed the marl.c completely, Sid put forth his best effort of the season. Pulling down bounds, tipping, ball handling, shooting, everything: Sid did it Saturday. He was I 0 for 17 from the floor ( 5 for 7 in the second half), made his only free throw attempt, had three assists, and amazingly, committed only one foul. Aided by Collis Jones' 11 rebounds, Sid kept Baptiste from controlling the boards. 
But Baptiste showed why he is considered an All-American candidate. The 6-9 junior hit 12 of 18 field goal attempts and converted 7 of 8 from the line. He leaped high in the air for 19 rebounds, even though his ag­gressiveness was hindered by foul trouble. He got his third with 1 I: 03 remaining in the first half and fourth with 16:22left in the game, but managed not to foul out. 
The game was tight for the 
first eight minutes, but ND went 
on a 4Y2 minute spree that open­
ed the gap from 15-14 to 33-19. 
With 3:20 left in the half the 
Irish still held a 14 point edge, 
39-25, but two technical fouls and three straighr turnovers al­lowed Creighton to net I 0 quick points and close the gap to 41-35 at halftime. 
The first technical was called on Tom Sinn0tt who was called on a foul. Then, 30 seconds later, Creighton seemed to be kkking the ball down the court and nothing was called. The ref heard something and called the Ton Johnny Dee. 
With three minutes gone in. the second half, Creighton pulled to within two points But the Irish kept a small lead until another scoring spree started with eleven minutes to go. The lead was stretched from 66-60 to 79-63. Then, with a little over two minutes remaining the Irish led 93-75 and Dee began sub­bing. The lead expanded to 98-77 before Creighton's frantic press began causing trouble for the second string. The Bluejays outscored ND 14-4 in the last two minutes, but ran out of time with the score 1 02-91. 
It was a sloppily played game with much fumbling and errant passing. However, the shooting was often excellent, as Notre Dame hit 53% and Creighton 45%. Creighton converted 73% of their free throw attempts, and the Irish made good on 67%. 
Austin Carr hit 15 for 23 
from the floor and 8 of 11 from 
the line. He was 8 for 9 the 
second half, six of which· were 
right around the basket: fast 
breaks, drives, tip-ins, and fol­
low-ups. He hauled in seven re­
bounds, all in the first half.

WILMINGTON, N.C. -Gunshot victim Harvey Cumber, a 1:1iddle-aged white, is carried into the hospital here. Cumber was apparently killed by a black sniper as he walked down the street in an area beset by racial violence for 4 days. (UPI) 
Bayh, McCarthy thinking about '72 
TEL AVIV (UPI) -Senator Birch Bayh, 0-Ind., said Sunday he was giving "serious considera­tion" to joining the race for the 
U.S presidency in 1972. 
He made the comment after touring a Negev Kibbutl. and the Weizmann Institute on the first complete day of a four-day fact finding visit to Israel. 
In reply to a newsman's ques­tion as to whether he was seek­ing the Democratic party nomin­ation for 1972, he said, "No, but I'm seriously considering it." 
"I'm going to spend the next two months touring the country talking to the opinion takers to determine if there is enough support for this effort." 
Bayh said the Unitd States sho:ld continue supporting ls­r".el with economic and military aid. He reasserted his opposition to the latest Egyptian proposals and said it would be wrong for the Big Four to attempt to impose a Middle East peace set­tlement. 
"Any settlement that doesn't have the approval of the parties involved -ih this case the Arabs and the Israelis -is doomed to failure in the final analysis," he said. 
At about the same time, half way across the globe, former Minnesota Senator Eugene J. McCarthy Sunday declined to spell out his presidential plans but did not rule out another bid for the presidency in 1972. 
"I haven't said that I wouldn't be a candidate for the Democrat­
ic party," McCarthy said. "I 
expect to live until 1972." 
The 1968 presidential peace 
candidate made the remarks dur­
ing a meeting in New York New 
Democratic Coalition, an organ­
ization of reform and liberal Democratic groups in the state. 
McCarthy also commented 
that the manned space program 
was "too expensive for its limit­
ed gains," adding that the only 
difference between the Apollo 
14 mission now underway and 
the two other moon missions 
was ''those two lost golf balls," a 
reference to Capt. Alan B. Shep­
ard's playing with two golf balls 
on the moon Saturday.

Man !killed 1n race r1ots 
WILMINGTON. N.C. (UP!) Rat:ial violence flared anew in Wilmington yesterday when a white man was slain by a sniper in a troubled black neighbor­hood. Cov. Bob St:otl ordered National Guard units into at:­tion. 
Sporadi<.· sniper fire echoed around the black sections of this tense seaport town again Sunday after the situation appeared to have calmed down. Police re­ported trading gunfire with snip­ers in residcn~.:es ncar downtown Wilmington. 
Authorities said a white man, identified as Harvey Cum her, was driving his pick up truck through a black neighborhood when he was shot in the head. He was the second person to die in the four day old di~tur­ces. A teen-aged sniper, armed with a shotgun, was killed by a polit:eman Saturday night. 
David Murray, an aide to 
Scott, said the number of 
guardsmen to he deployed in 
Wilmington would be decided 
later yesterday. State Adjutant 
(;en. Fcre Davis rushed to Wil­
mington to take charge. 
Trouble erupted Thursday in 
the wake of a dispute by young 
blacks who issued a series of 
demands to school officials. 
The situation approached its peak Saturday night with gunfire and fire hom bings. Several per­sons were injured and one po­lit:eman was shot in the leg. 
Officers rushed to a white­owned grocery store which was set on fire for the fourth time. While guarding firemen, oen of the policemen shot an·d killed Gib Corbett, a 17 year old black youth, who was armed with a shotgun. Poli~.:e Chief E.

RA receives concussion 

Two victimized at festivities 
by Don Ruane 
A resident assistant at St. Edwards Hall received a concussion Saturday night and a friend had two cigarettes crush­ed out on his forehead when they were attacked inside Stepan 
Center during the Mardi Gras. 
Chuck DeMonaco was admitt­ed to St. Joseph's Hospital last night after being treated at the infirmary. He was taken to the hospital by a friend, Joe Gagli­ardi of Howard Hall. 
Gagliardi said DeMonaco and Chuch Jackson of 127 Howard were with dates at the festival when a ou numberin five or

more approached. One member of the gang put his har.d on DeMonaco's date and he told him to remove it. The hand was removed and when the man put it back a shoving match ensued. DeMonaco was struck on the forehead by another member of the group and Jat:kson was shoved around by three others while trying to help. At this point two cigarettes were crush­·ed out ,on the side of his head. 
DeMonaco immediately re­ported the incident to a security guard at the front of Stepan Center. According to Gagliardi, the guard told him he couldn't
