Glee Club sings for sick senior 
By KATHY LEE News Writer 
One Notre Dame Glee Club member's struggle with can­cer has led to mobilization 
and  unity  for  the  entire  
group.  
It began with  a  "splitting  

headache" in early November of 2004 that kept Coleman Barker sick all day. Barker, a senior pre-med/philosophy major, assumed he had the flu, and University Health Services gave him medicine to take the nausea away. However, even after a week, Barker's headache persisted. 
The second time he went to University Health Services, no doctors were on call. lie was forced to go to St. Joseph Medical Center. Concerned that his headache had lasted a week. the doctors decided to perform a CT scan. 
Barker, who led an overall healthy lil'nstylc~. said his ini­tial reaction to tlw diagnosis was nothing short of a sur­prise. 
"I was really shocked," hn said. 
The shock came when doc­tors told him they had discov­ered a tumor in his brain that needed to be surgically removed. The neurosurgeon at St. Joseph Medical Center told Barker he would need to withdraw ·from classes and receive immediate treatment. 
Barker called his parents, who had already heard of the tumor from his doctors, and decided he would return home to his family in Sioux City, Iowa and choose 11 clinic for surgery. Barker then went through the tedious process of receiving signatures for withdrawal from his Glasses at Notre Dame.

QUESTION OF THE DAY: WOULD YOU EVER TRY OUT TO BE THE LEPRECHAUN? WHY OR WHY NOT? 
An unfailing spirit 
I always knew that studying abroad would prove to be one of the most adventuresome times in my life -however, I did not antici­pate what would be in store for me while spending

Editor 

what was one of his last public addresses during his weekly papal audience held in an auditorium off of St. Peter's square. I did not real­ly know what to anticipate, but I was very anxious to be able to see the pope in person. 
When he was wheeled onto the stage it was apparent that his health was failing, but not his spir­it. I listened to his every word as he spoke five different languages to welcome people from all over the world to his Church. He spoke slowly and continually impressed upon the crowd his ideas for peace and his hope for a better future led by today's youth. 
It was in this past week as I watched the population of Rome double that my reflection on attending his audience really impacted me. Living less than one mile from the Vatican, it is appar­ent that John Paul touched the lives of so many. I am reminded of this fact by watching the increas­ing number of pilgrims arrive to Vatican City each day and stand in line for over twelve hours ­through the heat of day and chill of night-just to have a 30-second glimpse at his body. 
I was fortunate enough to have only waited for five hours to view the pope. Waiting in line was per­haps the best part of the entire experience. It gave my friends and I an opportunity to meet the people who came from so far to listen to the devotions and songs being offered to the pope in the square. 
It is anticipated that the Pope's funeral would be regarded as the largest manifestation of humans in modern history with over 3 million people in attendance, all pushing to be part of John Paul II's life. 
My experience here became more unbelievable when I learned I would be one of the fortunate peo­ple in the Vatican City on Friday morning. Starting at 6 a.m., I will be babysitting the children of a Swiss Guard who lives in an apart­ment bordering St. Peter's square. 
When I left for Rome I did not 
know what to expect, but I do 
know that being a witness to the 
events marking the death of Pope 
John Paul II has increased my 
understanding of the world com­
munity and proven to be one of the 
most incredible experiences of my 
life.

Cookie Monster cuts back 
NEW YORK -The "Cookie Monster" is straightening up his act. 
"Sesame Street's" beloved blue, furry monster is going to learn some lessons about moderation as the children's show kicks off its 36th sea­son on PBS. 
"Cookie Monster" will now advocate eating healthy. His "C is for cookie" song has been replaced with a new song -"A Cookie Is a Sometimes Food." 
There's more. 
The show's vice president of research and education says each episode will open with a "health tip" and there will be new characters -like talking eggplants and carrots. 
Show producers say with the rise in childhood obesity, "Sesame Street" is focusing on teaching children about healthy foods and physical activity. 
Alarm wakes heavy sleepers 
CAMBRIDGE -A 25­year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology stu­dent has invented a revolu­tionary alarm clock that makes sleepyheads find it to quiet it. 
Designed to overcome abuse of the snooze feature on most alarm clocks, Gauri Nanda's "Clocky" falls to the floor and rolls away on the first push of the snooze but­ton. 
To turn it off. a person must get out of bed and find it. 
The clock features two rubber wheels and is cov­ered in thick, 1970s-style shag carpet and other mate­rial to cushion it when it tumbles to the floor. 
A built-in computer chip randomly decides how far the clock will roll, so it stops in a different place each morning.

Originally, Aff1eck-Graves said Scott and Istvan's plan was not feasible, since it would push the ­estimated completion datn beyond the absolute deadline of Oct. 1, when frost will become a factor. 
However, due to a miscommu­nication, Affieck-Graves said he thought Scott and Istvan wanted the scaffolding removed from not only the gold part of the dome but the 'drum' as well. 
Therefore, the plan Afneck­Graves presented to the contrac­tors incorrectly called for the scaf­folding to be completely removed from the entire dome structure, not just the gold, and was conse­quently deemed unfeasible. 
"I was under the impression [Scott and Istvan! wanted the drum to be visible as well," Aff1eck-Graves said. "It was a misunderstanding. We never spoke about the actual level for the scaffolding." 
When the proposal was not accepted, students reacted to AITieck-Gravcs's response with anger. Some saw the administra­tion as turning a deaf ear to their complaints. 
Behind the scenes, though. Affleck-Graves was pushing University ofl1cials in charge of the project to keep pursuing the possibility of removing the scaf­folding. Unbeknownst to him, the plan he articulated Thursday would be exactly the same plan Scott and Istvan originally pro­posed to him. 
"I wanted to be very honest." AfTieck-Graves said. "I didn't want to mislead and allude to the possi­bility if it wasn't going to happen. But we knew all along we were going to push the contractors as hard as we could." 

Meanwhile, Scott and Istvan ­
though still hoping for the 
removal of the scall'olding-were 
pursuing alternative plans that 
would attempt to compensate for 
the sea!l'olding-covered Dome. 
"We were discussing possibili­ties that would help shift the tide and would help to show that the University docs care about the studcnl'i," Scott said. 
Scott said when he was pleas­antly surprised when told his original plan had been approved. 
"Now the seniors can take a picture on graduation day with Our Lady unscaiToldcd and the Dome glistening," Scott said. 
Seniors shared in Scott's ela­tion. 
"It's very exciting. I think it's a wonderful gesture," senior Laura I Iammond said. "Usually what the University says is linal. so I appre­ciate them compromising." 
Though she is pleased the University has responded to sen­iors' pleas, senior Casey Hotclla said it is unlbrtunate more cannot be done. 
"I wish they could takn itlw scall'oldingl all down." slw said. "Our class has gone through a lot. but at least I the administration is I listening to us." 
AITleck-Gravcs said he was pleased constructive dialogue was able to achieve an agreement that will help ealm studcnl<;' worries. 
"I want the senior class to know that their representatives have represented them in a very, very professional way," Affieck-Graves said. "The administration is always trying to do the best it can for its students. sometimes we are just faced with di!licult choices."

Prescription drugs pulled by FDA 
WASIIINGTON -The blockbuster painkiller Bextra was yanked off the market Thursday, and the government ordered that 19 other popular prescription competitors -from Celebrex to Mobic to high-dose naproxen ­carry tough new warnings that they, too, may increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. 
The warnings encompass an entire class of anti-inflammatory medicines called NSAIDs that arc the backbone of U.S. pain treatment, not just newer versions of the painkillers ini­tially suspected when the heart concerns made headlines last fall. 
The warnings -in black boxes, the strongest the rood and Drug Administration can order -arc likely to cause confusion because they won't tell patients and doctors which of these prescription drugs is a safer choice. 
In addition. the I;DA will make over-the­counter NSAIDs, or nonsteroidal anti-inllam­matory drugs. such as ibuprofen. naproxen and ketoprofen bear stronger reminders to take only low doses for a few days at a time to avoid the same risks of high-dose, long-term use. 
Pump shock sets in as gas rises higher 
Government experts claim prices will not drop below two dollars per gat/on 
Associated Press 

WASIIINGTON -There's 
pump shock at every corner 
gas station, with prices well 
over $2 a gallon and still ris­
ing. And the government 
says you better get used to 
it. 

The Energy Department 
projects high gasoline prices 
and $50-plus crude oil at 
least through next year as 
producers struggle to keep 
up with demand. 

The department said Thursday it expects gasoline prices to average $2.35 a gallon nationwide in May, the dawn of the heavy sum­mer driving season. Motorists paid an average of $2.22 a gallon last week, 44 cents more than a year ago. 
If anyone thinks prices will dip below $2, once a benchmark rarely seen, they're mistaken, says Guy Caruso. head of the Energy Information Administration, the DOE's statistical agency. 
Caruso said the forecast is for prices to average $2.jk28 a gallon through September and remain high after that, well into 2006, mainly because of lingering high crude oil prices and growing demand. He said crude prices, which briefly reached $58 this week, are likely to stay above $50 a barrel well into next year.

U.S. retailers report n1ixed March sales 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Snow and sleet last month left few consumers in a mood to shop. But with spring finally set­tling in, retailers are likely to see their business thaw, and maybe even blossom. 
Hardly anyone wanted to buy light­weight or pastel-colored clothes. And so the nation's retailers struggled with mixed sales -heavyweights Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Limited Brands had results that fell short of expectations when merchants released their sales figures Thursday. 
Still, analysts said. it wasn't all that bad. Teenagers, perhaps the hardiest of shoppers, gave youth-oriented apparel sellers including Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and Bebe Stores Inc. a solid month. And the analysts say consumers are still upbeat about spending despite oil 
prices in the $50 range and the 
threat of rising interest rates. 
March results "shows consumers 
are still resilient, but cautiously 
spending," said retail analyst Rachel 
Schechter at Thomson Financial in 
New York. "The theme that I've 
noticed is that teen retailers are 
paving the way for some great 
results," while department stores, 
which tend to attract older shoppers, 
put in a more mixed performance, 
Schechter added. 
Even some upscale retailers like Neiman Marcus Group Inc., which have benefited in recent months from the improving economy, were hurt by the weather. Other March underper­formers included moderately priced ·J.C. Penney Co. Inc., whose sales soundly missed estimates, and dis­count department store operator Kohl's Corp., which had an unexpect­
ed drop in business. 
Discounter Target Corp. was among the winners, easily beating forecasts. 
March is an important month for retailers because it sets the tone for spring sales. This year, March took on added importance since it includ­ed Easter. which typically marks the biggest surge in consumer spending between New Year's and Memorial Day. 
However, an expected sales boost from the Easter holiday failed to materialize, as last month's nasty weather kept people away from stores. 
"Despite the favorable Easter shift, sales came in all over the place, reflecting unfavorable weather and tough comparisons," with unseason­ably cold weather hampering demand for spring merchandise, Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Friedman wrote in a research note.

Our pope 
When Pope John Paul II passed away Saturday, he left a 26-year legacy of leadership, more than enough time to span most college students' lives. His longevity and his visibility -he made more public appearances and trav­eled to more countries than any pontiff before him ­made him the face of Catholicism for millions of young 
Americans.  
His World Youth Days, begun in 1985, set a  
tone of outreach and hope that reminded Catholic young adults of the critical role they play in the future of the Church.  OJhe userver

Modern art live 
On the first terrace of Purgatory, Dante, the Divine Comedy's author and protagonist, and his guide, the Latin poet Virgil, encounter works of art so breathtaking that the reader is told "Nature's very
self would there be John lnfranca put to shame." 
Dissident

Despite the incred­ible beauty and Poetry vLvid, life-like repre­sentation of the images before their. eyes, Virgil scolds Dante for lingering too long before a single marble carv­ing. As Hobert Hollander notes in his edition of the Purgatorio, Virgil appears to lack the attention span and appreciation of his companion. Hollander describes the poets as akin to a couple touring an art museum together. One wants to hurry through their tour of the exhibit but is delayed by the other who lingers, seemingly unaware of the passage of time and totally absorbed in the piece of art before him. 
Many of us have had such experi­ences, perhaps more often as one or the other of these archetypal muse­um-goers. This past December I visit­ed the recently reopened Museum of Modern Art in New York. MoMA offers perhaps the finest collection of 20th century art in the world. But such offerings do not come cheap. Admission costs $20 for an adult. a price that did not keep thousands of visitors from filling the galleries. 
For many New York area residents a visit to one of the city's art muse­ums is an obligatory component of the annual family Christmas trip into the city. One passes by the store win­dows on 5th Avenue, takes a peek at the Christmas tree at Hockefeller Center, enjoys the Hadio City Music Hall Christmas Spectacular, and then brings the children to peruse a few Rothkos in the Museum of Modern Art. Nothing says Christmas like a canvas covered only by solid blocks of red and green paint.

took on a powerful force. And for those growing up in the Church, John Paul Il's Catholicism dictated their experi­ences. 
The pope's strong stances inspired strong reactions, especially from the youth eager to shape the Church ­whether by pushing the envelope or staying the course. And nowhere is this more apparent than on the campuses 
of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
There's the roommate who advocates for a gay-straight alliance. There's the HA who plays the organ at Mass. There's the 


public works like "The Gates" that recently adorned New York's Central Park. I am also quite happy to see so many individuals enjoying the city's museums and the incredible holdings within them. even though they might need a second mortgage to do so. Yet my trips to these museums, especial­ly during periods so busy it is difficult to catch even a glimpse of the art through the crowds of people surrounding you, often cause me to wonder how much of this art is really being enjoyed rather· than simply con­sumed. 
This question becomes particu­larly compelling when one strolls through the more abstract sections ofMoMA. To understand what many modern artists are doing often requires far more information than most museums offer or most visitors could acquire in the span of an afternoon. The details shared on the tiny white cards next to individual pieces are often scant. Titles such as "Untitled #34" do not offer much help in under­standing the motivations or inten­tions of the artist. When museums do attempt to share the latent gravitas of a work they often offer phrases whose obscurity only thickens the cloud of unknowing. The work of one artist exhibited at MoMA was praised for offering an "experience in which past and present are intertwined ele­ments of an enduring proposition." If that sentence actually says anything I would be interested in having it translated into English. 
I consider the responses elicited by

such works as indicative of an intriguing cultural dynamic: the desire to appreciate certain forms of art simply because others have told us they are worthy of appreciation. It is worth considering how many peo­ple would spend twenty dollars to view seemingly identical pieces of 
non-representational art were they displayed in a New York City parking garage. 
Actually such an exhibit might be considered hip. It could prove 
particularly so if wine and cheese were offered and a 
man in dark cloth­ing plucked an acoustic bass. 
While touring MoMA I over­heard one man say to his chil­dren: "I don't know why this is distinguished, but 
that's art." Perhaps he missed something. Or per­haps he realized something the rest

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Poverty is death 
I am opposed to Shack City 2005 sponsored by ND Habitat 
 l'or Humanity. According to Habitat's Web site, the purpose of Sl1aek City is to raise awareness and funds for substandard housing by putting students in an environment where they will be compelled to eonsidcr the plight of those in substan­dard housing. At the same time, they want to create an enjoy­abln event by creating community and providing entertain­mnnt-live bands, games and a marshmallow roast. In the words of the organizer in last year's Observer article about Shack City, "This event is a way to protest the thinking that we can ignore [homelessncss) in our daily life," Iafigliola said. I agree we ignore substandard housing and poverty in our daily lives, and I applaud Habitat's efforts to raise awareness ol' and funds for the poor. However, I do not agree that sleep­ing in cardboard boxes, listening to live bands and roasting marshmallows is the best moral option. As a disclaimer, I do not believe that Habitat has any inten­tion of denying dignity to the poor. Shack City, nevertheless, sends signals to the homeless community that college stu­dents think it would be fun to sleep in a cardboard box with their friends. My strongest objection to Shack City is that the imitation of material poverty is never good. According to theologian Gustavo Gutierrez, material poverty means premature and unjust death. It is never to be imitated or romanticized which is what Shack City docs on some level. A vow of poverty or a commitment to solidarity with the poor is completely different than imitation. Solidarity means sharing and is put into action by sharing: forgiving foreign debts. distributing excess wealth and allowing the marginalized into our consciousness, etc. 
II' awan~ness and funds are the goal, we should adapt an attitud'~ of solidarity not imitation. Attend campus lectures on social issuns. Work at the Habitat house. Donatc"some money you would othnrwise spend on iTuncs or Jimmy John's or a night out. Visit the Center for the Homeless. Poverty is death, not roasting marshmallows in a cardboard box.

Daylight savings a waste of ti111e

As you are all no doubt Wisconsin well aware by this point, Badger Herald it's time to 'spring forward' as the United States enters Daylight Savings Time once again. First established in the United States shortly after World War I. DST has become engrained into the American consciousness. But need this be so? A law's presence in the books for roughly a century does not necessarily make it any more or less justified-just old. DST is a decrepit law whose intended purpose is muddled with ambiguity. Its perceived benefits are outweighed by the tangible costs it creates. 
Historical arguments in favor of DST gen­erally rest upon a few now-faulty premises. One is the supposed benefit DST would pro­vide in relation to farmers. giving them an extra hour of sunlight with which to work. 
Another argument commonly used is that it helps businesses. By giving consumers an extra hour of' sunlight after work, they can use the sunny weather to go shopping. While there may be slight benefits from delaying sunset an hour, this rationale alone is not reason enough to justify such intru­sion. 
The primary argument, however, and the most convincing for the time in which the law was enacted. was that of energy conser­vation. Give people an extra hour of sun­light after they get home from work, and the aggregate savings in energy costs due to unused electricity would be fairly large. At least. it might have been in the '70s. 
With more and more electrical equipment occupying space in people's homes whose usage has little to do with the setting and rising of the sun, particularly the wide­spread growth of air conditioners, such a small amount of energy savings is hardly worth the costs.  
And what are these costs? Beyond simply stealing an hour of your sleep for one night.· some have argued that DST creates a 'sleep deficit,' in fact contributing to an increase in automobile accidents immediately follow­ing the 'spring forward.' In addition, the costs involved with keeping track of this change are numerous, as well as the fact that individual states can choose to opt out of DST anyway. Indiana suffers from this confusion, with neighboring counties being under different times, hurting the ability for businesses to interact with one another by increasing the costs. 
Confusion, at the very least, ought to be reason enough to halt this laughable policy. But sadly, tradition inevitably creates iner­tia-why change something when it's 'always' been that way. Even though it has not. 
The perceived benefits of DST policy an~ extremely slight at best. non-nxistnnt at worst. We may get our hour back in the f'all. but it shouldn't be taken away in the first place. Ironic, then, is the !'act that when tiH' government acts to try to save time, it really just ends up wasting it. All too telling, but not very surprising.

Coverage of pope, Schiavo tough to miss 
So. Did you hear the pope died? I bet you did. In fact, I'm nearly sure of it. 
According to TVEyns, a digital media monitoring snrvicn, the word pope was nwntioned a staggering 8,321 times by tlw combination of' National Public Hadio 
Alex and the major televi­Koppelman sion outlets from 
Friday morning until University of 
midnight Sunday­Pennsylvania 
that's once every 30 Daily 
seconds. Pennsylvanian 
Fox News alone mentioned him over 2,000 times. And according to Eric Boehlert of salon.com, Sunday's major newspa­pers were little different. 
The Detroit Free Press ran 11 sto­ries about the death of the pope; my hometown Baltimore Sun ran 14. The Los Angeles Times had 15 articles on the pope, including an obituary span­ning 7,339 words, 10 times the length of this column space. The New York Times ran 16, and Long Island's Newsday ran 41. 
There were some times this week­end when the story seemed ever-pres­ent: Pick up a newspaper, turn on the TV, even sign on to AOL Instant Messenger and you were guaranteed to read something about the pope. It was nearly impossible not to. 
But I bet you didn't hear about the Hcpubltcan senator who, on the Senate f'loor. rationalized the recent murders of federal court judges and their families, saying that it could be directly traced to the people's frustra­tion with what he termed "political decisions," like those in the Terri Schiavo case and the recent banning 
of juvenile execution. And I bet you 
didn't bear about the latest large 
attack by insurgents in Iraq, in which 
40 American soldiers were injured. The speaker of the House essentially 
giving up on the Social Security 
changes that have been a major issue 
ror President Bush? Probably didn't 
hear aloout that either. 

Of course the death of the pope is an important story: lie is a vital figure for millions of Catholics, as well as a respected world leader. and his actiom: and decisions played a vital part in shaping the post-Cold War world. 
But think about the word news. The very word implies that any news is, well. new. And that's what the news should be-important and newswor­thy precisely because it is something you don't already know. But after the actual death of the pope, very little happened. He was moved to public viewing, and that was about it. There wasn't, during the days of wall-to-wall covera:ge, an election of a new pope or even any solid information on who might he elected. There was absolute­ly nothing unexpected about the story, nothin1~ new to report, and yet it somehow merited round-the-clock covcra:~e. at the expense of breaking stories that continued to develop in unexpected and important ways. 
The constant attention paid to the death of the pope, much like the media frenzy that surrounded the death of Terri Schiavo, is hardly sur­prising. "If it bleeds, it leads," is the familiar motto of many a news organi­zation, and any of those organizations' ratings and circulation will be vastly improved by a story where the bleeder is someone beloved the world over. 
Conservatives will tell you that the problem with our media is a pronounced liber.al bias, but they're wrong. The real problem with today's news isn't a subjective and largely false notion of bias: It's money. Once, the important part of the news was the story; now it's the potential profit in the story. 
It's cheap to cover the death of the pope or Terri Schiavo or the court case of Michael Jackson. Plant a talking head in front of the hospital or courtroom, and you're 
done. But break the story of

FTT professor Magnon-Park reflects on 'Ong-Bak' and martial arts 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Secno Wri tcr 
Aaron Magnon-Park is a professor in the Department of Film. Television and Theatre. Magnon-Park teaches film and television aesthetics. film history. pan­Asian cinema and international action cinema. 1/e is currently working on research projects on the transnational dimensions ofthe Hong Kong action cine­ma and the discourse of han [everlasting woe} in contemporary Korean cinema. 
Q: What are your overall impressions of"Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior"? 
A: I think it's a phenomenal film. We're used to martial arts extravaganzas corn­ing primarily from Hong Kong. In some ways, due to the exodus of !long Kong talent with the return of !long Kong from a British colony to a special administra­tive region of mainland China, there's a certain loss of quality of the actio1f"spunk that epitomized I long Kong action as dis­tinct and worthy of global recognition outside of the llollywood tradition. 
Other national cinemas with stronger economic development such as Japan and South Korea would seem to be natu­ral sites of resurgence, and in some ways there are examples of that. But when we go south to Thailand, it's a country that is still developing and has a very distinct martial arts tradition -Muay Thai. In some ways, this film surpasses the mar­tial legacy that has long been the domain of I long Kong action cinema. 
Q: I low docs this film compare with a typicall!ol!ywood action film? 
A: My hope is that students will see this film and re-engage with action cinema (through Asian action cinema) and will understand the inherent limitations of over-technologizcd Hollywood action cin­ema. In some ways, it's the endless battle between a rich film industry and a poor film industry -rich and poor in terms of access to finances and latest technology. The Hollywood way is to pump more money into more technology, and that will create action, whereas in some ways the Asian film industry's approach is one in which the human body has to deliver the action. 
Q: Why was this a film that was able to cross over into a more mainstream and global market? 
A: I think there's a certain degree of investment and extra-financing that came into the film. along with savvy pro­motion of the film on the film festival cir­cuit to the point that it reached a global audience, and (good for us in South Bend) two years down the line the possi­bility of seeing it here. The film had a limited release in the United States. There is a.lso a tradition in the martial arts of trying to provide a new martial arts style, and so we can say that in Ong­Bak we have Muay Thai grounded as martial arts du jour. 
Q: What does Ong-Bak say about the future of Thai cinema? 
A: I expect the star (Tony Jaa) to con­tinue having martial arts action cinema roles, perhaps even being invited to work in Hong Kong or the United States. And it will provide added finance capital for Thailand now that they've demonstrated an artistic look but commercial savviness and the quality of production values. 
Q: How does Tony Jaa fit within a par­ticular tradition of action cinema stars? 
A: Bruce Lee was very nationalistic and ethnocentdc, trying to demonstrate the power of Chinese kung fu. With [Ong­bak), there is no doubt that Muay Thai is identified very strongly with its national origins in Thailand. When Jaa has [one particular] fight, his opponent is verbally recognized as Burmese and promotes a Burmese approach to martial arts. 
Here also with Jaa, it is a form of authentic kung fu because of the creative and select process of bringing in the most cinematically significant or vibrant moves for fight sequences. 
From Jackie Chan we have the tradi­tion of the cinematic technique of fore­grounding that [he performed the stunts and hard-to-perform martial arts moves] without the use of harnesses or safety devices [by using] overlapping action, both double and triple. So in Ong-Bak we visually recognize the most physically demanding and life-threatening sequences when we see the event shot from two or three camera angles and shown in its full completion one after another. This creates a break from the linear narrative, it's a disrupting device, but it really highlights the spectacular performance. 
Jet Li began martial arts training from an early age, [but has) a youthful appear­ance. So he shares a certain charisma with Jaa that is more pronounced than Lee or Chan. Jet Li in some ways signifies a complete amalgamation of the militant Chinese version of screen masculinity for China. Ong-Bak has created the same kind of image for many films to come that will continue to try to establish the same kind of cinematic signature for Jaa's career. 
However, Jet Li does use wires (a form called "wire-fu"), whereas most of Jaa's vertical leaps are done without the assis­tance of wires, so he's like a gazelle. Scenes like those in "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" use wires, and while you may not notice it ori the first viewing, you can later register that technique. 
We also have a case where in foreign martial arts films, unlike the first kung fu invasion in the early seventies, where we get to hear the original language. It's not dubbed into some kind of compromised English that in many ways undermines the thematic content and devolves into some kind of campiness or comedy that is not part of the original script. 
Q: Why is this film a good selection for the Asian Film Festival? 
A: That's a complicated question. There are several issues that go into selection of fllms for a film festival. One of the most important aspects for us being in South Bend is that we are geo­graphically isolated and not part of the regular film festival circuit. So while this film would be easily accessible in a major city, having it come here (especially in a 35 millimeter film print) would be almost impossible. 
This film was also chosen as a way to break out of the predictable realm of Asia. Far too often, we tend to focus on the far East, with China and Japan domi­nating. The notion of Asia has to be much larger. As a Thai film. "Ong-Bak" is part of southeast Asia. In the future we would love the possibility of bringing in a film from every country in Asia. 
What we're trying to do with the !ilm festival is start small, and demonstrate that there is critical demand on campus and within the community. In future evo­lutions of the film festival we would enlarge the selection of the films that we bring in and the guests that we bring in for screenings. Ultimately, there are some films that just need to be seen on the big screen in order to be fully appre­ciated, and "Ong-Bak" is one of them.

Team_ set to com.pete on rigorous Tri-State course 
By ANNA FRICANO Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's Golf team has four more events between now and the NCAA Championships in May, and the Belles will travel to Tri-State University this weekend to try to put a victory on the list. 
This weekend's one-day event, which takes place on Saturday, ought to have much more to offer the ladies in the way of golfing conditions. The forecast for this weekend is warm and sunny, with little chance of pre­cipitation. The day should be a nice change for the golfers, who were faced with a spring snow storm just one week ago. 
The team will be playing this weekend at Zollner Golf Course on the Campus of Tri-State University. The course has been the three-time host of the National Collegiate Golf Championships as well as the site for Sectional State Open Qualifying and Indiana PGA Junior Age-Group Champion­ships. It is known for its strategi­cally placed water hazards and hilly terrain and is considered by many as the "thinking player's" golf course. 
Seniors Stefanie Simmerman and Julia Adams will be looked to in order to perform especially well for the Belles this weekend. Last weekend, Simmerman tied the top finisher of the day, Colleen Groomes from Otterbein College with a score of 8 3. Adams came in at a close third with an 84 on the day. However, the entire team worked together to produce a tournament-record score of 357 at the Player's Club Course last Friday, and it is that depth that will be counted on to earn a respectable finish this weekend at the Tri-State Invite. 
Coach Mark Hamilton believes that his team has the experience that it takes in order to perform well this weekend and continue toward their goal of earning an invite to the NCAA Championships. 
He also wants to make sure that his golfers are able to save their best for exactly the right moment. 
"We're working, as a team, on peaking at the right time," he said.

Irish look to extend streak 
Boilermaker Invite is expected to feature a talented field ofgolfers 
By KEVIN BRENNAN 
Sports Writer 

Coming off two straight tour­nament victories, Notre Dame will look to continue its win­ning ways this weekend at the Lady Boilermaker Invitational. 
The tournament, hosted by Purdue, will feature a very competitive field of 13 teams. Each team sends six golfers to the tournament. Each round, the team's four lowest scores make up the team score. . 
The Irish will be led by jun­ior co-captain Katie Brophy and sophomore Noriko Nakazaki. Brophy leads the Irish in scoring with a 75. 92 stroke average for the year. Nakazaki is coming off her first-ever individual tourna­ment victory at last weekend's Indiana Invitational. 
Senior Karen Lotta, fresh­man Jane Lee and freshman Alejandra Diaz-Calderon, who will be making her debut on the traveling squad, will round out the Irish lineup. 
"We are really expecting big things from her," Lotta said of Diaz-Calderon. 
"She has been playing really well. We hope that this is her breakout tournament that she can be in the lineup regular­ly."

The field is filled with other Central Regional teams with whom the Irish are competing for a spot in the championship tournament. Five of the teams -Michigan, Kent State, Texas A&M, Purdue and Northwestern -are currently ranked higher than Notre Dame. The Irish realize how significant it would be if they

"There are a lot of Central Region teams there that we need to beat," Lotta said. "We are really just going to try and finish as high as we can because every team we beat here is really important for our standings."

Irish hope to end home season on positive note 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
After a disappointing loss to Southern Methodist University last weekend, the Irish are hop­ing not to drop the ball against Ball State. who visit Notre Dame on Saturday for the mens' final home match of the season. 
"I think like most seasons, we've had ups and downs," coach Bobby Bayliss said. "Last Sunday was a down, but I think we've got a chance. to finish strong and in the top 25 ­that's our goal." 
As the season waned, the Irish have had trouble building momentum, although Bayliss remains confident in the ability of his young players. 
"It starts again -it starts with Ball State," Bayliss said, pointing out that the Cardinals dropped a close decision to a highly-ranked Louisville squad on Wednesday. "We know they've played us 4-3 the last two years, last year we won the last match.... Theyre a pretty good team, [and] they're as well coached as anyone in the coun­try, so we expect to have our hands full." 
However, the Irish are looking forward to the challenge. · 
"That's kind of the way you want it at the end of the year ... to make yourself as viable as you can for the NCAA tourna­ment," Bayliss said. 
The Irish are healthy and ready to finish the season as strongly as they began. 
"The core of people that we've been playing are probably healthy and will play," Bayliss said. 
Brent D'Amico is expected to return to action after sitting out against SMU. According to Bayliss, he practiced on Thursday and looked "strong." 
Bayliss expects the doubles point to be a challenge, as the Cardinals defeated a top-notch Illinois team who beat the Irish in March. 
"They are very strong in dou­bles, they won the doubles point from Illinois," he said. "We'll have to play exceptionally well to be competitive in doubles." 
Overall, Bayliss considers his team ready to finish the season on a high note. 
"It's a great group of guys and we've fought pretty hard," Bayliss said. "I think its going to be a great contest, a terrific chance for people to spend a nice Saturday afternoon. I promise you it's going to be a competitive match. They're very scrappy and they've got some guys with weapons."

Hope remains undefeated with 5-4 win over Belles 
By TIM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 
Tho Flying Dutch of !lope College knocked oil' the Bnlles, 5-4, Thursday afternoon at Saint Mary's to maintain lirst place in the MIAA with a 4-0 confernnce rm:ord. 
Thursday marked the lirst time sinco 2000 that Saint Mary's (3-6) lost to llopn (8-7), junior co-cap­tain Kristen Palombo said. The loss droppod the Belles to fifth plac1~ in the confernnce at 1-1. 
"I lope b the kind of team that's always been in the top half of the confnrence," Palombo said. 
"Wu've been lucky in the past couplo of years to close it out, but we lacked that today." 
Coach Dm~ Stevenson pointed to tlw Bellns' doubles play as the decisive factor in Thursday's loss. 
"I thought we noeded to win two out of thrne doubles, and we only won one," Stevenson said. Winning two would have taken the pn~ssure ofT of singles play, which the team split, 3-3. 

The highlight of singles play came from Palombo's three-set victory over junior, and fellow No. 1 singles player, Anneliese Fox 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-4 -handing Fox her first conference loss in three years, Stevenson said. 
''I'm on cloud nine," Palombo said. "This is one of those moments where you have to be proud of yourself. It's the best I've played all year." 
Stevenson agreed. 
"She normally plays very well, and today she played very smart," she said. 
"Kristen had a game plan going into the match. She followed the game plan." 
Palombo agreed with Stevenson that the execution of her game plan carried her to victory. 
"We have the exact same scheme," Palombo said of Fox. "We're backboards. We make each other move around. She knows what I'm trying to do, and I know what she's trying to do­and I was able to outlast her." 
The Belles' biggest point earners on the day were sophomores Caile Mulcahy and Kelly McDavitt, who won their No. 2 doubles match as well as their singles matches. 
Palombo was particularly impressed with McDavitt's perse­verance in her singles match, which she came back to win 0-6, 6-4,6-0. 
"Kelly played a great match," Palombo said. "It was really great for her conlidence because when you loso a match 6-0, it's human nature to want to throw in the towel." 
Coach Stevenson credited McDavitt for her ability to make impromptu adjustments. 
"We had to change the game plan in the middle of the match," he said. "She did that, and it threw her opponent oil'." 
Though the loss dropped Saint Mary's to the middle of the pack in the standings of the nine-team conference, Palombo remained optimistic towards the rest of the conference season, which the Belles have won two out of the last three years. 
"We're still a young team," she said. "We have a lot of players get­ting more experienced. llopefully these matches will teach us some­thing." 
The Belles will have their next crack at a conference foe in their next game April 13 at Kalamazoo College (6-3, 2-1 MIM).

Team looking to secure much-needed win over Adrian 
By TOM STILES SportsWriter 
Saint Mary's (5-12) will look to notch its lirst conference win this Saturday aftnrnoon at 1 
p.m. when they visit MIAA foe Adrian College (6-13). After having dropped their last nine ganws, the Belles l'ind them­
' ' 

selves in desperate need of a win if they want to salvage the season. 
Adrian comes in looking for its second conference win and, much like the Belles, is in need of a confidence-building victory. Adrian has dropped three of its last four games, most recently splitting a double-header with Tri-State University, who swept the Belles Monday. They enter action this weekend at seventh place in the MIAA, two spots ahead of last place Saint Mary's. 
Saint Mary's will look to capi­talize on the recent play of Adrian College, which has been sub-par. Adrian is currently dead last in team batting aver­age and second to last in team ERA. Saint Mary's is sixth in each category, which should correlate to a better record, but the Belles' shoddy fielding in recent games -fielding per­centage of only .869 -has wasted solid pitching perform­ances. 
The Saint Mary's offense has gradually begun to show improvement over the last few weeks. In fact, the Belles rank in the top five in hits, runs scored, and total bases. The pitching has also shown signs of coming around, but errors have proven to be the Belles undoing as they lead the con­ference with nineteen miscues. 
The games Wednesday against Albion College proved no different from the tone of the season, as the Belles com­mitted twelve errors in both games combined, which result­ed in 14 unearned runs between the two match-ups. The Belles' bats came alive in both games, scoring six runs in game one and five runs in game two. 
Game one saw junior pitcher Bridget Grall fall to 3-6 on the season, despite surrendering only two runs in a game that needed extra frames to be dncided. In game two, fresh­man pitcher McKenna Corrigan was roughed up for six earned runs on ten hits as she fell to 2­6 on the year. 
Up next for Saint Mary's fol­lowing Saturday's double-dip with Adrian College will be an April 12 match-up on the road against a talented Calvin College squad (12-4).

Associated Press 
AUGUSTA, Ga. Opening Day at the Masters brought some familiar sights Thursday­first the rain, then the names atop the leader­board that included defending champion Phil Mickelson and world No. 1 Vijay Singh. 
But don't get the idea this was just another typi­cal day at Augusta National. 
Tiger Woods hit an eagle putt that went off the green and into Rae's Creek. Ernie Els spent more time in the trees than in the fairway. Former champion Billy Casper returned to the Masters for the first time in three years and made history with the highest score on a hole 
(14) and the highest round (106). 
Jack Nicklaus teed off to a heartfelt ovation in what might be his last Masters. 
And when a wet and wacky start to the 69th Masters ended in dark­ness, Palmer was on the leaderboard -not four­time winner Arnold Palmer, but Masters rookie Ryan Palmer. 
Of the 24 players who managed to squeeze in the first round, Mark Hensby of Australia was the club­house leader at 3-under 69, showing that Augusta National doesn't have to be crusty and firm to be a brute. 
Chris DiMarco, who showed Mickelson the line on his winning putt last year. birdied three straight holes and was atop the leaderboard at 4 under par with four holes still to play. 
Luke Donald of England was another shot behind and four holes left in his first round, while the group at 2 under included Mickelson, Singh, Palmer, Retief Goosen and Stuart Appleby. 
Players were to return at 
9:45 a.m. to complete the first round, and barring any more weather delays, the tournament should be back to normal by the weekend. 
This was the ninth time in 15 tournaments that weather interrupted play. and the fourth straight week of rain. 
Trying to hold down his No. 1 ranking, Singh was a model of consistency in a first round that was out of whack before players even arrived at Augusta National -tee times were pushed back five times as more than an inch of rain fell, leading to a 5 1/2-hour delay and players starting from both tees. 

IN BRIEF 
~chilling roughed up in ftrst start 
INDIANAPOLIS -Curt Schilling gave up seven runs in six innings in a rehabilitation start for Boston's Triple-A Pawtucket farm team Thursday, then said he's ready to start for the Red Sox next week against the New York Yankees at Fenway Park. 
"I felt great," he said. "Going into today, I wanted to get mentally ready. I stretched it out. No fatigue. I felt strong. I'm going to go out and compete against the Yankees on Wednesday. I'll be ready." 
Schilling, recovering from offsea­son ankle surgery, allowed 11 hits, including two solo homers, .a triple and a double. He struck out six and walked none, throwing 77 of 104 pitches for strikes in a 7-5 loss to the Indianapolis Indians. 
After throwing 47 pitches and struggling with left-handed hitters in the first two innings, he retired 12 of his last 16 batters, striking out four. 
Francona did not have 
heart attack 
BOSTON -Red Sox manager Terry Francona did not have a heart attack and results of medical tests on him "are very good," Boston's team doctor said Thursday. 
Francona was hospitalized in New York on Wednesday morning after feeling tightness in his chest and was transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital later in the day. 
The team did not say when Francona might rejoin the Red Sox, who begin a three-game series Friday in Toronto and will receive their World Series rings before Monday's home opener against the New York Yankees. 
"The plan is to perform several series of tests on Terry," Dr. Thomas Gill said in a statement released by the club. "The results of the initial series are very good. 
Davenport downs Peschke 
AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. -Lindsay Davenport needed just 55 minutes to beat Kveta Peschke 6-2, 6-2, before rain postponed most of the afternoon matches Thursday at the Bausch & Lomb Championships. 
No. 5 seed Venus Williams and Marta Domachowska were tied at one set each before the delay. They will finish their match Friday. The winner will face Davenport. 
The match between second-seed­ed Serena Williams and former Bausch & Lomb champion Mary Pierce was also moved back a day to Friday. 
Matches scheduled for Thursday evening included third-seeded Anastasia Myskina's against No. 15 Shinobu Asagoe. Rain was forecast in the area for most of the night. 
Venus Williams lost the first set 6­3, but came back to take the second set 6-4. The players were tied at 30­30 in the first game of the third set when the rain came.

Notre Dame to rely on depth in weekend matches 
In Thompson's absence, teammates step up, look to collect pair ofwins 
By ANN LOUGHERY Sports Writer 
ConlidnrH~I~ and composure will be nsSPntial to No. 28 Notre l>anw's success this weekend as it chaiiPngns No. 16 William and Mary in tlw linal home meet of tlw season Saturday and No. 35 Indiana at Bloomington Sunday. 
With last wepkend's 5-2 win owr Long Bnarh State. the team cll~monstratnd it is more than pre­pared to takt~ on the potent William and Mary and Indiana teams. Notrn Dame's (9-8) ability to remain poised under pressure will ultimately determine the out­come of this wnekend's matches. 
"We've had a couple of tight matches this season where it's conw down to 4-3," Louderback said. "I think these matches will be like that. but I think our kids are getting more used to those kinds of matches. It will just be a matter of going out and playing." 
Whiln the match against William and Mary will be a cru­cial one for the team, it will be one of special importance to Sarah Jane Connelly because it will be hnr last homn match don­ning an Irish uniform. 
"It will bo hard to seo hnr leave," Louderback said. "She's been good at doubles all year and she's been playing well at singles. Slw startml stepping up at just the right time. exactly when we need­ed her. She's been a good leader for us on and o!l' the courl<>." 
More recently, Connelly has assumed a position at No. 5 sin­gles as part of the adjusted lineup since sophomore Christian Thompson was sidelined with a knee injury. Junior Lauren Connelly has also been playing in Christian's No. 3 position, junior Kiki Stasnty has been competing at No. 4, and junior Uz Donohue has rounded out the lineup at No. 
6. Christian Thompson is expect­ed to retain her position at No. 1 singles with sister Catrina in this weekend's meets. 
Despite Notre Dame's talent­laden lineup, defeating the Tribe of William and Mary (15-2) will be a tough chore. In their most recent meet. the Tribt~ bestnd No. 48 Virginia Commonwealth, 6-1. winning live singles matches.. and two doubles matches. 
William and Mary also boasts three ranked singles players ­No. 34 Megan Moulton-Levy, No. 122 Candice Fuchs and No. 62 Mngan Muth. Fuchs and Moulton­Levy also represent the Tribe in national rankings, coming in at No. 23. The duo of Muth and Amy Wei are ranked No. 48. 
Louderback said he predicts a tight and emotion-charged match · against William and Mary, espe­cially considering it is Notre Dame's last horne meet. 
"William and Mary is just a solid team all around," Louderback said. "But I think we can play with them. We just have to take one match at a time." 
No. 36 Indiana (1 0-8) looks to be just as competitive as they return to the courts after a 5-2 win over No. 35 Wisconsin. Indiana nearly swept doubles. with victories at Nos. 1 and 2, and were just as successful in singles with wins at Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 5. 
Louderback expects the in-state rivalry will add to the competitive atmosphere.

Notre Daine heads into pivotal weekend 
Team is set to host No. 2 Duke, Stanford in upcoming meets 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 

The Irish have a perfect opportunity to turn around their season as they play host to two opponents this weekend. Notre Dame (3-6) is set to take on No. 2 Duke at 4 o'clock today 
="""'"'= before squar­ing ofT against Stanford Sunday after­noon. 
Friday and Sunday's games mark the second 
s t r a i g h t Coyne weekend of the Irish homestand, as last weekend the team split games, losing to Connecticut, 13-10, before topping Rutgers, 12-9. Overall, Irish head coach Tracy Coyne was pleased with 
the way her team performed and said she is looking for them to improve in these upcoming 
games. 
"Even though we lost the UConn game, last weekend was very good," Coyne said. "One thing we're focusing on is start­ing strong, and we started strong again [against Rutgers and Connecticut." 
But Coyne remains anxious to see more consistency from her players. 
"We started strong, we fin­ished strong, but we have to stay strong [throughout the game," she said. 
Despite the quality of her team's opponents, Coyne is con­fident her team will be ready come game time. 
"Duke is a very strong team, they're solid in every single aspect," she said. "Last year, we upset them, and we're looking to give them an equally strong game." 
Notre Dame will be led by jun­ior midfielder/attacker Chrysti Foote, who was recently named co-Big East player of the week for the week ·ending April 3. The nomination marks the second time Foote has received the award this season, as she was also named player of the week on Feb. 28. Foote currently leads the team in both goals and assists, with 20 goals and nine assists. 
ller performance, as well as that of her teammates, should be st~ong this weekend, as Coyne has definitely noticed home field advantage at work with her team during their recent stretch. 
"March was tough, we were on the road so much," she said. "Being at home, we can focus on our gameplan rather than trav­e.1" 
As the games approach, Coyne is aware of the heightened sense of competition that comes with the weekend's contests. 
"As a team, we feel more of a rivalry towards Duke," she said. "Our rivalry with Stanford is more institutional."

sive personnel. 

"Usually, you'll have only one tight end on the field," Weis said. "But I have pack­ages where there's two tight ends and three tight ends. So after I deal with the quarter­back and the five linemen ­so you know you have six on the field -then I try to figure out from the rest of the skill people who the best guys are from the different packages and try to put them in the best position." 
Anthony Fasano (6-foot-4, 260 pounds) is the leading candidate to become Notre Dame's number one receiving option out of the tight end slot after a 27-catch, 367-yard, four-touchdown showing in 2004. 
Like the rest of the players 
at the position, Fasano also has needs to improve. 
Though Billy Palmer (four catches, 34 yards, one touchdown) and Jerome Collins (six catch­es, 67 yards) will not return to Notre Dame next fall, junior Marcus Freeman, sopho­more John Carlson 

and freshman Tim Gritzman are working to provide Weis with the tight end depth he needs to implement the maxi­mum number of offensive packages. 
"The role of the tight end is going to be up to us," Carlson said. "How we perform is going to decide how much the [coaches] use the tight ends. Obviously, if we make plays, they're gonna put us on the· field, so hopefully that will

happen." 
As of now, the multiple-tight end talk is only that, though the players seem anxious to turn the talk into action. 
"We haven't actually put in the three-tight end [forma­tion) yet, but I mean, the more tight ends the better," Fasano said. 
The high number of tight ends isn't the only thing that can benefit an offense. Years of experience spread out among the potential contribu­tors add another positive vari­able to coaching the tight end position. 
"As of right now, there's a lot of talent and tiered experi­ence [at the tight end posi­tion)." Weis said. "And by that I mean [the players] are not all the same year in school. When you have tiered experi­ence, it gives you the opportu­nity to not only play them but also to groom them at the same time." 
Fasano said a major positive of spring practice has been 
that the tight 
ends, as well as 
and run the 

routes and get open, I think it'll give the offense a big advantage," Fasano said. 
Tight ends coach Bernie Parmalee characterized his group of tight ends as talented and willing to Jearn. Also, in the same matter-of-fact man­ner as Weis, Parmalee said he has his own opinion and phi­losophy on how those players need to improve. 
"They all have the ability, they've just got to work the

technique," Parmalee said. "You've got to understand the technique. You've got to understand what the guy on the other side is trying to do to you, and you've got to beat him to the punch. You've got to outsmart him. 
"It's all about leverage and a lot of things you have to do to put yourself in a better position or better situation to execute the play." 
Meanwhile, as Parmalee 

works on technique, Weis will 
o-bserve and identify the avail­
able talent. 
"You look at all those guys [at tight end]," Weis said. "How well they pick things up and how well they perform on the field helps me make my mind up as far as how I'm gonna handle personnel pack­ages and get more of them involved in the game plan."

Ball State took a 1-0 lead in the top of the fourth, taking advantage of some sloppy Irish dnfense. Sarah McGregor led ol'f' the inning with an inlinld single and stole second base.

pressure of the situation. we just didn't handle it very well." 
Coming into the game, the Irish were sitting at 5-2 and needed to win out in order to guarantee themselves a spot in the NCAA tournament. 
Now they will have to rely on outside circumstances. After a scoreless first quarter, Denver got on the board with 
13:58 remaining on Ryan Zordani's fourth goal of the sea­son. 
Notre Dame quickly answered back when Drew Peters netted his second goal of the year with 
11:56 remaining. 
The rest of the game pro­gressed accordingly. Denver would score, the Irish would answer, and then Denver would respond again shortly after. 
Denver's defense was also relentless. 
"They played very well. They pressured us all over the field,'' Corrigan said. "I thought we were athletic enough to handle that pressure, but we didn't look like it today." 
Denver took the lead 3-2. 3:15 before the half on Matt Brown's 21st goal of the season. 
The Irish came out of halftime and quickly tied the game at three when Brian Giordano found Jim Morrison with a clear shot at the net. 
Unfortunately for the Irish, Denver scored back-to-back goals 15 seconds apart and regained the lead for good. 
Morrison and Peters each had two goals for the Irish. Matt Karweck added a goal and two

from his cheering section in the crowd. 
"I think Dan Ott had an excel­lent performance," Saltine fan and Dan Ott enthusiast Pat Leimkuehar said. "There were even cries of 'good shot honey' from his girlfriend on the side­lines." 
Ott's girlfriend, Karen Wiborgh, was unavailable for comment. 
Off In The Shower struggled offensively all game, committing seventeen turnovers. Their lead­ing scorer was center Mike Telerio with four points. Telerio struggled on the defensive end, however, and was unable to con­tain Lund and Tocey. 
Lund capped the contest with a game-point breakaway dunk after a steal from Ott. The center, who had previously declined dunking on a fast break in favor of a layup, gave his reasoning after the game. 
"We were in a hurry to get home and watch The O.C.', so I thought a dunk was the quickest way to end it," he said. 
The Saltines showed confi­dence heading into the later rounds of the tournament. despite the fact their next oppo­nent also has two players approaching six-and-a-half feet tall in its lineup. 
"Our next opponent has a cou­ple guys who are 6-foot-5, but then again. so do we," Lund said. "We feel like we're as talented as any team we've seen so far." 
The Mila Experience Featuring Srsen 21, Rob's Got Game And So Does His Flat Twenty Harem 
3 
In one of the most dominating defensive performances of the night, The Miia Experience Featuring Srsen blew out Rob's Got Game And So Does His Flat Twenty Harem 21-3. After the game, Experience captain Miia Rasine and her team began a new victory tradition that they hope will continue for several games. 
''I'm going to take them all out for ice cream now." Rasine said following the final basket. 
The Experience scored the first fourteen points of the night, keyed by hot shooting from point guard Mark Srsen. who scored seven points for the game. 
The Harem had trouble finding a rhythm on offense and lost con­fidence after missing several open shots early. The Experience defense was suffocating, forcing 21 turnovers. 
After the game, Experience players were humble, playing down their dominating perform­ance. 
"It was a hard fought battle from start to finish despite the score," Srsen said. "The other team fought hard. It was a lot of fun to play against them.'' 
Srsen also expressed reserva­tions about his team's chances to advance beyond the next round. 

''I'd say we have a 25 percent chance, depending on who we play," he said. 
But experienced forward Mark Hubrty was more confident. 
''I'm going to dunk on [Irish varsity quarterback] Brady [Quinn]," he said. 
Hubrty did not dunk during Thursday night's game. 
Black Wall Street 21, Promise Billing 16 
The Black Wall Street versus Promise Billing game featured the most heartwarming come­back story of the young Bookstore Basketball tourna­ment. BWS shooting guard Kevin Fussner returned to Bookstore action for the first time since los­ing a nipple in action last year in the 21-16 Black Wall Street win. 
"Last year at Bookstore we were playing shirts and skins and I took a dive and actually lost part of my nipple," Fussner said. "Luckily, it grew back since.'' 
Fussner played valiantly through the pain that fateful day, but it was not enough. 
~·we ended up losing that game," he said. "This was my first game since losing the nipple. It was hard to overcome that." 
Promise Billing forward Nicole Gill felt Fussner's injury might turn out to be a disadvantage for BWS. 
"We thought we'd have an advantage because their team only had nine nipples," she said. 
As a show of good faith and sympathy for Fussner's injury. 
· the Promisers invited BWS over for a pre-game get together. However, the proceedings turned sour when two Black Wall Street players did not show up. 
"It wasn't fair. Two of their players skipped out on our pre­game festivities," Promise Billing point guard Megan Miller said. 
The flap over the pre-game meeting turned the game testy early. Miller went down with a bloody nose midway through the first half but returned to action and went on to score six points. 
"It really hurt, but I sacrificed for the team," Miller said of her injury. 
Promise Billing kept the game close with hot outside shooting, a skill Miller says the team had practiced frequently by book­store standards. 
"We worked on [our shooting) for six weeks in practice, every day.~ she said. 
Black Wall Street opened the game in a zone defense but quickly abandoned it when Promise Billing got hot froni the outside. 
"We started in the 2-3 zone to conserve energy, but it didn't really work," he said. "They started hitting outside shots and we had nothing." 
Promise Billing eventually cooled down. however, and the game became mired in defense. All in all, it took over an hour to play. 
However, Fussner said the long duration of play did not bother him. 
"I didn't realize it took an hour. It was fun," he said. "But I was winded the whole time." 
Promise Billing brought out their special "suit jacket and tie" uniforms for the big game in an attempt to gain extra motivation. Promisers fan Claire Ferris explained the significance of the special uniforms. 
"We're playing Black Wall Street, so we thought we'd fake them out a little by wearing suit

Our Lawyers Made Us Change The Name Of Our Team So We Wouldn't Get Sued 21, We Heart Spooning 7 
Although We Heart Spooning was fired up going into their game with Our Lawyers Made Us Change The Name Of Our Team So We Wouldn't Get Sued, it was not enough to stop the athleti­cism of the Unsued. 
The Spooners bounced onto the court yelling and firing up the crowd at the beginning of the game, only to fall behind 11-1 at halftime and go on to lose 21-7. 
Unsued captain and small for­ward Tom Meyer attributed his team's victory to their unusual training techniques. 
"We spooned a lot," he said. "We love spooning. They say they heart spooning, but we must like it more." 
. Also key to the Unsued victory was the play of center Matt Bold. Bold, who wears an afro wig while competing, scored six points in the contest. 
"The fro gives him an extra couple inches," Meyer said. Bold said the hair has further significance as well.  
"It's for character, but it's also performance enhancing," Bold said. "When I wear it, I can fly. The air gets up underneath it and lifts me off." 
After Bold and the Unsued jumped out to a quick lead, the Spooners played even with them for much of the second half. Unfortunately, they went cold again when the score reached 18-7. The Unsued then scored three straight for the win.

"Maybe that saves the bullpen a little for game three," he contin­ued. ''I'm hoping that will be a spark for us." 
Last season Notre Dame split its regular-season series with Boston College before defeating tho Eagles in the opening round and the title game of the Big East Tournament. 
Boston College leads the Big East with a 6-1 record. with all of those conference games coming on the road. 
"They are doing well. You can see their program growing through the years. It's going to be a tremendous challenge for us," Mainieri said. "We have to go out there and compete hard this weekend and get whatever we can, come back and regroup and hopefully make our stretch run at home." 
Manship is slated to start game 
· Ahree of the weekend series. IIe didn't make the trip to Rutgers last weekend after feeling some discomfort during his mid-week throwing. 
But Mainieri said Manship felt pretty good after throwing on Tuesday. 
"He'll start the game on Sunday at Boston. hopefully give us two or three innings and be a step in his progression," Mainieri said.

Hartmann sparks Irish comeback 
Fourth-inning home run hoists team over Cardinals in 4-1 win 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER 
Senior Staff Writer 
With the Irish playing sloppy softball and her team down 1­0 in the fourth inning, Liz Hartmann took matters into her own hands. 
With runners on the corners and one out, Hartmann blast­ed a home run to left field off Ball State starter Amy Brownfield. Notre Dame took the lead and would add an insurance run later in the inning to earn a 4-1 victory. 
"I rounded first thinking the ball was going to hit off the wall, but I saw the umpire sig­nal that it was out. I was shocked," Hartmann said. "I was sure it was going to graze the top of the wall. It was nice to take the lead and put them away after a sloppy beginning to the game." 
With the victory, Notre Dame (22-8) extended its winning streak to 11 games. Ball State (12-23) only managed three hits all game off Irish pitchers Heather Booth and Steffany Stenglein. 
Booth started the game, pitching the first four innings and allowing three hits and one unearned run. She was replaced in the fifth inning by Stenglein, who did not allow a single Ball State baserunner and struck out six of the nine batters she faced, including five in a row at one point. 
"Heather really only gave up one hard hit ball," Irish coach Deanna Gumpf said. "Most of the hits were little dribblers. but those caused damage because they were able to

The Irish knew coming into Thursday's game with Denver that they were going to have their hands full. 
What they did not know was that they would be outplayed on both ends and fall 9-6 to a team that was equally hungry for a win coming into the game. 
Notre Dame learned exactly why every game matters. as it dropped its first league game this season at a time when the Irish needed it most. 
"We just didn't respond well to the pressure today," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said. "To their pressure on the field, to the
