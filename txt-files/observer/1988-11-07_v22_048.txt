isn't it an indication that in some way we have 
failed or ·are inferior or don't have "what it 
takes?" 

No. And now is when seniors have to ingrain 
that in their minds. 

Most of us have not experienced much serious 
rejection (SYR dates notwithstanding). Even 
when applying to colleges, how many of us came 
to Notre Dame because we couldn't get in 
anywhere else? 

Then the final year at Notre Dame rolls 
around and seniors begin to prepare for life 
after college--maybe tr;ying to get into a good 
grad school or interviewing for the ideal job. 
We've always been pretty successful in our en­
deavors before, so this should be no problem 
and we all should get exactly what we want, 
right? Not true. 

The catch is that everyone applying for jobs 
and spots in graduate schools is very well­
qualified. 

The companies interviewing on campus have 
their pick of Notre Dame students. Unfortun­
ately, they can't take every person who inter-· 
views with them so most get rejected from one 
company or another. 

I'm not saying "don't worry, be happy (even if you get a rejection letter)." I am saying this 'is a time when it is so important to keep the job search in perspective--not to let a few rejec­tions convince you that you are destined to work at McDonald's with high school students. 
I lost my perspective when I interviewed with 
one of my "dream" companies. I was devas­
tated when I was told the company "would not 
be continuing the interview process" with me. 
My first thought was my qualifications and ex­
periences really aren't that great; next, I do 
awful in interviews and will never get asked 
back for second interviews; then, I don't have 
whatever it takes to get a job; thus leading to 
the conclusion that I will never get a job. 
All this from one interview. Fortunately I have friends who do keep things in perspective. 
One friend said one out of 10 or 12 companies you interview with will make a job offer. From his perspective, he had a few down but only a few more to go before an offer. 
Another friend asked me what was the worst thing that could happen if I didn't get a job through Career and Placement. Well, I wo';lld have to hit the pavement and conduct a JOb search like just about everyone else has to. 
He told me how fortunate we are at Notre Dame because we have opportunities to inter­view with prospective employers on campus, while so many students at other universities don't have these opportunities, and even more people don't have college degrees. Yet we have degrees from Notre Dame, which gives us a jump on others in the job market. 
He's right. 
Something else I realized is every company in every industry has different needs. A rejec­tion simply means you may not fit the exact specifications of that company, but there are other prospective employers out there whose specifications you do fit. 
The point is that rejection is unavoidable, but it can't make you not want to try for something. It isn't failure. It isn't an indication you are inferior or don't have "what it takes." It is an experience that might cause you to look at things a little differently, but then again, every­thing looks a little differently after college. Maybe it prepares you for when that time comes.

Andres plans events at SMC 
By CATHLEEN MEERE News Staff 
Although Dennis Andres was appointed director for confer­ence and events services at Saint Mary's just this year, he has already indicated he has big plans for bringing new events to the college. 
Andres said he has developed a five-year plan for coordinat­ing special campus events at the college by trying to "get anything and everything I can that's appropriate." 
''The job involves coordinat­ing schedules and finding clients, whether they be faculty members, students ...or other, off-campus per­sonalities, for banquets and shows," Andres said. 
Andres said he arranges for both campus organizations and outside groups to use confer­ence rooms, theaters and other campus facilities. Opening the college's facilities to different

Groups Andres deals with range from bagpipe performers to comedians to ballet companies. "Clients should be appropriate for the Saint Mary's (audience), and they should bring in money," he said. Profits earned from the events are put into the school's general fund. 
Andres' responsibilities for planning and scheduling campus events include provid­ing programs for St. Mary's students' and faculty mem­bers' enjoyment. 
Andres said he is both happy and excited about his new po­sition. He said he feels comfort­able in the Saint Mary's envi­ronment and looks forward to

Associated Press 
SEOUL, South Korea-Tens of thousands of screaming protesters clashed with police Saturday throughout South Korea, demanding the arrest of former President Chun Doo­hwan on corruption charges. 
Riot police in Seoul fired tear gas to block a 10,000-strong crowd from marching to the former president's house. The protesters threw rocks and firebombs. 
At least 11 officers were in­jured, authorities said, includ­ing 10 hurt when a police sta­tion in Seoul was pelted with rocks and firebombed. Dozens of protesters were seen injured and carried away, but police gave no' figures for the total number of injuries and arrests. 
Tear gas filled the streets of seven other South Korea cities­-Wonju, Chunchon, Cheju, Kwangju, Taegu, Taejon and Pusan--as police fought stu­dents at anti-Chun rallies, aut­horities reported. 
The scandal over corruption allegedly committed by Chun and his family has been the major political issue in South

"There isn't the thematic dif­ference" that has pervaded presidential contests in the past. Mason said. "President Reagan said it best: we are the change. It's not as clear a man­date as in 1980, when there was such a screaming need for change." 
That was the year Republicans rode Reagan's coattails to a 12-seat pickup and control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter-century. In 1986, an eight-seat gain en­abled Democrats to retake con­trol. 
This time, Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis have been criticized for running a race devoid of issues, devoted mostly to personal attacks and distortions of each other's records. 
So issues in this year's Senate campaign have been largely drawn from a list of topics that Democrats claim as their own, although they have been used 
Korea since the Summer Olym­
pics in Seoul. Opposition 
groups rejected a governing 
party offer Saturday for Chun 
to make a public apology for 
his alleged misdeeds in office. 
Students in Seoul burned ef­
figies of Chun, President Rob 
Tae-woo and Uncle Sam, and 
thousands of citizens cheered 
and shouted ''Arrest Chun Doo­
hwan!" 
Rob was elected in Decem­
ber to replace Chun, who held 
office seven years. The election 
followed months of anti­
government demonstrations. 
In Pusan, an opposition 
stronghold south of Seoul, 
police fired tear gas at 
thousands of protesters trying 
to burn an effigy of the former 
president after a street march, 
according to Yonhap, the South 
Korean news agency. 
Pollee also battled groups of . slogan-chanting protesters in 
Kwangju, after students razed 
two police buses, shattered doz­
ens of windows and damaged 
eight cars in a firebomb attack 
on a government prosecutors' 
building. 
One student was injured 
by candidates of both parties: 
the environment, education, 
social security, health care and 
"family issues" like child care. 
Also prominent in Senate 
stump speeches and advertis­
ing have been the problems of 
drugs and crime. 
Most Senate incumbents of 
both parties appeared likely to 
win re-election on Tuesday, but 
there were several prominent 
exceptions. 
Analysts said Republican 
Sen. David Karnes, who was 
appointed in 1987 to fill an un­
expired Nebraska Senate term, 
was the most likely to be 
ousted. Democratic former 
Gov. Bob Kerrey, a popular fig­
ure, held a heavy lead in polls. 
Three other incumbents--two Republicans and one Democrat--also faced difficult battles for survival. 
In Nevada, GOP sen. Chic Hecht, who for months had been considered the most vul­nerable Republican incum­bent, has fought back to a dead heat with his challenger, Dem­ocratic Gov. Richard Bryan. 
when he fell out of a third-floor window. 
In Seoul, police martial arts squads drove protesters into side streets, beating and kick­ing them, but the protest swelled with thousands of other citizens demanding Chun's ar­rest. 
Thousands of riot police using armored vehicles fired volleys of tear gas at more than 15,000 protesters at one crowded shopping area. 
During the Seoul rally, leaders called for bigger rallies next week and vowed to attack Chun's house.

Gunmen were behind failed Maldives coup 
Associated Press 
MALE, Maldives--Military officials tried to break a high seas standoff Saturday night with gunmen who staged a failed coup in Maldives, seized 25 hostages and were holding them aboard a crippled boat, officials said. 
Two Indian warships tailed the boat in the Indian Ocean, and military officers were negotiating by radio with the gunmen for release of the hostages, Indian and Mal­divian officials in Male said. 
"We have not yet reached any conclusion. There are many lives involved. There are threats to life," said Maj. Zahir of the Maldivian security forces. He gave only one name. 
"We are trying to solve the problem as soon as possible," said Zahir nearly 48 hours after the ship left Male, the capital. 
Officials said an aide to former President Ibrahim Nasir participated in Thursday's pre-dawn attack and may have instigated it. 
Nasir, who lives in Singapore, denied involvement. 
In Male, members of the se­curity forces patrolled the gray sand streets. Businesses and shops were closed because of a national day of mourning for those who died in the violence. 
India's top diplomat in Male said 27 to 32 people were killed when 150 gunmen--believed to be Tamil mercenaries from nearby Sri Lanka--attempted to overthrow President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. 
"This figure is probably un­derstated, because the mer­cenaries may have removed their dead," Ambassador A.K. Banerjee said. He provided no breakdown on the deaths, but said 25 people were taken hostage aboard the vessel. Ear­lier reports had said there were 18 to 20 hostages. 
The mercenaries fled early Friday after Indian paratroopers landed to help Gayoom and his lightly armed security forces in the Indian Ocean nation, which is also known as the Maldive Islands.

5 reported injured in south Lebanon raids 
Associated Press 
Sidon, Lebanon--Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed the shop of a boat dealer suspected of links with PLO guerrillas Sunday, demolishing the business and wounding five people, two of them seriously, police said. 
The Israeli army said its warplanes destroyed a Pales­tinian guerrilla base in South Lebanon. It did not mention casualties. 
Lebanese police said four Is­raeli Cobra helicopter gunships blasted the shop and a nearby citrus grove with eight rockets in two sorties. The shop in the southern port of Sidon was closed at the time. 
A police spokesman, who cannot be named under stand­ing regulations, said the shop owner, Mahmoud Hijazi, was suspected of renting two motor­boats to PLO guerrillas and selling the guerrillas spare parts. 
It was the sixth Israeli air strike against guerrilla targets in south Lebanon in three weeks and the 21st this year. By police count, 108 people were killed and 204 wounded in raids since Jan. 3. 
Hijazi's motorboats, anchored off the beach about 600 yards from his shop, were not hit in the raid, police said. 
Earlier police reports said aircraft attacked guerrilla bases in the teeming Ein el­Hilweh refugee camp on Sidon's southern outskirts. Police said the guerrillas in the camp opened up with anti­aircraft fire but were not tar­geted by the Israeli aircraft. 
Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen also killed three guerrillas who apparently landed in a boat on the Medit­teranean coast just north of Is­rael, the army command said. 
An Israeli army announce­ment said the base attacked Sunday was used for launching attacks and ammunition storage. It said all planes that took part in the raid returned safely. 
The brief announcement gave no further details.

Suspect is found in computer virus case 
Associated Press 

ITHACA, N.Y.-A Cornell 
University graduate student 
whose father is a top govern­
ment computer-security expert 
is suspected of creating the 
"virus" that slowed thousands 
of computers nationwide, 
school officials said Saturday. 
Robert Morris Jr., 23, a first­
year student in a doctorate 
computer science program, 
has a reputation as an expert 
computer hacker and is skilled 
enough to have written the 
rogue program, Cornell in­
structor Dexter Kozen said. 
The New York Times quoted 
sources as saying Morris 
created the virus, which on 
Wednesday night began infect­
ing an estimated 6,0Q0 univer­
sity and military computers 
connected through the Arpanet 
computer network established 
by the Pentagon. 

The virus slowed down com­
puters by replicating itself over 
and over and taking up 
memory space, but it is not 
believed to have destroyed any 
data. 
The origin of such programs is hard to investigate, and it may be impossible to trace the virus back to Morris, said M. Stuart Lynn, vice president of information technologies at Cornell. 
"At this stage we're simply not in a position to determine if the allegations are true," Lynn said at a news confer­ence. 
"It's quite conceivable we 
may not be able to say with any 
certainty" if the virus was 
created in Cornell's computer 
system, he said. 
He said the university had 
been contacted by the FBI, but 
there was no indication any cri­
minal charges would be filed. 
Officials said the school could 
discipline Morris if he was in­
volved. 
The FBI said it was launch­
ing a preliminary inquiry to de­
termine whether federal law 
had been violated. 
Morris could not be reached 
for comment Saturday. His 
roommate, Chansong Da, said 
Morris did not come home 
Friday and she did not know 
where he was. University offi­
cials also were unable to con­
tact him, Lynn said. 
Reached at his home Satur­day in Arnold, Md., Robert Morris Sr., chief scientist at the National Computer Security Center in Bethesda, Md., would not say where his son was or otherwise comment on the case. 
The elder Morris has written 
widely on the security of the 
Unix operating system, the tar­
get of his son's virus program, 
the Times reported. He is 
widely known for writing a pro­
gram to decipher passwords, 
which give users access to com­
puters. 
Cornell ·officials said they began examining Morris' com­puter files Friday night after the Times identified him. 
Morris had passwords in his files "for some computers at Cornell and Stanford to which he is not entitled," although those could have been placed there by someone else, Lynn said.

Grad student: political hypocrite? 
As usual, I bumped into my friend Gabby the grad student down in the li­brary pit. He immediately spied my "George Bush '88" button and gave me a sullen look. "How can you support that guy, with his awful record on the environment?" he asked as he drew on yet another cigarette. "Our air is hardly fit to breathe as it is. Besides, intellectuals like us shouldn't be so po­litical." He exhaled a cloud of smoke in my direction, and then suddenly ex­amined his watch. "Darn! I'm late for the anti-apartheid vigil! Remember what I said about politics," he warned as he rushed off. · 
Kevin Smant 
on politics 

Gabby is very typical of a graduate student here at Notre Dame. Let's say he's a complex individual. He wants very much, for example, to fit into the "mainstream" of graduate student life. To be accepted, though, one must meet certain political and ideological tests. For, despite protestations to the con­trary, graduate student life here and elsewhere is as political as any smoke­filled room stuffed with politicians. 
For one thing, Gabby is sure to be anti-establishment, anti-big-business, pro-union, and generally pro-"people" in his conversations. He warned me 
that big-business controlled the TV net­works; he eagerly discusses with his friends in the economics department the progress of Sandinista labor unions in Nicaragua (although he hasn't had much good news there lately, come to think of it); and he routinely bemoans the fate of the homeless in the face of Reagan administration policies. I asked him whether he could actually prove that "millions" of homeless ex­ist, but he just glared at the can of Coca­Cola in my hand. "Don't you know about the Coke boycott?" he snapped. "Can't you show any compassion? 
·You're so self-centered." 
In other words, there are a lot of 
things Gabby doesn't like. Last week, 
I interrupted another one of his lectures 
on the plight of the average worker to 
ask him how his dissertation research 
was going. "Oh, not bad," he said. Sud­
denly a look of disgust crossed his face. 
"But I was at the University of Chicago 
library last week, and you wouldn't 
believe the people I had to put up with. 
I saw one librarian reading 'People' 
magazine. All the guy at the gas station 
wanted to do was talk about some 
bears, -or something. I don't even like 
animals. Why don't they keep their zoos 
locked up?" he grumbled. 
I suppressed a smile and volunteered 
that the attendant probably meant 
Chicago's professional football team. 
He looked disdainful. "That's just what 
I mean. Football ought to be banned. 

This country is full of hillbillies, buf­foons and fools. Ordinary people know nothing about real culture.'' I was con­fused. "But you just. ..about the average worker ..."It was no use. 
He's the one lamenting the dominance of the "establishment" and what the "system" does to people, while rushing off to hand out leaflets for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. 
Graduate students also must always display a rather slippery characteristic they call "tolerance." It is hard to tell what it means. But I guess it explains why Gabby and his friends always talk and write about homophobes, racists, chauvinists, elitists, ethnocentrists, "McCarthyism," and so on. I never realized the world was such a danger­ous place. 
But then, going back to the issue of race, I never realized it occupied his mind so much. When he wants to inspire himself, he quotes Martin Luther King, Jr.--you know, about eliminating !he acute consciousness of race so that everyone can join hands and sing "free at last," etc., without regard to skin 
color. Of course, then he immediately goes on to lament the lack of re<dly ef­fective affirmative action quotas, or the lack of classes devoted solely to black authors, or the paucity of black faculty 
members here at Notre Dame. 
"P,eople's skin color shouldn't mat­ter!" he thunders. "Intolerance is ram­pant on this campus." 
In short, I suppose everyone knows 
Gabby. He's the one lamenting the 
domfuance of the "establishment" and 
what the "system" does to people, 
while rushing off to hand out leaflets 
for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. He 
wears his cynicism on his sleeve, and 
laughs when I show emotion on an 
issue, while at the same time hurrying 
to organize anti-apartheid rallies and 
Coke boycotts. He dreams of economic 
"cooperation," the end of the profit mo­
tive, and a leveling of the "gap between 
rich and poor." 
Meanwhile he also envisions his first 
full-time teaching job. Then he can fi­
nally get that new car he's been wan­
ting, that nice suburban house, a VCR, 
his own den, a steadily rising 
salary....I overheard Gabby just yes­
terday, talking about Dan Quayle. He 
was laughing. "What a hypocrite!" he 
chuckled. I laughed too. But not at Dan 
Quayle.·

Economic formula predicts accurately 
Imagery: Graphic in its presentation and powerful in its persuasion. The American public has been saturated with stories about the impact of such imagery, with the Bush campaign's commercials cited as indisputable. Network news programs have covered these commercials almost as much as the candidate. Further, they have hinted at the haunting power of the phantoms behind the scenes who created them--the infamous "media gurus." 
Ed Yyevoli 
guest column 

But just how much do these commer­cials sway the American electorate? Will people vote against Michael Dukakis because of a minute of black and white footage ofprisoners walking through a revolving door? Do people vote for George Bush because his grandchildren are cute? Other evidence of why a particular candidate will win seems to imply or even confirm the contrary. 
A September edition of The Econo-· mist presents a formula which picks who the American electorate will choose on November 8 and by how much. Curiously, this formula does not include a variable which estimates which candidate has slandered the other more effectively. Instead, it relies solely on inflation, real growth (especially in the year before the elec­tion), and incumbancy. When the arti­cle was written the formula gave George Bush 55 percent of the vote, today the formula would probably g1ve him 54 percent (this is my estimate which has not been confirmed due to a 
lack of data). Whether this is the for­mula's exact number or not, it is im­portant only that the scheme has predicted the incumbent party's share of the vote with astonishing accuracy. In the last· six elections it has erred within an average of one percentage point. 
The first quick objection to such for­mulas has been the presentation of other schemes which are accurate but obviously have little to do with politics, for example, the taller man always wins, an American League world series victory helps the Republican Party, and the New York Mets success on ban­ner day correlates to a Democratic vic­tory. However two important distinc­tions must be drawn between these "forumlas" and the economic indicater formula. First, these astrological predictions don't give us numbers, just winners; second, they lead to conclu­sions about the American public which are absurd. Most people don't remem­ber how the Mets did on banner day. 
But what conclusions does the eco­nomic indicator formula lead to? One above all others, the major economic indicators have a greater impact that any other single factor on the outcome of a presidential election. This is not to 
. say that George· Bush could have simply read the formula and retired to Kennebunktport with his name resur­facing only on the ballot.. We must not forget the early lead Mike Dukakis en­joyed immediately following the Dem­ocratic Convention. But we must also

All of what has been said is not a reason to ignore the world of Roger Ailes and the Bush campaign team. Al­though the BushQuayle team did not come out ahead in the three debates these men and women have created powerful commercials which coincide well with the theme of the Vice­
President's campaign. The above is also not an excuse for the inadequacy of the Mike Dukakis team of Sasso, Brountas, and Estritch. They truly have done a poor job at advertising their man, and organizing a single theme for his campaign. I agree with columnist Fred Barnes that Mike Dukakis seems to have. been running as if he were the incumbent since the Democratic Convention. I submit that Mike Dukakis would have had to run like Ben Johnson to beat the formula in '88.

Democrats abandon the "little guy" 
Imagine this scenario: AN otre Dame class is in progress. A shout comes from the hallway that the building is on fire. The flames are spreading, threatening to engulf the whole structure. 
· What's to be done? I dare say those in the classroom would get their priorities sorted out in a hurry. They would certainly stop the class at once. Not because what they are doing is uni­mportant, but because they not have more pressing concerns. Like saving. peoples' lives. Like trying to put out the fire. 
Edward J. Murphy 
guest column 

I submit that the issues in the current presidential campaign are rather like this. There is one issue of such over­powering importance that it dwarfs all other concerns. I am referring to the fact that over the past 15 years the lives of more than 21 million Americans have been destroyed in abortuaries of this country. And the grisly business con­tinues unabated. 
Every working day in the abortion mills of this country more than 5,000 people are killed. This means that every day the number of babies killed by abortion in the United States is nearly equal to the number of students who live on this campus! And since Roe 
v. Wade was decided in 1973, effectively withdrawing legal protection from un­born children, the number of lives lost exceeds the total combined population­-man, woman, and child--of the follow­ing cities: Phoenix, Birmingham, Little Rock, San Francisco, Denver, Hartford, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Peoria, Indianapolis, South Bend, Cedar Rapids, Louisville, New Orleans, Baltimore, Boston, East Lansing, Ann Arbor, Detroit, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Newark, Albuquerque, Santa Fe; Buf­falo, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Tulsa, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Nash­ville, Dallas, Houston, Salt Lake City, Richmond, and Milwaukee. 
This is an evil of monumental pro­portions. Without a doubt the question of legal protection for unborn babies is the watershed issue of our time. There­fore how candidates stand on this cru­cial question is of overriding impor­tance. 
What if, when the classroom building catches on fire, one said: "Well, I am personally opposed to fires in buildings, but I don't think government should be involved. I don't believe we should call the fire department." 
Or if one said: "Well, I admit that the fire in the building is an important issue, but it is but one of many impor­tant things going on around here. So let's not be one-issue-oriented and be­come preoccupied with putting out the fire." 
And, of course, one might say: "Let it burn! Nobody is going to tell me I have to leave this class and try to put out a fire. Let people burn-up if that's their choice." 
As a boy growing up in a small town in central Illinois, I recall how my fa­ther, a Democrat, proudly affirmed this political affiliation by saying that Democrats were for the "little guy". Dad did not live to see the day when the political party, which he proudly supported, shamelessly abondoned the most helpless and defenseless of the "little guys", the children iJrttte womb. He would have been heartbroken, as was I, to see this once great party be­come the pro-abortion party, the party of death for the innocent unborn. 
Recently, the Catholic Archbishop of Hartford, Archbishop Whealon, resigned from the Democratic party for precisely this reason. Earlier on, Bis­hop Vaugan of New York did the same thing. These bishops have the priorities 
You Democrats would not for a single instant remain a member of a political party which es­poused human slavery. 
right. When the building is on fire, you must set aside other tasks and try to put out the fire. When babies are being killed at the rage of over one and a half million per year, you must concentrate upon stopping the slaughter. 
If you believe, as I do, that the most pressing need right now in this country is to restore legal protection (yes, con­stitutional protection) to all human beings, then I put this challenge to you who call yourselves Democrats: Get out of the Democratic Party. 
This is the time for action. There will probably never be a more opportune time in your lifetime. The Democrats have nominated a man for president who'is staunchly pro-abortion. Consider that Michael Dukakis introduced pro­abortion legislation in the Massachu­setts Legislature, at the behest of a notorious Boston abortionist, three years before the infamous Roe v. Wade decision.

hope that before you vote this Novem­ber you will take a look at the agenda of this organization. 
.Let me point out one item of this agenda for you to ponder. Because the Catholic Church is pro-life, regarding abortion as a most serious transgres­sion of God's law, and because many Church leaders have urged Catholics to ber of the ACLU. Think about it. 
What a powerful blow it would be for civil rights in this country if thousands, indeed millions, of Democrats would tell the leaders of the pro-abortion support pro-life candidates, the ACLU believes that the tax exempt status of the Catholic Church should be recinded. Do you believe that? Well, the ACLU believes it, and the Democratic can­didate says he is a card-carrying mem­
party that they have had enough. They aren't going to take it anymore. They can no longer be taken for granted to ·vote for pro-abortion Democratic can­didates just because Mom and Dad are 
or were Democrats. 
Over a century ago many good people walked away from a political party which had become the pro-slavery party. You Democrats would not for a single instant remain a member of a political party which espoused human slavery. You would walk away, and you should. Just as people in the last century chose freedom instead of slavery, 
choose life today instead of death.

Election forum explains issues 
Dear Editor: 

On Monday, Nov. 7 at 7:00 p.m., Omicron Delta Epsilon, the economics honor fraternity, will sponsor an elec­tion forum in the library auditorium. Profs. David Betson, Kenneth Jameson, and James Rakowski of the economics department will offer their knowledge­able opinions and answer questions from the audience. 
While there have been various debates on the presidential election here on campus, none have explained the economic policies that Vice Presi­dent Bush and Governor Dukakis are proposing as this forum will. A stu­dentifaculty reception with food and beverages will follow. So do yourself a favor and shed your ignorance of the current economic problems facing the next president by attending this forum.

Shuttle bus needs improvement 
Dear Editor: 

Over the past few weekends, it has come to iny attention that the late night shuttle bus service is in need of im­provement. I particularly noticed this on Friday, Oct. 29. Due to the many dances and other activities taking place that weekend, the 2:05 run to Saint Mary's, which is supposed to be the last run of the night, was so packed that the driver had to make an extra run to ac­commodate everyone. Cramming the bus over three times its safe capacity is dangerous to passengers as well as a strain on the driver. It is highly in­considerate to risk injury to others by pushing, shoving, and otherwise stam­peding to secure a place on the bus. If it is imperative that one get home 
When the driver makes extra runs during the night, he is doing so for the sake of students' safety. Thus it is only proper that he should be treated with respect. However, this was certainly not the case Friday night. On the second run, several students begged the driver to wait for their friends who were on their way. If one expects to utilize the shuttle service, particularly late at night, it is not too much to ask that the person be on time to catch the bus rather than inconveniencing the driver (lnd other passengers by expecting them to wait. If students want per­sonalized service, they shoulq call a taxicab. 
Once the shuttle was finally on its way, the behavior of many of the pas­sengers was downright obnoxious. There was pointless screaming all the way home. When I politely asked an exceptionally loud girl to please keep her voice down, she merely smirked and said, "We're too cool to be quiet!" No, my dear, you're too inconsiderate to be cool. 
If there are several events going on in the same night, there should be extra buses running. If this compiles the costs of dance tickets or activity fees, so be it. Better a few extra bucks to ensure our safety than several million dollars in lawsuits when an accident occurs and serious injuries or death results.

Tough TCU wins over ND swimmers 
By KEVIN REISCH Sports Writer 
As they headed down the final stretch, Irish swimmer Chris Petrillo appeared to have a shot at victory. However, his Texas Christian opponent had other intentions, making a pow­erful lunge and reaching the wall a fraction of a second before Petrillo. 
This 400-yard freestyle relay Friday night at Rolfs Aquatic Center provided a fitting con­clusion to the entire competi­tion at the Notre Dame Invita­tional. The Notre Dame swimming program turned in a strong showing but continu­ally had to settle for second best against a tough TCU squad. 
"Texas Christian redefined the level of competition at this meet," explained Irish coach Tim Welsh. "They gave us a new standard to approach." 
The Irish men's team, out­scored by the Horned Frogs 226-162, finished ahead of Illinois-Chicago (138), Wabash (132), Xavier (114), Marquette (84), and Wayne State (50). 
Exhibiting strength in the 
distance events, Notre Dame 
improved upon its results from 
the previous night, when it fell 
to TCU in a dual meet. In the 
1000-yard freestyle relay, 
Ismail 
continued from page 16 
said Rice coach Jerry Berndt, whose winless Owls fell to 0-8. "We made two crucial mis­takes. We had a couple of guys out of lanes. But as soon as he hit it, I knew he had a touch­down." 
Ismail surprisingly got the chance to return another kick­off with the Irish leading 38-9 early in the fourth quarter. "The Rocket" showed his grat­itude by picking the ball up off the ground, cutting to the left

combined for a win with a time 
of 9:40.68. 
Sophomore Jim Byrne played 
a key role in three of five 
second-place outcomes for the 
Irish. Employed as both a 
leadoff and an anchor man, 
Byrne paced his relay teams in 
the 800-yard freestyle, 400-yard 
butterfly, and 400-yard back­
stroke races. 
In the 3-meter diving event, 
Ed Veome and Adam Hirschfeld sprung to the top with a combined score of 392.65. . Veome and Pat Dugan teamed up to capture second in 1-meter 
diving. 
Like the men's squad, the 
Notre Dame women looked im­
pressive despite dropping the 
majority of events to their 
main adversaries. The Horned 
Frogs sped past the Irish (226­
186), who in turn topped Xavier 
(130), Illinois-Chicago (114), 
Saint Mary's (112), and Mar­
quette (58). 
Sophomore Amy Tri entered 
four races and incredibly led 
her relay teams to second place 
each time. The combination of 
Acampora, Quirk, Pamenter, 
and Moster in the 400-yard 
backstroke relay accounted for 
a triumph in 4:16.15. 
In the 1-meter diving event, 
Jennifer Kipp and Allison 
Baker captured the crown. by 
side of the field and racing 83 yards to burn Rice for another touchdown. 
"The last one we were just trying to squib it and take away their rhythm, but they still hit on us," said Berndt. 
The second touchdown kick­off return tied a school record previously set by Paul Castner against Kalamazoo in 1922. 
While Ismail's kickoff returns gave the Irish enough points to secure the victory, Notre Dame's offense also suc­cessfully rebounded from a lackluster showing last week at Navy. The Irish scored on four

"Rice is a tough team coming off the ball, but we had some­thing to prove," said jWtior of­fensive guard Tim Grunhard. ~'Our number-one goal was to get back to basics and get that attitude we had at the begin­ning of the season." 
Notre Dame had 14 different players carry the ball Saturday for a total of 294 yards on 52 carries. Mark Green led the way with five rushes for 66 yards, including a 40-yard scamper in the first quarter that led to Notre Dame's second touchdown. 
The Irish added two more touchdowns in the second half, the first coming on a three-yard run by Anthony Johnson and the second on a one-yard jaunt by Tony Brooks. Kicker Billy Hackett, who replaced Reggie Ho this weekend, had the first extra point blocked. A two­point conversion by Johnson followed the Brooks score. 
The two teams exchanged meet was a measurement of our depth." 

For St. Mary's, the perfor­mance represented a marked improvement over last year. The squad consistently finished fourth or fifth in the swimming events. 
Katie Cavanaugh and Carrie Cummings leaped to third place from the 1-meter diving 
field goals in the final two minutes of the half (Parsons hitting from 41, and Hackett from 42), and the Irish held a 31-6 halftime lead. 
"I thought that offensively we played awfully well up front," said Holtz. "I was a little disappointed with our ability to execute in the passing game." 
Irish quarterback Tony Rice completed three of eight passes for 80 yards, and backup Kent Graham was 6-of-10 for 65 yards. 
The Owls were able to move the ball when quarterback Quentis Roper (21-of-35 for 197 yards) had time to throw the ball. But that wasn't often. Frank Starns, George Wil­liams, Chris Zorich and Wes Pritchett each had turns sack­ing Roper, while Michael Stonebreaker led the Irish with 13 total tackles .. 
Notre Dame also broke up four passes and forced four turnovers. Jeff Aim and D' Juan Francisco had interceptions, and Pritchett and Steve Roddy recovered Owl fumbles. 
"With their offensive line, a lot of the other schools had used kind of a head fake--faking one way and going the other way," said Zorich. "We saw that on­the films and decided to do that too." 
The Notre Dame offense wasn't quite done at halftime. A 19-yard run by Rodney Cul­ver with 9: 15 to play in the third made it 38-6. · Mter a Parsons 45-yarder in the first play of the final quar­ter, Ismail took off with his second touchdown. Hackett kicked a 28-yarder to raise the lead to 48-9, and Joe Jarosz seemingly ended the highlights with a six-yard touchdown run with 46 seconds left in the game. 
But Rice's Nigel Codrington blocked Hackett's ensuing ex­tra point attempt, and Billy Stone galloped 85 yards to the Irish endzone. The run gave Rice two points and closed the scoring at 54-11. It was the first time the new NCAA conversion rule had come into effect in Division I-A play.

The Observer I ScoH McCann The Notre Dame hockey team took advantage of many scoring and a road tie with Michigan-Dearborn over the weekend. Steve opportunities such as the one shown above to earn a home win Megargee details the action below. 
Improved ND hockey wins, ties with Dearborn 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 
Irish hockey coach Ric Schafer might not have been happy about his team's early­season play, but he was all smiles with Notre Dame's weekend performance. 
The Irish downed Michigan­Dearborn 4-1 Friday night at the Joyce ACC, then tied the Wolves 3-3 Saturday at Dear­born. 
"It was a very good weekend for us," said Schafer. "There were some very encouraging signs." 
Notre Dame, 3-4-1, rallied from a sluggish first period before 1790 fans Friday to cruise past the Wolves in what was expected to be a close con­test between two evenly matched teams. 
Irish wing Michael Curry's power play goal opened the scoring with 20 seconds left in the first period. Curry took a behind-the-net pass from Bob Bilton and beat Dearborn goalie Dave Church from around the left side of the 

crease. Bobby Herber also was 
credited with an assist. 

Tim Kuehl extended the lead to 2-0 at 3:59 of the second per­iod when he nailed a slap shot from behind the right circle after receiving a pass from linemate David Bankoske. Kuehl's goal, giving him the team lead with four on the season, also came on the power play. 
Dearborn answered that just 17 seconds later on a goal by Joe Burton. But that was to be the Wolves' only goal of the evening. "I didn't know if we'd see any games like that, only giving up 
one goal," said Schafer. "We didn't give them any real . scoring opportunities, and that was the difference. We blocked 
a lot of shots ; thank goodness that's in our bag of tricks." . 
Senior co-captain Brian Mqntgomery gave the Irish in­surance at 13: 21 of the second period with his first goal of the season. The goal, from the left side of the crease, came on as­sists from Curry and Rob Bankoske. 

Herber ended the scoring in spectacular fashion with a breakaway goal at 8:49 of the final period. The senior from Edina, Minn., received an as­sist from Bruce Guay. 
Irish goalie Lance Madson recorded 21 saves. Church had 22 saves for Dearborn. 
"I'm embarrassed, I think the whole team's embar­rassed," said Dearborn coach Tom Anastos. "Not taking anything away from Notre Dame, we embarrassed our­selves tonight. The two teams played giveaway early in the game, but Notre Dame played strong second and third peri­ods, and we never woke up." 
Anastos probably was con­siderably prouder with his team's performance at home 
but his Wolves could not prevent a late Irish rally. 
Dearborn led 3-1 when Notre Dame scored with just four minutes remaining in regula­tion. Schafer pulled Madson in the closing moments to get an extra attacker on the ice, and the Irish responded with a tying goal to send the game into over­time. 
Neither team managed to score in the 10-minute session of sudden death overtime, and the game ended in a 3-3 tie. Schafer was extremely pleased with his team's effort. 
"It was a classic collegiate hockey game between two evenly matched teams," said Schafer. "The first period was the best 20 minutes of hockey we've played this year. The second period, we had to kill off a few penalties. Dearborn played exceptionally well in the second and third "

Irish turn on heat to steam Rice 
Ismail blasts two returns for TDs 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 
Notre Dame's freshman split end Raghib Ismail is referred to as "the Rocket," partly be­cause of his 4.28 speed in the 40-yard dash and partly be­cause his actual first name is difficult to pronounce. 
In Saturday's 54-11 cooking of Rice, Ismail showed off his speed with two touchdown kick­off returns and showed the Owls that no matter how hard it is to say his name (it's pronounced Ra-GIB), it's even tougher to catch him from be­hind. 
"I thought Raghib Ismail's kickoff returns were crisp," said Irish coach Lou Holtz, who saw his team successfully defend its number-one ranking and up its record to 9-0. "He has outstanding speed and tal­ent."

As Notre Dame continues down its road to a possible bat­tle for the National Champion­ship in January, the Gator Bowl wants the top-ranked Irish to know that such a game would not have to be played in Arizona. The Jacksonville, Fla., bowl might be willing to raise its payout from $1 million per team to more than $2.5 mil­lion if it could stage a game for the National Championship.

Ismail wouldn't take any of the credit for his pair of touch­downs Saturday. 
"I have to give credit where creditis due, and none of it goes to me," said Ismail, whose bro­ther Qadry is a freshman wide receiver for Syracuse. "The whole key to the returns was getting through the first line of blocking, and nobody got a clean shot at me. That is good blocking. I returned kickoffs in high school, but I get all my confidence from the blocking the kick return team gives me." 
The first return, which went 83 yards and was keyed by a Steve Belles block, followed a Rice 70-yard opening drive that ended with a Clint Parsons 23­yard field goal. The 3-0 Rice lead lasted all of 13 seconds.

of this caliber and a game of this caliber, we would have to raise our figure substantially," said Tom McCandless, past president and chairman of the Gator Bowl selection commit­tee, during Notre Dame's 54-11 thrashing of Rice on Saturday. 
Both the Gator Bowl and Fiesta Bowl representatives said they are interested in lining up a game between the No. 1-ranked Irish and No. 4 West Virginia, both 9-0 with two games remaining in the regu­lar season. Official bids are ex­tended Sunday, Nov.19, the day Notre Dame faces Penn State

But the Gator Bowl cannot of­fer network television expo­sure, and that could prove to be the drawback that sends Notre Dame west. ESPN has broadcasting rights to the season's only Jan. 1 bowl game, which is scheduled to begin at Sp.m. 
The other major bowls, in­cluding the NBC-televised Fiesta Bowl, will be played Jan. 2. 
"Cable television has come on strong the last few years, and we see the date as an as­set," McCandless defended.

"We are the only game on at that time, so you're not com­peting with anyone else. Anyone who wants to see the game is going to find a way to watch it." 
ESPN would provide some of the extra payoff money for the Gator Bowl. The city of Jack­sonville and Mazda, which sponsors the Gator Bowl, also would contribute. 
But Fiesta Bowl representa­tive Bill Shover still likes his bowl's chances of hosting Notre Dame on Jan. 2. When asked whether ESPN coverage is a

Irish continue to win, beat Michigan in three 
By MOLLY MAHONEY

The Michigan Wolverines came into the JACC Saturday night trying to get out of the rain and the cold. But the Notre Dame women's volleyball team greeted them with a storm inside as well--a man­made one--shaking down the thunder before Michigan could get its game going. 
It took the Irish just 53 
minutes to methodically man­handle Michigan, beating the Wolverines in three games, 15­5, 15-6 and 15-5. 
The Irish started sluggishly in the first game, but they were able to steadily score behind the armswing of senior middle blocker Mary Kay Waller once they got their offense into gear. 
Michigan grabbed a small lead early in the game, leading 4-1, before Notre Dame took control of the net offensively and consistently picked up the Wolverine attack defensively to prevent them from mounting a comeback. 
The second game featured much of the same for the Irish, as the frontline pounded away at the Wolverine defense. Seniors Zanette Bennett and Maureen continued their strong play from the first game, as did sophomore Tracey Shelton. 
The game stayed tight until the Irish broke a 6-6 tie with a varied attack of soft, offspeed shots into the seams of Mic­higan's defense and powerful kills that found the floor or skipped off the bodies of their opponents . 
Notre Dame controlled the third game as well, as they took an 8-0 lead and never looked back. 
Sophomores Amy White and Rachel Hall and freshman Katie Kavanaugh came into the game to continue the Irish dominance that forced the Wol­verines to record a negative hitting percentage for the second straight game. 
Waller led the Irish offensive assault with nine kills for an impressive .642 hitting percentage and added a team­high six digs . 
Bennett contributed seven kills and a team-high six total
