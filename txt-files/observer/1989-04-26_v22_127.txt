Development of SDI to slack off 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Bush administration will slow or cancel several futuristic weap­ons programs, including Star Wars and the stealth bomber, to build more of the arms already in the nation's arsenal, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Tuesday. 
To further cope with fiscal 1990 budget reductions man­dated by a new White House­congressional compromise, the Army, Navy and Air Force will reduce their active-duty strength of more than 2.1 mil­lion by 16,800 men and women, Cheney added. 
Appearing before the House. Armed Services Committee, Cheney ticked off a list of cut­backs. Many of the bigger deci­sions already had been dis­

. closed, including the fact that $10 billion had been shaved from the proposed defense budget in the compromise with Congress. 
The Pentagon's new budget authority, if Congress goes along with Cheney's bottom line, is $295.6 billion. Left intact is a proposed 3.6 percent pay hike for men and women in the military. 
Adm. William Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said he supported Cheney's cuts only because of "dismal realities-both political and eco­nomic." 
But Crowe said the moves were not justified by any changes in the threat posed by the Soviet Union or in Ameri­can commitments.

WORLD BRIEFS 

The Afghan government said Tuesday that its forces killed 58 Moslem guerrillas mounting another attack on the eas­tern city of Jalalabad. Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammed Nabi also said 250 guerrillas were killed in other fighting. His claims· could not be independently verified. The Soviet ambas­sador to Mghanistan, meanwhile, reported thousands of casualties by both sides in the seven-week siege on Jalalabad. Yuli Vorontsov also said the offensive appears to have been or­chestrated entirely by the Pakistani military, not by the govern­ment of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. · 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 

Shock TV host Morton Downey Jr. said Tuesday he was attacked by "skinheads" who cut his hair and marked him with swatiskas, but police said they couldn't verify his report. "What he's claiming doesn't appear to be the case at all," said. Ron Wilson, a spokesman at San Francisco International Airport where the incident was reported at 11:30 p.m. Monday. Aut­horities found no evidence of skinheads in the area, he said. Wilson said a witness reported seeing the talk show host in a restroom where the attack was said to have happened, but didn't see any confrontation. The witness said Downey was escorted to a waiting limousine by a man and woman with whom he was traveling. Downey was cleanly dressed when found in the limousine at the airport and showed no signs of being in a scuffle, said Wilson. Scissors and a marking pen were found in the restroom, but there were no physical signs of a fight, he said. In an interview with the San Francisco Examiner, Downey dis­played swastikas scrawled across his face, shirt and pants. His right eye was bloodshot and bruised, his head partially cut. 
A man who has served 21 years in a Florida prison for the poisoning deaths of his seven children was freed Tuesday as a judge overturned his conviction. The decision· came after an extraordinary appeal in which both defense attorney Ellis Rubin and special prosecutor Janet Reno agreed that James Richardson, a black man who was convicted by an all-white jury, had been railroaded. "Within !llY heart, I knew that these great men were going to get me out they weren't going to let me stay in there," the 53-year-old former migrant farm worker said. Richardson was convicted in 1968 of murdering his oldest child, an 8-year-old daughter, and sentenced to death. His sentence was later com­muted to life imprisonment. 
INDIANA BRIEFS 

A suspected natural gas explosion early Tuesday left an elderly woman critically injured, demolished the house she was in and damaged 11 others, authorities said. The 3:26a.m. blast was felt as far as five miles away from the Vincennes home. The blast carried debris half a block away from the demolished house and shattered windows and cracked walls in other nearby homes. Norma McMahan, 64, of Fort Wayne, was found in what was left of the garage, although it was not clear where she was at the time of the explosion, authorities said. Firefighters had to pry a three-truss section of the roof off of her. McMahan was in critical but stable condition Tuesday evening in the burn unit of Wishard Hospital in Indianapolis. 
Four people were injured Monday when a van went out of control on wet pavement south of Ellettsville and collided with a school bus. The accident occurred when the driver lost control. of the van on a hilly curve, crossed the center line and collided with the northbound bus. Four people were injured, including the driver of the van and three students, but none was was ad­mitted to the hospital. The remaining 17 students and their bus driver were not injured, police said. The bus sustained only minor damage to a bumper.

ND is founded on a sense of community
We are ND. 
Good enough, except--who's the "We?" 
An incident which happened Monday on the Stepan basketball courts could cause you to wonder just who the "we" is meant to include. 
The details of the incident vary according to whom you're talking, but the gist is this: a melee erupted during a Bookstore basketball game between a team of Stanford freshmen and a team partially comprised of football players. 
The scuffle was unfortunate, regardless of its cause. More important than the incident itself, however, is the divisive sentiment it exposed. 
During a confrontation between a football player and a resident of Stanford not a part of the game, the football player allegedly yelled something to the effect that students would cheer football players during the fall but would side against them after the season was over. He continued by asking the Stanford resident what, if anything, the resident himself had ac­complished for Notre Dame. 
The less-than-subtle implication was that stu­dents were unappreciative of the football team's accomplishments if they did not approve of everything football players did. Fans were happy to cheer the team when it was winning the national championship for them but were quick to forget when the tables were turned. While no doubt these words were said during the heat of the moment, they nevertheless carried an unmistakable stigma: athletes are separate from other students. 
· Who then is the "we" in the "We are ND?" Athletes? Non-athletes? A mixture of both? 
Of course, the answer is that we are all ND. Athletes are ND. Non-athletes are ND. The fac­ulty is ND. The administration is ND. It does no more good to say one of these groups is not ND than to say stars but not stripes are part of the United States flag. 
Much of what makes Notre Dame such a unique place is its community. People come to South Bend from all over the country and the world because of the atmosphere and the envi­ronment here. There aren't many major uni­versities in the country which have such a close­ness among students. You can't find many places where many students gather together

'Our campus is not comprised of two camps, athletes and students.' 
Dave Bruner Viewpoint Editor 

for late-night masses in individual residence halls. There aren't many that possess such a top-notch Campus Ministry program. And, there aren't many nationally prominent univer­sities that can boast of a president who lives in a dorm and likes to play basketball with stu­dents. 
Notre Dame is also unique among peer insti­tutions in that its athletes are considered a part of the general student body. An athlete could live across the hall, sit next to you in the dining hall or in the same classroom. The dorm I live in has several prominent football players who are friendly, well-liked and respected individ­uals. They are a part of the whole community. 
These things are what makes Monday's inci­dent so ugly. It damages the very spirit on which Notre Dame was founded--community. Incidents such as the one on the Stepan courts are not common, but need not happen. There's no need for students and athletes to quarrel over petty things like cheering or who does more for the community. 
When students yell, "We are ND'' at a football or basketball game they don't stop to think about what the word "community" means. It's understood that it includes everybody, students and athletes alike. They are proud that they are a part of Notre Dame. They are proud of the athletes who represent Notre Dame. 
Our campus is not comprised of two camps, athletes and students. It is a community of all. Dave Bruner is a junior govern­mentlphilosophy!P.P.E. major. He serves as Viewpoint Editor for The Observer.

HPC announces '89 budget 
By PETE LOFTUS Staff Reporter 
At Tuesday's meeting of the Hall President's Council, the budget for the 1989-90 school year was announced and two amendments to the student government consitution were unanimously passed. 
The HPC budget has been in­creased from $28,000 to $40,000 for next year. With the new budget, $24,000 will go to dorm improvements , and $8,000 will 
· go to special projects such as the Keenan Revue and Fisher Regatta. 
$4,500 goes to Weekend Wheels and the rest to miscel­laneous expenses of the coun­cil. 
A cutback eliminates an al­lotment of $500 per dorm for non-alcoholic events to encour­age more special projects that will benefit the whole campus. 
The first amendment passed moved the date on which the Student Union Board's execu­tive board and commissioners will take office from May 1 back to Aprill. The change was made in order to coincide with the start-up dates of various other student govern-ment positions. 
The second amendment replaced the Freshman Advi­sory Council with the Fresh­man Class Council, which will operate in conjunction with Student Government, the Of­fice of Student Activities, and the Freshman Year of Studies. 
The council will consist of a freshman from each dorm cho­sen by the hall's rector, presi­
dent,  and  previous  year's  
Freshman  Class  Council  
Representative.  

The purpose of the FCC will be to promote the welfare of freshman as they relate to the administration, faculty and community and to achieve the wants and needs of freshman. 
A second freshman organiza­tion called the Freshman Aca­demic Advisory Council will operate seperately from student government and be part of the Freshman Year of Studies. . 
Richard Daly of the Alumni Association announced that the Student-Alumni Relations Group (SARG), which promotes cooperation and ex­change between alumni and students, will meet Wednesday with the HPC. SARG is spon­soring a "Zero Year Reunion" at the Alumni Club where alumni will meet with graduate students and seniors. 
In other business, a petition was circulated in support of the pompon squad, which is being evaluated by an administrative committee to determine whe­ther it will be recognized as a club in the future.

"It's a real honor to get this 
award named after this excel­
lent man. He had a special af­
fection for the Right to Life Or­
ganization,'' said Harrington. 
Harrington has served as president for the past two years. 
She became involved in order to "gain an informed and ed­ucated opinion about a very serious issue. I wanted to be able to respond properly when my views were challenged-not just with stories and generalizations." 
"I am very proud to be pres­ident of the largest non­academic club at Notre Dame. We have about three hundred active members. Sure the club takes a lot of time, but it's all worth it," Harrington said. 
Next year, Harrington will either continue her education towards a masters degree in re­ligious education or she will work with the National Youth Pro-Life Coalition. 
She hopes that the Right to Life organization will remain effective in offering everybody the possibility of "an educated opinion" and encouraging people to take an active role in pro-life causes.

Supreme Court to hear new abortion dispute 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Su­preme Court will hear argu­ments Wednesday in a Mis­souri abortion dispute that has become its most closely watched case of the 1980s. Court officials are bracing for "an extraordinary day" at the usually placid building on Capitol Hill. 
State officials and the Bush administration are urging the court to use the case to over­turn or substantially limit its 1973 decision that women have a constitutional right to abor­tion. 
· Even if the court rules on the Missouri abortion regulations narrowly, the decision will be viewed as a barometer of the current justices' commitment to the 16-year-old ruling in Roe vs. Wade. 
The justices are considered

I've always heard about, but I never considered myself worthy," said Mahoney. "Red Smith was such a respected journalist. .. I'm delighted to win this award." 
Petrites is a writer for many campus publications including The Observer, Scholastic, Humanitas and Common Sense. She is from Houston. Presently she is an Editorial Intern at Notre Dame Maga­zine. 
Petrites said that she enjoys writing features the most. Her freshman year at Notre Dame she was an Accent copy editor and now she writes mostly fea­tures for The Observer. 
"In the future I hope to maybe work for a magazine," said Petrites. "My big goal is to be an overseas bureau chief." 
Petrites said that winning the Red Smith Scholarship Award never crossed her mind. "It's a great honor," said Petrites.

They will take their initial vote in the Missouri case Friday, discussing their views and beginning the process of drafting and redrafting opinions to accompany the an­nouncement of the court's deci­sion, expected by July. 
The Roe vs. Wade decision is based on the constitutional right to privacy. The court said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor. 
The court said states may in­terfere in the abortion decision during the second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take steps to protect fetal life only in the third trimester when the fetus can survive outside the womb.

"We were really happy with the response (from the Board of Trustee members)," said Gutrich. He said that he believed that the report changed some minds. Most of the discussion centered around friendship between the two sexes, not parietals and sex, said Gutrich. 
Two members of the student committee were transfers from Catholic schools with co­ed dorms, said Gutrich. Many Board members asked ques­tions of these students concern­ing residence life at their pre­vious institution and Notre Dame, said Gutrich. 
"When we left I had the 
feeling that a couple years

said Gutrich. "I think that the

abortions after the frrst trimester was not made abso­lute, however. 
A federal appeals court, relying on Roe vs. Wade, struck down as unconstitutional five key provisions of the Missouri law now under scrutiny: 
A 
ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities for performing abortions not nec­essary to save a woman's life. 

A 
ban prohibiting any public employee from perform­ing or assisting an abortion. 

A 
ban on using taxpayer money for "encouraging or counseling" women to have abortions. 

A 
requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus rea­sonably believed to be older than 19 weeks is viable, capable of surviving outside the womb, by determining lung maturity and other testing. 


A declaration that the "life 
believes that this would help students to socialize. 
TheRA's job would be more difficult, said Christensen. She said that what the administra­tion chose to do with the housing rules would be impor­tant. 
She said that girls in her dorm complain about not having male friends and she believes that living in co-ed dorms would alleviate that problem because people would see each other in the halls every day. Christensen said that living in co-ed dorms is a more realistic living situation. 
"Co-educational housing is just educational," said fresh­man Mike Musty. "I think having co-ed dorms helps members of the opposite sex develop true friendships deeper than the shallow sex­object views often seen on campus. 
"Most good friendships develop in the dorms," added Musty. 
Mary Donohue, a freshman, said that the Iceberg Debates changed her mind; she is now in favor of co-ed housing. 
"I think it eventually should happen." She believes that co­residential housing would en­hance the social life, but "I'm fine with the status quo," said Donohue. 
of each human begins at con­ception." 
In an attempt to sway the jus­tices, Americans in record numbers have been writing and telephoning the court to ex­press their views. Tens of thousands of letters arrive each day, and the court's two switchboards were so flooded with calls that a rarely used third board had to be activated. 
"Many people have indicated they've been asked to call by televangelists," court spokes­woman Toni House said. "These people believe we are conducting a public opinion survey. We are not." 
But court officials, reacting to the outpouring of public sentiment, will take unusual se­curity measures Wednesday. 
"I expect it will be an ex­traordinary day at the Su­preme Court," House said.

Freshman Roy Ketchum thinks it's time co-ed housing was implemented. "Having co­ed dorms can improve social and intellectual relationships between men and women at Notre Dame. It would give members of the opposite sex a chance to understand each other as people without the so­cial stress of the dating or party atmosphere." 
Ketchum has no problem with a lack of privacy due to co-ed housing, "If you need privacy, close your door and wear a robe when you go to the shower," said Ketchum. 
Junior Katie LeJeune was on Stanford's Iceberg Debate team. The team argued for co­ed housing, yet LeJeune is against the option. She said that because a dorm room is not self-sufficient, there in­evitably would be an interac­demonstrators off court prop­erty, but House said 50 mem­bers of a group calling itself Oppression Under Target have informed the court of their plan to engage in civil disobedience that could lead to their arrest. 
"Pro-choice" and "pro-life" activists plan to conduct com­peting news conferences out­side the court building. 
Inside the courtroom, House said, "We have no reason to believe the conduct of this oral argument will be any different, any less respectful than any other." 
Court police said they would allow people to begin lining up at midnight for the chance of seeing the hour-long argument session that begins at 10 a.m. EST. Police said they expect hundreds to be in line when the building opens at 9 a.m. 
tive living arrangement. 

"It is unnecessary to live with men that close, it is better left to marriage and living ar­rangements outside of col­lege," said LeJeune. 
If the University does choose to offer co-ed housing, LeJeune thinks the option should only be for juniors and seniors on a volunteer basis. She said that freshmen are not ready to han­dle this type of situation. 
"I wouldn't choose to live in a co-ed dorm; there is more unity among students in a single sex dorm," said LeJeune. 
Sophomore Pat Lanigan likes the dorms the way they are. "Having girls in the dorms goes against the whole idea of dorm life. Living with guys is the way to go because you can really get to know them," said Lanigan.

Faculty Senate should ponder changes 
---~ --~ -~ 


Editor's Note: The following are excerpts from remarks given by Robert L. Kerby to the Faculty Senate onApril13, 1989. 
A decade ago, the Senate and other representative faculty bodies--in particular, the AAUP chapter at Notre Dame-­influenced the evolution of Uni­versity policy in some modest but respectable fashion. Three year's ago, I returned (to the Senate), hoping that the Sen­ate's influence might have grown during the interim, or, at least, might not have diminished. I hoped, too, that the University's new adminis­tration might prove more amenable to a reasonable cul­tivation of academic democracy than the preceed­ing regime had. 
(But) if anything, the Senate's--and the faculty's-­corporate role in University governance has suffered measureable diminution through the last decade. 
To recite at length another detailed bill of particulars now seems both futile and redun­dant. Proposals sent to the Aca­demic Council have been ig­nored. A survey of faculty opinion concerning major changes in benefits has recently been dismissed as un­representative, even though the administrators who did the dismissing appear not to have surveyed faculty opinion in any more representative fashion themselves. Officers and admi­nistrators who appear before the Senate continue to speak of the administration as the "University," as if those fac­ulty not fortunate or ambitious enough to be ordained adminis­trators are peripheral ap­pendages to the "University." When officers do appear they only answer questions, but avoid or deflect forms of reciprocal dialogue which might imply a mutuality of in­terest, competence, commit­ment, or concern. 
The administration protests that its own informal but ener­getic deliberative processes are sufficiently representative to meet all objections. Such protestations remain less than convincing. 
No one denies that some ad­ministrators who serve on various University councils and committies are also mem­bers of the faculty. But admin­istrative appointments here are not accomplished by elec­tion: an administrator's fac­ulty status does not make an administrator a faculty repre­sentative. To suggest other­wise is facetious. 
No one denies--to para­phrase a portion of the Univer­sity President's remarks during his first appearance before the Faculty Senate-­that somebody has to make decisions. Indeed, American universities traditionally lodge much greater authority in ex­ecutive officers than do the older and more mellow univer­sities of Western Europe. What is at question now is whether decisions here are being made by administrators employing the best, brightest, and broadest advice available. During one spring sitting of the Senate, two administrators ap­peared to explain, among other things, the procedures used to gather faculty opinion about Notre Dame's pending new plan for faculty benefits. The procedures described reminded me of the old "County Court" system used to govern colonial Virginia: some commoners were allowed to partake in the superficial public rituals of democracy, but 12 or 15 providentially for­tunate First Family gentry, chosen only by their equally fortunate peers, always made all the decisions worth making. 
My own notion of democratic 

representation is a little more modern. It dates from March 4, 1861, when Abe Lincoln ex­plained the idea. The other president at that time, Jeffy Davis, did things the 18th Cen­tury way: he stuffed his cabinet full of "yes men" who agreed with him all the way to catastrophe. Abe chose the mighty men of his political age to advise him, including some who hated his eyeballs: but he chose them to be advisors, not pals. Year after year, I am hardly ever surprised that, no matter what I do in class, Abe always wins the Civil War. 
Last academic year, in a fit of whimsy, I volunteered four of five times to serve on various University committees and commissions and boards desig­nated to deal with sundry mat­ters about which I know something. (I chose to do so upon the friendly advice of an administrator, who assured me that Notre Dame's administra­tion preferred cozy, congenial, discreet, and suave "input" tendered in a family way.) So, I volunteered a lot. I figured an evident shortage of volunteers and my own certified willing­ness to suffer might, in part, counterbalance the fact that I can sometimes act like a flake. Each application was rejected. Most of the rejections were polite. This little game left me -wondering just how a faculty member's opinion gets to be ad­judged in an official component of truly representative faculty opinion around here. 
The Faculty Senate has three choices before it. 
First, it can continue to do what it has been doing. It can continue to play the game ac­cording to the rules laid down years ago by a certain former provost (whose name is now never uttered during a Senate session). It can survey up a storm. It can study things to 

death. It can juggle peer uni­versities' peeriness until entropy snuffs out the cosmos. It can meet, and measure, and county, and deliberate, and, now and again, birth an oc­casional molehill of a resoluton from this mountain of labor. Administrators will continue to dismiss the representative character of anything (Notre Dame's) Senate does, and con­tinue to file the Senate's studies and resolutions in various ad­ministrative black holes, and continue to amend unilaterally the former provost's ground rules howsoever it con­veniences them, (and) con­tinue to delude themselves about the infallibility of their ~own infused omniscience. The Senate, in its turn, may con­tinue to go to its betters to beg a crumb from the table of governance; and it may even come away, occasionally, with 
a pat on the head. 

I should be saddened to see this, any longer. For the cur­rent arrangement forestalls any pos.sibility that Notre Dame will ever evolve into a genuine university, a self­governed and self-defined com­munity of scholars committed not only to the Platonic ideal of academic liberalism, but to its Aristotelian and Thomistic reality. 
Second, the Senate can chuck it and quit. (The Senate) can adjourn sine die right now, and go down the road to Appomat­tox with the stragglers from the Congress of the Confederate States. The trouble is, this so­lution would make absolutely no difference--nobody really noticed the disappearance of the Confederacy's Congress, after four years during which its existence was also univer­sally ignored. The Senate's self-immolation would rate a small story onpage five of The Observer, and a one-sentence notation in next August's alumni m;:1gazine. Indeed, the administration's collective sigh of relief might elevate the Golden Dome even higher than it is, as the Senate abandoned one of the very few instruments the faculty has to advance the University's interests: the Sen­ate's collective power to annoy. 
Or, third, the Senate can just take a leaf from the Continental Congress, and just start governing. Just do it! The Con­tinental Congress's first task was to institutionalize itself as a governing body, no matter what Fred North and Fat George the Farmer thought about its upstart pretentious. If the Crown will not concede the efficacy and wisdom-and, for that matter, the utility--of genuine representative partic­ipation in affairs, then let the Colonials take matters into their own hands. 
(The Senate) can revive the movement toward faculty uni­onization inaugurated more than a decade ago. If the ad­ministration must insist upon acting as if it alone is the "University," and that faculty are mere employees, the fac­ulty may have to take the ad­ministration at its word, (and) force an equitable resolution of the dilemma. 
I am under no illusion that unionization may be achieved overnight. It took the Continen­tal Congress the better part of two years to fire (its) last King. The task demands education, study, examination, deliberat­ion, and organization. (But) the Senate exists to do just such things. Pursuing (its) man­dates would give the Senate some reason to continue exist­ing, and something significant to do with its existence. 

LETTERS 

Dear Editor: 
As graduate students here at Notre Dame we and our friends can only play sports on weekends or in the evenings in the JACC due to the nature of our research work. But more often than not, we are unable ''to do anything. It is not because of the lack of facilities--they are excellent. But the JACC is often 
closed for other purposes. 
Discounting the graduation ceremony, JPW, Ice Capades, varsity basketball games, etc., which go on for days, there are still countless numbers of ban­quets, shows, sales, and so on.

JACC should be open to serve students, not special events 
We cannot help asking the questions: What have the events to do with our sports ac­tivites? Why should the gyms, racquetball courts, and volley­ball courts be closed while the events actually only take a small part of the whole build­ing? 
We really think these kind of events should not interfere with the normal activities in the JACC. Now that summer vaca­tion is just around the corner, we start to feel horrified, not because of the ninety degree weather, but because, as is well known, the JACC will change 

its opening hours to normal campus working hours, i.e., when we are working. The rea­son: it is assumed students have gone home. The fact: most graduate students and faculty members will be on campus throughout the vaca­tion. People have been com­plaining about the lack of facilities for graduate stu­dents, but the real problem is that we are deprived of the very limited resources we do have. 
It is our sincere hope that the University will consider graduate students as students and take some action to make the limited existing facilities accessible to us when we have time to use them.

Holtz 
continued from page 16 
Every starter on the line with the exception of Heck, a first­round selection of the Seattle Seahawks, will return in the fall. 
"I think our line's going to be a good one," said Holtz. "We have more movement off the line and are physical. The of­fensive line's made good prog­ress." 
Holtz also has liked the way many of the Irish underclas­smen have emerged as leaders, citing defensive back Todd Lyght as an example, and is encouraged by the intensity he saw in spring practices. 
"I don't think there's a single football player looking back at last year," said Holtz. "The first spring practice, we came out in shorts and ended up in a full-scale scrimmage." 
Linebacker Ned Bolcar, a fifth-year senior this fall, em­phasized the fact that one na­tional title has not changed the players' ambitions. 
"This team's not com­

placent, there's not a doubt in 
my mind," said the Irish tri­
captain. "All you had to do is 
see the first practice without 
pads. This is the start of next 
year, and our object is to be a 
better team . 
"Every year, even three years ago when we lost six games, our goal was to win the national championship." 
The Irish will have one more game than usual on its regular season schedule, and will have to play Michigan, Penn State and Miami all on the road. But it's been a long time since Notre Dame's pre-season prospects of a national title looked this good.

AP: Seton Hall's Carlesimo to be next Kentucky coach 
Associated Press 

LEXINGTON--P.J. Car­lesimo, head coach at NCAA runner-up Seton Hall, will be the new head basketball coach at Kentucky, The Associated Press has learned. 
Two sources told The AP late Tuesday night that Carlesimo would accept the position. 
The sources told The AP that Carlesimo wanted to talk with Seton Hall officials, specifi­cally those who supported him during attempts to oust him two seasons ago, before making the official announce­ment. 
Carlesimo, in Lexington after his interview Tuesday with the school's screening committee and UK athletic director C.M. Newton, could not be reached for comment Tuesday night. A person who answered the phone at his Lex­ington hotel room said he was resting. 
"Kentucky has a new coac­h," one source said. 
The sources said they ex­pected the announcement to be made Wednesday. 


Dolphins choose IU's Stoyanovich 
Associated Press 

Pete Stoyanovich, who gave up soccer to concentrate on football and never missed an extra-point kick in his college career, had to wait eight rounds and more than 200 se­lections before he was taken in the 1989 NFL draft. 
The Indiana University placekicker eventually went to Miami, which promises a much different climate from the cold, northern weather he's accus­tomed to, but he's not com­plaining. 
"I'm happy, I'm real hap­py," Stoyanovich said after being drafted by the Dolphins. "I couldn't have asked for a better team or a better place to go. 
"I'm from Michigan, and I've played in Bloomington," said Stoyanovich, whose eighth-round selection on Mon­day made him the 203rd player taken in this year's draft. "So I've kicked in cold weather all my life. I was hoping I'd get a chance to kick somewhere warm." 
He fashioned an accurate, ef­ficient career with Bill Mal­lory's Hoosiers, converting all 123 of his extra points and 47 of 73 field goals. The 6-0, 180­pounder from Dearborn Hills, Mich., hit 10 of 16 field goals as a freshman, 11 of 18 as a soph­omore, 9 of 15 as a junior and 17 of 24 a year ago when In­diana went 8-3-1 and carved up South Carolina, 34-10, in the Li­berty Bowl. 
It was on those stats that 
Stoyanovich, who did double 
duty with the IU soccer team 
his first three years, built his 
professional hopes. 

"I couldn't believe I didn't go 
(during Sunday's first five 
rounds)," Stoyanovich said, 
"but I guess my patience paid 
off. Believe me, I'd much 
rather go to Miami than Green 
Bay. And that's not meant as 
a knock on the Packer organi­
zation."

Canadien's 3-2 win over Bruins clinches division 
Associated Press 
MONTREAL--The Montreal Canadiens avenged last year's playoff elimination by Boston, riding the goaltending of Patrick Roy and a strong defense to the Adams Division title with a 3-2 victory over the Bruins Tuesday night. 
Montreal, which was 11-1-1 against Boston in the regular season and playoffs, advances to meet the Patrick Division survivor. Pittsburgh leads Philadelphia in that series 3-2. 
Each result in this five-game series was by one goal. Roy was the winning goalie in the four Montreal victories and now is 30-0-4 at the Forum since losing to Boston in the 1988 Adams playoff clincher. He made 22 saves Tuesday as the Canadiens re-established their domination of the Bruins in the playoffs--they have won 21 of the last 23 postseason matchups. 
Stephane Richer got the win­ning goal at 4: 14 of the third period when he took a rebound off the stick of goalie Andy Moog, spun around and put in a backhander. That made it 3-1 and was enough to withstand Bob Joyce's second goal of the game, at 7:31 on a 25-footer. 
Joyce had given Boston a 1-0 lead in the first period, com­pleting a 2-on-1 break with Craig Janney by scoring on a 20-foot shot. 
Chris Chelios tied it 4: 13 into the second period when he came out from behind the net with the puck and, through a screen, beat Moog between the pads from short range. 
Shayne Corson made it 2-1 at 
9:40 with a 55-footer from the left boards that ticked Moog's stick and pads before settling in the net. 
Boston lost defenseman Mi­chael Thelven with an apparent shoulder injury when checked into the boards in the first per­iod by Mike McPhee. 
Penguins 10, Flyers 7 
PITTSBURGH--Mario Lemieux tied NHL playoff records with four first-period goals, five overall and eight points Tuesday night as the Pit­tsburgh Penguins beat the Philadelphia Flyers 10-7 to take a 3-2 lead in the Patrick Divi­sion finals. 
Lemieux, listed as question­able before the game with a whiplash-like neck injury, scored a natural hat trick in the first 6:55 of play to give the pumped-up Penguins, who led 9-3 entering the final period, a 3-0 lead. 
In a playoff performance rivaling any by the once­incomparable Wayne Gretzky,

Lemieux made it 5-1 with his fourth goal at 17:09, tying the league record for playoff goals in a period set by the Flyers' Tim Kerr against theN ew York Rangers in 1985. 
The five goals match the ef­forts of Maurice Richard of Montreal in 1944 and Darryl Sit­tler of Toronto anri Rel!e:ie Leach of Philadelphia in 1976. 
The eight points match the year-old record set by New Jer­sey's Patrik : Sundstrom. Lemieux had eight points in a game twice during the regular season. 
The NHL scoring champion, returning to the "Mario the Magnificent" who scored 199 regular-season points, assisted on all three of the Penguins' second-period goals, two on picturebook feeds to right wing Rob Brown. 
His final goal came into an empty net with 37 seconds to play. 
The total goals were one short of the NHL playoff record set in 1982 when Edmonton beat Los Angeles 10-8. 
Lemieux was limited to three goals in the first four games of

the series and was shut out in Game 4 as the Flyers won 4-1, but the Flyers barely had a chance to lace up their skates before he began pounding the puck at goaltender Ron Hex­tall. 
Playing in its first second­round series in 10 years, Pit­tsburgh threatened the NHL playoff record of seven goals in a period before settling for a 6-1 lead. Mter Mike Bullard's goal, Lemieux scored his fourth and most spectacular goal and his lOth in nine playoff games. 
The big guns rolled into the Sweet Sixteen. Adworks easily disposed of 4 Men and a Red­Headed Stepchild 21-7, while Malicious Prostitution had a tougher time, downing The Cotton Club 21-14. 
Murphy's Bar finally got its entire team together and beat Nice But Nasty 21-14. Kevin Warren exploded for 10 points, and Andy Heck, the first round draft pick of the Seahawks back from his visit to Seattle, added seven hoops. 
"This is the first time we've had our guys together in awhile and we olaved well." Steve 
Belles said. "Kevin and Andy really came through today." 
Clockwork Orange, playing without Frank Starns, fell to Lenny's American Grill 21-19, while Killer Bees continued on its roll by upending All the President's Men III 21-11.

Jim Dolan and John McCabe led Coach's with six hoops each, while Mike Bobinski tossed in four baskets. 
"Our big strength is inside and we just couldn't get it going," Bobinski said. "They were doing a good job of taking the ball away from our big guys. Then we didn't put it on the floor and we started getting a lot of fouls. That's when we knew we had it." 
In an upset, Rubber Cement upended Touch-N-Go 21-16 be­hind the nine points of Dwayne Treolo and the five hoops of Phil Kraker. 
Touch-N--Go played without Tom DuPree, who was injured in Monday afternoon's victory. 
"That kind of helped lJS," Kraker said. "With him in the game, it would have been closer. This is probably the best we have played. I was happy with our defense and rebound­ing."

. "We're classic overac­hievers," said Madsen, "because none of us have ex­ceptional talent but we just go out and work hard every day." 
Madsen works hard, as he has four complete games to his credit. No other pitcher on the staff has more than one. 
He is also described by Murphy as having a screw loose, which Madsen ack­nowledges. 
"I like to have fun, but when it comes to pitching, it's all business," said Madsen. "We're a highly structured team, but then again we like to have fun. But when it gets down to it, and I'm pitching, it's all business." 
With Indiana, business it now at hand. "He's got guts. I'm going to miss him a lot because he's 
been the key to our whole pitch­ing staff, the whole philosophy over the last two years." 
That philosophy is to make the most of talent, to go right after the hitters, and, above all, to throw strikes. Murphy takes pride in calling his club a blue collar team that makes up in effort what it lacks in raw tal­ent. 
"Madsen knows he's got to concentrate a little harder than the next guy because he doesn't have the great stuff, but he's a pitcher," said Murphy. "You don't have to have great stuff to be a good pitcher."

ND baseball prepares for IU 
Madson's pitching vital in rematch against Hoosiers 
Holtz can't complainabout spring practices 
When a reporter asked the inevitable question about whe­ther Notre Dame could successfully defend its national title, Lou Holtz referred to a statement he made countless times last season. 


Steve Megargee 
Irish Items 

"You're not talking to John Wooden here," Holtz said in the press conference after Saturday's Blue-Gold Game. "You're not talking to a guy who's been here before." 
Actually, he did change it somewhat. He used to compare his achievents with Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer, but those names lost their glamor when Johnson left for the NFL and Switzer's team got in trouble with the law. 
Despite what he may claim, Holtz knows a few secrets about how a team can repeat. The players received their championship rings after the Blue-Gold Game, but accor­ding to Holtz, that's the last time the team will discuss 1988. 
"I personally believe you don't have complacency if you just wrap up the past year and pass out the scrapbooks," said Holtz, joking adding that "we didn't have a single football player doing a commercial." 
Holtz already may be working at one disadvantage. Holtz is not going to get away with any apprehensive thoughts about a team that has 16 starters returning from last year's nat;onal champions. 
l'i Jbody will fall for pre-game quotes like "Rice scares me o death," this time around. 
H~ ving so many returning starters does have its advan­tage~ . In fact, it looks as if the 1989 Notre Dame team may be an improvement over last season's national champions, particularly at the quarterback position. 
''Tony Rice is a good passer,'' said Holtz. ''When we came to voting for the most improved player, I would have voted for Tony Rice--that's nothing against Ryan Mihalko," 
Mihalko, a sophomore running back, won the Hering Award as the most improved offensive back of spring prac­tices. 
The Irish also should be stronger on the offensive line next season, even without 1988 All-American Andy Heck.

When Erik Madsen and the Irish baseball team take the field against Indiana at 3 p.m. today at Jake Kline Field, they will be looking to prove once and for all that they can com­pete against Big Ten teams. 
It is especially fitting that the Irish will be playing the Hoosiers, who beat the Irish 10­0 on March 25. In that game, Erik Madsen took his first loss of the season and the Irish were held to four hits, committing four errors. 
"The players are a little em­barrassed about what hap­pened last time," said Irish head coach Pat Murphy. "It's not a revenge factor, but it's just that they want to prove to themselves that they can beat Indiana." 
Indiana comes from a confer­ence that the Irish have always struggled against. A year ago today, Notre Dame beat Purdue 5-2 to break a 20-game losing streak against Big Ten teams. 
When Indiana beat Notre Dame earlier this year, it raised its record to an impres­sive 20-1. Lately, however, it has struggled, mainly against teams in its own conference. It now owns a 28-15 record and is 3-13 in the Big Ten. 
"Indiana didn't play a very competitive schedule at the beginning of the season," said Murphy. "But they're a good

Erik Madson 

Big Ten team, a pretty dis­ciplined team; I think we can play with them." 
One player who knows he can play with them is senior pitcher Erik Madsen, who was the losing pitcher in the loss to In­diana. 
"Last time I pitched against Indiana, I fell behind the hit­ters, and that hurt me bad," said Madsen. "This time I'm going to try to stay ahead of the hitters and get the second pitch over for a strike, and hopefully things will turn out better than last time." 
Indeed, the Great Falls, Mont., native allowed five hits, two walks and five runs in three innings against the Hoosiers. Notre Dame committed four errors in the game, and only two of Madsen's runs were earned. 
. Two months and 23 games later, Madsen is 6-3 with a 3.59 ERA. He is coming off an out­standing performance against Detroit on Saturday, when he pitched a five-hitter against the Titans. He allowed one run, the only run of the game, and the Irish lost 1-0. 
In fact, all three of Madsen's losses have come when the Irish were shut out. The Irish have been shut out a total of five times. 
Being one of three seniors on the pitching staff, Madsen nec­essarily inherits a leadership role. He and junior Brian Piotrowicz are the two most solid starters on the squad, and Madsen realizes that the more inexperienced pitchers learn from watching him. 
"As a leader I try to set an example when I go out and pitch," said Madsen. "I just try to show how to follow the plan that coach Murphy set up for us, just to get ahead of the hit­ters, don't give them too much credit, and go right after them." 
Murphy realizes the quality worker that he has in Erik Madsen. 
"He's a pitcher in the true sense of the word," said the second-year coach. "I'd like Erik Madsen on my team, I don't care where I was manag­ing. If I were managing in the major leagues I'd like an Erik Madsen on my team because he knows how to pitch, he's a tremendous competitor, a tre­mendous person, and a tremen­dous personality.
