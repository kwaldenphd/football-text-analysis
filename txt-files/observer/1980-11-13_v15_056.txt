Algerians deliver US reply on hostages to Iranians 
carried with him a pledge ofnon­interference and an explanation of U.S. legal difficulties in meeting other demands. 
In Algiers, official sources said the U.S. note was delivered to Tehran by Abdelkrim Gheraib and Redha Malek, Algeria's ambassadors to Tehran and Washington respectively. 
"Now it's up to the Iranians," said one of the officials, adding that he could not predict how long it would take for Iran to study the American response and react to it. 
In an unprecedented interview with an American radio station that apparently had the approval of some Iranian officials, L. Bruce Laingen, the senior U.S. envoy held hostage at the Foreign Ministry in Tehran said he was fine and "We'1e anxious to leave, hopeful." 
The hostages were gratified by the support being given by the American public, Laingen told radio station KAYO in Seattle, Wash. He added: "We have no doubt that that is continuing, and at this particularly crucial time in the discussions going on support is even more important than ever." 
Laingen said he could not comment on the note's delivery because he was "out of touch in terms of the substance of the problem." 

Pollution causes indoor probletns 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)­Algerian envoys acting as inter­mediaries for the United States delivered the U.S. reply yester­day tb Iran's terms for releasing the 52 American hostages. U.S. negotiators, who flew home after passing the note, said they were uncertain of their next step. 
In Tehran, an official in the office of Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Rajai said, "The government has received America's letter." In a telephone interview from Beirut, Ahmed Azizi said a Cabinet meeting had been scheduled to discuss the rt=ply but he did not know when it would begin. 
Tehran Radio broadcasts during the day rr.,~rie no mention of the U.S. reply being received. Thert= was a report the Iranian regime planned to publish the text of the note Thursday or Friday, but that was not officially confirmed. 
Ayatollah Mohamed Beheshti, head of the Islamic Republican Party and president of the Iranian Supreme Court, said Iran's parliamt=nt, the Majlis, would have to consider how Iran might proceed "if one or two of the conditions set by Iran for the liberation of the American detainet=s cannot he legally ful filled by the United States," the official Algerian news agency reported from Tehran. 
In a meeting eleven days ago, the Iranian Parliament approved four demands outlined six weeks earlier by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary leader. The demands are: return of the wealth of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi; can­
cellation  of  American  claims  
against Iran;  a  pledge of non­ 
intervention  in  Iranian  affairs  

and unfreezing of some $8 billion of Iranian assets in V.S. banks. 
Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who gave the Algerians the U.S. reply and a lengthy oral explanation ofit in a 30-hour visit to Algiers, told reporters on his return to Washington: "where we go from here will depend on the reaction of the Iranians." Christopher

Hotel refuses rooms to ND alumni 
by Sue Kelleher 
The gridiron battle between the Irish and the Crimson Tide will not be the only one occurring in Birmingham this week. The fight between the Notre Dame Club in Alabama and the Sheraton Mountainbrook Inn, Birmingham, has yet to be fought. Local alumni were denied rooms at the hotel for which reservations were made months in advance, and the ND Club has since filed suit to recover financial losses from the subsequent battle. 
In early September, Alumni Club Member John A. O'Brien made reservations at three Birmingham hotels. 225 were reserved at the Hilton Hotel and 55 rooms were reserved at the Ramada Inn. O'Brien also reserved 21 rooms for those alumni particularly close to the team, at the Sheraton. 
In a telephone interview, O'Brien said,"Basically, the Sheraton came back and cancelled my reservation, saying that I didn't make a deposit." O'Brien added that, initially, the hotel neglected to inform him that a deposit was necessary. He immediately made the $500 deposit and his reservations were reinstated. 
For reasons not yet clear, the Sheraton once again cancelled O'Brien's reservations in early October. As compensation, the Sheraton offered lodging in other Birmingham motels, but O'Brien refused the offer. He described his predicament by saying,"! had 21 people hanging out on a string." . . 
Shortly after the incident, an irate O'Bnen filed a damages. s.mt against the Sheraton. He obtained a temporary courtorder, requmng. the Sheraton to adhere to the original contract. 
There is a hearing scheduled for this Monday at 8 a.m. O'Brien hopes to receive enough money in damages to cover the legal costs and a $500 injunction fee. 
Though he is grateful for the injunction, O'Brien laments that the whole ordeal has been "one big hassle." 
Mike Clark, the Sheraton's general manager, refused to elaborate on the matter, saying, "As long as this case is pending in Judge Barber's court, I am not at liberty to discuss any details of the case." 
Senate dumps Reagan tax legislation 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The outgoing Democratic-control­led 96th Congress, embarking on a final "lame-duck'' session. junked plans yesterday for con­sideration of a tax cut backed by President-elect Ronald Reagan. 
Senate Democrats voted over­whelmingly against even bring­ing the tax cut bill to the floor­a measure House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill announced President Carter was prepared to veto if it reached his desk. 
Leaders promised that the session-the first post-election meeting of Congress in a presidential election year in 32 years-would be brief, with a shortened agenda. 
Although congressional Republicans were still pressing for enactment of a tax cut this year, the proposal was virtually buried-at least until 1981 ­when Senate Democrats voted in a closed-door caucus against bringing it to the Senate floor. 
At the same time, O'Neill told reporters that he had discussed the tax-cut proposal with Carter 
in  a  Monday  evening  phone  
conversation.  
"The  president  told  me  he  

would veto a tax bill were it to reach his desk. He said it would be inflationary," O'Neill said. 
Thus, Republicans will ap­parently hav~ to wait until next year before pushing the kind of tax cut that Reagan has made the centerpiece of his · economic program. 
"We felt Mr. Reagan ought to have his time at bat," Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd told reporters after the Senate caucus vote. 
Byrd had previously favored an immediate tax cut, but said he changed his mind after talking to the president and assessing the situation in the House where there never was much support for the tax cut proposal. 
No major new legislation is expected to be approved, beyond needed budget and ap­propriations bills and several measures already well on the way toward passage, O'Neill said. 
Meanwhile, the speaker, who becomes his party's highestrank­ing elected oficial once Republicans take over both the White House and the Senate in 
January, said rebuilding the Democratic Party would require a "dynamic figure" as party chairman. 
He did not mention the cur­rent chairman, John C. White, who has indicated he would like to stay on. O'Neill aide Gary Hymel said the speaker's remarks weren't intended as a slap at White. 
The Senate began the lame­duck session by taking up a $9.5 7 billion appropriation bill for several federal departments while the House debated a prposed extension of govern­ment's revenue sharing program, which expired last October 1. 
By Rasa Gustaitis: Pacific News Service: EDITOR'S NOTE: Fatlure to take allfactors into account in the design of new energy-efficient office but/dings and homes bas resulted in increased levels ofindoor air pollution which is causing a growing health hazard. Unfortunately, no government agency is responsiblefor indoor air, and no health standards exist, reports Rasa Gustaitis, a PNS editor. 
Indoor air pollution, especially in new energy-efficient homes and offices, is making many Americans sick and posing a health hazard to countless others. 
The hazard is growing more serious with the growing use of man-made building materials, some of which emit harmful vapors, and with energy con­servation measures that reduce ventilation. 
"Buildings today-new build­ings in particular-are causing people to get sick," said Assemblyman Floyd Mori, ~hairman of a joint legi~l:ttive subcommittee holding hearings on the subject in California this fall. 
"Most of us spend most of our life indoors," he said. "Indoor air pollution is one of the major problems we will face in the future." 
The problem has become something of a headache itself for citizens who have discovered that no official agency is in charge and no standards exist.

Retired General Alexander M. HaigJr., the former White House chiefofstaff, says he has notbeenasked to serve as secretary ofstate or secretary ofdefense in the coming Ronald Reagan administration. Some political observers believe those two posts may be offered to the onetime commander ofallied forces in Europe. Haig has been a strong supporter of Reagan. He said he is "perfectly happy" in his current job as president of the huge United Technologies corporation. In his remarks, the 55-yearold Haig termed Reagan's victory over President Carter "a profound shift in national direction demanded by the American electorate." He said that in Reagan, the United States will have a leader who recognizes that "twenty years of neglect ofAmerican'defense forces has finally placed us in a position where an American president, with or without Salt II, finds himself, in a number of areas of measurement, inferior to the Soviet Union." 
The rumbling Pavlof volcano 
on the tip of the Alaska Peninsula spewed ash, rocks and lava down its snow-covered flanks yesterday after erupting "like a big blowtorch" one day earlier. Pilots flying near the 8,905 foot peak reported that ash was drifting northwest, at altitudes up to 15,000 feet, making it impossible for them to get a close lookat the mountain. "It looks like night over there because of the ash " said a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman in Cold Bay, 35 miles southwest of the m~untain a~d the nearest community of any size. Everett Sk1nner, a pdot for !:~eve Aleutian Airways, reported Tuesday the volcano erupted like a big blowtorch." Lava poured from the mountainintermittentl.y throughout Tuesday night, said witnesses in Cold Bay. Pavlof 1s one of the most active of Alaska's long chain of volcanoes, which stretches from near Anchorage down the Alaska Peninsula through the Aleutian Islands. Pavlof, southwest of Anchorage, last erupted in 1975 and 1976. More than 25 eruptions have been recorded there since 1700. 
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem 
Begin, vowing to keep up the search for peace in the Middle East, arrived today for talks with President Carter on the slow­moving negotiations over Palestinian autonomy. Begin's visit could mark the start of an effort by Carter to set up another Midea,st summit meeting before he leaves the White House in January. However, the ultimate decision on whether there will be a summit appears to be in the hands of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. After Carter sees Begin he will get in touch with Sadat. Begin, who sees the president today, said, "The process of peacemaking should go on-will go on." He was greeted at blustery Andrews Air Force Base in nearby Maryland by Secretary ofState Edwin S. Muskie, who told the Israeli leader that "our welcome is as warm as the day is cold." 
-Jeanne, the most oowerful 
hurncane ever to work its way so far north in tfie GulfofMexic,o so late in the season, drifted slowly south of New Orleans yesterday and forecasters said it may not reach land with any punch. The chilly waters of the Gulfsapped the strength of the storm, the first November hurricane in 14 years. At 5 p.m. EST yesterday, the storm, with winds of75 mph, was centered aBout 400 miles south of New Orleans, near latitude 24.0 north, longitu~O.O west. Gale force winds extended 150 miles north of the Hurricane and 100 miles to the south. The storm was moving west at about 5 mph. But foreasters said it was doubtful that Jeanne would reach land with any significant force. "Everything's against it," said Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center. "It probably won't make it to land." Jeanne, the first Atlanticarea hurricane to form in November since 1966, was farther north and west than any tropical storm ever recorded so late in the season. 
The anti-draft movement turned 
to President-elect Ronald Reagan yesteray in an attempt to halt the next round ofregistration. The Rev. Barry Lynn, head ofthe CommitteeAgainst Registration and the Draft, asked Reagan in a letter to move quickly to end draft registration. During the campaign Reagan said he oppoes peacetime draft registration because it is unnecessary and limits personal freedom. Lynn asked Reagan to make an announcement that, once he takes office onJan. 20, he will issue an executive order canceling the registration program. More than 3.5 million men born in 1960 and 1961 were registered last summer, and registration ofmen born in 1962 is scheduled to get under way onJan. 5. A ~eagan announcement now that he plans to cancel the program would likely lead to a decision not to go ahead with the January registration, which is expected to cost about $5 million, Lynn said.

Media and selling Reagan 
As liberals and otherprophets ofdoom continue to reconcile themselves to the fact that Ronald Reagan did win the presidency, it's time to step back for a momentand examine the role the media played in Reagan's startlingly large victory. It's a discussion first begun in this space last Friday by Managing Editor Mark Rust, and we will attempt to correct some ofhis basic misconceptions while offering some insights of our own. 
Let's begin with this basic disagreement. "The media clearly loves him," Rust wrote of Reagan. "They held their collective passion in check throughout the election, refraining from salivat­ing too often over his sense of dramatics." Vomiting, we feel, would be a more accurate description ofthe media's oral reaction to Reagan. 
Liberals such as William Raspberry, Joseph Kraft, Anthony Lewis (dubbed "the Imam of the liberals" by the Village Voke'J Cockburn and Ridgeway) and Morton Kondracke far outnumber conservatives su~h as George Will and William Buckley, not just on the op-ed page but in the reportorial ranks as well. The alarming rise of the New Right and the Moral Majority has been thoroughly documented in every publication from The New Republic to Tiger Beat. EJquire magazine headlined its August cover with the plea, "We warned you about Johnson. We warned you about Nixon. We warn ed you about Carter. Now will you pleaJe listen to us aboutREAGAN?" EJquire'J circulation has beendeclin­ing steadily for years now. 
The electronic press was no different. Bill Plante of CBS News followed Reagan around the country for months, and twice compiled potentially deva­stating indictments of Reagan's campaign tech­nique, one a quote-by-quo'te analysis of position switches, the otheranexpoJe of the true facts behind Reagan's famed statistics. 
-Richard Reeves, in a sum­mer special on ABC en­titled "Lights, Cameras, Politics," portrayed Reagan as a blithering idiot in one segment ofthe program. He followed an early campaign commercial with tape of a confused reply by the candidate regarding the same ad onan "Issues and Answers" program. After the Republican convention, CBS ran an hilarious collection of footage showing George Bush repeatedly denying he would consider a vice­presidential spot on the GOP ticket. From all conversations we have had with journalists during this campaign, especially in Detroit, it is clear that Ronald Reagan offends the intelligence ofa majority ofthe national press, and that revulsion often found its way into print in the past year.

Tom Jackman. 
Executive News Editor 

National Review and The Amerkan Spectator are in the 
moral minority among the still liberal media in 
1980. 

Indeed, one need look no further than The 
ObJerver, which endorsed John Anderson, Birch 
Bayh and John Brademas in the face of obvious 
campus sentiment to the other extreme. The paper followed this with an editorial page which one day contained articles entitled, "'I ·voted for Jimmy Carter:' A true confession," (Mike Onufrak, editorials editor), "The case against Ronald Reagan," (Anthony Walton, regular columnist), and "Liberalism in America not dead yet," Oim Murphy, head of the Young Democrats). One "Inside" columnist also pro­claimed his backing for Anderson in this space. 
All this should hearten those who fear that the 
power and influence of the media is getting out of 
hand. Reagan won big despite what we feel was an 
obvious bias against him. Jimmy Carter also 
repulsed the press, but it was incompetence whkh 
made him unacceptable, 
_not his ideas and programs. 
Perhaps the American 
public can be credited with 
greater independence in 
making up its mind in 
1980. 

Unfortunately, we don't 
think so. Instead, the re­
verse can be said. The in­
fluence of television, that 
medium so vastly reviled in 
print, became even greater 
in this campaign-not its 
editorial influence, which 
was almost negligible, but 
its visual impact. News­
papers and magazines are 
for ideas: television is for 
f.~· images, and it can no long­
~ () er be denied that, in the 
_ mind of the average American voter, images are much more important to the qecision-making thought process than ideas. 
ln this campaign, the national press had a virtual 
field day with such Reaganisms as the toxic quality 
of trees, the birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan or 
problems with the theory of evolution. He often 
sounded quite silly. But it didn't matter. These 
serious, repeated gaffes-didn't bother the average 
voter, who still perceived Reagan in a better light 
than Carter. He/she either couldn't see or was 
unwilling tQ make the effort to see ·the ideas 
behind the image, the substance behind the 
silhouette. Perhaps this was the case with Mark -Rust. Who drd you vote for Mark?

Students prepare for 'Barna trip 
By David Sarphie StaffReporter 
As the highly toured match up between Notre Dame .and Alabama nears, marty Irish fans are preparing for the lon_g drive from South Bend to Btrming­ham. 
Approximately 500 students will be making the twelve hour trip, according to the Sports Information Office. The Athletic Department spokes­man noted that this is an unusually large number of students traveling such a distance for a game. 
Many of the students will be leaving late Thursday after­noon. "I'm blowin~ off pre­registration,'' said JUnior Pat O'Connor. When asked how long he thought the drive would be, he replied, "about 18 beers." _ 
O'Connor and five of his friends will be selling specially made t-shirts at an alumni party in the Birmingham Hilton Friday night. The shirts portray "Touchdown ) esus" standing over Alabama s tombstone. 
Gallery to exhibit oil paintings 
Gallery Aquinas, Inc. will feature the exhibit, "Faces." "Faces" will be a collection ofoil paintings by South Bend artist Katherine Robinson. Ms. Robin­son's works include a number of portraits, many bold and life­size, which stress not only in­dividual characters, but also the settings in which those characters are found. 
"Faces" will run from Nov. 14 through Dec. 7, with an opening reception to meet the artist from 7-10 p.m. on Friday, November 14. 
Gallery Aquinas, Inc. is located at 103 1/2 W. Monroe in South Bend, and is open to the public from noon until 5 p.m. on Saturda'ys' and Sundays. 
Some of the students making the trip have yet to acquire tickets for Saturday's game. Although some will be taking checkbooks along in hopes of finding reasonable scalpers, others are going just for the parties. "I don't have a ticket, and I don't know if I'll be able to get one," said Barry Tharp, ''But I plan to have a good time anyway.'' 
According to the AAA Chica~o Motor Club, motorists planmng to take the trip should take U.S. 31 south to Indiana­polis and transfer to 1-65. This will take them straight to 

Birmin~ham. 
Desptte the many parties which will envelope Crimson Tide Country on Friday night, Saturday's all-important game is of course the major attraction for the Irish invaders. One fan summed up the feelin~s of the journeyers when he satd, "I'm going to see the Crimson Tide get pushed out to sea. We're going to make Alabama sorry that Georgia Tech tried us last week." 
Heads for stars 

Voyager passes Saturn 
PASADENA, California (AP) Voyager I soared past Saturn's banded yellow cloudtops yes­terday, buzzed about a half­dozen cratered, frozen moons and shocked busy scientists with a bizarre "braided" ringlet within the planet's shin­ing rin~s. It then began a long, lonely Journey toward the stars. 
''The results have been just absolutely astounding,'' said Bradford Smith, head of the Voyager camera team. "We're seeing new things so remote from our experience that we're not able to come up with even a hint of a suggestion as to what some of them are.'' 
The fast-paced tour of Sat­urn's exotic realm climaxed an exploratory voyage of 38 months and 1.24 billion miles. Scientists will be analyzing and arguing for years to come over the hundreds of pictures and mountains of data. 

The robot spaceship made its closest approach to Saturn-­about 77,000 miles from the planet=-·at 3:46 p.m. PST, but audio signals announcing the sucessful passage needed an hour and 25 minutes to cover the 947 million miles from Saturn to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here. 
Sailing beneath the famous rings, where Voyager already had revealed puzzling complex­ity, the ship found two narrow ringlets that almost appear entwined like crude braids and ''it bog~les the mind that that even extsts," Smith said. 
He said scientists could not 

explain the strange structure 
which was discovered in the 
narrow, outer ribbon, called the 
F ring. ' 
Voyager, reaching speeds of more than 56,500 mph, showed earthbound scientists complex motions within the softly colored clouds that are Saturn's only surface. As the planet grew before Voyager's cam­eras, the washed-out yellowish sphere. displayed ribbons and swirls, halos and spots where winds Jayed with the haze­covere atmosphere 
En route to its rendezvous with Saturn, a gas-filled ball big enough to hold 800 earths, the ship turned its cameras and instruments on some of the 15 Sarurnian moons. Except for giant titan, they seem to be made of what one scientist called "dirty ice. " 
Images showed details never seen before on the moon's icy surfaced: a long, deep canyon cutting across 500 miles of Tethys; a peaked hill surroun­ded by a huge crated S,('read over nearly a fourth of Mtmas; circular meteoric craters sur­rounded by bright rays on Dione; and the pocked, streaked and blotchy surface of Rhea. 
As Voyager sped away from Saturn, it also searched the region for any as yet undis­covered moons and probed the broad rings for clues to the size and composition ofthe particles that compose thell\· .,..

Iraq attacks key positions 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) Iran's oil refining center, Abadan, came under renewed Iraqi artillery and air attacks yesterday, Tehran Radio reported. The Iranian news agency Pars also reported fighting among pro-Iraqi groups in Sanandaj, a Kurdish-populat­ed city in western Iran. 
A U.N. peace-seeking envoy to visit Iran and Iraq next week said his mission will to be gather information rather than conduct negotiations and will not include any discussion of the Amrican· hostages in Iran. 
The envoy, former Prime Minister Olof Palme of Sweden, leader of the Socialist Party there, said in Stockholm "there ar~ deep rooted differences between these nations and one can not expect rapid results." 
Palme said he would confer in New York with U.N. Secretary­General Kurt Waldheim later this week, then fly to Geneva, Switzerland on Sunday before heading for Tehran and then Baghdad.

tion Agency is responsible for outdoor' air quality. The National Institute for Occupa­tional Safety and Health and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration monitor air in industrial workplaces. But no­body has responsibility for air in homes, offices, vehicles (includ­ing school buses), retail stores, and other indoor environments where air pollution problems exist. 
The most serious problems so far have been reported in new and remodeled office buildings and homes with energy-saving features, and in mobile homes. Most involve formaldehyde in construction materials, such as particle board and indoor ply­wood, and in urea formaldehyde foam insulation. 

Other contaminants inc1iide nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide, which have been found in the air of some offices and homes at higher concentra­tions than what is permissible by the Clean Air Act for the out­doors. 
Formaldehyde vapors leak in­to the air when the temperature rises and they combine with other contaminants into a mix that can cause headaches, respiratory irritations, watery eyes, skin irritations, nausea, diarrhea and heart problems. 

At the third of four hearings being held on indoor pollution by California's joint legislative audit committee's subcom­mittee on investigations, Priscilla Ouchida, of Sacramento, testified on Sep­tember 29 in San Francisco about the way her new home turned into a "si<>kening night-' mare. 
Her husband, an engineer, took care to include all possible energyconserving features in the house, including weather strip­ping, ceiling and wall insulation and double-glass windows. Window space was reduced and cabinet space expanded. 
"After the rug and cabinets were install~d my eyes started to sting and my ears to plug up when I was in the house," said 

Mrs. Ouchida. Others who were inside experienced similar symp­toms. 
Since the Ouchidas moved in last October, she said, she has been waking up with sore throats, dry skin, a cough and frequently with diarrhea. Each time the temperature rises the symptoms get worse. , 
"It's like being allergic to my house," said Mrs. Ouchida. 
When she heard about troubles others were having with formaldehyde vapors, she ar­ranged to have the air in her home tested. Formaldehyde was leaking from cabinets and floor­ing, which were constructed of particle board. 
"We really don't know what to do," she said. "We want to have children but we're afraid; we've heard of birth defects. And· we don't feel we, can sell because we'd have to tell the buyer what's wrong with it. Estimates for replacing the cabinets and flooring under the rugs have been $15,000-$25,000, and we have extended oilrselves already in buying the house." 
Other than appealing to the builder or suing him, the Ouchidas seem to have no re­course. No public agency has set standards for permissible levels of formaldehyde in homes. 
Many office workers who become chronically tired, ex­perience headaches, eye irrita­tion and respiratory problems have a similar dilemma. 
At first their complaints tend to be dismissed as imagined or caused by outside activities, said Dr. Molly Coye, chief of the occupational health clinic at San Francisco General Hospital. But even when indoor pollution within the office is shown to be the cause, "Often we wind up saying, 'yes, .YOU have a problem, you are not crazy, but we really cannot help you."' 
Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts are among states that have begun to take steps toward deali}lg with the problem by requiring cautionary labels on construction materials that contain formaldehyde resins. Minnesota also is one of the few states that provides testing ofair within homes when a physician suspects formaldehyde vapor might be damaging a resident's health.

Reagan plans budget cuts 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Ad­visers to President-elect Ronald Reagan have drawn a list of possible government cutbacks totaling nearly six percent of the 1981 federal budget, a principal aide to Reagan disclosed yester­day. 
The areas where the cuts would be made were not dis­closed, althoug~ it was indicated that none would be made in the defense budget. 
Edwin Meese Ill, who is directing the Reagan transition into the White House, said a spending control task force drew up the list so that Reagan could fulfill a campaign pledge to cut the budget by 2 percent. 
Democrats on the House Budget Committee challenged Reagan to honor that promise by voting Tuesday to set a budget

ceiling that would force the president-elect to cut spending by $17 billion, or about two percent, from the current budget drafted by the committee's staff. 
The committee action would reduce the budget from $648.7 billion to $631.7 billion and reduce the projected deficit from $38.4 billion to $25 billion. 
A budget reduction of six percent in 1981 would equal nearly $39 billion, enough to wipe out the entire deficit. 
One ofReagan's top campaign pledges was to trim federal spending by two percent by eliminating fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement from the budget. 
Asked how the new president would accomplish that goal, Meese said a special task force already had targeted areas relat­ing to "specific tightening up. specific cutting ofadministrative overhead rather than cutting of 
whole programs. although .. some minor programs" may be eliminated altogether. "The list actually is much pwre_ than two percent. As a matter of fact, the list would probably account for nearly six percent of the budget," said Meese. Reagan will "sift and choose from among the recommendat­ions and then we'll announce what revisions he feels are necessary in the budget to ac­complish a two percent re­duction," he said. Meese did not identify any specific areas for cuts, although Reagan has said the defense budget would not be touched. 
Meese spoke with reporters before going to the White House for his first face-to-face meeting with his transition counterpart, 

Jack Watson, who is President Carter's chie{ ofstaff. Transition staffs representing Reagan and Carter are seeking to plan an orderly transfer of power on January 20, when Reagan is 
· inaugurated. Watson announced that Carter and Reagan will hold their first face-to-face meeting since the election next week at the White House when Reagan returns to Washington to take charge of his transition team. 
Watson alw disclosed that Rosalynn Carter and Nancy Reagan will meet next week, presumably for the next first lady to get a tour of the livin~ quarters.

Air force plane crashes 
WASHINGTON (AP)-An Air Force transport plane crashed outside Cairo, Egypt, late last night, killing all six crewmen plus seven passengers, a Navy spokesman confirmed here. 
The plane, a C-141, was de­ployed as part of the first over­seas test of the United States' new Rapid Deployment Force. About 1 ,400 American Army troopers and airmen are taking part in the exercise with Egyptian military forces. 
Details of the accident were sketchy and the cause was not immediately determined. 
The plane, dispatched from McChord Air Force Base in Washington state, apparently crashed while attempting to land at the Cairo West Airport 20 miles from the Egyptian capital, Navy Lt. Michael E. McCagesaid. 
The names of the victims were withheld pending notification of next of kin. 
The training exercise, called "Bright Star," is designed to last about two weeks. Its main force is comprised of a battalion and supporting units from the Army's 101 Airborne Division based at Fort Campbell, Ky. 
The Rapid Deployment Force is designed to be dispatched rapidly in case of a crisis, specifically in the oilJrich Persian Gulf region. ' ·  '"'

his cartoon (p. 8} definitely takes a stance on the greatest of all political issues, war. Part of Byrnes' not-so-subtle message here is that war is ugly. This cartoon accom­panied a column of Athony Walton's earlier this year, and is one of my favorites. Brendan McGuire is a freshman residing in Holy Cross Hall and his cartoon on page 8 is his second for The Observer. While Byrnes chose to deal with something as universal -and timeless as war, McGuire homed in on the plight ofbasketball­ticket-less freshman. While just about anyone anywhere can under­stand Bymes,.McGuire's work is attuned specifically to Notre Dame. Both, I think, are ~qually effective. 
Political cartoonists will continue to raw as long as there is politics. And that will be a long time. Ifyou have any artistic ability and want to "get in the act" bring your work up to The Observer, I would be willing to take -a look. In the meantime, take a hint from the political car­toonists: When you consider politics, look for the funny side .

Thur November 13 





torials cartoon sp 
Political cartoonists have been snaring more than their share of notoriety lately, not only because of the recent election, but also because of the general excellence of their work. JetT MacNelly (Pulitzer prize winner and recent subject of a Neii'SII'eek cover story), Pat Oliphant, and Garry Trudeau are three of the best known of today's cartoonists. Trudeau. also a Pulitzer prize winner, has been featured in The Obsenw for a number of years and his series Doonesbun· celebrated its ten-year anniversar-Y last month. Feminism, jogging. the excesses of liberalism and conservatism, TV and football are all fair game for Trudeau and his wit. His controversial strip was in the news lately when his pre-election series Reagan sBrain was dropped from the comic page and run on ,everal newspapers' orred or editor­ials page (some editors feeling that it was too vicious and politically­biased). Nevertheless it continues to be the second most popular cartoon strip in America. behind Peanll.ts, 
Trudeau is not the only c~ist to be accused of viciousness.i -Bdth MacNelly and Oliphar.t have been branded with the samt· charge. So vicious, that some rapers ha-.e dropped Oliphant from tlteir editorials 
·or perspective page and run his cartoons strictly on the orred page. Currently Oliphant is· carried by more papers than MacNelly, but MacNelly, several years Oliphant's junior, is gaining fast-Both men say their cartoons only reflect the issues and if they are vicious it is because the issues (and the men behind them) deserve it. The Obsen-er has carried Oliphant for two years and, like Doonesbury, we receive it through Universal Press Syndicate. The syndicate sends us Oliphant three times a week and we are allowed to run them at will. We receive Doones­burv about a week and a half in ad~ance. Each is dated and we are obligated to publish the right car­toon on the right day. If you have been watching closely you may have noticed that this is not always the case. 
Political cartoonists, of course, are no strangers to collegiate news­papers with Trudeaus's Doones­bury·(which ran in Yale's daily in the late '60s) the most famous example. These early Doonesburys featured naked football players showering in the locker room and a few four-letter words which Trudeau had to eschew when his strip was picked by the syndicate after his graduation. Obsener car­toonist Michael Molinelli'sMolan·ry is comparable to the early Doones­burys in many ways. Molarity is_at its best when it lampoons campus life and the inhibitions and problems that go w~th it as early Doonesburys did. The quality of the dining hall's tood. the tenuous relationship be-· cween the sexes. and the immov­.1bility of the administration have all been fair game for Molinelli. Like Trudeau. many of his charac­ters are based on real people he -;ees around him. He even has a ..:ompilation of Molarities in book form appearing today. Like MacNelly, who also draws a daily >eries, Shoe, Molinelli has taken to

Cou~try Rock Jam A new classic? 

They said "Let'sJam" and kept their word. Last week's Country Rock Jam proved that country's not all Nashville hick. Not being much ofa country fan, l still thought it was the best concert I've seen on this campus in two years. 
The word to describe the 8-hour concert is "variety." From the hot fiddle of Wisconsin's Radio Flyer to the acoustic rock set offormer Orleans mainstay John Hall, Country Jam offered a wide enough variety of high­quality musicians so that even if you hate WJVA (like l do) you loved the concert. 
The evening had a couple of bright spots. The highlight was defintely the appearence offiddler Vassar Clements. Clements is widely regarded as the best fiddle player in country, having played on literally hundreds ofalbums for the likes of The Allman Brothers, Bonnie Raitt, and the Band. Last week's performence made me believe it. He and his band had the crowd on its feet dancing throughout most of the 100­minute set with a mixture ofbluegrass, country, and rock. But the energy of the band was dim in comparison to Clements' fiddle. Keeping to his motto "Have fiddle, will jam!" Clements blasted away with a finesse well worthy ofhis reputation through his rendition of "Orange Blossom Special," "Rockytop," and a stunning version of "Jessica" which he wrote for The Allman Brothers' Dickie Betts. Clements is just a class act. 
The other bright spot was the return 

I realizedafterfinishin$_ it that last week's qmz was, first, very difficult, and second, putentially ambiguous. Needless to say, there were no winners on last week's qutz. Based uprm past experience, I would have been very surprisedifar1yone had won. However, ifyou think you know all ofthis week's answers, bring it to the Observer office by Monday, and -voila! -ten dollars could be coming your way. 
This week's quiz is very simple in theory. I am going to name an odd album title; you tell me who was responsible for it. 
1. 
You Broke My Hearl, So I Busted Your jaw 

2. 
A Nod's as Good as a Wink... to a Blind Horse 


3. Aoxomoxoa 

4. My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows 
5.

The answers to last week's quiz are as follows: (1) "My Love," "Venus," "I'm Sorry," and "Best of My Love"-two different songs with these titles hit number one; (2) Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Tammi Terrell, and Diana 
of former students Rich Prezioso and Kevin Quigley, who drove from San Fransisco with 5 guitars and a mandolin to make the date. For those of us who used to pack the Nazz when they were at ND, it was a special event. "The boys from California" were in style at ~ountry Jam, playing both original material and some choice selections from Hoyt Axton, Steve Forbert and Pure Prarie League. Except for some equipment problems, the two plus Claude "Nice People" Arthur put on a smooth show with their instrumental work complement­ing nicely their strong harmonies. Hopefully, they'll be back headlining someday. 
The only real problem with the show was the placement of the bands. The beginning ofthe show woke the crowd up. However, the placement of talented but laid back Hall's set in between local favorite Heartsfield and Vassar Clements slowed the show down just as the crowd got really hot. Having Hall play before Heartsfield would have better kept with the pace of the show. 
The only regret l have was small crowd. Everyone bitches about no social life and fails to take advantage of a quality event. Five bands and eight hours of music for four bucks! l just hope enough people catch on next year that CountryJam is a concert well worth supporting and that it doesn't die because of student apathy. 

John Higgins 
Ross all did duets with Marvin Gaye; 
(3) "Stairway to Heaven," "More Than a Woman," and "Pinball Wizard," in the versions mentioned, all received heavy AM airplay yet were never released to the public on 45 RPM; (4) Boston, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and New Orleans are all mentioned in Chuck Berry's "Sweet Little Sixteen"; (5) The three Elton John songs referred to all end in the word "song"-"Bord.er Song," "Your Song," and "Love Song"; (6) "From A Wil).dow," "It's for You," and "Nobody I Know" were all written by Lennon and McCartney but never 

· released by the Beatles; (7) Phil Spector, Glyn Johns, and George Martin co-produced the Beatles' LP Let It Be; (8) "Subterranean Homesick Blues," "Trampled Under Foot," and "Space Oddity" all do not mention the title during the course of the song; (9) Dinah Shore ("Buttons and Bows"), Patti Page ("The Tennessee Waltz"), and Debby Boone ("You Light Up My Life") have the three biggest hits by female solo singers in chart history; and(lO) Bill Graham, BertKaempfert, and Jacksdn Browne were all born in Germany.

The Empire Strikes Back 


London 

Symphony 

Orchestra 
Perhaps this is a rather late date 
for reviewing an album that made its 
appearance m May of 1980. I would 
venture to say this is early for a 
review of what comes close to being 
classical music. When you consider 
that reviews are still being written of 
Mazart sy!llphonies and Verdi op­
eras, a difference of a few months IS 
as nothing when compared to the 
centuries other works have survived. 
The Empire Strikes Back soundtrack 
is a remarkable blend of classical 
music ideas and the needs ofmodern 
film making. The music is so 
designed so its development para­
llels the action and character devel­
opment of the film. By tying the 
music with the film, ] ohn Williams 
has achieved a unique effect in the 
oft-repetetive medium ofthe cinema. His achievment in the Empire 'soundtrack goes beyond a mere 
welding of audio/visual impressions. 
Williams has composed some high 
caliber material worthy of being 
judged on its musical merits alone. 
Beginning with its opening track 
the Empire soundtrack is clearly 
more than a recapitulation of the 
Stars Wars motifs. These themes are 
present as Williams insists their · 
presence is necessary to enhance the 
thematic unity of the different films. 
The motifs are, however, subordi­
nated to the requirements of pre­
senting a completely different set of 
musical ideas that relate to a 
different serie·s of events. The open­
in_g track begins with a restatement 
of the original Star Wars theme: the 
blast of trumpets and other brass at 
the beginning of both films. From 
there however the similarity rapidly 
fades. The opening track digresses 
into a sinister pattern of staccato 
themes interspersed with heavy brass and percussion that underline the appearance of the evil Empire's forces. The lmpena/ March (track 1 side 2) is essentially the theme of Darth Vader: minion of the Imperial will and chief executor of the Emperor's plans. The March moves relentlessly forward, each repetition ofthe theme played an octave higher than the last. This piece, too, is played largely by the brass section of the orchestra with a mild percussion accompaniment. The theme is easily recognizable and immediately brings to mmd the hulking form of the Dark Lord. 
In direct contrast to the relentless, war-like quality of Vader's theme, Williams composed the deli~htful, sensuous Yoda's· Theme (stde 1, 
, track 2). Simplicity in a piece is a difficult thing to attain when writing music performed by a symphony orLhesstra. Williams, in testament to his skill as a composer, achieves this subtle simplicity with a melody that is lilting and melancholy yet joyful and rippling like laughter. Played with great sensitivity and tenderness by the London Symphony Orches­tra, Yoda 's Theme IS perhaps the most beautiful piece on the album. Its only rival might be the love theme associated with the affair between Princess Leia and the pirate Han Solo. Written in the tradition of romantic nineteenth century opera, the love theme is a sweeping, simple melody played by the full orchestra, evoking deep feelings of romance and adventure due to its setting in the unbounded grandeur of the stars. 
There is much in the Empire soundtrack suggestive of classical music. It must be noted however that since the music is tied to the action taking place on a screen, formal modes of classical composi­tion cannot be observed. That ts to say, williams could not have written a symph~my in its four lenghty sections stmJ?lY because a symphony has a thematic unity unique to Itself. This would make it difficult to use in something as varied as the Star Wars senes since films depend on flexible material. The music of the Empire makes excellent listening and the London Symphony Orchestra is flawless in its performance.

Belles own po~tive attitude 

By Deirdre Grant Sports Writer 

"Some teams come into State like a ball of fire,'' says Saint Mary's volleyball coach Erin Murphy. And this is the type of team she's hoping to take with her to Hanover College this weekend for the Division III State Tournament. 
''Though I an the coach, I can also be objective. We've seen every team that we could be up against and I really believe we have the talent and skill to be considered a top conender in our division. 
"Saint Mary's takes a 16-12-3 record to State. These numbers, according to Murphy, don't accurately indicate the strength of the team. A number of the losses occurred at the beginning of the season when confidence and a desire to win were lacking in the team members. 
Murphy is quick to point out that she has never doubted the . team's ability, but it took a while for the/iris to understand that they ha to step out on the court wuh confidence. 
The October tri-match against Notre Dame and Taylor is what opened up the team's eyes and even caused the eyes of Murphy to take a second approving glance at the team. The Belles entered the battle with a new spirited and aggressive attack. They walked away with hands down victories against both opponents. 
However, don't think that this winning team blossomed overnight. Rather, it has been the product of many afternoons of practice and an equally important factor called PMA-

Observer Sports Special-ND, SM C Volleyball 
Thursday, November 13, 1980-page 11 
Saint Mary's is going to 
concentrate on playing their 
game. 

And just what is the Belle's game plan? Murphy proudly states that she has a team full of skilled players. 
"If one girl is having an off day I don't hesitate going to the _ bench because there is a lot of der.th," explains Murphy. 
'Strategically, passing and serve receive will be the key. When the team performs well in these areas it seems that they are very hard to break. Of course, there will be plenty of PMA around." 
In conclusion, Murphy says, "Experience has been a great cure-all. Hopefully the ex­perience we have gained throughout the seasen will come through this weekend.'' 
Like a ball of f1re! 
Positive Mental Attitude. PMA 
is Murphy's recipe for the 
Belles. 

Earlier in the season Murphy commented thet the girls needed to develop self­confidehce. "We have worked on team confidence and a needed desire to win, which was a problem most of the year. "Now, says Murphy, "we don't have to worry too much about that." 
''The team has the skill to place in the top three. The key to our performance will be for us to play the Saint Mary's game of volleyball.'' 
Because there are no qual­ifying tournaments, the Belles will be up against an extreme range of teams. This is a worry to Murphy because many times a team attempts to adjust their strategy and style to the level of their opponents. Therefo~,

Optimism aboundsfor state tournament 
By Mark Hannuksela 
Sports Writer 
Despite finishing the regular season with a disappointing 3-12 record, the Notre Dame women's volleyball team heads into this evening's opening round of the division II district tournament with a newly resur­r~ent wave of optimism. 
"We're very optimistic heading into the tournament,'' says senior co-captain Debbie

Notre Dame's volleyball team wtll depend on a strong performancefrom Mishawaka native Maureen Morin. 
Romo. "Everyone is really psyched about 1t. We only have seven healthy bodies though, so that might be a problem.'' 
Coached by Sandy Vansla­ger, the Irish enter the tourna­ment as losers in their last two contests. Last week's final home match against Ti-State 
, was especially disappointing because the Insh lost the first two games of the match by very close 15-9 and 16-14 scores. Romo attributes that to a lack of experience. ''We have a very young team,'' says the native of Los Alamitos, Ca. ''That's really been our _(Jroblem all year--lack of expenence. We've been playing teams that have people on scholarship, or that have been playing varsiry ball for four or five years, and we're not able to match that exper­ience." "We do have talent on this team though,'' she continued, "there's no question about that. Sometimes though, we lack the intensiry and the 
consistency that other teams have. We can't afford that kind of play in the tournament, and if practice this week is any indication, I don't think we'll have to worry about that." 
''Throughout the season1 we have shown a tendency to sit back and play defense,'' said Romo, "and this is also some­thing that we can't afford in the tournament. When the front line hits ag_gresively, that helps the rest of us get going, so we're going to have to have that type of aggressive play this weekend if we hope to do well."

· During the regular season, Notre Dame took part in the St. Francis Tournament, but did not meet the host college. They did, however, meet St. Jo­seph's during the season, suf­fering a 15-8, 15-6, 15-2 stra­ight set loss. Romo and her teammates hope that will be rurned around sometime in the next two days.

Local players tnake their mark 
by Margaret Greene Sports Writer 

Just as Cincinatti Moeller breeds talented football players, so South Bend high schools have become training grounds for volleyball competitors. Samples of the gifted lot may be observed on area campus courts. · 
· Hailing from Mishawaka's Marian High School, Maureen Morin is one of the latest additions to the Notre Dame women's volleyball team. On neighboring Saint Mary's team, four local girls are also making their mark. Ellen Hoye (Penn high School), Mary Beth Hosinski (Marian), Amy Terry (South Bend Adams), and Terri Walters (St. Joseph's), lead the list of starters of the Belle squad. 
Notre Dame coach Sandy Vanslager is also a South_Bend native, graduating from W:ashing­ton High School. She is pleased w1th the performance of her Mishawaka player, Morin a freshman starter who she says helps keep the team on its feet. 
"Maureen is an inspiration from the minute she steps on the court. Her play is consistent, and she picks the girls up when things get slow." 
Off the court, Maure~ is adjusting -to rigid 
first year of studies curriculum but has her 
sights set on a science major. She also has 
great plans for the them. 
"We're ready for tournament play. Injuries 
have kept us down, but things should come 
together this weekend.'' 
On the other side of the street, four area 
juniors lead a youthful Belle squad. Spokes­
women Mary Beth Hosinski and Ellen H(Jye 
laud the efforts of their fellow "townies" and 
the team as a whole. 
"We've already beaten most of the teams 
we'll be facing. Our biggest plus is our skill at 
keeping composure on the court." 
According to Coach Erin Murphy, the four local players are the motivators for her crew. ''The team is very spirited and these four . work especially well together to build stabil­ity." 
After matches, the St. Mary's athletes head 
off to face a varied assortment of academic 
pursuits. Ellen and M~beth concentrate on 
business, while Amy foUows education, and 
Terri examines biology.  
Weekend tournament action will be rigid for 
both squads, but fans should look to these 
South Bend girls to generate solid and skillful 
play.

finish well as a team. That strategy will be altered slightly for the race this weekend. 
"The team realizes that they probably won:t be qualifying, though we know it isn't out of the question. But they still have an excellent attitude. There are team~. that we can and should beat and this is what we are shooting for. 
"It's a great meet w(th great teams and everyone is excited about running 'with that sort of competition. In addition they want to have a good showing that will give them some confidence for the indoor season. They have seen how much they have im­

proved over the season and now 
they can test theirselves with the 
best." 

"We've decided to split the team 
into two sections. The first will 
be Chuck Aragon, John Filosa, 
and Ralph Caron. These are the 
guys that have the best chance to 
make the final cut and I want 
them to push each other," ex­
plains Piane. 

Aragon and Filosa are the 
senior co-captains, while Caron 
is just a freshman. 

The other four runners on the ·seven-man Irish roster are senior 
John Riely, sophmores Tim 
Bartrand and Carl Bicicchi and 
freshman Andy Dillon. 
"We've altered our training schedule a little to prepare for this weekend. We have been concentrating more on speed work and cut down on our total distance for the purpose of resting. We've also concentrated on hitting specific mile times for the two groups.

Both Fighting Irish basket­ball teams will get a taste of game action for the first time this season when they take to the ACC court this Sunday night. It wonYt be real game action, but it'll be the next best thin~, as the annual intrasquad chanty games take place. 
Coach Mary DiStanislao will be showing off her ''new look'' women's squad beginning at 
7:00 p.m., and Digger Phelps will preview his 1980-81 team in the second game of the double-header. The men's game is scheduled to start at approximately 8:30 p.m. 
Tickets for the charity game are $1.00 for adults and fifty cents for children under 16. All Notre Dame St. Mary's stu­dents who present astudent ID will also be admitted for fifty cents. Tickets are on sale all this week at the gate ten office at the ACC, and will available at the door. As has been the case. in the past, all proceeds from the games will benefit the Special Olympics and the Neighborhood Study Help Pro­gram.

situation. 
The men's team will be split into two squads. The Gold team will consist of the pro­bable starting line-up for _the opening of the season. Semors Orlando Woolridge and Kelly Tripuka will open at the for­ward spots, with 6 foot 11 inch freshman Joe Kleine in the center spot. Tracy Jackson will move to the guard position this year, teaming up with. sopho­more John Paxson m the backcourt. · 
That means the Blue team 
will have Gilbert Salinas at 
center. Bill Varner and Cecil 
Rucker will complete the front­
court. Freshman tom luby and 
Barry Spencer are the swing­
men playing either forward or 
guard, and Stan Wilcox will 
start as the other Blue team 
guard. W alk-ons Ke_vin Haw­
kins and Marc Kelly complete 
the 1980-81 roster. 
''The freshmen are dying to 
play," says Phelps. "We've 
got to open with the Poland 
game next week, and then 
head out to California to play 
UCLA. We've got to start 
getting serious about the way 
we play." 

Center Tim Andree and guard Mike Mitchell are still nursing injuries, and "o/ill not see action Sunday night. And­ree may return in another week to ten days, but Mitchell is still several weeks from practicing.

Lucia, enrolled in Notre Dame's College of Engineering, grew up watching Badger hockey. 
"This,may sound obvious," he says, "but it is like a dream come true to go back to the Dane Coliseum and play against Wisconsin instead of spectat­ing." 
Lucia has played in half of Notre Dame's games this year. Classmate Mark Doman, a native of St. Cloud, Minn., played right wing on the third line last week against Minnesota. 
"Dave was a very pleasant surprise last year as a walk-on," said Irish coach Lefty Smith. "He is a very dedicated player-he always hustles-and we feel he can make quite a contribution to our program over the next few years." 
Three season ticket plans­Friday night ofa series, Saturday nights or all games-remain available at the discount price of $2 per game. , Ticket manager Mike Busick also says many students have yet 
to pick up their hockey season

summer.

Humphreys, on the other hand, competed against the Johnson brothers while playing for Premontre High Sc\ool in Green Bay. 
"It's nice playing at a place where you get to see family and friends," says Humphrey,;. 
"We are looking for big th ngs this year from Kevin," says Smith. "He is a superb skater a 1d forechecker and we hope for him to share the goal-scoring

What? 
Ok, ok, the decade then. 
No? 
How about the year? 
The week? 
Alright, alright ... I give up. This ain't no big game after all. Ofcourse, it coulda been a whopper if Bear hadn't choked against Mississippi State and the Irish hadn't wasted three hours in Atlanta. But now, with Alabama wallowing at number five ~nd Notre Dame on their heels at number six, what could be the possible significance of this game? 
How about a trip to New Orleans? 
How about a national championship? 
How about a couple million dollars? 
Ah ... can't you just see some eyes under the Dome light up on that last one. A win on Saturday would mean all of that for Notre Dame and much, much more besides.'' 
Like bragging rights, for one thing. The people down in A lab a rna (they call it the football capital of the sotlth) have turned this game into a grudge match simply because they've never been able to beat Notre Dame. Down in Tuscaloosa, the campus bookstore is pushing shirts and stickers that proclaim Alabama's dominance over theIrish. 
Or supposed dominance. After'all, a team which has three losses in three games against Notre Dame shouldn't be shootin' its mouth off about 
being the better team. But there's more. The other day I heard a story· 
about an Alabama football player who had tears in . and assume they'll dry their tears and climb down 
his eyes because he and his teammates were ashamed of the Tide's pitiful record against Notre Dame. 
"We wanna win this one for Coach Bryant," the player wailed. "He deserves it." 
Turn it off already! Bear Bryant's record at Alabama is 21 3-39-8 after 22Yz seasons. The old codger has gotten more than he deserves. And I from their soapboxes sometimes before Saturday's kickoff. Even so, I'm going with the Irish in this one because I think they're just as talented, just as experienced and much better prepared. Besides, if all else fails, remember the last line of The Little Blue Nun: 
"Alabama just had football players, 
But they called in You-Know-Who." 

Frank LaGrotta 

don't want to hear about how many national championships he's been cheated out of either. With some of the schedules Alabama has played the last few years, Bear is lucky the voters haven't done more than just make him third or fourth. He's lucky they haven't laughed in his face. 
However, to depart from this silly palaver and get to the matter at hand, the Irish and the Tide have a game to ·play on Saturday. Regardless of rankings and records (not The Little Blue Nun) it should be a very good football game to watch and a very tough football game to play in. And once it starts, none of this pregame dribble will mean a damn thing. 
And I think Notre Dame is going to win this football game. Why? 
Primarily because I think Alabama is too concerned with vindicating their past record and winning one for the Bear to realize that the Notre Dame players they will face on Saturday could care less about Sugar Bowls and Orange Bowls that took place when most of them were in grade 
school. It's sometimes refered to as being "over­psyched" or "psyched-out" and it's a problem that may beat Alabama before the Irish even get a 
chance. 

But I'll give Bear's boys the benefit of the doubt

Irish hopes rest UJith Paxson 
With UCLA a little more than two weeks away, Notre Dame basketball practice still has its lighter moments. To be sure, Digger Phelps barks about the Bruins at least two or three times during each session, but things are a little more relaxed. 
A handful of spectators watch as Phelps trades 
insults with a friend in the padded seats or Kelly 
Tripuc;ka adds his own bass solo to the music 
blaring from the tape deck during stretching 
exercises. Ifthings get too quiet, someone is quick 
to take a playful dig at one of the four freshmen on 
the squad. 
When the coaching staff begins to put the team through a variety ofdifferent drills-a multitude of offensiye and defensive sequences-things settle down a bit. 
And the people sitting in the padded seats sit back, staring idly toward the floor. Every once in a while, someone will comment on new assistant coach Pete Gillen, whose intensity during practice has to he seen to be believed. 
They talk about this being the year for Notre. Dame. If Digger Phelps can't bring home that elusive national championship this March, maybe he never will. After all, it's the last hurrah for seniors Tripucka, Orlando Woolridge, Tracy Jackson, Gilbert Salinas and Stan Wilcox. 
Their eyes are focused on Tripucka, muscling inside for a three-point play, or Woolridge, effortlessly sweeping the glass clear, orJackson, a portrait of intensity even during the rigors of practice. 
Maybe the attention will turn to the freshmen. CanJoe Kleine really do the job at center? Doesn't Tom Sluby remind you of Adrian Dantley? Cecil Rucker and Barry Spencer look pretty sharp, do you thir>k they'll play much? 
Hey, doesn't Billy Varner look good this year? I thought he was going to transfer. How about Tim Andree and Mike Mitchell, how soon will they be able to play? 
But if they sit there long enough, something else will occur to them. And all of a sudden, they'll realize that Notre Dame's chances for a national 
Craig

champipnship  , don't  hinge  on  Tripucka,  
Woolridge, or Jackson.  
They  don't  hinge  on  what  color  carnation  

Phelps wears when the Irish play Indiana, or if the Dancing Irish perforrp on any national TV games. N<?tre Dame's hopes for an outstanding season 
rest with John Paxson. 

This is not out of necessity, you must understand. Digger Phelps is far too wise to just throw the burden of an entire season on the shoulders of a sophomore. 
No, this is John Paxson's own doing. He finds himself in this predicament because he is so talented. 
The onlookers at Phelps' practice session rarely rave about Paxson. They'll sit back in their seats until a backdoor layup by Jackson or a fastbreak dunk by Woolridge captures their attention. 
The passes Paxson completes to get them the ball rarely capture anyone's notice. 
Which is all well and good. Phelps has his stars he has his thoroughbreds and he has his aircraf~ carriers. And all together, they wouldn't be worth a lump of coal without John Paxson. 
Every so often, a former player drops by. Even less frequently, a writer from a national magazine pays a visit to research a preseason preview. But they all say the same thing-John Paxson does it 
all. 

Make no mistake about it, Kelly Tripucka, Orlando Woolridge and Tracy Jackson are AI McGuire's thoroughbreds. But in McGuire's vernacular, Paxson is the head without which the 
body dies. · Just how welt the seniors do will be a function of how well and how often Paxsongets them the ball. And as far as those three are concerned, all that means is you ain't seen nothing yet!

The game will be the ftrst opportunity for Irish fans to see a women's basketball team that will make the jump from Division III to Division I play under their new program and ftrst year coach Mary DiStanis­lo. 
"I've been pleased with our progress so far this fall, at least for the most part,'' says DiStanislo. "Some days we look really good, and other days we're a little off. This is a young team, and they need some gane experience to work out some of those problems.''

DiStanislao has not yet decided 
just how she will split the team 
for the intrasquad contest. She 
does note that, once the divi­
sion is made, there will be no 
switching from team to team. 
The squads will remain the 
same throughout. 
"We open the regular sea­. son on November 22 in the 
ACC against South Dakota. 
This game will give us a

can concentrate on those areas

Both DiStanislao and Phelps 
point out that the/arne is for a
