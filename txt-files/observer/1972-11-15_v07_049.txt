HPC to~ settle hall fund allocations by next week 
by Jt>rry Bradley 
Starr Reporter 
Nine halls submitted their proposals for allocations from the Hall Life Fund last night at the Hall Presidents Council mPPting in St. Ed's Hall. Wednesday Pvening was established as the deadline for all submissions. The HPC hopes to have settled the hall allocations issue bpfore Thanksgiving vacation. 
Steve Jeselnick, executive coordinator of the HPC reported that the Food Service Advisory Committee is seeking HPC assistance to help provide for special Christmas banquet is scheduled for Dec. 13 and urged the Hall Presidents to initiate Pnthusiasm in their halls. There was no response from the Hall Presidents. 
Jeselnick also inquired if the halls would like to decorate the dining halls for the festive occasion. Again there was no response. 
Finally Jeselnick asked for volunteer Santa Clauses for a Dec. 14 cafeteria happening. The request was answered instantly by three hall presidents, in-eluding Tom "Animal" Cunningham who has two years experience in the trade. 
Terry Skeehan, co-president of Walsh Hall, asked the Hall Presidents if they would cooperate in a random sampling of ten students in their hall. The survey would find out student reactions to the possibility of renovating the L~Fortune Student Center. The Hall Presidents agreed unanimously. 

ThP Stay Hall Committee reported that it had been invited to the SLC Monday mPeting along with all of the members of the Council. 
Butch Ward, HPC chairman, also an­nounced that Dennis Etienne said that some of the COUP reports came out pretty good. Ward added, "I don't think we should be afraid to show them our books." 
Ward also encouraged the Hall Presidents to throw parties for the little kids in South Bend. Ward pointed out that there are many children's groups in the city that would appreciate a Christmas party. 
Fr. James Flannigan , the rector in Old College urged the Hall Presidents to discourage the students from taking part in any malicious snowballing incidents. 
A wine and cheese party for hall presidents and rectors was set up for Tuesday, Nov. 28.

Burrell, Giantonio 
offer differing view-s 
of huJnan sexuality 
by Michael Charles Starr Reporter 
Dr. Gerald Giantonio and Fr. David Burrell presented sharply 
differing views on premarital sex and contraception in an open
panel discussion last night. 
Before a gathering of about 150 people in Washington Hall, Giantonio. the psychologicst, argued for an openness and frankness in discussion of sex, saying that premarital sex was good if adequately appreciated by the two persons, and if accompanied by the use of contraceptives. 
Burrell, the theologian, never explicitly opposed premarital sex under any conditions, but he counseled restraint, so that the in­tercourse would not be "an ego trip." 
"Everything has its season," noted the Theology DepartmentChairman. 
Giantonio said that if, after discussion, the unmarried couple believes they are ready for sexual intercourse, contraception should be used. This, he said, makes the sex act more secure, and thus enhances its value. 
During the question and answer period immediately following the lectures, Burrell stated he disagreed with the use of con­traceptives, feeling that it cheapened the act of sexual intercourse. 
Giantonio began the lecture with his personal views on sexual intercourse. He said he feels that sex should not be hidden but rather sex should be a subject of general knowledgeability and discussion. Parents, according to Giantonio, have continually failed in their responsibility to educate their children. 
Giantonio stated, "I learned one day at a bowling alley with my friends that newly married couples do more at Niagara Falls than watch the water." 
The problem . he said, begins with premarital sexual in­tercourse when it is a result of pure emotion. Intercourse should occur only after the couple have completely discussed .:nd con­sidered the action. 
He stated, "Intercourse should not be an ego trip." 
Intercourse, he said, is an intimate expression, which must be handled carefully. There is a basic need or desire for intercourse, but this must be tempered. He did not state how long this need must be tempered . 
Neither Giantonio or Burrell focused on direct sexual solutions or problems at Notre Dame. Both said they believed sexual ac­tivity at Notre Dame is normal. Giantonio commented that about 30 percent of the campus is now sexually active. 
Their presentation began a series of lectures on human sexuality. 
The series has been coordinated by the Campus Ministry as a reflection on co-education at Notre Dame and was moderated by Student Life Council Chairman Fred Giuffrida.

Coed seniors dissatisfied , 
By Ann Therese Da1·in Cam(HIS Nt>ws Editor 

Although Sr. John Miriam Jones, assistant to the Provost, confirmed latP Monday evening that Notre DamP will mail St. Mary's seniors working for Notre Dame degrees dPfinite information on academic rPgulations and graduation by the <'nd of the week," deans, depart­mPnt chairmen and women students remain skeptical. 
After nearly a year with no information, not even formal acknowledgement from the University to the women that they would rec2ive Notre Dame 
degrees, Rev. Ferdinand Brown, associate provost, will send in­dividual letters containing the academic information to the 80 women affected later this week. 
St. Mary's academic vice­president Dr. William Hickey also plans to send the women a formal statement of the agreement reached with Notre Dame on their academic status soon. According to high level sources at St. Mary's' the meeting between Brown and Hickey. who negotiated the agreement, was prompted by Hickey, who had many questions which neither he nor Notre Dame department chairmen or deans 
.. Washington--The Pay Board, as expected, ordered payreductionsfor nearly 24,000 employees-of New York newspapers and 300 commercial printing companies. The board directed that payraisesof 11 per cent already in effect under existing contracts be trimmed to 8 per cent. At the same time, the price commission ordered the New York Times and theNl·wYork Daily News to scale back increases in advertising rates approved by the Commission earlier this year. 
Washington--Small towns that make a lucrative bu~iness of arresting and fining unwary motorists in speed traps may have that practice curtailed under a Supreme Court decision. The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for a mayor to sit as a judge in traffic cases and collect fines when the money represented a major part of villa~erevenue. The majority, in a 7 to 2 decision, said speeders and other traffic violators were entitled to a more "neutral and detached judge." 
Nt>w York--J. Patrick Gray III, acting director of ·the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said that he and Southern Airways officials had jointly decided to immobilize Southern's hijacked jet in Orlando, Fla., Saturday, but that he personally had ordered that it be done by shooting out the tires. Capt. J. J. O'Donnell, head of the nation's airline pilots complained in a letter to President Nixon that the tire­shooting violated a government agreement not to disable an airliner without the approval of its pilot. 
('Ould answer. 
BPcause hl' is meeting both today and tomorrow on promotions, Fr. Brown was unavailable for comment. 
If the information is publicized latPr this wl'ek, it will come just in timl' to help the group of women who plan to complete Notre Dame degree requirements by January. 
Rl'action to the plan in which St. Mary's seniors receiving Notre Dame degrees would reportedly transfer to Notre Dame shortly before May graduation and receive grade point averages calculated strictly on Notre Dame cour­work, is mixed. 
"Notrre Dame wanted girls so bad, but they don't really care about us," voiced Sue Oglesbee, government major. "And at St. Mary's they keep saying that they treat you like individuals. But with 
all of these couselors and only a few hundred kids to counsel, there is no reason why our case wasn't decided long before this." 
According to Oglesbee, the only communication she has received from Notre Dame since last spring has been material from the Placement Bureau, Notre Dame Magazine's October Issue, and a letter asking her as a Notre Dame student to give to the United Fund.

"I'm getting a little tired of getting information from St. Mary's and then hearing somPthing second hand about Notre Dame which is con­tradictory and then we get blamed for not having the answer. It's not our fault," she continued. "And vour advisors ... they don't have ;my information either. You don't have an advisor at St. Mary's and you might as well not have one at Notre Dame!"

1Board manual coming·~~~~~i~~i~~~~J£~ 
by Jim Ferry Starr Reporter 

"Student Judicial Board Manuals will be distributed to the Hall Judicial Board via the Hall Hf'ctors very soon now," according to N.D. Judicial Coordinator, Greg Smith. 
Thf' purpose of the manuals is to 
"givf'  some  direction  to  the  
disciplinary  system  at  Notre  
Damf'."  

Each hall at Notre Dame has its own Judicial Board which is made up of students, who in the words of thf' manual, are "selected by hall members". 
"The primary concern of the board is to assure an atmosphere conducive to the individual's academic. social, and religious growth. Operative toward these goals is the philosophy of concern: students working together," reads

Robbers brecEk in SU ticket of:fice 
by Pamela Gavelda Starr Heporter 

A robbery Nov. 10 cost the 
Student Union over $200 in change 
and money from ticket sales. A 
check for $1500 was also taken, but 
fortunately it was cancelled in 
time after the robbery. 
The Student Union did not 
release news of the robbery until 
now because they were clilecking 
out some leads. 
Large sums of money are not 
usually kept in the Student Union 
offices. The money was taken 
from a desk during office hours, 
and the door was not locked. 
Jim Schneid of the Student Union 
said that they had narrowed the 
time of the theft to a 15-20 minute 
period between three and four 
o'clock that afternoon. 
At the time this was wriUen, the 
Security Dept. had not been 
notified and knew nothing about 
the robbery, according to Security 
Director Arthur Pears. 
As a precautionary measure to 
prevent future thefts, Student 
Union will not keep money or 
checks in their offices.

250 ND students apply for summer 
job placement 
by Jim Gresser Staff Reporter 

Two hundred and fifty ap­plications signify the "great success" of the Summer Job Placement program, according to Jim Clarke, Student Government Research and development Commissioner. 
Under this program, any student 

can fill out an application for a 
summer job and the Student 
Government and the University 
Alumni Office will assist in ob­
taining the employment. The 
deadline for applications is this 
W Pdnesday, Nov. 15. Applications 
may be obtained in the Placement 
Bureau in room 222 of the Ad­
ministration Building.
A Student Government com­

mittee will sort the applications 
according to job interest and 
geographical location on Thur­
sday. The applications will then be 
presented to Mr. Jim Cooney of the 
Alumni Office. Cooney will then go 
to different regions of the country 
and try to find jobs for the 
students. 
Clarke said that "most students 

are showing a definite need for 
jobs." 
Clarke also spoke on the 

possibility of continuing the 
program in future years. "So far it 
has been a great success. The 
prospects for continuing the 
program look exceptionally good."

Wednesday, November 15, 1972 Page 4 

DutantheVVeekend Emily Post at the Hockey Game 
bab hil)l)ins 

With the ensuing close of the 1972 football season, Notre Dame's great number of genuine sports mthusiasts and also those who take a more passing interest can begin to turn their attention toward the outstanding winter sports program provided by the Midwestern Clearinghouse of Athletics. 
Notre Dame's "other" winter sport, hockey, which is threatening to make basketball secondary, already has begun its exciting season. 
Now I do not purport to claim any expertise in this sport, however my knowledge is by no means limited. Having been a fan for twelve years and an active participant in hockey in my high school days, I feel I may be able to provide a service for those not so well acquainted with the game. 
For, just as concerts and bars and football games and movies have their own rules of "etiquette" so too, the greatest of all sports, hockey, has rules to be folowed by the lady and the gentleman. 
My first bit of advice, and the single most im­portant piece, is to completely disregard ~ny behavior patterns displayed by the fans attendmg games one may have seen on television. If this presents a problem, the N.D. hockey fan should repeat to himself as often as is necesssary, "The fans on television are professional hockey fans, I am an amateur hockey fan ... " 
Keeping that in mind we shall proceed with the remainder of the rules. As is the case in all other Notre Dame social events, the "in-tune" guy and gal will be sure to arrive late for the game. Do not allow the fact that the games always start on time to interfere with this essential aspect of the enjoyment of the game. Also, disregared any snide c~11_1ments directed at you by irate spectators whose v1s1on you have impaired on the way to your seats. . . 
Now that the couple is comfortably settled m theU' seats and he has removed the interhall tennis jacket that he borrowed from his roommate, they are ready to settle back and enjoy the second period. 
Hockey is a complex game which requires 

knowledge of a few basic terms in order for the fan 
to understand the game. 
First Goal, 1. The area into which a player at­tempts 'to propel the puck in order to score. 2. The act of scoring itself. 
Now whereas in most hockey circles a home team player is cheered when he accomplishes the very difficult task of scoring a goal, Notre Dame fans seem to have a different outlook. Instead of applauding the effort of the Irish player that has scored, the chic approach is to ridicule the op­position goaltender <player responsible for the prevention of opposition goals) for his lack. of superhuman ability to prevent the goa} f~m bemg scored. This is done by a repeated recitation of the word "sieve." Sieve <the opponent's goaltender). 
Should you be so unwise as to regard the goal 

scored as unavoidable because of the superior play 
on the part of the Notre Dame player you will be 
considered an outcast by the rest of your fellow 
hockey enthusiasts. Remember the following 
universal truth: "All Notre Dame goals are scored 
because the opponent's goaltender in a complete 
idiot who donned his first pair of skates this week. 
There is a good chance that his blades are double­
runners." 
Now, once a goal has been scored, true and loyal 

Notre Dame fans will litter the ice with any and all forms of waste. Hot dogs are conveniently provided by the ACC for this purpose, however should you choose to toss other mementos, such as a sieve, it is suggested that you bring these with you. This is probably the most important aspect of the rules as far as impressing a date i;;; concerned. 
While littering the ice, be sure to disregard the repeated public address reqeusts to refrain from doing so. Also never let it enter your mind that a New York Ranger <Rod Gilbert if my memory serves me correctly) once was lost for a season and required extremely serious spine surgery to remove and fuse a disc, slipped while skating at a high speed over something thrown onto the ice by an over zealous fan. 
Regardless of the extent of one's knowledge of the game, there will be times when a rule violation is called that is not immediately comprehendable. Here etiquette requires one to turn to the person next to him and repeat in unison, "That ref is un­velievable, I don't know where they get officials like this for collegiate hockey." 
Lest we not stagnate our enjoyment of the hockey game, I would humbly suggest a few new actions to enhance our appreciation of the sport. Harassing opposition players in the penalty box is always fun but we need a new twist.. Even banging on the gllass until the player turns around and then flashing obscene signs at him from behind the protection of the plexiglass has gone out of style. I would submit that someone should throw a skunk into the penalty box with the opposition player, forcing him to vacate the box before his time is served and then leaving the official with no choice except to penalize him again for not completely serving his first penalty. 
Secondly, in the true spirit of ridiculing the op­position, I would suggest that loyal fans should litter the ice with crutches upon the injury of an opponent. 
Shouts of "Take him out and shoot him," could accompany this display. 
Perhaps the best suggestion is to develop a new cheer. Since we are accustomed to shoulting "sieve" upon the scoring of a goal, perhaps, if an opponent gets cut (a common occurance in hockey) we could take up the chant of "he-he-hemophiliac." 
But seriously speaking, hockey coach "Lefty" Smith feels that, "too many serious accidents can be caused by littering the ice." He spoke to me of a friend "who almost became a one-armed man because of something someone had thrown on the ice." 
Neither does he care for ridiculing the opposition. "I would much rathersee,"he says, "the students cheer like mad for us and disregard the opposition." 
He hastens to add that he is "delighted with the student enthusiasm this year." 
So are a lot of us who love the game, Lefty, but sometimes we are ashamed by the antics of our well-meaning fellow students. I realize that fan reaction in other cities is no better than what we have shown but don't feel that is a legitimate ex­cuse. Hockey is definitely on its way at Notre Dame, let's not thwart its progress by the antics of ignorant fans. Display the same class shown on the ice by the Irish players in your behavior in the stands. The coach, the players and everyone who loves hockey will appreciate it.

The Roman Striders 

ann mccarry 
HonH', Italy--Tall cypress trees picket the western sky. On the left 

rises the Palatine Hill, the Roman Forum majestically illuminated 
against the night sky. Under foot ancient gravel crunches as a small 
group of athletes circle the amphitheater where Ben Hur once raced 
his chariot. 
Little did Bob Kelly know, upon founding the Farley Striders two 

years ago, that one day his road runners would stride in the C'ircu~ 
Maximus. Today, however, a dedicated group of the student b.ody IS 
perpetuating the Strider traditi~n. in Rome. Do~ Wic~, an. ~r1gmal 
Strider, began this Roman. tradition when he Willed h1s official road 
runner t-shirt to an old man he met in Saint Peter's one day. 
"There was a Rome extension last year and we wanted to continue 

it, "explained Roman Strider president, Stephano Waymel. "Bein~ a 
true blue Farley Strider, I got together last vear with a bunch of k1ds 
who were coming over," Stephano continued, "and we decided to keep 
up the club's international membership." 
20 Members of Roman Striders 
Strider secretary Patty Dunn reports a membership of ap­

proximately twenty students and faculty members. Three-fourths ~f 
this number usually show up for the bi-weekly runs. Rumor has 1t 
that there are a greater number of female striders in Rome than there 
were male Striders at Farley last year. Both Stephano and Patty 
refused to comment on this report, but agreed it might be due to the 
over-abundance of pasta in the Italian diet which makes weight 
reduction nearly impossible. 
"I think the running spirit here is great!" said Patty. "The looks, 

stares, andbewilderedexpressions on the faces of the Romans make it 
much more fun and a lot more interesting and worth while.'' 
Fun Starts at Tiziano 
The fun starts in front of the Hotel Tiziano, located on one of Rome's 

busiest streets, with a warm-up round of calisthenics at ten o'clock 
sharp. Passing motorists gape as the Striders run through jumping 
jacks, windmills and push-ups. Others stand and stare as the group 
dashes off into the Roman night headed for the Pantheon, the 
Colosseum or the Trevi Fountain. En route, the Italian reaction 
varies. from the shaking heads of the old men selling roasted chesnuts 
on the street corners to the children's shouts of "Presto! Presto! 
<Faster! Faster!") . Some ask if the club is in training for the next 

Olympic games. A few mutter obscenities. 
A major decision involves the destination of the troop: across 

the Tiber to the Vatican? ... under the arch of Constantine? ... around 
Trajan's column? Many prefer that each run feat~re a n~w route .as it 
is the only time they can afford to take out of their studies fm sight­
seeing. 
The Farley Striders are also always trying to inl<'rest new 

people in their growing organization. By stressing the arguments 
for physical fitness, stimulation and social mjoym<'nl, the en­
thusiastic group has been rewarded with a large and loyal following.

A very busy week of days and nights for the Jesus people 
by Joseph Abell Managing Editor 
Stt·ond in a S('J'ies 

A group of tired, hungry evangelists came into the small hamburger stand. The "Great Golden Arches" were ignored in the haste for good and drink, and once received. the group sat down and prayed over the meal. 
A man. having gone back for seconds for his wife, watched these proceedings with mild curiosity. Finally, he walked over and, spotting the friendly "Hi, y'all!" badges over their left breasts, asked who the group was. He was invited to join them for a few minutes as they explained Explo and Jesus Christ. 
A member of the Explo group later told the story: "We had only told him the glory of the Lord for a few minutes. and he received Christ and he committed his life to Jesus right there in the middle of the restaurant!" 
Explo '72 -a week-long, intensive training session for young evangelists. A big week for Campus Crusade for Christ, sponsor of the 75,00-delegate convention, and especially a big week for Jesus Christ in the city of Dallas. The days were spent in meetings of both sermonizing and instruction in the arts of evangelizing, especially taking the form of "witnessing" to the citizens of Dallas. The nights were something else. 
After dinner came the big extravaganza: the Cotton Bowl meetings. At 7:00, all 75,000 delegates gathered at the famous stadium to hear speakers such as Bill Bright and Billy Graham . Mass singing, clapping and cheering accompanied the inspiration messages, after which the delegates wre invited to visit various exhibition booths set up in other buildings at Fair Park.

And finally, on Saturday, the massive Jesus Music Festival held on the deserted construction site of the Woodall Rogers Freeway. For some four-five hours, Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, Love Song and The New Folk sang praises to Jesus and lead the crowd, estimated at over 150,000 people, in song-fests, clap­ping and praying. Speeches from Bright and Graham highlighted the occasion, which brought Jesus People from most of north Texas and parts of Arkansas and Oklahoma. 
"I saw one kid kinda perched on top of a No Parking 
sign. I guess he just wanted to hear Kris Kristofferson 
better. I yelled to him to come on down before he hurt 
himself, and besides wasn't he uncomfortable? He 
yelled back that Jesus wouldn't let him get hurt, and he 
was doing his part of the bargain by being un­
comfortable." 
The delegates adhered to the schedule of Explo '72, if only because there would have been little else to do if they did not attend the meetings. For the most part, they seemed to be content to just spend the week witnessing the Word. Few employees of motels, restaurants and at Fair Park were spared the earnest attempts of delegates, and many were approached several times per hour. The delegates had come with a

'72. 

mission, and that was to take God's Word to the entire world. And Dallas was their training ground. 
A curious aspect of the happening was the emphasis on the Campus Crusade philosophy. Campus Crusade literature, records, tapes, and paraphenalia, including everything from Four Law packages-of-ten to Jesus buttons, bumper stickers and gloves, abounded everywhere. Outside each meeting hall was a lobby crammed with stands and booths selling materials to "take Explo training home." Reminiscient of the merchants in the Temple, Campus Crusade pulled in hundreds of dollars a day. · 
The seminars were solely based on Brights' teachings. The delegates were given specific in­structions on how to share the Four Laws and help someone receive Christ into their life. Bill Bright's face beamed from thousands of pamphlets and he was quoted daily by delegates. 
Newspaper reports told of many incidents of discrimination of other groups at the Explo meetings. Both the Pentecostal Student Fellowship International and the Children of God sects charged Explo officials of barring their groups because they did not agree with Campus Crusade ideology. 
The Cotton Bowl crowd was large this night, but not rowdy; indeed, they were never anything. but cooperative and polite to everyone. Various groups were singing or quietly chanting and praying, all waiting for the activities to begin. 
The ten delegates chose this moment as the best possible one to urge the con ventton to ertdorse dn anti­war stand. They unfurled a large banner reading "Stop the war, in the name of Jesus." 
After no one looked their way for fifteen minutes, they took down the banner and put it away. 
But despite this emphasis on a single philosophy, the delegates were of every creed imaginable. Catholics, Methodists, Episcopalians, Lutherans, even a group called Jews for Jesus, mixed with one another in a huge, unprejudiced, undiscriminating melting pot. 

Once again, the theme of "Jesus--One Way" and the upraised index finger provided a basis for unity. Bibles were carried often and a few times were heard arguments, calm and collected, concerning a certain passage. Oftentimes an impromptu class would be held with one delegate telling others of his religion's interpretation. And always were found isolated delegates quietly and seriously in a corner studying an important verse. 
The future was planned also, as the end of the week neared. Books and flyers were passed out and discussions were held on "Operation Penetration," a follow-up program to Explo. Each delegate was to take his training and experience at Explo back to his own city and continue the witnessing he began in Dallas. The delegates were also challenged to en­courage five people each to take part in training in Campus Crusade evangelism offered around the country and those five would find five more so that an "ever-widening circle" of people would become "ef­fective witnesses for Christ," eventually evangelizing 

-
the entire world by 1980. Materials were also provided for the delegates, such as numerous sets of slides and charts for presentation to church groups and tapes of Bill Bright discussing his program for instruction in the Campus Crusade method. Great volumes of literature were also passed on to the delegates to pass on to prospective witnesses, including a schedule check-list for each delegate's personal ministry. 
Explo '72 was an incredibly risky gamble. The Campus Crusade organization did what they could as far as arrangements were concerned and literally prayed for luck on the rest. And it seems that that prayer was heard, for the convention came off with only minor problems. The great masses of people cooperated to the utmost, expressing their feelings through their "acts of Christian love" and sacrifice. Their enthusiasm, kindness, and orderliness prompted congratualatory editorials from both major Dallas newspapers and complimentary comments from Dallas officials and citizenry. 
Whether or not the Campus Crusade future plans will pan out is unknowable, as it depends upon the in­dividual delegates, rather than the group as a whole. Plans have been set for a second Explo in 1974 in Korea, and other projects in relation to Explo '72 are being planned across the country. But all that is in the future. 
Explo '72 happened last summer in Dallas. 75,000 young evangelists aren't likely to forget it. Neither will Dallas. 
The young janitor walked away from the man slowly. 
He had listened to him, had thanked him and flad ac­
cepted the literature offered. He was still "un­
converted;" much patient listening to other Explo 
delegates had hardened him to that. But one thought 
kept passing in and out of his brain: " ... I've been 
praying for you ... " 
His feelings were strong then. Not strong enough to 
commit his life to Christ, to spread the word of Jesus 
through Bill Bright's means, to even "receive" Christ 
into his soul; just strong enough to impress him. 
Tomorrow: Another big evangelistic,push coming up: Key 73 is the most ambitious effort yet and needs no less than cooperation of nearly all churches, Protestant and Catholic. Also: What does all this emphasis on evangelism, Jesus Christ and youth add up to? Is it just a giant revival? Or is it a great general conversion? Three church and secular spokesmen give their views of the Jesus Revolution.

Little BirJ Screen 
Patton coming to TV Sunday 



art frranti 
The weekend presents a war llick that ranks in the annals of great movie making. Patton marches onto the tube with all its grandeur and spectacle Sunday at 
8:00 on 28 for 3/2 hours. This 1970 film took just about every Academy Award it had been nominated for, including best picture and best actor for Scott (who, for those with short memories, refused it. It stands in the Patton museum in Texas). 
This film presents the most £>compassing biography of the 
g£>neral. Scott absorbed reels of 
true footage and returned them 

t worn out due to his running them 
t 
so many times to get down all the mannerisms of the general. 
 
Witness, for example, his opening speech. watch the walk, and listen 
to the delivery. That is not Scott, 

I 
~ that is Patton. The only thing Scott could not do was to emulate the general's high pitched voice. So he "gravelled" his instead. The £>ffect is the same, if not better. As l informed you a few weeks ago the 
general's language will not be censored. 

It took George Patton five years to graduate from West Point but he later was named the most daring 
periment  that must be reviewed  
this  year  by  the SMC Board of  
Regents.  


SMC freslunen W"ant self-responsible hows 
by Marty Miller Staff Rt>porter· 
St. Mary's Freshman Kay Thomas has organized the Com­mittee for Self-Responsible Hours to answer the question of hours for second-semester freshman. 
The decision to lift mandatory hours last year was an ex­
"I think we'll be mature and well-adjusted enough to decide when we should be back at our dorm," declared Thomas, chairman of the committee. 
The committee has distributed evaluation questionnaires to 277 returning sophomores who maintained self responsible hours in the experiment last year. To date, 138 of the questionnaires have been compiled and 87 percent feel that having no hours made them more independent and self responsible by making them en­force their own curfew. 
"We need at least a 90 percent turn out of the surveys," said Thomas. The results of the success of last year's experiment in self­responsible hours will be presented to the Student Life executive committee of the Board of Regents, on January 10. 
If passed, Sr. Ellen Delores, chairman of the Student Life committee, will present the question with recommendations, to the full Board of Regents meeting army commander in American mili'tary history along with Stonewall Jackson. He exploded across Africa with the Fifth Army and defeated Rommel. He was later disgraced for slapping a G.I. After a-formal apology he received the Third Army and wreaked havoc with the German Army in France. He liberated 12,000 cities and towns, inflicted a million and a half casualties, and claimed that if he had not been halted by his superiors he could have captured B('rlin ten days before the Russians. He loved the battle and with no war to fight, he died in an auto accident December 20, 1945. To quote Scott as he walks off by the windmills (a Ia Don Quixote) " ... all glory is fleeting." 

The battle scenes are magnificent in scope and spec­tacle, Patton looms out in his beginning speech in front of the flag. However, the television screen may not be able to ac­comodate the majesty of the film To alleviate this, try to watch it in color and completely and vicariously experience the film. Only then will the power of the film break through the confines of the little screen. So lay your books aside, sit down, and enjoy Patton. 
in early February. 
"We don't expect any problems of it being passed, but then, we don't sit on the Board," said Miss Cathy Mulaney, St. Mary's Dean of Students. · 
'I'm in favor of self-responsible hours for second semester. I think they are valuable in helping the first semester freshman adjust to college life," Mulaney stated. "But by second semester I think they should exercise upperclass privileges, with parental consent," she added, "and last year 90 percent did get parental ap­proval." 
Other statistics have been compiled concerning the success of the experiemnt of self-responsible hours. St. Mary's Health Service reported that the general health of the freshman class improved second semester oflast year. "The grade-point did drop some, but that could have been caused by the un­merger," said Thomas. 
Dr. Martucci, psychologist and Director of Counseling Services at St. Mary's, reported that the no­hours policy did not seem to cause any special guidance needs. 
Denise Hagarty, assistant chairman of the Committee for Self-Responsible Hours, argued that many of the freshman didn't know that last year's self responsible hours was only an experiment. "We assumed that we'd be given the same privileges as last year's freshmen."

"I don't even have any records for the women that I am supposed to be recommending for degrees. I thought that we had an agreement that I was supposed to get them or at least receive copies. But, I was told that the records had to stay over there even though the girls had to fulfill Notre Dame degree requirements,"' · he :said '. 
To illustrate the lack of. organization which envelopes the situation, Brinkley cited the degree eligibility list. Emanated from Hickey's office at SMC the lists did not contain a lot of names. which we knew were eligible, He (Hickey) said this list was ac-I ceptable by Fr. Burtchaell. They were so absolute about the deadline for submitting names for Pligibility and then they were so lax in emitting names," he recalled. 
"I try hard to find information out for the girls, but no one here knows anything. We don't get any information from a higher level," he asserted. While Brinkley is responsible for a large group of I women petitioning the university for degrees (18), other advisers' concur with his analysis of the situation. 
"I don't ever recall getting any official statement about the senior girls," commented Ronald Weber, American Studies department chairman, to six St. Mary's seniors. "Really the students have told me more information than the administration. They seem to have more information than me. When I am asked questions by the girls, I just have to reply 'I don't know.' what degree requirements' they must fulfill, where they are getting their degrees, whether they can take courses. I assume so. But, I just don't know."

Boards are inadequate." 
He cited both Alumni and Morrissey as having "very good" Judicial Boards. 
"The Manual would help the Halls without an adequate Board. It would help them to sit down and decide exactly what's to be done." 
Smith said that there "aren't a great number of cases brought to the Hall Boards." 
"None of the Boards actively police the Hall. Each has its own mind and direction." 
"Everyone benefits from a good judicial system in the sense that it provides the students with a stronger voice when going to the administration with proposals such as co-educational and academic and residence halls." 
Smith also cited the Trustees complaint concerning parietal hours when he stated, "Their greatest reason for the re­
('mphasis of parietal hours was the lack of a good judicial system within the halls." 
"In this way, the judicial system takes on a very real presence and concern with each individual student in that it may radically affect his own lifest~le."

even sure how many SMC seniors would receive ND psychology degrees or whether they would be responsible for a comprehensive exam or senior thesis. ·At St. Mary's, a comprehensive is required for graduation. At Notre Dame. it is not. 
Many of the chairmen coun­seling St. Mary's-Notre Dame half­breeds refer them to Assistant Dean of the Arts and Letters College Richard J. Thompson. Earlier this semester, his office caused slight pandemoniun by countering a St. Mary's sup­position: women woule follow St. Mary's degree requirements even though they were getting Notre Dame degrees, according to Thompson, St. Mary's women receiving Notre Dame degrees would follow Notre Dame degree requirements. This switch meant the women only needed 120 hours to graduate, instead of 128. 
St. Mary's official position on 
the situation is that since the 
women will receive Notre Dame 
degrees, it is the university's 
responsibility to provide in­
formation and decisions. "We thought," claimed Hickey, "that the women would follow St. Mary's degree' requirements, St. Mary's core requirements (specific classes for a degree) and Notre Dame department requirements. But, this is something we assumed. 
Apparently, according to Notre 
Dame, this is not to be the cas3." 
"Nobody has made an attempt 
to make anything clear,"com­plained Patty Perkevich, American Studies senior. " It seems to me that St. Mary's doesn't care too much about us and Notre Dame doesn't want to go .out. of its way to clear the thing up. I feel kind of left out of both places. I guess in the end all that matters is that we get a degree."
