In Brief 

Bridget McGuire's sign was stolen late Saturday night, said Teresa Bauer, the bar's president. The sign, more than 12 feet across, served as the logo for "Bridget McGuire's Filling Station" at the intersection of Eddy Street and South Bend Avenue. Bauer, a Saint Mary's alumna, said she felt the sign must have been taken by "Notre Dame or Saint Mary's students because they're our main customers." The sign's disappearance is "amaz­ing because it's so big," she said, adding that the building will be redone over the summer. "It's pretty expensive and time consuming to make (the sign) and paint it," said Bauer. -The Observer

ND Senate, task force members discuss report! 
By JENNIFER GRONER News Staff 
Notre Dame Student Senators held a question-and­answer session with members of the task forces on residen­tiality and alcohol, while Senator Thomas Rask pre­sented a proposal to postpone enforcement of a bylaw during the senate meeting Monday night. 
The senate members spoke with Ann Firth, director of res­ident life and member of the task force on residentiality, and Steve Newton, coordinator of special projects at the Center for Social Concerns and mem­ber of the task force on alcohol, at the senate meeting Monday night. 
The-question-and-answer session was modeled after those sessions held in residence halls, according to Tom Doyle, student body president. 
The senate will debate the is­sues raised in the report and give their reaction at the next meeting, said Doyle. 
Rask, District 4 senator, pro­posed to postpone enforcement of Article II, Section VI, num­ber seven in the "Bylaws of the Undergraduate Constitution of the Student Government of the University of Notre Dame." 

The bylaw states: "Member­ship fees are required for all non-service organizations before they are eligible to receive student activity fun­ding." 
Many organizations were not aware of this new bylaw in time 
to implement dues before this year's budget considerations, according to Rask. The postponment would allow these organizations to wait until the 1988-89 academic year to col­lect membership fees without jeopardizing their funding, he said. 
The bylaw was passed by the previous senate to insure that organizations give an accurate count of their membership before they are given funding, Rask said.

Pro-choice coalition seeks to strip Roman Catholic Church of its tax-exempt status 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON The Roman Catholic Church's tax­exempt status gives it an unfair advantage in the political bat­tle over abortion rights, the Su­preme Court was told Monday. 
The court was urged by a "pro-choice" coalition to keep alive an 8-year-old lawsuit that seeks to strip the church of its tax exemption because of its anti·abortion lobbying. 
The suit is against the federal government, not the church. 
The justices are being asked to decide whether the suit can go forward --not whether the church's tax exemption should be revoked. A decision is ex­pected to be announced by July. 
If the suit against the govern­ment is kept alive, the church faces $100,000 a day in fines for its refusal to surrender docu­ments sought by those suing . 
Marshall Beil, a lawyer for

pro-choice groups and individ­uals, said being free from paying taxes is a form of gov­ernment subsidy that "is skewing the political process" in the national debate over abortion. 
Only the courts "can create a remedy," he said. "The poli­tical process can't." 
Church officials and the Reagan administration urged the court to kill the lawsuit. 
Permitting such legal claims could "expose the government to untold suits by people inter­ested but not affected by the outcome" of federal regula­tion, said Justice Department lawyer Alan Horowitz. 
Several justices hinted that the case could be sent back to a federal appeals court for clarification of that court's views on the pro-choice coali­tion's legal standing to sue the government. 
Justice Byron White, in raising that possibility, said, 
"It  would  save  us  a  lot  of  
work."  
Chief  Justice  William  

Rehnquist suggested that the case is in "sort of a twilight zone" because the 2nd U.S. Cir­cuit Court of Appeals did not state clearly whether it believed the pro-choice coali­tion has the proper legal stand­ing to sue. 
The appeals court said last June that "there is at least a colorable basis for standing."

SMC Board prepares for elections 

8·00·· 
By JULIE RYAN 
News Staff 
Saint Mary's hall elections 
were the main focus of discus­
sion at the Board of Gover­
nance meeting Monday night. 
Hall elections will be held today, during meal hours, ac­cording to Julie Parrish, stu­dent body president. 
The location has been 
changed to downstairs, in front 
of the president's dining room 
on the LeMans side of the 
dining hall, said Parrish. 
The change will avoid the confusion of previous elections, when people were entering and leaving the dining hall in the same place where the voting was being done, she said. 
Parrish read the newly revised election rules from the student government handbook to the new members of the board. 
Parrish said a photo ID must be shown to receive a ballot, all ballots must be initialed on the back or they will be invalid, and all ballots must be put in the ballot box by the person who is voting. 
Each group running for of­fice may have a representative 

which satisfied the majority will. 
"The public, largely through Congress, made it clear that so­cial programs must remain in­tact," said Palmer. "Most of Reagan's ideology comes from our American heritage, and it's up to students to weigh the pros and cons of this credo." 
Palmer then turned to the changing welfare situation in America, and Reagan's cuts in the upper and lower tier social programs. "These changes mark a substantial shift in federal government, a de­evolution from federal to state government," said Palmer. 
Palmer described the prob­lems of an enormous national deficit coupled with the deterioration of government of­ficials since the 1970s. One of the difficulties, according to Palmer, is the fact that the American government refuses to deal with many of these long­
range problems. 
"The problem stems from the deterioration of public dialogue," said Palmer. "We're not talking about these problems as we need to." 
"There is a serious conflict in some basic values of societv which must be resolved," h~ said. "The public must be ed­ucated in order to realize the significance of these problems, and strive toward long term goals.

The board discussed whether the raw number of votes should

percentage of votes.

Demjanjuk convicted of Nazi war crimes 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM --Retired Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk was convicted Monday of Nazi war crimes by an Israeli court that said there was no doubt he was "Ivan the Terrible," a death camp guard who ran gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews. 
The three-judge court con­victed Demjanjuk of the four counts against him: war crimes, crimes against the Jewish people, crimes against humanity and crimes against persecuted people. 
Demjanjuk, 68, listened to the guilty verdict from a cot in a cell next to the courtroom. Six police officers had carried him there feet first after he said he was unable to sit down because of a back injury. 
He was the second person to be convicted of war crimes in Israel. Adolf Eichmann, archi­tect of Adolf Hitler's "Final So-

P.O. Box Q
Task Force needs student input 
The release of the four task force reports two weeks ago has left many students confused. Whether because of apathy or in­timidation at the sheer size of the reports, many are waiting to see what becomes of them. This is a mistake. 
Students must make their opinions heard now if they wish to have any effect on policy decisions. 
University President Father Edward Malloy has explicitly asked for input to aid in assessing the recommendations, stating in the letter accompanying the reports, "In determining priorities, we should be grateful for your reactions." 
The timing of the reports' release seems rather poor, as stu­dents are busy with end of the year activities. Regardless, they have been released now, and now is not the time for apathy. Recommendations may very well become actual changes by next fall, as happened with the Committee on the Responsible Use of Alcohol in 1984. Students responded then by storming the Administration Building and holding mass rallies. Amidst their rage, no articulate response was formulated by these students and, as a result, the administration adopted policy changes with­out the help of significant student input. 
Again student input has been requested, and the time for such input is now. A unified student opinion is not necessary; better a disjointed opinion than no opinion at all. 
Many vehicles exist by which students can express their ideas and concerns, and all should be used to their fullest. Malloy himself requested input in the form of letters, asking students to "direct your comments to the person to whom the report was made"--namely Malloy, Provost Timothy O'Meara, and Father David Tyson, vice president for student affairs. Such an offer should not go unheeded. 
Student government has assembled and distributed a ques­tionnaire in an effort to solicit opinions. Granted, the form allows primarily for only yes1lo responses, but a large response by students in terms of sheer numbers would send a clear signal of student concern. 
Forums have been assembled in the dorms to initiate student response. These forums continue through Thursday, and they provide an excellent chance to speak out. 
These Task Force reports address four crucial areas of Uni­versity life, and their effects will undoubtedly be felt by students in the coming school year. The administration has requested student response; the time to act is now. To remain silent would 

eliminate  the  only opportunity students  have  to  affect  the  
reports' final impact.

The Observer is the independent newspaper published by the students of the University of Notre Dame du Lac and Saint Mary's College. It does not necessarily reflect the policies of the administration of either institution. The news is reported as accurately and objectively as possible. Unsigned editorials represent the opinion of the majority of the Editorial Board. Commentaries, letters and the Inside Column present the views of their authors. Column space is available to all members of the community and the free expression of varying opinions on campus. through letters, is encouraged. 
Mr. Stanford: for a worthy cause 
Dear Editor: 
We would like to thank all those who helped out with the 1988 Mr. Stanford Contest, especially Washington Hall Manager Tom Barkus, and Dr. Emil Hofman, who videotaped the event. This was the sixth consecutive year that we have held the competition, and it was the best and biggest so far in the history of the contest. The first Mr. Stanford Contest was held in the base­ment of our dorm; however, the fact that we can now sell out Washington Hall lends some credibility to the fact that the Mr. Stanford Contest is not just a dorm event, but now a campus event as well. This year we were able to raise about $700 which will benefit the Hope Mission Homeless Shelter. The proceeds going to the Hope Mission will be used to purchase various items which they have requested. 
We would like to thank The Observer for covering the event for the first time ever. Unfortunately, we at Stanford feel that Mary Berger's article "Stanford Contest Entertaining but Lacks Taste" of Apr. 11 was not a fair review of what we think was a worthy fundraiser for a local charity. We acknowledge that there were a few rough spots as well as one or two isolated incidents during which things may have seemed "off­color." However, these parts were not more crude than some things said during other campus events. Neverthe­less, Berger seems to have judged the entire contest solely on these few inci­dents. The rest of the contest was taste­ful, funny and exciting, and we have heard nothing but positive comments from numerous people who were in the audience. 
We feel that Mr. Stanford accom­plished two main goals: we were able to raise a sizable amount of money for the homeless shelter, and we provided a different sort of entertainment to over 600 people. We at Stanford feel that we are speaking with the majority when we say that the 1988 Mr. Stanford Con­test was not just "locker room talk" but a huge success.

Flaws corrected in SMC elections 
Dear Editor: 
As student body president, I am con­cerned about the recent attack on the integrity and honor of Saint Mary's stu­dent government which appeared in The Observer on Tuesday, April 12. It is unfortunate I have to address such an arduous accusation at the beginning of a new term, however, I also feel clarification and redemption is needed here. 
Saint Mary's student government fundamentally supports student in­volvement, inquisition and input. Un­fortunately, this is an ideal and, like most democracies, is limited without voluntary outside participation. Stu­dent government leaders are therefore entrusted by the student body to act in accordance with students' beliefs. It is both parties' responsibilities to com­municate any discrepancies in such beliefs, ideas or views. 
Student government is not a flawless organization and has never claimed to be one. There were flaws in the election procedure that were not apparent before the narrow three ticket student body election for 1988-89. These flaws, however, did not obstruct the running of a fair and impartial race. The flaws were in election procedure, not struc­ture, and therefore did not affect the end results of the election. 
These procedural flaws did not make student government a mockery, nor were they an embarassment to student government. They were an oversight to the expanding participation and aware­ness in student government and its' elections. 
Now that the flaws in the system have 
been addressed and corrected 
democratically, I hope the interest in 
student government remains as hall 
elections approach this week on Tues­
day, April 19. I encourage all of you to go out and vote for those student gov­ernment leaders who will represent you within the next year.

Graham admits his lack of 
scrambling ability has hurt 
him, especially since the graduation of four starting linemen has left the offensive protection sporadic. 

"Decreasing the sack is one of the major things I've got to work on," said Graham. "I have to work on getting rid of the ball and not putting the team in a situation of second­and-long. We have been switch­ing guys around a lot on the offensive line, and there have been some missed assign­ments, but that's the aspect I needed to work on." 
Rice, meanwhile, has shown

enough in the passing depart­ment to keep Graham with the second unit. Although his num­bers on the spring often have been less than sensational, such as a recent 6-of-20 perfor­mance in one scrimmage, Irish coaches have been pleased with his mechanics and decision-making when throw­ing the ball. 
"People can look at the stats, but what counts is what's put on the board,'' said Cordelli. ''A quarterback is like a doctor. He's got to make decisions when there's not a whole lot of time to make them. The guy who can make those decisions, move the football team, and be a leader, is who you want. Tony's improved his passing this spring and been the most consistent moving the team." 

Although he admits he still needs practice timing his passes, Rice says he feels satisfied overall with his per­formance. He also agrees that the criticisms leveled against his passing ability last year

only served to make him more nervous when he did have to throw. 
"I didn't care what anybody said, I thought I was a good pas­ser," Rice said. "But last year, I thought about it too much. Now, I'm just trying to get the job done and not letting it bot­her me. I feel like I've im­proved a lot, and I'm trying to continue to get a better feel of the ball and to learn my receivers. But so far, it's going very well."

Men's Volleyball wraps up season 1n MIVA's 
SMC track team places 4th 
Belles win three medals in Saint Joe's Relay Invite 
The Men's Volleyball Club ended a great season on a sour note last weekend, taking third place in the MIVA Regional Championships. 
The Irish, who were seeded first, lost a hard­fought battle to Michigan 12-15, 11-15 in the semi­final round of the tourney. Notre Dame played with­out the services of starter Andrew Sullivan, who was out for the weekend with an arm injury. 
Notre Dame came back to down Ohio State for third place. In pool play, the Irish defeated Wooster College, Toledo and Quincy College. They outlasted Wisconsin in the quarter-finals 15-13, 9-15, 15-12. 
Mike Shimota and Keola Chun made the all­tourney team for Notre Dame. 
Despite the disappointing finish, the Irish still had one of the best records in their history. They com­piled a 28-10 ledger, seven of those losses coming at the hands of varsity teams. More than that, they turned some of the heads that make the decisions regarding the advancement of club teams to the varsity level. 
"We had a great year," coach Bill Anderson said. "Hopefully, next year we'll be even better. We have a lot of good freshmen coming in." 

Greg Guffey 
Club Corner 


The Women's Softball Club lost seven of eight games last week to fall to 4-12 for the season. 
Notre Dame dropped a doubleheader to St. Joseph's by scores of 13-8 and 6-1. The team bounced back to defeat Purdue 13-3 behind the hitting of Meg Fay and Marie Liddy. The Boilers won the second game 11-8 after taking an eight-run lead in the first inning. 
Mter the Purdue split, the Irish lost four straight games. Lake College swept a doubleheader from the Irish 2-1 and 5-4, rallying from a 4-1 deficit in the second game. McHenry College won two from the Irish Saturday, 17-15 in a slugfest and 9-3 in the nightcap. 
The inconsistent play from both the offense and defense has left coach Joe Speybroeck looking for ways to turn the season around. 
"When the defense plays well, the offense is not hitting," Speybroeck said. "When the offense gets going, the defense makes mistakes. It's just a men­
tal lapse that arises at a certain point. It seems 
that if we don't dig ourselves in a hole early, we're 
allright." 
The Irish hope to turn things around Wednesday 
when they meet Purdue-Calumet. They also play 
Saint Mary's on Friday.

The Saint Mary's varsity track team took fourth place in the Saint Joseph's College Relay Invitational held Satur­day at Rensselaer, Ind., as in­juries and Junior Mother's Weekend left the team with only six girls to compete in the relay events. 
Saint Joseph's took first place by defeating Spring Arbor, Goshen, DePauw, Taylor, Val­paraiso Club and Saint Mary's. 
Individuals placing first, second or third received medals. The Belles won two

ND catches 'Scarlet' fever 
Golfers place 21st in Keplers on 'unforgiving' course 
By CHRIS FILLIO Sports Writer 
At the Kepler Intercollegiate Invitational this weekend, the Notre Dame golf team had to battle more than the obvious competition, as the Irish en­dured 54 holes of bitter cold at the Scarlet Course in Colum­bus, Ohio. 
Competing in the cold after enjoying a week of mild spring weather at home, Notre Dame's 21st-place finish out of 23 teams is not as surprising as it might first appear. 
Irish coach Noel O'Sullivan did not want to mask the team's performance with excuses, but conceded that the team was quite adversely affected by the weather. 
"The conditions worked on us mentally," said O'Sullivan. "It 

continued from page 16 
smooth assists to Rice and Peters. The coach assessed his own performance in a not-so­favorable light. 
"My head sees what has to be done in a certain situation," said Holtz, "but the problem is that my body doesn't react nearly as fast. It's like being on a flight to Chicago and not getting off the plane until Den­ver. In the last eight years I think I've touched a basketball twice--for Bookstore Basket­ball last year and this year." 
Holtz and his team will face seemed that it wasn't enough to simply want it. I'm not dis­appointed as a coach, but we were just pretty demoralized by the conditions." The favored Buckeyes from Ohio State took top honors in the tournament. The OSU elite overpowered the competition, turning in a three-day total of 

913. Taking a distant second was Kent State at 941, while Ball State placed third at 950. 
The Irish linksters turned in performances at 333-328-336 for a total of 996. After two days, Irish junior Doug Giorgio was in the top 10 with rounds of 81 and 74, but a third-round 93 hurt his chances at any medals as he ended with 248. The best overall performance came from junior Pat Mohan with 83­83-80 for a 246. Senior captain Dick Connelly finished at 82-88­81 for a 251, while freshman 
Pump Up The Volume, which features two more standouts from the Irish football team, defensive back George Streeter and flanker Mark Green, in today's action. Pump Up The Volume slipped past Man In A Canoe Overboard, 21­19, behind Green's eight points and a perfect 4-of-4 perfor­mance by Tim Smith. The game will be played at 6: 15 (Stepan 1) to allow those in­volved with spring football enough time to participate in both. 
"We really appreciate the way those who handle the scheduling give us the later games," said Holtz. "Our

Paul Nolta had 87-84-90 for 261. Freshman Pat Kusek scored a 267 with 91-91-85. 
"The skill was there, but there were other factors," said O'Sullivan. "We were prepared physically, but not psychologi­cally. The results would have been different under other con­ditions, but the Scarlet is un­forgiving." 
Typical of the adversity was the performance of OSU's second man and son of golf legend Jack Nicklaus, Gary Nicklaus. The younger turned in scores of 90, 83 and 86 for a 259 and most likely merited a late night phone call for advice from the Golden Bear. 
Next week the Irish will look to fare better as they head to the Spartan Invitational in East Lansing, Mich. The Irish have a much better history at the Spartan, finishing third in 1979 and first in 1986. 
policy since I've been here is that Bookstore Basketball is what Notre Dame is all about and it's something everyone participates in and has fun in so it was important to let ou; players play as long as they don't miss practice for anyother reason."

1n other action yesterday, Adworks All-Stars stopped Larvae: Boon or Bane, 21-17, but lost Mr. Bookstore 1987, John Buscher, for today's game with Ferrence and 4 Other... . Buscher twisted his ankle during the win but finished the game. 
"I came down after a dunk," began Buscher, "no ... just kid­ding. Actually I had gone up for a rebound and came down on somebody's foot. I had it checked at the hospital and nothing's broken or anything, so I should be back out there on Wednesday. 
"We're sort of the New York Yankees of this tournament," continued Buscher. "We've had a lot of lineup changes in a short time." 
The changes include Gary Voce's decision to play, then not to play, then to play again, as well as the addition of Ricky Watters and the absence of Cedric Fili(aro.

The Notre Dame men's ten­nis season hit a high point last weekend with impressive wins over Indiana State and Ohio University. 
Notre Dame defeated In­diana State 6-3, then knocked off Ohio by a 7-2 score. The win over Ohio was particularly im­pressive as the Irish were slight underdogs going into the match. "We were really hur­ting coming into this weekend," said first-year Irish coach Bob Bayliss. "Mike Wal­lace, Dave Reiter, Dan Walsh and Paul Daggs were all out. That meant I had to start four freshmen in singles, and it worried me." 
Bayliss' spirits were lifted when the freshmen on his squad gave him a pep talk. 
"They basically told me they'd take care of every­thing,"said Bayliss. The Irish then went on to have a victorious weekend, led by the sparkling play of freshmen Ryan Wenger, Paul Odland,

Against Indiana State the Irish were favorites on paper, but with all the injuries plagu­ing the team, it looked to be a close match. The Irish bench responded with a resounding 6­3 win over Indiana State on Sat­urday. 
It turned out to be a rela­tively easy match for Notre Dame, which took five out of six singles matches. Junior stalwart Brian Kalbas trounced Claude Servant in straight sets 6-4, 6-2. Senior Sean O'Brien defeated Brad Begley 6-1, 6-2. Ryan Wenger won over Dallas Kelsey 6-2, 6-3. 
In other singles play, Paul Odland and Shaun Sparkman won in straight sets. The only Irish loss in singles came at the hands of Mark Smith, who edged Dave Kuhlman 6-4, 5-7, 6-1. 
In doubles action against In­diana State, the Notre Dame team of Arnell Gallanosa and Ron Shashy defeated Smith and Kelsey 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. Notre Dame lost the other two doubles matches by close scores. 
The Irish next took on Ohio University on Saturday after­noon. This match was expected to be much closer than the match with Indiana State. Notre Dame played a superb match, working as a cohesive unit to win 7-2 despite the team's injuries. In singles, Odland, Kuhlman and Sparkman all won over Chris Petersen, Matt Kline and Fred Krase, respectively. The other singles win came from junior star Brian Kalbas, who defeated Jay Ethridge in straight sets 6-3, 7-5. 
Notre Dame swept all three doubles matches from Ohio University to wrap up the vic­tory. The ailing Dave Reiter teamed up with Arnell Gal­lanosa to beat Ethridge and Donase 6-3, 1-6, 6-1. Kalbas and Ryan Wenger won in three sets, as did the freshmen tandem of Kuhlman and Odland. 
Notre Dame now is 17-10 and will finish the season by the end of this month.

Men's field narrows to 32 title dreams 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
It all comes down to six days of basketball. 
Bookstore Basketball XVII kicked off its final 
week yesterday as 32 teams advanced to today's 
fifth round action in hopes of surviving to this 
weekend's culmination of the world's largest 
basketball tournament.

before the tournament resumes on Friday and

over the weekend. 

Among those who advanced to today's action 
were Lou's 2 QBs And Two Blind Guys and 
Pump Up The Volume, who will face each other 
today. Lou's 2 QB's ... survived a scare from 
Rick, Dan and ... ,pulling out a 21-16 win behind 
Jeff Peters' 10-of-11 shooting performance. 
Lou's 2 QBs, Kent Graham and Tony Rice,

added three for the winners. Lou Holtz went 
0-for-5 from the field but did dish out some 
see HOLTZ, page 13 
Garrett is pleased with the progress of the 5000-meter trio. 
"I think each of us is improv­ing vastly," said Garrett. "We have each dropped our time by about 15 to 18 seconds." 
A school record also was set in the hammer throw. Senior Tom Mick broke his own record of 173 feet, set earlier this season, with a throw of 182'6" at Stanford. Mick placed first in the event and also gained a berth in the IC4A's. 
Other individual winners for the Irish included senior Rick Mulvey and freshman Ron Culp. Mulvey recorded a time of 8:57.32 in the 3000-meter steeplechase and Culp took the­400-meter run in 48.97 seconds. 


Both now have qualified for the IC4A's. 
Not to be outdone, sophomore Glenn Watson was victorious in the 110-meter high hurdles with a time of 14.52 seconds. Fresh­man Ryan Mihalko, though finishing third in the javelin, still qualified for the IC4A's with a throw of 209 feet. 
The Irish will participate in the Indiana Intercollegiates this weekend. Coach Piane is wary, yet optimistic, of his team's chances at Indiana. 
"It's tough to compete 
against the likes of a Indiana 
and Purdue," Piane stated. 
"Yet I'm confident we'll have 
some strong individual perfor­
mances this weekend."

workout spring season, which concludes Sunday with the playing of the annual Blue-Gold game, Rice has a firm grip on the No. 1 offense, thanks to the sophomore's experience and elusive running ability. 

Graham, a 6'5" freshman with superior passing skills but slower feet out of the pocket, remains as he finished in 1987 --right behind. 
"There's still competition at the quarterback spot," said Irish coach Pete Cordelli, who along with coach Jim Strong has spent much of his time evaluating the signal-callers. "But Tony has moved the team consistently and he's No. 1 right now. We're not necessar­ily looking for a quarterback who can make the big play, but one who can get you out of the bad one. And Tony's been the most consistent doing that." 
The speedy Rice frequently turned broken plays into big gains last season, leading the Irish to five wins in seven games after senior starter Terry Andrysiak went down with a broken collarbone. 
Irish coach Lou Holtz and his staff, however, never felt com­fortable allowing the strong· armed but erratic Rice to put the ball in the air. As a result, the predominantly ground­oriented offense became predictable and impotent late in the season. 
"We can't win being a one­dimensional team," Holtz vowed before the start of spring workouts. "We've got to be able to either throw or run the ball when we want to against the caliber of opposition we face from week to week." 
Graham, whose 16-of-24 pass­ing for 248 yards in seven games of the 1987 campaign made him a strong candidate
