the independent student newspaper serving Notre Dame and Saint Mary's 
Nicaraguan vice president to speak here 
By MARK PANKOWSKI News Editor 
Accepting an invitation from a campus group, the vice pres­ident of Nicaragua has agreed to visit Notre Dame on Nov. 21 to discuss the relationship be­tween his government and the Catholic Church. 
Sergio Ramirez-Mercado is scheduled to give a presenta­tion entitled "Church and State in Nicaragua" at 3 p.m. in the Annenberg Auditorium of the Snite Museum of Art. 
He will be accompanied by Carlos Tunnermann, ambassa­dor from Nicaragua to the United States. 
The Graduate Association for Latin America, a group of eight Notre Dame graduate students, extended an invita­tion to Ramirez-Mercado on Sept. 25, according to Jurgen Brauer, the group's spokesper­son. 
Co-sponsoring the presenta­tion is the South Bend Chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. 
Brauer said his group, whose goal is to promote community awareness of Latin American issues, asked Ramirez­Mercado to speak because of 
the  "conflict  between  the  
Church  and  state  in  
Nicaragua."  Campus view Color provided by Anheuser-Busch, Inc.

Waldheim denies he saw killings or was asked to work for Soviets 

Associated Press 
VIENNA, Austria-President Kurt Waldheim said on Thursday he did not fight Yugoslav partisans during a Nazi operation and denied he was approached after the war to work for Soviet intelligence, according to his spokesman. 
Gerold Christian, Waldheim's spokesman, made the comments after new alle­gations appeared in the U.S. media about Waldheim's activ­ity in World War II. 
The Washington Post re­ported Thursday that Waldheim acknowledged after months of denial that he had played a role in the brutal Nazi "pacification" operation that cost thousands of lives in Yugoslavia. 
It said in a 13-page memo sent to the Post in April that the former U.N. secretary­general had denied he was in­volved in the 1942 operation to remove all80,000 residents, in­cluding 3,500 armed partisans, from Kozara, a mountainous region in Yugoslavia. 
The newspaper Thursday quoted Christian as saying "ad­ditional research" revealed the president's earlier statement was incorrect. 
But in a telephone conversa­tion with The Associated Press on Thursday, Christian said the earlier statements by Waldheim that he was not in­volved in the Kozara operation "were not incorrect." 
"The war record was, however, supplemented after files and documents were found" and the information was made available to U.S. aut­horities in August, Christian said. 
Christian, who said Waldheim was in the Kozara area for a short period, quoted the president as saying he was not directly involved in fighting and did not witness mass kil­lings. 
Waldheim "never was pres­ent during combat action," Christian said. "He was unfit for the front and never had a rifle to shoot with. . . . " 

"Waldheim never took part 
A secretary in Waldheim's office later telephoned the AP with an English-language statement, saying, "With regard to the Kozar a (area), Dr. Waldheim's service was limited to the normal duties of a junior supply officer and did not involve any combat activ­ity." 
Waldheim's recent cam­paign-for the presidency was marred by allegations he was involved in wartime atrocities against partisans and Jews in Yugoslavia and Greece. in anY way in actions against partisans or Jews," Christian said. The spokesman said Waldheim "never got into physical contact with par­tisans, because he performed a subordinated activity" as a supply officer. 
Waldheim denied the charges and maintained he was the victim of a campaign to deny him the presidency. He won the June 8 election with nearly 54 percent of the vote. 

Congresswoman says religion and politics do mix in government 
By CINDY RAUCKHORST Senior Staff Reporter 
Louisiana Congresswoman Corrine Claiborne "Lindy" Boggs told a Notre Dame audi­ence Thursday that religion and politics do mix, despite constant questions about the nature of their relationship. 
"We Americans can breathe a sigh of relief that our system of government under our con­stitution. . . is strong enough and resilient enough to accom­modate political and religious movements without visiting undue principles, practices and laws," she said at the Center for Continuing Education. 
The 14-year House veteran said U.S. churches and religi­ous organizations are impor­tant links in the political process because of the input they provide to government leaders. 
"Many play that important role to the hilt," she said. 

Boggs, a liberal democrat, said, however, that religious leaders must respect the writ­ten and unwritten limits of their political participation. 
"As are most Americans, I am apprehensive about a preacher or a priest or a rabbi accompanying me into the voting booth, for example," she added. 
"Religion and politics in modern America remain a complex and mixed pattern of conflict and accommodation," she said. 
Boggs said she also is troubled when a politician's re­ligious beliefs are called into question because of an arms control or social programs vote. 
"Criticize them because of how they voted and because of their philosophies, but not be­cause of how they believe in God," she explained. 
Boggs became the first wo­man elected to Congress from Louisiana in March of 1972, after winning a special election called to fill a vacancy left by her husband, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs, who disap­peared after an apparent plane crash in Alaska. 
Hotly-debated issues such as school prayer and equal access proposals, public observance of religion and public aid to private schools challenge gov­ernment officials most often today, Boggs said. 
She said that although no church-state issue has excited greater public controversy

'Pink slips' won't be sent home to some SMC parents 
By PEGGY PROSSER Staff Reporter 
Mid-semester deficiency notices will no longer be sent to the parents of juniors and seniors at Saint Mary's, ac­cording to Teresa Marcy, the College's assistant to the vice-president. 
The proposal to discon­tinue mailing the deficiency notices to parents of juniors and seniors was passed at a meeting of the Academic Standards Committee, of which Marcy is a member. The proposal was also passed by the Academic Af­fairs Council and was ap­proved by College President William Hickey. 
The notices, known to Saint Mary's students as "pink slips," are sent to stu­dents whose work at mid­term is lacking in some way. 
"A deficiency is a warning that there is still time to im­prove," said Marcy. 
Instructors will now be re­quired to send deficiency notices to appropriate stu­dents, whereas some had previously chosen to not do so. This has created prob­lems for students in the past, Marcy said. 
"If a student thinks she's getting one and doesn't get it, she thinks she's doing bet­ter than she actually is. This is very misleading to the stu­dent," Marcy said. 

Ifa professor still chooses not to send the notices home, he or she will not receive support from the College should a problem arise, Marcy added. 
"If a professor doesn't send one, the administration won't support a professor if he or she IS challenged for a grade," Marcy said. 
The new policy is ex­plained in detail in a letter that has been mailed out to students and their parents. 
Under the new system, a student's parents will receive a copy of the deficiency notices only if the student is on academic probation, Marcy said. Otherwise, juniors and seniors are expected to have enough experience to evalu­ate their own performance, according to Marcy. It will be up to the student to share with her parents informa­tion about her academic status. 
The letter states that any parent of a junior or senior who wishes to receive copies of deficiency notices must

In Brief 

William Shannon , professor of history and journalism at Boston University and former U.S. ambassador to Ireland, ~ave a lecture yesterday titled "Two Views of Irish Nationalism" to approximately fifty people in the Memorial Library auditorium lounge. Shannon spoke of the influence Irish-Americans had on the Irish quest for national identity during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The lecture was sponsored by Notre Dame's Charles and Margaret Hall Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism as one of its annual Hibernian Series. -The Observer 
Ten Notre Dame faculty members were recently in­stalled in endowed academic chairs. The professors in­stalled were: Charles Alcock, Frank Freimann, Visiting Professor of Materials Science and Engineering; Jorge Bustamante, Eugene and Helen Conley Professor of Sociol­ogy; Wladyslaw Fiszdon, Visiting Frank Freimann Pro­fessor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering; Jacek Furdyna, Aurora and Tom Marquez Professor of Infor­mation Theory and Computer Technology; John Gilligan, George Shuster University Professor and special assistant to the president for public policy; Father Richard McCor­mich, John O'Brien Professor of Christian Ethics; Philip Quinn, John O'Brien Professor of Philospohy; Robert Schuler, John Zahm, Professor of Radiation Chemistry; Father Robert Taft, Visiting John O'Brien Professor of Theology; Robert Vecchio, Franklin Schurz Professor of Management. The University has 95 endowed professor­ships established and 60 fully funded. -The Observer 
The pursuit of parietal r~vision at this time was voted down at last night's joint meeting of the Saint Mary's Programming Board and Board of Governance. The boards voted 12-6 to keep the present system requiring men to leave their IDs at a parietal desk. The new policy would still require an escort in the hall, but it would not be necessary for men to leave an ID at a parietal desk. Judicial Commissioner Mary Fisher has started a student committee, independent of student government, to rally support for the new policy. -The Observer

College students too grown up for eighth-grade dating scene 
The following events are true. Some names and identities have been changed to protect the guilty. 
While relaxing on the tropical island of Jamaica, my mind was quickly brought back to the reality of South Bend when I first entered the Junkanoo Lounge. Located in the beautiful six star Rose Hall Beach Hotel, in Montego Bay, Jamaica, was the lounge--the Jamaican version of the Senior Bar. As I sat with some friends, sipping on the special Rum punch, listening to popular songs from the United States, I looked and realized the entire place was filled with Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. After sitting at a table, watching people dance, one of my friends decided to get a drink. Right after she left, I felt a tap on the shoulder and a guy said, "Hey, what's your friend's name in the white jump suit?" I said, "The one with blond or brown hair?" "The blond," he said. I told him her name was Cindy. He said, "Tell her I say hi." Off he went and I thought, O.K. now I'm supposed to tell my friend that some guy with short brown hair says hi. When she returned I told her what he said. She was semi­flattered but more confused as to why he couldn't tell her himself. 
About a half an hour later, as I was walking past the bar, the same guy approached me and said, "Hey, tell her my name is Dan." O.K. As I went back I told her and we thought, wait a minute, we're all seniors in college. This reminded me of eighth grade behavior. Then I thought about my 13 year old niece, an ei~hth grader, and how she dates. A friend of a fnend will aP.proach her and say, Dave wants to go out with you. If she tells that friend yes, then they are going out. No, they don't go anywhere, but they are an item. They may write notes, talk on the phone, or meet at the mall. When on.e of the two wishes to break up, they just tell a friend and it soons gets back to the other P.erson. An eighth grader doesn't have the pos­Itive self-image necessary to take charge. 
The next stage comes in high school, some people continue to go through friends in making sure the person they want to take out will say yes. But when the couple finally does get to­gether, they are able to decide how serious they will become and when they will break up be­tween each other. Here, people may have more self confidence but a positive self-image may be lacking. 
My impression was that the next stage comes in college--at least by senior year. I would hope that if someone can make it through 4 years of college at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's, that they would be able to say hello to a member of the opposite sex. It's sad if they can't. I realize the same insecurites and fear can come up when

a person has a crush on someone else. This is normal. People may want the security and protection of making sure before they take the chance of saying hello. This fear of rejection is harmful and lessens self-confidence. 
According to Dr. Wayne Dyer, self -confidence ~~gins with a posi~ive attitude. By having pos­Itive self-expectations, for example, expecting to succeed, to be attractive and to be effective self-confidence will be enhanced. He says self confidence comes from oneself, and not from other people. "Allfear is internal,'' and he adds, people are not fearsome, one thinks fearful ~houghts and ~hen beco~es afraid. Competition Is not a confidence budder, because it must come from oneself and not by comparison. 
The key to self confidence is action Dyer says. He poses the question of, "How do you know that you can ride a bicycle? Because you've done it." The same is true for saying hello to a member of the. opposite sex, asking someone to dance, or askmg someone out on a date. By asserting oneself, saying hello when one may be feeling shy or insecure, the level of self confidence is improved. 

l
It is only until peorle are willing to take this chance that they wil know what a relationship means. A relationship can only build with love and trust and this means taking risks.

Irish, Middies clash for 60th time 
Longest consecutive rivalry marked with memories 




By RICK RIETBROCK Sports Writer 
Bob Dylan's claim that the times are a changin' can be seen in the long history of Notre Dame-Navy contests. What was once a matchup between powers is now something less prestigious. 
Notre Dame owns a 49-9-1 mark against Navy in the nation's longest continuous intersec­tional rivalry, and the Irish have also taken the last 22 games played. 
But the simple numbers of the of the games do not accurately portray the significance of the series. They do not take into account such things as in­tegrity and mutual respect. 



Banks pulls his weight 

Senior switches to aid Irish 

These are the cornerstones of the matchup. 
"Some people say that Notre Dame should quit playing Navy," says Navy Sports Infor­mation Director Thomas Bates. "A lot of people think we should stop playing Notre Dame, too. They wonder why we keep going to continually get beat up. 
"The fact of the matter is that the relationship between the two schools is one of the health­iest around. By healthy, I mean that we both have clean pro­grams, and we have mutual respect for each other, going all the way from the ad­ministrations to the coaches to the players." 
Notre Dame Sports Informa­tion Director Roger V aldiserri echoes Bates' sentiments about the schools' mutual respect. 
"These schools just have a .great relationship," he says. "It's just a pleasure to flaythem each year because o the relationship we have." 
The last time it wasn't much of a pleasure for the Irish was way back in 1963 when the Mid­shipmen trounced Notre Dame 35-14. Navy's quarterback was a fellow named Roger Staubach back then. 
It's no coincidence that some the most memorable games in the series, according to both

After establishing oneself at a position, making a change seems very unlikely and highly undesire­able. 
For Robert Banks, a change in jobs seemed very unlikely during his first three years at outside 
linebacker for the Irish. 
In his first three seasons, Banks backed the line in every contest and is the only player on the cur­rent Notre Dame roster to have played in all 35 games between 1983 and 1985. In that period, he logged over 560 minutes of playing time and ac­counted for over 133 tackles. 
While Notre Dame welcomed a new head coach this season, Notre Dame also graduated some out­standing talent on the defensive line last year, including a first-round draft choice for the New York Giants in Eric Dorsey. With only two expe­rienced starters returning to anchor the defenstve front, the Irish called on Banks to make a move to defensive tackle. 

"He's adjusted very well," says Irish defensive line coach Joe Yonto. "He's doing a fine job. He's fulfilled our expectations-there's no question. It's a matter of him adjusting to a new position and doing well." 
While Banks did well at outside linebacker and
felt comfortable behind the line, he accepted the challenge on the line despite being at a size dis­
advantage. 

"Going into the spring, we only had two defensive linemen in Wally Kleine and Mike Griffin, who was recovering from an injury," explains Banks. "I wouldn't want to go through my senior year saying I had a pretty good year playing outside linebacker while I didn't help the team, because we were hurting up in the line. 
"It's gone pretty well," continues the 6-5, 246­pounder. "I have to really go out and work hard everyday -more than I had imagined playing in my senior year because outside linebacker was so comfortable. I have to do a lot of little things well

1962-Behind Daryle Lamonica, Notre Dame upsets Navy and Roger Staubach, 20-12. 

Series 
continuedfrom page 1 

Valdiserri and Athletic Direc­tor Emeritus Edward "Moose" Krause, took place in the early sixties when the versatile Staubach was running and throwing his way into the record books. 
Notre Dame beat Staubach as a sophomore while holding him to only 65 yards of total offense. Daryl Lamonica stole the show with two one-yard touchdown plunges, and a 45-yard touch­down pass to guide the Irish to the 20-12 upset. 
Stuabach's Middies got their revenge the next season, however, 35-14. While Staubach threw for two touchdowns, ful­lback Pat Donnelly proved to be the real problem as he rushed for 127 yards in 14 carries and caught for 41 yards as well. 
In 1964, John Huarte and the Irish whipped Staubach, who struggled with minor injuries, and the Midshipmen, 40-0. That rout marked the beginning of the current Notre Dame 22­game winning streak over Navy. · 
Some of the best games of the series took place in the 30s and the 40s. Both teams were powers and most of the games had major implications with the final rankings. 
The best of the batch occurred from 1943-45. In 1943, the top­ranked Irish coached by Frank Leahy, pummeled the third­ranked Middies, 33-6. Notre Dame went on to win the Na­tional Championship, while Navy finished fourth. 
In 1944, sixth-ranked Navy up­set the Irish, who were second­ranked, by a 32-13 score. Navy finished fourth, while Notre Dame fell to ninth in the final polls. 
Second-ranked Notre Dame and third-ranked Navy met in 1945, and fought to a 6-6 tie. The Irish went on to lose twice and fall to ninth in the rankings, while Navy finished second. 
But no matter which game was most important, or which was the most exciting, each person has that certain game that sticks in his mind the most. Valdiserri and Bates are no ex­ceptions. 
"One of the most interesting games was in 1974, in Philadel­phia, with Ara Parseghian coaching," Valdiserri says. "We were heavily favored, and it was a real dogfight. We came away with a 14-6 win. They played us very tough. 
"That game is typical of the series, though. When one team is supposed to run all over the other, it's a close game. When it's supposed to be close, it isn't." 
Bates recalls two memorable games in recent years that have turned Navy's bids for victory into showcases for the "what if" museum. 
"Two years ago, we were ahead 17-7 with less than three minutes left," Bates says. "They came back to win on a Carney field goal, but three calls went against us that would have given us the victory had the referees made the calls. They had 12 men on the field once, they roughed the punter and the 25-second clock ran out on the winning field goal. Even the holder admitted it had run out." 
The other could-have-been for Bates also ranks on Valdiser­ri's list. Bates describes Navy's heartbreaker like this. 
"It was in Cleveland in 1976," he says. "We came into the game with a 1-6 record and, like this year, with a lot of injuries. Pitt had beaten us, 45-0, the week earlier. But Notre Dame

to stay ahead of my opponents. 
Notre Dame proved to be an obvious choice for the Hampton, Va., native be­cause of the strong football tradition and the challenge that Notre Dame pro­vided. 
"Football was a big priority," says Banks. "Notre Dame plays a lot of good people with a tough schedule. 
"I got an offer to go to just about any school in the nation," says the prep all­American. "In the long run, for a black athlete to go to Notre Dame and come out is quite prestigious. The challenge carried a lot of weight." 
As a freshman, Banks gradually worked his way into the starting line-up in the season finale against Air Force. In that contest, the young defender made his presence known with 10 tackles at weakside linebacker. 
In his second and third seasons, Banks continued to improve with consistent strong outings. After former Irish linebacker Mike Larkin suffered a knee injury prior to the start of the 1984 cam­paign, Banks was able to capture a starting job at outside linebacker -a job that he maintained for 23 straight games. 
As a sophomore, Banks was second on the squad in tackles with 65 including 21 solos. Last year, the former backer notched 50 stops including a sack and three drops for lost yardage. 

This season, Banks began the cam­paign with an outstanding effort against the highly-tauted Michigan Wolverines. Banks led the Irish in the season opener with 13 tackles including eight solos and one tackle for a six-yard loss. 
In the first road game for the Irish; however, disaster found Banks. The new tackle pulled a hamstring against Michigan State. That pull sidelined him for the first time as a member of the Irish when Notre Dame entertained Purdue the following week. 
"It was kind of weird to sit on the sidelines and look in," says Banks. "There were some points in the game when I wanted to go in, and it was kind of hard to look down the road and hope to get healthy. But I didn't want to hurt the team more than I could help it." 
Banks believes that he is currently playing at about 85 percent. Despite the pulled hamstrin~, Banks did start the Alabama game m which he accounted for seven stops. While he missed the Pitt game, Banks did manage to come back against Air Force. 
"He's been bothered by that hamstring injury," says Yonto. "It's one of those things that, when you get it, it stays with you the rest of the season. Unfor­tunately, that hamstring bothered him enough that he can't make some moves in there that he normally could. He's playing over it, however, with a great effort." 
While his maneuverability has been hampered, Banks' speed remains his greatest commodity. 
"I think I'm more effective now," says Banks. "I'm in a position that could cause problems for the offense. The strongest part of my game is playing the line against the run. I can utilize my quickness against opponents when they are 300 (pounds) or 280 and a lot slower." 
Yonto agrees that Banks' speed is a 

Hobert Banks 

definite plus on the line for the Irish. The defensive coach, however, believes that the tackle contributes in other ways as well. 
"He contributes quickness and he con­tributes help in shutting down the run­ning game," says Yonto. "He also con­tributes hurries on the passer. His overall attitude has certainly helped the defense. His strongest points are his quickness and his desire to excell." 
For the rest of the season, the senior believes that the Irish have come a long way and will have a good shot at win­ning their last five contests to end the campaign on a strong note. If the Irish are successful in this task, the two-time bowl game starter believes that the Irish will be heading south to another bowl this year. 
"We've come a long way since our defeat to Miami last year,'' says Banks. "We have proven to ourselves that we can play with anyone in the country. If we would have eliminated some of the mistakes, we would have been in the win column much more. 
"We can't look back. This team still has a lot of confidence and people are putting forth a good effort. We're going to look forward, try to win the rest of our games and end up with a 7-4 record." 
Despite lack-luster records throughout his career at Notre Dame, Banks has been pleased with stay. 
"I have no regrets," says Banks. "As a person, I have grown a lot in coming here, and I'll never regret it." 
After this season, the psychology major hopes to pursue a professional football career. Ifthe opportunity arises, Banks is likely to contribute a strong attitude in the pro ranks. 
"I can only give it my best shot. You try to do everything you can to win, and that's the main thing-winning."

Time travel is fun in 'Peggy Sue Got Married' 

r r 
DON SEYMOUR features writer 
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about "Peggy Sue Got Married" is the resurrection of director Francis Coppola. After nearly a decade of nops("One From the Heart," "The Outsiders" and "Rumble Fish"), he has emerged from a morass of personal problems with his finest film since "Apocalypse Now." That film was a masterpiece; "Peggy Sue" is not quite that good. You could say it's a mature "Back to the Future." 

Movie review 
Peggy Sue Got Married 
***(outof four) 
Peggy Sue Bardell, upset about her im­pending divorce, attends her 25th high school reunion. While being crowned queen of the reunion, she faints and finds herself transported back to her senior year of high school with her 4.3-year-old sensibiljty and experience intact. She's given the chance to relive her past and change what she did wrong. 
As with "Back to the Future," the anachronisms involved in time travel are great fun. In Peggy Sue's case, most of this fun comes from the clash of a grown woman's consciousness in a teenager's body. Peggy Sue gets caught drinking after a tough day and she tells her teacher that algebra is worthless in future life. In one of the funniest scenes, she asks her boyfriend (and husband to be) to make love. He gets nervous and responds by checking his watch. 
Unlike "Back to the Future," the fun takes a backseat to the character of Peg­gy. She is, as she tells her friend Richard, a walking anachronism. The film's power lies in this woman's chance to evaluate

the choices she's made in life and to re­
member what led her to make those 
choices. 

The film seems to believe the past can­not be changed much. "I can't change anything. I can't help anybody," Peggy Sue says in exasperation near the end of the movie. What is even more interesting is that she finds out she doesn't want to change much. She does give the outcasts--the school brain and a beatnik poet--the chance she didn't give them as a teenager. But overall, to change her past would be to lose the future she's known and she's not willing to do that. 
Some of the finest moments in this film occur when the adult Peggy Sue ap­preciates what she had taken for granted in the past. She hugs her baby sister just for walking into the room. When her mot­her tucks her into bed, she says, "Mom, I never remember you being this young." Then there's the magical scene with her grand-parents, played by Maureen O'Sullivan and Leon Ames. Peggy Sue tells them how she has travelled in time and they believe her. 
Kathleen Turner delivers a first rate per­formance as Peggy Sue, though she doesn't quite look 18. It's not an Academy Award-winning performance, but she'll probably be nominated. Nicholas Cage stands out more than Turner because his performance as her boyfriendtlusband is convincing. He makes an unlikeable char­acter interesting. Plus, his younger age allows him to pull off the age range more smoothly than Turner can. Finally, Barry Miller shines as Richard Norvik, the school brain turned successful businessman. 
"Peggy Sue Got Married" is a relief after one of the worst movie summers ever. It's intelligent and mature--not a master­piece, but a moving tale of a dream we all have: to relive the past. 
"Peggy Sue Got Married" is now showing at the Scottsdale Mall Theater.

Theater superstition 
KATHY MARTIN 
Assistant features editor 
"Break a legt" 
"Don't whistle on stage!" 

"No humming or singing the lyrics to a show In the dressing roornt" 
The theater profession Is one of real-life representation and the Illusions of make-belleve,creatlon on stage. But there Is more to the profession than what the audience views on opening nlghl 
Among actors and dancers. directors and sceneographers, there are all sorts of superstitions and rituals that are played out on and off-stage to ensure a flne performance. These rituals have evolved Into theater folfdore.. passed down through the years and the performances to more experienced actors, chorus members. and stagehands alike;'

Tom 6afkes,. rna. ~.,; g~ Hall and a former dancer with the Balleth'l .  ...·f. ..·· .. . .

"You never wish someone luck,~ ~rke.s said, ''You don't need luck If you have talent. and that Js how tile expression came aboul" 
The superstition that whistlingon stage Is bad luck Is also taken quite seriously. Some ,ctors stOp In their tracks and tum around three times, then either swear or spit to ward off the evil spirits after someone whistles. According to Barkes, there Is a good reason behind this superstition. "When theater flrst started in New York, the flrst stagehands-were sailors brought from the ships who understood riggings and fly systems. There were no telephones or headsets, so they would cue people to raise and lower things by whistling," he said. "Ifyou whistled on stage back then, you could get things dropped on you." 
Professor Fred Syburg of Notre Dame's Communica· tionS'Theater Department commented that many Individual actors have their own Individual superstitions. "When a performance goes well," he said, "an actor tries to recall the sequence of things he did In preparation for his character to go on stage. Then he goes through the same routine and trtes to recapture the magic. It can take on the quality of a kind of ritual and ultimately a superstition." 
"But I don't think actors are more superstitious than anyone else," Syburg added. "A basketball player has his own routine of preparation every time, too. We all have our little crutches." 
Professor Reginald Bain, chairman of Notre Dame's Communi· cations and Theater department. Is challenging a very serious superstition this Sprlhg in directing a student performance of Shakespeare's "MacBeth." It Is known as the "unlucky play," and It Is bad luck even to mention the play In a theater. Many actors refer to It as "that play," and perform a ritual of going out the door, turning three times, and swearing after someone mentions the evil name in a theater. 
Baln attributes the superstition to the "demonology of the play and the activity of the witches," though he said that "MacBeth" Is probably one of the most produced of Shakespeare's plays. "I'm not particularly superstitious," he said. "I walk under ladders. I'm probably doomed," he smiled. 
Theater folklore of old is stiU alive in the superstitions and rituals that are an Integral part of the theater profession, religi­ously held by some and Ignored by others. But will there be any whistling on stage as the production of "MacBeth" tempts fate this Spring?

But no matter how many games have decided the National Championship, or how many have gone down to the final seconds, or even ifneither team is close to being ranked, the Notre Dame-Navy series is a special one. Valdiserri and Krause admire the relentlessness that is so characteristic of the Midshipmen. 
''They always play us tough,'' Valiserri says. "They always battle down to the wire. They just never give up." 
"They are always a great challenge," echoes Krause. "They don't quit and that's typical of the series. 
"Back in the earlier days of the series, the Academies were traditional powers, and maybe they'll get back to that level, but the game is still special today. It's still a sellout in Baltimore. It's Just a great series." 
Bates says he believes the beginning of the series has a lot to do with the cur­rent relationship that the two schools enjoy. 
"When the first game was played in Baltimore in 1927, there was no written contract," he says. "We just cemented the deal with a handshake, and the two teams played the first ten games with just the handshake agreement of how the profits would be split." 
While the two football programs are not at the level they once were, the rela­tionship remains intact. After that first handshake in Baltimore, Father Res­burgh and Father Joyce have served on the Naval Academy's Board of Visitors (similar to the Board of Trustees) and a long list of players have shared a mutual respect for their opponents. Bates thinks that is because they both realize that the guy is a student, not just a football player. 
The relationship is very much alive today. If you go to an all-star game, Bates says that you will see Notre Dame and Navy players hanging out together regularly. 
Sixty years of games definitely does something, but instead of showing how much the times change, as Dylan has suggested, the Notre Dame-Navy se­ries has supported Alphonse Carr, who said, "The more thmgs change, the more they stay the same."

Notre Dame Nips Navy 
late Irish rally preserves win streak 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
When Notre Dame met Navy in the East Rutherford, N.J., Meadowlands in 1984, the Midshipmen appeared to be sailing to an easy victory. 
It would have been the first Navy triumph over the Irish since 1963 in one of college football's longest-running se­ries but in the final four minutes, John Carney, Steve Beu~rlein and the Notre Dame offense decided it was time to sink the Naval Academy's ship. 
Carney nailed a 44-yard field goal with 14 seconds remain­ing in the contest finishing off an 11-point comeback which erased a 10-point'Navy lead, and giving the Irish a thrilling 18-17 victory. 
Following a first-quarter touchdown by Notre Dame's ~­len Pinkett, the Middies came back to score 18 consecutive points to put the Irish in deep trouble late in the game. 
A Notre Dame fumble in the second quarter led to a six­yard touchdown run by Navy fullback John Berner, tying the score at the half. 
Navy seemed to be toying with the Irish in the third quar­ter, when it opened up a 14-7 lead with the help of some trickery. On a third-and-goal play from the 2-yard line, reserve quarterback Jim Lauletta lined up in the tailback slot and took a shotgun snap from center. He then tossed the ball to wide-open quarterback Bill Byrne for the score. 
A Todd Solomon field goal with 4:02 left made it 17-7 Middies, and set the stage for the remarkable comeback. 
Beuerlein, the sophomore quarterback, started things off, skippering an 83-yard touchdown drive that took only 1:45 off the clock. The signal-caller hooked up on five consecu­tive completions, three to freshman Tim Brown, and Pinkett finished things off with a one-yard run. 
The junior Pinkett finished with 165 yards on the day, moving him into second place on Notre Dame's all-time rushing list and becoming the leader in 100-yard games for the Irish, with his 14th. 
Beurlein found flanker Joe Howard wide open for a two­point conversion to make the score 17-15, and a tough defensive series by Notre Dame stopped the Middies in three plays. 
The decisive drive began on the Irish 18-yard line following a Navy punt and a Notre Dame personal foul, but Beuerlein and the Irish troops worked the clock well in the final minute and moved down to the Navy 26. 
And just when the Midshipmen thought they had broken the draught with a long-awaited win over a Notre Dame football team, Carney promptly kicked a hole in the Navy battleship.

The Game 
~-·.


By DENNIS CORRIGAN 
Sports Editor 
BALTIMORE-Ifyou're a midshipman at the Naval Academy, you have to ask yourself 'How Ion~, how long?' when it comes to the subJect of Notre Dame. The two prestigious institutions have played each other every year for the past 60, and it hasn't been much of a contest. 
The Irish own a 49-9-1 advanta~e over

-the Midshipmen, with the Midd1es last victory coming in 1963 when a man named Staubach led his squad to a 35-14 win. Since then, the Irish have won 22 straight, the longest win streak vs. an opponent in their history. 
Notre Dame looks to continue the streak when it travels to Baltimore to­morrow. As is standard, Navy will host the game at a stadium other than Navy­Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in An­napolis. Navy discovered the drawing power of Notre Dame way back in 1927 when the two schools first played in Bal­timore. other games have been played in Cleveland, Philadelphia and Giants Stadium in New Jersey. A sell-out crowd of 60,194 is expected at Memorial Stadium, twice the number that fills Navy's own field. 
The 3-4 Midshipmen have been on both sides of lopsided scores this season, racking up wins of 41-0 over Lehigh and 45-0 over Dartmouth. On the other hand, Navy has lost 40-6 to Air Force, 52-29 to Indiana and last week Pitt rolled to a 52-14 over the Middies. 
Notre Dame (2-4) has lost its share of heartbreakers, but its two victories have come easily. Still Irish head coach Lou Holtz isn't taking the Midshipmen lightly. 
''Any time you play an academy,'' says Holtz "You better take your chin straps, pads and everything else be­cause they do play well. I have a lot of respect for Navy, particularly when you watch them on film. They are a very veteran football team." 
Navy's offense vs. 
Notre Dame's defense 
What do you do when your team loses college football's all-time all-purpose yardage leader? If you're Navy head coach Gary Tranquill, you simply find a back that's almost as good. While Chuck Smith might never require the Navy to bend its rules to allow him to play in the NFL, he is currently the fourth-leading ground gainer in the na­tion with an average of 125.2 yards a game. Smith is also ranked third in all­purpose running with an average of 

182.7 yards per contest. All told, the 5­10, 196-pound junior has gained 877 yards rushing while scoring 10 touch­downs. 
"Smith possesses three things that all good running backs really have," Holtz says of the Navy tailback. "No.1, he ued. "He runs with good body lean. He's always going forward. He has the abil­ity to change directions and good bal­ance." 
Besides having a good offensive line, Navy uses variable sets and formations to disguise the way Smith will get the ball, making him all the more danger­ous to Holtz. 
"They utilize him in an awful lot of dif­ferent manners. They change sets, and they change formations. You can never really zero in on him. You never know 

has very good eyes. He can see the whole line of scrimmage. He's apt to run off guard and then bend it all the way back behind the defensive end if everybody doesn't keep in a relative position. He may start up at one place and end anywhere. There's a great cor­relation between being a great runner and having great peripheral vision. 
"The second thing he has is very, very good quickness. From a standing start to a full speed he's probably as quick as anybody we will play against. 
"The third thing he has is awful good balance and body lean," Holtz contin­exactly what they are really going to do." 
But there is some good news for the Irish as far as Smith is concerned. Last week against Pittsburgh he pulled a hamstring and is currently listed as questionable for tomorrow's game. If Smith can't play, his replacement will be Paul Parker who has rushed for 116 yards on 19 carries. 
Navy will be going with Bob Misch at quarterback instead of Bill Byrne. Tranquill has been concerned with Byrne's tendency to throw intercep­tions in pressure situations and has decided the time has come for a change. 
Misch, a senior, has completed 11 of his 35 attempts for 124 yards, one touch­down and four interceptions this season. 
Byrne, the brother of Irish special teamer and back-up quarterback Tom Byrne, is the holder of 12 Naval Academy passing records, but this season he's thrown 10 interceptions to go with seven touchdowns and 1,109 yards while hitting 89-of-170 attempts. 
As if Smith wasn't enough of a threat on the ground, he's also Navy's leading receiver with 24 catches for 267 yards and two scores. Tight end John Sniffen has caught 17 for 189 yards. Split end Troy Saunders is a deep threat with 14 receptions for 227 yards and three touchdowns. 
When the Irish defense takes the field it will try to keep several streaks alive. The Irish have allowed no scores in three quarters, no touchdowns in five quarters, no touchdown passes in nine quarters and one rushing score in the last 13 periods. 
The Irish are allowing 119 yards on the ground to the opposition. If the Irish can shut down Navy the way they did Air Force (holding the Falcons to just 186 yards rushing), it could be a long and frustrating day for the Midship­men. The Middies, however, piled up 388 yards against Pitt, a team· which gave the Irish fits three weeks ago. 
Mike Kovaleski continues to lead Irish tacklers with 53, and Wally Kleine has 45, including six for losses totaling 11 yards. George Streeter should get the starting nod again at strong safety after making eight tackles (three for losses) and forcing a fumble against Air Force. 
Navy's defense vs. Notre Dame's offense 
On one hand, the Midshipmen are giving up a lot of points. But all those points obsure the fact that in reality, Navy's defense is pretty solid, espe­cially against the run where the Middies only allow 120 yards per game which ranks them 30th in the nation. 
"I don't look at the number of points given up by a defense," Holtz said. "I

No place like home

45 freshmen still in study lounges 
By JULIE PALAMARO Staff Reporter 
Study lounges in Grace, Flanner, and Sorin Halls are still home to 45 freshmen. 
Evelyn Reinebold, director of student residences, said she has no definite idea when the freshmen will be placed in other quarters. She added that the majority of them will have "real" rooms by second semester. At the beginning of the year, there were more than 80 freshmen living in study lounges Reinebold said. Many of them have been moved to various dorms, in­cluding Alumni, Fisher and Zahm. 
Scott Sullivan, who lives in a study lounge in Flanner Hall said, "It's a big room--good for parties." Yet living in a study lounge does have draw­backs. "It's isolated from the other rooms. We don't have a section. We have to walk through the lobby for every­thing, even to go take a shower." 
Paul Hart, who also resides in a study lounge in Flanner Hall, said, "The room itself finally feels like home, but living in a study lounge forces you to miss a lot of dorm life." 
Greg Delaune, who lives in a study lounge in Grace Hall, said his biggest worry is having to leave Grace. He wants to stay in Grace but the chances of that are slim. Ac­cording to Reinebold, where and with whom the freshmen would like to live is taken into consideration during the relocation process. The housing office cannot guaran­tee that these requests will be fufilled because rooms open up randomly. 


Reinebold said she has not had any conflicts with parents of students who are subjected to study lounge life. She said, "People have been very cooperative. And the fresh­men have been very good about the whole thing." 
In order to prevent this housing problem from occur­ing again, it has been sugges­ted that a lottery should be held to move upperclassmen off campus. Freshmen are guaranteed housing but up­perclassmen are not. Yet the University rarely, if ever, forces students off campus in order to make room for in­coming freshmen. 
In January, the 45 freshmen who presently reside in study lounges should be in "real" rooms, according to Reinebold.

SMC students to film memories for yearbook 
By DIANE SCHROEDER 
Staff Reporter 

Special moments throughout the 1986-87 school year are being preserved with the help of one video camera and three entrepeneurs at Saint Mary's College. 
Senior Michelle Coleman came up with the idea for a video yearbook over the sum­mer. 
"I wanted to provide some­thing for our class to look back on, to laugh and remember the good times," said Coleman. 
Together with seniors Lori Lohman and Karyn Ruesch, Coleman founded the Special Moments Collection corporation. Their objective is to produce at least 100 two-hour video taped yearbooks. 
The video will be comprised of a wide variety of senior ac­tivities from both the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame cam­puses. Beginning with Senior Disorientation week, the video will also include interviews with College President William Hickey and University Presi­dent Father Theodore Res­burgh. A fourth generation Saint Mary's student and a third generation Notre Dame student are also scheduled to be interviewed. 
The· tape will feature most home football games, the senior trip to Jamaica as well as events which may occur off­campus. Lohman said there may also be a open forum seg­ment consisting of student leaders from Saint Mary's and Notre Dame discussing this year's senior class. 
"We'd like to cover some off campus parties, evenings at Senior Bar, and other events," Lohman added. "Let us know when something is happening and we'll cover it!" 
Some students may have already noticed the video crew roaming the campuses for in­teresting shots. Others may not even be aware of what the cor­poration is doing. 
"We're trying to let everyone know what we're up to," said Ruesch. "Since we don't know every senior, our biggest task will be to get a fair represen­tation of the class." 
The corporation is sending out letters to all hall presidents 
to inform their sections of their 
project. Letters are also being 
sent home to all seniors and 
their parents to let them know 
that videos will be on sale 
during graduation weekend for 
$47.50 each. 
"Our goal is to reach 75 per­cent of the class and include them in the video," said Ruesch. "We use a class list to keep track of how many people have been included along the way." 
Coleman, Lohman and Ruesch are handling most of the project themselves, from the business aspect to the ac­tual taping. They will, however, hire someone to do the final editing, which will be partially put to music. 
"By March we should have 5-6 hours of video to work with," said Coleman. "It will be tough to cut it all down into a two-hour tape." 
According to the group, they have already covered a wide variety of events. 
"But we do need more funny things," added Ruesch. "We've already got so many 'hi Mom's' that we may do a 'hi Mom!' segment!'' 
Special Moments Collection has the support of both ad­ministrations and both Offices of Student Activities. Before the corporation began produc­tion, they had to first submit a written proposal explaining their objectives. The project was approved by both schools but they are an independent corporation and receive no fin­ancial aid from the schools. 
"The faculties and staffs of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame have both been very suppor­tive," said Lohman. "They have shown a lot of interest and are willing to help us out in other ways." 
Coleman and her partners can earn three business credits after giving a formal presenta­tion of their project. 
The corporation hopes to do better than breaking even after sales of the video in May. Each member put up $100 capital to cover immediate expenses. Al­though they intend to produce only 100 video tapes, Coleman expects the demand to be much 
gr~ater. 

Gorbachev plans first visit to Latin American countries 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON-Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is planning to visit Latin America, apparently in an at­tempt to penetrate peacefully an area where the United States has long been the domi­nant influence, administration officials say. 
The Soviet Communist Party General Secretary plans to visit Cuba, Moscow's closest ally in the hemisphere, and also is expected to become the first Soviet leader ever to travel to Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, the officials said. The trip, tentatively set for next spring, may include other South Amer­ican countries as well. 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze visited Mexico City three weeks ago and laid the groundwork for the Soviet-Mexican summit, accor­ding to the officials, who in­sisted on anonymity. 
Some officials described the prospective visit to Mexico as a normal development in rela­tions between the two countries. They said Mexico has long been interested in ex­panding its diplomatic horizons and that three previous Mexican presidents have visited Moscow. 
The officials added that Shevrardnadze and his Mexican hosts seemed intent on not saying anything that could be construed as hostile to the United States. 
Other officials, however, said they were concerned that the Shevardnadze talks and the prospective visit by Gorbachev raises the possibility of an ex­panded "Soviet foothold" in this hemisphere. 
A lon~-term Soviet goal in Mexico IS the opening of con­sular offices in northern Mexico, which would enable the Soviets to widen their intelligence-gathering capabi­lities in the southern United States, the officials said.

than school prayer, future gov­ernment oolicy on that issue still is difficult to predict. 
"If the state may neither ad­vance nor inhibit religion, as the Supreme Court ar~ed in 1963, no clear policy is likely to emerge," she said. 
In 1962 and 1963, ~he Supreme Court ruled that state­sponsored religious practices such as daily Bible readin~s were unconstitutional in pubhc schools because they violated the premise that government should hold a neutral position. 
Abortion stands out as the public issue most directly iden­tified with the Catholic Church, Boggs said. · 
She cited the Hyde Amend­ment, which forbids the use of Medicaid payments for abor­tion, as the most successful anti-abortion legislation to date. 
"Surely, the churches and the religious organizations as well as the scientific commu­nity members have the obliga­tion to draw moral parameters around the use of these scien­tific and technological mar­vels," she said. 
Boggs said she is one of the many political officials who "seek to preserve and enhance a religious component in public life generally." 
For example, she said Congress opens its daily ses­sions with prayers, and the marshall of the Supreme Court ritually cries out for God to save 'this honorable Court.' 
The representative said she watches the role of political 'religious rightists' with inter­est. "I have no problem with their involvement," she said. 
"And I have no problem with the modern television evan­gelists," she added. "In an ecumenical outreach in today's pluralistic society, we must ad­mit that their ministries have important roles to play." 
She said she does become concerned, however, when in­fluential religious leaders be­come too closely involved in the political outlooks of their fol­lowers. 
"I do become concerned when religious leaders begin telling their congregations that political leaders are morally beyond the pale because of their beliefs or," she added, "begin instructing their flock on how God wants them to vote for one candidate or another." 
The Notre Dame theology de­partment sponsored Boggs' lecture as part of its continuing series on religion and politics.

put their request in writing. The letter also states that any freshman or sophomore who is financially independent may request, also in writing, that deficiency notices not be sent to her parents. 
Parents and students received the same letter but the one sent home to the parents had a detachable response sheet for parent reaction. 
Marcy said it is still too early to tell how parents will respond but expects most parents will not want to receive the notices. 
Originally, the new policy was to include sophomores, juniors and seniors. Marcy said sophomores tend to have un­realistic expectations about their majors and may need the warning that a deficiency notice serves. The policy will be re-evaluated after a few years, to assess any problems. 
So far, Marcy said, there has been no student response to the letter.

Congress's power at crossroad: professor 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI Assistant News Editor 
With the United States moving into a post-industrial era, congressional power is at a crossroads in history at which its power may increase or decrease, according to Lawrence Dodd, professor of political science at the Univer­sity of Colorado. 
Dodd, the Director of the Center for the Study of America Politics at the Univer­sity of Colorado, spoke in the Hayes-Healy Center on Thursday. His lectue, entitled "Congress and the Post­Industrial Transformation" was part of the Exxon Distin­guished Visiting Scholar Se­ries. 
Dodd said that during the 1960s and 1970s, the country went through a "revolution" in. which high technology replaced traditional manufac­turing industries, creating a post-industrial society. 
Dodd, who has published two books about government, said in the past such revolutions in society have affected the career patterns of congress­men. 
"What we see in the past is that great periods of social up­heaval that are also connected with great economic and agenda shifts in society have tended to produce new kinds of calculations on the part of am­bitious politicians giving rise to new kinds of career patterns," Dodd said. 
He said these career patterns affect the institutions of gov­ernment. 
Dodd said he sees two possi­bilities for the future of Congress. "There is a dark side and a light side to all these projections," he said. 
On the dark side, Dodd said policy restraints will become more severe as natural re­sources diminish, the United States moves from a manufac­turing to a service economy and foreign competition in high-technology areas in­creases. 
In this high-tech society, Dodd said, politicians would have a better chance of re­election. "Ambitious politicians will continue to stay in Congress and a high-tech so­ciety will reinforce their ability because incumbents will have an increasing number of high­tech related resources," such as mass case work activity for constituents, mass mailing lists and mass transportation. 
He added that this will decrease the turnover in Congress, which will make power in Congress more frag­mented, thereby immobilizing the ability of Congress to act. 
On the "light side," Dodd said high technology, because of the increased role of the mass media, will make elec­tions more competitive. This would mean most congressmen will occupy office for fewer years and therefore not be able to gain as much power, he said. 
According to Dodd, the few congressmen who are able to remain in office for many years power and therefore make congress a powerful and effec­tive body. 
Dodd said he sees the changes taking place today as part of a historical process of political change that has oc­curred in the United States and other countries.

Vatican condemns pro-gay views 
Associated Press 
VATICAN CITY-The Vatican instructed bishops Thursday to stamp out pro­homosexual views within the Roman Catholic church and op­pose any attempt to condone homosexuality through legisla­tion or other means. 
In a letter to the bishops ap­proved by Pope John Paul II, it accused pro-homosexual groups of "deceitful propaganda" and trying to gain a foothold in the church, which has 810 million followers. 
"Increasing numbers of people, even within the church, are bringing enormous pres­sure to bear on the church to accept the homosexual condi­tion as though it were not dis­ordered and to condone homosexual activity," it said. 
The Vatican told the bishops and priests not to support or­ganizations that "seek to un­dermine the teaching of the church (on homosexuality), which are ambiguous about it, or which neglect it entirely.'' 
The 15-page letter was dated Oct. 1 and made public Thursday. It was drawn up by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the watchdog of doctrinal devia­tion headed by West German­born Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. 
He said the letter was being sent because the controversy about homosexuality "even in Catholic circles" has become a matter of "sufficiently grave and widespread importance.'' 
An Italian homosexual ri~hts group named Fuori (Outside) issued a statement calling the church document "just a futile attempt to force discrimination by those who, perhaps because of love based on true faith, have discovered tolerance." 
In its instructions, Ratzinger's agency reiterated the Vatican position that homosexual acts are sins. "An overly benign interpretation" has been given to the homosexual condition, which "must be seen as an objective disorder," it asserted. 
Prelates in some countries, including the United States, have struggled with govern­ment authorities over homosexual rights. 

CapSUle tamperer sentenced to 27 years 
Associated Press 
ORLANDO, Fla.-A man was sentenced Thursday to 27 years in prison for putting rat poison in over-the-counter drugs to make money in the stock op­tions market. 
Edward Marks had pleaded guilty Aug. 26 to putting the poison in Contac, Dietac and Teldrin medications produced by SmithKline Beckman of Philadelphia. 
He admitted to anonymously calling police and news organ­izations to tell them of the tam­pering, with the intention of making the price of the compa­ny's stock plunge. 
"Through your utter dis­regard you have had a tremen­dous impact on consumer con­fidence in medicines," said 

U.S. district Judge Patricia Fawsett. "You and you alone are responsible for your ac­tions." 
She said the scheme had cost SmithKline $41 million, with only $25 million of that paid by the company's insurers. 
Because of the size of the amount, however, she did not ask for restitution, assessing him instead only the manda­tory $450 for court costs. 
Marks, who faced a maxi­mum 54 years in prison, had asked Fawsett for mercy and was "very disappointed" by the sentence, said his court­appointed attorney, Jay Stevens. 
"We were hoping for a sen­tence that was much less," said Stevens, who had recom­mended five to eight years. He said because of the ~ty plea it would be very difficult to ap­peal the sentence.

Considering fundamentalism requires open mind 
In recent years, fundamentalist religions have been experiencing a resurgence in America. Stressing fam­ily values, patriotism and anti­communism, preachers continuously

grace our televisions and newspapers. If you have ever watched cable televi­sion, you have undoubtedly seen the likes of Jerry Falwell or Jimmy Swag­gart bemoaning the fate of mankind. But lately these self-acclaimed spokes­
men of God have left the TV screen and entered into the arenas of education and politics. 
In the past week, a Tennessee judge ruled that a group of parents opposed to the readings of the local public school had the right to educate their children at home, rather than expose them to differing viewpoints. Various readings were desi~nated as offensive; "Mac­beth" for tts references to the occult, "The Wizard of Oz" for its portrayal of positive witchcraft, scientific readings on evolution, and "The Diary of Anne Frank" for its portrayal of all religions as equal. The fundamentalist tide has also swept into politics under the guise of presidential hopeful Pat Robertson. He has referred to himself as God's cho­sen candidate and he has supposedly communicated with Him on various is­sues. Robertson's campaign has caused splits in both the Republican party and the various fundamentalist sects. 

Along with much of the nation, I first reacted to these developments with dis­belief and outrage. Academic freedom and separation of church and state are two of the pillars upon which this country stands. However common sense and a little rational thought soon prevailed. At a university such as Notre Dame, I am constantly exposed to dif­ferent viewpoints, and not a single one of them is the absolute. Whether it be politics, religion, philosophy, or educa­tion, it is my duty to investigate every different ideology. The fundamentalist concept is just another one of these ideologies. If I were to heatedly con­demn it, I would be sinking to their level of closed-mindedness. The problem arises in that this is not just a political viewpoint to these people, but their belief in God. If someone were to start criticizing my Catholic beliefs, I might react with just as much vehemence as

SDI can't stand in way of reduction proposals 
Dear Editor: 
For a moment, the world blinked in disbelief. On the negotiating table, in Reykjavik, Iceland, was an unprece­dented Soviet proposal designed for bilateral nuclear disarmament. Mter considerable exchange between Presi­dent Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev, our president rejected this proposal on the grounds that his Stra­tegic Defense Initiative (SDD was not negotiable. 
One has to wonder if building SDI is more important to the administration than meaningful arms control. Never had both sides considered such sweep­ing reductions as those proposed. All Soviet and U.S. missiles would be removed from Europe. The number of Soviet and U.S. strategic missiles would be cut by 50 percent. At the same time medium range missiles based in the U.S. and Soviet Asia would be cut to 100 per side, and phased out com­pletely by 1996. The Soviets have pro­posed this at a time when they have not tested any nuclear weapons for over 14 months. The only obstacle in the way was and still is an untested and un­proven program which extends the arms race into space. 
President Reagan claims the scien­tific community supports SDI. This is true only if we exclude the thousands of science and engineering faculty who have pledged not to participate in any 
Doonesbury 

Star Wars research. In fact, their pledge states that Star Wars is "ill­conceived, dangerous and will only serve to escalate tthe nuclear arms race." 
If we should continue to research and develop SDI for deployment within the next 10 years, the only possible Soviet response is to find an even better way to combat the proposed defense system. One simple response would be to build up their offensive arsenal to even greater numbers so that even a highly accurate defense system would still not be able to prevent the destruction of the United States. Further, SDI is de­signed solely to defend against land based intercontinental ballistic mis­siles. It would not provide defense against Soviet submarine launched missiles, bomber planes, or SS-20 mis­siles. This unacceptable approach to our defense and security would cost 
U.S. taxpayers up to $1 trillion over the next 10 years. 
Two months ago, the House passed genuine arms control measures to curb the Reagan Administration's furious and dangerous military buildup. In preparation for the summit, the presi­dent demanded that the House concede on all of these arms control measures. Late last week the House acceded to his demand. Why? Because our presi­dent wanted to enter the superpower negotiations with Congress united be­hind him. With his hands no longer tied by Congress, President Reagan still came home empty-handed. 
The Soviet proposal for bilateral nu­clear disarmament still stands. We can not in good conscience let SDI stand in the way of deep arms reductions. We must demand that President Reagan go back to the negotiating table this year and accept their offer.

Rambo mentality letter must have been a farce 
Dear Editor: 
Intelligent satire is often taken literally or otherwise misunderstood, and so I am concerned that some may have thought that Dean Waddick's recent Observer letter (0ct.29) was serious and on the level. If so, they will have arrived at the conclusion-­definitely facile and erroneous--that the Dean is some sort of Rambo, who really means to slur pacifists and war resisters as simple cowards. Of course, this can hardly be the case, and it should be clear to the perceptive and sensitive reader that Dean Waddick really intended to write a parody of the Rambo mentality. 
Anyone who doubts this need only look again, with an eye for pathos, at Dean Waddick's brilliant and provoca­tive, but obviously farcical, compari­son of ROTC with the Peace Corps and the Holy Cross Associates. He might indeed have gone even further in this

the fundamentalists are now. 
Therefore in criticizing these groups, I am in fact criticizing their very reason for life on earth. When approaching re­ligion, one must tread very lightly. Emotion should not enter into religious arguments, and it is important to listen to the other side and argue against their points rationally. The fundamentalist movement may be strong now, but it will pass soon enough. Another religion will come and replace it, over which there will be numerous controversies. Even our Catholic faith may fade away someday. But no matter what the reli­gion, one must keep an open mind in discussing it and remember this is a person's faith that is being attacked.

amusing vein, and spoken of our "napalm aid" to Southeast Asia, or of our assistance to the citizens of Dres­den in the area of "population control"; but, at a time when President Reagan refers to supermissiles as peacekeepers and Father Hesburgh supports South Mrican investment as the Christian thing to do, perhaps it is well enough to leave the device of ironic euphemism to the accomplished masters. 
Equally worthy of praise was Dean Waddick's reference to praying in front of the Clarke Memorial, in preference to doing so before a memorial to cowards. This was a masterful touch and a very effective spoof of the phe­nomenon of American civil religion; indeed, this one comment could be re­garded as an adequate summary of the research of Richey, Bellah and others. Again, one might have expected the remark to be rounded out a bit, with the customary references to pansies and quiche-eaters or with some sort of lament about the demise of John Wayne. But then, these would have been the obvious remarks to attribute to those whom Dean Waddick wishes to imitate and lampoon, and under­statement is more thought-provoking in the long run. 
To sum up, it seems that in Dean Waddick we have another Swift or Horace, and I am sure I speak for many others in lauding his penetrating wit.

Tway takes opening-round match while Watson is ousted at Tucson 
Associated Press 
TUCSON, Ariz.-Bob Tway advanced easily, but Tom W at­son was upset yesterday in the first round of the Seiko Tucson Match Play Championship. 
Tway, already assured of PG A player of the Year honors, moved closer to the money­winning title with his 68-75 vic, tory over Brett Upper in the final official event on the 10­month PGA tour. 
Watson, who disqualified himself for an inadvertent breach of the rules last week in San Antonio, Tex., was ousted by David Edwards 66­72. 
Tway now needs only a win over Steve Pate in today's second round to clinch the money-winning title. 
Tway, who won the PGA na­tional championship and three other titles this season, needs $5,517 to surpass Greg Nor­man's leading $635,296. A second-round victory will as­sure Tway of a minimum $12,500. Norman is not compet­ing in this event. 
"It would mean a lot to me to go past Greg," Tway said. "But if I don't, it won't be the end of the world. I'll get over it. 
"The system is kind of strange, and it makes you feel kind of strange out there playing. You know you can play a good round, a 68, and still lose by five shots,'' Tway said of the medal-match format in which each player must complete each hole and the winner of a match is dc~ermined by an 18­hole medal score. 
Pate, Tway's second-round opponent, was 7-under par through the first 14 holes and eventually beat Craig Stadler 65-68. 

Bernhard Langer, the former Masters champion from West Germany, lost to Bob Gilder 66-68. 
Ben Crensnaw, ,, ho scored his second victory of the season last week in San Antonio, con­tinued his strong play in a 66-73 decision over Fred Couples. 
Defending champion Jim Thorpe also advanced, 68-70 over Brad Faxon. 
In the separate bracket for seniors, defending champion Harold Henning birdied -his first three holes and beat AI Chandler 69-75. 
South Mrican Gary Player was upset by Jim King 70-71. 
Hurricanes attempt to stay on top as they take on rival Florida State 
Associated Press 
CORAL GABLES, Fla.-Part of the reason the Miami Hur­ricanes are 7-0 and atop the na­tional rankings is they enter every game expecting to win and play as if fearing to lose. 
"We can't go into any game thinking that we're the better team," star quarterback Vinnie Testaverde said, "because we don't know if the other team knows that we're a better team." 
The Hurricanes waste little time proving their point. They have outscored their opponents 105-3 in the first quarter. 
The Hurricanes' least im­pressive performance came in the opener against Florida, the one team they always are fired up to play. Miami won that game 23-15 although Tes­taverde was slowed by a nastycold. 
Three weeks later, the Hur­ricanes manhandled then-No.1 Oklahoma 28-16 in the Orange Bowl. Only a last minute touch­down by the Sooners made the score respectable. 
Equally impressive have been lopsided victories over teams Miami should beat easily-61-11 over Texas Tech, 34-0 over Northern Illinois, 58­14 over West Virginia, 45-13 over Cincinnati. 

That easy part of the schedule ends tomorrow when the Hurricanes face 20th­ranked Florida State, 4-2-1, in the Orange Bowl. Then they play at Pittsburgh, and close with Tulsa at home. 
Defensive tackle Jerome Brown sometimes rankles Coach Jimmy Johnson with his outlandish statements, but he sounds like a coach's dream when he explains Miami's abil­ity to play well every time out. 
"Every game is tough for us," he said. "We don't treat anyone any differently than we did Oklahoma. 
"Sometimes we see some of the younger players joking around during practice and we have to get on them. We're a loose team and everybody wants to have fun, but we have 
to remind them we've got a job to do." 
Johnson said he hasn't had to do a lot to instill that attitude in his players. He suspects the embarrassing 35-7 loss to Ten­nessee in the Sugar Bowl last New Year's Day with the na­tional title on the line had some­thing to do with it. 
"This group has the best at­titude of any football team I've ever been around," he said.

Wade selected new Terps' coach after Driesell steps down under fire 
Associated Press 
BALTIMORE-Bob Wade, coach and athletic director at Baltimore's Dunbar High School, yesterday was named basketball coach at the Univer­sity of Maryland, replacing Charles "Lefty" Driesell. 
Maryland Chancellor John B. Slaughter, who made the an­nouncement, said, "The Uni­versity of Maryland has had a dearth of happy events over the last several months. Today represents a major change in our fortunes." 
Driesell, under pressure to give up his coaching post fol­lowing the June 19 cocaine­induced death of basketball star Len Bias, resigned Wed­nesday and accepted a job as assistant athletic director at the university. 
Wade, 41, who was accompa­nied by his wife and one of his two sons, said his elevation to college basketball coach represents "something we looked forward to all of our lives." 

A graduate of Morgan State in Baltimore, Wade has posted a 280-19 record during 10 seasons at Dunbar. 
"It couldn't have happened to a better guy,'' said Lake Clif­ton High School Coach Woody Williams, a long-time friend of Wade's. 
Wade has had a running feud with Driesell through the years. Wade claimed the Maryland coach would not recruit in Baltimore, while Driesell complained that Wade directed his best players to Georgetown University in Washington. 
Pete Pompey, coach at Ed­mondson High School, said Wade never prevented Driesell from recruiting at Dunbar. He said Wade also has a strict phi­losophy about his players' aca­demic performance and use of drugs. 
"He made a commitment a long time that his kids were going to get an education," Pompey said. "He's disagreed with some of the things that he (Driesell) did." 
But Pompey added that Wade "feels Len Bias was an adult and he made a decision to" take the cocaine that killed him. 
"He has made a statement that he would be tougher on (drug use)," Pompey said .. 
The state prosecutor inves­tigating Bias' death charged that Driesell did too little to dis­courage drug use and gave in­sufficient attention to the aca­demic needs of his players. 
Driesell, who coached / 17 seasons at Maryland and com­piled a 524-224 record, was one of 17 Division I coaches with more than 500 victories. He told reporters Wednesday he didn't 
want  to  coach  at  Maryland  
anymore  if  the  university  
didn't want him.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.­Aaron Broten, who scored with 
1: 14 to play to force overtime, scored again with 38 seconds left in the extra period, lifting the New Jersey Devils to 7-6 NHL victory over the New York Islanders last night. 
Broten broke into the Islanders' zone on a 2-on-1 break with Pat Verbeek and banked his game-winning shot off the leg of Islanders defen­seman Denis Potvin. It ap­peared the shot would not have gone into the net had it not hit the Islanders' captain. 
Broten sent the game into overtime by scoring 74 seconds before the end of regulation time. He collected the rebound of a Kirk Muller shot and slid a 10-foot backhander under Islanders goalie Kelly Hrudey. 
The loss snapped a four­game unbeaten streak by New York, which had won its last three games and appeared headed for a fourth after Pat

Championship meet at Cleveland State. 
"We have a large s~uad," Welsh said. "The addition of the Eastern Collegiates makes it possible for almost everyone to get a chance to swim in a '!hampionship meet.'' 
A tough spot in the Notre Dame schedule will come up after semester break. The team will travel to Philadel­phia to take on LaSalle and Vil­lanova on January 16th and 17th. The following weekend, it will swim against Northern Il­linois, Western Ontario, Northwestern, and Minnesota. Before Christmas, the most dif­ficult meet is probably this week's Denison matchup. 
Next weekend, the Irish will swim in the 22nd annual Notre Dame Relays against teams in­cluding Eastern Illinois, Illinois-Chicago, and Val­paraiso. 

LaFontaine scored twice and Bryan Trottier once late in the second period for a 6-4 lead. 
However, New Jersey pulled to within 6-5 at 6: 10 of the per­iod when Verbeek got his lOth goal with the Islanders a man shorthanded. It was the Devils' fourth power-play goal of the game, and ninth in 15 power play opportunities over the past two nights. 
New York opened a 3-1lead after the first period on goals by Patrick Flatley, Mike Bossy and Potvin sandwiched around a New Jersey power-play goal by Mark Johnson, who had two goals and two assists. 
New Jersey stormed back to take a 4-3 lead less than 11 min­utes into the second period. John MacLean scored on a power play at 2:54 and Mel Bridgman tied the game, tip­ping a 50-foot shot by Johnson past Hrudey at 6:08. Johnson scored his second with New Jer­sey playing shorthanded at 10:53. 
LaFontaine tied the game just 37 seconds later, and he

Philly and Washington begin new NBA _season with new-look squads 
Associated Press 
The Philadelphia 76ers and Washington Bullets will put drastically changed teams on the floor when the NBA opens its 41st season tonight with nine games. 
The 76ers, who traded Moses Malone, Terry Catledge and the first pick in the 1986 draft, entertain the Indiana Pacers and their new coach, Jack Ramsay, while the Bullets travel to Boston, where the Cel­tics open defense of the NBA title they won in June. 
Among the new faces for Philadelphia and Coach Matt Guokas are Jeff Ruland, Roy Hinson, Cliff Robinson and Tim McCormick, who join Charles Barkley on the front line. Guard Andrew Toney, back from last season's injuries, will team with holdovers Julius Er­
ving,  Maurice  Cheeks  and  
Sedale  Threatt  in  the back­ 
court.  

"I haven't come to Philadel­phia to make people forget Moses Malone," the 6-foot-11 Ruland said. "I'm here to do a job and help the 76ers win. That's all I care about. 
"I know people will compare us. That's OK. Moses is a great player, but I consider myself a great player, too. Coach

BP, Farley make finals 
By CHRIS LEUPOLD Sports Writer 
It definitely was a wild one at Cartier Field last night. Breen-Phillips' miraculous comeback victory over Pasquerilla East allows the winners to take on first game victor Farley in the women's Interhall Football champion­ship. 
The first half score of the second game saw Pasquerilla East leading, 6-0, thanks to a Colleen O'Connor four-yard run up the middle. Both teams' offenses, however, began to move more effectively in the deciding half. 
On Pasquerilla's first posses­sion in the second half, speedy Annie Schrenk found an open lane and scored from 11 yards out. Down 12-0, the Tigers of Breen-Phillips found their roar. Quarterback Amy Treeder hit receiver Margaret Johnson for a 58-yard touch­down pass. 
The score stood 12-6 in favor of Pasquerilla East with just 15 seconds remaining in the game, with Breen-Phillips on its own 25-yard line, when Treeder skippered an in­credible comeback. In her hurry-up offense, she con­nected with Angie Williams for a 40-yard gain, and then hit Carolyn Burke with a 35-yard bomb for the tying touchdown. 
The crowd was in a frenzy as overtime began. Each team would receive two plays to score from the five-yard line. Both teams scored, making the tally 16-16. 
The aggressive defensive line of Breen-Phillips, led by tackle Kathy Tammaro, then stifled both of Pasquerilla's next attempts at running the ball in. On the Tigers' posses­sion, Williams coasted into the endzone, sealing an 18-16 vic­tory. The dejected and bewil­dered bench of Pasquerilla East saw its season end when the jubulant Tigers of Breen­Phillips swarmed the field. 
Though not quite as dramatic as the game to follow, the Lyons-Farley match-up saw Mary Lou Armeida's mastery of running Farley's offense lead to a 12-0 victory. 
After a scoreless first half which saw Lyons neutralizing the Farley offensive machine, Suzanne Schwartz ran around the right end to put Farley ahead, 6-0. After Armeida and Lyons quarterback Mary Boh­mer traded downs and series with neither making any scoring threat, Armeida pitched to Schwartz, who ran for her second score, a 35-yard burst. This proved to be the last score in the game and resulted in a 12-0 shutout victory for Farley. 
"The girls from both teams played great," said Farley coach Dave Hanes. · Both Farley and Breen­Phillips will be ready for the championship game, which should be a dandy. It will be a contest between the devastat­ing offense of Farley and the strong defense of BreeD­Phillips. 
The championship game for women's Interhall Football will be under the lights of Car­tier Field, at 7 p.m. Sunday.

Stanford is entering IH By CHRIS DALLAVO Sports Writer Fall Break is over, leaves are all over the ground and football is in the air-men's interhall football, that is. The 1986 playoffs are about to begin, with undefeated Stanford Hall the overwhelming favorite to capture the crown. Stanford, led by 9uarterback AI Martin, is the frrst seed in the six-team playoff system. Despite the domination of the Studs during the year, they ex­pect to face some tough com­petition during the post season. "We appreciate the respect of the other coaches and teams, but we are taking nothing for granted," said assistant coach Jay Landry. "There are a lot of good football teams left." Martin leads the balanced  favored playoffs back to old-time football, as both teams feature strong run­ning games and solid defenses. "We are looking for a defen­sive struggle," said Howard head coach Tom Brennan. ''We have improved vastly in all areas, especially our running game. We like to stick to the basics." Steve Dembrowski, head coach of Zahm, agrees. "Our defense is our strong point," he said. "All year they have kept us in ballgames, and kept the pressure to score a lot of points off of the offense." The winner of this game, to be played at 1 p.m. on Sunday on Stepan Field, will take on Stanford in the semi-finals. The second game will be a rematch of the final regular season game between Flanner and Parseghian Division champion Morrissey. Flanner  swim coach Tim Welsh said. "We're pleased with recruit­ing. It's a very challenging s.chedule. The whole scoring system has changed, so we'll have to see." Notre Dame starts its season tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. in the Rolfs Aquatic Center against a tough Denison squad. A current Division III power, Denison has moved up in the rankings every year for the past few years un­der last year's Division III Coach of the Year, Richard Burrows. "It's really an excellent pro­gram," Welsh said. "Because of all the scoring changes, it means we really don't know what will happen. It's definitely a huge difference." Last year in NCAA swim competition, a first-place finish was worth five points, a second added three, while a third netted one. This year, the first five places will be worth seven, four, three, two, and one point  Therefore, a team which takes second, third, and fourth out­scores a first, fifth, and sixth finisher. Changes in relay scores fur­ther alter the complexion of meet strategy. Last year a relay victory would give a team seven points ; the losers received none. This year, in a large meet, the first place team will receive nine points, with four for second, and two for third. The Irish swimming and diving team has added a num­ber of freshman to its ranks. The diving team hopes to be­come competitive this year with four new additions. Ed Veome, a Notre Dame Scholar from LaGrange Park, Ill., joins the team along with fellow freshmen Nick Farmer, a na­tive of Fort Meyers, Fla., and Richard Zell from Chappaqua, New York. Junior Tom Browne has also made a switch to diving. Mike Messaglia will take the  to the Irish distance corps. ''Bill J ackoboice will be a tre­mendous asset to our sprinting corps in both freestyle and fly events," Welsh said. "His ver­satility will really help. He can also swim the breaststroke. The key thing is he's really fast up front." David Vreeland of West Palm Beach will compete in the Individual Medley and, with Tom Penn, in the freestyle events. Welsh looks for Penn to better his times considerably. "His time jumps in high school were significant," Welsh said. "He's a talented swimmer-and a good student of his own ability. He's easy to coach." Led by captains Stephen Cof­fey and Chris Walsh, Notre Dame is starting competition a month earlier than last year and has almost twice as many meets. The Irish have also just joined the Eastern Collegiate see SWIM, page 12
