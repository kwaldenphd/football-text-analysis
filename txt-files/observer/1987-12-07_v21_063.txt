Protests in USSR and U.S. occur as summit nears 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Soviet and American officials, on the eve of Mikhail Gorbachev's arrival in Washington, hinted Sunday that a compromise on "Star Wars" testing is possible, while a massive demonstration in the 
U.S. capital and a violence­marred protest in Moscow un­derscored differences on human rights. 
Thirteen months after the breakup of the last superpower summit, Gorbachev heads to Washington on Monday for three days of talks with Presi­_dent Reagan and the signing of a treaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles (INF) over three years. 

Both le~ders say they are op­timistic about making progress toward a bolder agreement to cut long-range strategic nu­clear weapons by half, paving the way for another summit by next June in Moscow. 

Acknowleding a shift in the once rigid Soviet opposition to Reagan's "Star Wars" missile defense plan, known formally as the Stategic Defense Initia­tive, White House chief of staff Howard Baker said the Krem­lin's position "now is a little dif­ferent than it appears to have been a few weeks or a few months ago." 
Interviewed on NBC's "Meet the Press," Baker predicted that Gorbachev would move forward on strategic-weapon cuts "perhaps without requir­ing as a precondition that the president abandon SDI or reduce SDI or postpone SDI, which he's not going to do." 
Meanwhile, a crowd esti­mated by police in the range of 200,000 took part-in a demonstration march and rally in Washington to press for free emigration of Soviet Jews. 
Led by author Elie Wiesel and Soviet emigre Natan Sharansky, the demonstrators carried signs asking "Where is glasnost for Soviet Jews?" and flags emblazoned with the Star of David. Some carried ban­ners with the names of people refused permission to leave the Soviet Union. 

"No camps and prisons can extinguish the light and candle of freedom," Sharansky told the crowd. 
Reagan did not attend the rally, but he pledged his sup-

In Brief 
Robert Bork, former Supreme Court nominee, may leave the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to join the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, according to a published report. Newsweek, in its latest issue, quoted sources close to Bork as saying he is preparing to give up his court seat, possibly by the end of the year. The magazine reported that Bork has told friends that he is bored with the administrative law cases that dominate the court docket. -Associated Press 
Eighty-nine percent of the Soviet people and 83. 
percent of Americans believe there would be no winner 
in an all-out nuclear war between the superpowers, accor­
ding to a poll released Sunday. The poll, sponsored jointly 
by Newsweek magazine and the Soviet press agency 
Novosti, also revealed that majorities of American and 
Soviet citizens feel positively toward the other side, al­
though each remains wary of the other side's system of 
government. -Associated Press 
Dieters who can hold the line -the waistline, that is -during the holiday season are winners in the weight-loss game. So many people have trouble sticking to diets after Dec. 15, according to an article in the current issue of Cosmopolitan, that diet counselors now advise just tread­ing water over the holidays. The Christmas season is a time of heightened emotions for most people, said Sybil Ferguson, founder of Diet Center, and feeling either happy or sad can make you eat more. There's one piece of good news for dieters. They can dive into the holiday turkey because there are only 187 calories in four ounces of light meat turkey with the skin on, and only 160 calories in dark meat without the skin. -Associated Press

similar practices are also at risk and need counseling, re­searchers at the conference said. 
Until a cure for the disease is found, Gottlieb said, the best way to slow or halt the spread of AIDS is to tell people how it is transmitted. 
"It's hoped of course that these strategies will allow con­tinued expression of the most basic human feelings," he added. "There are moralistic forces in our society which would have us believe that human sexuality causes AIDS, and of course this is not true. 
"It's important to distinguish between measures and strate­gies which encourage appro­priate AIDS awareness from those which seek to limit sexual expression on religious or moral grounds." 
Cooperation among scientific disciplines has helped resolve other problems, said Bruce Voeller, president of the Mariposa Education and Re­search Foundation, a sex re­search group based in Topanga, Calif. 
The Kinsey symposium, "AIDS and Sex: An Integrated Biomedical and Biobehavioral Approach," featured about 70 researchers and specialists in the disease and is slated to con­tinue until Tuesday at the In­diana University Memorial Union.  
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a viral disease (with no known cure) that dis­ables the body's immune sys­tem, making victims suscepti­ble to a variety of illnesses. It is found most commonly in male homosexuals, who trans­mit the virus through anal sex, and in intravenous drug users who share infected needles. 
About 40,000 people have been diagnosed with AIDS, ac­cording to the Federal Centers for Disease Control, and more than half that number have died. 
A theme of the conference is that the disease is spread primarily through sexual be­haviors, and that doctors need the help of social scientists to learn from victims about their sexual practices to understand how AIDS is transmitted. Many

In Moscow, more than 200 plainclothes security agents roughed up Jewish activists and journalists during rival demonstrations for and against Kremlin policy. 
"In the Soviet Union, they don't treat human beings in the way we think they ought to," Secretary of State George Shultz said. 
However, Georgi Arbatov, a Kremlin specialist on Ameri­can affairs, said "there are a lot of people" trying to "throw sand into the wheels" of the summit and prevent it from happening. 
Human rights is one of four items on the summit agenda, along with regional conflicts such as Afghanistan, Nicaragua and the Persian Gulf, bilateral relations and arms control.

"It is necessary to ensure sig­nificantly more effective guarantee of the rights of the accused to a defense," Terebilov said. 
He said lawyers should be better trained and better paid and defendants should have the right to a lawyer as soon as they are charged. 
Under present Soviet law, a defendant is not entitled to a lawyer until investigation of the case is complete. That can take months. 
Terebilov also called for new laws limiting pretrial detention to six months, and only for un­specified serious offenses.

The grant supports a full-time director and secretary and helps fund individual programs associated with the office, lo­cated at room 210 in LaFortune Student Center, Dannison added. 
One of the new office's con­crete plans is to soon use the results of the alcohol and drug survey which was mailed to 1500 random students recently, .Dannison said. 
Questions on the survey dealt with amounts of drugs and al­cohol consumed, types of drugs used, and its relationship to school performance. Students were asked to estimate their drug and alcohol usage over the current semester as well as the two previous semesters. 
''There has been some fear that the survey had been an in­vestigative tool," said Dan­nison. "We are simply inter­ested in getting a finger on the pulse of the student community in terms of what they do and don't do." 
"It is the furthest thing from our intention to single out any student individually,'' Dan­nison said, adding "Equally important is that the student is protected by reseach ethics, federal law, and the campus Human Subjects policy from being exposed." 
Because the surveys are still in the process of being turned in, no results are yet available. There will also be second and third mailings for the survey. "We need to have as high percentage of response as oos­sible," said Dannison. 
The survey will help guide 
the efforts of the office, which 
will be open Monday through 
Friday from 8:30a.m.-5 p.m., 
according to Dannison.

Seniors should consider volunteer work 
Editor's  Note:  The  following  is  the  
second in  a  monthly series from  the  
Center for Social Concerns.  

As the end of the first semester ap­proaches, seniors are really beginning to think about what they want to do with the next few years of their lives. Many Notre Dame students at least consider volunteer work. Four years at Notre Dame help students realize how much they have been given, and how much less so many other people have. Volun­teer programs are one way that we can share our gifts and talents with others who have not had all the advantages we have had. Volunteer programs come in a wide range of "shapes and sizes." Not every program is for every person, but if you look hard enough you are bound to find one that fits your person­ality, talents, goals, and expectations­-a program that challenges you while expanding your horizons and perspec­tives in directions you wish to pursue. 
Lisa Meyer Beth Thompson Byran Maddox 
guest column 
We would like to tell you about the volunteer program which we are cur­rently a part of--the Academia Cristo Rey Program. Academia Cristo Rey is a Catholic, co-educational school in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The fundamental purpose of this program is to help Spanish-speaking students in grades 1-6 learn the basics of English, Puerto Rico's second language. 
This is the first year for the Academia Cristo Rey program, so it is not yet very structured. While this can be ex­tremely frustrating at times, it also gives us an enormous amount of input. Within certain boundaries we are free to make the program into what we want--we can shape the program to fit the needs and opportunities we per­ceive. The school is very open to sug­gestions, and almost anything is worth a try; if it does not work, you just try something else! People with a lot of great ideas, and a lot of patience, can really put their creativity to work. We figure a lot out as we go along, but when something finally clicks we feel as if we have conquered the whole world. 
Each of us has our own set of reasons for being here, but common threads seem to run through our decisions. Something about the program just 
Doonesbury 
stuck in our minds and would not let go. Part of it was the challenge of start­ing and establishing a new program. Another major factor was the location. Puerto Rico allows one to go outside the continental United States and expe­rience a Latin American environment, while its commonwealth status allows one to retain at least some of the se­curity of the States. Despite the inevi­table adjustment, the idea of being im­mersed in a new culture was definitely appealing. The cultural aspect gives one the chance to learn and experience new customs, to see new places and do things one might never have a chance to do otherwise; and it is an opportunity to force oneself to learn and speak the Spanish language. 
But the cultural benefits run much deeper than this. Intercultural interac­tion is a valuable and important step in breaking down the barriers that often exist between people of different back­grounds. By working together, people learn to value their differences instead of fearing them. It is hard to understand how people feel until you have been through similar experiences yourself. Programs outside the U.S. give one a chance to experience being on the other side--the outside--and seeing the world from a different perspective. 
The Hispanic population in the U.S. continues to grow at an enormous rate, and Latin America continues to draw increasing world concern in areas of social justice, politics, economics, etc. Working in Puerto Rico gives one a chance to experience something of this different way of life, it gives one a chance to do at least a little bit to change things, even if it only helps a small group of people and may only visibly help one or two. Puerto Rico may not be the roughest or neediest place "south of the border;" it is a lot more "Americanized" than we had ex­pected, but it is still behind the times. Beyond the affluent tourist areas, Puerto Rico has a long way to go, and education is the key to progress. 
As with most programs, the Academia Cristo Rey Program is not for everyone. You have to love children, and it helps if you are extremely pa­tient. (Don't worry--if you are not when you get here you will be by the time you leave!) The kids are the great. Oh, they have their days, but every time you start to wonder why you came here and why you stay, one of them will kiss you or smile at you, or a parent will come up and tell you how much their son or daughter loves you and cannot

stop talking about you--and you know why you are here. You cannot help feeling in love with them! We were in­itially taken aback to find that the school is in a more (relatively) middle class neighborhood rather than in the lower class setting we expected. If your heart is set on working in extreme poverty you probably will not be satisfied here--but these children need us too. And, again, the program is still in its developing stages. Right now, we are trying to incorporate outside com­munity service into the program, thereby expanding the program's ser­vice component and adding at least the option of working with the very poor. Hopefully, we can establish this at year's end. 
The program has great potential and numerous possibilities. It is still some­what unstructnred. which some poeple may not like, but people with enthusi­asm and ideas can do so much with it. Volunteer work may not always be the most prestigious choice in the eyes of the world, but think about it. It is a way to incorporate your faith and your values into your life. Whether you do it for God or for the world or for yourself, it is only one year of your life, and chances are you will get so much more out of it than you could ever give. And if you don't do it now, when your life is relatively free of commitments, you probably never will. Just think about it. (We would be happy to answer any and all questions. You may contact us through Mary Ann Roemer at the Cen­ter for Social Concerns.) 
Lisa Meyer, Beth Thompson and Byran Maddox are 1987 graduates of Notre Dame, now working in Puerto Rico.

ou are feeling sleepy. You are in a deep, deep sleep. On the count of three everyone on stage will become a duck-­quacking is the only way you can communicte with anyone. On the count of three you will ask the person next to you when the flock is heading south for winter. Wait, what's this? I just found out that one of the ducks is having a birthday today. Flap your wings and quack Happy Birthday to him." 
Tonight you too will have an opportunity to become a duck. Hypnotist Gary Conrad will be performing at 9 p.m. in Washington Hail, sponsored by the Student Union Board. 
The duck routine is just one of a number of "experiments" which Conrad performs on stu­dents. They may dance like an Arabian belly dancer, live out past lives or laugh hysterically at audience members, whom they think are naked. 
One of Conrad's tricks is to bring one big, muscular guy and one pretty, petite girl on stage, hypnotize them, and have them switch roles. The guy believes that he is a balle­rina and tip-toes across the stage, while the girl, convinced she is a guy, chews tobacco and pumps iron. 
Calvin and Hobbes 
Conrad's hypnotism is more than just entertaining, though. It also can help students with their studies by showing them the amazing powers of memory. For example, Conrad "takes" a hypnotized subject back to his kindergarten class­room. "What's your teacher's name? Who sits to your left? Your right? Two rows behind you?" The answers are as­tounding. Through hypnosis, long "forgotten" memories are retrieved from the subject's subconscious mind. Students in the audience often wonder if these hypnosis methods which allow them to remember kin­dergarten experiences can help them recall information from text books read only a few months ago. 
This week students will have the opportunity to discover the answer for themselves by at­tending a series of seminars in hypnosis given by Conrad. "Once you attend one of these seminars, your life will never be the same," says-Conrad. In these workshops, people learn how to hypnotize themselves. Conrad Introduces them to the hidden power of the mind and shows how they can harness it to achieve dramatic results in their lives. Increased self­confldence, information recall, self-induced anesthesia, "photographic" memory poten­tial, reduced test1nterview anx­iety, and personal goal 
achievement are among the benefits which can be obtained. 
"Whatever the mind can con­ceive, the body can achieve through self hypnosis. Any area where increased concentration 
levels are needed--studying, test taking, athletic perfor­mance, interviewing--these techniques will get results." Several college and profes­sional sports teams use self­hypnosis techniques to maxi­mize their athlete's performances. Self hypnosis is also a documented aid to losing weight, quitting smoking and scoring higher on exams. Conrad, who works In the Army Reserve's Public Affairs Divi­sion, has used these hypnosis techniques with the Army's Special Forces, the New York City Police Department and the F.B.I. 
Conrads performance is sponsored by the Student Union Board. Admission is $1.00 
Seminars will be held in the Notre Dame room on the second floor of Lafortune from 
4:00 to 6:.30 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday and at 8:00 
p.m. on Wednesday. Topics to be included are Increased self confidence, Interview tech­niques, weight loss, and test preparation.

By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
This weekend's hockey se­ries between Notre Dame and Michigan-Dearborn was sup­posed to indicate which school had the premier team in the American Collegiate Hockey Association. 
But all the weekend split at the JACC decided was that the two teams are too equal for one squad to stand out. Notre Dame won the first game, 5-3, while the Wolves took Saturday's second game, 6-2, to hold on to first place in the ACHA. 
''These are two pretty evenly matched teams," said Irish coach Ric Schafer. "They have a couple of forwards who are really cute with the puck and quick. Whatever team is on will be the winner." 
That is just how the series worked out. Notre Dame, now 9-2-2 overall and 3-1-2 in the ACHA, played perhaps its best game of the season on Friday. Dearborn (11-2-3, 4-1-0 dominated Saturday's matchup. 
In Friday's game, Dearborn outshot the Irish, 10-3, in the first period, but behind sopho­more Irish goalie Lance Mad­son, Notre Dame held a 1-0 lead after a period. 
"In the first 10 minutes, if we were to award a prize for effort and keeping us m the game, we'd give Lance Madson the game puck, the game goal net and even throw in the Zam­boni," said Schafer. 

Dearborn's Joe Burton tied the game less than two minutes into the second period, but then the Irish started to take com­mand. Tom Smith's goal gave Notre Dame a 2-1 lead after two periods. Matt Hanzel scored twice in the final period, and Bruce Guay also tallied, as the Irish won, 5-3. 
Notre Dame's second line keyed the victory. Hanzel had two goals and an assist, Tim Kuehl recorded two assists and Brian Montgomery scored one goal. 
"It was a really good hockey game," said Schafer. "There were only four penalties the whole game. The conduct was great. 
"It was a great effort. That's a good team we played. We had to work hard, and we did. They have a couple of good guns we were able to quiet." 
But on Saturday, the Wolves had their guns ready and fired away. Dearborn scored twice in the first period and three times in the second period, while Notre Dame could not amass any kind of offense. By the time the Irish staggered into the third period, Dearborn led, 5-0. 
''Michigan-Dearborn was ex­ceptional," said Schafer. "They outworked us for most of the game, and things were just going their way. We gave up some goals early on that just hurt badly. 
"Lance Madson let a couple in that normally are routine saves for him, but how can you fault someone who plays well every other period of the season?" 
Notre Dame finally put to­gether several scoring threats in the final period, but by then Dearborn goalie Mike Klavon had gotten into a rhythm. The Irish still got two goals from Tim Kuehl and Bob Bilton, but it did not make much of a dent on the outcome. 
Pat Marody led the Dearborn attack with two goals and an assist in the 6-2 victory. Joe Burton added a goal and one assist, and Ron Duda had two assists. 
"They didn't make a whole 
lot of mistakes," said Schafer. 
"You didn't see us stealing the 
puck from them or standing 
alone in front of the goal. 
"They have a number of up­
perclass forwards who are 
clever stickhandlers and goal 
scorers in (Mike) Humitz, Os­
burn and Moradi. Their 
goaltender played very well 
today. He came up with some 
awfully good saves.

freshman-sophomore guard combination of Smith and Wil­liams. 
"Rivers played so well and he is a fine basketball player," Crum said. "He showed what a senior guard can do against inexperience. We did not con­tain him well." 
But Phelps said he was happy that a cram session of film­watching helped the other players in the offense to make major contributions. 
''After we lost to Indiana Tuesday night, all we did Wed­nesday was look at four reels of game film and saw how we played too quick and how many three-pointers we didn't need to take," Phelps said. 
"I felt if David was in control to create and then worry about scoring, the the other players would get more involved." 
Gary Voce added 12 points and six rebounds, and Mark Stevenson had 10 points and seven boards. Rivers also had seven rebounds. 
As much as Irish offense hummed along, the Louisville offense just could not get in tune. Notre Dame hit almost 55 percent of their shots, includ­ing 63 percent in the first half, while the Cardinals struggled and hit just 37 percent from two-point range and were un­successful in 14 attempts from three-point range. 
Louisville had a lot of players who couldn't exorcise their shooting futility. Herbert Crook, Williams and Kenny Payne combined to hit a frigid 11 of 37 field goals and Payne and Williams put the icing on the cold shooting by missing all 10 of their three-point attempts. 
· 
Smith, the Cardinals' highly-touted freshman guard, hit just one-of-five before fouling out. 
"I think other than Pervis, I doubt if we had any player play up to his ability," said Crum. "I thought some of our sop­homores, juniors and seniors played like freshmen, too. They were basket cases out there and I'm not sure "

Despite losing to Indiana, who fell to Kentucky in over­time, 82-76, in the second half of Saturday's doubleheader, Rivers and Stevenson said that game helped them prepare to play Louisville, Notre Dame's second straight big test on the road. 
"I think it gave us confidence because even though we didn't play very well at all, and In­diana's a very good team, we were able to stick with them at certain points," Rivers said. 
"This was a really good game for our whole team be­cause we played well for the whole 40 minutes," Stevenson said.

INDIANAPOLIS -The first Big Four Classic was the last for the seniors of the schools involved and both winning teams needed the experience of the upperclassmen. 
In the second game, No. 2 Kentucky, which starts four seniors, needed overtime to beat fifth-ranked Indiana 82-76. Each of the Wildcat starters scored in double figures with Cedric Jenkins scoring 14 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. 
Actually, it was Kentucky's only non-senior starter who hit the shot that won the game. 
Sophomore Rex Chapman, who had been suffering through a poor shooting performance for him, nailed a 3-pointer with 
1: 48 left in overtime to give Kentucky a 78-76 lead. 

"It was a spur of the moment thing, we were down one and needed to get something going," Chapman, who finished with 20 points, said. "I saw Cedric set a good pick for me and when I came off I let it go and it felt good when it left my hand."

Once-lowly Saints clinch playoff spot 
Associated Press 
The San Francisco 49ers and Washington Redskins, who make a habit of being in the playoffs, were joined there Sunday by the New Orleans Saints. 
The Saints? the NFL's peren­nial losers, the team that went 20 years without a winning record? 
Yes, those Saints, who not only are winners this year at 9-3, but are headed for postseason action for the first time. 
New Orleans assured itself of at least a wild-card berth Sun­day with a 44-34 victory over Tampa Bay. That left the Saints one game behind the 49ers, 23-12 winners at Green Bay, in the NFC West. 
San Francisco qualified for the playoffs for the fifth straight year and is 10-2, the best record in the league. 
Washington got into the playoffs for the fifth time in six years and won the NFC East for the fourth time in seven seasons with a 34-17 decision at St. Louis.

Miami edges Gamecocks 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -The Orange Bowl got just what it wanted--a New Year's night showdown be­tween No. 1 Oklahoma and No. 2 Miami for the national title. 
The Miami Hurricanes con­cluded their regular season with an 11-0 record Saturday by beating South Carolina 20-16 to set up the meeting against the Sooners, also 11-0. 
Miami learned it would receive the Orange Bowl bid al­most three weeks ago but had to beat No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 8 South Carolina to make the bowl a winner-take-all championship football game. 
Miami has handed the Sooners their only two losses in the last three seasons. 
berth secured, needed a last­minute touchdown to beat the Minnesota Vikings, 30-24, to clinch the Central. The Vikings are the only other NFC Central team with a winning record. 
All three AFC divisions are muddled, with the Central in a three-way tie among Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Houston. Indianapolis helped create that situation with a 9-7 victory over the Browns, giving the Colts the lead in the East. 
Denver's 31-20 decision over New England lifted the Broncos past San Diego, a 33-18 loser at Houston, and Seattle, which was beaten 13-9 in Pit­tsburgh. The Broncos, 8-3-1, lead the West with the AFC's best record.

have been the ultimate feeling in sport into a bittersweet mo­ment. 
Another person who was relieved by Brown's win was Jim Brock, Executive Vice President of the Cotton Bowl Comittee. For the third time in the last four years, the Cotton Bowl will feature the Reisman Trophy winner. In 1985, Bo Jackson led Auburn to he Cot­ton Bowl against Texas A&M, where the Tigers lost, 36-16. One year earlier, Doug Flu tie and Bostron College went to Dallas where they beat Hous­ton, 45-28. 
"I'm very excited," said Brock. "Tim Brown is cer­tainly deserving of the Heis­man. I was a little nervous, but I made some calls on my own and found out that Brown was ahead. We've been very lucky to have three of the last four winners in the Cotton Bowl."

It was, to say the least, in­credible. 
The first-ever Collegiate Na­tional Catholic Swimming and Diving Championships at­tracted many of the top ath­letes in the country to the Notre Dame campus. It was the beginning of a new tradition in collegiate swimming. It was something Ulat can only get bigger and better. 
"I think it was the best cham­pionship anybody could run," Villanova coach Ed Geisz said. "Tim Welsh ran the best cham­pionship for men and women in the country. It was an exciting meet." 
"I told my team I was thrilled to be a part of it," Fordham coach Don Galuzzi said. "It was excellent plan­ning, and we really enjoyed our stay. We're allready lookng forward to it next year in Vil­lanova." 
Irish coach Tim Welsh, Galuzzi, and Geisz had talked about organizing such a meet for years, but nothing had ever materialized, Finally, the three schools combined efforts with Welsh volunteering as the host for the inaugural event. Mter the dust and smoke had cleared from 15 record-setting performances, Welsh could not believe the dramatic success of the meet. 
"I've probably spent more time and more energy on plan­ning and working than I thought," Welsh said. "Even with that, it was more fun, more exciting than I ever im­agined. The spirit of the teams was a verification that this was the right thing to do." 
Most coaches were quick to credit part of the success of the meet to the spacious facilites at Rolf's Aquatics Center. Only in its second year of operation, the facilty left lasting impres­sions on the teams. 
"The facilities here are won­derful," Geisz said. "The water is the right temperature, and it is fast. I think it is one of the best facilities in the country.'' 
"The facility is an excellently-planned facility, not just for competitive swim­ming, but for total recreation,'' Galuzzi said. "It is competition geared, but also allows for the total program." 

Welsh credited the success of the meet to a number of people, stressing the importance of the volunteers that donated valu­able time and knowledge. 
"What makes Notre Dame special is that the people that ran the meet are all first class people," he said. "There were three major parts. The first was freshman Jim Byrne's par­ents who volunteered to do all the scoring on their own com-_ puter system. Second was the sports information depart­ment. They did a magnificent job of covering pre-meet, during the meet, and the post­meet. Finally was the core meet staff from the head offi­cial to the student volunteers.'' 
The huge success of this meet, though, leaves Vil­lanova's Geisz at a disadvan­tage when preparing for next year's meet. 
"I don't know how we can im­prove on it," he said.

of 16 places available, we had six of them. We're a Fighting Irish team in that we stay in the race from the prelims until the final person touches the wall. This pool has allowed us to train a great team." 
The Irish women also turned in a good team performance, taking second to a strong Bos­ton College squad, 837.5-626. Notre Dame was a solid second throughout the entire champi­onship meet. 
"We're delighted with the women," Welsh said. "We told the women at the beginning of the meet that if we could get second we would think it was an outstanding team perfor­mance. The women achieved this by a lot of people scoring and a lot of people improving." 
"The kids did really well," 
Boston College coach Tom 
Groden said. "I was very 
happy with the performance. 
Notre Dame took the lead on 
the first day, and the kids 
responded to it. It was well 
worth the trip out here." 

cky Wood won the 100 and 200 
breastroke, Amy Darlington 
the 200 freestyle, and Andrea 
Bonny took the 1-meter diving 
title. 

Welsh saw the impressive 
showings from both teams as a 
great stride for the Irish swim­
ming program. 
"We think of the two teams as one," Welsh said. "The pro­grams are in the same place. We're together and moving ahead. There's no measure­ment at the amount of confi­dence out team has gained. The most important thing is to open our eyes at what the next step ·will be. We're not at the top, but we can see it from here." 
IRISH ITEMS -Welsh was named men's coach of the meet, while Boston College's Groden took the honors on the 
women's side... Villanova's 
Chris Craft took the male ath­
lete of the meet, and Cindi

female athlete of the 
meet ... Craft qualified for the 
Olympic trials with his times

Geisz thinks he can get a spot 
on the team ... Villanova will 
host the meet next year ... A 
total of 15 pool records were set 
during the 
weekend ... Villanova's time of 
3:03.91 in the 400-freestyle relay was the fastest time for that event in the United States this year ... The Irish women downed Fordham in a dual meet Sunday 111-104... The Irish men lost to Villanova 122­95 Sunday, but downed Fordham 139.5-78.5

Swim teams surprise foes, finish second 
By GREG GUFFEY Sports Writer 
In the end, the favorite 
prevailed, but it was anything 
but easy. 

With only five events left in 
the three-day competition, Vil­
lanova trailed surprising Notre 
Dame, 555-545.5. The powerful 
Wildcats, however, took con­
trol in those five events and 
went on to take the first-ever 
National Catholic Swimming 
and Diving Championships 
title 757.5-727. 

While Wildcat coach f<.;a 
Geisz was ecstatic over the vic­
tory, he never thought it would 
be so hard to accomplish. All 
17 Villanova swimmers had to 
swim personal best times in or­
der to down the Irish. 
"We knew it could go down to the wire," Geisz said. "It was one of the most exciting championships my team was ever in. The Notre Dame team was unbelievably strong. I don't know where they got their swimmers, but they did one hell of a job." 
"If you had told me that we would have the lead after the 100 free on the last night, I would not have believed it would happen," a jublilant Tim Welsh said of his Irish squad. "But we knew it was possible, especially after the prelims. The team created the deter­mination and excitement and carried it out.'' 
The Irish men set 10 school records with the second-place finish. Paul Godfrey paced the Irish effort with first-place finishes in the 500 and 1650 freestyle events, but it was the team depth that accounted for the strong finish. 
"The thing we're proudest of is approaching the top of the heap through team depth," Welsh said. "We went ahead at the end of the 100 free because

Brown endures criticism of his selection 
NEW YORK -How do you spell relief? Saturday night in New York Irish senior flanker Tim Brown spelled it H-e-i-s-m-a-n. 
It's odd that after winning college football's most prestigous award, Brown felt relief-not happiness, jubilation, or ecstasy, but relief. On one hand, he was relieved that it was finally all over with. After all, he'd been dealing with Reisman hoopla all season long. 
But what he was most relieved by was that the events of the last two weeks were done. After sub­par performances in consecutive losses to Penn State and Miami, Brown went from Reisman shoo­in to Reisman drop-out in the eyes of some media members who said that maybe Brown wasn't as deserving as they had made him out to be. Suddenly, Syracuse quarterback Don McPherson was very much in the picture . 
"It really is (a relief) , " Brown said after the award. "I found out this week that I was a bad person, and I didn't know that. I was relieved that everything was behind me, and I didn't have to worry about what people were going to say about me in the papers." 
The criticism was such that Brown began to take it personally. 
"It did in a way because I think I'm a pretty good person when people have bad things to say about me," Brown said of the attacks on his play. "I took it personally as if they were attackmg me as a person. Whatever they were saying, I don't feel they had any right to say it." 

Brown, who at times in the post-award press con­ference appeared grim and tight-lipped under the onslaught of critical questions, endured the trial which tried to determine if he really was the best player in college football this year or if he got the award for his career at Notre Dame.

"I think that half the people vote on careers and half vote on one season," Brown answered. "It's not really right for me to say which one I was. I had a good four years at Notre Dame, and I also had a good year." 
The questioning went so far as to ask Brown if he thought there should be two awards -a career award and a season award. 
"I think that's taking it a little too far," Brown said. "This is tough enough for a lot of people. To try to come up with an award like that would be really tough." 
Of course, a big criticism of Brown's winning was that he played at Notre Dame, where almost every game is played on national television. 
"I'm not going to sit here and apologize for making the decision to go to Notre Dame," Brown said. "I made that decision based on my life, not football.'' 
One thing is clear, Brown deserves this year's award. No player meant as much to his team as Brown meant to the Irish. He faced double and triple coverages. Teams refused to kick to him after seeing him reel off long returns, one after another. Still, he piled up impressive numbers. 
Even more impressive was the quality of teams he did it against. Of the Irish opponents this season, nine, including Texas A&M, will play in bowl games. Brown wasn't racking up yards against the Colgates of the country. If Syracuse played the schedule that Notre Dame did, it would be on television more. The simple fact is that the Irish played opponents around the country, and the networks put on what the people wanted to see. 
Of course, there may be a simpler reason for the treatment Brown received. McPherson won the Northeast region, which includes New York. Their candidate finished a distant second to Brown. Spell this s-o-u-r g-r-a-p-e-s. They turned what should
