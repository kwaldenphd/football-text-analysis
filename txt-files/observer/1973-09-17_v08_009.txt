Farenthold challenges myths 
by Peggy Fredericks Staff Reporter 

''The only way to break myths down is to challenge them," was the keynote of a speech delivered by Sissy Farenthold, President of the National Women's Political Caucus, Saturday in the Little Theatre at Moreau HalL Recent examples of "myths being challenged" cited were Shirley Chisholm's bid for the presidency and Mrs Farenthold's nomination for vice president. 
Jane DuComb, president of the Indiana Women's Political Caucus opened the program. She read telegrams from Indiana Governor, Otis Bowen, and Senator Birch Bayh which welcomed Mrs. Farenthold to the Hoosier State, commending her for the work in furthering women's political rights. Dr. Edward L. Henry, president of Saint Mary's College, introduced the president of the National 
Women's Political Caucus. 

"When we look at women, I think it's well to see where we come from, where we are, and where we might be going," remarked Mrs. Farenthold. Start­ing with an imperfect constitution in this country, women were not regarded as persons, 
stated Farenthold. 

The . Equal Rights Amendment can be 
paralleled with the thirteenth, fouteenth, and fif­
teenth amendments which attempted to bring 
about the full citizenship of blacks. Farenthold felt 
that history is sympathetic to the pursuit of human 
rights. Equal citizenship is inherent in the black 
cause. 

Statistics in electoral politics prove that women 
are second class citizens and minority women are 
third class citizens. In Texas, 1,000 or 6.4 percent of 
the 18,000 elected public officials are women. This 
statistic includes 54 percent of the county clerks and 
49 percent of district clerks who are women. In 
Indiana, 9.7 percent of the public elected officials 
are women. This does not include school boards or 
county-wide councils. However, 53 percent of the 
recorders and 40 percent of the treasurers are 
women.Thereare no women United States Senators. 
Indiana has no United States Representatives, 
whereas Texas has one. Ms. Farenthold brought 
these statistics in electoral politics because she 
feels that "you can only change the law by changing 
the lawmakers." 

Farenthold stressed that awareness, asser­
tiveness, and audacity are three key words 
essential in considering where we are today and 
were we are going. Women on the localleval are not 
aware, they are not participating politicians as they 
should. Politics is a two way street. You must be 
able to take pain and strain and then persevere. 
Assertiveness is, in effect, a substitute for 
aggressiveness. Audacity means being determined 
because it is unlikely that much encouragement will 
be offered. Things are audacious because they 
haven't been done before. Ms. Farenthold cited her running for governor in Texas an an example of audacity. 
During her talk Farenthold pointed out that women's problems are not the only problems our society is confronted with. She recently visited migrantcamps in Indiana and was disturbed by the poor conditions. Out of 200 migrant camps in Indiana, only 12 are lisensed. The former guber­natorial candidate urged members of the audience to find out what their local migrant situation is. 
Mrs. Farenthold closed her speech with a quote by Caesar Chavez. "It is possible to become discouraged about the injustices everywhere, but God did not promise us that the world would be humane and just. He gives the gift of life which allows us to choose the way we use our limited time on this earth. It is a good opportunity to do something about the suffering of our We can choose to use our lives to ·bring better and more just world for our .:hi!dren. who make that choice will know sacrifice. But if you give yourself tvtally abiding struggle for peace and justice you find that people will give you their tearts will never grow hungry and never be alone. And in giving of yourself you will discover a whole new life with meaning and love. The greatest tragedy is not to live and die as we all must. The greatest tragedy is for a person to live and die without the satisfac­tion of giving life for others. The greatest tragedy is to be born but not to live for fear of losing a little security or because we are afraid of loving and giving ourselves to to people. Our opponents in the agricultural industry are very powerful and farm workers are still weak in money and influence. But we have another kind of power that comes fromthe justice of our causes. So long as we are willing to sacrifice for that cause, so long as we 
persist in non-violence and work to spread the message of our struggle, then millions of people around the world will respond from their hearts, will support our efforts and in the end we will overcome." 
Mrs. Farenthold's speech was part of workshop, Equality: Political Style. It was presented by the South Bend-Mishawaka Women's Political Caucus and Indiana Women's Political Caucus at Saint Mary's College on September 15.

Burtchaell stressesmorality at openingmass 
by Jerry Lutkus Editor in Chief 

Fr. James T. Burtchaell, provost of the University, questioned the "depth of our committment to moral education" in his homily at the mass Sunday in Sacred Heart Church that officially opened the 1973-74 school year. 
Burtchaell offered that it is time at 

NotreDame "to consider our obligation ... to offer an education that is more than merely intellectual." 
Speaking at the 10:45 a.m. ceremonies before the faculty and administrators of the university, bedecked in the robes of acadamie and students, Burtchaell said that if knowledge, only one of the mind's endeavors, is the only endeavor that is fed here,"it becomes a grotesque cancer which will sap the life from the other activities of the intellect." 
Students who come to this campus, Burtchaell said, should be walking into a "crisscross" of questions about the values that we live by. 
The provost noted that the students do not force the faculty into a situaton where there is questioning of values. Instead, he stated that the student's interpretation and value "is often inarticulate and frustrated." 
He continued saying that "our task is often not so much to answer students' 

questions, as to draw them to ask enough questions that the search may get un­derway." 
There is little vision in our world, our country and our sch.ools today, according to the provost. "Many peopledonot believe much, nor have a love to live and die for." 
Burtchaell stated his belief that students have to be guided into some personal and social committments. 
He claimed that in the past, the students who came to Notre Dame were steeped in the Christian tradition and the task then was simpler. In fact, he said, the school was little challenged and thus they were lulled by the apparent conformity of students to approved values. 
The provost said that this is no longer the case.Thereasons for this are "nonchalant homes and slothful schools," he said. In addition, he pointed out that the "raw material" that the university is faced with is no longer steeped in the Christian tradition. 
"Some students come to the university so value-deprived that they don't even rightly know what to rebel against," Burtchaell claimed. 
The faculty was challenged by Burt­chaell to return some of the moralism to teaching. He said that the priests in the halls gladly welcome the challenge of giving moral leadership, "but not at the risk of taking it ultimately from the faculty." 
"But whether men and women graduate from this institutuion as adults or as moral troglodytes depends more upon you (the faculty) than upon all those others. We cannot have chaplains," he continued, "who know nothing about scholarship. Neither can we have scholars who have nothing to say about life's good and their order." 
Burtc:'haell challenged the faculty to find better ways of "seeking, sharing and enjoining beliefs and values" with the students. He urged them to 
create a more systematic way in which the scholars at Notre Dame can expose, debate and share their beliefs with students. 
Haphazard was the term that the provost picked to describe the manner in which this now takes place. 
He pushed the faculty to become in­terested not only in what the students know, but what they prize and what they believe. 
Burtchaell delivered the homily during the mass celebrated by University President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh. Con­celebrating the mass wth Hesburgh were Fr. Edmund Joyce, Fr. James Flanigan, Fr. Ferdinand Brown and Burtchaell. 
Seated behind the altar were the priests of Notre Dame while the faculty, who en­tered the church in a grand procession, sat in the pews in the main body of the church. 
For the first time, medallions were worn during the mass by the occupants of en­dowed chairs at Notre Dame. The solid silver medallions will be worn in formal academic ceremonies and will be given to their wearers upon retirement at which time their engraved names will be added. 
On the medallion are a star, a cross and waters which were taken from the seal of the university. 
Also included in the ceremony was the premiere performance of a fanfare, "Heralding," which was played during the procession of faculty members .in­to the church. The fanfare was composed by David Clark Isele, recently appointed assistant professor of music and composer in residence at Notre Dame. 
"Heralding" was performed by Sue Henderson Seid who is beginning her first year at Notre Dame as university organist and director of the chapel choir. 
Isele, who also serves as director of the 
Glee Club and the University Chorus, has 
aso been commissioned to compose a 
"Notre Dame Mass" which will be 
premiered in Sacred Heart Church later 
this year.

SMC election lacks enough candidates 
by David Kaminski Staff Reporter 

St. Mary's students have until midnight Wednesday, Sept. 19, to file as a candidate for electioTJ to the the St. Mary's assembly. The election is scheduled for Monday, Sept -24. 
As of Sunday, Sept. 16, eight assembly seats lack even the necessary one candidate to make an uncontested race. Those eight seats are: 
One from Holy Cross Hall. 
Three from 
Regina Hall. 
Two from Le Mans Hal. 
One from off-eampus 
One from day students. 

Patty Kampsen, Election Committee chairperson, hopes that the slate of candidates canbe completed by midnight Wed­nesday."I strongly urge students to consider running for Student Assembly," Kampsen said. "If by midnight Wednesday we are still short of candidates, we will have to extend the deadline until we have enough candidates to run the election." 
If there are enough candidates by Wednesday night, the campaign for Student Assembly will begin at 
8:00 a.m., Thursday, Sept. 20. Campaigning will continue until midnight Sunday, Sept. 23. 
The elections will then be held in the halls from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00

Bike registration is deemed success 
by Mark Derheimer Staff Reporter 
"Without question the bike registration was a greater success than last year." This is the way Chris Singleton, student coor­dinator of the project, summed up the bike registration drive which took place Wednesday through Friday of last week. 
This year 320 bikes were registered, doubling last year's total of 160. Approximately one out of six students has a bicycle, making a total of 1000 bikes on campus, according to Singleton. Thus the registration figures for last year coupled with this year's add up to half of the bikes on campus being registered either with Notre Dame security or with Computer Guard, the nationwide registration system. 
Singleton stressed registered bikes are much more difficult for a thief to sell than unregistered ones. 
He believes that "if 100 per cent registration could be achieved, bike thefts at Notre Damewouldgo down." He feels thieves would be wary of a completely registered campus. 
Anyone still wishing to register a bike may do so at the Security Office starting Tuesday, Sep­tember 18. The fee is one doallar. Those people who need serial numbers stamped on their bike should to to the Security Office Tuesday between 2:30 and 5:30. 
Singleton was "quite pleased with the number who turned out voluntarily to register their bikes." He also expressed his gratitude to the 25 students who helped in the registration. 

Chris Singleton and his staff consider their bike registration duties last week a success over last year's program.

hasn't been done before--It will never get done." 
Even with the,:;;e ingredients, Farenthold noted that woman a candidate faces her greatest challenge in that she is often not taken seriously. 
"After I'd been campaigning for some months (for the Texas state legislature) my doting husband sat down with me one night and told me he'd support me openly--if I was a "serious" candidate. Even my family was uneasy about it-­they thought I should have run for attorney general or something --­anything but the legislature." 
She was elected to ~o con­secutive terms before running unsuccessfully for governor. Politics is nothing new to her--her family "has always been politically oriented," and her grandfather, B.D. Tarleton, was a Texas legislator from 1881 to 1886. 
Farenthold feels she has "seena change" in the last fiveyearson the political scene for women. 
"They're more aware now than ever before--and they're getting more opportunities," she said. She credits thewomen'scaucus with the 
breakthrough,  but  added  that  
much still needs to be done.

It seems that the Office of Student Affairs has found a way to solve the housing shortage and make off-campus living more desirable.

Critique Critic 

Ectitor: 
Maria Gallagher's recent review of Cat Steven's "Foreigner" reflected a fundamental ignorance of the artist and his music. While Ms. Gallagher validly recognized that Stevens, contrary to many cri­
tics, has indeed progressed with the album's creation, she makes several erroneous comments. 
First, Steven's principal triumph through the work is not in ex­tending the insight initiated in "Mona Bone Jakon". Rather the artist has shifted into a much less predictable, much more vibrant. exciting style. Rhythm throughout is not at all Reggea, Bosa Nova, or 

A Party Advocate 
Editor: 
I was appalled a':d to say the least very disgt.ster· with the front page story in Y"Sterday's Observer proclaiming that no parties would be permitted for the upcoming weekend. This is a serious in­fringement upon the students' rights and a gross abuse of power bv the Auministration. A con­t(nuation of ~uch a policy could cause irrepa1 able damage to anal­ready inadequate social life here at Notre Dame. 
Despite 1oken efforts at coeducati m, Notre Dame still basicall· remains a male in­stitutiot with a ratio of about 6 to 1. 
The ,arty is a very important equa' zer in overcoming that hand..:ap here on campus. To cancel them or to try to transform them from their present form to that of a church picnic with a rector, etc., present, would in­timidate those present and would inhibit many from going and from having a good time, having much the same effect as a person's parents would have. It is unheard of for 19 and 20 year olds to have to be chaperoned and held to a tight set of rules in this day and age. ND is one again digressing further back into the past, losing still further touch with 1973 and its ideals and values and with reality in generaL

Editor: Each summer as we return to the sacred and hallowed halls of Notre Dame, we patiently await the inane proclamations of the SLC or some other buffle-headed ad­ministration. And it took all of nine days for our expectations to be more than satiated. Of course, we are referring to the guidelines which w:ll be presented to the SLC. After reading them very carefully, we are astounded by their ludicrousness. A cloud of fear seems to have pervaded th campus oppressing the student body with archaic and indifferent constraints. The absurd idea of forbidding a student the right to exercise his desire to use his room as a social meeting place rather than as a library is an insult to the intelligent and mature student at Notre Dame. College is to be a learning ex­perience both in and out of the classroom and such regulations on the student's free, moral judgements are self defeating as they mold a blind follower rather than a constructive initiator. In closing, we believe that such burlesque rules serve no con-

The Flipper and I 

matt kubik 
I've been playing the pinball machine down at Rick's too much lately. I keep seeing that pinball bouncing off the solenoids. :nocking down little clowns, and maybe doing a lazy loop before rollmg down to get socked by a flipper. "It's just a game," I tell myself. It's all just a game you know. I keep seeing tha pinball bouncing around though, slipping down the little chute before jumping off the tip of a flipper. 
The way to good pinball playing is control. Keep your I on the ball. Jiggle the machine a little. Develop good reflexes. The biggest thing is to remain calm as that silver ball goes whizzing around your head. Sometimes you can make the games easier, Oike by putting ash trays under the legs), but it's a trick. Usually everyone can tell, or you think they can, (paranoia). Anyway, you know it's a trick and that is enough. 
A friend of mine cracked up last week, (TILT). Too many pills; too many hassles; r. 1sband and kids got her down. She got excited and the game got away I rom her. She got into making the game harder than it really is. Then she forgot how to play. 
Things start l".!ilding up. The ball goes faster and faster, knocking against bumpers, slapping the flipper. The wire in your head starts getting tight, ad the ball speeds up. Your stomach gets queasy and the bJII careens orward. Then you hit the machine too hard, or your finger misses a flipper button. The silver flashes down the ramp, flying into oblivion. 
That pinball k· eps spinning around my head; glittering silver carrot in front of my nose. Sometimes lean play better when I'm half stoned, 
or think I can.It's easier to get into the games that way. Party games. Fooling people. Putting on a show: bouncing silver ball off my finger tips, nose, toes. The high goes away, but the ball doesn't. In the end being stoned is just another part of the game. 
I keep trying to watci1 other people to see how they play. That's not easy when your own silver ball is flying at top speed. You find out most people are playing the same way you are. Except the few. They're the ones who could finally just walk away from the games. They're the ones who don't have to play. 
I've never gotten a free game off of that machine. You're supposed to knock down all the yellow clowns and then you get a big bonus and a free game. I've only known one person who got all those clowns. He really had control. A fearless type who wasn't afraid to challenge the machine. I've always wondered what would happen to me if I did that. But I get scared when those laughing faces refuse to fall. One day they 'II all go down. I'll walk away from the machine and won't have to play the games anymore.

Francis speaks on recent coup in Chile 
by Jim Donathen Staff Reporter 

Government Professor Michael 
J. Francis lived in Chile during the summers of 1966 and 1968 and ngain for eight months during 1970 and witnessed President Salvador Allende's campaign and election. He has also written a book on the subject of Chile. 
"I had a great deal of respect for President Allende," said Prof. Francis, a Notre Dame Chile watcher. "I feel extremely bad about the situation: the coup, Allende's death, and the break in Chile's democratic tradition." 
Professor Francis stated that Allende's rise to power was the product of an enormous amount of frustration due to poverty and the government's poor performance and a split in the opposition party. 
Reverend Kenna 
is dead. struck 
by heart attack 
Rev. Howard JJ. Kenna, form~·r provincial superior of the Indiana Province of the Congregation of Holy Cross, died in his sleep o of an apparent heart attack on Thur­sday, Sept. 13, in the provincial house, 1304 E. Jefferson Blvd., South Bend. 
Father Kenna, provincial since 1962, had completed his term in June of this year and was to become chaplain for the Holy Cross Brothers at St. Joseph's Farm, Granger, Ind. He also planned to work in the archives of the University of Notre Dame doing research and writing on the history of Notre Dame and the Congregation of Holy Cross. 
Kenna was born on October 16 1\JOl. in Clontarf, Minn., and moved SO'n thereafter with his family to Jamestown, North Dakota. He Plitered the Holy Cross Seminary m 192.1 and graduated from the university in 1926. He studied theology for four years at Holy Cross College in Washington, D.C., and was ordained a Holy Cross priest at Notre Dame on June 24 1930. ' 
Kenna was a Fellow of the University of Notre Dame and a member of its board of trustees and a member oftheConference of Major Superiors of religious communitiesof men in the U.S.

His election victory was something of an accident as Allende was able to win the three candidate race with only 37 per cent of the vote. In contrast, Allende suffered a stunning defeat in an usative vote of confidence in 1964 when he polled only 39 percent of the vote in a two candidate-contest. 
From his first day in office, certain groups such as Chilean rightists and the United States which cut financial assistanc~ were working for his overthrow. Allen infuriated the middle class with his economic policies that led to an inflation rate of some 350 percent. Then, the army began to get upset by his talk of arming factory workers and increasing government control of univer­sities. 
Ironically, the run-away in­flation · that hastened Allende's downfall was largely the result of his attempts to redistribute the nation's wealth. As Chile's poor became more able to afford such basic commodities as meat, the laws of supply and demand created 
severe shortages and forced up prices. American business interests in 
Chile  were  seized  in Allende's  
nationalization  of  industry.  
(>rofessor  Francis  doubts·  if  

American industries, such as the copper companies will be given back. "American businesses are not well liked, largely because of the huge profits they made for years from the copper industry." 
There will probably be an election within the year according to Professor Francis. However, the extent of the left's particpation in such election remains un­determined. 
Even if the militant junta allows the left to participate, it seems unlikely that they will run a can­didate for office. Since the rightist opposition has a strong candidate in former President Frei (who couldn't succeed himself in the 1970 electon), a leftist candidate could suffer an embarassing defeat. 
Francis summed up the situaton in Chile as still reins extremely u­nstable, the possibility of a civil warexistsand it remains to be seen if the military junta will follow up on their promise for a return to normal political processes.

Student manual under study 

First SLC meeting today 
(continued from page 2) 
Karen Moty, who did not return, as District II representative of Farley, .. B-;P, Cavanaugh and St. Ed's. 
Lathers believes the combined force of the Board of Com­missioners will "pump new blood into student representation and the SLC in particualr." 
She interprets SLC participation in the revision of the Student Manualas an opportunity for more responsibility for the individual student. 
"While there may be a need for revision, there is an emphasis on student responsibility," said Lathers. 
Describing the combining of SKLC and student government presently as a "peaceful co­existence", Lathers would welcome any cooperation. 
District III 
Included in Representative Ed 
Rahill's District are Keenan, Stanford, Zahm, Holy Cross, St Joe and Moreau. 
Rahill feels that the SLC should 
aid the students in developing 
socially as well as a cademically. 
His long range goals pivot on 
making the SLC more effective. 
Reluctant to specify on revising the Student Manual until today's meeting, Rahill stated that the SLC on the whole is concerned about student rights being pushed aside. 
Rahill noted specifically that the recent statement of enforcement of the current manual's party and drinking rules would remain in effect until the new manual was approved. 
He also felt that the SLC might be under pressure because of the recent statement. 
District IV 
Mike Hess, representing Falnner and Grace, expresses the most concern to the "No-Knock" clause and the party rules. 
The "No-Knock" clause reserves the right for the university to enter student's rooms. It was added to housing contracts at the end of last semester. 
"It was added at a time when no one could question it," said Hess. 
Hess did not care to comment on the party and drinking rule until after today's meeting but he describes it as being a big issue. 
"The administration has kind of left us in the dark with regard to the statement by Fr. Mulcahy and the new manual," Hess said. "All 

University to support new women's tennis club 
Group sports have long been an important part of many students' college experience. Watching from the sidelines is good fun, but Notre Dame women should have the opportunity to participate on a team. 
Ot _;anized women's tennis at Notre Dame can soon become a reality if enough interest is shown. University officials have ex­pressed a genuine intention to financially support such a team. The interested girls must maintain their own club for the '73-'74 season. The club will have scheduled practice times outdoors and in the ACC. No one will be ranked for team play until the spring. 
Recreation, friendly com­petition, and future team play will be the focal pomts. Notre Dame men who would like to contribute 
Private parties are forced by SLC guidelines 
by Tom Russ Staff Reporter 
This weekend the Notre Dame 
campus was enlivened by a series 
of priv::te parties. The hall party 
planned by Fisher and a 4th floor 
section party planned by St. Ed's 
were postponed by the students in 
order to comply with the guidelines 
set by the SLC. 
Most of the parties were con­tained within private rooms. A well-controlled event was held in several rooms on Lyons' 4th floor Friday night, and a 'Saturday night Holy Cross gathering was high-lighted bya well-clothed go-go dancer. A party on Dillon's second floor drew a fairly large crowd Saturday night which spilled into the hallway and was subsequently broken up by the rector.

I've heard has been through the Observer.'' 
Hess finds particularly upsetting the lack of rationale behind the new policy. 
"On paper it may be a step forwad but really it is a regression into the fifties," said Hess. 
District V 
Sorin, Walsh, Alumni and Dillon will be represented by Jude Bremer, who expects the manual to be open and flexible. 
Bremer participated on a preliminary reading committee before school opened and describes the first draft as "looking good." 
"I think the new manual will be getting away from black and white rules and if successful will really be an improvement," stated Bremer. 
The off campus situiution must also be improved through the SLC and the Board of Commissioners. 
She expects no difficulties in cooperation between the SLC and Board. 
District VI Bob Connolly, representing Lyons, Morrissey, Fisher and Pangborn, projects two immeidate issues for the SLC. The basic question to be dealt with, in Connolly's opinion, will be the party regulation. Stating that he would not ap­prove the regulation as it stands, he felt that such a regulation could not be forced upon the students. He further denoted a need for a changem philosophy of what is a Notre Dame student and what are his rights. Such a change could be brought through the SLC. Connolly feels that a genuine cooperation exists this year bet­
ween  the  SLC  and  student  
government  which  was  lacking  
past years.

second half, but each time Pont's 
Wildcats rallied behind the passing 
combination of junior quarterback 
Mitch Anderson to senior tight end 
Steve Craig. 
A pair of 10-yard receptions by 

Craig put Northwestern on 
MSU's one-vard line with less 
than one minute remaining in the 
first half, and set up Stan Key's 
one-yard touchdown dive with 0:29 
showing. Then, with nine minutes 
remaining in the ball game, Craig 
ran the same ten-yard hook-in, 
took Anderson's pass at the one, 
and carried three Spartan 
defenders into the end zone for 
what proved to be the winning 
touchdown. 
F~om that point on, Nor­

thwestern's patchwork defense-­
young and inexperienced--shut 
down the Spartan attack and 
triggered the kind of locker-room 
madness long absent from Nor­
thwestern's Dyche Stadium. 
"I've seen some pretty happy 

locker rooms," reminded Pont, 
"but I'd have to rate this one right 
up there with the best of them. It 
just feels wonderful that first win-­
we got a monkey off our backs. 
"Our defense did a hell of a job," he continued. "We've made tremendous strides since last spring. We cut down their long runs, and holding a team as quick as Michigan 'State to 10 points isn't a bad job at all. 
"Still, we've got 10 games to go, and this was a pretty tough opener. We went into it cold turkey. Now next week, when Notre Dame prepares for us, they'll have a big advantage from a mental stand­point. They've seen us play, and we haven't seen them at all. And believe me, that makes a dif­ference." 
But the Northwestern coach did not have his heart in looking ahead to Notre Dame. He wanted to savor his upset of Michigan State. 
"What we wanted to do," he siad, "was get the players to realize that we've got confidence with them. That we're not gam­bling with them. We want them to realize that they're winners. 
"After all, you never tire of winning." 
But you do tire of losing, and Pittsburgh, Navy, and No­rthwestern, may have done just that.
