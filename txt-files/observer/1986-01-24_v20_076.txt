American forces step up presence in Mediterranean Sea near Libya 
AMoclated Prc8ll 
WASHINGTON -The United States has ordered its two aircraft battle groups in the Mediterranean Sea southward toward Ubya and notified civilian air traffic officials there the carriers will be conducting flight operations over the next week. 
Pentagon sources said yesterday that the moves in no way presaged any type of military attack on Ubya and that all operations would be conducted in international airspace and waters. 
One official added, however, that the exercise was intended to demonstrate that the United States would not be intimidated by an in­creased Soviet naval presence in the region, nor by Libyan leader Colonel Moammar Khadafy's decision to place his own military forces on alert and to pledge continuing sup­port for Palestinian terrorists. 
"It's a..<;serting the right to passage in international airspace, with plenty of notice to everyone in ad­vance of our peaceful intent," one source said. 
Another source said the flight operations had been approved ear­lier in the week by the National Security Council "as a warning that we're not forgetting these terrorist attacks. We know what Khadafy has done and we want him to know we're prepared to respond." 
A White House official denied reports that the exercise was a deliberate provocation ofKhadafy. 
"Reports that it is a stern message on terrorism are just wrong," the of­ficial said, speaking on condition he not be identified. "It Is not designed to provoke Ubya. We are not flying over the Gulf of Sidra; we are not flying over the Libyan hind ma.ss." 
Another.senior official, comment­ing on an earlier published report that the administration hoped to goad Khadafy into attacking U.S. forces to give the United States an excuse for retaliating, dismissed the suggestion with an expletive. 
"Anyone who says a thing like that doesn't know Ronald Reagan," the source said. "The point is to dis­courage terrorism and keep him guessing about what we might do, not give him an excuse to try it again." 
The United States has accused Libya ofsupporting a Palestinian ter­rorist group suspected of mounting the Dec. 27 attacks on the Rome and Vienna airports, in which 19 people died. Khadafy responded during the first week of january by putting his military forces on alert, claiming the United States was planning an inva­sion. 
The Soviet Union, which supports Libya, responded by increasing its surveillance ofthe U.S. 6th Fleet and by moving two more combat ships into the Mediterranean from the Black Sea, bringing to six the num­ber of Russian combat ships in the region. 
The United States currently has 31 Navy ships in the Mediterranean, of which 20 are combat ships. The combat forces are led by two aircraft carriers -the Coral Sea and Saratoga. The Saratoga joined the Coral Sea just last week. 


ND faculty keep eyes to the skies for view of passing Halley's comet 
ByGREGTUEL 
NeursStaf! 
Several Notre Dame and Saint Mary's faculty members have become involved in the interna­tional stir created by the appearance of Hailey's comet, back after its 76 year hiatus from sight. 
Sightings of the comet started last November and continued throug­hout December and january. 
In Miami, the comet was filmed and broadcast live throughout the world by a crew of scientists Includ­ing Terry Rettig, assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Notre Dame. 
Using newly-developed equip­ment which allowed photographs to be taken at a rate of one every 1/30 of a second, the crew studied the comet for changes ofshort duration, Rettig said. 
"There is not really anything that sets this comet apart from the rest," he said, adding that the history which surrounds"the comet is more unique than the actual comet. 
"It reappears every 76 years, which ties it to a lifetime. And so many interesting things have hap­pened upon Its appearance-empires have fallen, countries have fallen, and rulers have died," Rettig said. 
"There was a long-standing belief that a comet might strike the earth," said Michael Crowe, professor in the graduate program ofhistory and the philosophy of science. "In 1910, people were selling comet pills to protect others from possible Infec­tion carried by the comet. Some scientists speculated about life on the comet, and there were many theories ofwhat it would be like," he said.

Student Saver Store to close its doors today after year of trouble 
By BETH CORNWELL 
StaffReporter 
The Student Saver Store sold its few remaining items yesterday and shut its doors permanently. 
Originally the store was con­ceived as a student alternative to the bookstore, according to manager Keith Spatz. Administrative con­cerns about direct competition bet­ween the two stores resulted in strict restrictions on the Student Saver Store. 
"The proposal (which created the store) put us behind the eight ball to begin with. We couldn't add new items without the approval ofthe ad­ministration," Spatz said. 
"When we wanted to open during the lunch hour, it took four months for the administration to approve the request," he said. 
The store opened at the start of the 1985 spring semester. qom the very beginning, the restricted line of products and a difficult location limited business, Spatz said. 
"When I got here last january, there were already problems," said Spatz. "The school supplies were four days late In arriving because ofa strike, and the beauty Items hadn't even arrived when we opened. 
"The location was trouble. We were on the second floor of LaFortune, but you have to go up three flights ofsteps to get there. No one seemed to know where we were. Of course, there wasn't any passing traffic up there to just stop by, either. By the time we got all the supplies in and the new hours ap­proved, the semester was practically over anyway," he said. 
The renovations of La Fortune created a new problem for the busi­ness. Originally, it was hoped that there would be space in the building for both the student store and Rock du Lac. But early this year the stu­dent business manager, Rob Hoover, was informed that there would be space for only one store. 
"We had to decide which store's existence should be continued. So we chose to try to combine the two. Rock du Lac is being expanded to in­clude some items with a more col­legiate appeal. The new store will sell T-shirts, posters, and maybe some smaller electronics as well as records and tickets," Hoover said. 
"I'm not sorry to see (the Student Saver Store) go. My own personal opinion is that it was all politically motivated. There were so many compromises made in the original proposal that it was doomed before it started. I'd much rather see the money being spent on the record store than on a business not doing well," he said. 
Attempts to reach administr:atlve officials for comment were un­successful. 
Because the record store doesn't have an agreement with the Univer­sity requiring administration ap­proval ofpolicy changes, it has more freedom, Hoover said. 
"The Cellar (the name of the new store) is not under the Student Saver Store proposal. Because we won't be In competition with the bookstore, we can avoid most of the problems encountered by the store," said Hoover.

In Brief 
The John Cardinal O'Hara Award, honoring a 

former Notre Dame student who later served the University in a distinguished capacity, will be awarded this year to Walter Ml Langford ofSan Diego, Calif. The 1930 graduate was a member ofthe Notre Dame faculty from 1931 to 1974 and organized foreign study programs in Central and South America while serving as chairman of the department of modern and classical languages. Langford also or· ganized Notre Dame's participation in Peace Corps training programs. The award was established by the Notre Dame Alumni Association in 1983 to honor the 12th president of the University who later was named cardinal archbishop of Philadelphia. It will be presented to Langford at the 1986 Alumni Reunion in the ACC on June 6. · Tbe Observer 
More than 9,000 auto accidents involving alcohol were reported betweenjanuary and September 1985 by the Indiana State Police. Alcohol was blamed for more than 140 fatalities during the same period. One of the leading misconceptions about driving and alcohol is that a person has to be drunk to be dangerous, accord· ing to the Indiana State Medical Association. Even at alevel of .05 percent blood alcohol content(halfofIndiana's legal limit) a person is twice as likely to have an accident than if driving sober. A report from the American Medical Association's Council on Scientific A.f· fairs indicates alcohol causes deterioration of driving skills begin· ning at .05 percent with deterioration progressing rapidly with rising blood alcohol content until driving skills become seriously impaired at .10 percent. · Tbe Observer

Increase in liability lawsuits puts fear into hearts of many 
Some signs are subtle, others flash blue and gold print outside Notre Dame Stadium. 
Obstetricians and surgeons leave their practices. Bartenders refuse to serve drinks. And rollerskating rinks close their doors. 
These are signs offear. Granted, it has not yet reached epidemic proportions. Most people are not awakened by nightmares of liability lawsuits. Yet fear of lawsuits and skyrocketing insurance rates has had a tangible im· pact on our lives, both as Notre Dame students and as future doctors, engineers and lawyers. 
A high school teacher once told me, "You can sue anybody for anything, but you won't always win." Today, more people are suing others for more things than ever before. And some of them are winning. 
Engineering firms may be sued ·when someone is injured using equipment they desjgn, even ifthat equip· ment is used incorrectly. Handgun manufacturers may be sued for damages from a shooting. Even rock stars are vulnerable. Parents of a teenage son who committed suicide filed suit against Ozzy Osbourne last week, claiming his song lyrics in· fluenced their son's decision to shoot himself. 
Why the spread ofliability~·

suits? U.S. News and Worlc Report traces it to change _...) in law and society. "N ~' longer is the decisive ques ~ tion whether the party sued · the defendent · negligently harmed someone. The ques­tion now centers on how much the plaintiff ought to be compensated for in­juries."· 
Also, the spread ofliability insurance has led to the at· titude that no one is hurt by law suits except insurance companies. Ofcourse, in reality consumers pick up the bills via increased insurance rates. Not only do we pay more for car insurance, but manufacturers tack in· creased insurance rates onto their prices. 
These hikes in insurance rates can have drastic ef· fects. Ice and roller skating rinks are shutting down or going without insurance because of high rates. Some towns are closing their recreation departments and swimming pools because they cannot afford to pay for insurance. 
Perhaps doctors suffer most from insurance rate hikes. Some doctors leave their practices rather than pay S50,000 a year in malpractice insurance. Others are opting for early retirements, choosing not to risk in· volvement in a malpractice suit. 
"To err is human, to forgive divine," said Alexander Pope in his often-quoted "Essay on Criticism." Humans, however, are not allowed to 'err' today without threat

ofa lawsuit, and divine forgiveness is practiced only by those poor suckers who haven't been tempted by million-dollar damage suits. 
No longer are we allowed to make mistakes. En· gineers cannot design machines that will never mal­function, especially ifoperated improperly. One cannot predict the future when manufacturing a product; if a drug approved by the 'FDA and manufactured by a chemical company is later found to be dangerous, can the company really be blamed?

mistakes that traditionally would be considered our own. 
A bartender can be sued if a patron is involved in a drunk driving accident. A homeowner can be sued if someone is injured while trespassing. One woman (unsuccessfully) sued a tobacco company when her husband died ofc~ncer. 
For victims, all this is somewhat attractive. As victims, we can blame our own mistakes on another's supposed negligence, and perhaps pick up some pocket money in the bargain. As (potentially) insured consumers and professionals, we could suffer from higher prices, high insurance rates and unexpected lawsuits. 
Right now, the alcohol policy may be our most tan­gible evidence ofthe fear ofdamage suits. But ifcurrent trends continue, many of us may someday be joining our pre-law friends in court.

Controversial Senior Fellow award to reappear this year after hiatus 

By KATHY BERRY 
News Staff 

The Senior Fellowship Award, which has been riddled with con· troversy in the last two years, will be resurrected this year, according to Senior Class President john Spatz. 
The award is given to a member of the present Notre Dame community who has had an important influence on the senior class. 
"The recipient must have affected the senior class and influenced the prospects ofthe class. It is necessary that the individual upholds the Notre Dame spirit, and works to aug­ment the progression of the school and its philosophies," Spatz said. 
"The individual must also uphold the Christian ideals and morals that are so evident in the Notre Dame community," he said. 
Nominations will be taken sometime in April and voting will follow at a later date. The presenta­tion will take place at the cocktail party during senior week. 
Two years ago the nominating committee refused to allow Harold 
B. Augustine to be put on the award ballot. Augustine was the Notre Dame alumnus noted for h.is saying, "A wet campus is a happy campus." 
"The administration probably thought the student body was making a big joke of the award and consequently withdrew Augustine's name from the ballot," said George Apt, second year Notre Dame M.B.A. student. 
Although William Hickey, Univer­sity food services director, was nominated for the award, said Apt, "The seniors refused to elect anybody Senior Fellow, and no award was given that year. It was basically forgotten." 

The nominating committee's desire to preserve prestige for the award backfired, as there was no Senior Fellow named last year eit­her, he said. 
"We want to revive the award this year because we want to recognize an individual who upholds the Notre Dame ideal, lives his life in Christian fashion, and is a practical example of what we can achieve down the road," said Spatz. 

High school students' contribution 
goes toward cutting national debt 
The Oblervu/Trtpp Baltz 

When Harold B. Augustine was prevented jrvm receiving the an­nual Senior Fellow Award two years ago, seniors voted not to present the award, ending the tradition for the past two years. But this year, students are trying to revive the award. Story at right. 
A8110CiatedPn:88 
DELPHI, Ind. -A SIOO contribu­tion by Delphi Community High School students to help reduce the national debt has received some at· tention on Capitol Hill. 

In a speech on the U.S. Senate floor, Senator Dan Quayle, R-Ind., commended the students for generating grassroots support for a balanced budget. 
"While $100 may not go far toward erasing ... a $2 trillion debt, the energy, spirit and dedication and sense of civic responsibJJity dis­played by these young Hoosiers will do much to secure the future of our nation," Quayle said Tueday. 
The students' teacher, Thomas L. Miller, said Wednesday that ap­proximately 30 students from Car­roll County wanted to become 
involved after studying about the 
federal deficit last fall. 
The students, mostly seniors, or­ganized a group called Students Against Inflated Deficit Spending, or SAIDS, and started a petition drive at the school. They got 313 of their 500 classmates to sign a petition ur­ging Indiana's congressional delega­tion to push for the balanced budget measure. 
The students also raised $1 00 through a raffle they applied toward reducing the federal deficit. 
'The money aspect was simply to draw attention to the petitions," Mil­ler said. "I guess it worked."

Fire in luxury Indian hotel kills 38; one American among the dead 
NEW DELHI, India -Fire raged  
through a luxury hotel before dawn  
yesterday, killing at least 38 people,  
Indian officials said. One American  
was among the dead, and 38 people  
were hospitalized.  
Some victims were found in their  
beds, and others escaped by break­ 
ing windows, tying bedsheets toget­ 
her and lowering themselves to the  
ground. Several leaped to their  
death from the 1 0-story Siddharth  
Continental Hotel, which is near the  
airport in the upper-class Vasant  
Vihar suburb, fire officials said.  
Police and fire officials said it was  
the worst hotel fire in the Indian  
capital since independence from  
Britain in 1947.  
About half the victims were  
foreigners but names were not  
released pending notification of  
relatives, police said. The victims in­ 
r  cluded a West German diplomat and  
r  his wife, an Argentine diplomat,  
r  three Britons, two Japanese, two  
r,  Australians, an Iraqi, a Soviet citizen and the American.  

"It was only by the grace of God we got out alive," said Jane Rosser, an official for the U.S. relief agency CARE, who is based in Bangkok, Thailand. "If I had awakened minutes later in that hotel without lights, I wouldn't be here." 
She said she herded a half-dozen people into a room, smashed open a window and got them to tie bed­sheets together. They lowered themselves about 30 feet and dropped onto a balcony, then groped their way to a fire escape. 
"I knew that when I opened the door and gulped the smoke I would be dead if I didn't act. I must have done what I had seen in the movies," Rosser, a native of Newton, Mass., said. 
She told the Associated Press she heard no fire alarm, the hotel lights were out, and there were no auxiliary lights marking emergency exits on the fifth floor where she stayed. She also said there was no working sprinkler system, the win­dows wouldn't open, and she saw no one organizing rescue operations.

Two students were arrested and scores face disciplinary action ran­ging from probation to expulsion, campusofficials said later in the day. 
Extreme cold temperatures during last year's run around Cary Quad prompted Purdue President Steven Beering to ban the event this year. This time, however, the tem­perature was a relatively mild 38 degrees. 
At least 20 plainclothes campus police officers attempted to stop the nude runners, but policeonly netted two arrests. 
Police Chief)ohn Woods was the only known casualty, according to 
Joe Bennett, director of university relations. 
"Police were routinely stopping runners and getting names," Bennett said. "One runner refused to do that and he bolted and ran into Woods. The two fell and there was a pileup." 
As Woods tried to get up, Bennett said, one runner in the pileup took a swing at the police chief. Woods suf­fered cutsand bruises, Bennettsaid. 
Robert Pritchard, 19, was arrested for assaulting the police officer. The other student, whose name was not immediately available, was arrested for public intoxication and resisting law officers, Bennett said. 
Meanwhile, police and residence hall supervisors were busy later Wednesday compiling names ofpar­ticipants in the run. 
"Disciplinary measures will be on a case-by-case basis," Bennett said. "The people who are going to be dis­ciplined will receive notice in writing" in about a week. 
One spectator, Sandy Eulitt, 23, said she came from Fort Wayne to watch the race. Eulitt, who ran two years ago, said a friend called about 8 
p.m. Tuesday and told her the run was scheduled. 
"I don't really care what Beering says," said runner Andy Banta, 20. "I ran to have some fun. It's something different to do. It's not really as cold as the past few years." 
Beering was asleep during the race, which began about midnight, according to a man who answered the telephone at Deering's home. 
The university president said later in the day that violation of the ban would not be taken lightly. 
School officials also are consider­ing disciplinary measures against 1i male students who staged another nude run Sunday night. They raced around the outside of Owen Hall dorm, said floor senator Pat Bobillo, a junior who· said he was in the group. 


Indiana mother and four children victims of mobile trailer home fire 
GARY, Ind. -A woman and four children died yesterday morning when fire swept through their mobile home in Gary, authorities said. 
Detective William Burns, a spokesman for the Gary Police Department, said the mobile home was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived at the scene and that officials did not know im­mediately that anyone was inside.

pearance contract, a car, a boat, jewelry and a wardrobe for ap­pearances, and a 5-year supply of cosmetics, according to McDonnell. 
McDonnell will leave for Miami in late April to prepare for the big con­test. A state director has assumed the role of her contact and will help get her ready for the May pageant. McDonnell will be speaking with him frequently throughout the semester. 
She will go home during spring 
around the trailer fur the last few days," Burns said. "No one actually knew there was anyone inside. They (the firefighters) were just trying to fight the fire." 
Burns identified the victims as Bethann Spriggs, 24, and her four children: Charles, 3; Kenneth Jr., 2; and 9-month-old twins, Brian and Brandy, a girl. 
It was the second major mobile home fire in the state within eight days. On Jan. 15 four children died in a similar blaze in Livonia in sout­hern Indiana. 
"This was a fairly dim comet, best viewed in the Southern Hemi­sphere," Ernst said. 
Because ofthe less-than-ideal con­ditions and the few opportunities to view it, many people have not ac­tually been able to see Halley's comet, he said. 
A group of physicists discussed the comet and a computer program that mapped its trajectory, said Joseph Bellina, assistant professor of physics at Saint Mary's . .!!But, as it turned out, none of them had ac­tually seen the comet," Bellina said. 
break to fulfill the duties of Miss Vir­ginia. These include being in parades, doing promotions, and making other appearances. Her director will also be helping her with forms and pictures. "But I don't want to go back and forth all the time," she said. 
McDonnell hopes to pursue a marketing career after she graduates. During the summer, she models at her home in Alexandria. "I'd like to model if it comes," she said. "Modeling is fun and it pays 
well. But it's unsteady." 
The twins were round in the front of the home, which suffered the brunt ofthe fire damage, and the ot­hers were in a back bedroop:~., Burns said. 
"Apparently they (the twins) were asleep on some type of sofa bed, at least that's what we assume. The two 9-month-olds were burned beyond recognition. 
"The heavy concentration of fire was in the front of the trailer and it appeared it could have started in the kitchen area or the living room," Bums said. 
The chances ofviewing the comet again this year are slim, according to the experts. The comet will reap­pear in late February, but it will be only viewable just prior to sunrise, Ernst said. 
To see Halley's comet before the light of the sun prevents i,t ,"you must be high enough to see very low in the South-eastern horizon, about one half-hour before sunup," he said. Also, the viewer must wait for the two-week period between new and full moon, and hope for a clear mor­ning, Ernst said. 
McDonnell's parents are elated about their daughter's success. "My dad was stunned. He's kind of strict about education. But when he heard the news, he was stunned," McDon­nell said. "My mom was so happy. She handled everythinikeeping in touch with the officials of the pageant." 
The new Miss Virginia is looking forward to the pageant in Miami. "I'm so psyched. I can't wait to go to Miami," said McDonnell. "I had so much fun last weekend. I just can't wait."

We are all part of Martin Luther King's dream 

Father Robert Griffin 
letters to a lonely God 
n Monday night television, on a
0 program in honor of Martin Luther King's birthday, a small army of black performers paid tribute to the great civil rights leader. As each one finished, he or she declared with pride: "And lam part ofhis dream." Hearing the refrain repeated set me to thinking: "l too am part of his dream." 
King's dream was one ofblacks and whites together in brotherhood and sisterhood, living In peace, equals as Americans and as the children of God. He dreamed of freedom for the down-pressed and the victims of injustice. This could only come true if the oppressors themselves underwent a change of heart which would free them from hatred, fear, and the slavery to prejudice. 
He had seen the red-necked sheriffs willing to let the police dogs loose against the demonstrators on the streets of Selma. He dreamed of them halting such horrors, delivered ofthe ugli· ness in their souls which made their behavior uncivilized, cruel and obS<.·ene. lie dreamed of arousing Americans to righteous anger over the humiliations imposed as a lifestyle on black America. He 
dreamed ofstirring all ofus out of 
the indifference which tolerated 
children, white and black, going to 
bed hungry. 
His dream was as big as America's dream of itself as the home ofthe brave, the land ofthe free. Whether we liked him or not, his dream Included you and me. He was a patriot who believed in the Con­stitution. He died for keeping us honest about the promises that the Constitution made to all ofthe people ofthe country. He did us a favor by confronting us with the racial bigotry which is our national sin. 
Monday night, as I turned off the television and went to the chapel to say Mass, I kept realizing, "I'm part ofhis dream." At Mass, I spoke a few words about what it felt like to live through the '60s, during the heyday of the civil rights movement, when we watched the confrontations and demonstrations every night on television. I remember my old Irish mother saying (with singular in­sight, I thought): "IfI had been created black, I think I might hate God for a.I.lowing me to suffer so much." 
King didn't hate God or teach his people to hate God. When he died, the students had another civil rights song to add to "We Shall Overcome." It was Abraham, Mar­tin, and John: "Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham?" Later, Robert Kennedy's name was added to those of his brother, Lincoln and King. America's dream, in that ter­rible decade ofthe Vietnam War, had a lot ofsadness in it. A student became very angry when we sang "America the Beautiful" in church, because it seemed such a mockery ofeverything. 
Alot of us coould have stood beside Harry Belafonte and Bill Cosby to say: "I am part ofhis dream." Our saying it wouldn't mean we were just trying to climb on a popular bandwagon. Years ago, Tom Wolfe wrote "Radical Chic" to make fun of Leonard Bernstein and his wife, entertaining the Black Panthers in their fashionable Park Avenue apartment. I could never be called "radical chic" for being grate­ful to Dr. King for including me in his great vision. 
Now those ofus who believed in King have visions ofour own. I like seeing blacks at Notre Dame; like everyone else, I wish there were more of them. Fifty years ago, Notre Dame didn't admit blacks. The University president of those days is quoted in his biography as saying Notre Dame was not ready to admit blacks, because ofthe large number ofSoutherners alrady here. They might decide to drop out, and go to state colleges, he said, where they could hurt their souls. Father Hes­burgh has brought us a long way from those narrow days ofthe Cat­holic ghetto. 
I have a dream ofblacks enrich­ing the Catholic Church by becoming members in large num­bers; they would bring us someth­ing very special called "soul." The nation was exposed to the power of "soul" at Dr. King's funeral; "soul" is alive and well today in the great black singers and in the style ofthe Rev. Jesse Jackson when he speaks. 
Maybe, as Catholics, we read too much St. Paul. A great minister at Boston talked about his grandmot­her, a former slave. "When I would go to see her as a seminary stu· dent," he said, "she would ask me to read her the Bible, except she never wanted to hear St. Paul. Every Sun­day, during slavery days, the master would read his workers the lines from St. Paul: 'Slaves be subject to your masters.' Maybe the Pope could invent a liturgy which puts St. Paul on the back burner. I'IJ! sure women would bless him for doing it. 
I have a dream that when I watch the local news in New York, I will not see a disproportionate number ofyoung blacks in handcuffs being led to jail. The cities are very hard on black kids brought up in filth and poverty. "A mind is a terrible thing to waste." Yet even after King, the waste goes on. 
Please God, there is now some hope. The black messiah died nearly 20 years ago. Harlem, I would guess, is as ugly as ever. Kids, who should have become lawyers, doctors and astronauts, never get a chance. They're dead from violence and drugs before they reach 16. 
Blacks blame whites, like the president, for not helping them. Whites blame blacks for not helping themselves. Who is to blame? When the children are dying, why bother to ask who is to blame? The ques­tion should be "Who can help?" 
Dreams don't come like movies, In color, or In black and white. Dreams, if they are worthy of humanity, come as visions oftlesh and blood. All ofus, as Americans, are asked to be parents to a genera­tion with racial diversities, a rain· bow coalition ofurchins and moppets. Every child in danger is my responsibility. Who is that child, shown stabbed to death by a maniac, pictured in the paper? It's my precious lamb. The death is the beginning of my nightmare. 
People in every generation have to dream Martin Luther King's dream after him; as Christians, we are candidates. Ifwe don't dream the dream, and work to make it come true, we are doomed to relive the nightmares which ruin America as the Promised Land. 


Higher goals for the Irish as they prepare for Miami 
These are thf' 14th and 15th episodes in The Obsener's serial publication ofthe Notre Dame football story, 'The Gipper's Ghost. "In last week's episode, victories over Stanford and Pittsburgh had raised the record ofthe surprising Fighting Irish to 3-1-1, and the Notre Dame campus had renewed its legendary spirit as the game against No.4 Miami loomed ahead. 
Kelly's promise­
"The Fighting Irish ofNotre Dame ... your Fighting Irish ... plan to win every game the rt:'st of the sc.·ason. Your Fighting Irish will win a bid to a major bowl game. Your Fight­ing Irish will finish this season ranked among the top I 0 teams in the nation." 
The Glpper's Gho~ 
Chapters 14& 15 W 
lie stopped for just a slight moment. 
"And we are going to start that victory 
march tomorrow by upsetting Miami for 
you in our stadium!" 
It was almost too much for the win­starved Notre Dame student body. The band, recognizing a good cue when it heard one. instantly played the Victory March. 
The crowd was besides itself. Coach 
Kelly had not only said it, he sounded like 
he meant it. 
In turn, Collins. O'Connor and Lee took 
centerstage and delivered rousing pep talks. 
O'Connor stole the show with his impres­
sion of Ronald Reagan doing George Gipp. 
An older Holy Cross priest was overheard 
to say it rivaled Pat O'Brien's rendition of 
K.nute Rockne. 


God only knows 
T 
hings are going rather well, K.nute. Why do you need My help?': said the voice of God. 
"Well. I know how much you enjoy a good practical joke, Lord," Rockne said. "I thought you'd want to be in on the fun." 
"Hmmm. Well ... it could be very funny. I'll do it!" 
"Thanks, Lord." 
Rockne caught the early morning rainbow back to Indiana. He was glad the planning session had gone well. Everything goes a little better with God's help, he thought. 


Football Saturday 
T 
he Golden Dome blazed in sunlight 
against the backdrop ofan unclouded 
brilliant blue sky. Perfect weather for a 
football weekend. 

This morning, northern Indiana had bedecked itself in its best autumn clothes. The trees were turning. Red, gold, and brown leaves blended well with the yellow­buff bricks of the buildings ofNotre Dame. 
walkways. Sales ofhot dogs, hamburgers, bratwurst and soda pop were brisk. A favorite stop was the Knights ofColumbus concession, ~enowned for its steak sandwiches. 
The oldest buildings were actually derived from the Indiana earth; rich marl deposits in St. Mary's Lake had yielded enough raw materials to allow the University to produce its own bricks and mortar. 
Sedan, vans, and recreational vehicles streamed from the exit ramps ofthe Indiana Toll Road. Uniformed South Bend police and Indiana state troopers kept traffic flowing smoothly as the sons and daughters ofNotre Dame returned for a weekend visit. 
On campus, various student groups commenced setting up outdoor grills, yellow saworses and blue tabletops at choice locations along the busiest 
The most popular place ofall was the 
Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore. The first 
floor was alive with two colors· gold and 
blue. The merchandise sparkled; the staff 
had started dusting offthe inventory after 
the Pitt victory and the job was now almost 
complete. T-shirts, caps, jackets, pennants, 
collectors' plates, coffee mugs and various 
carried the words "Notre Dame" or bore 
the famous leprechaun, with his upraised 
fists, or the familiar NO monogram. 
Books could be found on the second 
floor, if one was willing to climb the stairs. 
Outside, bedsheet banners hung 
everywhere. One urged the Irish to weat· 
her the Hurricanes. One draped from a 
Sorin Hall turret offered an encouraging 
"Go Irish!" Still another, handing from the 
Administration Building, addressed a 
special audience, "Dear Alumni, send 
money." At first the alumni passing by 
thought it was a joke, then, realizing it hung ·from the window of the development 
office, knew better. 
As morning turned to afternoon, the women of Saint Mary's began wandering over in groups along the service road which led them past Holy Cross Hall and St. Mary's Lake to the center ofcampus. 
The unofficial opening of the football game was the band's pre-game outdoor concert. An hour or so before the kickoff, the band assembled on the front steps of the Administration Building. The show served as a final full-dress rehearsal for the halftime performance. Tonight's program was titled "An Irish Celebration," and an appreciative audience applauded perfor­mances of the Minstrel Boy, Foggy Dew, and The Garryowen. 
Near the conclusion of the program, the band announcer intoned, "... and now we invite you to join in as the Band of the Fighting Irish plays the greatest ofall fight songs: The Notre Dame Victory March!" 
Immediately afterward, in the light of the setting sun, the faithful began the proces· sion to Notre Dame Stadium.

Writer just here doin' the Super Bowl Shuffle 

~ 
Yes, it is that time of the year again. The 20th annual rite of the Super Bowl has captured America one more time. The hype and excitement has already started so even the most casual fan will pay close attention to this Sunday's activities in New Orleans. 
Brian Broderick 
sincerely yours 

These games are rarely super; neither will they bowl you over. Yet the whole spectacle of the event takes the country by storm, oc­cupying approximately five hours of the lives ofAmericans who generally have nothing bet­ter to do with their time. 
This year our campus has been blessed with the presence ofthe Chicago Bears in the Super Bowl. The Chicago contingent is louder this year than they were last year when the Cubs choked. But please tell me, how many ofus are sick and tired of the Fridge and psuedo-hip quarterbackJim McMahon? 
We the people of America have been vic­timized by an unprecedented media barrage about the Bears. It is not over yet. Just think if they win the Super Bowl. The Fridge may run for President. 
New England suffers from the anonymity which we all hope would affiict Chicago. The Patriots are the surprise team of the year and possibly the decade. Who would have ex­pected that the place that gave 05 dam chow­der would produce a championship-caliber football team? 
Back to the campus. It is easy to distinguish the Bears fans from the Patriot fans. The Bear fans chug, go' unshaven and believe jim McMahon is the Second Coming. Patriot fans sip, wear argyles and really hope that their team plays a good game. 
OK, enough about the participants. What is really important is the pre-game hype (the most overused word in sports history). All that matters is what happens before the game ~here we learn everything from the punter's favorite childhood activity to the trainer's concern over the libyan crisis. 
The key, naturally, is to see how high up we can build the game. It is World War III. It is the toughest defense against the best offense and ofcourse the same applies to both teams. 
Each team sits atop an unattainable pedes­tal. Then each team proceeds to play average­to-good football for 60 minutes, which is inexplicably stretched into four hours, and everyone sits back and wonders why they got so excited the whole week. 
Could we do without all of the excitement and hype of Super Bowl week? Would our lives be complete? Probably so. However, would we have as much fun without it? Probably not. The whole concept ofthe Super Bowl and all that surrounds it is a vital piece of modern Americana. It is something that belongs solely to America and is an important part of our lifestyle. Despite the commer­cialism and the overpublicity, the main in­gredient of Super Sunday is there, and that is fun. 
By the way, I hope I did not offend anyone' with my comments on the Bears and Patriots because I did not write this to cause no trouble, I'm just here doin' the Super Bowl Shume.

Learned most critical lessons outside of school 

After one semester in law school, my head is swimming in new knowledge. I feel I've learned as much in the past four months as I did in the previous four years. But, as always, I think the most important things I've learned have been outside the classroom. 
Mike Wllkins 
here, there and back 

I've always been a strong believer in the idea that you go to collegefor two reasons: to get an education and to learn. The education I received at Notre Dame, and continue to receive in law school, .iii one of the finest anywhere. More importantly, the things I've learned here -things that were not taught to me in any classroom-have changed who I am and who I will be.. 
I already had to summarize the education I received over the last semester in order to inake it through final exams. But I think it's important to summarize the other things I have learned in my first semester of law school.  
 Not everyone here is a 22-year-old single student with nothing more important to worry about than whether or not he's going to be prepared for class the day he's called on. 
Law students are different from what I'm used to. Many ofthem are older and several of them are married and supporting families of their own. For someone who has spent the past four years in one of the most homogeneous environments one can create, this was a tough lesson to learn. 
About two weeks into classes, I became at­tracted to a girl in several of my classes. After much debate, I talked myself into asking her out. As luck would have it, one day we were walking out to the parking lot together. 1 started small talk, hoping to steer the con­versation in the direction of a possible date. 
We were talking about the neighborhoods we lived in and I recognized the name ot her neighborhood as being uncommonly nice for a student's residence. Being someone in­nocent and having not yet learned my first les­son in law school, I asked her if she lived alone, expectng that she would say she lived with her parents or was renting a room in a house. I was terribly embarrassed (and more than a little disappointed) when she said she lived with her husband. My first lesson was quick, but far from painless. 


 There is life beyond the friendly confines of the Golden Dome. 
-
This is an extension of the first thing I learned. As an undergraduate, I was so wrapped up in my studies and other student­type activities that I often forgot there were other people out there besides Domers, alumni, professors, sports opponents and SMC chicks. But this year I have more interaction with "real people" and I'm frequently reminded ·that not everything I do has to revolve around Notre Dame. 
Luckily, I've been able to get involved with something that has no connection with school whatsoever. I'm helping to coach a high school hockey team in South Bend and I'm having the time ofmy life doing it. First ofall, it makes me feel the way I did when I used to play. I've missed that feeling very much but now it makes me look forward to going out to the rink for every practice and every game, even though coaching takes a lot oftime away from my studies. 
More importantly, I can actually see these kids learning the things 'I've tried to teach them. One of the nicest things that happened to me this year was when the mother ofone of my players came up to me and told me she could see that her son had improved since I had worked with him. That's the kind of reward I can't get from studying. 
 There's nothing like a good rumor (or a bad one, for that matter). 
I've never had more fun at Notre Dame than the short time between when Gerry Faust resigned and when Lou Holtz was named new football coach. I've heard hundreds ofrumors in my years here, but never have the rumors flown as freely as this past fall. 
The problem with a rumor is that it is only good until the next one comes along. Unfor· tunately, many people (including the local news media) aren't aware of this. If we had judged"rumors based on which ones sounded the most believable, Dick Vermeil would now be head coach and would be living comfor­tably in a newly carpeted house somewhere in Knollwood. The way to deal with rumors is to uncover as many as you possibly can and believe the last one you've heard until the truth finally comes out. 
 Above all else, keep everything in perspective. 
This is another lesson that was particularly hard to learn, even though it had been taught to me once already. During finals, when stu­dents tend to lose all grasp on reality, I came back to earth with a thud. A very good friend of mine was seriously injured in an auto acci­dent and came as close to death as I would ever want to come. 
Something like that tends to give you a dif­ferent perspective on things: as I lay in bed before my last final, I prayed that my friend would be OK instead of praying that I would pass my exam the next morning. Many things besides Contracts went through my mind that night. I remembered how important my friends are to me and how much I take them for granted. I realized that worse things could· happen to me than flunking out oflaw school and that no matter how bad the morning's test went, things were going a helluva lot worse for many people. 
I learned this lesson once before and, like Sociology of Sport or Russian Civ., I forgot it. I'd like to think that I'm smarter now and that I won't make the same mistake twice. Hope­fully, this time I won't forget what I've learned.

A watery grave 

Lakes are final rest for church statues 
MARY REYNOLDS 
features writer 
E 
ver wonder where a religious 
statue goes when it dies? It 
doesn't go to heaven. At Notre 
Dame it is more than likely that, 
when a religious statue becomes 
old and worn, it goes to the bottom 
ofSt. Joseph's or St. Mary's Lake. 
According to Father Daniel R. 
Jenky, rector ofSacred Heart 
Church, the Sacred Heart com­
munity has heen using the lakes to 
dispose ofhroken and worn statues 
since the 19th century. "It's a well­
known fact in the Sacred Heart 
community that there are a lot of 
things at the bottom ofthe lakes," 
Jenky said. 
When holy objects are disposed 
of they must be burned, buried or 
submerged in water. "We wouldn't 
just toss out something that's been 
used for worship or in church," 
Jenky said. The objects are made 
unusable and "reverently disposed 
of' as a means ofshowing respect 
for them. 
All flammable objects, such as 
vestments and altar linens, are 
burned. "A couple times a year we 
have a huge bonfire," Jenky said. 
Objects that can't be burned are thrown into one of the two lakes. "We do it at times when nobody is around," Jenky said. He described the process as reverent, although not ceremonious. 
The disposal of the statues is usually performed by the sacristans, or by maintenance workers ifthe statue is larger. Occasionally a job is even too large for maintenance. The one-ton statue ofjesus and Mary which was recently removed from the Grotto after sustaining damage in the September fire last semester is currently sitting in storage until maintenance figures out how it should be disposed. "We don't have the equipment to handle a statue of that size," Donald Dedrick, director of the Physical Plant, said. 
The statues that are disposed of are usually broken. "We don't throw out much," saidjenky. "Nothing of historic or artistic value is thrown out." 
Nothing ofvalue is cast away. that is, except for the gold crown lying at the bottom ofSt. Mary's Lake. It seems that in the early 19205 the crown, which an early issue of Scholastic magazine describes as "a crown ofsolid gold, studded with precious stones and inlaid with pearls," was dumped into St. Mary's Lake. 

Nothing of value is cast away, that is, except for the gold crown lying at the bottom of St. Mary's Lake. 
The crown was given to Notre Dame in 1866 as a gift from the Empress Eugenic, wife ofNapoleon III, emperor of France. It was originally put on display in the church. 
Eventually the crown was removed and it passed into obscurity for several years. In 1886 two crowns were stolen from the church and it was feared that the Eugenic crown was among them. In time, however, the crown turned up at St. Micheal's Laundry, where it apparently had been sent for safe keeping after the theft ofthe other two crowns. 
Years passed, and the crown was placed in the attic of Holy Cross seminary. The crown was then forgotten for several years. 
The crown later reappeared as a prop for the annual Christmas play at the seminary. By then, the semi­narians had no idea ofthe crown's value. The crown continued to be used as a prop in Washington Hall and local South Bend plays. 
Over the years the condition of the crown declined until finally it was dropped and shattered. Even­tually the crown was thrown out and subsequently was dumped into St. Mary's Lake. The mistake was not discovered by the University until several years later. 
.. 
'Ibe exact value of the crown is not known. The exact location of the crown is also unknown, al­though a Scholastic magazine dating from the early 1950s states, "it is thought to be along the shore ofSt. Mary's Lake near the Old College," since that area was used for dum­ping during the University's early days. 
Somewhere In the mud ofSt. Mary's Lake, the crown still sits. Scuba diving, anyone?

Katie said he used "pork and beans" in the first line because "it rhymes with New Orleans" and also because it refers to a nationally publicized canned food drive for the needy he headed recently. 
A national magazine referred to Katie as the judge who collects pork and beans.

Burge leads 'A Chorus Line' 
Associated Pre88 
T 
hese days Gregg Burjl;e is dancing in double time. 
On Broadway, he earns cheers nightly in "Song and Dance," the Andrew lloyd Webber musical starring Bernadette Peters. On film, he leaps across the screen and steals it in the movie version of"A Chorus Line." 
At the age of 27, Burge may be the best dancer now on Broadway. He's a performer knowg for his exuberance, a quality that shows in every step he takes. 
"I really do enjoy dancing, on top of the fact that it is my career," says Burge, sitting in his spartan dressing room at the Royale Theater where "Song and Dance" is currently playing. "That's where the energy comes from." 
"Song and Dance" tells the story of an English girl, played by Miss Peters, who looks for love in New York and Los An-geles. The first act is all song, the second all dance, and that's where Burge shines. He plays what he describes as "a guard-ian angel" who looks after the musical's hero, Joe, a nice guy from Nebraska who comes to New York and falls in love with Miss Peters. 
The dances in the musical were choreographed by Peter Martins, who along with Jerome Robbins co-directs the New York City Ballet. Martins required that all the dan· cers in "Song and Dance" have strong classical training. 
"He had auditioned a lot of them but many ofthe Broad way dancers didn't meet his level oftechnique which is classic ballet," Burge says. 
Broadway dancing is not classical ballet and in order to successfully blend the twoin "Song and Dance," Martins relied on Burge's expertise in musical theater. It is an expertise honed during long runs in such musical hits as "The Wiz," in which he played the Scarecrow for three years, and "Sophisticated Ladies," the Duke Ellington tribute that had him tapping on stage with Gregory Hines. 
"Peter didn't have any ex­perience in tap," Burge says. "He knew that in order for the show to be as successful as possible, he would have to take contributions not just from myself but from everybody connected with the show." 
Burge choreographed two num­bers in the.show-a big dance num­ber with a Wall Street setting and a tap duet for Joe and himself. The work earned him the title "co­choreographer" for the production. 
It was Burge who had to ~each the classically trained dancers to

tap, a job that he says was not very hard because he gave himself the 
most difficult tap steps. 
"Tap dancing is like being a drummer except you use your feet instead ofdrumsticks," he says. "Rhythm is very important." 
Burge has been tapping for 20 years. He decided he wanted to be an entertainer after watching Sammy Davis Jr. on the "Ed Sullivan Show." His parents -his father worked for the Transit Authority, his mother was a housewife -were supportive. 
There were endless dance classes and then four years at the High School ofPerforming Arts. But Burge earned his keep. He appeared as a regular on public television's "The Electric Company" and made dozens ofcommercials. It was whilt attending the Juilliard School, where he received a bachelor's degree, that Burge appeared in "TheWiz." · 
Now there's a Gregg Burge Dance Studio in Merrick, N.Y., which he directs. 
Now with the movie version of "A Chorus Line," people outside of New York are getting a chance to see Burge in· action. In the film, which was directed by Sir Richard Attenborough and choreographed by Jeffrey Hornaday, Burge played the role of Richie and worked as 1ssistant choreographer, a position distinctly different from his job on "Song and Dance."

Broadway bursts into film with dance extravaganza 
GERTIE WIMMER 


features copy editor 
D 
o you want to dance? 
I would love it, but only ifI could 
dance like any one of the people dancing in 
Richard Attenborough's "A Chorus Line." If 
you thought you saw great dancing in sum· 
mer flicks like "Fiashdance" and ''Footloose," 
you ain't seen nothing yet. There is simply no 
way to describe the perfection and flow of 
movement that these artists show. lmpos· 
sible, incredible, amazing· it's all there. 
Movie review 
A Chorus Line .*** (out of four) 

But wait, there's more. Maybe you don't like "dance" movies. Maybe dancing bores you. Never fear. Not onJy can every person in this movie dance circles around anyone else I've ever seen before, but they can also sing. Yes, even Audrey Landers, the beautiful blonde from the "Dallas" series, can sing. Miracles still come true. 
But you know the score, the musical score, that is. The Broadway musical by the same name was so popular a few years ago that everyone has heard the title song, "A Chorus Line." It was written by the well known composer Marvin Hamllsch. The lyrics to such memorable songs as "Dance 10, Looks 3" were written in collaboration with Ed· ward Kleban. The best part about the score is that ifyou liked it on stage, you'll probably love it in the movie. 
The only star in the film who doesn't at least do a little soft-shoe is Michael Douglas. He puts in a powerful ifstern performance as Zach, the director/choreographer ofthe show. His sadistic streak becomes im· mediately evident to the dancers auditioning for the part, but it is not until his ex-lover Cassie ( Alyson Reed) shows up that the audience really begins to despise him. The love story between these two could have constituted the main part of the plot, but mercifully it doesn't. 
What the movie is about is dancing, the dream ofdancing on Broadway, the dream of making it big. Every one of the dancers who makes it to "final cuts" has his own story, and the most fascinating part of the movie is the characters. 
There are parts, as in any movie, that make you laugh. Matt West as "Bobby," the boy who used to break into people's houses just to rearrange the furniture, is especially good. 
But this movie isn't all laughs and dancing, though. The painful story of"Paul," played by Cameron English, is among the most moving of the "Chorus Line" monologues. 
Although other critics have blasted this movie, claiming that it lacks the spark of the Broadway musical, I found it even more rewarding than the live performance I saw. The camera angles, especially on the dancing figures, brought clarity into the action that my scat in Row Y could not provide. I must admit that I missed the intermission, for the movie seemed to go on indefinitely, but despite that small flaw. it was well worth it. 
About the plot. not much can be said. But who needs plot, anyway? The movie is about dancing and about the separate stories of the people who devote their lives to the art. And ifyou take the movie for what it is, even though it does not have Mikhail Baryshnikov in white tights, it's a superiorly made dance movie.

Macri's decor perfect for enjoyable dining 
LISA YOUNG 
feaiUn!s writer 

I 
f Notre Dame ev.er made the movies and 
the director requested a setting for an 
off-campus restaurant scene, Macri's Deli 
would be the obvious choice. With picnic 
tables and booths which are wooden and 
slightly marred (just so) and walls lined with 
jerseys, banners and, near the bar, a collec­
tion ofbaseball caps-what more needs to be 
said? 

Restaurant 
Macri's Deli 
***"') 
(outoftour) 
Macri's is a delicatessen, and much more. A big-screen television and various video games provide for a constant hum ofactivity, an ambience perfect for cheering on the Fighting Irish on any other favorites. A room adjacent to the main TV room, designed in an outdoorsy motif, is a tranquil change ofpace from the TV room. 
Ofcourse, the menu is excellent, as the appetizers alone are a must. Selections vary from a crock ofonion soup to pizza bread. Their quality tempts one to forget about the rest ofthe meal. 
Befitting Macri's collegiate style, all oftheir entrees are served in a wicker basket, nestled with potato chips and a hot pepper. The "Create Your Own" section ofthe menu offers the deli standbys, fixed to perfection. "House Specialties" are Macri's own unique renditions ofthe basic sandwiches, including the "Old Chicago" Oake and Elwood's favorite), "Beefand Company," which claims to weigh a pound, and the "B.R. T." -a bacon, roast beef, and turkey breast sandwich with 

-
melted cheese on an Italian roll. "You won't be disappointed," says the menu, and you won't. 
Even ifyou feel that you can't eat another bite, a look at the dessert display will change your mind. The house specialty is cheesecake, with changing varieties daily. A typical day offers raspberry, pumpkin, turtle and chocolate-chip pies, and such standbys as cannolis, eclairs and apple pie are also available. 
Macri's is not a bar, but wine and beer, including imports, are served. 
For reference, Macri's has carry-out and also offers catering services. For tailgaters or otherwise, three-and six-foot submarine sandwiches can be ordered. 
Macri's is easy to find. Take Douglas Rd. to Grape Road and make a left. Turn right into the shopping mall across froni University Park and look for the neon sign -and a good meal.

Boys from Boston sound like the best kept secret 
I tell you, I love those Bears. I just love them. They are the best. I watch them on the television, and I love to read about them in the paper. You have to like that McMahon kid; he really gets the job done. And you know what? He has fun doing it. You have to like those headbands he wears, making fun ofauthority. Yes, sir, he is a great guy. And how about those shades? He looks great in those shades, let me tell you. And how about that hairdo at the beginning of the season? You have to love it ­this guy Is a nut.

And how about Walter Payton? After all these years, he still has the moves. He can do It all. Did you ever sec him throw the ball? What a great spiral. 
And how about that new kid, the big one, the appliance there. The Refrigerator, you say? Yeah, he is great. I love to see him run with that ball. How big is he, anyway? Three hundred pounds, is that right? He can catch, too. And he even plays defense. I am not kid­ding. I read it In the newspapers. 
P.O.BoxQ 

Chicago can learn from Notre Dame's tradition 
/Jear Editor: 
I write this letter to congratulate Amy Step­han on her fine article criticizing the Chicago Bears fans. She adeptly identifies the atrocious behavior of the Bears fans in which no self­respecting Notre Dame fan would ever par­ticipate. She so perfectly writes with the ideals of Notre Dame in mind that she must be the spirit of Notre Dame personified. We may, in fact, use her letter and the Bears as a guideline to keep Notre Dame pure and safe for all time. Some excellent examples from Amy's letter: 
"... Chicago fans were treated to a halfhour show focusing on the greatest symbol ofBear­hype titled 'Fridge: The legend grows.' " Nobody associated with Notre Dame will ever allow the media to make a legend out of a Notre Dame sports figure! 
"But the Bears do not limit themselves to terrorizing Chicago." Never will Notre Dame put up with fans making a fuss over them In other cities. We all know that the Alumni Clubs, and especially the Subway Alumni, are under strict orders to keep silent about their feeling.~ toward Notre Dame. 
"Even our school mascot, the symbol ofthe Fighting Irish, wore a refrigerator with the number 72 ... .'' We at Notre Dame will M"A"su anyone who would dare disgrace us by publicly wearing clothing with our school's name across it, right Father Mulcahy? 
"Those who like the Bears become Bear­maniacs. Those who dislike the Bears or are indifferent toward them become Bear-haters. "lltere is no middle ground.'' Need I say more? 
"OK., maybe the Bear-hater could survive winter in Chicago by avoiding all discussions concerning football and occasionally hum­ming a bar or two of the 'Super Bo:wl Shume· on his way to work.'' Our school's alma mater Is, admiuedly, constantly going through every student's head much of the time, but we are extremely proud that nothing is made of our Victory March. I bet none of our alumni can remember the whole tune, let alone the words. 
And finally, the most serious accusation that even we at Notre Dame have been seen slip­ping into In recent years. 
And the coach, that Ditldt guy. Boy Is he tough. I bet he eats gravel for breakfast. You know, he is the kind ofguy that lets you know when he Is really ticked off. I like that. You see him, chewing that gum on the sideline. Looks like he could still play, Ditka does. 
And that Singletary kid, is that his name? He looks like Dick Butkus out there, making tackles, hitting people. He is a real monster. And how about that Dent kid? Talk about hur­ting some quarterbacks. He is tough. You know, I really do not think that Miami has a chance on Sunday. 
What did you say? Miami didn't make it? Wow, I thought for sure that they would make it. That Marino kid is so tough. Beat the Bears once already. Boy,l guess that it is going to be a game ofdefense, huh? Those Raiders against our Bears, huh? 
What do you mean, the Raiders got beat? You must be kidding. You are not going to tell me that the jets are going to the Superbowl, are you? God, that Gastineau kid gives me the fits. And how about Klecko, and that quarter­back, O'Brien? They could sure play the Bears tough. What, the jets got beat, too? Then who is playing for the AFC in the Super Bowl? The Steelers again? 
What do you mean, the New England Patriots? Are they a new team? You must be kidding. Did the Raiders move again? What? The guys with the minuteman on their hel­mets? Are they from the USFL or what? You must be pulling my leg. 
Walt a second, I remember. They got that little guy playing quarterback, right? The one with the Heisman? Am I wrong again? Shoot, I just don't remember Boston having a football team. They have basketball, though. Larry Bird, right? So, does he play quarterback for the Boston Patriots or what? 
Tony Eason? That name sounds familiar. Andre Tippett? Never heard ofhim. What, you say he is the best outside linebacker in foot­ball? Funny, I never heard ofhim. Craigjames? Any relation to Jesse james? Is he the guy that does wine cooler commercials with that Bartles guy? God, they are funny. john Han­nah? A nine-time Pro Bowler? He must be pretty good then, huh? Funny I never read about him before, though. 
Wow, Chicago against Boston. Well that will just not ftc the same. I thought the Bears would be playing a real team for the Super Bowl. What a shame. I guess my copy of the "Super Bowl ShufHe" will be worth a little less. Ah, what the heck. At least this Is a sure win for the Bears. Playing a bunch of nobodies from Boston. 
"All this enthusiasm only serves to make Chicago fans look more foolish when their bubble inevitably pops ... But none of this phases Chicago fans. Despite their disappoint­ment, they obstinately support their teams, somehow summoning fresh optimism for each new season." Some Notre Dame loyalists almost fell into this trap with jerry Faust, but I am confident that we will re-evaluate our priorities and "Heave Holtz" before he has a chance to have a losing season. Chicago fans definitely have much to learn from the great Notre Dame tradition.

Civil rights awareness 
on college campuses? 
Dear Editor: 
Do you know how many minority students on this campus are not varsity athletes? Have you ever stopped to think about it? 
Civil rights progress on college campuses is often measured by the success ofthe minority athlete. While the minority athlete is remem­bered, other minority students are often for­gotten. We believe that both the athlete and the non-athlete should be recognized for their academic achievements on college campuses. 
Our "Campus Comments" intended to focus attention upon this issue and to promote individual thought. We hope that our comment was received in this spirit. 
Susan Hayes Tom Considine Notre Dame students 
A campus comment on Campus Comments 
DearEditor: 
How far has Notre Dame come on the issue ofcivil rights? The only rational answer to this question can be that this University has not gone very far at all. Yet I have come across an answer to this question that disturbs me very much. "How many minority students don't play varsity sports?" is the answer that two white upperclassmen gave to the question in Monday's Campus Comments. What kind of attitude is this representative ot? Also in the same Campus Comments, two minority stu­
dents' answers to the same question present a 
startling contrast in minority awareness here. 
One admitted to being unaware prejudice 
even exists at Notre Dame. The other student 
said she feels like an outcast here. How shock­
ing? Not really. It is just the cold, hard truth. 
Another student in the Campus Comments 
tells us "Notre Dame is always behind the 
times." We know how true this can be at 
times, but this is in marked contrast with the 
"liberal" reputation this school has. Why? 
Why? Why? Could it be a jet-set administra­
tion that works hard at enhancing this image 
has Lost sight ofone ofits most important goals 
-to make Notre Dame a truly integrated com­
munity, where all students ofany race, sex or 
religion can thrive? When will the administra­
tion realize it must look not just to the 
problems of race in the world outside Notre 
Dame, but also within? 
What is the point of all this? It is simple. By selecting these six people to respond to the question of the day, The Observer did the Notre Dame community a great service. It brought out into the open (whether by acci­dent or by design: The Observer did it) five distinct attitudes which can speak for the at­titudes of the vast majority of the student body on the minority situation. From left to right the attitudes were: acknowledgement of the problem by one of the "majority;" brush­ing aside the problem through the old "some things will never change" answer; unaware­ness of the problem even existing; a flippant remark; and saddest of all, one of the Notre Dame family who feels like an outcast. What can be done? What will be done? 
Go back and look at Lester Flemons' article from that same issue of The Observer, right above the Campus Comments. This is an ex­varsity football player who has been writing about the minority problems at Notre Dame for at least the two and a halfyears I have been here. We can all take hope from this column, for Flemons hones_tly believes the struggle for minority progress is worth the time and effort to make it a worthwhile and achievable cause. I applaud Flemons. 
I do not apologize ifI have offended any of you. This letter is intended to offend, awaken and question. But I do apologize ifl have taken any of the Campus Comments mentioned out of the context for which they were intended, 
So, who is the coach of this new team, anyway? Raymond Berry, you say? The guy who used to play for the Colts? Well, I guess he was okay. He was sort of an overachiever though. Just a guy off the street they got to catch Johnny Unitas' passes. A real quiet guy, not like Ditka. 
So how did Ray Berry's team get to play in the Super Bowl? Did they win the Massac­husetts lottery? Is this an NBC "Sports Fan­tasy"? Well, you say that they won three games on the road? Heck, that is better than the Chicago Bulls did all season. They beat the jets? And the Raiders? And the Dolphins? What, are you kidding? You say that no one took them seriously? Don Shula must have been shocked? A bunch of basketball players from Boston coached by Ray !;Jerry beat the Dolphins in the Orange Bowl? 
If these guys really beat the Dolphins, then they could be pretty tough. How come 1never heard of them? Sounds like these guys from Boston are the best kept secret in the world. That is such a surprise -I watch television every Sunday and I always read the papers. 
Dan Casey is a junior in the College ofArts and Letters at Notre Dame and a regular Viewpoint columnist. 
though I do not believe I have done so. People should be aware what appears at the moment to be a "cool" remark that will look good han­ging on your door may actually end up wounding some of the very peers you are trying to impress in ways you cannot imagine. Be aware not only of the minority issue at 
Notre  Dame,  but  react  intelligently  to  it.  
That's alii ask.

Calls for University to pave the shoulders 
DearEditor: 
I am the jogger. I returned to campus via Notre Dame Avenue and finished my exercise by running past the lakes. The sidewalks and trails inside the main circle and east gates offer safe running, but my concern lies in the road and shoulder conditions from the east gate to the far end of Notre Dame Avenue. My reason is simple: I was struck by a car while I ran down Juniper Street. Fortunately, I was not injured; however, I was angered. "Why had I been struck?" 
There are three reasons. First, I ran on the wrong side of the road. Second, the poor shoulder conditions, on both sides ofthe road, forced me to run along the white stripe. Third, the driver of the car did not wait until the op­posing traffic had subsided; consequently, he did not try to pass wide ofme. I do fault myself for not running against traffic; however, the shoulder conditions present large difficulties and risks of injury to runners. Large potholes, inconsistencies in the surface, and other obstacles make the shoulder unsafe. As for the driver who struck me, he increased my aware­ness of my responsibilities as a pedestrian and as a driver. 
I hope all joggers who share my concern will take this opportunity to voice their opinion on this Issue. With enough support in the form of more letters, the Notre Dame ad­ministration will take action to correct this hazardous condition.

Green leads Phoenix golf by one stroke 
As!ociated Press 
PHOENIX PGA champion Hubert Green birdied his last hole for an 8-under-par 63 and a one­stroke lead in the first round yester· day of the $500,000 Phoenix Open Golf Tournament. 
"A fun round of golf," said the 39· year-old veteran, who scored his 19th career victory in the 1985 PGA national championship. "I'm close to doing it the way I want to." 
Green scattered nine birdies across his card, including a 20-footer on his last hole at the Phoenix Country Club that gave him sole possession of the top spot. 
A single stroke back at 64 was a starry group made up of the defend· ing title-holder, Calvin Peete, former PGA champ Hal Sutton, the white­haired Australian Greg Norman and Larry Mize. 
Norman, the massive hitter who has come to be known as the "Great White Shark," inadvertently violated a standard of golf etiquette when he drove the green on a par-4 hole, hit­ting into a crouched jack Nicklaus. 
Nicklaus was hunkered over a birdie putt when Norman's drive trickled across the green on the 320­yard hole.

McMahon's alleged rude remarks create huge uproar in New Orleans 


Allsoclated PreM 
NEW ORLEANS· Having already argued with his own team over acupuncture, played Pied Piper on Bourbon Street and mooned a 

 helicopter, Jim McMahon found himself in trouble yesterday for something he didn't do · insult New Orleans women. For once, at least, he apparently was an innocent victim. In a fitting coda to the sideshow week before Sunday's Super Bowl between the Chicago Bears and New England Patriots, McMahon, the ir· reverent Chicago quarterback, was the subject of a broadcast report · later retracted · quoting him as cal· ling New Orleans women "sluts." 
But the retraction didn't halt an anti· Me Mahon demonstration outside the Bears' hotel, bomb 'threats to his hotel switchboard, and some threatening calls that got through to McMahon's room. 
Had it been the only incident in· volving McMahon, it would have been sensation enough in Super Bowl week, which is normally no more than a series of staged media events. 
But it came following three days in which McMahon, whose rebel­lious personality had already made him a lightning rod for attention: 
· upbraided his team's manage­ment for refusing to allow an acupuncturist to fly here to treat his bruised buttocks. The Bears relented, the acupuncturist flew in Wednesday, and McMahon said yes­terday he felt 100 percent better after three treatments. 
· mooned a helicopter flying over the team's practice field in suburban Metairie. "I just wanted to show them where it hurts," he said. 
· got into an altercation with a photographer who tried to snap his picture at a restaurant. "When I'm on my own time, I don't want people shoving cameras in my face," he said. 
· led an impromptu parade Wed­nesday night down Bourbon Street in the city's famed French Quarter as he headed back to meet an 11:30 
· p.m. curfew. 
"You people may think I'm crazy," he said at one point. "I think I'm nor· mal because I don't give a damn." 
The latest incident was set off at the end of the 10 p.m. newscast Wednesday on WDSU-TV, the NBC

affiliate here, by the station's sportscaster, Buddy Diliberto. 
"Jim McMahon app~ently, on a radio interview with WLS, the Chicago radio station, really ripped New Orleans," Diliberto said. "He ripped the people, he ripped the ladies, he ripped a lot of things. 
"Basically, I understand, he said most of the ladles he ran into were sluts. He said most of the people he ran into were stupid. And things like that. And they said he really took off." 
Yesterday, McMahon denied saying that; WLS said it had not Inter­viewed McMahon this week, and both Diliberto and Bob McRaney, the station's vice president and 
general  manager,  publicly  
apologized.  
"I  sincerely  apologize  for  the  

problems caused by these un­verified statements," Diliberto said on the air. "I wishJim McMahon and the Bears well in the Super Bowl Sunday and hope the remainder of the week is devoted to preparations for the game without distractions caused by my comments last night." 
Meanwhile, two dozen women, surrounded by roughly four times as many reporters, picketed outside the Hilton Hotel, where the Bears were staying. One woman, who identified herself as Yetta Bolotte, carried a sign that said, "Only a true Patriot would recognize a New Or­leans lady." 
"I'm hearing now that he didn't say it and It's all a big rumor," Bolotte said. "Ifhe did say It, yes, I'm angry and he ought to get down on his knees and apologize." 
That wasn't aiL 
McMahon, who was partying in Pat O'Brien's bar just off Bourbon Street at the time of Dilberto's broadcast, said he heard about It when he woke up In the morning. He also said he had received several abusive phone calls in his room. 
"There was a message from a lady saying, 'Who in the hell do you think you are calling the women In New Orleans sluts?"' McMahon said. 
New Orleans pollee, meanwhile, said the switchboard at the hotel received three calls threatening McMahon's life and one bomb threat. The hotel wasn't evacuated and no bomb was found, but police spokesman John Marie said security had been increased around the Bears in general and MeMahon in particular. 
Wilson hopes for barks 
~dPreu 
NEW ORLEANS · "No, no, It's not an 'Arf or a 'Woof,' It's more like a 'Whaaarf,' "said linebacker Otis Wil· son of the Chicago Bears. 
"Whaaarf' Is what Wilson hopes to hear Sunday when the Bears take on the New England Patriots. 
"I hope everybody will be doing It Sunday," Wilson said. "The players, the fans, everybody. We're like a bunch ofjunkyard dogs. It's fun." 
The barking began in Dallas at midseason when the Bears walloped the Cowboys 44-0. 
"Me and Dave Duerson started It," Wilson said. "They (the Cowboys) started dogging It so we started barking at them. Pretty soon everybody was barking. Then when we got home the following week for the Atlanta game, the fans got Into the act." 
Wilson will hear more than barking dogs If he and the heavily­favored Chicago Bears lose on Sun· day. 
Does Wilson plan on kickingsome ofhis teammates if they don't join In on the barking? 
"Heck, no, they might kick me back."

New England Patriots quarterback Tony Eason 
tosses around a ball In a practice session /ate last 
week. Eason and his teammates will try to upset the 
Eason merely wants to do his job Sunday 
AMoclated Press 
NEW ORLEANS -Tony Eason 
doesn't wear flippant headbands or 
movie-star dark glasses. He doesn't 
make waves by flying in an 
acupuncturist to treat a painful pos­
terior over his club's protests. 
And he doesn't make headlines. 
Reporters flock to Chicago Bears' 
quarterback Jim McMahon for out­
rageous remarks. They are frustrated 
by New England Patriots quarter­
back Tony Eason, who speaks 
politely but in a low voice. 
"Despite his quiet nature, Tony's got leadership qualities," said Patriots' quarterback coach Les Steckel. "People like him because of his personality." 
The focus in the buildup to the Super Bowl has been on the uncon­ventional McMahon. But when the Bears and Patriots meet in Sunday's NFL championship game, the other quarterback will have a lot to say about the outcome. 
Typically, Eason rejects the idea that he has the burden to carry his team. 
"I'm not looking at it that I have to be the guy anymore than anyone else," he said. 
If the Patriots win and Eason is "the guy," he likely would find him­self in another uncomfortable situa­tion, answering questions in front of hundreds of reporters. 
"Do I have to?" Eason said when asked to speak from a platform into a microphone after the Patriots' AFC championship vicrory over the Miami DolphinsJan. 12. 
A native of California, Eason does little to dispel that state's laid-back image. 
Reporters covering Eason rarely have to delete expletives as they do when quoting McMahon. · 
Even their hairstyles reveal the difference. McMahon's short­cropped, punk-styled cut drew notices when it first appeared. Eason frequently has the casual, tousled look ofsomeone who has just gotten out ofbed. 
On Sunday, the hair will be covered by helmets, the attention will be on whichever quarterback's team has the ball, and the per­sonality differences will be secon­dary to how they play football. 
Eason is doing that better than he did early in the season, when the Patriots struggled with a new of­fense. 
And he has done it, as he has behaved here, without frills. In three playoff victories he has completed 29 of 42 passes for five touchdowns and no interceptions. He has thrown conservatively, yet precisely. 
"He is an extremely dedicated football man who puts a lot of thought into it," New England coach Raymond Berry said of Eason. 
Eason is seemingly unaffected by Super Bowl hype and hoopla. He said he doesn't feel pressure stem­ming from the importance of the 
game. 
"Why should I?" Eason said. "If I don't want to think about it, I don't think about it." 
He doesn't spend much time eit­her thinking about the club's cur­few. 
"I'm not here to see how late I can stay out," he said. "We're here to get a job done."

Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Tito Santana, Ricky Steamboat, Pedro Morales and the "Macho Man," Randy Savage, will highlight a six-match card as the World Wrestling Federation returns to the ACC tomorrow night for its premiere engagement of 1986. 
The main event will be Santana's title defense against Savage in a match that promises an unusual mix of beauty and brutality. The beauty will be in the person of the Macho Man's stunning manager Elizabeth, who has delighted, and distracted, wrestling fans in recent months. 
Savage himself wiU provide the brutality, as he attempts to wrest the championship belt from Santana with a style that leaves no respect for the rules or the referee. 
In other matches, Steamboat will square off against his bitter rival Don "The Magnificent" Muraco. Morales will tackle Tiger Chung Lee, and Big John Studd will be matched against Tony Atlas. Rounding out the card, 
S.D. Jones will face WWF newcomer Hercules Hernandez and the poet laureate of wrestling, Leaping Lanny Poffo, will take on the cagey veteran, Rene Goulet. 
Tickets for this exciting card arc on sale at the Gate I 0 box office of the ACC for S12 and S9. All the ac­tion begins at 8 p.m.

Durso contributes a great amount to Irish wrestling team as freshman 
By RICK RIETBROCK honors, and his victory total ranks one thing he has to improve, 
however, it is getting away from his opponent." The 134-pounder says that with time, that area will improve. 
"I think that I need to improve my strength a bit," Durso says. "Experience will definitely help me a lot as well." 
Durso is not ready to relax, despite his impressive showing thus far. He has some dreams that he hopes to attain somewhere down the road. 
"This year, I definitely want to go to Nationals," he says. "My main goal when I came here, though, was to be an NCAA champ someday." 

At the present time, Jerry and his teammates are preparing to com­pete in the National Catholic Tournament in Cleveland, Ohio this weekend. 
"Coach McCann really wants this tourney," Durso adds. "It will be tough, but we are confident we can win." 
McCann says that the host team, John Carrol, will be gunning for the Irish. 
"Their coach realizes that we have a young team and they probably think it is their last shot at us for a while," the coach explains. "However, ifwe continue to wrestle well, as we have been lately, we definitely can win this weekend."

test for us Sunday. They're a Final Four team, if not a national cham­pionship team. We'll see how good we are. I just hope they don't beat us by40." 
Most Notre Dame fans will remember Smith as the Tar Heel player whose dunk with three seconds left gave North Carolina its win over the Irish last year. That game still stands as a sore spot for Notre Dame. 
"If last year's game film doesn't motivate our players, then they shouldn't get on the bus Saturday morning to go to Chicago. That's what itcomes down to," Phelps says. 
This will be another tough weekend of basketball for the Tar Heels. For the second consecutive weekend, they will play games on both Saturday and Sunday. 
Last weekend, North Carolina beat No. 2 Duke, 95-92, on Saturday and then flew to Milwaukee for a come-from-behind 66-64 win over Marquette on Sunday. With Georgia Tech on Saturday and Notre Dame on Sunday this weekend, both at home, the Heels run into a similar situation. 
Many people would think that North Carolina coach Dean Smith was crazy when making such a gruel­ing schedule, but Phelps says ot­herwise, adding that the Heels' game with Georgia Tech will have no ef­fect on Sunday's contest. 
"Dean has made his schedule this year knowing that he has a very talented team. It will be good preparation for March, when you have games so close to each other 
Phelps says that his team cannot afford to relax, even if it should get out to a sizeable lead because Carolina can pull itself even very quickly. 
"They never lose their poise and they always play hard," says the Irish coach. "They do a great job of playing from behind, so you better not relax even if you get up 1 0 points because their pressure defense will get them right back in 
it." 
The key in this game, though, will be how well Notre Dame can shut down the awesome Carolina of­fense, and Phelps leaves no doubt that the Irish will be prepared to do just that. 
"We'll be ready by Sunday," he pronounces. "Trust me." 
IRISH ITEMS-Gary Voce, ham­pered recently by back spasms, remains questionable for the game. A· more complete decision on his status will be made today. In addition to the win over Virginia, past Notre Dame victories over No. 1 under Phelps are: 67-61 over Ken­tucky on Dec. 27, 1980 at Freedom Hall in Louisville; 76-7 4 over DePaul on Feb. 27, 1980; 65-59 over Mar­quette on Feb. 25, 1978; 93-82 over San Francisco on March 1, 1977; and 71-70 over UCLA on Jan. 19, 1974, to end the 88-game winning streak ofthe Bruins. North Carolina holds a 10-2 lead in the series bet­ween the two teams. This is Notre Dame's first visit to Chapel Hill with the Heels scheduled to play a return game at the ACC next January. For anyone who wants to meet the team when it arrives back in South Bend, the team bus should hit campus sometime around 11:15 p.m. on Sunday. 
Sports Writer 
When Jerry Durso came to Notre Dame, he was part ofthe fourth-best recruiting class in the nation, ac­cording to Amateur Wrestling News. Durso hopes that he and his clas­smates can propel the Irish to wres­tling notoriety in the future. 
"When my class graduates, I want Notre Dame to be ranked consis­tently," the freshman says. 
"I hope to gain a reputation for this school so that after I graduate and the team continues to do well, I will know that I was a part in build­ing the program." 
Durso has good reason for this type of optimism. The Irish are cur­rently 5-2 in dual matches, and the West Millington, N.J. native sports a sparkling 25-6 record. 
This immediate success even has Head Coach Fran McCann a bit surprised. 
"Coming into the season, I knew he was good, but not this good," McCann says. "He has placed in just about every tournament we've en­tered. He is just dominating his op­ponents." 
Domination could also be used to describe Durso's high school career. While earning four letters at Ridge High School, he posted a 113-10 record, including 60 pins. These statistics earned him all-America

management. "I was concerned mainly with improving with every match. I came in with a good class, which provides excellent competi­tion in practice." 
McCann says the work in practice has been a major factor in Durso's success.

Saint Mary's swim team co­captains Anne Cushing and Joyce Murtagh do double duty for the Belles at team meets. When they aren't competing in an event, the two are backing the other swimmers at poolside. Cushing provides sup­port simply by remaining calm, while Murtagh encourages her teammates by cheering them on in the water. 
Cushing, a long distance swimmer from LaGrange, lll., specializes in the 500, 1000 and 1650-yard freestyle events. Murtagh, from Toledo, Ohio, is a sprinter and middle distance swimmer who competes in the 50, 100 and 200-yard freestyle events. 
The combination ofthe two as co­captains is a definite asset for the Belles. 
"Anne and Joyce are great team captains," says swimmer Meghan Rafferty, a . sophomore. "They're motivators, and they're really ded­icated to the team." 
Perhaps Cushing and Murtagh best motivate the team by their ex­amples of self-discipline. Each is

Cushing, who has been swimming on the collegiate level for four years, believes the sport is an activity which allows her to enhance her college experience. 
"Swimming's a new dimension to school. It's a release for me, and it's also a way to meet people," she says. 
Murtagh, who is currently in her third season of swimming and was named all-American the last two seasons by advancing to the finals at Nationals, agrees. 
"Swimming adds something to school. It also helps me discipline myself," she says. 
In spite of their busy schedules, Cushing and Murtagh find time to participate in another area of Saint Mary's athletjcs. 
Cushing is president of the Ath­letic Council, and Murtagh is a representative to the council. 
Belles' swim coach Nancy Jo Kuz­mitz. "Anne is concentrating on the 500 free, and Joyce is working towards the 200 free. Joyce has dropped her time in the last two meets." 
Both swimmers attended Nation­als last season. Cushing entered the 400-yard freestyle relay event, while Murtagh swam in the 200, 400 and 800-yard freestyle relays. · 
According to Kuzmitz, the co­captains possess true leadership qualities. 
"Anne and Joyce are hard workers. Both of them are really committed to the team," she says. 
The two swimmers are leaders in the classsroom, as well. Both were named academic all-Americans last season, an honor they received not only by qualifying for Nationals but 
· also by maintaining a specific grade point average.

Rivers and Irish looking forward to big chance 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -One could almost sense the im­pending celebration by the Notre Dame basketball team. The Irish were about to beat North Carolina in the second round ofthe 1985 NCAA Tournament. 

The ball was in the hands of David Rivers as the final seconds ticked off the clock with the score tied at 58. Rivers, the architect of so many other storybook endings during the season, surely would write another this time around. The worst that could happen was that the Irish would have to go to overtime. 
Or so it all seemed. 
in one fleeting moment, the ball somehow glanced off Rivers' leg and into the hands of North Carolina's Curtis Hunter. Hunter fed Kenny Smith and Smith raced to the other end of the court for a dunk which gave the Heels the win. 
Somehow, some way, the story ofCinderella had turned into the Amityville Horror. 
Nary a spectator in the ACC could believe what he had witnessed. Rivers, the sure-handed one all season, had made the crucial turnover instead of the crucial basket 
It has been over 10 months since that game, but the memory ofhis turnover lingers with Rivers, who had never expP.rienced anything like it in his career. 
"It comes to mind every time I hear the words North 
Carolina. That's only natural. But maybe that will help me 
to have a better game this time around," Rivers muses as he

prepares for another go at the Tar Heels on Sunday. 
Rivers also will get another chance to face the talented Smith, rated the nation's top point guard by some experts. "I look forward to playing against Kenny Smith," Rivers says. "It's a challenge. He's one ofthe best point guards, and I feel that I'm one ofthe best, too." 
North Carolina will be either 20-0 or 19-1, depending on the result of its game with Georgia Tech Saturday, when the Irish face the Heels. Let there be no doubt, the Irish would like to see Carolina unbeaten when the ball goes into the air on Sunday. 
"I want them to be No. 1 and unbeaten. That way if we beat them there will be no excuses," Rivers says. "They're going to be vulnerable, especially ifthey haven't lost yet." 
Either way, expect Rivers to have one of his best games ever. The way his career has gone so far, you almost have to expect it. 
 
For those of you who care, here are my picks for this eventful sports weekend. First, North Carolina will beat 
Georgia Tech here on Saturday to set up a classic Irish-Tar Heel showdown on Sunday. 
Notre Dame then will shutdown the potent Carolina of­fense in that game, holding the Heels' leading scorer Brad Daugherty under double figures. And, while it will be dif­ficult, the Irish will break the vaunted Carolina press the way they've broken so many other presses this season. 
To go out on a limb, the Irish will win this one going away to pull off a classic upset in front ofa national televi­sion audience. 
But, hey, let's not forget about the Super Bowl (although _ that would be pretty hard with all the hype we have to put ~w~} ­
To go out on yet another limb, and probably a much weaker one at that, I'm going to go with the Patriots. Some have said that the Bears are a dynasty and a team ofdestiny, but I'm sticking with the Pats. 
No one gave them a chance against the Raiders and yet they won. Then people gave them less of a chance against Miami and again they won. This time many peoJ!!e are giving them virtually no chance at all, and again they will overcome the odds and win. 
Hopefully, New llngland will win Sunday. It will be eit­her me or all those obnoxious Bears fans with egg on our face Monday.
