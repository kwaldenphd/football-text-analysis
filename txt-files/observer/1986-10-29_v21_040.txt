Biased campaigning hurts voters 
How high would you rate on the Biblical scoreboard? 
I received a large, white election pamphlet in the mail while home on break. It claimed to give impartial information on election candi­dates. 
But this "unbiased" brochure included per­centages from the Biblical Scoreboard. No in­formation was given about the exact nature of the scoreboard; references to it just dropped into the pamphlet out of the sky. 
Only extreme scores were used, of course, and as one would guess, conservatives scored above 80 percent while most of the "lefties" had batting averages in the .200 range. 
In general, campaigns across the country this year have sunken to new lows as political ad­vertisements have ruthlessly attacked candi­dates. 
Columnist Tom Wicker wrote in an Oct. 28 commentary that"... this is the year of nega­tive campaigning -the art of describing the opponent as a liar, a louse, an enemy of the people, who's soft on crime, drugs, family values, national defense and communism." 
The expanded role of political action commit­tees, (PAC's), seems to be one reason for the increased negative campaigning. Candidates are able to smile and kiss babies while PAC's do their dirty work for them. 
In the past, PAC's were most noticeable for their work on broad issues such as the environ­ment. But now PAC's are springing up just to harass a candidate on a particular issue which may not even exist. 
Ohio newspapers have been running an ad titled "Why Homosexuals are Supporting (Ohio Governor Richard) Celeste." 
Such ads are being submitted by the Ohio Citizens for Decency and Health. The group was previously unknown to most Ohioans. 
It is hard to determine just who is running such a group because all statements are made in the name of the group, not in the name of a particular person. 
Celeste's opponent, former Governor James Rhodes, claims no knowledge of the ad. However, one Ohio church pastor said he received literature from Rhodes' campaign and from OCDH both of which bore address labels identical down to the misspelling of his address. 
Besides the vagueness of the group's spon­sorship, the issue is rather vague itself. It seems that no one even knew there was such an issue until the OCDH brought it up, but, nonetheless, Rhodes has gotten plenty of free mileage out of the "homo issue," as he has been heard to call it. 
Such publicity provided by groups outside of a candidate's official campaign allows the can­didate to deny involvement in the mudslinging but wink silently to those who support the po­sition supported by the PAC. 
While at home, I also received a flyer that displayed a 6x9 inch picture of a candidate with

his back to the camera. The mayor "has turned his back on you," said the caption in two-inch red letters. The return address on the flyer was of the National Republican Congressional Com­mittee, so the mayor's opponent could claim not to have any responsibility for the ad. 
I much prefer strictly partisan literature be­cause I at least know from where the authors are coming. With a flyer that says "Vote for these democrats" the intentions of the authors are obvious. Qitto with a letterhead that fea­tures a red, white, and blue elephant and with a letter signed by Ronald Reagan addressed "Dear Summit County voter" (at least they spelled my name right). 
The large, white pamphlet that quoted per­centages from the Biblical Scoreboard in­trigued me most. 
Who runs the scoreboard? Moses? The Great Scorekeeper in the Sky himself? Can candidates play it safe and get three points for a moment of silence vote, or go for a touchdown with a vote for mandated school prayer? 
The serious concern I have about the large white pamphlet is that it pretends to be un­biased when in fact it is not. Not only can't I hold a particular person responsible for the pamphlet, I also can't be sure at first whose "side" it is on. 
If I am told that the mayor is turning his back on me and the governor caters to homosexuals, at least the flyer is not pretending to be un­biased. 
It was kind of reasurring to get a flyer, sent all the way here from Ohio, that showed a smiling candidate sitting with his family and saying nothing bad about his opponent. He even signed the letter by hand and crossed out "Dear Voter" at the top and replaced it with "Pear JS" -he almost got my initials right.

Christmas Bazaar proceeds to benefit spina bifida 
By KAREN WEBB News Staff 
The Saint Mary's Pro­gramming Board decided to donate the profits from stu­dent government's partici­pation in December's Saint Mary's Christmas Bazaar to the Spina Bifida Association at Tuesday night's program­ming board meeting. 
The Spina Bifida Associa­tion had originally hoped to raise money at Saint Mary's by sponsoring a bowl-a-thon, according to Lisa Lawler, Traditional Events Commis­sioner. 
Lawler said, however, ''There has been little or no interest in this weekend's bowl-a-thon." 
Because of the anticipated low level of participation, Lawler said student govern­ment will make the donation to the Spina Bifida Associa­tion. 
In other business, Sara Cook, vice president for stu­dent affairs, reminded the board that a "One Woman Comedy and Horror Show" entitled "Everything You Ever Wanted to Ask About Nukes but Were Afraid to Know" will be held tonight at 8 in the Chameleon Room at Haggar College Center, Saint Mary's. 
Also, Cook announced that Brian Huskey will give a performance of music and comedy November 10 in the Chameleon room. Cook en­couraged all students to at­tend the show. 
Georgeana Rosenbush, faculty advisor to the Board, said "(Brian) is funny, he sings anything you want to hear and he loves Saint Mary's."

Institute says cancer deaths may be halved by year 2000 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Na­tional Cancer Institute said Tuesday that the aggressive use of existing knowledge could cut the annual cancer death rate in half by the year 2000. 
The institute released a plan, combining cancer prevention, screening, early detection and treatment, that it said could produce dramatic results by the turn of the century if it were adopted as a national goal. 
"Knowledge gained over the years can be used to control a significant portion of the dis­ease which was responsible for an estimated 462,000 deaths in 1985," said Dr. Vincent DeVita, director of the institute. 
Detailed in a new report en­titled "Cancer Control Objec­tives for theN ation: 1985-2000," the plan calls for stepped-up ef­forts against cigarette smoking and poor diet and earlier use of the latest diagnostic and treatment techniques. 
"The report on cancer con­trol objectives is important be­cause it represents a compre­hensive plan of action," DeVita said. 
The strategy, developed to meet national disease preven­tion objectives established by the Department of Health and Human Services, would re­quire cooperation from the public, industry, health profes­sions, news media and govern­ment to succeed, he continued. 
Among other things, it calls for industry to increase health promotion in the workplace, the news media to better spread information about can­cer prevention and control, vo­luntary organizations to offer more health education and screening programs at the local level and health profes­sional groups to reemphasize cancer control in training pro­grams. 

The national mortality rate from cancer in 1980, based on the latest available data, was 183 deaths per 100,000 persons annually. This figure could be cut by as much as 50 percent in 15 years by using the preven­tion and treatment knowledge already available, NCI offi­cials said.

Dr. Edward Sondik, an NCI official who helped analyze and edit the report, said in an in­terview that there is no esti­mate of how much the ex­panded anticancer effort would cost. 
"We have not done a detailed budget on what this would cost, but once one understands what can be done, then they can de­termine how to do it," Sondik said. 
"The thing that we are ad­dressing with this report is that you can do something about cancer now without waiting for some research breakthroughs," he continued.

Following Willis' discussion, Cahill announced the res­cheduling of HPC committee meetings with John Goldrick, associate vice president for residence life, for Nov. 3. Howard Hall President Jim Bradford suggested discussing with Goldrick the new enforce­ment of "no paper" SYR decorations in hallways. 
Cahill said such meetings with Goldrick were scheduled "Research is important and we stress that. The projections we have on reducing cancer death rely to a great extent on the products of past and future re­search. 
"But we think there has been a sense that cancer is a prob­lem we can't get a hold of, that we as individuals can't do much about it," he said, "and that just isn't true." 
Sondik noted that 30 percent of cancer deaths are due di­rectly to smoking, but that the public doesn't fully understand how much can be gained just by stopping this practice. 
earlier in the year to clarify "a lot of rumors going around campus." According to Cahill, through these meetings, policies have been made clear and the HPC committees wishes to continue these ses­sions with Goldrick. 
In other business, Mahir Mouasher from OMBUD an­nounced that campus phone books are in and can be picked up by hall presidents on Thursday from 6 to 7 p.m. in La Fortune. He said off­campus students will receive their phone books after dorm representatives have picked up their halls' books. 




Gay activists use currency as a demonstration of power 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -If money is power, gay activists reason, then money that passes through the homosexual com­munity and is marked accord­ingly may translate into gay power. 
For the last few months, city homosexuals have been circu­lating greenbacks stamped in 
red  with  "gay  $"  as  a  
demonstration  of  their  
strength.  

Activists estimate millions of dollars have been stamped so far, and say the movement is spreading to other large cities. Federal officials say the bills are likely being re-circulated to other Midwestern states as well. 
The campaign was sparked by the July failure of a proposed city ordinance to guarantee equal rights for homosexuals, said Frank Kellas, owner of a bar in the posh Gold Coast area 
who helped launch the cam­paign. "What buys rights but dol­lars?" asked Kellas. 
"All we're asking for is equal protection under the law and not to be beaten up because we're gay--or fired," said the Rev. Ninure Saunders, co­chairman of the Illinois Gay and Lesbian Task Force. 
"To judge by what I've seen, it's given a little more kick in the pride of gay and lesbian people," Ms. Saunders said. 
The protest has broadened its aims since the ordinance's defeat. 
For one thing, Kellas said the marked bills are helping dispel ''the myth of catching AIDS through (casual) contact." 
By showing how many dol­lars are touched by homosexuals, heterosexuals may learn that acquired im­mune deficiency syndrome cannot be spread by casual con­tact, he said.

Airplane damaged by deer 
Associated Press 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -Emer­gency crews at two airports were on standby, but a small plane that was damaged when it hit a deer on takeoff landed safely in Louisville, airport of­ficials said. 
The private Cessna 650 landed without difficulty at 
9:01 a.m. Tuesday, said John Scharfenberger, spokesman at Standiford Field. 
The plane, owned by Hil­lenbrand Industries, had taken off at 7 a.m. from a private airstrip near Batesville, Ind., where it struck a deer. 
The company said there were seven people aboard, including two corporate pilots, and none was injured. 
The pilot circled Greater Cin­cinnati International Airport for more than an hour for safety reasons before electing to land in Louisville because there was less fog. 
"He didn't want to land with a heavy load of fuel in case something happened," said San Juan Romero, air traffic manager at the Greater Cincin­nati airport. 
Visibility at the Greater Cin­cinnati airport was one-half mile, said Hank Merrick, assis­tant air traffic manager. The visibility in Louisville was three miles. 
"The runway visual range went down on the approach to the runway he was going to use and the weather was better down at Louisville, and he elected to go down there," Mer­rick said. 
"He wasn't too sure about his left wheel. ... He made one pass down here and it didn't appear to be in place. The left wheel was not normal." 
Both airports had emergency crews on standby. Scharfenberger said the pilot did not request foam on the run­way to reduce friction at lan­ding. 
R.C. Smith, Hillenbrand vice president, declined to release the names of the plane's oc­cupants, but a flight list identi­fied the pilot as Mike Cooken­dorfer. Smith said other flight arrangements were made to take the passengers to Florida. The Cessna had been bound for Orlando. 


Correction 
Executive Coordinator Michael Jaeger was misquoted in the Student Senate meeting story in Tuesday's Observer. In ref­erence to senators' comments last year follow­ing a student vote on divest­ment, Jaeger said "the indi­cation (in the opinion of those senators) appeared to be that the student body had become generally apathetic toward the issue of divest­ment." He added, "Many of the senators felt that the po­sition of the administration was most knowledgeable and proper," and that "they had a good grip on the situa­tion."

stitute of Physics of the Earth in Moscow, are scheduled to ar­rive in the United States on Nov. 9. 
Because of conditions placed on their visit by the Reagan ad­ministration, they will not be able to visit the proposed mon­itoring sites in Nevada and Cal­ifornia, each about 70 miles from the Nevada test site where U.S. nuclear weapons tests are conducted, Cochran said. 
The conditions were that the Soviets witness a nuclear test and a demonstration of a sys­tem called CORRTEX, de­signed to allow the monitoring of nuclear explosions. 
The reason, Cochran said, is that the Reagan administra­tion iavors a limited test-ban treaty overseen by CORRTEX, while the Soviets favor a com­
prehensive test-ban treaty. 
The Soviets declined to agree, and so they will not visit the proposed monitoring sites in Railroad Valley and Nelson, Nev., and Deep Springs, Calif. 
"The Soviet position with respect to this is that this is the wrong cast of characters," Cochran said. "They are seis­mologists. They are not familiar with CORRTEX." The administration "might as well have invited the Kirov Ballet to witness an explosion. 
State Department spokes­man Charles Redman said at a briefing Tuesday that the Soviets would have been per­mitted to visit the sites if they had agreed to come in an offi­cial capacity as representa­tives of the Soviet government.

CHICAGO 
Between a fern bar and a hard place 
JOE BUCOLO Senior staff reporter 
As one walks around campus during these last few days of good weather, one sees many types of emblems on shirts and jackets. Think, for a moment, and decide which institution (beside Notre Dame) is represented the most. The ob­vious answer is the Hard Rock Cafe. 
Ever since the first Hard Rock opened in London on June 14, 1971, the restaurants have be­come some of the most popular in the world. People travel long distances just to eat in these en­tertaining places. 
Years ago, Peter Morton and Isaac Tigrett formed a partner­ship and opened the world's first Hard Rock Cafe in London. It was a place place full of rock 'n' roll and movie memorabilia, and the waiters and waitresses dressed in old-fashioned outfits. The novelty of the restaurant earned it instant success. 
Shortlyafter the first Hard Rock opened, the partnership be­tween Morton and Tigrett dis­solved; however, the success of the Hard Rock lived on. Each ex­partner recognized the potential of the restaurants and began to open more cafes on his own. 
Today, the Hard Rock Cafe's symbol is a world-wide favorite. Morton's restaurants include those in Los Angeles, San Fran­cisco and Chicago. Tigrett owns cafes in New York, London and Stockholm to name a few. 
The newest Hard Rock Cafe is in Chicago. The restaurant itself is one of the larger ones and con­tains hundreds of interesting ar­tifacts. The cafe opened on June 27, 1986 and has been a success from the start. The cafe provides all sorts of food from hamburgers to health shakes. Chicago's Hard Rock is a fun place to eat as well as work. Rob Goldberg, an employee of Chicago's Hard Rock, says that the cafe is popular because it of­fers "good food at a cheap price, great atmosphere, and interest­ing rock memorabilia." 
Memorabilia is what makes the Hard Rock so much fun. The res­taurant in Chicago, for example, has Phil Collins' drum, George Michael's jacket, Boy George's cape, Harrison Ford's Indiana Jonesjacket, and many other in­teresting pop artifacts. There's even an old "National Enquirer" from the days of Elvis. The Hard Rock acquires these items in three different ways: some are rented from various record com­
"Some people visit the Hard Rock Cafes for the sole purpose of purchasing some sort of souvenir. The cafes sell buttons, sweatshirts, towels, caps, jackets and many other things that the public loves to buy." 
panies, others are purchased and others are donated. 
Some people visit the Hard Rock Cafes for the sole purpose of purchasing some sort of souvenir. The cafes sell buttons, sweatshirts, towels, caps, jack­ets, and many other things that the public loves to buy. People spend hundreds of dollars every day on these items alone. This is evident even on Notre Dame's campus. 
Many people are concerned about the alcohol policies of the Hard Rock Cafe. The policies vary from location to location, espe­cially in Europe where there is no drinking age. In Chicago, the Hard Rock has a good system. Those under the age of 21 must be in before 8 p.m. This helps to prevent the possibility of a minor getting alcohol, yet allows people of all ages to enJOY what Hard Rock has to offer. Those who are over 2 I are often carded simply for protection. 
The Hard Rock Cafes also offer a great variety of special events. 
Many Chicago radio stations broadcast from the Chicago Hard Rock and sponsor special pro­motions. These events attract a lot of attention and people, from which both the restaurant and the radio station profit. 
It is interesting to see what type of people visit the Hard 
Rock.  Young people and  teen­ 
agers  are  obviously  attracted.  
They  are  constantly  at  the  

Chicago cafe. Lunch time however, is a different story. During lunch hours, Chicago's Hard Rock is full of businessmen and senior citizens. These older people really enjoy the Hard Rock and their attendance proves that most people are young at heart. 
The future of Hard Rock is bright. On Nov. 7, Morton will open a cafe in Houston. He is also planning to open restau­rants in Honolulu and Australia. Tigrett is opening a cafe in Dal­las. 
The Hard Rock Cafes are fun places to see and at which to eat. They provide hundreds of inter­esting items from the past and present. The food is excellent, too. If you have the chance, visit one and see what the world is talking about. 

The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming! 
"Prices must become an active factor ofeconomic and social policy. We shall have to carry out a planned reacljustment of the price system as an integral whole. Prices must be made more flexible; price levels must be linked up not only with the outlays but also with the consumer properties of the goods, their effectiveness and the degree to which products meet the needs of society and consumer demand. " 
Mikhail Oorbachev Political Report to the 27th Party Congress 
One of the first things that struck me in Moscow was the immense amount ofcontruction going on. Thirty-story cranes are almost as much a part of the skyline as are 25-story buildings. According to our tour guide, the average Soviet upgrades his home once every five years. Perhaps this statistic is overinflated, but I could believe it after seeing the level of building in Moscow. 
We waited in line for bread once -no, it didn't take hours. We waited maybe five minutes and bought some quite filling bread rings for six kopeks. That's a dime at official exchange rates and maybe two cents at black market rates. Granted, the average Soviet makes about $8,000 a year, but his rent on a flat is $30 a month. All in all, their standard of living is about half that of Great Britain -about one quarter of ours. 

Mark McLaughlin 
This is apparently a substantial improvement over the postwar period. According to Soviet figures, suspect as they may be, real per capita income has increased 160 percent over the past 25 years. 
Russia is not a rich nation, but neither is it poor. Much has been made of the increasing capitalist tendencies of China ­the intensive modernization, incentive programs, and entry of foreign companies into the vast Chinese market. What many do not realize (at least I had no idea) is that a similar process is going on in the Soviet Union. Quickly. 
The Political Report by Gorbachev, basically a state of the Union address to the Communist Party, is quite an informative little book. After one wades through all of the condemnation of the imperialist powers and the flag-waving and starts to read Gorbachev's concrete proposals, they sound remarkably un-Communist. He promotes self-criticism by Soviet society. He wishes to link price to quality of goods to promote hard work. 
Sounds familiar, doesn't it? 

IfGorbachev succeeds in implementing these policies (and there is little doubt that he will), we may all be in for a big surprise. The one complaint that we heard from the Soviet people was that there was no reason to work hard. Now there will be. 
When one thinks about it, these people have done remarkably well considering the resources that they have. Moscow is only slightly farther south than Juneau, Alaska; the southernmost point of the Soviet Union is about parallel with Cincinnati. Their growing season is short and their food supply limited. They have vast amounts of land but not much else. Yet they build like crazy and feed almost 300,000,000 people with a crippled non-incentive economy. 
If they ever get their economy in gear, the Soviets could become a force to be reckoned with economically as well as politically. Are we up for that kind of challenge? 
Even now the Soviets are pulling ahead in areas where the United States was once supreme. In the most obvious field, weapons, they are certainly even with us where 10 years ago they were not. In technological fields like laser and particle beam research, they are I 0 to I 5 years ahead of us. Similarly, In space they are beating us with antisatelite systems, a manned space station, and a massive rocket booster program which are all in working order while we do nothing. A space shuttle, technology thought of as American, has been developed and is being tested by Soviet scientists. Even their ice cream can compete with America's best. 
Japan has already proven that the U.S. economy is vulner­able, and that American industry can be beaten. Other nations may soon do the same. The European countries are slowly learning to work together economically, as demonstrated by their trade agreements and cooperative ventures like the Ariane space program. China is modernizing at an incredible 
rate. 
And now it looks as ifan increasingly capitalist Soviet Union is about to join the economic frenzy. And, unlike our other competition, they have political might to match. Are we ready? Or are our heads in the sand? Khruschev said "We will bury you.'' While he probably didn't have economics in mind, he might still be right.

Field Hockey faces Valpo rematch 
By MARGOT MACHECA Sports Writer 
After the Notre Dame field hockey team's 0-4 loss to Big Ten power Purdue on Monday, head coach Jill Lindenfeld looks at the rest of the Irish's season with hope and frustra­tion. 
The hope lies in the Irish's strong and consistennt defen­sive play, while the frustration rises because of the team's mounting number of injuries. 
"We played our best game as a team against Purdue, who is second in the Midwest and na­tionally ranked," notes Linden­feld. "Although we did not sus­tain a significant offensive threat, there was accurate passing to the forwards and great defensive play." 
The team's most unen-DiGiacomo would be out for the remainder of the season with a knee injury. 
''Corrine hurt her knee before break and did not travel with us to Boston," said Lin­denfeld. "We are going to have to look to some experienced, younger players to man our front line." 
The forward line had already been thinned out with the loss of co-captain Mary Wagner earlier in the season. 
Despite the recent losses, the team travelled to the East over October break to try and im­prove on its 5-5 season record. 
The Irish returned home with three disappointing losses and one tie, yet with continually im­proving defensive intensity. 
The team began the road trip with an 5-0 defeat at the hands of Lowell College and an 6-0 loss to Bently College. High­
couraging news came a day -1ighting each of the matches after the match when Linden-was the strong performance of feld learned the Irish all-time junior goalie M.J. Beetel. leading scorer Corrine "M .T i" gPtting hetter :md better every game in the net," notes Lindenfeld. Beetel tallied 22 and 32 saves respectively in the first two games. 

Seniors Stephanie Giggetts and Bernadette Suplick each scored a goal on assists by Benet DeBerry in the Irish's 3-2 loss to Holy Cross College. 
"We played our best in the third game of the trip," stated the coach. "Bernadette and Meg McGlinn played well on the offensive side, while Caroline Berezny and Joanne Marshall executed defensive­ly." 
The Irish wound up the trip with a 0-0 tie with Gordon Col­lege before returning home to finish out the season's final three games. 
With continued defensive strength and improving for­wards, Notre Dame travels Valparaiso today in a rematch of an earlier season game. The Irish won that contest by a score of 6-0. 

Penn St. climbs to 2nd in AP poll 
Associated Press 
Penn State Coach Joe Paterno, whose Nittany Lions climbed to No. 2 in The Asso­ciated Press' college football rankings following a surpris­ingly easy 23-3 victory over Al­abama, says his major concern is Saturday's game against West Virginia. 
"I haven't thought about it (the ranking), and I'm not going to think about it," he said. "I think we've got to settle down and get off cloud nine and start thinking about playing a good football game against West Virginia." 
The victory moved unde­feated Penn State up from sixth in the poll and dropped the Crimson Tide from the ranks of the unbeaten in a fall from second to eighth. 
"I really don't know how the team's going to react to it, and I'm not going to ask them." Paterno said. 

Alabama Coach Ray Perkins said it was obvious last Satur­day against Penn State that Alambama is not a great foot­ball team, and that overcoming the defeat will be the real test. 
"Sometimes you learn a lot more about yourself in how you get up off the ground after you've fallen than when things are going good," Perkins said.

Morris proves to be Irish soccer's ultimate team player 
By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
The consummate team player. It's a title that many athletes like to think of them­selves as but one by which few can actually be described. Notre Dame soccer coach Den­nis Grace knows one when he sees one, and he's glad he's got one in Randy Morris. 
"I don't think a player could have a better attitude than Randy," said Grace, in his ward, hoping to implement his

defensive forward who charges well and constantly attacks. The guys look to him to per­form and he does it. We're definitely not the same team without him." 
The team's respect for Mor­ris' ability is complemented by the fact the players are friends off the field. He credits the closeness of the team and Grace's leadership as impor­tant to the team's success. 
"This is by far the closest team I've played on," said Morris. "Things came together last spring when we played in­doors, on a surface that's suited to the type of game I like to play. I played pretty well and I gained a lot of respect from the team. We're always trying to help each other, suggesting things that might work, differ­ent stuff to work on if we get a minute in practice. It's just a good atmosphere. 
"I try not to think of the team's future too much, be­cause I really want to concen­trate on the games we've got left this year. I feel kind of bad for the seniors in that we couldn't have done more this year. We had close losses to In­diana, Michigan State and Ak­ron, games we very easily could have won. That might have taken us a long way towards doing something in the postseason. They (the seniors) are just a great bunch of guys." 
Morris feels that if he is to improve, he needs to expand his role as one of the team's igniters and to capitalize on scoring opportunities He has scored on 5 of his 49 shots on

goal this season. 
"Athletes in all sports," said 
Morris, "come across times 
when they can't score. Some­
times I've been open and I've 
either passed off or hurried a 
shot when I should have scored. 
When you're accustomed to 
passing and setting people up, 
sometimes you don't know 
what to do with the ball when 
you get it. It's something I'm 
sure will take care of itself with 
time and practice." 
Grace understands that Mor­
ris, like the consummate team 
player, doesn't always have to 
score to be effective. 
"The thing is, he keeps im­
proving," said Grace. "I've got 
to think that the future looks 
pretty good with the young tal­
ent we have and guys like 
Randy playing better every ~-, 
year." 
Grace takes his squad and a 
10-6-1 record to Valparaiso to 
face the Crusaders at 3 today. 
Grace is catiously optimistic ·about today's contest. 
"Two years ago they took us 
to overtime," said Grace. 
''Anything can happen but if we 
play our game and play it well, 
we'll be alright."

problem of inexperience. 
"For the time being we are going to stress fundamentals so that the players get used to the same style of hockey. 
"Our goal is to progress weekly. The team is well­condition, hard-working and has a great attitude. If we stick to our present work ethic, we are going to be very competi­tive." 
The new faces on the ice are

Guay, Tim Kuehl, and David

"While a few freshmen like 
Kuehl and Markovitz have 
already been thrust into regu­
lar roles, several more of the younger players are close to that transition," notes Smith, "and by second semester al­most everyone will be ready." 
Smith is going to depend on the leadership of junior centers Mike McNeill and Tom Mooney. 
"McNeill and Mooney are ex­tremely talented young men. They lead by example on the ice as well as by their lifes­tyles," comments Smith. 
Notre Dame was instrumen­tal in forming the new confer­ence to which they belong, the 
American Collegiate Hockey
Association. Besides Notre Dame, membership includes Kent State, Lake Forest and Michigan-Dearborn. The ACHA's constituents share a common philosophy education­ally, athletically and financial­ly. ACHA members will play a home-and-home series each year with each home series in­cluding two games. 
Brian Boulac, an assistant athletic director at Notre Dame, will serve as the league's first commissioner. Among his many other respon­sibilities, he will coordinate the 1987 ACHA Championships to be held March 5-7 at the ACC. 
The Irish have two weeks off to prepare for the Pointer Clas­sic held Nov. 14-15, in Stevens Point, Wis. Notre Dame will square off against St. John's on Friday night. The winner of that game will face the winner of the game between

Women's cross country takes 1st among Little Colleges at Ind. meet 


By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's cross country team continued to prove that it measures up to strong competition with im­pressive performances in two major meets. 
At the Indiana Intercol­legiate Meet October 17, the Irish placed first in the field of ten Little State colleges with 56 points, beating second place St. Joseph's (61 pts), third place Taylor (81 pts.) and seven other schools. The team placed fifth overall with 147 points, losing to Indiana (24 pts.), Purdue (57 pts.), Indiana State (103 pts.) and Ball State (111 pts.) 
Julia Merkel, with a time of 
17:55 for the 5,000 meter course, finished 7th overall and 2nd in the Little State Division. Along with Merkel, Irish run­ners Theresa Rice 08:50, Kathleen Lehman (19:05) and Wendy Murray (19:23) were named to the Indiana All-State 


ND men's team has mixed showing 
By GEORGE TRAVERS Sports Writer 
While most Notre Dame stu­dents relaxed over fall break, the Irish men's cross-country team battled with some of the toughest colleges in the country. The Irish turned in their best performance of the year in the Indiana Intercol­legiate Meet and then suffered a loss to the Houston in a dual meet. 
The Indiana meet marked the high point of a tough season for the cross-country team. Notre Dame came in third be­hind Indiana and Purdue. Other teams competing in­cluded South Indiana, Ball State and Indiana State. 
The best single performance of the meet was turned in by Mike O'Connor. O'Connor, a freshman took fifth place in the 8,000 meter run. He finished with an excellent time of 24:36. This fast time by O'Connor led the Irish to their best finish in a multi-school meet this year. 
Notre Dame's second meet of

Ventress 6-0,. 6-2 in the sixth singles position. 
The steady improvement of the doubles teams was evident as the Irish won two of the three doubles titles. Lohrer and Illig clinched the number two title by defeating Andersen and Ventress 6-3, 7-5. Schmidt and Kelly emerged winners at the number three doubles spot after upsetting top seeds Mary Foot and Sheila Murray of Mar­quette 6-2, 6-4. Schmidt and Kelly ended the season with an outstanding 8-2 record. 
The number-one doubles team of Dasso and Tolstedt lost a close match against Mar­quette's Prescott and Mulcahy, 7-6, 6-4. 
The latest NSC champion­ship plaque may be on the wall, but the women's tennis team is never one to rest on its laurels. It always has its sights on the future. 
"This spring we're striving for a winning record and in the future we'd like to become a respectable midwest con­tender," commented Gelfman. 
the fall break was not as en­couraging an experience. The travelled to the Houston for a dual meet and cam out on the short end of the score. Mike O'Connor, David Garret and Rick Mulvey all ran well but the Irish still fell to an excellent opponent. 
"It was a tough loss we are definitely better than our per­formance in Houston indi­cated," Piane said. 
Coach Piane and the team have a long time to prepare for their next meet. It will be the NCAA District IV champion­ships on November 15. Piane hopes to do well and rebound from their loss to Houston. 
"We have a few weeks to regroup, rest and prepare," said Piane. "We are a young team with a lot of potential." 
The championships will be a very tough challenge for the Irish. 
"We are in the toughest divi­sion in the United States," Piane said. "We have to com­pete against the Big Ten and Mid-America Conference. We also must run against state schools such as the University of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illi­nois, Indiana, Ohio and Mic­higan. Our future is extremely bright. We have unlimited po­tential." 
The Irish will have two weeks to prepare for the champion­ships. If they can regain the form the had in Indiana, they could surprise a few people.

team. Sophomore Kristine Dragani finished eighth for the Irish in her first varsity com­petition. 
Coach Dan Ryan said that despite a time gap of 2: 18 be­tween the first and fifth Irish finishers, everyone on the team ran personal bests at the Inter­Collegiate meet. 
"We were kind of lucky," Ryan said, "but I can't complain-everyone ran their best races of the year." 
Ryan noted that three Irish runners greatly improved their times over those at last year's I-C meet. Merkel improved by 
1: 18, Lehman by 2:48 and Nancy Loughlin by 2:19. Last year the team placed 8th in Little State and 12th overall. 
The Irish women turned in a second place finish at the North Star Conference meet in Mil­waukee on Saturday. DePaul won the team competition with 30 points, followed by Notre Dame with 55 and defending champion Marquette with 62. Dayton (94 pts.), Cleveland State (109 pts.) and the Univer­sity of Illinois at Chicago (190 pts.) completed the field. 
Ryan was pleased with the way the team beat Marquette. The Irish showed improvement over earlier meetings this year between the two conference competitors. 
Julia Merkel again led the Irish, finishing 2nd overall with a time of 18:25 and earning All­Conference honors. Rounding out the Irish top five were Leh­man, Rice, Linda Filar and Loughlin. Also competing for the Irish were Wendy Murray and Terry Kibelstis. 
"We did not run a good race time-wise," said Ryan, "but it was a great strategic race. As a team we ran better than ever before." 
The next meet for the Irish is the District meet at Illinois State November 15 followed by the National meet in Tuscon, Arizona.

Women's tennis wins NSC title; Gelfman earns coaching honors 
By SHEILA HOROX Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's tennis team brought its 1986 fall season to a successful close by capturing its fourth consecu­tive North Star Conference championship last weekend. The Irish came away with three singles and two doubles titles in the flighted tourna­ment. 
Head coach Michele Gelfman was also named the NSC Coach of the Year for the second-straight season. But Gelfman also attributes the team's success to the contribu­tion of assistant coach Steve Simone. 
The Irish stood atop the team standings with 46 points. Nor­thern Illinois, whose participa­tion was by invitation, finished second with 35, and Marquette, the team expected to challenge the Irish, placed third with 30 points. 
In both singles and doubles, every Notre Dame player was seeded either first or second in their respective draws, and not one finished lower than runner­up in the championships. 
Since most of the Irish received a bye in the opening rounds, getting into the flow of match play constituted the only problem the Irish encountered. 
"Our entire line up was like a sixth man coming off the bench," Gelfman said. "We didn't have a chance to warm up." 
Freshman Stephanie Tolstedt ousted Northern Illi­nois' Sari Dinerman 6-3, 6-2, to win the number two singles title and Alice Lohrer, another freshman, took the number three singles title with a 6-3, 6-1, victory over Northern Illinois' VanLankvelt.

Special to The Observer 

Student basketball season ticket sales are slated to begin Monday, Nov. 3, with seniors purchasing their tickets first. 
Tickets prices are $60 for lower arena and $45 for upper arena seating. Sales will be held at Gate 10 of the ACC, beginning at 1:30 and continuing until 6. Sales to juniors will be held Tuesday, followed by sophomores, law and graduate students on Wednesday and freshmen on Thursday. 
Students should have received their ticket applications during break. Anyone who did not should go to the ticket office as soon as possible to get an application. 
Saint Mary's students are not included in this sale. Tickt sales for Saint Mary's will be held by the Saint Mary's Office of Student Activities. 
Ticket Manager Mike Bobinski says he does not envision a ticket shortage. Last year, several hundred freshmen were turned away when student tickets sold out. 
Students should note that the season ticket package does not include the opening game of the Coca-Cola NIT against Western Kentucky on Nov. 21. Tickets for that game will go on sale at a later date. 
Tickets for the men's and women's Blue-Gold games are on sale now at the ACC. Prices are $2 for adults and $1 for students. Proceeds from the gaines will go to Logan Center and the Neighborhood Study Help Program. 
The women's game begins at 6:30, followed by the men's game at 7:30. 

Senior co-captain Tammy Schmidt won the number four singles title with a 6-2, 6-1 vic­tory over Lee ann Milne of N. Illinois. Gelfman praised the play of her only senior. 
"Tammy played with a hunger in her eyes," Gelfman said. "Her performance was incredible. She was hitting shots an inch and a half inside the baseline that were not only winners, but her opponent couldn't even get her racquet on the ball." 
Junior co-captain Michelle Dasso, sophomore Natalie Illig 
and  freshman  Resa  Kelly  
finished  runner-up  in  their  
respective draws.  

Dasso, seeded second at the number one singles position fell to top seed Meg Mulcahy of Marquette, 7-6, 6-4. Illig lost to NIU's Andersen, 6-4, 6-4 in the fifth singles bracket, and Kelly was defeated by NIU's

This past weekend the Notre Dame hockey team opened its 1986-87 season with a pair of losses to Kent State in the first games of the new American Collegiate Hockey Association. 
The visiting Flashes scored two first-period goals in Friday's contest and held off the Irish for a 4-2 win. Fresh­man winger Tim Kuehl of Edina, Minn., and sophomore winger Matt Hanzel of St. Paul, Minn., were the lone scorers for Notre Dame, while senior Tim Lukenda, a native of Saulte Ste. Marie, Ontario, turned aside 20 shots in the losing effort. 
Saturday, Kent State again scored two quick first-period goals and held on for a 2-1 win. Freshman winger Bruce Guay of North Smithfield. R.I., 
tallied for the single Irish goal, while freshman goalie Lance Madson of Minnetonka, Minn., turned in a strong performance by allowing only a single goal and recording 28 saves. 
"I was not at all pleased with our overall performance last weekend," said Notre Dame head coach Lefty Smith. "We were not as free an flowing in the games as we haq been in practice. We need to fore-check better and be more aggressive in the future." 
One area in which the Irish are sure to improve is their power play unit. Notre Dame was only able to convert 1-of-11 power-play opportunities. 
"Our power play was totally ineffective against Kent State," continued Smith. "We were too tentative and unor­ganized. That is something we will concentrate on in practice this week." 

Notre Dame is a very young team with Lukenda and left wing John Nickodemus being the only returning seniors. Thus, Smith sees the 1985-86 season as a rebuilding year, but one that will be very competi­tive. 
"We are still feeling the ef­fects of our move to the club level during the 1983-84 season," says Smith. "Even though we returned to Division I the following season, we did so without the benefit of being able to offer scholarships. This hampered recruiting for a while, but (assitant coach) Tom Carroll did an excellent job bringing in freshmen last year." 
Due to the youthfulness of his squad. Smith is faced with the

The pros and cons of an open date 
Off weeks in the season are curious things. 
Coaches and players often try to explain the advantages and disadvantages of breaks during the week, but sometimes that changes after the next game. 
If the team wins, we hear the list of advantages of the break. If it loses, the list of disadvantages is given. 
Either way the team is covered. This little sys­tem works much like popular sayings "Absence makes the heart grow fonder" and "Out of sight, out of mind." Between the two, all possible events are pretty well covered. 
If a team loses, there are several problems that may have occurred over the break. First, the team may have lost its timing. Since this is such a touchy area, and split seconds are precious, one can see how this can happen, especially if the coach has given the team a few days off. 
Another one, which could be loaded in the Irish arsenal, is that the break stopped the team's mo­mentum. Mter a cakewalk over Air Force, the Irish seemed primed to roll over their next op­ponent had they played last Saturday. The break may slow the flow of that ever-elusive momentum. 
Of course, the Mets could have used that one, but they went out and avoided the problem by winning even after their so-called momemtum had been slowed by Sunday's rainout. 
The last explanation used by losing teams we will examine is that the week off took the team's 
mind off football. With no opponent on the horizon, the team lost sight of its goal, they may explain. But all of these excuses can be cast aside with 
a simple victory. 
Mter a victory, a team also has many explana­tions from which to choose. The first one concerns injuries. Mter getting battered and bruised during the course of a season, what better way for the team to get healthy again than to get a week off?

Players that normally would miss a game now have one week to rest and one week to practice. How convenient. 
Some may argue that there should be more off­weeks for this reason alone, but that causes scheduling headaches. That means that the season may have to start even earlier in baseball season to end in time for the "bowl season." When the Kickoff Classic, college football's first game of the year, is being played before most students have their class schedules memorized you know that it cannot be pushed ahead much farther. 
Another advantage of the week off, winning coaches will claim, is that the team has time to get away from the grind, even if only for a few days. The disappointments of a season can snow­ball, and with a week off, the players can take a step back. and re-evaluate the direction they are headed, and rededicate the team's goals. 
Irish head coach Lou Holtz said the Irish used the break to get back to fudamentals, especially with the young players. This seems to make sense with the current situation. 
The final reasoning for a victory is that the team had two weeks to prepare for the opponent. Ala­bama was a prime example of this explanation being beaten to a pulp. The problem with this is that if the Irish are going to have two weeks to prepare for a team, Navy might be the last team the Irish choose. 
With a week off to prepare for an opponent, you would hope that the opponent is one of the tougher ones on the schedule, and Navy obviously does not fit that bill. 
Nevertheless, the Irish have had their week off, and their performance on Saturday will decide what the break did to the team. We could be hearing complaints of rustiness, or ravings of the much-needed time off. 
Let's all hope the Irish will be using the second set of descriptions of their break after Saturday's game.
