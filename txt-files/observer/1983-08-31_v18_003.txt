Mixing the classes in the residence halls is one ofthe methods Jackowski plans to use to unite Saint Mary's students.

And. poli~T said, paint chips from ~licinski"~ car matchnl samples taken la~t September. Tran·s of the victims' clothing were l(nmd on the car, police added. 
Vlicinski allegnlh had been 
driving back from the l.ineh.~Cker"s 
Club, a tavern on South Bend ,\\T. 
He recalled having "a little hit more 

than I should have to drink," and 
could not remember clearly what 
happened that evening. 

"It's hard to believe they (the 
police) really did anything," said 
Mcinerny. "I thought the whole inci· 
dent was over, and now it's heing 
stirred up again. I'm not looking for· 
ward to going through it again. 

:\1annion agreed. "It's almost a 
year gone hy now. I can walk. My 
head is fine. I don't have any had 
feelings now. I want to forget about 
the whole thing. Actually, I feel 
more sorry for him ( Micinski) than I 
do for me." 

Both Mcinerny and Mannion are 
still feeling the effects of last year's 
accident. "I have memory lapses all 
the time now," described \1clncrny. 
"I don't remember the tlrst month of 
last year and barely remember my 
freshman )Tar ofcollege. I had tore· 
learn all kinds of things, like my mul· 
tiplication tables." 

"Before the accident, I was a Latin 
major," she continued. "But now I 
forgot all the Latin I knew and I had 
to drop the major completely." 

Mcinerny, who was supposed to 
graduate in May of 198S, now says 
that she will not graduate until 
August or even December of that 
year. "I took six hours last spring. 
and that was about alii could handle.

It is only during the last five or six years that Saint Mary's has become more "class ~cgrcgated," said Jack· owski, and that h;ts created the need to "mix" students liveing in the residence halls. 
Residence halls are traditionally divided according to class: freshmen are placed in Regina, sophomores in lloly Cross, both juniors and seniors in LeMans and seniors in Augusta. 
The change will he gradual, said the new dean. About 50 spaces a year will he set aside, mostly in Regina. These spaces will not be

the College, not just in residence 
and student life. "It is a whole dif.

Jackowski has heen director of 
residence life for the last five years. 
She replaces Kathleen Rice, who 
resigned as dean at the end of last 
semester. 
Chosen from a field of four can· 
didates, Jackowski was informed o 
her new appointment in June. 
Had she not been appointed the new dean, she would have returned to New York University to complete ·her dissertation for her Ph.D in high·

"I like working here," she said, but 
her job as qirector of residcqce life 
was getting 'stale.' I had done what I

"People arc afraid they may he in the same position themselves, some­day," Palladino said as an explana­tion for the study's tindings. 
During two separate surveys. students read 12 vignettes involving a lwpothctical situation involving a man who attended a social gathering and drank 1arying amounts of al· coho! or nothing stronger than a soli drink. After leaving the gathering, thl' man was involved in an accident.

Altered virus used to repair bad genes 
NEW YORK (AP) -A genetic defect responsible for a severe human brain disorder has been cor~ rected in the laboratory bv infecting defective human cells with a virus that inserts a new gene into them, thereby restoring normal function, researchers said Tuesday. 
It is the t1rst time viruses have been used in human cells to correct a genetic defect responsible for a human disease, the researchers said. 
The researchers estimated that it will he four or t1ve years before the technique moves out of the laboratory and into trials with patients. 
The disease, known as Lesch­Nyhan syndrome, is a brain disorder that results in mental retardation and strange behavior patt~rns, including a tendency toward self­mutilation and compulsive ag­gressive behavior, according to Richard Leavitt, a spokesman for the \1arch of Dimes Birth Defects foundation. It strikes males almost exclusively, occurring once in every 50,000 male births. 
The new technique, developed hy lnder Verma of the Salk Institute in San Diego and Dr. Theodore Fried­mann of the University of California at San Diego. 
It could lead to treatment for a wide variety of human genetic diseases, said Friedmann. "I tend to think this kind of manipulation will find its place in therapy," Friedmann said in a telephone interview. But he added that "it won't cure every­thing." 
Blood disorders and immune 
deficiency diseases are likely can­
didates for this type of tre:nment, he 
said. 
Lesch-!'Jyhan syndrome i~ due to ;1 defect in a single gene, which trig­gers the production of an enzyme known as HPRT, Friedmann said.

Flood of sculptures takes campus by storm 
by Marc Ramirez 
I
t looks like a giant llnited Artists logo.. Or maybe the shipwrecked remains of a yacht. 
Or possibly the damage left behind af­ter the 1972 tloods in the southern tier of New York. 
The last is what artist Glenn Zweygardt had in mind when he created "Upheaval X." Tenth in a series ofsculptures in­spired by the disaster, it is one ofseveral new art structures on the Notre Dame campus this year. Made ofcorten steel and painted in bronze, the structure stands 19-feet tall and is located near juniper Road between the Pasquerilla Residence Halls and the Memorial Library. 
Zweygardt, a professor at Alfred Uni­versity, says he is influenced by "the forces of nature." A second work of his, titled "Blue Mountain Blues" and made of steel and blue enamel, is now part of the Snite Museum's permanent collection. 
At the top of the landing in the Center t(>r Continuing Education is a 48-inch stainless steel sculpture by New jersey artist Paul Sisko. Sisko's work is precise in pattern and explores the interrelation­ship offorms. IIe is a graduate of Montclair State College. 
Two works in wood have also been in­stalled on campus, one just east of the Center for Social Concerns, and the other south ofSt. Mary's Lake. They are designed by Tom Sternal, chairman ofthe Art Department at Winona State Univer­sity in Minnesota. Entitled "Bench Piece," the works are fashioned out oftree trunks which have been split lengthwise and 
then placed side-by-side on benches. 
They serve as sitting areas as well as 
sculptures. 

The artworks were selected for the 
campus by the Campus Sculpture Com­
mittee and were instituted approximately 
a year ago by University President Father 
Theodore Hesburgh to tllter out the bet­
ter works from the many which are of­
fered to Notre Dame each

Disaster inspired this structure ofart which now decorates the Notre Dame campus. 


'Christ' on tour 
Ivan Mestrovic's "Christ and the Samaritan Woman at the Well" may not be a new staute on campus but soon it will be new in New Orleans. With the permission of the artist's widow, this familiar statuary piece is being reproduced for exhibit in the Vatican Pavillion at an international festival scheduled for this Louisiana city next year.

The complex Heart 
by Vic Sciulli 
T
'he Wild 1/eart is Stevie Nicks' second solo album away from rock group l'ketwood Mac. lt should have been the effort that would gain her the respectability she has searched for as an artist. The album t has many strong assets: crystal dean (but not too slick) production, some of the best musicians in the business and Nicks' ~trongest vocal performance to date. But despitt· these, Tbe Wild Heart falls short of its expectations. 
Nicks' abstruse compositions arc the culprit. Throughout her songwriting career, Nicks has existed in a world ofW'dsh witches. gypsies and nightbirds. Though steeped in symbolism. her song~ sounded sincere and were, for the most part, comprehensible. She may have gone a bit too far out this time, however. 
Many ofthe songs' lyrics are like a series ofcomplex striking images; unfortunately they are also incoherent and end up sounding siliy and pretentious as in "Nighthird." 
And the summer became thefall I was not readvfor the winter It makes no difference at all 'Cause I wear boots all sumnierlong 
Poetry in motion? Perhaps, but the truth may he that no one is privy to Stevie's thoughts except Stevie. The LP lacks any songs that match the simple beautv ofearlier compositions like 19~5·s "Landslide" or ''Leather and Lace" from Bella Donna. 
The album is t;tr from a loss, however. Nicb' voice. though gravelly at times, is at its best ever; thepetitefille cooing is still around hut there is some new strength too. Accompanied once a!!.ain by Sharon Celani and Lori Perry on background vocals. the three produce a beautiful and strangely compelling sound. In addition she has sur· rounded herselfwith an excellent line-up of musici;ms. including former-Eagle Don Felder, theE Street Band's Roy Bittan, 'vlick fleet· wood. Russ Kunkel and Waddy Watchel. Their sound is clean and tight. 
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers accompany Nicks on "I Will Run 
To You," written bv Petry. Though not as strong  their 19H I duet  
"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around," the collahorati  1 is still a powerful  
one. Petty does not have the cleareM delivery in  •ck but the total  
sound is much better than the sum of its parts.  

The usc ofsynthesizers is much greater this time around. A simple alternation betwen two chords dominates the !iount\ on "Stand Back," one of the summer's funkiest hits, and "IfAnyone !'alb." A programmed drum machine adds a syncopated beat to "Nightbird." 
"Beauty and the Beast" is Nicks' biggest self-indulgence on the al· bum. The song b written from the point-of-view of the maiden in the movie of the same name. Only Nicks could make the song work; she throws herselfcompletely into the song, assuming the Beauty's iden­tity. An arrangement oft·ellos, violas, violins and harps accompany Nicks on the lilting ballad. 
The best moments on the album come when Nicks confronts her emotions straight on as in "Stand Back" and "Nothing Ever Changes." On the latter, a scorned Nicks sings with a Pat Bcnatar/Chrissie llynde affrontivencss. 
Ifit's me that's dri1•ing you to this madness Then there's one thing that I'd like to say Take a look atvour life andyourlm•ers Nothing e11er changes 
Phil Kenzie provides one of the hottest sax solos since Junior Walker's pcrh>rm:mce on ''l'rgent." "Enchanted" is Nicks at her rock­n-roll best. Kunkel's drums and Bittan's piano give the song a Warren 
· .ZeJJon feel. 
Nicks should be given some credit for taking risks and not putting out another Bella Donna; she has shown that she is indeed able to stand on her own outside the cont1ncs ofFleetwood Mac. Artists must always be wary ofalienating their audiences; however, and this is what 
Nicks will have to be aware ofin future outings. Too much ofThe Wild Heart is confusing; a return to simpler times may be in order.

NEW YORK ( AP) -Top-seeded John Mdinroe and defending cham­pion Jimmy Connors won their opening round matches yesterday in the llnited States Open Tennis Championships, with .VIcEnroe shaking olf an upset hid hy Trey Waltke aftt·r a dispute with a spec­tator and a minor llareup with the umpire.

McEnroe, midway through his match, tossed sawduM and shouted at the spectator, acts which resulted 
s 

in a SI,000 fine. "The guy clapped when I double faulted and clapped when I missed shots," said McEnroe, adding that he lost control over the episode. 
Many players keep sawdust in their pockets and use it to get a bet­ter grip on their rackets when their hands perspire. 
Jose Luis-Cierc of Argentina, seeded eighth, and the 15th-seeded woman, Virginia Ruzici of Romania, lost their opening-round matches in the 52 million tournament at the Na­tional Tennis Center.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP)­Nebraska football coach Tom Os­borne said yesterday he's not so sure hb No. !-ranked Cornhuskers are as awesome as they appeared when they routed defending national champion Penn State in the in­augural Kickoff Classic. 
"We're probably not as good as many people think we are." Osborne said by phone from Lincoln. Neb., "and Penn State probably is not as bad as people think they are. It was~ game that can cause some overreac­tion." 
The Cornhuskers dominated the Nittany Lions as few teams ever have in their 4'!-6 victory Monday night at Giants Stadium. It matched Penn State's worst loss since Joe Paterno became their coach I7 years ago. 
"I think we're a very g~>od football team. The question in my mind is where do we go from here." Os­borne said. "It'd be very easy for our players to believe our No. I ranking and the nice things said about them and not work hard. If that happens, we'll lose some games. 
"On the other hand, thev could feel it's a good beginning a~d want to improve some," he added. "I think we have a lot of potential and if we pay attention to business we can he

Experienced secondary gets ready to stop opponents' passing attack 
By THERON ROBERTS 
.\jmrts Writer 
"We all know our pass defense has to he better. We need to improve our aAArt·ssi\'encss and react quick­t·r when the otht-r team is in passing silllations.·· 
Such are the words of Ilead Coach <ierry Faust who realizt•s that im· provement in the defensive secon­dary could he a key to success for his 19H5 Irish. 
In 19H2. the Notre Dame defense allowed IHH. 'i yards per game in the air -nearly twice as many yards as it surrendered on the ground. 
Also, while the Irish did snare are­spectable I~ interceptions last season, strong safety Dave Duerson 
( 
7) and linebacker Mark Zavagnin 

( 
5) now both belong to the Chicago Hears. That leaves only seven inter­ceptions among all of the returning defensive hacks. 


Experience, however, is some­thing that defensive coordinator and secondary coach Jim Johnson can hank on this year. 
Three-year starter Stacey Toran, a senior and the team's defensive cap­tain, will again fill the strong corner­hack position. Fellow senior Chris Brown occupies the free safety spot, while Joe Johnson, a junior, holds the strong safety slot for the second year. 
"We have a smart, experienced secondary," boasts Coach Johnson, "we don't have the superspeedy ath­letes, but we arc physical and we probably use more types of coverages than most other teams do." 
Toran will spearhead the pass defending corps. Agreat one-on-one pass defender, Toran will draw the opposing team's best receiver each week lie also was third in tackles last year, proving that he is also a proticicm tackler. 
"The two key things we must do this year to have a good secondary is to he aAAressive and he sure we have no mental breakdowns," states Toran. 
The Irish co-captain. assumed his duty at the cornerback position in the third game of his Notre Dame career and has held it ever since. Therct(,re, he can provide the neces­sary leadership for consistent play from the defensive backfield. 
New to the free safety position in the spring, Brown has the natural ability required to play the position, at least according toJohnson. 
Brown had the third highest num­ber of minutes played of all return­ing defensive players, next to Toran and fellow safety Joe Johnson. 
Earlier criticized for his lack ofag­gressiveness, Brown has become a force this fall, showing that he has the potential to instill fear in op­ponent's receivers. 

Johnson feels that Brown's inten­sity will help him in playing at free safety. 
Joe Johnson continues to be the hard hitter that earned him the reputation of a "head hunter." He is an ideal strong safety who is often called on to blitz opposing quarter­hacks, making or assisting on five tackles for losses in Saturday's scrimmage alone. 
These three members of the st·condary also have the luxury of ha\'ing worked together all of last season. 
"The three of us communicate well with each other," saysJohnson. "We have been working together for two years now, and at any given time each one ofus knows what the other guy is doing." 
The only new face starting in the defensive backfield is sophomore Pat Ballage. Possessing better than average speed, Ballage has the task of filling the weakside cornerback spot vacated when Brown moved to free safety. 
Although he sat out spring practice with an ankle InJury, Ballage has been playing well so far this fall. 
Even though he is the most inex­perienced member of the defensive backfield, Ballage thinks that he will not get picked on by opponents.

Gerry Faust: Third-year coach faces cruci:al· season as he feels some heat from alumni, students, and fans, but mostly from himself 

It's been called by some the second toughest job in Amt:rica. Others have called it the second most impor­tant position in the Catholic Church. It has wrecked havoc on the strongest of personalities, rapidly turning the hair of more than a few men gray. A9d, while many men would die for the job, few envy the person who gets it. 
It is the job of Notre Dame Head Football Coach. 
The trials and tribulations of Irish football coaches arc well-known. Even a person as loved and successful as Ara Parseghian kit the pressure and it eventually forced him to resign. 
Dan Devine felt the pressure even more, partly be­caust· he was not quite as successful as Parseghian, but mostly because the students and alumni never warmed up to him. 
Now Gerry Faust is feeling the heat, perhaps more so than any coach since the days ofJoc Kuharich and Terry Brennan more than 20 years ago. 
Faust came to Notre Dame with some impressive credt·ntials at Moeller High School in Cincinnati, and his arrival in South Bend was greeted by a barrage of national coverage. Still, there wa' some question about whether it was wise to pick someone with just a high­school background to take over the second toughest job in America. 
But the students soon discovered that the choice of Faust was not so surprising. All it took was an ap­pearance by the new coach. IIere was a man who played frisbee in the quad with the students, ate pizza with stu­dents, and played Bookstore Basketball. Any guy who did all this was a true Domer(translation for freshmen: a Notre Dame student). and, of course. when it came to foothall, Domers didn't lose. 
It looked like this Domer was going to be the biggest winner off them all after h'.-; t1rst game against Louisiana State. If you were around, you probably remember people standing on top ofStepan Center to get a look at the new coach at his t1rst pep rally. You probably remember how the offense lined up in more ways than ever before. You probably remember screaming, "(;erry! Gerry!'' as the victorious coach left the field. You probably remember that the new coach had brought his team to No. I after just one game. 
Well, we know tlu: disappointing story by now. Things went downhill from there. This Domer did losl'. at kast more than Domer~ were allowed to. 
And there were many people who let Gerry Faust know that he was not supposed to lose, especially with what they considered extremely talented teams. 
!'>tudents started scrc;uning. "Oust faust!" instead of "Gerry! <icrry!" and the press began writing about his demise. 
But worst of all there were the alumni. You know, those guys who march their kids through their old rooms in Farley and W'alsh, wear obnoxious clothes,

and contribute gobs of monev to the I :nivcrsity. They were furious bcc;mst· the nt·w coach was giving the school a had name. Notre Dame was supposed to be better than everyone d~t·. 
Their reasoning that Faust should he axed, whik per· haps marked by a sincere love for a great university, soon led them to think unckarlv. The only reason for the team's poor showing. they k-It, was (;erry Faust, a coach who, to quote an alumni. was still "wet behind the ears." 
Maybe they were partly correct. Some of the coach­ing decisions did not appear to he the right ones, like sitting on the ball late in the tirst half against Arizona. But they didn't realize that there were plenty of other reasons, like injuries, li1r the team·~ demise. 
Or, more likdy, they realized it, hut didn't want to acknowledge it. 
But I will not offer excuses for Gerry Faust and, I'm sure. he would not want me to. lie know~ that ht· has not done the joh that was expt·cted of him by the stu· dents, fans, and alumni. 
But. most ofall, he hasn't done the joh he expected of himself 
(;erry Faust docs not need the alumni and students to put a great deal of pressure on himself I k puts a gn·at deal on himself Coaching Notre Dame has been hi~ dream and he realizes that hi~ drt·am is ~lipping away. lie doesn't need anyone to tell him that. 
So this year is going to he an important one ti1r Faust. He has what is probably his best team ever. lie ha~ out­standing coaches and has learned how to use them bet­ter. And he ha~ an easy ~cheduk hv Notre Dame standards. lie must do better than 6-t·l and it b almost imperative that the team go to a howl game.

No, (ierry Faust need~ to win li>r himself: lie is still very fril'ndly, hut the pres~ure st-em' to he taking some of the spunk out of him. It i~ not hard to tell that the pressure b getting to him.
