MORRISTOWN, N.J. <AP> ­A Superior Court judge ruled Monday that Kar..m Anne Quin­lan must be kept alive with a mechanical life-support system because "there is no con­stitutional right to die." 
Judge Hobert Muir Jr. said the decision on whether to turn off the respirator that has kept the 21-vear-old woman alive 

Sherlockian cult 
by Pete Arndt Staff Reporter 
Does Sherlock Holmes really exist? Is this man with the narrow face. thin nose, and piercing eyes who used to occupy 221 Baker St. still around working at his last occupation, keeping bees in the English countryside? 
,John Bennet Shaw, an N.D. graduate of the class of 1938, last night in Washington Hall gave his audience of 100 an intimate and revealing look into one of the most interesting legends of our times, Sherlock Holmes. 
Shaw. a scholar on the subject of the super sleuth, talked for over an hour concerning Holmes and the activities of the many clubs which center around the fictitious detective. 
A subject which has intrigued many devotees of Mr. Holmes is the question of whether or not he was a drug addict, Shaw said. llolmes regularly took a mixture of water with seven percent eocaine as a relaxant. This was not uncommon in Holmes time, said Shaw, and addiction was not possible from so small an amount. Yet, the debate stll carries on in Holmes clubs across the 
nation. 
Besides going through Holmes' genealogy, Shaw said the 
material covers almost every subject possible concerning him: 
Holmes and wine, Holmes and food, Holmes and women and an 
unsavory subject among the organizations, Holmes and sex. 
Shaw discussed the many pamphlets, articles, papers and books printed concerning Holmes' cases, idiosyncracies and ideas which float through the many orgamzations formed throughout the country to try to keep alive the legend of Holmes. 
Shaw personally owns over 35,000 books on Holmes and over 
10,000 Sherlock Holmes artifacts, including a tie with Holmes' 
famous symbol of a deer stalker's hat emblazoned on it. 
He wore a pin with the number 221 on his left lapel, and his cufflinks were buttons from an officer's coat of Mr. Watson's old military regiment. 
Shaw has helped form many of these organizations and is an active member of an exclusive club he helped form in New York, ''The Baker Street Irregulars."This all-male club meets regularly to discuss, among other things, the "canon" of the Holmes cult: the 56 short stories and 4 novels written about the adventures of Holmes. The club, of which Franklin Roosevelt was a member, hold their meetings at symbolic places. 
At one meeting place, a restaurant, the patrons had to walk 
seventeen steps to get to the door, the same number of steps to 
Holmes' door on Baker St. 
An activity at tht:se meetings is to quiz the other members of the 
club by stating a passage from a Holmes story and requiring the member to state the context and the title of the story in which the quote appears. The loser buys a round of drinks for the club, which 
numbers over one-hundred. 
The cult of followers does not rely totally on Sherlock Holmes for 
their duscussion topics. They take time to discuss Holmes' partner, 
Mr. Watson, and his chief adversary, Mr. Moriarty. 
The Holmes legend has a great following, according to Mr. Shaw. 
He stated that the legend is still strong. "Even today," Shaw said, 
"leUers are received on the average of 10 a week at 221 Baker 
Street, addressed to Mr. Sherlock Holmes."

'Society unfair, so are tests' the observer 
Dr. Williams attacks testing of blacks 

by Pat Cole Staff Rt>porter 
"A test can only reflect society. And if society is culturally unfair, then so are the tests." 
Dr. Robert L. Williams, professor of psychology from Washington University in St. Louis attacked the testing of black in­telligence last night in the Memorial Library Auditorium. 
"The powers that be control the achievement test. This ultimately controls how blacks get into t·ollege," Williams said to a group of 70 people. "Psychological tests are a spin-off of the power motive in this society." 
Williams stated that the purpose behind intelligence testing is to prl'dict achievement. "This is now known as the IQ Test," he said. "However. this was used by supremists to negate the black txperience." 
Williams stated that the "mushroom theory" is one ob­stacle used by educators to limit the tducational growth of blacks. 
"You do three things to a mushroom," Williams explained. "You keep it in the dark, feed it manure, and then you watch it grow. Similarly, blacks have been kept in the dark and fed manure in this educational system." 
"Today, many people don't like the truth," he continued. "The Bible says that 'you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.' But I say that the truth will make you mad as hell about black education." 
Williams is currently a professor of psychology at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. He received his B.A. degree from Philander Smith College in Little Hock, Arkansas in 1953. He ob­tained a Master's degree in l'ducation from Wayne University and a Ph.D. from Washington University in 1961. 
Williams is one of the founders of the Association of Black Psychologists and is a former Director of Black Studies at Washington University. He is currently Director of Graduate Training in Urban Minority Mental Health. 
Williams is the originator of the Black Intelligence Test of Cultural Homogeneity <BITCH). He has appeared on CBS' IQ Myth Special and his work has been cited in CBS' "Good Times" Show. 
Williams cnea nis personal experience of testing intelligence. "I scored 82 on my IQ test and was now allowed to enter college," he said. "I stayed out of college for two years. When I finally went to college, I earned straight A's the first semester and graduated cum laude. I went on from there to earn master's and doctor's degrees." 
"Obviously I knew that something was wrong with the instruments of testing," Williams commented. "The problem was that I had a white IQ of 82 but a black IQ of probably 182. 
Williams explained that this led him to explore the nature of testing programs for black students. He said that the tests do not "relate to the black experience and demand white, middle class response." 
Ombudsman committee to find other uses for LaFortune Center 
Bv Don Hrimt'r Stni;,r Staff Hrporter 
The Ombudsman service an­
nounced yesterday it will form a committee to study possible ehangcs in the use of LaFortune Studtnt Center. The committee will become completely in­depmdent of the Ombudsman office after its formation. 
Matt Cockrell. Ombudsman director. txplained the purpose of the new committee. "The com­mittee will be concerned with making any further suggestions on structural changes in LaFortune," lw said. "Also it will examine student needs and how LaFortune could be used to solve them." 
One of the provisions in the first LaFortune study committee, formed four years ago, was for the formation of a control board to oversee the operation and use of the LaFortune center, according to Sue Darin. who will chair the new committee. 
The new committee will serve 
the same purpose as the original study group except that many of its duties have been diminished by the Lal<'ortune renovation. 
A major purpose of the com­mittee will be to encourage people to use the center for club activities. "The center has so much potential and it's not being used," said Cockrell. 
Cockrell said the center is used primarily by campus media and students who need a place to study. "Wl' must draw people up there," he continued, "and if there is an activitity, they'll be more likely to go there." 
Darin pointed to the Rathskeller as a possible area in which the eommittee might do some work.

Williams criticized the Bain Test of Basic Concepts used in testing intelligence. The test uses 50 concepts to examine a child's reasoning skills. 
"For example, the test may ask a child to determine when a baseball is behind a sofa in a sketch. But to a black child, the word 'sofa' does not register. In nearly all cases, the black children get the question right if the word 'couch' is used." 
"Language is very important in the use of tests because it is a part of a person's culture," he stated.

Over the weekend, the Scholastic Course Evaluation Booklet for the spring semester, 1976, was distributed to both campuses. Several members of the editorial board and staff of Scholastic, CE or both felt that this occasion both merits and demands a few comments. I was asked to voice these views. 
This booklet has been published by Scholastic for approximately eight years, at various times falling also under the auspices of the Observer. It has, in the past, been funded by Scholastic and is presently being funded by both Scholastic and Student Govern­ment. 
The setup of the booklet demands the cooperation of both the student body and the various departments. The students must write the evaluations of the courses and gather and sort the in­formation; the departments must supply course descriptions. From this system there should ideally come the most accurate descriptions, written by the professors themselves, and deman­ding, critical evaluations written by the students. The remainder of the student body should be able to rely on the evaluations to give them a precise idea of the format and success of a given course. Unfortunately, this situation has not existed, much to the detriment of the booklet. 
The vast majority, upwards of 80 or 90 per cent, of the evaluations in this booklet are weak and useless. Instead of critically analyzing the format of the class and the effectiveness of the professor, the evaluations tend to be pallid mimises and boring rehashes of what was already said in the descriptions. They wander far from the critical analyses they were intended to be, and instead, end up being the exact opposite: unqualified opinions. 
The descriptions, while being superior to the evaluations, still leave something to be desired in numerous cases. Several departments refused to cooperate and, as a result, the descriptions for those departments are sketchy, incomplete and hurried. In other words, they are of no help at all to a student. Other descriptions fail in an opposite manner; they tend to be verbose and to ramble on. They leave the student mired in an overabundance of detail. 
Herein lies the problem with CE. The booklet is for the use and benefit of the student, but it must also be written and produced by students. It is a service by and for themselves. Even in the case of descriptions, students are responsible for the collection and arrangement of them. It is ultimately the student body that has failed itself. 
Tremendous amounts of work and effort were put into this book by the members of its staff and editorial board. Long hours were spent gathering the material, proofreading and organizing it, getting it typed for production and in the prodiction itself. This went to the extreme of several students spending the entire USC weekend (40 strai~ht hours) putting the booklet together. This caused them to m1ss not only the game, the concert and other festivities of that weekend, but also the necessities of daily living. However, I would like to point out that we are not complaining about the amount of time that was put into this booklet-it was done willingly. 
But we feel that the amount of time that we put in this booklet was not proportional to the amount of cooperation we received in gathering the information for the booklet. We feel dismayed at the long hours we spent when other students could not even put in the hour or two necessary to make the evaluations and descriptions worthwhile. We are forced to ask ourselves why we put so much effort into a booklet that other people seem to care so little about. 
In effect we are asking for an evaluation of the CE by the student body: an evaluation not only in verbal support or condemnation <We ran a survey last semester at registration which received 1800 responses and showed approximately 95 per cent of the student body in favor of the continuation of the booklet.) but more im­portantly, in the form of precise and accurate descriptions and evaluations by the students. 
Perhaps we have reached the point where no one cares enough about evaluation of the curricula here, and if that is the case, the booklet should no longer be published. But if there is true support for the booklet, we are asking and demanding physical proof of it. 
To use a cliche, "the ball is in your court." Whatever happens to the booklet is now entirely up to the student body.

Morality Vs. Ethics 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~ paul herbi9 
There is presently a great debate going on in this country con­cerning what themorals of this country should be. Many people say the country has lost its moral fiber and is in jeopardy of becoming another Rome. Immorality is being proclaimed all across the land as not the exception but the rule. This attitude is the prevailing mood throughout middle class America. 
But it seems that all of those yelling for stronger moral fibers have lost track of realities. What they are shouting for is not what they really mean. Moralsare individual idiosyncrasies individual beliefs and ideas. They are not a group process or co~mon to a large mass <rather a large mass of individuals may possess the same moral belief but it is not a group consensus but because each pri~a.te in~ividual believes that way and prefres it that way) Being mdividuahzed, they ca~not .tre proclaimed right or wrong as it is up to each member to decide hiS own set of values. They are his moral beliefs, let alone take them away. Being his they are exempt from other's regulations and views. 
Unfortunately such is not the case in the country today. The prevailingmood is that there is indeed a set of morals, that it should

Won't refrain from outblrsts 
'Squeaky' barred again from courtroom 

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -Lynette Fromme, who blind­folded herself and was carried into the courthouse by a deputy marshal, was barred again Monday from her trial on charges of trying to kill Presi­dent Ford. 
The 27-year-old follower of Charles Manson, convicted with four others in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and six other persons, refused to prom­ise U.S. District Court Judge 
Thomas  MacBride  that  she  
would  refrain  from  future  out­ 
bursts in  court.  
Last  Friday  she  was  twice  

ejected after trying to plead guilty and demanding that !\I anson be allowed to testify. She also vowed that she would have to be carried from the jailhouse to court. 
U.S. Marshal Arthur Van Court said Miss Fromme was wearing a red scarf as a blind­fold when officers arrived at her cell Monday morning. He said she neither resisted nor co-
Williams attacks testing of blacks 
(continued from page 3) whites to enable them to know how black people communicate. ··My test has shaken up the in­dustry because they don't know how to deal with the black com­munity," Williams revealed. "As proof. many whites can't answer questions on my test. Yet they are allowed to work with black kids." The BITCH test is designed for black people 16 years or older to measure their cultural homogeneity. 
The Scholastic Aptitude Test has not been an effective means of measuring black intelligence, according to Williams. 
"Only 15 percent of black kids score above 400 on the SAT," he said. "Only 2 percent score above 'iOO on this exam. But black :-;tudents are getting into college in higher numbers than before. Something must be wrong." 
Williams called the Law School .\ptitude Test "inaccurate." Ac­cording to Williams, these tests are designed to predict college suc­cess. "But by keeping a student out of school because of a low test score. you don't give him a chance to succeed." he said. 
Williams explained that the SAT will not be eliminated because of "Power and money," indicating that the Educational Testing S<rvice is a multi-million dollar business. 
Williams listed the steps that a black man goes through in achieving his modes of thinking. "First there is the pre-encounter stage in which the black man is the individual among an interracial society." he said. 
··However. racism often in­terferes with this process. Next there is the pro-black stage. Yet this does not imply an anti-white belief." 
·'Then a black man reaches a black authenticity stage," he continued. "This means struggling for a cause and using intelligence to work for black people. Marcus <;arvey once said, 'Men can't build for others, they must build for themselves.' This is what black people must do." 
Williams emphasized the im­portance that blacks develop a spirit of "Afrocentricity" -the development of a black outlook on life. 
"I think black people have to take a stand on things as they relate to their heritage," he stated. "Black people must be ac­countable to their own people." 
Williams stressed the need that children be taught to control their fate. "Carlegy Woodson once said, ·If you lead someone to certain fallacies, you don't have to worry about what he thinks.' This is why some of the best minds are in prison," he said.

However, the instructors are usually close to their own students, O'Driscoll added. 
Drill 
The requirement of one hour of drill per week is considered a necessity by some and labeled "useless" by others. Melnyk said that other forms of leadership training have been considered, but drill is the only activity suited to leadership training. He noted that team sports were considered as a second semester replacement for drill, hut that was rejected as being inadequate. 
"Drill gives you command ex­perience and the ability to take orders without thinking," Melnyk said. The ability to take orders without thinking may, in some situations, save the officer's life in the future, he pointed uut. 
It is impossible for a mid­
shipman to go through the ROTC 
program and not be a drill leader 
at some point, Melnym said. 
Other students disagreed. "Ask 
anyone who's not a platoon 
leader," one said. "All it is is 
putting, on a unihrm for an hour 
and walking arou11d in circles." 
A senior noted that neither 
1\>klnyk. nor his executive officer, 
Mark Gibson, had ever been a

l'ntJaration for Navy lift 
Thr NHOTC program is not like 
the regular Navy. Melnyk doesn't 
sec this to be a problem. Others 
disagree. 
"Ideally this is what the Navy 
should be,'' Melnyk said. The Navy 
is not like NHOTC, Melnyk said, 
because of the duties required of a 
Navy officer. "In my case I'm 
going into destroyers," the 
battalion commander stated. 
"They'll put me onto a twenty­
year-old or thirty-year-old 
destroyer and the mere task of 
keeping the thing running 
precludes any other activity." 
()'Driscoll said that NROTC 
students see only the bright side of 
the Navy. He remarked that the 
instructors at Notre Dame are some of the best in the service and that the summer cruises are designed to give the students a good impression of the Navy. 
"You don't see the problems," he said. "My ship had the best rating in the Atlantic fleet, but still there were drug problems, racial problems, and theft. You have to talk to as many people as possible on the cruise and find out what the Navy is really like." 
One student said that from what he's seen on the summer cruises "the Navy isn't as bad as this place." Another said, "From what I've seen of the real Navy, I'm disillusioned by what I see here. It gives you no idea of what the Navy is about." 
Bene£its 
The biggest benefit of Navy HOTC is the money. The govern­ment pays all of the tuition, fees, hooks, and laboratory expenses of scholarship students. The scholarship students also receive $100 dollars per month for up to forty months as a "subsistence allowance." Non-scholarship students receive $100 dollars per month during their junior and senior year. 
The summer cruises provide an opportunity for the students to travel. ()'Driscoll said his cruise was in the Bahamas and he said he "had a great time." 
The midshipmen participate in a number of other activities, ac­cording to NROTC literature. The midshipmen sell programs bdore the home football games, par­ticipated in the bike-a-thon to raise money for retarded children last year, and assist in Veterans D~y celebrations of It cal Tganizations.

Keenan tops Pangborn for IH title
1.. 
By Ray O'Brien 
Keenan crushed Pangborn Sunday afteroon 22-0 to take the Interhall Football Championships. It was the first time a North Quad team has won it in over five years. 
Keenan's awesome defense established itself from the first set of plays. Unable to cross the line of scrimmage in their first three plays, Pangborn was forced to punt. A strong Keenan rush partially blocked the punt and gave the Keenan offense good field position at their own 44 yard line. 
Pangborn's "Violence Defense" also held in their first test. Joe Kern punted the ball43 yards to the Pangborn 8 yard line where Pangborn fumbled. Keenan's Greg Wilkes dove on the ball setting uo Keenan's first scoring opportunity: The Keenan offense took advantage as quaterback John Feeney tossed a 6 yard pass fo split end Nick Molinaro for the opening score. 
Pangborn gave the ball right back on their next play as fullback 
..... 
Steve Thomas fumbled and linebacker Pat Concannon recovered at Pangborn's 31 yard line. 
Keenan behind the power run­ning of Pinky Faherty and Joe Kern, along with some costly Pangborn penalties took it the distance. Faherty hulled his way up the middle for the finalt three yards and the touchdown. Feeney then flipped to Faherty in the end zone for the 2 point conversion. This ended the first quarter and seemed to put the final blow on 
Pangborn who just couldn't recover. 
Pangborn had a chance to get back into the game when a Feeney pass was intercepted and returned to the 7 yard line. It was straight backwards from there as the Keenan defense threw ' them back 24 yards in the next three plays to the 31 yard line. Kicking specialist Tom Holroyd just missed a 49 yard field goal attempt as it sailed slightly to the left. Keenan took over and ran out the 
clock to end the first half.

played well throughout the first half. Costly fumbles and penalties just put them. in a very bad position. The Pangborn defense was on1he field for a long time as Keenan's ball control offense ate up the clock. 
Punter Joe Kern pinned Pangborn deep in their own territory the whole game with his booming punts. It was a tremendous Kern punt of 51 yards into the wind that led to Keenan's fourth quarter touchdown. The ball landed on Pangborn's 7 yard line and tolled to the two yard line. Two plays later Keenan's defense coughed up the ball as Pat Con­cannon recovered his second fumble of the game. Kern then dove in from the 1 yard line to add to his heroic performance. Pinky Faherty, who carried the ball over twenty times on the day, scored the two point conversion to finish the scoring in the game as Keenan triumphed 22-0. 
Pangborn played tough as they held in there to the final second. Linebacker Gary Hankemer was a bright spot for Pangborn as he held together the "Violence Defense." Pangborn coach Jeff Jeffers was proud of his team as he stated: "We didn't play a bad game, we just played a better team. Keenan played by far the best game anyinterhall team ever played that I have seen." 
The Keenan defense really owned the game. The fearsome fivesome consisting of Don Biship, Bill Jacobitz, Lou Drago, Paul Riordan, and captain AI Sondej buried anything that came their way. Pangborn's offense was held to an amazing minus 2 yards in 26 carries. AI Sondej attributed the 

There are two things which haunt every athlete --injuries and slumps. Defensive tackle Jeff Weston's problems are in the latter area. 
"It's normal for any kid to get 
down on himself when things 
aren't going well," defensive line 
coach Joe Yonto explains. 
The 6-4, 255 pound Rochester, N.Y., native certainly agrees with his coach! on that point. "I wasn't playing aggressively," the sophomore admits. "I wasn't getting off the ball. I was standing up and reading too much. You can't afford to do that as a defensive lineman." 
Weston certainly didn't do that against Navy. In most cases, the breakout! from a slump is gradual. Weston's was explosive.
"He did an excellent job," sidekick Steve Niehaus says. "He was in on all those tackles (22), sacked their runners twice, had a fumble recovery. The interception <53 yards for a touchdown) was just icing on the cake." 
And something neither Navy nor 
Weston every expected. "It's 
something you dream about," 
Weston continues, "but you never 
think, it will come true." 
But it did. "When he (Navy 
punter Steve Dykes l dropped his 
hand back," Weston reflects, 
"everyone was yelling that it was 11 
fake punt. I dropped back into the 
middle when I saw Steve, Tom 
<Lopienskil and Ross <Browner) get to him. He threw the ball and fortunately I was in the right place." 
"My first thought was to run," he continues. "I wasn't even thinking about a touchdown until I saw the endzone wide open. Then I put the jets on. The guys were all kidding me during Sunday's film hour. Niehaus was saying, 'Look at the Juice go."· 
Strength has never been a problem for Jeff Weston, although there was some question before this season about his weight. 
"Last year I played around! 248," Weston reflects. "This summer I got up to 280 by lifting and eating. Maybe it was natural growth. I reported at 265, and when Coach Devine saw me, he told me to lose more weight." 
But an achilles tendon injury didn't make that task any easier. Still Weston was ready when the Irish opened at Boston College, but his play wasn't what Yonto had expected. 
"He was doing a lot of little things wrong," Yonto adds. "His strenghth has always been fine, but he had to utilize his quickness and .strength when following through with his blows. He had to work on them." 
And while Weston worked, op­posing teams worked--away from Niehaus(· and Browner and at Weston and Willie Fry. 
"Coach Yonto told Willie and me 
that teams would naturally come
