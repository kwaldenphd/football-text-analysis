KEVIN DALUM!The Observer Saint Mary's freshman Nicole Hastings, a LeMans Hall resident, puts her best face forward for her new student ID card. Getting an ID is just one of the many rites of passage which freshmen at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's will make this weekend.

• New freshmen help SMC boost enrollment 
By NOREEN GILLESPIE Saint Mary's Editor 
Four-hundrncl and thirty first­year students climbed the stair­cases to their dorm rooms armed with heavy boxes, clum­sy loft pieces and high expecta­tions for the nnxt four years. 
And as tiach step brought them closnr to realizing those expectations, 1~ach of' those 430 frr.shmen is helping Saint Mary's reach an expectation ol' its own -that of higher enroll­ment. 
The 47:~ incoming studnnL-. ­including 43 transl'Prs ­exclwded tlw Collng(1 's goal of 415 rnirollnd lirst-ymtr studm1ts. 
It's an accomplishnwnt lhal Mary Pat Nolan, director of admissions, is !!Xcited about. 
"WP want to hav11 1750 stu­d!'nts enrolled by the year 200:i," Nolan said. "As l'ar as incoming students are ron­n•nwct, WI' am right on targPt lo reach that goal."

r Bubble boys [ 

and girls 

I didn't go to Notre Dame football games as an infant. and my booties weren't cmhroidernd v.ith the interlocking "ND." 
In fact, I first camt-1 to Notre l)ame tu visit friends from high school. All I knew about the University was that Chicago-based United Limo bus servico had a stop hern. 
That weekend in February 1995, I quickly asccrtainnd Notrn Dame is an independent little vil­lage. One can study, cat, sleP.p, worship, wnrk. party and play. It's like Disneyland or the Biosphere: all of lifo's necessities in one giant bubble. 
When l deddrd to attend tlie L:niversity, the safety ol' Notrn Damr's campus , ,~ased my parents' separation worries a bit. I would live in a dorm where doors remain lock.Pd 24 hours and whPre a dozl'n trainod staff members are on hand to solve problems. 
1had e-mail. Internet access. a long-distance calling plan and a post otlice within walking distance. My bank was in the student center. National and world news came through cable stations in my dorm. and a new jacket came from J. Crew's mail order catalog. 
For quite a while. I believed Notre Dame had it all. Venturing off campus would mean public transportation and getting lost in an unfamiliar town. It would n~quire cash. not just an ID card with a student account. And it would mean con­fronting "townies" -those folks who live. work and raise their families in neighborhoods of South Bend and Mishawaka. 
But as Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents, we are not just residents of our individ­uar schools. We live in the Midwest. near a city with rich history of industry and community. We are part of northern Indiana. 
The world ouL'iide the University and College bubbles offers great racial. ethnic and religious diversity -something both schools' adminis­trations have admittnd is lacking. It holds myri­ad service opportunities and chances to form relationships with those not blessed with the linancial or emotional security most students enjoy. 
Outside campus boundaries, cultural options broaden to include more than major motion pictures on video: South Bend has galleries and jazz clubs, and Chicago's big-city flair is just a fow hours away. The two schools offer dillerent class options. and many students take advan­tage of co-exchange programs to expand their classroom knowledge. 
or coursP, tlm Notre Dame~ and Saint Mary's campuses have rich traditions and offer much. The gathering of minds from every state and from scores ofcountries cannot be matched. The college experience, however. does not begin and end at campus gates. 
Four years of learning, leeling, succeeding and failing lie ahead. While many experiences will take place in dorms, in classrooms and on sporl<; fields. remember the world continues outside the boundaries of campus. In a few weeks. freshmPn will have the daily grind under their belts. Wait for a sunny Saturday. Then grab some friends, get out and explore thH rest of this community. 
Tlrnre's only so much room to grow inside a bubble.

News department guidelines, policies 
Observer Staff Report 
The Observer is a daily. student­run newspaper serving both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. The Observer npws department uses the following guidelines in its news gathering process: 
The Observer news department strives to report on all campus and local events that affect both cam­puses and the surrounding arPa. In addition to the local news, The Observer uses Associated Press sto­ries and graphics to keep readers informed about national and world events. 
As stated in our editorial policy, ,;The Observer news is reported as accurately and objectively as possi­ble." 
We realize that the department is comprised ol' arnateur journalists. yet we strive to conduct ourselves as professionals at all times. 
Story ideas come largely from Notre Dame's department of Public Helations and lnf'orma-tion. We also

generate our own ideas from adver­tisements in The Observer. other publications, and campus posters. 
A final and important source of story ideas 1s thP mc~mbers of the ND/SMC commu_nity who call. write or e-mail The Observer staff regard­ing events they are planning. We encourage groups to contact us at least one week in advance with details regarding their events. 
As a rule, we do not run previews of lectures that we are planning to cover. We simply do not have the staff or spacP to run previews ol' every campus lecture. Exceptions lo this rule may be made if a lecture is to be given by a speaker of national or international prominence. 
We suggest, however, that in this case the sponsoring group fill out an "Of' Interest" form at The

With certain twents, we only run previews. For instant:!), if a group is sponsoring a career day or an off­campus event, we might simply run a stoTy on the details of the f'uturn nv1rnl. We will also run previews if' it is not feasible to have a reporter cover or attend the event.

Two additions that wen-i not in the 1879 blueprints are the central air conditioning system and two elt'vators. Tho building had no elfwators prior lo th11 renovatio1i and will now com­ply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Lyphout said. 
Staff'Prs b<'gan moving into the building .July 1 and had completed the transition bv the end of that month. \!lost o'r the renovation was Jinished by the .July dnadlilH'. but workPrs arc slill completing interior decora­tions and installing locks. This work will be done by the end of August, Lyphout said. 
Universitv staffers in the rnfurbishod building are gener­ally pleased with I.heir new sur­roundings. 
"I think they're incredible," said Jeanne Kline. a receptionist in the office of University !{elations. "I think all of us who work here have been pleasantly surprised." 
Klinfl, who also worked in the building before tho renoYations began, noted the impruvemenl. 
"Before it was just dark and dreary, and you realized that it was an historic building, but I found it hard to console myself with that." slw said. "Now it's bright, cheery. It's just a plea­sure to walk in lrnre every morning." 
Sherry Lillie, who works in the cashier's ollice on the first floor. agrees. 
"!l's gorgeous," she said "Way past my expectations of what they could do with llw renova­tion. It's a very nice atmosphere lo work in." 
The project expanded office work spaces and many offices received new equipment. However. there are fewer people working in the Main Building thah there worn in 1997. 
When it closed, the Main Building housed approximately 450 staffers and administrators. Now that number is down to

offices moved l'rom the Main Building into newly-converted Grace Hall in 1997. Some of those offices, including Undergraduate Admissions and the Hcgistrar. returned to their placHs under the Dome, but oth­ers remain in Grace. Approximately 10 percent of available space was lost in the renovation, but the building still has 150,000 square feet, said Lyphout. 
The Main Building also will house classrooms, as it uriginal­1y did, and some conference rooms. 
Another addition is a "Wall of Honor," located on the first lloi>r. The wall names 20 indi­viduals, including Father Edward Sorin. founder of the University, and trustee Donald Keough. According to the plaque, those honored arc "exceptional men and women whose contributions to Notre Dame an~ lasting, pervasive and profound." 
There will be a dedication cer­emony for the renovated build­ing Monday at 5:15 p.m.

STUDENT ACADEMIC COUNCIL 
The Sludent Academic Council includes one rnpresentativ(l from nach dcpartmont, and, according lo student body vice president Angin Litll<i. is the only organization that touches every woman at Saint Mary's. 
"Basically, our overriding goal this year is to create a mission s~atnment, because we feel very strongly that every woman at SMC is actually a member of SAC," said Little, who serves as chairwoman of the council. 
The lirst SAC event_of the year will build on that theme. The l,)Vnnl, sclwd­ulcd for Sept. 5, includes pizza and skits f'or lirst-yoar students. hostml by the various boards on campus.

SAC is also in the midst of planning a Lime capsule for Saint Mary's Pride Wenk, as well as a proposed "re-entry" program for studPnts rclurning from a semester or year abroad. 
RESIDENCE HALL ASSOCIATION 
The Hesidence Hall Association functions under the auspicns of tlrn Board of Governance and acts as the programming body rnsponsibln for issues con­cerning hall life. I!oly Cross llall resident Hose Lutzka will snrve as prnsidnnt of Hl!A this year. 
The Association aims to increase participation in hall events and to pro­mote interhall events. HI IA is also responsible for planning such campus­wide l'unrtions as the all-campus formal, as well as tlrn big sistnr program. 
STUDENT ACTIVITIES BOARD 
Tlw l'our1.h prong of Saint Mary's stuclnnt government is tho Student .'\clivity Board. which handlns the programming for most l:ampus-wide nvcnts. In addition to !'uncling, SAB must also plan and promotn events, such n.s S\i!CTostal and tho .Jamaica Shaka, and the numerous co11c(1rts and spnak­(irs.

Qum,om ,eg,,rding Ob,er11er polide, should be dim,­.ed to Edztor in GnefMzchelte Kmpa. 
What they forgot to tell you during Freshmen 0 
Over the next few days you, the class of 2003, will be sub­jected to all forms of advicP. You will have rape awanmess presentations and prejudice reduction workshops. .You will meet with your rectors, assistant. rectors and nisident assis­tants. Some of you already have met with or will soon meet with advisors in the Freshman Year of Studifls. 
You will also be told of lhe great tradi­tion of Notrn Dame and how ynu will receive a top-notch education. They will list for you all of the Trustees and other important alumni that make more in a month than thn Gross National Product. 
This is all true. But, what follows is not nearly so snrious. It simply exists as my advic,1 to vou. Student lire at l\otre Dame can be a war for survival. This advice ­almost all or which comes from my own personal experience -will help you in that fight. Let this servP as a 11\'arning from a now gracluated. one-time five-year student who, through much practice, knows exactly what NOT to do. So, strap on your battle helmets and follow me. 
First, do not underestimate the power of the dining hall food. If you do, it will conquer you. 
After you have exhausted every possible combination of grill, ltalian, taco or whatever happens to be the mal du jour you will begin to realize how everything really tastes the same and how, oddly, none ofit tastes like chicken. 
There is a reason that they dim the lights during the candle­light buffet -Saturday night after a home football game ­and it is not for ambiance. You thought "The Blair Witch Project" was scary and hard to watch'? Just try to see what you are eating. 
Occasionally, Food Services will try to spice things up by handing out Twinkies and dressing dining hall workers like clowns. But do not be fooled by the carnival 


dump truck full of massive books that cost you thrcH pints of blood and allegiance to the Dark Sidi~. I have seen it happPn. Fourth, do not cross the stadium ushers. They are not depu­tized agents of thP. law. but they think they are. 
If you try to keep a football that has somehow strayed into tlrn stands, they will hunt you down and wrest the pigskin from your dPad hands if' nr!ed br'. Thes1• guys arn not kidding -and neither am I. 
You am, for the most part, underage and WI' all know how good I\Jotrc Danrn students arP about underage drinking, so I KNOW that you won't be drinking bt,forn or aftnr the game. But just for future n1forence, don't bring anything to drink into the stadium. I don't earn how thick your coat is or how many pockets it has. They have guys that patrol the press box with binoculars -watching you. ll'you think I am joking, look over at lvla.lloy's box <luring the Kansas game. You'll sne the guy. 
Fifth. be carnful what advice you takn from seniors in your dorm. Most of'them will nol go to many classes. :vly HA posted his four-class-a-week sd1edule on tlrn bulletin board as proof of his lif'estyle. Trust mn on this one; you do not want to fall into the trap of constantly sleeping through classns. It is a hard habit to bnmk -one that might get you a lilU1 ytmr and a sub­
3.0 GPA. Sixth, a few randiim sell~explanatory points: Do not run naked around campus unless you am wearing 
running shoes·and are in good enough shape to finish your trip without stopping in the bushes to hide from the Campus Ser.urity. Trust me. 
Do not drink a half bottlP of .Jack Daniel's unless you need a visual aide in trying to rcmnmber what you ate l'or every meal since 1990. 
Do not treat ex-girlfriends or ex-boyfriends too badly. This is a small campus -you may end up sitting in front nf them in Spanish class. 
Finally, and most importantly, do not take yourself too seri­ously. No one will like you and they will all talk about you behind your back. 
I hope that some of these things will help 
atmosphere. This food is no more fun the you to prepare for the battle to come.
Now for the one real,

Second, do not EVER utter the sentence, "The weather up here isn't that bad." 
The Weather can hear you and will punish you for your insolence. · The Weather in South Bend, while right now a soothing 168 degrees with a heat index of 330 degrees, will very quickly turn into your worst enemy and the bane of your existence. The first days that the clouds roll over the sky will feel like a welcome fall shower. But when you wake up to the 77th day of a sunless existence and look out your window to see the snow ­piled up over the roof of the library and then you realize that the temperature has fallen below that of the dark side of the ­moon -you will be sorry that you angered The Weather. 
(Note: Just avoiding comments about The Weather will not necessarily prevent the apoc;alypse of winter, but it couldn't hurt.) 
This is a fight that you cannot win. I don't care how close you are with Father Hesburgh. No one turns off the South Bend snow machine. Th£, best that you can do is to hole up in your dorm room where the heater keeps everything at a balmy 451 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Third, do not venture too often into the Bookstore. It will take your soul, if they don't have a lien on it already. 
Sure, the new building is pretty and spacious. But the prices still put your biology and math books on level with the pur­chase price for the Washington Redskins.

Notrn Dame." If vou don't learn any of the 
rest of this song:yc)U better know this line so that you can shout it at the top of your lungs af'tnr having mumbled-murmured over th11 rest. 
Now for the om~ rnal, serious piece of advice. This school will only give you what you put into it. If you spend all your time studying and reading and going to classns, you will !nave with a solid 4.0 and no social skills. If you spfmd all your tinw in extracurricular activities and hanging out, you will leave beforr, you graduate. You have to !ind a balancn between a few good clubs or sports that interest you and actually making it to class to survive this war. 
Notre Dame is an exp1wience in and or itself. To get it, you have to really immerse yourself in what's going on around you. Not a hard thing to do without a car to get off campus.

Eldred explains College Master Plan 
To those of' you who urn new students ­welcome' And to those of you who are rnturn­ing to Saint Mary's and Notrn f>anw -wel­come back to the start of' a new academic y11ar. Fall is always a time of great excitement on our campus, but this year is spncial in many ways. 
Saint Mary's College has much to celebrate as we begin tlw 1999-2000 school year. W1! am wnlcoming 430 women as lirs11-ynar stuclnnts, making the Class of 2003 ono of' the College's largest in recnnt yPars. Our incoming lirst-y,iar students arc remarkable not only in quantity. but in quality. Among them are a significant number of high school valedictorians, and the high school GPAs and SAT scorns of' this group arn even higher than those of their prmlecns­sors. 
Heturning students to Saint Mary's. will note some positive changes on campus. They'll find renovations in many residence halls and impor­tant upgrades in classroom technology. Among the most exciting improvements is the new Trumper Computer Cluster, now available for student use in the Cushwa-Leighton Library. 
Perhaps most significantly, over tlw sumnrnr our Board or Trustees approved the Saint Mary's College Mastnr Plan. Thn Plan is a bold outline l'or campus expansion and renovation that will perpntuate the beauty ol' our campus while adding much-needed tnaching, meeting and social space. Our students participatnd actively in the conception of the Plan, and both current and l'titure students will benefit from its implementation over the next several years. 
As I begin my third year as Prnsident ol' Saint Mary's College, I am struck more than ever by the energy, spirit and intelligence of the women we servo here. I wish all of you the very best as you embark on this phase ol' your academic career!

Observer Staff Report 

Junior breaststroker Dan Szilior represented the United States this summer at the World University'Games in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. 
Szilier, the 1999 Big East 200-meter breaststroke cham­pion, finished ninth in the 200 with a time of 2:18:88. He pl,tced ju'st five one-hun­dredths of a second behind eighth place l'inisher and fel­low American Barry Wynn, 
"I think I did well consider­ing it was my first internation­al meet," Szilier said, "I would have liked to have gone faster but I ended up finishing in the same place that I was seed­ed." 
With the event scheduled for 
Americans had an extra incentive to succeed. 
"[Competing on July 41 was a lot of fun," he said. "We has a lot of extra energy in our team area that day." 
Szilier became the lirst Irish men's swimmer to qualify for a nalional team when he placed seventh at the Phillips 66 National Championships in the summer of 1998. 
Representing the U.S, was an exciting experience, Szilier said. 
. "When you are representing the U.S,, it's a whole different feeling," he said. "When I got over here, everybody was try­ing to gel close to the U.S. ath­letes. There is just a whole lot more spirit surrounding rep­resenting the United Statns."

With tlrn departure of s1won starters from last year's <J-(,-:1 men's soc{'.lff team. /wad coach Mike Bcrticclli rcaliz1~s Im and his staff have their work cut out for them this l'all. 
"This smtson prnscnts a par­ticular challnnge Lo us bncausn it will rnquirn a rnst.ructuring ol' our team," said Borticelli, rPturning l'or his 10th snason as head coach. "We've only bn1m out a couple or days, but I.his is going to be a challonging pre­scason." 
Restructuring b1\gins wit.h try­ing to replace last year's !muling scornr, Shane Walton. Walton, a second-tnam all-Big East snlec­tion and Big East all-rookie team member, accnpted a schol­arship to play football for tlrn Irish. 
His 10 goals and seven assists from last year will be missed by the Irish front line. 
"It's always tough to losn your leading scorer, especially since he had three years left," Berticelli said. "It's a giant loss and will be dil1icult to overcome, so we need our current players to step up and Iii! that void." 
Senior forward Hyan Cox, who started all 18 games last year, hopes to pick up where he lef't off last season. Cox, who had five goals and a team-high eight assists, will team with follow seniors Andrew Aris and Jason Jorski to add experience up front. 
Experience, however, is lack­ing in the midfield. Junior Connor LaRose is the only mid­fielder to have started all 18 games. 
Senior Malt McNew will anchor the defense again this season. The second-team all-Big East selection started at swnnp­er for thnw seasons. 
Competition is fierce in prac­tice as younger players vie for playing time\ and look lo sncurn starting roles f'or tlw Irish. 
"Practic1i has lrnnn extrn111nly compHtitivn and thn coaching staff is approaching it open­mindcct," B1-•rt.icelli said. "Hight now, nu p!ayHr has a lock on any position and all tlrn play(irs arn awarn of' that. It has lmtm posi­tive so far and our practicns have b11011 high-spiritml."
