In Brief 
The St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office is reviewing police reports to determine what, if any, charges to file against the Notre Dame junior arrested after his car hit a South Bend man on Nov.15, according to Michael Barnes of the Prosecutor's Office. Barnes said his office received the reports last week and expects to make a decision on the charges later this week. The student was arrested for driving while intoxicated and driving with an expired oper­ator's license. The South Bend man later died of severe head injuries suffered in the accident. -The Observer

Athletes who turn to God show brighter side of life 
Getting away from Notre Dame over Thanks­giving break meant more than seeing friends, watching football and eating turkey. It meant answering some questions about sports and life, for the two often go hand in hand in the hearts of a number of people. 
Getting away meant taking a look at the sports section of a local newspaper and seeing the headlines splattered with ink about drug scandals, illegal recruiting, point shaving and just about every other crime imaginable. 
But isn't there a brighter side to sports that never seems to find its way to the top of those sports pages? And, while we're at it, isn't there a brighter side to life that remains in the back­ground all too often--even at a Catholic Univer­sity like Notre Dame? 
I'm talking about life as a Christian, and giving God a chance to shine His light on the playing field as well as on the campus. Granted, there are too many drug addicts and head­hunters in the ranks of professional, college and unfortunately even high school athletics, but there are some good guys as well. 
Here's to the good guys! 
"I once thought that being successful in life meant climbing to the top of your ladder,'' said Dallas Cowboys head coach Tom Landry at a bible camp in upstate New York last summer. "I climbed that ladder until it led me to a coach­ing job in Dallas, and I thought that would make me happy. 
"But my life was still empty. I know now that you don't have to climb. Life is a matter of priority. Before I accepted the Lord into my life and learned to put my family second to God, football used to be number one with me. Now football is the third priority." 
And Landry is by no means the only one in the sporting world with his priorities straight. More and more athletes are banning together to &how there are more important things than wins, losses and the corruption that often ac­companies fame and fortune. One of the more popular of these groups is the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, headed up in 1954 when an idea by Oklahoma playelicoach Don McClanen was adopted into a set of bylaws. 
FCA allows athletes to join together in prayer and worship in an effort to combat the problems of life in the limelight. But, unfortunately for the college student, the limelight is not the only haven for problems. 
Final exams, and believe me when I say I did not mean to bring this up, are less than two weeks away. Those are enough, but add the million other pressures of college and you get an understanding of how rough life can get. 

We can take a lesson from the athletes -or at least the good guys in sports. Sure it's pos­sible to survive college without giving a thought to God, but taking the time to set one's priorities straight can make that rocky road to success a much smoother one. 
Besides regular masses, the Grotto, and per­sonal prayer, Notre Dame also has a group of students (not necessarily athletes) who ban to­gether for a little extra help in trying times, in the tradition of FCA. Sophomore Andrew Shan­non heads the campus branch of FCA, which meets once every couple of weeks in Stanford Hall. 
So you can go that extra mile, in sports and in life, even in a college setting. 
"You don't have a good football team unless they're drilled in the fundamentals like block­ing and tackling," Landry said. "That's how it is off the field as well. You've got to have a solid foundation, and I find my strength in God." 
Amen.

Desi Arnaz dead at 69 
Associated Press 
HOLLYWOOD -Desi Arnaz, the Cuban-born singer­bandleader beloved by genera­tions of TV viewers as Lucille Ball's harassed husband Ricky Ricardo on the "I love Lucy"· show, died of lung cancer Tues­day. He was 69. 
Arnaz, who was married to Miss Ball for 20 years before their divorce in 1960 and be­came one of television's most successful producers, died at his Del Mar home in San Diego County just after midnight. Daughter Lucie Arnaz Luckin­bill was at his side, reading prayers, publicist Charlie Pomerantz said. 
"He was the father of my children and we were always friends, always very friendly and close," Miss Ball said. "I was down there last week. We've talked all the time, through the years. Lucy, our daughter, was with him. He died in her arms last night." 
"(We are) very elated that he's out of his misery. He suf­fered a lot. We have prayed for his being free of pain." 
Dr. Charles Campbell of San Diego, Arnaz' physician, said his patient had been ill for about a year. 
"He died of lung cancer. It was from smoking those Cuban cigars; that's the truth," Campbell said. 
"I love Lucy," which Arnaz produced and which also starred William Frawley and Vivian Vance as the Ricardos' neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz, was one of television's most successful and longest running shows. 
When Miss Ball became pregnant with the couple's son, Desi Arnaz Jr., the entire na­tion followed her progress, and "Little Ricky" was born in an episode televised the same day that Miss Ball actually gave birth. 
Original episodes of the show appeared from 1951 and 1961 and it's been seen in reruns around the world ever since. 
Arnaz's Cuban accent and fractured English were con­stant sources of laughter on "I love Lucy" and an occasional target of gibes from his wife. His Latin temper often flared at her antics on the show and he would fire off a burst of non­stop Spanish. Occasionally he would perform a song, com­plete with conga drums, such as his trademark number, "Ba­ba-loo."

Apartheid foes want children let go 
Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -Anti-apartheid leaders on Tuesday said the govern­ment's mass detention of children was obscene and demanded the immediate release of an estimated 1,300 to 1,800 youths in custody. 
The government, mean­while, banned Azhar Cachalia, treasurer of the United Demo­cratic Front, from promoting the nationwide anti-apartheid coalition. Cachalia is the front's only executive commit­tee member not in jail or in hiding. 
The government also re­ported that a prominent black physician and his wife, Fabian

Author Nadine Gordimer, Parliament member Helen Suzman, Anglican Bishop Simeon Nkoane and Sheena Duncan, past president of the Black Sash anti-apartheid or­ganization, were among about 200 people who met and demanded the release of detained children. 
''The detention of a child without trial and in an adult jail is an obscenity," the Rev. Peter Storey, former president of the Methodist Church of South Africa, told the meeting. 
"It is an offense to God and the deepest shame we have had

to live with as citizens of this country," he said. 
Monitoring groups estimate that more than 20,000 people have been detained for varying periods since a state of emer­gency was imposed last .June 
12. Mrs. Duncan said the Black Sash estimates that 1,300 to 1,800 youths under 18 remain in detention, including some as young as 11. 
"No one is going to pretend that all those who are under 18 and who have been detained are angels," Mrs. Duncan said. "But civilized countries do not detain any person without trial. Civilized countries do not, ever, put children in prison." 
She added, "There is more official concern in this country about cruelty to animals than there is about cruelty to children." 
By a show of hands, those at the meeting supported a state­ment addressed to President 
P.W. Botha and Law and Order Minister Adrian Vlok which ended, "We demand: free our children." 
Vlok, who took office Mon­day, told journalists Tuesday that black boycotts of white­owned businesses, being organ­ized by activists in time for Christmas, were illegal. 
Asked if the organizers "had better watch out," he replied: "you couldn't have put it bet­ter."

Music: it can lift you up, it can calm your nerves. It can make a party great and it can get your dancing feet bop­ping. You can have a favorite song whose lyrics are special or which is memorable of a time that has passed. A couple often shares "their song" which was from that first dance or was playing when they met. Groups share theme songs also. Whether it be like the Notre Dame Victory March, or the song you go crazy to when it hits the radio, the members of a group relate to the music and the lyrics.

When someone asks me if I play any instruments, I have to steal a line from a friend and reply that "I play the stereo." Of course I sing along all the time (much to the chagrin of my friends' ears) and I grab that air guitar or saxophone or drums when I can't control myself any longer. 
Music makes me feel good. It touches a part of me and makes me feel alive. My heart begins beating quicker and my adrenalin pumps as I pick up the rhythm. I feel the high notes lift me up and the low notes take me down, down, down. I picture the musician and can feel his fingers on the ivory keys, his 
Doonesbury 
arms pumping the drums, his vocal chords vibrating with each note. 
Tipper Gore and her crusade to cen­sor certain songs have been making the news in the past year or two. I agree with her in that there are some songs with absolutely atrocious lyrics. However, I think censorship is out of the question. It is an outright hypocriti­cal action in this land of the free: freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of the people. It would also limit the production of some truly great songs if the artists thought they would be censored and forbidden. 
There are innumerable songs which are outstanding lyrically and are clas­sics. People turn to many different sources for comfort, hope and inspira­tion: books, places, poems, prayers, and songs. Lyrics of songs are symbolic and straightforward; they are illusion­ary and intense; they ask questions and inspire answers. 
So, the next time you are down, the next time you are in a great mood, turn on the radio or pop in a tape and see how it affects you. I am not promising a cure for your blues or an even higher high than you have. I think, though, the tunes will enhance your mood and make you really feel those feelings. You will be more in tune with you. 
Mary Berger is a sophomore studying in Angers, France. 
Reagan's foreign policy shows lack of planning 
Ronald Reagan is going to be remem­bered for a lot. Many will look back admiringly on his many achievements of the past eight years: stimulating the economy with a historic tax cut, res­toring America's defensive stature around the world, simplifying greatly our complex tax laws, and, most of all, making America feel good about itself

again. Yes, Reagan has done much good. Yet we cannot just gloss over his entire presidency with such rosy colors, for Reagan has erred-and erred quite seriously -on a number of issues. Most damaging of all, I believe, has been Reagan's performance in foreign policy -a performance which must be reversed to avoid permanent damage to America. 
What has Reagan done that has been so terrible? A look at his foreign policy ventures of just the past year reveals a disturbing and dangerous trend in American actions. In Nicaragua the President sought out and won $100 mil­lion in covert aid to support a rebel movement trying to overthrow the San­dinista government. In Libya he retaliated against an unwanted govern­ment by launching an air strike against the country. Later, he approved and oversaw a "disinformation" campaign against Khaddafi, an action which amounts to nothing more than lying. And in Iran, Reagan decided to engage on a secret campaign of appeasement toward "moderates" in that country while simultaneously preaching to the rest of the world not to engage in such activity. What's the problem? 
The flaw in such actions is that they lack any general direction. Herein lies the basic problem which has marred American foreign policy over the past few years and which threatens to reduce our role in international affairs. America has not been able to reach a consensus and define clearly its long term goals in foreign affairs. Instead of thinking in terms of years, we think only in terms of days. It is only the here and now which concern us. 
As a result, our actions are often sporadic and hastily undertaken. Our actions convey to the world not a sense

of power and solidarity but rather a sense of confusion and uneasiness. Dis­information campaigns and secret negotiations are policies undertaken by a government groping for direction. It seems to me that the United States should simply not have to resort to such questionable actions. A more clearly thought out foreign policy would, I think, avoid the need for lying. 
Naturally, the question then becomes what foreign policy should the United States adopt. Believe me, as a college freshman I do not know what policies would best serve our country. But I do know it would be in our interests to step back and analyze where exactly it is we want to go. Goals must be more clearly defined. Limits must be more clearly drawn. Our foreign policy today seems to be full of rhetoric and lofty 
ideals but lacking in definite courses of action. 
To its credit, the Soviet Union today seems to more clearly understand where it is going. The Kremlin has pon­dered its situation and acts with much more decisiveness. 
Take Afghanistan, for example. Despite the outcry their actions have effected, the Soviets remain in the country. Why? The Kremlin has decided it is in their interests to inter­vene there. To speak Reagan's lan­guage, they stick to their guns. We prefer jumping on our horse and run­ning from posse to posse. 
Like it or not, we in the United States must act as leaders of the free world. Many countries look up to us for guid­ance, but unfortunately, we have not been giving it to them. Our actions have been indecisive and contradictory, seeming to lack some overall direction. 
The President would do well to rectify this situation by defining more clearly not only our goals in international af­fairs, but also the methods we will and will not use to attain these goals. With­out such clear orientation, our position as a world leader will slowly fade away as country after country confusedly turns away, not knowing what to think of America. 
Reagan is leading us down a perilous slope of indecisiveness; we must find a way back up.

MILWAUKEE -Terry Cummings scored 30 points, including 22 in the first half, lifting the Milwaukee Bucks to a 95-88 NBA victory over the Indiana Pacers Tuesday night. 
After Indiana took an early lead, the Bucks pulled ahead 42-41 at the 3:45 mark of the second quarter on a tip-in by Dudley Bradley. 
Milwaukee then went on a 12-4 run, including two three­point goals by Craig Hodges,

gest problem. The Mideast Region has 111 teams, the South has 104, the West has 21 and the Northwest has 28." 
Two western teams, Colorado State and Wyoming, jumped ahead of the Irish to grab the final at-large posi­tions. 
"I've had two coaches call me today already," Lambert explained; "and both of them said, 'You guys would run Wyoming out of the gym.' Well if we get in somebody else could say, 'Well we beat Notre Dame or we beat so-and-so who beat Notre Dame so why aren't we in it?' What I am saying is that, given the structure of the tournament and the way they develop the regions, it's not going to be fair no matter how you do it." 
Bid or no bid, the Notre Dame volleyball team has had its best season ever and already is looking forward to the 1987 season. The Irish will return 10 of 12 players next fall, to lead 54-45 at halftime, and the Pacers never got closer than seven points, the final margin, the rest of the way. 
Turnovers and foul trouble hurt Indiana in the third quarter, as Steve Stipanovich picked up his fourth foul and Wayman Tis­dale and Chuck Person each got their fifth. Tisdale fouled out in the fourth quarter. 
Milwaukee led 80-66 after three periods and used its defense to keep the Pacers from mounting any serious threat in the fourth. 
including all six regular starters. And Lambert has beefed up the Irish schedule for next fall, hoping a few big wins will turn some heads in the vol­leyball world. 
"I thought we had a banner year--a tremendous year," said Lambert. "I think we ac­complished what we set out to do plus a little bit more. But if we do the same thing with next year's schedule, there should be no question we should get an NCAA bid. Next year we are definitely going to be a force to reckon with." 
This season's opponents will argue that Notre Dame was quite a force this year. The Irish set several team records, including most wins in a season 
(33) and longest winning streak (17). 
The addition of freshmen Kathy Cunningham and Taryn Collins, both of whom quickly entered the Irish starting lineup, gave Notre Dame a combination of youth and expe­rience, while sophomores Zanette Bennett and Mary Kay Waller led the Irish offensive attack all season. Bennett's 383 Notre Dame more than occa­sionally. UCLA defeated USC two weeks ago, 45-25. 
The USC-Notre Dame game served as a springboard for Holtz and the whole Irish team, but it was equally damaging to Tollner. The Notre Dame game was supposedly his final ex­amination, and he failed. 
But while this coaching ver­sion of musical chairs seems to have no method to its madness, sometimes what goes around does come around. The leading candidate for the possibly­vacant USC job is none other than poor old Fred Akers. 
kills sparked many Notre Dame rallies, while Waller es­tablished herself as a national leader in two categories. Wal­ler finished the season sixth in the country in kill percentage (.395) and 11th in blocks per game (1.54). 
Lambert also said that fan support, player enthusiasm and the administration's confi­dence in the volleyball pro­gram were key factors in the Irish success this season. 
With a tougher schedule in 1987, Notre Dame certainly will be challenged to be at its best. 
"We've got a tougher schedule next year,'' Lambert said, "but I'm not such a dreamer that I expect to go 33-7 again, because we are playing tougher opponents. If we want to be a nationally-recognized team, however, and a nationally-recognized pro­gram, that is a step." 
With the team Lambert has returning next season, he can afford to take that step toward national prominence for Notre Dame volleyball. 
As Lambert said, "Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

"I just think he knows he's a better ballplayer on the baseline and he wasn't afraid 


Scott Hicks to go after Alford and do the things he has to do," Phelps said. "I think he knows he and Royal have to take charge and fill the gap until Rivers comes back and scores like he will." 
The Irish got another big lift from a big source, 6-10 fresh­man center Scott Paddock. The big red-head used Gary Voce's early foul trouble to assert him­self. Paddock contributed 10 points, mostly on power moves, and garnered seven rebounds. 
Paddock was particularly pleased with his ability to help alleviate the Irish board woes, a problem that has been giving Phelps nightmares so far. 
"Rebounding has been a big concern for us since way back on October 15 when we started practice," he said. "I think Coach Phelps was pleased with the way we rebounded tonight. I think we kept Garrett out of the game pretty well.'' 
Paddock was right on both

rebounding performance, par­ticlularly the way Paddock responded to his demands of the center position. 
"I said, 'Here's your job description: play post defense, rebound and score around the basket on loose balls. Then you can play,' "he said. "Voce had his shot and didn't do it, and Paddock grabbed it." 
Phelps was also quick to comment on assistant coach John Shumate's contribution Paddock's play. 
"That's why Paddock played the way he did,'' he said. "You can credit John Shumate for that." 
The game still goes in the loss column, but last night's contest cleared away the dark cloud that the opening loss had cast on this year's team. With the aggressive play of Paddock possibly a sign of things to come, and continued strong play and leadership from Scott Hicks, things could get a lot brighter.

and hauled down eight rebounds before he was in­jured, but Scott Hicks also pro­vided a big boost. The Irish co­captain, whose playing time had diminished last season, rebounded in a starting role and put together an impressive performance against the team he had followed in his child­hood. 
"I just went into the game knowing it was Indiana and, coming from Indiana, it was a big game for me," the senior said. "I've been watching In­diana games all through my grade-school and high-school 
years,  so  it's  just  a  great  
feeling  to  be  on  the  floor  
against them."  

Hicks finished the game with 18 points, on 8-of-12 shooting from the floor and a pair of free throws. He also added four rebounds and a big steal late in the game that pulled the Irish to within a single point with 39 seconds remaining. 
Phelps said Hicks utilized the parts of his game that are

"I was extremely deter­mined to play. It's my respon­sibility to lead the team on the floor, recognize the defense and call out the offense." 
But while the Hoosier zone limited the Irish, on offense the Hoosiers were, as Dick Vitale would have it, rocking and rol­ling. With Alford outside and Daryl Thomas inside, the Hoosiers twice built leads of 13 in the opening half. 
But with the new 1-3-1 defense and new offensive scheme of getting the ball in­side in the second half, the Irish were able to chip away at In­diana's lead. 
IRISH ITEMS -Donald Royal's second-half injury was diagnosed as a calf tear. He will miss Thursday night's game against Cornell but may be able to return for Saturday's contest against BYU. Royal had 14 points and eight rebounds before suffering the injury with 5 : 30 left in the game. 
DePauw asks for removal of penalty 
Associated Press 
GREENCASTLE, Ind. -The faculty of DePauw University has asked its athletic board to reconsider the school's mem­bership in the National Col­legiate Athletic Association. 
The move follows a three­game suspension ordered by the NCAA for two DePauw bas­ketball players who performed in the movie "Hoosiers." 
At a faculty meeting Monday night, members voted to have the board review whether the NCAA is best serving the needs of women's sports and small colleges like itself, which do not offer athletic scholarships.

Late charge falls short; Hoosiers hold off ND 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
If the Notre Dame basketball team flunked its first test two weeks ago against Western Kentucky, last night's 67-62loss to Indiana showed that the Irish had done some serious study­ing. 
By cutting down on turn­overs, keeping Indiana off the offensive boards and playing a 

... scrappy 1-3-1 zone defense, the Irish were able to cut a 36-24 halftime deficit to 61-60 with 
2:07 left to play. A Steve Al­ford jumper pushed the lead back up to 63-60, but Scott Hicks intercepted a Keith Smart pass and converted the lay up to bring the Irish to within one again, with 39 seconds left. But then Hicks was forced to put Alford on the line with 11 seconds left when the Irish were unable to foul anyone else. The 6-2 all-American calmly swished his ninth­straight free throw and fol­lowed with his lOth after a Notre Dame time out, to give the Hoosiers a cushion. The free throws gave Alford a game-high 26 points despite the defensive efforts of Scott Hicks, who led teh Irish with 18. 
But with this year's three­point line, the Irish still had a chance. Irish head coach Dig­ger Phelps put his all-gunner team on the floor and got the shot he wanted from Sean Con­nor, who let fly from the corner--only to see his shot roll in and out. 
Kreigh Smith hit both ends of 
a one-and-one to provide the 
final margin. 
"We figured in the first half they scored nine lay ups," said Phelps. "They run their offense really well to where they get people open inside. At halftime we adjusted and went to the 1­3-1 zone just to get the lay ups 
out and force them to shoot out­
side. 
"Offensively we made some adjustments to get more penetration, and we got back in the game. I thought we han­dled ourselves very, very well. I told them just to hold their heads high. They played very well tonight and have nothing to be ashamed of." 
Phelps admitted that his squad's youth hurt the team in the final seconds. 
"When we got down one with 40 seconds to go, the inexperi­enced players didn't know to go match-up, find somebody and foul right away--just don't foul Alford, but Scotty had to foul Alford." 
Perhaps more than its youth, Notre Dame was crippled by its poor free-throw shooting. The Irish had their opportunity to take the ballgame but lost it at the charity stripe, convert­ing only 10-of-22 shots. Still, it was a barn-burner game in a classic series. 
"This is a great game," said Hoosier head coach Bob Knight. "It always has been and always will be. It's a con­test between two rivals with bona fide college students who will get their degrees and are superb basketball players. I respect Notre Dame and Dig­ger Phelps very much. We won the game--and I'm happy--but I'm sorry that Notre Dame got beat." 
When the Irish came out to open the game, Knight, long­known for his aggressive man­to-man defense, had a surprise for everyone in the form of a 2-3 zone. Although Knight quipped "what zone" after the game, the Hoosier zone limited the Irish to 11-of-28 shooting in the first half. 
"I was very surprised to see the zone," said Irish floor

Notre Dame guard Scott Hicks (10) goes up for two of his team-leading 18 points in Indiana's 67-62 victory over the Irish last night. Dennis Corrigan has the details at left, while Rick Rietbrock highlights the contributions of Hicks and freshman Scott Paddock at right. 
Hicks, Paddock help spark Irish 
By RICK RIETBROCK Sports Writer 
It was like night and day. The dif­ference between Notre Dame's first game against Western Kentucky and last night's against Indiana was rather striking. 
The 16 offensive rebounds given up against Western Kentucky dwindled to only seven by Indiana, and the turn­over total fell from 23 in the opener to 13 against the Hoosiers. 
Irish head coach Digger Phelps saw the difference, and liked what he saw . 
"I think two weeks ago, when we played Western Kentucky in the first round of the NIT, we were really em­barrassed by the way we played," he said. 
But it was a different story last night. 
"I tell you, for 39-plus minutes of basketball, these kids just played very, very hard for us," Phelps said. "We had a lot of positives for a young team that doesn't have the experience that we're going to need, especially in the front line. I thought we handled ourselves very, very well and I told them to hold their heads high. The played very well tonight and they've got nothing to be ashamed of." 
The Irish received impressive play from both the young and the old. Senior forward Donald Royal scored 14 points

NCAA snubs Irish volleyball team 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
It seems to be going around on this campus. No, not the flu or even final-exam paranoia. Rather, talented Notre Dame athletic teams worthy of post­season play are being over­looked. 
One of these teams went 5-6, 
and that is why it will be home 
on New Year's Day. But an­
other Irish team went 33-7 and 
won 17 matches in a row. 
Still, the Notre Dame volley­ball team's season is over. Sun­day the NCAA chose 32 teams to vie for the national champi­onship, and Notre Dame was not one of them. 
"I'm disappointed for the girls because we worked really hard. But a lot of times when you work hard and achieve a level which we did, it doesn't necessarily mean that good things follow," said Irish coach Art Lambert. "You've just got to re-double your efforts and work harder. There are no guarantees." 
Lambert noted that the en­tire tournament selection process needs to be reviewed at the upcoming volleyball coaches convention at the NCAA Tournament finals, later this month. 
"No matter how you look at it, it's not going to be fair until they re-adjust the regions," Lambert said. "That is the big-

Football teams play 'musical coaches' 
It's that time of the year again. 
No, I don't mean Christmas time, or winter time. I don't even mean bowl time. It's switcheroo time. 
You know--out with the old, in with the new. Building for a new tomorrow. All the old slogans get hauled out of the closet after every season of college football, as many teams change their head coaches. It is a dangerous time for coaches, since you never know how good is good enough. 
Nearly every team in the nation is looking for that special someone to guide its football team to national prominence, and of course, bring in some cold cash to its university. This year has been no different. Heads have already rolled at several universities, and it doesn't figure to stop for quite some time. 
Last season, Notre Dame even got caught up in the fun when it decided it was time to get a new football coach. Lou Holtz, a very popular choice, has since guided the Irish to a 5-6 season. He has been showered with accolades about the fine job he has done since the team has been in every game, and arguably deserves to be much closer to 10-1. 
This is all true, but let's take a look a little south where a poor fellow named Fred Akers was relieved of his duties as head coach at the Univer­sity of Texas. Akers compiled an 86-31-2 record in 10 seasons at Texas. That's the third-best record in Southwest Conference history. More than eight wins a season is good at most places, but Texas

prides itself in thinking a bit bigger than most, and eight wins just doesn't cut it the land of beef and brawn. 
Akers' version of good didn't match up with the version some influential alumni, had which usually spells trouble. What was Akers' record this year, the terrible mark that made it in­tolerable to keep him in command? The very same 5-6 mark that has earned Holtz high marks at Notre Dame. 
The problem was that Texas lost badly and to the wrong teams. If a coach is fighting for his job, he cannot afford to lose to the school's arch rivals, which Akers did when Texas fell to Oklahoma and Texas A&M. He also can't lose by big margins, which. Texas also did on a regular basis. 
It's not always whether you win or lose, it's how much you win or lose by, and how your team looks doing it. 
Among those rumored to take Akers' place is that well-known ambassador of good will, Jimmy Johnson. 
But Texas is not the only team to join in the merry-go-round. Plenty of other schools have se­lected, or are in the process of selecting the man who to turn their fortunes around. 
Purdue seemed all set to hire former New En­gland Patriots head coach Ron Meyer as its men­tor, but the Indianapolis Colts, in much greater need, took Meyer from under Purdue's nose. I doubt if it's much consolation to the Purdue ad­ministration that Meyer at least stayed in the state. 
The University of Houston has named Jack Par­dee as the next coach of its football team, replacing Bill Yeoman. Wisconsin has tabbed former Tulsa coach Don Morton to replace Jim Hillis, and LSU is looking for someone to take Bill Arnsparger's place. 
But one of the most interesting changes cur­rently in the rumor mill is the possible replace­ment of Ted Tollner at USC. After his fourth con­secutive loss to Notre Dame Saturday, Tollner's job is reportedly in jeopardy. After all, the Trojans haven't been in the Rose Bowl since way back in 1985. Last year they managed to earn a trip to the Aloha Bowl and this year they will face Auburn in the Citrus Bowl with a 7-4 record. 
But USC also has a hallowed football tradition that will not tolerate merely good seasons. They expect to be in the Rose Bowl consistently, and most of all, they expect to beat rivals UCLA and
