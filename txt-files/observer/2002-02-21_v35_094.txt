STUDENT SENATE 
Senators continue activity fee debate 
By ERIN LaRUFFA 
Associate News Editor 
For the third consecutive week, debate at the Student Senate's Wednesday meeting centered on whether senators should recommend raising the student activity fee which all Notre Dame undergraduates pay. 
Amy O'Connor, whom the sen­ate recently confirmed as club coordinator of the Club Coordination Council, spoke on behalf of campus organizations that would stand to benefit from increased funding. 
"Recently, we've seen an increase in demand while our resources have remained static," said O'Connor. "Not all clubs need more funding, but the majority do." 
The money collected through the student activity fee goes to fund a variety of campus organi­zations, including undergradu­ate clubs, the Student Union Board and the office of the stu­dent body president. 
Last week, the senate rejected, by a vote of 14 to 13, a resolu­tion calling for the University to increase the student activity fee from $65 to $75. The resolution also called for $5 increases every other year following the initial increase. 
Since the senate rejected the resolution, the body has formed a committee to draft an alterna­groups that would benefit from an activity several senators tonight.

Trustees arrive at 
SMC 
. Group will consider approving student center as part of Master Plan 
By SARAH NESTOR 
News Writer 
The Board of Trustees arrive at Saint Mary's today and will begin work in its separate com­mittees. 
The Administration has been compiling data for the Board to update them on what has hap­pened since the Board's last meeting in the fall. 
A major issue for the Board is whether they will approve the ground breaking of the new student center to be built as part of the Master Plan. 
"I really want to see the approval for groundbreaking of the student center project by the Board. I don't expect it will be a problem and the Board should approve it," said Karen Ristau, vice-president. 
After the student center is built it will house everything that is currently in Haggar. Additionally, it will include a cyber cafe, campus ministry, several lounges, a copy shop, a small theater and a dining hall. The new dining hall will have to be built first and will jut into the LeMans parking lot next to the current dining hall. Noble Family Dining Hall will be demolished so that the new student center can be built, connecting the two buildings. There is also talk about con­necting the new student cen­ter/dining hall to the tunnel

INSIDE COLUMN 


Poetic Expression 
Expression is something that manifests, embodies and symbolizes an emotion, an idea or a state of being to someone who did not partic­ipate in the same experience. There are many ways in which to express yourself, ranging from a smile or a frown to cartwheeling down South Quad and splashing in melt-water puddles to singing and interpretive dance. Those of us who were fortunate enough to 
see Ani Difranco on Tuesday night saw her self-expres­sion in her movements and dance, her lyrics and her music. All of it combined is her way of expressing that which is important to her. 
We all express ourselves in our daily lives. Whether it · 


comes across in bitter, sar- Angela Campos  
donic cynicism, in friendly  
flirting or in keeping quiet  
and to yourself, we all par- Lab Tech  
take in self-expression. It is  
how we let others know  
about ourselves, about who  

we are as people, as sentient and emotional 
beings. 
Some of the ways I have used to express myself include singing out as I walk across the quads. being very animated in how I interact with my friends and strangers and in prayer. But I have found that the form of self-expression I use the most is poetry. I write poetry as an outlet for my emotions, a sounding board for my issues and concerns and space to let my chi radiate. There is something about poetry that has always made the world more real to me. 
Stories written as fiction and creative non-fic­tion, describing the world as it is, create worlds and are wonderful ways to describe locations and situations. But in trying to describe the cir­cmnstances properly, sometimes description takes over and the meaning of what was being said is lost. 
With poetry, on the other hand, I have found allows for me, as the writer, to pick specific, dis­tinct words that focus on emotion, feeling, situa­tion and purpose. But poetry, when it is only written on the page, sometimes can be misread and the intended emotion can be lost, just like it is lost in longer fiction. When poetry is read aloud, however, the emotion. situation and inten­sity all come forth, enveloping the listeners in the author's world. The reading empowers the poet­ry, making it flow, giving it rhythm, each step bringing the reader closer to understanding the poet's [my] frame of mind. 
This evening, from 7-9 p.m. I will be joining readers for an open mic session in the Ballroom ofLaFortune. We will each be presenting read­ings that help us to express ourselves to the audi-· ence. I will be reading four original poems: "Juxtaposed," "Then Why Not 'Yes' ... ?" "Can You See" and "Friend." Each one of the poems has a tenor ofits own. Each grasps at some form of identity, all of which are a part of my identity. The set of four, combined, help me create a world which explains life, pain, healing and friendship. We will be expressing ourselves, opening up our personal thoughts and insights to you. It will not be easy for us, because we tread on sensitive territory. Come and support us. Come, let me express myself to you. Let me show· you a little bit of who I am, a little bit about me.

DUKE UNIVERSITY 

Scientists find possible cancer vaccine 
During the past live years. Dr. Johannes Vieweg and fellow immunotherapy researchers at Duke University have witnessed a fledgling prostate cancer vaccine become a clinical trial with recent, very positive patient responses: vaccine acceptance and a decrease in tumor growth rate. Thirteen patients in the advanced stages of prostate cancer have been involved in the trial over the past year. The patients are inject­ed with a certain type of cell -known as dendritic cells -from their own bodies in an attempt to combat tbc cancer. These cells first are cultured for seven days outside the patient's body and at the same time recoded with the patient's RNA to provide genetic information about the tumor cells. The vaccine is still in its early developmental stages, which means it will be quite some time, maybe five to 10 years, until it can be introduced on a larger scale in cancer treatment methods.

SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY 
Nursing school faces cuts 
With budget cuts imminent and enrollment beginning to increase for the first time in six years, the San Jose State University school of nursing is doing all it can to avoid a full-blown crisis situation, said the director of the nursing program at SJSU. Because the California State University system's budget is undergoing major reductions for the coming year, Jayne Cohen, the nurs­ing school director, said the school is buckling down and looking for ways to cut costs. "Our college is preparing for the projected deficit by analyzing where reductions could and should be made. This issue, jux­taposed with increasing nursing student enrollments, poses a special problem," Cohen said. This combined with the ever-increasing need for registered nurses with bachelor's degrees makes for a difficult future for the nursing profession, Cohen said. Dena Murphy, a fourth-semester nursing major, said she has begun to see the effects of the lack of funding.

CHINA 

Attorneys dispute time limit in rape case
Bush meets with Zemin 
Associated P rcss 
BEIJING 
On the final leg of his Asian 

trip, President Bush said 
Thursday that China is lend­
ing "steady and strong sup­
port" to the U,S.-led war on 
terrorism as it worked toward 
striking a deal with the 
United States on controlling 
the t1ow of nuclear technolo­
gy. 
High on Bush's agenda with Chinese President Jiang Zemin is preventing the sale of missile and nuclear tech­nology to nations such as Iraq and Pakistan, The two lead­ers hoped to complete an agreement during their meet­ings in Beijing, a senior White House official said Thursday on condition of anonymity. 
Jiang greeted Bush at the Great Hall before a contin­gent of 40 uniformed Chinese soldiers. They reviewed the ceremonial honor guard and shook hands with members of each others' delegations, then went behind closed doors for their talks, 
Under the potential nuclear deal, China would meet U.S. demands to publish a list of items prohibited from export and enforce the ban if the administration agreed to lift sanctions barring U.S. compa­nies from launching satellites on Chinese rockets. 
The meetings between Bush and Jiang were unlikely to be contentious, in part because of their new alliance against terrorism. China has provided the United States intelligence and other help that has gone a long way toward muting dif­ferences, and Bush also was extending an invitation for Jiang to visit Washington next fall. 
But there are also sticking points. Bush wants to encour­age Jiang to respect religious freedoms and consider the Vatican's plea to free Catholic bishops. He said he hoped that Jiang "would understand the important role of religion in an individual's life." 

In addition to human rights, Bush and Jiang are at odds over U.S. missile defense plans, the fate of Taiwan, trade and Bush's claim that North Korea, Iran and Iraq form "an axis of evil," Bush intended to raise World Trade Organization requirements that China allow U,S, soybean shipments, a $1 billion-a-year market for American grow­ers, said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. 
Before leaving South Korea, Bush told troops at Osan Air Base that despite their regional differences, the three Asian leaders he has met on his six-day tour are united in backing his coalition against the al-Qaida network and other terrorist groups.

. Priest's attorney asks court to enforce 10-year statute of limitations 
BOSTON 
Child rape charges filed against a defrocked priest do not exceed the state's 15-year statute of limitations for the crime, a prosecutor argued Wednesday. 
Attorneys for former priest John Geoghan say the charges should be dismissed because the alleged victim made a molesta­tion accusation in 1986. 
The court should apply the 10-year statute of limitations that existed then, argued Geoffrey Packard, Geoghan's attorney. The current 15-year time limit on child rape charges took effect in 1996. 
Prosecutor David Deakin said the charges, which were flied in

this nation leads a coalition to Wednesday but was delayed after the defense motion was filed last week. 
Geoghan, 66, was convicted last month of fondling a 10­year-old boy in 1991. He is to be sentenced Thursday, and could face up to 10 years in prison. 
The victim in the current case testified Wednesday that he told his mother details of the alleged abuse at age 11, in 1986. 
"I recall telling her every­thing," he said. "About the sex abuse, fondling, and oral sex," 
The specific allegation of oral sex, the act on which the rape charges are based, wasn't made until 1989, the prosecutor said. 
Since 1995. more than 130 people have claimed Geoghan fondled or raped them during the three decades he served in Boston-area parishes. 
Under pressure following Geoghan's conviction, Cardinal Bernard Law gave prosecutors the names of more than 80 active and former priests accused of' abuse during the last four decades. 
The Archdiocese of Boston said Wednesday it was suspend­ing a pastor in Abington follow­ing allegations of sexual miscon­duct with a minor. Nine priests have been suspended since the archdiocese's new policy was announced.

A train crowded with Egyptians leaving the cap­ital for a religious holiday caught fire and sped on in flames for miles Wednesday, killing 373 people, including some who died as they jumped from the burning cars, police said. 
The fire was reportedly started by a cooking gas cylinder that burst and it swept through the last seven of the train's 11 cars. Workers in gloves and masks pulled charred and twisted bodies from the wreckage. Firefighters said some of the corpses were found curled up under seats and dozens more lay alongside the train tracks. 
It was the worst disaster in 150 years of Egyptian railroad history. 
Maher Abdel Wahid, who led a team of state investigators to the scene, said he did not expect the toll to rise much beyond 373. 
Officials called it the worst train accident here in decades. 
"There has been noth­ing in the recent or dis­tant past like this," Ahmed al-Sherif, director of the state-owned Egyptian Railway Authority, said at the scene. ''I've been with the railway for 32 years and never seen or heard of an event of this size." 
President Husni Mubarak, who was in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheik, was quoted by the Middle East News Agency as expressing his "deepest regret and pro­found sorrow" to the fam­ilies of the victims. 
The news agency said the cause of the fire was a burst gas cylinder using for cooking in the dining car. But al-Sherif said the cause was still under investigation. He said the train had no dining car, but that passengers often brought gas cylinders and small stoves aboard despite regulations forbid­ding it. 
The train cars had metal frames with wooden seats. Each burned car was jammed with passen­gers whose clothing and belongings would have been flammable. Some passengers apparently had portable gas cookers. 
The cars were separat­ed, but witnesses saw pas­sengers running from car to car, including one women who was on fire. People were likely smok­ing on board, as well. 

Israel retaliates against Palestine

GAZA STRIP 

Israeli tanks and troops entered Gaza City from two directions early Thursday, the first such incursion in nearly 17 months of violence, wit­nesses said. 
Tanks went into Sejaieh neighbor­hood, which straddles the main north-south road through the Gaza Strip, near another road used by Jewish settlers and the scene of sev­eral recent attacks by Palestinian militants, according to witnesses. 
The Israeli military had no imme­diatc comment. 
Then tanks approached Beach 
Camp, a sprawling, poverty-stricken 
refugee camp, firing machine guns 
and shells, witnesses said. Also, 
Israeli warships fired machine guns 
from the sea. they said. 
Loudspeakers on mosques called 
on Gazans to come out and confront 
the Israeli invaders, and police and 
gunmen raced to the scene of the 
incursions. The sound of heavy gun­
fire reverberated all over the city of 
about 300,000. witnesses said. 
In southern Gaza, Israeli tanks and bulldozers entered the Rafah 
refugee camp and destroyed the house or a militant who killed an Israeli woman and two soldiers on Monday. before he was killed by troops. 
The incursions came after a day of Israeli air strikes. reprisal for a series or Palestinian attacks, includ­ing a surprise assault on a West Bank checkpoint in which six Israeli soldiers were killed on Wednesday. 
On Wednesday. Israeli forces tar­geted Vasser Arafat's Gaza head­quarters for the first time. Warships fired machine guns and a missile at the building, killing four guards.

Bass said 
in a state-m e n t Wednesday that he was "completely over­whelmed." 
'Tm looking forward to completing this lifelong dream," he said. 
The plan still requires the approval of the Russian space agency, Rosaviakosmos. according to MirCorp, which also plans to build the first private space station. The partners in the international space station program -the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada and Europe -also would have to approve the trip. 
The 22-year-old Bass attended space camp near Titusville, Fla., when he was 12. He said Wednesday that he would have to undergo five or six mouths of training at Star City, the space training center outside Moscow, before blasting off. 

A Los Angeles TV produc tion company, Destiny Productions, is one of several corporations offering to spon­sor Bass' journey, and hopes to document it for a television special. "Celebrity Mission: Lance Bass." 
Bass' voyage would follow that of California investment banker Dennis Tito, who reportedly paid $20 million to visit the International Space

Russia's space chief, Yuri Koptev, has said his agency is mulling over several tourist candi­dates to visit the station in October. "The earnings pro­vide serious support for the industry, the cosmonauts' training center and mission control," he said Wednesday. 
Bass expects to start train ing in May, after the pop group's "Celebrity 2002" tour, which begins March 3 in Portland, Ore. 
Bass' film debut, "On the Line," didn't exactly skyrocket in October. Critics panned the romantic comedy, co-starring Joey Fatone of 'N Sync, and it sank at the box office.

NEW YORK 
ABC News stars Barbara Walters and Diane Sawver on Tuesday denied any rift between them over an inter­view in which talk-show host Rosie O'Donnell is expected to discuss her homosexuality for the first time publicly. 
Walters said, however, that she should have been more up on "The View." 
"This had nothing to do with getting an interview with Rosie, but I am sensitive enough now as I look back to see how it could be interpreted that way and how, if one didn't know the story and wanted to create a story, it could look as if I was trying to harm Diane," Walters said on Tuesday.

ABC's announcement of the March 14 special frames it as a look at gay adoption featuring an O'Donnell interview. A sec ond special, to be broadcast in April, will be about her upcoming autobiography, "Find Me." 
O'Donnell's spokeswoman, Cindi Berger. said O'Donne!J agreed to speak to Sawyer because "it was a political 
ly." 
O'Donnell is 
ending her run as a daytime TV talk-show host in May. 
The timing of Sawyers' inter view and Walters' discussion on "The View" revived stories about competition between the two. The New York Times, in a story last week, said ABC News President David Westin had to sit the "ferocious" rivals down in fall 2000 and strike a truce after they competed over inter­views with Yasser Arafat. 
"I cannot tell you how much we hate this story," Walters said Tuesday, adding that she and Sawyer have bumped heads on stories far fewer times than one would expect, given their respective roles. 
It doesn't mean the two news stars can't have fun with it. Both dined separately at the Four Seasons in Manhattan on Tuesday, where observers could notice a scratch on Sawyer's face. She got it when she ran into a tree while walk­ing her dog over the weekend. 
'Tm going to tell everybody that I did it," Walters said.

"I think it's ridiculous that we would raise the student activity fee so peo­pie can go get free pizza at the Physics Club." "If an academic club has trouble attracting members maybe they shouldn't be a club anymore," said junior Chris Zimmerman. However, the office of the president's representative to the Financial Management Board Audra Ilagan said that it was important to maintain clubs, both for incoming fresh­men to enjoy and for the overall benefit organizations have on the campus community.

Students protest tuition 
\ 
Associated Press 
LONDON 
Shouting slogans and blow­ing whistles, thousands of uni­versity students marched through the capital Wednesday, demanding the government scrap tuition fees which they claim are plunging them into debt and barring the poor from higher educa­tion. · The streets of central London, normally choked with traffic, had a carnival atmos­phere as the students marched toward Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office and into Trafalgar Square. Police, who estimate the crowd at some 4,000 people, watched closely but didn't intervene. 
The National Union of 
Students, which organized the 
annual rally, claims Blair's 
government has betrayed stu­
dents by ending means-tested 
living allowances in favor of 
loans and introducing fees of 
up to $1,500 a year for uni­
versity courses. 
The student union says stu­dents now graduate with an average debt of $14,300 and in college must survive on $40 a week after paying rent, meaning they would, be better off claiming unemployment benefits. 
"We are appalled that a gov­ernment which claims its No. 1 priority is education is forc­ing thousands of young people to live below the minimum threshold that it believes a single person can live on," NUS national president Owain James said Wednesday. 
Education Secretary Estelle Morris said it was shortsight­ed to suggest students were better off on unemployment benefits. 
"Do they really think that their life chances would be improved if they had no quali­fications, didn't do the degree and stayed on job-seeker's allowance?" she asked. 
Ministers insist the fees are fair, as payment is means­tested, and defend the loan system, which allows students to borrow up to $5,700 an academic year, with interest rates linked to the inflation rate. Students only start repayment once they have graduated and earn $14,300 or more a year. 
Although tuition fees in Britain are small compared with countries such as the United States, opposition to them has been intense in a country that had a strong tra­dition of free education. 
It came as a shock to many students when Blair's govern­ment, which campaigned hard on the education ticket and was seen as more friendly to youth, introduced tuition fees four years ago and phased out and finally abolished student grants in the academic year 1999-2000. 
Blair has come under increasing pressure to revise the policy, after the regional governments in Scotland and Wales restored grants. Scotland has also ended tuition fees.

COLOMBIA 
President breaks off peace process 
Associated Pres. 
BOGOTA 

President Andres Pastrana broke off the peace process with leftist rebels Wednesday night, hours after guerrillas hijacked a jetliner and kidnapped a promi­nent senator. 
In a nationally televised address, Pastrana gave the Revolutionary Armed Forces until midnight, three hours away, to abandon the vast safe haven he granted them at the beginning of the process. 
The military began immediate preparations to retake the safe Switzerland-sized area of jun­gle, mountains and cattle ranch­es in southern Colombia. Gen. Euclides Sanchez, the second in command of the army, was named to head the operation. 
There was no immediate reaction from the 16,000-strong rebel group. 
But the rapid moves indicates Colombia's 38-year-old civil war -which pits the U.S.-backed military and a brutal right-wing paramilitary group against the FARC and smaller guerrilla fac­tions -will intensify. 
Pastrana's announcement was greeted in Bogota by some dri­vers honking their horns. 
"This peace process didn't make sense because of the

actions of the guerrillas," said shopkeeper Jaime Tapia. "It doesn't matter if there is a war. We are already at war." 
The highly organized hijack­ing angered a nation already fed up with peace talks that have gone nowhere, and appeared to be the last straw for Pastrana. 
"It's not possible to sign agreements on one side while putting guns to the heads of innocent people on the other," Pastrana said. 
In one of the most brazen attacks in a 38-year battle against the government, four rebels dressed in civilian clothes and armed with handguns seized control of the Aires air­lines flight, forcing it 11y into southern Colombia.

States seek cremation reform 
Associated P«:s 

The ghastly discovery of scores of bodies discarded in the woods near a Georgia cre­matory has illustrated what consumer advocates sav is a lack of state regulation and oversight of the industry. 
Eight states have no laws at all, and most of those that do, including Georgia. lack ade­quate enforcement, consumer advocates say. 
"Other than EPA emissions regulations, crematories are seriously under-regulated," said Lisa Carlson,. executive direcfor of Funeral Consumers Alliance, based in Hinesburg, Vt. "It's clear something needs to be done." 
Georgia lawmakers moved quickly this week to tighten rules for crematories and treatment of the dead after rotting corpses were found near the Tri-State Crematory in Noble. The bodies had been taken there for cremation but were left in garages, vaults or the woods. 
Ray Brent Marsh, the opera­tor. is charged with theft by deception for allegedly taking payment for cremations not performed and giving families wood chips or cement powder instead of ashes. 
One proposed law in Georgia would close a loophole that allowed crematories like Tri­State that do not open to the public for memorial services to operate without a license or state inspections. 
The bill would also broaden the definition of mistreating the dead to include abandon­ing or throwing away a body intended for burial or crema­tion. 
The Georgia case has high­lighted the disparities in state laws at a time when crema­tions are on the rise. Twenty­five percent of the 2.3 million people who died in the United States in 2000 were cremated, according to the Cremation Association of North America. The group estimates that fig­ure will double by 2025. 
Twenty-three states license their crematories, according to the association. 
Florida and California have the most comprehensive laws because they require inspec­tions, according to association executive director Jack Springer. He said California also requires that crematory operators pass training pro­grams. · 
In most of New England and Texas, state laws require cre­matories to be located at not­for-profit cemeteries. 
"In New England, where the majority of crematories are on cemetery grounds, you're not into the problems like in Ge-orgia," Carlson said. "It's much more out in the open. It's not hidden in some remote countryside location or ware­house."

Vermont and West Virginia ­have no laws, Carlson said. Ohio has a 1998 law requiring crematory inspections but it has not been used because 
· licensing of inspectors has not been completed. 
Also, unlike funeral direc­tors, crematory operators are not subject to Federal Trade Commission consumer protec­tion laws mandating disclosure of consumer rights in writing. Carlson's group, which has 120 branches in 44 states, wants the same rules applied to crematory operators. 
Lawmakers in several states have said there should be stricter rules for punishing negligent crematories. In Michigan, for example, a law­maker who is also a funeral director wants to make negli­gent disposal of human remains punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $50,000 fine. Such an act is not currently a crime in Michigan. 
Springer said problems of the sort seen in Georgia are rooted in the subcontracting system. In the Georgia case, about 25 to 30 funeral homes in Georgia, Tennessee and Alabama sent bodies to Tri­State for cremation instead of doing it themselves. 
"He said he was doing it. He wasn't doing it. Nobody checked him," Springer said. "What we need is people to be trained and be responsible for people they hire to do their cremations." 
Bob Fells, general counsel of the International Cemetery and Funeral Association, based in Heston, Va., said most states have good guidelines but do not enforce them. 
Congress has not debated crematory legislation in eight years. Fells, whose group has 6,000 members and lobbies on Capitol Hill, said he hopes the federal government stays ot1t of the issue. 
"We've always found that state regulation is more effi­cient and effective than federal oversight," he · said. "As 'bad as it is, the Georgia authorities are there on the scene." 
In Massachusetts. where there are 15 crematories, a state medical examiner must first visit the facility and inspect paperwork and view the body.

McCain decries donations 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES 
Sen. John McCain said Tuesday he had been "taint­ed" by donations from Global Crossing, but never acted improperly on behalf of the trou­b I e d telecom­m uni ca­tions firm. 
T h e Arizona senator h a s received more money from Global Crossing than any other mem­ber of Congress. 
"I am tainted by this because I received money from them·" McCain told reporters after addressing a luncheon in Los Angeles about the need for campaign finance reform. 
"All politicians are under a cloud," he said, referring to campaign finance rules that allow corporations to give mil­lions of dollars to both parties. 
Global Crossing filed the fourth-largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history last month. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the FBI are investigating the com­pany's accounting methods. 
Global Crossing has made political donations of about $3.5 million during its five years of existence. 
McCain collected $31,000 from the firm's employees in March 1999 for his presiden­tial campaign. The same month he urged the Federal Communications Commission to open the market for laying undersea fiber optic cable, a market controlled by AT&T that Global Crossing was try­ing to penetrate. 
McCain said he never men­tioned Global Crossing specifi­cally to the FCC, but knew the firm would be the beneficiary of any reform. 
McCain said his request to open the market, made when he was chair of the commerce committee, was in line with his long-standing goal of industry deregulation. 
"My whole record has been for competition in telecom," he said. ''I've written hun­dreds of letters to the FCC on behalf of firms that have never given me a dime." 
The senator said he had never provided any favors to Global Crossing. 
Global Crossing. which filed the fourth-largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history last month, has made political donations of about $3.5 mil­lion during its five years of existenr;o.

States may raise cigarette taxes 
Associated Press 
Squeezed by the recession, nearly half of the states are looking at raising cigarette taxes to generate revenue and discourage people from' smok­ing, too, 
"We've never seen as many states looking at increasing cigarette taxes as a way to make up for fiscal deficits as we're seeing right now," said Janis Borton of the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
Twenty-two states are con­sidering proposals by gover­nors or legislators to boost cigarette taxes, according to the group. 
In Oregon. for example, Gov. John Kitzhaber is advo­cating a 50-cent-a-pack increase, despite protests from the tobacco industry that it would balance the state budget on the backs of smokers. 
Kitzhaber spokesman Jon Coney said the governor -a former emergency room 
physician  - views the  tax  
increase as a "two-fer" for  
Oregon.  

"It's a good way to bring in more money in the face of the recession," he said. "There is also a public health benefit. The higher the price of a pack of cigarettes, the fewer the people who will buy them and smoke them, particularly young people." 
Already this year, legisla­tors in New York state have approved a 39-cent-a-pack 
cigarette tax increase. Health officials have attrib­Beginning April 1, New York's uted the drop in the U.S. adult cigarette tax will become smoking rate during the $1.50 per pack, the highest in 1990s to a combination of the nation. high taxes, no-smoking laws Also, New York Mayor and public service campaigns.

"We characterize what's going on as tax profiling," said John Singleton, spokesman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. "You're taking a small percentage of the popu­lation and singling them out for an additional tax burden that ultimately benefits the entire state;" 
Since 1993. the American Medical Association has advo­cated higher taxes on ciga­rettes as a way for states to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for state budgets while discouraging smoking. The idea picked up momentum after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks damaged the already weakened economy.

the cigarette tax have tried to sell it as a kind of voluntarv tax. 
"If you don't want to pay for it, don't smoke," said Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who wants to raise his state's cigarette tax by 29 cents. 
So far, the Republicans who run the Oregon Legislature have rejected Kitzhaber's pro­posal to raise the cigarette tax, saying they are against any tax increases. Kitzbaber also wants to increase Oregon's beer and wine tax. 
"Why not have a latte tax instead?" House Speaker Mark Simmons said. "It's very unfair to target one segment of society for tax increases. It's very demoralizing." 
HP workers oppose merger with Compaq 
Associated Press 

An independent poll commis­sioned by the son of Hewlett­Packard Co. co-founder David Packard found that almost two­thirds of HP employees in Oregon oppose the company's vigorously contested acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp. 
The survey, released Wednesday by Field Research Corp., challenged the company's assertion that most workers support the $21 billion purchase and gave the sons of HP's founders fresh ammunition in their increasingly acrimonious fight to sink the deal. 
HP dismissed the poll, saying it represented just one small set of its 88,000 workers. The com­pany also said the results might have been skewed because many respondents knew the poll was sought and paid for by David W. Packard, who has spo­ken out against the deal. 
Packard, who had said he commissioned the $100,000 sur­vey in hopes of getting an unbi­ased measurement of employee sentiment, did not return a mes­sage seeking comment Wednesday. 
From last Thursday through Monday, researchers at Field called randomly generated tele­phone numbers in and around Corvallis, Ore., where HP's printing division employs 4,200 people, mainly engineers and technicians. 
The 671 respondents -445 identifying themselves as HP workers and 226 as former employees -were asked about the deal and the leadership of chief executive and chairwoman Carly Fiorina. 
The poll reported that 63 per­cent of current employees oppose the deal, while 31 per­cent said they favor it. Six per­cent had no opinion or no com­ment. That section of the survey had a margin of error of five percentage points. 
Among retired employees, 59 percent were opposed and 20 percent in favor, with 21 per­cent offering no opinion. That category had a six percentage point margin of error. 
Although opposition among employees was widespread, older workers and those who have been with the company for more than 10 years tended to express greater displeasure with the deal. 
The survey is a statistically accurate reading of HP employ­ees in Corvallis but should not be considered representative of HP's entire work force, said E. Deborah Jay, president and CEO of San Francisco-based Field Research. 
The workers opposed to the deal had many of the same objections as its chief opponent, HP board member Walter Hewlett. 
Thirty-one percent of those against the deal said it didn't add enough value or they were worried about Compaq's prof­itability.

Irish conflict offers perspective 
I traveled to Belfast in Northern Ireland with the Ireland Program about two weeks ago. I think it may be the most interesting place I've ever been, both for its own sake and for the insight it gives into 
Marlayna

other hotspots of 
the world. Soenneker 
Hopefully most people know some Here We Go of the history of Again: Letters 
Northern Ireland, From Exile 
but I'll summarize it briefly anyway. 
In 1921, the 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland won their freedom from Britain, but at the cost of the partitioning of the six counties that make up Northern Ireland. These counties remairn;d part of the United Kingdom because they were predomi­nantly Unionist and Protestant. However, a full one-third of the popu­lation of these counties was Catholic. 
Over the next 80 years, Catholics in those counties were oppressed and often persecuted. Starting in the mid­1960s, for a variety of reasons, they began to fight back. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) was reborn, and for 30 years Northern Ireland experienced "The Troubles," guerrilla warfare between the IRA, Britain's army, police forces and several Unionist paramilitaries. 
During the next 30 years, 3,500 peo­ple lost their lives, often dying on the streets of Belfast, victims ofshootings and bombs. Finally, in 1998, the most recent peace process started, and with the Good Friday agreement a cease­fire began. The violence in Northern Ireland has mostly stopped since then and the government is moving for­ward. 
Our visit there was amazing. I had expected this to be a quiet war, one that was no longer visible or perhaps never had been. I quickly realized how wrong I was when our tour of Belfast 
began with the guide pointing out an 
empty lot and telling us that it used to 
be the forensics mortuary until the 
IRA blew it up. 
The war that shook Belfast for so long is in no way hidden. Murals of paramilitary men with machine guns decorate hundreds of buildings, relat­ing their willingness to die for the cause to all who pass by. Almost every corner has its story of death and every street has run with blood. 
We met with a minister in the gov­ernment of Northern Ireland and dis­cussed the radical changes that the peace process has released. The for­mer leader of the IRA is now a minis­ter in the government. Thousands of prisoners convicted in connection with IRA and Unionist paramilitary crimes have been released, meaning that there are literally hundreds of convict­ed murderers on the streets in Northern Ireland. The concessions on both sides have been huge but neces­sary for peace. 
Northern Ireland is fascinating in its own right. The play between causes that both sides deeply believe in and the conviction that fighting destroys the things worth living for is impres­sive to see. But Northern Ireland also opens up a unique perspective into the conflicts the United States is currently involved in -Afghanistan and Israel. 
The perspective that Northern Ireland gives on Israel is both hopeful and depressing. Northern Ireland shows that, no matter how sharp the division or how long the conflict, even­tually people tire of the body bags. I find Northern Ireland hopeful because it lets me believe that eventually the people of Israel and Palestine will tire of war as well and will be ready to make the concessions necessary for peace. 
However, the same situation makes me ask just how long it may take for that spiritual exhaustion to set in. Northern Ireland has been struggling to be free for more than 200 years. The sheer length of this fight is fright­ening because, though the results give one hope that the fight will end in Israel, too, I have to wonder when that end will come. How many people will die before that time? How long will the Holy Land run with blood? 
The perspective on Afghanistan is equally disturbing. I know that I, growing up. always sided with the IRA, feeling that they were fighting for their freedom, religious and political. Historically, the American sympathy has been with the IRA. But the fact is that the methods they used -snipers, grenades, rockets, bombs -are the tools of terrorists. The IRA were ter­rorists, but because they were terror­ists that we agreed with in some way, we called them rebels, revolutionaries and freedom fighters. 
We are now a country firmly united against the evils of terrorism. Their means are cowardly, their aims evil and they represent all that is wrong with the human condition. But not more than 10 years ago, we were a country who not-so-secretly sided with a different set of terrorists. The juxta­position of the IRA and al-Qaida in this way forces us to ask some serious questions about our moral position. Can we truly claim the high ground against terrorism, or must we admit that, we, too, have supported some shady fights?

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Knights misunderstand free speech 
The letter from the Knights of Columbus printed Feb. 18, entitled, '"Monologues' deny Catholic values,"' shows a com­plete misunderstanding for the concept of free speech. While the letter makes the claim that the group celebrates free speech, it is clear from the letter that they celebrate only speech with which they agree. Complaints about the legitimacy of "The Vagina Monologues" as art and claims that the play expresses views which oppose the Church sim­ply lead me to believe that the Knights of Columbus wish to censor those views with which they disagree. 
Free speech is not valuable because every instance of its use is admirable; free speech is valuable because it creates an environment for discourse in which individuals may freely make an informed decision about which idea is best. If "The Vagina Monologues" is trash, then we ought to wel­come it here so that we may have an open disussion about why the play's thoughts do or do not coincide with Christian teaching. 
Likewise, if a pro-choice speaker wishes to come to Notre Dame, I welcome that speaker. I welcome that person not because I am pro-choice, but because I believe the discourse that follows makes it all the more apparent why one ought to be pro-life. 
Father Sorin wanted this to be a Catholic institution. The University is where the Church can do its best thinking. We are talking about the same church that. at one time, perse­cuted Galileo, forbid Catholics from reading "The Catcher in the Rye," and now some members of that church would like to forbid us from seeing "The Vagina Monologues." Do we ever learn from our mistakes? God help us if the Knights of Columbus become the authority on what is and is not art.

Catholicism versus footballism 
I received an e-mail asking, "If foot­ball is not the heart and soul of the University, then what is?" This raises the issue of the relation of theology and football, and it might be an inter­esting experiment to try to map out the options. 
One: Notre Dame football is evil. One view is that foot­ball has a negative effect on the acad­emy that is so per­nicious that the game ought to be eliminated, or at least scaled down in the manner of the University of Chicago, once the home of the origi­nal "monsters of the midway" and the first Heisman Trophy winner, but now a Division III afterthought. 
Holders of this view may or may not be religious. The key is that the criti­cism accrues until it is understood that what is wrong with Notre Dame foot­ball is that it is a thing-in-itself evil, and so is at least a quasi-theological problem. Whatever gods there may be are against Division I football in gen­eral and Notre Dame football in par­ticular. 
Two: Notre Dame football is theolog­ically irrelevant. This view holds that football is an interesting game per­haps (and perhaps not). but God has little if anything to do with it, whether it is played at Notre Dame or not. There may be criticisms of how atten­tion to the sport at Division I schools negatively impacts the quest for learn­ing and involves exploitation of young men, but there may also be recogni­tion of how in some cases it makes higher education available to people who could not otherwise afford it. Adherents of this view may go to games, but may also find ethnographic observation of the crowd when outside 


the stadium more interesting. Three: Notre Dame football is part of 
a larger sacramentality. One of the 
claims made about Catholicism is that 
it is a "sacramental" faith. 
Catholics believe that 
because God made the 
world, the world can be a visible sign of 
God's ongoing 
activity. In the 
case of foot­
ball, the soli­darity, spirit · and athleti­I cism dis­
played on

zes the ct that is foot­

11. Within tre Dame, tball is unique. Evidence of this is in the fact that in any given year football receives more ink in the South 
Bend Tribune than women's basketball even when 
Four: Notre Dame football is unique­ly sacramental. There are two inflec­tions of this view, and they are usually held together. The first inflection emphasizes the fact that it is Notre Dame. There may be football at Florida State, and in recent years they the latter is national champion. Other sports and activities may be interest­ing, but if they are sacramental at all, they are not so the way that football is. 
Football at Notre Dame is the eighth sacrament. This is footballism. 
Like with many issues, the two ends of the spectrum often seem to presup­pose that the middle two options do not exist. 
One e-mail in response to an earlier column charged that because I ques­tioned football's status as the heart and soul of the University, I must also simply not care about extra-curricular activities at all. But ! am really mostly of the third type. Notre Dame football, among other things, is part of a larger sacramentality. I remember Ron Powlus' first touchdown pass. It was long, but because it was towards the corner of the end zone, it required touch. It was beautiful, even inspiring. To paraphrase Freud, however, in most cases a forward pass is just a forward pass. I may want Notre Dame to win, but God, I think, is invested in other things. 
There are problems with footballism in addition to the fact that adding an eighth sacrament makes it a faith other than the Catholicism it claims. 
The first is that it can be a sign of (and mask for) a spiritual malaise. When footballists live and die vicari­ously through Notre Dame football, it raises the question of whether there is a lack of fullness in their own lives. The second problem is the use of the family metaphor by footballists as a marker for who is and is not a mem­ber of the University community. In this view, as one e-mail made clear, all who are not footballists place their membership in the "Notre Dame fami­ly" in doubt. 
It is good that more expansive understandings of membership in the community exist.

Bare in mind Jesus' humanity 
"What's the difference between Jesus and a picture frame?" 
When my friend followed with the punchline to this joke at a party, everyone in the room groaned or looked around nervously. They had trouble accepting a joke about their chosen savior. But why does humor about the 
Joe Muto 

Son of God make people uncom­
fortable? Who is this man that we ritualistically eat every 
Livin' on a

Sunday and Holiday? And why 
Prayer

does he taste like unsalted crack­
ers? 
Well I think that my 15 years of Catholic school education more than qualify me to answer these questions. So you theology professors with your fancy "degrees" and "knowledge" can just back off. 
The Jesus of "fact" is the one from the Bible. I don't know if anyone has actually read this obscure piece of literature called the New Testament, but what it gives is pure, uncut Christ. Jt's the Christ of history, the one that existed before the Catholics started making stuff up off the top of their heads (for example: "Okay, for Jesus' sake, let's not eat meat on Friday. Oh, also Jesus said that fish isn't meat, for some reason. Amen.''). 
This Christ is intense. This is a Savior who rocks. Ile hangs out with prostitutes. He can change water into liquor at will. He talks to the devil all the time. I love this Jesus. I want to hang out with this guy. Actually. half my friends are this guy. 
But of course, as soon as the Church grabbed hold of him, they took all the bite out of him. He was no longer the Jesus who helped wedding guests get drunk. He became the Jesus who loved you, despite having no idea where you've been. Instead of being the living, flawed Jesus, he became the dead, hang­ing-in-the-back-of -the-Church -with-surprisingly­nice-abs Jesus. 
I'll digress here to take issue with this. I don't have many details offhand about the second coming, but I'm relatively sure that if and when it happens, the last thing that Jesus wants shoved in his face for an autograph is a crucifix. It's just common sense that a returned dead person probably does not want a con­stant reminder of his own death. If Elvis came back to earth, I bet he'd be pretty miffed if all his fans were wearing little silver toilet bowls around their necks. 
Also, as far as idolatry goes, we're all going to hell. The image of the Jesus that we worship looks noth­ing like the actual Jesus. This may be partially for­given, however, as it is primarily a sin of the com­memorative plate industry. Think about it: Jesus the blonde, blue-eyed, gentle. bearded hippie looks a lot better above the fireplace than Jesus the sand-blast­ed, toothless Arab. The Franklin Mint is just going with what sells. 
Other images of Jesus are deceptive too. I'm sure you've all seen the picture of him sitting on a log stump, preaching to a crowd of white kids in modern clothing. This image is misleading at best. Most mod­ern parents, if given the choice, would not allow their son to sit on the lap of a thin, single man in his mid-30s, especially if his traveling companions were 12 other men. 
So why do all the~ skewed perceptions of the orig­inal Jesus exist? My hypothesis is that we're just try­ing to make the whole Jesus myth more personal and relevant. The whole shebazz is hard enough to swal­low as it is, so the powers that be saw no benefit in constantly reminding people that our Lord and Saviour is not white at all, but a Jewish Palestinian. 
That's why the people who scoff when Jesus is por­trayed as a black man or as a woman make me angry. It's a big enough leap of faith to decide that Jesus existed at all, so anything people do to person­alize the guy should make other Christians happy that the faith is expanding. 
The Church teaches that Jesus is both human and divine, but-the humanity often gets lost in the shuffle. All you humorless Catholics who write in to Viewpoint to complain about everything from "The Vagina Monologues" to the fans at basketball games, remember this: Jesus was a human, and unlike cer­tain RAs, he had a sense of humor. Lighten up a lit­tle. 
And next time you walk into a Church, look at the abs you could grate cheese on and remember one thing: It only takes one nail to hang a picture frame.

Of course, following in the footsteps of every teen road trip movie, the girls are required to use their wile and wit to make it to Cali: hilarity ensues -at least that's what it seems the film intends. In fact, "Crossroads" either has depressing subjects or it is simply not funny. Most of the laughs come from smart-ass comments audience members yell at the screen. 
The movie mostly takes place in conversations in hotels and in Ben's '70s cruiser (an automobile that apparently has a magic radio that always tunes in at the beginning of all pop songs and in which nobody, including the pregnant woman, ever needs to wear a seatbelt). And even with cockamamie excuses to have two musical numbers and two sex scenes with Spears (scenes that conveniently cut away before anything interesting happens), the movie drags its entire 90 minutes to a lack luster conclusion.

Of course, audiences shouldn't be surprised by he movie's blatant disrespect for their intelligences. After all, the theme song of "Crossroads" is Spears' 'Tm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman:" MTV Films couldn't have been more literal with the image they are attempting to force feed the pre-teen to teen target demographic. 
Further, "Crossroads" fails to make an intelligent or touching point. In the end, all the girls have a perfect resolution to their problems, which remark­ably degrades the significance of the heavy issues the movie wishef to address such as rape, teenage pregnancy. fidelity and chastity. 
Incidentally, Spears proves herself to be an ade­quate actress; after all, she does play Britney Spears everyday. But even Spears' perky "not so innocent" breasts (which drastically change size throughout the movie) cannot save "Crossroads" from forever being referred to as Britney's biggest bust ever.

Biggest in the East 
For 5 years, the 
' .
womens swzm team has dominated the Big East Championships. Now, the Irish want to take on the nation. 

By NOREEN GILLESPIE 
Sports Writer 
Sitting around their house late one 
weekend, Carrie Kixon and Tara 
Riggs decided to play a game. 

Coming off a 201-99 dual meet slaughter of Northwestern, a Big Ten and NCAA powerhouse team, their confidence was flying high. Just for fun, Nixon and Riggs decided to see if the Irish could measure up -or even beat -the fastest teams in the country. 
After all, if Northwestern wasn't a chal­lenge, someone had to be. 
So they looked up the results of a match­up between USC and Stanford, and com­pared them to the results of the Northwestern meet. 
The result? If both teams swam the same times in the fictitious meet, Notre Dame would have come out on top of the rrinth-ranked USC. 
The outcome ignited the team. 

'The next day at practice, they came in and said if we had swam them, we would have beaten them," said senior Kelly Hecking. "Everybody was like, 'Wow ... we could be ranked [higher]."' 
It may have been a fantasy competition, but the results told the Notre Dame squad what it already knew -that they had the capacity to compete on a national level. 
Since landing a No. 13 national ranking at the beginning of the season, the women's S¼imming and diving team has been on a mission to command the respect of national-caliber programs. 
At a goal meeting at the beginrring of the season, the team aimed to place in the top 10 at the NCAA meet at the end of the sea­son. 
Working toward that goal meant shifting the focus of team goals towards the NCAA meet rather than putting the season's emphasis on the Big East conference meet. 
It's a goal that has been casually tossed around on the team since the current senior class came in to Notre Dame in 1998. But this yeru·, the pieces have begun to fall intei place. Instead of just dreaming, they want to make it a reality. 
"Since my freshman year, we've wanted to move to be an NCAA-focused team," co­captain Riggs said. "Each year, we become that a little more and more. This year, we saw I.he talent in our team, and the coach saw the talent in our team. We just needed to see it in each other ... and we have." 
"We really believe that we belong in NCAAs," Nixon said.. "We've said that is our meet, we belong with those girls, we belong in finals. Before we just said that we hope we make the meet. It's a huge mental difference." 
Biggest in the East 
They may dream of being among the best in the country, but to get there, Notre Dame has had to be the big fish swin1ming in a small pond. 
Capturing its first Big East Championship 

., in 1997, Notre Dame has quickly estab­lished its dominance in a conference that hasn't been a top contender at the NCAA Championship. And on the brink of adding a sixth con ­secutive championship to Notre Dame's list this weekend, the swimmers know that it's getting to be a familiar feeling. "It is comfortable," said co-captain Maureen Hillemneyer. "It's hard for me to say that, but that's how it's been all of my years here. We've just known it's going to be pretty easy for us to win." Notre Dame's consistent dominance in the Big East meet is a relatively new trend, however. Despite five titles, the Irish don't hold the Big East record for most conference titles. Pittsburgh has the most team titles with eight. After the Irish stepped onto the top ofthe podium for the first time in '97, Nixon remembers stepping on deck with a team in 1998 that wasn't sure it could repeat. The thought of making a team presence at NCAAs wasn't even an afterthought. "It was a big thing for them to win," said Nixon, the only fifth-year senior on the 2002 squad. "They weren't sure if they could do it again." The shift in attitude on the team since then has been apparent. Nixon said. "We've evolved from being in a competi­tion where it's anyone's meet to this year ­where it's totally dominating," Nixon said. "We're going out to win the meet, but it's not our ultimate goal." Despite Notre Dame's comfortable victo­ries, a more competitive meet has emerged in the past two years after conference administrators decided to change the qual­ification standards for the meet. Since women began swimming at the meet in 1983, teams were allowed to bring 
set numbers of swimmers and divers to the meet. Now, athletes have to make time cuts -eliminating dead weight from the 
competition. 
"It's not really increasing the quality. but focusing-the quality," said Jim Siedliski, assistant commissioner for sport adminis­tration at the Big East. "The quality has always been there. If you look at a meet that has 500 entrants. the 350 who make the cut are still going to be there. The 150 . who are there for a participatory aspect are not." 

Virginia Tech's debut at the meet last year -highlighted by a runner-up perfor­mance -has also made the meet more competitive. But it was the entrance of Notre Dame eight years ago that changed the tone of the conference meet, Siedliski said. 
"It changed the intensity of the meet," Siedliski said. "Pittsburgh were the big guys on campus. Once ND came in there, was a run for the money. Now when you step in the aquatic center, it's just amaz­ing." 
The conference has vet to make the shift to competing seriously on the national level, although the swimmers that have gone from the conference have been suc­cessful, Siedliski said. 
..We don't send a lot of s¼immers, but the ones we do send make a lot of noise," he said. 
Many of Notre Dame's swimmers hope that if they do earn a top 10 team finish at NCAAs, it will make a statement for the conference. 
"It's not known as a svvimming confer­ence, but it's definitely headed in that direction," Nixon said. "It takes one team breaking out, one team being on the NCAA level." 
Staying in the Fast Lane 
The ultimate goal for the championship this weekend is getting as many people qualified as possible for the NCAA meet in March. 
Eight swimmers -seniors Hecking, Nixon, Allison Lloyd, sophomores Lisa D'Olier, Laurie Musgrave, Lisa Garcia and frnshmen Kristen Peterson and Kelli Barton -have all made consideration times for the meet, and sophomore Marie Labosky has already earned an automatic time in the 400-yard individual medley. 
It's the most cuts the Notre Dame squad has ever had going into the conferenr,r meet, and that will give the swimmers aiming for automatic cuts something to fight for. 
"ThP thing that's different this year is that we have potential to take a dozen or more girls to NCAAs," Hillenmeyer said. "It forces us to focus more on making our NCAA cuts." 
The swimmers who have consideration times will have to swim automatic times to be guaranteed a spot at the national meet, making this .weekend's competition criti­cal. 
Maintaining focus throughout the meet has been something head coach Bailey Weathers has tried to emphasize to the team. 
"We've talked a lot about staying focused through all three days of the meet," Weathers said. "It's the only chance we have to prepare for NCAAs. If you're going to feel comfortable at the NCAA meet, you have to feel comfortable on the conference level." 
While the goal this weekend is making the times for the national meet, the team does have ~o keep its eyes on the team scores. 
"We certainly want to win the meet, and we know what we have to do to win the meet. The danger is if you're ahead halfway through the meet, you don't ever want to take it for granted," Weathers said. 
But even with five straight titles behind them, this weekend's meet will not be all easy races for the Irish. Labosky will face another tight race with Sydney Olympian and Villanova swimmer Maddy Crippen, who edged Labosky by a hundredth of a second in the 400-yard individual medley at Rolf.c; Aquatic Center earlier tllis season. 
Nixon, the conference record holder in the 100-yard freestyle, will be contested by Miami's Manon Van Rooijen, currently ranked ahead of Nixon by more than a second. 
But if they can bring home another tro­phy, they know that even though it's a familiar feflling to win, it never gets old. 
"Each race is a different race, each year is a different year," Nixon said. "You feel different, you race ·different, every time. To stand up there you say, 'I overcame the problems this year.' It really never gets old." ·

Pierce will challenge defending champi­on Eric Llmkemann of Pittsburgh in the 1,650-yard freestyle Saturday to reclaim the first-place title he held both freshman and sophomore year.

"I think I became complacent after win­ning both my freshman and sophomore

"It was hard watching my teammates and not being able to swim myself [last year]," said Horak. "It's been two years since I've had a big meet and I just want to show everyone on the team, in the Big East and back home that I can still do it."

Two TICKETS FoR: "JOHN Q" 
Hollywood healthcare 
This week, Melissa Rauch (MR) and Paul Camarata (PC) bring you "John Q." a story about a hostage situa­tion in which the really crazy people are the ones sur­rounding the guy with the gun. 'teah. we're talking to you Anne Heche -or should we say, Celestia? 
MR: The premise of "John Q" is sim­
ple. A desperate father with an 
inadequate HMO policy will do any­
thing to keep his dying child alive, in 
this case, taking a hospital emer­gency room hostage until the pow­ers that be agree to give his son a 
heart transplant. The previews pre­
pare viewers for some clichcd melo­
drama. plenty of schmaltzy taglines 
and a farfetched plot, but most, like 
myself, probably assumed that the gifted cast could pull it off anyway. So now I'm left to wonder how, with such talent involved, could this film 
have gone so wrong? 
PC: It's called bad direction. "Q" cannot be taken seriously because director Nick Cassavetes takes a good premise and in moments that are rife with tension, drowns the drama in lame jokes from cartoonish characters. Cassavetes is a wild pitcher, whose imprecision is a direct result of over-consciously aiming when he should be instinctively throwing. 
MR: From the film's opening sequence set to off-putting opera music that doesn't match the onscreen action, he never finds the correct tone to tell his story. These stylis­tic errors, however, nicely compliment the poor editing and implausible plot from which the film also suffers. For instance, the critical scene in which John single­handedly seizes control of the emergency room is jumpy and hard to follow. The lack of establishing shots and minimal verbal explanation make it impossible for the viewer to understand where John and his captives are in relation to the rest of the hospital, which presumably includes his family. 
PC: Taking over an entire hospital shouldn't be as easy as chaining two doors and getting an obese rent-a-cop to shut down the elevator. Most hospitals are like mini­cities, with a network of corridors, exits, back-up power supplies and insufficient parking. Except for Cassavetes Memorial, which has all the complexity of a Lego lemon­ade stand. 
MR: We could spend all day nit-picking the logistical blunders; let's turn to the thematic problems. The injus­
tices of U.S. privatized health-care seems to provide more than enough fodder for dramatic rhetoric and social commentary (which the film takes advantage oO, yet Cassavetes feels it necessary to comment on every social ill currently plaguing the country. The filler scenes where John and his hostages wax philosophic about all these problems are particularly annoying. The screen­writer, John Kearn, is largely to blame for this overall failure. 

PC: Cassavetes may not have written the sappy outbursts and divergent ideological diatribes that pop up throughout the dia­logue, but he certainly allowed them to make the final cut. About the only thing that Cassavetes did capably was keep race out of' the issue. The trials of a black family against the evil American bureaucratic infrastruc­ture are always going to have the whiff of subliminal racism, but Washington's John Archibald never seems racially motivated. The Archibalds' best friends are white; they worship with whites; John is turned down for a second job by a black man, pursued by a black policeman and holds both blacks and whites among the hostages. The race card is about the only one Cassavetes leaves in the deck by the movie's end. 
MR: I don't know about that. Maybe he didn't play the card, but he certainly flashed it a little. He keeps the minor characters racially balanced in both positive and nega­tive lights, but it seems like he purposely did that to blur the situation and make it OK that all the real villains of the film are rich, privileged whites. 
PC: Yes, the different races are there. but their characters are otherwise so stock that any implication is never really fulfilled. They're bland enough, in fact, that Washington and Liotta could arguably swap roles without drastically altering the plot. 
MR: Please. Denzel is a well-respected actor. Liotta has become a complete carica­ture of the presence he once commanded as an actor. His recent acting choices, most notably his role in "Hannibal" and his 
Denzel Washington plays a desperate father in the manipulative
pitiable guest appearances on "Just Shoot 
hostage drama "John Q."

Me," have turned him into a Hollywood joke. 

PC: What you fail to acknowledge, Mel. in a glaring injustice to the artist and the man, is his contribution to the pantheon of phraseology. The quip, "Yeah, he had that Ray Liotta look in his eye," is the stuff of eulogies and tombstones. There's a reason that all they ever ask him to do is be a pompous, impulsive, cackling quasi­lunatic who throws around the term "ball-breaker:" because no one in Hollywood does it better. 
MR: Well since you're in the mood to defend casting decisions, riddle me this: Why did they cast Gary Coleman as John Q's son? 
PC: That wasn't Gary Coleman, Mel. It was Webster. 
MR: Au contraire. You've mixed up your 
diminutive, adopted '80s TV children. 
Llttle Mikey Archibald (Daniel E. Smith) 
is the spitting image of Coleman, star of 
"Different Strokes." I kept expecting him to say "What you talk­ing 'bout John Q?" Despite this distrac­tion, the kid actually does some of the bet­ter acting in. the movie. With a cast that features Washington. Robert Duvall and James Woods, that's pretty

PC: I went in expecting Denzel to pull one of his "pick-up-Plymouth-Rock­and-chuck-it" routines. but he never approached that fury. He's the head­liner among these titans but still came out looking half-baked. 
MR: I thought Washington actually did a decent job of mixing subdued determination and fierce outrage. He's great at playing the everyman driven to extraordinary measures. He is believable in his desperation to save his son and his portrayal is as realistic as the flawed script allows. In my opinion, the biggest acting disappointment came from Duvall, who normally excels in the sharp, supporting character role. Rather than act, he chooses to mug for the camera worse than Jim Carrey. What would Don Corleone say?

A play in strange coIDpany 
The Moreau Seminary produces 'The Odd Couple' this weekend 
By KATIE RAND 
Scene Writer 

..,, 
By watching co-directors Nate Farley and Matthew Vereecke observe their actors during a rehearsal, it is easy to see why the pair chose this product.ion. Farley, up-front and not hesitant to speak his mind, makes Vereecke look quiet and reserved. It is fitting then, that the produc­tion being put on by the Moreau Seminary Players this year is "The Odd Couple." 
The Seminary picks up the cost of the play out of its yearly budget, so every penny earned at the door is donated directly to the missions. 
"The play doesn't cost much to put ..,n," Farley, a Moreau Seminary candidate, said. "The scripts were cheap, the rights were inexpensive, and we made the set ourselves. We were pretty frugal with our budget." 
The budget did not have a negative effect on the play however because the set only needs to resemble the living room of a twelfth floor apartment; a task that did not prove to be too difficult. The director of maintenance at the Seminary built the set's walls. and the two red doors are from last year's Pasquerilla East Music Company's production of"Guys and Dolls," 

--
-

a play with which Farley was involved. 
"We did all the set design ourselves," Vereecke said. "We only used props and furniture that we found around the Seminary." 
The table and chairs came from the din­ing room, the sofa was picked up from a lounge and the bookshelves were "bor­rowed" from friends' rooms. 
The script for "The Odd Couple" was written in the late '60s by playwright Neil Simon and has since been adapted by other writers into two television series. two films and a version of the play in which the main characters are women. 
The plot revolves around the lives of two men, Oscar Madison and Felix Unger, who hold a weekly poker night in Oscar's apart­ment with four other friends. One night the group is stunned when Felix does not show up and they are shocked to discover that he has been thrown out by his wife and is now a divorcee like Oscar. Oscar, feeling badly for his long-time friend, allows Felix to move into his apartment. The only prob­lem is that the men are as different as day and night. Felix is precise, extremely neat and anal retentive while Oscar is sloppy and carefree. Their clashing lifestyles lead to inevitable conflicts as well as a hilarious road to resolution. 
Old College sophomores Jeff Drocco and Tim O'Malley play Felix and Oscar, respectively. Both men agree that the production has taken a lot of time and effort, but they are pleased with how the play has turned out. 
"It's been pretty impossi­ble," O'Malley said. "We have a lot of late night rehearsals since we all 

have such busy schedules, but it's been worth it." Drocco agrees with his onstage room mate . 
"Just because you're in the Seminary doesn't mean you can't have a sense of humor," Drocco said. "Up until recently, plays were very common among seminar­ies. It was thought to be good for public speaking." 
In fact, hosting a play is a newly rekin­dled tradition for the Seminary. For a time it was held annually, but was put on hold until last year. 
"It used to be more or less a tradition, but it has kind of fallen off in recent years," Farley said. "Last year we revamped the Moreau Players and did 'Twelve Angry Men,' a production that raised around $2,000 for Holy Cross Missions." 
Prior to "Twelve Angry Men," (starring Vereecke) the last play put on by the 
· Seminary was none other than "The Odd Couple," a production in which Father Gary Chamberland, the rector of Keenen Hall, played Felix. 
"Last semester Matt and I poured through scripts. We looked at play after play," Farley said. "Finally we came across 'The Odd Couple' and thought it would be great for us to do." 
Auditions were held in the middle of the fall semester, with rehearsals commencing shortly there after. Six of the actors are in the Seminary. including Drocco and O'Malley as well as Brian Flaherty, Mike MacDonald, Tom Prall, and Robbv Davidson. Stage manager Charles Rittert is a freshman in Old College. 
Notre Dame sophomores Gabby Sopko and Krista Seidl play the two female roles, sisters Gwendolyn and Cecily Pigeon. 
"We chose people we were already 
f 

familiar with and who we knew would be able to keep up with our weird practice schedule without being easily intimidated," Vereecke, an Old College sophomore, said. "Gabby and Krista have been absolutely excellent and very flexible. They've been roommates for two years so they work well together and already get along like sis­ters." 
The girls, friends· of O'Malley and Drocco, joined the production for some­thing fun to do in their free time. 
"It's a pretty low pressure production and seemed like a lot of fun," Seidl said. "I thought it would be a good way to get act­ing experience and I already knew the guys really well." 
Sopko auditioned just for fun as well, although she already has some acting experience under her belt. She took a the­atre class last semester and is currently a member of the University of Notre Dame Humor Artists. Experience, however, is not a requirement to put on a successful show. 
"One of the strengths of the production is that we don't have formal training," Parley said. "We put a lot of work into this and in the end we're pulling off a great show." 
The Moreau Seminary production of "The Odd Couple" is being described as the funniest show you'll ever see in a semi­nary, but that is up to this weekend's audi­ences to decide for themselves. 
Performances are tomorrow and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in the Moreau Seminary Auditorium. Admission is free, with a freewill offering for Holy Cross Missions.

NBA 
Jackson expands trade list 
Associated Press 
PHU.ADELPHIA 

Golden State center Marc Jackson expanded his trade list Wednesday to include Utah, New Jersey, Milwaukee, and Seattle, while the Boston Celtics pulled off a trade with Phoenix and acquired Rodney Rogers and Tony Delk. 
Jackson has the right to veto any trade, and 
he has ''It's getting to the point

to include New York, Philadelphia and Phoenix, along with the Jazz, Nets. Bucks and Sonics. 
"I would think there's a good chance he'll probably get traded. That's what he wants, and to a certain degree that's what we want," Golden State coach Brian Winters said. 
So while it appeared that Jackson would get his wish before Thursday's 6 p.m. NBA trading deadline, the prospects of Nick Van Exel getting traded were dealt a serious blow when he refused to waive enough guaranteed money to satisfy the Boston Celtics, who were prepared to make a deal with Denver. 
Van Exel had said he would forfeit some of his guaranteed $26.5 million over the final two years of his contract, which runs through the 2004­05 season 
"What I can confirm is accurate is that Nick is not willing to give up what Boston is asking -guaran­teed salary protection for two years," said Van Exel's agent, Scott Botman. "It's getting to the point where I'm doubting whether anything will get done." 
With that door closed, the Celtics made a deal with Phoenix and acquired Rogers, a forward, and Delk. a guard. for rookie Joe Johnson, veter­ans Randy Brown and Milt Palacio and a Boston's No. 1 pick in the upcoming draft. 
The deal gives the Celtics a 
pair of play­
ers who can 
frontline. 
Johnson, a rookie from Arkansas selected 10th overall in last June's draft, had seen his role reduced in recent weeks. 
The surprising Celtics are in second place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 31-23. They are five games behind the Nets, whose 
president, "/just haven't left the J e f f 
Rod Thorn, office trying to make Wechsler, h a s who told him 
something happen."
acknowl­his name had edged that been floating the team Kikl Vandeweghe around in would like Nuggets general manager trade rumors 
to add another big body. 

That body could belong to Jackson, who sat out his 16th consecutive game Wednesday as the Warriors played Philadelphia. He was hoping it would be his final night in a Warriors uni­form. 
Jackson signed a six-year, $24 million offer sheet with Houston before the start of this season, but he was a restricted free agent and the Warriors matched the offer. Jackson has the right to veto any deal for one calendar year. 
''I'm ready, I'm ready now. Let's get it done," said Jackson, who spent much of the day on the phone with agent Joel Bell. "I told him don't call me anymore until you tell me which team it is." 
Jackson said he added the Nets. Bucks, Sonics and Jazz to the list because all are con­tending teams with needs at the center position. 
"I want to play somewhere they can utilize my skills, and I wouldn't mind playing alongside Karl Malone and [John] Stockton," Jackson said. "Milwaukee may need a big man who can play with his back to the basket." 
The Warriors are known to have discussed larger deals that would include Jackson as one of the pieces, and team­mate Larry Hughes was won­dering whether it might also he his final night with Golden State. 
He also spend time on the 
phone with 
his agent, 
for the better 
part of two 
weeks. 
Hughes listed the Miami Heat as one possi­ble team that was inquiring about his availability. 
The Nuggets have received numerous calls from teams wanting them to include cen­ter Raef Lafrentz in a Van Exel deal, but the Nuggets have been trying to find a team that will take Van Exel by himself. 
MLB 

Twin's owner 
.. 
promises to sell 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS 
Signaling that baseball was prepared to back off its attempt to fold the Twins, owner Carl Pohlad said Wednesday he intended to sell the team and commissioner Bud Selig gave the plan his blessing. 
"I believe that our fans in the Upper Midwest want the Twins to continue to play here," Pohlad said. He added that "may best be achieved" by a sale, which would require the buyer to keep the team in Minnesota. 
While Pohlad has been open to selling the team in the past, its future was thrown into doubt when baseball owners voted Nov. 6 to eliminate two teams. 
The Twins and Montreal Expos turned out to he the tar­gets, but baseball's contraction plan was stopped by a Minnesota judge who ordered the Twins to fulfill their Metrodome lease this season. 
"I encourage the process and am hopeful it will produce a number of potential investors who are dedicated to preserving major league baseball in Minnesota," Selig said in a statement released in coordina­tion with Pohlad's. 
Pohlad, a Minneapolis banker who has owned the team since 1984, has been sharply criti­cized for going along with the contraction plan. or at least not opposing it publicly. 
He has been an unpopular fig­ure in Minnesota through sever­al failed stadium plans, and the Twins' statement Wednesday acknowledged that by saying new ownership could help land public funding for a stadium. 
Jim Pohlad, the owner's son and a member of the team's executive board, said friends, lawmakers. and advisers told the family that·selling the team would help the stadium effort. He said the decision was diffi­cult for the family. 
"It may not be the outcome everybody wants, to see some­body else throwing out the first pitch in a brand new stadium," Jim Pohlad said. "But at least baseball will be in Minnesota." 
After the contraction plan was announced, doubts grew about the ability of potential bidders to match the price -perhaps $150 million or more -Pohlad was expected to get to fold the team. 
Two bidders have emerged: Alabama businessman Donald Watkins and a group of Twin Cities lawyers and businessmen. 
Watkins said Pohlad stands to benefit from a new stadium by fetching a bigger price for the team. and so setting up the process makes sense. He's still interested in buying the team, he said. 
Mike Ciresi. a leader of the Twin Cities group, didn't imme­diately return a call seeking comment. 
In his statement. Selig credit­ed Pohlad for saving baseball in Minnesota when he bought the franchise in 1984, and for oper­ating the franchise through a difficult period when skyrocket­ing salaries made it difficult for small-market teams to compete. 
"This course is in the best long-term interest of the Twins franchise, as, perhaps, new ownership can succeed in secur­ing financing for a new ballpark, which would allow the club to generate enough local revenues to keep the Twins in Minnesota for decades to come," Selig said. 
But St. Paul voters rejected a sales tax increase to pay for part of the stadium and the sale never happened.

,--ber of the productive U.S. top line, had two assists, while Jeremy Roenick, Chris Chelios and Tony Amonte also scored to back Mike Richter's 28-save effort in goal. 
The United States plays Hussia on Friday in a semifinal rematch of their 2-2 tie Saturday that drew the largest U.S. TV audi­ence for hockey since the 1980 Olympics. 
And how's this for coincidence: Not only is Herb Brooks again
--the U.S. coach, just as he was in 1980, but Friday is the 22nd anniversary of the "Miracle on Ice" -America's 4-3 Olympic upset of the seemingly unbeat­able Soviet Union hockey machine. 
There was an upset of historic magnitude in Wednesday's quar-terfinal~ but, this time, it didn't involve the United States. Just before the Americans took the ice, Belarus stunned previously unbeaten Sweden 4-3 to elimi­nate a potential finalist. 

If nothing else, that upset fur­ther focused the Americans' attention on Germany, which, just as Belarus, played its way through the preliminaries into the round of eight before going 0-3 in round-robin play. 
Just as they have throughout their 3-0·1 Olympic run in which they've outscored opponents 21­3, the Americans moved the puck well to generate plenty of scoring chances without relaxing defensively. It's the kind of team work that was missing when they failed to win a medal at the 1998 Nagano Olympics. 
German coach Hans Zach, who played on the 1980 West German team that lost 4-2 to Brooks' gold medalists, talked beforehand about welcoming the chance to play the Americans. And the Germans came out play­ing aggressively and physically, so much so they drew 33 penalty minutes in the first period. 
LeClair lost a tooth when struck by Erich Goldmann's wayward stick in the first period, with Goldmann drawing a high­sticking penalty and a game mis­conduct. LeClair was rammed in the face again by a stick in the second period, causing him to slam his own stick into the glass in frustration. 
Still. that didn't prevent LeClair from scoring one of three 
U.S. goals in a span of 2:05 of the second that made it 5-0 and caused Zach to pull goalie Marc Seliger. The goalie Zach pre­ferred to play -Olaf Kolzig of the Washington Capitals -sat by himself in the stands, out with a pre-Olympics injury. 
It took awhile to get it. but Rocnick scored the first American goal at 13:06 of the first, or 5 1/2 minutes into an extended power play that includ ed two 5-on-3 advantages. Hoenick broke his stick, rushed to the bench to get a new one, then returned to put a one-timer of Brian Rafalski's pass through Seliger's pads from the right cir­cle. 
Chelios, the team captain and the oldest U.S. player at 40, scored on a shot from inside the blue line in the first minute of the second period. Amonte and LeClair later scored 32 seconds apart. 
SKELETON 

Shea captures gold, extends family legacy 
Associated Press 
PARK CITY, Utah Jimmy Shea is convinced that Gramps had 
something to do with this. There's no doubt in his mind. He was trailing by the slimmest of margins, 
the skeleton gold medal slipping away. Then, in the final yards -somehow, some way -he made up the time and zoomed to victory. 

"I think my grandfather had some unfinished business down here," Shea said. "Now he can go up to heaven." 
With his grandfather's funeral card tucked inside his helmet, Shea did indeed win the gold , finishing the two runs at Utah Olympic Park in 1 minute, 41.96 seconds. 
-
Thus culminated an emotional two months for Shea, the youngest member of America's first three-generation family of Winter Olympians. 
His 91-year-old grandfather, Jack, who died last month, was the first double gold medalist in the Winter Olympics, winning two speed­skating events at the 1932 Lake Placid Games. He was also America's oldest living Winter Olympian. 
Shea's father, Jim Sr., was also an Olympian and competed in three cross-country events at the 1964 Innsbruck Games. 
He watched with tears in his eyes as his son beat defending world champion Martin Hetti of Austria, who won the silver in 1:42.01. World Cup champion Gregor Staehli of Switzerland, 

-the 1994 world champion who came out of retirement to compete, won the bronze in 1:42.15. Dad also had a theory; "I think his Gramp was there giving him that little extra push."
-Shea's victory gave the United States a record seven gold medals with four days to go in the games. Americans have won six golds four times at the Winter Olympics, most recently at the 1998 Games. Skeleton, in which competitors race head­
first down the ice at about 80 mph on a sled that looks like a large lunch tray, made its first appearance in the Winter Olympics since 1948 and only its third ever. 
Wearing a gold medal his grandfather won in 1921, Shea had the fastest first run on a snowy morning and then did just enough on his second one to hold off Rettl. 
When his sled slowed after his final run, Shea couldn't wait to celebrate. He was so excited he fell off. He then pulled out his grandfather's card and waved it as fans chant ed "U-S-Shea! U-S-Shea!" 
Another American, Lincoln Dewitt of Park City, rallied for fifth in 1:42.83 after a bad first run. Chris Soule of Trumbull, Conn., was sev­enth in 1:42.98. 
Shea Was thrilled when he qualified for the 
U.S. team in December, and so were his father and grandfather. The three were featured in national TV commercials and publications. 
But just when the family was preparing to go to Salt Lake City together last month, Jack Shea died after a car accident just a few blocks from his Lake Placid, N.Y., home. 
Shea's triumph almost seemed predestined. The steady snow meant that those sliding later in the first rwi would have tougher sledding. 
Staehli, who won all but one of the five races during the World Cup season, slid first. But when he finished in 51.16 seconds. the oppor tunity was there. 
Rettl was next, and he zoomed into first place in 51.02. After Duff Gibson of Canada went down in 51.40, Shea came to the line for the first time. 
If an injury to his left leg was bothering him, it wasn't evident. At the start house, feeling the energy of the moment, Shea jumped up and down and ran in place. Fans roared their encouragement, holding signs aloft that read "Go Jimmy." 
"I just tried to concentrate on the basics," said Shea. whose mother, Judy, was waiting at the finish line. "There's so much going on. There were 15,000 screaming people. I was just having a blast."

Feed Your Soul 
¦ by Nadia Stefko '04 

English & Government Double Major 
Most of us, when we sic down to eat, or ·at least when we remember co, begin by praying, "Bless us, 0 Lord, and chese thy gifts... ". Think abouc chac. We don't say "Bless us, 0 Lord, and this chy food' for a reason. Because God's gifts to us reach so far beyond the dining table. From the class­room to the weighcroom to the dormroom, we can see the fruits ofGod's love for us in our relation­ships with ourselves, our loved ones, and even complete strangers. Yer our Christian faith is centered around the very cable that Jesus shared with His disciples at the last supper, which we re-enact and celebrate every day in the Eucharist. 
With how busy our lives are, and how rapidly and unpredictably our schedules shift from day to day, eating is one of the few rituals we engage in on such a regular basis. How blessed we are to have the opportunity three times a day --often more --to nourish our bodies and minds as we prepare to take on the next fevr hours of the day.

From now on, every time

¦ ¦ ¦ 
Nadia;s reflection on praying before meals is a great illustration ofthe creativity people of faith have employed through the centuries to discover ways of encountering God in our daily lives. A prayer can be as simple as "Hey, God, it's me." It can be as rich and choreographed as the Basilica liturgies during Holy Week. Ultimately, however, God speaks all of these prayer "languages" and more. He is capable of hearing a sincere prayer in any form at any time. 
This Saturday, in effort to nurture a mature life of prayer, No Greater Love will give each of us an opportu­nity to experience a wide range of prayer styles. Some of these prayer forms, like leccio divina and Ignatian meditation, have been practiced by Christians for centuries. Others have taken on contemporary elements like Taize and Adoration with "praise and worship" style music. Ochers still are traditional prayers of the Church, such as Liturgy ofthe Hours and praying the Rosary . 
Campus Ministry welcomes everyone to take part this Saturday, beginning at 10:00 am at the Coleman­Morse Center. If you seem never to be able to find time for a weekend-long retreat, No Greater Love is designed for you. Ifyou're looking to re-energize your faith life during Lent, No Greater Love is the place. If you want to find new ways to encounter God and express your faith in authentic and mature ways, No Greater Love will help. Come experience something nevr.

and that was us. We've made our place in history." 
In a stunning game reminis­cent of the United States' "Miracle on Ice"over the Soviet Union in 1980, Belarus won despite being outscored 16-2 in its previous two games and being a 10-million-to-1 shot to win the gold medal. 
The only comparable upsets in Olympic hockey history were the United States' 4-3 victory over the Soviets in 1980 and Great Britain's 2-1 win over Canada in 1936. 
"I don't understand how we could lose against this team,"Swedish captain Mats Sundin said. 
As the game ended, the 
· stunned Swedes -easily the best team in the Olympics until now, with a 3-0 record and impressive wins over Canada and the Czech Republic -stood silently as the Belarusian playe.rs swarmed Mezin, who stopped 44 shots. 
Mezin played for five U.S. minor league teams before giving up on any chance at the NHL and now plays for Berlin in the German elite league. 
"He played the game of his life," Sweden coach Hardy Nilsson said. "For some rea­son, we did not have the strength to beat them." 
Belarus, which survived a week of preliminary round play just to reach the field of eight and then was outscored 22-6 in its three pool-play games, had lost its two most recent games by 8-1 scores, to the United States and Finland. 
During practice Tuesday, Belarus coach Vladimir Krikunov reminded his players of the 1980 U.S. victory, although he didn't realistically think a team with only one NHL player could beat a team as good as Sweden. After the preliminaries, Krikunov said he only wanted a respectable showing as the still-developing former Soviet republic builds a sports program. 

How's this for respectable: Belarus will play the winner of Wednesday's Canada-Finland game in the semifinals Friday. 
"For sure, it is a great. holi­day for our country," Krikunov said. 
In Sweden, however. the TT news agency called the loss "Sweden's worst ever Olympic fiasco," comparing it to the Swedish national soccer team's loss to Japan in the 1936 Summer Olympics. 
"It's a devastating loss for us and our country," Swedish for­ward Markus Naslund said. 
Sweden, which didn't play with any desperation or fear until the third period, had tied it at 3 on Sundin's goal at 7:56 of the third. But Kopat's game-winning shot, which will be replayed countless times, came from the Olympic rings along the right wing boards near midice and ricocheted off Salo's headgear, bounced behind him and scooted into the net as he looked d franti­cally behirtd him for it. 
"It was just a shot from the red line and ... well, that's what happened," said Kopat, who seemed as incredulous about the goal as anyone. 
Even Ruslan Salei, Belarus' 
only ·NHL player said after­
ward, "It was a lucky goal." 

"The shot hit me somewhere 
around my neck, and I thought I could get a glove on it," Salo ­said. "I didn't feel it hit my back, but somehow rt went in. 
Despite Nilsson's prophetic admonition that "it's a quar­terfinal and you never know," the game started predictably with a Nicklas Lidstrom power-play goal at 3:10 of the first period. 
But Sweden, so fast and effi­cient before, got sloppy and careless after that, ·once almost allowing a goal wh.ile on a 5-on-3 advantage. 
"We should have put this team away in the first or sec­ond period," Sundin said.. 
Oleg Romanov tied it with Belarus still down a man, scoring short-handed on a slap shot from the top of the right circle at 7 :4 7 of the first. Dmitry Dudik scored during a two-man advantage later in the period to give Belarus a 2­1 lead. 
Right about then, Belarus began to play as if it thought it could win. To counter Sweden's dynamic "torpedo" system, Belarus counterat­tacked aggressively to take advantage of the Swedes' reliance on one defenseman as an extra forward. 
Michael Nylander tied it for Sweden later in the period, but Belarus regained the lead when Andrei Kovalev stole the puck at midice and beat Salo -the hero of Sweden's 1994 goal medal shootout victory over Canada -on a break­away l).t 2:47 of the third peri­od. 
It is the second quarterfinal 
upset loss for Sweden in as 
many Olympics. Finland beat 
the defending champion

Junior Lauren Smith, with a few seconds knocked off her time, could take home a first place finish and a bid for .nationals in the 200-meter breaststroke.

''I think Meg Ramsey has a very legitimate shot, if not two, possibly even three, in the 500 free and both butter­fly events," Petcoff said. Wednesday night the team had a chance to get into the pool and get used to host school Hope's facilities. After spending four months getting used to facilities in South Bend, Petcoff gave his team some valuable advice on Tuesday night.

LILLY PULITZER FRANKIE B 

Ty risks youth for a shot·at pros 
Ty Tryon won'l be compet­ing in the Byron Nelson Classic this May. He was forced to turn down an invita­tion from one the game of golrs most revered legends because he has "other obliga­tions." Tryon, a 17-year-old high school junior won't play that week­end because he wants to. attend the prom. 
Now every high school 
kid 
wants to go to the 

prom. Tryon can't be blamed for 
that. What Tryon can be 
blamed for is his much-debat­
ed decision to join the PGA Tour at an age where he's just old enough to drive, and just young enough to still have a stubborn acne prob­
lem. 

However, ability is not the issue. Tryon's game is beyond his scant few years. At the pressure-packed crucible that is the six-round PGA Tour Qualifying School, Tryon shot a dazzling 66 to capture a Tour card and the exempt status that comes with it. He's armed with 300-yard drives, a reliable putter, and well over $1 million in endorse­ment contracts from the likes of Calloway and Target. 
Tyron, however, paid dearly for his bounty; he sacrificed his youth, and no matter how many titles he wins, he'll never be able to get that back. 
Tryon did more than miss the cut in his professional debut earlier this month at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. He missed the point. Golf is not about how good you are now; it's much more about how good you can be. 
Every golfer on the planet, from Tiger Woods to the hacker in lhe stall next to you at the driving range, believes he can get better, that his best swings lie ahead. Jack Nicklaus won his sixth Masters at the age of 46. 

You can play great golf for a long time and history has shown us that most players don't peak until they turn 30. Ben Hogan didn't win the first of his plethora of majors until he was 35. So why is Tryon in such a hurry? 
That same Tiger guy was a pretty decent 17-year-old just nine years ago, but he didn't join the tour until he was 20. Instead Tiger honed his game against stern competition at the amateur level, winning three consecutive amateur crowns as well as an NCM Championship as a member of the Stanford Cardinal. Woods, though he may have been able to compete at 17. recognized the immaturity of his game, and as he worked on it embraced his youth and went to college. 
Tryon apparently knows better than guys like Tiger, though he's won almost noth­ing of importance in the junior ranks. He'll never get to go an SYR or sit in a dorm room with his buddies sipping a lukewarm Natty Light. 
For Tryon, 40s at four won't be a cause for Friday celebra­tion, but rather a bad number on the back nine in the sec­ond round. He's made the quantum leap from preco­cious teenager to full-f1edged adulthood, and there's no crossing back. Guys on the tour play for keeps and for their livelihoods. 
These guys are fathers, playing to send their kids to college. Tryon is playing to avoid it. While Tryon calls his girlfriend, the other members are calling their investment gurus. How's a high school kid going to fit in with those guys? What do they talk about to bridge the age gap? 
He's Britney Spears and 
they're Barbara Streisand. 
In order to retain his tour 
membership, Tryon must fin­
ish in the top 125 on this 
year's money list. If he 
doesn't, he 'II have to re-enroll 
in Q-School, where the odds 
of qualifying for a second 
consecutive year are about as 
good as my chances of com­
peting in this April's Masters. 
If Tryon falls flat on his face 
this year. and many think he 
will, there is no safety net. By 
playing in just one event as a 
professional, Tryon would 
forever forfeit his amateur 
status , eliminating his ability .to play college golf. His time 
is now, and unless he plays 
with the big guys, he may not 
have a later.

Allen Iverson scored 46 points, reaching 40 for the fifth time this season and the 38th time in his career as the Philadelphia 76ers defeated the turnover­prone Golden State Warriors 114-107 Wednesday night.

Danny Fortson had 18 for the Warriors, who kept the game close for much of the fourth quarter but repeatedly made mistakes, including sloppy turnovers and ill-advised shots after coming up with defensive stops and blocked shots on sev­eral Sixers possessions. 
Golden State blocked three shots in the span of a minute with less than four minutes left, each leading to a possession that ended with a turnover or a miss. 
Iverson shot 14-of-36 from the field and 16-for-20 from the line in reaching 40 points for the first time since Jan. 25 when he had 47 at Boston. He capped his night with a breakaway dunk with 17 seconds left. 
Harpring tied his season-high by making two free throws with

Graves into the starting lineup for the first time since Notre Dame's loss to Georgetown on Jan. 21. 
"I didn't want there to be any doubt. I just wanted to come out and play well," Graves said. "This needs to be the lineup. I've invested a lot of time in bringing this program back to where it needs to be." 
Coming into Wednesday's con­test, the Irish knew where they needed to be: back in the win­ning column. 
And the Irish had little trouble making that happen against a struggling Mountaineer team. 
"We were real solid tonight," Thomas said. "Our backs were against the wall and to come out and play so well speaks so high­ly of our coach and three cap­tains." 
Notre Dame jumped out to a 12-point lead 14 minutes into the half before the Mountaineers whittled the deficit to just firn. 
But quick transitioning on offense and strong defense from the Irish gave the home team a 10-point edge at the half. 
"I think we've found success when we run the ball," Thomas said. "We're so much more dan­gerous when we run." 
Bolstered by five quick points from Graves, the Irish ran out to a 15-point lead just minutes into the second half, and pushed it up to 25 points on a Thomas reverse dunk with six minutes left to play . 
The Mountaineers, who own an 8-17 overall and 1-12 confer­ence record struggled all night on both ends of the court. 
Defensively, the Mountaineers had trouble slowing down the Irish run. 
"The problem with the team this year is the problem we had tonight: we just don't guard," Catlett said. "We have not been able to improve. IThe Irish] beat us at -zone and man." 
Freshman guards Jonathan Hargett and Drew Schifino led the Mountaineers with 15 points a piece, but interim coach Drew Catlett was not pleased with Hargett's performance in his match-up with Thomas. 
"Jon thinks he can score and play against anybody," Catlett said. "One problem Jon has had all year is that it's five-on-five. He needs to get his teammates involved. I think he got caught 
up  in  [the  match-up  with  
Thomas]."  
The  win  against  the

FENCING 

Irish take top spot in polls 
By MIKE CONNOLLY 
Sports W ricer 

The expected was finally made official Tuesday, as the Notre Dame men's fencing team earned a No. 1 ranking in the latest United States Fencing Coaches' Association poll. 
The men assumed the top ranking after knocking off then-No. 1 St. John's on Jan. 27 by a 14-13 margin. 
St. John's falls into the No. 2 spot, while Penn State remains No. 3. Notre Dame's chief Midwest competition made the biggest jump in the polls, as Ohio State moved up four spots in the poll into a tie with Columbia for No. 4. 
Princeton remained No. 6 in the poll, and was followed by Pennsylvania, Stanford, Yale and NYU.

Notre Dame advanced to the Final Four last season. 
While there are many question marks circling around this year's team, Irish head coach Kevin Corrigan is confident that Notre Dame will rise to the challenge. 
"[ think it is going to be an exciting year,'' said Corrigan. "I am looking forward to seeing what we can do with this group. I hope we can 
year." 
In many respects this . season could be characterized as a rebuilding year because the Irish are such a young team. The Irish feature 12 sophomores and 15 freshmen on its the roster of 
45. 
Although there is definitely a youth movement on this year's team, senior captains John Flandina, Chad DeBolt, Devin Ryan and A.J. Wright are expect­ed to answer many of the ques­tion marks surrounding this team. All four captains will be responsible for building team unity and cohesiveness as the season progresses. 
Midfielders Flandina and Ryan are Notre Dame's top returning scorers. Flandina scored 20 goals and dished out seven assists last season. Ryan came on strong at the end of the sea­son, and finished with 15 goals and two assists. Both players are considered leading candidates for Player of the Year honors in the Great Western Lacrosse

League. Departed All-American attackman Glatzel won the cov­eted award last year. 
The answers to many of those marks on offense could come from senior midfielder Flandina and senior attackman Devin Ryan. Junior Travis Wells, sophomores Steve Clagett and Owen Mulford, and freshmen Chris Richez and Brian Giordano are all expected to compete for playing time at the midfield posi­tions alongside Flandina and Ryan. 
"John is going to be a really 
important guy 

tainly in the 
mix as well. 
We really value guys who can play at both ends of the field at the midfield position. Owen Mulford, Steve Clagett and Travis Wells arc all capable of doing that. We also have a couple of young guys Chris Richez and Brian Giordano who are going to play some as well."

"We are not going to play slow-down but it may take us longer to gen­erate the opportunities like we did last year. We are going to have to be patient and smart about what we are doing." 
This year's Irish team may not feature the same players as last year's squad, but their goal remains the same. 
The road back to the Final Four begins Sunday at 1 p.m when Notre Dame takes on Penn State.

MEN'S BASKETBALL 

Irish snap losing streak 
By KERRY SMITH 
Sports Writer 
Chris Thomas broke out of a two-game slump to lead the Irish to an 89-76 rout­ing of West Virginia Wednesday at the Joyce Center. 
After shooting a dismal 3-25 in Notre Dame's two previous outings, the point guard scored a game-high 26 points and dished out 12 assists. as the Irish snapped a two-game losing streak and improved to an 18-8 overall record and 8-6 in the Big East. 
Irish head coach Mike Brey pumped his freshman up before the outing with a highlight reel from some of Thomas' past games. 
"It showed him attacking. It was the Chris we have seen for 95 percent of the season and I think he responded to that," Brey said. "He knew there was a sensfl of urgency for us." 
Brey also relayed that sense of urgency to his senior captains before the game, and they responded, as David Graves scored 20 points, Ryan Humphrey added 19 and Harold Swanagan, still nursing an injury, logged quality minutes on the court. 
"[Brey] told us how many games we have left at the most and we want to make the most out of every game," Humphrey said. "I don't want to go out with a bad memory or bad taste in my mouth." 
Brey also hinted that it was time for

MEN'S LACROSSE 

Irish begin quest for Final Four 
By JOE LICANORO 
Sports Wrirer 

Last year, the Notre Dame men ·s lacrosse team shocked the lacrosse world by advancing to the NCAA Final Four for the rrrst time in school history. 
This year's Irish squad would like nothing more than to make a repeat trip to the Final Four, but the Irish know their work is cut out for them. The journey begins this Sunday when the pre-season 11th-ranked Irish host the Penn State Nittany Lions. 
This year's Irish squad will have a completely different look. Gone are last year's top three leading scorers at the attack position: Tom Glatzel, David Ulrich and Todd Ulrich. The Irish also must somehow figure out a way to replace the leader­ship of rnidfielders Steve Bishko and Chris Young. 
Replacing departed goalie Kirk Howell will not be an easy task either. Howell had been a fixture in net for the last four seasons, and his strong play was one of the primary reasons

Swimmers dive into tough competition 
. Upsets earlier in season make Belles marked opponent 
By KATIE McVOY Associate Sports Editor 
-
At the beginning of the sea­son, they were a nameless team that belonged to "that all women's college some­where in rndiana". 
But today they are marked. Today teams will be looking ro beat them, hoping for 
...... 
revenge from losses earlier this season. Today they will head into a championship 
· event with hopes set much higher than last place. 
The Belles, who started off the season at the bottom of the pack in the MIAA, will head into this weekend's MIAA tournament with a new confidence after defeating three MIAA opponents this season. But with the confi­dence of those wins also brought a loss with it -a loss of the element of sur­prise. 

"I think the biggest thing is. the women now understand, especially after the second win, in a way, there's not ele­ment of surprising anyone anymore," said head coach Greg Petcoff. "So while they have confidence, we've talked about the fact that everyone now understands that with Saint Mary's it's going to be a little bit of a battle." 
Earlier this season, Sa.int Mary's defeated Albion, Olivet and Kalamazoo. Heading into the tournament, which starts today at 10 a.m., the Belles will have their sights set on outswimming Kalamazoo, Albion and Alma. 
"I'd say I'd love to see us finish third, but it is so tight between Alma, Albion, Kalamazoo and us," Petcoff said. "Alma beat us. We beat Albion and Albion beat Alma, so we could finish sixth or we could finish third." 
While the Belles have some solid co,npetitors for top spots in several events, the strength the team needs to take home a third place finish will come from the fifth through 12th swimmers. With such tight competition between the four schools competing for four spots, how low all the team·s swimmers, not just the stars, can finish is key. 
"The big battle is what's happening in places five, six, seven through twelve," Petcoff said. "Take the rest of the roster, we need them. You know who your stars are, but it's your unsung stars that set thi'ngs up." 
If the battle could be won in places five through 12, some top finishes couldn't hurt
