By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Editor 
Membflrs of the Campaign for Human Dignity presented the Office of the President a petition asking that sexual orientation be added to the University's nondis­crimination clause Wednesday. 
Currently, the clause states the University does not discriminate based on "race/ethnicity, color, national origin, sex, disability, veteran status or age:" 
Group members and students gathered outside the Main Building to present a unified front, according to sophomore Mary Dewey, chair of the cam­paign. 
Police raid Lafayette Apartments 
Observer Staff Report 
Saint Patrick's Day revelry caused University and state law ·enforcement to crack down on tmderage drinking Tuesday. 
Captain Phil Trent of the South Bend Police Department (SBPD) said the Indiana State Excise Police led a raid at Lafayette Apartments in South Bend Tuesday night. 
Trent said he does not know how the Excise Police were made aware of possible underage alco­hol consumption in the apartment complex. 
He said he does not have details about the outcome ·of the raid because the SBPD was not involved. 
"We were aware of police activi­ty, but didn't go there until after," Trent said. "We were in the area, but we didn't participate." 
The Excise Police could not be reached as of press time. , 
Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP) also responded an alcohol­related disturbance Tuesday, according to Dave Chapman, assistant director of NDSP. 
NDSP was received calls that NDSP students were disrupting class with a parade through cam­pus and responded to those calls between 9:30 and 10:00 a.m., Chapman said. 
Senior Nick Hittler organized the parade, which he said includ­ed over 100 students and began at the intersection of South Bend and Notre Dame Aves. and continued through campus.

Dewey said the group gar­nered over 2,300 student signa­tures supporting the aims of the petition. 
"We wanted to show solidari­ty," said sophomore Bridget Flores, president of the Progressive Student Alliance. "We wanted to show that this is something a lot of students care about." 
The group took similar action last spring and received about the same amount of signatures, but did not get a response from the administration. However this time, Flores said Jenkins has agreed to a meeting on March 30.

College tuition increases 

By ASHLEY CHARNLEY Saint Mary's Editor 
The Saint Mary's Board of Trustees approved a 5 percent increase in tuition and a 3 per­cent increase in room and board costs for the 2009-2010 school year Tuesday. 
This will make the average cost $38,822, including tuition and room and board fees, according to the College's press release. 
The rise in tuition is a result of the Board evaluating "economic conditions, our current pricing structure and our peer institu­tions," Daniel Meyer, vice presi­dent for Enrollment Management, said. 
Due to the College's costs in employee health care, energy and services, in addition to facili­ty depreciation costs, the Board decided on this tuition increase, Meyer said. 

According to Meyer, the Board considered the impact this increase would have on families who are already struggling to keep up with costs in the current state of the economy. 
"The Board was concerned about the impact any tuition increase will have on families. But they also believe firmly in maintaining the quality of edu­cation we provide and deter­mined that this modest increase is necessary to maintain the

Students oppose abortion­rights bill 
By AARON STEINER NewsWrirer 

In the early stages of the presi­dential candidate, tl1en-candidate Barack Obama made headlines when he told a pro-choice group that "the first thing" he'd do as president was sign a controversial abortion bill that opponents call a radical attack on the pro-life move­ment. 
Responding to a question regard­ing how he would preserve repro­ductive rights in a speech given to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund on July 17, 2007, Obama said, "The first thing I'd do, as president, is sign the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA). That's the first thing that I'd do." 
The legis]p,tion makes the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade deci­sion federal law, and allows a woman to "terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability, or terminate a pregnancy after Viability when nec­essary to protect her life or her health," among other provisions. 
While the bill has not been signed, or even reached the floor of Congress for debate during the cur­rent session, pro-life advocates have leapt into action since Obama's election, and members of the Notre Dame community have joined the campaign to prevent the passage of the legislation. 
Chief among the opposition to the bill at Notre Da.me is the University's student Right to Life club, which has organized a post­card campaign as part of a national

Cycling club to host race this weekend 
ByJENNMETZ 
NewsWrirer 
This weekend, the Notre Dame Cycling Club -the "Cyclin' Irish" -will be hosting its first ever race in South Bend. 
The races -a road race Saturday and a criterium, a short course bike race, Sunday -will take place near campus; the first race, on country roads Northwest of Notre Dame, will begin at 10 a.m. Saturday. 
Cyclists will compete in four divisions for men, categories A­D, and two divisions for women, A-B. Each category's race increases in distance. 
Whereas cyclists complete a few number of long-distance laps in the road race, the criteri­um is a "more technical, shorter 
course," senior Andy Steves said. 
"It's much more spectator­friendly. We'd love to have a lot of people there," he said. 
The criterium's reputation for crashes and "blood and guts" might also make the race more interesting for spectators, Steves, who has competed for Notre Dame since his freshman year, said. 
Steves, a senior who has been riding since his senior year in high school, said he became interested in cycling because his grandfather comp~ed in the Ironman. 
The club competes in the Midwest Collegiate Cycling Conference, traveling to schools

INSIDE COLUMN 
NCAA: 

Day One 
No matter what the Super Bowl may claim, the best sports day of the year is really two days. Today and tomorrow. The first round of the NCAA Tournament. Even though Notre Dame didn't get invit­ed to this year's Big Dance, my fridge is stacked and I have enough snacks on hand to last me all 12 hours of college basketball good­ness. I know Douglas Farmer did a March Madness rundown yesterday, but let's take a look at the most Sam Werner interesting 
games of Day Fantasy Sports One: Editor 
+12:20 p.m. 
(9) Butler vs. (8) LSU -Ah, the classic 8/9 matchup to open up the tournament. Bulldogs against Tigers. Midmajor vs. weak major. There's a legitimate chance the Horizon League was almost as good as the SEC this year, and Butler's loss in the conference tournament hurt them more than it should have. Pick: Butler 
+ 2:30 p.m. (12) Northern Iowa vs. (5) Purdue -All the pieces are in place for the textbook 5/12 upset. The Panthers have come excruciat­ingly close to pulling a first-round shocker before, losing by five or less each year between 2004 and 2006, all as double-digit seeds. Purdue is good, no doubt, but it remains to be seen how the Big Ten stacks up in the tournament. Pick: Northern Iowa 

I 
+5:00 p.m. (13) Mississippi State vs. (4) Washington -Two schools coming out of week conferences ­even President Obama said the Pac­10 was down this year. Both teams, 
·though, are coming in red-hot. The 
I Bulldogs are only here because of their run through the SEC tourna­ment, and the Huskies have only lost three games in the past two months. Expect the Bulldogs to make it interesting, but come up just short. Pick: Washington +9:50 p.m. (11) VCU vs. (6) UCLA -Even President Barack "Chalk" Obama picked this upset (if you don't get that last joke, go check out Obama's picks on ESPN). VCU upset Duke in the first round two years ago, and the Rams might have another one in them this year. The Bruins have to travel across 
the country, and a sluggish start will cost them. Pick: VCU 
+ 9:55 'p.m. (12) Western Kentucky vs. (5) Illinois -The last game of the day could end up being the best. The Hilltoppers return almost the entire lineup from a team that stunned fifth-seeded Drake in the first round last year on a buzzer-beating Ty Rogers three­pointer and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen. And, when in doubt, just remember, the Big Ten is terrible. Pick: Western Kentucky 
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is your TV viewing schedule for today's slate. Remember, all the games are on CBS. Games are also available streaming on CBS's Web site, but I'd never endorse neglect­ing academics and watching games during class.

Women allegedly punches, bites her son's principal 
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -A Rhode Island woman faces charges after allegedly punching and biting her 11-year-old son's school principal after being told the boy was being suspended. Police said 30-year-old Aleyda Uceta also bit an officer trying to arrest her after Friday's inci­dent at Roger Williams Middle School in Providence. 
She was charged with assault on school offi­cials, assault on police officers and resisting 
arrest. 

Principal Rudolph Moseley Jr. was allegedly assaulted after he told Uceta that her son would be suspended for three days for refusing to go to a room for misbehaving students. 
Police said Uceta punched Moseley in the face and bit his left arm. 
Attempts to reach Uceta by phone for comment were unsuccessful.

MBA fellowships offered 
By LIZ O'DONNELL News Writer 
The University will offer eight fellowships, ranging from $10,000 to $20,000, to students entering the Executive MBA (EMBA) program this year. 
Barry Van Dyck, the director of degree programs in Executive education, said this will open doors for highly quali­fied applicants who may have trouble financing their educa­tion. 
"We always have highly quali­fied applicants to the EMBA program where funding is a challenge," Van Dyck said. "Our purpose with these fellowships is to provide services to stu­dents." 
The fellowships will be awarded based on a combina­tion of merit and need and will function similar to undergradu­ate awards of the same type. 
The awarding of these fellow­ships has been a few years in the making, Van Dyck said. 
"The program is funded by both contributions from EMBA alumni into the John Cardinal O'Hara Society and by the J.A. Berne! Fellowship awards," he said. "We have had the idea for this program for a little while and now have enough saved to put it into place." ... 
Alumni of the program have donated money to the John Cardinal O'Hara society for this purpose. 
In order for a candidate to be considered for one of the fellow­ships, one must submit a com. pleted application to the EMBA program and then apply for the scholarship. 
Winners will be notified any­time between their acceptance into the EMBA program and the first day of class. 
"When considering applicants for the program, we are looking for them to have a variety of assets," Van Dyck said. "We want candidates who are expe­rienced, performed well as undergraduates, and who are need based. Basically, similar criteria to what is looked at when applying for scholarships as an undergrad." 
After the fellowships are awarded, an allotted amount of the total award will be distrib­uted at the start of each pro­gression. 
Recipients of the award must maintain a cumulative 3.25 grade point average to remain eligible for the fellowship. 
The EMBA program has loca­tions in Chicago, Cincinnati and South Bend. 
Early application to the pro­gram is encouraged. The dead­line for the Class of 2011 appli­cations for the South Bend and Cincinnati locations is June 1 and Nov. 1 for the Chicago loca­tion. 
The average student in the EMBA program is 36 years of age and works full time. Van Dyck also said many enrolled in the program have families. 
"It takes a great deal of disci­pline to complete this program," said Van Dyck. "Not only do these people have full time jobs and families to attend to, but they are also full time students as well." 
Van Dyck said he predicts the biggest pool of applicants will come from the South Bend and Chicago locations, the pro­gram's two largest sites. 
The EMBA program has been around for almost 30 years, graduating its first class at the South Bend site in 1984. 
According to its Web site, Notre Dame Executive Education "provides leaders· in the executive and management ranks the opportunity to devel­op and strengthen their leader­ship abilities and business acu­men skills through both degree and non-degree programs."

Speakers cliscuss role of 


religion in developlllent 
By LIZ LEFEBVRE 
News Writer 

Decisions made toward glob­al development must be informed by a religious under­standing of human nature, Scott Appleby, the director of the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, who spoke Wednesday on "The Impact of Religion on Development," said. 
"Development is a far broad­er and richer category than mere economic and material progress," he said. "A cultural and spiritual dimension must be a basis for informing deci­sions about development," said. 
The Ford Family Program in Human Development Studies and Solidarity presented the second part of its lecture series on "Discussions on Development" Wednesday evening. 
The discussion also featured theology professor Fr. Paul Kollman, who explored the ways in which religion influ­ences that challenge of global development. 
Appleby began his portion of the lecture by explaining the term "theological anthropolo­gy," which is the view that reli­gions should have an anthropo­logical view of what constitutes human nature. 
Appleby said for development to succeed, there needs to be a complete understanding of human nature. 
"Religion comprehends the whole human person." Appleby said. "Religion sees a funda­mental orientation to each per­son as a child of God." 
Appleby made this point in reference to Roman Catholicism, which holds the view of the human in relation to God, rather than seeing each person as an isolated individ­ual. 
In addition, Appleby dis­cussed the ethical orientation of religion to development. He said "religion allows people to ask the question, 'How ought we think about development ethically?"' 
Kollman echoed Appleby's comments and drew on his own experiences of development while living in Eastern Africa. 
"Religion and development is more complex than it initially seems," Kollman stated. "There is no unitary way they inter­sect." 
Kollman emphasized how religion is internally contested and how various religions question different aspects of development. 
"Religion can reinforce devel­opment priorities in theory and practice, and religion can also challenge and contest these priorities," Kollman said. 
The next part of the "Discussions on Development" series will take place April 1. The event will address the topic of "Science, Technology, and Development" and will feature Mary Ann McDowell, professor of biology, and Steve Silliman, professor of engineering.

LDS stat~ interviews 
By LAURA McCRYSTAL News Writer 

Loyal Daughters and Sons, the annual play examining gender rela­tions at Notre Dame, does not show again until November, but the writ­ers for the 2009 show have already begun conducting interviews and collecting stories for the production. 
Sade Murphy and Kevin Stein, who are both juniors and former cast members of the show, are the writers for the 2009 production. 
"Content-wise, we are looking for experiences and opinions in the sphere of the following topics: sexu­al assault, eating disorders, homo­sexuality, chastity and healthy rela­tionships," Murphy said. 
Stein said the show is entirely based on real experiences of stu­dents and that the writers are cur­rently looking for students who would like to share their thoughts or stories on the relevant issues. 
'We have conducted a few inter­views already, but anticipate many more to come in," he said. 'We are definitely still looking for students to interview, so anyone should come in and talk to us, even ifthey don't nec­essarily think their story or experi­ence is worth hearing -everyone ha<; something worthwhile to offer." 
After the writers listen to stories from students this semester, they will spend the sununer transform­ing the collected interviews into scenes that preserve the truth behind the experiences, Murphy said. 
"All of the stories we tell are based on testimony from members of the community here," he said. ''While we may change some minor facts and names, we do not change what people are saying to us." 
Approximately half of the 2009 show will be based on the inter­views, while the other half will be come from previous productions of the show, Stein said. 
The Department of Film, Television, and Theatre will help the writers refine the scenes into a final script, which will.be finished by the end of the sununer. Auditions and casting for the show will take place in September for the November show. 
Stein said he became involved With Loyal Daughters and Sons because it was an opportunity to make a difference. 
'We are giving voice to the stu­dents' thoughts and experiences," he said. "It is important to help make this campus a more open place and to get conversation start­ed on sexuality." 
In addition to generating conver­sation, Murphy also said the show promotes a stronger, healthier com­munity. 
"I really hope that people take advantage of this show," sh~ said. "Because it's not just some other play, this show is communal, it requires the participation of the community to survive and be suc­cessful."

DSLC begins at SMC 
By EMILY DABISH News Writer 

SMC's fourth annual Diverse Student's Leadership Conference (DSLC) kicked off Wednesday to address issues of diversity in pover­ty, education, and leadership. 
Senior Sarah Barnes, Vice President of the Student Diversity Board, helped to explain the impor­tant of understanding diversity in today's world. 
"With globalization, the intercon­nectedness among different ethnid­ties and cultures will increase in the future," she said. "There is a need to improve the art of thinking inde­pendently together, and the need to work for social justice to become fully human." 
A more complete understanding of diversity is important because "the more perspectives that are brought to bear, the better the preparation for yovr future," according to College Pr(;lsident Carol Ann Mooney. 
Dr. Jeniffer Fluri, faculty member at Dartmouth's women's studies department, introduced the topic of "everyday leaders." 
Fluri discussed how important it is to critique world leaders. She said these leaders have to question the conventional wisdom about what groups ofpeople are accepted according to political structures and

quality of education at Saint Mary's," Meyer said. 
In a letter to students' families, Saint Mary's President Carol Ann Mooney informed parenl<> that she recognizes the many family cur­rently struggle to pay tuition. 
"We are aware of the fmancial hardships faced by many of our students' fanlllies. We realize that many of you make significant sac­rifices in order to allow your daughter to attend Saint Mary's. You can give her no finer gift, nor can you make any better invest­ment in her future," Mooney wrote. 
Raising tuition as well as room and board fees is not the only way Saint Mary's is trying to increase revenues for the College. 
In a press release earlier this week, the College said it is also working to cut expenses in areas that do not affect the classroom experience or student services. They have asked many depart­ments to lower expenses by elimi­nating funding for adnlinistrative

cultural norms. 

"It is important to reevaluate what a leader is not," Fluri said, "Leadership is not about destruc­tive and abusive power." 
In such a circumstance, she said it is necessary for individuals to summon the courage to accompli<>h "uncommon acts" to overcome society's power structures. 
Fluri explained that the prefix "un" is typically considered nega­tive. 
"Reconsider the un," she said. '"Un' presents an alternative to the status quo, moments that require and inspire new thinking." 
In daily life, both leaders and fol­lowers are ready for a change and strive for equality through collective action, Fluri said. She explained that effective leaders are able to articulate the needs of their people, rather than trying to impose goals that are out of touch with social problems. 
It is important to remain critical of conventional wisdom and to "reach across the margin of under­standing," Fluri said. 
Fluri urged people to rethink the Golden Rule. Rather than "do unto others as you would have them do unto you" she said it is better to "do or not do unto others as they would have you do or not do unto them."

The savings will go toward mak­ing tuition more affordable for stu­dents, Meyer said. 
"All money saved from the budg­etary restraints will be put toward fmancial aid. The college will do everything possible to assist our current and future students in these difficult times," Meyer said. 
The Board would like for par­ents to view the tuition increase as a long-term investment that will benefit their daughters for years to come. 
"In trying economic times we want families to understand that this economy will improve and the investment in their daughter's education will pay off," Meyer said. 
Mooney also expressed confi­dence that the College will contin­ue to work to provide a good edu­cation for students in her letter to parents this week. 
"Thank you for the trust you place in us. We do, and will contin­ue to, work hard to merit that trust," she wrote.

Chapman said NDSP did not make any arrest<> when breaking up the parade.

NDSP got involved because the parade was disruptive to students and faculty studying in DeBartolo Hall, Cllapman said.

Senate discusses iTunes U 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Editor 

Manager for academic technolo­gies Paul Turner presented at Wednesday's Student Senate meet­ing ahout using iTunes U -an off­shoot of Apple's iTunes that pub­lishes materials from top universi­ties -to distribute campus lec­tures, sporting events and more for free online. 
Turner said many prominent universities such as Vanderbilt, Duke and Stanford publish content oniTunesU. 
Student government has been working with the administration to create a Notre Dame iTuncs U site. 
Although there is 110 official launch date for the site, Turner said the University has a contract with Apple and material lined up to be published. There is already a Web site, itunes.nd.edu, but the links will not be activated until everything is finalized with the Office of the Provost and the Office of Public Affairs. 
"ITunes U works like the iTunes store, but the main difference is that we have complete control over brand, content and descrip­tions," Turner said. "It's our con­tent, our brand." 
Turner said the University chose 
to have a branch of iTunes U avail­able to the public and a branch that is only accessible to students and faculty. The bulk of the mate­.rial will be in the private sector of 
the site, he said. 

"In my mind, the private site is 
the students' site," he said. "It will 
be a faculty site, but I want stu­
dents to have a major impact on 
what the site looks like and what 
goes out there." 

The site will feature two buttons, 
one accessible to the public and 
one that will require a Notre Dame 
net ID for access, he said. 

Turner said it will be up to facul­
ty to post lecture materials if they 
choose. 

"Our job is to make it easy for 
those faculty members to record 
that content," he said. 

Turner said the material in 
iTunes U will be organized by 
College, subject matter, semester 
and topic to make it easier for peo­
ple to navigate. He said students 
will have the option of subscribing 
to topics that interest them. 
"You can subscribe to individual 
Colleges, like Business or Arts and 
Letters, or even individual sections 
within the College," he said. 
Student Senator Lauren 
Cummings asked Turner how stu­
dents would go about posting con­tent on iTunes U. Turner said this is a process his team is still examining. 
"There's got to be some level of review. The question is, what's that level and who does it," he said. "We really don't want to be in the content-policing business, but we are worried about copyright infringement." 
The University's contract with Apple states that all material pub­lished on iTunes U must adhere to copyright laws, Turner said. 
In other Senate news: 

+ Student body vice president Grant Schmidt announced both of thl'l Last Lectures, delivered by Professors James McKenna and Carl Ackermann, are available online at the student government Website. 
+Student Outreach Committee chair Sarah Rodts said the student survey, set to close Wednesday, garnered about 3,500 responses from students. Rodts said the num­ber is down from the last survey student government conducted, so the survey will remain opened until Friday to receive more input.

The woman moved to the U.S. this week and is no longer willing to talk about the case, her lawyer said Wednesday. Lance Cpl. Daniel Smith, convicted in 2006 of raping the woman and sentenced to 40 years in prison, remains detained at the U.S. Embassy while he pursues an appeal. 
The case strained U.S.-Philippine military relations and became a rallying point for anti-American protesters who have called for the scrapping of a pact that allows U.S. troops to train Filipino soldiers. 
Smith's accuser submitted a five-page affi­davit to an appeals court Tuesday saying she now doubts her own version of events.

Dreyfuss calls attention to battlefields 
WASHINGTON -Oscar-winner Richard Dreyfuss visited the nation's capital on Wednesday to call attention to the most endan­gered Civil War battlefields. 
The actor joined the Civil War Preservation Trust as the group released its annual report on 10 battlefields that it says are deteriorating due to neglect, land development and other threats. 
At a news conference, Dreyfuss said his interest in preserving Civil War battlefields grew out of his love for history and the signifi­cance of the war. 

Suspect of N.C. family slaying dead 
RALEIGH, N.C.-A suspected opium traf­ficker wanted in the slaying of four North Carolina family members shot himself to death after a police chase in Utah and investigators said Wednesday they believe the family killing was related to drug trafficking. 
Authorities also said the surviving husband and father of the slain family may face charges of trafficking drugs, although he is not implicat­ed in the deaths of his wife and three children. 
Authorities named the suspect as Chiew Chan Saevang, 37. They said he killed himself and his girlfriend, Yer Yang, 40, after sheriff's deputies spotted their BMW 325 and gave chase late Tuesday on an interstate highway in Utah. The car crashed and caught fire and deputies who pulled them from the wreckage found them dead.

Sen. Lugar on all-time voting list 
INDIANAPOLIS -Sen. Dick Lugar has cast his 12,000th vote, moving him to 13th place on the all-time Senate voting list. 
Lugar, the longest serving U.S. Senator in Indiana history, cast the vote Wednesday during debate on a bill gov­erning acquisition of public land. 
The six-term senator voted against a motion to table an amendment that would have directed purchases from willing sell­ers instead of eminent domain. The motion was defeated 63-35.

in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana to race. 
Steves, who will race in the Men's B, is set to complete a 50­mile road race Saturday and a 40­minute cr.iterium Sunday. He has eight individual victories under his spandex belt, and traveled to Nationals his sophomore year. 
He is one of the dozen or so seri­ous riders for Notre Dame who dedicate hours each day to train­ing. 
Senior captain Tim Campbell, an A cyclist, has been racing for Notre Dame since his freshman year. He said he and his team­mates will compete in both of the weekend's events. 
"I ride pretty much everyday," he said. "To be at the top level, you need to ride everyday." 
Campbell's two-day program of a 70-mile road race and a 65­minute criterium is standard for a competition weekend, he said. 
The cyclists, Campbell included, are excited for their first race at home. 
"This is something I've wanted to do since my sophomore year, when I figured out how to go

movement. 
Christine Romero, a junior and Right to Life's legislative commis­sioner, called the bill "extremely radical, really draconian," and said that through the postcard cam­paign, students can "let our con­gressmen know that we feel it is inappropriate." 
Romero said the dub is working with Campus Mini'itry and dorms to facilitate the effort. Postcards, which are produced by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, are sent to congressmen, stating the constituent's opposition to FOCA. 
The club ordered 12,000 post­cards, Romero said. She noted that each person is able to send three to members of Congress -one to each of his state's Senators and one to his Representative. \ 
Wednesday night, representatives from the club gathered signatures outside both South and North din­ing halls. 
"We had a really great turnout," Romero said. She estimated around 1,200 individual postcards were signed. 
In addition, Romero said that Campus Ministry has facilitated the distribution of postcards to every dorm through Campus Ministry commissioners. 

Petition 
continued from page 1 
Dewey said she believes the group submitted the petition too close to the end of the year, which contributed to the lack of a response from the administra­tion. She said this year, the group sought to present the petition early enough that the adminis­tration has ample time to respond. 
The group's next step depends on Jenkins' response. 
"We want to work with the administration in this matter," Dewey said. "But if we get a neg­ative response, ~ want to demonstrate that there is student support with actions like rallies, but that is really a last resort." 

about having a race at your school," he said. 
Figuring out how to "go through all the hoops" at the University took a while, he said. "Now it's fmally happening." 
Notre Dame cyclists typically compete about seven weekends, or in 14 races, a year in their eon­ference, Campbell said. 
"There are also non-collegiate races people at the top end up doing," he said. "We can race any­where between 12 and 13 week­ends a year." 
Individual cyclists and the team as a whole can earn points in the A division through the season to qualiJY for Nationals, which will be held in Colorado. 
Campbell has been to Nationals twice, but said he's not sure if the team will make the trip this year. 
Because of the team's club sta­tus at the University, they are not permitted to take part in activities after study days. 
"It's hard to have teachers move your tests," he said. 
Another big race for cyclists all across the nation takes place in Arkansas early in May, Campbell said. 
"It's kind of like the Tour de France, but 18 days shorter," he said. "That's the best race going on in the country -hopefully. Notre Dame will be there." 
In addition to supporters who mail their own cards, Right to Life, as well as some individual dorms, will fund the cost of postage, according to Romero and Brett Perkins, director of Catholic Peer Ministry for Campus Ministry. 
"Our mission is one of solidarity with the voiceless and underprivi­leged, both women and unborn children," Perkins said. The post­cards convey a mes.<>age to oflicials that FOCA "is a poor piece of legis­lation, is clearly an offense to life ... and does not promote the well being of women, let along their w1born children." 
Angela Rossi, Campus Ministry commissioner lor Cavanaugh Hall, said that her dorm was provided with 300 postcards, available for residents to sign. cavanaugh will send the cards and pay the postage with discretionary funds, she said. 
Rossi said the postcards coming from Notre Dame could have "a large effect," pointing out that stu­-dents hail from all 50 states and have a diverse mix of congressmen and women. 
Rossi said there has already been a response in Cavanaugh, but "par­ticipation could be greater than what it is." 
"Maybe people are not aware enough, or maybe people don't understand everything about !this act]," she said. 
Mary Daly, a junior and president of Right to Life, said that she knows Right to life supporters are aware of the legislation, but was unsure how much other students knew aboutFOCA 
"My general impression is that people have heard of it. The extent to which people are awarn of the detail<>-pnople aren't as aware of that," she said. 
Daly said some people ar!,rue the bill is unlikely to pass through con­gress, due to the many controversial provisions it indudes, but Daly said there is value in voicing opposition to the bill. "letting [legislators! know that people are against it, despite the smm~!ng impracticality of lit's passage!. 
Romero said the response from Wednesday's postcard drive was mostly positive. 
"A surprising amount of students already knew what FOCA was with­out us explaining it," she said. 
Perkins agreed that he believes most students are. aware "of the potential that FOCA legislation could bn brought before eongrnss, either in its entirnty or piecemeal." 
Overall, he said, "the msponsn to the campaign has been very favor­able." 
Homero said that Hight to Life would be eollecting mmaining eards from dorms that chose not to lund postage, and would mail them in the coming wenk'i.

Flores asked group members to be silent when presenting the petition in the Office of the President in order to show respect for the University. When the group arrived in the oflice, Jenkins was not present, but the petition was taken by a repre­sentative of the Oflice. 
In addition to asking for sexual orientation to be a part of the non-discrimination clause, the group outlined two other goals in a letter presented with the peti­tio~: official club status for OUTreach ND and Alliance ND, groups which provide support for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgen­der and questioning (GLBTQ) students on campus and increased attention to hate crimes directed against GLBTQ memb&s of the Notre Dame community. 
Though the Cycling Club hopes for spectators, Campbell said his expectations aren't that high because of people's misunder­standing of the sport. 
"Everyone knows Lance Armstrong ... I'm hoping, with [him], people are coming back to the sport and trying to understand what the sport of cycling is all about," he said. "It's a good chance to come out and check out what Lance Armstrong really does ... exc~pt we'll be doing it a lot slower. 
Regardless of spectator turnout, for the black and green argyle spandex-dad Notre Dame cyclists, this weekend's races will be a dis­play of their work this year. 
"You're out there, two to three hours everyday, a lot of times by yourself riding into the wind," he said. "This weekend, we'll see the fruits of our labor." 
The club's Facebook event, "le Tour·de Notre Dame du Lac," includes information about volun­teering at the races as well as directions and fliers about each day's events. 
"If someone wants to volunteer or needs a ride out there, we can definitely arrange that," Campbell said.

"I think these issues are basic common sense," Dewey said. 
Flores said the group generally received positive feedback from students who were asked to sign the petition, but were also met with a few dissenters. Most did not give a reason, but declined to sign the petition, she said. 
The pHtition also in dudes a· small number of faculty signa­tures, Flores said. 
"We asked a few faculty mem­bers who we already knew were interested," she said. 
Flores said many students they approached about signing the petition did not realize how the absence of sexual orientation in the clause affects members of the Notre Dame community.

IN BRIEF Kellogg official calls for revamp 
WASHINGTON -The top official at Kellogg, the giant food-maker who lost $70 million worth of peanut products in the recent salmo­nella outbreak, is urging lawmakers to over­haul the nation's food safety system. 
Kellogg Co. chief executive David Mackay wants food safety placed under a new leader in the Health and Human Services Department. He also called for new require­ments that all food companies have written safety plans, annual federal inspections of facilities that make high-risk foods, and other reforms. 
Mackay's strong endorsement of major changes could boost President Barack Obama's efforts to overhaul the system. Last week Obama launched a special review of food safety programs, which are split among several departments and agencies, and rely in some cases on decades-old laws. Critics say more funding is needed for inspections and basic research. , 


Madoffs accountant arrested on fraud 
NEW YORK -Bernard Madoff's longtime accountant was arrested on fraud charges Wednesday as authorities blamed him for failing to make the most basic auditing checks th.at would have exposed an epic fraud that cost investors billions of dollars. 
David Friehling is the first person to be arrested in the scandal since Madoff turned 
'-himself in, and his prosecution signals that the government is intent on bringing Madoff's associates to justice as they try to figure out who helped him carry out the fraud. Prosecutors say the 49-year-old Friehling essentially rubber-stamped Madoff's books for 17 years, serving as Madoff's auditor from 1991 through 2008 while operating from a discreet building in suburban New York. Authorities said that if Friehling had done his·job, Madoff's financial statements would have shown his company owed tens of bil­lions of dollars to his customers and was insolvent. "Mr. Friehling's deception helped foster the illusion that Mr. Madoff legitimately invested his clients' money," said acting U.S. Attorney Lev L. Dassin.

CHINA 


Soldier's story offers a neW" look at Tianantnen 
Associated Press 
TENGZHOU -Even 20 years later, the shooting, chaos and death of the final assault on 11ananmen Square remain vivid in the mind of former soldier Zhang Shijun. Today, he has become one of the few to publicly voice regret. 
In bearing witness about his role in the military crackdown on the 1989 student demonstrations in Beijing, Zhang says he hopes to add momentum to calls for an investigation and reassessment of the protest movement -and to further its ultimate goal of a demo­cratic China. 
"I feel like my spirit is stuck there on the night of June 3," Zhang, 40, said in an interview at his home in the dusty northern city of Tengzhou, referring to the date in 1989 when the final assault began. 
Zhang's tortured memories have gained a global audience among China's dissident community in the weeks since he posted an open let­ter online to the Communist Party leader, President Hu Jintao. In it, he relates some of what he saw when posted on the night of June 3-4, along with an account of the persecution he underwent after asking for an early discharge, and his belief that China must eventu­ally clear its collective conscience of the tragic events. 
"The responsibility can't just be laid on the military," Zhang said. "It's really the responsibility of all Chinese." 
Zhang was just 18 when he' joined the elite 54th Group Army's 162nd Motorized Infantry Division based in the central city of Anyang. Less than three years later, with student-led protests gathering pace, Zhang's units were ordered to Beijing on April 20, 1989. There, they camped on the capital's southwestern edge while citizens erected barricades to block their progress toward Tiananmen, the vast square in the heart of the city where the stu­
dents had established their head­
quarters. 
On June 3, their orders came: 
Drive through to the square and 
get it cleared. 
Heading ea'>t toward the square, 
Zhang and his comrades aban­
doned their vehicles as bricks and 
rocks flew at thoir heads and bul­
lets were fired at them by 
unknown shooters from upper sto­
ries of apartmm1t buildings. 
Members of his unit fired over the 
heads of civilians as a warning, 
according to Zhang, who said he 
was serving as a medic and was 
unarmed in the final assault. 
Zhang said he knew of no deaths caused by the troops of the 54th army-a claim impossible to disprove as long &'> ollicial files on the events remain dosed. Most of 
,the post-crackdown reports pinned the hundreds, possibly thousands of deaths among civil­ians and students on two other units, the 27th and 38th group armies based outside Beijing. 
By daylight the next morning, Zhang said his unit established a cordon along the square's south­ern edge between a KFC restau­rant and the mausoleum of com­munist China's founder, Mao Zedong. 
Zhang said other details were still too sensitive to tell, suggesting atrocities such as the shooting in the back of unarmed students and civilians. While other eyewitnesses have made similar allegations, they remain impossible to inde­pendently confirm. 
After their withdrawal, Zhang said he asked for and eventually obtained an early discharge, never having expected to be sent to fight ordinary Chinese citizens. After returning to Tengzhou he began a discussion group promoting mar­ket economics and politics, but was arrested on March 14, 1992 and sentenced to three years in a labor camp for political crimes. Then, as now, he regarded the charges as trumped-up retribution for his leaving the unit early.

"It's like trying to put togeth­er a big puzzle," said Coy Heid, ehief deputy with North Carolina's Catawba County Sheriffs Office. "They could've finished the rest of the pieces. We still have a lot to tie up and finish in the investiga­tion." 
Authorities said that investi­gation could ultimately end with Saephan's husband fac­ing charges of traffieking drugs. Although he is not implicated in his family's slay­ings, detectives suggested that Brian Tzeo's involvement in a trafficking ring with the sus­pects may have been behind the attacks. 
"The information we have suggests the father was a drug distributor," Heid said. "He has cooperated with us. And we're not at liberty to talk about that right now. It's an ongoing investigation." 
Tzeo hung up when reached by phone. 
Seven minutes after North Carolina authorities put out a national alert with Saevang's license plate, Utah deputies in Washington County spotted his car on Interstate 15 near the southwestnrn border with Arizona headed west. As deputies gave chase, Saevang's BMW hit another car, went up an embankment, stopped on a hillside and eaught lire. Saevang· had fatal­ly shot himself and the 40­year-old Yang, who authorities said was an accomplice in sell­ing drugs and the killings. 
Detectives in North Carolina learned of tho deaths as they prepared arrest wa·rrants for Saevang for murder and for Yang for aceessory after the fact to murder. Heid said days of poring over notes and tak­ing in tips, including those generated by the case's appearance on "America's Most Wanted," led them to the couple. Both were also expect­ed to have been charged with conspiracy to snll opium. 
Authorities said Tzeo would receive opium through the mail from Thailand, convert it to heroin and give it to Yang who lived in Long View, in Catawba County. She would take the heroin to Saevang in Wisconsin, where he would sell it, they said. 
Kelly 0 Driseoll, spokes­woman for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, told the Wisconsin State Journal that Saevang had ties to the Schofield, Wis .. area, about 130 miles north .of Madison. 
"There was some drug dis­tribution that came out of that house," N.C. State Bureau of Investigation spokesman Dave Call said about the North Carolina home. 
Investigators would not dis­euss dntails about what led Saevang to kill Tzeo's family in the community about 40 miles northwest of Charlotte. They havi~ said Tzeo was at work when his family was killed. Cody was found shot to death at the kitchen table, his fin­gers still inside his cereal bowl. 
Funerals were held Wednesday afternoon for the victims in nearby Newton. Tzeo has said he wants to take his family back to California for burial, but authorities have not said whether they would allow him to leave the state. 
Authorities found the victims after a friend of Pauline's called 911, screaming and sobbing as she told the opera­tor Pauline had just been pulled into her home and stabbed by a man. The friend had picked up Pauline for school that morning, but they went back after the friend said she had seen a suspieious man o1:1tside the house. 
Tzeo has said he and his wife had separated and that he had an affair but they were still living together and trying to work things out. 
Yang's criminal history showed convictions ftlr forgery and larceny and several charges related to obtaining property by false pretense. Saevang faced several charges of trafficking in opium in Catawba County over the last six years.

Fed to pump funds into housing market 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK --The Federal 
Reserve kept Wall Street's big 
rally alive -and gave the 
Treastrry market a huge boost as 
well. 
Both markets surged Wednesday after the Fed said it would pump more than $1 trillion into the economy to help revive the housing market. The plan includes buying up to $300 billion of long-term government bonds during the next six months. 
Investors expect the move to 
drive down borrowing costs for 
everything from mortgages to 
credit cards. The Dow Jones 
industrial average reversed early 
losses to end up 91 points and the 
yield on the benchmark 10-year 
Treasury note plunged, indicating 
strong demand for the note. 
The dollar also fell sharply as 
investors worried the govern­
ment's actions would eventually 
fan inflation. 
The Fed's move, analysts said, is 
likely to produce an immediate 
drop in mortgage rates, of 0.25 to 
0.5 percent percentage points. The central bank also made clear it would be able to purchase the majority of new mortgage-backed securities for at least the rest of the year, possibly longer. 
That's great news for those bor­rowers with good incomes and healthy credit scores who are able to qualify for a loan. But dramati­cally tighter lending standards have made it tough for many bor­rowers to qualifY. 
Still, it was a plus for the hous­ing industry, which many analysts believe must recover in order for the overall economy to prosper again. Homebuilder and financial company stocks shot higher on the news, which came a day after the Commerce Department reported better-than-expected housing start numbers for February. 
The s"heer magnitude of the Fed's proposal "indicates they have a lot of weapons still in the arsenal," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. 
The Fed said it would build on a plan to buy mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It also will buy an additional $750 billion, bringing its total purchases of these securities to $1.25 trillion. It also will boost its purchase of Fannie and FredcUe debt to $200 billion. 
The Fed's announcement accompanied its decision to keep interest rates at historically low levels. Chairman Ben Bernanke has said in recent weeks that the recession could end this year if the credit and fmancial markets can be stabilized. Bernanke and other officials have said they would deploy whatever tools nec­essary to revive the economy. 
"They are certainly, assertively doing everything they can to inter­vene," said David Darst, chief investment strategist of Morgan Stanley's Global Wealth Management Group. 
The Dow Jones industrial aver­age rose 90.88, or 1.2 percent, to 7,486.58. 
Broader stock indicators also jumped. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 16.23, or 2.1 percent, to 794.35, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 29.11, or 2 percent, to 1,491.22. 
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies jumped 14.04, or 3.5 percent, to 417.63. 
More than four stocks rose for every one that fell on the New 
York Stock Exchange, where con­
solidated volume came to a heavy 
9 billion shares compared with 6 
billion shares traded Tuesday. 
The market had traded lower 
ahead of the Fed's decision. 
Stocks have risen for six out of 
the last seven days. Since the 
market rally began last week, the 
Dow has jumped 14.4 percent, 
and the S&P 500 has soared 17.4 
percent. Those are the types of 
gains that would normally make 
tor a great year in the stock mar­
ket. 
Government bond prices surged. The yield on the bench­mark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, tumbled to 2.50 percent from 3.01 percent late Tuesday. The yield on the three-month T-hill, considered one of the safest investments, slipped to 0.20 percent from 0.22 percent late Tuesday. 
The dollar fell agai-nst other 
major currencies. Gold prices also 
slid as demand for safe haven 
holdings fell. 
For both the stock and bond markets, the Fed's announcement was a welcome surprise. After th.e last Fed meeting in January, poli­cy makers said they were consid­ering buying government debt. But investors were skeptical the Fed would actually go through with it. 
"We've suffered over the last month or so with disappointment that a lot of the initiatives out of the administration haven't materi­alized, and here is the Fed moving in with very strong actions to get things back on track," McCain said. 
The Fed move -which econo­mists call "quantitative easing" ­is another way to push interest rates lower by essentially adding more money to the financial sys­tem. The Fed is using this tool now since its other main policy lever, the federal funds rate, has already been ratcheted down as low as it can go. 
Bank stocks -including Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. -got an extra boost after the Fed announcement. The Fed's actions are intended to keep interest rates low and also to unfreeze borrow­ing activity, which could be a huge help for banks. 
Citi and Bank of America each jumped more than 22 percent, while Wells Fargo rose 17.5 per­cent and JPMorgan added 7.8 percent. . 
Home builders put up huge gains as well. Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. jumped 50 per­cent to $1.44, while Toll Brothers Inc. rose 5.7 percent. Home improvement retailers jumped as well. Home Depot Inc. rose 5.1 percent and Lowe's Cos. added 
4.7 percent. 
Technology stocks rose on news that International Business Machines Corp. is in discussions to buy Sun Microsystems Inc. for at least $6.5 billion in cash. Sun sky­rocketed 79 percent, rising $3.92 to $8.89. IBM fell 96 cents, or 1 percent, to $91.95. 
Investors are growing more hopeful that the rally in stocks might have staying power, though many remain cautious. Stocks gained 20 percent from late November until the start of the year, only to come crashing down to levels not seen in more than a decade as worries grew about the stability of the financial system and the economy's ability to turn higher. 
YEMEN 
Bomber strikffi South Korean officials 
Associated Press 
SAN'A -A suicide bomber on Wednesday struck a convoy carrying South KorPan officials sent to Yemen to investigate a bombing earlier in the week that killed four tourists from the country. 
The well-coordinated attack was specifically designed to target the South Koreans, ofli­cials said. The three-ear con­voy was carrying South Korean oflicials and investigators sent to look into a suicide bombing on Sunday that killed four South Korean tourists and their Yemeni driver at a histor­ical site. No onP was hurt, ofli­eials said. 
The South Korean Foreign Ministry confirmed Wednesday's attack and said the convoy was also carrying rPlatives of the victims of Sunday's attack. They were in the country to recover the bod­ies of those killed in that attack and were headed to the airport for a flight to return to South Korea when the bomber struck. 
Yemen, an impoverished country in the southwestern corner . of the Arabian Peninsula, is Osama bin Laden's ancestral homeland and has long been a center of militant activity. 
A Yemeni security official said South Korea's ambassador to the country was also in the convoy hit Wednesday. but in Seoul, the Foreign Ministry denied that. 
The bomber walked into the road between two of the vehi­cle;; and blew himself up as the convoy was traveling to the airport outside the capital, San'a, the Yemeni official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press. The blast shattered the windows of the vehicles. 
Yemeni authorities said al­Qaida was behind Sunday's suicide bombing near the ancient fortress city of Shibam and that 12 suspects were arrested.

Actress Richardson ditsofhead injury 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Natasha Richardson, a gifted and preco­cious heiress to acting royalty whose career highlights includ­ed the film "Patty Hearst" and a Tony-winning performance in a stage revival of "Cabaret," died Wednesday at age 45 after suf­fering a head injury during a beginners' ski lesson. 
Alan Nierob, the Los Angeles­based publicist for Richardson's husband Liam Neeson, con­firmed her death in a written statement. 
"Liam Neeson, his sons (Micheal, 13, and 12-year-old Daniel), and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha," the statement said. "They are profoundly grateful for the support, love and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very dif­ficult time." 
The statement did not give details on the cause of death for Richardson, who suffered a head injury and fell on a begin­ner's trail during a private ski lesson at the luxury Mont Tremblant ski resort in Quebec. Seemingly fine after the fall, about an hour later she com­plained that she didn't feel well. 
She was hospitalized Tuesday in Montreal and later flown to a hospital in New York, where family members had been seen coming and going. 
Vanessa Redgrave, Richardson's mother, arrived in a car with darkened windows and was taken through a garage when she arrived at the Lenox Hill Hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side about 5 p.m. Wednesday. An hour earlier, Richardson's sis­ter, Joely, arrived alone and was swarmed by the media as she entered through the back of the hospital. 
It was a sudden and horrify­ing loss for her family and friends, for the film and theater communities, for her many fans and for both her native and adoptive countries. Descended from at least three generations of actors, Richardson was a proper Londoner who came to love the noise of New York, an elegant blonde with large, lively eyes, a bright smile and a hearty laugh. 
If she never quite attained the acting heights of her Academy Award-winning mother, she still had enjoyed a long and worthy career. As an actress, Richardson was equally adept at passion and restraint, able to portray besieged women both confessional (Tennessee Williams' Blanche DuBois) and confined (the concubine in the futuristic horror of "The Handmaid's Tale"). 
Like other family members, she divided her time between stage and screen. On Broadway, she won a Tony for her per­formance as Sally Bowles in a 1998 revival of "Cabaret." She also appeared in New York in. a production of Patrick Marber's "Closer" (1999) as well as 2005 revival of Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire," in which she played Blanche oppo­site John C. Reilly's Stanley Kowalski. 
She met Neeson when they made their Broadway debuts in 1993, co-starring in "Anna Christie," Eugene O'Neill's drama about a former prosti­tute and the sailor who falls in love with her. 
"The astonishing Natasha Richardson ... gives what may prove to be the performance of the season as Anna, turning a heroine who has long been por­trayed (and reviled) as a whore with a heart of gold into a tough, ruthlessly unsentimental apostle of O'Neill's tragic under­standing of life," The New York Times critic Frank Rich wrote. "Miss Richardson, seeming more like a youthful incarnation of her mother, Vanessa Redgrave, than she has before,· is riveting from her first entrance through a saloon doorway's ethereal shaft of golden light." 
Her most notable film roles came earlier in her career. Richardson played the title character in Paul Schrader's "Patty Hearst," a 1988 biopic about the kidnapped heiress for which the actress became so immersed that even between scenes she wore a blindfold, the better to identifY with her real­life counterpart. 
"Natasha Richardson ... has been qanded a big unwritten role; she feels her way into it, and she fills it," wrote The New Yorker's Pauline Kael. "We feel how alone and paralyzed Patty is -she retreats into being a hidden observer." 
Governor signs death penalty ban 
New Mexico is second state to outlaw executions since reinstatement oflaw in 1976 
Associated Press 
SANTA FE -Gov. Bill Richardson signed legislation Wednesday repealing New Mexico's death penalty, mak­ing it the second state to ban executions since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. 
Richardson, a Democrat who formerly supported capi­tal punishment, said signing the bill was the "most diffi­cult decision" of his political life but that "the potential for ... execution of an innocent person stands as anathema to our very sensibilities as human beings." 
Richardson said he made the decision after going to the state penitentiary, where he saw the death chamber and visited the maximum security unit where those sentenced to life without parole could be housed. 
"My conclusion was those cells are something that may be worse than death," he said. "I believe this is a just punishment." 
The repeal, which passed the state Senate by a 24-18 vote Friday and was approved by the House a month earlier, takes effect 
July 1 and will apply to crimes committed after that date. Once in effect, the most severe punishment will be a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
"Faced with the reality that our system for imposing the death penalty can never be perfect, my conscience com­pels me to replace the death penalty with a solution that keeps society safe," Richardson told a news con­ference in the state Capitol. 
With Richardson signing the measure, New Mexico joins 14 other states that do not impose capital punish­ment. New Jersey, in 2007, was the first and only other state to outlaw capital pun­ishment since its reinstate­ment by the Supreme Court. 
Since 1960, New Mexico has executed only one per­son, child killer Terry Clark, in 2001. Under the outgoing law, the death sentence could be applied in cases where children, law enforcement and correctional officials, and. witnesses were murdered. 
The sentences of two men currently on death row will not' be affected by the new law.

Actorsaves 
manfalling off subway platform 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-An actor on his way to a reading jumped onto subway tracks to rescue a man who tumbled off a platform as a train approached. 
"I just thought the guy fell down there and I needed to get him out of there," said Chad Lindsey, 33. 
The rescue happened Monday at busy Pennsylvania Station, wh-ere Lindsey was waiting for a train as he headed to a theater down­town. He said he saw a man who appeared drunk come very close to the platform, rock back and forth, then pitch headlong onto the tracks. 
The man struck his head on the rail and began bleeding 
· profusely, Lindsey said. He said he jumped down to the tracks and tried to rouse the man. When he didn't respond, Lindsey lifted him under the arms and hoisted him onto the platform, with the help of others standing on the platform. The rescue, first reported in The New York Times, last­ed about 30 seconds, bring­ing Lindsey some instant ­and overwhelming-publici­ty. "I'm an actor. I've spent most of my life trying to get attention and then I do some­thing that's a no-brainer, and now I have more than I need," he said Wednesday. Lindsey stars in an off­Broadway musical, "Kaspar Hauser." He said the role prepared him well for the emergency because he's required in the play to repeatedly lift a character who can't walk. He said he could see the lights of the train approach­ing and about 15 seconds later -after the man was safely on the platform -the cars arrived in the station. Someone had already called 
911. After giving police a quick report, Lindsey board­ed the train, where passen­gers greeted him with applause. 
Lindsey said he didn't know if his newfound fame would boost his career. 
"I really wasn't thinking about that at the time. I real­ly wasn't thinking about it at all even afterward," said Lindsey, who also works as a proofreader. "I sort of just did it and thought afterward, 'Well, that's just a pain, now I'm all dirty and bloody."' 
The injured man was treat­ed at a hospital and released. 
The rescue was reminiscent of another subway hero, Wesley Autrey, who in 2007 jumped on top of a man who had fallen onto the tracks after having a seizure. The train passed over the two of them. 
Autrey, a construction worker, was awarded the city's highest civilian honor and invited to President George W. Bush's State of the Union address. 
Harbor porpoise evades rescuers 
Associated Press 
LITTLE EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP, N.J. -Bobbing up and down in a placid lagoon, the young harbor porpoise faced off against a dozen people, four boats, two nets and hundreds of thou­sands of dollars worth of equipment, all closing in on it Wednesday morning. 
Everyone feared it needed to be rescued. 
It glided below the surface, heading straight for a 20­foot-wide net stretched between two boats. Its cap­ture seemed inevitable. 
At the last minute, it dove deep, darting through a 2­foot gap between the mucky lagoon bottom and the edge of the net, heading back out 

to deeper water. 
"This is a healthy animal 

that doesn't need to be 
picked up," said Bob 
Schoelkopf, co-director of the 
Marine Mammal Stranding 
Center. His group had joined 
with the Marine Mammal & 
Sea Turtle Hescue Program 
from Hiverhead, N.Y., to try 
to capture the animal. 
"Because of how easily it 

evaded us, we've determined 
it is not in any trouble at this 
time," Schoelkopf said. 
The story started about a week and a half ago when the porpoise was first spot­.ted in lagoons in Little Egg Harbor Township and Tuckerton, about 20 miles 
north of Atlantic City. 
There was reason for con­

cern: It was a young animal, 
and had become separated from its pod, Schoelkopf said. ­
It's unusual, though not unheard of, for porpoises to inhabit lagoons, Schoelkopf said. It has happened in coastal communities outside Atlantic City, as well as on Long Island, N.Y. 
The plan was to sidle up to the porpoise, either in a large aluminum rescue boat or in one of three inflatable speedboat rafts, and toss a large net over the animal. 
They would bring it to shore in a padded sling, weight it on a 15-foot-tall scale s·uspended on a steel tripod, and take blood tests to see if the animal was sick or injured. 
But the porpoise had other ideas. 

"He seems very playful," said Bon Baker, who has watched the porpoise in the lagoon behind his house for about 10 days. "I think he found the area to his liking, and he probably wants to spend some time here." 
That's exactly what Schoelkopf plans to let it do. The 3-foot-long porpoise weighs about 40 or 50 pounds, and looks to be in good health. 
Schoelkopf said porpoises follow schools of herring and mackerel up the East Coast at this time of year, and noted the lagoons provide abundant food. When the porpoise runs of food or tires of the area, it will probably leave on its own. 

Phishing scams look real, but don't be fooled. 
They're an attempt to steal your identity.

Mexican tariffs take effect on U.S. products 
Associated Press 
MEXICO CITY-U.S. officials are assessing the cost of new Mexican tariffs that take effect Thursday in retaliation for a 
U.S. 
decision to ·cancel a cross­border program that gave Mexican truckers access to their northern neighbor's high­ways. 

The tariffs affect about $2.4 billion in annual trade and 89 

U.S. 
products, ranging from fruit and wine to washing machines, according to the Mexican government. Assistant Economy Secretary Beatriz Leycegui warned the list could grow unless there is progress toward resolving the trucking dispute. 


The U.S. was required under the North American Free Trade Agreement to grant Mexican trucks full access to its high­ways by January 2000, but domestic opposition led U.S. legislators to delay the opening until a pilot program allowing some trucks was instituted in 2007. 
r 

The U.S. ended that program 
last week -a move that 
Mexican Economy Secretary 
Gerardo Ruiz Mateos called 
"wrong, protectionist and a 
clear violation" of NAFTA. The 
1994 agreement allows Mexico 
to introduce retaliatory tariffs 
equal to the amount of trade 
lost by the truck ban. 
Many U.S. officials and 
exporters responded with con­
cern. 

"In good times, an economy 
may be able to weather this 
kind of thing. But now it's dev­
astating," said Rep. Dave Camp 
of Michigan, whose district is 
home to cherry farmers, manu­
facturers and chemical produc­
ers such as Dow Chemical Co. 
that will be affected. 
The tariffs apply to 36 agri­
cultural and 53 industrial prod­
ucts, including onions, straw­
berries, shampoo, toothpaste, 
pet food, book~. pencils and 
dishwashers. The only item fac­
ing a 45-percent tax is fresh 
grapes. Some 55 other products will be taxed at 20 percent, and the remaining 33 items at 10 to 15 percent. 
NAFTA normally exempts agricultural products from such duties. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture was still assessing the cost of the tariffs. 
"We have alerted all the industry associations that rep­resent these producers, the state regional groups and agri­culture trade advisory groups so that we can continue to work with them as we assess the effects the tariffs will have on the markets," said Nayyera Haq, a USDA spokeswoman. 
Mexican officials appear to have targeted products from states represented by lawmak­ers who are influential in Congress or have some kind of voice on trade issues. 
For example, sunflower seeds, which appear on the tar­iff list, are produced in North Dakota -the home state of Sen. Byron Dorgan, who authored the language that ended spending on the Mexican trucks pilot program. 
"In these challenging eco­nomic times, we need more open markets, not higher tar­iffs," said Brian Black, a Texas Agriculture Department spokesman. "We are asking President Obama and his Mexican counterpart to resolve, this issue as soon as possible." 
Mexico is Texas' No. 1 trading partner -and the second biggest buyer of U.S. exports. 
In one of the last and largest NAFTA-related disputes, the 
U.S. has long delayed granting Mexican trucks access to its roads. Mexico brought the case before a dispute-resolution panel, which ruled in its favor in 2001. 
But the Teamsters union, U.S. consumer groups and inde­pendent insurers have warned that Mexican trucks are unsafe and lobbied Congress to keep them out. Many unions also voiced fears that U.S. drivers would lose work if lower-paid Mexican truckers could carry goods across the United States.

My mom casually asked me, "How's your Lent going?" Like, in the same tone she would ask, "How are the Irish doing?" I wonder, does she ask my younger brother how his Lent is going, or is this a ques­tion reserved for 
Fr. Lou Delfra
her son the priest? How's my 

Faithpoint
Lent going? How do you answer that? 

Funny what I learned while I listened to myself answering my mother. The only way I could think to evaluate my Lent was whether I had faithfully refrained from eating chocolate. "Pretty good so far," I answered. I guess I could have_determined ifl had eaten meat on any Friday's, but being an Italian pasta-lover, this isn't a par­ticularly difficult practice for me, and so hardly a helpful measure of the suc­cessfulness of my Lent. With that quick Lenten-scan, I was ready to move on, allow my mother some time to recite her litany of grandchildren stories. 
A few days later, however, I found myself bugged by our conversation, or more specifically, by my evaluation of Lent. Ia that all there is to Lent? A con­test to check my self-restraint? I'm all for an annual self-examination, but at the end of the day, if the only person I have thought of during Lent is myself, have I really entered into Lent? 
With this question in mind, I was preparing the readings for Mass last week, and unsuspectingly had my world rocked by the first reading. It was from Isaiah, and he wasn't happy: 
"Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you please 
and exploit others.... 
Is this the kind of fast I have chosen, says the Lord? Is it only for ... lyiug on sackcloth and ashes? 
Is that what you call a fast, 
a day acceptable to the Lord? 
Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? 
Is it not to share your food with the hungry 
and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter -when you see the naked, to clothe him, 
and not to turn away?" 
I re-read the passage in semi-panic, but could find no reference to choco­late. Maybe some biblical commentary or perhaps a new translation would reveal that this passage was, in its proper historical context, about giving up chocolate, but the chances seemed bleak. At some point, I was going to have to wrestle with the hard fact of the matter: Lenten fasting is not meant to end in mere self-reflection, self­evaluation, or self-anything-else. It is meant to end in others; and in the Other. It is meant to end in love of neighbor and love of God. It is meant 
to end in hunger -for peace and jus­
tice. It is meant to end in Christ's con­
stant teaching to "lose our life that we 
may find it." 
Isaiah's poignant words are meant to awaken and arouse us, to challenge and unsettle us this Lent. They call us to refocus our hearts on what truly sets us free and brings us real joy­giving ourselves away in love to God and others, struggling for true and lasting justice, which alone brings true and lasting freedom and peace. 
Our individual Lenten self-denials are excellent little ways to deny our­selves, to lose ourselves, to remind us to lose our lives in love of God and service of others, so that we might find Life. This is the promise of Jesus' teaching, and this is the example of Jesus' death and resurrection-the moment of losing ourselves is the moment of gaining Life. 
How's my Lent going? I'm not sure anymore. But I know that if I am the only person who shows up in my answer, I haven't reached the heart of Lent yet.

Tonya and the red shoes 
Trinity College runs on trimesters. Spring Break is three weeks, and we're in the middle of it. 
Spring Break last year, for some of us, was 10 days overseas. In some ways, we're still in the middle of 
Katherine

that one, too. 
Khorey

Some ofyou have just gotten 
Both Sides Now 
back from the same trip. If you're anything like me, music and bread are, for some time, going to sound and taste like they never have done before. 
You may be a while, too, in forming any coherent responses. 
This, after a while, was mine. 
*** 
I only recently started to like shoes, 
so my collection, though it fills the floor of my closet, could still be called limited. Most of mine are brown or black: one pair is silver. But there are girls who've been building their acces­sory portfolios much longer, who have a double layer of shoes on their closet floors, maybe one pair of heels and one of flats to match every sweater. 
I have beeq trying to expand, though. For a long time, now, I've been looking for a pair of red heels to bring out the accents in one of my for­mal dresses. 
I did end up finding a pair over last year's Spring Break. But they belong to someone else. 
I don't really know who she was, or 
U WIRE 
how frequently she liked to wear them, or what she wore them with. But almost 70 years after she took them off for the last time, I found them in a place I'd never expected. 
*** 

We'd been studying this place in class. It was horrific, as were other places like it, and we'd read and heard so much about the horror that the sto­ries had begun to repeat themselves. I thought at this point, when we walked through these places, I might actually be numb to them. 
At that point it was only history. 
After half a semester of readings, lectures, and quizzes, last year's Holocaust class left for our Spring Break trip to Europe. On the second day we visited Majdanek, a concentra­tion camp a few hours outside Warsaw. Majdanek isn't as big as Auschwitz, or as geared to tourists. But still, as we heard once again on the bus ride over, it'd hosted cruelty and death. Some of us would go on to write papers about it. 
Back on campus we'd spent the past weeks trudging from building to build­ing through snow and ice, the wind cutting straight through our heavy jackets. Now, still shaking off jet lag, we were trudging from building to building through mud and very cold rain. We talked later about what work­ing barefoot in that weather would be like. I almost went through the tour coatless, for solidarity, but decided that'd be melodramatic and unneces­sary. And I was cold enough as it was. 
Toward the beginning we went through the men's "bath house", and saw the delousing tubs, and the show­ers. Then, in the same building, we saw a gas chamber. There were turquoise stains on the walls. 
Then we saw the living quarters. And a model of the whole camp. And then at some point we walked into a barracks that was filled with racks and racks of shoes. 
That was when I stopped feeling cold. 
Most of the shoes were brown with decay. From a distance they all looked alike. Up close they varied in size and detail. Some had empty holes for laces. Some may have once been pret­ty sandals. Some were like clogs or work boots. Some belonged to chil­dren. 
And then, right in the middle of one rack full of brown, there was a splash of very bright red. 
It was a woman's high heeled shoe. Only the back was visible. But it was very visibly red. 
These were statement shoes. They might have been defiant when they'd been new, and they might still be defi­ant now. 
They matched the ribbon belt on my dress. I stared at the shoe for a long time. I thought about who might have worn it: 
*** 

She was a sophisticated, single Polish Jew. She was sociable. She was fashion-conscious. She went by two names, Tonya to her gentile friends and Leah to her family. She owned a black su.it with red piping, and for the evenings a red dress to go dancing in. Her red shoes matched both. 
They were her favorites. They made her feel confident, and beautiful, and strong. When she was being "deport­ed", she might have only happened to have been wearing them. Or she might have known wh-ere she was going, and put them on for a reason. 
She'd wear them while standing up in a moving cattle car for a week. She wore them when she arrived at Majdanek. 
*** 

I knew the rest from class. And I couldn't see Tonya surviving it. But at least now I knew Tonya. I'd found her shoes. 
So I'd found a perfect pair of red shoes last Spring Break, even though I couldn't put them on. 
But I can wear them again. 
If I ever find red shoes of my own, I'll share them with Tonya, just like she shared hers with me. 
She was probably a better dancer than me. Hopefully, when we go out, that'll rub off.

Combating Mexican drug violence requires effort from both ·sides of the border 
As University of Connecticut students return from their fun in the sun, and tens of thousands of other college stu­dents from across the country make their way south on spring break, there has been a growing amount of coverage here in the U.S. about the rapidly esca­lating violence in Mexico. Hardly an evening newscast goes by without a report about a bloodbath shootout between Mexican authorities and drug cartels in towns and cities mere miles from the U.S. border. Some colleges and universities have even made official. statements advising their students against traveling to Mexico due to the deteriorating situation there. Much of this increased coverage is the result of the growing concern that it is only a matter of time before the violence in Mexico makes its way over the border into the United States. 
This escalation in violence has been brewing for years: ever since Mexican President Felipe Calderon assumed power from Vicente Fox back in December of 2006, Calderon has waged an aggressive war on the all-mighty drug cartels that had been the de-facto rulers of Mexico for decades. By taking the cartels head-on and working to weed out the deeply rooted corruption in his country, President Calderon has made admirable progress in his anti­narcotic efforts. 
Such progress has come at a very high price, however: the drug cartels have fought back with ruthless violence. Thousands have been slaughtered, many of them innocent women and chil­dren caught in the crossfire of the heartless cartels. Cities and towns have been terrorized by the brutal violence. President Calderon is attempting to destroy the cartels' extremely lucrative trade, and cartel bosses are not going to surrender easily. 
With 90 percent of the cocaine in the United States passing through Mexico on its journey here (not to mention mar­ijuana and heroin), the sheer volume of the drugs and drug traffickers makes President Calderon's goal nearly impos­sible to achieve. Corrupt officials on both sides of the border are making the war on the cartels even more difficult. 
The U.S. has already sent $400 million to Mexico to help them train forces and provide equipment for the war against the cartels. Unfortunately, that is but a drop in the bucket, and our government _officials know it. Drug cartels are com­mitting far more money than $400 mil­lion to secure their profitable trade, and they will stop at nothing to protect their business. Significant financial cost and innocent human lives are merely expendable commodities that are just a part of everyday business to the brutal drug lords who command_the cartels. 
The only way for a war against the drug cartels to be successfully waged is with a legitimate commitment from the United States. Mexico can do its best to fight the cartels within their borders, but without a more significant commit­ment ofAmerican tactical and fmancial support, their efforts will prove futile. Ultimately, Americans (particularly those in border towns and states) will pay the price when the rampant, unbri­died violence pours over our borders. The situation has grown so severe that Texas and Arizona are already dis-­cussing the idea of putting the National Guard along the border to help keep the violence out. 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano have both announced plans for upcoming visits to Mexico to discuss the crisis with leaders there and to see the aftermath of the violence. It is imperative that Secretaries Clinton and Napolitano use their visits as a starting point for a meaningful, legitimate working relation­ship between our two countries, a rela­tionship that is absolutely critical to the security of our nation.

tracks are easy listening, and most are quite catchy. There is no denying Swift's talent vocally and on guitar1and piano. And again, just like on ·her debut, Swift's sound resembles \ light pop more than stereotypical

The album becomes slower towards the end. Each of these measured songs alone is great, but together they start to sound similar, The comm()n themes and consistent sounds make such songs begin to feel repetitive over time.

And truthfully, Swift is at her best when she reveals her inner sparkle with a faster pace.

This may explain the downbeat trend in "Fearless," which was, unsurprisingly, based on actual events in Swift's life.

INDIANAPOLIS -Greg Oden will finally play in his hometown as a pro.

coach Nate McMillan said.

dogs, calling them the "real heroes." 
'This never gets old," he said at the finish line as he hugged two of his dogs. 
"It's pretty awesome. Pretty cool." 
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin congratulated Mackey by phone. 
"We are so proud of you. Lance, and we're consider­ing this the greatest team in Iditarod history," Palin said. 
She also told the 38­year-old Mackey, a throat cancer survivor, "You con­tinue to give all of us hope, the adversity thaJ you have overcome, the challenges you've met, believe me, it resonates across our nation and across our world." 
Mackey commended his "little superstar Maple," a 3-year-old female who was in the lead for much of the last part of the race. He hauled her and 9-year-old Larry, one of his traditional lead dogs, onto the stage with him. 
Mackey became the third musher in the race's 37­year history to win in three consecutive years, joining Susan Butcher (1986-88) and Doug Swingley (1999­01). 
He finished about six hours ahead of the second­and third-place mushers, Sebastian Schnuelle of Canada and John Baker of Kotzebue. 

He increased his lead along the wind-swept western coast of Alaska. Fierce, biting winds blew in ofT the Bering Sea, forc­ing temperatures to 50 below zero. Many mushers waited out the storm in checkpoints. 
In Mackey's two previous victories, he headed into the Iditarod about two weeks after winning the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race, considered a tougher race. 
He didn't run the Yukon Quest this year, choosing instead to train an Alaska Native musher for the Iditarod. 
Cubs retire number 
of Jenkins, Maddux 
MESA, Ariz. -The Chicago Cubs will retire the No. 31 worn by both Ferguson Jenkins and Greg Maddux. 
They two star right-handed pitchers will be honored at a ceremony May 3 before a game 
against  Florida  at  Wrigley  
Field.  
It will be the fifth  number  

retired by the Cubs, joining No. 14 (Ernie Banks), No. 26 (Billy Williams), No. 10 (Ron Santo) and No. 23 (Ryne Sandberg). 
Jenkins, elected to the Hall of Fame in 1991, and Maddux, who won 355 games before retiring in December, are the first pitchers in Cubs history to have their numbers retired. 
Jenkins retired before the 1984 season. When Maddux broke in with the Cubs two years later, he was given No. 31. 
New jobs, rumors 
keeping Andretti busy 
INDIANAPOLIS Michael Andretti's jobs keep getting more complex. 
He's already the co-owner of the only four-car team in the lndyCar Series. He's promoting two races this season. He will be on Danica Patrick's radio when the Indy Racing League season opens and he will spend the next several months, per­haps longer, answering those inces­sant questions about the future of Patrick at Andretti Green Racing. 
"I think we all know what we need to do with Danica, she knows what she needs to do, and we're hoping that she's going to be here for a long time," Andretti said Wednesday. "She hasn't expressed anything to us that would lead us to believe she doesn't want to be here." 
That's unlikely to satisfy a racing community abuzz with speculation now that the Illinois native is enter­ing the final year of her contract.

NCAA BASKETBALL 
LSU hoping to make long run 
Mitchell looking to lead No.8 Tigers Jar in the NCAA tournament 
Associated Press 
GREENSBORO, N.C. Tasmin Mitchell took a feed on the block Wednesday dur­ing LSU's open workout, spun around and kissed a layup off the glass. 
Getting the Tigers to the NCAA tournament every year was supposed to be that easy, too. Or so Mitchell thought, anyway, after a freshman sea­son in which he helped lead LSU to its first Final Four in two decades. 
"Every team goes into the season thinking they can make it to the Final Four, especially if we made it the year before that," Mitchell said. "The sky's the limit for the team. You know, as the seasons played out, it didn't go as planned." 
No, it didn't.. 
A broken leg, a coaching change and a pair of mediocre finishes later, and Mitchell finally has the eighth-seeded Tigers (26-7) back in the bracket. They're preparing for ninth-seeded Butler in a South Regional first-round matchup marked by an intriguing juxtaposition of the teams' experience lev­els. 
Th~ young Bulldogs (26-5) have had to mature quickly into tournament regulars, 
making the field of 65 for the third straight year despite a starting lineup that has three freshmen joined by a pair of underclassmen -sophomore Matt Howard and junior Willie Veasley -who have become team leaders by default. 
"We talked about being inexperienced, but between (Howard and Veasley). they played seven NCAA tourna­ment games, so those guys understand what this is all about," Butler coach Brad Stevens said. 
The senior-dominated Tigers, meanwhile, start four fourth-year players -but only two of them, Mitchell and guard Garrett Temple, logged significant minutes on LSU's most recent NCAA tour­nament team. 
Those 2006 Tigers ad'vanced to the national semifinals before struggling badly enough during the years that followed that coach John Brady was fired midway through last season. It didn't help that Mitchell played just three games that year before taking a medical redshirt and having surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left shin. 
"Me and Garrett sit back and talk about it all the time -remember it was like this, remember that game," Mitchell said. "That's over with. We've got to try to get back where we were. The two years after that, you know, we kind of really, really dropped the ball. We really proved to teams that, OK, LSU is not the same as 2006." 
These Tigers aren't much like the ones of the past cou­ple seasons, either. 
Under Southeastern Conference coach of the year Trent Johnson, LSU won the league's regular-season title by going 13-3. But they slipped into a late-season swoon that included losses in three of four games and prob­ably was responsible for their drop to a No. 8 seed. 
To regain their swagger, they'll need to find a way to handle a Butler team that built its reputation as one of the nation's most dangerous mid-majors by taking down several teams from BCS con­ferences. 
Since 2000, the Bulldogs have knocked Maryland, Mississippi State, Louisville and Wake Forest out of the tournament. Last year, they took Tennessee to overtime before falling in the second round. 
"It's in the perception of what people think we should do, is the main thing," for­ward Matt Howard said. 
MLB 
Boone in need of heart surgery on aortic valve 
Associated Press 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. -Aaron Boone of the Houston Astros will have open-heart surgery to replace an aortic valve. 
Boone made the announce­ment Wednesday, saying he has known about .his heart condition since college but tests after his routine physi­cal determined he needed surgery. It is not an emer­gency, but doctors indicated the procedure was needed. 
He said doctors told him he could play baseball when he recovers, but he's not sure whether he will. 
An emotional Boone deliv­ered the news flanked by general manager Ed Wade and manager Cecil Cooper. and in front of a somber room filled with teammates and Astros officials. 
"It definitely hits home, but I'm doing well with it," Boone said. "I feel)ike I'm fairly educated on it now. I have a strong faith and a great family and friends and teammates. I really am doing well and I'm ready to tackle this thing and get it behind me and get on with life." 
Wade said a local doctor who did the team physicals and team physician Dr. Jim Muntz worked together to conduct tests on Boone because they knew of his condition. 
"Unfortunately the test results came out indicating there was an acceleration of the condition that Aaron has been dealing with for a number of years," Wade said. 
He has a bicuspid aortic valve, a congenital defect where the valve has only two cusps to manage the flow of blood through the heart, as opposed to the nor­mal three. The surgery has not been scheduled, but Boone expects to set a date for the procedure later this week. 
"As a baseball family we're here to support Aaron, as you can see by all the teammates and front office personnel we have here," Cooper said. "And anything he needs we're going to be there to help him out." 
Boone said he feels fine, but that he's never had symptoms of the problem. 
He'll make decisions on his future after he recovers and can research and talk with athletes who have returned to play after heart surgery. He mentioned getting in touch with Golden State's Ronny Turiaf, who had a similar procedure and cur­rently plays in the NBA.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Northern Iovva ready 
to go against Purdu~ 
Panthers looking to score big against fifth­seeded Boilermakers in NCAA opening 
Associated Press 
PORTLAND, Ore. -Ben Jacobson isn't going to sell his Northern Iowa Panthers any delusions for a first­round upset of Purdue. That means no inspirational talk of Cinderellas, bracket-busters or Hoosiers. 
"That isn't a card, if you will, that I'd play with our guys," the coach said. "Our guys know what they're about. They know what they're made of. They don't need me to tell them what they're up against." 
The 12th-seeded Panthers (23-10) will go into Thursday's game against the fifth-seeded Boilermakers (25-9) grounded in reality. 
Northern Iowa failed to make even the NIT the past two seasons, and was picked to finish sixth in the Missouri Valley Conference. The Panthers met that expecta­tion by starting the season 6­6. 
But then Northern Iowa took off on an 11-game win­ning streak. The Panthers lost just four games after the first of the year and capped the season with a 60-57 over­time victory over Illinois State to win the MVC tournament title. 
So while they have dis­missed the doubters and get the added bonus of momen­tum, coach Jacobson was guarding his team against dreams of an headline-grab­bing upset. He was putting the focus on old-fashioned hard work. 
"It doesn't mean that we get to win just because we're the 12 and people like to talk about it, you know?" he said. "We're going to have to play a very good basketball team and we know what we're up against." 
Since 2001, No. 12 seeds have defeated No. 5 seeds in 13 of 32 games. 
"I think it just shows the parity through the years," said Purdue coach Matt Painter, "that there's not a whole lot of difference between the five and the 12." 
The 17th-ranked Boilermakers defeated Ohio State 65-61 on Sunday to claim the Big Ten Conference championship and earn the automatic berth. 
The conference tournament title was a boost for Purdue, which lost three of its final four regular-season games. The Boilermakers even held a special meeting to address con­cerns. 
"We \"ere definitely struggling coming into that weekend," for­ward Robbie Hummel said. "But I think we played really well in the Big Ten tournament. I really felt like we were playing well as a team and doing every­thing we needed to win. 
Hummel missed several games this season with a hair­line fracture in his lower back, but he returned to full strength in time for the conference tour­nament, where he averaged 
16.0 points and 9.3 rebounds. He was named the tourney's most outstanding player. 
He is one of Purdue's three super sophomores, a,long with JaJuan Johnson and B'Twaun Moore. None of the seniors start. 
Toward the end of the regular season, the Boilermakers lost focus, the players said. But the meeting helped them regain it just in time. · 
"We were playing a little slop­PY sometimes, playing a little out of control," Moore said. "So we needed to focus, tighten it down, play basic fundamental basketball and just do the basic necessary things to win."

NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
BigTenlookstoimpressNCAA 
Teams hope to show that conference is still in the runningfor the title 
Associated Press 

MINNEAPOLIS -Ohio State was the only Big Ten women's team consistently ranked in the national polls this season, one clear sign that this league of late has been lagging behind the country's other power conferences. 
The strength of the middle of the pack, however, made enough of ·an impression on the NCAA tournament selec­tion committee to warrant five teams chosen for the field. 
So how good, or bad, is the Big Ten these days? 
"The tournament is a litmus test," said Buckeyes coach Jim Foster, whose team was lOth in the most recent Associate(! Press rankings. "We're about to find out." 
Ohio State (27 -5) is the No. 3 seed in the Berkeley region and gets to open at home, though in a different arena than it's used to, in Columbus on Saturday against Sacred Heart. But Stanford, the sec­ond-ranked team in the latest AP poll, looms in a potential third-round game a few miles from the Cardinal's campus. 
Nobody else from the Big Ten is seeded to survive the second round, and No. 10 Minnesota (19-11) must play at Notre Dame on Sunday in the Trenton region. Purdue (22-10) is the No. 6 team in the Oklahoma City region, and Iowa is No. 8. The Hawkeyes (21-10) start at home, but top seed Oklahoma 
will probably await in round 
two if Iowa beats Georgia 
Tech. Michigan State (20-1 0) 
is No. 9 in the Berkeley 
region. 
The Southeastern and Big 
East conferences each have 
seven teams in this year's 
tournament, and the Big 12 
and Atlantic Coast confer­
ences have six. The Pac-10, 
with three, is the only major 
league with fewer schools in 
than the Big Ten this year. 
The Pac-10, though, has at 
least put a team in the Final 
Four over the previous three 
seasons. The Big Ten has not, 
with only one in a regional 
final during that span. 
Since 2000, the Big Ten is 
57-44 in the NCAA tourna> 
ment. The SEC (118-53), Big 
East (103-51), ACC (79-48) 
and Big 12 (79-55) have all 
fared considerably better. 
Purdue, in 1999, has the only 
national title by a Big Ten 
team in the sport. 
Much like on the men's side, 
this one of the most rugged 
conferences in the country. 
When it comes to toughness, 
however, perhaps enough is 
enough. 
''I'm not convinced until I .see otherwise that the physi­
cality in the league is a good 
thing for us," Foster said, 
alluding to the 18-game regu­
lar season schedule that has 
each team facing all but two 
of the other members twice. 
The SEC, Big East, ACC and 
Big 12 each play fewer con­
ference games. 
There are benefits, though. 


"The Big Ten used to be thought of as a power and pounding, walk-it-up league, but now our styles are so var­ied," Michigan State coach Suzy Merchant said. "There are teams like Minnesota that still play a physical brand of basketball, but there are teams such as Ohio State that play up tempo and there are some teams that shoot a bunch of 3s. So regardless of the type of team you play in the tournament, Big Ten coaches can tell their players, 'We've seen that.' That can only help in the NCAA tourna­ment." 
The crowds at most places are pretty good, too, which can provide useful tests for postseason play. 
"I think winning in the Big Ten is very difficult on the road, because especially at Purdue you're playing in front of 10,000 to 12,000 fans," Gophers coach Pam Borton said. "That's pretty much what we're going to see when we go to Notre Dame. It's going to be an unbelievable environment." 
Minnesota probably would­n't have been invited, howev­er, without playing so many quality teams before Big Ten play began. The Gophers lost to Stanford, Iowa State (No. 4 seed) and South Dakota State (No. 7 seed) and beat two teams from major leagues, Colorado and Boston College. 
"I think everybody's really beefed up their nonconfer­ence schedules," Borton said.

Magic defeat Bucks after tough loss to Cavs 
Howard has first career triple-double in points, rebounds, and blocked shots; Rose unstoppable in Bulls win over Thunder 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE -Playing 
back-to-hack road games and 
coming off a tough loss, the 
Orlando Magic could have 
fallen into a trap against a 
Milwaukee team that had just 
tripped up another Eastern 
Conference contender. 
Instead, Dwight Howard 
dominated in the first quarter 
and the Magic never really let 
the Bucks back into the game, 
cruising to a 106-80 victory· 
Wednesday night. 
"We came out today with a 
lot of energy and a lot of 
effort -which we needed last 
night, and we didn't do that," 
Howard said. 
Orlando was coming off a 
deflating 97-93 loss at 
Cleveland, a game in which 
Howard scored only 13 points. 
That turned around right 
away Wednesday, as Howard 
scored 18 points in the first 
quarter on his way to 28 for 
the game. He added 12 
rebounds, and had seven 
assists, falling three shy of a 
triple-double. 
. "Coming off of yesterday, no 
hangover, great energy," 
Magic coach Stan Van Gundy 
said. "Went up and down the 
court, played great defense ­
and Dwight was tremendous." 
Iledo Turkoglu also came ·close to a triple-double with 
14 points, 10 rebounds and 
seven assists for Orlando, 8-2 
in its last 10 games. 
Van Gundy had some nit­
picking to do, but wasn't sur­
prised with the overall effort. 
"It's really hard to argue 
with our competitiveness," 
Van Gundy said. "I think that there's a lot of things that we still need to improve on, but our guys come out and play for the most part. I think in terms of that, we're about as consistent as any team in the . league." 
Charlie Villanueva had 17 po.ints for the Bucks, who are desperately trying to earn the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference and were coming off a home victory over Boston. 
Milwaukee fell to 2-3 on its critical and challenging six­game homestand that ends against Portland on Saturday night. 
"I think there's a lesson learned here for us," Bucks coach Scott Skiles said. "Most sporting events· are over before they even start, based on the mind-set of the teams that are playing and the play­ers that are playing in it." 
Skiles said the Magic are a good team, but added, "We really didn't compete at all. It's very disappointing and we need to learn something from it." 
Howard went after the Bucks early and often after taking only eight shots in Orlando's loss at Cleveland on Tuesday. He scored 18 points in the first quarter alone, put­ting together his own 10-2 run to end the quarter. 
He began the scoring spurt by converting three-point plays on back-to-back posses­sions, then dunked home a putback. After a pair of free throws by Milwaukee's Richard Jefferson, Howard scored on a layup with 23 seconds left to give Orlando a 36-20 lead going into the sec­ond quarter. 
"He set the tone of the game," Villanueva said. "It was difficult because there are four perimeter guys around him and that makes it very difficult to defend. It just seemed like we couldn't stop him out there." 
Howard then rested for the first 6-plus minutes of the second quarter,but Milwaukee couldn't make up any ground. 
Malik Allen was one of sev­eral Bucks who struggled try­ing to defend Howard -and then Allen picked up his third and fourth fouls in the final minutes of the first half. 
Allen's third foul came when he sent J .J. Redick crashing to the floor under the basket, then picked up his fourth foul on the offensive end with 32.3 seconds left in the half. 
Howard's only noticeable misstep came midway through the third quarter, when he was called for offen­sive basket interference on a putback attempt. But it didn't mattet1 much, because Orlando was leading 69-45 at the time. 
Howard recovered to make a huge block near the end of the third quarter, slapping a shot by Milwaukee's Charlie Bell over his teammates' heads on the bench and into the second row of seats. 
Howard then went skyward to slam home an alley-oop pass from Turkoglu early in the fourth quarter, putting

the Magic up by 26. 
Bulls 103, Thunder 96 
Derrick Rose didn't know what he had to do, but his team needed him to do some­thing. A perfect second half took care of what was ailing the Chicago Bulls Rose scored 25 of his 20 points and didn't miss a shot in the second half and the Bulls snapped a seven-game road losing streak by beating the Oklahoma City Thunder 103­96 on Wednesday night. 
"I knew that my team need­ed me to make plays. I didn't know what type of plays, but it ended up being scoring plays," said Rose, who fin­ished two points off his career best. 
In a matchup between two of the NBA's top rookie point guards, Rose was unstoppable in the second half. The No. 1 pick in last year's draft hit all 10 of his shots, including the jumper that gave the Bulls the lead for good late in the third quarter. 
"I was just feeling it tonight. I didn't want to lose, so I just started shooting the ball," Rose said. 
Russell Westbrook. the fourth overall pick in the draft, had 15 points and pulled the Thunder within 99­96 by driving past Rose for a layup in the final minute before Oklahoma City's rally fell short. 
John Salmons added 20 points and Ben Gordon scored 18 for the Bulls. 
Kevin Durant led Oklahoma City with 28 points and Jeff Green had 18. 
Durant missed a 3-pointer that would have tied the game in the final 30 seeonds before Tyrus Thomas hit four free throws to close it out for eighth-place Chicago, which 
leads the race for the final playoff spot by a game and a 
half  over  Milwaukee  and  
Charlotte.  
"It's such  a  tight race right  

now to get that eighth spot in the East," Bulls coach Vinny Del Negro said. "All these games we've struggled on the road and we haven't convert­ed down the stretch. but it was nice for us tonight to con­vert." 
Hose and Westbrook became friends while training togeth­er in Los Angeles leading up to the draft, going one-on-one and doing other drills to pre­pare themselves to be lottery picks. 
"Basically. it was just me and him before the draft. just working out every day," Rose said. 
Rose and Westbrook came in ranked second and third among rookies in scoring and 1-2 in assists. Westbrook was also seventh in rebounding but had the most turnovers among rookies and the fifth­most in the NBA overall. 
The game was an opportuni­ty for Westbrook to make a statement in the Rookie of the Year race, although he said he was approaching it like "any other game." 
He had the better first half with 12 points and only one turnover while Rose was the mistake-prone one early, turning it over five times while scoring only five points. But that changed quickly. 
He hit five shots in the first 5 minutes after halftime as , the Bu!Is turned a five-point deficit into a 63-62 lead when Rose connected on a foul line jumper. The lead grew to 74­68 the Thunder rallied back ahead with seven straight points, but then Rose struck again from the right wing for 
a 76-75 Chicago lead.

NHL 

Hurricanes take down Devils 
Blue Jackets take down the Blackhawks by one in overtime 
Associated Press 

RALEIGH, N.C. -The New Jersey Devils can be excused for this lackluster effort against the Carolina Hurricanes. 
They have been surging since Martin Brodeur returned from an elbow injury and chased down the NHL record for wins by a goalie. One night after he broke Patrick Roy's career mark by winning his SS2nd game, New Jersey was done in by playoff-hungry Carolina. 
The Hurricanes, who had four days off since returning from a winless three-game road trip, pounced on New Jersey. Anton Babchuk scored twice, Eric Staal got his team-high 34th goal and Sergei Samsonov added one in a 4-2 victory Wednesday night over the Brodeur-less Devils. 
Carolina began a three­game homestand and ending the Devils' four-game winning streak. The Hurricanes have won a season-high six in a row at home. 
New Jersey played without Brodeur, who set the wins record Tuesday night by beat­ing Chicago. It was the first time Brodeur missed a start in 10 games since returning from an elbow injury on Feb. 26. 
Kevin Weekes made 28 saves in place of Brodeur. 

"It's been a week where it's been a high emotional WJlek and for all the right reasons," Devils coach Brent Sutter 1 said. "We'll regroup and get back at it. We knew what to 
.. expect. They'd been sitting for four days waiting for us." "The outcome isn't like shocking because when you give up three power-plays goals, it's a tough night." The Hurricanes, with 81 points, moved into a tie with Montreal for seventh place in the Eastern Conference ­three points above ninth­place Florida and the post­season cutoff. Carolina went 3-for-S on the power play against the Devils, who are among the best penalty-killers on the road. New Jersey, second in the East, allowed three man­advantage goals in a game for only the second time this season. "It was-a game where S-on­S we played well and yet it was a night where you need­ed your special teams to be good," Sutter said. "Our PK got three power-play goals on us." Babchuk, who notched his first multigoal game of the season, opened the scoring 10 minutes in with a poke at the right post after Weekes was unable to control a pair of rebounds. Staal gave Carolina a 2-0 lead 1 :2S into the second period with a sharp-angle slap shot from the bottom of the right circle. "We got to do a better job (on the penalty kill)," New Jersey forward Patrik Elias said. "They have a lot of skills on the power play but we have to be better." Zach Parise scored New Jersey's first goal when the 
Devils were on a S-on-3 man­advantage with 6:38 left in the second period. 
But Babchuk restored Carolina's two-goal cushion with 38 seconds left in the second period when he blast­ed a low slap shot through traffic from the top of the slot. 
"I've been playing more lately and trying to· take advantage of it," Babchuk said. "I knew they played last night and thought they would be more tired." 
Sergei Samsonov made it 4­1 with 7:46 left in the third, and Brian Gionta scored with 
2:1 7 left in the game to bring the Devils back within two goals. 
Weekes got his first start since Feb. 19 and saw his first action since March 7 in relief of Brodeur. Carolina's Cam Ward, making his 19th straight start, stopped 41 shots. 
Blue Jackets 4,Biackhawks 
3 
The latest addition to the Columbus Blue Jackets is proving to be a perfect fit. 
Antoine Vermette took a pass from R.J. Umberger and scored 2:38 into overtime, giving the Blue Jackets a 4-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Wednesday night. 
"It doesn't get much better than a playoff race," said Vermette, acquired this month in a trade-deadline deal with the Ottawa Senators. "It's great. I'm pretty happy." 
Umberger carried the puck up the right wing on a 2-on-1 in overtime, saucering a pass that tumbled to the high slot where Vermette beat defense­man Brian Campbell to the puck and chipped it past Cristobal Huet for his first game-winner in more than a year. 
How valuable an addition has he been to the Blue Jackets' first stretch run? He's scored points in five of his six games with Columbus. 

Umberger, Derek Dorsett and Rick Nash added goals for the Blue Jackets, who came into the night sixth in the Western Conference. Columbus tied a franchise record with 80 points while winning for the fifth time in six starts. 
For the first time, the Blue Jackets find themselves watching the scoreboard to see how it affects their play­off run. 
"When you're in this kind of race, everybody checks every once in a while," Dorsett said. "No one really pays too much attention. You've just got to worry about yourself and make sure you're getting the two points." 
Rookie goalie Steve Mason stopped 24 shots to improve to29-17-3. 
Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews each had a goal and an assist, and Dave Bolland also scored for the Blackhawks, who have lost four in a row and six of seven. Huet made numerous spectacular saves, stopping 24 shots. 
"Obviously, the wayt we've been playing, it's good to get a point," Kane said. "But you want to go in and win that game. So it's disappointing not to get two. You can tell by everyone's reaction in the locker room that we're not real happy." 
Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville looked at the game as a small step. 
"The confidence is a little bit off," he said. "We stemmed a little bit of the flow going against us. (But) we've got to (start) winning and feeling a little more con­fident at critical times of games." 
The teams traded goals throughout the game before a scoreless third period. 
Bolland scored in the open­ing minute before Umberger redirected a tape-to-tape pass from Jake Voracek to tie it. 
NCAA BASKETBALL 

Gonzaga ready to rrtake their lllark at NCAAs 
Associated Press 
PORTLAND, Ore. -When Jeremy Pargo turned down the opportunity to be drafted into the NBA last year as a junior, it was because of what he begins Thursday: A senior year run through the NCAA tournament. 
"Oh, definitely. This tourna­ment is unbelievable. 1 haven't experienced the NBA, but there's nothing like this," the streaky point guard said Wednesday in Gonzaga's lock­er room before a practice for a first-round game against 13th-seeded Akron. 
Pargo and the heralded Bulldogs (26-S) are heavy favorites to zap the Zips (23­12), who won the Mid­American Conference tourna­ment, and advance to the sec­ond-round Saturday against Illinois or Western Kentucky, who play later Thursday. Gonzaga has won 18 of 19 games and were undefeated in the West Coast Conference regular season and tourna­ment. 
Yet Pargo, fellow senior and leading scorer Josh Heytvelt, coach Mark Few and shooter Matt Bouldin all mentioned how one bad day can end everything for Gonzaga, which has yet to reach the Final Four in 11 consecutive NCAA tournament appear­ances. 
"I definitely want to leave a mark on this program," Pargo said. "This program has been to an Elite Eight. The Final Four is the next step." 
"Our expectations are really high," Bouldin said. "We just can't take any game for granted. I think the last two years taught me that." 
Few, a former 10-year Zags assistant who was promoted to head coach in 1999, cau­tioned not to judge this team, or his program, by the stan­
dard of Final Four appear­ances. 
"We've had an incredible run these last 11 years now," he said. "''m hesitant to put all the eggs in one basket like so many people like to do with this tournament, when it's a one-and-done deal. These seasons are long, hard journeys, and I wouldn't take that for grant­ed. 
"The fact that we've won 26 games with an incredible difficult schedule .... The league championships obvi­ously mean a lot to us. 
"We've been to an Elite Eight, we've been to several Sweet 16s, and I think if we keep fielding the type of teams with student athletes like these guys ... then even­tually we'll be able to bust through and get to a Final Four sometime, but it's cer­tainly not-I don't think it's the end-all to everything." 
Few praised Pargo for his resiliency -"he's probably missed one or two practices in four years" -for playing lately as well as he has all season and for spurning the temptation of NBA riches. 
"He's meant everything to this program," Few said. "He's as charismatic and engaging a person that you'll ever coach. You can hear him, even in my office when he comes rolling in down through the cortidors of the arena. 
"He was going to get draft­ed and yet weighed it out where he was at and what he wanted to accomplish, what he wanted to do with this group of guys. It's hasn't been perfect. I don't think it's been exactly the way that he scripted it, but here he is. 
"Hopefully, he can end what's already been a great career with a long run in the NCAA tournament."

Woods to play in the Australian Masters 
Associated Press 
MELBOURNE, Australia ­Tiger Woods will play at the Australian Masters in N{wember, his first tournament appearance Down Under since 1998. 
A government spokesman confirmed premier John Brumby's comments in a Melbourne newspaper that Woods would play in the event at Kingston Heath, scheduled for Nov. 12-15. 
A news conference was planned in Melbourne later Thursday. 
"We are delighted Tiger Woods has chosen to come to Melbourne, further cementing our position as the major events capital of the world," Brumby told the Herald Sun newspaper. Melbourne also hosts the Australian Open, the first of four majors each year on the international tennis circuit. and the season-opening Formula One Grand Prix. 
Brumby predicted the visit by the world's top golfer would earn Victoria state $19 million in economic benefits. which would offset Woods' $4.54 mil­lion appearance fee. 
Woods has recently returned from an eight-month layoff fol­lowing season-ending knee sur­gery last year after winning the 
U.S. Open, his 14th career major. 
Stuart Appleby, among the Australians who regularly com­pete against Woods on the PGA Tour, said it was a coup for golf Down Under, even in the eco­nomic climate. 
"It will be great for the game and bring out a lot of people who haven't seen him before­in person, not on a video game," Appleby told The Associated Press. "There's a lot of people hurting in Australia, and they might look negatively that one guy is paid ($4.54 mil­lion) just to turn up. The com­mon man won't understand the business model because the government ·is paying for it. They might not see the money he brings in." · 
But he predicted huge gal­leries for Woods at Kingston Heath. 
"He not been down here since the Presidents Cup," Appleby said. "lie's been to Asia multi­ple times. He's been to Europe multiple times. I think it's good that he's bringing his game to Australia." 
Woods, who was not immedi­ately available for comment, is very-selective about his appear­ances outside of the United States.

MEN's NIT 
Second-half surge helps Baylor past G'To-wn 
Va. Tech edges Duquesne; Creighton tops BGSU 
Associated Press 
WACO, Texas -LaceDarius Dunn and Kevin Rogers each scored 20 points and Curtis Jerrells added 19 to lead Baylor to a 74-72 win over Georgetown in the first round of the National lnvitation Tournament on Wednesday night. 
The Bears (21-14) got their first postseason victory since 1950. 
Jerrells put Baylor ahead 7 4­69 with a pair of free throws with eight seconds remaining. 
But DaJuan Summers hit a 3­pointer for Georgetown (16-15) with four seconds left, and Tweety Carter missed the front end of a one-and-one opportuni­ty for the Bears. 
Summers, who led the Hoyas with 19 points, grabbed the rebound and launched a shot at the buzzer that fell short. 
Jerrells' layup tied the game at 67 with just under five min­utes remaining. He followed with a steal, and Carter's 3­pointer gave the Bears the lead for good less than 30 seconds later. 
Behind 72-69, Georgetown's Chris Wright attempted a 3­pointer from the left side with 11 seconds left. Jerrells partially blocked the shot and Dunn pulled down the rebound for the Bears. He nailed the clinching free throws in the final seconds. 
Greg Monro·e added 12 points and Austin Freeman 11 for Georgetown. 
Trailing 44-34 at halftime, Baylor opened the second half on 13-2 run and took a 4 7-46 lead with 16 1!2 minutes left to play. Dunn ignited the come­back with 11 points, including three 3-pointers. 
Georgetown shot 76 percent from the floor in the first half, connecting on 16 of 21 attempts. 
Baylor plays Virginia Tech, a 116-108 double overtime win­ner over Duquesne, in the next round of the NIT. 
Virginia Tech 116, Duquesne 108 (2 OT) 
A.D. Vassallo scored 33 points and the Hokies scored on their first five possessions in the sec­ond overtime to overcome a huge night from Duquesne's Aaron Jackson and win their first-round NIT game Wednesday night. 
Jackson scored a career-high 46 points, but -it wasn't enough to keep the Hokies (19-14) from advancing to the second round, where they will host Baylor. 
Duquesne (21-13), making its first postseason appearance since the 1994 NIT, closed out its best season since the 1971 team went 21-4. 
Jeff Allen added 23 points for Virginia Tech, which led by six with under a minute to go in the first overtime. But the Dukes rallied and tied the game at 94 on Jackson's layup with less than 2 seconds left. 
In the second overtime, Vassallo scored 10 points and the Hokies made all 10 of their free throws to put the game away. 
Jackson, a senior from Hartford, Conn., paced the Dukes with a career-high 46 points. He hit 15-of-25 from the floor, including 8-of-13 from beyond the 3-point arc. He also hit 8-of-9 from the free-throw line and had four assists. 
His performance was the fourth-best single-game per­formance in Duquesne history. 
The Hokies led by 13 with seven minutes to go in regula­tion, but the Dukes used a 17-4 run to tie the game, and took a 78-76 lead after Melquan Bolding hit the first of two free throws with 28.6 seconds remaining. But Vassallo hit a floater in the lane with 13.1 sec­onds to go to tie the game at 78. 
On the final possession of reg­ulation, Duquesne's Eric Evans drove into the lane. But his con­tested layup came up well short, sending the game into overtime. 
Creighton 73, Bowling Green 71 
P'Allen Stinnett scored 18 points, including two big free throws in the final minute, and Creighton came from behind to defeat Bowling Green in the first round of the NIT Wednesday night. 
The Bluejays (27 -7) will host Kentucky (21-13) in a second­round game Monday. 
Creighton, which trailed by 14 points in the first half and by 8 with 8 1/2 minutes left, went ahead 69-6 7 with 4:41 to play on Booker Woodfox's 3-pointer. 
Nate Miller put the Falcons (19-14) ahead again briefly, but Justin Carter's 3-pointer with 
1:46 left gave the Bluejays the lead for good. 
Stinnett hit two free throws with 35 seconds to make it a three-point game. Miller's fast­break layup got Bowling Green within 72-71, but he missed an inside shot that would have given the Falcons the lead with 19 seconds to play. 
Woodfox made a free throw for the final margin. 
Carter added 14 points, Antoine Young 12 and Woodfox 10 for the Bluejays. 
Miller scored 22 points, Darryl Clements had 19 points and eight rebounds, and Brian Moten added 12 points for Bowling Green. ' 
Creighton, the Missouri Valley Conference regular-season co­champion. had hoped to receive an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament after winning 10 of its last 11 games. An ugly loss to Illinois -State in the Missouri Valley Conference tournament semifinals, combined with upsets in other conference tour­naments, left the Bluejays short. 
The Bluejays missed their first 11 3-point shots, and the Falcons led for more than 32 minutes before Creighton ral­lied. 
Bowling Green, which won the Mid-American Conference regu­lar-season title, had a chance to tie or win at the end, but Clements' 23-footer bounced off the rim, and Scott Thomas' tip try was off the mark at th"e buzzer. 
The Bluejays will be playing a Kentucky team that is in the NIT for the first time in three decades. The Wildcats missed the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years. 
They advanced to the second round of the NIT with a 70-60 win over UNLV on Tuesday.

"The competition will be really tough, especially com­peting against girls who I watched on TV this summer competing for the Olympics, but it's also so inspiring to watch them dive," Stitt said. ''I'm a little intimidated, but watching them makes me want to be able to dive as well as them and it makes me want to be better." 
Miller is competing' in the 50 and 100 freestyle events and the 100 fly event. Recently, Miller broke her personal-best time and the school record in the 50 freestyle event, making her the fastest female swim­mer in school history with a time of 22.37 seconds. She broke the record at the Big East conference meet, where the Irish took home top honors for the 13th consecutive year. 
Over the last week in prac­tice, the girls have been work­ing on perfecting their strokes and dives for optimal results in their toughest meet of the season. 
"In preparation for my swims I have just been trying to maintain my stroke and make sure that I am keeping the technical aspect of my swimming where it should be," Maxwell said. 
Beside the technique and stroke maintenance, there is one other driving force that comes into play during the intense competition that these girls will face. 
"While consistency and tech­nique are things every diver focuses on, I've learned the huge difference that confi­dence in my diving makes," Stitt said.

Still, the level of competition Notre Dame will face will be the stiffest of the season, with a large and deep pool of com­petitors to wade through. 
"We're aware of our primary 

rivals, Penn State and Ohio State, but there's a very strong team in Columbia," Bednarski said. "The pool is strong. I think it will really come down to the last minutes of the competition on Sunday with everyone being so strong. By the 
end, the psychology of the team will be much more important." 
The men's bouts will begin Thursday and conclude with the medal round Friday after­noon. Senior All-American Karol Kostka and sophomore Greg Schoolcraft will represent the Irish in the epee class. This year will be Kostka's fourth year competing in the NCAAs. 
In foil, Notre Dame is young, sending freshman Olympian Gerek Meinhardt and freshman Enzo Castellani. Sophomore Avery Zuck and All-American Barron Nydam, competing in the sabre division, round out the men's team. 
On the women's side, the Irish send a deep and experi­enced lineup to the Saturday bouts. Sophomore All­American Ewa Nelip and fresh­man Courtney Hurley will fence in the epee division, while

Albuquerque as Gary is the only Lobo to start every game this season, averaging 8.1 points per game and 2.2 rebounds per game. 
Gary, though, isn't the play­er Notre Dame most needs to account for Thursday. That. distinction falls to senior for­ward Daniel Faris, a 6-foot-9­inch, 245-pound load who notched a career-best 28 points and 13 rebounds in New Mexico's _83-71 win over Nebraska in the first round.

Notre Dame continued their success at the plate against Deetjen after the first inning but was unable to capitalize with any runs until the fifth inning. The Irish stranded two runners on base in both the second and third innings, and sophomore outfielder Golden Tate was thrown out at home to end the fourth. 
Pollock manufactured a run on his own in the fifth inning, stealing second and third base after walking to lead off the inning. The junior came around to score on a Martin groundout to extend the Notre Dame lead. 
Notre Dame had a field day on the basepaths, notching a s~_ason-high five stolen bases in the game. 
"We really as a team empha­size being aggressive on the base-paths and work on our baserunning all year," Sherry said. 
Valparaiso finally reached Sabatino in the top of the sixth, beginning the inning with a strikeout but advancing to first after the pitch got by sophomore catcher Matt Scioscia.

Richter came on in relief of Sabatino, and had a difficult time finding the plate early. Richter walked the first two Valparaiso hitters he faced, and Martin misplayed a groundball down the first base line, allowing two Crusaders to score. 
Richter escaped the inning with a 6-4-3 double play, but the damage was done with the score tied at three. 
The Irish quickly responded in the bottom half of the inning, loading the bases with none out on three straight sin­gles by Scioscia, Sherry, and Tate. One run came in to score on a passed ball by Crusaders catcher Billv Cribbs, and Pollock plated ·sherry on a sac­rifice fly to center field.

Belles split doubleheader 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK 
Spons Writer 

Saint Mary's started slow but came bacl('to split a dou­bleheader with Manchester Wednesday after junior Ashley P~terson was named Division III Regional Player of the Week. 
Manchester took the lead in the top of the first with three runs and held Saint Mary's (12-2) off the board until the bottom of the fourth. Senior Cathy Kurczak was first at bat for the Belles, leading off with a walk. Three batters later, Kurczak scored on Peterson's single to left-cen­ter field, cutting the Belles' deficit to 3-1. 
The Spartans responded with four runs in the top of the fifth, widening their lead to 7-1 as the Belles stepped up to the plate. Sophomore Hayley Bojorquez started the offensive attack for Saint Mary's, reaching on an error. Senior Katie Rashid hit an RBI double down the right­field line to bring in Bojorquez and make the score 7-2. Two batters after Rashid, freshman Kristen Nelson hit a triple to right­center field to bring in Rashid from second. Nelson quickly scored off of a hit by Kurczak, putting the Belles down 7-4. 
Saint Mary's held Manchester at seven runs but wasn't able to get on the board again until the bottom of the seventh. With two outs, Peterson scored from second off of a single to center field from Rashid. The Belles weren't able to score again to 
make a full comeback over the Spartans and lost 7-5. 
"I think we beat ourselves today," Belles coach Erin Sullivan said. "We played down to our competition and they capitalized on our errors early in the game. We lacked a sense of urgency to make up for the runs we gave up in the first inning, which result­ed in us running out of time. I told my team we would have won had we had nine innings to play, but we only get seven." 
Freshman pitcher Monica Palicki moved her record to 5-2, allowing nine hits and only three earned runs in the loss. Peterson, Rashid and senior Ashley Fusaro each went 2-4 in the first game. Peterson sc~ed once and drove in a run, and Rashid had two RBis and scored once. 
Ready for round two, Saint Mary's took the lead early in the second game with a run from junior Maureen Healy in the bottom of the first. Manchester came back with a run in the top of the second inning, moving the score to 1­1, but not for long. 
The Belles followed with Bojorquez scoring off of a single up the middle by fresh­man Kate Mitchell. 
After three scoreless innings, Manchester scored three times off a double and a two-run home run, putting its lead at 4-2 going into the bot­tom of the sixth. Fusaro led off for Saint Mary's with a single. Consecutive hits from Bojorquez and freshman Kate Mitchell and a double to left­center from Nelson tied the game 4-4. 
Kurczak next came to the plate, bringing in Mitchell for the game-winning run off of a sacrifice fly to right field. The Spartans managed to get one runner on second in the top half of the seventh but weren't able to score again. The Belles defeated the Spartans 5-4. 
"I was proud of our pitchers for staying in two tight games," Sullivan said. 
Peterson, Bojorquez, Mitchell and Nelson each had a pair of hits in Game 2, with Bojorquez scoring twice while Mitchell drove in two runs and scored once. Peterson's current career-high hitting streak moved to 14 games, and Fusaro's to 13. Freshman pitcher Angela Gillis moved her record to 7-0, allowing nine hits and three runs. 
"I am hoping today's games were a good wake-up call for us to make sure we play our game and play the sport with passion, the way it is meant to be played," Sullivan said. "I was also happy with our comeback in the bottom of the 6th to win Game 2. The team showed a lot of heart and a desire to win by scoring three runs that inning." 
The Belles will have a full week off and will return to action a week from Thursday, on March 26, with a double­header at Franklin College. 
"We will be working on bet­ter communication, fewer mental errors, and smarter base running before we play Franklin on the 26th," Sullivan said.

Irish head to Alabama for Blue Gray Classic

After 10 days oil', No. 26 Notre Dame will be challenged at the Blue Gray National Classic in Montgomery, Ala., today-a tour­nament Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said is one of country's most pres­tigious. 
"All of the teams are nationally ranked," Bayliss said. "There will be no easy matches and we will be challenged every time we play." 
The Irish will open play against No. 48 Mississippi State at 4 p.m. today. With a win, Notre Dame would advance to play either No. 22 Boise State or No. 41 . Oklahoma Friday afternoon.

Bayliss said he will continue to search for the right doubles com­binations, especially at the bottom of the young but talented Irish lineup. 
As expected, senior Brett Helgeson has been a force at the top of the lineup already this sea­son. 
Helgeson is currently ranked No. 21 in the nation in singles, and he and his doubles partner, sopho­more Tyler Davis, are also ranked No. 21.

BASEBALL 
Hitting their stride 
Offense impressive as Irish win fifth straight 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Associate Sports Editor 
Notre Dame won its fifth straight and the ninth game in its last 11 Wednesday, routing Valparaiso 10-4 at Frank Eck Stadium. 
Freshman southpaw Steve Sabatino received a no-deci­sion but had a solid start for the Irish (12-5), giving up two runs over 5 1-3 innings. Sabatino struck out four and held the Crusaders (5-10) scoreless until the sixth inning. 
Freshman reliever Ryan Richter picked up the first win of his career after pitching two innings and giving up no earned runs. 
The Irish struck first in the bottom of the opening frame, scoring two quick runs off of Valparaiso freshman Tyler Deetjen. After consecutive sin­gles by junior outfielders David Mills and A.J. Pollock, junior first baseman Casey Martin opened the scoring with an RBI single. 
Senior shortstop Jeremy Barnes then ripped an RBI double into the left-center gap, plating Pollock .and giving Notre Dame an early 2-0 lead. 
Sophomore tbird baseman Greg Sherry said Notre Dame's situational hitting was -a big advantage. 
"We work on situational hit­ting all the time in practice," Sherry said. "That's the great part about our lineup, every­one top to bottom just wants to get the job done, whether it's a bunt, sacrifice fly, or getting the big hit." 
Sabatino dominated the

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Notre Dame set to host New Mexico in NIT's second round 
By GREG ARBOGAST Senior Staff Writer 
Entering the Big East tour­nament, Notre Dame knew it needed to win five games in a row to claim the ultimate prize, but the Irish flamed out in round two. Notre Dame now gets a second chance at mak­ing it to round three out of five. 
After winning their first NIT game 70-64 over Alabama­Birmingham Tuesday, the No. 2-seed Irish look to advance to 
the quarterfinals of the NIT when they host No. 3-seed New Mexico (22-11, 12-4 Mountain West) Thursday night at 7:05p.m. 
In an attempt to draw a strong home crowd, the ticket department will be distribut­ing free tickets to the first 1,000 students to attend Thursday's game. That same incentive was in place for the UAB game but dido't seem to have much effect, as roughly one-fourth of the 2,064 in attendance were students. That attendance figure, how-
FENCING 
Team sends 12 fencers to NCAA competition 
By MICHAEL BLASCO 
Sports Writer 
Twelve Notre Dame fencers will compete for a chance at a national title this weekend at the NCAA Fencing Championships in State College, Penn. The No. 1. Irish, alongside rivals No.2 Penn State and No. 4 Ohio State, qualified the maximum six fencers from both the male and female teams. 
The event caps a roaring sea­son in which the Notre Dame squads combined for a 65-2 record. Both the men's and women's teams have held at least a share of the top spot in the USFCA Coaches' through­out the season. 
This year marks the seventh time the Irish have qualified 12 fencers for the NCAA Championships, a key step toward a national title. Since 2000, teams sending 12 fencers to the NCAAs have claimed eight of nine titles, and in 2005, Notre Dame took home the title with only 11 entrants. 
Irish head coach Janusz Bednarski said he hopes that this tournament will mark his third national championship since becoming head coach in 2002, but he acknowledged the pressure and grueling toll that the NCAAs can take on a young squad such as his. 
"They'll be OK," Bednarski said. "Although we're young, we have some very experi­enced fencers who've been fencing all over the globe. NCAA competitions have a level of stress, a different envi­ronment, but I believe the young kids will adapt."

WOMEN'S SWIMMING 
Three head to nationals in Texas 
By MOLLY SAMMON Sports Writer 
Three members of Notre Dame's Big East Championship team will represent the univer­sity at the NCAA Championships at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, this weekend. 
Sophomore swimmers Amywren Miller and Samantha Maxwell and junior diver Natalie Stitt each qualified for this opportunity by remaining among the most competitive swimmers and divers in the country.

ever, may have been affected by the 9 p.m. start time for a game played on St. Patrick's Day. 
"I think our crowd really helped us tonight, and it'll be better because there will be even more people Thursday," Irish coach Mike Brey said after Tuesday's win. "It'll build a little bit for Thursday." 
Strong crowd tJr not, the Joyce Center has been a good home for Notre Dame this sea­son. The Irish are 13-3 at home compared to 2-9 on the road. The Irish have also beat­en 35 straight non-conference opponents at the JACC, last losing to Michigan 71-67 on Qec. 3, 2005. 
"Especially for our seniors, to play another home game Thursday, that's great for them," junior forward Luke Harangody said. "They're looking to fight every game. They want to keep playing, everybody on the team wants to keep playing, we're just excited to be out here." 
New Mexico, however, won't feel completely out of its ele­ment traveling to Indiana for Thursday's game. The Lobos are coached by Steve Alford, who was Mr. Basketball for the state of Indiana in 1983. Alford then went on to an All­America career at Indiana that included a national cham­pionship in 1987. 
Sophomore guard Dairese Gary is also making a home­coming of sorts. Alford's first signee at New Mexico, Gary played point guard at Concord High in Elkhart, Ind. He's found a new home in

Squad overwhelms Toledo 
ND holds Rockets to one run aver two games in dominating sweep 
By MOLLY SAMMON Sports Writer 

Notre Dame needed only five innings in each game of its doubleheader against Toledo Wednesday, as the Irish swept the Rockets with 15-0 and 9-1 victories in their first pair of games at Melissa Cook Stadium. 
Notre Dame (1 0-10) senior Brittney Bargar held Toledo (2-12) to just one hit in the first game, and the Irish jumped on the Hoekets from the get-go with four runs in the bottom of the first inning, which was capped by a home run from freshman right field­er Dani Miller. Junior first
