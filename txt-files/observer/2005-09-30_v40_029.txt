Scholars address Irish language role 
By PETER NINNEMAN News Writer 
Six distinguislwd scholars will prosent a conference on tho Irish language's role in academia today in the Ilosburgh Auditorium. 
"Why Irish?"-a forum hostod by the Departmnnt of Irish Language and Literature -will bring together interna­tionally nmowned scholars from the fields of comparative literature, medieval studies, linguistics, eontmnporary lit­eraturn, cultural studies and Indo-European poetics. The scholars will discuss how the language has benefited their rosoarch and the role it plays in thnir discipline. 
"It focuses attention on the role, function and contribu­tions of Irish language and lit­erature in the North American university system," said Professor Brian 6 Conchubhair, a Fellow of the Keough Institute for Irish Studies. 
Judging from registration for the ali-day event, atten­dance is expected to be strong. 6 Conchubhair attrib­utes his optimism for student turnout to the rising number of' studonts taking Irish or Irish Studies as a minor at Notre Dame. 
Given that the eonference is on a class day, 6 Conchubhair said students am welcome to

ND students support AllianceND campaign for greater acceptance 
By MADDIE HANNA Associate News Editor 
The "Gay? Fine by Me" tee shirt campaign is two and a half years old, and Notre Dame is no longer No. 1 in the Princeton Review's "Alternative Lifestyles Not an Alternative" category. 
But enough orange shirts were spotted around campus Thursday to show that students are still passionate, and persistent, about promoting acceptance and stimu­lating discussion about gay, les­bian, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning people (GLBTQ) at Notre Dame. 
"I cannot believe what a great day we've had," said Anna Gomberg, a graduate student and co-coordinator of the unrecog­nized student group AllianceND, which produced the shirts. ''I'm floored. Today was probably the most successful of the tee shirt days in my tenure." 
Since the campaign began in spring 2004, Gomberg said the shirts have become a greater part of Notre Dame's "landscape." She said the primary goal of the cam­paign is to show support for the GLBTQ community at Notre Dame. 
"In a practical way, it provides an easy way for supportive people

No longer a 'loser' 

I lose a lot of things. I leave shoes in hotel rooms, CD's in the computer clus­tnr and magazines in the gym. I no longer buy expensive sunglasses because I lose about a pair a month at TC (who doesn't love sunglasses at Kate Gales night?), and don't even get me start­

ed on how a lost 

Sports Editor 
cell phone nearly triggered a long battle with ResLife (but that's a column that will probably never be written). 
But all of those examples are nothing compared to when my roommate Gina and I lost the remote control to our TV. Leading a blameless and virtuous exis­tence gave me enough good karma to get a beautiful, spacious double on the third floor of Cavanaugh. Although I've enjoyed living in a large room that is the envy of freshmen everywhere, the problem is there are just so many places to lose things. It doesn't always help that Gina is extremely neat and consistently straightening things up. For a disorganized free spirit like myself, you'd think that's a pretty nice thing-especially when she makes my bed -but it has led to an alarming number of things being misplaced, mis­laid and possibly lost forever. 
We first noticed the missing remote at approximately 10 p.m. two week­ends ago, when I settled in to watch a movie and the remote was nowhere to be found. Bow was I to fast-forward through the credits? How would I stand watching parts where people die? We all know that walking 1 0 feet to the TV to control this is simply not acceptable. 
I couldn't find the remote. Gina couldn't lind the remote. We chal­lenged others to lind our remote, but all was in vain. I accused people of stealing our remote. We planned "miss­ing" signs to post around the dorm and contemplated offering a reward for information on its whereabouts. But nothing seemed to work. 
Basically, Gina and I realized we were losers. 

This is not a fun conclusion to have about oneself. It had crossed my mind before, but now, there was no doubt. The remote was gone. I was reasonably sure it was my fault. I was a loser. 
We checked under the futon. It was­n't there. We checked every drawer in the room (that's a lot). After days of stress, there was nowhere to search but under the beds. Flinging laundry aside and dragging out golf clubs and Christmas decorations, I took a flash­light and crawled under the bed. First, I found a pen. Then I found a ChapStick. Then my fmgers touched plastic. I craned my neck. It was gray and rectangular. Could it be -was it possibly-yes! 
On Wednesday night, the remote came home. Well, technically it had always been home. But we found it, which was the important thing. There was much rejoicing in Cavanaugh Hall, featuring a lot of high-pitched shriek­ing. We had defeated a piece of plastic. And I was no longer a loser.

Danish Santa compensated for reindeer's death 
COPENHAGEN -The Danish Air Force said Thursday it paid about $5,000 in compensation to a part-time Santa Claus whose reindeer died of heart failure when two lighter jets roared over his farm. 
The animal, named Rudolf, was grazing at the farm of Olavi Nikkanoff in central Denmark when the screaming F -16 jets passed overhead at low altitude in February. 
The reindeer collapsed and died, leaving Nikkanoff with the prospect of only one animal pulling his sleigh next Christmas. 
He complained to the air force, which agreed to compensate him for the cost of the reindeer and veterinary expenses. 
"We got a letter from Santa complaining about his reindeer's death and looked into it seriously," air force spokesman Capt. Morten Jensen said. 
Street plagued by foul odor gets relief 
SAN JOSE, Calif. ­Residents of a suburban street plagued with a revolt­ing sewer stench are fmally getting some, ahem, relief. 
"Sometimes, it's just over­whelming," accountant Nikki Warner said of the intersection of Zanker and Trimble. "Sometimes you go outside and, ugh." 
"Like ammonia and rotten eggs," said M~chael O'Connell, an engineer with the city's Public Works Department. 
The area's main sewage line -a handmade brick pipe -was installed in the late 1890s, before Teddy Roosevelt was president. It's been collecting sewage and stench ever since.

SMC seniors greet fathers on campus 
Series of events includes "Casino Night," ND vs. Purdue game watch, closing Mass 
By KELLY MEEHAN News Writer 

Saint Mary's seniors will be spending a majority of their weekend with a very impor­tant man in their life -and it will not be their boyfriends. 
Instead, it will be their dads. 

More than 150 seniors and their fathers will participate in the College's traditional "Senior Dad's Weekend," which kicks ofT tonight at 8 
p.m. with "Casino Night" at Windsor Hall in South Bend. 
In keeping with tradition from previous years, "Casino Night" was originally sched­uled to be held at Heartland, however, new owners refused to honor a contract with Saint Mary's. 
What originally seemed to be an obstacle for the Senior Dad's planning committee proved very beneficial in the end. 
''I'm truly glad though that it is at Windsor Hall because it brings more class to the night and the manag­er at Windsor 
"I am a little nervous to see how the tailgate goes because we will be serving alcohol, and everyone drinking will not be allowed to leave the student lounge, which, if you ask me, cannot hold over 300 people ­but we'll make it work," Cam pe said. 
Thn last scheduled event will be a closing Mass at 9:45 a.m. on Sunday morning at the Church of Loretto. 
The weekend allows snniors to show their dads what life is like at Saint Mary's, and events are scheduled so that students have free time to do just this. 
"Everyone is excited about taking our dads out and show­ing them the 'nightlife' of South Bend, although I'm not really sure if my dad will truly appreciate the sweaty erowd­edness of the Backer," senior Anna llaneock said. "Hegardless I'm sure it will be a fun weekend, and an impor­tant tradition for us to get to spend a weekend just bonding with our dads, and showing them what our lives are

"Casino Night" will be a dressy-casual event where stu­dents and their dads will be entertained while partaking in various casino games. During the evening there will be a live auction to raise money for senior class events, such as the senior formal. Bids will be placed on such things as front row graduation seats, a year­long parking spot in the Special Events lot and Hummer driving service for dinner at The Vine. 
On Saturday seniors and their dads are invited to attend Notre Dame vs. Purdue game watch at 4:30 p.m. in the Student Center. In years past, the game watch has been at The College Football Hall of Fame, however, it was decided that it would be held at the Student Center this year in order to show off the new facility.

"I think it is important to keep the Senior Dad's Weekend tradition alive because it lets us reflect on how much we've grown as women," she said. "We're not daddy's little girl anymore, even though we may still feel like it." 
Rizzo is grateful for week­ends such as Senior Dad's that allow her to relax and spend time with her father, who was last on campus the day she moved her in. 
"Spending time with your dad [at Saint Mary's) is not something all girls get a chance to do each year," she said. "By designating a week­end and sponsoring events, Saint Mary's can make it easi­er to hang out with your dad."

With hard-won tickets, fans flock to Purdue 
By ADRIENNE RUFFNER News Writer 
Whether it meant taking their chances in the ticket lottery or masquerading on stage as Disney characters, students scrambled to get tickets to Saturday's Notre Dame football game against Purdue in West Lafayette, Ind. 
The Student Union Board (SUB) sponsored a ticket lottery last week and sold 346 game tickets for $43 each to students whose numbers were drawn. This is roughly the same am8unt of tick­ets Notre Dame usually receives for away games, SUB officials said. Tickets were sold at the LaFortune Box Office from Sept. 19 to Sept. 26, and all extra tick­ets sold quickly Tuesday morn­ing. 
Juniors Maria Hinton and Amy Lauterbach were among those with lucky lottery numbers. 
"We got eight tickets through the lottery, then went early on Tuesday to the Lafun Box Office and bought two more," Hinton said. "It's my first away game, so it will be interesting to see how other schools have football week­ends."

SUB said they are sponsoring two buses that will leave campus 12 p.m. Saturday. Bus tickets were $10 each and-like the game tickets -they sold out quickly. 
Farley Hall's "What Would You Do for Purdue Tickets?" contest Monday allowed students to com­pete for tickets by exhibiting their creativity to impress the judges. 
Junior Jamie Blanke was one of the talented students to win free tickets. He and three friends dressed as Disney characters and sang songs to fit the theme of the upcoming game. Blanke sported the garb of Ariel from the Little Mermaid, complete with a green sheet for the fin and two dining hall bowls for a seashell bra. 
"The bottom line is, you have to be pretty crazy to dress up in those costumes and sing the songs we sang," said Blanke. "The judges agreed that we were crazy. I was very pleased with the opportunity to win free tickets." 
Blanke and his friends plan to bring some of their "craziness" to West Lafayette this weekend. 
"We're really looking forward to the game," Blanke said. "We're going to bring that same craziness that we used to win the competition when we go to Purdue on Saturday." 
No matter how students got their tickets, many -like Lauterbach -are optimistic about the outcome of Saturday's game. 
"Both teams have dynamic offenses, but I'll think we'll win," she said.

"The bond is unique, eternal and absolutely embodies the essence of the Notre Dame mystique under the direction of Our Lady and Our Lord," McGurty said. 
Gagliardi said that the val­ues and moral barometer instilled in him during his time at Notre Dame bring him great strength as he serves in Iraq. 

Keeping Notre Dame alive 
"Over here, there is a special bond that exists among all service members making the same sacrifices away from friends, family and home to do our small part in service to the country we call home and that bond is definitely intensified between graduates of Our Lady's university," Gagliardi said. 
To keep the Notre Dame spirit alive overseas, Gagliardi brought a few mementos. 
"1, of course, brought out my new 'The Shirt' for the start of the Charlie Weis football era, as well as two Notre Dame flags that adorn my small liv­ing area here at Korean Village," he said.

Roberts becomes Chief Justice 
Supreme Court replaces Rehnquist; Roberts is youngest to hold position 
Associated Press 

WASIIJNGTON -This 
time, the son didn't steal the 
show from his dad. 

Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Hobnrts Jr. finally had the spotlight to himself Thursday, becoming the youngest chief justice of the United States in two centuries after winning sup­port from more than three­fourths of an often partisan­chargt>d Senate. 
Hobl'rts' two-year journey from a respected but little­known appellate lawyer to the 17th chief justice of the Supreme Court was often punctuated by the public antics of his rambunctious son, Jack, 4. 
When President Bush first announced Hoberts' nomi­nation to the nation's high­est court in July, Jack danced enthusiastically ­and most distractingly ­throughout the president's remarks. 
At his confirmation hear­ing earlier this month, Jack flexed his muscles for pho­tographers, then snuggled into his dad's arms. And two years ago, during Senate confirmation hearings on Hoberts' nomination as a Washington D.C. federal appeals judge, Jack and the now 5-year-old Josephine were present and, it seems, making some noise. "The committee has already heard some unscheduled testimony from my children, Josephine and Jack," Hoberts joked then. 
But on Thursday, as their dad was sworh in at the White llouse East Hoom by Justice John Paul Stevens, .Jack sat politely if a bit fidg­ety in the front row with his family. 
Bush noted that Jack is a "fellow who's comfortable with the cameras" to laugh­ter from the crowd. Roberts got in a dig too, noting his antics earlier in the month. "We found a way to get Jaek into the committee room, introduced to the committee and back out again without any serious crisis," Hoberts

said. 
Hoberts, at 50, will also have to learn to handle judi­cial crises at the Supreme Court, which is as divided as the nation over abortion and other tumultuous social issues. The court opens a new term on Monday 
"All Americans can be confident that the 17th chief justice of the United States will be prudent in exercising judicial power, firm in defending judicial inde­pendence and above all a faithful guardian of the Constitution," the president said. 
Bush is expected to make a seeond Supreme Court nomination within days, one that conservatives hope will move the court to the right. Heplacing Hehnquist with Hoberts keeps the court's current balanee, but replac­ing the moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor with a conservative could tilt it rightward. 
Hoberts called the Senate's 78-22 bipartisan vote for him "eonlirmation of what is for me a bedrock principle, that judging is dif­ferent from politics." All of the Senate's 55 Hepublicans, half of the 44 Democrats and independent James Jeffords of Vermont supported him. 
"What Daniel Webster termed the miraele of our Constitution is not some­thing that happens in every generation, but every gen­eration in its turn must accept the responsibility of supporting and defending the Constitution and bear­ing true faith and allegianee to it," Hoberts said. 
A erowd induding seven of the eight sitting justiees, Hoberts' parnnL<>, Hosnmary and .John Sr., Senate sup­porters and White House well-wishers stood and applauded as Hoberts kissed his wife and shook Stevens' hand. The audi­ence also included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and White House eounsel Harriet Miers, both of whom have been mentioned as candidates for O'Connor's seat. 

Former aide testifies in Illinois trial 
Associated Press 

CIIICAGO -The political strate­gist who helped engineer former Gov. George Hyan 's rise to power took the witness stand Thursday and in testimony laced with wise­craeks began telling a jury how Hyan doled out state contracts, leases and favors to the well-con­nected. 
Scott Fawell waved to spectators and grinned broadly as he took his seat. lie nodded to Hyan, saluted a newspaper reporter and made no effort to disguise his disdain for the prosecutors who put him in federal prison for graft. 
Asked by proseeutor Patrick M. Collins why he agreed to testifya­
gainst his former boss, the 48-year­old Fawell cited his love for his fiancee and added: "And you guys got my head in a vise." 
Hyan, 71, is charged with racket­eering conspiracy, fraud and other offenses. Prosecutors say he doled out contracts and business to polit­ical insiders in exchange for cash, free vacations and other favors while he was Illinois secretary of state in the 1990s. Ile is on trial along with his lobbyist friend Larry Warner. 
Fawell served as Hyan's chief of staff in the secretary of state's ofl'iee and masterminded Hyan's campaign for governor in 1998. 
Fawell, who is serving a 6 1/2­year sentence in federal prison for 
racketeering and fraud, said he considers Hyan and Warner his friends and is testifying against them only bncausn he is facing even more time behind bars for bid-rigging and hopes to get lenient treatment for himself and his fiancee -who also has pleadnd guilty. 
The witness said he compilnd a master list while working in the seeretary of state's office that showed how Byan doled out jobs, speeial license plates, contracts and other favors.

SEC investigates Frist's HCA

Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON -Tho Securities and Exchangn Commission is investigating HCA Inc., the hospital chain founded by Senatn Majority Leader Bill Frist's family, tho company said Thursday: 
Fndoral prosecutors and tho agency also are probing Frist's saln of stock in IICA, the Nashville, Tenn.-based company that grew into the nation's hu·gest for-profit health earn chain. 
I!CA, founded by Frist's fatlwr and brother, said it is cooperating. 
SEC spokesmen have declined comment on tho invnstigation. 
Doeurnents show that whiln IICA insiders were selling millions or dollars of their own stock this year, they were also· painting an upbeat picture of the eom­pany's outlook for investors 
On June 14. the day after Frist. H-Tnnn., ordered his sharos sold, HCA ollieers at a Goldman Sachs health caro conference in Laguna Niguel, Calif., spoke opti­mistically about the eompa­ny's prospects. 
Vietor Campbell, HCA's senior vice president or corporate communications and government relations, soothod investor concerns about unpaid patient debts and worries about patient volumes. 
lie advocated for a still­pending Senate bill that would limit the establish­ment. or physician-owned specialty hospitals. 
In the month before the spoeeh, Campbell sold about $12 million worth of stock. It was part of a mas­sive insider sell-ofl' at HCA that totaled some $112 mil­lion between this January and Juno. 
Those sales were dis­closed publicly through fil­ings with the SEC. 

fiCA sharos peaked about a week later, dosing at $58.40 on June 22. On July 13, they tumbled 9 percent following the company's announcement that it would not meet earnings expectations. 
In his remarks, Campbell did not speculate about the company's earnings, but spoke of a number of posi­tive trends for the compa­ny. The only expense line the company didn't like, he told investors, was the issue of money lost from treating uninsured patients who nover paid. But he said that was improving. 
The speHch helped fend optimism surrounding IICA stock, said Oksanna ButlPr, a senior health care indus­try analyst with Citigroup Investment Besearch. 
Campbell did not respond to requests for comment. HCA spokesman Jeff Prescott said, ''I'll let what he said at the conference speak for itself." 
Prist's staff discussed selling all remaining IICA 
stock in April, as well as that of his wife and chil­dren, Frist said. The sales, ordered on June 13, wore eompletnd by July 1. 
Frist said hn sold the shares to eliminate the appearance of a conlliet of interest, using only infor­mation that was publicly available. His ofTice has said he had gotten notice of a formal investigation, which grants subpoena powers to investigators to obtain information and documHnts.

INDIANAPOLIS -Eli Lilly and Co. said Thursday it will add a black-box warning to its attention deficit med­ication Strattera that the drug could inerPase suicidal thoughts among youths. 
Lilly will add the warning to labPI worldwide for Strattera, for which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a health advi­sory Thursday after reviewing clini­cal trial data submitted by the com­pany. 
Lilly said that reports of suicidal thoughts by children and adolescents taking the drug were rare. Details on the labeling are being worked out with tho FDA, along with regulators in Europe and Australia. 
FDA ol'lkials said in addition to t))e blaek-box warning -the most prominent of medication warnings ­the Indianapolis-based company will also have to develop a medication guide for patients and health care providers. 

Dr. Thomas Laughren, director of the FDA's division of psychiatry prod­ucts, said in December the federal government asked Lilly to review 13 clinical trials conducted on children to assess a suicide risk. 
"The risk for any individual patient taking this drug is quite low, but from a public health standpoint, four (case) per thousand is a fairly big sig­nal, given there are tens of thou­sands or patients taking this drug," Laughren said. "We do think that preseribers and patients need to be aware of this risk that we've just dis­eovernd." 
About :{.4 million patients -adults and children -have been prescribed Strattera since it beeame available. 
with Lilly officials saying about 75 percent of those taking the mediea­tion are children. 
Company ofTicials stressed the inei­denee of suieidal thoughts among children were rare, the bnnelits of the drug continue to outweigh its risks. 
"It is uncommon and it is about thoughts, but it is something we want people to be aware of." said Dr. John Hayes, vice president of Lilly's research laboratories. 
Lilly submitted to the FDA results from Strattera clinit:al trial that found five Strattera-trnatnd youths had increased suicidal thoughts out of 1,357 patients, while none of R51 patients taking a placebo showt~d such changes. The t:ompany said orw youth attmnpted suicide during its Strattera trials, but that rnsnardwrs saw no signs of incrnasnd sui<:idal thoughts among adults.

"You can't know 
what we are really 
and Microsoft Corp. aren't the only ones tracking Google. Big media and telecommunications companies also are on the look­out, realizing they too may face a looming threat. 
The theories about Google's next move are all over the map. 
Is Google cobbling together an Internet-driven computing plat­form that would challenge Microsoft's stranglehold on the personal computer? Is the com­pany preparing to build a wire, less network that would provide free Internet access nation­wide? Will Google dip into its huge hoard of cash to pull off a blockbuster deal? 
There's a consensus on one overarching point: "Google wants to be everywhere that people are," said Danny Sullivan, who has followed the book on Google's 

impact and poten­tial, thinks the company's mys­tique has turned it into the equivalent of a Rorschach inkblot -an amorphous object that's defined by the hopes and fears of whomever is looking at it. 
"When we see a remarkable new company that redefmes the technology industry, we either fear it because of all the things it might do or we expect more from it than it can possibly deliver," Battelle said. 
Some previous theories about Google's maneuvering already have turned out to be off base. For instance, last year, it was widely believed that the compa­ny planned to introduce its own Web browser. Schmidt has since thrown cold water on that idea. 
There's little doubt that 
will join a payroll that already has nearly tripled in the past two years to 4,200 employees. 
For all its growth, Google remains a relative midget alongside Microsoft, which employs 61,000 workers and holds nearly $38 billion in cash. 
But few companies spend more time worrying about Google than Microsoft, and not just because its rival has been raiding its work force to lure away talented engineers. The defectors include Kai-Fu Lee ­currently prevented from work­ing on search technology because Microsoft sued him for jumping to Google -and Mark Lucovsky, a key architect of the Windows operating system. 
Since 2003, Google has rolled out an assortment of software and services that could coa­ticed at Microsoft headquarters, where CEO Steve Ballmer vowed to kill Google in an obscenity-laced tirade late last year, according to a sworn court declaration submitted by Lucovsky in the lawsuit target­ing Lee. 
Ballmer has described Lucovsky's recollection as a "gross exaggeration." 
Google does seem to have designs that extend well beyond the turf of the world's richest and best-known technology company. 
Industry analyst Lauren Rich Fine suspects Google might use some of that money to buy a stake in its biggest business partner, America Online -and thus thwart Microsoft's reported attempt to form an alliance with 
AOL.

Future of big hurricanes lootns after Katrina and Rita 
Experts say Americans can expect to be pummeled by more catastrophic tropical storms over the next 20 to 30 years 
Associated Press 
Have we seen America's future through the eyes of hurri­canes Katrina and Rita? 
Monster storms drowning cities and obliterating coast­lines. Jobs vanishing and prices rising as ports and pipelines close. Millions fleeing, but many are trapped and die. Chaos reigns, paralyzing government and leaving the world's wealthi­est society humbled and fright­ened. 
Natural disaster in the United States has morphed to a danger­ous new level. Some experts say the nation can expect to be pummeled by more of these mega-catastrophes over the next 20 or 30 years in a nasty. conspiracy of unfavorable weather patterns, changing demographics and political denial. 
A month after Katrina and one week after Rita. it's not clear how the Unitnd States will play the new hand that nature has apparently dealt. 
"Are we prepared to lose a major city every year?" asks Carnegie Mellon University risk strategist Baruch Pischhoff. "It's cowardice not to ask the ques­tion. and cowardice on the pub­lic's part not to get engaged in the answer." 
"We failed quite significantly," says sociologist Havidn Rodrguez, director of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware. "Will what we've seen over the last few weeks continue to be the case? It could unless we pre­pare. People tend to forget les­sons learned. Governments tend to forget." 
Others cautiously see some hope in the waterlogged ruins of the Gulf Coast. They describe the latest hurricanes as a turn­ing point that could lead to improved public safety and infrastructure. 
"We often need events like this to change the mindset," said Mary C. Comerio, an architect and reconstruction researcher at the University of California­Berkeley. "And it's very hard to stop private investors and entre­preneurs from seeking opportu­nity. It's an amazing part of the American spirit." 
New Orleans and the Gulf Coast might even be a living lab­oratory for sustainable develop­ment and commerce that can withstand future calamities. For example, New Orleans' historic core might be reopened for tourism, but neighborhoods could be rebuilt on safer, firmer ground using more efficient 21st century technologies. 
Link the two with a train, one expert suggested. Oh, and better make it elevated. 
"The first rule of sustainability is to align with natural forces, or at least not try to defy them," said environmentalist Paul Hawken, a leading voice in the green design and green com­merce movements. "There is no reason to go backwards in redesigning the city." 
America's eastern and Gulf coasts always have been in the path of powerful storms. The nation's weather history occa­sionally has been splattered with other Category 4 and 5 hurricanes -the strongest, largest storms, which pack the punch of hundreds of nuclear weapons and have the most potential to devastate huge swaths of land. 
But since 1995, hurricanes 

have become more frequent and more intense. Some scientists say the United States is on the bad side of a natural storm cycle, while others notice the trend may coincide with the recent increase in air and sea temperatures attributed to glob­al warming. 
Statistics show the planet to be increasingly unsafe. Globally, mo"re than 2.5 billion people were affected by floods, earth­quakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters between 1994 and 2003, a 60 percent increase over the previous two 10-year periods, U.N. officials report. 
Those numbers don't even include the millions displaced by last December's tsunami, which killed an estimated 180,000 people. 
Damage to insured property around the world in 2004 by natural disasters totaled $49 bil­lion, according to the Zurich­based insurance giant Swiss Re. And that figure doesn't include the tsunami, either. Of the total, some calculations suggest that as much as $45 billion in losses came from a quartet of Florida hurricanes -Charley, Ivan, Frances and Jeanne. 
The overall insured loss for 2004 is more than twice the $23 billion annual average in prop­erty losses since 1987, confirm­ing a "discernible upward trend," Swiss Resaid. 
So what makes natural events potentially more disastrous now? The weather might be changing for the worse. But the real difference is demographics. 
How and where Americans live today make the nation espe­cially vulnerable to these unstoppable events. 
In the last several decades, the nation's population has migrated toward the coasts, and the value of possessions has increased substantially. · 
More than half of the nation's 297 million people live in coastal areas. Florida's popula­tion has increased fivefold since 1950, and now 80 percent live within 20 miles of salt water. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, seven of the nation's top 10 fastest growing states are coastal, including California, whose population has increased from 10 million in 1950 to more than 33 million today.

Wild gorillas use basic tools, researchers say 
Associated Press 
For the first lime, biologists have documented gorillas in the wild using simple tools, such as poking a stick in a swampy pool of water to check its depth. 
Until now, scientists had seen gorillas use tools only in captiv­ity. Among thn great apes, tool usn in the wild was thought to be a survival skill reserved for smallor chimpanzeos and orangutans. 
The researeh in the Hepublie of Congo's rainforests was IHd by Thomas Breuer of the Wildlifo Conservation Soeiety at the Bronx Zoo, whieh released dntails of his study. Breuer is in J\frka and was not immediately available for an interview.

Science) Biology. Video of the gorillas will be broadcast Saturday on the PBS program "Wild Chronicles." 
Fairly or not, gorillas have been considered less capable than other great apes, in part because they have not been as extensively studied. 
Chimps, for example, have been continuously observed in the field for 40 years since Jane Goodall launched her landmark study at Gombe Stream in Tanzania. They have become stars of television documen­taries and glossy magazine arti­cles, displaying their extensive of use of rocks to break open hard-shelled nuts and sticks to "fish" termites from mounds. 
In contrast, gorillas are much larger, stronger and slower. 
"Chimps are portrayed as the super-ape and gorillas are the big brutes in the forest," said Richard Carroll, a primate export and direetor of the Africa program at the World Wildlife 
nd in Nouabai-Ndoki National Park where monitoring has bnnn ongoing since February 11JIJ5.

Climbing out of the pool. she retrieved a braneh from a dead treo and used the stiek to lost the depth of the water. 
In NovmnbPr, a second f'emalo gorilla (named Efi) used a detadwd tron trunk to support lwrself' with one hand while digging f'or lwrbs with the other hand. She also used the tree trunk as a bridgo to cross a muddy pateh or ground.

"New studies like this show that especially lowland gorillas are very chimplike in their abil­ities," he said. 
Carroll said the new study was made possible by the establishment of protected parks in Congo by agreements betwnon conservation groups, international agencies and the government. The populations of gorillas and other groat apes are severely imperiled by log­ging, hunting and outbreaks of the Ebola virus. And, civil war in Congo has made field science dangerous for years. 
"It's a tributn to conservation efforts that allow people to sit and observe and not be in fear of their lives," he said.

Africans flee destitution 
Associat~d Press 

MELILLA -Climbing ladders fashioned from tree branches, hundreds of Africans from the continent's poorest countries threw themselves over razor­wire fences Thursday to gain a foothold in Europe -the latest human avalanche seeking entry into a pair of barren Spanish enelaves in Morocco. 
Five people were killed trying to enter the city of Ceuta, two reportedly shot from the Moroccan side. Spain called out army troops with automatic weapons to patrol the frontier there and in Melilla, another centuries-old Spanish city on the northern coast of the only African country with land bor­dering a member of the European Union. 
·Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, speaking after a summit with his Moroccan counterpart Driss Jettou, promised a thorough investigation but avoided point­ing fingers. 
"It is premature to arrive at conclusions," Zapatero said. 
Spain is used to heartbreak­ing stories of destitute Africans risking their lives to reach Europe's southern gateway in hopes of starting a new life. 
Dangerously overcrowded boats -often with women who are pregnant or carrying infants -cross the Strait of Gibraltar from Morocco to reach the Spanish mainland. Youths cling to the underside of trucks being ferried aeross the treacherous waterway. Men podal across in bicycle-like ves­sels. 
And while midnight dashes up and over the fimces outside Melilla and Ceuta are nothing new, the volume of the human waves doing so rose dramati­cally this summor and partieu­larly this woek. 
On Tuesday alone, two sepa­rate groups of 500 rushed the frontier at Melilla, aQd Spain says about 300 made it in. Last year there were seven such attempts, but so far this year the numbnr is up to around 25, including nine sinee the end of August. 
"In the last few days we have had a different phenomenon, an avalanche of immigrants not seen before that surely has cir-cumstantial causes that we will combat," Zapatero said Thursday. 

At least three Africans diod in recent crossings, but Thursday's deaths were the first to include reports of gun­fire. 
The Spanish government said two Africans died on Spanish soil and three in Morocco. The national news agency Efe quot­ed sources close to the investi­gation as saying two of the bod­ies found on the Spanish side had gunshot wounds from behind, suggesting they had been shot from the Moroccan side. 
lie spoke as many of the new arrivals in· Melilla -virtually all of them young black men, from countries like Nigeria, Mali, Cameroon and elsewhere -lined up for meals under a hot, muggy sun or rested in tents set up to accommodate them at a now-overflowing holding center built years ago. 
Eric Aborah, 17, said he left his native Ghana 2 1/2 years ago on an odyssey through a half-dozen countries in Afriea before making it to Morocco, where he spent eight months living in the forest bd'ore cross­ing into Melilla on Tuesday. 
Felix Akah, a 33-year-old electrician from Cameroon, said he lost his job when the French company he worked for was bought by Americans and lw could no longer support his wife and two daughters, aged 1 and 
3. He said it took him almost nine months to make his way north to Morocco, hoping to find work in Spain or elsewhere in Europe. 
He, J\borah and others described their feat of' climbing ladders fashioned from tree branches held together with bicyde inner tubes or strips of fabric and crossing two 1 0-foot razor wire fences -separated by a thin strip of' land -in the middle of the night. 
It works like this: prop the ladder against the first fence, climb to the top, try not to fall as a colleague hands you anoth­er one, then scamper down and use that second laddor to scaln the second fence. Then, just jump. 
"It is not easy to dimb and you only have to give everything to God and jump," said Aborah. 
Zapatero's political opponcnl'> contend the recent human waves were instigated by Morocco, which elaims both Ceuta and Melilla, pnrhaps to put pressure on the Spanish prime ministnr at Thursday's summit. 
Aborah, asknd if' Morocean authorities urgnd him to make the crossing, said he did it becausn he hnard a largo ~-,rroup of men wern going to makn their move Tuosday and he sim­ply joined in. 
The opposition Popular Party says Zapatero's Socialist gov­ernnwnt is in part to blame fi1r the influx, arguing that an amnesty it pushed through Parliament this year for thou­sands of' undocumentnd for­eigners is luring many other Africans in the mistaken bnlinf' they too can get papers. 
Walt Disney Co. gives African art collection to Smithsonian 
Donated artwork includes 525 pieces representing 75 peoples and 20 countries; some works date to 15th century 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -J\ major collection of Afriean artwork, somo dating to the 1400s, was donated Thursday to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African Art. 
The Walt Disney-Tishman CollfH:tion, 525 pieces in all, ineludes most major styles of African Art and represfmts 7 5 peoplns and 20 countries. 
"This is a collection that has been sought al'ter by everyone in tho museum world because it is so great," said Smithsonian Secretary Lawronce Small. "Finally, for reasons I wholeheartedly agree with, it came here." 
The Walt Disney Co.'s outgo­ing chief executive, Michael Eisner, said over the ynars the company had fielded numer­ous requests for the collection. He said there were rnpeated calls from French President Jacques Chirac, who wanted specific pieces to be displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris. 
"It became clear that this kind or collection was inappro­priate in a warehouse," Eisner said, adding that it also became obvious that the Smithsonian, a museum for all Americans, was the best repository. 
While some pieces in the col­lection have remained in the warehouse, museum curator Bryna Freyer said Disney has been extremely generous in lending particular pieces to museums around the world, and the National Museum of African Art will continue to loan out pieces. 
The museum will include a few of the pieces in exhibits in the next few months. After February 2007, it will main­tain at least 60 pieces at all times, and the items displayed may change. 
Museum curators said the donation will fill gaps in their current collection and help them to better demonstrate themes in African Art. 
Some of the objects have already been on display at the Smithsonian, including a 15th­century hunting horn from Sierra Leone and several ivory armlets made for Nigerian kings. 
Others are more recent, such as a 20th-century headdress mask from the Calabar region of Nigeria. Made from wood covered with antelope skin, the mask depicts a woman whose long hair is curled like horns in a style once worn during girls' coming-out cere­monies. 
Curator Christine Mullen Kreamer said the museum will now have one of the nation's best collections of skinned 
masks from that region. 
The collection was bought by Disney in 1984 from New York real estate developer Paul Tishman and his wife. Huth, who began collecting African art in the early 1960s. 
Because some of the pieces are so rare· and African art prices have risen so mueh in recent years, the exact valun of the collection has not boon determined. Museum curators are not even familiar with many of the items. 
"I tend to consider a numbor of the pieces priceless," said Freyer, "but you can't put that on an insurance form." 
Disney declined to say how mueh the collection is insured.

Editorial

The University drew perhaps more bad press University is more than just its students, facul­
than eyer before. Former Irish players such as Chris Zorich and Aaron Taylor condemned the school for its action. In a taped interview with Willingham last Saturday, ABC's John Saunders broached the subject again, with a line of questioning suggesting Willingham's firing was racially motivated. 
So the recent story of new head coach Charlie Weis and his promise to call a play for 10-year-old Montana Mazurkiewicz, who Weis said died Sept. 22 of brain cancer, is a reminder of what this University truly represents. The story was a welcome one for Notre Dame football fans, whether they agreed with Willingham's firing or not. 
lt is a story the nation can look at to remind itself why sports are important in the first place. 
The firing of one millionaire coach and the hiring of anoth­er should not be the focus of sports. But too often the media and the public forget this -they argue about the details and 
ty, administrators and alumni. It's also about those, like Montana, who have never attended a class but still feel like part of the Notre Dame family. 
The heart of Notre Dame -and sports in general -lies in kids like Montana, who loved Notre Dame football so much that only a visit from Weis could make him smile. 
In 20 years, no one will rnmember the final score of last week's game at Washington. No one will recall how many yards Brady Quinn threw for or how many tackles Brandon Hoyte made. Hardly anyone will worry about how Weis com­pared to Willingham in their much-hyped meeting. No one should care now. 
In the light of Montana's story, everyone will reflect and remember there are more important things in life than the development of the West Coast offense. And because of Weis, everyone can now remember what the true family spirit of this University really means. 

Following the leader 
By now you've surely heard the story. It has been covered by both the local and national media. Headlines such as "Weis Uses Play Called By Dying Ten­Year-Old Boy" and "Weis Honors Dying Boy By Using His Called Play" have appeared in news­stands across the country all week. This will likely be the feel good story of the year (yes, that even goes for a win over USC or a BCS game). Over the past few days, we've all N0b0 d L ·k

Dumb Blonde 
Charlie Weis granti­ng Montana Mazurkiewicz's dying wish during Saturday's game, but it is important to reflect on the magnitude of what hap­pened. 

Many of us get carried away with Notre Dame Football. I am related to plenty of people who place almost too great an emphasis on the Fighting Irish; heck, I do it myself. However, what happened last Saturday, amidst perhaps the biggest media circus of the college football season, put Notre Dame Football into proper perspective. 
The Mazurkiewicz family is unques­tionably a clan of die-hard Notre Dame fans. Anyone who has their doubts need only look at the names of the fam­ily's two sons: Rockne and Montana. Instead of opting for more traditional names, the Mazurkiewicz's chose to name their children after Notre Dame's greatest coach and its most recogniza­ble player. Perhaps Montana had no choice but to be a fan of the Fighting

Last week Montana, who was suffer­ing from an inoperable brain tumor, was given an opportunity to meet the head coach of his favorite football team. lie was in a great deal of pain and his prognosis was not good. However, the young boy was thrilled to talk to Charlie Weis when he came to his home last week. 
They talked about his namesake, Joe Montana; they talked about the loss to Michigan State; they talked about life. Weis asked Montana if there was any­thing he could do for him. Coach Weis knew he could not save the boy's life, but he wanted to do something to make Montana's last days just a little brighter. He suggested that Montana pick what the Irish's first play against Washington would be. Montana decid­ed that the game should open with a "pass right." 
Sadly, Montana passed away on Friday, and he never got an opportuni­ty to watch the Irish take the field against Washington. Upon hearing that Montana had died, Coach Weis called the Mazurkiewicz's to offer his condo­lences. In doing so, he reminded the grieving family, "This game is for Montana, and the play still stands." 
As it turned out, Notre Dame's first play on Saturday came from its own 1 yard-line; a place from which teams rarely pass. Weis, having put football in its proper perspective, kept his promise to Montana, dismissed conventional wisdom, and called for a "pass right." We'll never really know if it was skill or divine intervention, but Brady Quinn completed Montana's pass to Anthony Fasano for a 13-yard gain. 


:.,. 
Montana's story shows us how truly lucky we are to be part of the Notre Dame family. We are lucky to have a compassionate coach who is willing to run an ill-advised play in order to make a difference. We are lucky to have a leader who understands the importance of winning-both on and off the lield. We are lucky to once again have a coach who understands the magir and mystique of Notre Dame Football and is not afraid to put his faith in it. We am all lucky to be a part of an institution that has sueh an impact on people's lives that it can help comfort a dying boy in his last days. 
It all seems so simple: a good man doing what he could to fulfill a child's last wish. In reality, Coach Weis put an awful lot on the line when he called lit­tle Montana Mazurkiewicz's play dur­ing Saturday's game. He also helped put things into perspective. Wins and losses are important. (I'm sure that Notre Dame's storied football tradition had a lot to do with the Mazurkiewicz's affinity towards the University.) However, there are also moments when winning a football game becomes sec­ondary. It is these moments-when we applaud the team after a loss, when we win one for the Gipper, or when a coach calls a play for a dying boy ­that the true spirit of Notre Dame shines through.

Discrim.ination saddening 
As if denying homosexuals the right to legal marriage wernn't enough, the Catholic Church, who has already largnly alionated the gay population, may now bn considnring limiting the prinsthood to heterosexuals. Of course, it must bP becaus1~ bning homosexual automatically makes you a pedophile. A nearly coherent argu­nwnt against why marriage is rnstrided to heti~rosexuals is still not quite so dnar to me. 
So what all this means is, if you are gay, you can't have a valid relation­ship with another person of your sex or commit yourself to a life of chastity through the priesthood. According to the church, it is "obj1~ctively disor­dered" to act upon homosexual dnsires, ynt if a homosnxual, realizing that in order to he a good Catholic t.lwy must dwosn a lifo of celibacy, would like to dwos1~ tlw priesthood, it will no longer be an option. 
llonwsnxuals are discriminated against by a large faction of the popu­lation (as proven by the 13 states that passed anwndnwnts banning gay marriagn last November), rnfused a basic civil right, and now possibly r1~fusml thn right to follow the church's teaching and their religious ntlling. To me, all the discrimination that is occurring against homosexuals is so blatantly rl:'miniscent of other historical American (and human) blunders regarding race, religion, nationality and the like, that for on<~e I can say I can understand how peo­ple can stand by and watch these tragedies occur. It's not that we are all just standing by; the problem is that trying to fix the problem is like yelling at a brick wall.

into a motorbikn-loving nation likn Italy. To Anwrkans, biggnr is always better. It's this warped mfmtality that parallels our glut­tonous eonsumption of energy, which will have an oven morn pronouncnd impact when winter arrivns. 
On Monday, Prnsident Bush urged American citizens to use public transporta­tion in light of the country's curnmt energy challenges. In 1979, Prnsident Jimmy Carter, who begged Americans to conserve while putting up with high gas priees and gas shortages, made similar pleas. Following his requests, Carter received malicious criticism and his approval rat­ings dropped lower than those of Nixon during the Watnrgate scandal. 
During the speech on July 15, 1979, President Carter didn't deny any wrongdo­ing on his part. I Ie admitted it whole-heart­edly. 
Even after his eloquent speech, few American sought to change their habits, but at least national policies concerning energy conservation were implemented. 
I doubt Bush will ever admit his complici­ty in America's energy wasting, nor is he likely to view American's rampant materi­alism as a problem, but it would be inter­esting to see what would happen if he did. However, even if Bush was as compassion­ate and thoughtful as Carter, it doesn't mean the majority of Americans would pay him any heed. 
To this day, public transportation is viewed as low-class instead of economical. Also, a false sense of urgency is the norm, and, as a consequence, people prnfer speeding on the streets rather than taking a bus. Americans are neck-deep in indifl'er­ence and there's no way spirit<> can be revi­talized by any spench. 
I hope, one day soon, America will embrace conservation and mmbat high energy priees bnlim~ they skyrocket. Because ifwe use up too much of our Strategie Petroleum Hesnrvns, which Bush is presm1tly tapping into to lwlp lowor gas priees, wn could be headed toward an energy disaster.

MEXICO CITY-A photo of Azteca Stadium has hung in Tony Parrish's locker for months. The San Francisco 41Jers' world-traveling safety has hnnn looking forward to this weekend. whnn he'll get the chance for a little adventurn along with a lit­tin football. 
Thn 41Jnrs and the Arizona Cardinals will mnet Sunday in Mexico City in tlw first rogular­snason game outside the United States. Like nwst of the players on both dubs, Parrish is worried about his team's record, wary of the long road trip to a high-altitude eity _ but excited about making his­tory. 
"I always look forward to doing th'ings that pro­mote the game," said Parrish, who traveled to Mexico in tho offseason. "This will dnlinitely bo an evont that we'II look back on, and see it as a turning point in the international game." 
"There is an excitement to bo the first to do any­thing," Cardinals defensive ond Bertrand Berry said. "Whenever you are the lirst, you want to put your best foot forward." 
While the occasion is 
historic for the lnaguo's vast Mexican fan base and for the struggln to promote Anwriean football interna­tionally, the matr:hup isn't exactly a grabber. San Francisco, tho NJ'J.'s worst loam last year, is 1-2. The Cardinals (0-3) will play without two-time MVP quarterb<u~k Kurt Warner, who has a strained groin. 
But that doesn't snntn to be a problem to the esti­matl~d R5,000 fans who will fill the historic soccer stadium for an evening game. Nearly one in l'ive Mexicans identilied tlwm­s~dves as NFL fans in a recent survey, and the evont has drawn extensive

NCAA promises d_9nation to 
Hurricane Relief Effort 
INDIANAPOLIS -The NCAA is donating $1.5 million to hurricane relief and will collect additional money during its national champi­onships this year in a new partner­ship with Habitat for Humanity. 
Under the Home Team program announced Thursday, officials from NCAA Division II have made a $1 million donation, while the NCAA national office is donating an addi­tional $500,000. The NCAA has also agreed to promote Habitat for Humanity's hurricane rebuilding efforts at its national champi­onships. 
College sports' largest governing body also hopes athletes, coaches, athletics administrators and NCAA employees will volunteer to assist in rebuilding efforts. 
The NCAA plans to sponsor houses in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, where Hurricanes Katrina and Hita caused the most severe damage. The NCAA also will sponsor home-building projects for victims who have relocated to other cities.

Houston drops crucial game to Cubs at home 
Wild card race is far 
from definite with three games to play 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -Charles Gipson was cut down at home plate for the final out following Luke . Scott's double into the right­center gap, and the Chicago Cubs beat Houston 3-2 Thursday night to cut .the Astros' lead over Philadelphia in the NL wild-card race to two games. 
Derrek Lee broke a sixth­inning tie with his 46_th homer, and the Cubs led by one run entering the ninth. 
Ryan Dempster walked Orlando Palmeiro with one out, Gipson pinch ran and pinch-hit­ter Mike Lamb struck out. Scott pinch hit and doubled, with center fielder Corey .Patterson cutting the ball off. Patterson threw to second baseman Jose Macias, who made a perfect relay to catcher Henry Blanco, well ahead of Gipson. 
Blanco blocked the plate and the speedy Gipson tried to knock him over, but the catcher applied the tag and held on. 
Houston, which won 11 of its previous 14 games, missed a chance to clinch no worse than a tie for the wild card. The Astros (87 -72) still have a com­manding position over the Phillies (85-74) with three games to go. 
-
Philadelphia, which was off Thursday, begins a series Friday night at Washington. 
Houston finishes the regular season against the Cubs, with Andy Pettitte (17 -9) trying to win his eighth straight decision on Friday night. Roger Clemens (12-8) and Roy Oswalt (19-12) are the scheduled starters over the weekend. 
Glendon Rusch (9-8) won his fourth straight decision over five September starts for the Cubs, who must sweep the four­game series to avoid a losing record. Dempster got his 32nd save in 34 chances. 
Wandy Rodriguez (1 0-10) gave up three runs and five hits over seven innings. He is 1-4 in September, his only losing month this season. 
Lance Berkman led off the second with his 23rd homer to give the Astros a 1-0 lead. 
Matt Murton's homer in the fourth tied the game, and Lee put the Cubs ahead 2-1 in the sixth with a 401-foot drive off the facade behind the seats in left field. 
Jeromy Burnitz was hit by a Rodriguez pitch leading off the seventh, then went to third base after shortstop Adam Everett's throwing error on a grounder by Michael Barrett. Burnitz came home on a wild pitch, but Barrett was thrown out when the Cubs tried a squeeze play -Rusch was unable to get his bat on a pitch that bounced in front of the plate and was scooped up by catcher Raul Chavez. 
-
Jason Lane led off the Astros' seventh with a long flyball to left, but Murton made a leaping catch against the hand-operat­ed scoreboard. That was the 
-12th straight batter retired by 
Rusch. 
Chris Burke and Adam Everett then had consecutive singles before pinch-hitter Jeff Bagwell hit a sacrifice fly. Rusch got out of the inning by striking out pinch-hitter Jose Vizcaino, the last batter he faced. 
Milwaukee 2, Cincinnati 0 
The Milwaukee Brewers gave their fans their money's worth even though they got into the ballpark for free. 
Gary Glover allowed two hits over seven innings and struck out a career-high 10 in leading the Brewers to a win over the Cincinnati Reds on a "free admission" Thursday at Miller Park. 
By outpitching Eric Milton and combining with three relievers on a three-hitter, Glover put the Brewers (80-79) one win from their first non-los­ing season since 1992. Milwaukee finishes with a three-game series at Pittsburgh, where the Pirates are wrapping up their 13th straight losing season, the longest current drought in the major leagues. 
"I know for each man in here, they feel the same way I do. I don't want to be called a loser again," Milwaukee manager Ned Yost said. "It's important to us and it's important to our organization." 
The Brewers finished their final homestand 7-3 to assure their final weekend would be meaningful, at least in their eyes. 
"I think it would have been great if we could have won one more game somewhere along the way so that we had that 81st one here," Glover said. "I think that would have been big for the fans to see, to get it at home." 
The Brewers aren't thinking about taking just one game at PNC Park "because .500 is even. It's not necessarily a win­ning season," Glover said. "Everybody wants a winning season." 
So, they're shooting for at least two out of three, if not a sweep. 
Glover (5-4) surrendered just two singles, in the third and sixth inning, and didn't allow either runner past first base. He surpassed his previous career high of eight strikeouts, accom­plished Saturday against St. Louis. 
Jose Capellan got two outs in the eighth but walked a batter and surrendered a single to Ryan Freel. Julio Santana struck out Felipe Lopez looking on a full-count cut fastball, and Derrick Turnbow pitched a per­fect ninth for his 38th save in 42 chances. 
Milton (8-15) allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings, and his seven strike­outs gave him 999 for his career. 
"It was a great game pitched by everybody," Yost said. "You've got to give credit to Milton, too. He really pitched a whale of a ballgame and he's a good pitcher that struggled today. But the good pitcher in him really came out today." 
Bill Hall led off the fifth with his first of two doubles, took third on Rickie Weeks' ground ball to second base and then tried to score on a squeeze bunt. But Chad Moeller was struck in his right hand by Milton's fastball, forcing Moeller from the game with a bruised index finger and sending Hall back to third base. 
Jeff Cirillo pinch hit for Moeller with a 1-1 count and sliced a single under the glove of Lopez, who was playing in at shortstop. Brady Clark then tripled home Cirillo, and Damian Miller replaced Moeller in the field in the top of the sixth. 

Milton was glad to finish on a strong note but also eager to put his 2005 season behind him. 
"I've been looking forward to next year for a while," he said. "It's one of those things: throw­ing the ball well and the season ending. It's better than ending on a bad outing." 
Before the game, the Reds extended manager Jerry Narron's contract through next season with a mutual option for 2007. Narron began the season as the Reds bench coach and was appointed interim manager when Dave Miley was fired June 21 after the team's 27-43 start. 

New York Mets 11, Colorado 0 
At age 39 and in his 18th full season in the major leagues, Tom Glavine proved there's always something to be learned in baseball. 
Glavine reinvented himself midway through the year, adding a cutter and a curveball to his repertoire and he showed them off with a two-hitter, pitching the New York Mets to a romp over the Colorado Rockies. 
The Mets made it easy for Glavine with a 15-hit attack that included four home runs. David Wright hit two and reached 100 RBis for the sea­son, while Mike Piazza started what almost certainly is his final series as a Met with the 397th of his career. 
But this was a night that 

belonged to Glavine. Mixing speeds and never topping 86 mph with his fastball, he posted the 275th victory and 24th shutout of his career. 
"He was outstanding," said Willie Randolph, whose team won its 81st game, clinching a .500 finish in his first year as manager. "He's a pro. It was good to see him look like the Tom Glavine we all know and love. It goes to show what kind of pitcher he is. He did a great job." 

Nobody was happier about it than Glavine (13-13). · 
"It's satisfying, obviously, in the short term," he said. "I had a much better season than the first six weeks indicated. I had a game plan that should enable me to pitch beyond next year. The changes excite me. I'm more excited about where I am as a pitcher now." 
It showed as he struck out 11 and walked two. The last time he had 11 strikeouts in a game was May 13, 1994.

The CrifTins weren't pleased with thnir week one offensive performanen, so thny got back to the basics as well. 
"We worked on our offense to try to bring that together a lot morn," McNicholas said. "The first game, we only got one touchdown, so we put in a few new plays.

"Wn're definitely not taking them lightly," Lyzinski said. "They have a very good team. Last year they played us very, very hard. We're looking at them as a very good team. We're going to have to be at the top of our game to win this one."

The Bulll'rogs can still salvage a winning season if they turn things around and bnat Howard and then defeat Lewis on Tuesday. 
lloward is still looking for its first win and has yet to score this season, losing in blowouts against Lyons and Cavanaugh and a heartbreaker against Lewis in which the game was tied until the limtl three min­utes. 
Both teams are still working on their interception-prone offenses and strengthening their defenses. 
Neither teams' captains could be reached for comment Thursday.

Dillon vs. Alumni 
A neighborhood rivalry resumns Sunday as Dillon and Alumni square o!T at :~ p.m. at Hiehle Field in men's Gold league action. 
Dillon nnters ganw with a record of 1-1 and is looking to put all the pieens together against Alumni. 
While Dillon captain Kenny Cushing has been happy with the team so far and is looking to build on its past success, he also thinks it can take the play to another level. 
"Our team has been great Monday through Saturday, but we have not been putting it together on Sunday," Cushing said. 
Cushing also said he thought the key for this game and the overall strength of Dillon is strong communication and a solid rushing game. 
Both factors will lead to the efficient play the Big Red prides itself on. 
Alumni enters the game hun­gry after a tie and loss in its first two games of the season. 
Captain Hyan M~Get.tigan and senior Andrew Broslin both undnrstand the importance of' this game as a dassk rivalry. 
McGettigan also thought rush­·ing was going to be a key liutor. 
"Dillon has a good running game, but we think that W«~ match up against tlwm wnll." he said. 
On offense, Alumni plans to establish the run and usn it to set up the passing game. The Dawgs believe success on the .ground will lead to points on the score­board. 
Morrissey vs. Keough 
There is a high ehanee of a defensive struggle breaking out Sunday as Morrissey faces off with Keough at 2 p.m. at Hichlc Field. Both· teams are defensive­minded, and neither has eclipsed ten points in a game thus far. 
Morrissey is looking to capital­ize on the momentum it estab­lished by defeating O'Neill 6-2 last week in a game in which it ~ornplntPiy shut down tlw Angry Mob's oll'm1sn. 
"Our defens~ as a unit stnppPd up last wnPk and madP big plays for us," captain and starting run­ning back Nirk Kinin said.

Associated Press 
Juran Bolden remembnrs the day he met Detroit r.ookie receiver Mike Williams for the lirst time. 
Like Williams, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers nickel back grew up in Tampa. So, it's only natural that he's followed the hometown product's transition from high school phenom to college star to young pro. 
But one thing watching high­lights of Williams on television failed to prepare Bolden for was 
-the sheer physical presence of the Lions' first-round draft pick, who's 6-foot-5 and nearly 235 pounds. "I heard so much about him, but never had a

to see plenty more of Williams on Sunday, when the Lions (1-1) face the Bucs (3-0) in a game Williams has been looking for­ward to since April, when Detroit drafted him No. 10 over­all. 
While playing in his home­town for the first time as a pro figures to be exciting for the 21­year-old receiver, he will not be the most talked-about rookie named Williams in the game. 
The Bucs took Carnell "Cadillac" Williams with the fifth pick in the draft, and he's off to the best start by a first­year running back in league his­tory with a league-leading 434 yards through three games. 
Mike Williams had hoped his hometown team would draft him, but said he's happy in Detroit.

the Bucs were up front with me. They had a decision to make and they made it," the rookie said. 
"But look at the guy they picked. He might be a shoo-in for ofl'ensive rookie of the year. Cadillac is a good guy.... If they were going to pick somebody besides me, they picked a stand­up guy, and a guy that obviously made their team better." 
Tampa Bay is off to its best start since 2000, with Cadillac becoming the first player to begin his career with three con­
. secutive 100-yard rushing per­formances. The shoes and gloves he wore last week against Green Bay are already on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
after a court deci­sion allowing him to apply for early entry to the 2004 draft was reversed and the NCAA denied his petition to become re-eligible to play in college. 
Lions coach Steve Mariucci said Williams is still getting into football shape after being out for so long. He played eight snaps in Detroit's season-open­ing win against Green Bay and about 35 snaps in a loss to Chicago. 
"Mike is just trying to get bet­ter every week, earn himself more playing time and be a con­tributor," Mariucci said. 
Detroit has selected receivers in the first round each of the past three drafts. Williams feels good about the progress he's made toward getting on the field more with starters Roy Williams and Charles Rogers. 
MLB -AMERICAN LEAGUE 

Yanks-Sox also MVP race 
A-Rod and Ortiz will both makefinal case 
Associated Press 
It's not just the AL East title up for grabs when the New York Yankees go to Boston for three crucial games this week­end at Fenway Park. The league's Most Valuable Player award might go to the star whose team wins the division. 
Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz and Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez both have the eye-popping numbers that will put them near the top of most MVP ballots. But when it comes time for baseball writ­ers to decide who is the most valuable, they often pick players who helped their teams reach the postseason. 
"That's how you win an MVP -getting into the playoffs and starring for the Chicago Cubs in winning the World Series," Ortiz 1987, was the only player to said this week.

But the strength of Rodriguez's MVP case is still his offense: He is batting .320 with 129 RBis and 20 stolen bases, and he leads the league with 4 7 homers and 121 runs. Ortiz has played just 10 games at first base. 
"Both are great players, both have had great years," Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina said. "I think I give our guy the nod simply because he plays defense every day and Ortiz doesn't." 
But Ortiz is leading the majors with 146 RBis, he's batting .298 and he matched A-Rod with his 47th homer on Thursday night -a solo shot to tie the game in the eighth inning. Then, the man Boston calls "Big Papi" hit a game-ending single in the ninth.

"You don't think about that," Bnll said of opnning the season on the bench. "You come to play no matter where you are on tho dnpth chart. I got the call and made the most of it." 
This added to a 183-yard game last week against Nevada and Bell, the state of Colorado's career high school rushing leader, became the first player for Colorado State (2-2, 1-0 Mountain West) to r11cord back-to-back 100-yard games since 2002.

105 yards and two scores. This marked his 12th career 100-yard game and Anderson stayed well on pace to reach former Rams great Greg Primus for the most receptions and yards in school history. 
Little-used receiver Luke Roberts had five catches for 123 yards and an acrobatic touchdown, caught over the arms of an outstretched defender for a 13-9 lead late in the second. 
Throwing the passes was Justin Bolland, who went 17­for-26 for 318 yards and three scores. The Rams finished with 551 yards in offense. 
"Add all that up there and you've got a good, ol' fanny kicking," Air Force coach Fisher DeBerry said. "That's what it was." 
Air Force was coming off 

one-and three-point losses to Wyoming and Utah and was hoping to tighten up the small details and pull off a win in this rivalry between teams separated by 110 miles on 1­25. 
The difference in this one was about more than the small stuff, though. 
The Falcons were over­whelmed by Colorado State's offensive line, and as the game wore on, their exhaustion showed -never more than when Bell ran untouched on a misdirection play for a nine­yard score and a 41-23 lead with 6:10 left. 
Earlier, their tackling wasn't great, as Bell could attest. His 1-yard touchdown run in the first quarter came on a second or third effort after Air Force failed to bring him down.

Miallli pulls together after disastrous 2004 
Team still imperfect, but improved, with Saban 
Associated Press 
For the Miami Dolphins, ugly lapses persist: overthrown open receivers downfield, false-start penalties on consecutive snaps, a botched short field-goal attempt and three missed tack­les by the secondary on a single play. 
But through three games, the record looks much better. Miami is 2-1 and tied with New England for the AFC East lead. 
That's something to savor after last season, the Dolphins' worst since the 1960s, when they lost the first six games and finished an unsightly 4-12.

Giants and Jets agree to share new stadiu111 
First dual-owned and operated venue in history 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFOHD. N.J. ­The New York Giants and Jets agreed Thursday to build a stadium in the Meadowlands that would become the first NFL venue to be owned and operated by two teams. 
The facility will be built near stato-owned Giants Stadium, which is currently home to both teams and is among the league's oldest stadiums. 
Specific details about the sta­dium plan are to be developed over the next several months, including its new name. The teams plan to put the naming rights up for bid. 
Acting Gov. Hichard J. Corley announced the deal during a press conference at the stadi­um, saying it would guarantee both teams remain in New Jersey for the next 99 years. 
Corley, appearing with the owners of both teams, said the Jets would also relocate their practice facility to New Jersey. The Jets now practice at Hofstra University on Long Island. 
The project would create "tens of thousands of new jobs," Corley said, adding he was also looking forward to revenue from income taxes from the Jets' payroll. 
Jets president Jay Cross esti­mated the cost would be more than $800 million, and Giants chief operating officer John K. Mara figured the stadium 
Both teams -as well as the 
NFL and New Jersey-would 
like a roof, but the teams have 

said the $200 million addition­
al cost is beyond them. A roof 
would allow the Super Bowl 
and college basketball Final 
Four to be played at the state­

run Meadowlands complex. 
Regarding a roof, Corley said, 

"The state will not pay one 
penny for it." 
The state agreed to help both 

teams find new practice facili­
ties, although Mara said he 
hoped the Giants would be 

able to get a new location at 
the sports complex. 
Mara said that while his fam­. ily, a co-owner of the Giants, 
was sad that the stadium 
would have a new name, it 
would be necessary to sell 
naming rights in order to 
linance the project. He had no 
immediate estimate as to how 
much the naming rights would 
bring. 
He said he hopes the facility 
could open for the 2009 sea­

son. 
Since the teams will be equal 
partners, disputes over opera­

tions would be resolved 
through mediation, and ulti­
mately, the NFL commissioner, 
Mara said. 
The agreement, which Corley 
signed during the press confer-· 
ence, apparently ends several 

years of efforts by both teams 
to get new stadiums, albeit in 
different states. 
Jets owner Woody Johnson 

had his sights on rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan. A stadium on that site also would have served as the prime venue for the 2012 Olympic Games. But a key New York panel rejected any assistance in June, dooming that dream. 
Meanwhile, the Giants and New Jersey had reached an agreement in April for a team­owned 80,000-seat stadium at the Meadowlands.

Fall tournament play starts 
Thompson twins will play in All-American tournament doubles 
By RYAN KIEFER 
Sporrs Writer 
Looking across the net and seeing a teammate doesn't usu­ally get the competitive juices tlowing. But so has gone the life of a Notre Dame women's tennis player for 
.----. the last month. 
For the first four weeks of practice, the only compe­tition the team has experienced Connelly has been playing practice sets against each other. 
It's easy to see why the team is geared up to take to the courts this weekend. The Irish will enter players in two tourna­ments, the Hoosier Classic in Bloomington, Ind., and the Riviera/ITA All-American Championships in Pacific Palisades, Calif. 
It will be the first matches of the fall season for the majority of players, and coach Jay Louderback summed up his team's mentality in simple terms. 
"They are anxious to play other people," he said. 
Three Irish seniors -Lauren Connelly, Katrina Stastny, and Kelly Nelson -competed in last weekend's Maryland Invitational. 
Connelly and Stastny, expected to play No. 2 doubles this sea­son, won the consolation title in the "A" flight of the doubles draw. 
The tandem also competed in the singles "A" t1ight going a combined 4-3. Nelson reached the fmal in the "B" flight of sin­gles. . 
The rest of the Irish squad enters the weekend with a clean slate and high expectations, none higher than that of 
 Christina and Christian Thompson. 
The twin sisters are the No. 2 ranked doubles team in the country. They will put the rank­ing on the line in California this man standout Katie Potts will enter the "B" flight. Lauren Connelly and Kelcy Tefft will battle in the "C" flight, and Kelly· Nelson will round out the singles lineup in the "D" flight. 

Louderback will enter three teams in the doubles draw. 
Teams expected to challenge the Irish include the host Hoosiers, who will fiPid a com­petitive squad featuring three talented, international fresh­men. Kansas State, Kansas and Louisiana State will also enter strong squads this weekend. 
Louderback was excited for the tournament for several rea­sons. 
"It's a very good tournament," 
he said. "It will be

"They will The fall season

The rest of the team will enter the Hoosier Classic, a tourna­ment expected to provide good competition for the Irish. Eight teams will participate, entering players in five flights of singles and one flight of doubles. 
Brook Buck, ranked No. 54 nationally in singles, will lead the Irish in the "A" flight. Seniors Kiki Stastny and fresh-will allow the Irish 

to gain experience before the more intense indoor and spring seasons begin. Louderback also said it would give players who did not play much during the summer the chance to get back into competi­tion.

Thus, Bnthel has been ablo to compil1~ a group of talented players, and while the NAJA competition is less than that of the NCAA, the Pilots' 15-2 record speaks to their success this snason. 
Bnlles coach Julie Schroeder­Bink acknowledged the Pilots' tahmt. 
"Thny are a scholarship team and they anl good," she said. "Thnre's always been a good rivalry between Bethel and Saint Mary's. We expect strong compnlilion Saturday."

in eight days. After compiling a :~-2 record during that stretch, Schrocder-Biek gave the Bnlles 
a  much-deserved  day  off  
Wednesday.  
"We  had  a  few  nagging  

injuries that needed some rest," she said. "One day won't heal all of the injuries, but the time ofl' can only help us. It's nice to have a day to yourself." 
Saint Mary's took to the prac­tice court Thursday to tweak­their defense. Schroeder-Hick hesitated to emphasize any par­ticular aspect of her team's play during praetice for fear that another area may become weaker. She continued to drive her team to play a solid all­around game. 
Schroeder-Biek also stressed the importance of mental toughness and drive in light of thn lapses that occurred in games three and four Tuesday. 
"They know it should havn been finished in three," she said. "We just need to play the entire game from start to fin­ish." 

The Belles have hit the halfway point of their season. Their focus in the second half will be on picking apart MIAA opponents. 
The Belles have seen all but two MIAA teams already this season. 
Despite the inconsistent play Tuesday, Schroeder-Biek feels her team is focused and ready to make a second-half push. 
''I'm very happy that they still have very high goals for them­selves at this point in the sea­son," she said. 
"They know what they are capable of." 
The Belles have faced a diffi­cult schedule this year that included ranked teams Elmhurst and Wisconsin­Oshkosh in the first two match­

Belles flying high after huge win but won't take Thunder lightly 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
The Belles are riding high and firing on all cylinders: their opponent can barely field a com­plete squad. Most teams would walk onto the piteh with nothing but victory on their minds, but not the Belles. 
The Tri-State Thunder face oil' against the Belles at noon Saturday in an epic mismateh. The Thunder hav(~ often not been able to put the full 11 play­
. ers onto the field, while the Belles arn frnsh ofJ' of a 5-0 past­ing of Adrian. "One of the things I really stress with our women whon wn play teams of !Tri-State's! calibor is that we respoet them," Belles' coach Caryn Mackenzie said. "That way we try to play our game, as opposed to coming down to their level." The Belles do not fear losing, but they fear they will hurt themselves in the long run if they do not bring their highest caliber game. "Hopefully we ean notch a few early goals and do what we did against Adrian and_ get a fi.lw of our women off of the bnnch," Mackenzie said." 
Several Bnlles non-starters came onto tho field in tho sneond half against Adrian and contin­uod to dominatll their out­matdwd opponents. As a unit, the entire team has been a model of cohesive play in tho past filW weeks. 
"We're doing some good things right know," Macknnzin said. "I think we're starting to really enjoy being on the field witl1 each other. I like what I am seeing from us as a team at the moment." 
With Wednesday's crushing defeat of Adrian, thn Belles vaulted into third-plaeo in the MIM standings with a 4-2 eon­fimmee reeord and 5-4 ovnrall. Olivet shifted down into tlw fourth place spot previously inhabitnd by Saint Mary's. 
"It was nkn to sen us finally move," Mackenzie said. "Wn beat Olivnt head-to-lwad and thny eontinund to bn above us in thn standings. So that mntimwd to bn a thorn in our sides." 
But despite the annoyance to being held inferior to a team that the Belles had defeatnd, them is morn to their team than just numbers. 
"I think we know wlwn WI~ arn playing well and when things are working for us," Ma1:kenzie said. "We're a team that enjoys that momnnt and don't neces­sarily look for every little ... ehangn on the MIM wnbpage."

Notre Dame hits road for two Big East contests 
Road warriors, No. 10 Irish travel to New York, Milwaukee 
By TOM DORWART Sports Writer 
Starting today and through Sunday, the Irish (9-1) will be in four different states in as many days. 
Notre Dame (9-1, 1-0 Big East) travels to Syracuse, New York for a 7 p.m. match against the Orange (10-5, 2-0 Big East) Friday. Then, the Irish will head to Milwaukee to take on Marquette (7-6, 1-1 Big East) in a 2 p.m. Sunday match. 
On Thursday, the Irish left South Bend for Syracuse. And Saturday, they're f1ying back to Chicago, only to take a bus to Milwaukee for the Sunday match. 
While they might be jet-lagged stronger, more experienced squad, but, still, the Irish hope for similar results. 
"We don't know as much about them [as Syracuse] just because they're new to the conference," she said. 
"They were a team that, last year, I think, many thought they should've been granted an at­large bid because they had a high RPI and finished strong in their conference." 
Neither of Notre Dame's week­end opponents should be taken lightly, Brown said. 
"I think they're both pretty strong teams and for sure will be in the top half of the Big East this year." 
This weekend, the Irish will do much more traveling than they will do playing. They'll be on the road -in unfamiliar places. But, when they're on the court, they'll feel right at home.

and road-weary weary, and while their setting is constantly changing, one thing remains a constant for the Irish -volleyball. 
No matter where they go, they go to play the same game. 
"We leave Saturday morning [for Milwaukee]," coach Debbie Brown said. "We'll walk through some things, and we'll watch film to give our players a good idea of the offense [Marquette runs]." 
Syracuse -recently lost 3-1 in a hard-fought match against No. 3 -Stanford. 
Brown knows the Orange pose plenty of challenges for her team. 
"They've got a lot of seniors and players who've played quite a bit," she said. 
"I don't think they have any glaring weaknesses." 
Though the Irish have little time to prepare for both Syracuse and Marquette, they have experience in cramming for matches. Last Sunday, they swept Seton Hall at home. They followed that win with a Tuesday sweep of Loyola Chicago. Just like this weekend, Notre Dame had only a day to prepare for the Ramblers. 
Brown's clearly got a plan. 
"Right now. obviously, we're focusing more on Syracuse," she said. "And then we'll turn our attention, Saturday, to Marquette." 
The Irish knew little about Loyola Chicago but managed to make quick work of the under­dog. Marquette, BFown said, is a

Runners breezing tovvard Invite

Sports Writrr 
Aftnr two straight meets against smaller schools, the Notrn Dame men's and women's toams will faec several of the top-ranked squads in the nation in Friday's Notre Dame Invitational at Burke Memorial (;off Course. 
The mnnt, whic~h has been run continuously since 1955, will host 25 men's and 24 women's teams in the blue division raee for largm schools. Headlining tho men's field will be No. 1 Wiseonsin. No. 8 Arizona and the No. 6 Irish. On the women's side, top teams will include the No. 3 Irish, No. 5 Michigan and No. 18 Butler. 
Irish men's head coach Joe Piano said that along with hav­ing top c:ompetilion, the field is very deep. 
"One team who's phenomenal­ly undorrated is Alabama," Piano said of the Crimson Tide's No. 35 ranked men's team. "They have live Kenyans." 
Irish women's head coach Tim Connelly eredited the popularity of the meot among top pro­grams to its longtwity. 
"To qualify for the NCAAs, tlwre are automatic qualifying spots and at-large qualifying spots," he said. "The at large spots are basically based on who you beat. Our meet has beeome one of those meets where people know they ean see a lot of good competition." 
Piane agreed. 
"Outside of the so-called 'pre­national' meets, there are two meets in the country that are really respected," he said. "This is one of them." 
There will also he a gold divi­sion race for smaller schools. Twenty-three teams will com­pete on the women's side and 24 on the men's side. Canadian national champion Windsor and current Division Ill No. 1 Calvin will both run in the men's race, while traditional Division III powerhouse Edinboro will com­pete in the women's race. 
"The gold race exists because the field had just gotten too big. We can't accommodate that many people in one race," Connelly said. "It's primarily division one teams, but mostly those that aren't quite top twen­ty caliber. There are also some really good division II and III teams." 
Both Notre Dame teams will enter rosters of younger run­ners in the gold rac~e. 
"We're using the gold race for our team as an opportunity to get some younger kids some meet experience," Connelly said. 
After two meets of running 

freshmen and sophomores, both Irish squads will be at full strength this week in the blue raee. 
For the men, junior Kurt Benninger, senior Tim Moore, senior Sean O'Donell, freshman Patrick Smyth, sophomore Daniel Curran, senior Vinny Ambrico, sophomore Brett Adams and junior Todd Ptacek will compete. 
"We've got a nice mix of fresh­men, sophomores, juniors and seniors," Piane said of his line­up. 
Smyth and Adams earned their way into the lineup by virtue of strong performances at both the Valparaiso Invitational Sept. 9 and the National Catholic Championships Sept. 16. 
"If I decided !the ND Invitational lineup! before the season, there a couple of guys that are in the gold race that would have been in this race," Piane said. 
For the women, senior Molly Huddle, senior. Stephanie Madia, sophomore Sunni Olding, fresh­man Ramsey Kavan, junior Katie DeHusso, senior Elizabeth Webster, senior Jean Marinangeli and junior Amy Kohlmeyer will compete.

Belles eager for Windy City race 
Loyola-Chicago will host Saint Mary's as well as D-I teams

The Belles have four freshmen who have already demonstrated an ability to score points in league meets. 
They have two veteran runners who are running close to their personal records. 
And they have one of their favorite races this weekend. 
For Saint Mary's, the out­look is positive for the 50­team Sean Earl Lakefront Invitational on the eampus of Loyola-Chicago Satut·day.

Bauters isn't just looking for good performances from her veterans, though. 
She's hoping for eon tin und suecess from the freshmnn. 
Last week, four of Saint Mary's top seven f'inislwrs were first-year runners. 
"The freshman havn to eontinue to step up and show eonstant improve­ment," Bauters said. "I think they'll be right up there with our first fnw runners.

"It was probably one of my favorite races to go to," Bauters said. "It's just a high-energy race."

Saint Mary's will compete in the women's Gold race, one of several raees on the 
day. 
The Belles will run against teams from Divisions II, Ill and the NAIA, and teams from Division I will compete in a separate race. 
Bau tnrs said her team enjoys the atmosphere of having Division I sehools at the meet but doesn't think it influences thn way the Belles run. 
"It's fun to be there and have them all there, but it doesn't hnlp us or hurt us," she said of the top-tier schools.

MEN'S INTERHALL -GOLD LEAGUE 
'Battle for the Chapel' anticipated 
Halls share building, but not love, heading into Sunday's game 
By TOM DORWART, 
JIM BRADY and JAMES FEGAN 
Sports Writers 
Their dorms are connected. They share a chapel. And last interhall season, they almost fm­ished in a tie. 
Now, in a watershed matchup in the men's Gold league, one of them can put themselves in the thick of the title race, while the other will likely fall behind. 
Keenan, the reigning interhall champions, and Stanford, a solid team that hasn't made the play­offs in three years, clash Sunday at 1 p.m. at Riehle Field in a North Quad rivalry matchup. 
"This is pretty much do-or­die," Keenan senior captain and lineman Vince Lyzinski said. 
"You never know if 2-2 is going to get you in the playoffs, but at 3-1, we could control our own destiny," he said, referring to his team's 1-1 record. 
Last Sunday the Knights fell 13-8 to the Dillon Big Red, their first loss in two years. Keenan 

WOMEN'S INTERHALL-BLUE LEAGUE 

Wild Women to clash with Chaos 
Walsh, Cavanaugh replay last season's title game Sunday 
By JACK THORNTON and 
BEN VINCENT 
Sporrs Writers 
Undefeated Cavanaugh and Walsh meet Sunday at 2 p.m. on the West Quad Fields in a rematch of last year's women's interhall title game. They'll bring with them play­off hopes for this season as well as scars from the last. 
"Everybody who's returning knows how big it's going to be, and the freshmen have gotten more and more excited as the season has gone on," Walsh captain Mary Ellen Botta said. 
The Wild Women have plen­. ty of reason for excitement this year. 
With a 3-0 record, they join the Chaos (also 3-0) as the only remaining undefeated teams in the women's Blue league. 
Botta credits offensive inge­nuity and turnovers as the keys to Walsh's success so far. 
"We've got some creative offense that we've been using in our games this season and a tough defense," Botta said. "We've had at least two inter­ceptions each game -we really rely on our defense." 
On top of its stifling defense, Cavanaugh boasts an offense that comes up big in clutch situations. 
"The defense has been a big factor in our winning because they haven't allowed one point yet and the offense can make plays when they need to," Chaos receiver Elisa Suarez said. "Whenever we need to step up we do." 
For both teams, it will likely be the first time they are challenged all season. 
The Cavanaugh defense has yet to allow a point this sea­son, while the Wild Women have outscored their oppo­nents 53-7.

Notre Dame will travel to the far corners of the Big East this weekend for two games as the Irish enter the heart of their conference schedule. 
No. 18 Marquette (9-1-1), in its first year in the Big East, will host Notre Dame (9-1-0) Friday in Milwaukee in a bat­tle of two exceptional defen­sive teams. Fellow conference newcomer South Florida (5-2­

The Irish have allowed just one goal in their last five matches and have posted six shutouts in 10 games this sea­son. Marquette has had just as much defensive success, also holding six opponents score-

feels it carinot afford to lose again and tumble in the stand­ings. 
The Griffins' senior captain and cornerback Phil McNicholas is quite aware of his opponent's precarious situation. 
"If there's a game that we real­ly want to win this year, it's defi­nitely this one," he said. "We haven't made the playoffs in three years, so being 2-0, having beaten two of the toughest teams in the league in Dillon and Keenan would definitely put us in a really good position to maybe lead our division going into the playoffs." 
The Griffins had a bye last Sunday but beat Dillon 6-2 in the season opener.

By KEVIN BRENNAN Sports Writer 
When you lose just one game, it can be hard to for­get. Notre Dame certainly hasn't forgotten. 
In 2004, the Irish came up short in only one confer­ence match en route to the Big East regular season title. Notre Dame (6-3, 2-2 Big East) can exact some revenge Saturday when it hosts West Virginia at 7

"We are very aware that they beat us last year." Notre Dame head coach Bobby Clark said. "They were the only team that beat us in the Big East, so we'd love to get that sorted out."

Why should I change to a Strong Password? 
(1) 
Weak passwords put sensitive and personal information at risk that can be used by identity thieves (you don't want strangers guessing your password and pretending to be you) ; 

(2) 
If you do not change to a Strong Password, your existing password will expire, disrupting your access to Notre Dame networked applications, including email and shared storage. 


Will all existing passwords expire at the same time? 
No. Passwords that have not been changed (to 
Strong Passwords) since July 5, 2005 will be 
randomly tagged for expiration sometime between 
now and the spring of 2006. 
How will I know that my password is set to expire? 
You will receive an email from the OIT, and you will 
have 30 days from the day of receipt to change to a 
Strong Password. Once you change your password 
to a Strong Password, you won't have to change it 
again for another 180 days. 

When it comes to Strong Passwords, will the 
University make exceptions for some campus 
computer users? 

No exceptions will be granted.

Born to run 
Walker wants more than an individual record as his four 100-yard games contribute to 3-1 start 
the Irish to an average of 179 yards per game on thn ground and seven total touchdowns ­two by Walker. All of it comes from Weis' play card. 
"IWeis' playcallingJ has deli­nitely boostnd our confidence," Walker said. "When we're out there the defense doesn't really know what they're going to get from us. We l'eel that whatever play we're running ... it's going to work. We kind of feel like we can't be touched while we're out there." 
Harris, Walker and the Irish have been careful not to criticize the previous coaching staff for struggles in 2004, but thny also acknowledge the new leadership is a big reason for their success. 
"I don't think there's a better play-caller, I don't think there's a better head coach out there right now," Harris said. "You know that any given play coming in from the sideline could be the play for a touchdown. Whether that's in the middle or the drive, early in tho drive or deep into tho drive. ]Wois] has our full eonlidonce. lie's won l'our Super Bowls. What elsn do you want to say?" 
Clearing the way 
With only six regular contr·ibu­tors, the o/l(msive line has boon forced to lake on an aggressive, no-excuses attitude under the new coaehing staff. Tho recent injury ol' center Bob Morton against Washington has thinned the group of regular contribu­tors to l'ive, hampering their numbers but not their attitude. 
"We don't get all the glory, )we're spurred on by] that desire to kind of spring the offense," Irish guard Dan Stevenson said. "It all starts up front. I think coach Weis has instilled [this mindsetl in us. You can't let yourself feel sorry for yourself because you're tired or you're banged up." 
While Morton's injury will hin­der the thin unit, Latina contin­ues to stress the need to strive for perfection in order to contin­ue the powerful rushing attack. 
"I don't know if you ever play a perfect game in the game of football, but you sure try to,' Latina said. "We're trying to cor­rect any little mistake because you never know when that one little fundamental mistake is going to cost you the game. 
"Every game is a new entity, a separate deal. Every defense that you face ... gives you differ­ent problems so you have to get through the week and nx and learn how to attack that defense." 
Often underappreeiated by fans and the media, the Irish oll'ensive line receives plenty of respect from the one group that has the most to gain from it ­Walker and the Irish running hacks. 
"I really appreciate the things they're doing out there for me," Walker said. "It's not just me. They're making big holes for me to run through, and I'm a small­er guy, so I can squeeze through the holes." 
But the line isn't the only group making room for Walker to run in 200!i. Rashlm Powers­Neal and true freshman fullback Asaph Schwapp have provided a productive combination at the fullback position. 
"!Powers-Neal and Schwappl are incredible," Walker said. "They just clear the lane for me They're just two big, fast guys ­like trains running through tho hole." 

Continuing the success 
Notre Dame is impressed with its success rushing the ball this season. But the key to keeping up the potent Irish running game, according to the players and coaches, is to avoid the temptation to be satisfied. 
"It does feel good as an ollense to have the success that we've had," Walker said. "But at the same time there's pressure because we've got to keep these numbers up." 
And the key to continuing the high numbers, Stevenson said, is adding on what the team has been doing correctly. 
"We're all on the same pagn," Stevenson said. "I think the big thing is just confidence. Its something we just need to keep building on." 

If the past is any indication, Notre Dame will struggle at times tomorrow. Purdue has beaten Notre Dame two years in a row. The last timn the lrisb visited West Lafayette, in 200:{, they ran 25 times for 49 yards in a 23-10 loss. The way to win this year's game, the players say, is to run right at the Boilermakers, wearing their defense down and giving Walker a chance to break loose. 
"You have to go into every play hoping that that play makes a difference," Harris said. "But if it doesn't you just have to go to the next play." 
Beeause with a diiTerence­maker like Walker in the back­field, that next play might be a touchdown.

Walker credits Weis with knowing what plays to call to thin the defense and officiently pick it apart.

NOTRE DAME 
DEFENSIVE LINE 
Trevor Laws and Victor Abiamiri, above, had high expectations going into 2005. However, they have been quiet this year and will need to step up against a solid Purdue rushing attack. 
Derek Landri has eight tackles, three for a loss, from his nose tackle spot. 
The line was able to hold Washington to only 41 yards last week and will need a similar performance . 
Taking the rushing game away from the Boilermakers could eliminate the crowd from the game and force new quarterback Kirsch to throw. 
PURDUE 
RUSHING OFFENSE 
The best defense for the Boilermakers will be a rushing offense that controls the clock. 
Keeping the ball on the ground will excite the expected sellout crowd and keep Brady Quinn and Jeff Samardzija from outscoring the tough Boilermakers. 
Jerod Void, above, and Kory Sheets will split time at running back and keep each other fresh, giving Purdue a chance to wear down the Irish line. 
Kirsch has good speed and will cause problems if the Irish let him get outside the pocket.
