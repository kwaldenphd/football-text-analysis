Oldie's Night 
'.25 DRAFTS 

by Jim Bowler Staff Reporter 

Mr. Edmund Price, director of the Notre Dame food services, and three dining hall managers met with several students yesterday afternoon to outline the reasons behind their recent decision to discontinue trash pickups by farm­er George Brown. Brown, a local pig farmer, had been hauling away dining hall garbage to use as feed for his livestock. 
According to Price, "As director of food services, I have the respon­sibility for the safety and sanitation of each food sevice operation under my direction. I am also responsible for the efficient and economical operation of each facility." In the Brown case. Price claimed, "We weren't handling garbage in the proper way. It was very awkward 
(l'ontinued from page 1) Conrad said, "It hasn't changed much since John Dillinger was there in '27. In addition to physical changes, a reassessment of'the purpose of our prisons is necessary, Conrad conti­nued. "You need to make a determination of whether or not you're going to do any rehabilitati­
on: whether you're going to warehouse people, or whether you­'re going to decide that there are 
some people whoaren 't rehabilitat­able, but that there are some that are. Then you've got to provide the services." he stated. 
Thirdly. changes should be made in personnel and morale, Conrad said. People are moved around arbitrarily and there is reclassification "without rhyme or reason to it." 
Many of the prisons are underst­affed as well. Conrad cited the fact that at Pendleton there are not enough employees to man all the 
· guard posts. He added that he was "Surprised, given the circumstan­ces. we have not had a serious problem." Lastly. he criticized the lack of educators employed in the prison system. "The people there now are not educators. They're spendi­ng a little time educating and most of their time providing security." 
Revise the tax structure 

Asked how he would finance prison reform and other measues he advocates, Conrad replied that 
FAST 
TYPEWRITER IR 

he would move first of all to change the tax structure. 
''Indiana has one of the most inequitable tax structures in the United States." he said. Conrad favors graduated, progressive income tax. 
He believes property taxes are based on an "out-dated principal­e" and stated that there will never be tax relief as long as property tax is fused to education. 
There is nothing "fair and equal" about education paid for by property taxes. Conrad continued. Children in wealthy neighborhoods or in areas where industries pay huge amounts of taxes, receive a higher quality education than chil­dren in poorer areas.

Conrad also predicted that asse­ssed valuation will swing up when the governor's manual for reasses­sment comes out. He said that Gov. Bowen will not publish the manual until after the election though because of it's consequenc­es. 
To bring more jobs to IndiatJa. Conrad would also get rid of the business inventory tax. This, he explained. is an arbitrary tax levied on business, based on "whatever their inventory happens to be on a given date." 
''I'm against any arbitrary taxe­s," he said. "When it's done without rhyme or reason, then that spreads through the rest of the government."

Mr. Larry Aronson, manager of the North Dining hall, added, "In our dining hall, we don't even have a place to store the garbage anymore." It used to be stored in a room recently taken over by the bakery department. 
Another factor in the decision ws the overall efficency of removal. ''Waste must be minimized.'' Price insisted. "Every precaution is to be taken to suppress the misuse of food by judicious planning and followup." 
"The present procedure is to dispose of garbage through the garbage disoosal units." Price noted, "As soon as it's cre­

"Debates" 

Dear Editor: 
The first "debate" left me frustrated and angry. Is there no man of vision to energize us in the midst of our vast domestic prob­lems? I felt once again that I was being manipulated by the cosmetic experts who were hired to program and preen their customers for my entertainment and my vote. But it wasn't even good theatre. 
The candidates spoke of unem­ployment and inflation with pre­cious little human feeling and with less wisdom as they traded figures on vetoes. But what of the other crucial domestic issues: Did they have nothing to say about our terrible need for adequate housing kgislation? Why be silent at this time in the face or our long over-due comprehensive health care plan; for the need to improve our failing educational system; the national concern about abortion; the tragedy of our crime infested streets; the desegration of our schools; the continuous erosion of our civil liberties; and the failure of our country to improve our mass transportation system. To name but a few of the national domestic problems. 
Not everything, obviously, can be covered in a 90 minute time period which is rigidly structured. But the country is desperate for leadership and greatness in those called to lead. The debate unfortu­nately, gave us a mediocrity which was frightening.

Dear Editor: 
Presidential campaigns used to be about such tedious matters as unemployment, tariffs, taxes, na­tional defense, and foreign policy. It is a sign of progress that the 1976 campaign is focused on more relevant issues. Both major candi­dates, though male, have discu!lsed abortions exhaustively--have grap­pled manfully with abortion, one might say. President ,Ford has informed us that, unlike his wife, he does not think it likely that Susan Ford would undertake an affair with anyone but that if she did he would remonstrate with her about it. Governor Carter has acknowledged that he has commit­ted a highly ethereal form of adultery many times but is sure God has forgiven him. 
Realization that matters of this sort are now the central issues in the campaign has led me to re-assess my position. Though long the embattled Presidential candidate of the Crusted Reaction ary Alliance I had decided against running this year because it ap­peared that my views on old fashioned campaign issues were shated by so few voters that victory was impossible. Since it is now clear that the true issues, those which genuinely excite the voter/>. are primarily biological, psycholo­gical, and moral, I will now reactivate my candidacy. After all, I know as much about biology as Messrs. Ford and Carter. Between now and election day I expect to issue several position papers on moral behavior, public and private, normal and abnormal. 
All concerned citizens are invited to support my campaign. Contribu­tions from any source will be accepted gratefully. These may be in checks or cash, in large amounts or small, in U.S. or foreign cur­rency, from private individuals or special interests. No questions will be asked, no receipts given, no records kept, and nothing will be leaked to the newspapers. If no member of my staff is available just shove the money under the door of 348 O'Shaughnessy. 
Yours for a finer America,

Philosophy conference deemed big success 
by Greg Besio Staff Reporter 

Professor Cornelius Delaney, Philosphy Department chairman jeemed the Philosophy of Religion :::onference, held this weekend, a oig success. The conference, .vhich took place in the Center for :::ontinuing Education, attracted 'eading philosophers and theolo­~ians from across the nation to ;peak on the topic "Religious :Jelief and Rationality.". 
One of the highlights of the conference included a presentation

UNITED STATES READING LAB OFFERS SPEED READING COURSE AT NOTRE DAME 
United States Reading Lab will offer a 4 week course in speed reading to a limited number of qualified people at Notre Dame. 
This recently developed method of instruction is the most innovative and ef. 
fective program available in the  United  
States.  
Not  only  does  this  famous  course  

reduce your time in the classroom to just one class per week for 4 short weeks but it also includes an advanced speed reading course on cassette tape so that you can continue to improve for the rest of your life. In just 4 weeks the average student should be reading 4-5 times faster. In a few months some students are reading 20-30 times faster attaining speeds that approach 601)0 words per minute. In rare instances speeds of up to 13,000 wpm have been documented. 
Our average graduate should read 7-10 times faster upon completion of the course with marked improvement in comprehension and concentration. 
For those who would like additional information, a series of free, one hour, orientation lectures have been schedules. 
At these free lectures the course will be explained in complete detail, including classroom procedures, instruction meth­ods, class schedule and a special 1 time only introductory tuition that is less than one-half the cost of similar courses. You must attend any of the free meetings for information about Notre Dame classes. 
These orientations are open to the public, above age 14 (persons under 18 shou!d be accompanied by a parent if possible). 
If you have always wanted to be a speed reader but found the cost prohibi­tive or the course too time consuming ... now you can! Just by attending 1 evening per week for 4 short weeks you can read 7 to 10 times faster, concentrate better and r..omprehend more . 
If you are a student who would like to make A's instead of B's or C's or if you are a business person who wants to stay abreast of today's everchanging acceler­ating wor~d then this course is an absolute necessity. 
These free special one-hour lectures will be held at the following times and places.

Notre Dame harriers drop second meet of season 
by Gregory Solman I Sports Writer 

Health, or rather, lack of it, has been the key to Irish Cross-Country woes this season, and last Satur­day's loss to Michigan State couldn't have been too conducive to the health of Coach.Joe Piane, who witnessed his team's second defeat in as many meets. The score was a disheartening 35-20. 
All-American Herb-Lindsay, however, was in perfect health yesterday, as he broke the course record he set in 1974. Lindsay, in addition to crossing the tape first. ran the five-mile course in 24:06 breaking his own course record of 
24:33.5. That explains why the Spartan runner is an All-American. 
Lindsay was followed in the next four spots by his teammates jeff Pullen, Paul Morrison and Stan Mavis. That explains the score. 
Through the gloom of defeat, light did break through, however. Jim Reinhart, in placing fifth, again ran a strong race, and-Dennis VanderKraats and Dan Horgan followed him to maintain the team leadership. 
The truly bright lights of the race were freshmen Fred Stepan and Kevin Kenny, who both turned in their second straight outstanding performances. 
Kenny, who polled eighth in the race, commented that he was ''excited about running for Notre Dame.'' 
"We're a surprisingly close group. The entire team stays together," commented Kenny. 
Kenny lauded praise for the leadership of VanderKraats, Hor­gan and Reinhart. Stepan added Coach Piane to the list of people that wer'e helping them in adjus­ting

There are, however, three main factors helping Carter. The Demo­cratic Party is united at the national 
, level for the first time in twelve years: there is massive labor-union Rolitical drives and there is support from urban blacks and white evan­gelical Protestants in rural and small-town areas. 
Ford increases percentage 

The Times/CBS poll revealed that 55 percent agreed with the statement. "At least I know what kind of President Gerald Ford will be. I'm not so sure about Jimmy Carter." Thirty-two percent dis­agreed. Now after the debates, the margin had widened in Ford's favor 66 to 27 percent. 
Despite this sentiment, the re­spondents in the survey thought Jimmy Carter "really cares about people like me" by a 50 to 25 percent margin. They believed that Carter was more sincere, 39 to 34 percent; Carter made them more comfortable, 42 to 37 percent; they agree with Carter on more issues, 44 to 40 percent and Carter seems more intelligent, 33 to 32 percent. 
Ford had the. widest margin in this survey of feelings. By a margin of 56 to 21 percent, the people surveyed indicated Ford had a more detailed knowledge about how government works. Also the poll revealed that Ford is more of a leader by a 39 to 36 percent margin. 
"Playboy" Interview 

The significance of Carter's in­terview with Playboy magazine in which he expressed his views on adultery "was not clear." Only three percent changed their views in the Times/CBS poll. However, 18 percent of the voters said they were less likely to vote for Carter in a poll conducted by Newsweek and the Gallup Poll Organization. 
Michael ford, the eldest son of the President, felt Carter's views on adultery were an "honest expression'' in a story by the Associated Press. Ford, who will graduate from Gordon-Cro­well Theological Seminary next
