Exec Cab, Senators make progress on resolution 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES 
News Editor 
Members of the Executive Cabinet and Student Senate made progress toward reach­ing a compromise regarding a proposal to create a collabo­rative body composed of all seven branches of student government that would con­solidate and redirect power within the student govern­
ment infrastructure. 
Sunday, the Student Senate voted 14-9 in favor of the res­olution, introduced by Student body president Pat Hallahan, but the resolution failed because two-thirds were needed for passage. Hallahan invited senators to Monday's Executive Cabinet meeting with the hope that Executive Cabinet could explain its desire to create this body and address Senate concerns. 
The original proposal called for a Council of Representatives to be empow­ered with deliberating issues related to the Collaboration Fund and Constitution of the Student Union -powers cur­rently held by the Student Senate. The Council. which intends to be an expanded form of the current Executive Cabinet. would consist" of the vice president, four class presidents, four senators, the Hall President's Council chair, the Student Union Board manager, the Club Coordination Council presi­dent, the Student Union Treasurer, the Judicial Council President, the off­campus president and the chief of staff for the Office of the Student Body Presj.dent. 
Hallahan will present a report to the University's Board of Trustees Thursday 


Spade show cost about $tOOK 
By TERESA FRALISH 
Assistant News Editor 
Future programming for Student Union Board events will not significantly be affected by low turnout at the Oct. 4 David Spade event, said Cha~lie Ebersol Student Union Board president. 
Ebersol said the budget for the performance allowed a cushion for overall loss, and that the final cost was within the range speci­fied in SUB's yearly budget ­even though the final budget for 
the  Spade  show  was  not  
approved  by  the  Financial  
Management Board.  

The total cost for the event was approximately $100,000, Ebersol said. That figure accounted for a variety of fees, including the rental cost for the Joyce Center, which totaled about $15-20,000. The remaining expenditures included the speaker's fee for Spade, production costs, techni­cal rider and miscellaneous costs. 
Ebersol said SUB spent rough­ly $15,000 to $20,000 of its $234,000 annual budget to cover the money lost by the concert. SUB intended for the Spade con­cert to be one of the more costly events for the year and budgeted appropriately. 
"We knew the event would be expensive. This only affects one section [of SUB's budget]," Ebersol said. 
Total ticket sales for the Spade show were no more than 1.400, a figure well below what SUB had planned for, Ebersol said. And some people who bought tickets didn't even attend the show, he added. 
Ebersol said couldn't say for sure where the rest of the money to pay for the Spade show, which could be as much as $50,000, would come from because of the uncertainty regarding SUB's final budget for the year. What department that money will be drawn from won't be clear until the fiscal year ends in June, he added. However, the money SUB spent to cover the cost of the event came from a fund the organization uses to defray pro­gramming costs.

Vatican may prohibit female altar service 

By AMANDA MICHAELS 
News Writer 
Only nine years after the Vatican gave women permission to serve beside their male coun­terparts at the altar, a new pro­posal threatens to force them back into the crowd. 
.On Sept. 23, the Italian Catholic monthly, "Jesus," released advanced text of an article featur­ing excerpts from a draft docu­ment, or directive, written by the Vatican congregations for Divine Worship and the Sacraments and for the Doctrine of the Faith. Distributed on June 5, the docu­ment was an expansion on the papal encyclical published in April that cut down on abuses during Mass, specifically during Communion. 
According to reports, in addition to banning applause and dancing at Mass -both of which often occur at papal services -the doc­ument specified that the use of female altar servers should be avoided "unless there is a just pastoral cause," and that" "priests should never feel obliged to seek girls for this function." 
However, both the Catholic News Service, the media exten­sion of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), and the National Catholic Reporter (NCR) stated that the directive was almost immediately sent back for revi­sions. 
"On June 29, the cardinals in charge of the two offices working on the document had a ·meeting and rejected it," said John Allen, Rome correspondent for the NCR. 
"The final version is expected by Christmas, and at least for now it says nothing on altar girls." 
Though the news of the propos­al's rejection is cause for much relief among female acolytes, the mere suggestion of restricting their use has stirred up controver­sy all over the United States and Western Europe, where the prac­tice has become commonplace. 
Since 1994, the USCCB has held that each individual bishop has the power to decide whether or not females within their diocese should be altar servers -a ver­dict based on the interpretation of 1983 Canon Law 230.2, said Sheila Garcia, USCCB Secretariat for Family, Laity, Women and Youth. To this date, very few dio­ceses across the country have pre­

Confession 

I'm about to make a confession that could be considered scandalous, shock­ing or even blasphemous -at least on this campus. It's not something I've told many people, though that is obviously 
about t~ change, Amanda Michaels and believe me, my views have changed since Production then. With that Editor said, here it goes. I wasn't thrilled to be coming to Notre Dame. That's right. I got my letter on the day my family went out to get our Christmas tree last year, and in a moment that was made even more anti-climactic by the visible 'congratu­lations!' in the address window, I was accepted. I smiled, my mom cried, we bought a tree. I fulfilled the expecta­tions set for me by my friends, family and teachers, and was off to one of the fmest academic institutions in the country. I gave wary smiles to Notre Dame fanatics and half-heartedly afftrmed how excited I was, and how much I loved it. About 9,000 seniors across the country would kill to be in my position as a future Domer, but that didn't seem to matter. I still wasn't ecstatic. For a while, I blamed it on the fact that Notre Dame had never been my ultimate college goal. I was no legacy. I never wore a Notre Dame cheer leading outfit as a toddler and didn't write essays in elementary school about why Rudy wa.S my hero. I worked and stud­ied and joined every activity under the sun in high school because I was obses­sive and wanted to be the best, not because I thought they would improve my chances of getting in here. It's not until now, after two months at the most perfect university I could have chosen for myself. that I realize that it was that unfocused, break-neck pace that was the problem. In high school, my goals had been so far up in the heights of Olympus that I never saw them. On the 7:30a.m. to 9 
p.m. days I spent running from school to the newspaper to the theatre to the marching band, I was like a mouse in a maze, frantically trying to get to my reward but always seeming to turn the wrong way. 
So when graduation rolled by, after the glow from my five minutes of fame faded, I was left with nothing but a piece of pape·r and three months to think about what it meant. Was this really the fruit of my labor? A universi­ty shrouded in tradition, but still more tangible than any of my previous dreams had been -was it right for me? Was I reaching down? Reaching up? 
Was it all worth it? 

I see now that it was. I'm no big believer in destiny or kismet or Fate or what have you, but I can safely say that every hour spent suffering through Chemical Biology or sleeping on a cramped bus after a band competition helped bring me here today. I am so content and happy here, in part because I have chosen a different approach to college than I did to high school, but also because I know that I belong here, no matter what my doubts once were. 
So now, with clear conscience, I can go back home for fall break and reply honestly to anyone who asks, "Yes, I love it at Notre Dame, and no, I would­n't change my decision for anything."

OFFBEAT 
Agency Is selling land on 
the moon 
MELBOURNE, Australia -Now here's a gift that's really out of this world. A new real estate agency, Lunar Realty, based in the southern Australian city of Melbourne, opens its doors Tuesday selling one-acre blocks on the moon for 59 Australian dollars (US $40) and 10-acre "lifestyle" blocks for A$298 (US $202). 
Businessman Paul Jackson, 33, announced ·Monday he had bought the Australian rights to sell the land from Nevada-based entrepreneur Dennis Hope. 
Hope has been cashing in since 1980 on what he said was an apparent loophole in the 1967 United Nations Outer Space Treaty that barred nations from laying claim to the moon but said nothing about individuals. 
Hope registered a claim for the moon and planets with the United States, the Soviet government and the United Nations and, oper­ating as Lunar Embassy, has been selling plots of extraterrestrial real estate ever since.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Officers update list serve policy 
By MEGAN O'NEIL 
News Writer 
Officers approved an updated version of the Student Government Association's offi­cial policy on mass emailing at Monday's Board of Governance meeting. The amendments carne amid widespread abuse of campus list serves at Saint Mary's. 
The revised edition restricts the use of class and residence hall list serves to the five main student boards at the College. Individual students are instead encouraged to utilize alternative sources of campus-wide com­munication. 
BOG had received several complaints from students about mass emailing. Individuals had reportedly been using the two main list serves on campus for personal reasons such as travel arrangements over f!lll break. The Student Handbook, explained Student Body President Elizabeth Jablonski­Diehl. does not include any guidelines for mass emailing. It was necessary, therefore, for BOG to reinforce its stance on the issue. 
"We need a policy that we can stand behind," Jablonski-Diehl said. "At least for the time being, we arc responsible for enforcing the policy." 
One such alternative outlet for communication to which stu-

SOCIAL CONCERNS 

dents are directed by the policy is the Saint Mary's Virtual Village. Virtual Village can be accessed from any computer on campus. It provides a forum in which the student body can do everything from exchange foot­ball tickets to sell textbooks. Students can also hang hard copies of notices and requests at designated locations on campus. 
In one of the most significant changes to the existing policy, Board members voted to add a disclaimer to its reference to Virtual Village and bulletin boards. It states that, while the College provides sites for com­munication between students, the students themselves are responsible for all postings and subsequent transactions. SGA cannot insure any exchange between individuals. 
While board members easily approved the revision of the policy, debate ensued on the proper way to distribute and implement it. Several board members favored giving stu­dents a grace period in which to learn about the rules. 
"We need some sort of infor­mal warning," said Elections Commissioner Nicole Haeberle. "We are dealing largely with first year students who simply don't know." 
Others argued that the reper­cussions for violating the policy, which will include an incident report drafted by the judiciary board. should be implemented immediately. 
After a lengthy discussion, officers decided to provide a hard copy of the updated policy to each student, as well as con­tacted violators by email through the conclusion of this week. Following fall break, vio­lators will be cited and referred to the judiciary board. 
In other BOG news:

BOG voted unanimously to recognize Flipside as a Saint Mary's club. Flipside had previ­ously retained the status of an official club, but was placed on probation and then disbanded last year after failing to follow proper SGA procedure. As a Saint Mary's club, Flipside will receive an annual allowance under the BOG budget.

Leaves of absence for study abroad limited 
By AMANDA MICHAELS 
News Writer 
Students dissatisfied with Notre Dame's study abroad offerings who are pursuing alternatives may find them­selves campus-bound if they are not careful. 
In a decision passed down by the Office of the Provost, the number of leaves of absence that the College of Arts and Letters grants to those going outside the University to study abroad has been reduced from 40 to 16. 
Ava Preacher, assistant dean for undergraduate studies in the College of Arts and Letters, cited budgetary concerns as a cause for the reduction. 
"A student who applies for one of these alternative pro­grams does not pay Notre Dame tuition," Preacher said. "So we'd like to have fewer students going abroad through other schools, unless they have an overriding academic need to do so. The University has always had the ability to say that a study abroad program was not more appropriate than its own." 
Those traveling to countries in Africa or East Asia, where Notre Dame's International Studies programs fall short, will be given priority for leave grants. Preacher also added that, in the past, all 40 leaves of absence were not used, so their further limitation was practical. 
Though the decision is said to affect each college, Douglass Hemphill, assistant professional specialist in the Office of the Dean of the Mendoza College of Business, said he was not aware of any such reduction. 
"To the best of my knowledge, we have not been given any kind of quota or limit or num­ber," said Hemphill. "The focus is on filling Notre Dame's [study abroad] programs." 
Sister Kathleen Cannon, asso­ciate dean of the College of Science, said that their limit is seven leaves of absence and has been so for years. 
"With our programs, we know what the numbers [of partici­pants] are and can plan accord­ingly. If we had no way of limit­ing those going outside of Notre Dame for study abroad, we would have no handle on what was [happening] on campus," said Cannon. 
Because of the rarity of alter­native study abroad partici­pants within the School of Architecture and the College of Engineering, the limit for each school has not been tested. 
For those who are affected by the cutbacks, Preacher suggest­ed investigating summer cours­es or some of the undersub­scribed programs within Notre Dame.

vented women from serving. 
Though the language of the draft document was only mar­ginally more restrictive than current standards, many fear its appearance signals a possible shift toward conservatism with­in the Vatican. 
"There are apparently still many chauvinists in the Vatican who think that males are inher­ently superior to females in the eyes of God," said Father Richard McBrien, professor of theology and Crowley-O'Brien Chairman of Theology at Notre Dame. "[But the reversal of Vatican II] has already been established in many other ways over the past 25 years. This lat­est matter is merely a speck on the window pane in comparison with many other examples of reversals." 
Traditionalists have often argued that allowing women to be altar servers brings them one step too close to priesthood, and that the position should be used only to encourage boys to con­sider a vocation in the Church -a tradition that the directive reportedly aimed at reviving. However, this presented a prob­lem for the Vatican because, as Bend two months before the 2002 congressional election and generated $650,000 for Chocola and the Indiana Republican Party, propelling Chocola to victory.

Garcia pointed out, Pope John Paul II has presided over Masses where women were servers. 
Kelly Hager, coordinator of servers at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart and an altar serv­er herself said, "I do not serve because I want to be a priest. I serve because it's a personal choice to participate in liturgy in a way that I feel called to partic­ipate. I hardly think that any woman gets involved with the sole intent to try to become a priest." 
"Women will eventually be ordained as deaconesses, and then as priests," McBrien said, countering the directive's goals. "But those changes won't come about simply because girls are allowed to serve at the altar. There are far more powerful forces at work in the Church and in society at large that will bring about these changes sometime in the new ~entury." 
Though concern on campus over the implications of this directive is high, especially among females, Father Peter Rocca, rector of the Basilica, said that, in terms of pastoral application, the proposal would not have changed practices at the Basilica, and that female altar servers will always be needed.

Senators raised concern that this would detract from the Senate's duties and said that the Student Senate typi­cally approves all resolutions from other student govern­ment bodies.

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -Dozens of Israeli tanks entered the Rafah refugee camp on the Gaza-Egypt border before dawn Tuesday, the second large-scale invasion there this week, witnesses said. 
Israeli military sources confirmed that an operation was underway. They said it was a continuation of a three-day mission that began Friday, aimed at clearing away tunnels used by Palestinians to smuggle weapons from Egypt. 
Witnesses said two columns of armored vehi­cles entered the camp from two directions, heading for a different section of the camp. There were no immediate reports of casualties. 
In the first operation, eight Palestinians, including two children, were killed by Israeli gunliro in fierce exchanges. Palestinians said about 100 buildings were destroyed, leaving hundreds of families homeless. 
The Israeli military said that about 30 build­ings were knocked down, and three tunnels were found and blown up. However, the mili­tary said, about 10 tunnels were still in opera­tion.

Muslim students' scarves spark debate 

Associated Press 
PARIS -A century ago, France pulled down the crucifixes hanging in its classrooms in a tri­umphant climax to its fight to separate the state from the powerful Roman Catholic Church. 
Today, battle lines are being drawn over another religious emblem, the Islamic head scarf, which some French see as a threat to their nation's core values and unity. 
A bitter debate over whether the head-covering can be worn in public schools, or by civil ser­vants, has festered for nearly 15 years and deep­ened as France's Muslim sons and daughters come of age.

Navy to limit peacetime sonar use 
A.ssociated Press 
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -The Navy has agreed to limit its peacetime use of a new sonar system designed to detect enemy submarines, but which may also harm marine mammals and fish, an environmentalist group said. 
The Natural Resources Defense Council, which sued the military on the issue, and the Navy reached a set­tlement last week in which the Navy agreed to use the new system only in specific areas along the eastern seaboard of Asia, according to docu­ments provided by the environmental group. 
The agreement must be approved by a federal magistrate to become permanent, but if implemented the deal would greatly restrict the Navy's original plan for the sonar system, which once was slated to be tested in most of the world's oceans. 
The Navy has not received final word of the agreement, but would comply, said Lt. Cmdr. Cappy Surette. 
"Whatever the final decision is, the Navy will uphold the law," Surette said from the Pentagon. 
Environmentalists say sonar sys­tems endanger marine mammals and fish, especially whales. They point to a different system the Navy used in 2000, when at least 16 whales and two dolphins beached themselves on islands in the Bahamas. Eight whales died and scientists found hemorrhag­ing around their brains and ear bones, which could have been caused by exposure to loud noise. 
"Oceans are an acoustic environ­ment, and the species that live there have an acute acoustic sense," Frederick O'Regan, president-of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said in a conference call Monday. "If we interfere with these critical behaviors, we may be affect­ing not just individual animals, but entire populations." 
Last year the Natural Hesources Defense Council and other environ­mental groups sued the Navy over the new system, seeking to restrict its use. 
U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth Laporte later issued a preliminary injunction restricting usc of the system, and in a separate ruling ordered the environ­mentalists and the Navy to negotiate a final settlement. 
The new deal. which is the result of those negotiations, largely mirrors the restrictions imposed by Laporte's injunction. 
Since the injunction, the Navy has used the sonar system in restricted areas without harm to marine life, Surette said. It is designed to detect enemy diesel submarines at great dis­tances.

Kucinich announces White House bid 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -Democrat Dennis Kucinich, the liberal four-term congressman who has been steadfast in his opposition to the Iraq war, formally kicked off his presi­dential bid Monday with a harsh critique of U.S. foreign policy. 
"America cannot put its foot on the accelerator of war and advocate peace," the Ohio lawmaker, who favors a with­drawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, told several hundred cheering supporters in the chambers of the Cleveland City Council. 
His candidacy a long shot at best -Kucinich trails many of his rivals in fund raising and public opinion polls ­the White House hopeful used the announcement speech to . stress his anti-war stance, his opposition to international trade pacts and his support for a single-payer, universal health care plan. 
"Freedom bids us to free ourselves from the shackles of violence," he said. "When peace becomes innermost, it then becomes outermost in our communities and our nation." 
Kucinich said that if elected president, he would look for nonviolent ways to solve the world's problems. including the Israeli-Palestinian ten­sions in the Middle East. The self-described urban populist also said he would order a study of reparations for blacks whose ancestors were slaves. 

The Democratic candidate called for cutting the Pentagon budget by about 15 percent, arguing that it would free up billions of dollars without undermining national security. "It would instead enhance the economic securi­ty of our nation," he said. 
Kucinich, who has been campaigning for months, made the announcement in his native Cleveland, the first stop of a multistate tour that will include Michigan, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Iowa. 
The kickoff speech at City Hall served as a reminder of Kucinich's political triumphs and bitter disappointments. Elected in 1977, the 31-year­old "boy mayor" guided a city that two years later became the first since the Depression to go into default. 
Kucinich faced death threats, and was forced to wear a bulletproof vest when he threw out the first ball at a Cleveland Indians game. 
He barely survived a recall election but lost his bid for re-election by a landslide. Then, in the 1990s, he made a political comeback, winning a state Senate seat and even­tually capturing a U.S. House seat in 1996. 
Nepalese star trades fa111e for security 
Associated Press 
BALTIMORE-For millions of Nepalese worldwide, Prem Raja Mahat's rich, mellow voice is an instant portal to an idyllic pic­ture of life and love beneath the vistas of the highest mountain range in the world. 
The Nepalese music superstar is currently crafting his 47th album -while working as a restaurant manager in Baltimore, where he makes about three times what he did as his country's version of Bruce Springsteen. 
Mahat abandoned fame and his homeland sexen years ago to protect his wife and four school­aged children from an insur­gency that has killed more than 7,000 people. Guerrillas inspired by the late Chinese revolution­ary leader Mao Zedong have fought since 1996 to replace Nepal's constitutional monarchy with a communist state. The government calls them terror­ists. 
"I miss Nepal, because they love me there. I miss being famous," Mahat said recently, sipping a frothy yogurt lassi and watching the early dinner crowd stroll past the Mughal Garden restaurant, where he earns about $3,000 a month. 
"But in my country there is fighting and death and poverty. That is why I left," he said. "Every parent in the world ... wants to do well for their chil­dren. I am no different." 
There are approximately 50,000 Nepalese in the United States, according to Krishna Aryal. first secretary at the Embassy of Nepal in Washington. 
Forty percent of Nepal's 23 million people live in grinding poverty, and tourism to Katmandu, the country's cultur­ally rich capital, and Mt. Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border, has dropped because of the violence. The Himalayan kingdom lies between China and India. 
Todd Lewis, a professor of religion at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., who has lived in Nepal periodi­cally over the past 23 years, said Nepalese from all parts of socie­ty have left the country in search of better lives. 
"Having talent, even record­ing, doesn't necessarily get you anywhere financially in Nepal," Lewis said. "Even a modest, middle-class life here running a restaurant would still be vastly more lucrative than staying in Nepal and living off of one of the poorest communities in the world." 
Mahat, 42, is one of the most famous people to have left Nepal. While fans at home feel the loss, Nepalese in the United States revel in the handful of concerts he gives every year. 
When Mahat takes the stage, he usually carries a sarangi, a small stringed instrument that's played upright, like a miniature cello. He wears a high topi, the national cap of Nepal, and a brightly colored vest. His hit love song from 2002, "Hiunchulima Hiun," or "Snow in the Snowcapped Mountains," runs more than 20 minutes. 

"We call him the 'King of Folk Songs,"' said Ram Kharel, who hosts an American public access television show on Nepalese news and culture. "At every Nepalese event in America, even if he's not there, people sing his songs. He is that popular." 
Mahat originally came to the United States to visit friends. He decided to stay when he realized the opportunities his children would have here. Mahat plans to return once the violence sub­sides and his children are grown. In the meantime, he vis­its Nepal every year or so to record the songs he writes before his shift at the restau­rant. 
The important thing, he said, is that his children understand what he has given up -and why. 
"They thank me for bringing them here and giving them this opportunity," he said, flashing a wide, album-cover smile. "They understand my sacrifice, that I am giving up my name and good job -for them." 
For people who grew up idol­izing Mahat, seeing their hero toiling in an everyday job can be jarring. 
"We are a little sad because he is so famous in Nepal. It would be great for him to be singing rather than working in a restau­rant," said Roshanee Shrestha, who recently watched him bus tables and greet guests. She first heard Mahat's voice as a little girl, curled up in her home in the shadow of the snowcapped Himalayas.

AK Steel talks "critical" for success 
MIDDLETOWN. Ohio-AK Steel Corp.'s talks with its unions about ways to make the company more competitive are critical to the steelmaker's future, a company spokesman and analyst said Monday. 
Pension and retiree health care expenses account for $40 of each ton of steel that AK Steel sells, putting the company at a disadvan­tage compared to newer companies with lower costs, industry analyst Charles Bradford said. 
llot-rolled steel, for example, currently sells for about $290 a ton on the spot market, Bradford said. AK Steel supplies that steel to auto, construction and appliance markets. 
"They absolutely have to do something," said Bradford. of Bradford Research/Soleil Securities in New York City. "The question is, what can they do to offset a $40-per-ton penalty?" 
McCoy said the company has begun talks with its unions. including the United Steelworkers and the Armco Employees Independent Federation. which represents hourly workers at the company's Middletown Works mill. All sides have agreed to keep the details private, he said. 

Microsoft to release security update 
WASIIINGTON -Stung by criticism over lax software security, Microsoft Corp. disclosed plans Thursday to update its flagship Windows operating systems early in 2004 to make con­sumers less vulnerable to hackers. 
Microsoft said the changes, announced by chief executive Steve Ballmer during a trade conference in New Orleans, will be offered free in the next "service pack" update to users of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 software. 
The announcement was aimed at calming Microsoft customers increasingly irritated by the case with which hackers and others have broken into Windows computers. Adequately protecting an average personal computer can take far more time than many customers are willing to spend.

Natural gas deal sparks protests 
16 dead after martial law declared; president alleges foreign involvement 
Associated Press 
LA PAZ -Thousands took to the streets in the capital, chanting anti-gov­ernment slogans despite an announcement Monday by Bolivia's president that he will shelve controversial plans for natural gas exports. 
The plans to sell gas to the United States and Mexico had already pro­voked massive protests in which at least 16 people have been killed. 
But President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's deci­sion to abandon the project was followed by criticism from his own vice presi­dent, demands that he resign, large demonstra­tions and a public trans­portation strike that virtu­ally paralyzed La Paz on Monday. 
"I cannot continue to support the situation we are living," Vice President Carlos Mesa said, urging the president to change his policies. However, Mesa said he will not resign. 
Development Minister Jorge Torres, however, did step down citing "insur­mountable differences" with the president.

Oxford! Yup, we Darners have finally made it; after all of the planning, read­ing, shopping and flying, we are here and settled into our housing. How to describe Oxford to Notre Dame students ... that's the ques­tion. I'll try to break Geoff Johnston Oxford down into manageable, organ­ized chunks of infor­A Domer at mation. Oxford 
The town 
Darners have no relationship like that between the University and the city of Oxford. The University is dispersed throughout the city so that, between every College building, there are well­traveled roads, bridges and sidewalks. 
There are people everywhere. Europeans by the thousands line the sidewalks, dressed in fur, leather, long coats and boots, scurrying about from store to store, babbling in every human language. Buses rule the streets, careen­ing around turns and making sure that pedestrians know their place in the transportation food chain. Bicycles are ubiquitous and dangerous, scooters put­ter about, and souped up Vettes with huge exhausts drive by our. college win­dow at night, vibrating the whole flat with metallic bass. 
The city of Oxford is everywhere; there are merchants by the hundreds hawking their wares from 18th century shops, there are street performers and beggars, there are ambulances screaming with impossible volume down every road. The Town is loud, obnoxious, full of life. There is no parallel to the town at Notre Dame. Social life 
But what would Oxford be without its pubs? There are dozens of pubs, each with its own special clientele, some serv­ing primarily students and some serving the city in generaL The drinking age in England is 18, so students are every­where, drinking, eating and laughing. (Though from what I have seen, the argument that lowering the drinking age decreases the number of drunk students is false; there are plenty of students here who plan on leaving the pubs on a stretcher.) Pubs are the place to meet students in Oxford; random people will often sidle up to a half-filled table, no matter who else is sitting there. 
The food 
Well, British food, from what we have seen, is not very good. In fact, it is down­right awfuL Even in College, the food is bland, without a hint of spice (and I'm from the Midwest, where food is bland to begin with). But there are two bright spots: The many sandwich shops serve healthy, delicious lunches on-the-go, and the many ethnic restaurants around town serve spicy cuisine faithful to the culture. 
The gown 
The first thing one notices about the University is that it is old -very old. The buildings of beige Ashlar stone dominate certain sections of the city, with no rhyme or reason lo their placement. Amidst all of the shopping, yelling and eating, the University is at once invisible and overbearing. Watching over the walkers below, the buildings seem to be waiting, or perhaps meditating, oblivious to the action around them. But the cen­ter of undergraduate student life is the particular college where one eats, lives and studies. 
New College 
Each of the colleges that make up the University is a castle, with fortifications and battlements, guarded from the noise of the outside world by gardens of Day­Glo green grass and imposing, turreted towers. Inside the College walls, one enters a different and infinitely more tranquil world than the one outside. Passing through winding passageways of weathered stone, the sense of silence, of introspection, becomes more evident with each step. 
The New College Hall is similar to the one in Harry Potter: The walls lined with oak paneling, the paintings of College fel­lows watching meal after meal, the High Table standing above all of the benches and chairs. 

Completing the Old Schools Quad, the New College Chapel lies like a great ship docked in harbor, battered by age on the outside but immaculate within. Greeting visitors to Chapel stands a slightly larger than life-sized sculpture of Lazarus: His body seems to be slightly decomposed, emaciated beneath a wrap of bandages, but his head, which is much too large for his body, is turned at an impossible angle to face the altar. Behind the altar, there is an enormous wall filled to the very apex with delicate sculptures of saints, bishops and prophets. 
There are many gardens to graze in, and there are lively clubs to join and College bars to relax in, away from studying. 
Culture 

Here are a few of the invalid, sweeping and unfair generalizations I have made about the British. The British are more reserved and soft-spoken than Americans. When I first heard them con­verse, it sounded as if they were speak­ing in hushed, secretive tones about everything. Our manner of speaking, which is more a direct, in-your-face, get­to-the-point style, does not suit the British well. Also, the British eat much smaller meals than we Americans do (our portions per meal are probably dou­ble the size of theirs), but I haven't been to the local KFC, so I can't report on whether the American restaurants still super-size. They also don't exercise as much, unless you count the miles of walking they do, as few people own cars. There is so much more to say about Oxford, but those thoughts will have to wait for another day.

A dream overdue 
LETIERS TO THE EDITOR Too much criticism for Quinn 
You know. I'm getting really tired of the constant criticism Brady Quinn receives every weekend. Everyone seems to focus on what he's doing wrong rather than every­thing he's doing right. 
Consider the first few games of the sea­son. He was only put in to make an attempt at cleaning up our senior quarterback's mess (meanwhile gaining some experience). 
Take Michigan State, for example. Ty puts him in with five or six minutes left in the game, we need two touchdowns, and Quinn is in a no huddle offense. This is tremen­dous pressure for even a seasoned quarter­back, let alone an 18-year-old freshman with virtually no college football experi­ence. How does Quinn respond? He march­es all the way down the field and scores. Yet no one gave him any credit. On the con­trary, they just said how he didn't do any­thing to help get the win. · 
Fast forward to Purdue, Brady's first start and full game. Their line averaged 26 starts per player versus our four starts per player. The result? Brady gets the tar kicked out of him for the entire game. We had no run­ning game at all, so he's forced to throw 60 times, completing 30 for 300 yards. And he did this while getting hit something like 18 times, 14 of which were knockdowns (I don't remember the exact stats), not to mention he was our leading rusher with almost 50 yards. One hell of a performance in my book and the stats book. 
Nevertheless, the reporters and newspa­pers (including our own) all said the same 
thing: "Different quarterback, same 
results." Granted, I was very disappointed 
in the loss, but I was also really excited 
about Brady Quinn's performance, as well 
as the future of our young team. 
Now go to last weekend. Jones' running game kicks into high gear, taking a huge load off Quinn's shoulders, we win, and everyone complains that Quinn didn't throw enough and didn't contribute to the win. It just so happens that our team was much more well-rounded than past games, so Quinn didn't have to do everything like he did against Purdue. This is a good thing. 
My God, people, just leave the kid alone. He's done an extraordinary job so far. Sure, he makes some rookie mistakes, but we can't expect him to come out of high school playing like Joe "The Comeback Kid" Montana. Besides, all those edges will be smoothed out soon enough. You know all the talk about the "West Coast offense" everyone is so sick of hearing? Well, Brady is the quintessential (no pun intended) West Coast quarterback that Coach Willingham has been waiting for. 
Sure, give criticism where criticism is due, but it's equally important to give credit where credit is due. So give the boy some credit.

No more altar girls? 
I was sorry to see the frus­tration expressed in Anna Nussbaum's Oct. 10 letter. While this issue is open to legitimate debate, I'd like to offer reasons the Church might decide to disallow female altar servers (which, I should add, they haven't yet). 
The fact is, boys and girls are different. Girls are natural volunteers; they jump in and help wherever needed. It's hard to find an area of parish ministry that isn't mostly per­formed by women anymore, and more power to them. The unfortunate fallout is that reli­gion is often viewed as women's domain. All too com­mon is the Mass where the priest is the only prominent male, looking rather cowed by the overwhelming female presence. Hardly the image of an "alter Christus" whose example boys may want to fol­low. 
Having only altar boys pro­vides boys a way to serve that appeals to them. In parishes where girls serve, they often overtake that ministry, while the boys drop out of what becomes yet another girls' club. Giving the boys a chance to be boys at church is an opportunity to learn from the priest and each other about a faith of heroic sacrifice, a faith worth living and dying for and, yes, a faith even worth getting up earlier on Sunday for. 
Historically, altar serving has been a stepping stone in training for the priesthood, and the Church would like to return to that tradition. The results of this were shown by the Arlington, Va. diocese, which has only male altar servers, and is now among the top two U.S. dioceses for priestly vocations. 
Finally, I'd like to address a misconception the letter seems to imply. Our culture has misconstrued gender equality to consist of perform­ing the same tasks. This reflects a demeaning, utilitari­an view of the human person. Rather, we should understand that while men and women are intrinsically different, and thus serve Christ in different ways, the Church has always proclaimed their equal dignity. Remember that we uphold a woman as the highest created being uust look on top of the Dome).

One day last semester. I was walking to South Dining llall, a few yards in front of two white girls. I overheard their conversation about a friend, also white, and his troubles getting into his first choice college. Apparently this young man, with high test scores, good grades, and the usual exemplary extracurriculars was rejected from his dream school. One girl proffered, while her companion agreed, that if he had been a black male, or better yet a black female, his admission would be no problem. 
Ask yourself, in our world of sup­posed tolerance and political correct­ness, why would this girl make such prejudicial remarks within my-a black female's-earshot? Obviously she felt safe enough to express her opinions at that time because she prob­ably did not know any blacks were around. That girl and many other indi­viduals have candidly denounced blacks in my presence because they misjudged my fair complexion for whiteness. Instances like this illustrate our society's remaining racial bias and of the biggest impediments we face in

Americans think if they stay along the path of political correctness or preface their statements with the phrases like "Don't take this the wrong way... " or "Don't be offended, but..." they will never be called into question. Everyone shies from confrontation, unwilling to accept or speak truths about themselves and their communi­ties. This fear and its application of political correctness, is in my mind one tax cuts and deregulation, 
people of color are discarded to the ranks of the working poor, unem­ployed, incarcerated and impoverished. Blacks and Hispanics are the most fre­quent victims of environmental injus­tice, assigned to live and work in pol­luted urban neighborhoods. 
These issues even touch the splendid isolation of our University. According to the website Tolerance.org, there are five known hate organizations within spitting distance of Notre Dame in St. Joseph and Elkhart counties, including a Ku Klux Klan chapter in our own South Bend. In nearby Gary, public housing developers are building and relocating minority, mostly black, fami­lies into units constructed across the street from a known hazardous waste site. 
Our purpose as stewards of this country and our local communities is to leave conditions better than when we found them. We inherited a system of injustice which oppresses people of certain ethnicities and a cultural delu­sion of the "self-made" person. We need to discard these lies and tools of injustice created and perpetuated by the ruling classes and, on every social level, take a contemplative look at racial interactions and ideological con­structions. 
Individually, I challenge you to exam­ine your own ideas with intellectual honesty to pinpoint your own racial prejudices and then purge them. We all harbor stereotypes, and anyone who claims innocence is either lying or will­fully exists in a homogeneous fairy land. 
At Notre Dame, we need to not only create forums to debate racial topics, but also patronize them. Let's continue discussion of affirmative action, like at the panel discussion last week, and ini­tiate other instances where we can have constructive dialogue on issues of race and inequality. By coming togeth­er authentically, we can, after cen­turies of struggle, and build a racially harmonious society.

MOVIE REVIEW 

Charismatic Clooney excels in latest role 
ByJACK WATKINS 
Scene Movie Critic 
The most amazing thing about Intolerable Cruelty is not how good it is, but how bad it could have been. The film was originally se.t to star Hugh Grant and Tea Leoni, and Joe Dante was originally slated to direct it. Then Jeremy Irons and Heather Locklear were tabbed. Ron Howard was briefly in talks to direct. 
After going through various other permutations -involving Julia Roberts and Geoffrey Wright, among others -the final product somehow emerged as a Coen Brothers movie starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

sions and physical humor. 
Massey is a divorce attorney who becomes engaged in a complex duel with Marilyn Rexroth (Zeta-Jones). a beautiful and ruthless gold digger. Of course, the inevitable hilarity ensues, and the inevitable sparks fly. 
The Coen Brothers did not exactly write the script -they got on board the project and rewrote it to their tastes. It is likely that the basic plot of a romance between the rivals played by Clooney and Zeta-Jones was in the original script, but I find it impossible to believe that the far­cical supporting characters are any­thing but Coen inventions.

MOVIE REVIEW 

'The Rundown' trips over its own ambitions 
By ANNIE ROHRS Scene Movie Critic 
Director Peter Berg's The Rundown presents poor acting and poor script­ing in this combination action/comedy film that, in trying to be both, doesn't do either genre justice. 
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson plays Beck, a tough guy from Los Angeles who is working off debts to his wealthy boss by doing his dirty work. His dream is to own his own restau­rant, but before he can attain that, Beck has to do one final job. He must travel to the Brazilian jungles to retrieve his boss' son, Travis, played by Sean William Scott. Travis is seek­ing a treasure that would make him rich and has gotten himself into some trouble he can't get out of on his own. 


It proves to be no easy task for Beck, as he is foiled at all angles -by Travis, who has no desire to return home, by the forces of nature, by Mariana (Rosario Dawson); who's after the treasure for her own rea­sons, and by Hatcher (Christopher Walken). a slave-driver who owns a gold mine and employs everyone in town. Once Hatcher discovers that Travis knows how to find this treas­ure, which is worth a huge fortune, he

He single-handedly beats up the entire defensive line of an NFL team and fends off multiple attackers wielding guns, knives and whips, for the most part with no weapon of his own.

The movie is badly written, with the dialogue switching between extremely serious and extremely flippant. This clash, meant to add comic relief, is only distracting. The dialogue is unrealistic and the attempt to mix in humor with hard physical action falls short.

By trying too hard to be both, The Rundown fails to successfully take off as either an action or comedy film.

MOVIE REVIEW 
Tarantino hits his stride with 'Kill Bill' 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS 
Scene Movie Critic _ 
Kill Bill: Volume 1 has Quentin Tarantino's dirty little fingerprints all over it -the movie plays like a vanity piece. But not that that's bad, because if there's a director that deserves a vanity piece, it's Tarantino. Kill Bill is the fourth full-length feature he's directed. but he has already estab­lished himself as one of the great directors of American cinema. And Kill Bill proves to be a tour de force of his genius -his self-referential, isn't too concerned with plot; it's ·a simple revenge story told in a very stylized way. Revenge is the only motivation in the film. At first it seems odd to watch a film with no motivation. but therein lies one of Tarantino's annoyingly brilliant flour­ishes: By removing the reason for a story, he can focus on the telling of it. 
Kill Bill is a samurai movie. Well, it's a samurai movie seen through American eyes. Tarantino uses a lot of kitsch and cliche in the film. including an extended anime sequence for one of the character's back stories, which seems slightly insensitive at

By KATIE WAGNER 
Scene Movie Critic 
School of Rock is a slightly above­average comedy. It is entertaining for people of all ages, but leading actor Jack Black's overly dramatic acting weakens the film. The child actors and the music are this movie's high points. 
The movie begins with struggling heavy metal guitarist Dewey Finn (Black) getting kicked out of his band due to his on-stage antics. This 
shatters his lifelong dream of win­ning the battle of the bands. To make things worse, Finn's room­mate's overbearing girlfriend demands that the jobless and broke Finn pay his long overdue rent. Finn almost gives up on his musical aspi­rations until he discovers a ploy to both pay his rent and continue play­ing rock. 
He takes a role as a long-term sub­stitute at a prestigious private ele­mentary school, impersonating his friend and roommate Ned Schneebly (Mike White). Despite his students' 
raphy and earth-shaking sound edit­ing. The fighters move with a 
Matrix/Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon superhuman grace, but unlike the slew of Matrix wannabes, Kill Bill manages to retain the drama of the fights without the physical laws of nature. The Bride, though a fierce warrior, does get hurt and leaves open the question whether she will live through the second volume of the film, which will be released in the­
 
atres next February. 
Tarantino has really hit his stride with Kill Bill, and he knows it. Every second of the film is dripping with Tarantino's cocky, self-righteous and damned artistic personality. Kill Bill is a terrific film that quite perfectly demonstrates that Tarantino is truly a master of his craft.

Thanks to his passion, sense of humor and musical enter­taining ability, Black transforms these children into a group of rock musicians.

The diverse personalities of each fifth grade stu­dent make this

Dillon returns to 
practice Monday 
Associated Press 

CINCINNATI -Bengals run­ning back Corey Dillon returned to practice Monday after missing Cincinnati's last game with a strained groin. 
Dillon has been limited to one complete game this season. He hyperextended a knee in a pileup in Oakland in the second week of the season and strained his groin a week later. 
He started against Cleveland on Sept. 28, but had to leave the game because he couldn't cut. Coach Marvin Lewis then rested him during a loss at Buffalo, and Dillon didn't work out last week as the team was ofT. 
Lewis said it was too early to tell whether Dillon will be avail­able to play Sunday against Baltimore. 
"Everything looked fine," Lewis said. "Everybody worked today. It was good to have Corey out there." 
Dillon took handoffs, caught passes and ran some agility drills during the brief time that prac­tice was open to the media. 
"He did some things," backup Rudi Johnson said. "He didn't do everything, but what he did looked good." 
Dillon declined to talk to reporters after practice. 
McNabb fights through Injury 

PHILADELPIIIA -Donovan McNabb will remain the Eagles' starting quarterback despite a sprained right thumb that has limited his effectiveness. 
"He's working through the pain of that and should be fine," coach Andy Reid said Monday. 
McNabb struggled Sunday in a loss to Dallas, often overthrowing his targets. He was 11-for-26 for 126 yards, his lowest total in a mediocre season. 
McNabb, who was hurt Sept. 29 against Buffalo, played with wrapping around his thumb that extended to his wrist. 
"It's not an injury he can't play 
with," Heid said. 
Culpepper back as starter 
EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. 

Minnesota quarterback Daunte 
Culpepper will return to the 
starting lineup this weekend 
when the Vikings host Denver. 

Culpepper missed the Vikings' previous two games after break­ing three small bones -and par­tially fracturing a fourth -in his lower back Sept. 21 at Detroit. 
Gus Frerotte started in 
Culpepper's place in Minnesota's 
wins over San Francisco and 
Atlanta. Culpepper, who 
returned to practice Monday, got 
an extra week of rest because 
the Vikings were idle this past 
weekend. 

"He's good to go," coach Mike 
Tice said Monday. "He jumps 
right back in. He's the No. 1. Gus 
is back to being No.2." 
Brunell to have surgery 
JACKSONVILLE. Fla. 

Jaguars quarterback Mark 
Brunell had surgery Monday on 
his left elbow and will be out at 
least a few weeks. 

The surgery was done to allevi­
ate swelling on his throwing 
elbow. Coach Jack Del Rio said 
Monday it would be at least two 
or three weeks before Brunell 
could throw again. 

Brunell was injured Sept. 21 
when he slid on the artificial turf 
in Indianapolis. An abrasion on the elbow needed five stitches. 
Byron Lel'twich started his third straight game in Brunell's place Sunday against Miami. Leftwich was backed up by David Garrard, and Del Hio said he did­n't plan a roster move to acquire a third quarterback. 
Pennington could return soon 

HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. -Jets coach Herman Edwards said Monday there is a "50-50" chance quarterback Chad Pennington will start against the Philadelphia Eagles on Oct. 26. 
Pennington, out since the pre­season with a broken and dislo­cated left wrist, will begin doing team drills this week at practice wearing a red, noncontact jersey. 
.. 
Edwards said there is no chance Pennington will start Sunday against Houston. 
Edwards said he will make that decision later this week, and also is trying to decide whether to make Pennington the backup before he starts a game. As of Monday, Pennington has not been cleared to play. 
Gold out for season 

DENVEH -Denver linebacker Ian Gold will miss the rest of the season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. 
Gold was injured in the first quarter of Denver's 17-14 win Sunday against Pittsburgh while covering a punt. Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said Gold will have surgery after the swelling goes down, probably in a week or two. 
"It's really tough," Shanahan said Monday. "Any time you lose not only a great player, but a great leader and a great person, it's always tough." 
A hard hitter and one of the 
fastest linebackers in the league, 
Gold went to the Pro Bowl in 
2001. his second season, and 
replaced Bill Homanowski as a 
starter at outside linebacker last 
year. 

Gold was second on the team 
in tackles with 166 last season 
and he entered Sunday's game 
with 39, second to AI Wilson's 48. 
He also has two interceptions 
this year, including one for a 12­
yard touchdown in the opener 
against Cincinnati. 

"It's about as tough as it gets," 
defensive end Trevor Pryce said. 
"It's always tough when you lose 
somebody who plays hard and 
leaves everything on the line." 
Moulds could return this week 

ORCHARD PAHK. N.Y. ­
Buffalo receiver Eric Moulds 
could return to practice this 
week after missing the Bills' 30-3 
loss to the New York Jets 
because of a strained groin. 

Moulds didn't practice all last 
week but said Monday that he 
feels "a lot better." 

Coach Gregg Williams was 
cautious about Moulds' return. 

"We would hope that he would 
be able to get back out there 
sometime next week," he said. 

Moulds, Buffalo's leading 
receiver, was hurt when he fell 
awkwardly after making a catch 
that helped set up the Bills' win­
ning drive in a 22-16 victory over 
Cincinnati on Oct. 5. 

The Bills sorely missed him last 
weekend when they managed 
only 193 total yards. Backups 
Bobby Shaw and Josh Reed com­
bined for 100 yards receiving.

IN BRIEF 
Three Redskin players out 
with injuries 
ASHBURN. Va. -Washington Redskins tight end Robert Royal has a broken bone in his right hip and will miss at least six weeks. 
Running back Trung Canidate and cornerback Fred Smoot also could miss next week's game at Buffalo. Canidate has a severe ankle sprain, while Smoot sprained his shoulder in Sunday's 35-13 Joss to Tampa Bay. 
Royal was injured trying to block Simeon Rice. Rice got past Royal, knocked the ball away from quarter­back Patrick Ramsey and recovered the fumble to end Washington's open­ing drive. It was the first of Rice's four sacks in the game. 
"It was kind of a fluke injury," coach Steve Spurrier said Monday. "He got all twisted around somehow." 
Spurrier said Royal could go on injured reserve for the second straight year. Royal was out last sea­son whilerehabilitating a sprained ankle. 

Army coach Todd Berry
fired over losing record 
WEST POINT, N.Y.-Army coach Todd Berry was fired Monday after compiling a 5-35 record over four years. 
"The Corp of Cadets and the fans of Army football deserve a competitive program that is representative of this great institution," said Lt. Gen. William Lennox Jr., superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy. 
Army (0-6) has just one win in its last 17 games and a school-record 12 losses in a row. The Black Knights are averaging 63.8 yards rushing per game to rank last in the nation and are the only team averaging under two yards per carry. 
South Florida, playing its inaugural Conference USA game last month, shut out Army 28-0 at Michie Stadium, marking the first time the Black Knights had been blanked at home since 1981. 
John Mumford, who served as the team's defensive line coach the past 
four seasons. was named interim coach. 
OSU linebacker Reynolds
suspended for choking 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -Ohio State linebacker Robert Reynolds was sus­pended one game Monday for jam­ming his fingers into the throat of Wisconsin quarterback Jim Sorgi and choking him. 
Reynolds will miss the eighth­ranked Buckeyes' homecoming game Saturday against No. 9 Iowa at Ohio Stadium, coach Jim l'ressel said. 
Sorgi said he had difficulty talking and breathing after the injury in the third quarter of Wisconsin's 17-10 win Saturday night. He said he could­n't bark out the signals loud enough to be heard by the other players, keeping him from going back into the game. 
Reynolds issued a statement Sunday night through Ohio State, saying that he had apologized to Sorgi and Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez.

MEN's SoccER 
Irish hope to rebound against Vikings 

ByJUSTIN SCHUVER 
Associate Sports Editor 
A trip across the state bor­der might be just what Notre Dame needs to rebound from a disappointing conference loss last weekend 
The Irish (7-2-3, 3-2-1 in the Big East) travel to Ohio to face the Vikings of Cleveland State in a non-conference matchup tonight. Notre Dame's last game was a disappointing 5-2 loss at home to Big East-oppo­rwnt and No. 25 Hutgcrs. 
Despite his team's defeat, Irish coach Bobby Clark is ktwping a positivn outlook on things. 
"Healistically, you're going to lose a few games each year." he said. ''I've always said that winning is a habit and losing is a habit. You just don't want to get in the habit of losing." 
The Irish can take some pos­itives out of the loss to the Scarlet Knights. Freshman Ian Etherington, who has provided solid play all year, finally got rewarded for his hard work with the first goal of his Irish career. Senior captain Greg Martin had the other tally for the Irish. 
Notre Dame came into the Hutgers game ranked fifth in the nation but figures to fall a little when the new polls come out. Just the same, however. the Irish are on the national radar, and it's important for the team to bounce back right away. 
"The nice thing is that we don't have to wait too long to show that we're still a very good team," Clark said. "If we had to wait a week or so to play again, that would be kind of annoying. 
"That's one of the positives of our situation, and I think the boys are looking forward to this game." 
Cleveland State (6-7) comes into tonight's game on its own downward swing. The Vikings are currently mired in a four­game losing streak, including two consecutive shutouts. Their last game was a 2-0 loss at home to Marshall Thursday. 
By far, the offensive leader for the Vikings is Stephen Ademolu. The junior forward from Windsor, Ont., leads the team with 23 points (10 goals and three assists). Forward Spencer Lappin is second on the team with 14 points (five goals and four assists). 
In goal, the Vikings rotate the trio of freshman Josh Cain and juniors Scott Deitz and Amir Kettani. Kettani has the most starts, with nine. but Cain has a better goals-against average (Cain has a 1.94 GAA to Kettani's 2.11). 
The Vikings have roughly matched their opponents goal­for-goal this season, scoring 24 goals while giving up 27. They have been out shot 185-142 in 13 games this year. 
Despite the fact the Vikings are a non-conference oppo­nent, Clark does not believe his team will lighten up on its intensity. 
"I think we'll be very solid Tuesday night," he said. "Anytime you're coming off a loss, you have to regroup. We've got to win all the games we can. 

"There will only be one league champion, and we have to be very conscious of at-large bids [for the postseason NCAA tournament] and get as good a record as possible." 
The Cleveland State game is the first in a four-game road trip in which the Irish will play three Big East matches. After facing the Vikings, the Irish will travel to Storrs, Conn. to meet Connecticut Saturday night.

Winless Adrian gives Belles unexpected test 
Saint Mary's gains eighth win of season 
By JOE HETTLER Sports Editor 
It wasn't the kind of game Saint Mary's expected from lowly Adrian. 
The Belles played solid defense and recorded their fifth shutout of the year in a 2­0 win Saturday, but they couldn't dominate Adrian (0­12, 0-8 in the MIAA} the way they did when the teams first met last month. Saint Mary's won that game 7-0. 
"We played a strong game defensively but could not develop our rhythm within our attack," Belles coach Peter Haring said. "We had some good opportunities but were a tad slow to the ball while going to goal." 
The Belles also lost two players for their next game against rival Hope -one to a red card and another to injury. 
Sophomore defender Shannon Culbertson received a red card in the 72nd minute on a hard tackle of an Adrian player. The card will keep Culbertson out of the team's Saturday game against Hope. 
Senior striker Wendy Irvin injured her ankle during the beginning of the second half and could not return. She is listed as out for next week, as well. 
Saint Mary's got on the scoreboard when freshman 

Colleen Courtney fired a long chip shot from 35 yards out over the goalkeeper's head for an unassisted score in th·e 35th minute. It was the first goal of Courtney's collegiate career. 
Fellow freshman Carolyn Logan added the Belles second goal in the 68th minute, when she stole an Adrian pass and raced down the field to put the ball past the goaltender for another unassisted score ­Logan's fifth goaL of the sea­son. 
The win puts the Belles at 8­2-2 on the season and into sole possession of second place in the MIAA standings, two points behind leader Hope. The Flying Dutch are 7­1 in conference play, com­pared to the Belles 5-1-2 mark. The Belles will" have a chance to knock down Hope this weekend, but they will do so without two of their play­ers. 
"We have a big match against Hope next Saturday, and I will have to go to the drawing board and devise a plan to solve the key losses that we took [Saturday]," Haring said. "This coming week will be a test of this team's mental st'l"ength and their ability to come together to continue with our success thus far." 
The game is at home and starts at 10 a.m.

Belles bounce back with wins 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
The Belles got a pair of much-needed wins this week­end on the road at the Tri­State University Triangular. 
Saint Mary's (14-10, 2-7 in MIAA} defeated host school Tri-State University Saturday with a score of 36-34, 30-24, 30-27. The Belles later knocked off University of Michigan -Dearborn by the score of 30-28, 30-24, 29-31, 30-18 to win the Tri-State Triangular. 
"During the whole day, I was happy with how our players maintained their poise," coach Julie Schroeder-Biek said. "The officiating was not some of the best we've ever seen, but we were able to control the things we had to control to win." 
One of the factors contribut­ing to the Belles' tournament victory was a newfound offen­sive production by the middle attack. Middle hitter Elise Rupright led the team with 12 kills against Tri-State, and middle hitter Shelly Bender contributed 10 kills to the win over UMD. 
"Saint Mary's is near the pin­nacle of academics; it's always ranked high in the Midwest. And so the next logical step to increase its valu'e in the coun­try was athletics," Hamilton said. 
The Belles will now take some time off and begin team practice again in February. The team plans to travel to Pinehurst on spring break to face some of the best teams in the nation. Until then, Hamilton said the team will work out individually and pre­pare to take aim at the Division III national title next year. 
Contact Joe Hettler at jhettler@nd.edu 


The team continued to get its usual production from out­side hitter Kristen Playko, as well, with the freshman col­lecting 18 kills and 19 digs against UMD and 11 kills and 15 digs against Tri-State. Classmate Ann Cusack had a solid day at the defensive spe­cialist position, collecting 42 total digs in the two matches. 
The Belles came into the Triangular on a three-game losing streak, including two conference losses. The wins Saturday came at a time when the team needed a momentum of change. 
"It was a real good boost for us to win this thing," Schroeder-Biek said. "I think we really played good team volleyball. The team really talked a lot better. 
"We need that kind of com­munication going into the home stretch. We're too good of a team to be where we are in the conference standings right now."

Ultimate Frisbee 

The men's and women's ulti­mate frisbee squads competed at St. Olaf's Annual exit 69 Tournament at the National Sports Complex in Blaine, Minn. last weekend. The men's field of 29 teams was highlighted by the presence of three national powers ­Colorado, Carleton and the reigning national champions, Wisconsin. 
The Irish entered Pool Play ranked fourth in their pool, and proceeded to sweep St. Olaf, 13-8, Northwestern, 13-7 and a stunning 13-10 win over Carleton. The Irish then defeated Steven's Point 13-11 in the Prequarters, the University of Chicago 13-5 in the quarterfinals and Madison X in the semifinals 13-10. In the finals, the Irish fell to the other Wisconsin squad, Madison Y, by a final count of 13-5. 
Stanford Hall junior Matthew Sullivan was dominant on defense dominance as he tal­lied 15 defensive stops over the weekend. Off-campus sen­iors Sean O'Neill, Tom Bemiller and David Hoffman spearheaded the offense, which peaked in the semifinals as Notre Dame only turned the disc over once on offensive points for a score. 
The women's squad also had a fine showing as it placed third in the event. The Irish opened with wins over St. Ben's, 13-2 and Macalester, 10-7, before dropping a game to Train Wreck, 13-5. In the quarterfinals, the Irish defeat­ed the Madison club, Hufflepuff. 10-7, before drop­ping the semifinals to power­house Carleton. 13-1. 
Senior co-captain Naomi Cordell and classmate Katie Twidwell sparked the team on offense and defense. Saint Mary's sophomore Amanda Schramm was outstanding in making the transition to the handler position. Freshman Rachel Meeks caught several scores in her first outing. 
"The team stepped up the level of intensity and pulled out some close matches," co­captain Jill Daugherty said. "We are starting to gel offen­sively and gain a lot of confi­dence."

Twenty sailors from the Notre Dame sailing club com­peted in three regattas last weekend in a flurry of activity. Seth O'Donnell, Katie Bush, Dave Harmon, Liz Shelleby, Kate Kennedy and Kathy Monticello competed in Indianapolis in IUPUI's Last Call Regatta. Kennedy and Monticello placed second in the B division, while O'Donnell and Bush sailed very well in the A division. 
Katie Honey, Meghann Finerghty, Erin Elser, Halph Pantony, Katie Brandes, Dan Hyan and Mike Stephens sailed in the Cary-Price Memorial Intersectional hosted by the University of Michigan. Saturday was cold and windy with some very exciting rac­ing. Stephens and Elser raced in the A division, with Honey and Finerghty in the B divi­sion. As racing conditions changed through the day, Brandes crewed in the A divi­sion with Ryan and Honey later sailing in the B's. Pantony skippered with Finerghty as crew on Sunday in the B division. The Irish placed seventh overall with Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan claiming the top three spots for the Big 10, fol­lowed by Cornell. Ohio, Michigan State, Notre Dame and Miami (Ohio).

Sorin's offense didn't see much time on the field throughout the game but then again most of the team was playing on both sides of the ball. Call it bad luck or just strange coincidence, but a large group of Sarin's starters weren't at the game. 
"We had three of our best players hurt today," O'Keefe said. "We even were missing one guy who got stuck in traf­fic on the way back from Chicago." 
To make things worse for Sorin, St. Ed's consistent rushing attack looked like it would wear down their undermanned team. 
"They ran the ball all over us in the first half but I think they got just as tired as we did," O'Keefe said. "We don't do a whole lot of conditioning during the week but somehow we stayed tough during the second half." 
The turning point in the game occurred at the end of the first half when St. Ed's failed to score after getting the ball first and goal at the 3. Sarin's defense held on three plays in a row and time ran out in the half before St. Ed's could get off a final play. 
Sarin's victory in their last regular season game puts them at 2-2. St.Ed's record now stands at 1-1-1 with one game left to play. The playoff situation for both teams will be decided by the games on Wednesday. 
Zahm 10, Fisher 7 
Wit.h the right players, in t~e nght place, at the right t111_1e. the Zahmbies played a skillful game to a victorious en?. Zahm won by a field goal this past Sunday, defeating Fisher 10-7, to put Zahm in possible contention for a play­off spot. 
"We had outstanding play from people who know how to pl~y foot?all," Zahm captain Mike Maimone said. "These guys stepped up and gave it everything they had." 
The win brings Zahm's record to 2-2 and closes its regular season play but puts the Green Wave back to a trailing 1-2 record with one game left against St. Ed's Wednesday. 
Zahm opened with the ball but quickly lost it on a fum­ble. The defense didn't back down however, holding the Fisher team behind the first­down line and forced the Green Wave to punt. 
Several long drives by quar­terback Casey Cullen started Fisher's second quarter more successfully, but Fisher lost the momentum after a third­down sack. 
The Zahm team energy as a whole exploded on its next 
ball posses­
sion.· Most 
for moving the ball into scor­ing territory. 
"Our defense stepped up, though we couldn't stop all the runs, but most of all, the offense's passing really game came to life," Zahm coach Joe Washington said. 
Zahm completed their touchdown drive with a pass to Mike Russell at the 15 and then Chad Knapke in the end zone. 
In the third quarter the Green Wave tried to make up the deficit with Andy Pfiester and Cullen running the ball, but the Zahmbie defense blocked a Fisher field goal attempt to end the quarter. 
Both teams were pushing at the end, playing fast but also sometimes clumsily. Zahm failed to make a first down against Fisher's aggressive defensive line. but regained the ball shortly after as the result of a Green Wave fum­ble. 
The offense made huge strides down the field, but then opted for the field goal. Kicker Zach Jara sent the ball through successfully for what turned about to be the game­winner. 
With just five minutes left on the clock, a revived Fisher offense then surprised its opponents with a rapid touch­down and extra-point comple­tion. 
Zahm scrambled to increase its lead but couldn't gain the needed yards. Fisher looked to try for a second touchdown in the last seconds but an interception by Zahm's Luke Dillon sealed the game for a Zahmbie triumph. 
"We lacked the intensity ... and once we had it at the end it came about because we had our backs to the wall, but it was too late," Fisher captain Tom Gorman said. 
After hopes of matching last season's opening loss turn­around with another three game winning streak. Fisher was surprised and dissatisfied by the outcome of the game. 
"We're disappointed we did­n't play at the level we should have," Gorman said. "As for next week, we're just looking to play better than we did and have some fun."

Keenan, Morrissey tie 12-12 
By KATERINE GALES, KATIE 
WAGNER and LAUREN 
OSTERHUS 
Sports Writer 

A closely played game ended anticlimactically Sunday after­noon, as the Keenan Knights tied the Morrissey Manorites 12-12. 
"We definitely didn't play as well as we should have " Morrissey quarterback Marty Mooney said. "We came out flat -this was a game we needed to 
win." 

Keenan appeared to be the supe~or team in the first quarter, scormg two easy touchdowns. Although the first drive of the game resulted in a punt to Morrissey, Keenan's Mark Munninghoff intercepted the ball for a 35-yard run that put the Knights first and goal on the Manor's 5. 
Quarterback Patrick Downey f?und Reed Langton on the goal !me for a touchdown by inches. Morrissey fought back to block the extra-point kick attempt. 
Langton would come through for the Knights again on the next Morrissey drive, blocking the punt and running it back for a touchdown. The extra point again f~ll short, as the Knights faked a kick and Downey's pass to the end zone was high. 
The Knights would not be in dangerous scoring territory again. Keenan started the second quarter with the ball on its own 13-yard line, then dropped six yards as the Manor defensive line forced a fumble. The punt on fourth and nine was blocked by Morrissey's Joe Dugan, who ran the ball back for the touchdown. 
In the second half, Mooney completed a twenty-yard pass to Dave Purcell for a touchdown. 
The extra-point was blocked, leaving the score at 12-12. 
Although the Manorites would put together several drives for the rest of the game, they would not be in close scoring range again. 
Keenan kept the defensive pressure on, as Brian Long sacked Mooney on his own 48­yard line for a loss of eight yards and Langton almost intercepted the next pass. 
Langton would later sack Mooney and end Morrissey's offense for the game. · 
However, Downey was unable to complete the long pass as time expired. 
Alumnl27, Keough 0 

Thanks to Alumni senior cor­nerback/wide receiver Cory Harkins three touchdowns and Alumni's dominate defense Keough (0-3) left the field Sunday defeated and scoreless, losing to Alumni 27-0. 
Keough's first possession ended quickly with an interception by Harkins. Alumni senior quarter­back Chris Cottingham completed a 14-yard touchdown pass to Harkins during Alumni's third possession to put the Dawgs on the board. 
After a touchdown pass from Cottingham to Chris Seponski and a field goal. Cottingham launched a 45-yard pass to a wide-open Harkins for another touchdown. Harkins scored Alumni's final touchdown off an interception and a 60-yard run by Harkins. 
"I feel I played well and I think our team did great," Harkins said "This was a must win for the playoffs." 
This win was especially exciting for Alumni (2-2). The team lost its last two games and was playing without six players due to injuries. 
"I think our defense leads the team, but finally our offense did what they had to and stepped it up," Seponski said. "By the end of the game, both sides of the ball were playing up to their poten­tial." 
Dillon 42, Stanford 0 

Dillon cruised by Stanford Sunday 42-0 behind a potent offensive attack and stringent defense that forced three inter­ceptions. 
The Big Red had six offensive touchdowns, as Stanford was unable to defend against Dillon's dominant running game. The Griffins also struggled to move the football throughout the game. 
Dillon's defense stopped Stanford at every turn. Ed Lira grabb~d two picks for the Big Red, With Robert McBride adding another interception. 
The defense positioned the ball well, providing scoring opportuni­ties on which the offense never failed to capitalize. 
Robert McBride, Ray Dennis, Dan Block and Ben Butwin all scored for Dillon, while Kevin McCarthy's had two more touch­downs in the incredible victory. 
Stanford seemed more focused on having a good time this season than on winning the league. This Sunday's contest was their last game, and although they lost, the Griffms remained upbeat. 
"I think we're defmitely the best 0-4 team out there," said tackle Matt Goulet. 
Although scoreless, the Stanford players never lost their spirit throughout the game, ardently supporting their team from the sideline.

Something to build on 
Victory at Pittsbrugh could be just what Irish need to get back on track 
By JOE HETTLER 

Sports Editor 
It might have only been one victory, but Saturday's dominating performance on the road against Pittsburgh could be the turning point for the Irish this season. 
After barely squeaking out a win over Washington State in its first game, Notre Dame dropped three straight games and fell to a measly 1-3. 
But Saturday may have turned the tides. 
to right guard. The mo-ve paid off as the Irish had a successful rushing attack. 
"I think everyone really kept their focus during the bye week," Molinaro said. "It's been really important not to listen to any outside voices. It's going to come. If we keep working hard it will come our way." 
Heading into the Pittsburgh game, arguably the weakest part of the team was the running game. But that unit can now build on the record-breaking rushing per­formance ofJulius Jones and the dominat­ing way it played on the rmal drive, when the Irish ran off the last nine minutes of the game. That

17 5 total yards and the running backs and offensive 
offense gained 352 yards on the ground -the most by a Notre Dame team since 1999. 
"We've just never given up since the first week," offensive lineman Jim Molinaro said. "We've just kept moving forward. We knew we had to keep making progress and really build on what we accomplished [Saturday]." 
The bye week may have been the biggest factor in helping Notre Dame make such vast improvements. The week off gave the coaches a chance to move people around, like inserting freshman Ryan Harris into the right tackle spot and moving Dan Stevenson lineman. "Sometimes you 
bicker back and forth. But this time we just said, 'If there's a hole, hit it, if there's not a hole, make one.' 
The Irish must now look ahead to the Trojans, Boston College on the road and then a home game against Florida State. If Notre Dame can fmd a way to get through that stretch, they will have a good chance of finishing the season on a strong note, with games against Navy, BYU, Stanford and Syracuse to end the year.

Knott destroys Carrol119-0 
By ANN LOUGHERY, STEVE 
COYER and RACHEL 
SCHIROS 
Sports Wrirers 

The two teams couldn't have been more different. 
The Carroll Vermin (1-2) suf­fered the most severe loss of their season 19-0 Sunday to the Knott Juggerknotts (2-1-1). Knott captain Drew Donovan described the win as "the best we've played all year." Donovan also believes Sunday's win will propel them to the playoffs after fall break. 
Knott scored early in the first quarter after senior Mike Pykosz caught a 20-yard pass 
from  quarterback  Ben  
Gilfillan.  Kicker  Eric  
Wooldridge  sent  the  ball  

through the uprights for the extra point to put the Juggs in the lead 7-0. 
"That really got us going," Donovan said of the touch­down. "From then on, we real. ly couldn't do anything wrong." 
On the following play, a penalty hindered the Vermin's offensive drive and ended the quarter. Several other penal­ties throughout the game limit­ed Carroll's opportunities for scoring. 
The Vermin began the sec­ond quarter in possession of the ball but soon relinquished it to the Juggs after a fourth down bungled punt attempt. Knott running back John Bisanz gained 15 yards rush­ing on the next two plays before the Juggs turned the ball over to the Vermin. 
Sophomore Alex Fergus soon intercepted a pass from Carroll quarterback Kory Wilmot to regain possession. Pykosz ran for 10 yards to put Knott 20 yards away from the end zone. 
After catching a five-yard pass from Gilfillan, Knott wide receiver Mike Peters ran for 10 yards into the end zone. Senior Dustin Beauchamp countered the offensive drive by blocking the Juggs' attempt for the extra point. 
Peters was additionally 
responsible for another touch­down at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Donovan cited Peters as a player that realized his potential during the game. 
"We really have to get him on the field as much as possi­ble," Donovan said. · 
It wasn't until the fourth quarter that the Vermin got their offense going. In the final minutes of the game, Wilmot rushed for 10 yards and passed for 15 to Butz and sophomore Dan Berkhout. 
"We abandoned our game plan early and never really got back on track until the fourth quarter," Butz said of the late offensive drive. "We lost as a team today." 
Carroll will face Siegfried Wednesday. Sorln 6, St. Ed's 0 
Usually there's strength in numbers but Sorin proved an exception to that saying as its 15 man squad pulled out a 6-0 victory Sunday over St.Ed's.

Belles enjoy second straight MIAA title 
By JOE HETTLER 
Spores Edi cor 

Even after a tough first nine holes, the Saint Mary's golf team didn't lose confidence or the conference title. 
The Belles used consistent team play in the final 27 holes to fend off Albion by six strokes. Saint Mary's also won the overall standings for the season with a team average of 341 strokes per match. It was the second straight season the Belles dominated the MIAA conference. 
"We knew what we had to do," coach Mark Hamilton said. "We played consistent and we had the most consis­tent scores. There were no days really low, but no days really high either." 
After day one the Belles shot 342, good enough for a seven stroke lead over Albion. Hope, Saint Mary's stiffest competi­tion all season, struggled to a 
363. That high score all but locked up the overall season title for the Belles. So the team focused on putting away Albion on day two of the tournament. 
"We weren't so much focused on Hope as we were on Albion," Hamilton said. "But [Hope's] high score did take some of the pressure off." 
Stefanie Simmerman, the defending Division III national champion, finished the tourna­ment in fifth -tied with team­mate Julie Adams. Both had scores of 165. Simmerman also tied for co-medalist honors for the entire fall season with a 
82.8 average. Adams was only one stroke away from tying her teammate, as she ended the fall averaging an impressive 83 strokes per round. 
The championship is also positive for the entire Saint Mary's community. The Belles
