INSIDE COLUMN 

IN BRIEF 
Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson plan to adopt a baby that is expected to be born in a California hospital this week, according to a publicist for Anderson. "I love kids," Anderson, 41, said in an interview published in Tuesday's Daily News. "If I'd been with the right man when I was younger, I'd have had four." Anderson added, "Burt has always wanted to be a father. He asked me if at 52 he'll be able to get used to the noise of a child. I told him it's gradual." -Associated Press 
-Rock superstar Michael Jackson will return to Japan for a series of concerts in December as a finale to his world tour and then will probably retire from the con­cert circuit, his manager said Tuesday. The reclusive singer kicked off his world tour in Japan last fall, perform­ing before about 450,000 fans and creating a storm the Japanese media dubbed "Typhoon Michael." The singer will continue making records, Dileo said, adding that Jack­son also wants to make movies. -Associated Press 
-After kicking an addiction to Valium and vodka, at the Hazelden drug treatment center, fashion designer Calvin Klein says he's a new man, more relaxed about life-and clothes. "I'm in the first year of my second life," Klein said in an interview in the September issue of Vogue magazine. "I feel reborn. I really am seeing things dif­ferently." Klein said he's been taking horseback riding and sailing lessons and going to movies -something he never had the patience for before. And, he said, his new outlook should be visible on clothing racks next spring. ­Associated Press

ately we can't do that because we're not the Weekly World News, despite columns like this one occasionally. 
Anyway, on October 14 of last year, a column appeared in this space that attempted to predict the future of the University using Tarot cards, an old Gypsy trick. Well, yesterday I stumbled upon my old column and lo and be­hold, it actually seemed to predict a recent im­portant campus event. Guess which one. So without further ado, here is the text direct from Wednesday, October 14, 1987:

crowd, killing more than 40 people and injuring hundreds. 
Air show crash takes toll on six Americans 
Associated Press 
Ramstein, West Germany­The death toll in the worst crash at an air show rose to 49 Tuesday, and officials feared some children hospitalized with severe burns had been or­phaned because no one in­quired about them. 
The Pentagon said six Americans were among those killed when three Italian jets collided Sunday at the U.S. air Base in Ramstein, one hurtling into the crowd in flames. 
West German officials said two people died of burns Tues­day, raising their death toll to 
49. They said 14 had been iden­tified, including the three Ital­ian pilots. None of the 14 was a 
U.S. citizen. 
Chief Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the latest 
U.S. count put the number of confirmed fatalities at 40, in­cluding six Americans, four Germans, three Italians and 'l:l

The Defense Department was trying to resolve its con­flicts in the casualty counts, he said. 
The latest Pentagon count also showed 363 individuals in­jured, of whom 41 were Americans and 322 were Ger­mans, Howard said. 
Four U.S. bur., victims were flown to the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, for further treatment. Surgeons and other medical staff took nearly an hour to move the blanket-covered patients from a military am­bulance onto a C-141 U.S. air Force transport plane. 
The West German Bild and Abendpost newspapers said at least three children were hospi­talized with serious burns.

Divers find 10,000 year old jaw in river 

Associated Press 
Williams, Ind.-Two women diving for mussels in the White River discovered what a scien­tist say is the lower jaw of a mastodon, an elephant-like animal extinct for about 10,000 years. 
Chris Amstutz and Randy Cornett found the jaw late last week while harvesting mussels near Williams Dam southwest of Bedford in Lawrence County. 
Mastodons were stockier and not as tall as elephants. Some had tusks and teeth up to 3 inches wide and 6 inches long. 
Ron Richards, curator of paleobiology at the Indiana State Museum, saw the jaw and confirmed Monday that it is from a mastodon. "There's no doubt about it," he said. 
"Somewhere in that river you've got the whole skeleton, but it could be a hundred miles away. 
"The find is in pretty good condition," said Richards. "In general, there are not that many of these things around in this good of shape." 
Richards, who attributed the condition to a lack of exposure to the elements, said there have been about 200 sightings of mastodon remains throughout Indiana. 
Amstutz said he wasn't sure what he had found when he first 
ran across the jaw in 4 feet of 
water. 
"I saw two little rows of 
bumps running parallel with 
each other," he said. "At first 
I thought it was some type of 
concrete block." 
He said if drought conditions 
had not caused the water to be 
so clear, the jaw might have 
remained unnoticed. 
"The clarity of the water is the best I've ever seen it," he said. "Usually when you're musseling, if you have 12 or 14 inches of vision you have good river diving. Right now, we've got excellent vision. You can see a fish swimming 8 to 10 feet from you. It's almost like diving in a quarry." 
When Amstutz started brush­ing the sand away from the ob­ject, he saw what appeared to be the white part of a tooth. 
"There was no doubt in my mind it was a tooth, and I was sure it was bigger than any tooth I'd ever seen." 
"The biggest tooth in a horse's or cow's head isn't even an inch square," he said. "We're talking four inches square with these teeth. I saw those big teeth and I just knew it was something prehistoric." 
Amstutz and Cornett used a screwdriver to loosen the gravel around the jaw. "It was in gravel, sand and old mussel shells," said Amstutz. "It looked something like a fish nest."

Through the GSU graduate students are represented in the University's Graduate Council, the Academic Council, and the Advanced Student Affairs Committee, all operat­ing at the highest levels of the Univer­sity administration and dealing with critical issues in graduate student life. Moreover, graduate students have the opportunity to participate through the GSU in the Board of Trustees' Student Affairs Committee meetings held twice 
a year. The most recent GSU report presented to the Board, together with the 1987 GSU Housing Report, have been instrumental in University deliberations concerning a new graduate student housing project already on the drawing board. 
In an effort to continue providing in­formation to the University administra­tion regarding graduate student con­cerns and interests, the GSU --in collaboration with the Office of Ad­vanced Studies --will run a Graduate Student Survey early next spring. 
It is essential for the effectiveness of the Graduate Student Union that all graduate students participate at some level. The GSU cannot function without the involvement and administrative ability of its members. Virtually any activity the GSU undertakes --social, academic, cultural or athletic --is con­ceived and carried out by 'Volunteers. Every full-time Master's or Ph.D. stu­dent in the Graduate School at Notre Dame is automatically a Qlember of the Graduate Student Union. 
Each department is asked to hold elections for two departmental repre­sentatives at the beginning of the fall. Departmental representatives together with the officers of the GSU constitute the Graduate Student Council, the rep­resentative and governing heart of the Union. Election procedures will be dis­tributed during the first Graduate Stu­dent Council meeting, to be held Tues­day August 13, 7:00 p.m. at the Notre Dame Room (2nd floor LaFortune). All interested are welcome. 
Stop by our new office, located at 307 LaFortune Student Center, or phone us at 239-6963 to register as an active mem­ber and pick up your handbook. We will be glad to meet you, let you know what the GSU can do for you, and show you the things you may want to do for the GSU. Every minute of your time is pre­cious for us.

P.O. Box Q 

Doonesbury 
Big business dominates media 
Dear Editor: 

Mr. Hahn is his February 1, column, "Abortion issue needs rethinking," states that he wants "opinion forming thought" on the volatile topic of abor­tion. So do most people, but in order for this to occur hyperbole, incomplete analysis, and callousness must be avoided. Mr. Hahn states that we are encountering ''an atrocity coimparable to the Nazi holocaust." Over six million Jews dies in Hitler's Germany. To equate any number of abortions with this ultimate expression of hate and bigotry is ridiculous. Remember, human beings dies, not potential human beings. Furthermore to infer a parallel between a Nazi and an abortionist is hypocritical and cruel. 
Mr. Hahn cited the decision of some doctors to selectively abort fetuses and 
Garry Trudeau 
commented--"How low has the medical profession sunk this time?" I will grant that this is a potentially unethical prac­tice, but if Mr. Hahn had explored the issue deeper he would have learned that in many instances the survival of any of the fetuses depends on the aborting of the others. 
Another difficulty with his article was the lack of this issue must involve the rights of women, to omit them evidences a sexist attitude which too often prevails on the right to life side. 
In any discussion of a controversial issue it is important to avoid fanatacism but it is particularly vital on the abortion question. If the U.S. is to reach a concensus on this pressing issue we must do so after examing and respecting all sides with objectivity and compassion.

alftime at home football games brings many images to mind: the band, the cheerleaders, trips back out to Green field to find lin­gering tailgaters, and the all­out suicidal rush for food, just to name a few. This season, halftime may bring football fans the added attraction of the Irish Porn Pon Squad. 
Some people may remem­ber a group called the Dan­cin' Irish. The Porn Pons are not simply a revival of the Dancin' Irish, who were more entertainment-oriented. "We are spirit-oriented," says senior Erica Hinkle, who is captain of the squad. "We don't want the role of just entertainment. We are more dancing, but we are not show­girls." The dancing is what distinguishes the Poms from the cheerleaders. The cheer­leaders concentrate on cheer­ing and stunts, while the Poms focus on dancing, and never perform without music. 
The 1988-89 squad consists of sixteen girls, eight from Notre Dame and eight from Saint Mary's. "It just hap-for Notre Dame students to gain a cultural awareness of the third world in order to experience the joys and frustrations of life without modern conveniences. The primary objective of the trip was not to teach Mexican or­phans English or to alleviate some of the wretched living conditions in the village. The purpose of the trip was to ed­ucate Notre Dame students. The work they performed did not significantly impact the village of Oaxaca. It was the impact that these services had on the students that was the purpose and the impor­tance of their journey south. 

pened to work out that there were half from each school," says Hinkle. "We don't have a quota." Tryouts were held last spring, and over the sum­mer the squad accompanied the Notre Dame cheerleaders to Eastern Tennessee State University for a week-long camp and a competition in 
which they fared quite well. 
The girls have a grueling 
hour and half practice every 
Sunday through Thursday. 
As of now, the Poms are only performing at Stepan pep rallies, and the Bookstore Basketball pep rally. They are working closely with the band director, however, in trying to figure out an ar­rangement with the band for football games. Hinkle would also like to see the Poms "show some support for the non-revenue sports" and per­form at events such as wo­men's basketball. 
The students should be seeing more of the Porn Pon squad in the future, once their role is fully established. As for now, even though things are just barely started, Erica thinks things "are going really well."

Defensive line dominates despite injuries 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Sports Writer 
With the recent series of in­juries, one might expect lack­luster performances from Notre Dame's defensive line in early fall practices. 
Much to the delight of line co­ach John Palermo, the opposite has happened. The defense has dominated the fall practices, adding to the problems of an already struggling offensive line. 
"I like to think we have some­thing to do with it," Palermo said of the offensive line's prob­lems. "We're going to have a real test Sept. 10 against Mic­higan. Hopefully we'll get bet­ter, play fundamentally hard and make things happen." 
The line is currently without the services of senior Tom Gor-

will also find out if the lessons learned in exhibition play wil­lcarry through into the regular season. The real test will be for the freshmen, who will be get­ting their first taste of col­legiate volleyball. 
Two freshmen, setter Julie Bremner and hitter Jai Bruno, started every game in China, which should make their transition easier. Junior hitter Kathy Cunningham got her first taste of competition since last year when she had surgery to repair a dislocated shoulder. Lam_bert also was impressed 
Soccer 
continued from page 12 
all-time scoring chart with 82 points. Morris set the single­season assist record last year with 17 in 21 games. 
Sophomore Danny Stebbins man at tackle. Gorman had 23 solo tackles and one sack last season. The 6-6, 255-pounder is battling a pulled chest muscle, but Palermo says he will be back for the Michigan opener. 
Tackle Bob Dahl, out with an bruised thigh, will most likely be back in action at Michigan State. Ted FitzGerald is also on the injured list, fighting a sprained knee. FitzGerald re­corded 16 tackles last fall. 
Even with those injuries, the competition is still fierce for the starting spots. Sophomore Chris Zorich is at nose tackle with sophomore George Wil­liams and juniors Jeff Almand Bryan Flannery fighting for the right and left tackle posi­tions. 
Flannery had 18 tackles last year while Alm had five. Zorich did not play a down last fall, 
by the play of senior captain Maureen Shea and senior Zanette Bennett. 
The players spent most of their time either training or competing in games, but they also found time to enjoy a bit a Chinese culture. 
"It was quite a transition," said Cunningham. "We had to adjust to different food and a new environment, but it helped bond the team together and make it stronger." 
The "famous American vol­leyball stars," as they were billed by many press releases and banners, visited the Great Wall and the Ming Tombs on their day as tourists, and even 
omore Mike Drury will fill the sweeper position vacated by Steve Lowney. Stopper Paul LaVigne will get the assign­ment of marking the opposi­tion's top forward, and he will be joined at times by Guignon in a double-stopper formation. 

Jeff Aim and Williams played only eight minutes. "Right now, we have not settled on a starting lineup," Palermo said. "We have a scrimmage Friday and a meeting Sunday, then we'll be able to give a lineup for the 

Michigan game." 
Others battling for spots on the line are juniors Steve Roddy and Mike Crounse, soph­omore Mike Callan and fresh­men Mirko Jurkovic and Ber­nard Mannelly. 
"There are very, very good athletes on the defensive line," Zorich said. "The best three of these athletes will start against Michigan." 
The Irish defensive line came under criticism last season for lack of an effective pass rush. Palermo hopes to change that this fall, but says the effective­ness of the rush will depend largely on the opponent. For example, Notre Dame will con­
centrate  on  curbing the  run­ 
ning  game  against  the  
Wolverines.  

"Pass rush depends a lot of 
the time on what the offense does," Palermo said. "The No. 1 priority against Michigan is to stop the run. That's our goal. That's what we've been working on in practice." 
"We are definitely going to have a pass rush," Zorich promised. "If I have a chance to get the quarterback, I'll get a sack." 
For now, though, those sacks will come only against fellow Irish teammates. The opener against the Wolverines is still more than a week away, and Palermo said he thinks there is considerable room for im­provement. 
"Generally, we can always improve fundamentally on the little things," Palermo said. "Most ofthe time the big things take care of themselves."

Seniors lead Irish soccer squad into '88 season 
·-­
By PETE GEGEN Sports Writer 
The following appeared in the Sept. 2, 1985 issue of The Observer: 
The Notre Dame soccer team opened its 1985 season yesterday with a 3-0 loss at Virginia . .. The Irish were unable to stay in the game with the Cavaliers, who are ranked third in the country. 
"We just got schooled," remembers senior captain John Guignon of the first game of his collegiate career. "We had four freshmen start, and eventually six 
were on the field. We knew we had a long way to go." Four years later, the Irish have come a long way. 
"We went through the pits in '85 with a 7-11-4 record," says Irish head coach Dennis Grace. "But I did it for a reason, and look where we are now. The players have done things nobody gave them a chance to do." 
Last season the team rocketed to a 17-3-1 record and a national ranking, just missing a bid to the NCAA Tourn­ament. Now, as the Irish open their 1988 season Thursday night at Krause Stadium, they prepare for a grueling road schedule and the challenge of proving last season's top-20 ranking was no fluke. 

And leading the way for the team will be the seniors, Grace's first recruiting class, the same players involved in that loss to Virginia four years ago. And the seniors, of which five will start and two others come off the bench, will settle for no less this season than an NCAA 
bid. "To get to

Chinese teach Irish volleyball on trip 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's volleyball team has returned home after a ten day tour through China, where it played members of a team head coach Art Lambert considers to be one of the smartest and best he's ever seen. 
That team, comprised of players from the Chinese Olympic team that won the gold medal in 1984 and the World Championship in 1985, won each of the five matches played, and they taught the Irish some valuable lessons. 
"It was a tremendous learning experience," said Lambert. "We learned a few new tech­niques and they forced us to turn our intensity level up a notch. Playing a team like China enabled us to find out exactly where our strengths and weaknesses are." 
The trip took the Irish through Beijing, Har­bin and Daqing, and exposed them to fanfare seldom encountered in the United States. They attracted capacity crowds at every stop, as people packed into gyms to see players like Lang Ping--known as the "Iron Hammer"--who is considered a national hero and one of the best hitters in the world. The players often spent a half hour before each match wading through throngs of people and small children who sang as they presented them with flowers. 
"The crowds were terrific," said Lambert. "If we played in a gym that held 5,000 people, then 5,000 showed up. If we played in one that held 10,000, then 10,000 showed up. People love volleyball over there." 
The Irish will find out if Americans--and Notre Dame fans--share this enthusiasm for the sport this Saturday as they host Indiana. They

Rice hurdles all that blocks his path 
If Tony Rice ran track he would be a hurdler, leaping obstacles which stand in the way of the finish line. 
The hurdles have certainly been placed before Anthony Eugene Rice during his short career at Notre Dame, beginning even before the affable junior quarterback stepped foot on this campus. 
When Rice signed a national letter of intent to attend college at Notre Dame in February, 1986, it was big news. He had 7,000 career yards in total offense. His team lost only two games in four years of high school, both in the state championship. He

was named a Parade All-American. And he had a 640 combined 
score on his Scholastic Aptitude Tests. 
The cry went out--is Lou Holtz lowering Notre Dame's stand­
ards by bringing in an unworthy candidate? Doesn't he realize 
that this is squeeky-clean Notre Dame? Will Tony Rice make it 
at this prestigious University if he comes here? 
No, the standards are the same. Yes, we are still clean. And 
yes Tony Rice has proven that he can make it as a fooball player 
and as a student at the University of Notre Dame. 
The race Tony Rice started two-and-a-half years ago began 
with that first obstacle. It continued with another hurdle--sitting 
out his freshman year under NCAA legislation Proposition 48. 
The signal-caller with the rocket-arm and tree-stump legs was 
now reserved to tossing the pigskin on the greens of South Quad 
instead of the greens of Notre Dame Stadium. 
"One the one hand," says Rice, "I had a lot of opportunities to meet new people that some of the other freshmen football players didn't because they didn't have the free time I had. I really enjoyed the contact and interaction with people. The dis­advantage was that I was a step behind and it was going to be a little harder going into the system under Coach Holtz." 
But now his time has come. Though he was platooned with sophomore Kent Graham much of last season after a broken collarbone sidelined Terry Andrysiak, there is now no question that the Woodruff, S.C. native will be taking the snap come Sep­tember 10 when Bo Schembechler's boys come to town. 
"Tony Rice is our starting quarterback," asserted Lou Holtz at Tuesday's press conference. "You can tell he's the leader from the time he steps into the huddle," continued Holtz. "It was obvious to me when he stepped in at the Pitt game last year and ran the football team that this was not your average competitor. I'm not just talking about his ability to run or his improvements in throwing the football. His leadership qualities and command of the huddle and the team that set him apart from the rest of our quarterbacks. The team just runs very well when he is in there." 
The only thing that was obvious to Rice coming out of his first huddle in the Pitt game was that he was in the wrong place-­behind the guard. He shook off that embarrassing moment as easily as he would dodge opponents in the remaining weeks of the season as he directed the dominating 'Pony Express' running attack. 
Still, the hurdles kept coming. While he continues to bring home the passing grades in the classroom, the grades on his passing have been less than complimentary. But if anything is stable in the Irish offense at this point of fall practice it is the gun of Rice, who completed 14-of-21 tosses in Saturday's scrimmage for 200 yards. 
"This summer I threw all that talk (that he was a poor passer) out of my mind and just came into the fall more relaxed and confident," said Rice. "I knew I was a good passer in high school and I'm a good passer here now. Last year I took what everybody said personally and I thought that maybe they were right. This year I don't worry about what people say--l'll just do my job." 
And that job, the axis around which this football team revolves, is finally his. But the race is not over for Tony Rice. In fact, it is barely half over. There are more hurdles in the way. Michigan is one. Operating behind an inexperienced offensive line is an­other. But these hurdles loom no larger than those which Tony Rice has faced in the past two years. And as he continues to pass his obstacles, the probability that the Irish will pass teams on the way up the polls becomes all the more probable.
