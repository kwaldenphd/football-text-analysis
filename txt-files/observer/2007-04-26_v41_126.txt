College celebrates SMCTostal 
Canoe race, fireworks included in activities 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 

As Notre Dame hosts its week of AnTostal events, Saint Mary's is celebrating spring its own way -with SMC Tostal, which takes place today. 
Sponsored by the Student Activities Board (SAB). the event will feature henna tattoo and caricature artists, an out­door picnic and a screening of "Dreamgirls" on the Library Green. among other activities. 
This year's event planners, juniors Noelle Whiteside and Cassie Calion, decided to include canoe races on Lake Marion and a firewqrks display over Angela Athletic Facility at dusk, in contrast to last year's "concert-series atmosphere," headlined with a performance by the band Phantom Planet. 
"We decided to have the activ­ities of the day centered around a heritage theme," Calion said. 
Earlier in the semester, SAB sent students a survey regard­ing what they would like to see at this year's SMC Tostal. 

The response to the survey was unfortunately underwhelm­ing, Calion said, but students seem to be positive about the chosen activities nonetheless. 
"We have heard a ton of posi­tive feedback from the student body regarding this year's activ­

Tonight is officially my last night working at The Observer.

News Editor 
than 150 articles 
later, here I am, 
watching as the 
next batch of ambitious reporters 
take the reins. 
I've always balked at the thought of writing an Inside Column about work­ing at The 0 -too meta for my taste -but I feel like, just for tonight, it might be appropriate. After all, of the lessons I've learned the hard way in college, one of the most important came from this basement office. 
A lot of people don't believe how much work the writers and editors here put in. None of these people, however, have lived with me. Or, per­haps, even casually encountered me. 
There was a time -called sopho­more year -when my life was liter­ally not my own. It got to the point when my then-boyfriend would cringe whenever my cell phone rang, know­ing that I was going to be unreach­able for the rest of the night. The Observer was always my top priority, and I staunchly defended my deci­sions to drop everything (and every­one) to work when I was needed. 
And then I got sick. Really sick. But !.wouldn't stop working. I barely slept, I survived on coffee and gum, but I still worked. And I had the peo­ple I loved most in life begging me to stop, to help them, to help myself. 
Somewhere in that mess, there was a breaking point. I honestly don't remember what it was, but since then, I've quit The 0 twice. Effective, clearly. But even though I've kept coming back, each time I've learned how to put more and more distance between myself and this place. I've ·realized that yes, it's all right to tell people 'no' every once in a while. And no, people won't hate you if you don't always say 'yes.' 
And you're rolling your eyes by now. This is all quite melodramatic, l know. But I guarantee that many of you will face the same problem, soon­er rather than later. 
As you start your first jobs, you'll be expected to work longer and harder than the next person. Your boss will ask you to work late, work on Saturday, work on Sunday, work on Christmas ... and many of yo~ will say yes, afraid that it'll mean the differ­ence between a promotion and a pink slip. 
As you start your families, you'll be faced with the choice between board meetings or ballet recitals, conference calls or coughing kids. And what about making time for exercise? Church? Sleep? 
Priorities will only get harder to keep in order as we move through life, so now is the time to try to sort them out. Draw your boundaries, and be prepared to defend them. 
It's a lesson that took me four years to learn. 
The views expressed in the Inside Column are those of the author and not necessarily those ofThe Observer.

Ohio judge frees man after Bible quiz 
CINCINNATI -A man arrested on Wednesday for allegedly trying to use a stolen credit card at a drug­store got a break from a judge after passing a sort of Bible quiz. 
When Eric Hine appeared in court this morning, his attorney described him as a church-goer, hoping the judge would set a low bond. 
Hamilton County Municipal Court Judge John Burlew was skeptical and asked Hine to recite the 23rd Psalm. 
He did: all six verses. Some in the courtroom applauded.

Several patrons who had dressed as the super hero were asked to step outside so the woman could identify the suspect, Frederiksen said. 
She picked out Raymond Adamcik, 54, police said. 
After he was arrested, he tried to flush marijuana down a toilet at a police sta­tion, police said. 
Information compiled from the Associated Press. 
Burlew was satisfied and released Hine on a $10,0000 appearance bond, meaning he'll have to pay that amount if he doesn't show up for his next court date.

For:m_er LavvSchool dean dies 
Special to the Observer 
William B. Lawless, former dean of the University of Notre Dame Law School, died Monday in San Francisco after an ill­ness. He was 84. 
A native of Buffalo, N.Y., Lawless was editor of the Notre Dame Lawyer before receiving his law degree from the University in 1944. He did naval service in the South Pacific following his gradua­tion, studied at the University of Buffalo and earned a degree in constitutional law from Harvard University in 1950. 
He was in private practice in Buffalo and served from 1960 to 1968 on New York's Supreme Court before returning to Notre Dame where he served as dean of the Law School from 1968 to 1971. The Law School doubled in size and established its London program during his tenure, which also included the school's centennial celebration. 
The Lawless family has requested that, in lieu of flow­ers, donations be sent to sup-. port scholarships for Notre Dame law students. The address is: Notre Dame Law School Annual Fund, 1100 Grace Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556.

The subsequent impeach­ment and removal hearings for former Morrissey senator Greg Dworjan -who violated the Student Union Constitution by using the copy machine in the student government office for campaign purposes and dis­playing "Campaign to Abstain" posters without the permission of the Judicial Council or the Student Activities Office ­added to these impressions. 
"Over and over again, I hear criticism of student govern­ment's purported preference for dialogue over taking con­certed action to positively affect student life," Brown said. 
Brown urged the senators and the committee chairs to combat these perceptions. The members of the student gov­ernment can change these negative opinions, Brown said, by "aggressively campaign[ingl for improvements to student life -not by talking about how we can change students' pref­erences, but rather by stimu­lating positive changes that students will have no choice but to notice." 
Brown said she and Braun have created a platform to spur these changes. By center­ing their ideas under five main areas -community relations, social concerns, academic environment, student govern­ment and student life -Brown said they can make changes and improvements that stu­dents will notice. 
In the three and a half weeks since she and Braun took office, Brown said they have already made significant improvements -a rate of progress she said she hoped to continue next year. 
Brown said she and Braun have met with the Center for Social Concerns regarding a community-based curriculum, and said they will work on an action plan for this over the summer. Preparations are also underway for a faculty-student debate series, which will pair students with faculty members to debate current events. 
Brown and Braun are also working with Food Services to explore the possibility of a guest meal exchange program so students can convert their remaining meals for use by their visiting family members or friends. 
Brown said she anticipated that a student government Web site would be created over the summer with message boards and forums so students can have access to their repre­sentatives.

Bayrou won't support candidates 
PARIS -They wooed him hard, even leav­ing messages on his cell phone, and on Wednesday he spurned them both. 
Beaten but defiant, the third-place finisher in France's first-round presidential ballot said he would not throw his 7 million voters behind either conservative front-runner Nicolas Sarkozy or Socialist Segolene Royal, the two candidates still fighting for the top job. 
Instead, Francois Bayrou said he will form a new party in the political center, setting his sights on the next election in 2012. 
The decision not to play kingmaker in the May 6 runoff was a major gamble that could reshape France's political future-or kill his career. 
Bin Laden behind February attack 
CAIRO, Egypt -A top Taliban command­er said al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was behind the February attack outside a 
U.S. military base in Afghanistan during a visit by Vice President Dick Cheney, accord­ing to an interview shown Wednesday by Arab broadcaster Al-Jazeera. 
Bin Laden planned and supervised the attack that killed 23 people outside the Bagram base while Cheney was there, said Mullah Dadullah, the Taliban's main mili­tary commander in southern Afghanistan who has had close associations with al­Qaida. 
"You may remember the martyr operation inside the Bagram base, which targeted a senior U.S. official. ... That operation was the result of his wise planning. He (bin Laden) planned that operation and guided us through it. The operation was a success," Dadullah told Al-Jazeera.

Katrina cruelty charges dropped 
NEW ORLEANS -The state on Wednesday dropped 36 counts of cruelty to the infirm against the owners of a nursing home where 35 people died in the flooding of Hurricane Katrina. 
Salvador Mangano and his wife, Mabel, still face 28 counts of cruelty to the infirm and 35 counts of negligent homicide. 
State prosecutors said the Manganos, who own St. Rita's nursing home in St. Bernard Parish, should have taken steps to evacuate patients before flood waters rose due to the Aug. 29, 2005 storm. 


Texas hit by at least two tornadoes 
EAGLE PASS, Texas -David Sanchez was fixing a car at dusk when the winds began to howl and the rain began to pound his home, like spring storms are known to do around here. 
Suddenly, the dog house flew by. Shingles peeled off the roof. Mesquite trees snapped around him, ripped up by a tornado that cut through this border town Tuesday night. Tornadoes killed at least 10 people in Eagle Pass and across the Rio Grande in Piedras Negras, Mexico. 
"I never pray, and I was praying," the 50­year-old mechanic said in Spanish, as his daughter translated. 
Two Texas elementary schools and a church were wrecked, and hundreds of homes on both sides of the border were damaged or destroyed by at least two tornadoes.

Student charged with making fake IDs 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -An Indiana University student was charged Wednesday with making hundreds of fake identification cards that showed up in at least seven other states. 
Nicholas Richardson, 21, of Bloomington faces a felony charge of counterfeiting and a misdemeanor charge of distribution of false government-issued identification, Indiana State Excise Police said. 
The agency began its investigation last month after seizing dozens of false IDs at local bars, liquor stores and grocery stores.

Olmert rejects ground offensive 


Five-month cease-fire given one last chance to succeed despite smuggling 
Associated Press 

JERUSALEM -Prime 
Minister Ehud Olmert and his 
top security chiefs on 
Wednesday rejected calls for 
a massive ground offensive in 
the Gaza Strip following a 
renewal of rocket attacks on 
southern Israel by the llamas 
militant group. 

The decision gave a five­month cease-fire one last chance to succeed, despite repeated warnings by mili­tary oflieials that Barnas has been using the lull in fighting to smuggle large amounts of weapons into Gaza. But Israeli officials warned of "harsh steps" if the rockets keep falling. 
In a separate development, the government's chief watchdog recommended opening a criminal investiga­tion into a 2001 government transaction that involved Olmert before he became prime minister. The announcement further weak­ened the embattled Israeli leader ahead of a potentially explosive inquiry report next week on last year's war with Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.

"Residence Life is intimately involved in the students' educa­tion, just like any other depart­ment at the University -second only to the faculty," Kirk said. "And one of the things you'lllearn in college is how to act responsibly and maturely." 
He said the changes in the policy clarified the guidelines his office uses to intervene in cases where a student's use or abuse of alcohol may be destructive. 
"Do [the changes] mean that the use and abuse of alcohol among students have declined?" Kirk said. "No, I don't think so -but I think we are better equipped with the rules and regulations that we have in place to address problems and issues with the use of alco­hol."

"Hall staffs spend a dispropor­tionate amount of time and energy addressing behavior related to alcohol," Poorman said in the let­ter. 
In the following days, students voiced their dissatisfaction, rally­ing more than 600 protesters out­side LaFortune Student Center to burn copies of duLac, the student handbook, and bear signs that read "Save Liquor." 
A second demonstration brought more than 100 angry stu­dents to the steps of the Main Building at midnight on a week­day. Protesters hurled beer bottles at the windows before scattering at the arrival of Notre Dame Security/Police. 
They also sent Poorman a peti­tion with more than 4,000 signa­tures and a letter that summa­rized the thoughts and objections of the student body, including fears that taking hall dances else­where would threaten dorm tradi­tions and unity. 
Before 2002, dances were host­ed in the 24-hour spaces of resi­dence halls, but Poorman said few students remained in those spaces during the dances. Students

rooms -forcing the hall staff to scatter to try to monitor the entire building, he said. The sparse supervision gave way to cases of vandalism, sexual and physical assault and alcohol intoxication across the hall, Poorman said. 
After the changes were announced, students said moving the dances to off-hall venues would drive more students off campus, but the percentage of on­campus students did not change, staying at 80 percent throughout the last five years, according to the Office of Residence Life and Housing. 
"The predictions that students would move off campus because of the changes in the alcohol poli­cy have proven to be mistaken," Poorman said. "Based on my observations and my own experi­ence residing in one of the male dorms, I would say the halls are the same vibrant, spirited commu­nities today that they've always been." 
Junior Fernando Contreras said he has enjoyed every minute in Alumni Hall, the residence hall where he has lived since his fresh­man year.

your dates to the dance, and about how everyone would get drunk together in the hallways that whole week," Contreras said. 
The Wake, one of the hall's sig­nature traditions, once featured a procession of Alumni residents and pallbearers that carried rec­tor Father George Rozum into the dance inside a coffin, symbolizing the death of the hall's set of laws during Wake Week, he said. 
"Apparently, it was total anar­chy for a whole week," Contreras said. "I mean, the Wake is still fun because it's the thing you do with your dorm, but I bet it would've been insane to be there when it was so wild." 
Despite the taming of the Wake in the aftermath of the revised alcohol policy, he said he "would­n't trade living in Alumni." 
Besides its effects on the long­standing traditions of the halls, student demonstrators in 2002 also said the policy changes would only force students to drink liquor off campus rather than in their rooms -and they predicted the number of accidents and deaths related to driving under the influ­ence ofalcohol would increase. 
One person did die in the fall of 2002 -but Poorman refused to answer all the questions sur­rounding the tragedy. 
On December 12, 2002, fresh­man Chad Sharon disappeared one night after attending a party on Corby Boulevard. He was not seen for two months after that night, until his body was found in Saint Joseph River with a 0.224 blood-alcohol content-almost three times the Indiana limit for drivers. 
"Many believe that after leaving the party alone on a wintry, icy night, he fell into the river and was drowned," Poorman said. "The extent to which alcohol played a role in this accident is not known." 
He said while he did not know the exact circumstances of Sharon's death, he did know "there are dozens of students on college campuses across the nation that die every year because of alcohol poisoning." 
"In a great many instances, these students consumed large quantities ofhard alcohol in a very short period of time," Poorman said. "Banning hard alcohol in the halls was a concrete, practical step we could take as a university to reduce the risk of this happen­ing at ND." 
The changes to the alcohol poli­cy, he said, were not passed to end alcohol consumption on campus but rather to reduce the risk of extreme intoxication by banning drinks that have twice the alcohol content of beer. 
The third story in this series will examine the projected future of Notre Dame's drinking culture in light of national trends and the actions the University is taking to address alcohol use and abuse on campus.

While the forecast calls for rain today, this would only affect outdoor events. All of the events in the Student Center will still occur. However, if it does rain, dinner will be moved into the Noble Family Dining Hall, and the screening of "Dreamgirls" will be moved into Vander Vennett theater in the basement of the Student Center. 
In case of rain, the canoe races and fireworks will not occur today, but they will not be canceled completely. 
"The firework display and canoe races will clearly need to be rescheduled for another date sometime before the end of the semester," Calion said. 
The event is open to the Saint Mary's, Holy Cross and Notre Dame communities, and all of the activities are free . 
''I'm really excited about SMC Tostal," sophomore Jessie Sobczyk said. "Although I wish the events were on a weekend so they wouldn't conflict with classes and I could participate in more of the events."

IN BRIEF 
Health insurer's stock falls, profits rise 
INDIANAPOLIS -WeliPoint Inc. said Wednesday its first-quarter profit rose 7 per­cent, but the nation's largest health insurer's stock fell amid Wall Street's concerns over ris­ing costs for its state-sponsored business in two states, including California. 
Net income rose to $783.1 million, or $1.26 per share, from $731.8 million, or $1.09 per share, a year ago, including a penny per share in net realized investment losses. 
Revenue grew 9 percent to $15.08 billion from $13.84 billion in the prior-year period, driven by premium rate increases in the com­pany's local group business, growth in the Medicare Advantage business, increased reim­bursement in the Federal Employee Program, and higher state-sponsored membership. 
The profit and revenue matched the expec­tations of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial, but analysts repeatedly questioned company executives about the costs WellPoint is incurring in its California state-sponsored business. WellPoint shares fell $3.40, or 4.1 percent, to close at $78.84 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Hearst Corp. settles antitrust lawsuit 
SAN FRANCISCO -Hearst Corp. and MediaNews Group, Inc. have settled an antitrust lawsuit initiated by a San Francisco businessman that alleged a business partnership between the two newspaper publishers would create a region­al monopoly on readership and advertising. 
The two companies agreed to rescind an agree­ment to share national advertising, distribution and production in the Bay Area under a settle­ment announced Wednesday with San Francisco businessman Clint Reilly. 
New York-based Hearst, which owns the San Francisco Chronicle, invested $300 million in MediaNews in a complex deal that helped finance the Denver-based publisher's purchase of the Contra Costa Times, Monterey County Herald and San Jose Mercury News last year. 
In the federal lawsuit filed in July, Reilly alleged that the business partnership would limit compe­tition in the regional newspaper market, drive up subscription prices and reduce journalistic diver­sity. He cited the April 2006 cooperative agree­ment between the two companies.

Delta emerges from bankruptcy

Delta estimates it will be

largest airline slashed $3 
billion in annual costs. 
More than 95 percent of 
creditors voted to endorse 
the plan for Delta to leave 
bankruptcy as a stand

had been put in jeopardy 
by a $9.8 billion hostile

Quarter dogs cost a quarter; hence the name, "quarter dog." 
To understand this concept, you needn't have fulfilled Notre Dame's six-credit math requirement; instead, you Simply needed a post-midnight Huddle trip. · 
By the end of your collegiate career, aside from accumulating a staggering 120 credits, you undoubtedly con­sumed many a quarter dog. And with mere weeks until graduation, the "what ifs" of the past four years inevitably ereep into the consciences of the senior class. 
If you could do college again, what would you do differently? 
I asked some Notre Dame employees what they thought -what did they wish that the soon-to-be-graduates had done differently? 
"Hot dogs don't have barcodes. You can't scan 'em," one late-night Huddle employee advised. He said that it was not uncommon for you and the other post-midnight inebriated to stumble over to the register and wave quarter dogs in front of the price scanner, then wait for the cashier to announce the total. Aside from your obvious oversight that a quarter dog always costs a quarter, your continued attempts to scan a barcode-less item created quite a scene -one that could've been different. 
One late-night Sbarro employee said she'd seen it all during her shifts, from flying pizzas to people dressed as Power.Rangers. Yet what she saw didn't disturb her as much as what she heard-chats chock-full of the "f-word." So what did she wish that you'd done differently? She suggested, "If you can cuss somebody out without using one cuss word, then that shows 

that you're an intelligent person." 
While Sbarro patrons littered LaFortune with their language, others littered the dining halls -literally. During a typical South or North Dining Hall luneh lunch, you and your fellow students essentially tableeloth­ed table after table with eopies of The Obsnrvnr or the Chicago Tribune. As one dining hall monitor said, "If the monitors didn't reeyele the newspa­pers, the dining hall would be buried under them." 
And the monitors wnren't the only dining hall staffers equipped with suggestions. "I wish everybody would stop eating mustard," one plate­scraping dish cleaner said. According to this rubber-gloved worker, mustard is not the easiest-to-clean eondiment. And what else did she wish you wouldn't have done? Stuffed a napkin in your drink or stuek a fork in your apple. 
And just as forks don't belong inside of apples, banana peels don't bnlong inside of books. Thus the advice of a woman on the Ilesburgh Library's book restoration erew: "Don't use a banana peel as a bookmark." Precedent has proved that it loaves behind a moldy yellow mush. For you of the Internet age, book researeh ean be exeruciating enough -let alone when there's a putrid stench protrud­ing from between the pages. 
Throughout your past years, read­ing for class also proved excruciating. And don't think that your laek of elass preparedness slipped past your pro­fessors. One history professor said that while at the helm of the elass, "You do see a lot of blank stares. It'd be niee to see the students engaged." And how, in this hypothetical "next time around," eould you go about appearing "engaged"? This profes­sor's suggestion: "Well, stay awake." He'd rather you nod along with his leetures, as opposed to nodding off. 
But sleep is an integral part of eol­lege. And class isn't the only unsuit­able plaee to sleep; apparently, lofted beds aren't the best option either. One Health Serviees nurse cited the obvi­ous "germ-sharing" and the not-so­obvious "lofted beds" as two of the guiltiest eulprits of your visits to St. Liam Hall. This nurse's "next time around" solution to the ubiquitous falling-out-of-bunk problem-"just put some padding on the floor." 
Padding is key for eushioning a fall, and as a Notre Dame student, you probably needed some feathering to fall on. While fulfilling your math requirements, you also tottered on a tightrope; four years of eollege ean throw you off of more than just your lofted bed. 
In hindsight, you can clairvoyantly see those words that you should -or shouldn't-have spoken. You ean see what-or whom-you should've paid attention to. You even ean see what you should've disposed of, whether it is those already-been-read newspapers or those bad-for-you rela­tionships. If you could repeat these four years, you'd undoubtedly make some modifications. 
But of eourse, there's plenty that you wouldn't change, regardless of how many ehances you had to re-live eollege. You graduate with at least 120 credits, but to your eredit, you leave with far more life lessons than eould ever be quantified -or even paid for at the Huddle. And I don't know about you, but I like mustard, espeeially on quarter dogs. 
If college is comparable to tightrope walking, then wow -sign me up for the circus.

Make a good ending 
The end of the semester and-the end of the 2006­07 school year is upon us. Some of you won't be back next year due to graduation, travel abroad or transfer to another school. Others will return next fall tilled with hope for a fresh start to a new year. Whatever your circumstances, it Kate would be easy enough just to Barrett stumble out of here with your suit­cases, exhausted and stressed-out FaithPoint from finals, leaving your post­"packed-for-summer-storage" empty, dingy room and the roommates who used to be your best friends -and who are now driving you crazy ~ in the rear­view mirror. 
Don't do it! Give your best effort towards summon­ing up the energy to say what you need to say. Tell someone you love her. Thank your friends for their kindnesses. Offer forgiveness, or ask for it. Senior week and commencement offer graduates lots of chances to say "good-bye," "thank you," and ''I'm sorry," but the rest of us will have to make sure that such exchanges happen. And as local, national and global events have taught us just recently, there's no point in waiting until some "appropriate" future time to seek peace, express gratitude or offer love. 
.Just this past Tuesday, even as the South Bend community was concluding memorial events for Cpl. Scott Severns, a police officer killed in the line of duty one year ago, Cpl. Nick Polizzotto, also a South Bend officer, died after being shot while responding to a "shots fired" call at a local motel. 
On Monday, nine paratroopers from the famed 82nd Airborne were killed and 20 more wounded when a suicide truck bomber attacked their convoy. Perhaps no more can even be said that hasn't been said already about the shootings at Virginia Tech last week, or about the innocent people of Iraq or Darfur dying by the hundreds each week. 
But don't you hope that Cpl. Polizzotto gave his young son a big hug before he left for work on Tuesday? And the students and faculty at Virginia Tech who died so tragically and the soldiers who gave their lives in Iraq-don't you long to believe that they each had happened to call home or e-mail their moms and dads; that they hadn't just by horri­ble coincidence left unresolved an ugly argument with a friend or family member? 
Time is precious as the last, partial week of the semester approaches. Finals, packing, storage, trav­el and work all contribute to making this one of the less-appealing times of the academic year. But if you have even just a few minutes, think about who you need to call or e-mail or text message or speak to. If you have even just a few more minutes, take a look at some of the letters of Paul in the New Testament. At the time of his writing many people, including Paul, thought that Jesus' return-and the end of the world -was imminent. Paul's letters reflect a concern to help believers figure out how to live when time could be short; when !he "day of the Lord" could come "like a thief in the night" (1 Thes. 5:2). In that same letter, he offers a plea to the Thessalonians that might help us, no matter how challimging it seems at this time of year: "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all cir­cumstances" (5:16-18). 
God willing, in a few weeks most of you will leave and some of us will stay, under much more peaceful circumstances than those our neighbors and fellow university meml;>ers and armed forces have faced recently. Make a good ending this year. I say "make," not "have," because happy endings-dif­ferences resolved, love expressed, forgiveness received, gratitude articulated-must be intention­al, especially when you have three finals and two papers and a lab and a room to pack up and a sum­mer job to find. 
It's not just going to happen on its own, especially at this time of year. As Paul would say, "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful" (Col. 3:15). And if you are sorry, or concerned, or thankful, or you love someone ... say so.

MOVIE REVIEW 

'Fracture' breaks mold for murder thrillers 
By JAMES COSTA Scene Writer 

Gore Vidal once said of Los Angeles, "It is unique in its bright horror." And after spending two hours in the the­ater watching Gregory Hoblit's "Fracture," it seems that he's right. It is a gripping film with all the twists and shocks you'd expect out of an LA cat-and-mouse murder thriller. But it's also a lot more: intelligent, witty and far more thought provok­

(Anthony Hopkins) attempts to murder his wife Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz). After the cops surround his home, he surrenders peacefully and acts extremely cooperative. He even gives the arresting officers the mur­der weapon. (Don't worry; I'm not giv­ing anything away. You can see all this in the preview.) Yet from here, everything starts to get confusing. A rising star out of the District Attorney's office, Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) takes on the case just before he's set to change jobs and join a major LA law firm. The film hits its stride once Beachum and Crawford meet and develop an intense rivalry of mind and cunning, a tension that runs through the rest of the film. 
It is clear that Gregory Hoblit con­structs his film in a genre he has been successful in; the comfort shows. After directing films like "Primal Fear" and "Hart's War," Hoblit again tackles the courtroom drama. However, he does not focus entirely on the courtroom. Rather, he takes the viewer on a journey through the mind of Beachum as he attempts to maneuver his own success and future -as well as the District Attorney's 
office -on the axle

a good and a bad 
thing. It is good 
because it ensures that the film cannot be considered just another "Silence of the Lambs," which became famous for the magic between Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter and Jodie Foster as a new FBI agent in the original film. The downside, however, is that the Hopkins and Gosling do share strong scene chem­istry. When they're together, it truly is riveting stuff. 
The film is very stylish and slick in its production, a bit like the recent "Breach," which starred Ryan Phillippe as a fledgling FBI nmployee trying to bring down a major spy within the Bureau. However, the film does not deserve classification as sim­ply "smooth" or "stylish." Sure, it's full of gorgeous camera angles and superb lighting effects, but the movie also addresses serious societal issues in a clever and thoughtful manner. Hather brilliantly, the film juxtaposes the relaxed acting style of Gosling to the rigid and old school style of Hopkins to magnificent effect. While it always seems like Hopkins is perform­ing, the viewer gets the impression that Gosling is mostly being himself. 
Not merely thriller, the intelligent aspect of the film is its treatment of Gosling and his career desires and decisions. Quite applicable to seniors about the graduate and preparing for the real world, the film places Gosling in a situation -in which the choice of to do right or to do wrong is incredibly important. It is not merely his reputa­tion at stake. Rather, it is the reputa­tion of the DA's office and the freedom of Hopkins sitting across the table at the defendant's desk. We witness Gosling undertake a journey that accentuates both the strongest moral rights and the darkest moral wrongs. Where does he come out on the moral scale? I can't tell you, but it's worth a watch to find out.

DVD REVIEW 
'Kingdom of Heaven' rights its course on DVD 
By RAMA GOTTUMl[KKALA Senior Scene Writer 

"The Path to Redemption" is an apt title for the centerpiece of the four-disc director's cut DVD of "Kingdom of Heaven." Boasting a two-hour, 24-minute runtime, the robust documentary is a compelling and lavish look behind the scenes at one of the most intriguing Hollywood failures in recent years. 
The 2005 film was supposed to be direc­tor Ridley Scott's medieval age opus, an ode to noble knights and valiant crusades. On paper, it certainly looked the part. But somewhere along the way, the fihn became hopelessly lost. It was greeted by jeers from critics and apathy from the same audiences that exalted "Gladiator," Scott's Oscar-win­ning Roman epic. Budgeted at $130 million, "Heaven" was razed at the box office, end­ing its theatrical run with a paltry domestic gross of $4 7 million. 

Fortunately, the story didn't end there. In an industry where failure is rarely forgiven, the movie's re-release as a 194-minute cut is an uncommon boon. The new additions, totaling 50 minutes, reveal a vastly different film -the version Scott always intended but never got the chance to show us. 
Where the theatrical cut played like a simple-minded and bombastic rock con­cert, the director's cut feels like a nuanced concerto. Aided by much stronger charac­ter development and clearer motivations, its visual majesty is now matched by a soulful message of tolerance that distances it from the vapidity of other blockbusters, a description that surely haunted Scott and his crew following the film's theatrical ruin. 
Spread over the first two discs, "Kingdom of Heaven" is granted a beautiful video transfer and a roaring soundtrack. Each pristine frame reflects cinematographer John Mathieson's gorgeous photography, which fits a movie that is easily one of the best-looking efforts of Scott's acdaimed career. 
Once again, the special features on this DVD reaffirm Hidley Scott as one of the medium's great enthusiasts. Like Peter Jackson, David Fincher and Robert Rodriguez, Scott is that rare filmmaker who loves to pack his DVDs with comprehensive documentaries, informative commentaries and invaluable peeks at moviemaking magic, a trend that continues here. 

The copious bonus material includes cast rehearsals, storyboards, trailers, deleted scenes and three commentaries with various members of the cast and crew. The best of the trio is easily the first, featuring Scott, writer William Monahan (who won an Academy Award for "The Departed," but was skewered for this script, his frrst) and star Orlando Bloom. All three are separate, but their comments are combined to form one of the most revealing and consistently entertaining tracks in recent memory. 
But the creme of the crop. of this release is "Path to Redemption," a superb and insight­ful piece that charts the film's progression from conception to production to release. Nearly every major member of the cast and crew takes the time to contribute reflections on the movie's formation. There is a genuine love and affection for the projeet in these interviews, which adds greatly to their appeal. 
There were many reasons bandied around for the theatrical demise of "Kingdom of Heaven." Among these were nagging Fox executives who hoped to short­en the story to what they saw as a lean two­hour action-adventure romp. But in doing so they excised much of the film's raw beauty. 
Thankfully, the once-wayward "Heaven" is redeemed with this release. Using the alchemic power of the DVD medium, Scott succeeds in restoring the luster to his tar­nished gem.

Tragedy of 1The Queen' truly fit for royalty

sc=&SRnI 
O'Donnell's ABC absence will be a sight to behold 
She also got into heaps oftrouble for what is now referred to as the "Ching-Chong" controversy. On Dec. 5, Rosie made a com­ment in reference to the large amounts pf publicity that "The View" received for Danny DeVito's hung-over appearance after a night oftaking shots with George Clooney. She joked that the event was being talked about asJar away as China and said, "You know, you can in China it's like, 'Ching­chong, ching-chong. Danny DeVito. Ching­chong, ching-chong-chong. Drunk. The View. Ching Chong."' The remarks set off a media firestorm and Rosie subsequently apologized for her tasteless humor. 
At least she apologized that time. 
My favorite celebrity moments tend to be when stars feign knowing about things that they clearly don't understand. Tom Cruise popularized this antic when he informed Matt Lauer how much he really "knows" about the history of psychiatry and psychi­atric treatments. Rosie embarked on a simi­lar crusade during the March 28 episode of "The View" when she promoted her con­spiracy theories regarding 9/11. During her rant she claimed to have a complete under­standing of physics and explained that it was "impossible for [World Trade Center 7] to fall the way it fell without explosives being involved." She concluded, "Miraculously, [for] the first time in history, steel was melted by fire." The magazine "Popular Mechanics" published a point-by­point response debunking each of Rosie's claims.

Princess Diana's death was a key moment in British history. It shook the foundations of the social hierarchy and threatened the monarchy in a way that . few events before or since have rivaled. Stephen Frears' "The Queen" recon­structs the event in a meaningful and insightful way -the director creates a film that is about a family more than an event, while simultaneously producing what was easily one of the best perform­ances of 2006. 
"The Queen" follows the royal family, led by Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren), as it copes with the tragic death of Diana. The 

Yesterday on "The View," Rosie O'Donnell announced that she and ABC were unable to reach a contract agreement, so she will be leaving the show this June. During the show, creator Barbara Walters remarked that they "have had, to say the least, an interesting year." 
That barely even begins to sum up the number ofcontrover­sies that Rosie started during her brief tenure. 
Most notably was the long-standing feud between her and The Donald. When Trump said he was allowing the luscious Tara Conner to retain her crown as Miss USA, Rosie started a tirade on "The View" that declared him unfit to be the moral compass of today's youth. Not one to just roll over and take a heaping spoonful ofslander, The Donald responded by calling her ugly­among other things. Over the last four months, the two continued to hurl insults at each other, culminating this Monday when, while hosting the Matrix Awards (given to the most accomplished women in media), Rosie concluded a rant about Tnunp by grabbing her crotch and shouting, "Eat me!" 
Truly classy. 

family clings to tradition, refusing public displays of grief (like waving the flag at half-mast). This leads to declining public opinion and also causes conflict with the new prime minister, Tony Blair. Blair believes that the family has to adapt to changing times, which greatly worries Elizabeth and the rest of the royal family. 
The biggest reason to see "The Queen" is Mirren's pitch-perfect performance. Her take on Elizabeth II is at once respectful and complex, with far more nuance and emotional weight than might be expected. Like Forrest Whitaker's per­formance in 'The Last King of Scotland," Mirren's portrayal of the queen brings a historical figure to startling life. 
Unlike "The Last King," however, the rest of the film doesn't bring the key per­formance down. Frears constructed a meticulous recreation of the events lead­ing up to -and immediately following -the death of Princess Di, and his steady control and strong sense of com­position lends itself to a beautiful and complex picture. Some of the symbolism is overwrought and heavy-handed, and some people may object to the portrayal of Prime Minister Blair, but the overall presentation is quite strong. Recently, films of this sort have tended to fall into two camps: a great performance in an otherwise mediocre picture ("Ray," "The Last King of Scotland") and a delicately understated film that supports its per­formances beautifully ("Capote"). Thankfully, "The Queen" falls into the lat­ter category, and while it's not a stone­cold classic, it's much more engaging and entertaining than might be expected. 
"The Queen" is ultimately a film about willingness to adapt to changing times. Unfortunately, Miramax hasn't shown that same willingness. The DVD has fewer features than some discs more than a decade old. The picture is sharp and clear, and the sound (in Dolby Digital 
5.1) is acceptable. There is also an audio commentary track by Frears, writer Peter Morgan and British historian Robert Lacey. Informative and interest­ing, the track is easily the best feature on the disc. 
The featurette "The Making of 'The Queen"' is quite good, but several more features could have easily been added, especially since most of the key people in the film are still alive. It would have been interesting to get the perspective of mem­bers of the royal family, which means that the DVD of "The Queen" squanders its chance to be a comprehensive exami­nation pf not only the film but also its context. It's possible a better edition will someday be produced, but this version should suffice for casual fans. 
"The Queen" is an excellent picture, and its critical acclaim is well deserved. It's a shame that Miramax didn't put more effort into the DVD, since it's obvi­ous the picture was meticulously con­structed. "The Queen" comes highly rec­ommended, but fans big on extra DVD features might be better suited waiting for a more comprehensive edition.

Ifyou still aren't convinced as to her com­plete lack of intelligence and taste, then that blog should finish the job. Rosie's daily ram­blings can be read at www.rosie.com. She rarely uses complete sentences (and com­pletely disregards all possible understand­ing of the English language)-it pretty much is whatever loosely constructed thought happened to be in her mind at the time of typing. In a recent entry, she talks about an encounter with the paparazzi: "they lept at the car like i was brittney or lindsay pushing flashing yelling breaking news in america." 
It's the little things in life that we should be thankful for each day. I'm thankful that Rosie has, at least for the time being, been taken off the airwaves.

Cubs lose Prior for entire season 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO -Oft-injured Cubs pitcher Mark Prior will ntiss the entire 2007 season after surgery on his right shoulder, a setback that isn't expected to finish his once­promising career. 
The 26-year-old Prior had surgery Tuesday by noted orthopedist Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala. Andrews also worked on Prior's rotator cuff. 
"Obviously, Mark is done for the year," Chicago general manager Jim Hendry said. "From my conversations with (trainer) Mark O'Neal and John Boggs, Mark's agent who talked to Dr. Andrews last 
IN BRIEF 

Stewart unhappy with NASCAR debris cautions 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -Two-time champion Tony Stewart likened NASCAR to professional wrestling and accused it of using bogus caution flags to shape races in biting comments made on his weekly radio show. 
Stewart's appearance on his Tuesday night show was his first since skipping a post-race press conference in Phoenix. He dominated Saturday night's race but lost after a late exchange of leads with winner Jeff Gordon. Stewart said he refused interviews to avoid bashing NASCAR after officials threw four cau­tions for debris on the track. 
"It's like playing God," he said on his Sirius Satellite Radio program. "They can almost dictate the race instead of the drivers doing it. It's happened too many times this year." 
Stewart, who said he was fighting a fever and left the two-hour show early, went on to say fans are complaining about debris cautions and NASCAR isn't listening. 
night, Dr. Andrews feels com­fortable that he will still have a career. This is certainly not career-ending." 
"He felt optimistic that he would be able to pitch next year.... At his age, he should not have a problem respond­ing and coming back after a strenuous rehab." 
Hendry said it was way too early to set a timetable for Prior's return or discuss what it means for Prior's future with the Cubs. Prior started his rehabilitation program Wednesday, and it will contin­ue into the offseason. 
Prior has been beset by injuries since his first full sea­son in the majors in 2003. He made just nine starts last year 
Rutgers gives Stringer seven­year contract extension 
PISCATAWAY, N.J. -Rutgers women's basketball coach C. Vivian Stringer will be paid the same base salary as football coach Greg Schiano under a seven-year contract extension announced Wednesday. 
Stringer will earn $450,000 in base pay and could earn up to $500,000 in additional compensation under terms of the agreement, Rutgers said. Schiano signed an extension in February with $450,000 in base pay but a total com­pensation package worth $1.5 million per year. 
The 59-year-old Stringer had one year left on her existing contract. 
This past season, Stringer made a total of $605,800, which included $212,400 in base pay and bonuses of $115,400 for leading the Scarlet Knights to the national title game, where they lost 59-46 to Tennessee. 
The new deal will make her one of the five highest paid women's college bas­ketball coaches in the country. 
for the Cubs after three trips to the disabled list. 
Prior was not on the Cubs' active roster to start this year and was optioned to Triple-A Iowa after limited innings in spring training. He instead went on the minor league dis­abled list. 
At extended spring training in Arizona, he pitched only two innings on April 12 before reporting discomfort in his shoulder. 
"Obviously he had some things wrong physically and he's getting them corrected," Cubs manager Lou Piniella said before Wednesday's game against Milwaukee. "So, this is a step in the right direction." 
The injury was the latest 

Rams trade fifth-round pick for Chiefs speedster Hall 
ST. LOUIS -The St. Louis Rams' long search for a return man ended Wednesday when the team acquired Dante Hall from Kansas City in exchange for a fifth-round pick in this weekend's draft. 
"We have filled a need with one of the top players in football at his spe· cialty, returning punts and kicks," Rams coach Scott Linehan said. "Dante will fit nicely on our special teams and can be utilized as a receiver in certain situations." 
The trade could have draft-day implications. The Rams had expressed strong interest in Ohio State's Ted Ginn Jr., as much for his return ability as for his resume as a receiver. St. Louis also has several needs on defense. 
As part of the trade, the teams swapped positions in the third round -the Chiefs moving up to 82nd overall, the Rams down to 84th. 
problem for the struggling team. The Cubs, who have not reached the World Series since 1945, made many major changes in the offseason yet began the day in last place in the NL Central with a 7-13 record. 
Kerry Wood, who teamed with Prior to nearly pitch the Cubs to the NL pennant in 2003, is back on the disabled list with tendinitis in his shoul­der. Uke Prior, Wood has been sidetracked by injuries . 
Hendry said Wood might resume throwing this week. Wood has not pitched since a spring training appearance on March 25 when his arm felt weak and then stiffened up the next day.

Six Austrians receive lifetime Olympic bans 
Associated Press 

BEIJING -It took more than a year to punish anyone in the doping scandal that shook the Turin Winter Olympics. When the verdicts came down Wednesday, the penalties were unprecedented. 
Six Austrian cross-country skiers and biathletes received lifetime bans from the Olympics for involvement in an organized blood-doping scheme -the harshest sanctions given to ath­letes by the International Olympic Committee. 
And the case isn't closed yet. Next month, the IOC will inves­tigate the role of Austrian coaches, officials and doctors. 
It's the first time the IOC has disqualified athletes for doping violations without positive tests, and the first time athletes have been banned by the IOC for life. Based on evidence seized in Italian police raids, the Austrians were found guilty of possessing prohibited sub­stances and taking part in a doping conspiracy. 
"It is a milestone," IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said. 
The results of the Austrian athletes from the 2006 Games were annulled, although none won medals. 
Those banned were cross­country skiers Martin Tauber, Juergen Pinter, Johannes Eder and Roland Diethart, and biath­letes Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann. The six are ineligible for accreditation in any capacity at the Olympics ­as athletes, coaches or officials. 
"The severity of the sanctions is motivated by the fact that these cases go further than straightforward possession of prohibited substances and methods and are clear instances where a network, including athletes, colluded to manipulate blood and to engage into doping practices," the IOC said. 
The IOC action applies only to Olympic competition. It would be up to the Austrian and inter­national ski federations to sus­pend the athletes from non­Olympic events. 
IOC vice president Thomas Bach, a German lawyer who led the internal investigation, said the probe will continue with hearings for non-athletes next month. He did not identify them. The IOC can also ban coaches and other accredited 
team  personnel  from  the  
Olympics.  
Also  Wednesday,  the  IOC  

executive board endorsed presi­dent Jacques Rogge's proposal for a Youth Olympics starting in 2010 for athletes aged 14-18, and reiterated that the IOC won't pressure China on human rights or other political issues ahead of the 2008 Beijing Games. The three cities vying for the 2014 Winter Games -Pyeongchang, South Korea; Salzburg, Austria; and Sochi, Russia -made public presen­tations with less than three months before the IOC vote. 
Italian police raided Austrian team lodgings outside Turin on Feb. 18, 2006. The move fol­lowed a tip that former Austrian coach Walter Mayer, who was implicated in a blood-doping case at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games and banned from the Turin Olympics, was in the area. 

Mayer fled after the raid. lie crashed his car into a police roadblock after crossing into Austria, ending up briefly in a psychiatric hospital. 
In tandem with the police action, Olympic drug-testers conducted surprise doping cheeks on 10 Austrian athletes. The tests came back negative, but the IOC said it would contin­ue its investigation based on the police findings. 
The IOC received the report from Italian investigators this year, and a three-man discipli­nary panel held two days of hearings on the case this month in Lausanne, Switzerland. All the Austrian athletes who were asked to appear deelined. 
The Italian police report, as quoted by the IOC, detailed a stunning array of doping prod­ucts, methods and equipment. Police found syringes, needles, blood bags, butterfly valves for intravenous use, bottles of saline and devices for measur­ing hemoglobin levels and determining blood groups, as well as the banned substances hCG and albumin. 
The police report said one athlete, Rottmann, even threw a plastic bag out his window dur­ing the raid that contained illicit materials. 
"What is remarkable is that all this material was in posses­sion of the athletes," Bach said.

NBA 
Pacers coach Carlisle fired after four seasons 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Now that coach Rick Carlisle is out as the coach of the Indiana Pacers, the team needs to figure out what is next. 
Carlisle was fired Wednesday after four tumultuous years lead­ing the Pacers, after a season in which the team failed to make the playoffs for the first time in a decade. 
The Pacers finished the season 35-47, their worst since 1988-89. Indiana was 29-24 shortly after the All-Star break, but lost its next 11 games to fall out of the top eight in the Eastern Conference. 
Carlisle said he enjoyed coach­ing the team but understood that it was time for the Pacers to hear a "new voice." With the first major postseason move out of the way, team president Larry Bird said anything is possible ­and the new coach might have to adjust. 
"We don't know the direction," he said. "We have an idea, but if there's something out there that can be a major trade, we'll prob­ably do it if it benefits us. He's got to understand going in that we will trade any one of these players, and it might not be what he likes, but he's got to know that going in." 
"Any of these players" includes forward Jermaine O'Neal and point guard Jamaal Tinsley, the team's top commodities. O'Neal says he's not interested in being part of a rebuilding project and Tinsley could follow Ron Artest and Stephen Jackson as Indiana players traded following off-the­court offenses. 
O'Neal averaged 19.4 points, 
9.6 rebounds and 2.6 blocks in one of the best seasons of his 11­year career. He's a six-time All­Star who finished third in fan voting this year for the Pacers' 40th anniversary team. 
But O'Neal missed 13 games with various injuries and illness­es. He underwent surgery Wednesday to repair a meniscus tear in his left knee that hobbled him the last two months of the season. He has missed 82 games the past three seasons -an amount that equals an entire regular-season's worth of games. 
Tinsley had one of his best sea­sons and was more durable than usual. He averaged 12.8 points and 6.9 assists in 72 games, the most games he's played since 2002-03. 
But Tinsley's off-the-court problems include a felony charge he faces from a February bar fight in Indianapolis. He also was present in October at a fight out­side a strip club that has Jackson facing charges for firing a gun. 
Bird's pledge to continue to crack down on such behavior puts Tinsley's status as a Pacer in jeopardy.

remember a guy whose worked harder in the past," Frank said. ''I've never seen a guy who works as hard as this guy when it comes to recruiting. He's con­stantly on the phone, he's con­stantly [text messaging] and he's staying on top of the top defen­sive players plus everybody he has within his own particular reach." 
When he first arrived, Brown had to battle the image that the 3-4 personnel system he planned to implement with the Irish was going to affect potential recruits negatively. A defensive end, Justin Trattou, went back on his verbal commitment to the Irish because of the defensive switch. 
But since then, Brown has been able to turn this image into a positive one, emphasizing the flexibility of the 3-4 system to attract recruits of different sizes and body types. 
"He had to let everybody know, 'This is my defense, this is my philosophy, and this is why things are going to change at Notre Dame.' I think he had to get that message out there," Frank said. "And the only way he was going to do that without showing them on the field . . . is to get on the phone and talk to as many of these top guys as he can and explain to them, 'Here's why we like you, and here's how we think that you can help us on defense, and here's where we envision you playing.' He's done an outstanding job of communi­cating that message and getting these top, top players interested in coming to play for him." 
Frank said he believed the four recruits Brown has nabbed so far would have had more schools coming after them if it was later in the recruiting process and other coaches had the chance to look and evaluate them. 
But regardless of who he has coming in, Brown's success in the recruiting game will hinge upon how Notre Dame's defense -a defense that finished 61 st in total yardage allowed last sea­son -progresses this season. They may not be one of the tops in the country, but if they can show significant improvement in stopping big plays, or as Brown likes to call them "explosives," and getting some "explosives" of their own, Brown and his defense could build the founda­tion for getting the Irish defense pointed in the right direction. 
Then, maybe those recruits who Brown went out of his way to see Saturday will walk with him inside the tunnel and into Notre Dame's locker room. But even if they do not decide to come to Notre Dame, it will not be because Brown failed to try hard enough to get them here.

NHL 
Sabres knock off Rangers 
Associated Press 
BUFFALO, N.Y. -Ales Kotalik and the Buffalo Sabres provided an answer to anyone questioning whether they are the elite team in the NHL. 
It's a response that came through loud and clear in a 5­2 victory over the New York Hangers in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series on Wednesday night. 
"I think we showed every­body we were ready," Kotalik said. "A lot of things were said before the game, and we made sure we showed to respond not in the paper but on the ice." 
Kotalik was referring to Rangers coach Tom Henney's comments suggesting the top­seeded Sabres weren't the league's "cream of the crop." 
"Yeah, obviously, everybody heard it," Kotalik said. "We talked about it. It's a good thing." 
Thomas Vanek scored twice and Kotalik once during a three-goal second-period that broke open a scoreless game and put the Sabres in control. 
It was a vintage outburst ­Buffalo scored three times on four shots in a 4:05 span ­for a potent Sabres team that scored a league-leading 308 goals in the regular season. And it erased whatever linger­ing memories the Sabres had after they were inconsistent in dispatching the New York Islanders in five games in the first round. 
"When we finally got that first one past (goalie Henrik Lundqvist), it was, 'All right,'" Sabres co-captain Daniel Briere said. "For us, it gave us confidence and we just kept attacking." 
The five goals were the most the Sabres have scored this postseason and we.re one short of the total the Rangers allowed in a four-game, first­round series sweep of Southeast Division champion Atlanta. 
Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is Friday at Buffalo. 
Jason Pominville and Drew Stafford, with an empty-net goal, also scored for the Sabres. 
Marcel Rossa and Brendan Shanahan scored third-period goals for New York, which never got closer than two goals in the final 20 minutes. 
"Mentally, we weren't as sharp as we needed to be, and not as sharp as we'll be next game," Shanahan said. "I don't know if they outplayed us, but they outperformed us." 
The Rangers went 1-for-5 in power-play chances, but failed to score during a 2-minute, two-man advantage early in the third period. 
"We haven't played in a while and it really showed," Renney said, noting the Rangers played their first game in a week. 
Rust wasn't the only prob­lem. New York had difficulty keeping up with the Sabres' depth and speed. 
That was apparent when the Sabres finally got one past Lundqvist, who was otherwise sharp in stopping the first 23 shots he faced. 
Vanek opened the scoring 14 minutes into the second peri­od with a power-play goal. Parked in front and a step ahead of defender Daniel Girardi, Vanek was in perfect position to deflect in Dmitri Kalinin's shot from inside the blue line. 
Buffalo's fourth line struck for the next goal when Kotalik, set up by Adam Mair's pass, split two defenders and 
snapped a shot from the right 
circle that beat Lundqvist high 
on the far side. 
Vanek capped the surge 
when he got by Karel 
Rachunek at the Rangers' blue 
line, drove in and around Paul 
Mara, and scored on a 
defenseless Lundqvist. 
"We've been known when 
we can get a couple of quick 
ones, we can get the third one 
fairly soon after that," Sabres 
coach Lindy Ruff said. "We 
said, 'Let's keep attacking.' 
That looked a lot like the team 
that played most of the year." 
Ryan Miller stopped 32 
shots, having his shutout bid 
foiled when Rossa beat him 
with a one-timer with 9:16 
left, briefly cutting Buffalo's 
lead to 3-1. 
Miller's best save came a 
few minutes earlier during the 
Rangers' two-man advantage, 
when he snagged Shanahan's 
shot despite being screened by 
New York's Sean Avery. 
"We have the utmost respect 
for our opponent," Renney 
said. "We'll be well-organized 
and well-prepared." 
The Rangers welcomed back 
Rachunek, who had missed 16 
games with a sprained right 
knee. But New York then lost 
Michal Rozsival, the Rangers 
top offensive defenseman, 
who didn't return after hurt­
ing his leg early in the second 
period. 
+ Notes: Renney listed Rozsival as day to day.... The 
·Sabres have won five consecu­tive series-openers, dating to last year. That is important since Buffalo is 1-13 when los­ing Game 1 of a best-of-seven series.... With Rachunek back, D Thomas Pock was scratched after having three , assists in four games against Atlanta.

Ducks upend Canucks 5-1 

AP Vancouver goalie Roberto Luongo watches a shot go past him in the third period Wednesday night. Anaheim defeated Vancouver 5-1 Wednesday in the Western Conference semifinal game one. 
Associated Press 

ANAHEIM, Calif. -Andy McDonald had his first career hat trick and assisted on another goal as the Anaheim Ducks opened their first series against the Vancouver Canucks with a 5-1 victory on Wednesday night. 
After Jeff Cowan gave Vancouver a 1-0 lead at 7:07 of the first period, the Ducks responded by scoring three times -twice by McDonald ­on their first nine shots against goalie Roberto Luongo. 
Teemu Selanne had a goal and assist during the outburst, and Chris Kunitz assisted on all three goals. 
Jean-Sebastien Giguere fin­ished with 26 saves for the Ducks. 
Ryan Getzlaf gave Anaheim a three-goal pad midway through the final period, and McDonald capped the scoring on a shot from just right of the crease when the Ducks had a two-man advantage with 52 seconds remaining. 
"It's pretty exciting," McDonald said of his first hat trick, playoff or otherwise. "It's just nice to be able to con­tribute. The first game is always tough in the series. I am pretty fortunate to be able to play with such great play­ers." 
With the first multi-goal playoff game of his career, McDonald tied the Ducks' record for most points in a postseason contest and became the second player to have a hat trick. Jaffrey Lupul had a four-goal game last May against Colorado in Game 3 of the conference semifinals. 
The second game of this series is Friday night in Anaheim before the best-of­seven Western Conference semifinal series shifts to Vancouver for games Sunday and Tuesday. 
Luongo faced 31 shots as the Ducks kept the pressure on by crowding in front of the Vancouver goal. He was replaced by Dany Sabourin after Getzlaf's goal, and Sabourin faced six shots and gave up McDonald's third goal. 
"He's a great goaltender," McDonald said of Luongo. "We had to have a good night. We moved the puck around and used our speed." 
After starting the game rela­tively slowly and with the Canucks on the attack for the first few minutes, the Ducks quickly shook off the rust. 
Anaheim hadn't played since wrapping up the opening series against Minnesota last Thursday. The Canucks didn't really get a day ofT. They had taken a :~-1 lead in the series against Dallas, but lost the next two before finally con­cluding the series with a Game 7 win on Monday night. Tuesday was a travel day. 
Notching the first multi-goal and four-point game of his playoff career, McDonald scored his second goal of the night to give the Ducks a 3-1 lead at 19:11 of the opening period. 
On a 2-on-1 rush, Selanne skated down the right side, waited for the defender to commit toward him, then slid the puck across to McDonald. The Ducks' center beat Luongo with a shot between the pads. 
Pitch

"I just focused on working really hard and trying to become one of the best." Notre Dame was Bargar's last scheduled college visit, and it made the biggest impact on the high school star. 
"I loved all the girls here and fit in well with them," Bargar said. "I couldn't pass up an opportunity like Notre Dame, it's an amazing place." 
Bargar was a key addition to the Irish pitching staff in 2006, pitching second in the rotation and finishing with a 15-9 record. Bargar was named to the Big East honor roll that season and had an ERA of 
2.92. Highlighting her rookie season was an eight-inning no-hitter against Big East rival Connecticut in April 2006, the first in Irish history. 
Assuming her role as the ace of the pitching staff this sea­son, Bargar has continued to elevate her performance and succeed. A power pitcher who has always been able to rely on her velocity, Bargar has

second baseman Maureen Healy said. "We're eager to put into play whatwe've been practicing." 
The Belles and the Flying Dutch are evenly matched, but Saint Mary's has some slight advantages. While Hope junior Jessica Regnerua is hitting .540 in 87 at bats, the Belles (.353) top Hope (.326) for team batting aver­age in the league and have a solid and consistent hitter in freshman outfielder Ashley Peterson, who is hitting .430 in 86 at bats. 
The Belles also have a stronger pitching lineup than the Dutch. Saint Mary's soph­omores Kristin Amram and Calli Davison combine for a 
2.35 ERA, which is second in the league. The Dutch are third in the league with a 
2.38 ERA. 
Both teams' best pitchers have winning records: Amram (1.06 ERA) is 8-4, while Dutch freshman pitcher Deidra Enochs (2.00 ERA) is 8-5. Amram and Davison have held their opponents to low batting averages -125 become more effective this season by adding more pitches to her arsenal. 
"I've learned a couple new pitches that have made me successful this year, including a drop and a changeup," Bargar said. "As well as physi­cally, I've developed mentally and become much more men­tally tough." 
Bargar leads Notre Dame and the Big East with 16 wins and 176 innings pitched and is second in the conference with 174 strikeouts. She has pitched 19 complete games for the Irish, all while holding opponents to a .233 batting average. 
Although only a sophomore, Bargar has evolved into a leader ori Notre Dame. 
"As a pitcher, we set the tone of the game," Bargar said. "I have to come out from the first inning on and have a positive start and lead by example." 
Bargar will start for the third-place Irish in a crucial doubleheader Sunday against Big East leader No. 17 DePaul.

and .260, respectively. Opponents bat an equally low .250 against Enochs. 
Healy said execution of play will be the edge the Belles have against Hope. 
"Doing the little things like stringing hits together and not leaving runners on base !will give the Belles the advantage)." she said. "Hopefully luck will be on our side too." 
The Belles will look to slug­gers senior Sarah Miesle, sophomore catcher Ashley Fusaro and Peterson to widen the gap between the Belles and Dutch similar offenses. Miesle is second in the league with 33 runs and third with 32 runs batted in. Fusaro is second in the league with seven homeruns and fifth for runs batted in (29). 
The Belles hope to ride momentum from sweeping the last three teams they've faced-Goshen, Olivet and Albion. 
"We're going to continue what we've been doing the last three games and win every inning," Healy said. 
The Belles will take on Hope today at 3:30 p.m.

Soon after he arrived last fall, a freshman just months removed from batting .462 his senior season at Regional Hebron Andover and Marlborough (RHAM) High School in Hebron, Conn., Pollock was sure he would be in the Notre Dame starting lineup come spring. 
"I wanted to win a spot, and after the first couple weeks I knew I could play with anybody," he said.

coach and teammates rushed out to help Bargar, she calmly jumped back up into the pitch­ing circle and faced the next batter. 
Pitching runs deep in the veins of the Bargar family ­Brittney's father Lance played baseball and pitched on the collegiate level as well. 
"I started playing softball because of my dad," Bargar said. "lie would always tell me stories about his games, and it made me interested." 
Bargar picked up sof'tball at age eight, at first playing with her father and then joining a recreational league. She showed talent on the rubber from an early age and made an immediate impact as a freshman at Corona High School in California. Named team co-MVP as a freshman, Bargar was an integral part of a very successful Corona team. 
"My high school career was amazing," Bargar said. "We were very talented, and I got to play with a bunch of girls I loved and became best friends with." 
The Corona team and Bargar had their best season in 2005, in her senior season. Ranked as high as third nationally, Corona reached the finals of the California Interscholastic Federation tournament. As a senior Bargar garnered sever­al individual awards, including Riverside County player of the year. For her high school career, Bargar posted a sparkling ERA of 0.39, and tal­lied a 66-18 record. 
Despite Bargar's dominance in high school, the hurler said she hardly thought about her future in softball until scholar­ship offers started coming in. 
"I didn't really realize what my future held," Bargar said.

Brown works hard for nevv defensive recruits 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Editor 
A<> the rest of the Irish made their way into the tunnel after Saturday's Blue-Gold game, defensive coordinator Corwin Brown decided he would take a little detour on his way to the locker room. 
Brown cut through the slowly moving herd of blue and white jerseys, and the significantly less intimidating mass of reporters gathered outside the tunnel, to say "hello" to a few people -the potential recruits at Saturday's intra-squad game. 
Brown has been hard at work this spring getting the word out to prospects that he is building Notre Dame's defense into a national force. 
And so far, Brown's hard 

work on the recruiting scene has yielded success. 
At this point last season under former defensive coordi­nator (and resident scapegoat) Rick Minter, the Irish had no recruits that verbally commit­ted on the defensive side of the ball. 
This season under Brown, four defensive prospects ­defensive tackle Sean -Cwynar, defensive end Darius Fleming, and linebackers· Anthony MacDonald and David Posluszny have said they plan to attend Notre Dame for the class of 2012.
