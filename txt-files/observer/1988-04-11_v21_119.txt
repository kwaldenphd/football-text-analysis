Hijackers 
Associated Press 
LARNACA, Cyprus--The hijackers of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet offered to trade passengers for fuel Sunday and threatened to crash the aircraft into Kuwait's royal palace. They also warned of a "slow and quiet massacre" of their hostages if their demands were not met. 
A flight engineer said the hijackers, who are demanding the release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists imprisoned in

Kuwait, had started to hurt one of the passengers. 
It is believed there are still 53 people aboard the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747, including three members of Kuwait's ruling Al-Sabah family and at least six hijackers. 
In Lebanon, a pro-Iranian group threatened to kill kid­napped American and French hostages if any attempt was made to storm the plane.

Input plan ready to go 
By MARK MCLAUGHLIN News Editor 
A plan for student govern­ment to gather student response to the recently released task force reports was discussed in a special meeting on Friday. Student Body President Tom Doyle asked for support from the newly elected Hall Presidents' Council, dis­trict student senators, and class presidents. 
He said the role of student government concerning the reports was "to stand up for the rights and the interests of students. Student government is where those types of issues are addressed." 
The plan was split into three parts, said Mike Paese, student body vice president. Paese said "The focus of this entire effort is going to be in two areas -­
that every student should have the opportunity to express themselves both orally and in written form." 
The first part of the plan pro­posed a series of hall meetings. The hall president, the district 


Lopez named new ND leprechaun 
By REGIS COCCIA News Editor 
The Fighting Irish have a new leprechaun. 
Ray Lopez, a junior from Alice, Texas, won a close two­day competition Saturday to become Notre Dame's 1988-89 mascot. 
Next year's cheerleaders were also announced Saturday. 
"We had a really tight race going--it was so close," Lopez said. "It's a great feeling. I put a lot of time and effort into it. I have a lot of people to thank. My friends really came through for me and my family was backing me the whole way," he said. 
"It's going to be a challenge. 
There's something special in what (the leprechaun) represents and I hope I can ex­emplify that." 
The competition was rated by 10 judges from the Universal Cheerleading Association, the Notre Dame Athletic Depart­ment and past cheerleading squads, said current leprec­haun Brian Stark. 
Competitors were required to perform the Irish jig, gym­nastic stunts, an improvisa­tional entertainment routine, and an original skit. Judges also interviewed each compet­itor. 
Lopez said he acted out a skit with the help of his friends in which he taped a rainbow across the gym in the Joyce ACC and danced his way to a pot of gold at one end, from which he pulled a national championship banner. 
For his 40-second improvisa­tional routine, Lopez said he spun a basketball on a pencil and break-danced to Elvis Presley's tune, "Jailhouse Rock." 
Lopez will officially assume the duties of leprechaun at the Blue-Gold football game in about two weeks, said Stark. "I'll meet with (Lopez) and pass some of the traditions, such as the shillelagh and some of the other secret things that go from leprechaun to leprec­haun," Stark said. 
Margo Ball will captain the women's cheerleading team that will include returnees Sinead Rigney, a junior, soph­omore Kristin Komyatte and new members Claudia Limardo, Michelle Paraiso and Keilleen Phelan. Kathleen Kel­ley will serve as alternate. 

The men's squad is captained by junior John Romney and in­cludes returnee Geoff Kohles and new members Fred Ac­hecar, Nick Farmer, Don Gomez and Todd Parker. Bren­dan Teehan is alternate. 
The cheerleaders and leprec­haun will hold daily practices to prepare for the upcoming Blue-Gold game, said Gomez. Before the fall semester begins, the squads will have a week ofpractice and attend a weeklong cheerleading camp. 
student senator, an invited memberofeachtaskforce,and an invited member of the ad­ministration would be at each hall meeting. Minutes from each meeting would be com­piled and sent to University President Father Edward Mal­loy, said Paese. 
"If the hall presidents, num­ber one, can't get a turnout in their hall, and number two, can't effectively facilitate the discussion, then we have failed from the outset," said Paese. 
The second part of the plan was a student survey on the task force reports. "We're going to have a questionnaire which is sent out to every stu­dent at the University .... These will eventually be com­piled, summarized, and put into a report," said Paese. This report would also be sent to Malloy, he added. 
The plan also proposed that "the most clear and relevant responses will be put into The Observer in space that student government will buy," said

Little Leaguer's catch makes playing worth it

I guess most parents feel that way. 
Our league had real live kid pitchers that were expected to come somewhere near the strike zone. They didn't. I got hit once and that was all it took to rid me of any desire to play the game. 
Most of the time I stood out in right field in the daisy patches, staring up at the sky or at the bumblebees. I was in the 'B' league for lesser players ('B' is for Bad, the A-leaguers said), and so I didn't see too many balls hit my way. Pretty boring. 
The game has changed a lot since I sat through it. My little brother is in Little League now, and enjoys it immensely when he's not out skateboarding or causing trouble. 
They don't have 'A' leagues and 'B' leagues anymore. Everyone gets to play, by league rule. Kids still pitch, but they pitch only three innings a game and only six innings a week. 
The Pioneer league, for younger kids, is even better. Kids don't pitch at all, coaches toss up sl~w pitches over the plate. No score is kept in prodigies into hating baseball.

Cracks form down middle of Student Center 
By JIM WINKLER Staff Reporter 
The cracks in the walls and floor in LaFortune Student Center are the result of compli­cations during renovations last year and present no danger to the people who use the building, said Don Dedrick, director of Notre Dame's Physical Plant. 
The problem in LaFortune occurred along the area where the new addition to the building was joined to the existing struc­ture. On the third floor, the damage is most visible, as many floor tiles are cracked and a gap has opened along the base of the wall. The floor in the new section is slightly higher than the floor in the old part. 
Dedrick said the cracks came about because water soaked into the cement while the extension was roofless during its construction last year. This made it difficult for the cement from the new build­ing to settle evenly with that of the existing part. As the ce­ment dried out, the cracks developed, Dedrick said. 

"It is difficult to build a structure on to an existing piece as old as LaFortune," he said, adding "You usually leave a little space between the old and the new parts so that it can expand." 
The repair work for LaFor­tune will be handled by Notre Dame and will be paid for by the University, Dedrick said. The company that handled the LaFortune renovations, Wright Construction Company, is not liable or responsible for the damage, he added. 
Work to repair these cracks will begin after school has finished for the year, Dedrick said. "It's not really a big prob­lem, and so there is no reason to disturb the students by doing work now," Dedrick said. The cost of the repairs has not been finalized, but it will not be that expensive, Dedrick said. 
Exactly how the building will be repaired has not yet been determined. According to Dedrick, one option is to fill the cracks and repai ntthe walls, while putting new tiles down on 


Campus construction projects running on schedule 
By JIM WINKLER Staff Reporter 
All three of the current con­struction projects on campus are on or ahead of schedule, ac­cording to Don Dedrick, direc­tor of Notre Dame's Physical Plant. 
Both of the new dorms will open as scheduled this August, Dedrick said. Siegfried Hall, next to Pasquerilla West, is two-thirds complete. Accor­ding to Dedrick, the exterior is all but finished, and the top two floors are "essentially com­plete." Knott Hall is not as far along as Siegfried, but will be finished in time to house stu­dents next fall. 

These new dorms will house women, both freshmen and transfers from other dorms. According to Dedrick, the dorms have been modeled after the neighboring Paasquerillas. Each dorm will be air­conditioned, and will consist of three living floors and a ground floor of social space. 
Dedrick said that the dorms will each consist of two wings on each floor. "This will divide each floor into two sections, each with its own lounge, bath­room, and showers," Dedrick said. In addition, there will be lounge space on each . floor where the two wings ineet.

the floor. Brother Francis Gorch, the building manager in LaFortune, said that another option would be to sand down the floor, eliminating the slight differential between the old and new parts. Carpeting would then be put down on the third floor. The second floor of LaFortune is already fully car­peted. 
Several other buildings on campus have already or are currently receiving additions, but Dedrick discounted the likelihood of similar damage occuring. "It is possible in the Law School, but it will be to a lesser extent. It is always a pos­sibility when you add onto an old building," Dedrick said. 

Cracks in the walls and floor of LaFortune Student Center have appeared recently along the area where the new addition was added about two years ago. 
That is also the location of the 
elevator. 
On the front of North Dining Hall, Dedrick said, two add­tions to dining areas are under construction. Each of these will be hi-level and will be "full of sunlight" Dedrick said. 
"On the east side of these ad­ditions, there will be alot of glass, and the west side will be open also," Dedrick said. Stu­dents will have the option of dining on either level, Dedrick said. 
In addition to adding dining space, the renovation team is modernizing the serving ca­pacities. In each dining room, a scramble area similar to what exists in South Dining Hall will be constructed. 
"We have to strip everything from the serving areas because it was obsolete. We also had to improve the air systems, electric aJ work, and plumb­ing," Dedrick said. 
As the weather continues to improve, Dedrick said, work will rapidly increase. "As soon as the ground dries out, we can put in the curbs and walkways,'' Dedrick said. The only problem that was encoun­
problems with delivery, but the 
exterior is done now." 
The work at North Dining Hall is presently ahead of schedule, said Dedrick. "All of the work will be done by Octo­ber, but we anticipate that two of the three serving areas and all of the dining areas will be completed by next fall," Dedrick said. 
The renovations at North are extensive, according to Dedrick. "Much of the building and its equipment was ob­solete, and had to be replaced. in addition, we are adding to the existing structure in four different places," said Dedrick. 
On the north and south sides of the building, special dining areas are being added. These will open into the existing rooms on each end and will have wood floors and a fireplace. 
"We hope they will be good party spaces for dorms or sec­tions or clubs," Dedrick said. 
The newest construction un­dertaking is an extension proj­ect for Nieuwland Science Hall. A three-story and basement ad­dition will be operational by

Dedrick said that the renova­tion would serve to upgrade the facilities for the physics depar­tment and the College of Sci­ence. The basement will house the University's administra­tive computer system. The sys­tem is presently split between the library and the Administra­tion Building. 
According to Dedrick, the first floor will house rooms for physics classes. On the two floors above, the renovations will include offices and labs. Dedrick said that this will allow the space now occupied by clas­srooms and offices to be used for research. 
The extension will not bear the name of any donor or ben­efactor, according to Dedrick. "The source for the funds is in­ternal," Dedrick said. 
The extension to Nieuwland will run paralJel to the existing building, and will not interfere at all with the Clarke War Memorial, according to Dedrick. Also, the cornerstone monument that com­memorates the old Notre Dame fieldhouse will not be moved. 
The only existing facility af­fected by the renovation is the road from the library to the back of LaFortune Student 
Center

A timetable for the plan was not presented, but Paese said he would like to see hall meetings start "seven to 10 days after the students receive the reports." Paese also said that An Tostal and the ap­proach of finals made it urgent to gather student input. 
Megan Hanley, president of Pasquerilla West, expressed skepticism about student response to the task force reports. "I know the average student in my hall won't be reading these reports," said Hanley. Paese disagreed, saying "at a university, I think we should expect everyone to have read the reports." 
Some student government members were unsure that stu­dents really were being given input to the administration's decision process. "How much is our input actually affecting the decision making?" asked Hanley. 
"I seriously question whe­
ther they nne aamrn1strat1onJ 
take us seriously because of the 
timing of the report," said 
Scott Miller, co-president of 
Grace Hall. "They didn't give 
us enough time to respond. I 
have a feeling that they know 
that. 
Miller also added that he felt 
the administration was making 
decisions about the task force 
recommendations over the 
summer purposely to exclude students from influencing those decisions. 

Others said they had more faith in the administration's desire for student input. Doyle said that in a previous meeting with Malloy, that he "was in­terested in getting student response." He also said that, if the administration did not want student response, it would have released the reports over the summer. 
"I believe that the absolute worst message we cound send is a silent message," said Doyle. Paese said that the num­ber of students named to the task force committees showed the administration's commit­ment to student input. 
Melissa Smith, student gov­ernment coordinator for the task force response, said that questions about student input were "why we're attempting this huge undertaking.... With this we can say 'the entire student body feels this way,' and that's why were trying to 
tap  every  single  student  on  
campus."  
Doyle  said  the  task  force  

. re rts would "affect student 
life probably as much as anyth­ing we'll see while we're here at Notre Dame." Doyle likened the situation to a simple equation. "It's the Notre Dame task force reports plus the stu­dent response, and what that will end up equalling is ul­timately the administrations' decisions."

t l

gues CO umn of the reports displays anything more The real question is not what can be 
done to improve teaching. The real 
question is "How can Notre Dame 
move to the forefront of higher educa­
tion in America?" We are cheating our­
selves and future members of this com­
munity by not coming to grips with this vital question. 
With the new fundraising campaign, we have the potential to make a major move in the desired direction. By set­ting our sights so low, we are squan­dering what may be a unique opportu­nity that will never happen again. 
So, after much careful reflection, I have come up with my own recommen­dations that come to grips with the real issues: 
First, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College cannot afford our present sit­uation indefinitely. Our present "en­gagement" status cannot continue to serve the best interests of this commu­nity. I believe a merger is not only in­evitable but necessary. Such a move would open tremendous opportunities for the University and is also in the long-term interests of Saint Mary's. The number of all-female colleges in the United States is dwindling yearly. It is doubtful whether Saint Mary's could survive without the present ar­rangement with Notre Dame. It is fur­ther doubtful whether Sa:int Mary's can survive in the future even with present cooperative ties. This remains even 

No doubt much will be said about 
these reports, and more feedback than 
Father Malloy could hope to read will 
be generated. And that is the great 
shame of it all. For, in forcing the Uni­
versity to consider the issues of "Mar­
riage, Family and Other Life commit­
ments," "Whole Health and the Use 
and Abuse of Alcohol," "The Quality of 
Teaching in a Research University," 
and "Residentiality," Fathers Malloy 
and Tyson and Provost O'Meara have 
drastically altered the quality of debate 
that is occurring at the highest echelons 
of our University. 
If the Hesburgh legacy is to mean 
anything, it is that Notre Dame should 
set its sights on as high a level as pos­
sible. These four reports deal with is­
sues, though important, that do not get 
to the heart of the issue of what it means 
to be a major Catholic university in an 
increasingly competitive and than a superficial understanding of the University or its problems. 

Maybe a year is too short to properly assess the problematic issues inherent in our present structures. More ac­curately, maybe the topics were poorly chosen. It seems to me that three aspects of Notre Dame should be ad­dressed: the educational, spiritual, and social life of the University. That the four reports inadequately cover these three areas is problematic. What we get is a hodgepodge series of recom­mendations instead of a comprehensive and integrated plan upon which to build. 
Nowhere is this more true than in the report on "Teaching in a Research Uni­versity." Such a report first assumes Notre Dame is a research university. To say so is, in my opinion, highly dubious. But moreover, all of the recommendations are just piecemeal. 
If it is truly the goal of the Notre Dame family to make this University

Britain also has executions 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to add a point of clarifica­tion to the recent letter of Michael E. Lee of April 6. 
The United Kingdom is one other NATO Alliance country that still ex­ecutes people. These executions have been perpetrated by members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland (the so-called "shoot-to-kill" policy) and, more recently, by British soldiers in Gibraltar. However repug­nant the death penalty might be, at least those executed in the United

Second, Notre Dame must increase 
the number of graduate students and 
faculty. A major university is judged 
on the quality of its graduate programs 
and on the quality of its faculty. If we 
ignore this reality, we do so at our peril. 
Since 1978, according to the task force report on teaching, the number of graduate students has increased by less than 100. An encouraging sign is that faculty size has increased by almost 100 as well since 1978. If Notre Dame wants to truly play in the big leagues, both the graduate student population and the faculty size must increase dramatically from their present num­bers. 
Third, Notre Dame must develop a comprehensive building program. This is no time for an architecture lesson, but we need a coherent Master Plan for the campus. If one exists that we are presently using, I apologize. I am just not aware of it. My own solution is to fill in Saint Joseph's Lake. One lake is enough, and besides, this would allow for living up to our legal name of " ... Notre Dame du Lac." 
These are all tongue-in-cheek recom­mendations, probably doomed to cries of outrage. So be it. The point is to raise the level of discussion above what the task forces have seen fit to say. We owe at least that much to ourselves, each other, and the future of Notre Dame.

ell, they've done it again. Steve Kilbey, Marty Willson-Piper, Peter Koppes, and Richard Ploog, just four guys from Australia, have released an album which rises above all others. Starfish is the name of this LP, the sixth from these guys who call themselves The Church. 
The neat thing about this group is that it is like no other. The haunting yet hopeful vo­cals of Steven Kilbey are ab­solutely unique and the guitars are equally impossible to em­ulate. You know how you can immediately identify a U2 song because of The Edge's guitar? Well, the same thing happens with The Church, only the guitarists are Willson-Piper and Koppes. This group has had the same lineup since 1982, and their five years of experi­ence together certainly is evi­dent on Starfish. 

The first cut, "Destination," is like a roller coaster as it dips and soars and carries the lis­tener right along. The first single is titled "Under the Milky Way," and it is typical of the album as a whole. Nearly five minutes long, the single is carried by a strong bass from Kilbey, as he sings: "I wish I knew what you were looking fmi Might I know what you would find' Under the Milky Way tonight." t1ear it once, and you'll be singing the chorus to yourself two hours later; it's that kind of song. 
The Church is truly a group of musical artists, a refreshing change from the synthesized pop stuff the music world is currently saturated with. Their lyrics are sometimes sad and always thought provoking. Kit-

Bands battle Cystic Fibrosis with music 
MATTHEW SPATZ accent writer 
T
o raise money to help fight Cystic Fibrosis, a group of students have gathered to bring The Great Escape '88 to Notre Dame. Friday from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. at Stepan Cen­ter, almost a dozen bands representing almost as many different musical styles will par­ticipate in a band jam. 
Students can purchase tick­ets for $5 at the door, and dorm representatives will also be selling tickets door-to-door. All proceeds will go to fight the Cystic Fibrosis disease. 
Sophomore Dave Temeles heads the project with a dedi­cated group of students. On the national scale, the project is called Goal Unlimited, a group which works to raise money for CF by running events like 1 2 hour dance­a-thons. The Great Escape '88 is a "spin-off of a dance-a-thon fundraiser my high school sponsored," said Temeles, whose Bishop O'Connell t1igh School in Virginia was one of the first to hold the 'Super­dance' I I years ago. 
By kicking off the band jam concept, Temeles hopes to "teach universities to do the band thing." There is already a program to teach high schools how to hold the I 2 hour dance-a-thons. They are now organizing a similar corres­pondence with other univer­sities and hope that The Great Escape will become a yearly happening at colleges across the country. 
The campus bands appearing at Notre Dame this year are Zito and the t1eat-ons, The Groove, Deadhorse, Eut­hanasia, and Catholics in Bad Standing. These groups alone represent many different styles of music including funk, dance, pop, and progressive. Four other bands appear including Sergeant Friday (from Wiscon­sin), Material Issue (from Evansville, Indiana), and two bands from Purdue: Toxic Gypsy and Elixir. 
In addition to the styles of­fered by the campus bands, Elixir offers a dimension of harder rock sounds. Material Issue, with a '60s pop sound is presently touring the East Coast and is rapidly becoming known as one of the better bands on the college scene. 
In planning the event, the group met every Thursday this 
semester. They proposed the 
concept to Student Govern­
ment, who were helpful and 
supportive. Since they receive 
all funding from the Cystic 

Fibrosis Foundation, the group 
learned how difficult it can be 
working with a bureaucracy. 

Temeles said it has been a learning process. "We made a lot of little mistakes. We wanted to get some CF patients to some Notre Dame masses so the students could see who they were helping," said Temeles. "We also wanted to sign a headline act. But that 
just didn't work out." The 
group made adjustments as 
they progressed to find better 
ways of organizing. 

Overall, Temeles feels that the group has been successful. This year, they wanted to es­tablish the event as an annual fundraiser. Temeles hopes that, because they worked so hard and made mistakes this year, "Next year, the people who are running it will know about what to expect. Also, Notre Dame is a good place to have the first Great Escape be­cause the people here care. Notre Dame is the starting point for this whole thing," Temeles said. Temeles hopes that next year the band jam will be more of a nationwide event, where colleges around the country will sponsor similar functions. 
Temeles said the biggest challenge will be getting the students to go to the band jam. "It will be a good time, and the money goes to saving lives. CF affects people our own age. It's not some distant thing." he said. If the spirit is good among the students at Notre Dame, it will transfer to the program on a national scale. 
Temeles also thanks the many people who have worked hard organizing and planning the event. If students are inter­ested in learning more about Cystic Fibrosis and how they can help fight it, they can call Dave Temeles at 283-1851, Pete Pucillo ·at 283-1422, or Quvi Ryan at 271-9142. Others are urged strongly to come and support this great cause· 
Since the band jam is nine hours long, students can come and go as they please. There will also be volleyball nets set up and prizes from various local donators.

en's tennis splits weekend action at S. Illinois 
The Notre Dame men's ten­nis team travelled to Carbon­dale, Ill. this weekend where it competed in the Southern Illi­nois Invitational. The teams competeing in the quadran­gular were Notre Dame, Bradley, Louisville and SIU­Carbondale. 
Saturday morning the Irish destroyed Louisville, 6-0. The Cardinals were severely over­matched, managing to win only 
Young Texas squad takes swim titles 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS--Texas Co­ach Eddie Reese has his second NCAA men's Division I swim­ming and diving championship with the potential for a dynasty. 
A squad dominated by under­classmen wrapped up the team title Saturday, giving the school a rare sweep of both the men's and women's champion­ships in 1988. 
"We came to swim and the way we get our excitement is to swim fast," said Reese, whose team's have finished third or higher in the meet eight of the past nine years and fifth in the other year. 
"Our goal will be to go back and try to get better" said Reese, who had three seniors, nine sophomores and three freshmen among the 17 swim­mers he brought to the meet. "Nobody can start a dynasty in this country. All you have to do is get up there and somebody

two sets. 

Notre Dame was once again led by the stellar play of cap­tain Mike Wall ace and junior Brian Kalbas. Kalbas started out slowly but eventually took control of his singles match. Kalbas defeated Scott Hill of Louisville 1-6, 7-6, 6-4. Wallace trounced David Rueff 6-1, 6-3. 
In other singles action against Louisville Ryan Wenger beat John Meade 1-6, 6-4, 7-6. Dan Walsh and Paul Odland won in straight sets, defeating Mike Mehlbauer and 
want you." 

Texas recorded 424 points in the three-day meet that ended Saturday--the most by a team since Indiana won the second of a record six consecutive titles with 427 points in 1969. 
Southern California, the fa­vorite, was second with 369 112 points. Stanford, which was seeking a fourth straight cham­pionship, was third with 275 112 points. 
"This team is younger. They worked harder as a group," said Reese in comparing this year's champions with the squad that won the title in 1981. "The thing that surprised me most about them is that they're tougher than the '81 team." 
Sophomores Kirk Stackle and Doug Gjertsen gave the Longhorns two victories in in­dividual events and the Lon­ghorns swept the three relay races. Gjertsen, who won the 200-yard freestyle Friday, also recorded a pair of seconds and was the anchor swimmer in two of the relay events. 
Jay Avenido respectively. 
Freshman David Kuhlman also has been playing outstand­ing tennis ever since a big win at Harvard over Spring Break, which earned him the sixth singles spot. Saturday Kuhlman beat the Cardinal's Chris Trinkle handily 7-5, 6-3. 
The Irish next took on the Salukis of SIU-Carbondale, in a much more competitive match. Southern Illinois dominated Notre Dame in sine:les play, and won overall 5-4. The Irish had beaten the

In other singles action Joe Deneterco trounced Mike Wallace 6-2,6-2. and Mickey Maule beat Ryan Wenger in a close match 7-6, 7-6. The Irish winners were Dave Reiter and Paul Odland.

In singles play, Ce Ce Cahill shook off a second-set loss and triumphed in three 6-4, 2-6, 6-2. Dasso also dropped the second set but followed suit in winning a three-set battle, 6-4, 0-6, 6-1. Alice Lohrer conquered Kelly Craig, 6-3, 6-2, and Bradshaw blanked Georgina Munsz, 6-0, 6-0. 
In doubles play, only two out of the three matches were played. The match between the number-one tandems was for­gone because by the time it could be played, the match was already decided. In matches that were played, the duo of Lohrer and Natalie Illig defeated Kristen Dicken and Georgina Munoz 6-3, 6-1. Brad­shaw and Pacella were pushed to a tiebreaker in the second set but would go no further and edged Kelley Craig and Mic­hello Oelze, 6-4, 7-6(7-5). 
"The girls played to win," said Gelfman. "I was pleased with the play of Alice Lohrer and Cathy Bradshaw. They both had great weekends." 
Gelfman was ecstatic that her team improved its record to 10-13. 
"I think we can attain a .500 record and I hope we realize how good we are," said Gelfman. 
Ramos 6-3, 6-3. 
In doubles play the Irish fared better, but didn't play well enough to win the match overall. Wallace and Reiter beat Maule and Ramos in straight sets 6-1, 7-6. The tan­dem of Mike Walsh and Paul Daggs also won in straight sets. Kalbas and Wenger came up short in doubles, losing to Al­bano and Deneterco 7-5, 7-5. 
The Irish played well in both matches and now have a record of 14-10. Louisville is 8-5 and Southern Illinois is 13-9.

Kent Graham skippered the No. 2 offense into the end zone against the No. 2 defense from 70 yards out on the next drive. Brooks gained seven yards on a fourth-and-three play to keep the drive alive, and junior Aaron Robb snagged a 10-yard touchdown pass on the sideline to finish it.

Lyle escapes as a Master 
Associated Press 
AUGUSTA, Ga.--Sandy Lyle, once teetering on the brink of collapse, extricated himself from a fairway bunker on the 72nd hole and then sank a 12­foot birdie putt for a one-shot victory Sunday in the 52nd Masters. 
Lyle, a husky Scot who won the 1985 British Open, was tied for the lead with Mark Cal­cavecchia until the final stroke of the tournament sent the putt downhill and into the cup. It finished off a 1-under-par 71 and made Lyle the first British subject to win this storied tournament. 
Lyle had to come out of a yawning fairway bunker on the 18th hole of the Augusta Na­tional Golf Club course. He ran hopefully onto the fairway to follow the flight of the ball, which hit beyond the cup and backed up toward the hole while the gallery howled for still more roll. 
Lyle, who had blown a two­
 shot lead and trailed as late as the 15th hole, rolled the winning putt into the back of the cup: It gave him a total of 281, seven shots under par. 
Lyle also became the only three-time winner on the Amer­ican PGA tour this season and mage. The final play was a play-action toss to freshman tight end Frank Jacobs from the 1-yard line. 

Holtz noted improvement in the area of penalties, but said there is still progress to be made. 
Junior Andy Heck, who has played tackle this spring, ran a few plays back at tight end near the end of the scrimmage. Pat Terrell is still in the defen­sive backfield, while Braxston Banks looks to be playing more fullback than tailback. 
"We're still trying to put the football team together," Holtz explained. "And we've got a long way to go. We're going to find the right combination on the offensive line. I don't know what it is yet, but we're going

By THERESA KELLY Assistant Sports Editor 
Anyone watching the Notre Dame football team practice this spring will see an un­familiar face and an old face 
in an unfamiliar place. 
The new face is secondary co­ach Chuck Heater, who takes over the defensive backfield from Terry Forbes, who retired after the 1987 season. Heater is coming off three years working as an assistant coach at Ohio State, where he coached the Buckeye second­ary. 
The old face in an unfamiliar place is that of Pat Terrell, a reciever last year who is making the move to free safety. 
Heater brings a successful philosophy from a successful Ohio State program. "I want the players to know their responsibilities," Heater 
to find it. 
"One thing's for sure: the only thing we won't change is their names." 
EXTRA POINTS: More bad . news for the offensive line. Jim Dadiotis, who is in the hunt for a job in the trenches, will be out for the rest of the spring with a shoulder separation suf­fered in the scrim­mage... Notre Dame basket­ball player Sean Connor is looking for the open Irish pun­ting job. Connor booted one more than 50 yards before the scrimmage in punt drills. "Sean's a real question mark," Holtz said. "We don't know if it's in his best interests to punt, though it might be in the best interests of the Notre Dame football team." 
lowed at 284 after a hard-won 
72. He was Lyle's playing partner in the final twosome that played over the flowered hills and valleys of the course Bobby Jones built. 
Greg Norman, the white­haired Australian who was runner-up in the last two Masters, started the day 11 shots back but burst into con­tention with a record-matching 30 over the front side. 
But the putts stopped falling with the same regularity on the back nine and, although finish­ing with a 64 that was the best round of the tournament, he ac­tually expressed disappoint­ment. 
"I thought if I could get it to five under (par) the other guys might start thinking, 'How can he shoot 62 out there?' and wor­rying about my score instead of theirs," Norman said. 
But he couldn't quite make it, finishing in a tie at 285, three under par, with Don Pooley and Fred Couples. 
Pooley had a closing 70 and Couples 71. 
South Mrican David Frost was at 286 after a 68. Tom Wat­son and Bernhard Langer were at 287. Watson, a two-time Masters champion, shot 71 and Langer, a West German who won here in 1985, had a 73.

Defense looks strong as experiments continue 
By MARTY STRASEN Sports Editor 
Notre Dame's defensive coaches are smiling. The offen­sive coaches are still ex­perimenting. 
And Saturday afternoon's spring football scrimmage in 
SPRittCi FOOTBALL 
Notre Dame Stadium was a great example of both. 
First the No.2 defense would stop the No.1 offense. Then the No.1 defense would stymie the No. 2 offense. Then it would happen again. And again. And again. 

Billy Hackett's 27-yard field goal after a 43-yard march by the No. 2 offense, led by fresh­man Kent Graham, snapped the shutout on the 12th drive of the afternoon. The defense stopped six of the first 11 drives without allowing a first down. 
"We won't sell many season tickets if the fans come to see offense," Irish head coach Lou Holtz said. "But I thought the hitting was crisp and the inten­sity was good. Our young offen­sive line really put the defense ahead. We're still trying to find the right chemistry up front." 
Defensive tackle Jeff Alm and outside linebacker Darrell "Flash" Gordon took advan­tage of the inexperience and 
358 title hopes are extinguished 
Intensity picks up on the courts 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
The first round of Bookstore Basketball XVII is history, as are the hopes of 358 teams which have been eliminated from competition. 
After the 48 games played yesterday, a total of 208 teams remain to vie for the coveted Bookstore title. The second round of action began yester­day and continues today and tommorow before the round of 128 kicks into gear Wednesday. 
AR~AA ~~~A 
Jirrrirrr'l 
Both the level of play and in­tensity picked up during this weekend's action and will con­tinue to do so for the rest of the tournament as some early favorites find that no win is a given. 
One seeded team which found its hands full was Minahoonies, who reached the final-16last year before bowing out to the eventual champions, 'Da Brothers of Manhood. Yes­terday they met up with 800 Pounds of Slow, White Cellulite in second round action. 
Cellulite and Minahoonies pounded the boards and an­swered point-for-point in the second half until Minahoonies, who played without point guard Steve Antonelli, eclipsed a 21-21 tie and put in two hoops to take the overtime win, 23-21. 
"It was a pretty physical game," said Pete Graham of Minahoonies, who scored eight points in the contest, "but's that's kind of the way we play. We've got some big players. We're not a crowd favorite, that's for sure, but they were just as physical as we were. 
"They (Cellulite) could have possibly been a final-32 team if they didn't get matched up with us. Hopefully the rest of our bracket won't be as difficult." 
Brideshead Revisited put a scare into I'll Play, No I Won't, I'll Play, No I Won't early in their game yesterday before the Leone's Stallions connec­tion of John Mundo and Al Mar­tin, guards on last year's tourn­ament runner-up team, turned up the tempo and ran away with a 21-13 win. 

Mike Sperry paced the early Brideshead success with a hot hand from the outside to knot the score at 5-5 and hold I'll Play to an 11-8 halftime count. But I'll Play, who played with­out another Leone's vet Bill Sullivan, poured it on as John Kennedy hit 9-of-13 to lead the winners into the third round. 
Sibling rivalry took on a new meaning on the Stepan courts yesterday when Red Death and the Jammin' Provost slayed Silly English Pigdogs, 21-11. Howie York scored three points for the winners while brother Mike went scoreless for the losers. Red Death had previ­ously outscored its opponents 42-1 before the battle of the Yorks. 
Lou's 2 QB's and Two Blind Guy~ advanced with a 21-13 win over Air Chek and Ground Sup­port. Former Irish basketball player Jeff Peters led the vic­tors with eight points, most coming off strong drives to the hole, while one of Lou's 2 QBs, Tony Rice, added five. The game was marred by a few hos­tile and profane reactions by an Air Chek player to abuse from a partisan segment of the crowd. 
"It was the first serious inci­dent we've had this year," said Bookstore Commissioner Mike Manning. "We didn't react in time to stop it and we regret that we didn't take immediate action. He should have been out of the game as soon as it hap­pened. 
"We realize tempers can flare out there on the court," continued Manning, "but that's not an excuse for unsportsman­like conduct. We can't tolerate this type of action and similiar actions will result in the elim­ination of any players in­volved."
