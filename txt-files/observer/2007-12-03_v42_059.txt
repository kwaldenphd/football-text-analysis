Hesburgh honored with resolution 
Congressrnan Donnelly calls president emeritus a role model for work in civil rights 
By JENN METZ Assistant News Editor 
Over the years, University President Emeritus Father Theodore Ilesburgh has been bestowed with many honors 
including  the  
Congressional Gold  Medal  
and the Presidential  Medal  

of Freedom, the nation's highest awards given to eivilians. 
Now, after the work of Congressman Joe Donnelly from the 2nd District of 
Indiana, a congressional res­olution can be added to the list. 
The House resolution ­H.RES.687-passed on a voice vote with 103 co-spon­sors on Oct. 9. 
According to the Library of Congress Web Site, the reso­lution recognizes "Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C, for his contributions to the civil rights movement in the United States, his tire­less work to reduce the threat of nuclear conflict and his efforts to secure the peaceful resolution of inter­national conflicts." 
Hesburgh was a charter member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Hights and served on it from 1957­
72. He was N o t r e D a m e ' s president f r o m

1987. 
Donnelly, a 1977 graduate of the University, was a stu­dent during the Hesburgh 
era, decided to sponsor a resolution honoring Hesburgh, who he called a "tremendous role model" and one of his heroes, when he found out he would be honored for his 90th birth­day in Washington. The Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery accepted a portrait of Hesburgh arm-in­arm with Martin Luther King, Jr. into its collection earlier the day the resolu­tion passed.

Students rally for migrant wages 
Crowd gathers to demonstrate against Burger King's refusal to increase worker pay 
ByJENN METZ A<Sistant News Editor 
A crowd of about 40 gathered at the Fieldhouse Mall Friday despitn freezing temperatures to listen to speakers talk about the plight of migrant tomato farm­ers in Florida and light to end sub-poverty level wages. 
Literature distributed at the rally said that Burger King, headquartered in Miami and a major purchaser of Florida tomatoes, has publicly rejected increasing the workers' wages by a penny per pound. Two of its eompetitors, Taco Bell and McDonald's, have both agreed to the pay raise, which would have been the first in 30 years. 
Sophomore Kris Trujillo, one of the organizers of the event, spoke from a stage covered with posters, including one that read: "We are a Nation of Immigrants." 
"Today, thousands of people are marching in Miami, Florida, in an effort to stop sweatshop conditions and modern day slav­ery in the fields of South Florida," he said. 
A group of workers formed what is called the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIWJ to help stop the injustice, he said. Their campaign has succeeded in the case of McDonald's and Taco Bell. But Burger King, which has a branch in the LaFortune Student Center, has not agreed to their three demands: one penny more per pound of tomatoes picked, a code of conduct in the fields and

Fence blocks part of DeBartolo quad 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
Students returning to campus after Thanksgiving break may have noticed a new obstade they had to maneuver on their way to classes -a fence around the DeBartolo Quad. 
Construction of the fence began on Nov. 19, aceording to an e­mail the Oflice of the University Architect and Utilities Department sent to the student body. The new fence endoses the construction site for Stinson­Hornick llall. the planned state­of-the-art engineering building on eampus. 
Notre Dame is building Stinson­Remick Hall on the site formerly 
. occupied by the University Club. 
The University Club, founded in 
1958, closed its doors earlier this 
year amid complaints from club 
members and employees who 
were unsure of the Club's future 
as it is forced to move off cam­
pus. 
The new engineering building, 
set to open in 2010, will house a 
nano-technology research center, 
a new energy center, an under­
graduate interdisciplinary learn­
ing center and a semiconductor 
processing and device fabrication 
clean room. 
"This lnow building] is just 
additional space for engineering.

NDSMCOBSERVER.COM HolyCross education discussed 
O'Connor highlights international mission 
By KATLYN SMITH News Writer 
Sister Francis O'Connor spoke to the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership (CWIL) International Advisory Board Thursday about education in the tradition of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. 
Sponsoring schools in South America, Africa and Bangladesh, the Sisters of the Holy Cross have produced visionary leaders and have empowered women in a mui­tiplicity of cuitures, O'Connor said. 
In Brazil, a sister constructed a recycling plant. Her popularity prompted the local community to nominate her for town mayor, O'Connor said. 
In the U.S., the sisters lobby for peace and justice issues and defend abused women, O'Connor . said. 
"Young women have joined us and carried on the dream of an intercultural, diversified congrega­tion," O'Connor said. 
She also referred to her 20 years of missionary work in Bangladesh. 
Under the Holy Cross leadership, the only Chric;tian women's college in the country was founded in 1950. 
'The school has contributed to empowerment of Bangladesh women," O'Connor said.

Travel supplements in-class learning 
Professors take students to Europe, but funding proves problematic

First it was a day trip to Chicago to see a play. Now, multiple Notre Dame classes are spending a week touring Europe. 
Two prominent classes with a travel component this year are Ian Kuijt's Archaeology in Ireland class and Father Kevin Spicer's Holocaust class. 
During fall break, students in Kuijt's class explored archaeologi­cal digs throughout Ireland to see firsthand what they had been studying in the classroom. 
"It was amazing; I would rec­ommend it highly," said .lillian Brems, one of 12 students who participated in the class this

Madness. 
But you've Editor 

!ward it all 
boforn. 
Since its inception, we've all been 

made aware of the system's shortcom­
ings. I low it misplaces teams in the 
national championship. I low it takns a 
dngrne in computer science to predict 
bowl winners with any smnblance of 
accuracy. llow it doesn't give undefeat­
ed teams like Ilawaii a chance to play 
in the national championship even 
though Boise State proved last s1mson 
that mid-n11~jors can compete. 
Tlw morn I thought about it. I real­

iznd that this is exactly why tho BCS 
works. 
llypotlwtieal situation: The NCAA 

institutes a 16-tnam playotr systmn, set 
up like orw region of the colloge bas­
ketball tournanwnt so that the No. l 
plays tlw No. 16 seed, P1.1:. If that werr~ 
in pl;u:e this season, No. S USC would 
play No. I) Oklahoma in the first round. 
The Trojans' disaster of a loss to 
Stanford would nwan nothing in that 
scenario. A'i it is today, it means every­
thing. 
If your team loses in a tournament, 

who do you blanw'? The players or the 
mad1os. With the BCS, you ean blame 
tlw 1:omput1~r rankings, thn A'isoeiat1~d 
Prnss and a multitude of other far.tors 
for keeping your tnarn out or thn cham­
pionship. Mur.h morn fun. 
In a crazy season such as this, the 

BCS is thn pt~rroct solution. The gn~at 
thing about this football season was the 
parity. LSU's triplo-OT losses, Boston 
College's last-minute comeback, 
Central Florida's brief moment in the 
spotlight, Appalachian State making 
fans everywhere but Ann Arbor giddy 
with nxeitmnent. West Virginia and 
Missouri both throwing away their shot 
at the bayou at the same time -none 
of this would be nearly as interesting 
without the BCS in place to intensify 
the mess. This year, a playoff would not 
work. Tmmessee, at IJ-4, would have a 
dmnce at the championship in a play­
oil" system. Completely unacceptable. 
Also, the BCS is only nine years old. 

It's a fluid system that continues to 
evolve. llawaii has a BCS bowl this sea­
son, following in the footsteps of Utah 
and Boise. Should it win, it will become 
even morn appamnt that mid-majors 
with pnrlect records against weak 
schndulns may in faet be pretty good. 
It's only a mattnr of time before one 
nmches the ehampionship game. 
Finally, it's just plain fun. Who didn't 

have a blast Saturday night after West 
Viq.,tinia and Missouri lost arguing 
about whether Georgia, LSU or 
Virginia Tech will play the Buckeyes in 
Nnw Orleans? The BCS may not bn 
pnrfeet, but it's an important part of 
the game, much as the strike zone is in 
baseball. You may hate it, you may vili­
fy it, and you may think you havn alter­
nativns. But this season wouldn't bn 
what it was without it.

Giant truffle auctioned for

FLORENCE, Italy-A Macau casino mogul bid a record $330,00 at auction Saturday to win a giant white truffle dug up in Tuseany, organizers said. 
Billionaire Stanley Ho 
made the winning bid for the 3.3 pound truffie during an auction staged simulta­neously in Florence, London and at Ho's Grand Lisboa hotel in Macau, said auction organizer Giselle Oberti. 
The price bested the pre­vious record for a truffie of $212,000, she said. 
The unusually heavy truf­fle was dug up last week by truffle hunter Cristiano Savini, his father Luciano and dog Rocco in Palaia, a town about 25 miles from Pisa. The Savinis said Rocco started snifiing "like crazy" when he zeroed in on the fungus.

Nation votes on conhuversial reforms 
Future of term limits, other policies unknown as officials continue to count ballots 
Associated Press 
CARACAS-Hugo Chavez sought to cement his power Sunday in a vote on constitu­tional reforms that could let him remain president for life, a critical test for a leader b£mt on turning this major 
U.S. oil provider into a socialist state. 
Opponents fear a plunge toward dictatorship. Supporters have full faith that Chavez will use the reforms to deepen grass­roots democracy and more equitably spread the wealth. 
Information Minister Willian Lara said early in the day that there had been "a massive turnout," but turnout later appeared low at some polling places and no ollicial figures were avail­able. 
An emboldened opposition and violent dashes in recent weeks prompted fears of bit­ter conflict if either side dis­putes the result<>, which poll­sters predict will be close. Polling stations with lines remained open into the evening. 
'Tm very sure that every­thing is going to go very well," Chavez said after vot­ing, holding his newborn grandson in his arms. "We're going to accept the results, whatever they are."

Diplomat urges Iraqis to consider legislation 
U.S. says political progress needed to stabilize country, warns that Sunni and Shiite extremists still pose serious threat 
Associated Press 
BACIIIlAil-Washington's No. 2 diplomat pressml leaders of Iraq's religious and nthnie factions Sunday to takn advan­tagn of rnennt sneurity gains to push through legislation aimed at cemonting national reconcili­ation or risk a return to groater violm1ce. 
Tho warning came as the main Sunni bloc agreod to return to parlianwnt aftor ofli­cials nasnd a virtual house arrest of' its leader, putting an end to a crisis that had threat­orwd to inflame sectarian ten­sions as Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds struggle to forge power sharing agreements. 
"The sncurity surgn has deliv­ered significant rnsults, now progress on political reconcilia­tion induding key national legis­lation as well as economic advan1:es is rwmled to consoli­date the gains made thus far," 
U.S. Deputy Secrotary of State .John Negroponte said. "If progress is not made on tlwse fronts we risk falling back to the more violent pattorns or the past." 

The U.S. military has said the Jev1~ls of violence in Iraq have fallon to lows not seen since .January 2006, just before the bombing of' a revered Shiite shrine in Samarra set ofT reprisal killings that have left tons of' thousands of Iraqis dP.ad and pushed the country to the brink of eivil war. But top American commanders have warned that Sunni and Shiite oxtrornists still pose a serious throat. 
At Joast 17 people were killed or found dead on Sunday. The deadliest attack was a suieide ear bomber who struck a high­way police checkpoint northwest of tho Anbar provincial capital of Hamadi, killing at least throe oiTicors and wounding one, police said. Hoadside bombs also kil11\d live Iraqi security forces in separate attacks in Baghdad and north of the capital in Samarra. 
Political progress has been lagging, with lawmakers clash­ing over Kurdish oil dmtls with foreign companies and engaging in heated exchanges over a draft bill that would allow thousands of' formflr membl\rs of Saddam Hussein's Baath party to return to their government jobs. Both measures are among the 18 benchmarks sp,t by U.S. President George W. Bush's administration to encourage recondliation. 
Oil Minister Hussain al­Shahristani, using unusually strong language, told Iraqi state television late Sunday that the eontraets signed by the self-rule Kurdish region were illegal and that the companies involved had bonn told so by the Iraqi govern­nwnt. 
"They have acted alone and gave Iraq's oil to strangers," al­Shahristani, a Shiite, said. 
"No rngion has the right to go it alone and sign a deal," he added. "This will lead to the breakup of Iraq ... oil is the busi­ness of the federal government and any attempt at extracting oil without the approval of the fed­eral government is tantamount to smuggling." 
The Kurds have insisted the deals are constitutional. 
Negroponte, who was wrap­ping up a six-day tour through half of Iraq's 18 provinces, said Iraqi politicians nPeded to follow up quickly on "significant" and "very palpable" achievements in security. 

"It's one thing to have brought the violence under some sem­blance of control but it's anothnr now to follow up with the neces­sary reconstruetion and stabi­lization projects," he said at a news confenmce in the U.S.-pro­tected (;reen Zone in central Baghdad.

Or. Charles Miller, director of liver transplantation at the Cleveland Clinic, said that what concerns surgeons "is that you're taking a very sick patinnt and, in most cases, you would rather do the simplest operation." 
The liver, which deans toxins from the blood, is unique among the body's organs in its ability to regenerate, making the procedure possible. In some eases, the liver can recover from acute, or sudden, failure on its own. But if the organ doesn't recover fast enough, patients can suffer brain. damage from the toxins if they don't get a transplant.

IN BRIEF Congressional delay affects tax returns 
WASHINGTON -Silena Davis had counted on an early tax refund to pay for getting her teeth fixed. Now, because Congress has dawdled all year on a tax bill, she and millions of other early filers could have to wait extra weeks for refunds that last year averaged $2,291. 
The Internal Revenue Service is looking hard at delaying the start of its filing season, set to kick ofl' on Jan. 14, if Congress fails to pass legislation in the next two weeks. At issue is how to handle what could be a dramatic increase in the number or people facing a higher alternative minimum tax. 
If there is a delay and it extends into mid­February, it would slow nearly 38 million refunds worth a total of about $87 billion, the IRS Oversight Board predicts. 
"It would definitely make a big difference with me," said Davis, a George Washington University Law School administrator. ''I'm going to have to get a crown and it's going to be rnally expfmsive."

Democrats support fuel efficiency 
Congress set to demand 40 percent increase in vehicle mileage standards by 2020 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -An agreement among congres­sional Democrats including those from auto industry states-to sup­port a 40 percent increase in vehicle fuel efficiency is likely to be the tonic need­ed to push energy legisla­tion through Congress before Christmas. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., a long­time protector of the auto industry, settled their dif­ferences in an agreement late Friday on the fuel economy, or CAFE, issue, clearing the way for a House vote on a broader energy bill, probably on Wednesday. 
Automakers would be required to meet an indus­trywide average of 35 miles per gallon for cars and light trucks, including SUVs, by 2020, the first increase by Congress in car fuel efficiency in 32 years. 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada called the compromise "good news" and said he hoped to take up the legis­lation quickly after the House acts. 

Dingell said the tougher standards are "both aggressive and attainable" a sharp increase in ethanol say "bloody". -floor of senators who have long and include provisions that use as a motor fuel and debate over energy next opposed increased fuel give manufacturers the require nonpublic electric week.

Again, this was in 2005.

What is needed now is a shift that priori­tizes policy and the individuals it impacL'i -both Americans and Iraqis; a change in the reality rather than the perception of the war. 
Admittedly, public support is crucial to winning a war, but the administration must realize that when a decline in insurgency and street violence is our victory after four years of troop deployments, civilian and military causalities and billions of dollars, the American people want more than a new image for the war.

Christlllas spirit harder to elllbrace 
I've done everything I can to get into the spirit of the holiday season. 
I rose bofore the sun on Black Friday-Christmas list and coupons in hand. I stood for a half hour in the Kohl's checkout line that wrapped around the store. I bounced down the aisles in sync with the Christmas carols projecting from the stores' speakers. 
I decorated my niiniature Christmas tree and placed it on my nightstand underneath my window adorned with multicolored lights. I helped my mom hang E . W d
°0

garland and red bows on the pillars outside our house. nn 
I changod the wallpaper on my cell phone and computer to white Bradley falling snowflakes. I changed my ring tone to 'NSYNC's "Merry University Christmas, Happy Holidays," and I have been jamming to Clay Bradley Scout Aiken's "Merry Christmas With Love" in my car. I sang Christmas carols with my frienc:Js downtown at Yulelike Peoria. 
When we got the first snowfall Sunday, I stared out my bedroom window hoping it would stick to the grass and trees and accumulate. 
But despite the effort I've put forward to welcome the holiday season, I still can't seem to get into the mood. Part of the problem is that Thanksgiving came earlier this year and the weather just recently became cold to match the season. 
Instead of having a week of classes and then a few days of fmals before Winter Break, we aren't officially fini'ihed until Dec. 19. 
But I can't blame the calendar makers for making Thanksgiving come early, and I can't blame school officials for letting us out later because of it. I also can't hold the meteorolo­gists responsible for letting the temperature rise into the 60's in November. 
In the end, I can't find anyone to point fingers at for not letting me get into the holiday buzz. I feel like Charlie Brown when he was trying to find the true meaning of Christmas. But that's not really it because I already know the true meaning of Christmas. It's about the birth of Jesus Christ, being charitable to our fellow man, celebrating the gift of giving and spending time with friends and family. 
So now what? Do I accuse myself and other American shoppers for getting wrapped up in the materialism of holiday shopping? Do I blame the people who look past Jesus and venerate inflatable Santas instead? 
I can't point fingers at anyone because Christmas shopping and Santa are almost as important to my holiday season as Jesus and family are. 
But I think I've found the answer. The holiday season isn't what it used to be because I'm growing up. Christmas gets farther away from how I remember it as a child, and I haven't wanted to acknowledge that. I'm 21, and I refuse to accept that Santa isn't going to eat my chocolate chip cookies I put by the tree and Rudolph isn't going to eat the car­rots I throw in the yard. 
Instead of studying for fmal exams and putting out a newspaper, I want to go back to the times when my mom Saran-wrapped my feet to keep them warm during the Festival of Lights parade in East Peoria. I want the adrenaline I got when I snuck into the living room to see ifSanta had come yet. I want to watch "Prancer" and still believe it's a true story. 
But that's not happening, and I need to come to terms with it. Everybody wants to be 10 years old again, including me, but it's not realistic. And I'm hoping that because I finally figured that out this year, I can enjoy the holiday season and be thankful for the Christmas I have. 
But I can't promise I won't cry during "Prancer" or sneak downstairs to see what Santa brought.

The gam_e of tm_ flrtng 
It's Friday afternoon and I hear a familiar beep in my purse. I open my phone to a glowing message. 
"Hey what r u up to?" Sigh. I guess we're doing this again. Ever since phone calls

American 

about one thing: Will he 
University

call or won't he? These 
The Eagle 

days, this concern is exac­erbated by even more ways for your sweetie to either snare or snub you electronically. 
The old-fashioned phone call now shares the spotlight with a host of other options for techno­logical foreplay: Facebook messages and wall post'>, instant messages and, foremost among them, text messages. (We won't include Facebook pokes, as they're lor 13-year-olds and pervert<;.) A'i they've evolved, each one has been loosoly ranked on a scorecard of affection, lead­ing everyone in the dating game to wonder how many point'> they still need in order to get to the next level. 
Girls' Night Out conversations are filled with broaks to thumb-type furiously and fret about the intentions ofsomeone who has yet to com­municate via voice. "If he doesn't call, but he text<; and 1M's, is that just as good?" "How many texts equal a phone call?" "I got a wall post say­ing he's free tonight, but it's been two hours since I texted him back, so I think he's sleeping with someone else." And because no one ever texts, "My intentions are that we continue see­ing each other regularly for an extended period of time" but rather, "Ur 2 cute. C u at 9 k? xx!" The ambiguities never quite get resolved. 
I was formerly completely anti-text message and would use them for strictly utilitarian pur­poses, such as to let someone know to meet me somewhere, or that the bus had hit a hobo and therefore I would be another hour late. I had the type of text plan where you pay 20 cents per text sent or received, and I would berate my friends for sending me non-necessary texts. I finally cracked and upgraded to a more gener­ous plan when I began seeing a guy who liked to send about 10 or 20 texts throughout the day, each bearing nothing but a semicolon and closed parenthesis, every time we had a date. Obviously, neither telling him to stop nor suffer­ing a $150 phone bill were viable alternatives. 
What's baffling is that behavior like that of Emoticon Man is increasingly thought ofas a viable alternative to actual contact. Text mes­saging has been around for a gazillion technolo­gy years, but its use has expanded from a quick­update mechanism to a legitimate form of inter­personal communication. 
Under the guise of "saving time," we've adapted technology to make us look as breezy and busy as possible, waiting hours before responding to texts or abbreviating five-letter words for that "''m so busy and important" effect. We spend 20 minutes thumb-typing a message that could be said in 20 seconds, craft­ing newer, sexier sign-offs. 
What's more, there's a somewhat scary per­manency to it all. Technology allows us to accu­rately ascertain, with friends gathered around a glowing iPhone screen, "What did he mean by that?" without accidentally remembering it incorrectly. It can document exactly what you said in that fateful 160-character precursor to the breakup. There are no take-backs in e-flirt­ing. 
In short, technology has streamlined dating communication to its barest essentials. With it, we are able to project quick, impersonal glimpses of our most perfectly crafted selves, saving time, effort and daytime minutes. Unfortunately, we also lose the stutters, the awkward silences, the thoughtful pauses and all of the other beautiful imperfections of old-fash­ioned conversation. Instead, we lie in wait, cells in hand, hoping for a witty, carefree, abbreviat­ed comment to beep through from across the electronic abyss so that we can wonder what it signifies. In the end, it only adds obstacles to a game that was complicated enough to begin with.

It will bn accompanied by a ynar long tour throughout 200R. The Michigan band has recently been featured in rngional venues and on loeal radio sta­tions, playing both its ori~-,rinals and covers. Four Finger Fivn concentrates on roek and soul. but have experimented with many other musieal gnnres. 
The widn range of genres Four Finger Five prnsents managns to b1~come both its greatest strength and weakness. One track will have moments like those f(JUnd in the music of Led Zeppelin, the next will have a strong jazz 
feel, the one after appeals to AI Green. and when the lis­tennr least expmts it sudden­ly hn is exposed to rap or what sounds like reggae. This is no surprise consider­ing that between the three musicians in the band, they have been trained in every­thing from classical, to jazz, funk and hip-hop. Its list of covers indudes artists rang­ing from the Bmt.tles to Stevie Wonder and Soulive. 
While it is rnfreshing to lis­ten to an album with a diverse set of sounds, in the end it feels like the band is still looking for a style that is uniquely its own. Them is no question that Four Finger Five can do a lot, but the listener is left wondoring what it is the band rnally wants to do. 
The extreme mixture of genres is revealed in songs such as "Hubble." The song starts oll" with work frorn the electri­cal guitar that nears catchy, moves into somo soulful lyrics including "the nibble is looted and the truth reconstituted," but somehow ends with rap and a light trailing off of a bell-like keyboard. Some of the songs need a little fine tuning; there is nothing particularly wrong with "Get It Together," but thH keyboard throughout tim song hearkens to the electric organs heard in baseball stadiums. "Soul Hhythm" is one of the most fun and danccable tracks, incorporating mostly jazz and soul, as Sturgill sings, "You are dancing to the rhythm of your soul I Got to free your body, let your body go." 
Tlw album also ineludes contributions from veteran sax player Karl Donson and keyboardist Anthony Smith. Denson and the other brass guest musicians add a lot of' depth to the jazz pieces, espeeially on "Johnson" where Denson shows ofT his skill. Overall, the songs are pleasant and something to jam to while getting work

As Sudol's debut album, "One Cell in the Sea" im:orporates many frnsh and subtle themes from her life, such as her paronts' divorce and the breakdown of various rnlationships, to produce hauntingly mov­ing songs. 
While most of the songs stay hushed and low key, a few pick up the rhythm and keep the album safe Jrom the danger of being too depressing. Two in particular, "You Picked Me" and "Hope for the llopeless," incorporate sweeping orches­trations and swift arrangemenl'i to keep the listener from drifting into a sad and deprnssed stupor from all the heartbreak songs. With the inclusions of' the upboat piano and string sections, these poignantly 
buoyant songs add an almost 
f~thercal element to the 
album, making it interesting for the listener to ponder. 
Perhaps the most fascinat­ing clement of the album is il'i Alice in Wonderland Lover." It is a song about a relationship that was not to bn and is now far gone from il<; happiest moments. You ean sense that Sudol is sensitive to the hurt inflicted by the inaccessibility of love, however, it is somehow dear that while she is sensitive she is not vulnerable. Indeed, her remark­able confidence as a woman and an artist flows through each note and word. Of course, the song is only powerful becausn it so truly embodies the fullest momenl'i of human heartbreak. Yet the heartbreak is only as much as heartbreak can be; it is not a song of obsessive desperation. She is heartbroken at what could not be, yet she is not obsessed with what will not be. 
Indeed, like experienced in "Almost Lover," many of the album's tracks contain a trace of resignation that is trumped by Sudol's stirring vow to herself to rise above the sadness and move on -a bit bruised, not broken -to something unseen yet beautiful nonetheless. The vocals are dear, powerful, and stunningly beautiful. With the piano and accompanying orchestra­tions, Sudol construeL-; some of the most gorgeous songs being produced today. 
Surn, Sudol sings a few songs that bor­der on overly sappy and melodramatic. But really, what ean you expeet from the debut album of a girl who has so much to sing about and with so much emotion? Nothing much difl'enmt at all. What she does, she does well. Plus, she's bmm desig-

and confident. A surprisingly knock out blend. Only The Format's essential figurehnads, the cool duo of Sam Means and Nate Huess, made the trek out to Notre Dame. Leaving the rest of their band back horne in Arizona, the pair oph~d for a combination of unadulterat­ed vocals and graceful instrumental accompaniment. 
In this age of music, who knew the wonders that just a mic, keyboard and ampnd acoustie guitar could do. Apparently these tried and true staples can still make music magic when in the right hands. The poignant affect of this simplicity was only accentuated by the dose proximity of the audience to the band. While at times you had to ques­tion tho logic of putting The Format mern inches away from their viewers, the dose dynamic of the performance made !'or an appealing and personal music going experience. Despite fan's sometimes pn~carious excitement, the group effortlessly performed essentially in its audience. Commendable bravery, considering that their performance relied lm raw vocals. Huess, the lead vocalist, even warned the closest audi­nncn rnnmbers to keep their crooning at a minimum as to not throw off his

pitch. For those not in the first row, the tantalizing opportunity to sing along gave fans a chance to contribute as a crowd of backup singers. Fans were so close, not only could they easily hear the group, but in turn could easily be heard by the group, making an endless amount of openings for eager viewers. 
During breaks, fans took advantage of this proximity to shout out cries of sup­port and interest. Huess replied to everything from comments about the purple knit cap he donned to the audi­ence's shouted requests. One particular fan cried out that he had written his Notre Dame admissions essay on The Format's pensive song, "Snails." The band got a kick out of this, joking that if "my s***y lyrics got you in here then maybe I could get in too." Later the duo urged prospective med students to use their new song, "Swans," in their future admission essays. They reasoned that "it's a metaphor too," and apparently that works. Though there was plenty of energized fan activity to go around, Huess' on point vocals demanded atten­tion. 
Exceeding expectations, his voice was unfathomably studio quality. With seemingly effortless ease, Huess' per­formance lived up to the standards that can be found on any one of their albums. Furthermore, it demonstrated an experienced confidence that could achieve virtual perfection even in close quarters. These vocals coupled with Means' easy accompaniment created a plain, down to earth presentation. This band clearly understands the difference between simple and simplistic, pairing

Though the combination of water bottles and Coronas had a place in The Format's backstage hangout, there were no hordes of groupies to be found. Instead, some comfy couches, an Apple computer and college football set the scene. The Format's personality is about as upfront and sincere as any fan would expect. The best way to describe the band's members is refreshingly down to earth. 
The group's founders, Nate Huess and Sam Means, are currently taking time off from full band performances, using the free time to relax and work on new material while intermittently playing at university venues. They cited favorite shows at schools in Irvine, Phoenix and Memphis. But they haven't all been easy, low maintenance appearances. Under previous condi­tions of obnoxiously early slots or equipment lost in poor flight connec­tions, the band did admit to not always being on its A-game. 
Its talent doesn't seem to be too threatened by flukes. The band has received critical praise for its unique sound. It must have something going 
their obvious talent with a quirky sense of humor. This eccentric talent was often brought to life by Huess' comfort­able presence, which had a hint of Mick Jagger's mannerisms. In songs typically characterized by drum or guitar solos, Huess filled in with his own vocal ver­sions of the instrumental. Cheers to not taking oneself too seriously. Ile showed real commitment to this cause when he accompanied these solos with respec­tive air guitar or air drumming. 
The Format took care to cover the full ground of their discography. Their roughly hour-long set included favorites from "Snails," "Interventions and Lullabies," and the most recent "Dog Problems." They also previewed a cou­ple of new songs. Their diverse set ended with a two-song encore, which the group claimed to be unanticipated. Overall, The Format's performance seemed to satisfy the desire for old favorites and curiosity about new mate­rial. After this appearance the band has surely won a few more fans and intrigued old fans with fresh material. 
Though there was expressed interest in the group's return to South Bend, The Format predicted that the closest they would get to our campus in future would be Chicago. After this concert, the South Shore Train ride would be worth the trip.

for it to draw hundreds of fans to Legends Saturday, despite sleet storms and campus wind tunnels. Perhaps The Format's commitment to creating complete, cohesive albums, rather than COs of singles surrounded by fillers, keeps fans wanting more. · 
Musical purity of this type reflects the band's appreciation for 1960s and 1970s music. When asked about its interest in rock's golden age, the band noted an admiration for the quality of work and the experience of that time but also valued the merits of the cur­rent music scene. Though Means did admit to not know what fans were doing the first time he saw lighted cell phones wave in the air, don't look to this band to preach about returning to the integrity of lighters. 
This intelligent balance of respect for the past and contentment with the present explains The Format's all-time favorite bands, the Beatles and Lindsey Buckingham. It also accounts for its gratitude for being compared to bands like Jellyfish. Overall The Format isn't too concerned with rival­ry. 
When asked who its biggest competi­tion was, The Format answered Steel Train. But not for the reasons you might think. Huess grumbled that tour-

ing companions always beat them in bowling and dodge ball matches. Maybe The Format would have a bet­ter chance against Fleetwood Mac, the act the band said it would most like to tour with. 
The Format's unassuming vibe speaks well to its ideas on the progres­sion of its style, leaving it free of pre­tention. The group wants to make each record better than the next, and it looks forward most to playing its new material at concerts. It was most excit­ed to sample its new song, Bends and Hedges. 
While the band conceded that "money is awesome," it also main­tained that being satisfied with its work is paramount. The Format isn't about to sacrifice the veracity of its talent for a larger fan base or more profit. 
While band members said they value fan interest, they're not coneerned with catering to their fan base. Luckily for them, they earn enough that they don't have to work -a luxury that grants them more time to work on their music.

LSU has a ticket to the title game. Everyone else has a pretty good gripe. 
The latest chapter in this crazy, unpredictable col­lege football season was written Sunday when LSU won the sport's version of the lottery, being picked to play Ohio State for the championship and leaving about a half-dozen other candidates with plenty to complain about. 
The Tigers (11-2). ranked second in the latest Associated Press poll, will be the first team to play in the BCS title game with two losses. 
No. 1 Ohio State goes into the game, Jan. 7 at 
page 13 
week three times in the last two months. 
The rest of the BCS games are filled with teams that had every bit as good an argument as LSU for a spot in the title game. 
In the Sugar Bowl, Georgia will play Hawaii. The Bulldogs (10-2) were fourth and idle coming into the final weekend ­behind Missouri, West Virginia and Ohio State ­but didn't automatically rise two spots the way coach Mark Richt thought they should. Hawaii (12-0), meanwhile, is the nation's only undefeated team, but is penalized for playing a weak schedule in the Western Athletic Conference. 


the Superdome in New Orleans, at 11-1. 
Missouri and West Virginia, the teams that came into the weekend ranked 1 and 2, lost Saturday to blow their title chances, were left out of the BCS altogether. 
Why did LSU, which was seventh in the BCS stand­ings heading into the final weekend, make the jump to No. 2 and into the big game, while Oklahoma, Southern California, Georgia and a number of others were left behind? 
The 174 poll voters and handful of computer nerds whose calculations make up the BCS rankings prob­ably all have their own reasons. Among the best is that LSU was rewarded for winning the Southeastern Conference, which is tradi­tionally viewed as one of the toughest leagues in the nation. 
There's also the argu­ment coach Les Miles and athletic director Skip Bertman offered up Saturday night: The Tigers went undefeated in regula­tion this season -their two losses both coming in triple overtime. 
Paper-thin as that line of reasoning may sound, it's as good as any in this topsy turvy season during which the top-ranked team lost four times, the second­ranked team lost six times since October and Nos. 1 and 2 lost on the same 
IN BRIEF 

Hawaii to face Georgia in New 
Orleans for Sugar BOwl 
NEW ORLEANS -Colt Brennan and high-scoring Hawaii are perfectly thrilled to play in the Sugar Bowl. Georgia hoped to reach the Superdome, too -only not for this game. 
In the year of the upset, Georgia was indeed upset. The Bulldogs blossomed into one of the best teams in the coun­try with six straight wins, and believed they should've been picked for the BCS championship game. 
Instead, LSU jumped the Bulldogs in the standings and will play Ohio State for the title. 
"We feel like we got shafted a little bit," Georgia safety Kelin Johnson said. "The numbers don.'t add up. The numbers do not add up. The numbers do not lie. That's what is confusing. I don't know what's going on." 
"I do think we were .unofficially dis­qualified for not winning our confer­ence," Richt said. 
Spurs beat Portland, lose 
D"uncan to knee injury 
SAN ANTONIO -When Tony Parker saw teammate Tim Duncan on the court dutching his knee, two things went through hi'imind. 
First, he hoped it wasn't as bad as it looked. Second, the team had to maintain its focus, even though it didn't know how bad the damage wa'i to the star player. 
As it turned out, Dunr;m's injury doesn't appear to be season-ending and Parker and the Spurs kept their mind on the game, coasting to a 100-79 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday. 
"It looked bad at first," said Parker. who scored 27 points and dished out eight assi&is. 'There were still like eight minutes left in the second quarter, so we just had to keep play­ing, keep playing and then whatever hap­pens, happeps." 
Duncan bruised his right knee and sprained his right ankle in the first half and did not return to the game. The team said all of Duncan's ligaments appeared stable but that he'd undergo an MRl exam Monday. 
Yankees set deadline for 
Santana trade talks 
NASIMLLE, Tenn. -The New York Yankees likely will pull out of trade talks for Johan Santana if the Minnesota Twills don't make a decision by late Monday. 
''I'm not going to be played against the Red Sox. That's not something I'll do. Timt's not something the Yankees should ever do, and that's I tl1ink what they're trying to do now," Yankees senior vice president I lank Steinbrenner said Sunday. "So if they want the best offer that has been offered to them, then they need to make up their minds." 
The Yankees have proposed swapping pitcher Phil Hughes, center fielder Melky Cabrera and a midlevel prospeet for the two-time Cy Ymmg Award winner, who can be('J)me a free agent after next sea'iOn. 
Boston also is competing to land Santana. The Red Sox are thought to have offered a package that would include pitch­er Jon Lester or center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury but not both. Center fielder Coco Crisp also ('j)uld be part of a trade.

''I'm always confident when thn ball is in my hands. I don't earn if I miss eight or nine shots, I feel like the next one is going to go in," Tinsley said. ''I've got to cn~d­it my coaehing stall' for leaving me out there when I miss a lot of shoL'i so that I get an opportunity to take another one. They were doubling down on Jermaine, tho guys made the extra pass, and they just wont in today." 
O'Neal had 20 points and 15 rebounds despite a sore right shoulder. The six-time All-Star was forced to sit out the final 
2:19 of Friday night's 95-93 loss at Seattle after hurting himself setting a screen. 
"Yesterday morning he wasn't able to get his arm above his shoulder, but we kept on working on it," coach Jim O'Brien said. "lie was doubtful today, and I was actually planning on going without him. But I found out he could go, and he had a great game." 
O'Neal was more concerned about his left knee Saturday morning than his shoulder. lie missed five games prior to the 
Seattle eontest beeause of 
swelling in the knee and his 
lower leg. 
"Obviously, my knee has been a concern over the last two months, and I've been struggling to make moves, make shots, rebound and block shoL<>," O'N1~al said. "Tho Seattle game was actually the first time I didn't have pain in my knee in almost a year and a half, and today I didn't have any pain in my knee at all. 
"My shoulder was about X5 percent," O'Neal addf~d. "We ked it a lot y1~stnrday, I took somn Advil, iced it again this morning and was ready to go." 
Chris Kaman had 22 poinL'i and 22 rebounds for the Clippers. who are 2-9 sinen a 1 04-X9 win at Indiana on Nov. 7 that capped their 4-0 start. Sam Cassell, who seored 35 points that night, missed his second straight game with a strainnd loll calf. 
Tho Clippers' injury woes grnw a bit worsn when No.I dral't pick AI Thornton sprained his left ankle and left the game with 1:22 to go in tho first half. 
"It seems like it's one injury alter another for this team," said Kaman, thn only player to start all 15 games for the Clippers. "We can't make excuses, bneause every team in the NBA goes through that. But it has been ridiculous." 
Tinsley hit a 3-pointnr and a 19-footnr 44 seeonds apart to put the Pacers ahead to stay, then drained another 3-pointor with 
1:56 remaining to put them ahead 96-90 and added a pair of free throws in the fimtlminute.

Strong shooting vaults Detroit over NewJersey 
Associated Press 
AUBUBN IIILLS, Mich. -Bkhard llamilton and Chauncey Billups got into a groove on Sunday night -at the New .Jers1~y Nets' expense. 
Billups and Hamilton. both ham perPd by inj urins in the first month of the season, eombined for :H points on 12-of-1 9 shoot­ing in the Pistons' I l X-95 vido­ry. 
"It's fun to play like this," said Billups, who had I X points and nirw assists. "Wp're moving the ball well. and that's the key for us." 
llamilton sat out most of the prnsnason with an ankln injury, then missed tho first two games ol' tlw rngular season while attending tlw birth or his son. 
111~'s gorw night straight games without roaching 20 points, but hn felt as if lw was closer against Nnw Jnrsny, gotting 1<J bnfore sitting out tho final nine rn imrtl~s. 
"I was finally abiP to gbt into a rhythm." llamilton said. "Coach left me out thern to figure things out, and that hnlpPd a lot." 
Detroit also got a boost from .Jason Maxin! I. who had 1 X points and II rebounds to lwlp tho Pistons win for tlw sixth time in snvnn games, and beat the Nets for the fifth straight time. 
Maxiell struggled while replac­ing Hasheed Wallace and Antonio McDyess in the starting lineup, hut has averaged 13.3 points and 10 rebounds as a rosorve in the last throe games. 
"I think Maxie is better coming ofT tho bnnch, because the refs tond to eall games tight early, and he was picking up early fouls," Pistons coach Flip Saund1~rs said. "Now he's in thorn a little later, and he's able to be more aggressive." 
The Nets agn~ed that Maxiell's physical style blew open what had bonn a dose game. 
"lie changed things," New Jersey coach Lawrence Frank said. "Look at the extra posses­sions game gave them in the first and second quarters. The energy he brought changed the whole tempo." 
Vince Carter, back in the start­ing li1wup, led New Jersey with 22 points, and Hkhard Jellcrson added 21. Jason Kidd had a sea­son-bnst 16 assists. 
"Wn aren't as good as Detroit," Kidd said. "We were playing against a very good team, and we didn't have any answers. It SIHmwd like they made every shot, or if they didn't, they got tlw oll'ensive rebounds and put that in."

Irish place fourth at OSU 
By CHRIS DOYEN 
Sports Writer 
In a competitive 13-team field in Columbus, Ohio, Notre Dame took fourth place this weekend in its last meet of the fall semester. The squad ended day one of the Ohio State Invitational in fourth and finished there after two more days of com­petition. 
Highlights from day one included a fifth-place finish for the Irish in the 200-yard freestyle relay. The relay team. which consisted of sophomore John Lytle, sopho­more Andrew Hoffman, fresh­man Thomas Van Volkenburg and junior Danny Lutkus, fin­ished with a time of 1:23.33. 
Lytle also swam in the 50­yard freestyle, where his finals time of 21.03 was the 14th best out of 66 swim­mers. In the preliminary race earlier in the day, Lytle post­ed a time of 20.92, finishing in under 21 seconds for the first time since last year's Big East championships. 
Sophomore MacKenzie LeBlanc swam to a 1Oth place finish in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 
4:30.67. It was the best time 
in that event for an Irish swimmer this season. 
Junior diver Michael Bulfin earned points for the Irish on day one by placing 16th in the 1-meter event with a score of 277.75. 
On day two, senior Andrew MacKay finished 1Oth in the 400-yard individual medley, recording a time of 4:02.97. In the subsequent event, the 100-yard fly, sophomore Ross Moore claimed a fourth-place finish with a time of 49.32. 
Lytle turned in another strong performance in the 200-yard freestyle relay, fin­ishing in 1:39.72, good enough for eighth place. 
Other top-1 0 finishers for the Irish on day two were the 200-yard medley relay team (eighth). junior Sam Pendergast in the 100-yard breaststroke (10th). two teams in the 800-yard freestyle relay (eighth and ninth). and Bulfin in the 3­meter dive (sixth). 
Moore again made his mark on the third day of competi­tion, breaking a school record in the 200-yard fly while posting a time of 1:4 7 .45. The mark was good enough for second place and is also an NCAA "B" qualifying time. 
The Irish posted top-1 0 fin­ishes in all five other events on day three to maintain their fourth-place position. Freshman Michael Sullivan placed ninth in the 1,650­yard freestyle while posting the fastest time of the year for an Irish swimmer. Sullivan also finished sixth in the 200-yard backstroke with a time of 1:48.80. 
On day three, Lytle posted yet another strong finish in the 100-yard freestyle, com­ing in seventh with a time of 
45.36. Daniel Rave swam the 200-yard breaststroke in 2:03.17, landing another sev­enth-place finish and earning a team best for the season. The top two teams for the Irish in the 400-yard freestyle relay finished sixth and 1Oth overall. 
The Irish compiled a three­day total of 401 points, while Minnesota took first overall with 1,168 points. Ohio State was second with 1,074 points, and Denver third with 429 points. 
Notre Dame will return to action on New Year's Day when it faces LSU in a dual meet in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

Miller takes first place as team finishes in third 
By SAMANTHA LEONARD 
Sports Writer 
The Irish placed third out of 12 teams at the Husky Invitational in Federal Way, Wash., over the weekend. During the three-day competi­tion, the Irish finished with 897 points. The host school, Washington, took first place with 1,369 points. 
USC finished in second place with 1,225 points. The Irish have now lost to the Trojans twice this season. 
The Irish had an impressive showing, with 16 swimmers making it past the preliminar­ies. The top swimmer for the Irish was freshman Amywren Miller, who claimed a first­place finish in the 100-yard freestyle. Miller notched a season-best time of 50.37 sec­onds and shattered her previ­ous best of 51.69. 
And Miller was not the only swimmer to record a season best this weekend. Junior Christa Riggins tied for sec­ond place in the 100-yard freestyle with a time of 50.53, topping her previous best of 51.23. 
Freshman Lauren Parisi took a second-place finish in the 200-yard backstroke with a time of 2:00.83. This time also marked a season best for the freshman. 
The Irish will next compete in a dual meet against LSU on Jan. 2.

NFL 
Peterson runs through Lions in Vikings rout 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS-Wearing a brace on his right knee and playing for the first time in three weeks, Adrian Peterson was a bit hesitant on the first few plays of the game. 
"I definitely wanted to go out and get that first hit and sec how it felt," Peterson said Sunday. 
Once he took a few shots from the Detroit Lions, some of which he felt were cheap, Peterson was off and running. So were the Minnesota Vikings, 42-10. 
The star rookie rushed for 116 yards and two touch­downs in less than three quartflrs of work and quarter­back Tarvaris Jackson contin­ued his steady improvement to lead the surging Vikings over the free-falling Lions. 
"I got choked up a couple times, so it kind of pushed my buttons." Peterson said. 
The favorite for Offensive Hookic of the Year showed he is back in a big way, but the Vikings suddenly appear much more than a one-man show. 
In the last three weeks, Jackson has shown poise, an accurate arm and command of the offense that simply wasn't there early in the sea­son, and Sunday was his best game yet. He was 18-of-24 for 204 yards and two touch­downs. and the Vikings (6-6) scored TDs on their first six possessions to win their third in a row and fourth in the last five games. 
"We feel like we're getting on a roll and we want to stay on that roll," Jackson said. 
The roll has the Vikings back in the thick of the NFC playoff picture, thanks in large part to a November swoon by the Lions (6-6) that has an all-too familiar feel for their long-suffering fans. 
Jon Kitna threw for 260 yards and one touchdown for the Lions, who have lost four in a row to waste a 6-2 start. A month later, the Lions are looking more like the hapless Motor City Kitties who started the season with more losses than any team in the NFL over the last six years. 
"Our boat's not very full, I know that. We don't have a lot of people left in our boat right now," Kitna said, referring to the sulking Lions locker room. 
''I'm talking about us in general. We are not heading in the same direction right now, as a football team." 
Coming in, the Lions talked about needing a sense of urgency to turn things around. But they showed nothing of the sort in a woeful effort. 
The Lions rushed for just 23 yards on seven attempts against the league's top­ranked run defense, commit­ted three personal fouls and were manhandled at the line of scrimmage. 
"It's a team that's gotten tentative," said Lions coach Rod Marinelli, who blamed himself for the loss. "Today, especially, we looked lethar­gic. The fundamentals aren't being executed the way I wanted." 
NCAA BASKETBALL 
Texas upends No.2 UCLA 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Damion James had stars in his eyes playing No. 2 UCLA at Pauley Pavilion. Not so much, though, that he couldn't finish off an upset victory for Texas. 
James dunked with 8 seconds remaining and the eighth­ranked Longhorns won 63-61 after blowing all of a 16-point, first-half lead Sunday in the Big 12/Pac-10 Hardwood Series. 
James and D.J. Augustin fin­ished with 19 points each, and the Longhorns (7 -0) survived their elosest game yet after win­ning their first six by at least 15 points. James had 10 rebounds for his second double-double of the season. 
"It's like a dream come true," said James, who led a Longhorn celebration at midcourt in front of 96-year-old former UCLA coach John Wooden and Denzel Washington. "Him and Denzel, wow, man." 
UCLA star freshman Kevin Love finished with 11 points and five rebounds after taking just six shots and getting benched for the final 2 minutes. 
"I need to seek the ball out more," he said. "I only played 24 minutes, but five rebounds on my part is unacceptable. I should at least have 10 rebounds every game." 
With Darren Collison guard­ing him, Augustin gave up the ball to James in the low post. 
"I stumbled, but I knew Damion was down there," he said. "I threw it up for him to rebound and put it up or finish it with a dunk and that's what he did." 
Collison played 39 minutes, his most in two games, and blamed himself for the last-sec-ond loss. 

"I reached for the ball instead of standing in front. My man had the help and they got the rebound," he said. 'The bottom line is we didn't play defense." 
UCLA's first loss of the season ended the Bruins' 25-game home winning streak. Luc Richard Mbah a Moute had 14 points, and Collison added 12 in his first start for the Bruins (7­1), who led by four with 3 min­utes remaining. 
"That wasn't fun," Love said. "It could be a good wakeup call for us." 
Mbah a Moute missed a 3­pointer in front of UCLA's bench at the buzzer. 
"I shot the ball knowing it was going.to go in, it just didn't go in," he said. 
UCLA became the highest­ranked opponent Texas has beaten in a true road game in school history. Their previous best win came over No. 4 Memphis in January 2006. 
With the score tied at 61, Mbah a Moute was fouled by Connor Atchley. The UCLA play­er's first attempt spun out of the basket, setting up the Longhorns' final possession. 
"That's on me," Mbah a Moute said. "I haven't been to the line a lot. I've been making them in practice." 
Josh Shipp added 11 points for the Bruins, who outscored Texas 36-26 in the second half after being stymied by its zone early.

McAlarney scores 21 points as team sets Joyce Center record 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 
Kyle McAlarney scored more than 20 points for the third straight game and Notre Dame tied a program-best Joyce Center winning streak in a 76­(, 5 victory over Eastern Michigan Saturday. 
It was the 24th straight win at home for the Irish. which equals a mark set by the 1973­74 teams. But Irish coach Mike Brey told his players not to rnst on their laurels. 
"I said, 'Congratulations. I'm gonna shake your hand next Saturday when you break [the rncordl." Brey said. "But we're very proud of that, Ithe play­ers! are very proud of that, they should be very proud of it. I'm very happy for them." 
After pouring in 25 points against Colgate last Monday, McAlarney dropped 21 on 8­of-1 0 shooting in the triumph over Eastern Michigan. 
"My confidence is real high and I'm learning as the games go on how to move without the ball better," McAlarney said. "My teammates have been doing a great job finding me. I have to credit my teammates for getting me those open shots." 
After jumping out to an early 
17-7 lead, Notre Dame fell 
behind 21-20 with 9:59 left in 
the first half when Eastern 
Michigan guard Carlos 
Medlock made an uncontested 
lay-up. 
The Irish then went on a 7-0 
run to take a lead they would 
not rPiinquish. Sophomore for­

15-foot jumpnr to give the 
Irish a one-point edge. After 
Easton Michigan turned the 
ball over on its next posses­
sion, Irish guard Ryan Ayers

who finished with 18 points 
and seven rebounds, hit

score 27-21. 
Eastern Michigan pulled within three points of the Irish with 4:35 left in the opening half, but the Irish closed the period with eight unanswered points. With the clock running down in the half, Notre Dame guard Tory Jackson rebounded a missed 3-pointer by Medlock and started a three-on-two break for the Irish. Jackson eventually found Ayers, who spotted up and made a 3­pointer to give the Irish a 43­32 lead going into halftime. 
"The shot right before half­time was a big-time shot," Brey said. "That really gave us great momentum." 
After the break, the Irish continued their run and poured in six more points before Eastern Michigan scored again. 
"We ended the first half and started the second half really well, which I thought was the key to the game," Brey said. 
Eastern Michigan never pulled within 10 points for the remainder of the contest. 
Brey said he was especially happy with his team's defense 
against the Eagles' perimeter threats, especially senior guard Jesse Bunkley. 
"The key for us was to not let them get going from the 3­point line and I think we did a great job," Brey said. 
The coach commended Ayers for locking down Bunkley, who came into the contest shooting 
44.7 percent from beyond the arc and averaging 15.4 points per game. The Eagles star did not attempt a long-range shot against the Irish and finished with only six points. 
"That's maybe the thing I'm maybe most excited about ­[Ayers! on Bunkley, absolutely taking Bunkley away," Brey said. "Bunkley's the guy that makes them confident and really gets them going." 
Eastern Michigan sopho­more forward Justin Dobbins scored a career-high 26 points. But it wasn't enough. 
"The llow of the game was excellent," Brey said. "The guys did a heck of a job tonight."

CHICAGO -Eli Manning's second pass landed in Brian Urlacher's hands. There was a fumble that led to a field goal, too, and just when it seemed his day couldn't get much worse, he threw an intercep­tion in the end zone. 
Then, everything turned around.

Teatn finishes in fifth place in DePauvv tneet 
Belles record several personal best times in early-season event 
By MARIE BUGNITZ 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's finished in fifth place this weekend in the DePauw Swimming Invitational, the best the Belles have ever done at the meet. 
"Mostly everyone had either 

their best times of the season 
or close to their best times," 
Belles junior captain Melissa 
Gerbeth said. "Attitudes were 
positive, and it was encour­
aging to get some reward 
from all the hard work we 
have been putting in." 
This meet differed from the 

Belles' previous meets of the 
season because it was an 
invitational that included 
both preliminary races and 
finals. Swimmers had to 
qualify in the top 16 in pre­
lims in order to make it to 
the finals. 
"The competition was pret­ty intense -there were swimmers of all speeds, so it was nice to see where you landed among that spread," said Gerbeth, who placed sixth in the finals of the 400­yard individual medley with a time of 5:01.20. 
Other key ·contributors for the Belles included several freshmen. Freshman Lauren Hartman placed 1Oth in the 50-yard freestyle. Iler class­mates Maggie Williams and Casey Niezer placed sixth and seventh, respeetively, in the 100-yard backstroke. Freshman Caroline Arness finished 1Oth in the 100-yard butterfly. 
The 400-yard "A" Free relay placed sixth overall. Gerbeth was very pleased with her team's effort. 
"Everyone swam their hearts out and were encour­aging and positive to their teammates," Gerbeth said. "The team definitely bonded after this meet."

Nevv York cotnes frotn behind to beat Bears 
ing blow. 
Manning led two late touch­down drives and Reuben Droughns scored on a 2-yard run with 1:33 remaining to lift the Giants to a 21-16 victory over the Bears on Sunday. 
Manning was awful for most of the game but delivered in the latter stages after throwing four interceptions the previous 
week  in  a  drubbing  by.  
Minnesota.  
"It's  easy  to  forget  bad  

plays," Manning said. "And to be a quarterback, to be a foot­ball player, you have to be able to do that. You have to be able to forget the week before. You have to be able to forget the play before and just move on and work out the next play." 
The embattled quarterback threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Amani Toomer, which was initially ruled incomplete, with 6:54 left to cap a 75-yard drive and cut the Giants' deficit to 16-14. 
"I knew I caught it." Toomer said. "And I knew (the replay) was going to look like I caught it, so it wasn't a problem. I don't know if it hit my arms or hands, but I was underneath it. I didn't even think it was that close." 
After the Bears (5-7) punted, the Giants launched a 77-yard drive that ended with Droughns running around the right end with 1:33 left. Manning hit David Tyree with a 24-yard pass and threw a 15­yarder to Plaxico Burress that put the ball on the 2. 
The Bears got the ball with 

1:28 remaining and marched from their 41 to the Giants 28, before Hex Grossman threw three incompletions -the last one broken up by James Butler.

Notre Dame had not allownd a tnam to tin the garnn after leading 2-0 in 175 straight matrhns bdorn Friday's contest. 
"It was fitting that Dukn camn back and tiPd it. and tlwn you saw our character to ronw back and win it." Waldrum said. "Nobody ever got diseouragnd wlwn Duke c:anw bark." 
Wnissnnhofnr had a difTnr­nnt takn on tlw Blun Devils' eomnhaek. 
"We likn to keep the games entertaining," slw said. "That was the ease tonight when tlwy came back and tied it." 
Blue Devils coach Bobbie Church said his players' lack of nxperiencc~ playPd a role at tlw nnd of the gamn. 
"We spent a lot of energy tying the game up and then trind to put somn fresh. but inexporicmced. lc~gs in there," Church said. 
Irish knnper Lauren Karas prnvented a goal in the fifth minute of the ganw when Blue Devils midf'inlder CJ Ludemann got frcw on the right sidn. Ludnmann drib­bhHI c·.losn and took a hard shot. but Karas eame ofT her linn and dove to her right to make tho save. Wnissenhofer opened tlw scoring in the 20th minutc~ aft~>r rneeiving a pass from Bock. wc~issenhofnr fl'inted around lwr dnf'cmdt\1' and took a shot that slipped to the right of l.ipslwr. 
"Brittany played a grnat hall and I cut it hack. saw wlwrc tlw goalkeeper was and placml it in thn right cor­ner," Weissnnhol'er said. "It was with my right foot, just like tlw two goals at UNC." 
Wnissnnlwfer now has four goals in tlw postseason, tlw sanw nutnhPr she had in the entire rc~gular season and Big Hast tournanu~nt combined as an ankln injury hampered lwr narly performanen.

Bod scored in the 52nd minute to give the Irish a 
two-goal eushion when she headed a Hanks corner kick undnr thn crossbar and out of l.ipsher's reach. After that goal, Church said, the Blue Devils changed their approach. 
"Whnn it went to 2-0, we just wan ted to get one back and put the pressure back on them," thn coach said. "Then wn really started to press hard and were winning balls in tlw midfield and running at thnir back line." 
And tlw increased pressure worked: Duke seored twice in fivn minutes.

In the 63rd minute, Ludemann got fren in the middiP of the field and fired a long shot that bnnt from right to left. out of' Karas' reaeh. into the left corner of the goal. 
"We should have closed that quicker and not given her that shot to strike the ball." Waldrum said. "But give credit to the kids, we didn't lose control of the gamn." 
After Hanks' goal. the Irish killnd the clock and sealed tlwir trip to thn semif'inals. The team was ecstatic to havn another chance at a championship after losing in last year's title game to North Carolina. 
''I'm just so proud or the team that we get to go to the linal four again," Hanks said. "I want to win a national ehampionship. To win it for our seniors will mean every­thing."

That was the same combination that opened the scoring for the Irish against Oakland. Except in that game, Lapira was the distributor and Yoshinaga the finisher.

goals behind to win late for the second straight game. Notre Damn erased a 3-0 deficit to HPJ a week earlier in a 4-:~ vic­tory. 
'Tm concerned about how 
we've been starting," Irish 
coach .lefT .Jackson said. "That's 
two games in a row where we 
spot the opponent three goals 
and l don't think we were emo­
tionally or physically sharp at 
all in that game." 

Nebraska-Omaha freshman Joey Martin scored the first two goals of his career to give the Mavericks a 2-0 lead. Sophomore Dan Swanson then found his linemate J.J Koehler in the low slot. and Koehler sneaked it through Irish goalie Jordan Pearce's pads. 
"When you get down :3-0, you're looking to do anything. Whether it's scoring a goal, get­ting a shot on net or starting some trouble after the whistle you have to do whatever you can to try to get everybody going," Irish sophomore center Kevin Deeth said. 
Deeth picked up a eoineiden­tal minor on his shift after Nebraska-Omaha's third goal when he was caught mixing it up with a Nebraska defense­man in the corner. The serum gave the Irish the spark they needed. 
Deeth broke up the shutout on an Irish power play with just under four minutes left in the second period. Junior center Erik Condra slipped a pass to Deeth. who found himself all alone and beat DuPont with a backhander. It was Deeth's third goal of' the season. 
With time running out in the second. the Irish caught a lucky break. .Junior center Christian llanson attempted to dump the puck from center ice, but it ric­ochetnd ofT a glass partition and went directly at the IWt. DuPont was ofl' his line looking to play the puck in the corner so he couldn't make the save. 
"That's my go-to move," Hanson joked. "I faked, got the goalie to bite, went to dump it in the corner and it went in." 
Notre Dame took advantage of the good fortune, taking the lead in the third period with goals from Condra and sopho­more Dan Kissel. Condra extended his scoring streak to six games with the goal. 
The Mavericks' leading scor­er. senior Mick Lawrence, tied the game again with 12 minutes minutn when his eross found sophomorn Dave Donahun. Donahun deposited tlH~ ball for a goal that was nearly identi­cal to the one J.apira set up for Yoshinaga against Oakland. 
Both Irish goals came against Santa Clara's baek-up keeper, Joseph Buttitta. who entered in the 47th minute after starter Kevin Klasila lnft with an injury. Klasila madn two saves in the first hall', but Buttitta didn't record a stop. 
"To bn honest with you, we were pretty sad when the first goalie went out," Clark said. "We thought he was looking really shaky. and our bench was hoping he would stay in the game." 
Irish senior keeper Chris Cahill. on the other hand, was his usual steady presence in th11 Notre Dame net. The keep­er made five saves to record his 11th shutout of the season. It was also his fourth career NCAA Tournament shutout, a Notre Dame record. 
Monday, December 3, 2007 
Clark, however. !'edt that Cahill's biggost contribution was hnlping break up Sanla Clara's crosses, most of' which wPre directPd at 6-foot-5 strik­er Jidi Ogunbiyi. 
"lie really snttled us," Clark said of Cahill. "lie handlnd traffie that carne into his an~a. lie gavo nw tho fooling that when he plays like that. nobody is going to beat him." 
With the win, tlw Irish brokl' the Broncos' 1S-game unbeat­en-streak. Santa Clara's last loss was on Sept. 7 to Brown. 
In anotlwr parallel to last season, the Irish will have to win on the road if they wish to reach tl11~ program's first-cwor College Cup -soecer's version of the Final Four. In 2006.

to go. The goal was Lawrence's eighth or the year. 
But with a little over two min­utes left. Irish junior Garrett Regan put the Irish ahead for good when he scored on a def'lection in front or the net. Senior center Mark Van Guilder took the initial shot from the point and Regan was able to get a stick on it in front. 
"I was just glad to step baek in the lineup and keep helping the team," Regan said. 
Regan returned to action Friday night after being side­lined with an ankle injury for several games. 
"I don't think he is at 1 00 per­cent yet. but he's a great energy guy and it's good to see him back on the ice," Jackson said. 
On Saturday, the Irish played with a sense of urgency that was absent Friday and let the Mavericks know they couldn't stake anothnr 3-0 lead when Van Guilder scored a short­handed goal just 3:31 into the lirst period. 
Thn cnntnr corralled the puck along the right-side boards in the neutral zone and fed a pass to Deeth, who was streaking down the left side. Deeth got Mavericks goalie Eric Aarnio to commit himself to Deeth's side, and then fired a pass to Van Guilder in the low right slot for an open-net goal. 
The Irish out-shot Nebraska­Omaha 12-4 in the first period, including five shots on a pair of 
wu 
fast-action power plays. On its power plays, Notre Damn worked the puek around tlw offensive zone with speed and accuracy, in contrast to the play-,it-safe, plod-the-puck­around-the-defense approach the Irish have taken most of the season on the man advantage. 
Jackson said that facet of the game looked more active because a third power play unit was ereatnd in praetiee, increasing eompntition and per­formance. 
Notre Damn extended its lead to 2-0 with 17:25 remaining in the second period on an odd redirection by Hanson in the high slot. Freshman defense­man Teddy Huth took a one­timer from the left point that changed paths after it deflected off Hanson's skate and slid untouched into the open right side of thn net. 
The Irish had the eomf'ortabh) lead Nebraska-Omaha held the night before. 
"It's nice to play the game where you'ro not in fear of breaking down," Jaekson said. 
Ruth scored his first career goal to put the Irish up 3-0 lnss than a minute into the third period. Left wing Hyan Thang and def'ensmnan Ian Cole tlwn each added a tally to secure Notre Dame the 5-0 win.
