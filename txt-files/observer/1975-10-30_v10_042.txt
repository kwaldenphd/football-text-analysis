new graduate policy 



by Maureen Flynn Senior Staff Reporter 
Members of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology have 
voiced both praise and criticism for reorganization of the new 
graduate program and the approval of a new departmental policy 
on teaching loads and credits. 
Comments ranging from "disastrous" to "very promising" have 
been directed at the graduate program scheduled for im­
plementation in the spring semester. 
Under regulations passed last May in an executive session of the 
faculty, the program of graduate studies will be re-structured as 
team-developed seminars in four "core" and four "specialty" 
areas. Seminar offerings will alternate on a yearly basis and a 
limited system of electives will be offered by individual faculty th­
ree semesters out of every four. 
One department member, who preferred not to be named, listed 
the pros and cons of the seminar structure. "The student really 
profits," he said, "by getting two or three different views of a 
problem. We hope this will generate ideas among the students," he 
explained. "Instead of spoon-feeding them one professor's 
viewpoint, the presentation of different opinions will make them 
use their brains more." 
"My experience with seminars," he continued, "has been that 
some work and some don't. The student will get no more out of it 
than he puts in." In any class, the professor noted, "student input 
is just as important asthe professor's output."

professors offered courses on a rotating basis over a three or four

Notre Dame SAT scores stable 
by John Hannan Staff Reporter 
A nation-wide trend towards lower SAT scores has not affected the quality of students in the Notre Dame community, according to Larry Burns of the Amission Of­fice. 
"Ifanything thequalityof students we have been getting at Notre Dame has been rising over the last 
few years," said Burns although he admtttl:'d it was not a substantial increase. 
He felt the stability of Notre Dame SAT averages was due both to the work of the Admissions Office and the high quality of students applying here. The average SAT score for an N.D. st­udent is 550 on the verbal section and 620 on the math section, with women being a little higher on the verbal score. 
He stated that the situation here at Notre Dame is the same at other schools with selective admissions procedure, like Harvard. He also noted that Notre Dame has found the SAT scores combined with the high school record to be indicative of success in college. 
Dr. Grande of the Freshman Year Office commented that drops in scores do not necessarily in­dicate poorer students overall. SATs also measure the educational experience of the student, not only their apptitude. 
He stressed the fact that students 
are being compared to a fixed reference group of 1948, with the average SAT being then set at 500. "We now have a wide variety of 
people  taking  the  test,"  stated  
Grande.  "In  1948 the ref erence  
group  was  of  a  higher  socio­ 

economic status." 
Grande also stated that another part of the problem could be that the statistics of the test aren't working. The tests are built on

From year to year the variance of one test's accuracy to the next test is a minor percentage, but added over a period as large as the last thirty years, these changes could distort the test results. The Educational Testing Service, with whom Grande is associated, is 
trying to solve these problems. 
Grande felt that the factor most likely causing the decline is the way students are being educated.

The student saves $1.70 per game and realizes an overall savings of nearly 60 percent by purchasing a student season ticket according to Busick. 
Busick noted that thus far 3,9000 student tickets hadbeen sold to St. Mary's and Notre Dame students.

"Demand has increased tremendously" for tickets this year according to Busick. Busick noted that demand for season t­ickets had especially increased and he cited the larger number of Saturday games and the good schedule as reasons for this great­er demand. 
Adrian Dantley's decision to return for his Junior year and the fact that three good freshman had been recruited were among other reasons cited by Busick for the great ticket demand.

Quinlan case controversy examined at ND 
by Cathy Cannon Staff Reporter 
Misunderstanding over the term 

"euthanasia" is causing much of 
the controversy in the Karen 
Quinlan case, according to several 
Notre Dame law professors. 
The case involves a New Jersey 

girl in a coma since April 15. Her 
parents have petitioned the courts 
to allow the respirator now keeping 
her alive to be removed. 
Some have claimed if the court 

rules in her parents' favor, the 
precedent could be applied to the 
mentally retarded and the elderly. 
Stanley Hauerwas, an associate 

professor of Theology, said, "It is 
being claimed that this is a case of 
euthanasia but that is putting 
someone to death to let them 
escape pain. Here it would just be 
letting her die. There is a clear 
difference.'' 
Father Leon Mertensotto, also 

an associate professor of Theology, 
said, "The death blow has already 
struck; the respirator is merely 
prolonging the dying process.'' 
Law professor and Right to Life activist Dr. Charles Rice said, "Pope Pius XII said truly ext­raordinary means did not have to be used to sustain life. Both the Quinlan's pastor and the bishop of their diocese have said ex­traordinary means are being used. In that case I would be in favor of turning off the machine." 
Karen Quinlan was reportedly mixing alcohol and drugs on the day she lapsed into the coma. The combination of the two depressants can cause paralysis of the breathing and nerve centers. Brain damage results within five to ten minutes when a body has been deprived of circulation or respiration. 
This probably occurred in her case. Three neurosurgeons have examined Karen. All of them say her brain has suffered irreparable damage, turning her into a com­plete vegetable. 
Her doctors refuse to disconnect the respirator because they feel it would be an act of homicide. Karen is alive according to the current methods of determining death. Her EEG reveals some brain activity. She can breathe without the respirator for up to half an hour. Some of her reflexes still respond to stimulus. 
Types of t'Uthanasia 

In defending their positions, both Hauerwas and Mwensotto stressed the difference between active euthanasia and passive euthanasia. 
Active euthanasia involves administering a lethal dosage of a drug or withholding ordinary means of support, while passive euthanasia involves withholding extraordinary means of support. The problem with this is that no one has defined extraordinary sat­isfactorily. 
Mertensotto said if substantial benefit will result to the patient as a result of the treatment, it is not extraordinary. 
For example, a respirator would not be an extraordinary means of support to someone with pneumonia who would only need it for a week before being able to resume a normal life. 
He elaborated, "The facts of the this should have come to court. The law is still working with a primitive notion of death which does not correspond to medical practice today. I am hoping the 

law  will  distinguish  between  
euthanasia and  letting  someone  
die. I think this is the  one good  

thing that will come out of this case.'1 "The courts should not become 
since precedent has persuasive authority from one state to another." 
Mertensotto agrees with Kellenberg. He explained, "Since we need laws to protect life and prevent active euthanasia the courts are the proper bodies to decide to apply these laws. Cases such as this one can not be decided by the religious beliefs of the familv." 
Karen is alive according to the current methods of determining death. Her EEG reveals some brain activity. She can breathe without the respirator lor up to hall an hour. Some of her 
reflexes still respond to stimulus. 
Quinlan case are these: 1) she has irreparable brain damage, 2) she will always remain a vegetable, 3) no quality of human life exists. It seems that the patient is receiving no substantial benefit from the machine. In this case, it would be permissible to disconnect the respirator." 
Disagreement exists over bringing cases such as this one to court. Some say such an emotional issue should be decided by those directly involved, while others say because it is such an emotional issue it should be brought to court.

Advance individual effort 
Protestant Ethic idea discussed 
by Karilee Clark 

Staff Reporter Dr. Karl Weinstraub, Dean of Humanities at the University of Chicago. dealt with the idea behind 
the  Protestant  Ethic  and  
Franklin's  use  of  it  in  his  
autobiography,  in  a  speech  last  

night in Carroll Hall. Weintraub called the Protestant Ethic, "a uniquely American idea" in his 
talk before an audience of 50 people. 
The Ethic is a pragmatic ap­praoch "meaning whatever works, is good to do." It also deals with advancement of oneself through individual effort. 
Weinstraub went on to say that the idea of advancing oneself through working is the central theme of the Protestant Ethic. ''Man works to receive God's grace," explained Weinstraub. 
''God by his wisdom would save only a predetermined few, and not knowing ourselves who these would be, men would strive to prosper themselves out of gratitude," Weinberg quoted from Franklin's autobiography. 
Dr. Weinstraub ' quoted from Benjamin Franklin's autobiogr~phy on the idea of not wasting thme "Because of the horror of wasting time," Franklin wrote, "it gave rise to individual work.'' 
Although Franklin did not follow any one religion or belief, Wein­straub said, his ideas were along te lines of the Protestant Ethic.

mvolved in setting such stan­dards," Rice added. "The proper body is the legislature." 
Law professor Conrad Kellen­berg disagrees. "The legal in­stitution· is the proper body to make such decisions. But great weight should be given to the views of theologians and physicians," he said. 
"It might well be that legislation should be passed," Kellen berg added, "but family law matters are the province of each state so we would have 50 sets of laws governing the matter. It would be easier to do it by judicial decision 
The legal implications of the case are also in dispute. Some have 
claimed that this decision will involve the courts in other decisions on euthanasia or cause hospital beds to be occupied by the hopeless while other patients are neglected. 
"Depending on the test used by t­he judge in determining the case," Kellenberg said, "the implications would be wide and far reaching.'' 
Rice disagreed, saying, "This is actually a very limited case but more could be made out of it. The media has distorted the case and blown it out of proportion.''

Reactions mixed on new graduate policy 
(continued from page 1) Prof. Donald Barrett, director of the undergraduate program, said he is aware of such possibilities, but has a "generally favorable 
orientation  towards  the  new  
program."  
If the  new  graduate  program  

reslts in a shortage of faculty on the undergraduate level, Barrett stated "We'll comb the country for additional faculty. If we need more faculty and we don't get it, I may turn right around and reject the new system.'' 
"It could be a problem," he admitted, "but the solution is provided for," Barrett said. 
Increased teaching load 

Another departmental change connected with the restructuring of the graduate program concerns and credit. 
At a departmental meeting held Sept. 18, the faculty approved by a \'ote of 10-7 a "Departmental Policy Relating to Teaching loa~s and Credits" which sets the basiC teaching load for a professor at 12 hours or 4 credits per week. 
The policy also outlines criteria for reductions in the basic teaching load, according to the professor's involvement in research, professional  activities and the graduate program. 
"It may be advantageous to some faculty members who define teaching at their primary professional activity to opt for a 12­hour teaching load," the policy st­ated, "allowing them to give full

Both Despres and Barrett stated 

A minimum definition of this last that the direction of dissertations 
item, the policy states, would be the publication or acceptance for publication of three articles over a 
period of two or three years. 
Don't consider research 

A number of faculty members voiced concern that this definition of a minimum standard does not t­ake into account other forms of legitimate research, i.e. books, papers prepared for professional 
meetings  and  direction  of  
dissertations.  
Despres  indicated  that  the  

minimum standard is "only a guidelines." Ifa professor writes a book, for example, "he is well over the minimum requirement. The three years are taken as a period," Despres stated, "so that a professor who spends two years in 
is a normal part of graduate t­eaching and should not constitute research of itself. 
"Publications should follow naturally from the direction of dissertations," Barrett stated. "The faculty member accepts the direction of a grad student working in his area of interest and progresses in his own personal
growth and development. The dissertation is not an end in itself," he said. 
"Every graduate department across the country expects that kind of responsibility from its faculty," Despres stated. "It is in a sense the way scholars reproduce themselves. It depends on the nature of the professor's 
responsibility," he continued. "If a faculty member is directing five dissertations, that might call for a recution in course load." 

(continued from page 1) 
The Church would not be faithful to its pastoral task if it did not reach out to suffering people, the Cardinal declared. "The Church will need to give solace to people forced to live on the bitter fruits of injustice," he said and highlighted the title of the Bicentennial program "Liberty and Justice for All." 
Church as instrument of change 

Dearden said the major asset of the Church as an agent of social change is her pastoral presence in society. The Church lives with and ministers to people at every level oflife and in every area of the country. Moreover, the Cardinal stated, the Church lives in society is' the "vision of the kingdom" by which it measure the system and attempts to shape social life.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. <AP) 
Steven Soliah, an ander­ground companion of Patricia Hearst. was indicted Wednes­
day  on  a  charge  of ·robbing  a  
bank  in  which  a  woman  cus­ 
tomer  was  killed.  Charges  that  
he  harbored  Miss  Hearst  were  
dropped.  

The 27-year-old housepainter, who shared the house where 1\liss Hearst was found and was r·eported to have been her lover. appeared in a San Fran­cisco federal court less than two hours after a grand jury 
here accused him of taking part in an April 21 holdup of a Crocker National Bank branch. The robbery netted four ski­masked robbers $15,000 and left 
a -t2-year-old mother of four shotgunned to death. 
Soliah sat silently at the de­fense table as Asst. U.S. Atty. David Bancroft asked U.S Dis­trict Court Judge William H.

""We have to have some sort of uniform criteria." ROTC scholarships are funded by contributions from the Army, . Navy, and Air Force. These are not based on financial need, ac­cording to McCauslin.

WASHINGTON (AP) -Call­ing the results "surprising, per­haps even shocking," a govern­ment study reported Wednes­day that one out of every five American adults is functionally illiterate and unable to cope in today 's society. 
That means, the authors said, that 20 per cent or more than 23 million persons cannot read newspaper help-wanted ads, figure the best grocery buy or make a train reservation. 
Testing of some 10,000 adults aged 10 to 65 years of age dur­ing the last four years found that: 
-13 per cent or 15 million could not address an envelope properly for mailing.

Any St. Mary's student wishing to change her room or roommate for the second semester may register at the Housing Office from Tuesday, November 4 at noon until 5 pm Thursday, November 6, according to Nannette Blais, St. l\1ary's housing coordinator. 
Students must fill out a a "Room Change Request" form stating the held in San Francisco on $75,­000 bail.

"There are no vacancies right now," Blais said. Any changes depend on vacancies made by other students requesting changes or leaving campus.

"I don't need October break... I don't need October break... " 



Give Us 
This year's academic calendar is one that no one wanted, one that no one likes and one that must be changed. Everyone wants more days ·off. But unless the st­udents can unite behind a coordinated plan of action, they can expect only a repetition of the fruitless battles and administration trickery of previous years. 
One year ago today we were on October break. Now we are slogging through mi­dterms and many people are not sure they will make it through a semester relieved by only one four-day break. It is apparent by now that both students and faculty need more of a rest than the short Thanksgiving break gives. Dr. John Duggan, president of St. Mary's, recognized this quickly and gave St. Mary's students a special three-day weekend. Even Fr. Burtchaell, who has consistently opposed the students' views, favors a longer rest. 
There are, of course, several differ·tmt possibilities as to how that rest can be arranged, but if the students wish to have any success in the next round they are 
going to have to reach a consensus on a 
DOONESBURY 

a Break! 
feasible alternative to the present calendar. 
Student government, particularly . Academic Commissioner Mike Gassman, bears the special responsibility to determine and focus student opinion and to lead the fight in the Academic Council. Gassman has begun the battle with needed research and we urge him to push ahead strangly. 
Since March, 1972 at least five rounds have been fought over the fall calendar. Each has taken the form of Provost vs. Student Body. Last year the students momentarily thought they had achieved their goals only to discover that by a brilliant display of political cunning the "extended" break would last only four days. Fr. Burtchaell maintains he is only interested in fulfilling certain "object­ive" criteria but it has become clear that he has made the fight a point of personal prestige, as if he is determined to show the students who is boss. 
It is unfortunate but probable that this round, ·uke th last, will be another case of "us vs. them." And the students had best be ready.

Abortion and Women's Lib 
joe corpora 

by Garry Trudeau the observer 
Abortion exploits women. After centuries and centuries of being treated as objects, women are being presented the final mechanical insult as a constitutional right. The strange com­pulsion for abortion is in reality the ultimate exploitation of women by immature men: technocrats, generally, imbued with a myopic sense of social awareness and unable to interpret or control their own sexuality. 
NOW (National Organization for Women), has been in the forefront screaming and pleading for abortion as a woman's right. This organization has also been quite vocal in favor of the pill and the IUD. They claim that women have the right to control their bodies. First off, I was unaware that they are out of control. Secondly, women who advocate abortion, the pill, the IUD, as a means of controlling their bodies would do well to acknowledge that it is men who are making millions of dollars performing abortions. It is men who are making more millions of dollars dispensing the pill or inserting the IUD. 
Thus men are making millions of dollars on women trying to control their bodies. It is the woman who has been deliberately misled by the male-dominated medical profession into thinking that abortion is just a simple operation. The serious physical and psychic consequences of this self-serving deception are muted despite a wealth of medical literature from the United States and foreign countries. 
Women, in the name of liberation, use pills, drugs, plugs or ex­
tractors to control (?)their bodies. Who is liberated? Abortion, the 
pill, the IUD, all have done more for men than women could have 
ever dreamed possible. They have and continue to exploit women. 
Abortion the pill, the IUD have liberated man, freeing him from 
any responsibility for his actions. 
Some women do believe, however, that abortion has liberated 
them. I cannot agree with this statement. I have just shown how 
abortion has liberated men more than women. I also spoke with 
Pat Goltz, the president of Feminists for Life. Pat was a member 
of NOW but was kicked out because of her pro-life stance. Mrs. 
Goltz says that women who have chosen abortion as an alternative 
to giving birth, turn very bitter at pro-life people. They become 
angry with themselves. She has seen women, totally unprovoked, 
manifest a real hate for pro-life people. The pro-abortion feminist 
has everything inside her and vents all her feelings on the nearest 
pro-life person. When someone is living with anger in them they 
are totally turned off to the Spirit. She desensitizes herself and as a 
result loses feeling for her fellow man. This is certainly not any 
type of liberation. 
Women are responsible, adult human beings, and should be 
j
treated as such and should behave as such. Feminists for Life have 
no quarrel with men. 'i'hey do have a problem however with some .I 
overgrown male infants who think of women as soft toys. Women 
are dangerous playthings likely to cause a condition known as 
fatherhood. While this is a highly satisfying state for mature men, 
it is extremely distressing to mama's boys and playboys. 
As a result of women's liberation (?) bunnies can now be ren­dered fool-proof. Should pills, chemicals, loops and harpoons fail, man can work over woman with a vaccuum cleaner, a curved knife, salt poisoning or major surgery. Her, Not him! Liberation? For whom? It is she who is taking thee pill or carrying the IUD or, going to the hospital for the abortion. Think about this seriously for a minute. Who is really liberated? 
Women's Liberationists who believe in abortion as a woman's right would do well to realize that since roughly 50 percent of the unborn are baby girls, half the abortions kill their sisters. It is inconsistent to demand rights for themselves and then to deny them to their offspring. Unborn women have rights also. 
No woman should be ashamedof her brains; starving, stunting or mutilating them to bolster the vanity of an insecure male. Neither should she mutilate her body to satisfy his lust, for the right to be a whole human being includes the right to one's full sexuality. A woman must not be ashamed of her body because it is constructed so as to make her a mother. This is not some unfortunate ab­normality in women, but a priceless gift inseparable from her humanity and personality. 
In this International Women's Year, women must seek their true ideatity. Women cannot deny that they are the givers, the nur­turers, the protectors of life. Women are the given creators of a nation's strength, for no nation can rise higher than the women who are found within it. 
Women must deny violence a legitimate place in our society by 
rejecting the first violence --abortion. The women of this society 
must say to overgrown male infants that the game is over. You can 
no longer exploit our bodies either in your centerfold or in your 'hospitals.

your best companion to sports and games 
Some day you may be sitting around in your room playing sports trivia with some of your buddies, and one of them might ask you who Citation's grandfather was. If you happened to have glanced at your copy of The Oxford Companion to World Sports & Games a little earlier, you'll astound your friends by rattling off the correct answer, HvnPrion. 
Edited by John Arlott, an E.11glish cricket correspondent, this 1143 page sports encyclopedia offers every available piece of information on nearly every (and you would be hard pressed to find omissions) sport or game under the stars. Just think of everything you'd like to know about any sport you know of, then multiply

Somewhere between J.D. Salinger and James T. Farrell is John R. Powers, author of Thl' Last Catholic in America. He stands between them representing a literary genre, producing autobiographically-based ficton which details the maturing of an adolescent male in an alienating, naturalistic inviroment. The protagonists are represented very much the same by all three authors, and where Holden Caufield resembles Studs Lonigan, the character of Eddie Ryan emerges, the protagonist of Do Black Patent Lt'ather Shoes Really Reflect Up? 
From the title ofPowers' latest work can be determined the nature of his story. Powers attempts to become the Philip Roth of Roman Catholicism by .satirizing the Catholic Elementary-school up­bringing. He takes his material one step further here, however, and gives us this synthetic character ( who is also the narrator) emerging from his elementary education (detailed in The Last Catholic in 
Amt>rica )) and shows us (subjectively) his odyssey through adolescence. . 
But Eddie Ryan has some problems: one of them being his trouble coping with the Catholic didacticism of his up-bringing: 
Tht' vast majority of Catholic high schools 
in the Chicago area were not 
cot'ducational. The Church hierarchy 
probably felt that both sexes could con­
centrate bt>tter on their school work if the 
othl'· sex wasn't around. Most likely the 
Church would try to get your mind off food 
by starving you to dt>ath. . 
nd as is witnessed by this passage, he IS skittles. It's intention is ''to help the reader understand a sport when he wat-· ches it for the first time", and though some of the passages get bogged down in the complex description of rules and equip­ment <it is much easier to learn about a field goal by watching than by describing it in words), the descriptions are so complete that one inevitably gains from reading them. 

Sports and games are usually introduced with an explanation of the object, method and rules of each sport. A history of the evolu~ion of the sport is then given. In major sports such as football <to which 80 pages is devoted, the most on any sport) the history is extensive. The Eton Wall Game, an early form of football played at Eton school in England and where an Elm tree was used as a goal, is just one of the types described in the evolution of the game. The volume traces basketball's roots to the Yucatan peninsula where a game called pok-tapok was played before stone statures of Gods (primitive 
television sponsors, no doubt). The sport 
is then updated to present times, and this 

less than sympathetic with the Catholic 
Church. Thus the title. It is derived from 
the myth as taught traditionally by the 
nuns in Catholic schools that girls who 
wear black patent leather shoes are 
virtually "exposing" themselves to the 
boys around them. The reflection off the 
shoes of a young lady's vaginal area 
(although cloaked in underwear and · darkness) might virtually court and insure her rape. 
Yet Powers has a point, and one we are 
certainly forced to agree with: that our 
outlook of the world, of good, evil, life and 
love, was perversely distorted by those 
Catholic mentors of our childhood. But 
who, having gone through twelve years of 

their influence, has not thought of this 
before, and has not been outraged by it? 
Powers almost believes he is granting us 
this insight and wishes that we laugh with 
him at his juvenile descriptions. The 
response, however, is not one of genuine 
laughter. His comic attempts are cheap 
ones, and represent the primary purpose 
for this "literary" effort. 

Through the invention of Holden Caufield, Salinger once gave us what Powers is attempting to re-create here: the sensitive and sometimes comic ub­servations of a maturing young male, and even in i.onigan the character of Studs twho, like Ryan, is also the product of Catholic education, Irish parentage, and Chicago's South side) is more professionally and genuinely rendered. Powers fails at sophisticated literary style and form. He succeeds instead with providing his audience with a hastily­written and commercial novel they can read at their leisure without the ex­pectation of literary craftsmanship, and­without much thought given to the sin­cerity of either the author or his character. 
Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Ht'flect Up? is still, however, a somewhat enjoyable work of light reading. For those of us who were the products of Catholic education, we can occaisionally laugh at the unfolding absurdities in the life of Eddie Ryan. Or we can chuckle, at least, if we cannot laugh.

\exhibition! 
indiana artist working in taos 
"Victor Higgins: An Indiana Artist 
wm!ring in Taos, New Mexico", the recenu.>· opened exhibition in the Notre Dame Art Gallery, has already excited I more interest and COmment than any Other .in recent memory. Judging by the :reputation Indiana artists enjoy in some local circles, the quality of this show is apt 
to prove a surprise. 
Higgins was born in 1884, in Shelbyville, 
Indiana and educated in Chicago, but in 
1914 he took up residence in Taos, New Mexico, and remained there until his death in 1949. Though its fame as an art center has diminished with the years, in 1920 Taos was a got-bed of intellectual activity, attracting such people as D.H. Lawrence a"'nd John Marin. Into this, Higgins brought a set of skills polished by years of s.tudy in The Art Insititute of Chacago and in Europe. 
Several artists of varying degrees of 
proficiency preceded him; many more 
were to follow. But none, not even Higgins, 
until now achieved a lasting reputation 
outside the Southwest. The reasons for 
this are several. The first is simply the 
distance which Taos is from New York, 
America's traditional art center. Added to 
this is the distrust New York still has for 
Art produced outside of its own circles, a 
distrust amounting at times to bias. But 
the Taos artists themselves share part of 
the blame for this lack oflastingattention. 
In painting an area of such gradeur and 
magnificence as the New Mexican land­
scape, there is a tendency for the painter 
to let Nature do the work for him or he. 
The tendency is to paint masterful sub­
jects later than to do masterful painting. 
In addition, many of the Southwestern 
painters worked with Indian subjects and 
models, and became caught up in the 
"romantic illustration"-style that 
characterizes so many artists who 
attempted to capture "the noble red man" 
or "the dying West" on canvas. It is a 
smooth, professional style, but does not 
make for great art. 
Victor Higgins himself narrowly missed 
falling into this trap. Like the other artists 
in Taos a at the time, Higgins during his 
early period worked almost exclusively 
with Indian subjects. And in some pieces 
he came close to doing the "pretty sort of 
paintings that the critics rejected so 
strongly. But inothers,Higgins was doing 
something with the Indianalmostunique at 
the time. He took away the artificial 
'noble' characteristics, and showed the 
Indian as a human being in isolation. 
"Fiesta Day", a large painting of an In­
dian on horseback, is particularly 
illustrative of this.

It is the type of book you will open up to glance through or look up one bit of in­formation, and most likely you weill find vourself leafing through it a will deal ionger then you planned. It's awesome presentation of sports facts and its equally amazing variety and uniqueness make it more than worthwhile. .. 
If the price tag scares you, remember that this book is one that could and should last you the rest of your life, a handy reference with little to be desired. 
If you love sports, you'lllove having this \'olume around, and if your interest is only passing, the Oxford Companion to World Sptll'ls and Games might make it more than that. 
TilE OXFORD COMPANION TO WORLD SPORTS & GAMES, edited by John Arlott, Oxford llniversity Press, $29.95. 
Still, Higgins' escape from Southwestern romanticism was a narrow one. His talent as a painter was simply too great for him to fall into formuae. It was his later development, however, that ensures him a place in American Art history. An example of the new direction he was beginning to explore is ''Circumverences'' ~ a semiabstract piece and probably an allegory of World War I. 
But the real developments came as 
Higgins  turned  more  and  more  to  the  
landscape for inspiration.  Gradually, as  
in  paintings  like  "Taos  Pueblo",  the  

figures grow smaller, receding into the background until they become only another element of it. Finally, the land­scape takes over completely. 
It was at this point, too, that Higgins turned to watercolors for a more spon­taneous form of expression. His water­colors are quite possibly as fine as any ever produced in the Americas, including those of John Marin. "The Apple Or­chard" and "Arroyo Hondo" are lan­descapes of exuberant spirit and color, and impressive achievement for an artist anywhere. 
But these are merely the foundation for the final series of which Higgins executed, a group of small oils entitled "The Little Gems , a number of which appear in the exhibition. There is no doubt that these rank with the finest landscape art ever done. They are oils done in quick, con­tinous brushstrokes, carrying into the oil much of the spontaneity of watercolor. Theyare captivating pieces, enough to assure Higgins' position even if ,he had done nothing else. 
This one-man show is evidence of the new wave of interest that is now sweeping the country in the pioneer Taos painters. These wen men who, whatever else were attempting to found an indigenous form of American Art. It is now being discovered that they were perhaps closer to the mainstream of artistic development than has ever been imagined. And Higgins, clearly, is head and shoulders about the rest of the Taos group. 
In any age of time, Higgins would have been an outstanding painter, he was that good. But the fact that he chose to work in the Southwest has obscured him until now. The Notre Dame show, open inthe O'Shaughnessy Hall Gallery until 21 December, contains some bad work. But this serves only to underscore the quantity of excellent painting that Higgins did in his life. In many respects, including lay-out and design, the "Victor Higgins" retrospective deserves to be classed with the best the Notre Dame Art Gallery has ever presented.

In 1970, when Ziggy was tak­en for his first walk since his 1941 incarceration, Lewis was among those coaxing the ele­phant into the open with ba­nanas. 
A 50-feet chain restrained Ziggy as the huge elephant lumbered down a backdoor ramp. He was outside for an hour and a half, squinting at the sunlight. Lewis said at the time that Ziggy "remembered me, first by his sense of smell, then gradually by sight."

Lectures next week 
Dr. Donald P. Kommers, 
professor of government and int­
ernational studies and director of 
the University of Notre Dame's 
Center for Civil Rights, is coauthor 
of a new edition of "The Gover­
nments of Germany." 
The book was first published by the Crowell Company in 1961 and has been revised by Kommers and Arnold J. Heidenheimer of Washington University in response to ahighlevel of continuing interest in German politics. 
The increasing importanceof the comparative approach in education, rather than the narrow focus on a single government or program, is reflected in the bok, one of a series released by the publisher. 
Areas of special concern for 
Kommers inthe book include the 
molding of modern Germany, 
society and economy in east and 
west Germany, elections and 
\'Oting behavior, judicial politics, 
politics in the German Democratic 
Republic, and a resolution of the time that the elephant was in that state." 
A Ziggy Fund, sponsored by the Chicago Zoological Society, raised enough money to build him a secure compound. Ziggy finally got his independence on July 4, 1973, to wander un­shackled while hundreds of children cheered. 
Once they tried to introduce Ziggy to Widget, a 17-year-old female, but he got into a trunk­pulling fight with her through the bars. 
Then on Christmas 1972 he got a girl friend as a present. Minnie was 12 years younger, three tons lighter, and at eight feet tall at the shoulder, two 
feet shorter. It turned out to be a platonicfriendship. 
Ziggy never was quite the same since he stretched too far across the 10-foot moat sur­rounding his compound last March and fell into it head first. Workers made a ramp with 42 tons of gravel so the elephant could extricate himelf. 
Ziggy stood in the moat all night long watching the work­ers. He ate only a little fruit instead of his usual diet of 400 pounds of hay. 
Then he slowly walked up the 
ramp.  His  left  tusk  was  
smashed  and  his  faced  was  
_skinned.

Pangborn claimed that Fisher used an illegal player. Their protest hearing will be held later on this week. Dillon was handed at least a tie for the South Quad title when Howard-St. Ed's failed to show up for the game. 
Howard did not even notify the league officials or Dillon's captain. The forfeit hurt Pangborn's chances for a first place finish. 
There was more action off the field than on as Keenan won a protest against Stanford Tuesday night. Stanford used an illegal player in its 6-0 win over Keenan last Wednesday night. The reversed decision kept Keenan's record perfect at 5-0 and assured

Violence in a very violent game is just an ex­
' '·!·
·,. pected occurance. In hockey, one of the most 
I physical games, it has been said for years that he speed of play, the body -contact, and the escalation of tempersin the course of the game is what ac­counts for the violence. Some people might take exception to that, and one man is Robert Marvin Hull. 
The Golden Jet, Bobby Hull left his World Hockey Association team Friday the Winnipeg Jets, temporarily in protest over what he considers ex­cessive violence in professional hockey. 
Hull, one of the greatest players in the history of the game, said he hoped that his action would dramatize his view that the sport has become too violent and would force WHA officals to take steps to curb the trend. Hull also complainedthatthe finesse is going out of the game, only to be replaced by growing brutality. 
The problem of violence in hockey has been on the lips of most observers of the sport for the past several years. Most trace its start back to the success that the Boston Bruins and the Philadelphia Flyers have achieved by using in­timidation tactics. 
Bringing the discussion closer to Notre Dame, Ric Schafer, Irish assistant hockey coach pointed out that "pro hockey is starting to create mosnters in the way the game is played." Schafer played for three weeks with the Minnesota Fighting Saints, and then by his own choosing picked up his skates and left American hockey for a chance to play in Olten, Switzerland. 
"I just didn't like the way the game was being ~

echo a concern for the game that they grew up

,. a junior from Scarsborough, Ont., who will be playing defense teamed with Jack Brownschidle agreed with Hull's action.

you'II get noticed and you stand a better chance of making it." Clarke isn't so sure as to how thegame can be de­violenced. "I guess thethingis to control the game better but that's easier sais than done." Pat Novitzki, senior defenseman from Far­mington, Minn. concurred with most· of what 
Clarke said. Both stated their concern with what happened to former Irish skater Mark Steinborn while in the minor leagues. Steinborn gave up hockey after being cut with a skate in a game and after watching the violence get out of hand in the minors. 
"In the minor leagues the violence gets out of hand much more so", Novitzk pointed out. "Everybody wants to play in the pro's and now it seems like beingvery physical is the easiest way to get there." 
As for the violence inthe collegiate game Novitzki feels that since this is a stepping stone to a chance to play in the pros that the . violence is slowly · escalating there. "After all, " he said, "people look at the Flyers and they see that they play very rough, get lots of penaltties and yet are still the champions, so you start to think that maybe that's the way to do it." 
As for handlingthe violence, Novitzki agreed with Clarke that trying to control the game better could be part of the answer, and getting the amount of cheap shots reduced." Yet no one answer will do. 
A different perspective to the violence was given by goal tender Len Moher. "I haven't really noticed in the collegiate ranks that the game has gotten that violent. I'm only speaking from one year here, but I don't· see that much brutality, some cheap shots yes, and tempers flare, but I don't see it all that bad." 
Moher agreed that a lot of the increased physicalness in the game is a result of the success achieved by Bruins and Flyers. "But its a physical game, and I really don't think that its allthatviolent. I think its filled with more clean-hitting than violence but sone violence does exist." 
Even though its hard to pin down what exactly to do about the violence, the people of Minnesota may have sown the the seeds for a solution. During the summer, Dave Forbes of the Boston Bruins went to trial in court for a stick fight involving Henry Boucha then of the Minnesota North Stars. The case against Forbes was formitable, yet it ended with a hung jury and nothing came out of the weeks of trial, except that the peoplein Minnesota are fed up withthe violence on the ice. 
Now, I believe the ball is squarely in the hands of Clarence Campbell, the league commissioner. Either he takes firm action against the brawls that occur on the ice, or he will be responsible for ruining hockey and reducing it to nothing more than mayhem on skates.
