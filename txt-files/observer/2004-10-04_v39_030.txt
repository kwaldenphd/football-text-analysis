Fan collapses on shuttle bus before game 
By CLAIRE HEININGER News Editor 
A 68-year old man died of what appeared to be a heart attack Saturday after he collapsed in a Transpo shuttle bus before the football game. 
University spokesman Matt Storin said the man fell at approx­imately 11 a.m. while aboard a bus scheduled to travel from the White Field North parking lot, which is located at the north edge of campus, to the Hesburgh Library Circle. The bus had not yet left the lot at the time of the emergency, Storin said. 
Another fan on the bus hap­pened to be a paramedic and immediately came to the man's aid, but was unable to revive him, said Rex Rakow, director of Notre Dame Security/Police. 
A South Bend Fire Department ambulance arrived on the scene to transport the man to South Bend Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Rakow said. It was unclear whether the man died instantly, en route to the hospital or after he arrived there. 
"It was a pretty close call," Rakow said. The man's wife was the only relative with him at the time of

Students wear orange arm­bands in support of AllianceND. 
By ELIZABETH CHEFFERS News Writer

Irish ambassador to the United States Noel Fahey spoke of the importance of maintaining good relations between Ireland, the European Union and the United States in an address at McKenna Hall Friday. 
Members of the Notre Dame community listened to Fahey optimistically evaluate inter­national relations. 
"We cannot be complacent when the stakes are very high, but as we go forward, I think we can conclude that our relationship is very strong, but we can make it stronger," Fahey said. 
Fahey also stressed the

INSIDE COLUMN 

Love lost 
I've fallen out of love with Notre Dame football. 
It didn't happen all at once, of course. You can't just go from adoration to apa­thy in a heartbeat. But as I strode out of the student section 
Saturday-at 11­something of the third quarter with­out an ounce of guilt-I knew my devotion was offi­cially dead. 
As I tried to wrap my mind around 

what went wrong, Claire Heininger 
the potential turn­
ing points multi-News Editor 
plied. 
Maybe Return to 
Glory spoiled me freshman year, when 
the Irish started 8-0, when TY was brand 
new and so was I. 
So was everything. 
Tailgating was a blur of overenthusias­
tic parents and unfamiliar parking lots, of 
spinach-artichoke dip and frostbite. The 
student section was bodies concentrated 
and bonding accelerated, and we forged 
unity through push-ups and pride. 
Football and I got pretty close that year. 
I bit my nails through the fmal minutes 
of the Michigan game, and continued 
chewing as we rushed the field. I tore off 
the Sports Illustrated cover, won $20 
from my little brother and thought the 
bounces would always go our way. 
My heart climbed the inside of my 
throat when the team charged the field at 
the Boston College game, boasting green 
that matched the sea in the stands. It 
crashed a few hours later, when the jer­
seys proved a jinx. 
But love doesn't fade because of famil­
iarity, or die because of disappointment. 
Maybe it goes deeper than that. Maybe 
the rift grew last year, when I was caught 
between my friends and my team. 
No longer freshmen trying to out-cheer 
one another, we went to the opposite 
extreme -being too good for it all. We 
were sophisticated and there to socialize. 
Shamrock tattoos and green glitter? 
Always. The Shirt? Never. 
It was mostly a facade. 
I still checked the score. I still read the 
wraps. And since I made sure to nourish 
it in secret. my football love didn't vanish 
because of neglect. 
Maybe I just grew up. 

Freshman year, two of my tallest, loud­est !fiends invented the "TYrone Shimmy," and spread its popularity by virtue of their visibility and swagger. Now they're on the Irish Guard. 
Last year, we packed two belligerent, blissful rows with thirty of our closest friends. Now half of them are abroad. 
But love gets better over time. You don't exactly outgrow it. I was back to square one -why did my fanaticism become so fragile? Was it all of the above? 
Then it hit me -I only have room for so many passions. 
I'm passionate about writing, about journalism, about its mentality of "com­fort the affiicted and aftlict the comfort­able." I'm passionate about my family, my friends and my boyfriend. I'm pas­sionate about Notre Dame, about its deci­sions, about its destiny. Somewhere along the line, football got edged out. 
It's not like I don't still get a rush of excitement when the gold helmets glint from the mouth of the tunnel, or feel pangs of disillusionment at a frustrating fumble. But my heart and soul can only stretch so far. 
My loves already compete. The Irish Jig just doesn't compare.

Snake In theater causes

HOUSTON -No, it's not a 3-D creature feature: A Houston movie theater ­one that was showing "Anacondas" among other films -has shut down while workers hunt for an 8-foot snake. 
A maintenance worker said he saw a snake about a week ago slithering along a wall, said Terrell Falk, a spokeswoman for Cinemark USA Inc.

Common Council, headed by District 4 n~pn~sentative Ann Puzzello, will convenc this afternoon to discuss thn concerns stem­ming from two informal mPPLings held in early SPptember. 
But while previous meetings havn been of a "town forum" format open to residents and area police to air their con­cerns, this meeting will focus on finding more concrete solutions to the problem, said Bill Kirk, associate vice presi­dent for student affairs. 
Kirk will represent the University at the meeting and answer questions. 
According to Puzzello, Kirk and neighborhood residents, off-campus parties that esca­late out of control -includ­ing students binge drinking, defacing property and screaming and playing music late into the night -have become more frequent during the last few years. 
Jackie Rucker, director of community relations for the University, said East Washington Street, Peashway Street, Notre Dame Avenue and Turtle Creek Apartments have been problem areas of late. 
Road closes for pipe adjustment 
FRIEDMAN fThe Observer A sign near the Stepan Center alerts the community to the closing of Holy Cross Drive. The road will be closed to repair a pipe In Notre Dame's chilled water system. 
B.y TERESA FRALISH 
Associate News Edi ror 
Beginning today until Oct. 22, the University will close Holy Cross Drive west of St. Joseph Drive from the Firehouse to lot A15, as part of a major road closure project needed to repair Notre Dame's chilled water system. 
"All the sources pump into a common pipe," said Paul Kempf director of utilities for the University. "That's the piece we're replacing." 
In a second phase of the project, officials will also close the intersection of Holy Cross Drive and St. Joseph Drive beginning Oct. 25. East-west traffic on Holy Cross Drive will reopen Oct. 29 while St. 

Joseph Drive at that intersec­tion will be until Nov. 12. The University has designated mul­tiple alternate entrances for buildings and departments affected by the construction. 
Holy Cross Drive is the main road that circles the edge of Notre Dame's campus. Kempf said when the project is com­pleted, repairs on the system will not likely be needed for several decades. 
Kempf said the road closures are carefully timed to occur around the Oct. 23 Boston College and Nov. 13 Pittsburgh home football games. He said repairs could not be completed during the normal summer construction period because the chilled water system is in use then. 
Officials also could not begin repairs during colder winter months and chose to complete the majority of the project in between the Stanford, Boston College and Pittsburgh home games. 

"We don't make chilled water all year round," Kempf said. "You can only shut it off when you're not using it. We just don't have any other opportunity." 
Kempf said he does not anticipate possible snow being a problem for the project. 
"Like any construction, there could be something that's unforeseen." he said. "We're more worried about tempera~ ture than we're worried about snow."

Success declared in Samarra 
SAMARRA, Iraq -Afraid to stray from home, residents buried the dead in their gardens Saturday as U.S. and Iraqi forces battled pock­ets of resistance in this former insurgent stronghold, where the American military said 125 rebels were killed and 88 captured in two days of fierce fighting. 
The American commander declared the operation a successful first step in a major push to wrest key areas from insurgent control before January elections. 
Elsewhere the rebels struck back, wounding at least five U.S. forces in three separate bomb attacks. In the latest in a string of kidnappings, militants claimed to have abducted and beheaded an Iraqi construction contractor working on a U.S. base. 
Gunmen vow more attacks 
JEBALIYA REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip ­Israeli troops and aircraft hit hard at Palestinian militants Saturday, killing at least 10 on the third bloody day of a massive Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip's largest refugee camp, as masked Hamas gunmen vowed more rocket attacks on Israeli towns. 
About 2,000 soldiers have taken control of a S-mile-deep chunk of northern Gaza to count­er militants firing homemade rockets into Israel. 
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said late Saturday that the army's mission was to stop the rocket fire "completely." 
He told Israel Radio, "This operation will continue as long as necessary." 
At least 50 Palestinians and five Israelis have been killed during the offensive, launched after a Hamas rocket killed two Israeli preschoolers in a town near Gaza.

"The entire string of attacks was a joint opera­tion by the ULFA and the NDFB," Inspector-General Khagen Sarma told The Associated Press. Sunday was the 18th anniversary of the NDFB, which is demanding a homeland for Boroland, a region that straddles both states. 
On Friday, the govern­ment offered a cease-fire to the Boroland rebels, part of their efforts to tame the various groups. 
Insurgent groups in India's northeast are push­ing demands ranging from independent homelands to autonomy within the nation. The rebels say they are seeking to protect their ethnic identities, and allege that the federal gov­ernment has exploited the resources in the mineral­and oil-rich region. 
The Indian government denies the allegation, and has already signed peace agreements with several groups. 
In return, the former militants have been given jobs and limited adminis­trative control within the Indian nation.

But one Naga separatist group engaged in talks with the government denounced the attacks. 
"We have set up a special investigating team and have got vital clues as to the identity of those behind the attack on innocent civilians," Kraibo Chawang, of the separatist National Socialist Council of Nagaland, told the AP. 
He said the assaults were "aimed at derailing and sabotaging our peace talks with the Indian govern­ment." 
Nagaland's death toll stood at 28 on Sunday, while Assam's rose to 29. No arrests had been made in the two states, police said. No immediate claim of responsibility was made. 
A bomb exploded late Sunday near a market in Bijni, 125 miles west of Assam state's capital of Gauhati, leaving three dead. 
Shortly afterward, anoth­er explosion killed another man and left 25 injured in nearby Gauripur along India's border with Bangladesh. 
Guerrillas set off a bomb at a tea plantation in near­by Borhat, killing a worker and wounding two others. 
Also in Borhat, suspected rebels targeted govern­ment-run Oil India Ltd.'s natural gas pipeline with a land mine blast. The extent of damage was not imme­diately known.

SpaceShipOne was scheduled to be launched Monday in an attempt to reach an altitude of at least 328,000 feet, or just over 62 miles, for the second time since Sept. 29. 
The choice of pilot for the flight remained a secret on the eve of launch, as it did last week. 
That flight and a test flight into space on June 21 were flown by Michael Melvill, who has been awarded the nation's first commer­cial astronaut wings by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
Melvill is one of four pilots who have undergone special training to fly SpaceShipOne. He had difficulty con­trolling the ship during the June flight but still reached 62 miles. Last week, he flew a perfect trajectory to an altitude of 337,600 feet, or nearly 64 miles, but the ship began rolling as it neared space. 
After a safety analysis, SpaceShipOne designer Burt Rutan posted preliminary information about the rolls on his Web site this weekend to address what he called the "incor­rect rumors" that have circulated. 
The first roll occurred at a high speed, about Mach 2.7, but aerody­namic loads on the spacecraft were low and decreasing rapidly "so the ship never saw any significant struc­tural stresses," he said. 
The spacecraft rolled so often because the rolls started as it was nearing the edge of the atmosphere and Melvill could not dampen the motions with the aerodynamic con­trols, according to Rutan. Since aero­dynamic controls don't work in space, SpaceShipOne is equipped with a reaction control system that uses jets of a compressed gas to con­trol movements .

ships between the United 
States and Europe were 
promising. 
"We can discuss issues on which we have differences, but in a way that doesn't undermine the relation­ship," he said. "There will always be divisions, times when countries have to act in their own best interests, but that should not stop part,ners from trying to coordinate." 
Fahey also praised Ireland's six-month term as president of the European Union. a position that rotates among member states. 
"We had, dare I say it, a very good presidency." Fahey said. 
According to Fahey, during Ireland's presidency. several important events occurred, specifically, the addition of 10 countries to the European Union and the completion of a new consti­tution for Europe. 
In addition to these events, Ireland's presidency oversaw close relationships with the United States on a cultural level and a family level, Fahey said. 
While 2003 was a period of unprecedented strain between Europe and the United States. based on Iraq. the Middle East peace process and the European Union summit was very effective, Fahey said. 

"At the end of our presi­dency in June. our prime minister and President Bush stood before the media and declared one of the most successful European Union su.mmits ever held< Fahey said. 
During the presidency, seven declarations were produced. Fahey said. These concerned ways to work towards peace in the Middle East, help people in Iran, counter terrorism, strength­en economic partnership, prevent weapons of mass destruction, aid the humani­tarian crisis in Sudan and combat diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. 
Fahey also discussed the "sloppy generalizations and dangerous stereotyping" that sometimes arise, saying many Europeans have mis­conceptions of Americans as "inward looking, chronically uninformed and self-inter­ested."

Stressing the importance of the young vote, the Chocola remind­ed students that the issues the candidates are debating would affect their generation most. 
"People in your age group don't vote," he said. "That's why Washington uses your money. That ought to get you and your friends out to vote, and to research the candidates." 
Chocola's hour-long speech received a warm reception from the College Republicans. 
"It was a great opportunity to hear a candidate in a pretty per­sonal setting, and apart from the sound bites you hear in the media," said Tom Rippinger, co­president of the College Republicans. 
Rippinger approved of Chocola's long-term strategies for cutting the deficit, which the Republican Party on the days prior to the election, talking to undecided voters via phone and also at the polls.

IN BRIEF Pilot's union reaches tentative deal 
CHARLOTIE, N.C.-US Airways and its pilots union agreed on a new labor contract Friday, a week after the company asked a bankruptcy judge to impose pay cuts, the airline said. 
The airline said the tentative deal, which would cut pilots' average pay 18 percent, would save the struggling carrier $300 million annually, part of the $950 million it now says it needs from all its unions to stay afloat. 
"This is a major step forward for our company, its employees, customers and all other stakehold­ers," airline President Bruce R. Lakefield said in a statement. 
The nation's seventh-largest airline declihed to disclose additional details, saying it was waiting for the Air Line Pilots Association to send the agreement to its members for ratification.

Drug study a disaster for Merck 
TRENTON, N.J.-Vioxx was already a big suc­cess as an arthritis pain reliever, but Merck & Co. thought it could be an even bigger seller. The drug seemed to have some cancer prevention qualities, so the drug maker began a long-term study to test it for that use. 
The strategy backfired for the company, which Thursday pulled Vioxx off the market. The study showed the drug doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke. At the same time, it sounded an alarm for the millions of people who took Vioxx. 
A similar case arose with Wyeth's hormone treatment Prempro two years ago. The huge Women's Health Initiative study -launched to show that the drug could protect older women from heart disease -unexpectedly found it did the opposite and more. Not only did it raise the risk of heart attack, it also brought a greater risk of stroke and breast cancer. Sales of Prempro and another Wyeth hormone drug, Premarin, have plunged by nearly half since then. 
Fastow may testify for Enron 
Former Enron Corp. finance chief may be called to defend company in trial 
Associated Press 

HOUSTON -Former Enron Corp. finance chief Andrew Fastow isn't a defendant or a prosecution witness in the first crimi­nal trial to emerge from the energy company's crash, but he could be called to testify for the defense -possibly as a hostile witness. 
Attorneys for four for­mer Merrill Lynch & Co. executives and two former midlevel Enron executives could call Fastow -a cooperating government witness -in the conspira­cy and fraud trial regard­ing an alleged sham sale of several barges to the bro­kerage in 1999. 
Prosecutors say Enron desperately needed the barge deal to book a criti­cal $12 million pretax fourth-quarter profit, but Merrill Lynch came through only after Fastow orally promised the bro­kerage that its $7 million investment in three elec­tricity-producing barges would be bought out with­in six months.

ELECTION 2004 
Monday, October 4, 2004 CoMPILED FROM THE OBSERVER'S WIRE SERVICES page 9 

CAMPAIGN NEWS 
Campaign could see surprises 
WASHINGTON -In the presidential cam­paign's closing weeks, Democrats are bracing for an "October Surprise," an event so dra­matic it could influence the election's out­come. The capture of Osama bin Laden, for instance. 
It's part of American political lore: the party out of power worries about a last­minute surprise engineered by the party in power. Now that October has arrived and the election is just a month away, speculation is rife among Democrats that President Bush and political mastermind Karl Rove have some tricks up their sleeves. 
"I assume that it will be something," said Ilouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California. "We have to be ready for that." 
With the war in Iraq going badly and peo­ple concerned about terrorism, there also seems to be a better than usual chance for a significant event beyond either party's con­trol. 
Both sides know the possibilities: a major setback in Iraq or Afghanistan, a terrorist strike against the United States, a nuclear test by North Korea, an economic shock. 
Kerry says Bush made it difficult 
for the average American 
WASHINGTON -John Kerry on Saturday looked to frame the next presidential debate in a speech criticizing President Bush's eco­nomic record, but also tried to get in a final word about their last face-off by declaring himself the winner and Bush a liar. 
"George Bush lost the debate," an announcer says in a television ad Kerry's campaign unveiled Saturday. "Now he's lying about it." 
The Democratic presidential candidate's accusation comes two days after his first debate with Bush, when he told moderator Jim Lehrer that he avoids saying that the president is lying to the American people. 
"I've never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then," Kerry said. "And I try not to, but I'll nevertheless tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American peo­ple." 
Kerry spokesman David Wade said the Massachusetts senator's new ad will run at least in all the places where Bush airs his own new ad called "Global Test." The Bush ad is scheduled to go on the air Monday on national cable networks and in select local media markets, 
Bush derides 'Kerry doctrine' for 
outsourcing America's security 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -President Bush on Saturday ridiculed what he called the "Kerry doctrine" as a dangerous outsourcing of America's security, seeking to poke a hole in Sen. John Kerry's debate performance with what advisers see as his rival's biggest mis­cue. 
"When he laid out the Kerry doctrine, he said that America has to pass a global test before we can use American troops to defend ourselves," Bush said, drawing loud boos from a friendly crowd at a National Association of Home Builders meeting and later from campaign-assembled audiences in Mansfield and the Akron suburb of Cuyahoga Falls. 
"When our country is in danger, it is not the president's job to take an international poll, the president's job is to defend America," Bush said. 

Understudies to face off Tuesday 
Dick Cheney -John Edwards debate pits experience against exuberance 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Sandwiched between high­er-octane presidential debates, this week's matchup between Sen. John Edwards and Vice President Dick Cheney pits the Democrats' chief of cheer against the Republicans' shrewd and serious second­in-command. 
The presidential under­studies meet Tuesday at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland for their only debate of the campaign. Their style and substance couldn't be more different, giving each plenty of material to try to under­mine the other and have an impact, however small, on the national campaign. 
At 51, Edwards is a boy­ish-looking Southerner holding his first elective office who relies on his skills as a former trial lawyer in gauzy campaign speeches and feel-your-pain encoun­ters with voters. At 63, Cheney is a balding Westerner with a long gov­ernment resume who has embraced the vice presiden­tial nominee's traditional attack-dog role with relish. 
Cheney, with a no-non­sense delivery from the side of his mouth, focuses on the continuing danger from ter­rorist attacks as reason to keep President Bush at the nation's helm. Edwards, flashing a high-wattage smile, emphasizes his work­ing-class roots in offering a can-do vision of a John Kerry presidency. 
While vice presidential debates typically have little influence on the race over­all, there could be extra interest in this faceoff given the stark contrast between the rivals, Cheney's status as one of the most powerful vice presidents in history and the intense criticism he has drawn from Democrats. 
"It's more a curiosity than a dealmaker or dealbreak­er," said Timothy Walch, director of the Hoover Presidential Library and an expert on the vice presiden­cy. 
Edwards' challenge is to rattle his opponent and try to feed the Democrats' characterization of the vice president as pulling Bush too far to the right.

PHOTOS BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Edwards, with proven skill at lobbing sharp attacks without turning off the charm, can draw on more than two decades of court­room practice at cajoling juries to side with personal injury complainants. 
But he must avoid coming off as a young upstart who is disrespectful of an elder statesman. If the North Carolina senator goes over that line, he will play into the Republican argument that he lacks the gravitas and foreign policy experi­ence for the job. 
Cheney, who served as President Ford's chief of staff at age 34, spent five terms in Congress and served as secretary of defense during the 1991 Gulf War, will be hard to unnerve. 
He could well face ques­tions about allegations of conflict of interest that arose after Halliburton Co., which he once led, won no­bid contracts in Iraq. Other likely topics include his insistence that Saddam Hussein had ties to the al­Qaida terrorist network and that a Kerry victory would make the nation more vul­nerable to a terrorist attack. 
Experts say the caricature of Cheney is so extreme that people will be pleasantly surprised if he cracks a few dry witticisms and appears reasonable, as he did in a good-natured debate with Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Lieberman in 2000. 
"People have such a nega­tive view of him, I like to joke that all he has to do is show up without horns," said Paul Light, professor of public service at New York University and author of a book on the vice presidency. 
Cheney also must gauge how far to take his attacks: He could try to paint Edwards as a money-chas­ing trial lawyer, or skewer him on his Iraq votes, but he needs to avoid turning off voters by appearing too extreme. 
Edwards, who has never debated one-on~one, rarely gets defensive. But with a reputation honed in the multicandidate primary debates as the nice guy in the race, he could suffer if he doesn't effectively answer when attacked.

"I believe that no one who works full time should who wants to work can find a job. I would consider have to raise their children in poverty.

HAITI 
Unrest continues in post-hurricane Haiti 
Associated P~ss 
POHT-AU-PHINCE. Haiti ­Gunfire erupted in a slum teeming with loyalists of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on Sunday. sending people scattering through trash-strewn streets following days of political clashes that have Jell at least 14 dead. 
Hesidents said men fired into the air, stole food from market vendors and burned tires in the street<; in the slum of La Saline. 
The unrest came a day after police arrested Haiti's Senate president and two other pro­Aristide politicians following a six­hour standoff in a radio station. Justice Minister Bernard Gousse told reporters the three were sus­pected of being "intellectual authors" of the violence that erupted Thursday during demon­strations demanding Aristide 's return. 
The politicians. who insisted they were innocent. were led out in handcuffs from the offices of Hadio Caraibes Saturday night after a judge entered to negotiate their surrender. 
Gousse said police found in one of their cars an Uzi submachine gun and a T65 assault rifle. which are illegal in Haiti. "They're peo­ple who are barbaric and violent," he told reporters. 
Pro-Aristide groups criticized the arrests, saying police didn't have a warrant and had planted the weapons. 
!Ieavy gunfire rang out Saturday night and Sunday in parts of Port-au-Prince. No one was reported killed, but streets remained blocked with over­turned wooden market stalls in some areas. 
Tensions have erupted as the impoverished country struggles to recover from floods unleashed two weeks ago by Tropical Storm Jeanne, which killed more than 1,550 and left some 900 missing, most presumed dead. 
In the hard-hit northwestern city of Gonaives on Sunday, resi­dents brought in two emaciated men found semiconscious on the ground to a clinic run by Argentine troops. Doctors said it appeared the two hadn't eaten in several days and had psychologi­cal trauma -one because he lost relatives in the floods.

WASHINGTON-The world's economic powers, which ended three days of meetings Sunday, insisted they are moving closer to a deal on debt relief for Iraq and other poor nations even though an agreement has proved elusive.

There is a darkness plaguing the safety and purity of the United States of America. This acrimonious evil was borne from the very innards of the dark lord Beelzebub, raised in the deepest 
chasms of Hades ~y Joey Falco 
an army of demomc

Falco

pits of Hellfire by a 
malicious horde of 
diabolical professors with malevolent 
names like Hitler, Stalin, Cassius and 
Judas. He is the fallen angel Lucifer 
incarnate and is surely right now 
employing his blackest artifices to 
destroy the sanctity and beauty of our 
great country. 
I am writing, of course, about the most notorious and villainous terrorist to ever step foot upon God's green Earth-Cat Stevens. 
For decades, his efforts to spread evil and pestilence throughout the world in the form of music-that melodious vehi­cle for death and destruction so often inspired by the very demonic muses who also motivate theft, murder and rape­have luckily not gone unnoticed by the United States government. Their wise and righteous decision to detain the unholy fiend as he attempted to land at an airport in this chaste and virginal nation may have saved the lives of mil­lions of innocent Americans, and the Department of Homeland Security, or the American wing of the Knights Templar, as I like to call them, can notch up anoth­er victory in the blessed crusade against terrorism. 
A mere look back at the ignominious life of this wretched embodiment of dark­ness plainly shows why he is a clear and present danger to the safety and well­being of the American people, and cer­tainly justifies his being sent immediately back to London after being detained in a Maine airport. 
Yusuf Islam, or the Artist Formerly Known As Cat Stevens. rocked the foun­dations of the musical world in the early 1970s through his plainly blasphemous and warmongering songs like "Wild World," "Peace Train" and "Morning Has Broken." Clearly, the lyrics to these Odes to Terrorism show an explicit desire to bring down the pillars of American liber­ty thro11gh militant Islamic tactics, and 
his wicked, slanderous tongue must be kept out of the United States at all costs. 
"Now I've been cryin' lately, thinkin' about the world as it is. Why must we go on hating? Why can't we live in bliss?" 
Blasphemer! Heretic! Minion of Satan! How dare he utter these incendiary words of anti-American violence under the guise of a folk tune entitled "Peace Train?" Thankfully, for the sake of the many innocent. defenseless women and children in this great nation, the brave men left with the daunting task of maintaining our home­land security managed to see through the paci­fistic favade of Cat Stevens' lyrics. 
"What were you goingto do with that 'Peace Train' of yours, Yusuf Islam? Hijack it and crash it into a sky­scraper?" metaphorically shouted Homeland Secretary Tom Ridge. "I know your tricks, sin­ner!" 
Sure. some Islamic-sympathizers in the United States ­who accordingly should also be added to all terror­ist watch lists -might argue that Islam's life seems to suggest he does not secretly desire to bring down American democracy through devastat­ing violent action. After all, he did re­record a song last year to raise money for children affected by the U.S.-led war in Iraq. However, what these modern-day Communist infiltrators do not realize is that these "children" whom Islam was apparently aiding will one day grow up to be God-hating worshippers of Allah! Are those the kind of people that we should be trying to help? Where is their American patriotism? 
These leftist liars might also argue that Islam's reception of the 2003 World Social Award for his continued world­wide support of the needy proves that he cannot be a terrorist. However, what these insurgents seem to be forgetting is that many other known terrorists have also attained similar prestige for actions that seem to suggest a passion for world peace. Take. for example, Tariq Ramadan, the so-called Islamic scholar who is renowned in Europe and the Middle East for his major publications on Islamic ethics. Praise the good Lord above that this transmitter of anti­American lies was not permitted to spread his Islamic terrorist tendencies 
into the puritan minds of Notre Dame students, thereby defil­ing the sacred Christian teachings instilled in them during their childhoods. Accordingly, let this be a lesson to 
you, Cat Stevens. You may think you're pretty 
clever because you managed to infiltrate American socie­ty in the 1970s with the sublim­
inal messages in 
your songs like "The First Cut is the Deepest," but 
now we're on to you. We know that you secretly want to take your unholy blade of terror and slice that !irst cut deep into the llesh of an unsuspecting American institution. 

So, Cat, you just keep on singing. "Yes, peace train holy roller. Everyone jump on the peace train." Those words mean nothing to the righteous American public. and we will send your peace train baek to the evil Islamic station from whence it came. 
Plus we never have time for music any­more since we started this whole war thing in Iraq.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Notre Dame outclassed 
Saturday's game was beyond embarrassing. 
I cried -twice -before halftime. 
We were outscored, outplayed, outmatched and -though I never thought I would have to say this-outclassed. 
I remember reading a letter in The Observer a year ago. The letter was written by a Michigan fan apologizing for the conduct of her classmates. At the time, a feeling that unfortunately resembled pride welled up inside me; pride that Notre Dame fans would never act in such a despicable and abhorrent manner. Obviously, we did not lynch a mock­up of their football coach, regardless of skin color. but this was not all that the letter was about. We would never scream profanities at our opponents. We would never go out of our way to push over, knock into and otherwise bruise them. We would never hurl various items directly at them in an attempt to prove ourselves as what? Sore losers? 
Yet at the Purdue game, I was hit in the back of the head with a quarter-full water bottle quite obviously aimed at a Purdue fan right in front of me. Her cousin, who stood next to her. was drenched in a mixture of Coke and half-melted ice cubes. She was ver­bally attacked by many Irish fans surround­ing her. until one student left and came back with an usher in an attempt to kick her out of the stadium. 
I am not saying that the Purdue fan was entirely in the right. There were many Purdue fans in the students' section who were able to stand contently, watching their team push the ball down the field time and time and time again. I agree that the manner in which she cheered was incredibly aggra­vating; in fact. I moved from standing next to her b1)cause she emphatically clapped her hands and shrieked in such a manner that caused the eardrums of surrounding students to ring. I can understand how some would consider it uncalled for when she began to sing her team's cheers over ours, though her enthusiasm was no less than I would expect from any Irish fan at an away game. However, the fact that one girl could sing the Purdue cheers over an entire section of Irish fans is equally regrettable. There are two things Notre Dame fans have become known for throughout the years: spirit and kindness. My parents, both of whom graduated in the class of '74, taught me this well before my third birthday. Unfortunately, we showed nei­ther this Saturday. 
For those it may concern: the Purdue fan did, in fact. have a ticket, as did the many other Purdue fans sitting in the students' sec­tion and throughout the stadium. If you have a problem with this, take it up with the Irish fans who sold their tickets, no doubt often at a considerable profit. to Purdue fans. Additionally, she was not kicked out of the stadium. She was relocated to another sec­tion where she would not be so threatened by the words and actions of those around her. Finally, without a doubt, she is going to go home to Purdue and tell every one of her friends what horrible sports and terrible peo­ple Notre Dame students proved themselves. I speak not only of those who acted in aggres­sion against her, but also the many surround­ing fans who stood in silence and did nothing. 
If we had scored four touchdowns in the last five minutes to make the greatest come­back ever known in college football, it would have made no difference to me. In my eyes, we had already lost well before halftime.

Debates aren't pep rallies 
To thn Democrats who were at the the benefit of us all as students and Presidential Debate Thursday night: citizens. 
Some people attended the campus My vote in the upcoming election is debate watch for the free pizza. Some undecided. I do not currently feel at went because they want to see the home in either party. I feel even less candidates' debate in an open comfortable in a campus atmos­community space. Some ----~ phere that seems to prefer 
chose to cheer for their preferred candidate. To this last group, I ask: please stay home. No one cares how big your John Kerry sign is, nor do we appreci­ate your knee­jerk clapping after every­thing Kerry says. 
While my gut instinct is to fault just the people who were unable to · control their behavior. I also am offended that the Rock the Vote organizers did nothing to stop this behavior. I know sev­eral of those organizers and some of them make no effort to hide their poli­tics. Yet I believe it is possible for partisan people to create a nonparti­san community event. However. no effort was made to curb the enthusi­asm of the Democrat half of the room. The Republican half of the room behaved itself. If such partisan behav­ior continues, I cannot see how Rock the Vote can presume to support non­partisan dialogue and community for 
grandstanding to the pur­ported goals of the Rock 
the Vote group. There have been several op-ed pieces 
written recently which call into 
question the goals of Rock the Vote and the 
College 
Democrats in 
our community. 
I agree we 
need more non­
partisan effort to increase 
awareness of serious political issues. I do not believe a public event should be allowed to turn into a pep rally for a par­ticular candidate. I 
hope Rock the Vote takes seriously the efforts of non­partisan dialogue and commu­
nity and makes some motion to cre­ate a safe atmosphere for intelligent political participation. Otherwise, I prefer to watch the debates at home.

Support NDPF 
Last Friday night six mem­bers of Notre Dame Peace Fellowship crouched on their hands and knees Sept. 24 and scrawled nonviolent messages in chalk on the sidewalks of Our Lady's University. Sometimes while being cursed at, sometimes while being commended, these people qui­etly but publicly proclaimed their faith and their commit­ment to it. We were among them. 
As members of Notre Dame Peace Fellowship. or NDPF, we are dedicated to gospel nonviolence, even in a world at war. We meet every week in the Center for Social Concerns to pray for peace, to read the writings of the saints and other great minds on issues of peace and justice, and to plan how best to raise awareness about issues of violence and war in our community. 
We strive to keep the words of Jesus Christ and the human face of war in the hearts of minds of the Notre Dame com­munity. We write quotes from Scripture around campus every football weekend, not because as Bill Rinner sug­gested, "we have a self-right­eous urge to sell out [our] intellectual gifts" or because we wish to "defile" campus with "tacky" slogans, but because we are humbly trying to follow Jesus, to figure out what that means, to figure out what the Sermon on the Mount means. Sometimes it's not until you write the words of Jesus for the hundredth time that you begin to under­stand their gravity or their consequences. 
We write, "Love your ene­mies" and "Blessed are the peacemakers" and "Thou shalt not kill." not because we know how to Jove our ene­mies, or how not to kill, but because we want to Jearn. 
Most often our scriptural messages are erased within days of their conception. Sept. 26 the words of Jesus were erased from the sidewalk in front of the Basilica. presum­ably with water, before Sunday morning Mass. Perhaps, the sacristans agreed with Rinner that the chalk was not aesthetically pleasing, or perhaps they would prefer that communi­cants not be troubled with the controversial words of Christ, "Love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you," (Matt 5:44).

Hest did not disappoint 
The title of Lauren Wendel's Scene article, "Ari Hest disappoints small crowd at SMC" was upsettingly inaccurate. Though entitled to her own opinions of the performance, these sentiments should not have been pro­jected upon the entire audience. Everyone I know who had the privilege of hearing Hest play Sept. 27 was pleased with his show and grateful to have had the opportunity to hear him perform live. Being a Hest fan was not a prerequisite for enjoying the concert. A small group of devotees clustered near the stage while the sunny afternoon and talented performers encour­aged picnic-goers and passers-by to stay and listen. 
Students remained on the quad as the sun set, the evening grew cold and the grass dampened. They were drawn in by Hest's melodic Jove songs, catchy upbeat tunes and reflective ballads. His husky baritone and soaring falsetto complemented inventive chord progressions and inspiring guitar riffs. Hest was at ease on stage and conversed comfortably with fans after the performance. His ability to make shows feel intimate and personal allowed fans to resonate completely with the sentiments behind the songs. His honest lyrics -though often not obscure or complex -consistently struck a chord with the audience. 
Hest's musicianship sets him apart from the masses of singer/songwriters striving to catch the coattails of John Mayer and Howie Day. Ari Hest will continue to succeed because of his talent, not because of his musical genre. My only disappointment in the show was that the enthusiastic crowd was not able to supply more energy due to sheer lack of numbers. I can only hope that the poor showing -due to odd timing and limited advertising-won't keep this talented musician from returning to the South Bend area in the future.

Train wreck 
Orton throws for four touchdowns as Purdue wins 41-16 
Observer Staff Report 
-

Kyle Orton never got caught up in Purdue's losing streak at Notre Dame Stadium. But Saturday. he played a pivotal part in breaking it. 
The lleisman Trophy candidate 
_threw for 385 yards and four touch­downs, Jerome Brooks returned a kick­off a 100 yards for a· score and Purdue's defense bent. but didn't break as the Boilermakers won at Notre Damn for the first time since 197 4 in a 41-16 drubbing of the Irish. "You know, I think people made too much of that," Orton said. referring to Purdue's 13 straight losses at Notre Dame. "We don't go around thinking about that too m ueh but it's nice for the fans and program to get a win here." Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn nearly matched Kyle Orton in evnry offpnsive category, nxcept for the one that mattered -touchdowns. Quinn finished his day with a Notre Dame Stadium record 432 passing yards on 26-of-46 attempts, but only one touchdown -a 40-yard fourth down corn pletion to Rhema McKnight in the third quarter. Notre Dame's passing wasn't the problem; it was the team's inability to run. The Irish managed just 76 yards, led by freshman tailback Darius Walker's 62 yards on 19 carries. "There were things that we needed to do that we didn't get done," Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham said. "We wanted to pass, but we also want­ed to run the ball. "We have to sustain the running game and we didn't do that today. They just stopped us." Several key plays turned the momen­tum of the game in the Boilermakers' favor. After both teams exchanged field goals on their opening drives, Brooks caught the Notre Dame kickoff on the goal line raced through an open seam, spun away from Ambrose Wooden and had a clear path to the end zone, put­ting Purdue ahead 10-3 in the first quarter. "!Special team problems have been! something that's kind of been nipping at our heels," Willingham said. "At Michigan State we had one ... and this one, we always know anyone can return a kickoff."

Irish running back Darius Walker is 1ackled by a pair of Purdue defenders during Notre Dame's 41-16 loss to the Boilermakers Saturday. Walker made a fumble on the 3-yard line in the second quarter that eventually led to a 97-yard Purdue touchdown drive. 
Irish don't make the big plays 
It started with the 100-yard kickoff return where Ambrose Wooden whiffed on a spin move by Purdue's Jerome Brooks. 
It continued with Darius Walker fumbling at the Purdue 3-yard line with the Irish only down 13-3. 
A 97-yard drive later and it's 20-3 Purdue at half­time. 
It ended on third-and-10 from that same 3-yard line early in the second half with the Boilermakers backed up against the student section. All-world quarterback Kyle Orton hit his favorite target, Taylor Stubblefield, in stride for a 97­yard touchdown pass that fea­tured Stubblefield giving the "Boiler Up" motion for the last 60 yards of that game-sealing third quarter score. 
What is "it?" "It" is making big plays. Saturday, the Irish didn't do it, 
and Purdue did. 
"We didn't make enough plays anywhere. We had opportunities on offense. We didn't cash in," Tyrone Willingham said. "We did-· n't step up and make some plays defensively and they did. They made some big plays." 
Remember in the Michigan game earlier this season the Irish were the team making the big plays. Think about Matt Shelton

making the acrobatic catch to get. the Irish on the board, the game­changing blocked punt and Darius Walker breaking tackles at the right time to find the end zone twice in his Notre Dame debut. That's how a team wins a big game. 
The Irish had a chance Saturday to get their fans, and most importantly, their students back into believing this team can get on a long-term run. 
Coming in on a three-game win­ning streak had everyone ready for this game all week, but just like in the past, the game was over before the 1812 Overture. 
That's what the "We didn't make enough ultimately Irish have become plays anywhere. We had responsible for

a blowout loss. change will show
Irish coach 
Seven losses of at least 20 points in the past 19 games isn't an anomaly, that's a disturbing trend. 
Gerry Faust had four such loss­es in a 4 7 -game stretch-all on the road. 
Bob Davie had three in 38 games-all on the road. Of Willingham's seven, three have come at home. 
But as much as people want to blame the coaching staff, the players are putting it on them­selves. 
As soon as Mike Goolsby heard his first question Saturday after the game, he defended his coach­es before answering. 
"First off, I want to say our coaches put us in a great game plan all week. I don't think we've been more prepared as odd as that may sound," he said. "I think a huge part of our defense is cre­ating turnovers, and we didn't get any today. 
"That was something we usually fall back on, and we didn't have it today." 
It's easy to blame the coaching staff. 
But the players have to go out there and make the plays. The coaches can't do that. 
That's not a defense of 
Willingham and 
his staff, who are 
up until the game 

at Tennessee in four weeks, unless the Irish inex­cusably lose one of their three games prior to the trip to Knoxville. That brings up a whole different issue. 
This one thing is true -the Irish didn't get it done Saturday. And they were embarrassed 
again. 
Something that's becoming an all-too-common theme in the Willingham era.

But then Boilermaker quarterback Kyle Orton stepped up out of the shot­gun. lie pointed to his right. The far right wide receiver ran in motion towards Orton.

Irish svveep the Orange in 3 sets 
By MIKE GILLOON 
Sports Writer 
Sometimes small changes pro­duce big differences. 
This held true for the Irish this weekend as Carolyn Cooper made her first start of the year and helped the Notre Dame vol­leyball team sweep Syracuse 30­23, 30-24, 30-17 on Saturday in Manley Field House. 
Irish coach Debbie Brown decided to put Cooper in at mid­dle blocker in place of Emily Loomis. who moved to the out­side hitter spot where she had played for the previous two sea­sons. Meg Henican, who had started at outside hitter against Michigan, was placed back in her normallibero position. 
The roster shakeup helped the Irish win their Big East opener for the tenth consecutive season while sparking Notre Dame to its best defensive performance of the season. 
The Irish came up with a sea­son-high 16 blocks, seven of which came from the front row combination of Cooper and Lauren Brewster, despite only playing a three-game match. Adrianna Stasiuk added a sea­son-high five blocks while Loomis had four. Syracuse as a team was only able to tally seven. 
Another bright spot for the Irish was the fact that they did not allow a service ace by Syracuse while notching six for themselves. Henican had a lot to do with that as she led the Irish for the tenth time this year in digs, notching 16, while Stasiuk chipped in 12. 
Notre Dame played steadily against a mistake-prone Orange team. The Irish jumped out to a lead of 5-1 in the first game and held Syracuse to a .017 hitting percentage for the match while hitting .198 themselves. 
An error by Syracuse, one of 33 on the day for the Orange, ended the first game in favor of the Irish. 
After shooting out to a 12-4 lead in game two, the Irish wit­nessed a Syracuse rally that scraped the Irish lead down to 16-15. The Orange offensive surge was headed by Morgan Jones, who hit .400 for the match to go along with seven kills. Erin McQuillin hit .300 with five kills while Joscie Kaup recorded 11 digs to keep the Irish offense in check. But five kills by Brewster in the frame delivered game two to Notre Dame. 
The third game was tight as the teams were knotted at 10-10 early on. But the Irish pulled away with a 9-0 run to seal the victory. 
Notre Dame will return to the court next weekend with Big East road matches with Rutgers and Seton Hall.

Expos say good­bye to baseball 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Todd Zeile's finale was a whole lot more fulfilling than the Montreal Expos' farewell. 
Zeile hit a three-run homer in the last at-bat of his career, leading the New York Mets over the Expos 8-1 on Sunday in Montreal's final game before moving to Washington. 
"I tried to enjoy the day and have something fun and memorable to take with me," Zeile said. 
The game was also the last for Art Howe as the Mets' manager. He was fired Sept. 15, but chose to stay on to finish out a dismal season in which the Mets went 71-91. 
"The special things that happened today, it was excit­ing to be a part of," Howe said. "When Todd hit that home run I just got goose­bumps." 
The Expos played their first and final game as Montreal's "Nos Amours" at Shea Stadium. In front of an uninspired crowd of 33,569 that was fitting for the two worst teams in the NL East, fans started a brief "Let's go Expos!" chant in the ninth i just in case. 
Cubs 10, Braves 8 
Greg Maddux beat the Atlanta Braves and then, almost longingly, wished them good luck in the play­offs. 
For the first time in more than a decade, the ex-Braves star will be sitting out the postseason. And beating his former team in a meaning­less regular-season finale was no consolation. 
"It was embarrassing walk­ing out on the field today. We won, but big deal," Maddux said Sunday after getting the victory for the Chicago Cubs in their victory over the NL East-champion Braves. 
"It's just kind of a big let­down after the last couple of days. It was tough to go out there. It really should have mattered and it didn't," Maddux added. 
The Cubs led the wild-card race with nine games left, then lost seven of eight in a dramatic collapse before being eliminated Saturday. 
Atlanta earlier wrapped up its 13th straight division title and will face Houston in the first round Wednesday with Jaret Wright starting the opener for the Braves, prob­ably against Roger Clemens. 
"You know you wish the Braves well. They're a great organization and I enjoyed every day I played over there," Maddux said. 
Facing the Braves for the first time since July 10, 1992, the last year of his first stint with the Cubs and his first Cy Young Award season, Maddux worked six innings and gave up a pair of homers to Charles Thomas while yielding six runs. Giants 10, Dodgers 0 
Now that the preliminaries are out of the way, Odalis Perez and the Los Angeles Dodgers are ready for the main event. 
Perez came out swinging Sunday after the Dodgers lost a meaningless regular­season finale to the San Francisco Giants. 
"If we beat St. Louis, we're going to win the World Series," Perez said. "If we beat them, this is it: Dodgers champions." 
Perez, 7-6 with a fran­chise-record 18 no-decisions and a 3.25 ERA, will oppose Woody Williams (11-8) on Tuesday in St. Louis to begin the best-of-5 divisional series. 
The NL Central champion Cardinals won a major league-leading 105 games to 93 for the Dodgers, but Perez said that doesn't mean any­thing.

Associated Press 

THOMASTOWN. Ireland­The pressure to win made Ernie Els feel like he was in a major. Given all he has been through this year, his victory in the American Express Championship sure felt like one. 
Emotionally spent from a Grand Slam season of heartache, Els reasserted himself as a major force Sunday by outlasting Thomas Bjorn in a brilliant­ly played duel in the cold rain at Mount Juliet. He closed with a 3-under 69 for a one-shot victory and his first World Golf Championship. 
"Everybody knows what I've been through this sum-
IN BRIEF EilJ"nhardt's }VOrds threaten 
his Nextel pomts lead 
TALLADEGA, Ala. Dale Earnhardt was nearly perfect on the racetrack. His only real slipup Sunday came in Victory Lane during a pos­trace television interview. 
Junior, who charged from 11th place to a victory and the series points lead in the last five laps of the NASCAR Nextel Cup race at Talladega Superspeedway, put that lead in jeop­ardy by cursing during an NBC Sports interview. 
In February at Rockingham, NASCAR president Mike Helton explicitly told drivers to watch their mouths on radio and television. Less than a month later, Johnny Sauter was fined $25,000 and docked 25 points after cursing during a radio interview following the Busch Series race in Las Vegas. 
''I'm worried about losing some points," said Earnhardt, who moved into the series lead by 13 points over Kurt Busch, who finished fifth Sunday. 
mer," Els said. "I had a lot of pressur on me, and I think I showed that 1 didn't want to lose." 
The Big Easy had every reason to fed sorry for him­self. 
He lost th1~ Masters when Phil Mickebon birdied the last hole. He played in the final group of the U.S. Open and shot 80. He lost the British Open in a four-hole playoff against unheralded Todd Hamilton. And a bogey on the final hole knocked him out of 'l playoff at the PGA Championship. 
"I wanted to forget about the majors, the near miss­es," Els said. "I needed to get that out of my system and start over. Otherwise. I'm going to get left behind. 
NASCAR spokeswoman Denise Maloof said Nextel Cup director John D.trby and vice president for competi­tion Robin Pemberton were "aware of the situation and would address it on Tuesday or Wednesday. That doesn't n~lcessarily mean that he will be fined or lose points." Vfoods' wedding reportedly
planned for Tuesday 
BRIDGETOWN, Barbados-Tiger Woods says he's planning a Caribbean vacation, but Barbados is abuzz with n:ports that he's set to wed Swedish model Elin Nordegren this week. 
Newspapers in Barbados and Ireland have reported that the two are to marry early this week at the Sandy Lane luxury resort on the Caribbean island's west coast. 
Hotel manager Wilbert Mason said h'~ doesn't know of any plans for a wedding. But two sources who said tt,ey had knowledge of the event told The Associated Press that it was p .anned for Tuesday at the resort. Ttley spoke on condition of anonymity. 
I don't want to do that. I want to win tournaments. and the only way you can do it is to move forward." 
Els took one small leap with his fourth victory of the year. 
He moved past Tiger Woods to No. 2 in the world ranking, and the 34-year­old South African now has yet another chance to reach No. 1 by the end of the year. 
Els and Vijay Singh, who did not play this week because of the latest hurri­cane in Florida, are sched­uled to play the next two tournaments in Europe. 
"The game is on," Els said. 
The game at Mount Juliet was on from the opening hole, and never let up until 
The Barbados Daily Nation newspa­per ran a story Wednesday under the headline "Tiger Woods tying knot at Sandy Lane." 
Woods declined to confirm the reports, and when asked about a Caribbean vacation said only, "''m ready to go diving. I'm ready to hop in that water and shoot some fish." Federer routes Roddick in 
Thailand Open 
BANGKOK, Thailand -Top-ranked Roger Federer routed an injured Andy Roddick 6-4, 6-0 Sunday to capture the Thailand Open, joining John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg as the only players to win 12 straight ATP Tour finals in the last 25 years. 
"It would be nice to break their record, but I'll take one tournament at a time," said Federer, who has won 10 titles this year. "I hope to play well until the end of the season." 
Federer needed just 58 minutes to defeat the second-seeded Roddick, whose elbow was sore from his semi­final victory over Marat Satin. 
Bjorn failed to make a 40­foot birdie putt on the final hole. That allowed Els to two-putt for bogey from 15 feet to finish at 18-under 270. 
Els won $1.2 million and set the single-season earn­ings record on the European tour, topping $4 million. 
The majors over, this was a consolation prize. 
Bjorn might have felt the same way in defeat. Four months ago in Ireland, the 33-year-old Dane walked oil' the course during the open­ing round at the European Open and said he was men­tally unfit to play, his confi­dence so low that even the largest greens looked like the tiniest of targets.

Belles defeat Albion College 
By JUSTIN STETZ Sports Writer 
On Saturday the Belles made it three straight as they triumphed over Albion College. 
The win put Saint Mary's in a tie with the Britons for fifth place in the MlAA. 
The Belles improved to 4-5 in the conference and 4-8 overall. 
Earlier in the season. Albion dr.feated Saint Mary's in four games. but this time. the Belles were able to capitalize both on offense and defense and came away with the win. 
"Both our offense and defensive our strong," Michelle Gary said. "When we work together in both areas we give ourselves the chance to win. We just have to put them both together in the same game in order to establish some sort of balance." 
Among the Belles who played well were Amanda David and Michelle Turley. David ended the day with 12 kills on offense, while Turley collected 21 in the match. 
But neither player was done as they excelled on defense as well. Turley continued to shine for the Belles as she put up an impres­sive 31 digs. 
David had 15 of her own, and Ann Cusack's consistent play on defense was once against evident as she was second to only Turley with 27 digs. Cusack currently leads the team with 184 digs in 12 games. Turley has recorded 138 kills on offense this year, and Shelly Bender's 97 kills place her close behind. 
For the second straight year, Saint Mary's lost the first match to the Britons only to come back in the next one and win. 
The Belles won the first game, 30-28, and pulled out a grueling second contest with a 36-34 vic­tory. Things got a little scary as the Belles dropped the next two forcing the match into a fifth and deciding game. However, Saint Mary's accepted the challenge and won by a score of 15-9. 
Since starting the season 0-5, the Belles have compiled a record of 4-3 in their last seven games and appear to be right back in the hunt in the MlAA. They cur­rently trail Adrian College by only one game for fourth place. 
"Kalamazoo is coming up on Wednesday and they have a strong team." Gary said. "We are tied with Albion for fifth in the MlAA, but we are still taking one game at a time. We have the potential to beat the rest of the teams on our schedule and the chance to keep rising in the standings." 
Saint Mary's will need to have another solid game this Wednesday when they take on third place Kalamazoo. The Hornets are 7-2 in the league, but the rejuvenated Belles will be eagerly looking to extend their streak.

Saint Mary's places second at Invitational 
By ANN LOUGHERY Sporrs Writer 
Second place usually war­rants a shoulder shrug. 
Many coaches would talk about second place finishes like they have a chip on their shoulders. But not Saint Mary's Mark Hamilton. 
Although the Belles fin­ished in second place this weekend at the Oshkosh Invitational, Hamilton was pleased with the team's per­formance. 
''I'm proud of how the ladies played under such tough conditions," Hamilton said. "I wish we could have come out on top, but we played our best."

University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire cap­tured first place with 675 strokes, University of Wisconsin-Pia tteville trailed the Belles with 707, University of Wisconsin-River Falls finished in fourth place at 721 shots and host University of Wisconsin­Oshkosh shot a team score of 7 25 for fifth place. 
Junior Megan Mattia led the Belles with a fifth place finish, firing a two-day score of 166. Hamilton cited Mattia as an individual who realized her potential this weekend. 
"She got a little more on track this week. I'm expect­ing her to shoot a couple of rounds in the seventies this year," Hamilton said. "I think she'll be one of the pillars of next year's hopefully suc­cessful team."

four format, with all six golfers competing for each team and the top four scores each round counting towards the overall team score. 
Though this tournament may not have the top-to-bottom firepower of the McHaney Invitational, the Irish will still face a tough challenge in the field of 12 competitors. Their toughest competition will come from nemesis Michigan, who the Irish already faced at the Lady Northern Invitational in Ann Arbor. 
"We see a lot of top teams throughout the year, and that really helps us out," eoach Debby King said. 
With performances like last weekend's, the Irish are becoming a top team them­selves, and this week they send a lineup capable of achieve­ment and becoming more con­

sistent with each passing week. 
"I've been trying to instill that they are not a break 80 team, but can break 75-each one (of them]." King said. 
Loading the team will be jun­ior co-captain Katie Brophy, who broke 75 twice on her way to an individual title at the Central Regional preview, shooting a 69 and a 72 to win her school-record third indi­vidual title. 
Sophomores Noriko Nakazaki and Stacy Brown will join Brophy at the Shootout. Both did well and cracked the top 15 last weekend. with Nakazaki 
Gebauer and 
freshman Jane Lee, who both competed and did well last weekend. will also travel to Franklin to play over the next two days. Rounding out the Irish lineup will be jun­ior co-captain Suzie Hayes, who will be competing in her second tournament of the sea­son. 
Hayes, along with co-captain Brophy, have been largely responsible for the chemistry of the team, which may go far to explain their growing suc­cess. 
"That's one of the biggest assets to this team," King said about their chemistry. "There is no animosity among team members at all, and they wish the best for each other."

Irish tel play in Windon Mem.orial 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 

The Irish will be back in action today, heading to Northwestern University to com­pete in the Windon Memorial Classic. 
The Irish will face stilT compe­tition at the Windon. including defending NCAA champion California. Also inc .uded in the 16-team field are four other teams that earned bids to the NCAA finals and nine teams that qualified for NCAA regionals. including the Irish. 
Additionally, se-ten golfers who earned All-Am~rica honors will compete thi~ weekend, including Peter Richardson of Minnesota, last year's individual champion. 
"In terms of strength of the field, this is probably one of our toughest ones," assistant coach Chris Whitten said. "This event is more important [than most of our other ones) be~ause there are more teams fmm our dis­trict. Some of the really good teams from the district are going to be there." 
The 54-hole event will run all day today and Tuesday at the Conway Hills Golf Course in Lake Forrest, Ill. Thirty-six holes will be played today, with the final round taking place Tuesday. 
The Irish will sen<] a relatively experienced lineup to compete this weekend. The team will be rejoined by junior Scott Gustafson, who was injured in a car accident three weeks ago. Gustafson will fill a void the Irish struggled to replacf: during his absence. 
"It felt like we wen one player short a lot of times," Whitten said of the time Gustafson was out. 
Sophomore Cole Isban, who has performed well for the Irish over the past few weeks, will join Gustafson this week. Isban has led the Irish in scoring in both of the first two events this year. 
Junior Eric Deutsch and fresh­man Greg Rodgers will also take the links to compete for the Irish. Deutsch has two top 15 finishes in two tournaments this season, and Badgers is already becoming a reliable member of the team as a freshman. 
Junior Tommy Balderston will round out the Irish lineup, appearing for the first time as a member of the scoring lineup. Balderston, who was a key member of last year's team, struggled early on this year, but seems to have found his stroke again this year, winning the John Dallio Invitational last week, which he entered as an individual. 
"We feel like the guys in the lineup are starting to gel," Whitten said. "If these guys have their best rounds, we're getting to the point where we can com­pete with anyone." 
In addition to the Windon, the Irish will send Jive members to compete as individuals in the Eric Yestingsmeier Invitational, hosted by Ball State. 
Junior Mark Baldwin, sopho­more Shane Sigsbee. senior K.C. Wiseman and freshmen Eddie Peckels and Mike King will all try to get some competition under their collective belts. 
The Irish will use these tour­naments to measure themselves against some strong competition and see where their place is on the national level, at least at this moment.

Saint Mary's finishes seventh of eight teams 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKK.ALA 
Sports Writer 
Facing tough competition from several Division I teams and a top­ranked Division III school, Saint Mary's took seventh place out of eight teams in the Dennis Stark Relays on Friday. 
Squaring off against Notre Dame, Illinois State, Valparaiso and Wisconsin-Milwaukee -a top 25 Division Ill program ­Saint Mary's had several bright spots during the competition. 
Introducing their youthful team, including only five upperclass­men. to the rigors of collegiate competition, the Belles were able to evaluate the experience and use the Stark Relays as a gauge for the season ahead. 
'The team dynamic was one of the very big positives for us," Belles coach Gregg Petcoff said. "We have a lot of new freshmen and this was their first college meet, yet we had a lot of upper­classmen that were Leading and were showing them the way and a lot of underclassmen that just stepped right in and learned quickly." 
The strongest performance for the Belles on the night was the 400-yard breaststroke relay. Saint Mary's came in third in a field of eight and the team, consisting of junior Sarah Nowak, senior Michelle Stanforth, freshman Kelly Tighe and sophomore Bridget Green, posted a time of 5 minutes, 4.90 seconds in the event. This time represented the fastest breaststroke relay time that Saint Mary's has ever posted as a team in the Dennis Stark Relays. 
Similarly, the Belles also per­formed strongly in the 400 indi­vidual medley relay, posting a time of 9:18.31 in the event. This relay team, composed entirely of freshmen (Tighe, Sara Matesevac, Noreen Sherrad and Lisa Balog), also posted the fastest time ever in that particular event by a Saint Mary's team at the Stark Relays. 
While the team's relay start 
times proved to be definite posi­tives for the Belles, their turns and streamlines were not as advanta­geous and will be focal points in practice for the next few weeks. 
"When you enter that very first meet, especially the first relay meet of the year, you enter it thinking, 'Okay. What do we want to learn that we need to work on when we come out of this?'" Petcoff said. "The relay starts were ahead of the game so that was one of the good things and we need to constantly take the good, bad and ugly at the end of the meet. The turns and our stream­lines were maybe in that ugly cat­egory." 
With almost a month before Saint Mary's travels to Holland, Mich. to take part in a double duel meet with Hope College and Olivet College, the Belles hope to take some learning experiences from the Stark Relays and use them to prepare for the rest of the season. 
"As a coach, it showed us that while we've been getting them in shape, we still don't quite have the speed." Petcoff said. "With only 15 or 16 practices in the water [we found that). aerobically, we're pretty sound but we need more speed in the workouts. That's what we've got to focus on in the next couple of weeks."

Belles busy battling inconsistency blues 

By RYAN DUFFY Sports Writer 

Despite having one of the most talented teams in years, the Belles have faced one problem all season: they're inconsistent. 
After playing strong soccer for the first half on Saturday, Saint Mary's could not hold off Calvin's attack for the rest of the game, losing 3-1. 
"We played well, we just weren't able to put two good halves together," senior Katie Noble said. "We played hard. and we did a good job of switch­ing the field, of transitioning from offense to defense, but we just couldn't get the balls to fall. We had so many opportunities, but we just couldn't get it in the back of the net." 
The Belles played well to open the game, with junior Maura

Schoen scoring 25 minutes in to give Saint Mary's the lead. Calvin quickly answered back, and the teams entered the half tied 1-1. However. it was Calvin that came out strong in the second half, scoring five minutes into the period to take the lead, and then again with ten minutes to play to seal the game 3-1. 
"We were so excited coming in for such a big game, and scoring first just added to that burst of energy," said midfielder Ashley Hinton. "But our energy seemed to deflate after they tied it up. It's definitely been a huge factor for us to be able to put together two solid halves of soccer." 
Although playing solid defense, the Belles faced trouble in trying to contain the Calvin attack, which includes two of the MIAA's best: Jill Capel, who leads the MIAA in goals scored, and Sarah Weesies, who was the league MVP last year as a fresh­man. Capel scored once on Saturday, while Weesies struck twice against Saint Mary's. 

"Their forwards were really attacking and aggressive, play­ing a direct style that we weren't expecting," Noble said. "They were unbelievably fast, and we tried to adjust to make up for that. We tried to pressure them harder, to drop more. but they just k.~pt finding ways around them. 
The Calvin forwards delivered blow after blow to the Belles on Saturday, with Capel scoring once and Weesies striking twice. 
"They had a very skillful attack," Hinton said. "Their for­wards were very talented, and their offensive attack was very strong." 
Despite the loss, the Belles still feel good about their chances in the MIAA. 
"We're still in strong MIAA position. The top three teams are so evenly matched," Noble said. "That we can beat Hope 2­0, then lose by two goals to Calvin, and then those two teams can tie, just shows how even we are and how teams can just have off' days. When they come back and play us at home, we have just as good a chance to win. I have faith in us for every game." 
Although Calvin now sits tied for first, the loss only dropped the Belles to a tie for second, with plenty of MIAA games still to play. 
"There are still plenty of games to be played; we just need to focus on each one. because every game matters," Hinton said. "We're still in the run for first place; we just need to do the things we know we're good at and just get there. We have to come ready to play for every single game we have left." 
With a second match at home 
later this year and a constantly 
improving team, the Belles look 
forward to playing Calvin again 
and solidifying their MIAA posi­
tion. 
"We can't wait to play them again because we really want to avenge this game," Hinton said. "We wanted to come out this time and show that we were a talented team; we're just going to have to prove it later in the season when we get a chance to play them again."

vidual accomplishment of the night came from sophomore Katie Carroll, who set the sole meet record of the night for the women with a win in the 400-yard individual medley. 
In the first race of the sea­
son, Carroll, the 2004 Big East Championships Most Outstanding Swimmer, posted a time of 4 minutes, 22.93 seconds, which earns her consideration for a bid to next spring's NCAA Championships. 
"I think Katie's swim was probably one of her best unrested swims ever so I think it was a nice way to start the year off," Weathers said. "I thought we had some good swims from the other girls that swam the 400 IM also, but Katie's was pretty exceptional." 
Also performing well in vic­tories for the women were sophomore Ellen Johnson (200 freestyle, 200 back­stroke). freshman Natalie Burke (100 and 200 breast­stroke) and senior co-captain Kelli Barton (400 individual medley). 
Leading the way for the men's team were victorious sophomores Ted Brown (400 individual medley, 200 butter­fly) and Louis Cavadini (50 and 100 freestyle races), sen­ior captain Matt Bertke (200 freestyle), juniors Doug Bauman (200 backstroke). Patrick Davis (500 freestyle) 
and  Tyler  Grenda  (200  
breaststroke).  
Brown  beat  the  field,  

including last year's Big East champion in teammate Jamie Lutkus. in the event, by more than five seconds in an exhi­bition heat of the 400 individ­ual medley with a time of 
4:04.42 and posted his second win in the 200 butterfly with a time of 1:53.53. 
Cavadini earned two early wins in the 50 and 100-yard freestyle races, posting times of 21.27 and 47.60 seconds, respectively. 
The Notre Dame diving squad was also dominant at Friday's events. 
Solidified by freshman Sam Stoner and sophomore Scott Coyle, the five Irish men's divers all finished ahead of Evansville's competitors. Anchored by fifth-year senior Meghan Perry-Eaton, who fin­ished third at last year's NCAA Championships in the one-meter competition, the Irish women swept the diving events in the dual meet. 
After just the first meet of the season, 14 swimmers on the men's team and 17 swim­mers on the women's team have already posted automat­ic qualifying times for the Big East Championship meet on Feb. 17-19. 
"I think that really helps us focus on what the big task is -which is swimming well at the meets and not so much worrying on qualifying for the [Big East Championships]," Weathers said. "We're defi­nitely proud of what the girls accomplished right away and looking forward to the next meet and getting some more of those things out of the way."

$62, ND/SMC/HC $50, Students $20 
Best known for his nationally broadcast radio program, "From the Top," swashbuckling pianist Christopher O'Riley has emerged as one of the most distinguished, versatile and decorated pianists of his generation. He has won the coveted Van Cliburn competition solidifying his stature among classical musicians, but has also interpreted the music of the rock group Radiohead. Not many other classical pianists have tracks named Subterranean Homesick Alien. O'Riley will be joined by the Academy of Saint Martin in the Fields, a chamber orchestra which has been the benchmark of Baroque music for almost 50 years. They are simply the best, and when they get together with O'Riley sparks will fly. O'Riley says, "I love that dramatic aspect, the hero soloist versus the orchestra. There's such a wonder­ful sense of tension."

Eileen Ivers rose to prominence as a nine time all-Irish fiddle champion and as the fiery fiddler of "Riverdance," but her passion for exploration has catapulted her to rarified air where only virtuosos play. Her boldly imaginative style earned her the title "Jimi Hendrix of the violin" from a New York Times reviewer. Eileen Ivers and Immigrant Soul storm the stage with matchless energy and an eclectic spirit. Respectful of their Irish roots, they infuse their concert with fresh vitality drawing from the rhythms of Latin and African music. Eileen Ivers will change the way you think about the violin.

Second City Comedy

Always brash, original, and daring, Second City Comedy brings its unique brand of sketch comedy and improvisation to Notre Dame. The concept is simple enough: six actors and an accompanist take the stage and make you laugh. Although they have 45 years of archives to draw upon, their work is always fresh, topical, and inventive. They are ready to comment on every social debate, political scandal, or public disgrace, and they're here just two weeks before the presidential election, which just might be on their minds.

Fado is the blues of Portugal, and for a generation there was only one name in Fade, but a new, powerful, and beautiful voice has moched the pinnacle. Mariza, recent winner of the BBC award for best European oct, sings with a passion so soulful it is difficult to believe it comes from a 28-year-old woman. It is precisely this duality that makes Mariza the epitome of Fado Fade is known for poetry that fuses opposite emoti·jns-impossible pain with fervent joy, or lifes cruel!) with loves intensity. Mariza is a diva-in the best sense of the word-and when she puts her pers,Jnal, indelible stamp on a song, she leaves audiences spellbound and breathless.

Clark wins 200th car,eer game 
Notre Danze wins 1-0 over number nine ranked Boston College to stay in the top 25 
By MATT PUGLISI 
Spom Writer 
Make it an even 200. Coach Bobby Clark picked up his 200th ~~arncr victory as the 

... No. 2:~ Irish (7-2-1 overall, 3-1­0 in Big East)-on the verge of being dropped out of the NSCAA/ad i d as po 11-fough t back this weeknnd, knocking off rival and Big East conf'er­e rH~n Inadn r No. 9 Boston Collngn in a 1-0 overtime thriller Friday night bdore thumping l.oyola-Chieago 4-0

Sunday afternoon at Alumni Field. 
"This was a very good wenk­fHJd," Clark said. "Tho scary thing was that after such a good Big East n~sult against a VPry good tPam, we would have a letdown on the Sunday game -that can mtsily happen. Tlw boys came ready to play. and they did very well." 
The sporadie rain may have !men cool Friday night. but the bitter Notre Dame-Boston College rivalry hPatnd things up. 
"It was a tight game -it's a Blg East rivalry," Clark said. "This was a big opportunity for them and a very important game f'or us to get b;u~k into the Big East standings, so it was an important game for both teams. That being the ease, it's always going to be Iintense!." 
In a contest eerily similar to the last Irish-Golden Eagles matchup-another 1-0 Irish

victory in the opening minutes of overtime at Alumni Field in 2002-Notre Dame waited until after regulation time expired before securing its second con­secutive win over tho current conference leader -the Irish edged No. 21 Villanova 1-0 on the road Sept. 26. 
The 3-1-0 start in Big East play marks the first time the Irish have started conference play with three wins in four games since 1997, when they started 3-0-1. 
Arter controlling tlw game's opening 20 minutes and nearly netting the go-ahead goal on a numbPr of occasions, induding a shot that clanged ol'f the crossbar from the foot of fresh­man forward Alex Yoshinaga, tho Irish allowed Boston Coll1~gn back into the contest before dominating play again in thP sneond half. 
"Our second half pnrform­anen was excelhmt," Clark said. "I thought we were a team wanting to win the game, whore they seemed to be quite happy to settle -to get out of horn with a tie. We chased the whole second half." 
Not surprisingly, in a contest that foaturnd 29 fouls, fivi1 yel­low eards and a couple of scuf­fles, it was a Golden Eagle penalty -one of 20 on the evening for Boston College ­that set up the golden goal and sent the Irish faithful home happy.

Fadng an opponent not seen in years and taking part in a Notre Damn swimming tradi­tion, the Irish swim program burst out of the blocks quickly this season, winning in impres­sive f'ashion in both the Evansville dual meet and the Dt~rmis Stark Helays. 
The Notre Dame men's and women's teams were nearly perfeet on Friday, blanketing their opponents and placing first a combined 43 times out of the evening's 46 events. 
In all, :H> of the 35 athletes on the men's roster and 2~ of the 36 swimmers on the womtm's roster registered at least one victory at Friday's events. 

All told, the men (1-0) easily earned a 157-55 point vietory in the dual meet against Evansville, a ieam the Irish havo not faced since Notre Dame joined the Big East in 1995, and a 118-point win mar­gin over the rest of the field in the 40th annual Stark Helays. 
Tho men finished with 248 points in the Stark Helays, breaking the record for most points ever in the meet (former­ly 230 in 1997). 
The women (1-0) cruised to a 161-54 victory against Evansville and earned first plaefl in the Stark Helays with 260 points, 56 more than sec­ond-place finisher Illinois State. 
Both Irish teams raced out to an early lead in the Evansville dual meet and never looked bark. 
The men's team registered top four finishes in eight of the first nine events as it built a 143-28 advantage. 
Equally impressive, the women's team registered 1-2-3­4 finishes in its first six events to build up a lead of 96-18. 
"I think it was one of our bet­ter opening meets, really," women's eoach Bailey Weathers said. "I thought our girls did an exceptional job of really being aggressive from the start of the meet and I think there w~~re a lot of good swims early [for us]."
