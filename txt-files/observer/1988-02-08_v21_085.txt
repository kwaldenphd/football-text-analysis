ND student assaulted in 02 lot 
By JIM RILEY News Editor 
A female Notre Dame senior was assaulted Sunday night in the D-2 parking lot after being forced into her assailant's ve­hicle, said Rex Rakow, director of Notre Dame Security. 
The student suffered a cut to the knee and some minor scrapes, Rakow said. She was treated and released from St. Joseph's Medical Center. 
Rakow said the cut was made by a sharp object believed to be a 4-inch knife. He said none of her injuries were serious. 
The case is being treated as an aggravated assault, Rakow said, adding that the victim was not assaulted sexually. 
He said the student was clearing snow from her windshield at about 5:10p.m. when the suspect approached her. The suspect then led her "by coercion and by force to the suspect's vehicle where she was physically assaulted," said Rakow. 
Rakow said the suspect was described as a white male 
Campaigning also begins at midnight for the five student senate races. 
"I think its great that so many tickets are running," said Student Body President Pat Cooke. "They obviously feel that they can make a dif­ference and are interested in serving the students." 
Although eligible, Cooke will not seek reelection. "Next year will be my last undergraduate year here at Notre Dame, and although my experiences as student body president have been countless and extremely memorable, there are pther aspects of Notre Dame that I

about 18 years old. He was about six feet tall, 260 lbs. with short brown hair, possibly spiked in front, and acne. He was wearing a "Kiss" rock group t-shirt and blue jeans. 
Rakow said the suspect is believed not to be a student. The suspect's vehicle was seen heading northbound on Juniper Road after the incident. The ve­hicle was a late-model AMC Jeep with a yellowish-tan hardtop sunroof. 
The investigation into the in­cident is continuing, and Secur­ity has asked anyone with in­formation about the assault to contact the Security office.

A recent National Collegiate Athletic Association ruling granted permission to several Notre Dame athletes to model clothes for the upcoming ninth annual Black Cultural Arts Council Fashion Show. 
The models for "Fashion Savvy" are 16 Notre Dame stu­dents, eight women and eight men, half of whom will be re­turning varsity football players this fall. 
The NCAA ruling committee indicated Thursday that the four Notre Dame athletes could model clothes belonging to the show's sponsors because the generated funds would go di­rectly to charity, said fashion show coordinator Kim Steven­son. 

Missy Conboy, assistant ath­letic director, said the athletic department decided to seek ex­pressed permission from the NCAA after her office was "contacted by one of the fac­ulty members who just wanted to make sure that the student-athletes wouldn't jeopardize their eligibility by modeling " for the promotion of a commer­cial product. 
The committee based its decision on a "charity excep­tion" clause recently amended to the NCAA constitution. 
The clause states: "A student-athlete may promote directly a charitable or educa­tional project provided all funds generated by the use of the student-athlete's name, picture or appearance are dis­tributed directly to the charity or educational agency." 
The BCAC will donate all proceeds from the Feb. 20 show to the Martin Luther King Jr. Scholars Fellowship of South Bend, Stevenson said. 
The fellowship "attempts to reduce barriers to educational and employment opportunities (by) providing scholarships at local colleges and universities and by producing internships to King's Scholars at local busi­nesses and industry," she said.

Giant stomps out Hulk and an era of goodness 
Absolutely unbelieveable! 

Mter years and years of being the symbol of goodness and strength to kids everywhere, the end of his era is apparently here. 
I still can't believe it. Hulk Hogan is no longer champion of the World Wrestling Federation. 
Hulkamaniacs across the country stand with jaws on the floor, not quite understanding the implications of the Hulkster's loss Friday night to Andre the Giant. 
The WWF made its network debut Friday night, serving as a preview to "Miami Vice". Mter Randy Macho Man Savage saved the lovely Elizabeth by defeating the Honky Tonk Man, the crowd rose to its feet. 
It was time for the Main Event. 

Andre the Giant, a force of evil in today's society, wanted a rematch after the Hulkster beat him a few months back on a controversial pincount by the referee. The Hulkster knew that Andre would be up to some sort of trick, and so he called on his "mob of raging, screaming, Hulkamaniacs to keep their little eyes on the Giant's corner." 
What could the Giant possibly do with a capacity Market Square Arena crowd watching his every move? I mean, not even the 21-2-2 Irish hockey team could pack as many people in as the WWF. There were more Hoosiers in Indianapolis at Market Square than John Cougar Melloncamp could ever imagine. But the Giant had a plan. 
With a little help from a secret plastic sur­geon, the Giant's camp created a look-a-like to Dave Hammond, the referee. Mter a quick payoff to this newly created look-a-like, the Giant's corner succeeded in distracting the Hulk with some out of the ring shenanigans. The Million Dollar Man, a Giant crony, replaced one referee with another and the end of an era was coming soon. 
Andre managed to get the Hulkster down on his back. The referee began to count. One!! The Hoosier Hulkamaniacs rise to their feet. Their hero is down. Two! ! The Hulk begins to roll. Yes, his shoulder is off the mat!! He's saved!! Wait! What's this? Three!! The fight is over!! 
Nobody could believe it. They didn't even pay off the real ref. They brought in their own guy to call the fight. Andre had won the title. 
Severe depression sets in. Is nothing sacred? The integrity of the WWF is now on the line. Not since Tulane shaved points in college bas-
Jim Winkler 
Day Chief 
ketball has a scandal like this occurred. The Hulkster has filed a protest, but it doesn't look good. Who knows when Andre will offer a rematch. Now what are all the kids supposed to do with their "Hulk Hogan Championship lunch boxes?" 
Why did the Hulkster lose? Was it because he wasn't in shape? No chance: he's 302 pounds of raging flesh, with 24 inch biceps. Was it solely because of plastic surgery? Somewhat, but not entirely. Was it because now the WWF can pack a billion people into the Tremendousdome for another "Wrestlemania" event? Bingo. 
The WWF sells. Big time. Lots of money. Lunch boxes, shirts, headbands, and tickets. Big time. Lots of tickets. Wrestlemania 3, held in the Silverdome in Michigan, hosted 93,000 people. Market Square was sold out Friday night. Closer to home, the Joyce A.C.C. hosts the WWF almost twice a month. You guessed it. More people watch the Hulk and friends than watch Rivers and friends. 
The WWF has the match of its lifetime set up now. Can the Hulkster recover? Can he gat­her all the energy he needs from those young Hulkamaniacs world-wide? Will NBC televise it again? You can bet your bottom dollar the WWF has it all figured out.

Fewer bar, party raids during winter season 
By ERIC M. BERGAMO Senior Staff Reporter 
Police raids of off-campus parties and bars have decreased compared to last winter, according to South Bend Police Captain Patrick Cottrell. 
Cold weather is one reason for the drop-off in raids, Cot­trell said. 
"When it's cold and nasty outside, not that many people want to drink ou~side,'' he said. 
The last party broken up for violation of the city's noise or­dinance was on Jan. 19 at 801 
N. St. Louis St. Cottrell said that 125 people were at "what was apparently a birthday party." 
The owners of the residence cooperated with police to break up the party, Cottrell added. 
Complaints about parties from neighborhood residents, which were high at the begin­ning of the year, have dropped off dramatically since Thanks­giving break, he said. 
The police have not reduced their emphasis on looking for disruptive parties, Cottrell said, adding that once the wea­ther warms up, "we'll be on the lookout." 
Party-goers are cooperating with police and behaving better "so far (this year)," Cottrell said. "I don't want to be prema­ture." 
"Hopefully, students have learned a lesson from the past," he said. 
No bars have been raided in South Bend this year, Cottre!l said. 
Police will raid bars if they receive information that a sub­stantial number of underage students are allowed into an es­tablishment, Cottrell said. 
In January 1987, Lee's Ribs was raided by Indiana Excise Police and city police. 200 stu­dents were cited for being minors in a bar. Lee's was raided a week later and an­other three students were cited. 
South Bend Police received the information that minors were entering Lee's and passed the facts on to the excise police, Cottrell said. 

Police received several reports about underage drink­ing before Christmas break, he said, but not enough evidence was found to justify a raid when the reports were checked. 
Excise police are also check­ing bars for underage patrons, he added. 
Even with the efforts of police, Cottrell admitted that minors will still be able to get into bars. 
"No matter what we do we're (the police) not going to stop it," he said. 
In other business, there were only six reported burglaries of off-campus homes for the month of January, Cottrell said. 
Break-ins have dropped dramatically since the ap­prehension of three juveniles last month who confessed to 25 off-campus burglaries.

Campus Coke boycott continues 
By NATASHA WILSON 
Staff Reporter 
The Anti-Apartheid Network of Notre Dame continues to strive for widespread campus awareness and support of its boycott of Coca-Cola products which it organized several months ago. 
The boycott, the network's response to the University Board of Trustees' decision last fall not to divest from South Mrica, is part of a nation-wide effort to force Coca-Cola and other American companies to divest completely from the apartheid country, said Zandra IVJ:encer, network co­chairwoman. 
Mencer said the network has asked the student body to boycott all Coke products which dominate the dining halls and campus vending mac­hines. 
"The student support has been mixed. I think a lot of people really don't understand why we're doing this," she said. · 
Some of the network's publicity efforts have been foiled by a few students who have torn down boycott posters, Mencer said. 
"I think we will get a lot more support once people are aware. Right now there are quite a few people who I've noticed aren't drinking Coke products and are going for the Pepsi machines.'' 
Pepsi products may be found in a few campus vending mac­hines, but according to the Director of Food Services W'illiam Hickey, University Food Services has a contract with Coca-Cola. 
"We've wanted to put a little sign on the Coke machines saying 'remember the boycott,' but were forbidden by the Administration to put posters on anything except bul­letin boards," Mencer said. 
The network is recognized as an official campus organiza­tion. 
Mencer said she does not ex­pect the Board to boycott Coca­Cola in the near future because the Chairman of the Board is also the president of Coca-Cola. 
She said the network's core committee intends to meet with Hickey and Administration of­ficials this spring to articulate their position further. 
''Our main purpose is to make people aware of the apar­theid issue in South Mrica and to promote our arguments for economic boycott. Our stance is complete divestment." 
As part of its campaign the network holds vigils on the steps of the Administration Building every Friday after­noon at 12: 15. 
The group plans to sponsor

Kodak dumps discs 
a Eastman Kodak Co. announced last week that it will stop production of its line of disc cameras. The suspension will continue until the company can lower its current disc camera inventory. 
Kodak developed the disc camera six years ago, hoping to lure 35 mm. camera users. The company has sold about 25 million disc cameras since 1982, and will continue to sell film to service these cameras.

Business Briefs 
Why is Kodak dropping the disc camera? Demand for the disc camera has dropped even though the price of the most expensive model is $60. Japanese manufactured 35 mm. cameras, which produce higher quality pictures, are now selling for under $100. In addition, most 35mm. cameras are easy to use, which was the disc camera's main selling point.

Federal Election Commission 
Fund raising program aims to spur Uni"versity growth 
By SUSAN COENE Business Writer 
Growth is recognized in busi­ness as the needed ingredient to ensure an active, healthy company. This is also true in the world of academics. Uni­versities are constantly setting new goals for expansion and de­velopment. 
Notre Dame is no different. 
With a clear vision of the fu­ture of academia at Notre Dame, Provost Timothy O'Meara presented former University President Father Theodore Hesburgh with "A Report on Priorities and Com­mitments for Excellence (PACE) at the University of Notre Dame" in November 1982. 
Hesburgh asked O'Meara to conduct a study and formulate a report on the status of the University and its needs for the future. The PACE Report was the result. 
With the advice of the deans of all the colleges, the PACE Report includes recommen­dations on how to strengthen the weaknesses and maintain or improve the strengths of the University. 
Its goals are to redefine the mission of life at Notre Dame. 
These include the areas of re­search, undergraduate schol­arships, graduate fellowships, new library collections and new buildings. This also en­compasses the improvement of residence life and the expan­sion of campus ministry. 
O'Meara's PACE Report in­
itiated  a  plan;  all  that  was  
needed  were  financial  re­ 
sources.  

In May of 1983 the PACE Report was published and a campaign strategy was devised. Entitled "A Strategic Moment," the campaign's goal exceeds all previous fundrais­ing drives combined; $300 mil­lion. · 
The campaign is striving to attain a level of excellence for the University. Ultimately the campaign's goal is for Notre Dame to rank among the best in both undergraduate and graduate studies. 
This, to say the least, re­quires money. 
The Strategic Moment Cam­paign is now well under way. At the time of its inauguration last May, over 70 percent of its $300 million goal had already been-achieved. Presently, the campaign's success has totaled nearly $250 million (approximately 83 percent of the goal.) 
These advances can be readily seen in the Rolfs Aquatic Center, the Eck Tennis Pavillion, the Loftus All-Sports Center, North Dining Hall and LaFortune renovations, Siegfried and Knott residence halls, the Fieldhouse, the Law School addition and the res­torations of Sacred Heart and the Main Administration Build­ing. 

Less obvious improvements include new research profes­sors, equipment, undergradu­ate scholarship funds, and 
 graduate fellowships. How are these funds raised? One means is through direct solicitation to individuals. The majority of contributors include alumni or other individ­uals who not only have the means to contribute, but also a personal interest in the better­ment ofthe University. A second group of con­tributors is largely composed of Trustees and Council mem­hers who advise the deans on the direction of their colleges and then seek out prospects for funding.. Although fewer in number, they account for the majority of the donations. Another means of raising funds is through the Special Gift Function. This strategy consists of conventions in 65 cities around the country. A group of three (a Trustee, an Officer and a Director of De­velopment) market Notre Dame, campaigning for dollars according to the needs of the University. 
Terry Fairholm, a regional director of development said, "These functions play a key role in securing funds. However, some of the desired funds are easier to attain than others." 
Fairholm continued, "For example, it is more difficult to market the Center for Social Concerns or the University Ministry projects than it is to sell athletics, as seen by the new athletic facilities on campus." 
One problem faced by fundraisers is the inevitable disproportionate collection of funds for various projects. In addition, new priorities have arisen forcing some original plans to be put on hold. This is reflected in the abundance of funds in some areas and the lack of funds in others. 
For example, an addition to Niewland Science Hall has come to light with a $500,000 grant from the Lilly Endow­ment, Inc. in October. The In­stitute for International Peace Studies is also doing well, ex­ceeding its goal of $6 million by $7.2 million. 
Unfortunately, some major priorities are having more dif­ficulty. Despite the fact that the Hesburgh Library is one of the nation's largest, the number and quality of volumes is hardly adequate. 
Fairholm said, "For some reason funding for the library is hard to come by." Its $10 mil­lion goal is short $7.3 million. 
Among the ranks of the un­derfunded also include the un­dergraduate scholarship and graduate fellowship funds. Both of these along with the li­brary endowment are crucial to the future of the University. · 
The fund raising drive has until Dec. 31, 1990 to collect the $50 million needed to reach the campaign's goal of $300 mil­lion. 
Although some concern has been expressed about the focus of the drive and its priorites, the development committee of the Strategic Moment is making a more conscience ef­fort to follow the original objec­tives of the campaign. 
The ultimate hope is that once these goals are met Notre Dame will be recognized as among America's finest aca­demic institutions. 

Trade figures to shape market 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Wall Street will be setting another trade-deficit watch in the coming week, waiting for a new set of monthly figures Friday on the nation's exports and imports. 
The mood is perhaps a little less intense than it was leading up to Jan. 15, when the Com­merce Department presented the markets with a pleasant surprise. 
The reported gap, by which 
U.S. imports exceeded exports, fell to $13.22 billion in Novem­ber, from $17:63 billion the month before. That helped to ease many investors concerns' about the outlook for the dollar, domestic interest rates and the economy. 
But the statistics for Decem­ber will still be subjected to close scrutiny by economists and market analysts. 
A single month's ·numbers are notoriously unreliable as a sign of any trend, and optimists on the trade outlook would very much like to see December data that reinforce their hopes. 
At the same time, many analysts caution that it is un­reasonable to look for more dramatic gains in the coming report. The drop in November is likely to prove a "tough act to follow," as Maury Harris, economist at Paine Webber, put it. 
"Investors will focus on the December trade figHre as a guide to whether the trade numbers for :November were closer to the trend than were last October's," said Greg Smith at Prudential-Bache Se­curities. 
Smith recalled that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had described the October figures, shortly after they were re­ported, as an aberration that was likely to be reversed in the next set of data. 
"That point of view appears to have been vindicated in No­vember," Smith observed. "I suspect that it was not a loose comment, that a lot of thought and homework had gone into it." 
By now the problem for the stock market may have gone beyond a fixation with the trade deficit. 
In the past month the dollar has steadied in foreign ex­change, interest rates have fal­len, and signs have increased that strong exports are helping to foster a brisk pace of activity in American manufacturing.

The 1988 
Young voters can affect the path of the nation 
When I first turned 18, I was thrilled. Eighteen is an important­sounding age, and I figured that I must be up for some new privileges. Well, the drinking age was raised to 21, I already had my driver's license (though my car is now in the hot little hands of my younger brother at

guest column 

home in Alabama), and I'm now quite regulated by class schedules, parietals and other University policies (though eating at the dining hall may be a very well-disguised privilege). After some reflection, I decided that I really wasn't the recipient of any major adult privileges at this particular mile­stone in my life (not being a guy, I'm not lucky enough to be able to reg­ister for the draft). But then I realized that there was one privilege I had overlooked -as do far too many people my age: the privilege of voting. 
Before scoffing, dismissing me as an idealist, spilling mustard on this page of the paper and flipping to the personals, consider this: The U.S. Census Bureau has determined that in the last presidential election only 
40.8 percent of eligible voters in the 18-24 age bracket exercised the right to vote. In that same election, 58.4 percent of 25-44 year-olds voted, 69.8 percent of 45-64 year-olds went to the polls, and 67.7 percent of those 65 and older flocked to the voting booths in support of their favorite candidates (or, more likely, to vote against the candidates they most disliked). What is most alarming to me is not the percentages themselves (though it would be nice if all voting-aged citizens would vote), but the poor participation rate of young voters in relation to the rest of the population. Why do 59.2 percent of citizens our age fail to go to the polls? Do we think we don't matter? That no one will listen to our opinions? That we're not intelligent enough to make important decisions? 
We do matter. We are an impor­tant segment of the American popu­lation, full of new ideas and new ways of looking at events and human relations. As a group we have quite an impact on society: industry spends billions of dollars each year to target the youthful segment of so­ciety through marketing and adver­tising. We can certainly have the same sort of impact in the political arena. 
This generation of young voters is a very educated group of people -in

fact, it is the most well-educated group overall in American society. More young people are going to col­lege now than ever before, and many have plans for graduate and profes­sional school. Though we may not have as much actual experience as older citizens, we do have some valu­able experience and quite a bit of knowledge of people, our country and the world. Our generation was practically raised on television, newspapers and radio -we are as aware as any other age group of what goes on around us (and I don't just mean SYRs and interhall bas­ketball games). Although we are young people enjoying college, we still do and should have a say about who governs our country and our respective states: after all, we pay taxes, drink the (polluted) water, look for jobs and live in a country that plays an active (and sometimes risky) role in world affairs. And soon we will be a part of the "real" world, more affected than ever by the gov­ernment and the people who are part of it. It seems to me that we should help determine the future of America: after all, we are the people who will be its future political leaders, businesspeople, teachers

But one little vote by a denim­bedecked college student can't pos­sibly affect anything the government does, you say.

All who fasted deserve thanks 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to take the opportu­nity, on behalf of the Notre Dame World Hunger Coalition, to thank the students who participated in last se­mester's Wednesday Lunch Fast. Certainly no one enjoys doing with­out food. This also applies to the many destitute and starving people overseas. But because of your indi­vidual sacrifices, they will not have to endure quite as much. Next week, $3,150 will be sent out to seven proj­ects located in India, Mrica and South America. At the Chol-Chol Foundations in Chile, the money is used to finance farmers' crops with good seeds and fertilizer, circum­venting the government's poorer quality seeds and interest payments. India's Paroo Prakhand Samagra Vika Pariyojna project installed a water pump and allowed them to start raising goats and pigs. The other projects, just like these two, are interested in getting the people to feed themselves, to stabilize their lives. 
Stability continues at Notre Dame 
also. I would like to extend a sincere 
thank you to the 400-plus students 
who signed up this semester for the 
Wednesday Lunch Fast. This 
reflects an increase over the last se­
mester. If everyone can make it 
through to May without breaking his 
or her commitment, over $5,000 
could be diverted to these worthy 
projects. Thanks again!

Prejudice comes from all sides 
Dear Editor: 
Are you prejudiced? This question is akin to asking people if they like South Bend weather. Yes and no. I mean, it's great in the spring, but it stinks during the winter. I find myself able to give a similar answer to the question of prejudice. Yes and no. Show me any man who is without prejudice and I will show you God. 
With all due respect to Mr. Dennis Tillman and his Viewpoint article of Feb. 2, some of the problem caused by prejudice emanates from blacks themselves. Perhaps it is my im­agination, but it sure seems easier for a black to be accepted into white circles than vice-versa. Isn't there an element of prejudice involved there? 
Further, the generalizations which accompany discussions of prejudice exceed epic proportions. I have had conversations with black friends concerning racism and have almost always come away from them feeling like we had been talking about two absolutely different breeds of white person. Neither I nor any of my friends fit their descrip­tions, and, since I can only speak for myself, I had trouble pinpointing ex­actly what raised the ire of my black friends. 
These generalizations make life equally difficult for the average, in­nocent, nonmalicious white person. For example, a banner hung from a dorm window before the Michigan State football game which read: "Notre Dame will turn Lorenzo White." To the average Notre Dame 
.....,
football attendee this is not a state­ment of white supremacy. It's a pun, a play on words, a joke. It's his name for God's sake! Unfortunately, some complained that the banner was racist, and the residents were forced to take it down. "A racist behind every rock and tree" is not a credo which is productive for any cause. 
I realize that there are serious 
cases of rasicm which exist, but let 
us try and distinguish a little more 
accurately between them and inno­
cent attempts at humor. Next time 
the question of prejudice comes up, 
ask yourself: "Do I like South Bend 
weather?"

BILL WEBB DAY 
February 12, 1998 
How do we celebrate Bill Webb Day? 
In our country, Bill Webb Day begins with the traditional Bill Webb Day break­last. At 7:00 am, roommates, sections, even entire dorms and quads sit down together lor a sumptuous feast that in­cludes buttermilk biscuits, hash brown potatoes, whole wheat hot cakes with maple syrup, scrambled eggs, steak, and freshly squeezed orange juice. 
Alter this meal. people go their sepa­rate ways for morning classes, lunch, and afternoon classes. But they !eel different. Their attitude is posrtive. They hum songs under their breath. They enjoy life. 
At 6:00 pm, the people meet again, this time for the special Bill Webb Day dinner. The original Bill Webb Day stew is served from oaken barrels into each person's Bill Webb Day dinner bowl. The stew's secret recipe is known only to a small sect of women from· outside ol Co­lumbus, Ohio, and they are responsible lor the stew's preparation and distribu­tion. If you are not able to make it to one of special Bill Webb Day dinner sites, you are encouraged to make your favorite meal and eat nwith good friends. 
Alter dinner, the crowd (which often swells into the thousands) sings the fes­tive Bill Webb Day songs ol hea~h. fer­tility, and good cheer. The music fills the night air and the dancing is often a vision of beauty. As the hour of 11 :00 pm ap­proaches, the excitement builds. At that precise moment, one individual, usually the wisest or the tallest ol the group, silences the throng and leads the group in the recitation of the Bill Webb Day inspirational message: 
Know thyself. Know thy neighbor. Appreciate the good things In life. Keap calm In times of trouble. Strive for excellence in all you do. And each night before you sleep, give thanks for life and love. 
At the conclusion of this moving cere­mony, the crowd disperses but they carry away with them a leeling of contentment. They share a common bond. They have a better insight into their own world. The message of Bill Webb Day is a message ol peace and understanding. 
Do you know Mark Taylor? Do you know how to sing? Are you free today at 3:00? If the answer to any of the above ques­tions is "yes," please come to his con­ducting class today. He needs singers!! 1st floor Crowley, 3:00 today.

The Irish soccer team has never been one to worry when it falls behind by a goal or two. 
But it sure would make things easier if the Irish took the lead from the start. 
The team fell behind in two of its four matches this weekend at an indoor tourna­ment hosted by Northwestern. While the Irish rebounded to defeat Wisconsin 2-1 in the first match, they fell short in a 2-1 shootout loss to the host school in the championship round of the 16-team tournament. 
"We've always had a great attitude when we're down a goal," said Irish head coach Dennis Grace. "But why do we have to put ourselves in a po­sition where we have to come back?" 
Playing without senior starter Steve Lowney and soph­omore keeper Danny Lyons, Notre Dame advanced to the championship round after defeating Wisconsin, Wheaton (5-1), and Loyola (1-0). 
In the first game of the cham­pionship round the Wildcats jumped to an early 1-0 lead before Irish midfielder Rolfe Behrje tallied to send the game into overtime. Northwestern won the shootout to knock Notre Dame out of the tourna­ment. 
Grace used a 16-man underclassmen-only roster for the tournament. Almost all the field players were regulars from the fall season, but the two keepers had a combined two games of fall experience. Junior Kevin Mayo and fresh­man Mike Sattan both played, with Mayo seeing most of the action in the nets. 
"Kevin did exceptional for the situation," said Grace. "He just has to get more consis­tency." 
The spring season continues this coming weekend with the St. Louis Budweiser Indoor In­vitational. Former NCAA Divi­sion I champion Southern Illinois-Edwardsville and junior college power Florissant Valley are the two featured teams in Notre Dame's bracket. Also playing in this 16­team tourney is Indiana, Evansville and Saint Louis.  
King gives royal performance 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
DURHAM, N.C. -The man who led the Blue Devils Sunday afternoon wasn't a Duke. He was a King, Billy King-Duke's defensive wizard. 
King's defensive efforts against Notre Dame's David Rivers was one of the main reasons that the fourth-ranked Blue Devils downed the Irish 70-61 at Cameron Indoor Stadium. King hampered Rivers into 3-of-17 shooting, holding Rivers to a season-low nine points. ·with only Joe Fredrick able to score consis­tently, that led to a third­straight Irish defeat. 
"Billy was magnificent," Duke head Coack Mike Krzyzewski said afterward. "When you think of all the in­dividual accomplishments, the visitor and home, that have happened at Cameron, more people will remember offen­sive accomplishments. I think when people still talk about Cameron they're going to re­member Billy's play today." 
It had been a tough week for King and his teammates, as they played four games in six days. Saturday, King had fouled out while covering N.C State's Vinny Del Negro. Del Negro scored 12 points, includ­ing the Wolfpack's last eight, as N.C. State upset Duke 77-74. 
Against Rivers, King com­mitted 1ust two personals and

drew an equal number of charges, the 13th and 14th that he's drawn this season. 
"I thought his concentration was unbelievable," Krzyzewski said of King's play, "especially when you're tired and playing one of the top players in the United States. If you don't have mental strength, you're going to put him (Rivers) on the line. He only shot four free throws. If you look at their stats, he shoots 14 or 15 some games." 
"I thought I committed stupid fouls," King said. "Today I committed two but I was in a better flow of the 
-
game. Usually when I don't commit fouls early, I play more aggressively." 
King's size, he's 6-6 against a 6-0 Rivers had a lot to do with Rivers' poor shooting. But what also contributed to that was that when Rivers was able to beat King, other Blue Devils slid over to help out. 
"The middle was open, and 
. I got past King several times," Rivers said. "There were guys coming over to help. They really rotate to pick up the open man. "It's not so much his size. He played good defense, and had a lot of help when I got by him." Irish head coach Digger Phelps said that not attacking Duke at its weaknesses cost the Irish the game. "To beat Duke, you need to attack the baseline," Phelps said. "You need sideline penetration, force them to give weak side help, then attack from there. For some reason, we just didn't do that. "David went down middle. He challenged King there, King wins, David goes 0-for-life. We just didn't do the things we should have -penetrate, read, adjust and kick it out." King, who averages just 4.8 points per game, pumped in a season-high 11 points Sunday, and that just added to his feeling for the game. "Even if he had scored 25, and we had won, I would have been satisfied," said King, who had three steals. "The fact that we won and he got nine points is like a dream to me. That I scored 11 makes the dream even better." Rivers, though, had a more down-to-earth view of the after­noon's events. "I've played against guys who were equally as good if not better," Rivers said. "King's one of the best defensive players. Things just didn't go my way, and that's all there is to it."

Milers overshadow Irish performances 

The Notre Dame track team performed very well 
By PETE GEGEN 
Sports Writer 
A sub-four minute mile race overshadowed what was also a very impressive showing by the Notre Dame track and field team at its inaugural Meyo In­vitational Saturday. 
The Irish captured three firsts and two very impressive efforts amid an impressive group of athletes who were looking to qualify for the NCAA championships on the Meyo track. 
But the big story was Arizona's John Quade, who won the Meyo mile with a time of 
3:57.3. After sitting in the back of the pack the first three laps, Quade passed Notre Dame graduate Chuck Aragon and Darrel Frerker on the last turn to break the tape first. 
"I really haven't had any track workouts," said a surprised Quade. "My previ­ous best was 4:03. Everyone in the race was a quality runner. I thought if I kept up with the field I would do all right." 
Mike O'Connor, Notre Dame's entry in the Me)'O mile, used the opportunity to run a personal-best time of 4:04.5.

practice," Gavin said. "I wasn't that nervous. I think I hit the ones when it counted." 
As a team, the Irish hit 29-of­39 attempts from the line (74 percent) in the game. 
Notre Dame also benefitted from Duke's poor shooting. The Irish packed in a 2-3 zone throughout the game. The gamble paid off, as Duke shot just 30 percent from the field (24-of-79) for the game. 
All-America forward Chris Moreland led the Blue Devils with 17, while Paula Andersen had 13 and Leigh Morgan added 12. 
Although he scratched on his 
best toss, Notre Dame's Tom 
Kraus continued his domina­
tion in the shot put, winning the 
event with a toss of 16.44 
meters (54 feet). 

Despite racing against five 
hurdlers with better personal­
best times, Notre Dame's 
Glenn Watson won the 55-meter

Men fencers win again, women fall to Wayne St. 
By CHRIS FILLIO Sports Writer 
Irish fencing head coach Mike DeCicco felt that this weekend's dual meets would serve as a benchmark for the Irish fencing teams. Unfortun­ately, the outcomes produced some mixed results. 
The mens' teams cruised to easy victories over Wayne State (18-9), Ohio State (24-3), Nortwestern (20-7), Chicago (21-6), Michigan (24-3), Oakland-MI (23-4), and Case­Western Reserve (21-6). In the process they improved their undaunted record of victories this year to 22-0. 
However, the women's teams did not fare quite as well. While they completed the two-day Midwest Circuit meet with an overall4-1 record, their one loss came against Wayne St., the second time in as many weeks. 
The women came out of the starting blocks in excellent form, compiling an initial 4-1 edge over their Midwest rivals 
CENTRAL 
from Wayne St. Thi& was quickly turned around, however, when they dropped nine straight matches before yielding by a fina~tally of 11-5. The women then polished off OSU (11-5), Northwestern (10­6), Oakland (14-2), and Case­Western Reserve (14-2) en route to a seasonal mark of 17­2. 
One special highlight for the women's team was the perfor­mance of senior captain Molly Sullivan. After a disappointing 2-2 record against Wayne St. last week, Sullivan redeemed herself by posting an impres­sive 3-1 mark against that same school this weekend. In the process, Sullivan became the women's all-time victories leader at 160-14, surpassing last year's captain Cindy Weeks. 
Other top showings came from Anne Barreda (7-3), Lynn Kadri (5-3), and Kristin Kralicek (4-4). Completing the scoring for the Irish women was Brenda Leiser (2-4), M.J. Sully (1-3), Stephanie McNeill (7-1), Margaret Connor (5-4), Elizabeth Varga (7-2), and Kim Sollinger (7-1) . In achieving a 32-7 season record, Lynn Kadri garnered her first monogram in her initial year at Notre Dame. 
Once again the mens' teams overpowered the competition and extended their win streak even further. Team captain Yehuda Kovacs (10-2), sop­homores Joel Clark (6-1) and 
·Colin Gumbs (7-1), and Derek Holeman (9-1) set the pace for an easy victory in the foil com­petition. In addition, foilists Phil Leary (9-0), Gary Galeziewski (5-0), Fred Trayers (6-0), and Kent Kroener (3-3) all gained their first monograms. In the sabre competition, captain Tim Collins (6-1), soph­omore Danny Yu (6-2), and Steve Rawlings ( 4-1) all ended the two-day event with impres­sive finishes. Also in sabre, Lesek Nowosielski (7-0), Jim Reilly (5-0), ChrisBauger (5-0) and Dave Kirby (3-0) went un­defeated. These four sabremen, along with Elie Ker-

we made too many mistakes in our own end. You don't see Lance (Madson) make that mistake too often (regarding the first goal). He's kept us in a lot of games -he's entitled to a couple of those. 

"I'm pleased that we went out and did what we had to do -work really hard. It's great to get the win, but we can't be lazy early." 
Schafer's squad played an­other tight first period on Sat­urday night, but couldn't find the net as the period ended with the teams deadlocked at zero. The Irish had a man advantage for the first two minutes of the second period, but it looked like the Falcons were on the power play. Notre Dame could not clear their zone to attack and Air Force picked up two shor­thanded goals to take the wind out of the Irish sails. 
But five minutes later, Bob Bilton scored to put the Irish 

:-~ 
on the board, and the second period ended with Air Force leading 2-1. 

Early in the third, a McNeill slap shot deflected off defen­seman Pat Foley's skate and into the net to tie the score at two. Once again, it looked like the Irish had stemmed the tide and were ready to ride their momentum to a win. 
But again, the Falcons an­swered the challenge, scoring to retake the lead. And again, Foley came back with a goal, this time a blistering shot from the point. The game stayed tied at three until 2:08 remained in 
-
the contest. Sophomore Tim Kuehl settled the issue as Han­zel slid Kuehl the puck across the goal crease and Kuehl ham­mered it past Moes. Typically, Schafer had mixed emotions regarding the win. "I'll look at the tape, but I still don't know how we won this game," said Schafer. "A lot of credit has to go to Lance Madson for keeping us in a po­sition where we could come back and win it, and Bob Her­ber played a very good, consis­tent game. But I was really dis­appointed with how badly 
outplayed we were in the first two periods. Our passing wasn't too sharp, and for a while there it looked like we were ready to just roll over and be beaten. But heck, we just keep coming back, don't we. I give the guys a lot of credit." 
The sweep this weekend runs the Irish winning streak to 12 games and takes their record to 21-2-2. Next weekend, Notre Dame plays at home against Villanova.

Prior to the competition, Notre Dame's record was 3-0 including decisive victories over W~stern Michigan and Nortern Illinois. This is in sharp contrast to last year's early season woes when the Irish dropped two out of their first three competitions.

ND women upset 17th-ranked Duke 78-66 


By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
DURHAM, N.C. -You're playing the 17th-ranked team in the country, and you're two leading scorers and rebounders are sitting on the bench with foul trouble. Reserves who hadn't given you much in a loss to the number­four team just three nights ear~ lier are on the court in their place. 
It doesn't sound very promis­ing, right? 
Wrong. 

Notre Dame's women's bas­ketball team went through all that and upset 17th-ranked Duke 78-66 Saturday evening. The victory marks the first win over a Top 20 team for the Irish, who upped their record to 13-6, and stopped Duke's 21-game non-conference winning streak. 
Sara Liebscher, who got her first start for Notre Dame, and Lisa Kuhns, who Liebscher replaced in the starting lineup because of Kuhns' injured knee, led the Irish with 19 points each. 
"I never though that with Heidi (Bunek, who entered the 
Bench scoring, free throws key win 
game averaging 18.9 points per game, and 8.8 rebounds) and Sandy (Botham 15.5 and 8.2) in foul trouble in the first half and fouling out in the second, that we'd be up seven at the half and win by 12.'' said Irish head coach Muffet McGraw. "The 
1bench just played great. 

"It was a big win for our pro­
gram. It ranks way up there 
because it was such team ef­
fort." 

Botham and Bunek were both 
on the bench by the 15-minute 
mark of the first half, Botham 
with two personals, and Bunek 
with three. The Irish were 
leading 10-7, but with their top 
scorers out, it looked like that 
lead wouldn't last. It didn't. 
The Blue Devils went up 12­
10, before Kuhns hit a three­
point shot from the top of the 
key. The teams traded a pair 
of baskets before Kuhns hit an­
other trey from the right wing 
to put the Irish up for good at 
20-19. 

Kuhns would hit another 
three-pointer in the half. That 
and Liebscher's shooting kept 
the Irish ahead. Liebscher shot 
five-for-five from the floor and 
two-for-two in the half, and the Irish led 39-32 at the end of the period. 
"I've been feeling more con­fident lately," Liebscher said of her first start. "I was glad to get the chance." 
If the first half was nerve­racking, the second half was enought to cause Valium addic­tion. The Irish didn't score from the field for the last six­and-a half minutes. Botham waved good-bye at the 4:15 mark, and Bunek followed 1: 30 later. 
But the Irish scored their last 21 points from the foul line as the Blue Devils turned up the heat. 
"I told them to take their time and don't panic," McGraw said of the final minutes. "We had three fresh­man on the floor for a while and Mary Gavin, whose our worst free-throw shooter. It was a little shakey for a while." 
Gavin, who entered the game shooting 50 percent from the stripe, sank six-of-nine at­tempts down the streth while bringing the ball up the court against the Duke pressure.

Clutch scoring elusive again, Duke tops ND 70-61 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 

DURHAM, N.C. -Notre Dame's 70-61 loss to fourth­ranked Duke Sunday bore a striking resemblance to the games of the last week. The Irish were unable to score at the end of the game, got scoring from only one player, and, like their previous two games, came out on the losing end. Notre Dame's record now stands at 12-7. 
But the big difference in Sun­day's game was that instead of David Rivers carrying the scoring load, it was sophomore Joe Fredrick who came up with the big scores, finishing with a game-and career-high 23 points. Rivers, hindered by Duke's Billy King, shot just 3­of-17 from the field and finished with nine points, ending a streak of 31 straight double­figure games. Gary Voce had 12, and that was just about it for the Irish scoring. 
"We've got to have (scoring) from everybody;'' Rivers said of Fredrick's performance. 
"We don't have enough people scoring. When I have a prob­lem, someone else has to step forward." 
The Blue Devils, after some early sluggishness, which may have something to do with playing their second game in as many days and fourth in six, got scoring form everyone, es­pecially from Danny Ferry in the stretch when they were milking the clock. 
Ferry finished with 16 to lead Duke, while Kevin Strickland had 14, Robert Brickey had 13, and King had 11. 
The Irish started off well, opening a 30-22 lead with 3:39 left in the first half. But the

Irish shoot down Air Force
.._ . 
with thrilling comebacks 
By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 

If you were among the 3,213 fans that packed the JACC for part or all of the Notre Dame hockey team's sweep of Air Force this weekend, you didn't leave disappointed. 
Unless you're a Falcon fan. 

But even then, it would be hard not to appreciate the in­tense action generated by both teams during the series. The Irish won 5-4 on Friday night and took a 4-3 decision on Sat­urday, keeping long-shot hopes for an NCAA playoff berth alive. 
Neither win came easily for the Irish. On Friday, the Notre Dame faithful braced for a long evening when, 33 seconds into the game, Irish goaltender Lance Madson put a poorly­handled clearing attempt right onto the stick of the Falcons' John Manney. Manney flipped the puck into a wide-open net to give Air Force a 1-0 lead. 
Outside of that fluke goal, both teams played the first per­iod evenly. But early in the second, Air Force threatened to blow the game open, pound­ing in two goals to make the score 3-0. The Irish had plenty of opportunities throughout the middle period, but none were converted until Kevin Markovitz slapped in a pretty feed from captain Mike McNeill on the power play. That cut the Air Force lead to 3-1, and the Irish momentum mounted. 

With six and a half minutes left in the period, Bob Bilton tapped a centering pass right between the legs of Falcon goalie John Moes. Less than a minute later, Thomas Smith fired a shot past Moes' out­stretched glove to knot the score at three. The stage was set for a dramatic third period. 
Early in the final stanza, with Smith off the ice with 1:48 remammg in his minor penalty, Bob Herber fed Bob Bilton on a 2-on-1 breakaway, and Bilton blasted the puck off of Moes' pads as he dove to his left. The comeback complete, the Irish looked to run out the clock. 
But Air Force would not go down easily. Shortly after Bil-ton's goal, the Falcons, again on the power play, scored as John Delich rifled a shot that hit the bottom of the crossbar and dropped staight down on top of the goal line to tie the game at 4-4. 
Notre Dame's Matt Hanzel fi­nally finished the scoring with 
4:25 left in the game as he sneaked a shot past Moes from 20 feet out. Air Force had several chances to tie again (including a shot 10 seconds after the game-winning goal that struck the goalpost) but could not convert. 
Notre Dame Head Coach Ric Schafer, as he has done several times in the past, saw both good and bad aspects of Friday . night's win. 
"I have to give our guys all the credit in the world for com­ing back like they did," said Schafer, in his first year as mentor of the Irish. "But we have to start out better than we did. Granted, Air Force is a great team and they helped make us look bad. But early on, 
our passes weren't crisp and Joe Fredrick was one of the bright spots In Notre Dame's loss to fourth-ranked Duke Sunday. Dennis Corrigan recaps the game at see SWEEP, page 14 left.
