Partner discusses corporate governance 
By MATT BRAMANTI 
News Writer 
Larry !Heger, a partner with South Bend-based accounting firm Crowe Chizek, spoke Tuesday in the Mendoza College of Business' Giovanini Commons on "Good Corporate Governance: More than Compliance." 
Hinger said the subject of his talk reflected the post-Enron corporate environment. "(Governance! is a topic that's gone from the boardroom to the breakfm;t table," he said. 
Hieger said that during his nxperiencc with major account­ing firms, he's been privy to the whole gamut of ethical situation. 
"In 29 years at Arthur Andersen. I was in on over 1,000 audit committee meetings," Heiger said. "I've seen the good, the bad and the ugly in audit committees." Heiger left Andersen after its collapse in 2002, when the firm was found guilty of obstructing justice in the Enron case by shredding documents related to the case. lie then joined Crowe Chizek, the nation's eighth-largest accounting firm, where he heads the corporate governance and risk management department. 
In his pn~scntation, Hieger said the idea of corporate gover­nance should be explicitly defined in order to be studied. "It's the systems and processes an organization has in place to

Faculty, students laud turnitin.com

Assistant News Editor 
More than one-and-a-half years after purchasing a contract from turnitin.com -a service that allows faculty members to check student papers for Internet pla­giarism -faculty and students say the policy has been relatively effective at both deterring plagia­rism and catching its occurrence. 
The University purchased the service in May 2002 at a cost of about $6,000 per year, according to student honor code officer Kelly Bennett. Thomas Flint, fac­ulty honor code officer, said the service merely acts as one tool faculty can use to detect plagia­rism and is not meant to be a def­inite measure of cheating. 
"Our goal in providing this serv­ice to faculty was to offer them a quick and relatively simple way of determining whether a paper that in some way appeared suspi­cious included material from Internet sources," he said. 
Flint said that approximately 300 papers have been submitted to the service in each of the three

INSIDE COLUMN 
Just get over it 
I'm sick and tired of hearing about all of the "political apathy" in the 2004 Notre Dame Student Body Presidential elections. 
First of all, this opinion only really seems to be 
voiced by Charlie Ebersol's camp and a few mem­bers of various campus media outlets. Unfortunately, this group has been very vocal 

recently. I'd like Chris Federico to take this space to voice a dis­senting opinion. Sports Writer 
How, in an election where 1,000 votes swung from the primary to the runoff elections, can you say voters were apathetic? 
If anything they were determined -determined to see a candidate they did not want to hold the office of President lose the election. So those students that came out to vote in the second election or that changed their vote from Ebersol to Adam Istvan made an emphatic statement as to whom they wanted to win the election. 
And if anyone has a right to com­plain about the voting procedure, it's Istvan. Based on the grade-by· grade breakdown of the primary election and the final Senate vote. it appeared Istvan carried a vast majority of off-campus votes (which is roughly 1,600 students -or near­ly an entire class), yet he only got credit for the vote of one senator for this, while Ebersol got the same vote for carrying Carroll Hall and its 100 or so residents. 
I also find it interesting that the upperclassmen -those students who have been here the longest and would know the most about campus policies, campus life and the track records of the candidates -voted en masse for Istvan. 
Finally, to criticize students for voting against Ebersol in spite of the fact that he may have more experi­ence in student government is to ignore a trend in American democ­racy in the last century or so. There are elements that come into play in elections other than experience and connections (of which Ebersol had many). These are things such as character, charisma and amicability (of which, many voters would argue, Ebersol was short). 
Clinton won the presidency in 1996 because he was charismatic. Reagan won in 1980 because he was famous. Kennedy won in 1960 because he was good-looking, even though Nixon had significantly more experience in politics. 
In closing, I'd like to say to those still-frustrated supporters of Ebersol and Leito, you lost. Sorry. Get over it and move on to something else. 
But to those who say this election was a farce and that the student body didn't take their voting respon­sibilities seriously, just whom exact­ly are you trying to kid?

He emphasized that in situa­tions of serious ethical failure, not only the shareholders suffer. 
"How many employees at Arthur Andersen lost their jobs? About 88,000," Riegert said. "Governance failures don't just afTect the shareholders of a com­pany; they afTect the employees, customers, suppliers, retirees and the communities they're in." 
He went on to cite studies by the· University of Michigan, Columbia Law Review, the Journal of Economics, Business Week and McKinsey & Company, saying that strong governance structures improve return on investment. 
"At the end of the day, the studies concluded the same thing: companies that fall in the good governance bucket outper­formed companies that don't," he said. 
The 1999 Business Week study concluded that companies with the most highly rated boards average 51.7 percent in share­holder returns, while the worst boards dragged their companies down to an average-12.9 per­cent return. 
Rieger said shareholders should maintain vigilance over their boards by demanding shareholder rights. "If you've got strong shareholder rights, and the shareholders don't like what

He also stressed the impor­tance of a company-wide ethical culture, saving that formal dccu~ ments are no(enough. 
"You can have all the ethics policies you want," Rieger said. "If you don't have accountability, it just doesn't work." 
As an example, Rieger cited instances in which the Enron board of directors issued waivers, specifically allowing for departures from the company's code of conduct by Andrew Fastow, the company's former CFO. 
Fastow engaged in the buying and selling of corporate assets in the name of partnerships he con­trolled -a conflict of interest under the Enron code of con­duct. However, board members permitted the transactions, which allowed the Houston ener­gy-trading giant to keep billions of dollars in debt off its books, while reporting artificially high profits. 
Rieger said that when he joined Andersen in 1973, accountability structures were in place. In one instance, Andersen decided to require stringent accounting rules for savings & loan institutions. Andersen's interpretation was more conser­vative and strict than its major competitors. However, Andersen didn't budge, even at the insis­tence of big clients. 
However, Rieger said that spir­it in Andersen had been destroyed. 
Beer 101 was educational as well as entertaining. "It was the right amount of history, technical information and lighthearted stuff," he said. "You get a lot for your money." 
Herter said that for the month of·March, Legends will feature a variety of stouts, an Irish-style beer, in honor of St. Patrick's Day. 
"We'll have several new beers, including several Celtic beers," he said. 
Beer 101 marks the first of a three-part series of events at Legends, said student worker Courtney Schuster. On March 30, the pub will sponsor Wine 101, with the aim of teaching students the intricacies of selecting the right wine. In April, Legends will host an event about the etiquette of drinking in business situa­tions.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -India and Pakistan agreed Tuesday to a timetable for peace talks both sides hope will end a bitter history of enmity and mistrust, striking the deal at a closed-door meeting of diplomats at a mountain retreat not far from their disput­ed border region.

"Things arc moving in a positive direction," India's Foreign Secretary Shashank, who uses one name, said Tuesday after arriving in the Pakistani capital. Islamabad. 
The agreement, announced in a Pakistan Foreign Ministry statement, will be finalized Wednesday during a meeting between Shashank and his Pakistani counterpart, Hiaz Khokhar.

FOHT POLK, La. -President Bush sought to buck up troop morale at a base that has supplied more than 10,000 soldiers to the war on terrorism -and lost a dozen in Iraq -vowing Tuesday that "the enemy will be defeated." 
"My resolve is the same as it was on the day when I walked in the rubble of.the twin towers." Bush said, his voice breaking. "I will not relent until this threat to America is removed." 
Bush spoke to a sea of thousands of rowdy troops here, who responded with hearty howls of "hoo-ah!" at his applause lines. "There is no doubt that the enemy will be defeated and freedom will prevail." he said. 
"America depends on our military to meet dangers abniad and keep our country safe," Bush said. "The American people appreciate your sacrifice."

Kerry wins Wisconsin primary 
Edwards finishes a suprisingly close second; Dean likely to be out of running 
Associated Press 
John Kerry stuck to his winning ways Tuesday, but barely. John Edwards fin­ished a surprisingly close second in Wisconsin, estab­lishing himself as the front­runner's sole rival as the Democratic presidential race thundered toward a 10-state showdown March 2. 
Howard Dean trailed far behind, winless in 17 con­tests, his candidacy doomed less than a month after he stood atop the Democratic field, only to fall swiftly as voters had their say in Iowa, New Hampshire and beyond. 
Close race or not, Kerry said, "A win is a win." 
Edwards, his dream of a head-to-head matchup now a reality, declared, "We'll go full-throttle to the next group of states." 
He pledged to campaign in each of the 10 states holding primaries or caucuses March 2, including California, New York and Ohio, and awarding 1,151 delegates, more than half the total needed to claim the nomination.

cases this year were actually detected using turnitin.com. He said the others were discovered easily through the use of Internet search engines like Google. Flint says that this fact does not point to the failure of the service, but rather its effectiveness as a deter­rent. 
"I don't think this points to tur­nitin's being a failure ... my guess would be that its availability to fac­ulty has to some extent served as a deterrent to students tempting to cheat. That was surely our hope," he said. 
Faculty members such as Dan Lindley, assistant professor of political science, say that they strongly believe in deterrence with respect to cheating. Lindley said he frequently gives detailed lec­tures in his courses that both deter people from and teach people about cheating and how to avoid it. In addition, each class syllabus makes reference to Lindley's abili­ty to use turnitin.com per the Honor Code's guidelines and fur­ther states that he will be "furious and feel personally betrayed if anyone cheats in my class." 
"I teach about deterrence, I believe in deterrence and my poli­cies reflect that," he said. 
Lindley said he has not yet caught anyone cheating .in his classes, but also said he would not hesitate to vigorously prosecute any student who did so. 
"If I caught somebody cheating, there's no way I wouldn't prose­cute to the fullest extent," he said. 
Bennett said she feels most stu­dents don't have a problem with faculty members' ability to use tur­nitin.com. 
"Those who don't cheat should­n't be worried, and that is by far the majority of students at Notre Dame," she said. 
Sophomore Mark Basola agrees that cheating occurs rather infre­quently on campus. 
"I believe that cheating is very uncommon here," he said. "Students who have come to Notre Dame have arrived here through their own hard work and talent, for the most part." 
Despite the low occurrence of Honor Code cases, Flint said he believes that much cheating goes unreported, as faculty members either may not wish to engage in the lengthy process or choose to

handle matters internally. He also said students often refuse to turn in their friends as the Honor Code expects. Flint is advancing the idea of a "Let's Make a Deal" policy, a subject he explained in several let­ters-to-the-editor written earlier this academic year, that could modify the reluctance to report cases. 
The policy proposes faculty members be allowed to directly confront a student about cheating and mutually negotiate a punish­ment for the offense. A signed agreement by both parties would then be forwarded to the associate provost's office, which would keep a tile of the agreement and impose additional penalties should the stu­dent engage in future cheating. In his column, Flint noted that the number of cases at Pennsylvania State University rose from six to 400 the year after this policy was implemented. 
Flint said that although he sees several disadvantages with the "Let's Make a Deal" policy, he believes its implementation may prove more beneficial than the current system. 
"On the whole, I'm inclined toward making the change, but I think further discussion is still needed, and it's vital that students be engaged in this discussion." 
Flint said that the University Code of Honor Committee is cur­rently considering recommending the policy to University officials, but said he is unsure if the Committee will ultimately make the recommendation and when the new policy would be imple­mented, should the decision occur.

Approximately 60,000 visitors from over 100 countries will attend the show, and Jolitz will have the potential to sell his concept to prospective buyers and receive employment offers from interested companies. 
Although he is personally excited by the award and has already received several employment offers, Jolitz also realizes the impact that his award will have on the Notre Dame art design program. "It's a big opportunity because Notre Dame is going to get a lot of press," he said. 'Tm happy for the design department."

Stewart's case looks stronger 
NEW YOHK -A federal judge on Tuesday further limited the government's effort to prove Martha Stewart and her stockbroker conspired to lie about Stewart's sale of ImClone Systems stock. 
The judge blocked prosecutors from putting into evidence a voice mail that broker Peter Bacanovic left for Stewart on Feb. 4, 2002, the day she was first interviewed by the govern­ment in the ImClone investigation. 
"The fact that he tried to contact her really isn't evidence of anything, other than that they talked to each other sometimes," U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum said. 
The ruling was the latest in a string of set­backs for the government as it tries to present a case that Stewart and Bacanovic worked together to hatch a cover story for why Stewart sold 3,928 shares of ImClone Systems stock on Dec. 27, 2001. 
Disney buys Jim Henson's Muppets 
LOS ANGELES -The Walt Disney Co. said Tuesday it will buy the "Muppets" characters. including Kermit, Miss Piggy and others, from The Jim Henson Co. 
Financial terms of the deal, which also includes Henson's "Bear in the Big Blue House" franchise, were not disclosed. 
The deal, which is expected to close in about two months, culminates a decades-long pur­suit of the Muppets by Disney, which came close to acquiring the characters in 1990. The deal fell apart shortly after the death of com­pany founder Jim Henson. 
The company then was bought by German media company EM.TV, which sold it back to the I Jenson family last year. 
The deal does not include the Sesame Street characters, such as Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch. who were sold earlier by EM.TV to the Sesame Workshop. 
Negotiations ·between Disney and the I lenson family continued about six months. 
The Muppet characters already exist in Disney theme parks in a 3D film, while "Bear in the Big Blue House" is a long-running show on the Disney cable television channel.

Cingular buys AT&T Wireless 
Merger creates the nation's largest cellular carrier with 46 million subscribers 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Cingular Wireless agreed to pay nearly $41 billion in cash to buy AT&T Wireless Services to create the nation's largest mobile phone company. raising concern among consumer advocates that it may hurt competition and impede lower prices. 
The deal announced Tuesday between the sec­ond and third largest U.S. wireless companies would create a cellular giant with 46 million subscribers and 70,000 employees. Current market leader Verizon Wireless has 37.5 million customers. 
The deal -subject to approval by AT&T Wireless shareholders and federal regulators -would be a boon for Atlanta-based Cingular's efforts to cut costs, fill service gaps and expand its spectrum, or radio frequency, in several key U.S markets, thus enabling it to offer wireless Internet access at broad­band speed. 
"This combination is expected to create cus­tomer benefits and growth prospects neither company could have achieved on its own and will mean better coverage, improved relia­bility, enhanced call quality and a wide array of new and innovative services," said Stan Sigman, presi­dent and chief executive of Cingular, who will continue to lead the company. 
Some fear the merger could reduce the fierce competition that has driv­en down prices in the U.S. cellular market, trimming the number of national players from six to five. 

"Losing a competitor in this kind of market hurts consumers, especially when you're merging the big players," said Mark Cooper, director of research at the Washington-based Con­sumer Federation of America. "It's not five and six that's merging. It's two and three, and that's a much bigger impact on competition." 


Guzman and Co. analyst Patrick Comack said he doesn't expect prices to go up if the deal is approved: "You still have some very aggressive competitors out there." 
Cingular, a joint venture between SBC Communications Inc. of San Antonio and BellSouth Corp. of Atlanta, said it will pay $15 cash per share, valuing Redmond, Wash.­based AT&T Wireless at $40.7 billion. Cingular also will assume $6 billion of AT&T Wireless debt. 
The combined company will carry the Cingular name. Once a deal is approved, billing and other operational functions will be merged, though there will be no immediate effect on customers. said Ralph de Ia Vega, Cingular's chief operating officer. 
Federal regulators may ask the combined company to divest certain assets where they overlap, he said. But he said the com­panies believe that should­n't be necesary. 
"Even in areas of over­lap, there is sufficient com­petition not to warrant it," he said. 
As for possible job cuts or management changes, de Ia Vega indicated there could be some, though he would not elaborate. 
Comack, the Guzman and Co. analyst, said sig­nificant layoffs arc expect­ed because there is so much duplication. 
"They don't need the AT&T Wireless employees at all. They might save some salesman, but every­thing is redundant," Comack said. "Cingular doubled their customer base and doubled their spectrum, but they can run that with the same amount of employees." 

CORPORATE SCANDAL 
Italian company deals with arrests 
Associated Press 
ROME -The scandal engulfing Parmalat widened Tuesday as police arrested seven people, including the son, daughter and brother of jailed company founder Calisto Tanzi, and placed another suspect under house arrest. 
The latest round of arrests -the biggest batch since December ­highlights the fall from grace of a family that was once held up as a model of Italy's capitalism. 
Stefano and Francesca Tanzi, Calista's adult children. were picked up Tuesday in their homes in Parma, the northern city near the company's headquarters, and taken to the city's prison where their father is also being held. 
The two are suspected of fraudu­lent bankruptcy and criminal asso­ciation, said Maurizio Raponi of the tax police division in nearby Bologna. 
Stefano Tanzi, son of Calisto, sat on the boards of Parmalat and La Coloniale SpA, the family's holding company. But in soccer-mad Italy, he was best known as the president of Parma Calcio, a club the Tanzis bought in 1990 and which soon became the family's pride and joy. 
Stefano Tanzi stepped down from the posts in the wake of the scandal last month and was seen crying when he walked out of Parma's Tardini stadium after his resigna­tion. 
His sister Francesca sat on the soccer team's board. but her main job was to head Parmatour, the family's tourism business. one of Italy's largest. 
They have both denied any wrongdoing. 
"All the things they say he did I've honestly never known anything about and know nothing about," Francesca Tanzi said of her father in an interview with state-run RAI TV a few weeks ago. 
Calisto Tanzi, however, has told interrogators that up to $640 mil­lion was diverted from Parmalat to cover losses by the family's tourism businesses. Investigators now believe that a total of $1.15 billion was diverted from Parmalat to the Tanzis' travel business and other family activities, according to news reports.

"You can't baby-sit these kids, you can't drag them by the hand every time," Picon said. "It takes an assertive. mature person to pay attention to these issues and to engage in them too."

ence made some of their points less influential. most students agreed that the need to address perceptions about race on campus is glaring. 
"My problem is walking down the quad and seeing people who look at me wondering if I only got in because of the color of my skin," said Gabriel Torres. a junior. Other students agreed that regardless of the legacies. ath­letes. women and other benefici­aries that often get thrown into the mix. any discussion of affirma­tive action will inevitably be inter­twined with race. 
"You try to tiptoe around it like it's a policy issue," Ukachi Okoronkwo. a sophomore, said. "But it is a racial issue. Racism exists ... it's not something you can turn your back on." 
"We do need this crutch," she continued, referring to a metaphor that has been associat­ed with using affirmative action as a tool for minority empowerment. "This country has broken our legs." 
Joyce Randall, a sophomore, also insisted that "you can't elimi­nate racial preference from the argument," and reminded listen­ers that the initial purpose of affir­mative action. when proposed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965, was to create a level playing field. 
"All I really want is my opportu­nity," she said. "I want to come from my poor Chicago neighbor­hood to go to Notre Dame -even if I need special help to get there." 
However. other speakers dis­agreed that minorities needed an extra boost. leading into the issue of fairness in applicants' qualifica­tions. 
"The application process is the entire process -the whole per­son. not 'you're black, you get in,"' said junior Demetrius Hall. "It's 'you're black, you're salutatorian, you have a 3.8 GPA, your SAT is 1160 but that's because your mom couldn't afford to pay for prep courses ... so let me give her a second look." 
Speaking from firsthand experi­ence with the Notre Dame admis­sions process, First Year of Studies adviser and former admissions counselor Christy Fleming contra­dicted the assumption that affir­mative action results in less quali­fied minority applicants taking "spots" from more qualified white applicants for the sole reason of race. 
"If we took that [racial] hook off their application, they'd be here anyway," Fleming said, listing off recent figures of black enrollment. "If you think that one of 6 7, one of 74, one of 90 took a spot from a white student, you are gravely mistaken." 

Discussion also focused on the performance of minority studcnl<> once they reach the University. Senior Andrea dcVries said that although she is black. her own "extra step" came from a phone call from an uncle who sits on the Board of Trustees-and that nei­ther should matter. 
"I don't know if I needed that extra step, but that's not my con­cern -my concern is what I do once I'm here," she said. 
Case reinforced deVries' argu­ment. praising minority students who arc hall presidents and exceptional student leaders. She warned the audience, whites and minorities alike. not to fall into the trap of thinking about admittance to Notre Dame as an entitlement. 
"Being at Notre Dame is a privi­lege, not a right," Case said. "No one has a right to be here -you earn it ... you prove that you belong here." 
Two faculty members with exceptional perspectives on race at Notre Dame also weighed in. Chandra Johnson -a self­described affirmative action appli­cant as a 38-year old black female in 1992 who is now an assistant to University president Edward Malloy-praised students in attendance for engaging in an intellectual discussion instead of an angry one. 
She added that students did not need to experience guilt about the racial tension that exists today. 
"Nobody here created this situa­tion -we were born into it and no one should feel guilty," Johnson said. "But we arc responsible for exploding categories ... your gen­eration will break down the cate­gories my generation has put in place." 
Peace studies professor George Lopez. who moderated the discus­sion. closed with similar empathy. 
"This is also a faculty crisis ­we're with you in this," he said. "Professors [are expected to I teach and certifY about a world that our University doesn't represent." 
"Everyone here is privileged by a choice," he continued. "We need more ability to choose. to make the mix look like the world that's out there and the world from which you came."

What's goin' on? 
In the hopes of restoring a smidgen of current events knowledge to the strictly Observer-informed Notre Dame student body, what follows is an unbiased synopsis of some of the past week's most significant news stories. 
Well. sort of. Joey Falco 
The recent announcement that Iran will begin selling

has angered many non-proliferation activists throughout the world, even though Iranian officials insist that it will only be for "peaceful use." 
This kind of reminded me of the time when an upperclassman told me that Roofies would only make my beer taste better, and we all know how that night ended up... 
At Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, controversy arose when a group of College Republicans created a "White­Only" scholarship in order to protest the minority scholarships offered by schools throughout the nation. While their inten­tions may have been noble, many college officials felt that the group went too far when they started hanging "Non­Handicapped Parking Only" signs in park­ing places that were even closer than the actual handicapped spots. 
Not too far away at Harvard University, a similar buzz was created when adminis­trators approved a student sex magazine that would feature nude photographs of Harvard undergrads. The ramifications of this enormous leap toward liberalism sent shockwaves across America, and even spurred typically conservative Notre Dame administrators to consider the pro­duction of a similar scandalous publica­tion in which McGlinn girls would pose for shots that show a little bare ankle. 
In New York City, the Yankees continued their monopolization of baseball's top players by adding Alex Rodriguez to their already dominant roster. When asked to comment, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner calmly stated, "My plan for world domination is almost complete. Right now, we're working on negotiations 

with Heaven that would send us Jesus 
Christ to fill in our hole at second base in exchange for Ruben Sierra and a minor leaguer to be named later." 
Back here on campus, the administra­tion has cruelly turned down a proposi­tion for an AIDS benefit concert that would have featured U2, Bruce Springsteen and an appearance by Nelson Mandela. As it turned out, the event had to be terminated because of the potential threat presented by projectile marshmal­lows. 
As one stadium official stated, "Those AIDS victims will just have to hold their horses. We've got a football stadium to run here." 
In the business world, numerous corpo­rations went on a glorified shopping spree this past week, with Comcast attempting to purchase Disney for $54 billion and Cingular buying AT&T Wireless for around $41 billion. This international spending craze even prompted President Bush to alter his 2004 budget plans when he put in an offer to buy Texas for a reported "eleventy gajillion dollars." 
This past Friday. in celebration of a "Day of Purity" before Valentine's Day, high school students across the nation donned white T-shirts in support of absti­nence. When asked what he would be doing instead on the traditional holiday of lovers, the event's organizer promptly looked up from his game of Dungeons and Dragons and replied, "Well. the Sci-Fi Channel's 'Twilight Zone' marathon should take up the majority of my day, but if I have time, I might have an online e­date with my cyber-girlfriend, Amidala3266. It's our three gigaweek anniversary." 
In San Francisco, hundreds of gay cou­ples rushed to get married after Mayor Gavin Newsom began issuing marriage licenses to homosexual partners. Surprisingly, though. many conservative homophobes actually viewed this unprecedented example of gay rights as a positive. As one Republican senator put it. "These couples don't know what they're getting themselves into by throwing away perfect, commitment-free relationships in exchange for decades of cat-fights over who forgot to tape 'Sex and the City' and why someone had to spend $200 on a pair of leather pants from the Gap." Some pun­dits actually predict legal marriage to be the downfall of homosexuality in America. 
After the tremendous success of "The Return of the King" at the U.K. Oscars and with the American Academy Awards quickly approaching, one question about this year's ceremony still looms in the minds of entertainment gurus every­where: Will Billy Crystal show any boob? 
Finally, in North Korea, the govern­ment-controlled media was out in force on Monday in celebration of the 62nd birth­day of supreme ruler Kim Jong II. According to CNN. North Korean publica­tions described their great leader as "a renaissance man who has !lown fighter aircraft. written operas and shot eleven h"oles-in-one in his first try at golf." While these feats are clearly exaggerated propa· ganda distributed by the corrupt North Korean media, most could not disprove the powerful leader when he added, "And you know those Cialis commercials warn· ing against four-hour periods of arousal? I can do that without a pill!" 
So that's the news for this week. It may have been pointless, but at least it beats watching WNDU-16.

lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Voters acted out of frustration for system 
Was it really the students making a mock­nry of student government last week during the elections, or was it the student govern­ment mocking the student? 1\vo particular­ly scathing letters were printed in the Viewpoint section of The Observer on Tuesday claiming that the Istvan-Bell ticket won only because the student body was too apathetic and immature to choose the "real" candidates. As a member of this maligned group, I wish to defend our action as that of frustration rather than tomfool­cry. For four years I have watched students campaign for president. Some were serious, while others were not. Some were student government insiders, while others were new. None of this has ever mattered. Not a single person has done anything. 
Kate Distler berates a fellow student who discounts a candidate's platform and past student government participation as valid issues for choosing a student body presi­dent. I, on the other hand, commend that student. lie or she is exactly right. lf the student government has proven to be com­pletely ineffective over the last four years, why on earth would past participation in that organization be an important attrib­ute? 
Maybe it's the bleeding-heart liberal in me, but I vote for the candidate whom I feel is in greater need of a resume boost. As pointed out so many times, poor Adam has­n't had a chance to participate in student government yet. I think he should get a turn; let him polish up the ol' resume. It docsn 't really matter who holds the office anyway; same results. 
I want it to be understood that I do not mean to belittle those of you participating in student government. I would imagine that 99 percent of you joined thinking that you were goiqg to make a difference. However, if you still feel this way as a grad­uating senior, then you will be leaving Notre Dame just as naive and with less of an excuse. My criticism is for two, more culpable groups: the administration and the whining lackeys who are complaining about this year's election results. For the adminis­tration, I don't expect you to care or change. Last year the faculty senate dis­solved itself out of sheer frustration created by the unresponsiveness from the fourth floor of the Dome. Why should students expect any better treatment? 
As for the people who want to reprimand the student body for going against the grain and choosing a candidate based on some­thing other than the status quo, I give you a sarcastic thumbs-up! To compare last week's election to the upcoming presiden­tial election only solidifies my belief that your self-importance has swelled to a debil­itating high. The presidential election affects judicial nominations, domestic tax policy and international trade. What is this year's student body president going to do this year that his predecessors could not?

Campaign attacks not personal 
Though not mentioned, I believe I played a role in Friday's article, "Election campaign marred by personal attacks." I was motivated to attend Wednesday's debate because residents in my dorm com­plained to me about the rude campaigning of Mr. Ebcrsol. While campaigning. he woke up residents, interrupted studying and talked while they watched movies. I wondered what type of person would do this and thus did my own research. 
This led me to attend the debate, where I asked him two questions directly. The first: "Why was so much money lost on David Spade?" His response was, "That's a good question because I didn't." lie then lied to my face and said that it was The Observer's fault for misinter­preting the facts and that the David Spade fiasco lost no money. 
My second question~ Why was there false information on his flyers in Pasquerilla Center which claimed that the Presidential Pass In Review should be moved to South Quad because 15 percent of stu­dents are in ROTC? He again denied responsibility and said, "You need to go talk to the administration because I got the numbers from them." I pointed out to Mr. Ebersol that if he knew the student body well, he would have realized that nowhere near 15 percent is in ROTC, as the actual figure is about four percent. 
Later one of my (reworded questions) was read via index card ask­ing how Mr. Ebersol related to common students. After his response I yelled out, "Hey Charlie, What's FAFSA?" He responded, "What?" I informed him, "Free Application for Federal Student Aid," to which he responded, "What the hell are you talking about?" I finished with, "Charlie, you proved my point. Thanks." I then gave him the middle finger and left, which would be my "personal attack." 
I never phoned him, touched his Hummer or e-mailed him. I just want to make the point that maybe if he took responsibility for his mistakes, was a polite campaigner and was in touch with common students, he wouldn't be personally disliked. Thank you for allowing me to explain my "role" in ~he "personal attacks."

DVD REVIEW 

Season Three of 1South Park' delivers 

By MOLLY GRIFFIN Scene DVD Critic 
To watch South Park is to enter into a twisted, profanity-laced universe made of construction paper where strange things happen on a daily basis. 
The show follows the wacky misad­ventures of four third-graders -Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny, in South Park. Colo. -and has become something of a cultural phenomenon. Since its debut in 1997, South Park has been a bane to parents, a subject of protest and an issue constantly debated on nightly news shows for corrupting the youth of the nation. It has also cre­ated major ratings for Comedy Central, a merchandising empire and a theatri­cally released movie. So, like most con­troversial shows, it inspires both love and hate with few viewers remaining neutral. The show is offensive and at times borders on sacrilegious, but it is also a funny and biting critique of topi­cal issues and of society itself. 
Season Three of South Park proved that the show had enough creative force and popularity to survive the sec-ond season that normally kills fad shows. Some of the episodes seem a bit dated (Bill Clinton and Pokemon are subjects) because the show deals pri­marily with poking fun at current events, but the humor survives in spite of the lapse in time. Most of the shows just imitate the voices of celebrities (as is stated in the disclaimer before each show). but through its growing popu­larity, it sometimes manages to attract celebrity guest stars. Season Three includes guest voices such as Jennifer Aniston as a high-strung children's choir leader ("Rainforest, Shmainforest") and the band Korn as themselves ("Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery"). 


The episodes in Season Three deal with a variety of different issues, rang­ing from Christmas to sexual harass­ment to spontaneous human combus­tion. 
Aside from the actual episodes, the DVD set doesn't include a lot of extras, but it has enough to make the discs watchable and attractive to fans. The interactive menus are easy to use, there is a "play all" feature, and there is access to individual scenes and the menus are easy to use. The set inciudes 17 episodes on three discs, and each episode has a brief commentary by creators/writers/voice artists Matt Parker and Trey Stone. The com­mentaries run through the first few minutes of each episode, and this provides a kind of intro­duction and background to each show. This 

approach to commenting works, because the viewer gets the creator's views on the show without having to deal with long pauses or not being able to hear most of the episode. The com­mentary is also available for every episode, which is rare on most DVD sets for television shows. Parker and Stone's comments are humorous and avoid being too serious or pretentious, which seems fitting for a show as satir­ical as South Park. Watching the episodes commercial-free is nice, but y.ou do come to realize that almost a full eight minutes of broadcast South Park episodes are commercials. 
The picture quality is good, and the colors of the animation remain appro­priately bright and clear for an animat­ed cartoon. The shows are in Dolby Digital sound, and they can be watched in English, Spanish and French. The special features are not extravagant, but they get the job done and there are few problems to be had while watching the DVDs. 
Season Three of South Park proves to be a very funny and interesting season, and it is presented in a manner that is simple to use and easy to watch. If you're not a fan of the show, this won't win you over, but those who love it will appreciate this set as a fitting package for a unique show.

MOVIE REVIEW 

Cruise fails to convince in epic 
ByJACK WATKINS 
Scene Movie Critic 
It's hard to appreciate a good epic ­like Return of the King or Master and Commander-with no corresponding­ly bad epic to compare it to. Fortunately Tom Cruise and director Edward Zwick have contrived to solve this problem by providing us with The Last Samurai. 

Cruise is Nathan Algren, a Civil War veteran who went on to serve with General George Custer in wiping out Native American tribes. He is hired by the Emperor of Japan to train his sol­diers in modern warfare so they can defeat a traditionalist uprising. Cruise is captured in a battle and meets the leader of the rebels, the noble Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Inevitably, Cruise becomes enchanted with the samurai culture and agrees to help Watanabe in his rebellion against the Emperor, a fight that can only end in a glorious, death-defying, hopefully Oscar-winning charge. 

If this all seems a little paint-by­numbers, that's because it is. Katsumoto is little more than the stereotype of a noble samurai, the plot is just another riff on the theme of evil, encroaching modernity, and Cruise is the man of 20th-century PC values trapped inexplicably in the 19th centu­ry. 
Cruise, in fact, is miscast. Simply put, he lacks the 
warriors in their fight against the Emperor. At some point, one thinks, "You know, this movie won't be that bad, as long as the ending isn't some absurd, anti-climactic betrayal of the themes of the story." Sigh. Without giv­ing too much away, it's safe to say that such an optimistic thought is misguid­ed. The ending to this film left this reviewer trembling with rage.

DVD REVIEW 
'Pirates' DVD a bloody good time 
By MARK BEMENDERFER 
Scene DVD Critic 
Pirates have always gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to the silver screen. Beyond such classics as Peter Pan, the spin-off /look and Treasure Island, pirates never really made their way into many decent movies. 
Sure. there was Cutthroat Island, and The Goonies, but these only total five that easily come to mind. Oh yeah, and one more -the truly excellent 
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the JJlack Pearl. produced by Jerry B ruckheirner. 
Pirates is the latest foray into the realm of pirates, and by now most people have already seen the movie or at least heard of it. If you happen to liave either been living in outer space, under a rock or in Carroll Hall, drop this article now and find a copy of the movie. Buy, borrow, rent or plunder a copy somehow, but find one and watch

But not because of the plot or the well-scripted action. In fact, the plot itself is kind of average, as is the action. No, the real reason to see the movie is Johnny Depp and the charac­ter he plays, Captain Jack Sparrow. 
The former Tim Burton staple goes well beyond anything he has done before to create a completely unique, interesting character. Depp, known for his quirky characters, has created a character in this movie that will prob­ably become his most recognizable. He has done a number of movies over the years as any search on the Internet will reveal, but it wasn't until fairly recently that he became a blockbuster star. That's not to say that he hasn't been in some quality movies, it's just that Pirates was probably the most mainstream he has been in for some time, if ever. Also look for his name to be mentioned in the upcoming Osears for his role in Pirates. 
Beyond Captain Jack Sparrow. the DVD in which you'll find the movie is of the utmost quality. Packaged as one of Disney's collector's sets, the video and sound are of supe­rior quality. The black 

which can give some DVD players a hard time, such as the first generation X-Box's. 
The movie comes with a second DVD with a reported ten hours plus of viewing material. The ten hours con­sists of various commentaries, behind­the-scene explanations, deleted scenes and a blooper reel -basically all the things you would expect from a Disney Collector's Edition DVD. One of the commentaries features Captain Sparrow himself, so fans of Depp may want to check it out to hear his insights. Fans of the theme park ride in Disneyland are also in for a treat. as there is a "Disneyland Pirates Virtual Reality Viewer," as well as a featurette called "Dead Men Tell No Tales," which provides a history of the Disneyland attraction. 

Pirates is one of those rare movies that appeal to almost everyone, and therefore almost everyone has seen it. If you're one of the unlucky few who haven't, it's time you did.

NBA 
Anthony, Nuggets record third straight win 
Associated Press 
DENVER -Carmelo Anthony scored nine of his 28 points in a pivotal third quarter, and the Denver Nuggets posted their third straight win, 106-85 over the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday night. 
Nene added 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Nuggets, who outscored the 76ers 49-31 in the second half. 
Allen Iverson, who missed Monday's practice and was held out of the starting lineup by interim head coach Chris Ford, led the 76ers with 27 points and a season-high 14 assists. 
Iverson, the NBA's leading scorer, entered the game with 
4:39 left in the first quarter and played 36 minutes overall. 
Kenny Thomas had 17 points and 16 rebounds for Philadelphia, which had 21 turnovers. 
Denver, which led 57-54 at halftime, jumped out to a dou­ble-digit lead early in the third quarter. 
Anthony scored nine of Denver's first 17 points in the quarter, capped by a fastbreak slam dunk, as the Nuggets took a 7 4-63 lead midway through the period. 
Anthony's back-to-hack rebound baskets in the fourth quarter gave Denver a 91-74 lead, and Philadelphia got no closer than 13 points after that. 
Nene and Voshon Lenard each had eight points in the first -quarter and Denver outshot Philadelphia 65 percent to 38 percent en route to a 32-19 lead. 
Lenard's 30-footjumper barely beat the shot clock and put the Nuggets up 22-10. Anthony's two free throws gave the Nuggets their biggest lead of the quarter, 27-12. 
In a second quarter filled with flurries, the 76ers started the period with a 17-4 run, including seven points by Iverson, to pro­duce a 36-all tie with 7:06 left in the period. Eric Snow's three­point play gave the 76ers their first lead of the game, 43-42. 
Denver countered with a 15-2 surge, mostly on layups and slam dunks, and Anthony's dunk on a pass from Marcus Camby made it 57-45. 
But Philadelphia scored the last nine points of the quarter, including Iverson's three-point play, to cut the halftime deficit to 57-54. 
Philadelphia shot 71 percent and scored 35 points in the quarter. Chicago 75, Toronto 73 
Jamal Crawford had 25 points, 11 rebounds and five assists, and Eddy Curry added 15 points to lead the Chicago Bulls past the Toronto Raptors Tuesday night. 
Vince Carter had 21 points, and Donyell Marshall -involved in the blockbuster trade between the two teams on Dec. 1 -had 10 points and a career-high 24 rebounds for Toronto. However, the Raptors couldn't overcome a 20-point second half deficit. 
Vancouver 109, Dallas 92 
James Posey had 19 points, Stromile Swift added 18 and the Memphis Grizzlies continued their dominance at home with a victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Thesday night. 

Memphis won its 20th home game -and six of its last seven -to tie the franchise record for home victories set last season. The Grizzlies moved nine games over .500 for the first time in franchise history and gave Hubie Brown his 400th win as an NBA coach. 
Memphis opened the fourth quarter with a 9-2 run and extended its lead to 99-80 with six minutes left when Posey tipped in his own miss. 
Pau Gasol scored 17, while· reserve Earl Watson added 12, and Shane Battier and Jason Williams each had 11 for Memphis.

Source says Maddux will sign with the Cubs 

Associated Press 
While the New York Yankees were welcoming newcqmer Alex Rodriguez, the Chicago Cubs were busy Tuesday luring back a familiar face -Greg Maddux. 
Maddux and the Cubs agreed to a $24 million, three-year deal, a source close to the nego­tiations told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
The Cubs can void the final year of the deal if Maddux does­n't pitch a preset number of innings in 2005. The deal for the free agent is pending a physical, but he was expected to report to spring training Wednesday in Mesa, Ariz. 
The four-time Cy Young win­ner returns to the team with which he made his major league debut in 1986. Now 37, Maddux will join an impressive rotation that includes Kerry Wood, Mark Prior, Matt Clement and Carlos Zambrano -a group that nearly pitched the Cubs into the World Series last October. 
Maddux was 16-11 with a 
3.96 EHA last season for Atlanta. He's posted at least 15 wins for 16 straight years, and is only 11 victories shy of 300. 
Meanwhile, the New York Mets made light of the Yankees' big move and the Boston Red Sox tried to pooh-pooh it. Still, it was hard to avoid the shock wave the Yankees sent through baseball by getting Rodriguez. 
"A-Rod goes to the Yankees and you sit there and look at that lineup top to bottom," Chicago White Sox closer Billy Koch said. "The best way to deal with that lineup is to be a Yankee pitcher. So you better ask Mr. Steinbrenner to trade for you." 
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner stayed in Tampa, Fla., as pitchers and catchers reported to camp. But manager Joe Torre and captain Derek Jeter were at Yankee Stadium, where Rodriguez put on the pinstripes for the first time. 
The Yankees finalized their trade with Texas this week, and commissioner Bud Selig approved the restructuring of Hodriguez's contract. 
"We haven't won anything yet," Steinbrenner said. "It will be a big spring. It will deter­mine a lot of things down here." 
"Every year, everybody gets better. Boston is probably the favorite," he said. 
Some early arrivals at the Red Sox camp in Fort Myers, Fla., played down the Yankees' acquisition. 
"You didn't want to sec A-Hod go to the Yankees, but just because he's there, we're not scared," catcher Doug Mirabelli said. 
Boston came close to getting the AL MVP earlier in the off­season before its proposed deal for Rodriguez fell through. 
The Yankees' move shows they "are worried about us in a way," Red Sox pitcher Alan Embree said. "They know we have a very good ballclub this year and it's exciting." 
Added Mirabelli: "Having a lot of guys over there that are All­Stars, that's going to be tough. They can't deny that. There's going to be some egos over there." 
The Mcts made their own move Tuesday, signing former Yankees left-bander Handy Keisler to a minor leagun con­tract. 
The Mets announced the Keisler move in an e-mail head­lined, "Alex Who?" 
At St. Petersburg, Fla.. Tampa Bay manager Lou Piniella was caught up in discussing Rodriguez, a former player of his in Seattle. 
"The biggest adjustment will be moving from shortstop to third base. lie's been playing shortstop since he was a teenager," Piniella said. 
"Alex likes the limelight, so New York wont faze him. New York has brought in a lot of new people, like our situation. There arc, obviously, a lot more expec­tations out there." 
The Devil Hays will not have outfielder Josh Hamilton for a while. The 22-year-old prospect was suspended until March 19 and fined for violating baseball's drug policy. 
Hamilton was the No. 1 pick in the 1999 amateur draft but has yet to play a full season in the minor leagues. lie's been hurt and also been beset by unspecified personal reasons, which kept him out all of last season. 
The Devil Hays have repeated­ly declined to discuss his situa­tion. 
"The organization is not in a position to make any further statements concerning this issue," a spokesman said. 
MEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL 
Stanford and St. Joseph's still working on perfect seasons 
Associated Press 
Stanford and Saint Joseph's have little in common, but there is this: They arc the only unbeat­en schools lef't in Division I. 
It's been 25 years since two men's basketball teams entered the postseason without a loss, and the No. 1 Cardinal and No. 2 Hawks could be headed that way. 
Now the real pressure sets in. 
"We're going to be really zeroed in on how we're approaching the game and how WI~ play the game. We have to anticipate the atmosphere will bP over the top, but we've dealt with that," Saint Joseph's coach Phil Martelli said. 
"Extra attention comes with our record, and we'll accept it and deal with it." 
The schools from opposite coasts take different approaches as they try to quiet skeptics and make history. 
Stanford (21-0) boasts a bal­anced offense featuring five dou­ble-figure scorers, is led by a physical frontline that outre­bounds opponents by almost eight a game, and makes 74 per­cent of il'i free throws. 
Saint Joseph's (22-0) gets nearly half of its points from its stellar backcourt, is outmuscled by more than three rebounds a game, and makes 71 percent of its free throws. 
OK, so there are similarities. And here's what they have most in common: just a handful 
of regular-season games left against conference opponents. Both play in leagues that are mediocre this season (Stanford in the Pac-10, Saint Joseph's in the Atlantic 1 0). 
UNLV was the last team to enter the NCAA tournament without a loss, in 1990-91, when the Hunnin' Hebels were upset by Duke in the Final Four. The last time two schools were unbeaten heading into the post­season was 1978-79, when Larry Bird's Indiana State and Alcorn State did it. 
No one has gone all the way to an NCAA title without a loss since Bob Knight coached Indiana to a 32-0 mark and the 1976 championship. 
Saint Joseph's and Stanford were expected to do well this season -but not this well. The Hawks were ranked 17th and Stanford 19th in The Associated Press preseason Top 25. 
Asked about his team's rise to No. 1 in Monday's poll, Stanford coach Mike Montgomery could have been speaking about his team or Martelli's when he said: "It's kind of extraordinary from where we started the season." 
Pour of Stanford's last six reg­ular-season games are on the road, beginning Thursday at Southern California. Then the Cardinal have the Pac-1 0 tour­nament in Los Angeles. 
Saint Joseph's has five games left, with three on the road, including at Fordham on Wednesday. Their league tour­nament will be at Dayton, one of the toughest places for visiting teams. 
"The thing we talked to the team about is we play five teams we've beaten by double digits, so the onus is on us," Martelli said. "We realize the circus around us will be bigger, but to me it's still about playing a basketball game." 
Stanford owns four victories against ranked opponents (Arizona twice, Kansas and Gonzaga). and not everything has come easily. Nine of the Cardinal's victories have been by 10 points or fewer. 
Childress leads the Cardinal in scoring average at 12.9 points. He missed nine games early in the season with a foot injury, and three other starters have missed games with various ail­ments. Forward Justin Davis might rejoin the team at the end of the month. 
The llawks rely a lot on Player of the Year candidate Jameer Nelson, who averages 20.2 points. Fellow guard Delonte West averages 19. Both shoot better than 50 percent from the field, including about 40 percent from 3-point range, and they split 223 assists almost down the middle. 
Nelson, from Chester, just out­side Philadelphia, returned for his senior season after consider­ing a jump to the NBA. It worked out well for a player who was on the cover of Sports Illustrated last week.

Syracuse suffering ~from inconsistency 
Associated Press 
SYRACUSE, N.Y. -Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim's postgame press conference Monday night was the shortest of the season. The frustration was all too evi­dent after the Orangemen had lost again at home. 
"We didn't play well offensively despite coming off our best offen­sive game all year," Boeheim said after Notre Dame's first victory in the Carrier Dome in seven years. "We have to play a lot better offensively than we did tonight. We're just not going to stop peo­ple all the time." 
Syracuse is 16-6 overall and 6­5 in the Big East with five games left before the Big East tourna­ment begins March 10. The Orangemen play Georgetown, No. 5 Pittsburgh and West Virginia on the road and at the Carrier Dome have VIllanova and No. 8 Connecticut, in the season fmale. 
Which means that if the defending national champions win the three games they should win and don't pull off at least one upset, they won't fmish the regu­lar season with 20 wins and could be in jeopardy of not mak­ing the NCAA tournament if they tank in the conference tourna­ment at Madison Square Garden. On Saturday, making the post­-season again had looked like a given. Syracuse shot a season­high 64.4 percent from the field _ in defeating the Miami -Hurricanes 91-74 on the road. However, the team that lost four times in the last month, including an embarrassing 66-45 defeat at home to Pitt, resurfaced against 
did last year." 
"We have to turn it around," Warrick said. "Hopefully, we can make a run and end the season off with some strong wins." 
Notre Dame won by hitting 11­of-23 3-pointers and allowing Gerry McNamara and Warrick to get their points. McNamara fin­ished with 20, but no other team­mate finished in double figures and the Orangemen's high-scor­ing duo, who played every minute of the game, were a com­bined 16-for-43. 
That's 37.2 percent shooting. Not a recipe for success. 
"We can absorb those guys," Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said. "No one else hurt us. McNamara and Warrick did, but nobody else went off." 
And that's one of the biggest problems. 
Starting center Craig Forth was an impressive 16-for-23 for 33 points in the previous three games to become a force in the middle. He took one shot in 21 minutes against the Irish and missed it. 
Swingman Josh Pace was 12­for-21 for 25 points in victories last week over Rutgers and Miami. Against the Irish, he scored four points in 35 minutes. 
Perhaps the most important factor is the absence of point guard Billy Edelin. He's missed five of the last six games for per­sonal reasons and remains out indefinitely. His ability to pene­trate and either score or set up somebody for an open look ­he's averaging 13.8 points and 
5.2 assists -is sorely missed, 
especially by McNamara. McNamara has struggled since 

MLB 
Trainer admits to giving steroids 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -Barry Bonds' personal trainer told federal agents he gave steroids to several baseball players, according to documents released Tuesday. 
No players were identified in the documents and it was unclear whether the trainer, Greg Anderson, gave specific names to the federal agents. 
Anderson was one of four men charged last week in a steroid-distribution ring that allegedly supplied athletes with banned substances. 
All four pleaded innocent. No athletes have been charged. 
Federal officials released two affidavits Tuesday that support­ed search warrants used in raids on Anderson's home in September. 
"Inside Anderson's residence, agents found steroids, syringes and other paraphernalia asso­ciated with steroid distribution activities," the documents said. "In addition, agents found files identifying specific athletes. These files contained calen­dars, which appear to contain references to daily doses of steroids and growth hor­mones." 
The indictment announced last week said federal agents found about $63,920 in cash in a locked safe at Anderson's res­idence during the first raid. 
"Some of the money was bro­ken up into separate envelopes with the first names of known athlete clients written on them," the documents released Tuesday say. 
The ne.w documents say Anderson initially denied dis­tributing steroids in discussions with federal agents but later

Syracuse shot just 38 percent and was beaten 84-72 by a Notre Dame team it had defeated 10 times in 11 games.

Senior Galvin earns weekly honor 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame senior defense­man Tom Galvin has been hon­ored by the CCHA as the con­ference's defensive Player of the Week for the week ending Feb. 15. 
Galvin was instrumental in Notre Dame's weekend sweep of Ferris State (4-2, 4-1) at both ends of the ice ~s he scored once and added three assists for a four-point week­end and was +3 overall. The veteran blueliner was also on the ice for six of Notre Dame's eight goals on the weekend and was on for just one Ferris State goal. He also was a key contributor on the Notre Dame penalty-killing unit that killed nine Bulldog power-play chances on the weekend. 
In Friday night's 4-2 win, the 5-foot-1 0, 190-pound defense­man was + 1 on the night and set up the first Notre Dame goal of the night when his shot from the right point was deflected by Matt Amado past Ferris State's All-American goaltender Mike Brown at 2:53 of the first period. 
The penalty-killing unit killed all four Bulldog power plays on the night. 
Galvin recorded the first 
three-point game of his career Saturday night with a goal and two assists and was +2 as the Irish took a 4-1 decision ver­sus the Bulldogs. He got the Irish offense going again when he scored at 2:53 of the first period. 
He beat Brown when he walked in from the right point, went to his backhand and flipped the puck inside the left post and Brown's blocker for his first goal of the year. 
Galvin went on to help set up a pair of Neil Kornadoski power play goals for his two assists on the way to the 4-1 win. 
MEN'S SOCCER 
Dalby named freshman All-American 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame men's soccer team continues to rake in post­season honors for 2003-04. Freshman Greg Dalby was named to the Soccer America Freshman All-America team earlier this month -joining teammates Justin Detter and Chris Sawyer in earning All­America accolades. 
Dalby was both a central mid­fielder and central defender for the Irish in his rookie season last fall, helping the Notre Dame defense establish itself among the best units in the nation. Dalby started each of Notre Dame's 23 matches last season and played close to every minute of every contest. 
The Notre Dame defense held its opponents to just 16 goals in 23 matches last season -and eight of those goals came in two games. Take that into consider­ation and the Irish defense held their opponents to one or zero goals in 21 of 23 matches dur­ing the 2003 season. 
In other Irish men's soccer news, sonior Kevin Richards earned his first international playing experience for the Bermuda National Team on Feb. 11, when Bermuda faced Trinidad and Tobago. Richards, a native of Warwick, Bermuda, started two matches for his home country on Feb. 11 and 13 against the Trinidadians. Bermuda lost the first match 1­0, then carne back to earn a 2-2 tie.

Walsh scored 20 goals and notched 32 assists. This sum­mer, Walsh also helped the United States win the under-19 men's lacrosse World Championship, scoring 13 goals and eight assists in six games.

The maturity and experience of this year's team has been evident in the exhibition games. The Irish arc careful to take the exhibition games for what they arc worth, using them as practice for the sea­son. 
"Each time we play, no mat­ter who it is or what type of game, we arc just concerned with getting better each time we step on the field," Walsh said.

THE PRESIDENT EMERITUS

THE PRESIDENT EMERITUS 
"We believe in equal rights for human beings, not because oftheir color, nationality or their sex, but because they're human beings.·· 

S T 0 R Y BY SHEILA FLYNN 
I
n 1934, when a first-year student fresh out of Syracuse, N.Y. stepped onto Notre Dame's campus, he wasn't looking ahead to the day when he would become University President. He wasn't look­ing ahead to the time when he would travel the globe, visiting everywhere from China to the South Pole. He wasn't looking ahead to the ceremonies in which he would be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal or the Medal of Freedom. Theodore Hesburgh was simply looking around him. And a conspicuous absence in the University 
eommunity became glaringly obvious. 
"I asked one of the administrators why we didn't have any black students," I lesburgh said. "He said, 'All thP white ones ... so many of' them are from the South, they'd all leave."' 
Thoro wmm't a single black on campus --not in the student body, not in the faculty, not in the Main Building, not even working on the grounds, llesburgh said. 
"It was a totally white society," he said. 
But l H years later, when llesburgh had returnod to Notro Dame as the rector of Farley Hall, that homogeneity was beginning to change --albeit slowly. And th(~ administrator's prophesy was quick­ly proven wrong. 
"I had only one problem," llesbw·gh said. "I was just taking over Farley llall a.; rector, and I got a call . . . tlw first day before school began from a lady in New Orleans with a French mune." 
The woman, whose white son lived in Farley, told llesburgh she had heard that a black student was also msiding in the dormitory. llesburgh confirmed that infill'mation. 
"She said, 'Wnll, if he's still thore tomorrow morn­ing, you send my son home,"' I Iesburgh said. 
"I said, 'We'll miss him."' 
Tho white student left, and the issue was resolved. Ten years later, llesburgh met that student --who had bPeome a doctor after attending Tulane --who said hio; mother's decision was tho "dumbest" thing shn had ever donn. 
Very few p(mple, however, made such a "dumb" mistake, llesburgh said, regarding issues of civil rights at the University. 
'"1'111~ stud(mto; wore on the side of the angels, as lhr as civil righto;," llesburgh said. 
They had a strong and influential role model in llesburgh. lie served as chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Highto; during Lyndon B. Johnson's prnsidoncy and played an integral role in passing proJ.,rressive Pqual righto; legislation. 
At the time, llesburgh said, Notre Dame was a "pretty lively place," with bonfires, rallies and huge support of soda! ch<mge across the faculty and stu­dent<;. 
"I got ofl" all right because they knew I wa'> the · civil righto; commissioner --that I was pressing for all the things that muld be done," Hosburgh said. 
And despite his very vocal and prominent position on civil right'> issues, Hesburgh said he never really faced opposition from more conservative factions, whether they be alumni, parent<; or students, them­selves. 
'Tm sure there may have been some, but they didn't come to me beeause they knew it wouldn't have done mueh good," Ilesburgh said. 
He stood firm on the issue of coeducation, as well, handling it in much the same way. Just as there were no black student'> on campus when I-Iesburgh first arrived, there were no females --at least dur­ing the academic year. 
"They used to loosen up a little bit in the summer­time and let nuns come in and do a little summer school," Hesburgh said. 
To him, though, that was simply not good enough. When he a<;sumed tlm presidency, he decided to do something about it, first attempting a merger with Saint Mary's College, and when that didn't work, opening Notre Dame up to women. He ignored OQjections and pushed ahead. 
"The place was so macho, a lot of people thought it was going to pot," Hesburgh said. 
The transition proceeded fairly smoothly, howev­er, and 1-Iesburgh said any opposing sentiment J.,Tfadually eroded. 
"Some had their sons turned down and their daughters accepted, so that took care of that prob­lem in a hurry," Hesburgh said. 
The male chauvinism that had long pervaded the University la<;ted a f~~w more years, Hesburgh said, but that, too, soon deteriorated. · 
"There were so few women that the women that survived those first four or five years, until they got more numbers here, were able to survive at any male chauvinistic place in the world," Hesburgh said. "They were used to it being one woman and 35 guys." 
And now the almost equal representation on cam­pus, I-lesburgh said, i'> one of the most significant changes in the University community. 
"Now, I think that everybody just takes it for granted," he said of the co-educational environ­ment. 
I Ie also said that, if males even tried to express a discriminatory attitude at this point in time at the

University, they would be far from successful. "I don't think they'd get away with it," I Iosburgh said. "You girls would stand up and cuff them." 
Despite such momentous strides, however, Hesburgh said there is still more that can be done to further gender equality at Notre Dame. I Ie said bat­tles continue to be fought, and progress is an ever­evolving phenomenon at tlm University. 
"I pushed behind the scenes as hard as I could until we had a woman student body president," Hesburgh said. "I think we're where we ought to bo, but that doesn't moan ~e can't get bettnr. 
"In a way, women could have more influence around here tlmn they do." 
That same opinion, he said, applies to minority students. He said the challenge is to now elect both black and Hispanic student body presidnnl'i. 
"You only have to win that battle once," llesburgh said. 
Other, more subtle, challenges, however, eontinue to face the Notre Dame community on a daily basio;, he said. While minority percentages have increa'>nd and the face of the student body is changing, I Iesburgh said the new test will be to institute actual and full integration. All etlmic groups and minorities must mingle and interact, bolstering truo diversity through a visible commitment to equality. 
"I think there ought to be more intercultural rela­tionships here," Hesburgh said, citing the benelito; of cross-cultural learning gained from sharing a room with a person from a different culture, race or coun­try. 
"Coming to Notre Dame ought to teach everybody that they're living in a very mixed-up world, and that we have to know how to live in such a world to live peacefully," he said. "It'd be wonderful if people could leave here with friends from other cultures and other religions and other nationalities." 
The Catholic religion, however, should be the foundation for thi'> entire integration and equality, Hesburgh said 
"We believe in equal righls for human beings, not because of their eolor, nationality or their sex, but because they're human beings," llesburgh said. "And on that bao;is, I think we're bound to come out on the right side of these questions. And I think we do." 
THE FIRST MINORITY FOOTBALL MONOGRAM WINNER 
""Those other teams realized that ifthey wanted to win, you had to take whoever was going to be the best for you. And I take real pride in being a part ofthat.,, 

STORY BY ANDREW SOUKUP 

ayne Edmonds doesn't have much trouble remembering his first football practice in an Irish uniform, even though that day was more than a half-century ago. 
Edmonds, who is black, was lined up at defensive end on a play when the team's quar­
terback, Ralph Guglielmi, tried to sprint away from a ferocious pass rush. But Edmonds chased down Guglielmi and delivered a punishing hit to the white quarterback. 
"Everything," said Edmonds, "got real quiet." 
The next play, three blockers flattened Edmonds. But Frank Leahy, then the Irish coach, chewed out his team. In that moment, Edmonds knew that if he never set foot on the playing field in a game, it wouldn't be because he was black. 
"I felt protected. I knew the rules," he said. "I knew that as long as I did my job right, I was going to be taken care of." 
Edmonds must have done his job well enough. In 1953, he helped Notre Dame win a national title and became the first black football player to earn a monogram at Notre Dame. 
But that didn't mean that he didn't endure his fair share of abuse both at Notre Dame and on the road. 
Edmonds likes to tell the story of a time that he got caught by a priest while he was off-campus. The priest asked Edmonds, "What are you doing out here? You're not allowed out here." The young football player replied, "I went to get a hair­cut. I can't get a haircut at Notre Dame" ­because the on-campus barbershop allowed only whites. 
On the football field, however, Edmonds' team­mates largely supported his play -something Edmonds now attributes to the intense pressure placed upon all the players. "The big thing was that everyone was so put under the telescope, you had to do well for yourself," he said. "With all the pressure on you, you didn't have time for any of that other stufl'." 
While a handful of other blacks had played before Edmonds arrived, none had seen enough playing time to earn a monogram. Even Edmonds' family in western Pennsylvania was wary of send­ing him to South Bend because they believed he would be taken advantage of. But Leahy and the rest of the coaching staff promised Edmonds, the· most talented black player to wear an Irish uni­form to date, that they would look after him. That was enough to convince him to go to Notre Dame. 
"I liked the possibilities of being first," he said. "It was important that ifI did that, and I was suc­cessful at Notre Dame, which was a white institu­tion, it would be important in my life later on." 
The coaches weren't the only ones watching after him. On a flight to an away game, a dozing Edmonds was roused from his slumber by a tug on his arm. Next to him was Father Theodore Hesburgh, wondering how Notre Dame was treat­ing Edmonds. 
"From an administrative point of view, they wanted to make sure things were OK," Edmonds said. "But from a football point of view, they prom­ised that other people couldn't harm me." 
That didn't stop people from trying, though. On away games in Southern states, hostile fans hurled racial epithets at Edmonds. Hotels and restaurants refused to host the Irish as long as Edmonds was a member of the traveling party, and teams routinely threatened not to play the Irish if Notre Dame brought its black players. 
Still Edmonds persevered. Having endured racial slurs and segregation as a high school foot­ball player, he claimed he wasn't bothered by the comments and taunts made by fans. Although many restaurants balked at serving Edmontls and the other black players, white teammates walked side-by-side. with their black teammates to dis­courage discrimination. And when teams threat­ened not to play Notre Dame, Edmonds frequently heard Leahy say, "If they can't play, then we can't play." 
Edmonds rarely returns to his alma mater and hasn't seen a Notre Dame game in more than four years. But that didn't stop him from feeling a strong sense of pride when the Irish hired their first black coach in Tyrone Willingham. 
Today, Edmonds looks out on a college athletics landscape far different from the one he endured as an undergraduate in the 1950s. Now, white and black players challenge for starting position and rarely is race an issue -an attitude Edmonds is thrilled he helped foster through his actions. 
"All these other teams we beat, people said they were supposed to be leaders. But Notre Dame was a real leader," Edmonds said. "Notre Dame just made those little kinds of moves like having blacks on its teams, and they were winning. 
"Finally, those other teams realized that if they wanted to win, you had to take whoever was going to be the best for you. And I take real pride in being a part of that."

I 
STORY BY ANDREW THAGARD t's hard to believe that Josephine Ford's five-acre snow-covered farm is less than two miles from the center of Notre Dame's campus. It's even more astonishing that this petite, gray-haired lady is the person she describes in her stories with a quiet British accent as she warms herself by an old 
fashioned stove in her living room. Then again, Ford wasn't the woman whom her colleagues anticipated when she was hired by then theology department chair Father Albert Schlitzer in 1965 as one of the first women to join Notre 
Dame's teaching faculty. 
The Holy Cross priests who dominated the University's theology department at the time expected an overly assertive woman with short hair wearing a tweed suit, she recalls with a chuckle. 
Trailblazers, it seems, come in different shapes and sizes. 
Ford made University history when she was hired in 1965 and th"en again three years later when she became the first female Notre Dame faculty member to receive tenure. She cap­tured the limelight again in 1978 -this time for suing the University alleging sexual dis­crimination in its promotion practices. 
Ford relates all of this and more with sur­prising calm as only someone who is accus­tomed to adventure can. 
The woman who says she's been too busy to marry and "settle down" spent the first part of her life in England, training first to be a nurse and later a theologian. The idea of a woman teaching college level theology was unheard of in England during those years, according to Ford, so she moved to Africa to teach. 
When the school where Ford taught experi­enced financial trouble, she began to look for a new job. Both a British bishop and a profes­sor at Oxford University whom she knew wrote to Notre Dame on her behalf. 
Although most of her colleagues in the theol­ogy department were supportive, a few ques­tioned her ability in a field dominated by priests. 
"Some of the men said, 'You're a woman, you can't know theology,' as if somehow biolo­gy played a part," she said. 
Despite such comments, Ford received tenure after three years. She languished, how­ever, in the position of assistant professor while she watched colleagues whom she per­ceived to be less qualified get promoted over her from her position on the University's appointment and promotions committee. 
"I had seen other people's dossiers and I knew that I had more qualifications than many of the priests," she said. 
Meanwhile, Ford banded with other women members of the faculty to discuss issues they faced. The informal group called themselves "Committee W" and it was there that she decided to file a sexual discrimination suit against the University. 
Ford believed then and now that Notre Dame's actions were not intentional and she doesn't recall officials or colleagues treating her badly before or after the lawsuit. 
"I don't remember any anger. There was no acrimonious behavior on either side," she said. "I think it [sexual discrimination] just never crossed their minds." 
The University reached a settlement with Ford and the other plaintiffs out of court on March 16, 1981, agreeing to promote Ford to a full professor and renew Notre Dame's com­mitment to promote and grant tenure to female faculty members at the same rate as their male counterparts. The settlement also established an appeals committee to assess the files of faculty who were denied tenure. 
In a letter distributed to all members of the faculty on Dec. 11, 1981 then-Provost Timothy O'Meara said that the University's deCision to settle was motivated in part by a desire to minimize disruption to academic life that the suit could potentially cause and fear of dis­suading women from applying to faculty posi­tions. 
Ford couldn't have been happier with the decision. She accepted the promotion and remained at Notre Dame until her retirement three years ago after 33 years of teaching. 
"I think the fact that they settled out of court [suggests] that they realized they were wrong."

A WOMAN FROM 1972 
"Being asked for your opinion in a classroom to represent the whole female race ... that struck me as very strange.,

e 

STORY BY CLAIRE HEININGER 
A
s the first females to attend Notre Dame in 1972, Donna Campbell and her peers expected skepticism from their professors and friction from their male classmates. They didn't expect a beauty contest in the dining hall. 
"I'll never forget it -when we were in the cafeteria line, the boys used to have rating systems," Campbell said. "They'd put up cards, 9.0, 10.0, 8.5, as we walked by." 
-
Mealtime appraisals were only one predicament that the women had to adjust to. A more signifi­cant challenge, Campbell said, was the widespread expectation of her male classmates that because 
she spoke as a female, she spoke as every female. 
"Being asked for your opinion in a classroom to represent tho whole female race -as if there's not 20,000 different opinions, just one female opinion -that struck me as very strange," she said. 
Yet it w~L'> this chance to speak up, both for her­sell' and for others, and to contribute to the aca­dmnic discourse at an institution as prominent as Notre Dame that drew Campbell and her identi­cal twin sister Denise to apply in the flrst place. 
Coming from the Chicago area, Campbell aimed for a top-level university in the Midwest. "It's not like today, when you see kids applying all over the country," she said. 
And with a full background of Catholic educa­tion from grade school on up, she added, Notre Dame's Catholicism was another advantage. It seemed like the only college that fit the regional, academic and religious proliJe she aspired to. But thorn was a catch: the decision to admit women had not yet boon finaliznd. 
"At the time we were applying, it was still not sure," she said. A'> soon as it was, though, so was Carnpbnll. 
''I'll never forget the Chicago Tribune front pagn saying 'Notre Dame going eo-ed,"' she said. 
"I thought, 'Ah, this is it! I'm supposed to go here!"' 
Once Campbell arrived, she found herself among a diverse group of women enrolled in var­ious majors and hailing from all over the country. 
"We had lots of Arts and Letters, some archies, a biology, a business," she said of her close friends. However, they all had one thing in com­mon: they were confident that they belonged here just as much as the male students did. 
"We knew that we were all in this together," Campbell said of the bond she felt with the other members of the first female class. "We did face male dominance throughout the university, and stereotyping females did occur." 
She added that while those looking back may focus on the discrimination and barriers that the women were up against, she chooses to remem­ber the time as a revolutionary step for a conser­vative institution. 
"We were very excited to be given the opportu­nity to become part of a great decision," Campbell said. "I always look at the positive side." 
Campbell, who lived in Walsh Hall as a fresh­man and moved to Farley Hall for her fmal three years, added that the women's intellectual contri­butions -"we were such a small group of females, so we were seen as the eggheads" she said -became even more valuable when com­bined with what they brought to the social scene. 
"All of the sudden there were hall parties, there were girls' dorms sponsoring formal dances," she said. She explained that the dynamic of a slightly uptight, entirely male culture began to shift to reflect the atmosphere that existed at other uni­versities across the country. 
"Socially, it became a little more of the norm of what was going on on co-ed campuses else­where," Campbell said. 
She added that while males at Notre Dame already interacted with females in an academic setting by taking classes with Saint Mary's stu­dents, their adjustment to soeial inh~raction was ­harder to make. It was also more of a shock for some than for others. 
"The freshmen boys weren't quite as put off as the upperclassmen," she said. "But they all got used to it. They learned." 
They learned that the sense of belonging was mutual. And they learned that co-education at Notre Dame was an idea worthy of a perfect 10.

AN EARLY HOMOSEXUAL STUDENT 
..They say Notre Dame is a family. If you're my parents, you've got to take care ofme. IfI come to Notre Dame not knowing I'm gay and discover it while I'm there, I don't want to be silenced." 

n 


ae

C 
S T 0 R Y BY CLAIRE HEININGER oming out to his own family was gut-wrenching. Coming out to the Notre Dame family proved to be another challenge entirely. John Michael Yore learned the distinction the hard way when, as an undergraduate strug­gling to place his identity, he realized he was gay and sought out a priest for counseling. Instead of the spiritual guidance he expected to receive, he said he got sexual abuse and a stifling silence. Yore said he also discovered that the University's highly touted "family" didn't live up to its promises. 
"They say Notre Dame is a family," Yore said. "If you're my parents, you've got to take care of me. If I eome to Notre Dame not knowing I'm gay and discover it while I'm there, I don't want to be silenced." 
Yore said his first reports of the abuse, as well as his subsequent efforts to gain acknowl­ndgmnnt of gays on campus, were quieted by an administration that was more concerned with its image than with the values it pledged to promote and the students it promised to rnspoct. 
llowevor, Notre Dame spokesman Matt Storin said that while he could not comment on Yore's case in particular, the University took immediate action in response to all sexual abuse allegations. lie added that he believed all pnople involved in the abuse incidents were of graduate student age. 
Yore focused on the University's attitude towards gay students, saying that it was care­ful not to publicize the existence of a group that might cause controversy among donors. 
"Notre Dame has to play a game with its donors to survive," Yore said. "They're making sure none of the donors feel uncomfortable." 
Yore believes· that this money-for-image exchangn factors highly into the University's reaetion to students in his situation .. 
"They're very conservative because they don't want to offend people who give them money, don't want to interfere with the cash cow," he said. "!Sol they ostracize things that go against the 'Notre Dame family' and the university's Catholic character." 
Gay students do not fit into this ideal charac­ter, and, Yore says, Notre Dame doesn't do much to mask their exclusion. He believes that by catering to the priorities of Catholicism over the priorities of individualism and intellectual curiosity, the University not only hurts students like himself but also betrays its purpose. 
"A Catholic university is a contradiction in terms," Yore said. "There is a conservative Pope and pressure to meet Catholic priorities. But at a university you are taught to think for yourself-to question everything, to question us, to question where you end up." 
Yore's own questioning persisted throughout his undergraduate and graduate time at the 
University, when he consistently tried to bring alternative, liberal and progressive views to campus. Ilis masters' thesis, "Gay Man in Catholic Disneyland," which was pub­lished in 2002 as an introduction to his mem­oir "Tell Me What Ilome Is Like," summarized his feelings about Notre Dame's profit-driven decision making. He compared the University's image-conscious approach to a corporation trying to maintain "a theme park for Catholics." 
In addition to his thesis, Yore was involved with GALA (Gay and Lesbian Alumni/ae of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College), con­tributed consultation to the University's antidiscrimination clause and suggested that a permanent standing committee on gay and les­bian issues be created at Notre Dame. 
Yore insists that these students deserve a committee because "they have unique issues 
The Observer 9 February 18, 2004 
and unique concerns." 
"They are uniquely vulnerable because they are essentially theological minoritiAs. They lie outside the traditional Catholic thinking." 
Although Yore has since stepped outside Notre Dame, publishing "Moving Into History: Lookout Liberals, Psychological Correctness and Victim Cultures" in 2003, he continues to urge others who have been ignored, abused or both to step back into the dialogue. 
He said that for many who have been abused, the pain is so great that they "can't ­even step back on campus," but stressed that "you don't get through it by hiding -.you get through it by creating a network of people to help." 
Such a network .was missing from the University's own stance on the sexual abuse crisis, Yore said. lie said that spokesmen and administrators have focused too much on eon­gratulating Notre Dame's response to the sean­dais without acknowledging that events on its own campus were a contributing force in the first place. 
"It all comes down to how Notre Dame is sold," he said. "It goes back to the Catholic Disneyland concept. Notre Dame has a lot of first-hand experience with the sex abuse scan­dal, but [these reactions] are evidence that the University is still taking care of itself first and foremost-and that's sad." 
A self-serving and exclusive eommunity, Yore reiterated, is not worthy of the "family" title. "If you care too much about image," he said, "you're going to lose what you're all about."

"The way [my presidency] was different was that I had a different vantage point," Norton said. "A lot of things other presidents hadn't gone through, such as living in girls' dorm, provided that dif­ferent vantage point." 
She said Notre Dame's high voter turnout for elections and the support she received rein­forced her position. 
"There is a lot of pressure with student government and presidents get criticized because they choose to take that position," Norton said. "But you primarily but it on yourself because you want to do the best job you can." 
Norton said she received encouragement from Univer­sity President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh, director of public relations Denny Moore and other male admin­istrators to run for the top position and during her term. 
Though Norton found her experience of running for and serving as student body vice president beneficial, she said the experiences were very different. When she ran for student body president, she had experience and was not asked why she was running.

"I tried not to focus on it too much," he said. "I tried to focus on being the 22nd leprechaun, not the first black leprechaun." 
While he heard a good number of light-hearted jokes, Brown said that, in his entire career as lep­rechaun, he never felt any­one stare and never heard one negative comment. 
Despite the positive reception he earned, Brown rejects the concep­tion that he broke any bar­riers by becoming the first black leprechaun at Notre Dame.

"I had a great time, no matter what," he said. "I got to meet so many people as a result, and I got to do so many things I would not have been able to do."

Joyce cuts up St. John's defense 
Senior records career-high 15 points in victory 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sports Writer 
St. John's decided to focus on controlling Notre Dame's leading scorers Mega~ Duffy and Jacqueline Batteast in a triangle-and-two defense Tuesday night, but that was fine with Jeneka Joyce. 
Joyce hit her first four 3­pointers en route to a career­high 15 points for the Irish in their fourth road win of the season, 69-56.

Lauren Connelly volleys against Wisconsin on Feb. 1. The Irish were 3-0 this weekend. 
McGraw said. 

For Notre Dame (16-8, 9-3 in the Big East). it was only its fourth win in 12 attempts. in true road games this season. But it wasn't an easy win by any means. 
St. John's (9-14, 3-9) came out red-hot in the first half, shooting 53.6 percent from the field. 
The Irish's box-and-one was not working as well as they hoped, so they switched to man-to-man in the second half and were able to pull away in the end. 
"Defensively, no question [that made a difference]." McGraw said. "I felt we played our better defenders in the second half a little bit more."

The Irish were seeing purple and orange this weekend. 
Literally. 

When walking into Virginia Tech's Burrows-Burleson Tennis Center Saturday, No. 26 Notre Dame was greeted by the school's purple and orange courts, reminiscent of Dr. Seuss's color schemes. 
Virginia Tech's bold school colors were an initial shock to the Irish as they competed in that location against both Boston College and Virginia Tech. 
"I guess you could call it a home­court advantage," freshman Christian Thompson said. "We got used to it once we started playing, but it was just real­ly hard to adjust to at first." 
Despite having to face such challeng­ing match environments all weekend ­Friday's opponent Virginia Commonwealth's courts were over­heated -the Irish overcame those challenges to register three victories. 
The Irish defeated No. 14 Virginia Commonwealth 4-3, Boston College 6-1 Saturday and No. 69 Virginia Tech 5-2 Sunday.

Seniors pu1nped for annual Big East Ineet 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Writer 

When most people think of track, they don't picture a physical altercation. But most people never asked Juan Alba. 
"It's always a big dog fight in there," Alba said of the Big East indoor track and field Championships. "I just want to take out the guy in front of me." 
While Alba won't actually be beating anyone up this week­end, his words aptly describe the career success of this year's group of seniors. 
The men are the defending conference champs and are primed for a repeat title this weekend in Syracuse, N.Y. behind the efforts of seniors like distance runners Mark Barber and Kevin Somok, triple jumper Godwin Mbagwu and Alba. 
The women's team is ranked No. 17 by Trackwire.com. In addition to senior sprinters Ayesha Boyd and Kristen Dodd, senior pole-vaulter Jill Van Weelden also helps to lead the team. 
Boyd is ecstatic just to be competing in her last season in
