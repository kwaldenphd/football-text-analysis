Akbar: Blacks remain victims of 'mental servitude' 
By MICHELLE DALL News Staff 
"The legal barriers which defined blacks as less than American citizens in the past have been removed, but, men­tally, many people have stayed on the plantations," said Na'im Akbar, an expert on the psy­chology of African-Americans, during a lecture at the Res­burgh Library Auditorium Wednesday evening. 
The Black Cultural Arts So­ciety, in conjunction with the Office of Minority Student Af­fairs, sponsored the lecture in an effort to unite the black com­munity of South Bend with that of Notre Dame. 
Akbar is a clinical psycholo­gist from Florida State Univer­sity and an expert on the psy­chology of African-Americans. In 1987, he was the recipient of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Dis­tinguished Scholar Award. He has also earned the National Association of Black Social Workers Community Service Award and is currently a col­umnist fot"the "Muslim Jour­nal." 

In his speech, Akbar spoke primarily about the current condition of blacks in a predominantly white society. Although slavery was legally banned a century ago, Akbar said he believes that blacks remain victims of "mental ser­vitude" in modern society. 
Even today, Akbar claims that black students simply at­tend school to become "good slaves for a good market and, thus, perpetuate their planta­tion existence." 
"As blacks, we can be instru­ments of liberation for our people," he said. " We aren't doing this, however, because our minds belong to someone else." 
Akbar emphasized that the key to freedom from mental servitude is self-knowledge, stating, "Self-knowledge is the gateway to all the power we need. People enter the human experience by way of their own experiences, and truth is reached through different doorways." He continued, "You can come through some­one else's door, but then you belong to that person." 
He encouraged the audience to "find their own door" and search for wisdom within themselves. 
Akbar also stressed that blacks have the ability to see both sides of world issues and, thus, are "eminently qualified for world leadership."

In Brief 
The 75th anniversaryof Hellman's mayonnaise was celebrated with hoopla Wednesday. To mark the occasion, Best Foods invited seven New York delis to compete for the title of best sandwich an impressive title in a city where a slice of life is something with pastrami and mus­tard on it. The winning entry, offered by the New York Delicatessen on West 57th Street, consisted of smoked sal­mon and sable with cucumber, radish and Italian red onion on pumpernickel, smeared with herb-mayonaise sauce. "We wanted a sandwich that looks British but tastes Yid­dish," said Arthur Ribach, who created the sandwich along with Francois Fisera. -AP

The University: Coming together or growing apart 
Every long time reader of the Observer is familiar with the perennial editorial of the dis­gruntled freshman or sophomore who discovers that no diversity exists at this University and wishes to publish this finding in repudiation of all this supposed conformity. 
Usually the argument rests with a claim that a majority of students and faculty come from the same socio-economic background, share the same conservative political views, and are equally unwilling to break with the long stand­ing traditions and customs that distinguish this University from others. 
What is often forgotten in these articles, surprisingly, is the academic purpose that con­stitutes the University and the wide disparity that exists between the colleges and depart­ments as to how this mission is to be accom­plished. In the first two years of undergraduate study, the curriculum is sufficiently broad so that the different visions fostered by the col­leges and departments are not immediately ap­parent. 
But as class schedules become increasingly focused on a particular discipline and the choice of major is taken more and more seriously, an attitude develops that discriminates between classes taken merely because they are inter­esting or required and those that truly con­stitute an education. It is the difference between courses taken as blowoffs and those that really count, ie., the ones that make the hefty tuition bills all worthwhile. At a deeper level, the ques­tions that this attitude specifically addresses are these: What is a university? What am I here to learn? It is in the upper division classes and in the answers of graduate students and faculty that the disparity becomes most poig­nant. 
There are likely to be as many opinions as to what the university should do academically as there are people who have considered the ques­tion. Even within the same department fierce arguments might arise about how that partic­ular discipline fits within the context of the uni­versity as a whole. Some opinions are latent, others are explicit. Without meaning to stereotype anyone or any department, the di­versity of opinions concerning the academics of the modern university are illustrated in the following two examples. 
Within the College of Arts and Letters there is a tendency to cite the long tradition of western education as a model for what the university is all about. This line of thought argues that we are the inheritors of a rich cultural legacy in which the liberal arts excel as the truest, if not the only, form of education. The university is a forum for the pursuit of knowledge through the exchange of ideas. The liberal arts are the mind's tools used to sort out the good ideas from the bad, the true from the false. 
From this perspective, engineering and busi­ness administration are often scorned as servile occupations more fittingly taught at a trade school than at a university. In its severest form

this attitude will likewise question the empirical sciences, not for their usefulness, but for the limited insight they offer of the world. 
But there are others on this campus who take their academics just as seriously but find this idealistic pursuit of the liberal arts a futile waste of time. Courses in the humanities are interesting, and might even be taken for their cultural or entertainment value, but are not worth the sort of serious study devoted to the "hard sciences," ie., biology, chemistry, physics, etc. 
It is only through the hard sciences, they maintain, that real discoveries are made. Only there can progress be found in that the knowl­edge acquired over a four year period at least has the potential of being somewhat cumula­tive. Furthermore, what is taught in the hard sciences is in some degree verifiable -there is quantitative evidence that the theories corre­spond in some way to the actual world. 
The contrast between these somewhat sketchy models does more than illustrate a sig­nificant diversity of thought on this campus. It brings to light the prospect that the "broad edu­cation" promised by the University catalogue is more difficult to obtain than it appears. 
The question, I believe, is an important one. The way in which a university defines itself establishes the direction in which it will grow. It might be that a diversity of opinion on this question generates new ideas and is healthy for all. On the other hand, if visions fostered by the different disciplines should prove incompatible, the university splits and grows apart. A choice of one progr_am excludes all others.

Galbraith to address 
N.D. students October 13 
Special to the Observer 
John Kenneth Galbraith, economist, author and former government person­ality, will lecture at Notre Dame on Oct. 13. 
Galbraith, professor emeritus of economics at Harvard, has played an ac­tive role through public of­fice in the formation of economic policies of the American government. 
As a deputy administrator of the Office of Price Admin­istration in the early 1940's, Galbraith principally organ­ized the war-time system of price control, which he headed until 1943. He was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Harry S. Truman. 
An early supporter of John 
F. Kennedy, Galbraith also served on the campaign staff of Adlai Stevenson in 1952 and 1956. He was the chairman of the Economic Advisory Committee of the Democratic Advisory Coun­cil from 1956 to 1960 and served on Kennedy's 1960 convention staff. Galbraith was the U.S. ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963. 
Galbraith is a former editor of Fortune magazine and the author of many books. The most recent is his memoirs, "A Life in Our Times." Other well-known titles include "The Affluent Society," "The New Indus­trial State" and ''The Age of Uncertainty." His books are used in economics, business and American politics courses in colleges and uni­
versities  throughout  the  
country  and  around  the  
world.  

Tickets to his Notre Dame lecture are $2, and may be purchased in advance at The Cellar, the record shop in the lower floor of the LaFortune Student Center. 
The lecture, scheduled for 8 p.m. in Washington Hall, is sponsored by the Ideas and Issues Commission of the Student Union Board.

The United States began to escort 11 U.S. registered Kuwaiti tankers in July to protect them from attack by Iran, which considers Kuwait an ally of Iraq in the seven-year Iran-Iraq war. 
Witnesses said several non­

He added that to qualify for financial assistance in his state, a person with full-blown AIDS cannot own more than $1,500. 
Another victim of the full­blown disease also talked with the students about AIDS in his life. 
"I was diagnosed as having been exposed to AIDS last Oc­tober and was told that I would probably never suffer from the virus. But I was hospitalized shortly afterward for an ulcer and gall stones," he said. 
"I then lost 37 pounds by June of this year and I have pneumocystus. I have between six months and two years to live," he said. 
All four men urged the stu­dents to be tested for AIDS if they had any inclination that they may have been exposed to the virus.

Wallace said AIDS studies on college campuses are not reli­able and that MAC feels an ob­ligation to make this portion of the population aware of the devastation of the virus

role of women 
Associated Press 
VATICAN CITY -Roman Catholic officials from around the world will discuss giving women a greater role in church affairs -but not as priests ­when a monthlong bishops' synod opens Thursday. 
Pope John Paul II called the synod, a consultative body that advises the pope on various is­sues, to examine the role of the laity in church and society. 
The synod president, Monsig­nor Jan Schotte of Belgium, told a news conference Tuesday that 232 cardinals, bishops and church officials from more than 100 countries will attend the assembly. Also involved are 60 observers, including 26 women. 
The synod will begin Thursday with a Mass at St. Peter's Basilica. The synod will conclude Oct. 30 after four weeks of closed-door sessions.

Schotte said.  
The  Pope  said  last  month  

that the synod should concen­trate on ways of giving women a larger role in the Catholic Church, which has 850 million followers. 
Many Catholic women's or­ganizations, especially in the United States and other West­ern countries, have com­plained that the church is "patriarchal" and male-dominated. 
In a Sunday blessing Aug. 16, John Paul noted that the history of the church "is rich with the presence of women" and said the contribution of women had increased in recent years in the fields of evangelization, cate­chism, liturgy and theology. 
"This therefore seems an op­portune time to examine more deeply the ways in which the wider participation of women in the various sectors of the church's apostolate can be as­sured," he said.

Volunteer work a viable option 
Editor's Note: Today, the Center for Social Concerns is hosting the repre­sentatives of over 20 volunteer Post Grad programs between Noon and 4:00 
p.m. 
I've just returned home from my 1-9 shift which somehow usually lasts about 10 hours. I feel great having worked all day with a group of 25 street kids. It was challenging, to say the least, but I can't imagine myself doing anything else. Then I think back to a year ago, and what it was like for myself and 1700 other Notre Dame seniors... 
Michael DiPaolo 
guest column 

Every senior ponders the eternal question, "What am I going to do next year?" The need to make a career deci­sion by May becomes the focus of thought. The days pass, and the choices seem to be clearly laid out. IBM or USC. Northwestern Mutual or Northwestern University. A job or graduate school. Then someone mentions, "What about volunteer work?" 
Oh no. All too often these words go over like a lead balloon, getting less respect than Rodney Dangerfield. "Volunteer work is for people who don't know what they want to do," says one voice. "I don't want to be a priest (or nun)," defends another. What myths such statements imply. Nevertheless, it is because of such myths that the thought of volunteer work is ruled out. It is rejected without a second thought. 
But what about volunteer work? Let's look at a different, more positive view of it before we condemn it. 
A year of volunteer work is a year of service -to God, to the poor, etc. It is a year of giving in return for all the gifts with which a Notre Dame-St. Mary's student has been blessed. Now I know how you're all sick of hearing how "lucky" you are to live under the Dome, but talk to a 19-year-old high school dropout girl who just came into a runaway shelter with her two young children because her boyfriend beats the daylights out of her, and then maybe you just might realize how "lucky" you are. I know because it hap­pened to me. 
Call it divine providence, but as I pon­dered over those "only" two choices last fall, I received a brochure from the Covenant House, a crisis shelter for homeless youth run by Fr. Bruce Rit­ter. I thought to myself, "It seems nice, but I don't think that type of work is for me." Well, it's almost a year later and that type of work has been mine for over two months. 
I chose to do volunteer work because I wanted to give a year of my life in thanks for what I've been given and because of the great potential for spir­itual growth that it possesses. I chose to work at Covenant House because of its unique three-fold commitment to prayer, commup.ity living, and service to runaways and street kids. Although it is a difficult task, it is in balancing these three interrelated activities that there is a wholesome fulfillment to this lifestyle. It allows a person to peel away the superficial layers of one's person­ality and relationships, focusing on the fundamental core of being. It is chal­lenging, exciting, eye-opening, but most of all, it is giving of the self. And, as in all giving, a multitude of things is received. How many psychology majors do actual casework their first year out of school? My basic needs of food and shelter are provided. On top of all this, I even receive 12 dollars a week to spend any way I want! No, it's not champagne and caviar, but it is an occasional beer and peanuts. 
From my brief personal experiences, I've learned what the nature of volun­teer work is, and what it isn't. Volun­teer work isn't just for people who don't know what they want to do. Often, stu­dents defer acceptances to graduate school or simply wish to postpone those fun jobinterviews for awhile. As stated earlier, volunteer work is serving, and in the case of many organizations, it is serving God. But this does not imply that it is a stepping-stone to a religious vocation (as even my own girlfriend wondered). The lay community of the Church is a growing force and individ­uals should not feel hesitant about taking an active part in it. 
What I'm trying to say is to be open to the more than valid option of a year of volunteer work after graduation. It's a great way to reflect upon the past, grow and serve in the present, and prepare for the future. I wholeheart­edly recommend it, especially for the NThSMC student because of the special character of the Notre Dame commu­nity. Remember, law school will be there in two years, and so will the busi­ness world, but the rich experiences

P.O. Box Q 
CIA contradicting Church beliefs 
Dear Editor: 

Women United for Justice and Peace and Pax Christi-Notre Dame will dis­tribute leaflets outside the Hesburgh Li­brary Wednesday, Sept. 30 and Thursday, Oct.l in protest of the Central Intelligence Agency's inter­viewing on campus those same days. 
We believe that the activites of the 

C.I.A. stand in consistent contradiction to what the Church, in its social teach­ing, bishops' statements, and synods has taught regarding the legitimate rights of governments. The C.I.A. has been and continues to use assasination and disinformation that are geared toward the destabilization of various governments. We believe that these kinds of activities work against the ef­forts of governments to bring about the peace and justice of the Gospel through trust, mutual dialogue, and political discussion. The C.I.A. has also been in support of the "contrasn fighting against the people of Nicaragua, and these activities, already condemned by the U.S. Catholic Bishops, work against the legitimate struggle for a political solution to the troubles of Central America. The C.I.A. encourages fear and an atmosphere of distrust, indeed, has been involved in many activities that have resulted in the deaths of civilians in various countries, particu­larly in Central America. 
As Christians and Catholics, we hear the call of Jesus to work toward a world where justice and peace are the rule, and we seek to achieve these ends by way of political solutions and dialogue. We ask the Notre Dame community to 
consider these  concerns  thoughtfully  
and critically.

NFL strike wears on as 15 rejoin teams 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Another 15 players, including quarterback Danny White and eight-time Pro Bowl center Mike Webster, crossed picket lines Wednes­day as union chief Gene Up­shaw criss-crossed the country trying to prevent more defec­tions. 
That made it 39 players on 15 teams who have returned to practice camps since the NFL strike started nine days ago, according to an Associated Press count. The union has 1,585 players under its jurisdic­tion not including first-year players on injured reserve. 
Joining White and Webster were wide receiver Roy Green and defensive end Curtis Greer of the St. Louis Cardinals, Pit­tsburgh running back Earnest Jackson, and three New Or­leans Saints, including two starting defensive linemen, Bruce Clark and Tony Elliott. 

Upshaw, meanwhile, met for two-and-a-half hours with the Steelers then returned to his of­fices in Washington, bringing to nearly 8,000 miles the air time he has logged since Sun­day. 
Despite the new defections, Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Association, continued to maintain that players were solidly behind the strike.

They're poeple that past, pres­ent, and future Notre Dame people are going to be very proud of and are proud of. They make their contributions to the whole University community as others in different facets of the University make unique contributions to the totality of life at the University. It's been a very, very enjoyable and pleasant first couple of weeks. 
Q: What was it about the job

club designation. 
Meanwhile, on the Saint Mary's campus, the soccer pro­gram has begun its third var­sity season after four years on the club level. The Belles and the Irish have a "home-and­home" series every fall, and usually the matches are evenly played <Tuesday the two teams played to a 0-0 tie). But these games represent an extra chal­lenge to the Irish players -the challenge of beating a varsity team, an opportunity to prove they can play with varsity teams, an opportunity they don't get very often. ­
One hope would be for an upgrade of Notre Dame's team to varsity level, but Notre Dame has the necessary seven women's varsity teams to com­ply with Title IX. Adding an eighth team doesn't seem likely because revenues are down from the football and bas­ketball television contracts, ·-and the University is preparing 

that made you come out of re­tirement after 25 years as head the St. Joseph Bancorporation? 
A: First of all, there's a sup­position that there was some correlation between my resig­nation at the bank and my association here. They were to­tally and absolutely coinciden­tal. I didn't know and I don't know that anyone else ever knew that Gene Corrigan would be leaving the University. I resigned because I had been running a major organization for a long period of time, and my own personal feeling was 
to finance either an addition to Notre Dame Stadium or the construction of a brand new stadium. With new Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal using words like "fiscal responsibil­ity" in describing the minor sports program, women's soc­cer becomes less and less sig­nificant. 
There is only one dim hope

that periodically leadership ought to change in major insti­tutions. I started discussing that with our board at the bank five years before I retired. The bank was in marvelous shape, doing very well. It was a good time to step down. My only dif­ficulty was that I took the job as chief executive when I as 28, and 26 years later I probably too young to do nothing. 
My plan was to spend 90 days doing nothing, and then my wife and I were going to sit down and talk and think and 
for women's soccer. The first part is the continued rapid growth of soccer's popularity. The second is the demotion of one of the current women's var­sity programs to club level, replacing it with soccer. Why not go with "the sport of the world" while it is on the up­swing on the Notre Dame campus?

review opportunities and inter­ests. I was then going to deter­mine what kind of opportunity I was going to do for the rest of my life. Purely coincidentally and shortly after my retirement, Gene did step down. The posi­tion was offered to me -per­haps maybe the most demand­ing athletic director's position in America. I've had some background in athletics and a long-term association with the University. I've had a lifetime of living in this community. The opportunity to come here is one I'm very grateful for, one I'm very happy with and one I'm humbled by. It's a job that you certainly have to recognize the past accomplishments of Notre Dame athletics. It's a fairly significant responsibility to try to carry on and improve upon that tradition in the fu­ture. 
The University is a very dynamic place. More women are coming on board. It seems that the opportunities for wo­men to participate in athletics are going to have to be reviewed. There are just a whole host of significant choices that I think are in front of us in terms of where this pro­gram is going. Ifwe can always keep that theme in mind of what's best for the individual student, we'll make some good choices.

Streeter has been setting a tremendous example so far, near the top of the Irish leaders in tackles with 16, and passes broken up, with three. 
"George has extremely sound fundamentals," notes Irish Secondary Coach Terry Forbes. "He's just a natural athlete, and right now, George Streeter is playing the best football of his career.'' 
One might expect a leader of a 3-0 football team, ranked fifth causing a fumble and setting in the nation, to be a little up a quick Irish score. cocky. Not Streeter. "I love the special teams," 
"We're pleased with the way Streeter says. "It is important we have played so far this for me to be on the field.

football player.'' 
Coach Lou Holtz has had a very strong effect on Streeter. He believes in Holtz and the other coaches, and in what they can accomplish together. 
"We know that we can beat anybody if we do what we are supposed to do," Streeter says. "It's not a matter of if we are going to win, but whether we will play well or not while doing it." 
A graduate of Julian High School in Chicago, Streeter, not surprisingly, is an ardent fan of the Chicago Bears. 
"The thing I like most about the Bears is the way they win," said Streeter. "They leave no doubt as to who the best team is. They physically beat the other team -their pride won't let them do anything differ­ent." 
Coming into the 1987 season, the Notre Dame defense did not have a name for itself. Now, it has a name, of sorts. 
"The 'No-Name Defense' fits us," notes Streeter. "We just go out and do our job. That's what we are -a team, not names." 
Forbes likes Streeter's atti­tude, as well as what he sees from him on the field. 
"George's confidence is in­fectious, it affects the entire team," Forbes says. "We're looking for him to reach a new plateau, an even higher level of play."

Irish face challenge at four-day tourney 
By ROBERT MITCHELL Sports Writer 
The women's tennis team will engage this weekend in a tournament that will test their skill as well as their endurance. 
The team will journey to the Midwest Invitational Tourna­ment that is hosted by Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The Irish will face the likes of Iowa, Purdue and Kansas. This four­day tournament runs Thursday through Sunday and may pres­ent the toughest competition of the season for Notre Dame. 
With the loss of Alice Lohrer and Resa Kelly for the season because of injuries, Head Coach Michele Gelfman is forced to shuffle the lineup. Among the changes is the teaming of freshman wonder Ce Ce Cahill and captain Mic­hele Dasso as the number-one doubles team. 
Natalie Illig moves up to the 
number-five slot and Anne­
Marie Dega is slated to play at 
number six. Gelfman believes that both players will be able to handle their promotions with ease, saying that they have each made their games stronger since last year and their hard work is paying off on the court. 


Gelfman does not believe the injuries will adversely affect the team's play. 
"It's essential for the team to play consistently throughout the tournament," said Gelfman. 
The tournament consists of one draw each for singles and for doubles, as well as a con­solation bracket for the losers of the first round. It is essential for the Irish players to get of,f to a good start and not become mired in the consolation bracket. 
Heading into this weekend's play with high hopes, Gelfman

The Notre Dame volleyball team suffered a heartbreaking five-game loss to Northwestern Wednesday night at Evanston, Ill., 10-15, 15-10, 15-12, 11-15, 15­8. 
The Irish jumped out front in the first game, but the 16th­ranked Wildcats regrouped to take the second and third games. 
Northwestern had a 10-5lead in the fourth game, but Notre Dame scored 10 of the final 11 points in the game to even the games at two and force a final fifth game.

Rosenthal impressed with his new surroundings 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
Editors Note-This is the first of a two-part interview with Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal. Rosenthal took the post on August 4 after Gene Corrigan resigned to be­come the commissioner of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Rosenthal previously served as the president and chief execu­tive officer of the St. Joseph Bancorporation for 25 years and had recently resigned that post. Rosenthal is a former Irish all-A me,rica basketball player. In today's first install­ment, Rosenthal talks about taking the athletic director's post. 
Q: What are your first im­pressions? 

A: It's been fabulous, it really has. I guess the most im­portant impression is the professionalism of the whole Athletic Department, and that not only includes personnel but organization. It's a very profes­sionally run organization. It's organized well. It's defined well. People have their jobs properly described. They un­derstand their assignments and execute them well. It's as professionally done as anyth­ing I've ever been associated with. 
Having said all that and the structure I guess is there and maybe the structure is the product of the people. The people are as good at doing their jobs as anyone I've ever been associated with. 
To describe these people you've got to quote Ghandi, 

Dick Rosenthal 
'You've got to run like crazy to catch up to your own people, and you're supposed to be their leader.' That, I think, was the first and most striking impres­sion. 
From a coaching standpoint, the coaches are wonderfully cooperative people. Lou Holtz is the best football coach in America just because he's the best person in America. I'm convinced that the theme in this whole department is to con­sider the individual athlete that participates in the program aml!or student who participates in the Non-Varsity program. At every staff meeting the ques­tion keeps coming up, 'What's best for the individual athlete? What's best for the individual student?' And it's become my Bible in terms of what ap­proach I bring to any opportu­nity or problem. If we always keep that in mind we will pro­vide the University with a pro­gram that (A) they can be very proud of (B) that supplements and rounds out the whole edu­cational experience and (C) one that will be successful be­cause it will attract good people. 
Our coaches, I think, have a commom theme. They're great teachers. I'm convinced that's a requirement for coaching today. We have fine personnel and we cannot be competitive without having fine athletes. For a variety of reasons, the University has been able to at­tract very fine athletes. The joy of the job in the early stages which, I'm sure, is going to be the joy forever, is the associa­tion with these young people. I knew some of these folks by name but really didn't have a chance to understand them and know them as people. They're really enjoyable people.

Soccer catching on at Notre Dame 
It's known around the world as football, but this sport doesn't use a brown, funny-shaped ball. 
Soccer is the fastest growing sport in America, despite its previous lethargic existence in this country for several decades. In the past 10 years, soccer has gone from from an anomoly to a high­participation sport. Though this growth is not quite yet visible in the pro ranks, youth leagues have been expanding as kids choose soccer over football in the fall and over baseball in the spring. 
As the first decade of rapid growth comes to a close, the kids are moving into the college ranks, and soccer is now becoming popular on the college campuses. 
A perfect test case for this is Notre Dame. 
Notre Dame's men's varsity soccer program did not gain varsity status until 1977. Led by the flam­boyant Rich f!unter through 1983 and guided now by fourth-year head coach Dennis Grace, the 10-0-1 Irish are ranked 11th in a national poll and catching the attention of the campus and the local South Bend community. Attendance for the first five home games averaged over 1,000 per game. 
"I think our popularity has increased interest, but it's not only because of our success," says Grace. "The students and the fans know the nuances of soccer a~d they know what to look for. They're just more intelligent, and it's always better to know something about the sport. 
"It's not so much our team as the fact that more kids are exposed to soccer on a national level from the youth leagues up." 
As a school noted for its frustrated athletes and olympic training villiage atmosphere, Notre Dame students have flocked to the Interhallleague to con-

tinue playing competitive soccer. Rich O'Leary, co­ordinator of Non-Varsity Athletics, says that men's soccer is the fastest growing Interhall sport. 
"We used to allow only one team per dorm," says O'Leary. "Now we have 27 teams -we're running at capacity. Indoor soccer is also very popular-we have to limit the winter tournament to 32 teams." 
While former players are pushing the growth of soccer at Notre Dame, there is an increasing inter­est in soccer among stangers to the game. 
"My interest is still in the working stages," says Gigi Junkins, a junior from Coralville, Iowa, who was in attendance at the Notre Dame-Indiana game. "I need to get to know th~ positions more before I really start understanding it.'' 
Women's soccer is also growing at the Interhall level, but in a manner different from the men's league. Many girls have never kicked around a soc­cer ball in the past, but are eager to learn now. 
"I have girls always asking me to teach them how to play in the Inter hall league," says Kate Titterton, president of the Notre Dame women's soccer club and captain of the Pasquerilla West team. 
The increasing popularity of soccer at Notre Dame highlights the fact that women's soccer is not a varsity sport here. 
Titterton is a four-year veteran of the women's team, and as president she handles the team or­ganization and, the scheduling of games. She has seen the tryouts grow to 45 players this past fall, and she has been especially impressed with the talent of the freshmen. 
As the talent on her team improves, the talent of Notre Dame's opponents is thinning. The cause is the upgrade of several regional women's teams to varsity. Michigan State and Kalamazoo, for exam­ple, now refuse to play Notre Dame because of its
