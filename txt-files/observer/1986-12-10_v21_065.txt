Former aides take Fifth Amendment before committee 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Two of Pres­ident Reagan's recently departed national security aides, both still active-duty military officers, refused to publicly answer questions Tuesday from a House commit­tee trying to explore the Iranian-Contra arms-and-money connection. 
The dramatic invocations of Fifth Amendment rights by Vice Adm. John Poindexter and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North brought an increasing aura of rnystery to the burgeoning foreign policy scandal. 
The twin refusals to testify came as the Reagan adminis­tration appeared, still, to be at odds with itself over exactly what happened and how offi­cials should respond to con­gressional demands for answers. Retired Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, another prin­cipal figure in the controversy, took the Fifth Amendment 
Grads to get 'best seats' if they request 1 or 2 
By MARK PANKOWSKI News Editor 
In a letter delivered Tues­day, 1987 Notre Dame graduates learned they'll be guaranteed the "best seats" in the ACC for commencement ceremonies, but only if they re­quest one or two tickets. 
Those asking for three ACC tickets, the letter continued, will be guaranteed three seats for the May 17 ceremony. 
Those asking for four tickets, however, will only be assured three arena seats. The three seats, which may or may not be together, will "most likely" be in the bleachers. 
Moreover, depending on the demand for arena seats, the before the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
In citing their constitutional right against self­incrimination, Poindexter, Reagan's former national se­curity adviser, and North, fired as a key National Security Council aide, declined in sepa­rate, nationally broadcast, ap­pearances before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to discuss any aspect of U.S. arms sales to Iran or the transfer of profits to Nicaraguan Contra rebels. 
"I must decline to answer that question at this time be­cause of my constitutional rights under the Fifth Amend­ment," Poindexter, who resigned Nov. 25, told the com­mittee. 
"On the advice of counsel, I respectfully and regretfully decline to answer the question based on my constitutional rights," responded North, who

fourth ticket may be for a closed-circuit telecast of the ceremony in the Center for Continuing Education. 
In late September, Univer­sity officials announced they no longer could guarantee four ACC tickets. They attributed the potential shortfall in tickets to the "record number" of graduating students and na­tional interest in University President Father Theodore Hesburgh's farewell.

HPC discusses drunk drivers and Howard 
By REGIS COCCIA Assistant News Editor 
The problem of drinking and driving and the closing of Howard Hall were two of the topics discussed at Tuesday night's Hall Presidents' Coun­cil meeting. 
The Council discussed possi­ble reactions by the adminis­tration to the accident that killed Zahm Hall Junior Mi­dents for ideas to cut down on drinking and driving. HPC members argued against the use of breathalyzers by Notre Dame Security. 
Hall presidents said breath testing was "a mockery; people just wanted to see how high a rating they could get." Several said the testing tended to "promote drinking" rather than discourage driving. 
The Council also discussed adding, "we've been trying to do it for 10 years." 
Coordinator for Board of Trustees Reports Bruce Loh­man said "You have to ask whether an overpass will solve anything,'' noting the pollution centered around overpasses. "The problem is that cars travel at high rates of speed at that point," Lohman said. Even if an overpass was there, would (the accident that killed to happen to us," said Howard Hall President Jim Bradford. "We weren't notified until the campus got letters.

Don't stop dreams of Santa in the next generation of kids 
I remember the Christmas -I found out there was no Santa Claus. 
My disillusionment came in art class, where the other first graders and I were making Christmas cards for our parents out of bits of cotton, some glitter and stacks of construction paper. 
Feeling sorry for my parents because Santa never left anything under the tree for them (they were just too big, I reasoned), I was busy pasting globs of cotton to my red paper in a somewhat vain attempt to create a Santa Claus face on their card. I didn't want them to think Santa had forgotten them. 
While I was drawing suitably rosy cheeks and a big toothy grin on my Santa, Ricky Hogya (we thought he knew everything because, having flunked a year, he was already 7 V2 and easily older than all of us) looked over my shoulder and laughed at my effort. 
"What are you putting him on your parents' card for?" Ricky jeered. "Everyone knows there isn't a Santa Claus. Your parents pretend to be him!" 
Even though I, like the rest of the first graders, usually believed what Ricky said about this kind of thing, I thought he had to be wrong this time. After all, Santa Claus was everywhere around Christmas time. There were television specials about him and songs about him. Long lines of children waited to see him everywhere; only days before I had sat on his lap with my little sister Amy and told him what I wanted from the North Pole. Of course he was real, I assured myself. 
But Ricky had put the first doubts in my mind. I began to wonder how Santa Claus could be everywhere--ringing bells and rattling cans on a street corner one minute, sitting inside a de­partment store greeting children the next. I began to speculate about how Santa got into my house; there was no chimney for him to slide down, no fireplace for him to drag his sack of toys through. He would have to get through my front door, I reasoned, but that was always locked. 
But I kept hoping that I was wrong, that Ricky didn't know everything, that Santa Claus would somehow still come. 
On Christmas Eve, my brother Tim helped me look through the big atlas to plot Rudolph's path across the world, just like we always had. 
Right before bed, I left the traditional plate of goodies with a carefully printed note for Santa and his reindeer, but this time I sub­stituted raisins for the reindeer's carrots, be­cause I knew my dad hated raisins. I planned to check if they had been eaten the next morning

... just to make sure that the reindeer really did come. Then I lay in bed with my eyes squeezed shut and waited and hoped. 
When I woke up that Christmas morning, I didn't run immediately to the Christmas tree to see what Santa had left like I usually did. Instead, I crept into the kitchen to begin my search. I really didn't expect to find anything, but there they were, hidden on a high shelf in the cupboard: the raisins which my dad just couldn't eat, with the note folded up underneath. Ricky was right; there was no Santa Claus. 
It's funny that I can't remember anything else that happened that morning, maybe be­cause somewhere deep inside my now-adult mind is a little corner that still doesn't want to give up the magical, mythical essence of Santa Claus tucked away there that long-ago morning. It's still neat to believe that a jolly man bedecked in red makes children all over the world happy by leaving them toys, even when their doors are locked. 
And now when my nieces and nephews ask me if there really is a Santa Claus, I don't hesitate to tell them yes. They'll "grow up" soon enough when some other Ricky tells them the truth. 
In the meantime, I'll help them celebrate Christmas Eve like I once did. And in case one of them ever tries to catch Santa Claus like I did, I'll even eat the raisins.

SMC senior finishes in top 15 of pageant 
By MARGIE KERSTEN Saint Mary's Editor 
The Miss Indiana pageant concluded Sunday night and Saint Mary's senior Gertie Wimmer finished in the top fif­teen. "After the pageant, my father asked me if it was worth it, and all I could do was nod. It was more than worth it," said the EnglishGerman major. 
After being notified that she was a contestant in the pageant just 2 months ago, Wimmer said she underwent a rigorous plan of exercise and dieting. 
"People in the audience laughed when I announced the 'Quick Weight Loss Center' in Merrillville as my sponsor, but I can't imagine being in the pageant 24 pounds ago," Wim­mer said, adding "I was still apprehensive about the swim suit contest." 
Each contestant had a spon­sor who paid the basic fee of $350 for their participation and for their ads in the program. Anyone could sponsor a contes­tant selected for the state finals--companies, friends or family. 
The 54 contestants competed in both swimsuits and evening gowns on stage, and were in­terviewed earlier by five judges in private. "Being a 'W' I was about the last person to meet the judges. The other girls kept asking, 'Aren't you nervous?' But it never even oc­curred to me to be nervous. I was too excited." 
The interviews were limited 
to two minutes with each judge 
with a buzzer marking the end 
of each term. The contestants 
wore their evening gowns while 
the judges asked them about fu­
ture plans, their reasons for 
being in the pageant and what 
was their most important past 
experience. The final15 contes­
tants were determined after 
these initial interviews. 
After that judging the women 
got into street clothes and 
rehearsed for about three 
hours, Wimmer said. Rehear­
sal included instructions on 
what to do if a contestant made 
the final selections (final fif­
teen, and final five), as well as 
how to walk on stage and how 
to approach the microphone 
during the introductions. 
Of the fifteen finalists, Wim­mer said her name was called last. "I wasn't expecting to be called at all. The girl behind me had to give me a shove so I would move to the front." 
Wimmer said her future plans might include pageants, because "I really enjoyed the experience of meeting people, especially while working to­gether under stress. It brought out the best in people, or at least the funniest." 
Wimmer said the most surprising part of the whole ex­perience was the other contes­tants. "I had expected them to be stereotypical beauty queens. Instead, I found girls who would be a lot of fun to party with."

In fires last week, one restau­rant was destroyed and an­other extensively damaged. Losses from the fires were es­timated at more than $400,000. Another McDonald's was evacuated Sunday evening while police investigated a bomb threat. Police refused to confirm reports that a bomb was found there and other McDonald's reportedly have been the sources of bomb threats. 
Investigators are concerned with suspicious activities at any local restaurant and are not limiting their investigation to McDonald's restaurants, Ruszkowski said.

"mistakes were made." With­out directly apologizing for the policy that resulted in the big­gest flap of his nearly 6-year presidency, Reagan promised to "set things straight" with the American people. 
While members of Congress turned up the heat for answers, two former presidents offered their views : 
Richard Nixon described the Iran-Contra controversy as "a sideshow" and said it was time for critics of Reagan to ''get off his back." Nixon's comments were made during a closed­door meeting with Republican governors in Parisappany, N.J. 
Jimmy Carter said Reagan appears to be trying to hide the facts. 
Reagan appears to want the Congress to have to dig for the facts, meaning they will come out piecemeal "and that could be more damaging," Carter said in an interview in Atlanta. 
In another development, Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, who strongly supports covert 
U.S. aid to Afghan guerillas said he had been assured by CIA director William Casey that the mixing of money for Nicaragua's Contras with Af­ghan aid was a clerical error and did not divert any money intended for the Aghans. 
Poindexter and North had previously declined to answer questions during private ses­sion of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and North later Tuesday cited the Fifth Amendment during an appear­ance before the House Intelligence Committee, said a committee source who declined to be named publicly.

P.O. BoxQ 
Dialogues can bring us closer to each other 

Dear Editor: 
I've noticed with interest the recent articles and letters in The Observer on the Grace Hall Debates as well as the articles on the need to understand the other's point of view. These challenge the stereotypical view of the Domer who lives in the "little world" of pop­corn and parties unconcerned about the community at large -national or inter­national. 
With the support and help of friends and interested people I have been trying to organize an informal meeting where we could learn how to under­stand the other's point of view through "dialogue." Dialogue is a step further from "debate" which enables the mutual opening up of understanding of the other's point of view. In this process, hopefully we can move a step closer to each other. 
With the support of the International Student Organization we had hoped to have one such session this semester. Academic pressures assured me that the way to hell is paved with good in­tentions. 
Perhaps we can work on this early next semester. The first meeting could help improve communication between the Administration and students. The topic could be "Notre Dame in the 21st Century." Fr. Malloy could be invited to share his insights and then a panel of students could respond -a freshman, a foreign student, an American student who has studied or worked abroad, and a graduate student. Like the idea? Then let's act on it and get those channels of communication moving!

Some use Breathalyzer as a drinking contest 

Dear Editor: 
This past Friday I had the opportu­nity to spend time at the Alumni-Senior Club, socializing with friends. This was also the night that the Notre Dame Se­curity Department was offering free Breathalyzer tests to any student inter­ested in knowing his or her blood alcohol content <BAC). 
What bothered me was the attitude of a group of Notre Dame students, who took the opportunity to have a drinking contest. Their contest consisted of drinking nonstop for a few hours, then proceding to the Lewis bus shelter to have their BAC tested. The winner of the contest was the guy who had the highest blood alcohol content. 
The very night that the Breathalyzer test was given, a life was lost, in a a tragic, senseless accident. 
As a member of the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community, I was shocked at the casual attitude this· group of stu­dents (and possibly others) took toward the test. The test was given for a spe­cific reason by Security, and this type of abuse is plainly stupid. 
It's sad to know that a group of stu­dents in our community could take such an attitude toward the Breathalyzer test. I could only hope and pray that. the student who was driving his "drink­ing buddies" that night had the com­mon sense to give up his car keys.

Uprooting dorm places quotas over students 
Dear Editor: 

What comes to mind when one thinks of Notre Dame? A close-knit, caring home away from home? For the 165 Howard Hall residents, their visions will soon be shattered. The admission off 150 more girls next year at Notre Dame will force Howard's "family" to uproot and move into various dorms. 
Why doesn't Notre Dame wait until the new dorms are built before admit­ting more females? Or why don't they put incoming freshman girls in study lounges in existing women's halls as they do freshman guys? There would only be twenty more girls in each female dorm. It doesn't seem fair that Howard residents, who have lived with the same friends for several years, are going to have to split up. 
Apparently Notre Dame is becoming more concerned with admissions than with the lives of their current students. We are all in favor of admitting more girls, but not at the expense of disrupt­ing the lives of the Howard family. Surely another answer could have been found instead of turning the lives of Howard residents upside-down. It's sad to realize that Notre Dame is not quite the caring place we thought it was. As one Howard resident said, "If Notre Dame truly stands for Our Mother, why is she kicking us out of our home?"

Reagan displays genius in foreign policy-making 
With all the controversy surrounding the Iranian arms shipment, things are getting pretty ugly in Washington. Our great leader Ronbo seems to have blown his image. Considering the Con­tras connection and the CIA involve­ment, "Irangate" is a fitting term for the incident. 

Brian Murray 
guest column 
But people have lost sight of what Reagan may have, or at least tried to have, achieved. To a few suspicious minds, though, Reagan proved that he is a genius foreign policy maker. 
On the surface of the Iranian Arms Debacle, Reagan seemed to contradict his hardline hostage and terrorist 

Doonesbury 
policies. Vowing never to bargain with terrorists, nor to perpetuate the hostage situation by giving them the arms they need to take other hostages, he nonetheless supplied them weapons. 
But the hostages may have been only an excuse for a deeper, more important goal. Reagan actually made a valiant attempt to make friends with Iran. 
Yes, I said friends with Iran. Why would anyone want to be friends with Iran? Get your nose out of your books and stick it on a globe. Iran is the So­viet's key to the Mideast. 
Situated in one of the world's most important areas, Iran is critical to stop­ping the Soviet expansion policy. Bla­tant facts point toward a Soviet inva­sion of Iran. First, the country stands between Russia and the Red Sea. Secondly, Russian domination of Iran threatens the Mideast's oil, our oil. Fi­nally, Iran is next door to Afghanistan and is second in line on the Soviet World Domination Agenda. 
The Kremlin salivates everytime Iran is mentioned, and the Iran-Iraq war is the perfect opportunity for an invasion. If Iraq wins, and the odds of winning are starting to weigh in their favor, Russia will have an excuse to invade Iran, to "secure its borders." History has proven that Russia will jump at the chance of an invasion with the recent destruction of Afghanistan. Traditionally, the United States has al­ways had a presence in Iran. We are not there to protect Iran now. 
Instead of contradicting his terrorist policy, Reagan may have been trying to help Iran win the war with Iraq. A victory would help Iran stay indepen­dent of the Soviets. Also, American aid might be the basis of future negotia-

tions with Iran and could block any Iranian ties with Russia. An Iranian loss could only destablize the Mideast. 
But how could one bargain with the hated devil, the Ayatollah? Well, the ailing leader may not even be running the country now, let alone in future years. Reagan may have recognized the benefit in helping their future leaders, the seconds of Khomeini. 
If the next leader in Iran is on better terms with the United States, possibly because we helped Iran to win the war, the United States will have a foot in the door. Of course, helping terrorists is a crime. But helping future allies secure an important and critical country is an admirable goal. Reagan may have done just that.

Students once again have a home away from dorm. The newly refurbished Lafortune Student Center offers students a place to meet, snack, study and even sleep. Clockwise from top left: The Huddle Snack Bar is once again open to the public in the student center after its stint in the North Dining Hall. Director of Food Services, William Hickey, Jr., talks on the telephone at the pizza counter, one of three food service counters in the expanded Huddle. The Uni­versity Hair Stylists now snip and prim customers' hair in the basement of Lafortune, as this coiffeur does to this young woman. 
Junior Jim Moore studies and snacks at a table in a room off of the Huddle. Sweet Shop patrons (from left to right: Jo Henriquez, Jon Miki, Blake Schomas and Mike Corbellini) enjoy cones and sundaes any day of the week. Sophomore Brian Samuels catches 40 winks in Lafortune's Main Loby. Eileen Higgins and Mike Cambi crack the books at a booth in the student center's basement that is reminiscent of Mom's kitchen table. Irish Garden's business blossoms in its new, larger location in the basement of the center.

"We're looking for a win first," DiStanislao said. "We'll worry about captains later." 
IRISH ITEMS -Late in the first half, one of the overhead lights at the ACC fell to the ground and shattered near the Notre Dame bench. No one was injured in the incident. . . Freshman guard Julie Garske wore a facemask throughout the game because of a frac­tured nose she suffered in Notre Dame's loss to Colorado this past weekend. "Now we call her Jason,'' joked DiStanis­lao.

wrestlers on the mat every dual meet. 
"It's just like the lead off man in baseball. I like to get the ball rolling," said Raden­baugh. "The first match is when the crowd is up the high­est, and in a dual meet it's im­portant to get momentum." _ As a two-time state cham­pion at St. Joseph's High School in Michigan, Radenbaugh con­sidered attending Indiana, Pitt, and Michigan before choosing Notre Dame. 
"I was looking for a place where I could step right in," said Radenbaugh. "The other programs were more estab­lished, and I wanted to go to a program that was up and com­ing." 
McCann knew Radenbaugh had the talent to step right in and make an impact his fresh­man year. 
"I thought he had enough ability to start. We thought that when we first recruited him," said McCann. "The ability was there, but we were concerned with the mental aspect. He's shown a really good mental at­titude, especially in this last tournament." 
In last weekend's Las Vegas Invitational, Radenbaugh won four of six matches, barely losing to a wrestler from fourth-ranked Oklahoma State. In other tournaments against top-flight competition, he placed first in the Michigan State Invitational, and fourth in the St. Louis Open. 
"He needs this kind of com­petition more often. He prob­ably benefitted the most from this tournament (Las Vegas In­vitational)," said McCann. "We have to give him the toug­hest competition we can. He's smart, conscientious, and has a great attitude." 
The competition Raden­baugh has seen so soon in his college career is a far cry from his high school days, when he pinned 110 of 176 opponents, and won the Junior National Wrestling Tournament the summer after his senior year. 
"There are no more easy matches. In high school, I could just breeze to the finals and just get up for that match," said Radenbaugh. "In college you can't do that; you have to be up for every match. 
"The biggest change has been the strength of everybody. I've wrestled guys this year that are stronger than me. That's something I have to work on because a lot of matches in college have just come down to brute strength." 
Still, Radenbaugh isn't in awe of his competitors either, and he has set some lofty goals for himself this season. 
"I'd like to win at least 25 matches and qualify for nation­als, which I don't think is out of the question," said Raden­baugh. "If I wrestle the way I can, people will respect me."

By GEORGE TRAVERS Sports Writer 
The season is not as long as the NBA's, only lasting three months with playoff action set to begin in late February, but the long 1986-87 men's interhall basketball season officially opened Monday with teams scrambling to get an early jump on the competition. 
As a result, several close games were battled out in the ACC intramural gyms this week, giving spectators and players a small sample of what lies ahead. 
As has been the case in recent years, men's play has 

.. been divided up between A divi­sions and B divisions, with champions to be named for each category. The A division consists of separate confer­ences titled Big Sky, ACC, and Big Ten, while the B division consists of the Pac-10, ECAC, SEC, and Major Independents conferences. Action began in the Big Sky Monday with St. Ed's A sneak­ing by Off-Campus A, 69-65, Stanford A downing Cavanaugh A, 57-43, and Keenan A1 beating Zahm A, 56­51. Keenan coach Mychal Schulz was one person particularly satisfied to get a quick victory, as he expects his team to step up this year and challenge for the conference title. "We played great for most of 
way we looked tonight, we can play with anybody -including (preseason favorites) Grace and Flanner. We have a lot of young players who will play much better after Christmas break." 
In the ACC division, mean­while, the trend of close games continued as OC-A edged Alumni Al, 54-53. Dillon Al, however, did not follow suit, trouncing Flanner A2, 88-30. 
As might be expected in such a case, the lopsided score had Dillon coach Frank Izzo anx­ious to get on to the next test. 
"It seemed like a physical mismatch," said Izzo after the Big Red's win. "We just played with great intensity. We're ex­cited about the season and are looking forward to making the playoffs." 
One team which is expected to give Dillon a good fight for the ACC crown, however, has not even played. Grace A2, usually one of the stonger campus teams, received a bye in the first round and will have to wait until after Christmas to play. 
"There are some impressive teams in our division this year," admitted Grace coach Jerry Melia. "But I feel this bye we received can only be bene­ficial to us. The guys can con­centrate on final exams and prepare for the dog days of Jan­uary and February." 
The Big Ten conference, nevertheless, may be the most 

the game," said Schulz. "The competitive division. Among

the many strong teams playing in this grouping is last year's interhall champions, Sorin A, which survived an opening­round scare by nipping Fisher, 32-31, on Monday. Also on Mon­day, Holy Cross A whipped Dil­lon A2, 75-42. 

The B division may not com­prise as much talent, but the early games proved to be just as fierce. In the SEC confer­ence, O.C. blew past Morrisey B, 42-17, while in the PAC-10, Morrisey B Gold fell to Keenan B, 34-23. 
Also in B-division games, Cavanaugh B jumped out to the lead in the ECAC conference with a 40-37 win over Keenan C, while Dillon B2 did the same in the Major Independents by defeating Flanner 3B, 41-33. Defending B-champion Stan­ford has yet to play. 
Stanford, as well as all the other teams, will get plenty of chances to play when action resumes after the holidays. 

in the illegal actions that took place at SMU, or they should make sure they do not get an­other job at the college level. 
But in spite of these "downers" we can always look forward to the big New Year's Day bowl games, right? Wrong. Even the reliable Jan­uary 1 pick-me-up has failed me this year. Our friends at Miami and Penn State saw to that. 
This time, instead of renew­ing the tradition of plopping in front of the television to see who our new national cham­pion is going to be, we can get some extra sleep and we won't miss anything but a slew of mediocre games that will decide who has a shot at being ranked second. 
All the traditional New Year's Day games lack the glit­ter of years past. Oklahoma faces Arkansas in the Orange Bowl, which has decided the national champion the past few seasons. Not this year. The Cot­ton Bowl continues to slip, as Texas A & M will face Ohio Granddaddy of 'em all? Obvi­ously this granddaddy has not aged well. Michigan will try to break the Big Ten's dry spell. Good luck Bo. But even if they win, won't that just bring up more painful memories of how a pack of Gophers cost them a shot at No. 1. Of course, it is rather foolish to think about the possibility of Michigan winning anyway, isn't it? 
All the New Year's Day ex­citement has been delayed a day this year. The Fiesta Bowl won the bidding for the privilege to host the dream matchup between undefeated Miami and Penn State. Good old college football, the game played for fun, has beco~e a prize to be awarded to the high­est bidder. And then the highest bidder gets to name the day it would like the teams to play. Just great, isn't it? 
Merry Christmas everyone.

The Observel'IGreg Kohs Freshman guard Julie Garske, sporting a protective fasemask over her recently-fractured nose, came off the bench last night to score 14 points but it wasn't enough as Notre Dame fell to Indiana, 80-71. Marty Strasen has details of the game at right. 
Wisconsin-Parkside on tap at ACC 
Youth can't carry Irish to victory as Indiana drops ND's mark to 0-4 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
Youth can be precious for the future of a basketball team, and while some young players showed flashes of what the fu­ture might hold Tuesday night, Head Coach Mary DiStanislao and the Notre Dame women's basketball team is more con­cerned about the present. 
Last night at the ACC, the present held yet another loss for the 0-4 Irish, as a disciplined Indiana team rode an impres­sive second-half shooting per­formance to an 80-71 triumph. The 0-4 start is the worst in the history of women's basketball at Notre Dame. 
"What you have is a lot of people out there who haven't logged a lot of playing time," DiStanislao said of her young squad, which played the Hoosiers to a 29-29 tie at halftime, but which could not overcome some hot shooting by the Hoosiers' Karna Abram (24 points, 18 in the second half). "It showed. They fouled the 
wrong  people  and  took  the  
wrong  shots  at  the  wrong  
times.  


NAIA power will test ND wrestlers 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
The Wisconsin-Parkside wrestling team may have NAIA, Division II status, but the Notre Dame wrestling team is anything but overcon­fident going into tonight's match with the Rangers at 7 
p.m. in the ACC Pit. 
"We better be ready or we'll get beat otherwise," said Irish head coach Fran McCann. "(Wisconsin-Parkside) has had a solid program for years. I think they have better people than Air Force." 
Air Force defeated Notre Dame in the season-opening match for Notre Dame. The Irish have not competed in a dual meet since that loss to the Falcons. 
Notre Dame will have to compete without 158-pound junior Dan Carrigan, who may be out for the rest of the season with an injured knee. Fresh­man Michael Sheets, who won the high school state champi­onship at Nevada last season, will take Carrigan's place. 
Other starters for the Irish will be 118-pound freshman Andy Radenbaugh, 126-pound senior Greg Fleming, 134­pound sophomore captain Jerry Durso, 142-pound sophomore Pat Boyd, 150-pound junior Ron Wisniewski, 167-pound sopho­more Chris Geneser, 177-pound senior Tom Ryan, and 190­pound senior Dave Helmer. The match will be televised by Sports Vision on a later date. 
"Wisconsin-Parkside is al­ways one of the top schools in the NAIA and Division II. I only know a couple of their kids, but they're tough hard-nosed guys," said McCann. "We have to go out with a lot of aggres­siveness, and we'd like to get a good crowd." 
McCann also stressed the im­portance of a strong perfor­mance by Radenbaugh in the opening 118-pound match. 
"It sets the tempo. It's ex­tremely important to get a good start," noted McCann. "That's what we're hoping to get with Andy this week." 
Radenbaugh likes the pres­sure of being one of the first

The Observel'IGreg Kohs The Notre Dame wrestling team will take to to Division II power Wisconsin-Parkside. Steve the mats of the ACC Pit tonight as it plays host Megargee previews the meet above. 
"Sandy Botham (14 points) and Mary Gavin (10 points) are the only ones out there with any substantial amount of experi­ence. But when you play close games against top teams like Indiana, it can only help some­where down the line. We'll be OK." 
The Hoosiers played aggres­sive man-to-man defense most of the game, cutting off the passing lanes inside and forc­ing the Irish to rely on what is supposedly their weakness-­outside shooting. But Notre Dame found the points they needed in the hot hands of soph­omore Diondra Toney, who led the Irish with 18 points, and freshman Julie Garske, who showed no fear of shooting the jumper in netting 7-of-10 shots for 14 points off the bench. 
"Diondra is an excellent player," DiStanislao said. "She's got moves, she showed she can shoot and she handles the ball well. Julie's got a bit to learn about the game, but she's got the talent to be a good col­lege basketball player. 
"(Indiana's) defense was good, but that's the way teams are going to play us. We need to get better position inside, but a lot of those problems were just the way Indiana was playing." 
After nine lead changes in the first half resulted in a halftime tie, the Hoosiers quickly opened up a six-point lead only two minutes into the final frame, at 37-31. They never looked back. 
Gavin, who runs the Irish of­fense at point guard, was sidelined with four fouls for more than three minutes of the half, further testing Notre Dame's youth on the floor. Toney, Garske, and Botham, who finally found her mark from the inside, kept Notre Dame within five, but the Irish were unable to cut the lead to less than three the rest of the way. 
The Hoosiers hit on 15-of-19 free throws down the stretch to seal the win, raising their record to 3-1. Indiana outshot the Irish by a .583 -.543 margin, with the rebounding edge going to Notre Dame, 31-25. The Irish also turned the ball over 21 times to the Hoosiers' 17.

College grid season now all Scrooged up 
'Tis the season to be jolly. 

Ho hum. Somehow I am not feeling all that jolly these days. Maybe it's because finals are fast approaching. Highly possible but highly improbable. 
It could be because it's raining in December. That can't be it because it always rains and it usually doesn't bother me. 
I think it's because several developments in the sports world have dampened my enthusiasm. Take the Reisman Trophy "race" as an example. How can anyone get excited when Vinny Testaverde all but

wrapped up the award when Miami beat Oklahoma? Brent Musburger told the national television audience during one of Testa verde's touchdown runs that they should bring out Vinny's Reisman. Evidently they did. 
Paul Palmer, Brain Bosworth, Jim Harbaugh, and the rest of college football were told they were still in the running, but that wasn't the case. Testaverde would have had to fall into a black hole to lose this year's race. And even then he would have finished a close second. 
It',s not that he didn't deserve the award. I just would like a little suspense involved when there are so many great college football players in the nation, many that television can't help as much as it helped Testaverde. 
Another disturbing situation came out of Texas. The SMU Mustangs are in deep trouble with the long arm of the NCAA and face the possibility of losing its football program to the NCAA's "death penalty." That's great because SMU has broken nearly every rule listed, and most of them at least twice. 
The problem is that Bob Hitch and Bobby Collins have resigned from their Athletic Director and Head Coach pos­itions. So while the university will suffer the consequences of its actions, and rightly so, Hitch and Collins will get away without facing the penalties. 
They can apply at other schools and rake in big bucks, build another football program by doing whatever it takes, and laugh while doing it. SMU, meanwhile, will see its football program crumble and watch the principal parties to the crimes get away without suffering. 
There's something wrong here. 
Either the NCAA should make sure that Col lins and
