Students rejoiced Saturday in Notre Dame Stadium, thankful that a recent statement by Tyrone Willingham held true following the Irish win over the Midshipmen for the 40th con­secutive year. 
"At some point, Navy will play better than Notre Dame and win the football game, but you just tell your team it does­n't have to be this year," Willingham said Saturday. 
Fans were noticeably tense before the game but showed increased enthusiasm as the quarters progressed. 
Freshman Garret Jost said

NASA official reflects on disaster 
By ANDREW THAGARD Ao;.<istant News Editor 
William Headdy, associate administrator of NASA's Office of Space Flight, offered an insider's perspective on the investigation of the space shuttle Columbia accident and reflected on his career Friday during the first installment of the Distinguished Engineering Lecture Series. 
The Naval Academy gradu-· ate and former astronaut recalled a similar disaster that occurred at the start of his career with the space agency -the explosion of the shuttle Challenger in 1986. 
"Every single day we com­mitted ourselves to making sure that Challenger would not happen again," he said. "I learned on the morning of Feb. 1 [2003] that it could happen and U had happened again." 
Space shuttle Columbia 
exploded while re-entering the atmosphere, killing all seven crew members aboard. Investigations conducted afterwards attributed the explosion to displaced foam insulation that ripped a hole in the shuttle's left wing. 
Readdy said that on that day he and other officials at NASA made a promise to the crew's family to find out what had happened, fix the problem and continue space flight. 
"Nothing good is accom­

plished without great risk and tragedy," he said. "Our agency has been defined by great tri­umphs but also great tragedies. We'll redefine our­selves by getting the shuttle flying again probably by this time next year." 
When it reentered the atmosphere, debris from Columbia were scattered with­in an area 200 miles long and four nautical miles wide,

ROTC units stand vigil on Veterans' Day 
By MAUREEN REYNOLDS 
As.<nciatc News Editor 
For one day each year, military members and Amerieans around the world pause to honor those who have served in the armed forces and remember the thou­sands who made the ultimate sac­rifice. Notre Dame is no different. 
HOTC programs will hold their annual ceremony to commemo­rate Veterans' Day on Tuesday. The guest speaker at this year's ceremony will be University President Emeritus Father Theodom llesburgh. 
"It's really simple, but it does a good job of bringing to life the sac­rifices of those who served before us," said Kevin Conley, Tri-Military Commander and member of Navy ROTC. 
The ceremony, which takes place at the Clark Memorial Fountain, ends a 24-hour vigil held at the location. 
"The vigil is four people, in half­hour shifts, standing watch for 24 hours," said Conley. 
The vigil begins at 4 p.m. today and ends 24 hours later. The cere­mony begins Thesday at 5 p.m. 
ROTC members are also await­ing a response to their request to move the Presidential Pass In Review, an annual ROTC ceremo­ny held in the spring, to an out­door location.

INSIDE COLUMN 



For the love of the game 
I love Notre Dame football. There are those of you reading this who can claim the same affection, I'm sure. I know people who have watched the games since the time they could hold themselves up in front of a TV, who have memorized individual scores, plays, players and coaches through­out the team's his­tory, and who have sat through every game they could get tickets for -beginning to end. 
Unfortunately, I cannot boast an equal dedication. I had no real expo­sure to sports growing up until my mom remarried when I was 11. Without warning, I soon found myself part of a Notre Dame family with a long lineage of alums, including my stepdad and stepbrother, a freshman at the time. Football Saturdays were considered sacred, no questions asked. Weekend after weekend, month after month, year after year, I'd sit with my stepdad in our living room -eyes fixated on the TV screen, ears tuned to the radio in the kitchen. 
When I wasn't watching the game at home, I was visiting my brother and in the Stadium every chance I got. I sat between my parents, squinting down at the field, trying to determine whether or not a run was long enough for a first down. I stood, face peeking from behind my hands, praying that a kick would be successful and yield the extra point needed to set the Irish ahead. I determined Joey Getherall my favorite player simply because of his ability to maneuver through the defense and run the ball, despite his size. 
A lot of has changed over the past 10 years, including my love of Notre Dame football -it only increases each time I step inside the Stadium, to the point where I don't think it can much more. 
For nothing else will I wake up five hours in advance, bundle up in three layers of clothing for 30-degree weather, fly through the air trusting the coordination and balance of the people hoisting me, and loose my voice screaming along with every cheer and every play on the field. 
Nowhere else will I strike up conver­sation with three guys sitting behind me dressed as unicorns and a blue monster, smile on the walk back to my apartment as the horn of a passing RV chimes the Victory March or get teary­eyed when the team pays respect to students at the end of each game. 
Unlike some of those in my section, I would never leave a game early or scream snide remarks at our team and coaches -regardless of what the season reflects. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know who played quarterback in 1972 without looking it up, nor do I understand some of the calls referees make, but I am a fan for better or for worse. I've learned a lot from Notre Dame football-showing support in return is the least I can do.

LONDON -A man attempting to walk the length of Britain naked to promote the right to go without clothes in public was convicted Friday of breaching the peace.

Moscow Reportedly Considers Kissing Ban 
MOSCOW -Don't kiss and tell -and certainly don't tell the police in Moscow, where city 

authorities are reportedly considering levying fines for public displays of affection. 
As part of an effort to "improve morals" in the Russian capital, its gov­ernment is working on an order that would prohibit kissing in subways and other public places, the newspaper Stolichnaya Vechernyaya Gazeta reported on its Web site. It said the ban was being considered at the request of police and the city's education committee.

Conley said that ROTC has requested South Quad as the location for this year's ceremony. 
"It is a good location for it to be a more visible ceremony. Our cadets work really hard throughout the year, and it's good to draw attention to the work they do," he said. 

The Student Senate recently spon­sored a petition asking for student body support to relocate the Pass in Review from Loftus to a more prominent, out­door location. The exact number of sig­natures gathered on the petition has not been reached, but the amount is considerable according to Pasquerilla West Senator Jana Lamplota. 
"We have a large amount of student support. I was surprised ... at how many people were interested in this cause," Lamplota said. 
The final decision will be made by Bill Kirk, assistant vice president for Residence Life, and the senators want to use their petition to show student body support for the Pass in Review ceremony. 

"We're right now in contact with Bill Kirk's office to set up a meeting and show him the support of the Pass in Review ceremony and support for mov­ing it to an outdoor location to get a greater student body involvement," Lamplota stated. 
A date has not been set for Kirk to make his decision, but Lamplota said she believes one will come within the next few weeks. 
There is concern that moving the ceremony to a more public venue will trigger increased protests in opposition. However, Conley believes protests should not stop the ceremony from being moved. 
"[Protesters] certainly have a right to make their opinions known, but I hope they will do it in a non-disruptive way," he said.

Israel approves prisoner swap 
JEHUSALEM -Israel's Cabinet narrowly approved a prisoner swap with Hezbollah after eight hours of anguished debate Sunday, overriding warnings that the deal could signal weakness and encourage more kidnappings of Israelis. 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon lobbied hard for the swap, which excludes Israel's most famous missing serviceman, Air Force navi­gator Hon Arad. !Vho was shot down over Lebanon 17 years ago. The vote was one of Sharon's toughest leadership tests in three years. 
The deal for the swap could still collapse -and the Lebanese guerrilla grou'p threat­ened Sunday to kidnap more Israelis if that happens. 
Under the deal, about 400 Palestinians and several dozen prisoners from Lebanon, Syria, Morocco, Sudan and Libya will be released in exchange for Israeli business­man Elhanan Tannenbaum and the bodies of three Israeli soldiers. 
Guatemalan voting violence 
GUATEMALA CITY -Guatemalans waited in long lines Sunday to vote in the second presidential election since peace accords were signed seven years ago, a tense poll that will decide the future of a former dicta­tor accused of human rights abuses. 
Fmtrs of violence were fueled when a top aide of center-lel't presidential candidate Alvaro Colom was shot in the leg and hand outside his home the night before voting. 
There were reports of problems during Sunday's balloting, including two women trampled to death as a crowd fought to enter a polling station in the northern city Chajul. Several others were injured.

Biden pushes for NATO in Iraq 
WASHINGTON -Complaining that U.S. policy on Iraq is adrift, a senior Democrat in the Senate proposed Sunday turning to NATO for troops to bring stability to the country and the United Nations to lend political legitimacy. 
The way to start such a fundamental change is for President Bush to sell the idea to European leaders at a trans­Atlantic summit, said Delaware's Joseph Biden, top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Helations Committee. 
"The U.S. is a country right now basical­ly in search of a strategy, and I think it's time to make a fundamental shift in the way in which we're going about trying to win the peace here," Biden told ABC's "This Week." 
Group urges Bishop's removal 
CONCOHD, N .I!. -A Roman Catholic reform group has petitioned the Vatican to remove New Hampshire Bishop John McCormack, calling him unfit to lead his diocese. 
The complaint, filed Oct. 28 by New Hampshire Catholics for Moral Leadership, says McCormack and Auxiliary Bishop Francis Christian lost their moral authority during the clergy sex abuse crisis and that church law requires the resignations of bishops unfit to serve, according to a draft copy of the documents sent to Home and obtained by The Associated Press.

Indiana road fatalities high 
INDIANAPOLIS-The recent deaths of sever­al Indiana teenagers in car crashes have prompted calls for mandatory driver's education classes to combat the state's high fatality rate among teen drivers. 
In 2001, 16.4 percent of all Indiana drivers involved in fatal automobile crashes were ages 16 to 20. That compares with the national aver­age of 14.6 percent. 

Indiana's teen drivers also are over-represent­ed in the percentage of accidents resulting in serious injuries, while the state is one of 17 states that do not require driver's education. 
Saudis blame deaths on al-Qaida 
17 killed, many wounded in suicide bomb attack on Arab housing complex 
Associated Press 
HIYADH, Saudi Arabia ­Saudis blamed al-Qaida militants Sunday for the suicide car bombing of a Riyadh housing complex that killed 17 people, declaring it proof of the ter­ror network's willingness to shed Muslim blood in its zeal to bring down the U.S.­linked Saudi monarchy. 
The attack late Saturday at an upscale compound for foreign workers -where mostly Arabs Jived, also wounded 122 people. The blast, not far from diplo­matic quarters and the king's main palace, left piles of rubble, hunks of twisted metal, broken glass and a large crater. 
"It's no longer an issue of terrorism for them," said Dawood al-Shirian, a Saudi analyst. "It's become a war on the regime, a war to turn the country into a new Afghanistan ruled by a Saudi-style Taliban." 
An Interior Ministry offi­cial told the official Saudi news agency late Sunday that the death toll rose to 17 -including five chil­dren -after search crews pulled six more bodies from the rubble. At least 13 were Arabs, with the others as yet unidentified, the ollicial said.

Refugee paytnents cut back 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The gov­ernment has begun cutting off payments to thousands of dis­abled and elderly refugees and people seeking asylum who missed a deadline to become American citizens. 
About 4,300 people who have been in the country at least seven years are losing monthly Supplemental Security Income checks. When that happens, they also lose eligibility for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and elderly. 
Unlike other legal immi­grants, refugees and asylum­seekers are not sponsored when they enter the United States. A sponsor agrees to be financially responsible for the immigrant until the immi­grant becomes a citizen. 
"It's not as if these people have anything to fall back on," said Adey Fisseha, policy analyst at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocate for poor immigrants and their families. "The effects are going to be devas­tating." 
Radhi Alsalami, a 50-year­old father of six from Richardson, Texas, said he does not know what he will do without the $550-a-month SSI check. He was perma­nently disabled after breaking his back and injuring his leg ma car accident in his native Iraq, which he fled during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
He came to the United States after several years in a refugee camp in Saudi Arabia. Alsalami said he has had trouble learning English and does not know it well enough to pass the citizenship test. 
"When they stop the war [in Iraq], maybe I go back," he said. "It's very hard for me here. I had business in Iraq before. Body shop. Six people work for me."

He praised the decision to form an independent outside board to investigate the Columbia accident. He said that the board produced over 3,000 pages of reports and that the agency is in the midst of sifting through the findings. 
Readdy spoke briefly of his experiences as an astronaut, describing it as "the ultimate human adventure." He is a vet­eran of three shuttle mission, including commanding a docking to the MIR Space Station. Readdy described the bravery and sense of duty that astro­nauts must possess. 
"I can tell you that every one of those crew members [aboard Columbia] was a volunteer and they would have done it on Feb. 2," he said. "It's not about us, it's about building a better future."

Malvo fights against death row 
Associated Press 

CHESAPEAKE, Va. -A theory advanced by the pros­ecution against sniper sus­pect John Allen Muhammad is being embraced by attor­neys for Lee Boyd Malvo in their efforts to keep the younger suspect off Virginia's death row. 
Malvo's trial was to begin Monday in Chesapeake, and defense lawyers plan to argue the 18-year-old is innocent by reason of insani­ty. 
Prosecutors in nearby Virginia Beach are trying to convince a jury that Muhammad, 42, exerted such control over Malvo that Muhammad should be held responsible for the shootings that killed 10 and wounded three in the Washington area last fall. 
"Our strategy is their strat­egy," Malvo lawyer Michael Arif said. "If you watch the prosecutors [in Muhammad's case] carefully, they will never put on evidence that Lee was the shooter in any of the shootings in question." 
The defendants are being tried for different killings by prosecutors from two Virginia counties. Both face the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. 
Prosecutors from Fairfax County say Malvo, who is charged with murder in the Oct. 14, 2002, death of FBI Analyst Linda Franklin, has admitted committing many of the shootings. 
His lawyers argue that he confessed only to protect Muhammad, whom he c'alled father, and that Muhammad was the mastermind of the sniper attacks.Even if that is true, the prosecutors argue, Malvo is equally responsible for the killings. They say he laughed and bragged about the shootings to interrogators and prison guards. 
During the first three weeks of Muhammad's trial, prosecutors from Prince William County combined emotional testimony from victims and victims' relatives with forensic evidence, including DNA linking Muhammad to a rifle sight found in his car. Like Malvo, Muhammad is on trial only for one killing, but to get the death penalty, the prosecu­tion needs to prove participa­tion in multiple killings or terrorizing of the public. 
For Malvo's attorneys to succeed with an insanity defense, they must convince a jury that he was so brain­washed by Muhammad that he either did not know what he was doing or could not control himself. 
It likely will be a tough sell -and risky. 
In the string of sniper attacks last fall, it remains unclear who actually pulled the trigger in each shootings.

Charity funds used for perks 
BOSTON -An investigation of charities nationwide has found that some used funds earmarked for charity to fund travel and lav­ish perks for foundation trustees, The Boston Sunday Globe reported. 
While such extravagance has infuriated shareholders of public companies in recent years, similar practices among charities have gone largely unchecked, the newspaper said. 
In one example, the Globe said it found that the DeMoss Foundation, a $444 million private charitable foundation that supports Christian organizations, spent millions in the last 20 years on three jet aircraft. 
A Bombardier long-range jet, purchased for $36 million in 2001 and operated and maintained at a cost of $1.5 million per year, logged flights to cities where the charity had no funded projects, and took family member trustee Nancy Leigh DeMoss to a funeral and a speaking engagement, the Globe reported. 
The foundation's chief financial officer, Larry H. Nelson, did not answer most of the Globe's questions about the jet, but said in an e-mail that the foundation supports many causes and projects, "most of which are overseas, many in the Third World."

IRAN 

U.S. lecturer freed in Iran 
Associated Press 
TEHRAN -Iranian authori­ties freed on Sunday an American university lecturer jailed since July on suspicion of espionage, a prosecutor's office spokesman saiq. 
Dariush Zahedi, an Iranian­born American citizen who lec­tures at University of California­Berkeley, was freed after his relatives posted bail of $250,000, Mohammad Shadabi told The Associated Press late Sunday. He gave no further details. 
A close friend of Zahedi, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the AP that the lecturer was free to leave Iran but was required to return to stand possible trial. He said Zahedi appeared healthy and fine after being released. 
Zahedi was taken to Evin prison, north of Tehran, on July 10 on suspicion of espionage activities while visiting relatives in Iran. 
Mohsen Mirdamadi, who heads the Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, charged last week that hard-line judiciary officials had refused to release Zahedi despite requests from Iran's Intelligence Ministry. 
Mirdamadi, a senior reformist lawmaker, expressed concern that Zahedi could meet the same fate as an Iranian­Canadian photojournalist, Zahra Kazemi, who was killed in Iranian custody. 
Kazemi, 54, died July 10 from fatal head injuries suffered dur­ing 77 hours of interrogation in the same prison as Zahedi. She was detained June 23 while taking photos outside Evin prison during student-led protests. 

Tehran's hard-line prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi had reportedly accused Kazemi of spying but the charges were never proven and the Iranian-Canadian didn't stand trial. 
Zahedi, a part-time lecturer at Berkeley since 2001, has written a book titled "The Iranian Revolution Then and Now: Indicators of Regime Instability" and was supposed to teach a class on war and peace in the Middle East. He also teaches at Santa Clara University. 
Boy suspected in shooting death 
Associated Press 
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -A 6-year-old boy suspected of shooting his grandfather to death with a .22-caliber rifle has a history of mental illness and attacking family mem­bers, authorities said. 
James Zbinden, 59, was found dead at his home Friday after his grandson ran into the street and flagged down a neighbor, Cole County Sheriff John Hemeyer said. 
The boy, who has not been identified, is being evaluated at a mental-health facility. 
"We believe, at this time, 
that he killed his grandfather intentionally," Hemeyer said. An autopsy Saturday showed Zbinden bled to death from a single gunshot wound near his armpit. 
Hemeyer said Zbinden and the boy were alone together Friday when the boy appar­ently found a gun that family members thought was no longer in the house. Hemeyer said it was unclear what led up to the attack. 
"This is a kid who has attacked family members before with no provocation," Hemeyer said. 
The boy had been released last Monday from a central Missouri mental-health facili­ty where he was admitted after attacking another family member, Hemeyer said. 

Past assaults have involved the boy's younger siblings and his parents, Hemeyer said. He also said the boy has used knives during previous attacks. 
Before his legal counsel halted the interview, the boy indicated to authorities that he was responsible for Zbinden's death, Hemeyer said. 
A juvenile court will handle the case. 
SOUTH KOREA 


Students, activists 
fight with riot police 
Associated Press 

SEOUL -Fire bombs lit up the evening sky in Seoul on Sunday as labor activists and students battled riot police in one of the most violent protests in years. Dozens of students and workers were injured, witnesses said. 
Police hauled away dozens of workers and students bleeding from their heads, while protesters lobbed hun­dreds of fire bombs, which exploded in flames. 
The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, which organized Sunday's protest, said at least 43 workers were hospitalized, one of them unconscious. Police reported 16 officers injured, said South Korean news agency Yonhap. 
In one clash, hundreds of police cornered a score of students in an alley and pum­meled them with plastic shields and batons. Television footage showed police stomp­ing on protesters sprawled on the pavement. 
As it grew dark, hundreds of students and workers regrouped in an eight-lane boulevard and its side alleys, chanting: "[President] Rob Moo-hyun, stop oppressing workers!" 
The protesters, wearing caps and masks to avoid being identified by police, beat their pipes on the pave-· ment in cadence, formed ranks and charged. Helmeted police packed the streets fighting back with shields. 
Acrid smoke from the fire bombs filled the streets bustling with Sunday shop­pers. Traffic was backed up for hours. 

Sunday's protest signaled a resurgence of labor unrest the government fears would drive away foreign investors. Fire bombs, once a common tool of protest in South Korea, have been absent from Seoul streets in the past 1 1/2 years. 
A crowd of protesters, esti­mated by police at 35,000 and by the labor confedera­tion at 100,000, rallied in central Seoul earlier Sunday to protest damages lawsuits that managers have filed against union leaders accused of staging illegal strikes. 
Several labor leaders have committed or attempted sui­cide in what the unions say was a protest against such lawsuits. In some cases, courts have seized part of the salaries of labor activists. 
Since many of these law­suits are coming from state utilities, activists see this trend as part of the govern­ment's labor policy. 
The government promised new legislation to make it harder for employers to sue labor unions for production losses and other financial damages caused by illegal strikes.

Japanese elections keep Koizumi in power 
Associated Press 
TOKYO -Prime Minister .lunichiro Koizumi's adminis­tration retained control of Japan's more powerful legisla­tive chamber in national elec­tions Sunday but lost ground to the largest opposition party, whose leaders called their gains "historic." 
In his first test at the polls since winning the country's top job more than two years ago, Koizumi's personal popularity brought fewer votes than some analysts had expected. They said the outcome could encour­age opponents of his no-pain­no-gain economic reforms. 
The returns also showed vot­ers are increasingly split between just two parties, sug­gesting Koizumi's Liberal Democrats can no longer count on dominating a fragmented political opposition as they have for decades. 
The Liberal Democrats and their two smaller allies saw their majority in the 480-seat lower house of Parliament shrink to 275 from 287. accord­ing to tallies by national broad­caster NHK. with the prime minister's party slipping to 237 seats from 247. 

The coalition kept a tight grip on the chamber -retaining control of all committees as well as the ability to pass legis­lation. 
"We earned a mandate for our reform path," said Shinzo Abe, secretary-general of the Liberal Democrats. "We ful­filled our responsibility." 
Some analysts. however, said 




Robinson welcomes outcasts 
Associated Press 
PETEHBOHOUGII. N.H. The Hev. V. Gene Hobinson began his ministry as the Episcopal Church's first openly gay bishop on Sunday by say­ing he wants to bring the mes­sage of God's love to "those on the margins." 
lie also said the church should speak out on issues of social justice, including the lack of access to health care for many Americans. 
"llow dare we in this country spend $87 billion on war when 44 million people have no health insurance?" he said in his sermon. "It's up to the church to lead on some of these moral issues." 
After the service at All Saints Church, where he was married to his former wife, Robinson said he hopes that people who disagree with his confirmation will remain within the Episcopal Church, instead of breaking away. 
"A church founded on unhappiness and anger is not going to go very far," he said. 
New Hampshire's Episcopalians elected Hobinson as bishop in June, and his selection was approved at the convention of the Episcopal Church USA in August. But his consecration a week ago has threatened to divide the Episcopal Church, the U.S. branch of Anglicanism. 
On Nov. 3, overseas bishops who said they represented 50 million of the world's 77 mil­lion Anglicans jointly announced they were in a "state of impaired commun­ion" with the Episcopal Church -a step short of declaring a full schism. 
In addition. conservatives 
within the U.S. church have asked the Archbishop of Canterbury, the spiritual head of the Anglican Church, to authorize a separate Anglican province for them in North America. 
In his sermon, Robinson said Jesus spent most of his time with women, taxpayers and foreigners, not with the rabbis and wealthy members of the temple. 
Jesus "looked at the religious establishment of his day and realized they had closed their eyes to those on the margins," he said. 
At a reception for the bishop following the service. church­goer Jack Jones said he was "all for" Robinson. 
"He's a real brave man, and intelligent, and if people don't want to come to church for him, let them go somewhere else," said Jones. 64. 


the party's assessment might be optimistic. The opposition gains could embolden anti-Koizumi factions within the ruling party who oppose his belt-tightening policies. It might also force the prime minister to pause before moving ahead with an unpopu­lar plan to send Japanese peacekeepers to Iraq. 
"Koizumi has great personal popularity, but this election showed that hasn't carried over to the LOP." said Jiro Yamaguchi, a professor of poli­tics at Hokkaido University. 
Yamaguchi said Koizumi could find it more difficult to advance his domestic and foreign-policy agendas. 
Japan's largest opposition party, the Democratie Party. claimed victory with its 40-scat gain, which increased its total to 177. NIIK reported. Official results arc due Monday. 
Leaders of the centrist party said they had taken a big step closer to their seven-year-old goal of building a counter­weight to Koizumi's more con­servative Liberal Democrats. 


States consider 
dropping primaries 
Associated Press 
Several states have moved to 
drop their presidential primar­
ies next year, worried about 
costs in still-tight financial 
times and wondering if the 
political exercise would serve 
any purpose. 
Some say they can't afford the millions of dollars it costs to put on an election. Others say the decisions reflect the lopsided nature of modern primaries: The front-runner gets anointed by the media and campaign donors after the first few state primaries and the rest of the primaries are formalities. 
The decisions add fuel to the argument that the primary sys­tem is in dire need of repairs. In most states forgoing a pri­mary, party-run caucuses will be used instead to choose dele­gates to the national conven­tions. 
"Fewer voters will participate because [caucuses] are more complex," said Curtis Gans. director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. State politicians are freezing out average voters. he said, because caucuses bring "lower turnout, and more advantage to whoever's organ­ized." 
Primaries usually don't get turnout much higher than 20 percent of registered voters, but they're better than caucuses. In Missouri, the 2000 primary brought 745,000 people to the polls, while the 1996 caucus brought 20,000, the state Democratic Party said. 
So far, Kansas, Colorado and Utah -all with Republican­controlled legislatures -have canceled their state-run 2004 primaries. Republican legisla­tures tried unsuccessfully to drop primaries in Arizona and Missouri, but Democratic gover­nors either vetoed the primary bill or restored the funding. 
Some Democrats complain that cutting primaries hurts

Washington Gov. Gary Locke, head of the Democratic Governors Association, is call­ing a special session to discuss scrapping his state's primary next year. 
"Why waste $7 million of scarce state money?" Locke said. Democrats in Washington state are using precinct caucus­es in February to allocate national convention delegates, making the March 2 primary pointless. 
Money worries have just exacerbated already existing doubts about the front-loaded nature of the primaries, offi­cials and experts said. 
"It started to snowball," said Leslie Reynolds, executive director of the National Association of Secretaries of State. "We're spending all this money, we don't have an impact on the process, and people aren't coming because they don't feel they have an impact." 
"Clearly. the process is flawed," said Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin. "The country is only now beginning to wake up to the fact that there's a primary. Active Democrats are only now focusing on it. Average voters aren't focused at all. And that's not good." 
Gans said the changes aren't all bad. A turn to caucuses strengthens person-to-person politics, rather than the TV­driven, mass advertising cam­paigns that mark big primary days like Super Tuesday, when 11 states vote at once. 
Galvin, a Democrat. worries instead that the anti-primary push in GOP-controlled states is an effort to stop any criticism of Bush from within his party. "They don't want a president on the ballot when people can come out and make a protest," he said. 
In some states where the gov­ernment has chosen not to hold the primary. the state Democratic Party has decided to conduct one anyway.

NAFTA, FTAA propel race to the bottoin 
cheaper labor, at any cost. 
And what, exactly, was the cost? The casualties are so numerous that space limits my ability to detail them all here. They run the gambit from last­ing environmental damage to millions of lost jobs to lessened consumer pro­tection across the continent. Awful as this seems, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, or the FTAA, takes this all to an appalling new level. 
Geographically, it dwarfs NAFTA; the FTAA envelopes the entire Western hemisphere, excepting Cuba. That adds up to 34 countries, includ­ing NAFTA's modest original three. And NAFTA was the most far-reaching treaty of its kind ever negotiated. 
There's far more than geography here, of course. Foremost among NAFTA's wounded are working fami­lies. The treaty's vain, unenforceable labor protections were useless to workers seeking to organize. In fact, a Cornell study revealed that, since NAFTA began, most manufacturing and communication companies con­fronted with unionizing workers threatened to move their jobs abroad. 
While NAFTA helped pave the way for workers' "race to the bottom," the FTAA will accelerate it. With the clo­sure of 350 of Mexico's infamous maquiladoras, 280,000 jobs have been lost -corporations found cheaper labor elsewhere. As big business struggles to keep costs down, the world's poorest nations-Haiti and Guatemala, for example -will be pit­ted against each other. In this "race to the bottom," the only winner is the corporation. 
But jobs aren't the only victim. The neoliberal brand of free trade -NAFTA's foundation -has wrought widespread environmental devasta­tion. To pay down IMF/World Bank debt, countries in the Third World have deforested their own lands and overfished their own waters. For instance, in the Mexican state of Guerrero, 40 percent of the forests have been wiped out in the last eight years, while widespread clear-cutting has led both to soil erosion and habi­tat destruction. 
Big business cares as much for the environment as it does for its own consumers. Impossible, you say? NAFTA's obscure (but infamous) Chapter 11 provision allows corpora­tions to sue for compensation if they think a government action threatened their bottom line. Enforcing public health and safety laws, in effect, becomes actionable. In fact, one of these corporate lawsuits seeks to keep MTBE, a gas additive poisoning groundwater in California, in use. This absurd provision is set to resurface in the FTAA. 
Perhaps all of this is new to you, which would hardly be an accident. The FTAA talks have been held behind closed doors, despite clamor for open discussion and development of trade policy. By muffling citizen input ­which, despite being accepted, Jacks a process for integration -big business stifles public dissent. It truly is big business behind the FTAA: While citi­zens are left out of the talks, legions of corporate reps help write our trade policy. 
Such an obvious catastrophe should not be repeated, let alone expanded. Yet that is what is about to happen. The FTAA talks began about a decade ago; member countries plan to con­clude them by early 2005. This November, on the 20th and 21st, the Fifth Ministerial will take place in Miami, as countries will seek agree­ment on an advanced draft of the FTAA. Do your part-writing letters, driving down to protest, anything -to stop this panorama of injustice from becoming our reality.

another is that inequality, both within and between countries, Straight, No has risen since Chaser NAFTA's enact­ment. 
Yet there are still those that persist, unethically and illogically, in touting NAFTA as a triumph of free trade. Their favorite stat: The world has seen rapid economic growth over the past four decades. But this is what sets apart their peculiar, neoliberal brand of free trade. Because while there is indeed this recorded growth, inequality has increased, suggesting that most of this growth was confined to the portfolios of the upper class. 
I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, but I'm sure most of you have heard of it. Shrewd politicians often bandy the acronym about to curry favor either with corporate interests or with labor organizations-that is, big business versus the average worker. That makes talking about trade policy quite a tightrope act; it also makes it hard to tell which version is true. But as dull as trade policy may sound, it is nevertheless enormously important to everyone-not just blue-collar work­ers, not just career politicians. The broad catastrophe of NAFTA is proof that this is so. 
Not too long ago, a slew of politi­cians promised working families that NAFTA -which included the United States, Mexico and Canada-would bring a host of rewards: better condi­tions, better wages, more jobs and so on. But this was all a lie; big business was the big beneficiary. As always, the big business chased higher profits and

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Students, faculty concerned -with University education 
Students aren't in need ofa change 
Professors and administrators have boon complaining that there is not enough interest among under­graduates in research, going to graduate school and otherwise becoming part of academia. Particularly notice the repetition of the phrase "among Notre Dame's peer schools" in the articles "cover­ing" this issue. 
Since when was being different bad (recall the diversity issue)? What other schools are on this list, and are they committed to a Division I sports program as well? As much as the administration would like to forget about sports, they are there. 
Also, on limiting the business majors, it's obviously more than a monetary problem when a Vice President and Provost, John Affleck­Graves, is talking about whether this program fits the mission state­ment and overall goals. No one would dare to attack the Engineering or Architecture school for not contributing to a liberal arts education. 
The truth of the matter is that in the eyes of the administration, the business school lets students off easily and does not bring adequate prestige and national reputation for research to a University that is too much seen as a football power­house. They would much rather put the money that is somehow not going to the business school towards financing research that will never reach undergraduates and will benefit them, if at all, only indi­rectly. 
I would like to know how many students chose Notre Dame because of the amazing research opportuni­ties or even because of the wonder­ful professors in their intended major. There are two ways to look at this issue. 
In the words of Professor Norton, "It's how you look and what your athletic ability is. The idea that being smart is cool would have to take hold." I think Professor Nichols is much closer when he says, "They [Notre Dame students] are curious about the world, regardless of their major. Notre Dame students are bright, and bright students are curi­ous about life issues." 
It's time for Notre Dame adminis­trators to stop worrying about appearances and statistics, as seems to be their entire job lately, to lure in more academia-minded stu­dents (because "students are unin­terested in becoming professors") and start worrying about how to serve the students that are already here. 
Tom Mahoney freshman Stanford Hall Nov. 6 


Administration and faculty should work with students 
If Dean Roche and the faculty are serious about encouraging undergradu­ate passion about ideas and academics, we need to ask the students them­selves how to make this happen. Last week, after reading the Observer arti­cles on this topic, I asked my students how they saw this problem. 
They told me they would love to delve into the subjects that most interest them. That's what they expected when they arrived here. Yet they soon learned this would be impossible -that the curriculum was structured to preclude passionate intellectual curiosity. Fourteen courses of University requirements forced them to postpone their own interests until their junior year. Five demanding courses per semester required them to study only for the test. Indeed, my students complained that they would love to read for interest in a lot of their coursework, but didn't have the time. 
Above all, they pointed out that it didn't make sense for faculty and deans to complain that students were not intellectually engaged while not giving them a stronger voice in their own education. Notre Dame students are smart, creative, gifted. Had they not cared about ideas in high school, they wouldn't have been admitted to Notre Dame. 
The only way to solve the problem of intellectual engagement is for the administration and faculty to work with the students. They need to be repre­sented on the curriculum committees and similar venues. 
Working together, faculty and students could develop creative solutions to encourage intellectual engagement. For example, faculty teaching upper­division courses could offer extra "research tutorials" which would add one or two credits to normal three-credit courses, allowing interested students to take four, rather than live, courses in a semester. Or students could be encouraged to form groups and work with a professor or grad student to develop a course that would both interest them and fulfill a University requirement. Developing the syllabus could be part of the coursework. 
Notre Dame culture can change. Academic engagement can become the rule. For this to happen, the administration must systematically work with and listen to the undergraduates themselves. 
Gail Bederman Associate Professor of History Nov. 8 

Professors need to look to themselves for answers 
As students enrolled primarily in the Mendoza College of Business, as well as ones privileged enough to have been able to pursue a second major in political science, we were both shocked and appalled to read Monday's Observer articles entitled "Professors question academic engagement" and "Business degrees worry A&L faculty." 
To "estimate" that the majority of students on this campus read only assigned portions of text because all it cares about is grades is ridiculous. Not a day goes by when the two of us are not actively engaged in various conversations outside of class that directly involve principles of finance, accounting and politics. 
Furthermore, the fact that office hours are often poorly attended may stem from two more specific circum­stances than a need only at exam time: One, professors often come across as disdaining office hours as a chore; and two, professors don't make themselves appear approach­able through the course of class lec­tures and discussions. We speak from experience and say that our tendency to visit our professors outside of class is directly related with their ability to make our studies engaging in ways we had not previously real­ized they could be. 
It is our opinion that this engage­ment has taken place far more fre­quently in our studies of business than in our other courses. 
Whether it be because of the size of the class and the nature of the sub­jects studied, or how the professors and students alike go about studying and engaging our­selves in the subjects (i.e., group assign­ments, a focus on practical applica­
tion of theory and 
c
an emphasis on 
extracurricular 
involvement in · 
activities like 
the Student 
International 
Business 
Council), we 
can't neces­
sarily say. What we 
can say, 
though, is 
that our 
business 
education has consis­
tently chal­
lenged us over 
the last few 
years to learn 
and to want to 
learn, much to the 
same effect that any 
of our liberal arts class­
es has. It just adds to the 
process of learning a number 
of ways to fruitfully apply the value 
in what we learned to a discipline 

that often is connected to a specific . job. There is nothing inherently wrong in this. To paraphrase William Nichols' quote from the second referenced article, as busi­
ness majors, we are every bit as curious 
about the world as our coun­terparts 
in the College of Arts 
and 
Letters; we just may more readily 
analyze it through 

a differ­ent set of lenses. What we are trying to say is that no person -facul­ty or student, alumni or friend ­associated with this great University should be worried about any type of degree pursued by the students here. 
Part of what has made Notre Dame a great academic institution is that all students are exposed to a number of liberal arts courses during their four years here. 
It is our opinion that faculty and students alike should constantly look to each other for new ideas on what it means to learn and how to do it. 
If there is one thing the University does not do well, it may actually be exposing students to courses outside of the College of Arts and Letters. Maybe it should be required of Arts and Letters majors to take a basic accounting course or of business majors to take a course in mechanics or architecture. 
By remembering we are all in this together, we believe we can better offer something positive and eye­opening to the entire campus, regardless of academic pursuit. 
In looking to each other for innova­tive ideas, and to themselves for a more engaging pedagogical model. the various faculty members on this campus, who look down upon the studies of business, may actually learn something applicable to the life inside and outside their own class­rooms.

at we wear 
Look around you. Everywhere you turn you see the same thing: Abercrombie, J.Crew, Banana Republic -preps. Notre Dame is known for its homoge­nous mixture of stu­dents, and that isn't in refer­ence to race or religion -lam talking about preppy dressers. 
At our school, students look far too much alike. A feature in W Magazine said that "Notre Dame's student body is for the most part closely knit, homogenous and conservative." The Jack of diversity alluded to is pri­marily diversity within the closets of the student body. 
When I walk down the sidewalks of this campus, I feel like I am looking at the pages of a J.Crew magazine. People are either wearing articles of clothing from the above-listed stores, or are sporting the ever-popular bookstore brand. Although many students feel that the bookstore is the most popu­lar pseudo-brand name that fills their closets, many say that it is also a sure-fire way to know that they will fit in. 
I can remember a game we used to play at the dining hall where we actually counted the amount of peo­ple wearing Notre Dame apparel. We have yet to find a table of students where at least one person wasn't wearing Notre Dame appar­el. To be honest, usually the odd man out is the one who isn't wearing any Notre Dame clothes. So let's face it, the bookstore is popular. It is essentially a mini-trip to the mall that is only 40 steps away, and well, it reminds a Jot of people of Nordstroms due to its size and splendor. 
Female students also fre­quent a new trends store in the local area entitled Inspire Me. The store recently began advertising in The Observer, and employees say that sales have rocketed since the printing of the advertise­ment. 
"I used to always go to the mall -I suppose I still do, but Inspire Me has nice, preppy clothes that are also stylish and fun," said junior Brin Anderson. "It's not a big change from what the girls usually wear here, it's just a step up from the usual Abercrombie and Banana [Republic]." 

The men of Notre Dame have a bit less of a choice selection, but they certainly also appear to be less picky. No offense boys, but we don't expect much of a change from the typical Notre Dame T-shirts and then Abercrombie pants. Throw some Polo into the mix, and you have the Notre Dame equation figured out. 
I have actually talked to students from outside Notre Dame who have made jokes about the way our student body looked. Some referred the pro-NO wardrobes as cult-like, although they were more freaked out by the waffle logo in the dining hall. It is funny how people comment on about our rack of diversity in fashion yet still say that we still display a relatively good fashion sense. 
I say who cares if we are fashion-forward? In my opinion, homogeneity is a sign of unity. We have other things to concern ourselves with outside of fall's newest trends. Although the article in w magazine pointed out that we "channeled their competitive streaks into aca­demics, and athletics and a deep-seated camaraderie that is evident on campus," there is nothing wrong with that. 
Although the campus lacks fashion diversity, the mix appears to work for most students. No one appears extremely out of place, and it appears as though most students understood what they were getting into when arriving on Notre Dame's campus. 
There is so much pride and such an aura of close­ness among the students that this whole issue of dressing the same is not something to be ashamed of, but something to be proud of. So we are preps, big deal. We are still students of the University of Notre Dame. In my eyes, this is a great place to be whether we are fash­ion forward, diverse, or backwards. We actually have it better than those schools considered to be fashion forward. We are part of the Notre Dame family, the very preppy and homog­enous Notre Dame family.

A look into the life of U2's Bono 
By BECCA SAUNDERS 
Scene Writer 

It is hard to imagine a Notre Dame student who doesn't know the name "Bono." It is, in fact, difficult to imagine many people who do not know who Bono is. Nearly everyone in the world knows the name and knows the band U2, but how many really know the man himself? 
In the biography of Bono by Laura Jackson called Bono: His life, music, and passions, Jackson takes the reader on a journey from the slums of Dublin to the glitz of world-wide tours. Through it all, the reader steals a glimpse of the real character of Bono: the constantly changing artist, the energetic performer, the devoted Christian and the untiring human rights activist. Bono is a man who refuses to be defined as any one thing, and the course of his life explains much of where his vigor comes from. 
Born in May 1960 in Dublin, Bono's real name is Paul David Hewson. A very Christian name, Bono was born to a Protestant mother and a Catholic father, a very unique couple for that time in Ireland. Jackson describes his parents as refusing "to allow the intense rivalry in Ireland between these religions to keep them apart. Bravely, they mar­ried -in the teeth of intense opposition." 
Bono was brought up primarily Protestant, going to church with his mother, which was untradi­tional at that time, as children were generally raised in the faith of their father. However, the unconventional nature of this arrangement is precisely why the Hewsons chose this path for their children, Bono and his older brother. As his father would wait for the rest of his family outside of the Church of Ireland after he attended Mass, Bono's view of religion was deeply affected. Jackson explains that, "This seg­regation would inflame Bono and laid foundations for his views on the need to pursue integration and greater tolerance of different faiths." Bono never quite classi­fied himself as Protestant or Catholic. Jackson writes that, later in life, Bono felt "whether to class himself as Protestant or Catholic ... 'I always felt like I was sitting on the fence."' 
Childhood was not necessarily easy for Bono. With a stiff sibling rivalry and the death of his beloved mother during high school, Bono became a rebel of his own accord. · 
Bono attended one of the first and only non-denominational high schools at the time in Dublin with the other future members of the band U2. The band started almost by chance when drummer Larry Mullins Jr. posted a note on the high school bulletin board calling any potential band mem­hers to a meeting at his house. The band that is today U2 is who showed up. 
Adam Clayton, the bassist, and Dave Evans, now known universally as "The Edge," were probably initially the most tal­ented, along with Larry Mullins Jr. Overall, Bono "did not exhibit any particularly out­standing musical tal­ent, despite harboring aspirations to become the band's lead gui­tarist." The very name Bono is a shorted ver­sion of the Latin phrase "Bono Vox," which means good voice. This nickname was more of a joke when first given to Bono, who originially hated the nickname. 
No one could deny, however, that Bono exuded "an irresistible verve and optimism, as well as a confident theatrical flair," and that made him a natu­ral choice as front man and, con­sequently, lead singer. The inter­nationally acclaimed band thus began as four questionable musi­cians with enthusiasm. 
Bono has always been known for his strong lyric-writing abili­ties. Songwriting is a very serious undertaking for Bono, and, in ref­erence to his beginning songs, "his intention lyrically was to promote independence and free­dom of thought, and to reject glossy, stereotyped media imagery. He also wanted to explore serious questions of spiri­tuality -a subject avoided by most rock lyricists but one that Bono believed that teenagers did think about." 
The band's tendency to write songs that are thematically Christian has caused increasing debate about whether or not U2 is a Christian band. The band members themselves are self­proclaimed believers, and one need not look far to find strong Christian ideas on any of their albums. Bono has consistently been very vocal about his beliefs, at one time coming out against the "commercialization of reli­gious faith" saying, "I believe it is tarnishing something really beautiful." 
One should not get the impres­sion, however, that Bono is trying to evangelize his crowds, Jackson explains. 
"Invariably, U2's answer was that they just hoped their songs might make people stop and con­sider exactly what was going on around them," Jackson writes. 
Even more importantly than talking about religion, Bono has spent his life encouraging living a life based on Christian ideals. Jackson takes the reader through the timeline of U2's history of social justice. U2 has been instru­mental in supporting the unifica­tion of Ireland and in raising awareness of the issues in Third World countries, especially those in Central America and Africa. 


U2's "Pop-Mart" tour to Sarajevo is said to have marked the "return to normalcy" in Sarajevo, and Larry Mullins, Jr. calls it the best concert in the his­tory of. Bono has served as the international spokesperson for Jubilee 2000, an organization committed to aiding in Third World debt relief, and has begun his own organization called DATA (Debt, AIDS, Trade and Africa). Bono, himself, believes social jus­tice to be at the core of what Christianity is truly about. 
Bono is a man of many faces but one heart. In his biography, Laura Jackson tries to introduce all sides and aspects of Bono. The title holds true to the content, as the reader is educated on "his life, music and passions." While this novel may not initially appeal to the light-of-heart U2 fans, as the life of Bono unfolds, the read­er meets a man who is intriguing on his own -a world-famous rock star who values family, friends, Christianity and social justice. 
Jackson ends the chronicle best: "He is a genuine pacifist, yet he is capable of a militant atti­tude ... and it is this central dual­ity, right at the core of Bono's personality, that ultimately intrigues. Bono is, and will always remain, unique."

Irish had just beat top-ranked Florida State. But "pandemonium on the field" doesn't have the same ring when Notre Dame got its third win of the season in November against lowly Navy-and it needed a field goal with time run­ning out to do so . 
Still, in a season so devoid of memo­rable moments, please excuse the players and coaches for grabbing hold of one when it finally occurs. 
There stood Tyrone Willingham, his scowl for post-game NBC interviews of the past three home games replaced by a broad grin. There jumped the players, prancing around the field in levels of excitement nor­mally reserved for visiting teams who tear chunks of turf out of Notre Dame Stadium. There roared the fans, who would have missed a thrilling ending had they left this game early. 
Someone listening to the roars out­side the stadium might have thought the Irish were playing for a BCS bowl instead of a BS bowl. 
But if an ecstatic celebration after beating a team for the 40th straight time helps the Irish get back on track, then so be it. 

"We had to issue a statement," Willingham said, "that we are here to stay, that we aren't going away and we aren't going to fade." 
That declaration was provided by senior running back Julius Jones, who, for the second time this season, broke the 200-yard barrier in a game. In fact, without Jones-who carried the Irish through wins against Washington State, Pittsburgh and now Navy-Notre Dame could easily be 0-9. 
The proclam..ation was also made by a defense whose failure to shut down the option in the second half nearly sent the 2003 Notre Dame team into the land of infamous teams. But with the game on the line and Navy driv­ing, the defense discovered its cajones and forced the Midshipmen to punt. 
It still took a walk-on kicker to pro­vide the exclamation point. 
Sure, D.J. Fitzpatrick had jogged onto the field once before with the game on the line and a handful of ticks left on the clock. But he was a freshman kicker at Marian High School in Mishawaka, kicking for the win in a homecoming game against Washington. "I've been there before, just not at this magnitude," he said. 
In high school, Fitzpatrick buried the kick. But how would he do with a 39-year-old streak hanging in the bal­ance? "Get ready, No. 19, they're gonna need you!" an inebriated fan screamed as Notre Dame started driving down the field to set up Fitzpatrick. 
Twice, Navy called timeout to ice a kicker who had already missed two field goals and sent kickoffs out of bounds. But each time, Fitzpatrick jogged over to the Notre Dame side of the field, stayed by himself and tried to maintain his focus. 
When he ran onto the field for the third time, he lined up behind high school teammate Matt Krueger, got a perfect snap, a perfect hold-and watched the ball wobble 40 yards toward the uprights. 
Navy's Josh Smith would say later that he got the tips of three fmgers on the ball and ifhe got four, Notre Dame probably would have slid back into the pot and found itself in hot water. 
"I hit it great, but the rotation off the ball told me it had to be blocked," Fitzpatrick said. "I didn't know ifit was going in or not. Those were prob­ably the longest two to three seconds in my life." 
Fitzpatrick waited. And waited. And waited. And as flashbulbs popped across the Stadium, he vaguely saw two officials extend their arms verti­cally-something Fitzpatrick didn't have time to do because his team­mates mobbed him. 
"It went in," he grinned. "I don't know by how much, but it went in." 
So Fitzpatrick celebrated, his team­mates celebrated, his fans celebrated, his coach celebrated. And when the celebration died down, Saturday's win showed there may be hope for sal­vaging this season -a season that began with Notre Dame running through a buzz saw of ranked teams and a season that ends against teams Notre Dame should be able to beat. 
"Hey guys," NBC sideline reporter Lewis Johnson told Jones and Fitzpatrick as they waited for a post­game interview, "you can smile now."

NFL 
Cowboys struggle, still manage to knock off Bills 
Associated Press 
IRVING, Texas Bill Parcells certainly has taught the Dallas Cowboys how to win. Next comes how to look good when doing it. 
The Cowboys won ugly again Sunday, beating the Buffalo Bills 10-6 despite moving only 51 yards on their two scoring drives and going more than 15 minutes between first downs in the second half. 
The result is what matters, though, and Dallas (7 -2) remains tied with Carolina for the best record in the NFC. 
The Cowboys have won seven of eight and are 2-0 in the five-game stretch Parcells has dubbed "Showtime." 
The rub is that Dallas has looked more ready for vaude­ville than Broadway the last two games. 
The Cowboys had to over­come four turnovers, three in the first six plays, to beat Washington. 
Chiefs 41, Browns 20 
Sometimes only great plays stop great players. . 
Chris Crocker avoided a block and made a desperation ankle tackle of Dante Hall on Sunday, keeping the NFL's most electrifying player from uncorking a record-breaking fifth touchdown return. 
Hall's return ended up going 77 yards and set up Morten Andersen's 29-yard field goal, paving the way for a 41-20 vic­tory over Cleveland that kept Kansas City (9-0) the NFL's only unbeaten team. 
''I'm thinking 'Oh, my God.' That's literally what I'm think­ing," said Crocker. "Somehow I managed to get him on the ground." 
Said Hall, "You've got to take your hat off to him. He played it well." 
Panthers 27, Bucs 24 
The Carolina Panthers refused to talk any trash before their game against Tampa Bay. After beating the Super Bowl champions for the second time this season, they wouldn't shut up. 
Jake Delhomme's 5-yard touchdown pass to Steve Smith with 1:06 remaining overcame a late Tampa Bay rally and lift­ed the Panthers to a 27-24 vic­tory in the matchup of two suddenly bitter rivals. 
The victory silenced the Bucs (4-5) and dropped them three games behind the Panthers (7­
2) in the NFC South and Carolina holds the tiebreaker. 
''I'll say it: I can't stand them," said defensive tackle Kris Jenkins. 
"When they pull on their red and we pull on our blue, it's like the Bloods and the Crips. They talk too much, they want to flash 'I'm a superstar.' Well, now that talk don't mean noth­ing. 
Jaguars 28, Colts 23 
Fred Taylor ran the ball Sunday as well as he ran his mouth all week. 
The result for Jacksonville was a surprising 28-23 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, highlighted by Taylor's game­winning, 32-yard touchdown run with 1 :08 left. 
Taylor finished with a sea­son-high 152 yards and deliv­ered on his promise to "pun­ish" Colts safety Mike Doss, whose rough play in the sea­son's first meeting prompted Taylor to send out this mid-week warning: ''I'm going to punish him. If he hits me, fine, but if I catch him, believe me, I'm going to get the better shot." 


As it turned out, Taylor's trash talk was the perfect motivation for the Jaguars (2­7), a struggling team in desper­ate need of a spark. 
Jets 27, Raiders 24 
LaMont Jordan reminded the New York Jets at halftime just how devastating a loss would be. 
"One team's season is going to end today," Jordan told them, "and it's not going to be ours." 
Jordan took his own words to heart, igniting a remarkable rally when he ran 2 yards for a touchdown with 14:20 left. The Jets kept coming, overcame an 11-point deficit and beat the Oakland Raiders 27-24 in over­time Sunday. 
Chad Pennington threw a 3­yard scoring pass to Jerald Sowell with 1:09 left and com­pleted the 2-point conversion pass to Anthony Becht to force OT. Then Doug Brien kicked a 38-yard field goal in the extra period. 
"This is special," Pennington said. "The Raiders had a blue­print to beat us, and everyone counted us out. But we won!" 
10 months ago that propelled Oakland into the AFC champi­onship game. 
Falcons 27, Giants 7 
The Atlanta Falcons got Dan Reeves his 200th win on a day the New York Giants may have put coach Jim Fassel's job in jeopardy. 
Warrick Dunn ran for 178 yards, including a 45-yard touchdown, and the Falcons snapped a seven-game losing streak by defeating the mistake­prone Giants 27-7. 
"It's great," Reeves said after becoming the sixth NFL coach to reach the 200-win plateau (200-171-2). "But when you've lost seven in a row it was all about trying get them win No. 2. 
''I'm toward the end of my career," Reeves said after the Falcons (2-7) won for the first time since the opening weekend of the season. "A lot of these guys are just starting. They need to win."

SMC SOCCER 
Belles spoil Calvin's chances for playoffs 
By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's soccer team linished in a 4-4 double overtime tie to crush Calvin College's hopes for a playofl' birth. 
"We were hoping to spoil Calvin's season," Belles captain Jen Concannon said. 
Calvin was tied with Hope College in the MIAA standings and could not afl'ord a tic or loss against Saint Mary's last Saturday afternoon if they expected to see life in the play­oil's. 
Saint Mary's began the rivalry with an impressive 3-0 lead in the lirst half. 
Freshman Colleen Courtney contributed the first two goals, followed by a goal from class-mate Ashley Hinton. 

"By starting with a 3-0 lead against the top team in the con­ference, we should have been one of the top teams," Belles sophomore Katie Noble said. 
"We usually come out strong, but it is always the last 10 min­utes of the half or the game that we slow down." 
Unfortunately for Saint Mary's, Calvin was able to capitalize and tie the score 3-3 to end the half. 
In the second half, both teams could only respond with a goal to make the linal score in regula­tion 4-4 and send the game into overtime. 
Saint Mary's was unable to score in overtime and had to set­tle for the 4-4 tie against the first place team. 
Despite the tie, the Belles felt it was a hard fought game and were glad to end the season on a better note than they had planned. Although the defense has been the major highlight for the Belles all season, the offense heavily contributed to last Saturday's tie. 
"The forwards are what helped the team," Concannon said.

ND WOMEN'S SOCCER 
Two selected as Herm.ann finalists 
Special To The Observer 

Two Notre Dame women's soccer players have been select­ed as final candidates for the Missouri Athletic Club's Hermann Trophy, the official National Soccer Coaches Association of America Player of the Year award for Division I players. The 15 candidates were selected by a nominating com­mittee of Division I college coaches. 
Top-ranked North Carolina is the only other team with multi­ple players on the list -senior defender Cat Reddick and soph­omore midfielders Lori Chalupny and Lindsay Tarpley. 
The other candidates include: senior forwards Chrissie Abbott (West Virginia) and Veronica Zepeda (Santa Clara); senior midfielders Joanna Lohman (Penn State) and Aleshia Rose (BYU); UCLA senior defender Nandi Pryce; Texas junior for­ward Kelly Wilson; Tennessee junior defender Keely Dowling; Stanford junior goalkeeper Nicole Barnhardt; and sopho­more forwards Caroline Smith (Kansas) and Tiffany Weimer (Penn State). 
Tancredi -who can apply for a fifth year of eligibility-would be considered one of the favorites for the 2004 award. 
The winners will be deter­mined in voting by Division I coaches and will be announced in December at the men's College Cup. 

The men's and women's win­ners will be honored at an awards banquet at the Missouri Athletic Club in St. Louis on Friday, Jan. 9, and presented with the prestigious crystal soc­cer ball trophy. 
Notre Dame has played against three of the candidates this season, defeating Zepeda's Santa Clara squad and Abbott's West Virginia team while play­ing to a tie against Barnhardt and Stanford. 
Tancredi -the 2003 Big East Conference Defensive Player of the Year-and four-time all-Big East selection Warner have played central roles for the 2003 team that is ranked third in the nation while standing one win shy of the program's eighth 20­win season (19-2-1). 
The Irish rank near the top of the national leaders in scoring.

BOXING 


Associated Press 
LAS VEGAS -Roy Jones Jr. likes to lay claim to being the greatest boxer of his time. For one fight, at least, he certainly wasn't the smartest. 
A decision to drop down in weight to fight a grudge match against Antonio Tarver very near­ly cost Jones the first real defeat of his brilliant career. 
He escaped to fight another day -possibly against Mike Tyson -but Jones was slow, sluggish and a shell of his former self. 
Entering the ring 

Saturday night as the unquestioned master of his art, Jones left with one big question not answered: Did he look so bad because he had to lose so much weight, or is he suddenly an old fighter at the age of 34? 
Not surprisingly, Jones blames the weight. 
"It was a tough task to come down from 200 pounds to 175, tougher than I thought it would be," Jones said. 
"With everything out of me, though, you still saw the heart of a champion out there." 
That heart came out in the final two rounds, 
when Jones finally started throwing punches in com­binations and got the best of a tiring Tarver. 
But for much of the fight he was beaten to the punch, pummeled on the ropes and treated ­somewhat shockingly ­like just another ordinary fighter. He still won by comfortable margins on two scorecards and was even on a third, but it might have been his repu­tation more than his per­formance that saved the night for Jones. 
The Associated Press scored the fight even, 114-114. 
"They took the decision, but I'll be back," Tarver said. "I didn't feel like a loser." 
He didn't look like one, either. 
At the press conference after the fight, in fact, it was hard to tell who won and who lost. 
Jones, his face puffy and marked, talked softly about weight problems and how he gutted this one out. 
Tarver, meanwhile, was unmarked and almost giddy as he basked in the knowledge he came closer than any of Jones' previ­ous 49 opponents to actu­ally beating him fair and square. 
IN BRIEF 

Panthers fire coach Keenan; 
Dudley takes over 

SUNRISE, Fla.-Mike Keenan was supposed to change the Florida Panthers' fortunes. When he couldn't, they changed coaches. 
Keenan's two-year coaching stint with the Panthers ended Sunday, one day after general manager Rick Dudley told owner Alan Cohen that the move was necessary. Dudley will take over as coach on an interim basis, and said he has already contacted candi­dates for the permanent job. 
"It was done simply because we felt the potential of this team was such that we wanted to play at a maximum or optimal level," Dudley said Sunday. "We did not feel we were doing that at this time." 
Mauresmo spoils all-Belgian 
final 

LOS ANGELES -Kim Clijsters ral­lied from a set down and a 3-2 deficit in the third to beat an injured Jennifer Capriati 4-6, 6-3, 6-0 in Sunday's semifmals of the WTA Championships. 
Clijsters won the final 10 games in advancing to Monday's night final for the second straight year. The winner receives $1,000,030, the biggest pay­check in women's tennis. The extra $30 represents the WTA Tour's 30th anniversary. 
Clijsters will play fourth-seeded Amelie Mauresmo, who upset No. 2 seed Justine Henin-Hardenne 7-6 (2), 3-6, 6-3. Mauresmo spoiled an all­Belgian final between Clijsters, the outgoing No. 1 player, and Henin­Hardenne, who will succeed her coun­trywoman when the year's final rank­ings are released Tuesday. 
Mauresmo needed help reaching the semifinals. Elena Dementieva upset Chanda Rubin in three sets Saturday, which gave Rubin, Dementieva and Mauresmo the same 1-2 records in round-robin play. But Mauresmo advanced because she won a set in each of her two losses. 
Campbell, Singh, Woods all 
come away winners HOUSTON -The PGA Tour player of the year race is still up in the air. Chad Campbell made sure the Tour Championship was no contest. 
Campbell blew away his challengers with a flawless front nine to build a five-shot lead, then cruised to his first victory in the PGA Tour's version of the All-Star game. 
"I think you get a little bit more respect once you get your first win, especially coming at a tournament like this," Campbell said after closing with a 3-under 68 for a three-shot victory over Charles Howell III. 
Campbell, whose 16-under 268 broke the tournament scoring record in relation to par, became the first player to make the Tour Championship his first victory. 
Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh could­n't settle the PGA Tour player of the year race at Champions Golf Club, so now they hit the campaign trail.

Goaltender David Brown's shutout streak was also snapped Saturday, as Michigan State's Jim Slater beat him just 
7:12 into the game. Brown's streak ended at 193 minutes, 27 seconds, a Notre Dame record. 
Friday, the two teams started with a scoreless first period before Michigan State jumped on the scoreboard first with just 41 seconds left in the second period. 
Defenseman A.J. Thelen, just a 17-year-old freshman, one­timed a shot past Irish goalie Morgan Cey's left shoulder for his third goal of the season. 
Down 1-0, Notre Dame had an excellent shot to get back in the game with a power play about halfway through the final peri­od. A shorthanded goal by Adam Nightingale, however, all but killed the potential Irish momentum. 
"The short-handed goal was a critical point of the game," Irish head coach Dave Poulin said.

"Michigan State doesn't give up many chances, and when they do, you have to take advan­tage." 
Saturday's game looked like it would be a similar win for the Spartans, with Michigan State taking a 3-1 lead before two Irish power play goals in the third came back to tie it. Notre Dame then saw a potential game-winning goal waved off with just seven seconds left in the game.

Martin would help the Irish score a big insurance goal14 minutes later. 
The senior midfielder sent in a high arching cross from the right side, and Detter managed to time his run to the left post perfectly, catch­ing the cross with a header that beat Schuerman. 
"We call [Justin] the 'lighthouse' because he has a huge wide head," Martin joked. "We tell him whenever the ball's on the wing to get into the box. I don't typically play out on the wing, but I found myself out there several times. 
"I had my head up and saw him running toward the post, and I knew if I could float it over the first defender he could clearly beat the goalie." 
Schuerman made three saves in the loss, while Sawyer needed to make only two for his 11th shutout of the season. 
The Irish now advance to play Providence in the next round. The No. 7 seed Friars shocked No. 2 Virginia Tech with a 4-2 advantage on penalty kicks after the two teams battled to a 2-2 tie in through overtime. The Irish defeat­ed the Friars on the road 2-0 on Oct. 22.

Chemistry proves the key for Irish 
Come on, Irish. Just try it. Everybody's doing it. 
It's the trend in the quarterfinals of the men's soccer Big East conference 
tournament­games stay close, regardless of seed and venue, and the outcome is decided by a spectacular individual effort at the end. 
St. John's is doing it. The top-seeded 

Hed Storm nicked  Pat Leonard  
No. 8 Villanova by a score of just 2-1.  Sports Writer  
Hutgers is doing  

it. The No. 4 Scarlet Knights needed 94 minutes before they could put away No.5 Seton Hall, 1-0, with an overtime goal from a freshman defenseman. 
Virginia Tech even took it a step fur­ther. The No. 2 Hokies were upset in penalty kicks by No. 7 Providence. 
So why isn't Notre Dame following the trend? Why did the Irish. depleted in the midfield by injury, find it neces­sary to control play for the majority of the Connecticut game Sunday in a convincing, 2-0 win? 
The answer is team chemistry. While coaches and players on any given team will talk about it, the coop­eration of 11 men on a soccer field often does not click the way it should. On Sunday, that happened for Irish coach Bobby Clark and the Notre Dame squad. The Irish eliminated the Huskies from the tournament that they will be hosting in Storrs, Conn. this weekend. 

"This was as complete a perform­ance as we've had this year," Clark said. "We had a lot of good perform­ances, but 1just thought we really got a hold of the game." 
They sure did. 
Notre Dame outshot Connecticut 15­8 and had 11 corner kicks to the Huskies' one. The offense and defense both pushed up as part of a more aggressive game plan. 
"In a lot of the games when we've lost, we've scored and gone ahead and kind of fallen back into our own half," Clark said. "That was our plan. We wanted to play the game in their half, and I think the players performed well." 
Save a few careless turnovers and one free kick in which freshman mid­fielder Nate Norman could not find his spot in the set play, Notre Dame never appeared unfamiliar, confused or hesi­tant. 
And it has been that way all season. They play with a confidence that comes with constant practice and knowledge of teammates' strengths and tendencies. 
"We play a lot of shadow in prac­tice," Clark said. "We split up the team and play without opposition. They should have an idea of what runs they should be making all the time." 
Saying it and doing it are two differ­ent things, especially when using a 15-man rotation. But the Irish have done it. 
Due to injuries to senior midfielders Filipo Chillemi and Chad Riley, Notre Dame has rotated young players even more frequently into the system. So far, the substitutions have not changed 
the on-field chemistry for the worse. "At one point today we had three freshmen in the midfield," Clark said. 
Ian Etherington, Greg Dalby and Norman manned the middle while senior captain Greg Martin took a break in the first half. 
The freshmen do impress, but maybe upperclassman leadership from forwards Justin Detter, Devon Prescod and Tony Megna or defense­men Jack Stewart, Kevin Hichards and Kevin Goldthwaite cancels out the inexperience of some of the younger players. 
Or maybe a team ranked No. 5 in the nation has such luck sometimes. 
Hegardless, Notre Dame has 11 shutouts on the season. It avenged its previous loss to Connecticut in the regular season (1-0, OT). and the Irish now travel east. 
If Notre Dame plays smart against Providence Friday afternoon, they have a good shot at reaching the final round. But the players must have that same instinctive awareness they dis­played Sunday. 
"The thing with soccer is it's not that you're calling plays," Clark said. "It's just all happening, so you have to be thinking all the time." 
Right now, it seems the rest of the Big East is thinking while the Irish are doing. They are not following the trend of winning by a nose. They are pulling away, winning and looking like the better team.

Behind 12 event victories, the women's squad thumped visiting Pittsburgh 184-116 Friday, improving to 2-1 in dual meets. 
"We knew that Pitt was after us since they're one of our main competitors in the Big East," freshman Katie Carroll said. "We just went in there focused and did what we had to do." 
Senior Danielle Hulick led the way for the No. 19 Irish, winning the 100-yard backstroke (57.67) in addition to both the 50-and 100-yard freestyle (24.03 and 52.54, respectively). 
Seniors Marie Labosky (200­ya~d backstroke, 1,000-yard freestyle) and Meghan Perry­Eaton (one-and three-meter div­ing) and Carroll (100-yard but­terfly and 200-yard individual medley) each recorded a pair of victories. 
For Carroll, it was the second consecutive meet in which she won the 100-yard butterfly. Sophomores Christel Bouvron (200-yard butterfly) and Courtney Choura (200-yard breaststroke) and freshman Ellen Johnson (500-yard freestyle) also chipped in with flrst-place finishes. 
The men's team, on the other hand, dropped its third consecu­tive dual meet as the Spartans edged the Irish, 125.5-113.5. 
While Michigan State claimed seven event victories, the depth of Notre Dame's young team was evident as the Irish took three of the top four spots in six of the 11 swimming events, including the 50-yard freestyle, 400-yard freestyle relay, 100-and 1,000­yard freestyle, 200-yard individ­ual medley and 200-yard butter­fly. 
Individual race victories were turned in by freshman Tim Kegelman (50-yard freestyle). sophomore Patrick Davis (1,000­yard freestyle) and junior Frank Krakowski (100-yard freestyle). 
The loss marks only the third time in the 46-year history of the Notre Dame men's swimming and diving program that the Irish have begun the season 0-3 in dual meets. Notre Dame has never started 0-4. 
Nevertheless, the Irish don't appear to be fazed by the slow start and are using the dual meets as an opportunity to define different individual roles.

game." 

Katy Fleck hit 9-of-11 shots for 21 points and grabbed seven rebounds and Courtney LaVere had 14 points and nine rebounds to lead Notre Dame to its second exhibition win of the preseason. 
"I think we see a lot of things we need to work, and that's what you really want to get out of a game like this," McGraw said. 
Team Concept was made up of predominantly Hungarian players and played a physical game against Notre Dame. The Irish play strong inside, but 
and forced 29 
turnovers. 
McGraw said 
she was pleased with her team's rebounding as the Irish won the battle of the boards 52-36. Batteast and freshman Crystal Erwin lead the Irish with 11 and 10 rebounds, respectively. Erwin scored nine points in 21 min­utes. 
The contest was sloppy at times, and several players for both teams took hard falls and got inadvertently hit in the face. Notre Dame's Megan Duffy went down hard with just over seven minutes left in the game and did not return. 


Notre Dame jumped out to a 17-6 lead with about 14 min­utes left in the first half on a Flecky layup. That lead was extended to 30-11 with just over six minutes left in the half, and Notre Dame went into intermission leading 40-21. 
The teams went back and forth for much of the second half before Notre Dame began padding its lead late in the half. 
McGraw said the key in preparing for its opening game against Auburn Nov. 14 is find­ing consistency in their play. 
"[Consistency] was our prob­lem all last year," McGraw said. 
"I think you've already seen that. We've had two games and had different people play well and you want to know [who's going to play well]."

especially tough because the Irish still felt they were the better team. 
"Boston College is a good team, but we felt like we've played better teams over the course of the season," Waldrum said. 
Now the Irish must wait to see where they will play in the NCAA Tournament. While the Irish likely have fallen behind UCLA and Portland into at least fourth place in the upcoming NCAA seedings, they could still get that fourth over­all seed because of a rash of upsets in the conference tour­naments that have seen top 10 teams Penn State, Virginia, West Virginia and Colorado

Notes 

The championship game fea­tured two major surprises in Boston College and Villanova. Both teams finished the regu­lar season at only 3-2-1 in league play. Villanova advanced by beating No. 7 West Virginia on penalty kicks. 
The Eagles fell to Villanova in the Championship game, as the Wildcats needed penalty kicks for the second straight game to get the win.

Irish left searching for answers after loss 
PISCATAWAY, N.J.-Two weeks ago, the Irish traveled home from New Jersey having completed an impressive run through the Big East where 
t~ey did n~t give up a sm- Andy Troeger  
gle goal. They shut  Sports Writer  
out 10 teams  

in a row and 14 of the 19 
teams they had played to that 
point. 
What a difference two weeks make. 
Coming back from the Big East Tournament, the Irish are trying to figure out what has changed for a team that now has lost two out of three to teams they expected to beat. After giving up only five goals during their first 19 games, the Irish have allowed six in their last three games. 
And with the NCAA Tournament opening next week, there is not much time for the Irish to right the ship. 
The Irish, who seemed a lock for the No. 2 seed in the upcoming NCAA Tournament only two weeks ago, now will likely be placed somewhere between Nos. 4 and No. 7. After top seeds North Carolina, UCLA and Portland, the pool for those next four seeds should come from Notre Dame, Penn State, Virginia, Santa Clara, Colorado and West Virginia. Ironically, only Santa Clara -an early season victim of the Irish -did not lose this week, and none of those other six teams even made the final of their respective conference

tournament. 
More urgent, however, are the problems that have cropped up in the last few games. The defense that led the nation in goals-against average through 19 games has given up more goals in the last three games (six) than in the first 19 combined (five). The offense that has looked so good all season has sputtered, mus­tering only four shots on goal against Boston College. 
Injuries have played a role, with Mary Boland, Melissa Tancredi and Amy Warner all missing games recently. Those three players were Notre Dame's three representatives on the All-Big East first team and are possibly Notre Dame's three most irreplaceable play­ers. Boland and Tancredi have returned to the lineup, but the timing of Warner's return is still uncertain. 
The Irish now have the next five days to prepare for their next opponent, who will be announced today. Almost assuredly, the Irish will be bet­ter than their first two oppo­nents in the tournament, but they also were better than Michigan and Boston College. 
The Irish have always fared well in the postseason, although that armor has been chinked some in the last few seasons. Still, a team with 19 wins in 22 games and a history as one of the premier women's soccer programs in the country is a program to be feared as the season nears its end. 
Regardless of past history, the Irish now enter the time of the year when one loss ends a season. The Irish have one final chance to regroup and make yet another run toward a National Championship. Yet something suggests that this group will make the most of it.

The Irish regis­tered a season-low four shots on goal in falling for only the second time this season, but the second time in their last three games. 
The teams played a fairly even game, with both sides attempting six shots, with five shots on goal for Notre Dame to three for Boston College. 
The Irish struggled out of the gate and the Eagles cashed in on a failed Irish clearance. The ball ended up at the feet of Boston College midfielder Heather Farran, who scored from the right side of the box 10 yards out. 
The Irish outshot the Eagles 5-3 in the first half, but were unable to get many serious threats at the Boston College goal, as the Eagle midfield was able to control play. 
Boston College got its key second goal early in the second half, as All­Big East midfielder Sarah Rahko played the ball to Beth Totman near the top of the box. Totman turned and scored past Irish goalkeeper Erika Bohn for the crucial two-goal lead. 
At that point, the Irish made a key shift in formation by bringing senior Melissa Tancredi forward from her normal spot at central defense. The move paid off, as Tancredi scored off a header to pull the Irish within a goal at 2-1 with 26 minutes left in the game as Eagle goalkeeper Kate Taylor came out of the goal. Vanessa Pruzinsky assisted on the goal. Despite having a few chances, includ­

Championship by a score of 2-0 at Alumni Field Sunday. 
The fans, who bundled up to stand the near-freezing temper­atures, had a lot to cheer about at the end of the game as the Irish advanced to face Providence in the semifinals Friday in Storrs, Conn. Senior forwards Justin Detter and Devon Prescod scored the goals. 
'.'Yeah, I guess you could prob­ably say it was the best game we played all year," said captain Greg Martin, who assisted on both goals. "I think what we did was just put the whole package together." 
After a slightly sloppy first 10 minutes or so, the Irish domi­nated play for the rest of the game, outshooting the visiting Huskies 15-8 and earning 11 corner kicks to just one for Connecticut. 
Notre Dame also did a good job on defense, holding Connecticut's leading scorer Steve Sealy to just two shots on 
goal. One reason for Notre 
Dame's dominance was an 
aggressive defensive scheme 
where the forwards would 
come up to pressure the 
Connecticut defensemen as 
they were trying to clear the 
ball, often resulting in positive 
turnovers for the Irish offense. 
"We wanted to play the game in their half, not in our half," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "To do that, you have to estab­lish pressure, and to do that we had to bring up the forwards and midfielders. 
"It's not just them, though. The whole team presses togeth­er, and I think we did a good job of that." 
Lackadaisical effort on defense led to a dangerous opportunity for Connecticut 
about 20 minutes into the game. Sealy managed to sneak past the Irish defense and come in one-on-one against goalkeeper Chris Sawyer. 
With an Irish defenseman closing from behind, Sealy tried to lob his shot over the diving Sawyer, but he missed it well over the cross bar. Sealy also sent a header wide right of the goal with less than five minutes remaining in the first half. 
Neither team mounted many offensive chances in the first, as they went into halftime tied 0-0 and with the Irish holding a 6-4 advantage in shots. Notre Dame was unable to capitalize on a 7­0 lead in corner kicks in the mark. 
"We could've probably done better there," Clark said. "I thought we could have done a better job with the corner kicks." 
The Irish came out in the sec­ond half and appeared the more dominant team from the start. In the 63rd minute, Notre Dame finally broke the scoreless tie. 
Defender Kevin Goldthwaite took a hard shot from the left sideline which Connecticut goal­keeper Adam Schuerman
