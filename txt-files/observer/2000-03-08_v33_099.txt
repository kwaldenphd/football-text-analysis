FACULTY SENATE 

Members approve Student Life report 
. Group also asks ND to join Workers' Rights Consortium 
By JOSHUA BOURGEOIS A~sis1anr News Edi tor 
The Fawlty Senate passed two reso­lutions Tuesday dealing with a report to the Ad l loc Committee on Academic and Student Life and the Progressive Student Alliance request for the Cniversity to take further action against sweatshops. 
The committees on academic affairs and student affairs drafted the report debated at the meeting. The report intends to inform the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic and Student Life on the faculty's role in the integration of acad­emk and campus life. The Ad Hoc Committee will then write a report on the issue in April. 
The Faculty Senate H.eport to the Ad lloc Committee on Academic and Student Life suggests that there should be "either the reorganization of the Campus Life Council [CLC) or the forma­tion of a new body to replace it fthe CLCJ to oversee the integration of Academic and Campus life." 
According to the report, some of the issues the suggested committee should deal with are "Residence Hall Faculty Fellows or Resident Faculty Masters and Senior Tutors; oversight of all disci­plinary procedures involving student organizations, including media, addressing politically or academically controversial issues and organization of the system of residence halls to promote specifically academic goals as well as those currently pursued in the residence halls." 

After debating the inclusion of a diver­sity clause, the Senate voted to endorse the report by a vote of 28-3. The report will now go to the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic and Student Life. 
Aaron Kreider of the Progressive Student Alliance (PSA) attended the 
meeting and presented the Senate a proposal that asked the University to withdraw from the Fair Labor Association (FLA) and join the newly formed Workers' Rights Consortium

Most non-smokers are pleased with the policy, but many smokers and non­smokers alike were surprised that this was passed and disappointed that their input seemed lacking in the decision. 
The decision met mixed reactions from the students.

INSIDE COLUMN 


It's just a place, right? 
In three months. I'll be gone. I realized that the other day when an envelope filled with com­mencement information met me at the mailbox. It was a sign ofmy collegiate mortality. 
And when I opened that envelope, and read such dry material about how exactly Notre Dame is going to kick me 
out. I began to cry. 
It wasn't a sob event. It was just a smt.11 trickle, enough to make me notice a change in my emotional well-being, but not so much that I couldn't weasel my way oul of explaining why there was a tear running 

down my cheek. {It was a 
piece of dirt, l would proba-Mike Vanegas 
bly say.) 
A.njrv.'ay, I suppose it's just the sentimentalist who's Scene editor been hiding deep down in my soul for such a long time. I've never pretended not to be a sensitive person. But I've never pretended to be a big fan of loving Notre Dame and every­thing attached to it. 
I've visited the Grotto when I needed spiritual mending. I visited the Main Huilding when it reopened. I went to all the home football games. 
But really, I would have made those trips if I were at any other school. It was really my spiri­tuality, my curiousity and my interest in sports that instigated them. 
So why did I cry when I discovered that I was on my last leg at good ol' Notre Dame? 
It's because everything I thought was impor­tant in my life was somehow infected by this place. I've been here for three and a half years already. A.nd I've grown attached to it. 
Don't get me wrong. I don't regret coming to Notre Dame. I'm glad I made the decision to attend the only school to which I applied, and which accepted me. 
But did I expect Notre Dame to fully become part of my psychological being? I nev~r really took advantage of everything Notre Dame boasts offering its students. I never took part in any extracurricular activities aside from the march­ing band (which helped me get into the football games for free) and The Observer (which I con­sider more of a job). I just didn't embrace Notre Dame. 
But now, I find myself trying to wring every­thing that is Notre Dame out of my brain. I don't want to cry when my parents come back to South Bend for the first time since freshman ori­entation. 
I don't want to cry when I sit with my fellow Domers at the commencement Mass or at actual commencement. 
I'd much rather consider these last four years as just another four years in my long life. Why can't Notre Dame be a place instead of a lifestyle? 
But, for some reason, I don't think that'll hap­pen. 
That's why I was offended when everyone lashed out against the newly corrupted Notre Dame student body last week for the action of a single "waterboy" whom I've forgiven already. (I didn't care much in the first place.) 
So, though. I'll probably be crying my eyes out come mid-May, I know that soon after, when I leave this place, I'll be crying my eyes out about how I don't have a good job, no future and a new life I'm not too sure about loving.

FDA denounces Penn gene study, won't lift ban 
PI-I ILADELPHIA 

In a scathing letter to Penn's Institute for Human Gene Therapy on Friday, the U.S. Food and Orug Admini.stration rejected the [nstitutc's defense of its handling of the clinical study that cost an 18­year-old man his.life and refused to lift the ban on gene therapy at the university. 
In the 20-page warning letter addressed to IHGT director James Wilson, who led the study, federal regulators charged the researcher with having "failed to fulflll the obligations as the sponsor" or gene therapy studies, and accused him of violating federal human research regulations. 
"We are disappointed that the FDA appears to discount a number of the responses to those charges filed by the IHGT," University of 

The warning comes six weeks after the rDA charged the Institute with 18 possible violations of federal research protocol breaches and placed a ban on all gene therapy at Penn. !HGT officials responded to the allegations last month and an external committee of scientists is expected to release its findings by 
mid-April. 
Federal regulators refuted nearly all of the responses offered by the Institute concerning the gone thera­py trial in which Jesse Gelsinger, who died last September, was enrolled. Wilson and his researchers later determined that Gelsinger died of multiple organ failure induced by the gene therapy. 
The Institute -which until recently had been considered one of the top gene therapy research cen­ters in the world -now has 15 business days to inform the FDA about any corrective steps that will be taken and submit any data and documentation for which the letter calls. 
But a source close to the investiga­tion said that the University will now only submit the documents asked for in the letter; it will not seek to dis­pute every point with the FDA. 

Packer apologizes to Duke students 
DURHAM, N.C. 
Through an e-mail to two students, Billy Packer said he never intended "to disparage Duke University or its students." CBS basketball commen­tator Billy Packer apologized Monday to two Duke students for sexist remarks he made to them at a home more than a week ago. "I am sorry you were offended by my comments as I entered Cameron on Feb. 26," Packer wrote in a brief e-mail to Trinity junior Jen Feinberg and Pratt junior Sarah Bradley. "It was never my intention to disparage Duke University or its students." Bradley and Feinberg responded and accepted Packer's apology Wednesday. "We were pleased to see it. I was actu­ally sort of stunned when I saw it pop up in my e­m ail," Feinberg said. "We're glad to have it resolved." CBS had no official statement on the issue, saying that it was between Packer and the students. Packer, who was criticized in 1996 for calling basketball star Allen Iverson a "tough mon­key," declined further comment Monday, calling it a "personal matter."

NYU votes to join labor rights group 
NEW YORK 

The university senate voted Thursday to join the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC) on a conditional basis and send representatives to its first organiza­tional meeting in April. All but one of the senators present at the meeting voted in favor joining the WRC after nearly 20 minutes of debate over the language of the resolution. The WRC is a newly formed independent monitoring group that would oversee the implementation of wage, condition and civil rights standards in the apparel factories that NYU subcontracts for the manufacture of universi­ty-logo garments. So far 13 universities including NYU have joined the organization. according to the WRC. Arthur Tannenbaum, chairman of the sen­ate's public affairs committee, presented a report recommending that "the full senate vote to recom­mend that the university join the WHC on a condi­tional basis and that the president designate a member of the university community to serve as NYU's official representative to the group at its April meeting."

Construction updates, a visil. from the newly elected Notre Dame student body president and vice president and introduc­tions of new Board of Governance members highlight­ed the Saint Mary's BOG meeting Tuesday. 
The Historical Preservation Committee had a meeting to dis­cuss the fut.ure uf Dalluway's, Saint Mary's clubhouse. At this point, there are no definite plans to tear it down, but it may revert back to th0 Sisters of the Holy Cross if the current transaction goes through. ln this transaction, Saint Mary's would get a new clubhouse and also the softball and soccer fields for develop­ment. The school hopes to break ground on a new clubhouse soon. 
In more construction news, the major renovations in Regina Hall may begin as early as spring break. Nancy Midden, current Saint Mary's student body presi­dent, announced that BOG would help the Jubilee Community Commitment Committee by sub­mitting feedback on the student bodv's behalf. 
The committee was established in December to examine docu­mentation going back to 1975, Midden said. It also sought to make recommendations based on their findings. The committee submitted their suggestions to the Administrative Council and is now looking for feedback. 

Angie Little, student body vice president, announced several activities for Women's Month in March. 
Some of the activities planned include a study break, a service project called "Bottomless Closet," which will focus on pro­viding women with business attire who would not otherwise be able to afford it. 
"Carolyn Kelley did a really good job [setting this up]," Little said. Kelley is the representative for Women's Studies on the Student Academic Council. 
In other BOG news: 
. Brian O'Donoghue and Brooke Norton, Notre Dame's student body president and vice president elects, officially intro­duced themselves at the meet­ing. 
Current student body vice president Michael Palumbo was also in attendance, along with Saint Mary's student body presi­dent-elect Crissie Renner and vice president-elect Michelle Nagle. 
O'Donoghue and Norton's visit served to wrap up the controver­sy which enveloped both Saint Mary's and Notre Dame's elec­tions. 
Other newly elected officers who were introduced at Tuesday's meeting included Saint Mary's Residence Hall Association president-elect Mindy Rennaker and junior class president-elect Katy Robinson. 
. BOG was asked for two co­sponsorships. The Student Nurses Association requested funds to attend a conference in Salt Lake City in April. The sec­ond request was for a mission trip to the Lillian Trasher Orphanage in Asyut, Egypt. 
"It's the most amazing experi­ence I've ever had," Robinson said of a previous mission trip. Robinson's father, Dr. Jim Robinson. runs a dental facility at the orphanage. Hobinson and Nagle will be traveling with him this summer on the trip. 
. 
Midnight Madness will be held on March 31, from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. The evening includes finals for the intramural sports, games, food and a DJ. Grand prize is an all-expenses paid trip to Chicago. 

. 
Nominations for the Student Leadership Appreciation Award, given to a faculty, administration or staff member who prepares students as lead­ers, are due March 24.

On Nov. 16, 1989. six Jesuit priests and two women in El Salvador were mercilessly gunned down. 
Tuesday, Sister Marie Dennis, director of the Maryknoll Peace and Justice Center came to Saint Mary's from Washington to tell their story. "Like grains of wheat," she sairl, "Thrv werr holy people of God," ·· 
The "grains of wheat" were Ignatio Ellacuria, SPgundo Montes, Nacho Martin-Baro, Juan Ramm, Moreno, Amanda Lopex and Joaquin J.opez y Lopez. The two women killed were Elba Ramos and her 15­year-old daughter, Celina. 
'Tfhese people] were imitators of Christ, followers of Jesus. They were seeds of new life," Dennis said. 
The country of El Salvador is filled with poverty. In a very complex situation, the govern­ment and military control most of the wealth and had wauted the poor to stay in poverty, Dennis said, As long as there was poverty, there was econom­ic and social power in El Salvador,

GREENVILLE, S.C. 

Students who want to take advantage of Bob Jones University's decision to drop its ban on interracial dating will need a note from their parents. Bob Jones III, the school's president, announced an end to the ban Friday. On 1\fonday, he told nearly 4,000 students at a daily chapel service that they must tell their parents if" they become involved in an interracial rela­tionship. "We will carry out the will of your par­ents," he said. "They will need to have a say in this." Parents must send a letter to the dean of· men or women approving the relationship before the school will allow it, Jones said. He said at the chapel service that most people view interracial marriage as an unwise decision, "I think that's evidenced by the fact that so few people are interracially married," Jones said. "When you date interracially or marry interra­cially, it cuts you off from people."

Jurors debate date-rape drug poisoning 
Associated Press 
DETROIT 
Jurors began Tuesday deliberating the fate of a man accused of causing the death of a 15-year-old girl by slipping a date-, rape drug into her soft drink. · 
Joshua Cole. 19, is charged with three counts of felony poisoning, each carrying a possible life sentence, and involuntary manslaughter. Manslaughter is punish­able by up to 15 years behind bars. 
In closing arguments Tuesday, defense attorney John Courtright told jurors that his client acted out of ignorance but did not intend to harm the teen-ager. He said Samantha Reid's death was a "tragic accident." 
"No one would knowing­ly hurt themselves or their friends," Courtright said. "Sometimes things happen that shouldn't happP.n, and it's a tragedy." 
Prosecutors say Cole and three other men gave the girls soft drinks secretly spiked with gamma-hydroxybutyrate 

during a party Jan. 16, 1999, 
Samantha died the next day. HM friend Melanie Sindone, now 16, fell into a coma but recovered. 
Courtright asked the jury to consider Cole's aclions the night of the party and afterward: car­rying the unconscious girls from the apartment to a van and calling their. parents from the hospital when others urged him not to. 
Wayne County assistant prosecutor Doug Baker said in his closing argu­ment Monday that Cole 
knew GHB was potentially harmful, because he told police investigating that he had tried it once and gotten sick. 
The trial is believed to be among the first in the country resulting from a GHB-related death. 
Two other men Nicholas Holtschlag, 18, and Daniel Rrayman, 18 -are each charged with involuntary manslaughter and two counts of felony poisoning. A third, Erick Limmer. 26, is charged with poisoning, delivery of marijuana and possession of GHB.

She spent the last several months in Ireland interacting with mostly Protestant youth and conducting interviews to gather information. While thPre, McEvoy witnessed firsthand the vulnerability of the peace process, as well as the optimism of youth that can envision a peaceful future. Northern Ireland's peace process is gener­ally seen as spanning the last seven years, McEvoy said, with 1993-1998 being considered the conflict resolution era and 1998 as post settlement. 
This current method looks to see that actions taken are viable with the young. 
"No group is more charged with carrying the peace process forward than the youth," she said. 
Knowing that more than 40 percent of Northern Ireland's population is younger than 24, McEvoy said that the youth hold the hope for a peaceful future. For those she studied, anywhere from one-third to one-half of their lives have taken place dur­ing the peace process.

The WRC, according to the proposal, operates with­out corporate oversight and will make public its annual reports. 
Kreider wants the University to join the WRC by April 1 so that the University can have a voice in the organization's founding conference on April 7. 
The issue was sent to the com­mittee on Student Affairs and after debate thfl committee decided to write its own resolu­tion to propose to the entire Senate body. 
The committee proposed "that the Faculty Senate endorses the initiative· of the Progressive Sturlent Allianrn in favor of Notre Dume joining the Workers' Rights Consortium by April 1, 2000 "

Though all are aware of the need for µeace, there exists a notable difference in how this peace is envisioned, McEvoy said. Opinions are influenced, for example, by where one lives, his or her socioeconomic status and religious affilia­tion. In 
and 27 percent of those unem­ployed are under 25. 
One of the arnas McEvov con­centrated on concerne·d the youth's perception of violence. Here she found that these ideas were "shaped by local histo·ry and parental experience." From 1994 to 1998, violent outbrnaks in Norl.hern Ireland declined. Since then, however. the rates have steadily risen. 
People between the ages of 16 and 24 are more likely to have witnessed and participated in sectarian violence. When McEvoy surveyed 12-to 17-year­olds, she found that 76 percent felt that this violence was directly linked to religion. Twenty-five percent said they had to hide their religion from others; 27 percent had received threats because of their religion; 47 per­cent purposely avoid certain places out of fear; more than half understand religion as a source ofviolence. 
These violent attacks, howev­er, stem not only from members of opposing sects, but also from the police and paramilitary sol­diers who supposedly prevent violence. ·

"Religion-related violence remains an immediate experi­ence in the peace 'process for many youth," McEvoy said. 
Though it seems the youth should be interested in turning their leadership away from vio­lence, their political allegiances lie overwhelmingly with either the Democratic Unionist party or its Republican counterpart, Sinn Fein, both of which are seen as highly militant groups. I lowever, 19 percent of tlw youth surveyed said Llrnt they do not support any of tlrn parties cur­rrntly active in Nort.lrnrn Irnland. 
"The youth aro frustrated that Lhore are few real opportunities l'or engagement other than the sectarian or extremist groups," McEvoy said. "Tlrny have very low perceptions of' political effi­cacy."

some of the 20 page 11 social, political and pocketbook pro­posals on the California ballot Tuesday. Voters also reaf­firmed their support for casino gambling on Indian land and rejected an attempt to repeal the tobacco taxes championed by director Rob Reiner. With 17 percent of precinctc; reporting, 1,009,656 voters, or 66 percent, supported the gay marriage ban, known as Proposition 22, while 521,460 voters, or 34 percent. opposed it. California, like every other state, does not license gay marriages. Proposition 22 bans recognition of gay mar­riages performed in any other state. Similar ballot measures passed in Alaska and Hawaii in 1998, and signatures are being gathered in Colorado and Nevada. But the stakes, as always, seemed higher in the nation's most populous state. The issue galvanized politi­cians and church leaders on both sides, with each side claiming they were fighting for families. Supporters raised about $8 million and oppo­nents about $5.5 million. Proposition 22 was spon­sored by Republican state Sen. Pete Knight; the opponents included Knight's gay son. "Probably it's my small town upbringing and the fact that I've been going to church all my life," said Lewis Cain of Sacramento, who voted for Proposition 22. "It just scemr-d like the right thing to do." Reiner returned to the polit­ical theater to oppose the measure that would have repealed the SO-cent-a-pack cigarette tax he campaigned for in 1998. With 14 percent of precincts reporting, the measure had 966,711 no votes, or 71 percent, and just 402,039 yes votes, or 29 per­cent. The original tax -designed to fund early childhood devel­opment programs -squeaked through, prompting cigarette retailer Ned Roscoe to launch the repeal effort. However, the tobacco companies failed to jump in and the campaign never grew. Also on the ballot was a sec­ond try at legalizing casinos on Indian land. With 19 per­cent of precincts reporting, there were 1,071,630 yes votes, or 64 percent, to 609,740 no votes, or 36 per­cent. A similar measure passed in 1998 but was struck down as unconstitutional. This time, the measure sought to amend the state constitution in a ver­sion supporters hoped would stand up.

Arafat, Barak meet as independence deadline nears 
+ Leaders hold summit in hopes of restarting stalled peace efforts 
Associated Press 
HAMALLAH 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Vasser Arafat met late Tuesday to try to settle their differences 
o v e r stalled p e a c e efforts. 
The two met in Savvon. an affluent suburb of Tel Aviv, a senior Palestinian official said. Separately, an Israeli official confirmed that the meeting had taken place but gave no further details. 
President Clinton's top Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, arrived in Israel earlier in the day on his second visit to the region since talks collapsed last month over a disagree­ment on an interim troop withdrawal from the West Bank. 
Ross' return prompted spec­ulation that he was carrying new proposals for both sides. The Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of 

JAPAN 
Subway derails, kills 2 
Associated Press · 
TOKYO 
A subway train derailed and hit an oncoming train during rush hour Wednesday, killing two passengers and injuring at least 19 others, officials said. 
Three of the injured were rushed to hospitals uncon­scious following the 9:03 a.m., said Tokyo Fire Department spokesman Fukuo Isozaki. 
The cause of thP dPrailment near Nakameguro Station in western Tokyo, one of Tokyo's busiest subway lines, was not immerliatcly known, said spokesman Ryuichi Kinoshita of the Tokyo llapid Transit Authority. 
Public television network NHK broadcast live coverage showing the wall of one of the train's rear cars sheered off, apparently when it hit the on­coming subway train, which was on a parallel track. 
Kyodo News agency report­ed that the train had been derailed by an explosion inside one of the cars. 
But Tadao Ando, an otlicial with the Cabinet's Crisis Management Office, said there was no evidence of sab­otage or any criminal act in the accident. 
anonymity, said Ross was to attend the meeting. 
The official said the meeting was spurred by the peacemak­ing efforts of Egyptian President llosni Mubarak, who called Arafat and Barak on Monday to discuss a new package of Egyptian and American ideas. The propos­als include some minor Israeli concessions. 
In the land dispute, Palestinians wanted the inter­im troop withdrawal from 6.1 

percent of the West Bank to include populous suburbs of Jerusalem. Israel refused, 
Barak saying dis­
cussion of the suburbs should be under­taken during final-status negotiations on the city, claimed by both sides as a capital. 
Arafat suspended final-sta­tus talks last month over the issue, saying that if he could not trust Israel on relatively minor issues, there was no point in negotiating the major issues. 
Earlier Tuesday, Arafat told his legislature that he would declare Palestinian statehood this year, with or without Israel's consent. He said Israel must stop procrastinating if it wants to meet a September deadline for a peace treaty giving it a say on the terms of statflhood. 

"This is the moment of truth. The gover~ment of' Israel must stop dictating and wasting Lime," Arafat derlarnd. "We will only accept the implementation of the agreements and will settle for 
nothing less than  our  l'ull  
rights."  
The  Palestinian  leader's  

speech was interrupted by hearty applause, especially when he said 2000 was the year of Pa!Pstinian indepen­dence. 
The Palestinians prefer to win statehood as a result of' a peace agreement with lsnwl. A unilateral declaration by Arafat would leave his admin­istration with control over only 40 percent of the West Bank, and could possibly trig­ger a military confrontation with Israel. 
Arafat already agreed once, in May 1999, to postpone a statehood declaration, and thus would find it difficult to do so again if a peace treaty is not reached by September. 
Israel radio reported that Israel would propose gestures on other issues in hopes that Arafat would give in on the West Bank suburbs. The radio reported that those other issues would include the release of prisoners, the establishment of a second "safe passage" route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza, and the approval of a Gaza port.

Cruising across the regions, George W. Bush won five Super Tuesday primaries in an accel­erating drive to vanquish John McCain's political insurgency. "It's a huge step toward the nomination." the Republican presidential candidate said as McCain struggled to broaden his thri>at beyond independent­minded New England states. 
Bush won in Ohio. Georgia, Missouri and Maryland by dou­ble-digit margins -and broke McCain's hold on tho Northeast with a narrow victory in Maine. McCain won in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Vermont as voters in 13 states participated in the year's largest night of

McCain's situation was not as dire, but his candi­dacy was flagging with a tough week of Bush-friendly contests lying just ahead. 
Looking past McCain to a potential fight with Gore, Bush congratulated the vice president for his Super Tuesday victory, but said, "He is the candidate of the status quo in Washington, D.C., and he has a tough case to make in the general elect.ion." 
SPveral McCain advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Arizona senator would take stock of his campaign Wednesday when he travels to his retreat 
The AP as the campaign moved swiftly to nine primaries in the next seven days. 
Forging familiar coalitions, Bush relied on party faithful while McCain drew from inde­pendents and moderate Republicans. McCain's gamble of criticizing conservative Chrisitan leaders may have backfired in key states, while Bush's visit to a South Carolina university with a history of anti­Catholic views seemed to be a beneficial campaign issue for McCain in some states.

"Clearly, we have done very well on the East Coast," he said. 
Neither candidate could accu­mulate the magic number of 1,034 delegates Tuesday, but Bush hoped for a string of victo­ries that would drive McCain from the race and allow him to turn his attention to Gore, who has gained against the GOP front-runner in head-to-head polls. 


Gore dominates Bradley in elections 
Associated Press 
Al Gore swept past Bill Bradley in an unbroken string of states on Super Tuesday, pushing his rival to the brink of withdrawal in the Democratic presidential cam­paign. "In this election, we are the party of the mainstream," the vice 
president said, swift­ly turning his focus toward November. 
Gore won from '.'Jew York to 


Georgia to Bradley Ohio and at several 
stops in between, regularly gaining 60 percent of the vote or more. Seeking to shut out his rival. he also bid for victory in California, the biggest prize on the busiest night of the pri­mary season. 
"He won. I lost," Bradley said succinctly. The former New Jersey senator tele­phoned Gore with his congrat­ulations. and said he would announce his plans within a few days. Aides did nothing to discourage talk of a withdraw­al. 
Polling place interviews with voters in every region of the country underscored the vice presid-ent's strength among 
core constituencies vital in Democratic primaries. 
Blacks preferred Gore over Bradley by a margin of 6-1; and Hispanics by 8-1. The margin among union members was smaller, but a healthy 3-1. 
Gore also won the vote of independents, a key element of Bradley's electoral strategy, and a group that the 
Democratic 


nominee will need in the general election race. The exit polling was con­ducted by Voter News 
Gore Service, a 

consortium of the AP and television net­works. 
Gore defeated Bradley in the New England states of Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, completing a regional sweep that began in New Hampshire's leadoff primary more than a month ago. 
He triumphed, as well, in Georgia, where he was win­ning roughly 80 percent of the vote; Ohio, roughly 70 percent; and New York, Maryland and Missouri, roughly 60 percent. 
Bradley came closest in Vermont, where he was gain­ing 44 percent of the vote. 
The delegate tally lagged the popular vote by hours.

As I sit here watching Monday Night Raw, I can't help hut think about the type of age we live in where it is so easy to place blame everywhere but on ourselves. I love it every time the Rock says "candyass" and "rootypoo." I watch in anticipa­tion of seeing who will be thrown headfirst into a table. It is violent, and it is entertain­ment. 
Realize, though, that my 22-year-old brain understands that this is a show. I am disgusted, however, when the camera pans the audience and I see kids no older than 10 holding up their middle linger and saying "suck it." 
Last year, a young boy who could not have been older than 9 accidentally killed his younger sister. He was imitat­ing a wrestling move he saw on one of the many professional wrestling shows on television. The public was so quick to blame these entertainers. 
Crusades have been launched empha­sizing that violence in television shows and video games is the cause of such tragedies. The real tragedy is that the W\'VF is not to blame. That child should not have been watching the program in the first place. 
I recently saw an episode of Jerry Springer, whose show is notorious for its ridiculous brawls. I have to say. it was a little disappointing to sec that they now edit out the fight scenes. 
If you watch Jerry Springer, you are watching to sec who is going to fight. The hilarity is the. fact that this show is a complete mockery of humanity. Viewers cannot believe that these peo­ple exist. 


The audience is there to see a show. A show that is crazy, wild and unlike reality. It is not real. Yet, Springer has been the subject of scrutiny when the values of America are the crusades of the day. Here is a man who is making millions capitalizing off of fights between "porn stars in drag with a sexy secret to tell." 
Critics often ask, "What kind of mes­sage are we sending to the children who see such programs on television?" I ask this: What kind of parent would let their 6-year-old watch Springer in the first place? Don't condemn the man who is making his living by giving his audience what they want to see. 
After the Columbine tragedy, news stories circulated that the two obviously troubled teenagers who killed several people may have been influenced by the heavy metal music they listened to. This idea is ridiculous. 
The concept of right and wrong is instilled in each of us at birth. What happened that day in Colorado was done by two people who knew exactly what they were doing. Without regard or respect for human life they acted out of their own free will. Marilyn Manson did not pull the trigger. 
A short time after the Oliver Stone's movie "Natural Born Killers" was released, a man committed murder, cit­ing that his motivation formed after viewing the violent and graphic film. 
Lawsuits were brought against Stone. The media chastised him for creating such a violent and gruesome story that resulted in the loss of human life. What the media failed to mention was the millions of other people who saw the movie and did not kill anyone. 
It is horrible that this crime was com­mitted, but it is just as scary that some­one could actually be released for com­mitting such an act based on the defense that "Oliver Stone made me do it." 
Displacing blame is not just a society­at-large idea. It happens everyday and it often happens here. 
Consider this situation: A girlfriend tells her boyfriend that she is tired and is going to sleep on a Thursday night. He later finds out that she went out to Heartland and danced the night away. She returns and discovers that a friend of his saw her there and told the bovfriend. 
So what does she do? She calls his friend, yells at him and accuses him of involving himself in business that is of no concern of his. She never apologizes for her actions but displaces the blame. 
I-low many times have we known about a test for weeks, not studied for it until the night before, barely passed it and then adamantly blamed the profes­sor for making the test so hard? That's right, it must be his fault -not our own -that we did not do well. 
If we do not start taking responsibility for our own actions in minor situations likes these, we will never accept the responsibility in the future when it really counts. It starts with us. It starts in the home. Certainly outside forces with negative factors foster growth. Only we plant the seed. 
So the next time your 5-year-old cousin says "suck it," don't blame v\TWF president Vince McMahon.

Inconsistent view of 
homosexuality misleads students 
On Tuesday, the people of California voted on Proposition 22, which proposes that, "only marriage between a man and a woman is recognized in California." 
A genera­tion ago, and for the past two millen­nia. thfl truth of that proposition would have been regard­ed as self­nvir!ent. Today it is doubted hPcause of a cultural redefinition of the nature of homosexual acts, of the homo­sexual inclination and conse­quently of marriage and the fami­ly. 
More to the point, one may fair­ly question whether the California proposition would be approved by a majority at Notre Dame. This is so because for several years, the administration has permeated the campus with a view of the subject that is incoherent and mislead­ing. 
Let's review some basics. Homosexual acts are intrinsically wrong. As the Letter on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons, issued with the approval of John Paul Ir in 1986, states: "It is only in the marital relationship that the use of the sexual faculty can be morally good. To choose someone of the same sex for one's sexual activity is to annul the rich symbolism and meaning, not to mention the goals, of the creator's sexual design." The homosexual inclination is not a sin. However, as the 1986 letter states, "Although the particular inclination of tbe homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil, and thus the inclination itself must ~.e seen as an objective dis­order. 
The Catechism sums it up: "The 
number of men and women wbo 
have deep-seated homosexual 
tendencies is not negligible. This 
inclination, which is objectively 
disordered, constitutes for most 
of them a trial. They must be 
accepted with respect, compas­
sion and sensitivity. Every sign of 
unjust discrimination in their 
n~gard should be avoided. These 
persons are called to fulfill God's 
will in their lives and, if thev are 
Christians, to unite to the sacri­
fice ol' the Lord's Cross the diffi­
culties thev mav encounter from 
their condition.'" (No. 2358.) 
Notre Dame commendably 
insists that persons of homosexu­
al inclination are entitled to 
respect and acceptance as mem­
bers of the University community. 
The administration also says that 
homos<1xual acts are prohibited 
by "official Church teaching," but 
it refuses to affirm that the incli­
nation toward those acts is disor­
dered. That makes no sense, and 
it misleads the students. If, as the 
Catechism states, "homosexual 
acts are intrinsically disordered," 
(No. 2357), how could the inclina-tion toward those acts be any­thing but disordered? If the incli­nation is not disorderPd, why may it not be acted upon? 

Sine1~ the administration docs not recognize the inclination as disordered, it infers that the pro­hibition of homosexual acts is an arbitrary edict of an insensitive Church. In truth, homosexual acts, and the inclination to them. are "intrinsically disordered," not because of "official Church teach­ing," but because they are con­trary to nature and the law of God. 
The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, last May, forbade Sister Jeannine Gramick and Pather Robert Nugent to engage in homosexual ministries beC'ause their positions on "the intrinsic evil of homosexual acts and the objective disorder of the homosexual inclination are doc­trinally unacceptable." Sister Jeannine's speech at Notre Dame last week was co-sponsored by the Counseling Center. That makes you wonder what kind of counseling they do over there. 
The administration misleads students into regarding the teaching of the Church as an arbitrary restriction on a well­ordered inclination. And it dis­courages students from using potentially helpful resources. The Student Union Board stated last term to the Trustees: "[W]e ask that Campus Ministry invite Courage to campus. This organi­zation was founded by Catholic priests to minister to the homo­sexual community. Courage is truly pastoral: It presents partici­pants with the teachings of the Catholic Church while ministering to them through group support and loving care, bringing them into the Catholic community." 
Don't hold your breath waiting for our leaders to allow Courage on campus. When the Maritain Center sponsored a series of speakers in the fall of 1997, including Father John Harvey, the founder of Courage, Campus Ministry and the Counseling Center took Observer ads to dis­courage attendance. The efforts of Courage and similar groups are politically incorrect. 
The administration's orthodoxy of political correctness prevails over the pastoral needs of stu­dents. "(D]eparture from the Church's teaching or silence about it, in an effort to provide pastoral care," says the 1986 Letter, "is neither caring nor pas­toral. Only what is true can ulti­mately be pastoral. The neglect of the Church's position prevents homosexual men and women from receiving the care they need and deserve." 
And it leads to distorted ideas on the nature of the human per­son, marriage and the family. One may fairly wonder how the folks at Campus Ministry and the Counseling Center would have voted on Proposition 22.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

We should practice forgiveness 
I just wanted to write a littlP note of encour­agement to the "waterboy." We all have our moments in life that we wish we could take back. I know I have had my share. Evervone makes mistakes and the only thing that ·we can do is realize them, admit it and try to go on as best we can. To everyone else, give the poor guy a break; no one can do anything about it now and he was not the only one who threw an object at that game. Let's all forgive him and move on with life. I believe he has been morB than rrncessarily punished with every student. faculty member and alumnus calling for his head on a platter. 
It's a pretty sad situation when the University has to provide measures to protect him from the student body. We are Christians! Let's practice that fundamental concept our faith is based on: forgiveness.

Alumni criticism is a disservice 
How ashamed we, as a student body, should be of ourselves. Misconduct at basketball games, poor displays of sportsmanship and self-control and immaturity in the national spotlight have tainted our image. We are no longer the "MVPs." We have let ourselves, our school, our alumni and our historical reputa­tion down. 
This doesn't seem like a particularly wrong statement to make. In fact, I am willing to concede, to a large degree, that we, the Notre Dame student body, are lacking in the behav­ior befitting of a university with such a histor­ical and reknowned reputation. Notre Dame students have brought a lot of shame to the University through their recent actions at sporting events out of a simple lack of respect for the opponents, the nature of sportsmanship and the ideals of the Notre Dame com­munity. 
This issue has 
been debated in ' our school paper for two weeks now. Granted, I, above all people, am will­ing to admit the big mistakes that were made. I am willing to respect the fact that each person has and is entitled to give their opin­ion. However, there is acer­tain irony to thP. recent out­lashes in the Viewpoint letters to the editor. 

l was particularly shocked by the words of one author in Friday's paper. Mark Laug~.man must have thought his words of anger would either scare good behavior into the student body, ri.le lots of support from alumni or turn the student body against the "waterboy" to the point of his death (which I hear is almost a reality, unfortunately). 
What I don't understand is this: Did Mr. Laughman really make his point through all of that immaturity? I don't think so. I think Mr. Laughman is ridiculously immature (sorry, sir, I have an opinion too). 
Using kiddy words to criticize an obviously immature act by a student is still immature. If you go to work, sir, at your high and mighty job, and your peers from rival universities jeering at you bothers you so much that you feel the need to write such a hateful letter to our student body, you should seek counseling. Professional counseling. 
I, along with a number of my friends who wear clothes bought on sale at JCPenney, live in the near east side of Cleveland, Ohio, and pay out of own our pockets to go to school here. We don't appreciate your ignorance of the lifestyles of some of the students here at 
Notre Dame. Generalizing us through your critique of the "waterboy" is a shame to those of us who feel we work hard and embody the strong tradi­tion Notre Dame has laid before us. You give all the 
blame to the "water­boy" for ruining everything about 
Notre Dame you 
 love. I can respect that he destroyed some of that by his actions. However, 

sir, I must tell you now that you blew it for me. I HAD faith in all the alumni. The shame I see here is that you were ever given a diploma from Notre Dame to begin with. Please understand that I will not make the same mistake Mr. 
Laughman has made. I do not believe he is an accurate representation of alumni body on the whole. My personal experiences with alumni through summer service projects, community task forces and public relations have been overwhelmingly positive. 
I fee] that Mr. Laughman, if nothing else, docs a deep disservice to the Notre Dame alumni by the image he has created for him­self as a Notre Dame alum.

Neat places to go on campus 
While going to school here you should visit the neat places here on campus. and there are lots. The first is the big tree down by the lake that you can sit in. It used to bP. called 
Dead Dog Tree. This is because back in 1789. before the sr.hool was here. them used to be a farm here.called McWackentavern's 
Farm. 
And McWacken­

tavern's wife got Scott Little 
really lonely during 
the days, so she got 
nine dogs to keep 
her company. A just a litlle 
raccoon bit one of 
them. and soon all 
nine dogs got 
rabies. Then the farmers hung them from 
that tree to remind them ofjust bow great 
dogs are. 
Another neat place to go is out behind Carroll Hall. If you are there at the right time you can see helicopters land out on the helicopter pad. 0000000. If you've never seen a helicopter land you don't know what you're missing. It wouldn't hurt to bring some grapefruits and corn too and throw it at the propeller. 
If you're feeling adventurous. you'll visit the underwater city in St. Mary's Lake. Not many people know about it. Back when Father Edward Sorin was here, there used to be this village of tiny people that lived back in the woods. They would come out at night dressed up like opossums and steal shoes. Well. Father Sorin could only take so much of that, so he dug a giant hole and filled it with the tiny people during the day, while they were sleeping. And then he filled the hole with water that he hosed in from Lake Michigan. The tiny people, known as "Hushkins," adapted to the water and started a fantastic fantasy play land and renamed themselves the "Wetkins." Check it out. 
There are more fun activities bv the lakes. At around 2 a.m. on any night when the moon isn't showing, and it's not rain­ing, you can find a lot of geese on the dock at St. Joseph's Lake. If you find their leader, Sampson, you will be in for a pleas­ant surprise. You will know that you have found Sampson because he is the only goose that knows English. If you ask polite­ly and if you bring a lot of rope. you are in for a wild ride. Each goose will put some of the rope in their mouths and fly you up, up, up into the night sky. Look out' 
Also on St. Joseph's Lake you may run into the famous laughing duck. Late at night Ulysses gets out his inflatable chair and his inflatable TV holder and sits out on the lake watching episodes of "Seinfeld" that someone from Lewis gives him. He is quite a riot, but just listening to his funny laugh better be enough to satisfy you, because if he sees you watching him he will fly at you and bite your neck off. 
One last thing, if'you ever need to get your bike tires pumped up, there is a great place near Stepan tfolds to do it. There is an automatic pump. It looks like a minia­ture gas pump. You can also eat the air yourself I am pretty sure it is super-puri­fied air, and that you .:an raise your IQ if you eat enough. If you put the pressure on high enough ..you can also see through walls. 
For all those of you interested, the Notre Dame Sand Dollar club is going to meet starting after spring break. Have a great spring break, and remember even if you're not going some place fun or exotic. you·re only a good book away from having the time of your life!

Stanford Hall boasts a long list of familiar names. Jarious Jackson, John Merandi. Kory Minor and Bobby Howard are among those, as well as the players for the successful Bookstore Basketball team, Primetime. 
Referred to as "The Cinderblock Palace" or "Bomb Shelter," it was built in 1957, some speculate as a sort of nuclear shelter with its 18­inch thick cinderblock walls. Ask 
anyone and they'll prob­ably compare the rooms to those in a prison. And like being attached at the hip, Stanford Hall shares a lobby and a chapel with Keenan Hall. yet each has its own set of doors. Being neither an "old" dorm nor a "new" dorm, this residence hall is not considered an architectural beautv and does not possess a·ll the luxuries of Mod Quad and West Quad. Air con­ditioning exists only in a few spots snrh as the chapel, and they only recently installed laun­dry machines last year. 
However, its residents can enjoy its prime loca­tion next to L'niversity Health Services and the cadavers lying in the depths of Haggar Hall. Psychology majors and the perpetually sick would be lucky to live there. 
It is also the home of approximately 280 men. going by the nickname, 

the Stanford Griffins. They were known as the Stanford Studs until last year when they voted to change it in honor of a beloved past rector, father Robert Griffin. 
Now their rector Father Tom Gaughan leads and supports them in more ways than one. Besides emphasizing an involvement in ser­vice activities, he plays goalie for the dorm's hockey team. "He's a lively guy, a spirited dude," says hall co-president Eric Glass. 
To replace the past tradition of "Mr. Stanford," Father Tom origi­nated the After Hours Benefit Bash, 

activities, according to Glass. "It's lots of bad news for freshmen." 
It was also bad news for Father Griffin's dog, Corby, according to what seems to be the only story passed on through the years. Though, no one is sure how true it is. As the legend goes, Father Griffin owned this dog who could always be seen following him around. And then one day. some Keenan resi­dents took the dog and threw it down the trash­shoot, eventually killing it. (What a nice story to pass on.) 
In contrast, Stanford isn't particularly obsflssed with proving its pride in the faces of other dorms like those with their boasted tradi­tions and loud displays. Says junior Pete McCall,

Internet helps fans 'Get Real' 
Associated Press 
ClPar across r,yberspar.P, a message resounds; "Tho eight will be great!" 
As catch phrases go, this may not pack thf' punr.h of' "Fifty-four forty, or fight!" or even "Lose :rn pounds in 45 days'" 
But when thfl fox family drama "Get Heal" returns Wednesday at 9 p.m. EST for its eight-week. do-or-die run, a Web­rallied brigade r.alled the (ict Realists will be beating the drums as never before to save the struggling series. 
llear them? "The eight will be grPat!" 
:rhe Gel_ Healisls are the latest example of how viewers can tap the Internet to share their passion for a TV show -and ~·orge a connection wiLh that show beyond ,1ust watching it. 
"It has brought us together," savs Bob Grippo, a data processor in Elmont, N.Y., who coinPd the group's currPnt battle cry. 
The campaign began right after the show's SPept. 8 premiere. whP-n a handful of' "Get Heal" initiates logged onto its Fox­run "official" Web site. Their enthusiastic posts declared them charter fans of this multigenerational drama about the lively. oftrn troubled Green household. 
Troubled'.? The wonderful "Get Heal" was quickly in trouble. too. Crushing com­petition such as "The West Wing" and "Drew Carey" meant most Nielsen families were tuned elsewhere at that hour. It had dismal ratings and little prospect for sur­vival. 
Or did il'.? 
"A small group of us, maybe five. were going. 'Crnon. this show just cannot be ranceled'," Grippo remembers. "We became friends very fast." 
"The Internet is a great place," observes another "Get Real" fan. Beckv Thursam "ll gets people together who" ordinaril; wouldn't meet in person." 
Thursam had checked out "Get Real" only because of its star. Debrah ~~~rentino, but she immediately liked it. 
Ihe show struck a chord in me," she says by phone from East Lansing, Mich. 
,~ nu~sing major at Michigan State University and the self-taught designer of a Debrah Farentino Web site, Thursam volunteered to build a "Get Rea\" fan site. In days it was up and running (http://members. aol .com/getrealfandu b/l. 
As with scores of other sites devoted to TV series, "getrealfandub" features cast photos. an episode guide. a 200-plus membership roll

Also: lfoach out to fox execs with e-mail and petitions. 
"It's something we monitor and definite­ly pay attention to." VOWS Fox network boss Doug Herzog, who has stuck with "Get Heal," bringing it back from February Sweeps exile in part because of its Web faithful. 
"This is a small but dfldicated group," he says of the Get Realists. "They let us know there is something going on out thi>re. They helped hep hope alive." 
"H's really cool," says cast member Jesse Eisenberg, who occasionallv visits the Web sit_e ai~d gets a ki~k from reading the enthusiastic posts. With that sort of affirmation. "you can really save money on psychiatrists," he quips. 
Playing nerdy Kenny Green, the 16­year-old actor will be showcased this week when his character contracts a life­threatening illness. 13y the end of the hour, he can expect to find kudos on the "Get Real" message board. 
"I come from a theater background in New York," Eisenberg savs. "There, if the rev!ews are good, you stay open. On TV, reviews matter less; it's more about rat­ings. But if you build a fan base you can build ratings. The Web site reallv helps." 
The "Get Real" stars not only· track the efforts or the Get Realists, but also cheer them on. 
Ann:3 H~th_away (who plays Meghan, Kenny s big sister) has typed in her thank yous. and Grippo reports that Eric Christian Olsen (who plays Kenny's free­wheeling older brother Cameron) posted a message that likened the Get Realists' devotion to the unrelenting spirit of the Maccabees two thousand years ago. 
A little more recently, CBS' Western melodrama "The Magnificent Seven" spurred some 100 faithful to wage an e­mail campaign and even pony up $1,000 fo_r ~n ad in Daily Variety (" Return Wmnmg Show to Viewers!"). 
CBS heard this plea of two years ago and. indeed, the series was back on the air the following winter. Unfortunately, ~fter . t_hose .. few weeks' reprieve,

Now, boosted by its e-support, can "Get Real" finally catch on with viewers and win a second-season pickup? 
"The next eight weeks are critical," says Thursam. But as any Get Realistic will tell you, if enough watch those eight, well, that would be great!

NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 

New tournalllent sites proposed 
Huskies win 
Big East tourney 
. Bird scores 18 to lead UConn over Rutgers 
Associated Pres 
STORRS, Conn. 
Sue Bird scored 18 points as top-ranked Connecticut won its seventh straight Rig East tournament title, defeating No. 8 Rutgers 79-59 on Tuesday night. 
UConn (30-1) has won 11 regular-season titles and eight tournament championships since the 1988-89 season. The Huskies' 19 titles arc the most in the country won by any women's or men's program. Georgetown's men arc second with 13 titles. 
It was only the second appearance in the title game for the Scarlet Knights (22-7). They lost the 1998 final to UConn, 67-58, at the Louis Brown Athletic Center at Rutgers. This win gives UConn a three-game sweep over Rutgers this season. 
UConn overcame spotty shooting in the first half, hit­ting 17-of-20 from the floor for 85 percent in the second half. 
The Huskies never trailed during the game. Bird hit a 3­pointer with 17 seconds gone in the first half to kick off a 7 ­2 run, however neither team settled into an offensive flow in the half. 
Rutgers shot 28 percent, hit­ting 9-of-32. Conneticut didn't fare much better, hitting only 8-of-27 for 29 percent. They did hold on to the lead, howev­er, with 10-of-14 shooting from the foul line. 
The physical play during the game resulted in a combined 18 fouls in the first half. Tamika Williams made 8-of-12 free throws. And for nearly 10 minutes, that was all of UConn's offense. Swin Cash's layup at 15:12 was the last field goal until a Williams' layup with 5:20 left. In between, the Huskies wern 7­of-8 from the line. 
UConn got its up-tempo game untracked in the second half and cured its shooting woes with an opening 12-2 burst, hitting 5-of-6 in the first five minutes. Rutgers was 1­of-5 in the same span and had four turnovers. 
UConn's Svetlana Abrosimova, who was score­less in the first half, had eight of her 12 points in the first six minutes. Cash had 13 points and nine rebounds for Uconn. Conneticut dominated the boards, 41-27. 
UConn shut down Rutgers' Shawnetta Stewart using six different players to guard the Knights· scoring leader. She was held to just nine points in the course of the game, six below her average. 
Tasha Pointer and Usha Gilmore had 13 points apiece for Rutgers. 
Rutgers reached the final with wins over Villanova and Notre Dame. Connecticut advanced by beating St. John's and Boston College.

DES MOINES. Iowa 
The NCAA womp,n's basket­ball tournament could start having neutral sites f'or first­and second-round games as early as next season. 
A proposal to select those sites in advance has been approved by the NCAA women's basketball commit­tee and the championship committee. The proposal is now before the management council, which meets in April. 
The proposal calls for the new format to start with the 2001 tournament. 
"Certainly the management council or the NCAA board of directors could change any proposal that comes in from any sports committee," Bernadette McGlade, who chairs the basketball commit­tee, said Tuesday. "I don't know if it will stay the same, but that's what we recom­mended." 
Currently, the first-and second-round games are played in the arenas of the 16 highest-seeded teams in the tournament. Those sites are not known until pairings are announced on Selection Sunday, five days before the first games. 
NCAA officials always have been uncomfortable with that setup because of the home­court advantage, all 16 home teams advanced to the regional semifinals last year, but felt it was necessary to attract crowds. 
If the new setup is adopted, the 16 sites would be put up for bid and announced sever­al months in advance. Many 
"Eight semifinals and four finals back to back certainly is a tough day, even for the best of basketballJans. I think that is one ofthe priorities we will have the next time we nego­tiate the contract." 
Bernadette McGlade 
assistant commissioner 

of the traditional powers that draw big crowds, such as Connecticut, Tennessee and Texas Tech, likely would hid for games and still would end up playing at home. 
But games also could be placed in municipal arenas that are not the home court for college teams or they could be awarded to schools that might not make the tour­nament, thus ensuring a neu­tral court for all participants. A school could not serve as a host for more than two years in a row. 
McGlade, an assistant com­missioner for the Atlantic Coast Conference, said awarding the sites in advance would give those locations time to promote the games and draw crowds. 
"It's the same thing with football bowl games," she said. "They have no idea who is going to be in the bowl game, but ticket sales go on. They're selling to the fan. That's where we are in women's basketball. We're selling to fans. 
"There's a lot of fans of the sport out there and they're no Ion ger just going to see the home team play." 
McGlade also said that when the next television con­tract is negotiated, the com­mittee will urge that the regional semifinals and finals be played on four days instead of two. 
ESPN, which holds the con­tract through the 2002 tour­nament, shows all eight regional semifinals on a Saturday and the four region­al finals on Monday. In the men's tournament, the semi­finals are split between a Thursday and Friday and the finals between Saturday and Sunday. 
"Eight semifinals and four finals back to hack certainly is a tough day, even for the best of basketball fans," McGlade said. "I think that is one of the priorities we will have the next time we negoti­ate the contract." 
Lim DeLuca, senior vice president for program devel­opment, said that point would be negotiable. 
"When we roll up our sleeves with the NCAA women's representatives, we will deeply look at ways to increase the potential audi­ence, and one of them clearly is working on that second weekend of the tournament," Deluca said. 
Deluca noted that one rea­son the schedule evolved the way it has was to avoid com­peting with the men's games and the Academy Awards presentations. 
"Those arc two fairly signif­icant objects," he said.

An Open Letter to the Notre Dame 
Community from the University's 
Task Force on Anti-sweatshop Initiatives 
The University of Notre Dame has been the national leader on the anti-sweatshop issue for more than three years. Notre Dame was the first university to establish a code of conduct for its licensees and Notre Dame is the only university that actually has monitored facto­ries where its products are manufactured. 
More recently, Notre Dame has initiated a pilot program in Mexico and Central America that will incorporate human rights and labor activists, Church officials and other representatives of local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) into the University's monitoring pro­gram. These representatives will help to determine which factories are to be monitored, they will be active participants in the monitoring process, and they will recommend appropriate follow-up actions when problems arc found. 
The University also has adopted the strongest provision of any college or university with respect to freedom of association and the rights of workers to organize. As this provision is implemented, Notre Dame products no longer will be produced in countries such as China which provide no legal right to organize. 
This semester, the Task Force on Anti-sweatshop Initiatives is addressing further issues, notably the living wage and women's rights, and will make additional recommendations on these issues to Father Malloy. 
The most recent anti-swea_tshop issue to emerge involves the Fair Labor Association (FLA), of which Notre Dame is a member, and a proposed new anti-sweatshop organization, the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC), which the University has been asked to join. On sev­eral campuses, sit-ins have been staged on this issue, with activists demanding that the institutions withdraw from the FLA and opt instead for memhership in the proposed WRC. From the beginning, the University has adopted a broad-based, inclusive approach to anti-sweatshop organizations. In addition to becoming a member of the Fair Labor Association, Notre Dame has joined with Harvard to organize an initiative that now includes the University of California system, the University of Michigan, and Ohio State University. Notre Dame also has joined an initiative of the full Ivy Group of Schools an~ is playing a leading role in forming a consortium of colleges and universities to address the living wage issue. 
The WRC at present is in the conceptual stage. An organizational meeting is to be held in April and the Anti-sweatshop Task Force has formally requested that the WRC allow one of our student members to attend this meeting to gather information. The University will consider WRC membership in the same manner as it has considered membership in other organizations. It will consider the WRC's philoso­phy, plan of action, organizational structure, membership requirements, budgeting and staffing, and other pertinent matters. It is worth not­ing that several of the institutions which so far have agreed to join the WRC have done so "conditionally," precisely because so many aspects of the proposed organization remain to be determined. In fact, it is not even clear at this point what "conditional" membership means. 
Notre Dame will consider joining the WRC, but will need more information concerning the WRC's proposals before it can make a reasoned judgment on membership. At the same time, the University does not believe that membership in the WRC and the FLA are mutually exclusive. Nor does Brown University, which agreed to membership in the WRC while asserting that it will "remain a fully committed member of the FLA." Notre Dame chose to join the FLA after careful consideration and, since joining, has played a leadership role in its university advisory council. Carol Kaesebier, the University's vice president and general counsel, is one of the organization's founding cochairs and has been instrumen­tal in its growth to more than 130 colleges and universities. At the same time, the FLA is less than a year old and hasn't yet had time to prove or disprove its potential. The University's goal for the FLA is to see its members, including its industry members, attack the sweat­shop problem on much the same basis as the University is, and the University remains committed to achieving this goal. 
In announcing his university's decision to the join the WRC, Gordon Gee, Brown's president, said, "I am willing to have Brown join the WRC as a founding member. However, the university will remain a member only ifit becomes clear, through the further development of the consortium and the FLA. that the two organizations can operate in a complementary fashion." Should they be forced to choose between the organizations, Gee said, "We will choose the organization that makes the greatest effort to work collaboratively with the other." Given this strong statement by one of the first universities to join the WRC, there clearly is no reason for Notre Dame to believe that joining the WRC would in any way require the University to leave the FLA. 
First and foremost, Notre Dame will continue to focus its energies on its own anti-sweatshop initiatives. The initiatives already put in place by the University are well beyond the progress to date of any other college or university or organization of schools addressing the sweatshop issue. While the University will continue to investigate and pursue opportunities as a member of various groups concerned with the issue, its priority will be to carry out and expand its own efforts to strengthen its code of conduct, increase its monitoring activities, establish its pilot monitoring program, and pursue new initiatives with respect to the living wage, women's rights and other sweatshop-relat­ed concerns.

Police said the 38-year-old Dallas Mavericks forward had a blood-alcohol level of .15, nearly twice California's legal limit, when he was pulled over Dec. 22. 
After his arrest, a smiling Rodman told reporters he had a couple of beers and had no criticism for officers who stopped him.

NHL 
McSorley faces Canadian court 
Associated Press 
VANCOUVER 

Marty McSorley must now answer in a Canadian court for his stick attack on Vancouver's Donald Brashear. 
The Boston Bruins dAfense­man, one of the league's tough guys, was r.harged with one count of assault with a weapon for his Feb. 21 attack. He plans to plead innocent, his lawyer said. 
McSorlev. who will not have to appear at the hearing, would face a maximum of 18 months in jail if ronvictcd. 
'Tm disappointed," Mcsorley said in an interview with ESPN. "I'm disappointed it's going to court because I don't know if anybody really knows right now bow much I've alreadv lost." 
The ·36-year-old defenseman was suspended by the NHL for the rest of the season in the league's harshest penalty ever for an on-ice infraction. He must meet with commissioner Gary Bettman before the league will consider letting him play again. 
"I've been in cont.act with a very good lawyer in Vancouver and we were l;_rying to not have it go to court," Mcsorley said. His suspension already will cost him an estimated $72.000 in salarv. 
His Vancouve·r lawyer, Bill Smart, said he hopes for a trial date in late summer or early fall. 
Geoff Gaul, a spokesman for the British Columbia criminal justice branch, said the deci­sion to charge Mcsorley was made after a prosecutor's review and a police investiga­tion. 
The NHL said it does not agree with the move, but said it will fully cooperate with Canadian authorities. 
"We believe the league dealt with the matter quickly, deci­sively and appropriately ­and did not feel that any fur­th er action was either war­ranted or necessarv," said Bill Daly, thp, NHL's chief legal officer. 
Bruins president and general manager Harry Sinden also expressed disappointment that 
the  courts  ,vere  getting  
involvPd.  
"The  National  Hockey  

League has handed down a severe discipline in this case and we reel that was suffi­cient," he said, adding that the learn would also cooperate fullv. 
Atler McSorley hit him in the right temple, Brashear fell backward, striking his head against the ice as his helmet came off. His body twitched and blood came from his nose. He was diagnosed with the most serious kind of concus­sion and his status is to be reviewed in about a week. 
Mcsorley and Brashear, another NHL tough guy, had fought earlier in the game, and Mcsorley said he was try­ing to goad Brashear into another fight at the end of the game, a 5-2 victory by the Canucks. 
"T had absolutelv no inten­tion of hurting Donald Brashear with my hockey stick." McSorley told ESPN. "I wanted a confrontation with Donald Brasher, no different than I've done on so many other nights... It just went badly." 
Mcsorley has lasted 17 years in the league because of his ability to fight and protect his more skilled teammates. Ile had six previous suspensions in his career. 
He is best known for serving as Wayne Gretzky's protector with the Edmonton Oilers and then with Los Angeles as the two were traded together in one of hockey's biggest deals. 
Mcsorley said he has received calls of support from players in the league and liall of Famers who say they under­stand what happened and offerer! to spP-ak on his behalf. 
He told them to stay out of it because he didn't want atten­tion drawn from the game. 
"That's one thing I really feel bad about is the fact the game doesn't need a black eye, and I don't want to be the cause of it," he said in the interview. 
ft took police just over a week to investigate the slash, which was witnessed by thou­sands of fans at the game and shown repeatedly on TV high­light clips. 
"There's a lot more involved in this than just that second and a half or two seconds that the video shows," McSorley said. "I think he embarrassed me. You definitely want a rematch. You have to stand up for yourself. Our bench was challenged. Our team was challenged." 
Police have gotten involved in several previous on-ice con­flicts in the NHL. 
In the most recent, Minnesota's Dino Ciccarelli was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $1,000 in 1988 for striking Toronto's Luke Richardson several times in the head with his stick. 

Washington Capitals capture first place 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The Washington Capitals completed their improbable climb to first place, a posi­tion they haven't held this late in 11 years, by beating the Florida Panthers 4-2 Tuesday night. 
Steve Konowalchuk and Adam Oates scored first­period goals, the 13th of the season for both. Peter Bondra netted his 1 Yth and Uhf Dahlen his 11th as the Capitals built a 4-0 lead and moved two points ahead of their Southeast Division rivals with 15 games to go. 
Viktor Kozlov scored an unassisted goal late in the second and Cameron Stewart tallied in the third for the Panthers, 3-7-1 in 11 games. Pavel Bure, who leads the league with 45 goals, never got in the flow and was a non-factor for a team that played with little intensity after the first period. 
The Capitals took the lead, just 2:08 in, on their first shot. Dahlen, working down the right wing on a counter­attack, waited before deliv­ering a pass just as Konowalchuk arrived in front of the crease to slide home the puck. 
Oates was almost in the same spot when he made it 2-0, taking a pass across the crease from Joe Sacco at 13:44. 
Bondra got the third goal during 4-on-4 play at 1 :22 of the second, ripping a slap shot from the right circle off 
a  feed  from  Andrei  
Nikolishin.  
Dahlen.  an  aggressive  

force throughout the game, was rewarded with a power­play goal when he put in a rebound at 18:44 of the sec­ond. 
Olaf Kolzig made 28 saves for the Capitals. hut wasn't smooth early and survived some hairy moments. Ryan Johnson beat Kolzig with a slap shot in the first period, but the puck trickled just wide of the post. 
Kolzig, 24-4-4 in his last 32 starts, was his usual mas­terful self the rest of the way, making a nice leg save on Jaroslav Spacek's slap shot after a chaotic sequence in the second period.

saves against Chicago on Feb. 23, the last game Nashville won. 
The Blackhawks, who started a five-game road trip, had won four of five, including victories over top teams Dallas, St. Louis and Phoenix. 
Nashville moved out of last place in the Central Division, one point ahead of the Blackhawks. 
13ordeleau's short-handed tally was the only goal of the first period. He pounced on a loose puck that bounced off Chicago's Anders Eriksson and skated in alone on goalie Steve Passmore. 
Bordeleau deked Passmore to the ice and put in a back­hander. 
During a two-man advan­tage in the second period, Predators defenseman Drake Berehowsky ripped a slap shot past Passmore's glove from the top of the left cir­cle. Rookie David Legwand made it 3-0 later in the peri­od on a back-hander. 
Blair Atcheynum, formally of the Predators, made it 3-1 at 2:03 of the third with a blast that sailed by Dunham's stick. 
Chicago pulled Passmore for a sixth attacker with 1 :57 left, and had a two-man advantage after a late Predators penalty, but Nashville blocked two point shots. 
Blues 4, Coyotes 0 
Roman Turek made 16 saves to record his fifth shutout as the St. Louis Blues extended their unbeat­en streak to four with a win against the Phoenix Coyotes. 
Turek, with 35 wins, is one away from tying Curtis Joseph's team record for most in a season. Joseph set the mark in the 1993-94 sea­son.

Phoenix leads the NHL with four players with 20 or more goals, but the Rlues held the Coyotes to just two shots from the 10:00 mark of the first period through the second. Coyotes goalie Sean Burke faced 30 shots. 
Burke had the Blues shutout until Finley scored, 
7:19 into the second period with his second goal. Finley broke in 2-on-1 with Tyson Nash, and scored on a rebound on Nash's slap shot. 
With just 43 seconds left in the period, Handzus gave the Blues some insurance thanks to some nice work by Bartecko. After firing a cen­tering pass from Demitra wide of the goal, Bartecko tracked the puck down behind the net and fed 
t Handzus in front. Handzus put it over Burke for his 
, 22nd goal. 
Reasoner scored his eighth off a rebound of Dave Ellett's shot at 12:39 of the third. Young scored unassisted at 14:29.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Gonzalez, Sosa hit first spring homers 
Associated Press 
Juan Gonzalez and Sammy Sosa hit their first home runs of the spring, while Jose Canseco and Jay Buhner tried to show they've recovered from injury problems. 
Gonzalez connected for one of five homers in the Detroit Tigers' 10-7 loss to the Atlanta Braves in Lakeland 
Fla. , 
"lie just looks menacing at the plate, doesn't he?" new Tigers manager Phil Garner said. 
Gonzalez, acquired from Texas during the offseason, hit a long, two-run shot. He's been nursing a strained left hamstring. As a result. he has been used only as a designat­ed hitter this spring, and only at Joker Marchant Stadium. 
"l want to see him get to where he wants to be, which is swinging the bat," Garner said. "He doesn't need to make road trips in spring training." 
In Tucson. Ariz., Sosa home­red in a five-run fifth, but the Arizona Diamondbacks rallied for four runs with two outs in the ninth to beat the Chicago Cubs 9-8. 
Sosa's drive off the left-field scoreboard at Electric Park was estimated at 425 feet. 
In St. Petersburg, Fla., Canseco's back felt fine and he had a run-scoring single in his spring debut. 
'Tm healthy. That's my main concern." the 35-year­old designated hitter said after going 1-for-3 with a walk in the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' 3-1 win over Texas. 
Canseco sat out the first weekend of exhibition games after arriving in camp five days late. He was sidelined for six weeks following back surgery last summer. and manager Larry Rothschild is allowing him to get into play­ing shape at his own pace. 
With Ken Griffey gone, the Seattle Mariners are counting on Buhncr to become a home run threat again. He appears ready for the challenge. 
Rubner hit his second home run of the spring Tuesday to lead the Mariners over the Anaheim Angels 5-3. 
In roster moves, catcher Gregg Zaun was traded to the Kansas City Royals from the Detroit for a player to be named or cash, and pitcher Jeff Juden, unwanted by many in the New York Yankees' organization, was placed on waivers for the purpose of his unconditional release.

Yankees see slow start in spring 
Associated Press 

TAMPA, Fla. 
George Steinbrenner is hav­ing a hard time watching his New York Yankees. In fact, he can't even sit through the whole game. 
The Boss made another early exit from his box ,along with his guest, television host Hegis Philbin, as the Yankees lost to Minnesota 7-5 Tuesday night, leaving the World Series champions winless in six exhi­bition games. 
The day before, Steinbrenner ducked out dur­ing a 15-1 pasting by Cleveland. 
"Nobody likes losing. I don't like losing," Steinbrenner said at the time. "I don't like losing by the numbers we're losing by." 
These are the stats Steinbrenner has seen so far in spring training: New York has been outscored 56-21 and has not held a lead in any game. 
"Anytime they're 0-6, that kind of stands out for the Yankees," said Twins pitcher Eric Milton, who started his career in New York organiza­tion. "Anytime you see the Yankees losing, it is a little odd. But it is spring training and you can't go by spring training records." 
No need to remind the Boss that the Yankees went 14-19 last spring before rolling to their second straight Series 
"losing in spring training isn't important. It's important to make sure you play the game right."

sweep. Or to mention that Los Angeles is also 0-6 this spring. 
"I've told you guys that it's too early," the owner said dur­ing the loss to the Indians. "But pretty soon we'll be at a point where it won't be early anymore. We're not there, yet." 
"You'll know. I'll let you know," he said. "The whole club will know, believe me." 
Almost sounds like the mid­1980s all over again. That's when he used to put October­sty le emphasis on March meetings with t.he New York Mets, calling those exhibitions "pressum situations." 
The only spark this spring came in the exhibition opener when. trailing 9-0 with two outs in the ninth inning, New York brought the tying run to the plate in a 9-7 loss to Toronto. Steinbrenner attend­ed that game, too, but left before the rally. 
On Sunday, Steinbrenner watched Hoger Clemens give up five runs in 2 2-3 innings before ducking inside. Prior to the game, David Cone joked with Steinbrenner, calling his start against the Indians a "must-win," 
.C_one lasted 2 2/3 innings, g1vmg up three runs and four hits. He left after Roberto Alomar's home run. 
"Nobody wants to be embar­rassed, but it's early," Cone said. "As far as I'm concerned. the Kansas City Royals can win the Grapefruit League." 
Then again, the Royals start­ed out 0-4. 
"The record doesn't matter but how you play matters,'; shortstop Derek Jeter said, "We aren't doing anything right. We haven't hit well, we haven't pitched well, we haven't played defense well, we haven't run the bases well." 
Even though it's early, this was not the way the Yankees wanted to start out. 
Not after Darryl Strawberry was suspended. Not after Orlando Hernandez. Ramiro Mendoza and Ed Yarnall weren't healthy enough to pitch. 
And now, tlrnse six losses. 
"Am I worried about it? No" Yankees manager Joe Tor;e said before the Twins game. "Does it consume me? No. Am I going to try and do some­thing different? No." 
"Losing in -spring training is not important. It's important to make sure you play the game right. We've been a little sloppy playing the game and that bothers me."

But arbitrator Kenneth Dam ruled Friday that the NBA didn't circumvent the collective bargaining agree,rnmt when it rejected Starks' request. Because there was no circum­vention, Dam said a grievance arbitrator needed to hear the case. Dam is a system arbitra­tor. 
A grievance arbitrator is expected to hear the case sometime this week. 
Starks, never a fan favorite in Chicago after his thug-life days with the New York Knicks, has been a lightning rod for criti­cism since he took a seat on the bench Feb. 27 with tendinitis. He insisted he's in pain, but he also said he'd play through it if he was on a contending team.

Doherty didn't take the remark too seriously. 
"I don't read into it," Doherty said. "I think that he may have just had a slip. It may have been, 'Heck, I'm looking forward to next year.' I just think that we're going to do what we originally planned to do and after the season sit down and talk about what he wants to do. It's up to him." 
The marquis player and his mentor share a close bond, one that will make Murphy's decision difficult. 
"He's a huge reason [that I would stay]," Murphy said. "He's going to be a great int1u­ence on my decision because he's been in the position before about talking to people about this kind of stuff." 
Murphy's parents and his AAU coach will be key parts of the discussion. 
Another factor will be Murphy's realization of how life will change if he opts to leave for the NBA after this year. He's having fun where he's at, enjoying life with his teammates and as a college student. 
"The fact that I won't be able to have a good time with the guys on the team in the dorm," Murphy said. ''I'll be with guys that are older than mo and have families and stuff like that, A lot of people say it is a job and that college bas­ketball's a lot more fun. It's just a decision that you have to make and it's something that I'll do after the season's over." 
Murphy has developed rapidly since high school. In two years, he's gone from playing at Delbarton in front of 50 people and eating cheese sandwiches after the game to leading the blue and gold in front of a Madison Square Garden crowd. 
But is he ready for the rigor of a physically demanding 82­game NBA schedule? 
Murphy's body already takes a bruising in the Big East. But in the NBA, he'll be going up against guys who are much more muscular and more physically imposing than those at the college level. 
Another year or two of building up his frame and adding muscle would leave Murphy much better prepared to take on the hard.knocks on the road. Staying at Notre Dame would also allow Murphy to improve his defen­sive skills. the one area in which he may be lacking. 
"I think he's gotten better," Doherty said. "But I think he could be really a good defend­er. I don't think he's where I want him to be or where he wants to be defensively." 
It is a tough choice for a 20­ycar-old: stay in school in hopes of improving your game and draft status or drop out to answer the call of a possible multi-million dollar contract. 
Murphy seems better equipped to make the judg­ment than most guys his age. Ile has a strong support crew to sound off on in Uoherty, his parents and his teammates. And he's not one to jump to quick decisions, balandng the pros and cons of each possibil­ity instead. 
"Coach told me it was nice to have this kind of problem," he said, "and it is."

Tonight's game is the 13th meeting between the two teams. The all-time series is tied at 6-6, but Rutgers leads the series 5-2 since Notre Dame joined the Big East. The two teams have never met in the Big East Championship. 
"We struggled with them in the past," 
first-year head coach Matt Doherty said. 
"We didn't match up well with them last

The Irish will also be looking for their

NEW YOHK 

Irish point guard Jimmy Dillon sur­prised everybody but himself this season with his marked improvement. 
Last year, Dillon was a reserve who chalked up nearly as many turnovers as he did assists. Now a senior, Dillon holds a steady spot in the starting lineup for the first time in his career. 
"You want to say you're surprised, and I know it surprised a lot of the public," Dillon said. "But myself, it's sort of not an honor, hut a reward for all the hard work." 
And he earned it. Ile improved his stats in every area of the game this year: shooting, rebounding and most of all assists. In Hig East play, Dillon is shoot­ing 47 percent and has one of the best assist to turnover ratios in the confer­ence. 
"Jimmy's a very good shooter, but we have very good shooters on our team, and I think he enjoys setting up his teammates," head coach Matt Doherty said. "lle's just accepted his role as one to distribute the ball, play tough dnfense. play with a lot of intensity, and he's done a great job with it." 
The improvement didn't come easily. Dillon strove to increase his strength by hitting the weigh~s last summer, and competed in a league with fellow Philadelphia native Matt Carroll, a freshman guard for the Irish. 
But gaining emotional maturity was just as significant in his development as was physical maturity. Last season, Dillon went through his toughest Notre Dame experience, a one-game suspen­sion for throwing a soda bottle at a bus. 
"It was Junior Parents Weekend, and I went out and did something dumb and took my suspension from it," Dillon said. "It was a home game against West Virginia, and I went home and sat there and realized I wasn't helping my team and being a part of the game." 
The incident taught Dillon exactly what not to do, and he developed better composure both on and off the court as a result. As the team's lone senior starter, he also became the emotional leader. 
Notre Dame is also coming off an out." impressive victory over Georgetown and Rutgers is led by guard Dahntay outplayed top-seeded Syracuse in the Jones, who averages a team-high 16

"I see him as being the leader on the team," Carroll said. "If you look at the teams that have won national champi­onships and had a lot of success, usually they arc the teams that am real close on and off the court. And I think that's the way our team is." 
The coaching change from .John MacLeod to Doherty opened the door for Dillon's enlarged role for the Irish. While MacLeod had the helm, Dillon stood on uncertain ground, never sure of his place on the team. Under Doherty, Dillon plays 30 minutes per game (twice as much as last season) and directs tlrn Notre Dame offense. 
"Coach has showed some confidence in me to be a starter on this team and being a leader out there," Dillon said. "It's just different from last year because I wasn't sure how long I was going to be on the court. This year, I know he 1rneds me out there to lead the team." 
Dillon's poise allows him to act as an on-the-court coach, a role that may prove useful after graduation as he hopes to coach college basketball. 
"It's important that you have upper­classmen who can lw leaders because they've been through things that the younger guys haven't been through," Doherty said. "It's important to help motivate the team. I can only do so much. It's got to come from the playPrs." 
Winning is an attitude to Dillon, one he hopes the Irish will display in coming weeks because for him, there is no tomorrow. 
"To myself, I've always known that winning's an attitude, and it hasn't been there the past three years, and this year with Coach's mind-frame and him hav­ing us believing that we can compete with teams ... it's a whole new ballgame. We had five wins over ranked opponents this year, and nobody around would ever think that would be possible." 
Unlike the team's underclassmen, Dillon can't wait until next year for an NCAA Tournament berth. It must come now. 
"My career is winding down," Dillon said. "You kind of look and say you don't want to take basketball for granted. A loss is a loss. and a win is a win. And if you don't give it all, you know that's something you start regretting." 
We're going to come out with a lot of intensity." The winner of tonight's game takes on

Murphy sets standards, wins Big East player of year 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN A.ssisrant Sporrs Editor 
NEW YORK 

Sophomore power forward Troy Murphy set a new stan­dard for Big East excellence this season. becoming the first player ever tu lead the league in hoth SC'oring and rebound­ing. 
The conference rewarded him for his efforts Tuf'sday. honoring Murphy with an award for Big East Player of the Year prior to today's open­ing of the Big East Tournament in Madison Square Garden. 
Murphy gratefully accepted the award, but then did some­thing that really showed his character: He passed on the accoladfls, sharing his accom­plishment with first-year Notrn Dame head coach Matt Doherty and the rest of the Irish squad. 
"I couldn't have done it with­out my teammates and coach," the 6-foot-9 Murphy said. 'Tve had a great time with them. It says a lot. rt's hard for me to express. It's been a great year." 
Doherty returned the praise. 
"I wouldn't trade him for anybody," Doherty said. "He comes every day prepared to work hard. He loves the game. lie wants to be really good, and he's passionate about it. I think that he's having a heck of a year." 
He's right. Murphy's averag­ing 23 points and more rebounds per game, numbers that designate him as the only player in the nation to rank in the top 10 in both categories. With 17 double-doubles this season, Murphy has become a household name for Irish fans. 
Murphy is up for considera­tion for honors like the Wooden Award and All­American team, possibilities that boggle his mind. 
"I never expected to be con­sidered for an honor like that [All American]," Murphy said. "It was a dream back in high school. I've played for great coaches, and all the credit goes to them." 
Even Murphy's father, Jim Murphy, did not expect Troy to become so good so fast. 

"Not so early," Jim Murphy "lt's his work ethic and his said. "I thought he would hit all talent," Doherty said. "God of this when he was a junior or blessed him with size and a senior." shooting touch and an ability to 
Doherty attributed much of run and jump, and he's made Murphy's success to his hard the most of it." work. Since Notre Dame hired Doherty as head coach less than a year ago, the relation­ship between Doherty and Murphy has gone full circle. When Doherty became head coach, Murphy was less than thrilled about the replacement of former coach John MacLP.od. Now, he's Doherty's biggest fan. 

"He's changed the whole atti­tude of the program," Murphy said. "He· s taken the time to get tu know me as not only just a player, but as a person. That shows a lot about the character of him as a person." 
Doherty views the emotional connection as an essential part of being a coach. 
"As a coach, as a parent, you dream about a connection with your children," Doherty said. "When he says those things, it's very touching because I wanted the whole experience. I don't want just the basketball experience. I want tho P-mo­tional bond with my players." 
Back in high school, Murphy was interested in playing for Kansas. where Doherty was an assistant coach at the time. Although Doherty did see Murphy play. Kansas never actively recruited Murphy. 
"I saw him enough where I thought he was a good player," Doherty said. "You never know how good. There are kids I've recruited that I thought were going to be great players that weren't, and then kids that you didn't know, if they were going to be great players and turn out to be great players." 
Two years later, Murphy has proven that ·he is one of the great ones. Every coach whose team has gone up against Notre Dame has struggled to find a way to defend against Murphy, usually with little suc­cess. 
Even when Murphy is held to a sub-par performance. he still hurts the opponent. In Notre Dame's January loss to Rutgers, Murphy was whistled for a technical foul en route to fouling out, and only shot 5­for-16 from the field. 
Yet Rutgers' coach Kevin Bannon still said, "It's not like there's an answer to stopping the guy. He's too good. He can hurt you in too many ways. The guy is a human double­double. You can't name five better guys in college basket­ball right now." 
As Notre Dame prepares for tonight's rematch with Rutgers, Murphy hopes to prove Bannon's words right.

Special ro The Observer 

Chris Apple, assistant men's soccer coach at Notre Dame the last four seasons, has been named interim head men's soccer coach at t h e University of Notre Dame. 
App I c replaces !\like Berticelli, who died suddenly Jan. 25, Apple following 10 seasons as Irish head roach. 

Apple will coach the Irish men's team on an interim basis through the 2000 fall season. The University is in th(' process of searching for a new director of athletics, and that individual will have tbe opportunity to determine a direction for all Irish athletic teams. 
"I'm extremely grateful the University has shown the faith in me to oversee the Notre Dame men's soccer program," said Apple. 
'Tm also honored to follow Mike Berticelli. who was my close friend and mentor. Mike's contributions to soc­cer at Notre Dame and to the game at large have been immense, and I'm thankful simply to have an opportuni­ty to add to those." 
Apple has been extensively involved in recruiting in his four seasons at Notre Dame. He played a key role in the signing of l 999 Big East rookie of the year Erich Braun, a freshman from Frankfurt. Germany, who fin­ished third in the conference in scoring in '99, as well as Andreas Forstner, a fresh­man from Gerlinden Germany, who ranked as on~ of the top first-year defend­ers in the Big East in '99. 
Apple's four seasons with the Irish saw Notre Dame produce a combined 41-:n­10 record (.561), including trips to the Big East men's soccer tournament each of his four years on the staff. His first season at Notre Dame in '96 featured the most successful season in Irish history, including a 14­7 -2 record and an NCAA first-round victory over sec­ond-ranked North Carolina­Greensboro. The Irish fin­ished 17th that season in the final Soccer America poll. 
Apple came to Notre Dame in the spring of '96 following two seasons as head coach at North Carolina Wesleyan, where his teams finished 12­20-1 combined during the 1994 and '95 campaigns. 
A standout midfielder at the University of Rochester, Apple led his team to three University Athletic Association championships and three NCAA tournament appearances during his four­year career. lie was a two­time All-American at the school and three times earned all-UAA honors. In 1990, he was named the con­ference player of the year. 
A 1992 cum laude graduate of Rochester with a bachelor of arts in German literature and European history, the Millersville, Pa., native played professionally in Germany for one year follow­ing graduation. Apple then served as an assistant coach at Harvard for one season in '93 before tak.ing over as head coach at North Carolina Wesleyan. 
Apple, who played profes­sionally in the United States for the Haleigh Flyers, holds a National Soccer Coaches Association of America advanced national diploma and a United States Soccer Federation "B" license. 
Born April 9, 1970, he and his wife Melissa were mar­ried in May 1997 and reside in South Bend. She currently is a doctoral student in psy­chology at Notre Dame.

Irish seek first-ever Big East tournament victory 

,._ 
By NOAH AMSTADTER Sports W ricer 
The Notre Dame baseball team cashed in on the unsea­sonably warm weather Tuesday by posting a 5-1 win over visiting Manchester College at Eck Stadium. 
Sophomore right-hander Matt Buchmeier (l-0) was credited with the first win of his Irish career, after opening the game with three scoreless innings in a planned rotation. BuchmeiPr allowed just one hit and one walk while strik­ing out two of the 11 Spartans batters he faced. 
The highlight of the day came in the top of the ninth, as junior right-hander Danny Tamayo made his first appearance in more than two years. Tamayo, who last pitched on March 1, 1998, before suffering an elbow injury that ultimately required "Tommy John" reconstructive surgery, retired Tony Hardiman on a bunt attempt before serving up a flyout from Rill Johnson. 
Pinch hitter Nick Chaney then walked on four pitches but Tamayo closed out the game by catching Craig Hersey looking at a full-connt, called third strike. 
Notre Dame (5-2) failed to generate any sustained offense, just days after amass­ing :37 hits in three games in the Hormel Foods Classic (at the Minneapolis Metrodome). The Irish managed just six hits on Tuesday, with sopho­more designated hitter Paul O'Toole hitting a solo home run in the third, while rresh­man right fielder Brian Stavisky ended his early slump with two hits in four at­bats.

NEW YORK 

Notre Dame's impressive 23-point victory over Georgetown last weekend was a relief for sophomore captain Troy Murphy after watching his team drop three straight games down the stretch. But it was the news after the game that really made his <lay.

of the year"

Murphy, who hails from Morristown, N.J., was page21heavily recruited by Rutgers and takes a fair share of verbal abuse every time the Irish play the Scarlet Knights on the road. 
''I'm happy to have another shot at Rutgers," Murphy said about the first-round match up. 'Tm looking forward to that." 
And so are the rest of the Irish. Notre Dame suffered its worst defeat of the season at the Louis Brown Athletic Center in mid­January and will be looking to avenge that 25-point loss. 
Hutgers freshman Todd Billet led the way for the Scarlet Knights with 31 points on eight 3-point field goals while Mike Tompson and Eugene Dabney each grabbed 10 rebounds for Rutgers. 
"I guess we've got another shot at them," said freshman shooting guard Matt Carroll, who averages nearly 10 points per game. "Hopefully we can change it !ind have a dif­ferent outcome from the last game." 
"I don't think we could have played any worse and I don't think they could have
