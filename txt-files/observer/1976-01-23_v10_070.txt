0-C: Security impossible? 
by Paul Stevenson 
Staff R rt epo er 
Burglaries over the semester break found many students lacking insurance coverage and not fully protedcd. 
However, some of these students were covered by their parents' policies. Many parents have an off-premises clause in their insur­ance policy that insures any family member a certain percentage of their insurance. For example, if a student's parents' home were in­
sured for $30,000, one-half of that or SIS,OOO is considered personal property. The student is then tnsured for ten percent of his parent's personal property,or $JSOO. 
Insurance rates for those who live off-campus are determined by cer­tain criteria, such as construction of the house or apartment, location

Pettit, a senior government major, is serving as Rules Chairperson and Coordinator of Physical Prepara­tions for the convention. 

Also present at the interview was Co-Chairperson Vincent Mos­chella, a junior government major from Grosse Pointe Woods, Michi­
gan. Moschella explained that the Mock Convention has beer. held everv for years since 1940 (except­ing 1944 due to the war), and is traditionally in the name of the opposition party as opposed to the party in power. Formerly under the direction of the late Professor Bartholemew of the government department, this year's convention is being run with the help of Asst. Prf. Carleton Sterling of the same department.

EDITOR' NOTE:Thls Is the second story In a three-part series Investi­gating the policies for the admls· slon of women and minorities Into undergraduate coUeges and univer­sities. The first story covered the admissions policies for admitting minorities to the University. 
by Patrick Cole Staff Reporter 

In 1966, Notre Dame admitted only 12 minority students --all blacks -· to the University. Now almost ten years later, minorities comprise six percent of the student body. 
Since 1970, when Notre Dame broke a 45-year ban on postseason football appearances to gain rev­enue for minority student aid, the Univbersity has been striving to increase the number of ethnic minorities in the student body. 
Daniel J. Sracino, associate dir­ector of admissions, holds the responsibility of administering to lthe needs of minority applicants to 
Notre Dame. "The University be­
lieves strongly in the importance of 
encouraging applications from 
these men and women," he stated. 
''As an institution founded on 
Christian ethics, the University is 
responsible to a context much 
larger than Notre Dame." 
The University's $3 million en­
dowment fund has helped to bring minority students to Notre Dame. The University's initial commit­ment began in the fall of 1970 when Notre Dame used the receipts 'of the 1969 Cotton Bowl to aid 41 ethnic minorities totaling $40,600 
renewable for four years. 
This year, 59 students received 

grants from the University's en­
dowment fund. Twenty-seven of 
the minorities who were Notre 
Dame Scholars received scholar­
ships to enable them to meet their 
expenses. Five of the 105 minority 
freshmen received Reserve Officer 
Training Corps (ROTC) scholar­
ships, and 11 black freshmen 
received National Achievement 
Scholarships, an increase of six over last year. Saracino indicated that one black freshman, who is a Notre Dame Scholar, is a Holy Cross Seminarian. His tuition is covered by the Congregation of the Holy Cross. 
"That so many of our new students were able to receive financial assistance without need­ing aid from our $3 million endow­ment fund played a large factor in bringing as many new minority students to Notre Dame as we have," Saracino remarked. "With· out the University's commitment in this area, . many would not be currently members of the 1975 Notre Dame Freshman Class." 
Minority enrollment 

With only 12 minority students admitted to Notre Dame in the 1966-67 academic year, 29 were admitted in the 1967-68 school year. In 1968-69, 23 more minority freshmen came to Notre Dame. Thirty-seven minority group fresh­men enrolled in Notre Dame during the 1969-70 school year, and 76

the presidential and vice-president­ial candidates and the formulation of a party platform. 
According to Moschella, last spring volunteers began the conven tion 's executive committee. 
The committee includes Co-Chair person Nancy Brenner, Campaigns Coordinator Harry Capadano, 
Speakers Coordintor Patrick Buckley, Credentials Chairperson James Reynolds, Publications Ed­itor Eleanor Popken, Treasurer William Hillstron and Press Secre­tary Mark Frieden, Moschella, Pett­it and Littlefield. 
The group contacted speakers, began the physical preparations, assembled delegates, formed 
committees  and  began  work  on  
publicity last fall.  
Pettit  explained  the  physical  
preparation  as  dealing  with  the  

floor plan. sound systen, crowd control measures and existing facili 
ties. 

"We want to do a professional job because of the national press coverage and the prominent guest speakers, but limited funds pose a problem," Pettit said. "We're trying to make as much as possible of the materials owned by the University and of volunteer student labor. We have been fairly successful thanks to the coopera­tion of student activities and the maintenance department," stated Pettit in a comment on the state of his preparations. 
Littlefield later explained the development of the platform from the formulation of his committee to the ratification procedure. Little­field, Moschella and Prof. Bruce Larson of the Philosophy depart­ment established a format which includes four sections: Economic Development, Social Development, Internal Government Development and Foreign Policy. 
Under these sections are includ­ed 33 seperate planks (issues). Sixty volunteers formed the Plat­form Committee and selected planks on which to submit personal opinions. These statements will be submitted to a screening commi­ttee which will review them and select the most representative and well-written to recommend to the actual voting platform committee. 
The convention rules require that each state have a vote on the platform. States not included in the original 60 volumes will send a representative to the platform vote. 
This voting body assemble the platform by planks consisting of either a single submitted opinion or parts of several to create accurate representation. 
"The purpose of this plat­form is to serve as a document of the general public opinion of the students of Notre Dame--St. Mary's , " said Littlefield. "The platform. after its ratification at the convention, will be distributed to numerous politic­ians across the country as well as to the national committees of both parties.'' 
"In this manner," he continued, "we hope to have some effect on the policy-making processess in the up-coming election. I would like to explain that this is not a platform of the Democratic Party, but rather the expression of the political feelings of the students them­selves," stated Littlefield to clarify the nature of this particular plat­form. 
Littlefield explained that the document will go to the convention for ratification after its assembly by the voting body of the platform committee. The plank by plank vote will occur on Thursday night, March 4th, at the convention. 
Challenges and minority reports will be heard at this time, accor· ding to Littlefield. A "Nay" on a plank will necessitate its replace­ment by a statement approved by the chair. 
The completed platform will stand as representative of the political feelings of the student body in the election year 1976, emphasized one delagation chair­person.

Committee evaluates Burtchaell as Provost

-·-· t 
by Bob Brink Staff Reporter 

A special committee of the Academic Council is currently re­viewing Fr. James T. Burtchaell, University Provost, in accordance with Article II, Section I, of the Academic Manual. The manual requires that an evaluation be made of the provost every five years. 
The Academic Council elected this reviewing committee on Dec. 3, 1975. The committee consists of Chairman James Massey, profess­or of electrical engineering, Gerald Jones, professor of philosophy, 0. Timothy O'Meara, professor of math, Edward Manier, associate professor of philosophy, and Rob· ert M. Panoff, a junior physics major. 
The Academic Manual, although clearly outlining the purpose and composition of the committee, of­fers no guidelines on how the committee should conduct the re­view. As a result, the committee members have established their own guidelines concerning the evaluation method to be followed.

The review procedure, as outlin­ed by the committee's open letter, is essentially a three-fold process. First, the committee is accepti~~g any signed letter from the Notre Dame faculty and students per­mance of Fr. Burtchaell. Secondly, after considering the letters and confidentially interviewing certain individuals, the committee will write a report. Finally, they will submit the report to Fr. Hesburgh. 
According to Prof. Massey, con­fidentiality is an essential aspect of the committee's procedure. "The main reason for being confiden­tial," Massey stated, " is to stop rumors of what the committee is doing." 
"We want to make it clear that if anyone reports what the committee is doing, beyond what the commit· tee has publicly announced," he continued, "you will know they are simply guessing because they could not have obtained that infor­mation from a committee mem­ber." 
Massey added that public an­nouncements by the committee, besides the open letter to The Observer and a similar letter distributed to all faculty members on Jan. 7, include the disclosures that the committee will interview certain people whom they feel will be able to provide pertinent infor­

Commenting on the idea of confidentiality with respect to the committee's report, Massey stated, "What we would not do would be to give an entire letter, or include information that could only have come from one person, unless we have the explicit permsission of the person to do so. " 
Massey also commented that the

the observer 
letters to a lonely God 
the umbrella of saluation 



Last Fall, a clean-cut young type of Bible-reading Christian showed up in my bedroom one Saturday afternoon when I was trying to take a nap. I hadn't invited him in, though I had heard his knock on the door. Often on Saturday afternoons when I am napping, I ignore knocks on the door. I think to myself: "It's just the kid down the hall wanting to borrow a glass of gin. I never lend gin, but why break the kid's heart by telling him so?" Such logic, though completely unrelated to the truth, is very satisfying to a conscience in search of slumber. 
But zeal in some Christians is a bolder 
tonic than the need for toddies. This 
head-strong disciple of salvation crashed 
through the unlocked door of my room. 
Seeing me view him slit-eyed from my 
position on the pillows with blankets pulled 
up to my chin, he decided to join me in the 
bedroom. 
Introducing himself as a theology stud­ent from a nearby denominational college, he said "I'm looking for the chaplain that lives in this room. Arc you the chaplain who lives here?" 
I considered telling him that I was a passing hobo that the chaplain had lent out his bed to. Then I decided it was dumb for him to have doubts whether it was the chaplain who was occupying the chaplain's bed. 
"I'm Father Griffin. I live here," I said. "If there's another chaplain living here, he never shows up in this bed." 
We shook hands, and I could see him 
noting the crucifix over the bed and the 
flowered sheets. It will give him something 
to talk about back in the seminary, 1 
thought to myself. I wished I had been 
wearing my hair shirt. I suggested we adjourn to the chairs in the adjoining room. St. Athanasius would never have dealt with the Arians in his bedroom, I thought, nor St. Dominic with the Albigensians. Lying on one's back in bed is not the best position for dealing theologically with heretics. 
Once seated, he said: "I used to be a Catholic." "Good," I said politely. "I used to be a Protestant." "In high school," he said, "I stopped believing in anything." 
"In high school," I said, "I started believing in everything." "Then, one night," l:e said, "l found Jesus in a bar room." "Doubtlessly knocking back the Manis­chewitz," I thought to myself. 
"I acceptec! Christ as my personal Saviour, and I received His Word as a lamp unto my feet." 
"Perhaps someday," I said meaningfully, "you'll find the grace to come all the way back to the Sheepfold and the Shepherd." He understood that I was qualifying my enthusiasm for his religious conversion. 
"I guess," he said, "it's the Bible versus the Church."

~dog day' worthwhile 
If ever you find yourself roaming around the Memorial library with nothing better to do than sit in the lobby, smoke, or socialize, you might wander into the Microfilm Room and look up the Thursday, August 24, 1972 issue of the New York Times. In the upper left hand corner of the front page, just under a headline which reads: NIXON ASKS SUPPORT FOR A 'NEW MAJORITY' AFTER AGNEW IS RENAMED AS RUNNING MATE", lies a not totally unrelated story of an equally bizarre nature. The first paragraph reads, in part: 
a 14-hour ordeal for seven bank employees held hostage by a distraught homosexual and his 18-year-old accomplice ended just before sunrise yesterday when •.. 
Ah, when indeed? That is something 
you'll have to ascertain for yourself by (a) 
reading the rest of the aforementioned 
news article (b) looking the coverage of this 
incident in a story in the September 22, 
1972 issue of IJfe Magazine or (c) 
attending a fairly faithful re-creation of the 
Life article in the movie Dog Day 
Afternoon, currently playing at the Scotts­
dale Theater. It is the film that is the major 
concern here. 
Basically, the plot for Dog Day After­
noon can be well understood from the 
Times excerpt. Sonny (played by AI 
Pacino), a 28-year-o1d Vietnam vet of the 
gay persuasion, and Sal (played by John 
Cazale) an ex-convict of the heterosexual 
persuation are marginal acquaintances 
who meet in a bar and decide to rob a 
Brooklyn bank. While Sal's motivation is 
undoubtedly economic enrichment, 
Sonny's share of the take is intended to be 
used to get a sex change for his male 
"wife," hence the Times' specific mention 
of his homosexuality. 
The duo, plus a youthful cohort who cops 
out, so to speak, as the robbery takes 
place, enter the bank in broad daylight and 
exert control over the bank employees, 
only to find that a paltry $2000 for their 
efforts. As Sonny and Sal are about to 
depart from the bank. the phone rings , the 
bank manager answers it and announces 
that the call is for Sonny. The caller 
happens to be Detective Moretti who is 
gazing at him through the window of a 
shop across the stree. It is at that point, as 
they say, that the drama unfolds. 
The 14-hour interlude is highlighted by the exchanges beVween Sonny (who can ~orne outside to negotiate while Sal 
pat small 
remains inside with a rifle) and the cops and the crowd. At one point, Sonny gets fairly frustrated at having a hundred guns pointed at him while trying to reach an agreement with the police and begins chanting "Attica! Attica!" to the delight of the rather freakishly-portrayed crowd. 
The reactions between the· bank em­ployees and their captors run through the bulk of the movie. For the most part, the action in the bank is true to the account expressed by one of the clerks, in the Times: sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and generally, believe it or not, unthreat­ening. However Sidney Lumet has a penchant for portraying policeman as villains of sort ' (he directed Serpico) and conversely makes their adversaries the logical heroes or anti-heroes, in the case Sonny and Sal. One critic of this movie John Landau of Rolling Stone, accused th~ picture of "substitutin~ victims for heroes," 
and oerh:10s h~ is right. 

Perhaps the most impressive moment of the film occurs during the scene when Sonny's male wife Leon (also had an estranged female spouse and two child­ren), played by Chris Sarandon, is being questioned by the detective. He responds to the questioning with what must be at least a five-minute monologue, detailing the sadness and suffering in his life in a pathetically exquisite manner while enter­tainine an audience of leering policemen. 
. Actually, as Leon's monologue easily wtthstands the test of film-time, so also does the entire cast make feasible and entertaining a movie which yet is largely devoid of so-called "action shots" and thankfully, violence. It runs over two hours. While, as in Serpico, Lummet's "message is a little heavy-handed and a bit unsubtle (Sonny's "Attica" chant in the latter case and the absolute evil aura permeating FBI agent Sheldon-played by James Broderick-in the former case), his directoral talents coupled with overall stellar performances by the cast make this film, at the very least, quite worthwhile. 
Finally, Lumet and screen-writer Frank Pierson must be given credit for their adaptation of this true-to-life story. Except for one rather significant break with the story--the character of Sal being portrayed as older than Sonny when actually he was 18 years old--and some minor additions to the script (Sonny was never remembered chanting "Attica") the film stays true to the actual event. And that's something you seldom see in a movie as successful as this. ·It's a film that shouldn't be seldom se~n. J 
Reverend Robert Griffin 
"I wouldn't agree to that at all," I said. "The Bible belongs to the Church. The community of believers we call the Church existed for years before the Gospel was put into writing. It was centuries before the authentic documents were authoritatively gathered into the collection of books we call the New Testament. It was the Bible that depended on the Church for its existence; 
not the other way around." 
I was filled with a lot of smart talk that afternoon. In my own mind at least, I won all the arguments, and it wasn't very hard to do. It is no great credit for a middle-aged priest to be able to out-talk a college student, especially if the priest himself once walked the way of the Bible Christian. 
I spoke of the Church I had been converted to thirty years ago. There was a faith that could be spread, it seemed, like an umbrella of salvation over all mankind. The world seemed so simple in 1944-5. There were the Nazis, crushed and humiliated by military defeat. There were the Communists, sinister, terrifying, and threatening. There was the Catholic Chu­rch: tender enough to be a mother; young enough to be a bride; holy enough to be God's presence, sanctifying the earth with Bible, sacrament, Eucharist, Mass; splen­dor of the Comforter, image of the Word; Christ reigning over history through His vicar on earth. 
Finally, wearied by it all, the young man arose to go. He said to me: ''When I came in here all I really wanted to do was share my faith in Christ with you. Jesus has given me the power to change my life. He has taken away my sins. He has made me a new creature. He has given me a peace and joy I never felt before. Perhaps he has given you a peace and joy, but I've never heard Catholics talk that way. I've never had a priest tell me that Jesus Christ could give me the power to change my life; that through Him I could be born again. All that the priest ever told me was that I had to go to Mass, and that if I had bad thoughts, I couldn't go to Communion ... " 
He paused, and there were tears in his eyes, and I did not yet understand why. 
"I'm twenty-four years old, and I'm ·just beginning college. As a new-born creature in Christ, I'm just an infant. My teeth are not even ready for the strong meat of the Gospel, because as a born-again Christian, I've not even been weaned. But still, I wanted to share my faith with you, and my joy in the Lord. I thought it might help you, dealing with all these young people as a Notre Dame chaplain. I bet most of them don't know anything about dying in Christ and rising to new life with Him ... 
He paused again, and now I was the one who was feeling bad. 
"You gave me a lot of things to think about. Maybe what I've got isn't as good as what you've got, but it's more real to me than anything I ever had before. I just wanted to share it, because if I don't have it, I've got nothing, and I'd just be some sad-eyed drunk standing around a bar room. Maybe I don't understand the Bible, Father, but are you sure the Pope understands the Bible? Are you sure the priests understand the Bible? If I don't understand it, how come reading it makes me so happy? Ifthey do understand it, how come it doesn't make them happy?" 
He finally broke off. ''I'm sorry," he said. "I just wanted to share Jesus." He

left the room. I yelled after him to come back, but he merely waved at me without turning his head. 
Two weeks later, he sent a note thanking me for talking with him. Inside the envelope was a religious tract entitled: "The·Only Name Under Heaven By Which Man Can Be Saved." 
For a while after that, I started locking my door on Saturday afternoons when I take naps; I was afraid of being invaded again as I slept. Then, afraid that the Bible-reading young Christian wouldn't come back, 1 started leaving my door unlocked again. 
"Who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?" asks Lady Macbeth. And who would have thought that the young Christian could bruise so easily? One of the great tensions of faith, it seems to me, is that we shollld believe faith enough so that we will live for it, love it enough so that we will die for it, and be polite enough with it so that, when it is under attack, we will talk about it as though it were merely a personal opinion that we are quite detached from. 
The lessons of this little episode arc quite obvious, but there is one question I am still asking myself. Why did I share a faith in a Church that has been since modified by the changes of over thirty years? Is it because every religious faith is composed, among other things. out of our hopes and dreams? Is that why faith can eventually turn to cynicism and despair, when our hopes and dreams are disappoin­ted? 
"We were hoping," said the disciples on the road to Emmaus, "that Jesus was the man to liberate Israel." 
Or is it because God intends for us to understand that it is as true of His Church as it is of Himself--that we know more what He is not than what He is? So that after thirty years, I am approaching the mystery of the Church? 
One should really be very careful of the points he is dogmatic about when he talks to Bible-reading Christians who awake him from his nap on Saturday afternoons.

Only area college picked 



St. MaryS named as Bicentenial college 
by Marti Hogan Asst. St. Mary's Editor 
The National American Revolu­tion Bicentennial Administration (NARBA) has named St. Mary's a Bicentennial College, making it the only Michiana-area college with the right to fly the Bicentennial Flag. Indiana Govenor Otis Bowen will present the flag along with a bicentennial certificate to St. 
Mary's President, John M. Dug­gan, in a ceremony March 5 in Stapleton Lounge. 

"We applied to the American Revolution Bicentennial Adminis­tration since we were qualified," said Dr. Jack J. Detzler, chairman of St. Mary's Bicentennial Commi­ttee. 
''The administration reviewed us in three categories: Heritage '76 concerns what we've been in the past, Festival U.S.A. concerns our great celebrations for this bicen­tennial year, and Horizons '76 concerns what we're looking for ip the future," Detzler explained. 
"Involvement with the commun­ity was an important aspect of our being considered," Detlzer said. "Increasingly, monies from differ­ent commissions are not for activi­ties confined to campus so they should include people from town,'' he added. 

The South Bend community is planning a bicentennial pageant for July 4, and St. Mary's music department is cooperating by making the choral groups avai!~,ble for recordings, Detzler said. "This way even though the students won't be here during the summer, they will still be a participating," he added. 
A Bicentennial College must also plan activities and programs of lasting value, Detzler explained. "The St. Mary's Board of Regents has authorized a history of the college which is being prepared by Sr. Mary Immaculate, C.S.C.," he said. Also, Sr. M. Capion Kuhn, C.S.C., will trace the history of the Holy Cross Sisters in North Ameri­ca from 1840-1940, and will micro­film these historic records. 
St. Mary's is also planning a Williamsburg dinner, recreating colonial times, for which it received a $1,000 grant from the NARBA. "The dinner will include colonial­type food and colonial music and costuming," Detzler said. "How­ever , it is now only in the planning stages." 
The dinner, which will be held in the St. Mary's coffeeshop for three consecutive days, is open to

students, faculty, administration and the South Bend community. The cost of the dinner is $6.75 a person. 
St. Mary's is also in conjunction with Notre Dame and several South Bend cultural organizations, including the Indiana Historical Society and Daughters of the American Revolution, in sponsor­ing a bicentennial program entitl­ed ''An Almost Chosen People: The Moral Aspirations of Ameri­cans." This bicentennial celebra­tion will run March 7-12. 
Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) is slated to open the festival followed by scholarly presentation and discussion groups featuring national scholars. The program will also include colonial music and drama presentations presented by the combined college-university drama department. These presen­tations will include readings from American literature concerning ar­eas related to the Bicentennial. 
"Every evening of the festival will feature a major cultural e­vent," Detzler stated. "The first night will feature the South Bend Symphony at the Morris Civic Center. The Center holds 2,5000 and 1,000 free tickets will be available," he added. The follow­ing events, to be announced, will be in St. Mary's O'Laughlin Aud­itorium and will free to the public. 

"We're inviting all Indiana coll­ege presidents and Catholic college presidents from the surrounding states," Detzler said. "This designation is a great tribute." 
Detzler was appointed chairman of the St. Mary's Bicentennial Committee when it was organized in the spring of 1974. Also on the committee are Sr. Maria Assunta Werner, C.S.C., professor of reli­gious studies, Dr. Elizabeth Noel, professor of English, Susan Stev­ens, chairperson of the St. Mary's music department, Anita Boorda, member of college community rela­tions council, Mary Beth Conlon and Susan Civita, student repre­sentatives. 
"We've been working on this for a long time," Detzler said, "and 
we're pleased about this designa­
tion. We're honored to be the only Catholic college included on the list 
of nine Indiana schools to receive the bicentennial designation," he added. 
Other Indiana colleges and uni­versities honored by the NARBA are Rose-Hulman Institute of Tech nology, Ball State University, In­diana-Purdue University, Purdue­North Central, Vincennes Univers­ity , University of Evansville, Taylor University and Valparaiso University.

Irish, ACC crowd, take on UCLA 
by BiD Brink Sports Editor 
When John Wooden retired last year from his legendary position as the head basketball coach at UCLA, he said he wanted to leave his successor some pretty good play­ers. He might have added that whoever it was that got the job would need them to beat Notre Dame in South Bend.

Well, former Illinois coach Gene Bartow got the job, and he's about to find out what it was besides old age that turned Wooden's hair gray. ~ Because college basketball's finest non-conference rivalry replays to­

history of the game. Two years ago in South Bend the Irish pulled off a spectacular 71-70 upset victory over the Bruins, overcoming an 11 point deficit in the last three minutes to break UCLA's 88 game winning streak. Last year, NP did it again by downing the Bruins 84-78. Bartow's job is to break tradition. 
What he'll be up against is more than just a fine Irish basketball team. The ACC crowd on Bruin day has become legendary, aweing even the great Wooden himself. It stacks up as about five against twelve thousand, and even Jimmy the Greek would hesitate to pick UCLA at those odds. 
"The crowd is the greatest," says Irish coach Digger Phelps. "We rise for it. This is the student's game and everyone in the country knows it. It's always the students' game." 
Yet, as always, UCLA comes into South Bend with another power­house team. The Bruins sport a 14-2 record (after last night's win over Santa Barbara) and -hold seventh and eighth places in the national rankings. They are 3-1 in the grueling Pacific-8 conference. Their two losses are to top-ranked Indiana in their season opener, and to Oregon State two weeks ago. 
The defending national cham­pions are already one up on the Irish, having handed them a 86-70 defeat three weeks ago in Pauley Pavilion. "We probably played our best game of the year in beating Notre Dame," says -Bartow of the first contest, "and we'll have to play even better to be in the ball game Saturday." 
As alwavs, the Bruins have the players to do so. Forward Richard Washington paces UCLA with 21 points and nine rebounds per game. At the other forward is 6-6 Marques Johnson, who is hitting for a 15 point scoring average, and leads the team in rebounds with a 
9.4 average. Seven foot Ralph Drollinger anchors down the center position and is scoring at a 10.5 ppg. clip. 
At guard, erratic Andre McCar­ter seems to have found a groove lately, having turned in a career­high 26 points against Stanford last week. At the other guard is Ray Townsend, a recent starter whose amazing outside shooting earned him 19 points in a stunning performance against the Irish ear­lier this year. Bartow has a considerable amount of talent on the bench too, most notably Jim Spillane and Brad Holland at guard, and Gavin Smith at forward. 
"UCLA is as powerful as ever as far as personnel," says Phelps. "They're all individually great players. We'll have to be ready. They beat us from the outside last time, we couldn't stop them the way they shot. We'll have to play tough defense and hit the offensive

1.!wre will never be another college basketball game Ekl'it again. For January 19, 1974 was to come and go just like any other day. Only what was to happen in between would linger in the minds of many for a long, long time. 
It seems so long ago. But while standing on the floorboards of the ACC, the memory of Notre Dame's 71-70 upset of UCLA slowly begins to come back. With thought, the spirit begins to prevade the empty arena, the adrenlin begins to flow and the fuzzy picture becomes vividly clear. 
The week of practice before UCLA was an intense one. Digger Phelps drove his players hard, shouting instructions, snarling when things did not go right and emphasizing to one and all the importance of what was to come. 
Notre parne. was 9-0. They were awe~orne .. T~ey had won In lndtana and beaten Ken.tucky m Lomsv~lle. Center John Shumate was the leadmg s~orer. Dwtght Clay and Gary Brokaw were the htghly capable guards. Steady Gary ~ovak was at forward and the superb freshman Adnan Dantley was the other 
forward.

YV_e re gomg to ?o It, Peter Crotty flatly
exclatrned. "We're gomg to beat UCLA." The date was January 18. Crotty was walking over to practice, the final cram before the big test. He and his teammates knew something few would dare to believe. Tomorrow Crotty would be crowned a prophet. · 
One by one they entered the locker room on the morning of January 19. Shumate, the man who was known to the rest of the team as "BigDaddy," could be seen in the middle of the room, boogying· to the blaring soul music. He had brought out his best tapes 
• 
for this one. . "I got up real early," Shu exclaimed. "I looked out !? the hall and nobody wa~ up Yt;t· ~ yelled rea! loud, 
Hey people, wake up! Its Brum time! But I rn not worried. The students will do their job." The music suddenly stopped. ''All right,'' Phelps tells them i~ a low voice, "let's go to work." . 
A few rnmutes before noon, Phelps says his last 
parting words and his troops stalk out to ~eet the 
enemy. Notre Dame, the 11,343 crowded mto the had waited for this moment for a long time. 

The Irish hang close for the four minutes of the 
game. Then with Dave Meyers hitting his first five 
field goal attempts and Pete Trgovich streaking past 
Brokaw for two easy lay-ups. UCLA led, 25-14 with 
just over ten minutes played. They were to lead again 
at the half, 43-34. 
The Bruins were out first after the intermission. 
They were taking their warm-up shots when the PA 
announcer let the crowd know the Bruins had over 70 
per cent from the field. ''Wait till they see what we do 
in the second half," laughed Bill Walton. 
With five minutes gone in the half, Brokaw's 15 
footer rims the basket. It would have tied the score at 
45 all. Quickly the Bruins take charge and reel off 
nine unanswered points. 
The clock ticks down. 3:22 left in the game. The 
Bruin advantage stands at 70-59. Notre Dame was 
dead. Ironically it was a man named Digger who still 
believed in resurrections. 
"You still can win," he franticly emphasized. 
"Spurt time can win it. Don't give up." 
Ten Irish points later, Brokaw holds the ball, trying to find a way to score as the final thirty seconds was away. Two key Bruin mistakes and two Irish steals had set the stage for the photo finish. 
"I saw Dwight open in the corner," Brokaw remembered. Clay took the Brokaw feed and in one sweeping motion put it up form the right corner. "I knew we had to have it " Dwight said. 
. . . ' _ . 
Sw~sh. The buildmg tr~rnbled with the cheers of the trmrnphant. Twenty-nme seconds later the game was really over.

The next day, following practice, the Notre Dame players circled around Phelps, just as they did after every other work out. They put their hands together and Phelps asked, "Number one?" "Notre Dame " carne the response. ' 
His face showed the distinct smile of satisfaction. 
"The first time ever " he beamed. 
The lights fade oui. The picture darkens. But the 
memory of January 19, 1974 will live on forever.

Irish icers travel north to battle Minnesota-Duluth 
by Paul Hess 
Since March of 1972, the Fight­ing Irish hockey squad has had pretty good luck against this week's opponent---the Bulldogs of Minnesota~Duluth. In the six games played since, Notre Dame has won five and tied one, and Irish mentor Lefty Smith and his boys hope the pattern holds in this crucial series, which opens tonight at 9:00 in Duluth. 
It won't be easy for a couple of reasons. First, the Bulldogs are corning off one of their finest performances of the season, a rousing 3-2 win over Wisconsin Saturday night. Second, the UMD club has a well-earned reputation for being next to invincible at horne, as their 10-4 record thus far this season in the cozy confines of the 5700-seat Duluth Arena readily attests. 
Only an unenviable road record (2-8 so far) has kept the seventh­place Bulldogs from making a serious run at the WCHA regular season crown. Still, Coach Gus Hendrickson's troops are right in the thick of the battle for fourth place (as are the Irish) and the resultant home ice advantage in the playoffs that accompanies it. 
Whereas the Bulldogs are corn­
ing off one of their best efforts, the 
fifth-place Irish would just as soon 
forget their last encounter, a 10-3 
shellacking at the hands of Michi­
gan Saturday night. But sopho­
more winger Terry Fairholm, who tallied the game-winning goal in last Friday's spine-tingling 4-3 overtime win over the Woverines, guarantees the ND faithful that he and his mates have no doubts about their ability to bounce back. The candid Canadian confesses that "we had a little trouble" on Saturday night in one of the year's most propitious understatements, but he leaves no doubt that Saturday's debacle has been quickly forgotten by the nation's 12th-ranked icers. "Our attitude's good, and we've had a fine week of practice," he optimistically explains. 
Highlighting this weekend's ac­tion is the return of productive right-winger Alex Pirus to the Brian Walsh line. Pirus' presence, following a two week layoff due to pulled knee ligaments, should in­deed bolster the Irish offense, which will need all the punch it can muster against a crafty UMD goaltender. He is Rick Heinz, a sophomore who is right now play­ing his best hockey of the season--­he had a whopping 88 saves in the two games last weekend against the Badgers . 
Lefty will counter with Lenny Moher, whose play of late has been nothing short of spectacular. The scrappy sophomore is unbeaten in his last five starts with a goals against average of just under 3.5, and Coach Smith has indicated that Moher will be on the ice both Friday and Saturday nights against the Bulldogs.
