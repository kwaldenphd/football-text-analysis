St. Mary's students protest Viet war 
by Maria Gallagher St. Mary's Editor 
About 40 Notre Dame and St. Mary's students at­tended a hastily-scheduled meeting last night at Regina Hall to plan protests against the Vietnamese escalation. 
SBP Jean Seymour and SBVP Sue Welte offered "constructive" ideas for campus participation in the nationwide student protest. 
"Our biggest problem is that we are working against time," said Seymour. She encouraged the community to "feel free to express yourself in protest in any form as long as it's not destructive." 
Seymour suggested working with Saga to collect money for any of the various Vietnamese relief funds. If a large number of people would sign up pledging to miss a definite number of meals, Seymour contended, Saga could possibly be persuaded to donate the money in the students'names to Vietnamese relief. 
"If your moral committment is great enough," Seymour continued, "join the boycott of classes." 
However, she listed several alternatives to boycott: attending classes in guerilla attire, writing senators and representatives, or refusing to pay the telephone tax. According to Seymour, this tax finances the white phosphorus chemical used in Vietnam. 
Freshman Lenore Cote added that teachers are 
being contacted and urged to dismiss classes. 
"Those who can't or do not wish to do so are being asked to participate as speakers," she said. "Perhaps we can plan some open seminars." 
Cote participated in the guerilla theatre staged in the SMC dining hall Tuesday night. Many students "mocked" the demonstration, she reported. 
"We wanted to confront the students 'directly draw their attention to the situation," she explained. 
Further guerilla theatre demonstration, sheet painting, and readings are planned for today con­tinuing through the weekend. 
Students interested in a major guerilla theatre 
demonstration before and after the Allen Ginsberg 
lecture Friday in Washington Hall can attend an 
11 :OOA.M. meeting today in Fiesta Lounge. At 11:30, 
noon picketing of the Huddle and dining halls will be 
organized in the second floor ballroom, LaFortune. 

Students discuss war and upcoming strike in SMC rap session. 
Notre Dame representative John Short called on 
students to "go back to their halls and spread the 
word." He cited lack of publicity as the reason for the 
poor attendance, and asked students to take the 
responsibility to make their neighbors aware. Short 
also mentioned wht mock convention as a possible 

vehicle for protest, as well as the ROTC building. ­
A list of activities planned for the next few days will 
be distributed to individual rooms tonight around 
midnight. Among them are a "dead body" demon­
stration Friday before the dining halls, along with a 
reading of Mark Twain's war prayer; a conceleb#rated 
Mass for peace outdoors at SMC; and a collective fast. 
Former St. Mary's SBP Kathy Barlow reported that 
a march on government buildings downtown is being 
planned for Friday afternoon. Beginning at Leeper 
Park at 3:00, it will proceed to the Sherland Building, 
which houses the draft board, and to various federal 
offices. The ITT and Honeywell Corporation offices 
may be picketed as well. 
The People's Coalition for Peace and Justice hopes to 
coordinate area high schools, townspeople, IUSB, and 
the ND-SMC campuses in this march.

SMC Student Government statement on strike 
We, the student government of SMC, are endorsing the following activities as viable means of showing our protest against the resumption of bombing in North Vietnam. We urge anyone to follow any other means of peaceful protest. We do not feel, however, that these things will be be the most effective. 
--Wire or write your congressman. We can vote now. 
--Use luxury money for the Vietnam Children's Relief Fund. --Use money you would have used for food for the above, if you fast. --Attend the peace mass at 1:00 pm Friday on the quad outside the SMC dining hall. --Urge your teachers to devote class time to discuss the war and particularly the recent escalation. 
--Come hear speakers set up by student government, hopefully, some students, faculty and administration will be willing to attend. 
Anyone willing to assist should contact SMC student government. 
Jean Seymour, Student Body President 
Susan Welte, Student Body Vice President. 
ND Student Government statement on the strike 
We have decided not to call for a general student strike We feel that it would have no effect on Nixon's policy and that several of the students are not in­terested in the strike and they should be able to attend class. We stand in agreement with the St. Mary's student government statement. We would like to add that non-violent, serious people with serious motives who do participate in the strike have our support and applause. Also a student government office has been made available for the coordinators. 
· "Contrary to reports in yesterday's Observer, 1 favored the calling of a student strike to allow me to get out of my art history class."

Demos halt Republican war move 
by John ' W. Finney ((') l!li2 New York Times News Service 

Washington, April 19--The Democratic leadership of the S!'nate thwarted an attempt by a group of Republican conservatives today to rush through a resolution condemning the North Vietnamese as aggressors and endosing United States policies in Vietnam. 
The maneuvering over the resolution, which was introduced by Senator Barry Goldwater, Republican of Arizona. underscored the increasing partisan division developing in both the Senate and House of Representatives over the administration's Vietnam policies in the wake of the renewed heavy bombing of North Vietnam. 
In both houses. thP adminstration Pow faces the task of beating backDemocratio-supported amendments to set by legislation on a termination date for American involvement in the Vietnam War. In the past, the Aministration has relied upon the house to block such amendments passed by the Senate, but now there are indications of shifting sentiment among House Democrats in favor of end-the-war legislation. 
At a caucus today, House Democrats, by a 105-97 vote, refused to place themselves on record in favor of legislation that through a cut off of funds would ter­minate all American military activities in 30 days. But the Democrats laid the groundwork for probable adoption tomorrow of a resolution calling upon the House Foreign Mfairs Committee to report within 30 days legislation designed to achieve a prompt ter­mination of United· States military involvement in the Vietnam War. 
The resolution, sponsored by Rep. Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., of Massachusetts, the Democratic Whip, would also condemn the recent bombings of North Vietnam as "a dangerous escalation of our role in the Indochina War and a direct contradiction of the administration's stated policy of winding down the war." 
The Goldwater resolution, co-sponsored by 13 Republican Senators, represented an obvious Republican retort to various Democratic end-the-war proposals now being advanced in both the House an dSenate. 
Goldwater sought agreement to have immediate consideration of his resolution, only to be blocked by an objection by Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the assistant Democratic leader. 

The Goldwater resolution will be open to further debate tomorrow, but under the rules of the Senate it did not appear possible that the Arizona republican could bring it to a vote in the next few days. In that event, Goldwater told reporters that he would offer his resolution as an amendment to a State Department budget authorization bill scheduled to be considered by the senate next week. 
If he does so, the State Department bill should provide a clear test of Senate sentiment on the war issue. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has already attached to the bill an amendment, co­sponsored by Sen. Frank Church, Dem., of Idaho, and Sen. Clifford P. Case, Republican of New Jersey, that would cut off funds for American hostilities in In­dochina at the end of the year, subject to a release of African prisoners of war. 
The co-sponsors of Goldwater resolution, all Republicans except Senator Buckley were: 
Wallace, F. Bennett, of Utah, Henry L, Bellmon, of Oklahoma, William Brock 3d of Tennessee, James Buckley, Conservative-Republican of New York, Robert J. Dole of Kansas; Peter H. Dominick of Colorado, Paul J. Fannin, of Arizon~. Hiram L. Fong of Hawaii, Edward J. Gurney of Florida, Roman L. Hruska, of Nebraska, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, John G. Tower of Texas and Robert Taft Jr. of Ohio. 
Describing the Soviet Union as "The principal culprit," Goldwater, his voice cracking with anger, said on the Senate floor: 
"If a Russian ship is hit, that's too damn bad. I hope we hit them all. They have no business being in Haiphong. 
"I would rather blow the living daylights out of Haiphong than lose one more American life." Sen. Gordon P. Allott of Colorado, Chairman of the Senate republican policy committee, said "The

Buffalo Five charged with three counts 
by Cliff Wintrode 

Buffalo, New York: An FBI agent here testified today that he believes two people escaped from a building seconds before five who are now standing trial for allegedly stealing draft files and army intelligence files, were arrested. 
Donald Adams, special agent with the Buffalo FBI office, said he saw two shadowy figures disappear down a stairwell where two of the defendants were apprehended the night of August 21. 1971. 
Adams also testified that he had been told by the assistant agent in charge of the Buffalo office two days before the arrest that "something was going to happen in Buffalo." 
The Buffalo Five are charged in a federal indictment with conspiracy, theft of government records, and intent to commit burglary. The five defendants are Maureen Considine, Chuck Darst. Jeremiah Horrigan, Jim Martin and Ann Masters. 
The first day of testimony was marked by a remarkable ex­pression of solidarity with the defendants, witnesses, and jury members by the spectators. All the spectators stood each time the jury filed out of the room, or a 
witness walked toward the stand. This held true when the FBI agent testified. 
Wide differences in what the issues before the court were could be seen in the opening statements of prosecutor, James Grable. US assistant attorney, and each defendnat including their co-counsel, Vincent Doyle, a lawyer. 
Grable told a jury that their only duty was to decide the guilt or innocence of each defendant on the three alleged offenses. "The only issues are issues related to these three charges," hf ,aid. 
Doyle began the defense statement' by saying that pleading self-defense will '· nable the defendants to "clearly and positively present themselves to vou." , "They lack the criminal in­tent." Doyle said. "We intend to move that . they regq_rded their action as an absolutely necessary step to prevent crime." 
Considine said in her opening statements that "we are not going to have much quarrel with what Mr. Grable will have to say." But. she added, "we are not here to talk about what happened on August 21." 
The legal process cannot be an autopsy ... or moral passion cannot excluded ... we will not be dismembered. We are sure we have a soul. Our souls brought us here." 
Horrigan accused te US or pursuing a policy of "genocide in Indochina." "How can we equate protection with killing." 
Masters said that "evPry citizen has thP responsibility to stop war crimes. Good Ger:· ..Jl1S had a responsibility io stop l'<azi atrocities," she added. 
Supporters of the Buffalo Five were pleased by the day's events at which they felt the invisible presence of momentum to be sided with the Buffalo Five.

By far the most impressive element in Tuesday's George Wallace Show in South Bend was the Alabama Governor's concept of "the message". Wallace told of the message at the airport press conference, his on-stage coordinator screamed it to the 3000 Wallace fans at the Morris Civic Auditorium before Wallace appeared, and the Governor himself trumpeted it to the crowd when he finally arrived. 
The message is an angry one. It says, quite simply, that the "top leadership" of the labor unions, of the Democratic Party, and of the nation as a whole have become insulated from the people they are supposed to be serving. As a result, the service is no longer Ihere, and the "average citizen, who works and pays his taxes", gets done in by "pointy-headed bureaucrats who can't even park the1r bicycles straight." 
Wallace apparently sees his candidacy as a vPhicle for transmitting the anger and fear of the citizens who support him into policy on the level of the party and the nation. 
Note carefully that Wallace rarely talks about winning the Miami convention. He rarely talks about beating President Nixon­unless specifically asked. He does talk, however, about having enough delegate strength at the convention to get his message across. 
Occasionally, of course, he lapses into the cockiness that characterizes so many of his supporters. For example, at the airport Tuesday, he said, "IfI win in Indiana, I may just may just deliver that message myself instead of sending it." 
However. this sort of approach does not characterize the Wallace speech in general. One of Wallace's approaches is to maximize discontent with "regular 
Democratic candidates" by pointing out that the six--now five--senators against whom he is running have been office during the time the country has allegedly deteriorated, and that they should be held responsible. This section of his speech was delivered with particular intensity Tuesday night and drew the loudest applause. 
Wallace also points out--and according to most reports is totally accurate--that his opponents in the Democratic race have "stolen" his issues. He was the first to talk busing, the first to talk tax reform, and the first to talk about the problems of bureaucracy. In recent months, Senators McGovern, Humphrey, and Muskie have begun to talk about those things too. McGovern has had particular success, i.e. Wison Wisconsin. 
And Wallace confronts the accusation of demagoguery especially well. He merely points out that he is saying what the people are saying--he is delivering the message-­which is a clever form of populist demagoguery in itself, but then no one seems to mind. 
In times of trouble people tend to look for the easiest way out of the trouble. This is natural, and one of the easiest ways out is to redefine the problem so that a simplistic solution will work. So long as the definition of the problem corresponds fairly well to the voters' perception of reality we find a successful demogogue. lf Wallace is a demagogue, he certainly qualifies as a successful one. 
One point that is rarely argued among 
political observers today is that Wallace will 
not be the Democratic nominee. He will get 
little or no support from party regulars in 
the non-primary states, and he is not en­tered in enough states to win a majority of 
primary delegates. 
Another point that seems fairly obvious is 
that the Alabama governor will not run a 
third-party race as he did in 1968. At least 
he doesn't intend to do so now. Should the 
Democrats behave uncourteously in Miami, 
this may change. The work necessary to put 
Wallace on the ballot in 50 states is just too 
much to be handled this late in the year, and 
Wallace has no one working on it. Also, he is 
entered in several states--Indiana and 
Michigan among them--where a candidate 
is prohibited from running in November in a 
party different from the one in whose 
primary he participated. Lengthly court 
battles might get him on the ballot, but this 
is not even certain. 
What, then, is the Wallace strategy? 
Consider that he will have around 600 to 700 
delegates commited to him for the first 
ballot. Unless a big Humphrey drive starts 
in Pennsylvania, Wallace could be in a 
position to deal with other candidates for a 
vice-president, busing concessions, 
southern Supreme Court justices, etc. It 
won't be the first time a southerner "sent 
'em a message." 
Looking at the near future, Wallace will 
be in position the next few weeks to severely 
damage Humphrey or Muskie. This he 
could do by drawing blue-collar support in 
Pennsylvania or by winning either Indiana 
or Michigan--or both. He is currently 
favored in Michigan, where busing is an 
extremely touchy issue. 
What, then, are the options availble to "regular" Democratic aspirants like Humphrey, McGovern, and Muskie? First, -they could ignore Wallace and risk a serious split in the party and certain victory for President Nixon in November. This, of

course, is hazardous and would reflect 
crippling pride on the part of the 
"regulars." 

The obvious course of action is to simply 
admit that the noisy populist from the South 
is right, and that the leadership of this 
country has indeed been alienated from the 
populace. Senator McGovern seems on the 
way to saying this implicitly already, and 
his scores in Wisonsin reflect this. 
The most beneficial course for the 
Democratic party would be to deal with 
Wallace, accept some of his ideas as valid, 
invite him into the high councils of the 
party, and to move together against the 
Republicans no matter who is nominated. 
This course of action represents ac­
ceptance of "the message." If the 
Establishment refuses to hear the word that 
is coming through loud and clear from the 
people, then they may cease to be the 
Establishment.

4 to 3 decision 
Court limits conservation action 
By Lyle Denniston 
(c) 1!172 Washington Star 

Washington, April l!J--The Supreme Court, in a 4-to-3 decision, strictly limited today the right of conservation group to go to court to protect the-enVIronment.  
A group may not file a federal case to protect the outdoors unless it can show that its members have been personally and directly harmed. Justice Potter Stewart wrote for the majority. 
The decision blunted the Sierra Club's attempt to challenge the proposed $35 million Wall Disney resort in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains. 
Disney productions has been granted permits bv two govern­ment departments. to go ahead with a plan to develop mineral King Valley in the Sequoia National Forest and Game Refuge into a major recreational project. 
Today's ruling allows the Sierra Club to try again in lower courts to prove that it or its members would be directly injured by the resort project. 
"No matter how long-standing the interest and no matter how qualified the organization is in evaluating the problem," Stewart commented, "It is not sufficient by itself to render the organization "adversely affected" and thus in a position to sue. 
The opinion did not define the kind of injury which the con­servation groups' members would 

Laird: the bo~nbing 
By John W. Finney (c)l!J72 New York Times 

Washington. April 1!1--Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird said today that as long as the North 
Vietnamese continued their in­vasion of the South, any area of North Vietnam was subject to bombing attack by the United States. 
Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Secretary said he would "not rule out the possibility" that the U.S. 
might even blockade or mine the harbor of Haiphong unless the invasion was ended. 
Yesterday, Secretary of State William P. Rogers told the Com­mittee that the Nixon Ad­ministration would continue to take "whatever military action is necessary" to halt the enemy drive. 
At today's session, Laird em­phatically denied reports from Saigon that President Nixon had ordered a suspension of the bombing of Hanoi-Haiphong area 
U.S. atte1npts new Olyntpic progra1n 
(c) 1!172 New York Times 
New York, April I!J--An elaborate training sequence designed to sharpen the American men's track and field team for the Munich Olympics has been approved by the United States Olympic Committee. 
The program will include optional, informal training periods in Oregon and Maine in mid and late-July and a major invitational meet Aug. 2 and 3 in Oslo, Norway. less than one month before the start of the Olympics. 
Robert Giegengack, chairman of the men's track and field committee, confirmed today that the board of directors of the 
U.S.O.C. was unanimous in its support of the program, which would send the men's track and field team to Europe almost three weeks ahead of the official 
U.S. Olympic entourage. 
"A great deal of time, thought and research went into this project," said Giegengack, a former U.S. Olympic coach. "It was agreed that this plan would provide us with the best op­portunity to have our athletes in top shape for Munich." 
U.S. men's track and field trials will be held June 29 to July 9 in Eugene, Ore. A team of 70 athletes will be selected during the competition.

have to prove in order to get their challenge into Federal Court. But the opinion said that the harm could be "esthetic and en­vironmental" and thus need not be economic or physical. 
Stewart's opinion was supported by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justices Thurgood Marshall and Byron R. White 
Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan Jr. and William 0. Douglas dissented, and each filed a separate opinion. 
Justices Lewis S. Powell Jr. and William H. Rehnquist were not on the court when the Sierra Club case arose, and thus did not act on the decision. 
In a six-page dissent, Blackmun spoke glowingly of thP-virtues of

to see whether there would be any 
political response from the North 
Vietnamese Government. The 
White House underscored the 
denial by saying that Laird was 
"stating the authorized position of 
thP U.S. Governmnet." 
In Saigon, however. official U.S. military sources, to whom the reports were attributed, continued to stand by them. 
Laird branded the Saigon reports as false in response to a reporter's question. He added: 
"The bom-bing continues south of the demilitarized zone, in the demilitarized zone and north of the demilitarized zone." 
Later. during the questioning in his four-and-one-half hour ap­pearance before the Senate Committee. Laird suggested that the U.S. might take the additional step of attempting to seal off Haiphong, the principal port of North Vietnam. 
He said he would "not rule out" the possibility that the U.S. might impose a naval quarantine on Haiphong to stop the entry of ships carrying military equipment, or alternatively mine the channel leading into the harbor. 

informally after the trials will be permitted, Giegengack said. Between July 20 and 29, another optional training program will be instituted at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Me., where members also will be processed, outfitted and checked physically. 
"Any athlete who has a job or is married and can't report to Bowdoin or leave with the team early for Oslo will be processed through Washington with the rest of the official party," Giegengack said. 
The Amateur Athletic Union has agreed to cover travel arrangements for the American team to Oslo. The A.A.U. is helping to organize the August meet. which will be televised back to the United States that weekend,and talks confidently of staging "a little Olympics," with most of the world's top track and 
field talent expected to compete with the exception of the African nations. 
"The entries of the American team in Oslo will be the responsibility of Bill Bowerman, the coach." Giegengack said. "And there will be no guarantees that a Jim Ryun or a Marty Liquori has to run a mile there. We're not going to allow this competition to interrupt our long-range plans for Munich." 
Nevertheless, the meet may raise eyebrows in international circles, particularly if East Germany and the Soviet Union send more than token entries, as 
A.A.U. officials believe they will, and if international Olympic 
officials feel  the  meet  will  be  
reigning  on  their  parade  in  
Munich later that month.

urattmg new legal principles in order to help "perpetuate the wilderness and its beauty, solitude and quiet." 
He protested that the law was being kept rigid in a way that inhibits solutions to environmental problems. and predicted that the Disney project will now hastily proceed to completion and one more wilderness area "will become defaced." 
Douglas said that the Court was ignoring the problem of providing "spokesmen" for the "inanimate objects" of nature. 
Brennan's one-paragraph dissent argued that the court should not only give the Sierra Club the right to sue, but should strike down the Disney project. 
that athletes have over­whelmingly endorsed the idea of having "a real shakedown" before Munich instead of being holed up in training camps getting "cabin fever" from inactivity.

Strike-ineffective 
The strike proposed for tomorrow to protest the escalation of the air war in Vietnam will be an ineffective attempt to get the point across to the forces which 
~ have embroiled the United States in the 
r 
Southeast Asian conflict. 
r 
While the strike will calm the con­
r 
r sciences of those sincere enough to attend r the daily organizational meetings, to r paint their faces white, and to march r outside the dining halls and in the r library; it will become nothing more than r an irrational excuse for an academic rip­r off by students who want to hit the links 
r 
early or cut out for Chicago or the dunes
r 
provided there is good weather. 
Deserve Recognition 

r 
Strikers and those who participate in other forms of local protest should be
f 
commended for their efforts to express
r 
the feelings of what may well be a 
~ 
majority of students on this campus. It is through such efforts, and those which are r more effective, that young Americans r can show that they have not given up the 
r 
! 
cause of peace simply because draft quotas have been reduced, and at times cancelled. 
There are several ways Notre Dame's unofficial protesters might utilize to get 
their statement across to the military industrial complex. While the strike and
~ 
other activities may merit a few inches in the local press, and perhaps a little less
~ 
r from the Chicago media, chances are it r will not reach beyond those who patronize r these sources of news.
, 
However, mobilization of the student vote, a vigorous letter campaign to state Congressional representatives, a petitioning drive to awaken the com­munity, and support of prominent faculty and administrators are potentially more influential. 
No one needs to be told the power of the newly enfranchised student, and most can imagine what logistic problems would be created by the influx of an additional thousand or so letters a day could do to a representative's office schedule. Two years ago more than 20,000 signitures were gathered downtown and door to door to protest the Cambodian invasion. People will listen when someone like Fr. Hesburgh denounces the bombing. 
Your Choice 
Actually, when you come down to the individual it is his choice whether to waste his time or not. There is no sense to strike for the sake of saying, "Hey look at, me, this is my way of saying I'm against the bombing," if it is not going to stimulate any more of a response than "O.K.. I hear you. So what." 
While there is no guarantee the above four suggestions will have any better result, there is certainly more potential. The only to make a strike work is to produce enough supporters to at least reach the same scale as two years ago. 
As far as Notre Dame is concerned, there is now way to reach that scale by Friday. If you feel you have to do something to prot.. ~ t the recent escalation do someth:ng tha 1 ~ill at least have a chance to rroduce I }suits. 
The Editorial Board 

Letter ----------the war-another view 
Editor, 
I would like to express my disappointment when I read your editorial, written by Jerry Lutkus, "The Bombing Must be Stopped,"
r 
in the Obsf'rver of Monday,
r 
[ 
April 17. I really never thought that an editorial, not even in the Observer, could be so misleading and prejudiced. Your editorial is 
obviously directed against Nixon and his ideas about the war and I can see why Lutkus wouldn't like Nixon to be reelected. What I don't approve is the use of an editorial containing so many misleading statements, for this purpose. You say that the bombing of North Vietnam is a "senseless, merciless act attempting to merely save face in the wake of a strong Viet Cong offensive." 
Well I think Lutkus forgot to· mention that what the U .S.is trying to stop is not only a Viet Cong of­fensive, but a full scale invasion against the South by the North Vietnamese Army. Lutkus mentions that a "Soviet seaman who was aboard a Russian ship" was killed by the bombing. The cover page said that a Russian officer had been killed. I believe that there is a big difference between a seaman and an officer. 
It seems as if Lutkus thought that it makes no difference for the people of South Vietnam whether the U.S. planes support them or not, or whether it makes no dif­ference that the Communists gain control in the South. I cannot discuss such a broad theme in this space, but I would like to ask you, Jerry, have you ever lived in a Communist system? Well I have and believe me it's no fun. 
Finally, you say "war is· hell" of course it is! But, remember that the general that first said it burned Atlanta immediately afterwards. You may ask yourself why and the answer is simple, he had no choice. 

Neither do we. Either we stop North Viet Nam in its advance or we let them repeat the massacres of past years, because it is not only the U.S., Jerry, the ones that kill people. 
The "innocent and peace-loving" Communists also kill. Two thousand and thirty-two were killed by the Viet Cong in 1965, 1,732 in 1966 and 3,706 in 1967. If you want the numbers for the years before and after I am sure you could find them if you were really interested. But I think that your editorial carried a message, a misleading one, but it doesn't matter. Or does it? Well just to make the war a little more fair Lutkus, don't you think that the 
U.S. should next time drop some flowers instead of bombs?

The Wallace show 
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHIIIIIIIIIIIIUIIUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIUIIIIIIIIIIII JaCk KUeSter 
Political rallies always appeal to a voter's emotions as well as to his intellect. But the Wallace rally in South Bend convinced me that this candidate is willing to sacrifice intellectual appeal by aiming his cam­paign at his audience's gut emotions. 
The Governor knows what the people want. The people standing out­side Morris Civic Auditorium waiting to see him demonstrated with Wallace buttons, hats and banners that they wanted Wallace. The line stretched down Michigan Avenue and around the corner. The doors opened at 6:30 as anti-Wallace leaflets were passed out by kids who worked quickly and smiled nervously. 
The colorful <red, white and blue) crowd and the inside of the old Auditorium <which looks like a barn, a Church and the Grand Ole Opry roBed into one) provided the perfect atmosphere for what followed. The whole show began when the Master of Ceremonies (and that is the right term l, a large, white-haired ·southerner with a bright orange jacket, introduced a local minister to give the invocation. The minister mounted the podium and the crowd cheered politely. "Oh Lord," the minister began. "Eat shit," someone cried. Then, 6,000 eyeballs scan the balcony for the pagan who ruined this prayer. "That's disgusting!" says the man seated next to me. It was. 
After the prayer, the M.C. grabbed the microphone, jabed a finger at the balcony and vowed: "That is the sort of junk that George Wallace is going to put an end to." I wondered how he will do that as the crowd goes wild, shakes it fists and Confederate flags at the balcony. They seemed to know how he will end it. That scares me. 
The shaw goes on with a country-and-western band led by Billy Brammer singing "This Ole Town" and requests from the audience.' "I don't want to hear anything new, I won't play it." The old folks stook to yell for tunes from years back. "I played Dixie once." While Billy played, "Wallace Girls" circulated in the crowd and collect for their candidate. TV crews charged up and down the aisles documenting contributions. Billy played "Ya'll Come" and "The Beer Barrel Polka" (a request) and then the M.C. took the mike again waving a $20 bill in his hand and with all the jubiliation of a preacher who has snatched a sinner from the depths of depravity, announced, "This twenty dollars was contributed by Mrs. Betty Randolph (or somebody) sitting out there in the eighth row." "You fool" someone shouted. More junk but Billy Brammer was already into the "Wabash Cannonball" and the crowd was stomping and clapping in time. 
It was the last song because the Governor had arrived. The M.C. an­nounced. "The next President of the United States-George C. Wallace!" The crowd responded thunderously as the man strutted onto stage. He was short, handsome and well-dressed. There were sundry presen­tations, including a hard hat ha handed to Wallace by a black con­struction worker who looked out of place. I wondered what he was thinking and he probably wondered what we thought and I'm sure we both guessed wrong. 
Wallace stepped to the podium and jumped right into his speech, like he just turned the page of a book. "Back in 1964 when I was demanding tax reforms I was called a demagogue and now all six senators are calling for tax reform.~· His deliver was magnificently calculated, fast and, despite what I expected, not perfunctory or routine. He lashed out at taxes, bureaucracy, the war. 
The balcony began to heckle him and. chant, "Go Home George!" and other things· I couldn't hear because George was drowning them out without changing his tone or subject.. He drew in greaf cubic feet of empty air and spewed it back full of denunciations, promises and energy to overwhelm every other sound in the auditorium. 
He began to speak of "pointy-headed intellectuals" using his hands to emphasize and illustrate. The crowd snickered. "Yeah!--Go George. You tell 'em!" The old man sitting across the aisle from me wearing a Wallace button the size of a frying pan was nodding his head faster and harder. He jumped in his seat, clapped, and cheered. I thought he would pass out. 
Wallace talked for about forty minutes. You know what he's going to say before he says it. Taxing, busing, bureaucracy-he's against them. Local control, locally elected federal judges, -he's for them. It's always what the audience wants to hear. 
And then was done, a few handshakes and he was gone. The crowd was moved because he had touched them. He cherishes and respects the same things they do-he understands what they want. They love him and they want him. It's all gut I tell myself as the crowd pours out onto Michigan Avnue and how do you argue with that? I wish I knew.

Lord Chief Justice tries to whitewash Catholic blood

 l(ll!l7:! New York Times~ 
Bt>lfast Nlll'tht>rn Ireland, April ~ !l--The Roman Catholic minority, n a mood of growing anger, 
t ~ 
reacted bitterly today to Lord Widgery's report on the killing of 
I:3 men by British soldiers in Londonderry last Jan. 30, and
~ 
Iermed the findings a 
~ 
··whitewash." 
Bernadette Devlin, a mid-Ulster ~ member of Parliament, called i~ord Widgery, the Lord Chief
l 
~ 
Justice, who headed the inquiry, ·a liar." Ivan Cooper, a political leader in Londonderry, said angrily: "I 
~ have no hesitation to say that Lord Widgery has been dishonest in the eyes of many people in this city
~ 
and he is nothing short of an ac­
~ 
cessory to the actions of the paratroopers."
"" 
~ 
Although today's report pinned some blame on Army tacticst during Londonderry's "Bloodyl Sunday," Lord Widgery's con­
l 
~ clusion that a sniper opened fire first at paratroopers left Catholics 
furious. Virtually the entire Catholic community here believes that the soldiers were unprovoked, and fired indiscriminately at the huge demonstration in the Bogside area. 
The report. coupled with the killing last Saturday of a popular Irish Republican Army leader, Joseph McCann, has turned the 
-wtfioTics with renewed fierceness against the British Army and government. including William Whitelaw, the new secretary of State for Northern Ireland. More than three weeks after Catholics had largely welcomed the im­position of direct rule by Britain, the minority is, once again, sullen. 
·'The Widgery report will have the effect of lessening still further zmr. Whitelaw's and the British government's credibility with the anti-unionist population." said Kevin McCorry, the key organizer of the militant Northern Ireland Civil Rights association. 
"It comes at a very critical time. The Widgery report is the whitewash we feared it would be. The report is an attempt to excuse murder by saying that the army was provoked," McCorry added. 
Catholic moderates were angry too. "I think it is the best recruitment pamphlet for the I.R.A. I have seen in a long time," said Tom Conaty, chairman of the Central Citizens Defense Com­mittee, a powerful group in Belfast's Falls Hoad Ghetto. "It destroys the credibility of anyone who says, 'Give Britain a chance. She will do the right thing,"' 

In Londonderry. James Wray, whose 22-year-old son was one of the 13 victims, said simply: "I am glad I fathered the son who died, rather than fathered the son who murdered him.'' 
:\nd Father Edward Daily, a priest who testified before Lord Widgery, said: "I'm flab­bergasted. It's a disgraceful report." 
The anger over the report's 
findings--which criticized the Civil Rights Association for organizing the illegal march-­followed a surge of violence that has struck Northern Ireland since the weekend. 

Today. the body of 33-year-old James Elliott--the father of three children--was found on a deserted road outside Newtown-Hamilton, near the border with the Irish republic. Elliott, a Presbyterian m!'mb!'r of the Ulster Defense Hegiment, a part-time militia, had been shot through the head and tied up in a rubber sack. Around the body were six claymore mines as well as 200 pounds of explosives and a large bomb. 
Elliott was kidnapped at gun­point Monday night near the border town of Newry as he crossed into the North driving his company's truck. In recent months, the Ulster Defense regiment has been a target of the I.H.A. 
Through the night this bleak capital was torn by sporadic terror. An army spokesman said that there were 21 shooting in­cidents, mostly shots fired at patrolling British soldiers: 
The army has pointed out in a statement that both the official and provisional wings of the I.R.A. have intensified the terror cam­paign in recent days "in an ap­parent effort to rally support for a policy of continued violence." 
Army officials say privately that in the last few days a token solidarity has been established b!'tween hoth wings of the I.R.A.,

Saigon, Thursday, April 20-­

After a pause of two days in which only a handful of bombing missions were flown over North Vietnam, the United States command resumed the air campaign Wed­nesday with more than 125 strikes, according to informed officers. 
All the raids were in North Vietnam's southern panhandle, below the 20th parallel, according to the officers. 
ThE' officers said that "Only a handful" of raids were made in North Vietnam Monday and Tuesday, after Sunday's massive raids over Hanoi and Haiphong-­the latter being the principal entry port for war supplies. No raids as far north as Hanoi or Haiphong have been flown since, according to the officers. 
The United States command has maintained official silence about the raids. American officers close to the planning for the air war say that the two-day letup was design!'d to permit an assessment of the raids' political effect by the Nixon Administration. 
The targets for the increased number of raids Wednesday were "logistical" in nature, the officers said. In the previous raids, which h!'gan April 6, such targets in­rluded petroleum storage areas, roads. bridges, and airfields. 

Am!'rican planes also have been hitting surface to air missile sites and antiaircraft artillery positions just north of the demilitarized zone to eliminate the threat they pose to Am!'rican and South Vietnamese airplanes flying bombing missions in support of Saigon Government troops below it.

Saigon, April 19 -North Viet­namese and main-force vietcong troops overran a district town on 
.the central coast 45 miles north of l~uinhon, causing heavy casualties to the South Vietnamese battalion defending the town and forcing the government to withdraw, Whitnt>y senior military officials in t>leiku said Wednesday. 
The heavy fighting in the Hoaian district came with simultaneous attacks on several other cities in Binhdinh Province, the most heavily populated on the Central Coast, where another main-force North Vietnamese regiment has for the last 10 days cut the strategic highway 19 at the Ankhe · 1ss between Quinhon and Pleiku.

There; -over the last four days, according to senior American officers in Danang, main-force Vietcong units, taking advantage of the movement of the large South Vietnamese army units out of the coastal lowlands to counter North Viet­namese reinforcements in the mountains, have laid waste to a dozen towns in Son Tinh District on the Batangan Peninsula of Chulai, resulting in an estimated 10,000 refugees. 
On the other fronts there were these developments: 
Communist attacks in Binh Long Province north of Saigon continued to intensify as North Vietnamese forces estimated at more than 20,000 men continued to move east from Cambodia. There ws heavy fighting up and down the length of highway 13 through the Province, with at least four more North Vietnamese tanks reportedly spotted moving south toward Binh­duong Province closer to Saigon. 
In that province, the Fifth 
Division's base camp at Laikhe 
came under enemy mortar attack 
early Wednesday morning. A 
regiment of the division has been 
!'ncircled at Anloc, the Binhlong 
Province -capital, for more than a 
week and a 10,000-man relief force 
has been unable to break its way 
through the North Vietnamese 
lines and move North of the high­
way into Anloc. 
News reports from Cambodia also suggested that North Viet­namese troops may be sweeping through Preyveng Province and trying to make an end run around the government forces in Binhlong, and open another front west of Saigon from Highway 1, the main road between Saigon and Phnom penh. 
South Vietnamese troops on the far northern front in Quangtri Province held off North Viet­namese attacks to the West of Quangtri city Tuesday and Wenesday, aided by B-52 strikes that rained nearly 1000 tons of bombs on Communist troop con­centrations in the mountains seven miles west of the Province capital.

Wallace speaks to Mid-A~nerica via I down ho111eI fanfare 
by Jerry l.utkus Observer Nl"ws Editor 
The man was quite large ana just over six foot tall. He wore a fire-engine red blazer with Wallace '72 printed on the breast pocket and he screamed out to the crowd, "This is Wallace Country." 
George Mangrum was speaking to an overflow crowd at the Morris Civic Auditorium in South Bend on Tuesday night prepping them for the arrival of Governor George Corley Wallace of Alabama. 
Mangrum bellowed out to the crowd that the Wallace entorage had been in Detroit a few nights ago and they drew nearly 10,000 people in back-to-hack rallies. He cried that this happens every where Governor Wallace goes. 
Morris Civic never looked any better. There was a huge red­white-and blue draped podium in the center of the stage and to the right of the podium Billy Gramer and his country-western group played their foot stompin music 
Observer News Feature 
The crowd was mostly middle­aged, the gentlemn sported crew cuts and the ladies dressed conservatively. All of them were covered with their red,white and blue stickers that holered Wallace for President. Gramer was playing their kind of music, the music they remembered for the days when they were younger. 
The atmosphere was high­
charged with excitement. The Governor was coming to speak to an average citizen and Mr. and Mrs. Middle America turned out in force. 
Gramer's job was to entertain the folks, on the surface, but in truth he seemed to be there to build up the exictement and energy of the crowd. After every few songs, Mangrum, who served as the MC, would ap­proach the microphone and talk about Wallace. 
Then Gramer would play again. Ashe went into playing "I Wanna Go Home," he introduced it as a tale of a boy who went to the Motor City, but couldn't go 
metaphorical order 
home becaue he didn't have any more money. Gramer said that the government had taken it all away in taxes. "When Governor Wallace becomes President, we won't have to worry about that." The crowd broke into loud and' lengthy applause and then stomped along as Gramer sang. 
The psychology of the situation was amazing. The band would stir the people up and then Mangrum would come out and talk about Wallace and then over to the band to settle 'em down and then Mangrum would stir 'em up again. This all built up until Wallace was about to come onstage and then Mangrum rushed and hollered "Without further adieu I give you, Governor George C. Wallace." And Morris Civic Auditorium went birds. The hall resembled the heart of the confederacy as the rebel flags popped out from all corners. Signs by the hun­dreds appeared screaming, "Wallace tells it like it is," "Bus the Senators, Judges and Burocrats," and "Send them a message, vote Wallace." 
Wallace stood near the front of the stage accepting the appaluse graciously and saluting· the audience. He was surprisingly short with light brown hair. His suit was inspiringly neat and 
trim.  His composure  was  ob­ 
vious.  
The  whole  performance  was  
keyed  to  middle  America,  the  

average citizen, the rank and file. Three presentations took place as Wallace came to the poidum. A young girl voted the "Prettiest Majorette in Indiana" presented Wallace with a baton. Then he was given an authentic 
Wallace Scotch plaid tie, finally two "rank and file laborers" offered the governor a white hardhat with an American flag on it. One of the workers was a black man, the only one to be seen throughout the night. 
The build-up to Wallace's appearance was marred by heckling only once, though his speech was often interrupted. The only heckling came when a preacher gave the invocation for the evening. As he began, a heckler shouted an obscenity from the balcony. Upon com­pletion, Mungrum rumbled back onstage and used the heckling to Wallace's advantage. "That's the kind of junk that Americans are getting fed up with," he bellowed. "People don't even have the common courtesy to shut their traps when a man of God is invoking his name." The hall again broke into cheers and a standing ovation which lasted close to two minutes. 

The Mungrum offered the people "an opportunity to give." A group of young schoolgirls then circulated through the audience collecting from the people. Again, the average citizen, down home approach came out. Mungrum searched out a woman in the crowd who had given $20. Then came the litany of "Thank Ya Man, God Bless Y Mam's." 
The MC confessed to the people that "There's no big foundation giving us money. We depend on Mr. and Mrs. Middle America. We nickel and dime our way across America." Wallace's speech hammered home at the point that the whole performance was keyed to -the average citizen. Not only did he say it in his speech, but even the little things were geared in that direction . . . the presentations from the majorette and workers, the country-western band, the thank ya mam's, the preacher. Everything went to the people. 
Even the way that Wallace appeared went to the people. When Humphrey came to South Bend, he met with the Press and small groups of Democratic leaders. Wallace comes to South Bend and he speaks to the people. 
The Governor is conscious of his strength and where it lies. He builds on it and he works it over. He speaks to the little man and the little man reacts. It's questionable if Wallace really can do anything for the little man in America, but he is also the first one to speak directly to him. But no matter what happens, whether he wins or loses, George 
C. Wallace has gone to the people in a style much like that of An­drew Jackson, he's trying to become one of us. And the people are buying it. 
Gass lectures on life1S order 
By Bt>th Hall 
In a lecture entitled "Measurement and Metaphor", novelist William H. Gass spoke of man's concern for creating metaphors or models to measure and order the chaos of life. 
Before the small group in Carroll Hall yesterday af­ternoon, Gass outlined the process by which man makes a metaphorical order, in life as well as in poetry and fiction. 
A basic problem to man, ac­
cording  to  Gass,  is  the  
measurement  of  nature,  "the  
movements  around  us,  too  
vague,  too  numerous,  too  

transitory to number." Man puts things in life in terms of numbers and vords to give them an order. By fastening names to chaotic elements man makes them a part of a master plan and provides a means of measuring and classifying them in what Gass called "an informing visual field." 
Once a name has been given to something, that object takes on the properties of the model it has been provided. For example, Gass described the order of human behavior as a moael named society. in which man adopts the behavioral pattern prescribed by that society. 
Gass described fiction as "a 
big metaphor. a model with 
tremendous scope." A good 
metaphor is one which fits into a 
pattern so that the named object 
"possess all the properties seen 
in light of the name." The depth 
of a metaphor would then be the 
"degree to which it is analogous 
to the object." 

take metaphors and models as 
r~ality. He said. "A model may 
giVe us order. but contradictions 
will occur if a metaphor is carried too far. Books are found by getting to books. The real world is found only by getting to the real world."

Duncan reads, sings own works 

by Steve Lazar 

San Francisco poet Robert Duncan concluded the fourth day of the week-long Sophomore Literary Festival last night by reading and singing a number of his works to a large audeince in the Library Auditorium. 
Duncan referred to his public reading as a "trip" and ex­plained that he wished to present a variety fo his styles to the audience along the way. Stating that "I love Jarkness in and of itself," Duncan told his audience that if perchance some peoms appeared obscure to them, they would remain certainly no less obscure to himself. 
 
Several of Duncan's first readings seemed to present aspects of his poetic philosophy. In a poem dedicated to a poet­friend of his <Duncan pointed out

Light sculpture exhibit showing in Fieldhouse 
Illuminated Forms II, an exhibition of sculpture in light, opened Tuesday at the Fieldhouse. Conceived and built by Bill Barnes and Jim Byer, graduate students in th~ Fine Arts Department, the exhibition will end with tonight's 7:30-9:30 showing. 
The sculptures. six in number, are created from tubular neon lights and bricks, dirt, and logs. On the darkness shrouded main floor of the Fieldhouse, they stand out as highlights of brilliant colour and muted, coloured shadows. 
According to Dyer, the work be~an about two months ago with a general plan to "utilize the prime space of floor area," the huge dirt-floored center room of the Fieldhouse. "because of the space available here," Dyer explained, "it allows us to work in neon lighting. The Fieldhouse gives a closed enviornment with the effect of outdoor space." 
In some pieces, notably a con­struction of large free-standing loops of light, the light tubes themselves are structural elements. In others, the light is reflected off and among the massive bulks of tree trunks, and within long brick latticeworks. The use of naturalistic elements is stressed. 
Many of the pieces are so arranged as to present two dif-

Agenda set by Committee 
The Rules Committee of the Mock Democratic Convention met Wednesday night to discuss thethe rules and procedures for the convention. Blake Wordal of the South Dakota delegation was elected chairman. Attendance was very poor and the chairman expressed concern for the en­thusiasm of the convention. 
The Committee passed an agenda for the upcoming con­vention. Some suggestions were discussed as to the election of the presidential candidate. The simple majority rule electing the party's candidate was challenged in favor of a two­thirds majority election. The committee deferred action on the challenge until the next meeting where there will hopefully be more delegates.

Symptomatic of the good will of the visitors was the resignation 

with which they accepted a makeshift court that was put down in 24 hours in the Trusteeship Council room. 


During a preliminary brief tour of the building, when the players first walked onto the sawdust­

we call poetry a bird I cannot name crows." In an excerpt from a masque wicch he wrote in­volving Adam, King Samuel, and the Archangel Michael, Duncan concluded with the following words: "Thus poetry resembles the works of things, and Adam must find himself in Eve." 
In a work called "The Fire" Duncan attempted to create a kind of poetry which does not exist within a boundary. To do this he opened and ended the poem by speaking a sequence of single, isolated words, of various parts of speech, each word separated from the next by a well measured length of time. He explained that "Each word exists in a world of itself and can be related to the others as a resonance.'' Between these openi ·nd ending passages of the 1.>· , Duncan recited more convent wnal verses of poetry, seemin\' there to treat the topic of ex1"tence of evil in the political order. He accompanied this central section of the poem throughout with a four-beat movement of his hands, much as if much as if he were conducting a musical exercise. 
Following this poem, Duncan sang a composition of his own which could loosely be termed a lovesong. Entitled 'Song of the Old Order' the piece moved through a number of verses and refrains, touching as it went on such objects as knights and ladies and the seasons of spring and fall. 
After a short intermission Duncan read his eight finished sections of a proposed ten-piece suite,written in the style of the metaphysical poets around 1590­1609. Among -the poets Duncan imitated, though with his own manner of treating themes, were George Herbert and Sir Walter Raleigh. 
Duncan will appear again today with Diane Wakoski and Allen Ginsberg as part of a poetry symposium to be held at

China affir1ns Vietnaiil aid 
((') l!li2 New York Times News St>n·ice 
April 19---Premier Chou En­Lai said in an interview televised nationwide in the United States today that China would support Notth Vietnam to the end in its fight against the "U.S. Govern­ment's war of aggression." 
In an interview filmed on April 5 just after the North Vietnamese thrust across the demilitarized zone and the resumption of the American bombing of the North, the Chinese Premier said: 
"If the U.S. government's war of aggression against Indochina does not stop, so long as the war con­tinues, no matter in what forms, including that of 'Vietnamization', and the bombings are expanded, the free Indochina peoples can 
.... 
only fight on, fight to the end and the Chinese people will certainly support them to the end." He said that there could be no relaxation of tension in Asia until the war in I~h.ina had ended. The interview in Peking by a British freelance journalist, Felix Greene, was the first granted by Chou to a western newsman since President Nixon's trip to China in 
February and the stepped-up fighting in Vietnam. His remarks translated from Chinese, were telecast on the National Broad­casting Company's early morning "Today" show. 
Chou characterized Nixon's visit as "at least a start" toward un-' derstanding each other's views and expounding respective positions. 
"Both sides express the desire to seek the relaxation of international tensions, first of all the tension in the Far East," the Chinese Premier said. 
-''In my opinion, if the United States does not withdraw its armed forces from Indochina and cease supporting the puppet regimes ~nd rightist forces in these countries, the war in Indochina cannot stop and thus it will be impossible to ease the tension in the Far East." 
Asked wheter any secret agreements mi~ht have been reached between the U.S. and China, Chou said that there could not "Possibly be any secret agreements" because of the "<'ssential differences between the fundamental systems and foreign policies of the two countries." 
The Chinese Premier also said 

that the Japanses government's policies of -economic expansion "will inevitably lead to military expansion." 
He said that Japanese military expansion was need to protect the country's economic expansion. He accused the Japanese Government of "energetically reviving militarism and publicly an­nouncing that it seeks military expansion in South Korea, Taiwan and Southeast Asia." 
"Since both sides express such a desire, the question is to see whether future action is taken accordingly. As things stand now, the most outstanding question in the Far East remains that of the 
U.S. War of aggression against Vietnam and Indochina. 
"If this is not stopped," Chou 

"the  first  victim  will  be  the  
Japanese people."  
Premier  Eisaku  Sato  and  

Foreign Minister Kiichi Aichi, Chou said, have been "vacillating and wavering" in their attitude on the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. 
College presidents attack 
lcl 1!172 New York Times 

New York, April19--ln a singular action aimed at heading off campus disturbances, the presidents of the eight Ivy League Universities and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology issued a joint statement today deploring the recent heavy bombing of North Vietnam. 
The presidents alse said that they support demonstrations against the war "as long as they are not at the expense of the rights of others or at the expense of the continuation of constructive educational and scholarly activity of universities and colleges." 
But even as the statement was being issued one of the institutions, Columbia University here, ob­tained a court order restraining striking students from forcibly attempting to keep other students and faculty members out of classrooms, libraries and laboratories. The court order was not being enforced as of tonight, and while a mojority of Columbia students were going about their business, there were several minor scuffles on the campus. 
And in Madison, Wis., police used tear gas and night sticks to break up an antiwar demon­stration by about 2000 students and other persons. Eight persons were arrested, but no one was injured, and authorities later said that little property damage was done. 
The joint statement said that "although none of us can speak for his institution, all of us personally oppose a national policy which seems to be based on the belief that the United States must at almost any cost win the war in which it is engaged in Indichina." 
"The costs of such a policy in human life and suffering are ap­palling and unjustified," the statement said, and "America's withdrawal from this brutal war would represent a recognition that

this country can overcome past mistakes, for which many must assume the blame, and would open possibilities for conciliation that continued hostilities never can provide." 
The statement went on to say that the university presidents "deplore" the bombing and sup­port political action to end it, but "we do not condone coercive action by individuals or groups seeking to impose their particular con­victions or concerns on others."
