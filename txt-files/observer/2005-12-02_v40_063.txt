Iraq war protests lag on campus 

By PETER NINNEMAN 
News Writer 
Despite the elamor of demonstrations and protests immediately following the dec­laration of the Iraq war in March 2003, a relative silence has swept over campus since about the ongoing military conllict. 
Last September, the Notre Dame Peace Coalition held a candlelight vigil for the more than 1,000 U.S. soldiers ­and more than 10,000 Iraqi civilians -lost in the war. The event attracted individuals from different political back­grounds, organizers told The Observer in a Sept. 10, 2004 article.

College is supposed to bn the best four years of life, a time to let loose and be crazy between homework and class, sumo­thing most students arn sad to leave behind -but many stu­dents each year choosn to graduate early. 
Jennifer Locetta, an American Studies major, is one such student. 
"I decided to graduate early for a number of reasons, one of them being that I didn't really have to take a lot of' classes other semesters in order to do it," she said. 
Completing all class requirn­ments early was a factor for political science major Adam Hussell, as well. 
"I actually had planned on graduating a year early since I've been done with my major classes sincn last ynar, but. I had to drop a elass and rwednd to stay to take my seeond the­ology as a rnsult," he said. 
Christy Dietz, a psychology major and religious studies minor at Saint Mary's, decided to graduate early beforn she even arriv1~d at collnge her freshman year. 
"Freshman year when I real­ized I was going to start ofT with I H credits from IAdvancml Placmnnnt cours<~sl and post­secondary classes in high selwol, I just thought it sound­ed like a cool thing to do," shn

SMC expresses intent to diversify catnpus 
By MEGAN O'NEIL Saint Mary's Editor 
Saint Mary's President for Enrollment Management Daniel Meyer said he is committed to diversifying not only the College's student body, but also it's faculty and staff, at a Student Diversity Board (SOB) forum Thursday. 
"The effort to diversify at this campus is going to be ongoing, and it is going to bn from here on out. ... We are going to change," he said. 
Meyer was one of four speak­ers, including SDB president Amanda Shropshire, coordina­tor of Women's Studies Astrid Henry and director of Hnsident Life Michelle Hussell, to ofl'er his perspective on how a more diverse atmosphere can con­tribute to the College's excel­lence. 
"Frankly, you can come to Saint Mary's with very unhealthy attitudes about diver­sity, and in the fours years here !never have those attitudes challenged)," he said. 
Meyer said with incrnased diversity comes grnater sensitiv­ity. Further. the term "liberal arts" is Latin for "liberating the mind."

INSIDE CoLUMN 


A football fan's holiday wish list 
1. 
A kicker -our best kicker was hurt and wearing a knee brace, yet Charlie kept sending him out onto the field because who else was he going to put in? Here's hoping we get someone with a golden Tom Chesnick foot so we never have to worry about losing a AssistantAds game over a Manager missed extra point again. And how about letting Brady punt from now on? He is leading the nation in punting with a 48-yard average. 

2. 
A bowl victory for the Irish ­with a BCS bowl win, Notre Dame will finish in the top five in the country for the first time in what seems like an eternity. 

3. 
That USC win its bowl game and go undefeated until we hand them a humiliating loss next sea­son en route to a National Championship. 

4. 
That James Aldridge is the next Reggie Bush. 

5. 
Two more inches for Ambrose Wooden because the kid is our best corner and with those few extra inches, who knows what could have happened (see USC game). 

6. 
That Victor Abiamiri's four sacks against the Cardinal on Saturday become a regular occur­rence· next season. 

7. 
An upset Heisman victory for Brady Quinn this year, because let's face it-that would be awesome. 

8. 
A reunion between Charlie Weis and Romeo Crennel, the head coach of the Cleveland Browns and former Patriots defensive coordina­tor. With Romeo coaching the defense, we wouldn't lose another game for at least 20 years. 

9. 
Another year of eligibility for Mr. Stovall. Can you imagine a wide receiver set comprised of the Shark, MoSto and Rhema? We would average somewhere around 100 points a game. 

10. 
A better selection for the Leprechaun next year. Well, at least one who knows what he's doing and doesn't struggle to do push-ups with the cheerleaders. 

11. 
That Brandon Hoyte and Corey Mays go on to have success­ful NFL careers because they deserve it. 

12. 
Free season tickets to the guys in pink shirts who kept put­ting up the football recruits during the games -even if they weighed 300 pounds. 

13. 
For next year, a wish that the police, excise or whatever you want to call them leave the tail­gates before games alone and try to find something better to do. Let the fans have some fun and quit ruining an important aspect of the Notre Dame football experience ­tailgates.

Carnegie Hall hosts SMC choir 
45 College students perform at New York City's historic venue 
By AMANDA SHROPSHIRE 
Nt·w, Wrilcr 
Forty-five Saint Mary's stu­dents now know the answer to the age-old Nnw York joke, "how do you gel to Carnegie llall?'' 
The answer: lots of practice. 
Tlw Saint Mary's College Wonwn's Choir travnled to the Big Apple from Nov. I 9 to Nov. 22 to perform in the historic vmwn. 
Dr. Nancy Mnnk, chair of the Saint Mary's musk department and direetor of the Women's and Collegiate Choirs at the College, has directed the ehoir in an ensmnble at the llall sev­eral times in the past 12 years. 
"We provide this opportunity at least onee evnry four years so that each student W~L<; the chance to do this while she is at Saint M1~ry's," ..~enk satd. l.ach time we've done different rnpertoire." 
While in pre­vious years the choir brought 
along alumnae to supplement the Wonwn's Choir, this year it was unnecessary as 45 choir nwmlwrs made the trip. They performed a total of eight pieces from contemporary American composer Gwyneth Walker's "Women's Voiees and Orehestra" series alongside six other ehoirs and an orehestra. 
The 220 total performance members blended voices and experienee 

To prepare for the perform­ance while in New York, the choir spent 11 hours praeticing with the other choirs -one hour of which was with the orchestra.

Challenges face youth 
sports, researcher says 
Special to The Observer 
There are some glaring ethi­cal problems in Ameriean youth sports -from cheating to taunting to disrespect-but the news isn't all bad, accord­ing to a new study co-authored by University of Notre Dame researcher F. Clark Power. 
"The Sport Behavior of Youth, Parents, and Coaches: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," the study evaluated responses to a survey by 803 athletes ranging in age from nine to 15, as well as 189 par­ents and 61 youth sports coaches. 
Key findings among the young athletes included: 
+ 
Almost one in 10 acknowl­edged cheating

+ 
31 percent argued with an official 

+ 
13 percent made fun of a less-skilled teammate 

+ 
27 percent admitted to act­ing like a "bad sport" 


Compounding the above find­ings was a lack of remorse for such actions. Fourteen percent of the youngsters said they believe cheating is acceptable behavior, and 32 percent con­sider arguing with officials to be part of the game. 
The study also found poor behavior among parents and coaches. 
For example, 13 percent of 
parents aeknowledged angrily criticizing tlwir child's per­formance. Among coaches, eight percent encouraged their athletes to hurt an opponnnt, seven pereent condoned cheat­ing, 33 percent admitted to yelling at players for making mistakes and 20 percent had made fun of a team member with limited skills. 
Perhaps most alarming, four percent of the young athletes reported that a coach had hit, kieked or slapped them. 
But there was somn good news in the study. 
Most of the participants said they enjoy their sports experi­ences, and most parents believe their children's coaches do a good job.

said. "I also realized it would save a semester's tuition if I could graduate early. At that point I started planning on it." 
Saving money on tuition was also a factor in Locetta's deci­sion to graduate early. 
"Money-wise, if I didn't have to take another semester, why would I?" Locetta said. ''I'd rather save the money." 
The perception is that early graduation gives students an advantage in the competitive job market students face after school, but this might not always be the case. Locetta's search was not influenced by her decision to graduate early because she already had a job. , 
"Graduating early hasn't really affected my job search because I already have a job, and since it's in the private sector, it wasn't much of a factor," Locetta said. 
Searching for a career was­n't an issue for Russell or Dietz either, as they both plan on attending graduate school. Early graduation won't affect their application process, but will provide them with some time off before starting gradu­ate classes. 
''I've been planning on going to law school so graduating early hasn't really had an affect on that except I'm going to have eight months of dead time in between," Russell said. "I am going to go back home and get some kind of job in the meantime, but it's kind of awkward because it's not long enough to get any type of respectable job." 
Dietz is also looking forvyard to the opportunity to gain work experience. 
"As the years passed I start­ed to become more and more scared of the idea of leaving Saint Mary's any sooner than I had to, but I knew there was no turning back so I began comforting myself with the idea that graduating early would give me seven to eight months of full-time work experience before starting graduate school in the fall," she said. 
In January, Dietz said she will move into an apartment and work as a full-time coun­selor at a women's care cen­ter in South Bend. 
"I volunteered there over the summer and when they found out I would be looking for work they offered me a full-time position," she said, "It's a job I love and I'm really excited about it."

tion, but leav­'7just couldn 't day in and day ing behind an justify paying to out," she said. "I endeared place love Saint Mary's

any regrets about graduat­ing a semester early, but has begun to think about his decision now that his time on-campus is dwin­dling. 
"I have been planning on graduating early, but now that senior year is here, I think I will regret missing second semester because people are busy with interviewing and applying to graduate school first semester," he said. "Second semester is more of a time to unwind, and I am sad that I won't be able to hang out with my friends. [But] I just couldn't justify paying to take four useless electives to lot of friends behind, but she also laments not being able to spend more time with her classmates in the second semester. 
"I have a lot of friends in grades ahead of me, so that was another reason I wanted to graduate early," Locetta said. "I don't feel like I will be missing out on a lot, but I have noticed that people are much more relaxed about who they hang out with as seniors and I have met more people this year than I have any other year as a result." 
Dietz faces a different situa­tion once she leaves campus because her job will keep her in South Bend, though she too will miss her friends and being on campus everyday. 
"I think I really am going to 
miss just being 
here on campus 
and giving me a 
degree. On the 
other hand, I have 
decided to live and work in South Bend rather than moving away second semester so I won't have to leave my friends or miss out on any events." 
Despite the few regrets she has about leaving her under­graduate years behind, Dietz said the positive outweighed the negative and recommends early graduation to anyone who might be giving it thought. 
"My best advice for anyone thinking about trying to grad­uate early is this -go for it," she said.

U.S. allies withdraw from Iraq 
Bulgaria and Ukraine pull out troops; six other countries consider reductions 
Associated Press 

VIENNA -Two of 
America's allies in Iraq 
are withdrawing forces 
this month and a half­
dozen others are debating 
possible pullouts or 
reductions, increasing 
pressurn on Washington 
as calls mount to bring 
home U.S. troops. 

Bulgaria and Ukraine will begin withdrawing their eombined 1,250 troops by mid-December. If Australia, Britain, Italy, Japan, Poland and South Korea reduce or recall their personnel, more than half of the non­American forces in Iraq could be gone by next summnr. 
Japan and South Korea help with reconstruction, but Britain and Australia provide substantial sup­port forces and Italy and Poland train Iraqi troops and police. Their exodus would deal a blow to American efforts to pre­pare Iraqis to take over the most dangerous peacekeeping tasks and craft an eventual U.S. exit strategy.

Landmark execution carried out 
Associated Press 

HALEIGII -A man who killed his wife and father-in-law pinned his hopes on last-minute intervention from the governor or the eourts as he awaited lnthal injection early Friday in the nation's 1,OOOth exncution since capital punishment rnsumod in 1977. 
Kenneth Lne Boyd, set to dio at 2 a.m., spent the day receiving visitors, induding two sons who watchnd him gun down thnir mother and grandfa­ther in 198S. 
"I le would love to live and he would love to have tho governor and the courts step in, but he's also facing the possibility that won't happen," said Boyd's lawyer. Thomas Maher. 
Larger-than-normal erowds of pro­testers were expected at the prison in Raleigh, and vigils were planned across the state. Prison officials planned to tighten security. 
The U.S. Supreme Court and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected appeals by Boyd's lawyers Thursday. 
The defonse also sought elemency from Democratic Gov. Mike Easley, but thoro was little to suggest Boyd would get it. The governor granted condemned inmates clemency only twice in noarly live years in ol'lice, during whieh time 22 inmates haw~ been put to death. 
Boyd, 57, did not d(~IIY that he shot and killed Julie Curry Boyd, 3h, and her father, 57-yoar-old Thomas Dillard Curry. Family members said Boyd stalked his estranged wife after they separated following 13 stormy years of marriage and onee sent a son to her house with a bullet and a threatoning note. 
During the slayings, Boyd's son Christopher was pinned under his mother's body as Boyd unloadnd a .357-Magnum into hnr. Tlw boy pushnd his way under a bed to nscapn the barrage. Anothnr son grablwd tiH~ pistol while Boyd tried to rPioad.

stories that have overwhelmed the nation, such as Hurricane Katrina [and] the Libby indict­ment," said Colin Taylor, co­president of the Notre Dame College Democrats. 
Taylor said "crass 24-hour media outlets," which he said habitually favor murder stories over Iraq coverage, are also to blame. 
Political science professor Louis Ayala said students may not even be watching news, and major media outlets tend not to gear their chosen coverage toward the student demograph­ic.

"Many students oppose the war and want U.S. troops to come home, but like many Americans they are unsure about when and how military exit should take place," he said. 
Catherine Kent, vice president of the Notre Dame College Libertarians, said there is a gen­eral political apathy at the University linked to the absence of lasting protests and demon­strations. 
"People do care -although perhaps not as much as they should -but it is difficult to see how demonstrations or protests in South Bend could have a viable effect on the persuasions of policy makers in Washington and interest groups in major cities," she said. 
Kent and Ayala agreed that when students weigh the costs and benefits of remaining politi­cally informed and active, they generally don't see the benefits as coming out on top, tending to deem only the immediate results worthwhile. 
"When opposition to the war did not end it within the time frame in which it was expected to, many people lost their fervor and moved on with their lives," Kent said. 
Despite popular belief. Nickerson said college students are generally not activists. 
"There are only a handful of campuses known for activism, lsueh asl Madison or Berkeley -students don't come to South Bend to protest," he said. ''I'm sure students are talking and arguing about the war [in small­er venues!. Many college stu­dents enjoy debating and argu­ing." 
Ayala agreed and said he did­n't think Notre Dame was out of the "mainstream." 
"The consensus is similar to the rest of college campuses," he said. "For whatever reason, most students don't see this pol­icy of impact as having any influence on them land] they don't see it as being worthy their resources." 
Nickerson said in order to stage a large-scale activity, both organizers and willing partici­pants are necessary. 
"Most college campuses exhibit a dearth of both right 
now  and Notre Dame is  no  
exception,"  he  
said.  



Diversity

ferent view points," he said. 

As Henry approached the podium, she asked those pres­ent to look around and exam­ine the people in attendance. 
"I think we see a lot more faces of color tonight than if we were pulling the entire school," she said. 
Henry said she had hoped to see more white faces, and sug­gested the makeup of the group indicated something about the importance of diver­sity among many white stu­dents at the College. 
The ethnic breakdown of the Saint Mary's student body is 
91.4 percent white, 3.4 per­cent Latina. 0.8 percent black, 
2.81 percent Asian, 0.5 per­school graduates, with two million fewer white students and 1.5 additional minority students. 
If Saint Mary's sticks to its traditional white roots, its recruiting pool will shrink, he said. 
"We need to be very serious and very committed to diversi­ty or we need to face the reali­ty that we will have fewer stu­dents, fewer faculty and fewer administrators," Meyer said. 
Meyer said his goal was to have minority enrollment at the College between 12 per­cent and 15 percent within the next five years. The break­down should be representative of the states it pulls from ­mainly Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio, he said. 
Meyer said the admissions office must begin to reach out to different high schools, including those in the South Bend area. 
"I think the thing the admis­sions office needs to do is go fishing in a different pond," he said. 
But Shropshire said some people mistake the need for diversity as a need to increase the number of minorities on campus, or to make those minorities already here feel more comfortable. 
Instead, she said diversity is about learning about other people's life experiences and expanding one's own. A diverse campus would be "an asset" to the College and would add to a "well-rounded college experience." 
"If that means sitting with someone outside of your circle for lunch or going to a club meeting to meet different peo­ple or becoming a member of a board that deals with diversity, or staying to ask questions on how you can help at the end of this forum, you have taken the proper steps to help further empowerment of the women of Saint Mary's College," she said. 
All speakers said a diverse student body and staff would include individuals from vary­ing ethnic, socioeconomic, reli­gious and sexually oriented backgrounds. 
Russell said other Catholic institutions -such as DePaul -have created welcoming environments for students by establishing student centers and dorms for gay and lesbian students. 
Diversity training is a good starting point for her and other members of the College com­munity, Russell said. 
"As a white person, I have to start by educating myself," Russell said. "I have to make an effort ... I have to be the person who wants to engage." 
The academic life of Sain Mary's would also benefit from a more diverse student bod and faculty, Henry said. As white woman, she said sh often finds herself teaching class of all white students. Bu 
she strives to diversify her cur riculum. 
"We are not going to jus read white writers and whit women," she said. "Why? Because that is not reality." 
Both Meyer and Russell said a diverse faculty and staff would increase classroom dis­cussion -a crucial improve­ment for the College. 
"I would put faculty and staff diversification as a far greater [need] right now than [that of1 the [student body)." Meyer said 
Saint Mary's alumnae can also play a major role in diver­sifying the student body, Meyer said. 
"I think the other thing is we need to engage our alumnae," he said. "We have a lot of alumnae, especially diversity alumnae, who are not engaged with the institution."

president of the NO Peace Coalition, said the group has participated in numerous events off-campus, but has "neglected" to hold a lot of on-campus events. 
"We're going to do our best to promote more activism [next semester] ... and maybe work with other political campus groups," she said. 
Although campus groups have not organized any visible demonstrations on campus, some Notre Dame students have taken a more proactive approach to political involve­ment by attending rallies in Atlanta and Washington, D.C. 
Members of the College Democrats also attended Cindy Sheehan's visit to South Bend earlier in the year. Sheehan, the mother of late U.S. Army percent Hispanic, 3.6 percent Asian, 0.7 percent American Indian and 1.6 percent bira­cial. 
She predicted that by 2050, there will be no majority race in the United States and said it is already a fact in several states and major cities. 
"We live in a country that is racially diverse," Henry said. "I think we do our students a disservice if we do not prepare them for living in that environ­ment." 
Meyer said Saint Mary's will face serious consequences if it does not address major demo­graphic changes in the United States' high school population. Estimates show that by 2015, there will be a demographic swing of 3. 5 million high

Letterman greets Oprah as guest 
16-yearfeud didn't deter the media queen from 'Late Show' appearance 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Oprah Winfrey and David Letterman buried the hatchet Thursday on "The Late Show" and wondered just how their 16-year feud started in the first place. 
"Could you tell me please what has transpired?" Winfrey asked Letterman during the show. "I have never for a moment had a feud with you." 
It was Winfrey's first guest appearance on "The Late Show" with Letterman, although she twice appeared on his NBC show before the comic moved to CBS in 1993. 
While presenting Letterman with a gift, she alluded to his much-maligned joke as an Academy Awards host in 1995 -the awkward "Oprah, Uma. Uma, Oprah" introduction. 
The gift, wrapped in purple to coincide with the opening of the Winfrey-produced Broadway musical "The Color Purple," was a signed, framed photograph of herself and Uma Thurman. 
"I want you to know, it's really over, whatever you thought was happening," Winfrey said. 
Letterman, seeing the photo, n~sponded: "Are you sure it's ?"

Letterman has frequently joked about Winfrey through the years, and he devoted plenty of time this week to hyping the Thursday appearance. In 2003, Winfrey told Time magazine she wouldn't go on his show

Oprah Winfrey appeared on David Letterman's "Late Night" Thursday after a rumored 16-year long feud. 
because she's been "completely uncomfortable" as the target of his jokes. 
"I can't thank you enough," Letterman said Thursday. "It means a great deal to me and I'm just very happy you're here." 
''Does it really?" asked Winfrey. ''I've been hearing for the past week you talking about it, and I didn't know if you were really serious or you were just doing your 'Dave thing."' 
But Letterman proved his 
intentions were earnest, dis­cussing in-depth Winfrey's efforts to lend support to com­munities in Africa and the good intentions of her syndicated pro­gram, "The Oprah Winfrey Show." 
"You have meant something to the lives of people," Letterman said. "We're just a TV show." 
The approach clearly caught Winfrey off guard, as she repeatedly exclaimed, "I can't believe you're being this seri­ous!"

Nogales, presi­dent of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, part of the multi-eth­nic coalition. "It's encouraging, but the numbers are still not where they should be." 
Individual report cards were issued by the National Latino Media Council and the Asian Pacific American Media Coalition. Mark Reed, chairman of American Indians in Film and Television, gave the networks F grades across the board. 
"The American Indian is invis­ible in prime-time television," he said. 
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which monitors the rep­resentation of blacks on televi­sion, is expected to issue its diversity report card in January. 
Hispanics made noteworthy strides this year, Nogales said, particularly at ABC. He lauded the network for two of its prime­time programs, "The George Lopez Show" and "Freddie," which feature largely Hispanic casts and show some characters speaking Spanish. 
ABC earned the highest over­all marks from the Hispanic and Asian advocacy groups. It's a significant shift for the network, which "was beyond an F-six years ago," said Karen Narasaki, chairman of the A<>ian Pacific American Media Coalition. 
ABC shows "Lost" and "Grey's Anatomy" were celebrated for featuring Asian-American actors, writers, producers and directors. Two Asian-American actors earned Emmy nomina­tions this year for their roles on ABC shows, Narasaki noted. 
Fox, cited as a champion of TV diversity three years ago, lost favor this year with Asian and Hispanic groups. According to the report cards, the network comes up short in 
Asian per­
formers. 
"This is the second year in a row they've dropped," Narasaki said. "How is that that 'House' can be set in a hospital and there are no regular Asian­American roles?" 
CBS lacks significant opportu­nities for Asian-American actors and writers, Narasaki said. 
"After five years, we haven't seen much progress," she said. 
The network fared better with the Hispanic graders, who note CBS employs a large number of Hispanic actors and directors. 
NBC has "huge numbers" of Hispanic actors and more than 20 Hispanic directors working on its programs, Nogales said. Asian writers maintain a notable presence at the network, but acting and producing roles declined significantly over the past year, Narasaki said. 
Of 370 NBC episodes evaluat­ed, only one was produced by an Asian-American, she said. 
The Multi-Ethnic Media Coalition began issuing its diver­sity report cards in 1999, when a nearly all-white schedule of new network series provoked an outcry from civil rights groups, leading to agreements by broad­casters to improve their per­formance.

Richn1ond president calls students 'n1ush' 
Associated Press 
HICIIMOND, Va. -Insulting alumni and donors probably isn't the best way to show that you arc trying to improve your university's national profile, as the president of the University of Hichmond has found. 
During a "state of the uni­versity" speech in October at the private liberal arts college, William E. Cooper discussed the school's ell'orts to become more academically competi­tive by attracting more talent­ed students. 
"The entering quality of our student body needs to be much higher if we are going to transform bright minds into great aehicvers instead of transforming mush into mush, and I mean it," he said. 
lie later apologized for his remarks and said they were misinterpreted. 
Some alumni remain sup­portive of Coopnr's vision, but he has come under lire from many othnrs, who arn calling for him to step down and are threatnning to withhold eontri­butions until hn is gonn. At a rw:nnt home basketball game, some Hichmond fans wore buttons proclaiming, "Mushlwads Unite." 
"It's time to send Cooper to the 'mush' pit and get our lwloved University back on a positive track," Keith Stojka, a I1J1J6 graduate, wrote on an online petition calling for new leadnrship. "By the way, not a r1~d cent from me until Cooper is sent packing." 
Tlw number of signatures approadwd 2,000 Thursday, a day beforo he was to meet with the exeeutive eommittee of the university's Board of Trusl!ws. The full board will tlwn take up his case, univer­sity spokesman Handy Fitzgerald said. 
Cooper denied a request for an interview. 
University spokesman Dan Kalamanson said that no major donors have suspended their pledges over the eontro­versy, but "dearly the situa­tion is something the Board of Trustees, the university does take seriously." 
lie said that students, facul­ty members and alumni should "look at the big picture, the positive things that Dr. Cooper has achieved, and weigh them against the remarks, the changes here that some people may not be supportive of." 
Before coming to Richmond, Cooper was Georgetown University's executive vice president and dean of faculty at Tulane University. 
He started at Richmond in 1998 with a goal of boosting the school's national profile, and to that end Richmond has undertaken a $200 million fund-raising campaign. Also, the school started covering all of students' demonstrated financial need and extending benefits to employees' same­sex partners. 
Cooper angered some stu­dents when the university raised tuition 31 percent this fall to nearly $35,000, among the nation's highest, despite a $1.1 billion endowment. 
University officials have said the increase will bring the 3,000-student university's price in line with that of its competitors and will help pay for scholarships, hire more faculty, update technology and construct and renovate build­ings on the secluded, wooded campus on the edge of Virginia's capital city. 
The sharp price increase has been criticized by people who say that it puts the school out of reach of students from middle-and working-class families. 
Emily Griffey, a 2001 gradu­ate, opposed the tuition increase and disagrees with attempts to make Richmond a Southern version of Brown or Princeton. 
"I don't think students accepted the vision that that was what we needed to become," Griffey said. "Our professors were great. I learned a lot while I was there. My friends all do amaz­ing things." 
First face transplant performed 
Associated Press 
PAHIS -An ethics debate broke out over the world's first partial face transplant Thursday with one surgeon challenging the decision to operate, while others suggested a bit of jealousy might be at play. 
At the same time, several doc­tors raised concerns about the psychological health of the French woman who received a transplanted nose, lips and chin on Sunday. She had been bru­tally mauled by a dog in May, and her identity remains unknown. 
Dr. Laurent Lantieri, an advis­er to the French medical ethics panel, said the surgeons who operated violated the panel's advice because they failed to try reconstructive surgery first. He said a transplant donor was immediately sought without try­ing to repair the woman's face with more conventional sur­gery. 
Lantieri, who had seen a pic­ture of the woman, said, "She had a complete amputation of both lips. The tip of the nose was amputated." Her new donated facial parts came from a brain-dead woman whose family gave consent. 
The panel had previously objected to full face transplants but said partial ones could be considered under strict circum­stances, which included first trying normal surgery. 
"The ethics committee said this kind of transplant should never be considered as an emergency procedure," Lantieri said. 
However, surgeon Denys Pellerin, of the National Consultative Ethics Committee advised by Lantieri said, "as long as the transplant is not total, it is not unethical." 
And Dr. Jean-Pierre Chavoin, secretary general of the French society of plastic surgery, noted that Lantieri had planned to do a face transplant himself and had been beaten. 
Carine Camby, director gener­al of the agency under the French Health Ministry that coordinates organ procure­ment, said normal reconstruc­tive surgery. could not have been used in this case. 
"It is precisely because there now in Dubernard's ward in a was no way to restore the func­Lyon hospital in southern tions of this patient by normal France, was also to have a sec­plastic surgery that we attempt­ond experimental treatment ­ed this transplant," Camby said. an infusion of the donor's bone "She 'could no longer eat nor­marrow -to try to prevent mally, she had great difficulty rejection of the new tissue. speaking and there is no possi­"Maybe Jean-Michel bility with plastic surgery today Dubernard is revolutionizing to repair the muscles around the concept of transplantation," the mouth which allow people Lantieri said, but added that to articulate when they speak the patient now was being sub­andpot spit out food when they jected to two untested treat­eat. ments.

But Chavoin, who took part in preparatory meetings about the patient's case over the last sev­eral months, questioned her psychological health. 
The patient "seems to have quite a depressive profile," he said. 
The operation was done at a hospital in Amiens, in northern France, by ground-breaking transplant surgeon Dr. Jean­Michel Dubernard and Dr. Bernard Devauchellc. Dubernard led teams that per­formed a hand transplant in 1998 and the world's first dou­ble forearm transplant in January 2000. 
The hand transplant recipient later had it amputated. Doctors said the man failed to take the required drugs and his body rejected the limb. 
Lantieri said he was fearful that this operation could turn out like that first hand trans­plant if the patient is psycholog­ically unstable. 
Dubernard did not return a phone call seeking comment Thursday. A news conference is set for Friday. 
The face transplant patient, him he was 
concerned about the circumstances of her injury. It involved one or two dogs, Lantieri said. 
In the United States, surgeons and psychologists at two med­ical centers that hope to offer face transplants the Cleveland Clinic and tho University of Louisville ­declined to comment Thursday on the French ease. 
In an interview at the Cleveland Clinic in July, sur­geon Dr. Maria Siom io now stressod tho several yoars sho had spent developing proce­duros and how carefully her team now is working to snleet potential candidatos for tho operation. 
"I hope nobody will be frivo­lous or do things just for fame. We are almost over-cautious," she said at the time. 
Another surgeon familiar with the French case sounded more optimistic: despite the woman's horrific injuries, which he said were caused by her own dog. 
"She still has her own eyes, which are a lot of a person's expression ... we'd expect she'd turn out to be a ploasant-look­ing girl," Dr. Earl Owen told the Sydney Morning llerald in Australia. 

Narcotic qat captivates Ye111inis 
Associated Press 
SAN'A, Yemen -The writer winked conspiratorially, shifted the golf ball-sized bulge in his left cheek and tapped his temple gently. 
"Qat is good for the mind. I can't stop writing once I start. But the next morning I read what I wrote and tear it up straight away," chuckled 35-year-old Hatem Bamohriz, nibbling yet another leaf of the mild narcotic. 
To many government and aid officials, qat has ceased to be funny: Yemen's government is making another push to cut the use of the rubbery green leaf with amphetamine-like qualities that is blamed for many of this country:s ills, from widesproad poverty to growing health prob­lems. 
But there is little progress. Up to 90 percent of Yemeni men arc now believed to chew qat daily, and growing numbers of women and children are also chewing, the World Bank says. 
"Qat is a disease, and I hope for the day that they'll take it away," said Samra Shaibani, spokeswoman for the World Bank, a leading anti-qat cam­paigner. "But if they do, there would be a revolution because the people have little else and rely on it so much." 
Qat is a centuries-old social custom that stimulates mental activity, long conversations and tall tales in this tribal-dominated nation at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. Qat chewing is ubiquitous -as common in Yemen as wearing a curved dag­ger on the belt. 
Historical records show qat in regular use in the 15th century when Sufi Muslims -a deeply mystical sect -ehewed the qat leaves during prayer and m(~dita­tion. As time passed, ordinary Yemenis increasingly took up tho praetiee at special eelebrations. 
But now, many experts have come to believe it's at the root of Yemen's 40 pereont unemploy­ment rate, its status as tho poor­est country in the Middlo East and its growing national health problems. 
Critics blame qat for every­thing from the country's low eco­nomic productivity to excessive water use to irrigate the qat crop. Some blame it for eating disorders and high cholesterol rates. 
"Qat is the No. 1 socioeconomic: problem of the country," said Khaled al-Shaq, a communiea­tion olliccr for the United Nations Development Project in Yemen. "It manifests all the frustrations of Yemen." 
Under intense international pressure to improve its ailing eeonomy, Yemen's government released a Poverty Heduction Stratef,ry Papnr ree~mtly that tar­geted qat, partieularly as a waste of prndous water. 
In the San'a region ;donn, nflarly throe times as rnueh water goes to qat production as is consunwd by thn population. 
Government leadnrs from President Ali Abdullah Saleh on down also havn announeod tlwy havn given up tlw habit, hoping othors will follow tlwir example.

Senate resolution sound but small 
So it's come to this. 
Concerned students and student government leaders once openly challenged the Common Council of the City of South Bend, contesting the amendment to the Public Nuisance Ordinance it passed in July was untimely and unfair to students. 
Student body president Dave Baron fought during the sum­mer against the Council's decision to pass an ordinance geared specifically at students residing off-campus, especially during a time when few students remained in South Bend to represent themselves. 
But those efforts proved ineffective, as the ordi­
O Jhe
nance was passed then and continues to be 
on the condition that they prove themselves good neighbors, and students must fulfill their part of the bargain by taking first notices to abate seriously. 
As for Notre Dame, the University contributes economically to the city of South Bend, employs some of its residents and has offered on-campus housing to the evicted students -but it is obvious at this point that it has no intention of stepping between its students and the city's Common Council. 
And really, why would it? What would Notre Dame fight the city for-the right for its students to party off-campus? It's an unfortunate situation, one that has 
amassed and compiled into a distasteful topic

has little control over the ordinance's existence, the Student Senate has rightly resorted to tackling the aspect of the ordinance that most negatively affects students -its encouragement that landlords initiate eviction proceedings after one offense. 
The recent evictions following first offenses by off-campus students did not justly award a time period for the residents to "abate" -or cease their violations or "nuisance" -before landlords took action to save themselves. Residents deserve that second chance, and the city's desire to please landlords is not sufficient rationale to warrant overly strict enforcement regard­ing ofT-campus student residents. 
But these students also have to realize they are only a minori­ty of South Bend's population, and by moving into city housing they are proclaiming themselves accountable for upholding the laws in that jurisdiction. The Senate is standing up for students 
The resolution passed by the Senate Wednesday is not overly demanding or laden with complaints. It acknowledges South Bend residents' rights and state law in Indiana while respectfully opposing the aspect of the ordinance that is most damaging to long-term relations between Notre Dame students and the South Bend community. Senate has done well with the options left to it, recommending to the Common Council that it at least adhere to reasonable enforce­ment of its newly imposed ordinance, which is a fair and mature way of approaching the matter. 
But it's a shame that while the Senate has adopted the correct attitude in its latest approach to the Common Council, that approach is all it really has left. Its narrow argument, while jus­tified and well-executed, also sadly illustrates what little power the community has granted at this point to the Senate and the students it represents.

Everything I need to know I learned in kindergarten 
The other day, while reading my morn­ing paper, I became saddened by what I saw. Stan Berenstain had passed away last Saturday at the age of 82. No, Mr. Berenstain was not a close family friend 
or relative of mine, but  
I would bet that his  
name rings a bell with  
many of you. Stan  
Berenstain and his  
wife, Jan, were co­ 
authors of the popular  
children's series The  
Berenstain Bears.  
Perhaps not all of  
you had the same Molly  
experience growing up Acker  
as I had, but as a child  
I recall that not a night  Nobody Likes a  
went by when I did not  Dumb Blonde  
get my bedtime story.  
Most of these nights I  

chose for my mom or dad to read a Berenstain Bears book. Though I was not a cub, nor did my family live in a split­level tree "down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country," I could really relate to the Berenstain's. Just like the Berenstain Bears, my family had a father, mother and older brother. Also just like Papa, Mama, Brother and Sister, we were not perfect and so sometimes we had to learn our lessons too. 
Though I loved to read their tales time and time again, looking back I can see why my parents were always more than happy to oblige with my book requests. Each Berenstain Bears book was an entertaining story, but more importantly, each one had a good lesson for both young and old alike. At the end of each book you could always expect to find Papa Bear with the moral of the story and life for the Berenstain's went on happily ever after. 
While these books about a happy little family of bears do not reflect all aspects contemporary society (the books do not contain families with only a mama bear, step-brother and step-sister bears, or families with two papa bears), they still have good messages for children. I remember reading books by the Berenstain's that emphasized the impor­tance of sharing, doing your chores, not judging someone before you get to know them, cleaning your room, hard work, going to bed on time, and having good manners. In addition, the books eased some of my concerns about traumatic childhood events such as visits to the doc­tor and dentist, as well as a trip to the mall to see Santa Bear. 
By now we should all be practicing ideals on our own without having to look to illustrated bears for an example. Nevertheless, we cannot undermine the fact that these books were a great way to teach us how to become the caring, com­passionate, responsible and hardworking young adults we are today. As children we are easily influenced by the things we hear and see. Today many people argue that with all the violence on television and in video games, children are becoming overexposed to adult themes and growing up too fast. These people feel that society would be better off ifit reverted back to some of its more traditional values. They stress that, just as Papa and Mama Berenstain were always there to teach Brother and Sister a lesson, parents should take an active role in their chil­dren's lives. 
The death of a man who could instill these essential values in children is truly a great loss. Through the Berenstain Bears, Stan and Jan Berenstain were able to solve everyday family situations and teach children basic "do's" and "don'ts." These lessons transcend decades and genera­tions, which helps explain why the Berenstain Bears remain a popular series for children throughout the world after 42 years. Today you can find the Berenstain Bears on television, on stage at your local theaters and you can even email Papa, Mama, Brother and Sister Berenstain via the official Berenstain Bears website. 
Upon his death, many people have expressed their sympathies to the Berenstain family and have shared their gratitude for the books that had influ­enced so many of us growing up. While many thanked Berenstain for wonderful childhood memories and the joy they got from reading his books, others reflected on what they had learned from his books. One Arizona woman wrote, "The Berenstain Bears books taught manners, morals and about family. Something the world could use a little more of. Wouldn't it be great ifwe all thought like Stan & Jan?" 
How very true that is. The world would be a much better place ifwe could all take the most basic lessons we learned as children to heart as adults.

The church vs. state question 
Tho Founding Fathnrs did not invent religious tolerance-it 
had already formnd out of the circumstancflS that created the 
original eolonies-however their unique perspective gave 
them tho presence of mind to enshrine it in the Constitution, in 
tlw form of the separation of church and state, and so to pro­
tnet it from less-gentle hands that might gov­
nrn in thn future. Tlwy were not unreligious 
nwn, ynt they unders"tood that a certain dis­
tancn is required between politics and reli­
gion, for the protection of both. 
Wn still dwell in the nation of their legacy, and tlw consequences of embracing pluralism as a public virtue are widespread. There are few societies, if any, that are simultaneously as secular and as religious as the United Stattls, or where questions of the relationship hntween church and stat11 arn taken up more finretdy by morn peopln. This is a sign of tho nation's health. 
llownvnr. for pnopln of faith-nspeeially those who prnctiee religions like Christianity and Islam. which do not embrace the equality of otlwr lwlids-the nature of tlw country raises a difficult ques­tion. What dons it mnan to be a n1ligious pnrson in such a toler­ant and pluralistic soeinty and how can one embrace all of Llwsn vahws while cornpmmising none? 
I like to think of this as the Notre Dame question. Because of t.hn unusual location of the University betwenn spiritual and secular polns, this qunstion underlins many of the finrcest dPI>atns that or.r.ur hnrn. Exam pins include tlw treatment of gay stud11nts and staff, calls for cnnsorship by those who find per­formances likn "The Vagina Monologues" "inconsistent" with Catholic values and the nver growing pressure from the Vatican to control which theologians are allowed to tea<~h and what Llwy may say. 
llowevnr, Notrn Dame is a very insulated microcosm that is only beginning to reflect a wider trend sweeping Christian ehurdws and the nation. The coupling between religion and politics has grown stronger in the past decade, to the ultimate detriment of each. This union has already produced some very strange bedfellows, like the Hepublican Party's unstable mix­turn of traditional small-government conservatives and reli­gious tlwocons who will spend any amount of money in pursuit of thnir social agendas. 
This dose relationship is dangerous, because it tempts reli-. gious leaders to use their authority to directly impact govern­mont in dubious ways, for example declaring that voting for a particular candidate is immoral, or ostracizing political leaders wlwn thnir public views do not match those of the religion. It takes more than the restraint of the State to make the Anwrican system work; it also requires a degree restraint on t.hn part of religions not to undermine it. Under this pressul'e the very idea of separation of church and state and the toler­ance and pluralism that arn built on it begin to crumble. 
Here is a realistic example. There are, at present, four Catholics on thn UnitPd States Supreme Court, and if Samuel /\lito is 1~onfirnwd (as he is likely to be) then there will be five. llowevnr, just because a justice is Catholic it does not follow that his lngal views are in lockstep with his private moral views or that either of these are in lockstep with the views of the Catholic Church. Many people in government see no inconsis­tency in having differing public and private moral opinions, and indnnd for justices of the Supreme Court, called to unbiased judgment on the merits of the law, such a separation is almost a fiH]Uirnment. 
Heeently United States bishops have threatened to withhold communion from politicians who vote in ways that are not con­sistent with the views of the Church (the centerpiece of this was .John Kerry and abortion, though there is no reason that the sarnn pressures could not be exerted by the bishops for any other issue). If this threat were extended to the justices on the basis of how they rule then five-including Chief Justice Hoberts-would be placed under duress, where they would havn to choose between their duty to the nation and the risk of outright public rejection by their churches. 
If this situation were to actually occur, then the most likely outcome would be as many as five of the nine justices with­drawing themselves from the case that brought the threat, if a quorum (six justices) were lacking, then the Court itself would hn forced to withdraw from the case altogether. Following such an event thn Court would bn, at worst, powerfully disinclined to lwar eases that might place it in such a dangerous position again or at best, tho Catholic justices who saw an irresolvable obstade to their ability to do their duty would feel compelled to rnsign. 
In short, an unjust and incautious attempt to control the Court through roligious means would, in the end, bring about rnsulls dnsired by neither the Court nor the Church, and would ultimatnly 1:a~sn incaleulable harm to both and to the nation.

The art of dying 
It is sometimes said that the English care more about animals than people. The evidence suggests however that it's only furry animals we care about more than people. 
Sir Paul McCartney recently announced that he would never perform in China because he had learnt about the barbaric cruelty of the Chinese fur trade, which includes traflkking in fur from cats and dogs. Now I consider myself as much of a cat-lover as a man can be without compromising his rugged machismo, but China is a communist state in which both female infanticide and child labor are widespread and in whieh citizens lack many of the most basic politi­cal freedoms. The fact that it took a PET/\ doeumentary about the terrible things they do to cats and dogs over them to spark McCartney's outrage suggests a rather blas!1 attitude to all the terrible things done to the Chinese people. The former Beatie is now in his 60s and well past the point at which idealism unconstrained by anything resembling a sense of perspective is endearing. 
When .John Lennon was shot in 1980 his early death ensured that his myth would be preserved intact. lam not old enough to remember Lennon's assassination, but I vividly recall Kurt Cobain's suicide in 1994, whieh sent shockwaves nf sorrow through my contemporaries. Many of them called it a tragedy. Even at the tin1e it struck me that there was something bogus and self-deceived about their mourning. Not that the sorrow wasn't genuine, but on some level Cobain's fans had always needed more from him than his music; they needed him to die. 
When your heart is broken, it feels as if your whole self splits in two. Part ofyoujust wants the pain to go away, but another part feels that to ever recover from it would amount to a kind of betrayal by your future self. Angst-ridden teenagers often experience a similar phenome­non, and the fear that their sense of alienation and despair may indeed be "just a phase" as their (impossibly-old) parents keep telling them, they are driven to identify with figures like Cobain for whom the same feelings seemed to remain raw and strong into adulthood. The sad truth is that if your emotional appeal rests on your status as the embodiment of teenage angst then sooner or later you have to kill yourself just to prove that you really mean it. Eventually even staying alive would be selling out. 
Trent Heznor of Nine Inch Nails has been mak­ing dark, angst-ridden music for over 15 years. Ilis debut album was released in the same year as Nirvana's Bleach and he's still producing albums full or rage and despair, set against the kind of sounds that suggest that he's playing the guitar

these days it feels fake; sure, Heznor may really 
be feeling angry and alienated, but by now those 
feelings are just part of his job description. 
An artist whose authenticity has never bmm in doubt is Johnny Cash. The son of a eotton farmer, in 1955 Cash auditioned fi>r Sun Hoeords as part of a gospel act, but was ofl'ernd a contract singing country music in which he was told he had a future. Cash took the advice and the contraet, and in the fall of 1969 he ouL'iold the Beatles. 
The recent film Walk the Line deals with tho early part of Cash's lifb, his struggle with alcohol and painkillers, and his legendary romance and marriage to June Carter, while lopping the story to fit the Procrustean convnntions of the biopie genre. But personally, it's the last part of Cash's life that interest.'> me most. 
In 2002 Johnny Cash released thn fi>urth and final volume of the American Heeordings series that he began almost a deeade before with llw producer Hick Hubin. The album eontainnd an extraordinary cover of Trent Heznor's "Hurt." The song was inevitably ovnrplayed, and film and loin­vision producers quickly adopted it as tho nnw track to use whenever they needed to create a moment of guaranteed pathos but eouldn 't trust their plot and actors to get them on their own (bcfim~ "llurt" came along Jell" Buckley's version of Leonitrd Cohen's "Hallelujah" was the most­overusnd fi1r this purpose).

You have probably seen the video, which won countless awards. But it's less likely that you have heard the final album, The Man Comes ;\round. I suggest you do, not for the reeording of "llurt," but for the very last track, Cash's rendition of "We'll Meet Again." That's not a gospel song of course, but when it's sung joyfully and even a little playfully by a dying man with a cracked voice, it becomes one.

DPAC SPOTLIGHT 

'Capote' not just a brilliant biography 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN Assistant Scene Editor 

Biographical films tend to start at the beginning of a life and end with death. "Capote" takes a somewhat different approach -it starts with events that inspired a novel and ends with the events that complete it. 
"Capote" chronicles the relationships and events that go into shaping one of the author's novels rather than focusing on his life. The film follows the development of "In Cold Blood," which is both Capote's masterpiece and his final book. 
The f1lm begins with the violent and shocking murder of the Clutter family in rural Kansas. This event attracts the attention of Capote, Capote cism. who becomes fasci­Catherine nated with the mur­Keener, in a drastic ders and decides to turn from her last write about them. role in "The 40­

about the murders, mix of warmth, 
By MARK BEMENDERFER Assistant Scene Ediror 

Adam West move over, there's a new Batman in town. 
In the recent DVD release "Batman Begins," Christian Bale assumes the identity of the eaped crusader to spec­tacular effect. Set as an introduction of sorts to the Batman mythology, "Begins" is the perfect movie for the uninitiated and the avid comic fan alike. 
The first thing that "Begins" does is to set itself apart from the other Batman films, mainly the ones helmed by Tim Burton. It follows a more faith­ful translation of the comic, depicting the murder of Bruce's parents in a way that followed the Dark Knight comics. It also follows the comic more faithfully in other ways as well, particularly in Batman's refusal to kill. 
For those who don't know Batman from Man-Bat, Batman is really the fic­tional millionaire Bruce Wayne. He lived in Gotham City with his loving parents, and his life was perfect up until a fateful night following a stage performance. It was then that his par­ents were killed before his eyes in a 
formance. His portrayal of Capote cap­
tures the simultaneouslycharming and 
disturbing nature of the character. 
While the movie chronicles the develop­
ment of "In Cold Blood" and the events 
that inspired it, two relationships in 
Capote's life make up the true heart of the 
film. 

The friendship between Capote and his childhood friend and fellow author, Harper Lee, is central to understanding the action in the film and Capote himself. · She behaves as both a friend and mother figure in his life, and coddles the difficult author through the trials he faces while writing "In Cold Blood." While she is patient and supportive of the frequently childish and quixotic author, Lee also pro­vides some of his most scathing criti­
but the longer he works with those involved, specifically the murderers, the more complicated his feelings and motiva­tions become. 
Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of the likable but complicated author is one of the highlights of the film. His high, wavering lisp initially makes the author seem almost comical, but it swiftly becomes part of the emotional impact of the lilm through Hoffman's powerful per-
compassion and 
steely resolve. Her performance, while not as flashy or noticeable as Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Capote himself. anchors the film and gives it emotional stability. 
The other major relationship in the film emerges between Capote and one of the murderers. Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.). Capote becomes deeply and emotion­ally involved with the perpetrator in an attempt to get as close to the motivation 
DVD REVIEW 

'Batman Begins' DVD offers more than expected 
bumbled robbery. This in turn set Bruce on his path to becoming Batman, the bane of criminals everywhere. 
The movie dedicates much of its run­ning time to depicting Bruce's transfor­mation into Batman.· The Batman cos­tume isn't even seen until around an hour into it. 
Instead, the time is spent on develop­ing first how B.ruce gained his hatred for criminals, and then how he became trained to combat them. 
Many characters went into influenc­ing Bruce's transformation, including his father Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), his butler Alfred (Michael Caine), among others. However, the majority of his transformation occurs due to two characters. The. first is Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes). Holmes feels unconvincing in her role as Rachel, and while she does a decent job, it feels a little lacking. 
The second influence on Bruce's life was Henri Ducard, played fantastically by Liam Neeson. The role of mentor is one Neeson is familiar with, having taken a similar role in "Star Wars: Episode 1." Neeson does a great job of portraying a person with a background similar to Bruce's, one whose loved ones were taken away by violence. 
The secondary charac­ters were all solid, and played by respectable actors. Gary Oldman played Jim Gordon, a sta­ple of the Batman comic. Since this is "Batman Begins," Gordon is not the highly ranked police official he is in the stan­dard comic. Instead, the movie depicts Gordon as a lowly grunt, the single behind the murder, but he grows terrified with how close he comes to evil. 
The· two share similar childhoods, caus­ing Capote to feel that he isn't far removed from these actions. 
"It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. And one day he went out the back door and I went out the front," Capote said. 
One major question the film puts forth is whether Capote actually empathized with the criminals or if he was simply using them to further his literary career. "In Cold Blood" remains unfinished for much of the film because Smith and his accom­plice, Richard Hickock, get several stays of executions, which drives Capote close to a nervous breakdown. 
After the murderers are executed, 
Capote sobs to Harper Lee that he did all he could for them, to which she replies, 'The fact is, you didn't want them to live." Her cutting remark reveals that only when the criminals died could Capote actually finish his book, and his desire to be loved by the literati may have quashed any of his feelings of empathy. 
Overall, "Capote" is an intriguing por­trait of a flawed and fascinating author and the trials and successes that go into writing a novel. A great cast and even direction make it an interesting look into the events and people that ultimately shaped a great and important American novel and its writer.

cient police. 

Cillian Murphy plays the criminally 
under-used Dr. Jonathan Crane. 
Delegated to a supporting role within the 
movie, this Batman villain steals the 
scene every time he makes an appear­
ance, and hopefully makes a return in 
the sequel. 

There are two DVDs on the market ­a sparse standard edition and the special edition. For the money, the special edi­tion is the superior choice. It comes with ·a second disk that contains many special features, commentaries, and behind-the­scene technical showcases. It also comes with a special comic book that has snip­
pets of the influential Batman comics. However, there were some legal issues with the eomic, forcing the special edi­tion to be discontinued. 
There. are still some special editions left to be found though, making it a decent holiday purchase. · 
"Batman Begins" is a great movie for everyone. It's a super-hero movie done correctly, with a compelling lead and storyline. But if you decide to pick it up, pick up the standard edition at your own risk. There may not be enough "Batman" to fill your craving.

SWORDS AND SANDALS, REDUX 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN Assis1am Scene Ediwr 
Films basnd on ancient Greek and Homan eulturn, often refnrred to as swords-and-sandals films, have lluctuat­od in popularity throughout einematie history. Tho gonre is currently experi­IHJcing a resurgence thanks to the new IIBO s1wies, "Home." 
Fascination with these ancient cultures has nndurnd for centuries, and it has lwnn a subjed for film since the begin­ning of the movie industry itself. Thorn were ofl'erings from famous early direc­tors likn Cecil B. DeMille and D.W. (;riflith, and thesn early films defined the gnnrn with their lavish sets, enormous casts and intnnsn action scenns. 
Tlw threat of' tnlevision caused a n~surgnnco in the produetion of' these opul1mt dramas in the 1<)50s. Films like "Quo Vadis," "The Hobe," "Spartacus" and "Bon-llur" combined action and advnnture with stars like Kirk Douglas and Charlton lleston to lure audiences away from tho television and into the nwvin thnatm. 
These films were often so expensive and lavish that producing them was a huge gamble for studios that eould either result in huge returns or complete linaneial ruin. The 1959 version of "Ben­llur" was a huge hit, won 11 Oscars and saved MGM from the brink of bankrupt­cy. Twentieth Century Fox wasn't so lucky with their version of "Cleopatra" starring Elizabeth Taylor and Riehard Burton. The film eost $44 million dollars, equivalent to $273 million today, and noarly destroyed' the studio because it was a huge flop. 
In more reeent cinematic memory, "Gladiator" almost single-handedly revived the swords-and-sandals genre with its success. The film, starring Hussell Crowe, cost well ovor $100 mil­lion dollars, but achieved the lavish efTects of its predecessors using CGI efTeets instnad of having a cast of thou­sands and building huge sets. In 2001, the film won five Oscars, including Best Actor and Best Picture, whieh naturally led to a revivod interest in ancient histo­ry and a wave of movies that would try to imitate its success. 
One of the first major films to follow 
"Gladiator" was 2004's "Troy." The 
movie featured Brad Pitt as Achilles, 
Orlando Bloom as Paris and Erie Bana 
as llector. It was not well-received by 
eritics, who panned the actors and the 
script's attempt to adapt "The Iliad." Nor 
was it embraced by audiences. The lilm 
only spent six weeks in the top 10 and 
grossed far less domestically than it cost · to produce. 
The next film that attempted to repli­
eate the sueeess of "Gladiator" was 
Oliver Stone's "Alexander." The film had 
an all-star east that included Colin 
Ferrell as Alexander, Angelina Jolie as 
his mother Olympias, Anthony Hopkins 
as Ptolemy and Val Kilmer as Philip of 
Maeedonia. The lilm. like "Troy" failed 
to find critical praise or the massive box 
offieo suecess it noedod to recoup it 
budget. It spent only three weeks as one 
of the top 10 movies at the box of'l1ce, 
and it failed to soar higher than number 
six. "Alexander," like "Cleopatra" before 
it, was thought to have once again 
crushed the willingness of studios to 
take risks on lilms in the swords-and­
sandals genre. 

The latest incarnation of films that 
play on our culture's faseination with ancient history is IIBO's S!\ries, "Home." Its nearly $100 million dollar budget, large cast and dotailed sets reveal that it shares similarities with many of the films that came bnforo it. Tho looser pro­duction standards that IIBO rntains havn allowed the series to be much more graphic than many films that came before it. The fact that it is a series allows it to go into greater dotail than movies normally can in with their time constraints. 
Only time will tell if television will usurp einema as the place to debut swords-and-sandals epies, but if the long legacy of the genre rnveals anything, it's that the more things change, the more they stay the same. 
Hegardless of the medium tho appear in, these epics will feature large casts, plenty of action, opulent sets and a great deal of aetion. Ancient Grn1\k and Homan culturn died out thousands of years ago, but our fascination with tlwse cultures hasn't diminished much over tho cen­turins.

PIIILADEI.PIIIA -One team is trying to secure a division title and move closer to earn­ing the top seed in the confer­ence. The other is lighting to stay in the playoff race. 
The Philadelphia Eagles have been in this position often the last few years. Only this time, the roles are reversed and the Eagles are the desper­ate ones. 
The conference-leading Seattle Seahawks (9-2) can clinch their second consecutive NFC West title with a victory over Philadelphia (5-6) on Monday night. 
Meanwhile, the reigning NfC champions just want to keep alive their slim playoff hopes. Eight other teams have better records than the Eagles, and two more are equal. 
Does being a desperate team make Philadelphia a more dangerous opponent? 
"If you're desperate with playmakers, yeah. If you're desperate for making plays, yeah," Eagles safety Brian

Which team is Philadelphia? 

"We expect to win. We expect to win every game we

The Eagles snapped a four­game losing streak with a 19­14 victory over lowly Green Bay last week. Without injured quarterback Donovan McNabb and banished 
wide receiver Terrell Owens, the offense had 
trouble moving the ball. But running back Brian Westbrook had a career-high 120 yards rushing and the defensn stopped-Brett Favre in crucial spots. 
Seattle was helped by three missed field goals in its 24-21 overtime victory against the New York Giants. The Seahawks, off to their best start since opening 12-2 in

HOCKEY 


Irish look to right the ship 
Team carries four­
game winless streak 
into home-and-home 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Writer 
After enduring three losses and a tie in its last four games, the Notre Dame hockey team is looking to get back in the win column at least once in this weekend's home-and-home with Western Michigan. 
''I'm just hoping we can get back on track -last weekend was probably the worst hockey we've played all season," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said of last 
'--week's 4-1 and 5-2 losses to Ohio State at the Joyce Center, which left Notre Dame 3-8-1 on the season. The Irish lost to and tied Miami of Ohio the week before. Jackson said he is avoiding comparisons to last year's dis­astrous, season ending 22­game winless streak, which left the Irish psychologically fragile heading into this season. "If the players are letting it effect them, that;s their mis­take," he said. "But I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure we play well tomorrow night [and Saturday]." After averaging 3. 7 goals per game through their first nine contests, the Irish have scored just 5 in their last four outings. They have scored none without at least a man advantage. "We haven't scored a five on five goal in four games," .Jackson said. "We just have to 

FOOTBALL RECRUITING 

Committed recruits arrive for Banquet 
By KEVIN BRENNAN 
Sports Writer 
The 84th University of Notre Dame football banquet will take place at 7 p.m. tonight at the Joyce Center, but with less signifi­cance than usual -not that it's a bad thing. 
The football banquet normally marks one of the biggest recruit­ing weekends of the year, with several highly-rated, undecided prospects taking their official vis­its to Notre Dame. 
But since head coach Charlie Weis has already secured 22 known. verbal commitments for hi<> first full recruiting class, there will not be a single uncommitted recruit in attendance at the ban­quet. 
"In the past it's been the big weekend for Notre Dame to kind of shore up and land some top guys," Mike Frank of Irisheyes.com said of the ban­quet. "But [Weis] has kind of fast forwarded that process and he already has his top guys in the fold." 
With the maximum number of players allowed in one recruiting class set at 25 by the NCAA, Notre Dame has very few spot.<> remaining. But Frank said run­ning back James Aldridge and offensive lineman Chris Stewart, and possibly wide receiver/kick returner George West, will become the first-ever Irish recruits in the modern era to enroll early and begin school in January. 
Early entrants can be counted towards the previous year's 
recruiting cla'is, giving Weis room for five or six more commitments. Hecruits cannot olTicially sign letters of intent until February. 
Notre Dame will be hosting sev­eral committed players this week­end. Frank believes Aldridge, offensive lineman Eric Olsen, kieker Hyan Burkhart, quarter­back Demetrius Jones, tight end Paddy Mullen, running back Munir Prince, defensive ends John Hyan and Kallen Wade, wide receivers Hob Parris and Barry Gallup and fullback Luke Schmidt will attend today's ban­quet. 
Former Notre Dame head coach and current ESPN analyst Lou Holtz will be the lead speak­er. Frank said the banquet, while not as vital to recruiting as in years past, will still be important and meaningful to the team. 
"I think it<> just more going to be a celebration of a season that ha'i turned out pretty well," he said. Notes

After splitting time with freshman Jordan Pearce four assists in the last five games.

ND WOMEN'S SWIMMING 
Irish women lead after Invitational's first.day 
Notre Dame enters the meet's second day in first, scoring 555 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Spons Writer 

The women's swimming and diving team entered this weekend's Notre Dame Invitational brimming with confidence, and Thursday's n~sults justified that approach. 
Through the first day of the three-day event at Holfs Aquatic Center, the Irish are in first place with 555 points out of 11 teams. Notre Dame will have to hold off Utah for the next two days. The Utes are only 29 points behind the Irish. 
Notre Dame has shown remarkable improvement as this season has progressed. The team's times and overall performance has improved from week to week. Thursday was clear evidence of that improvement as the 
Irish achieved two career best times, one season best time and an NCAA 'B' cut time. 
The Irish dominated throughout the day, register­ing nine top-three finishes and not finishing worse than second place in any of Thursday's six events. 
Notre Dame the top three spots in the 500-freestyle on the first day. Freshman Casey Wagner took first place with a career-best time of 4:54.89. Classmate Claire Hutchinson (4:57.82) finished in second, followed by junior Ellen Johnson (4:57.97). 
The 500-freestyle was fol­lowed by the 200 individual medley, where Jessica Stephens took first place with an NCAA 'B' cut time of 
2:04.22. Junior Ann Barton finished in second place with a season-best time of 2:05.83. 
The night concluded with an impressive performance by sophomore diver Tara 1-lyer, who compiled a career­best 313.45 points. The score put her in a close second to 
Utah's Kelsey Patterson. 

Irish coach Carrie Nixon said Notre Dame's first day of an invitational typically has been its weakest, so the Irish performance on the second day will bn telling. 
In the Minnesota Invitational, which took place from Nov. 18-20, the Irish performed stronger on the second and third days of the meet. The Irish posted a win after that mnet. ~

finals, grab­bing more than 40 percent of the point-earning spots and tak­ing first place in three of the 
day's six events. Overall, the Irish ended the day with 878.5 points -well ahead of Utah's 474 and North Dakota's 317. 
"What you saw this morning, for one thing, was just another almost overwhelming example of how deep this team is," head coach Tim Welsh said. 
Strong individual perf'ormam~­es were a recurring theme dur­ing the day. Jay Vandenberg continued his winning streak in the 500-yard freestyle, posting a season-best time of 4:29.72. 
The Irish also had several swimmers post qualifying times for the Big East Championship.

Irish host year's first meet 

Belles prepared to play against North Park 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
After a 1-4 start for the Belles, coach Steve Bender hopes to use his team's con­stant intensity to turn the sea­son around, starting with North Park University. 
Saint Mary's has had little proof of the hard work they have put into training for bas­ketball, but despite their record has not lost their con­centration. 
"The one main high point of this team is their intensity," said Bender. "I can never fault them for that." 
But unfortunately for the Belles, hard work alone does not win basketball games. The Belles have struggled this year on offense. Their leading scorer, Allison Kessler, aver­ages 12.8 points a game, but also shoots a mere 42 percent from the floor. In fact, the team as a whole has a 34 per­cent field goal percentage, far too low for any team with a 
-·chance of winning big games. 
"We've had to get back to the fundamentals at prac­tice," Bender said. "We need to work on the little things before we can improve." 
After playing Hope on Wednesday, Bender has been concerned with the lack of a strong presence in the paint. 
~The Belles will alternate between a three guard lineup and the traditional two guards, two forwards, and a center formation. which already eliminates an inside presence for Saint Mary's. Also, center/forward Nicole Beier averages only three rebounds a game, while point guard Bridget Lipke leads the team with thirty rebounds in the five games this year. "We have been working at practice to build up our confi­dence when we have the ball," Bender said when asked about his team's struggling offense. "We need to be 
stronger offensively to take the ball to the basket." 
The Belles also need to improve their turnover mar­gin. In their first five games, the Belles forced 76 opponent turnovers while committing a whopping 97 of their own. This ratio needs to improve if the Belles want to win against a heatable North Park team. 
On a positive note, Coach Bender has been impressed with Lipke, who has emerged as a team leader. Lipke, the starting point guard, has played with a passion for the game that has led her to be the highest rebounder and second highest scorer on the team. 
"Bridget has definitely been the leader so far this year," said Bender. "I hope that her love of the game is conta­gious."

DePaul, Butler come to Blue and Gold meet 
By JASON GALVAN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame track and field teams look to begin their season on the right foot at this weekend's Blue and Gold Invitational. The event, which will feature the Notre Dame team and other athletes from DePaul and Butler, will take place at 5 p.m. this Friday at Loftus Sports Center. 
Though this meet has a rela­tively small number of partici­pants from other schools, each of the teams will look to use this event as a starting point from which to gauge their progress during their off-season training. 
"We started this meet years ago as an inter-squad meet, but the last couple of years we've invited a couple other schools," Assistant coach John Millar said. "It gives the athletes who have been training a chance to see where they're at and even as a motivator." 
With a long season ahead and the next meet over a month away, the team will get the opportunity to put their training to use in a more competitive atmosphere. Many of the dis­tance runners have been able to compete with the cross-coun­try team this fall. For athletes in other events such as sprint­ing, hurdles and high jump, this event will be tbe first opportu­nity to sufficiently put their abilities to the test. 
"The sprinters, jumpers and throwers work diligently from the first of September on and they can use this event as a benchmark for their condition­ing," coach Joe Piane said. "It'll be a good start and a great opportunity for them since they haven't had the opportunity to do much over the summer." 
In addition to finally putting their skills to the test after these months of off-season training, each of the athletes will also have the opportunity of to qualify for the Big East meet. 


"For the sprinters, throwers, runners and all those not in cross country, it's a great opportunity to see where they are fitness-wise and get the qualifying out of the way," sen­ior distance runner Stephanie Madia said. "Everyone's excited and we have a lot of people that are ready to run at Big East Standards." 
The Irish track team has a returning core of talented ath­letes who qualified for the NCAA championships last year and several others who are expected to make a strong showing this year and who may qualify for the Big East meet this Friday. 
"For the men, Ryan Postel, Austin Wechter, Charlie Hilding and Zack Labrecque are people I would expect that should not only make it, but do good for the rest of the season," Millar said. "I also expect athletes on the women's team such as Maryann Erigha, Okechi Ogbukiri, Crysta Swayzer and Brienne Davis to qualify and perform at a pretty high level." 
However, veterans and proven stars should not be the only ones contributing this sea­son. 
"''m also always looking for a few surprises and other people to step up," she said. "Zach Labrecque, moving from the 200 to the 400, is someone who could really do well." 
The Invitational is something that the team can look forward to with some excitement com­ing out of the off-season. Each of the athletes have been preparing to perform at a high level this season and the first meet will, along with an evalua­tion of performance, prove to be a fun and exhilarating expe­rience. 
"Meets are something they gear towards," Millar said. The chance to compete is something to look forward to and I think they're excited about finally getting the opportunity."

Kwiatt, a senior who has been

raising money for the missions. 
"We're having 17 exhibition

even as tlw cause has remained

"It's just great sneing people grow and change as boxers over the ynars," she said. "Especially novices, watching them as they first eomn into boxing and don't know anything about it. Then they step into the ring, and they know how to throw punches, and they know how to defend themselves and they know l!Jch­nique. It's just great watching the girls year-by-y11ar." 
The lighl'i have a maximum of

Of the 17 bouts on Sunday's card, Kwiatt said she is particu­larly excited for the final light, between junior Kelsey Miller and senior Jessica Fickey. 
"Jess Fkkey is one of the most skilled hoxers in the club," Kwiatt said. ''I'm looking for­ward to her light. ... It will be one of the many featured lights."

Francis is 12-of-21 from the field this season, averaging 10.7 points and 10.7 rebounds per game.

The relentless Flyers came back, making the Irish work hard for nearly every point. But Notre Dame was able to handle the pressure.

Croal, a freshman who shares time with fellow outside hitter/sophomore Ellen Heintzman, sparked the Irish. She pounded 18 kills and had five blocks. 
Stasiuk played a well-round­ed match. She added 16 kills, 
and Amaker are friendly off the 
court. He even went as far as 
saying that getting ready for 
Saturday's game was unusual 
because of his relationship with 
Michigan's coach. 
''I'm probably more uncomfort­able with this preparation because Tommy is a good friend," Brey said. "We've been in thi'i business a long time. 
Brey and Amaker were once assistant coaches together at Duke under Blue Devils head coaeh Mike Krzyzewski. 
"Certainly Notre Dame­Michigan is more important than Amaker-Brey. It's a match up that fan bases get excited about both in Ann Arbor and South Bend." 
The Irish lost a 61-60 heart­breaker last year to the Wolverines in Ann Arbor. In that game, No. 20 Notre Dame led 60­58 when Horton completed a 3­point play with 20.7 seeonds left to give Michigan the win. 
Former point guard Chris Thoma'i had two opportunities to win the game on the ensuing possession, but missed two con­secutive field goals as time expired. 
"Any time Michigan and Notre Dame have been matched up, there always seems to be a little more of a bu:t.z," Brey said. "If'it's soccer, if it's volleyball, women's basketball, hockey. I just feel a lit­tin more juice around that. 
"There's some excitement from both fans bases when both these great institutions play."

two straight road games against the Midwest confer­ence. Notre Dame faces Purdue on Wednesday, as well. 
The Irish come off a 7 4-55 win against lona at the Joyce Center on Tuesday, a game they won without head coach Muffet McGraw. McGraw stayed home with an illness, and associate head coach Coquese Washington led the team in her place. Washington is a 1992 graduate of Notre Dame, where she played bas­ketball as well, and has been an assistant coach since 1999. 
Washington said Thursday afternoon that she was unsure if McGraw would be healthy enough to coach the Irish for Sunday's game, and that it would be a "day-to-day" situa­tion. 
But Washington acknowl­edged the Badgers would be a tough opponent, playing in the Big Ten. 
"The Big Ten and the Big East are both quality confer­ences," Washington said. "Anytime you play a Big Tlm team, you know you're going to have a competitive game." 
In 2003, the last time these two teams met, the Irish came out on top at the Joyce Center 82-64, behind 25 points from Megan Duffy and 22 points from Courtney LaVere. 
The two players are now the co-captains of this year's Irish squad, both as seniors. 
Meanwhile, the Badgers are led by sophomore guard Jolene Anderson, who won gold this summer, like Duffy, playing for a United States team. Anderson played for the U-19 World Championship Team, while Duffy won gold with the World University Games Team. 
Last weekend, Anderson, who is averaging 16.4 points, 
5.4 rebounds, 4 assists and 2.2 steals per game, and fnllow guard .Ianese Banks were named all-tournamnnt at the Hainbow Wahini Classic in Honolulu, Hawaii, where the Badgnrs rnachnd the champi­onship final. There they lost to Big East member No. 17 DePaul, 76-57. 
And the Badgers have a quick turnaround before the Irish come to town. Tonight they face another Big East team, Marquette, at the Kohl Center before facing Notre Dame on Sunday. 
Washington said she expeets to face a tough Wisconsin team at a place that draws well for women's basketball. And as a result, she wants Notre Damn to have a better first half than it did against lona, when tlw Irish led just 36-28 against the Gaels. 
"We want to open up a little stronger than we did against lona," Washington said. "Playing on thn road is tough. They'vn got a great anma and pretty good fan support. But I'm hoping we can come out with a lot of energy and get on the boards." 
Tipotr is set for 1 :30 p.m. on Sunday in Madison, Wise .

into the Jan. 2 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz. 
The Bowl Championship Series (BCS) selection committee -comprised of all11 Division I­A conference commissioners and Notre Dame commission­er/athletic director Kevin White -will announce its pairings for the Rose, Fiesta, Orange and Sugar bowls in a conference call on Sunday at 6 p.m. 
But the BCS matchups cannot be finalized until teams com­plete their schedules on Saturday. 
When the selection committee slots teams for the BCS bowls on Sunday, the committee first will assign conference champions to the bowls with an affiliation to their respective conferences ­these are referred to as "host teams" for the bowl games. 
So, under the current BCS arrangement, the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) champion ­the winner of the Virginia Tech­Florida State game (8 p.m., ABC) -will automatically host the FedEx Orange Bowl in Miami, Fla. 
The Southeastern Conference champion -the winner of the LSU-Georgia game (6 p.m., CBS) -will receive an automatic bid to the Nokia Sugar Bowl in Atlanta, Ga. 
And normally, the Big 12 champion would host the Fiesta Bowl. But if Texas wins Saturday, the Longhorns go to the national championship game and leave the Fiesta without a host team. 
"We then go into the process of replacing the host teams that sioner Kevin Weiberg in a tele­conference Wednesday. 
This means that with four BCS bowl slots remaining -two taken by the Rose Bowl and three by conference champions -the Fiesta Bowl would receive first pick among the remaining bowls, even though the pre­arranged pecking order is Orange, Fiesta then Sugar. 
Three Fiesta Bowl representa­tives were present at the Notre Dame-Stanford game on Saturday, and the Fiesta has made no secret that the Irish are a prime candidate for an early BCS selection. 
But Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis said he will not be rooting for any team Saturday despite the Fiesta hype. 
"I only cheer for us;" Weis said in a teleconference Thursday, "because I don't think it's really good to be cheering against anyone or for somebody. I feel pretty good about our chances of getting a bid to the BCS, and we'll just let it play out. Whatever it is, it is." 
Decisions, decisions 
Texas beat Colorado soundly, 42-17, on Oct. 15, but a Longhorn victory on Saturday is not guaranteed. If Texas loses, the Orange Bowl gets the first pick as prearranged. 
But whichever bowl picks first will have the option of taking Notre Dame, Penn State, Ohio State, Oregon, Auburn or West Virginia with its first selection ­or, as Weiberg said, "any avail­able team that is eligible." · 
The category of "eligible" teams includes conference champions not automatically 
met the BCS' criteria of nine wins and a top 12 final BCS rank (also includes Miami and UCLA, at present). Only two at­large teams will be selected for BCS bowls since Penn State (Big 10 champion) and West Virginia (Big East champion) are guaran­teed berths. 
To select, each BCS bowl gives the committee a list of prefer­ences that must include any conference champion with auto­matic qualification that hasn't been slotted. If there are no con­flicts, the teams are slotted to their respective bowls accord­ingly. 
If there are conflicts, the pre­arranged order of Orange, Fiesta, Sugar goes into effect. But a Texas win also would give the Fiesta first pick, as well, rearranging the order to Fiesta, Orange, Fiesta, Sugar. 
Notre Dame did its part Saturday in a 38-31 win at Stanford. The Irish (9-2) earned their ninth win and finished at No. 8, pending Saturday's games, in the BCS standings. 
"There's no other team that I think should represent their own school and college football in general than this team right here," Notre Dame wide receiv­er Jeff Samardzija said after the win at Stanford. 
Critics have been debating that point for weeks. 
Why Notre Dame? 
Penn State (10-1; No. 3 BCS) and Ohio State (9-2; No. 6 BCS), considered at-large teams in years when the Rose Bowl hosts the national championship game, have similar or better records than the Irish. The the road to Michigan (No. 19). 

Ohio State's only losses were to Penn State and Texas, two top-three BCS opponents, and the Buckeyes are ranked higher than No. 8 Notre Dame in the BCS standings. So is Oregon (1 0­1), ranked No. 7 in the BCS. 
But Weiberg said teams with better records sometimes fall beneath others simply in accor­dance with the BCS system and selection process. 
"I understand that there's still intense competition for those positions and that teams with very good records don't always get selected," he said. ''I've had them from my own conference [the Big 12] over the years, but I think it's really part and parcel of the bowl process. And I think the BCS has been of assistance in bringing some order to that selection process." 
Bowls evaluate a team's per­formance when they make their selections, but the committees also take into account a team's marketability, specifically to its local fan base, to sell tickets. 
The Fiesta Bowl is certainly not looking for a repeat of last year's 35-7 rout of Utah against Pittsburgh. And even if the bowl selections do not turn out to suit everyone's needs, Weiberg pointed out that there is a review process. 
"At that point there is a review of the pairings to see if there is a need to make an adjustment in the pairings," Weiberg said. "Normally that is not the case. But we do have a procedure where we allow ABC television, our current television partner, to also commet on the pairings and bring forward any pen." 
Quite simply, regardless of whether or not conferences cry foul at the notion that Notre Dame could be selected above teams ranked higher in the BCS, the Irish are qualified under the current BCS arrangement, and bowls have the ultimate say concerning teams' destinations. 
What about USC? 
USC is the Pac-1 0 champion, though it still has to play UCLA on Saturday (4:30 p.m., ABC). With a win, Southern California advances to the national cham­pionship. With a loss, the Trojans could fall out and leave room for Penn State to slide into the Rose Bowl. 
Unlike the Big 10-which lost affiliation to a specific bowl this season -the Pac-10 champion is slated to appear in the Fiesta Bowl this year, unless that team goes to the national champi­onship game. 
A USC loss, then, forces the Trojans into the Fiesta Bowl. But as long as Texas wins, Notre Dame still has a chance at play­ing in Tempe, because Texas is the host team. A USC Rose Bowl bid does not affect the Fiesta Bowl's selection order. It only opens a slot for a conference champion or at-large team to slide in. 
Will it be Notre Dame? 

"I know who has all the picks," Notre Dame football coach Charlie Weis said in a Thursday press conference. "I just don't know who's picking us."

Wo:m_en's .fights will start today 
Boxing tournament raises money to help East African missions 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 
They won't be pulling any punches Sunday. 
After nearly three months of training up to six days a week, the fighters of the Notre Dame Women's Boxing Club will don their trunks and robes in the second annual Baraka 'Bouts to raise money for Holy Cross edu­cation missions in East Africa. 
"We began our novice training the first full week of classes," club co-president Anne Kwiatt said. "In those two weeks, all the new boxers were able to begin their training and learn the fun­damentals of boxing." 
Kwiatt and fellow co-president Courtney Cleary have led the club's 34 boxers all semester with daily two-hour workouts Monday through Friday and Saturday afternoon, training in preparation for Sunday's 1 p.m. bouts. 
"To get in shape for the box­ing, it takes a lot of cardio-aero­bic work," Kwiatt said. "Pretty much since the first week of school we've been training." 
Boxers must attend at least four practices a week to remain eligible to fight, Cleary said. 
"The girls are looking good; we're really proud of what they've done," Cleary said.
