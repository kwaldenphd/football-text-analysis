Students ejected for throwing tnarshtnallo-ws 
Ushers say 30 to 40 students ejected, 2 people injured 
By CLAIRE HEININGER 
N~ws Writer 
As the final seconds before halftime ticked off the game clock and Notre Dame seniors braced for their traditional season-capping, section-wide marshmallow fight, Stadium ushers prepared for a battle of their own -one that resulted in between 30 and 40 student njections from their last home football game. 
Lining up one man to every few aisles, the ushers made an imposing front, senior Steve Carroll said. "They entered like the Gestapo," he said. "At lirst, I honeslly thought that they wnrn going to let !the fight! happen, that they were just there to keep it from getting out of hand." 
Carroll was mistaken, as he and several other students involvHd in the light had their ticket booklets conliscated and were ejected from the game. NDSP officnrs then escorted some students to the security olliee to issue citations. 
Coordinator of stadium per­sonnel Cappy Gagnon said the incrHased usher presence was intended to deter the tight. 
"We hoped seeing the ushers would discourage it," he said. "The mentality was 'If we all do it, we're all innocent -of course that's not true." 
Tommy Gaeta, a senior who rHeeived a citation for allegedly hitting an ollicer with a marsh­mallow a few minutes before halftime began, said he felt he had bmm targeted unfairly for having a seat on an aisle.

Saint Mary's students part of BYU pregame 
By NICOLE ZOOK News Writer 
Saint Mary's students were not lost in the excitement of Saturday's big game between Notre Dame and Brigham Young University. 
Saint Mary's was acknowl­edged both before the game and during halftime, as students pre­sented the American flag, partic­ipated in the color guard and were recognized when the band played "The Belles of Saint Mary's" during the halftime show. 
Student body president Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl and vice-president Sarah Brown pre­sented the flag before the game. They received special passes to be on the field for a run-through and the pre-game activities, Jablonski-Diehl said. 
"It was really exciting," she said. "Thio:; is the first time Saint Mary's has been given the oppor­tunity to present the flag." 
Notre Dame class offieers and the student body president and vice president presented the flag at other games during the sea­son. 

"We thought, 'Why can't the last game be done by the Saint Mary's student government?"' Brown said. "We made a few calls last spring about getting it set up, and [our request was) very well received. The people who organize the games were very hospitable." 
Jablonski-Diehl and Brown walked to the 50-yard line with student board officers from Notre Dame. They were present­ed the flag by junior class om-

Sayers announces scholarship 
By JOE TROMBELLO News Writer 
In her acceptance speech for the Charles E. Sheedy Award for Excellence in Teaching, professor of English Valerie Sayers announced plans for the creation of a faculty and staff scholarship fund that will provide monetary support to minority and first-generation undergraduates to improve the diversity of the Notre Dame student body. 
"I was just waiting for a moment when it would seem like a positive thing -not like a sacrifiee -but as something that we on the faculty could do to strengthen the sense of our­selves as part of a eommuni­ty," she said. 

Speaking Friday afternoon I to faculty, staff and students, Sayers illustrated the impor­I tance of students in helping to create great teachers. She noted that although Notre Dame has taken strides to improve diversity, adding a greater number of minority and first-generation college students would only improve the quality of undergraduate education. 
"[The acceptance speech) seemed like it would be a niee moment when I could suggest that students are a huge part of teaching. It's not as if the teaching award should [only) go to a teaeher. It's the stu­dents we teach that make good teaching possible," Sayers said.

All or nothing 

Gender relations. It's a phrase that I doubt many of my sorority-and-frater­nity pledging or seven-floor, co-ed dorm residing state school friends even stock in their vocabularies, much less spend countless dining hall conver­sations and Core discussions debat­ing. We all know Notre Dame strives to be an exception­al place -hence the upbeat blue and gold recruiting brochures splashed with the pretentiously con­vincing "Nowhere Else But Notre Dame" slogan-but when it comes to gender relations, it is clearly more harmful than it is bragworthy to be unique. 
Notre Dame is one of the few cam­puses that still subscribe to the "meet the special someone you're going to marry" mindset of our parents' genera­tion. True, the much-scorned goal of earning the famous "Mrs." Degree is not nearly as pervasive as it is at some other schools, and the academic, career-driven focus of both males and females here is outstanding. However, the fact remains in the back of our minds that these years of our lives are widely expected to produce a partner with the potential for serious, long­term romance -a pressure-packed and extremely scary thought that can make the omnipresent chiming of the Basilica wedding bells feel more mock­ing than joyous. 
The bells represent one extreme of gender relations at ND: the dreamy­first-walk-around-the-lakes, candlelit­proposal-in-the-Grotto fairy tale. Freshmen approaching their first "choose a shoe" dance at Frosh-0 are told that maybe, just maybe, the boy or girl of their dreams is just a New Balance shoelace away. Three weeks (and I'm being generous here) of disap­pointing parietals-shortened parties and gender-segregated SOH tables later, they find themselves hitting the other extreme, and hitting it hard. 
The easy scapegoat of the University's Catholic priorities and anti­quated policies, while certainly playing a role, is only partly to blame for Notre Dame's skewed gender environment. After witnessing almost three semes­ters' worth of my friends' and my own disappointing relationships, random hookups, few and far between purely platonic friendships and painful mis­takes, I've realized that it's not that simple. Chalking Notre Dame's pitiful gender relations up to parietals and single sex dorms, while tempting, would be wishful thinking. The real issue is our expectations-in a com­munity populated with perfectionists and strivers, our relationships are just another area of our lives in which the reality is never quite good enough. For those of you who have found the "all," congratulations and enjoy those bells. For the jaded rest of us, life goes on, and we keep hoping that -like so many other aspects of the world -the potential for love doesn't end at the edge of the Notre Dame bubble.

St. Ed's nets $2,500 in basketball shootout 
By SHEilA FLYNN 
News Writer 
St. Edward's Hall has collected over $2,500 from its Nov. 6 shootout fundraiser, and campus dormitories continue to donate money, assistant rector and event organizer Eric Nedell said. 
"More dorms are going to be sending money over, so we should probably come in right under $3,000," Nedell said. 
The Shootout was Nedell's brainchild; he conceived the event last year after being informed of his appointment to assistant rec­tor of St. Edward's Hall. 
"I just thought about something that would bring all of the dorms together for an event like this, and I know that all the guys -in St. Ed's, especially -are big bas­ketball fans," Nedell said. "So it was a good opportunity to do something good." 
For the fundraiser, St. Ed's invit­ed other dormitories and campus institutions to send a shooter for 25 free throw shots to the basket­ball courts behind the dorm. Eighteen shooters participated this year, including director of Residence Life and Housing Jeff Shoup, representing the Main Building. Competitors raise money on their own, and their final scores in the contest are derived by multiplying the amount of funds raised by the percentage of free throw shots made. St. Ed's won its own event this year, and all collected money will be donated to the hall's desig­nated charity, South Bend's Camp Milhouse. 
"It's a camp for physically and mentally handicapped children," Nedell said.

questions. [Candidates] didn't have to go over things that were already covered in their CV." 
According to students, all candi­dates willingly answered ques­tions presented at the luncheons, granting the opportunity to learn more about their character, back­ground and future goals should they be named to the position. 
"Overall, I liked that all four candidates were unique," Bailey said. "Each one had their own perspectives and came from diverse backgrounds." 
Senior Shannon Maloney found specific attributes she liked about each candidate. 
Maloney said she admired Josefina Baltodano's fundraising ideas and economic background. She liked Gail Baker's approach to diversity and her sensitivity to various issues around campus. Maloney noted Susan Keys' sin­cerity of student concerns and her interest in gaining student opin­ion. However, Carol Mooney is the candidate Maloney said she iden­tified with most. 
"I think [Mooney] had the strongest understanding of our mission," she said. "She under­stands the past [and] present and envisions a lot going on in the future." 
Both Bailey and Maloney attended all four student-candi­date luncheons and applaud the search committee for their choice of candidates. They agreed that each had strengths in individual areas and understood the values of a Catholic women's college to maintain in the future. 
He said the Hall Council voted for Camp Milhouse as its charity because the funds raised "would be more important for a smaller charity than a drop in the bucket for the Red Cross, or something like that." 
And St. Edward's raised the most money for its own event, col­lecting $1,500 just from hall resi­dents. Rector Father Tom Eckert gave the hall an additional motive for giving money; while organiz­ers were counting money Wednesday at 9 p.m., they real­ized the hall had already raised $1,200. At that time, Eckert said that if residents could raise that sum to $1,500 by midnight, he would dye his hair blond, along with Nedell and third floor resi­dent assistant Brent Griffith. 
The residents complied, collect­ing $300 in three hours. 
"I gave the last three dollars to my name," said junior Mike Giampa, who also acted as the St. Ed's shooter. 
Resident assistant Mark Bellantoni also gave donations, spurred on by the rector's pledge. 
"I gave money because I want­ed to help the kids, but partly because I could see my rector with blond hair, which is awe­some," Bellantoni said. 
And when the money came in and the clock hit midnight, the now blond hall staff trio held true to their promise. And it was worth it, Father Eckert said, although he admitted his determination in reaching the goal wavered. 
"For the kids, I hoped so," he said. "For the charity, I hoped so. But for my hair, I had mixed feel­ings."

''These women didn't seem like they took traditional steps to come to this point," Maloney said. "They all had their own paths and made their own way to get here. I think they're all very willing and ready to accept what happens." 
After each candidate's visit, stu­dents were encouraged to com­plete feedback forms, also avail­able to the on-campus community at the Presidential Search web­site. The form asked students to rank each candidate in certain areas on a scale from one to four, in addition to allowing space for general comments. 
"Basically the form asked ques­tions about how individuals felt the candidate was effective in dif­ferent areas," said Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl, student repre­sentative on the search committee and student body president. "The questions described the skills that a president would need." 
The feedback forms will be organized by Korn Ferry International, the firm hired by Saint Mary's to aid in the presi­dential search, before results are delivered to the search committee for evaluation. 
Overall, Saint Mary's students said they feel honored to be involved and realize that an open process is unlikely to occur at other institutions. 
"I was just excited that we had the opportunity to take part in this process, and I hope it continues that we have further student involvement in other areas," Maloney said. ''I'm excited for all four women and confident that the search committee will make the best decision."

focus," she said. "That's just another element of diversity and I think the college campus is happy it worked out that way, but all of the candidates embody qualities aside from that." 
According to Jablonski-Diehl, the fact that all four candidates are women is also not some­thing the committee specifical­ly intended. 
"We definitely weren't look­ing for [all women]. but it's almost self-selective," she said. "The one thing I noticed talk­ing to students was that they'd like to have someone who could be a role model to them." 
Jablonski-Diehl said the search committee met several times before narrowing down a larger pool of applicants to the current candidates. 
"We had a wide range of can­didates that were diverse in all aspects," she said. "We were really happy and the campus seemed to be really happy with the group that came." 

The decision to bring candi­dates to campus provided them a chance to become acquainted with the College, however some had previously visited on their own, Jablonski-Diehl said. 
Included in each presidential candidate's visit was the Heritage Presentation, a cam­pus tour, a tour of South Bend, a student-candidate luncheon, dinner, an open meeting with faculty and staff and meetings with the Congregation Leadership Team, Sister Joan Marie Steadman, chair of the Board of Trustees, administra­tors, hourly staff and the Administrative Council.

"It's a big honor," Brown said. "I think it shows that Saint Mary's students are a part of the Notre Dame farriily and the foot­ball family. It gives the student section a chance to participate and be acknowledged on the field." 
As a senior, Jablonski-Diehl also appreciated the recognition of Saint Mary's at the last home game.

Sex offenders rarely rearrested 
WASIIINGTON -Sex offenders are less

The Justice Department study of 9,691 men convicted of rape, sexual assault and child molestation who were released in 1994 found 43 percent were arrested for any type of crime within three years, com­pared with 68 percent for all other former inmates. 
Hyan King, researcher at The Sentencing Project, suggested the differ­ence may be because the most serious rapists. sexual assaulters and child moles­ters do not get released in the first place and arc unable to commit more crimes.

U.S. soldiers to remain in Iraq 
Iraqi sovereignty plan does not mean immediate troop withdrawal, Rumsfeld says 
Associated Press 
KADENA AIR BASE, Japan -The new acceler­ated plan for restoring self­rule in Iraq does not mean 
U.S. troops will withdraw anytime soon, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Sunday. 
In an interview en route to a U.S. Air Force base in southern Japan, Rumsfeld was asked about the plan to restore Iraq's sovereignty by June. 
"The time table or the way ahead that the [Iraqi] Governing Council has been describing relates to the governance aspects of the country and not to the secu­rity aspects.'' he said. "That's on a separate track." 
Rumsfeld said the United States continues to plan to rotate a new contingent of troops into Iraq next year, with no final pullout date set yet. Accelerating the political process will not affect military planning, he said. 
"This has nothing to do with U.S. troops and coali­tion troops in Iraq," he said.

Schwarzenegger to be inaugurated 
Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -In stark contrast to his Hollywood image and the usual inauguration festivities, Gov.-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger planned to take office Monday with a quick. low-key ceremony and then get to work. 
Mindful of the bitterness that still surrounds California's first guberna­torial recall election, not to mention the state's fiscal troubles, the Republican has shied away from black-tie celebrations that normally enliven the beginning of new admin­istrations. 
Schwarzenegger was expected to deliver a brief speech, attend three ceremonial receptions and return to the Capitol by mid-afternoon for his first hours of work as governor. 

He was expected to call a special session of the Legislature to consider issues including imposing midyear spending cuts to help reduce next year's expected $10 billion deficit, reforming the state's workers' com­pensation system, and repealing a new law that will allow undocument­ed immigrants to get driver's licens­es. 
He also has promised a balanced budget that does not include any new taxes or any significant cuts in fund­ing for education and local govern­ments. 
That goal became more daunting during the weekend with a projection from his chief financial deputy that the state budget deficit stands at $25 billion -far more than other recent estimates. 
But while the actor-turned-politi­cian promised to focus on state busi­ness, Sacramento braced for a frenzy. 
Requests for press credentials for Schwarzenegger's swearing-in cere­mony were filed by TV crews and print journalists from around the globe. Nearly 650 journalists planned to cover the event. 
"Sacramento has never seen any­thing like this before -it is astonish­ing," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. a political scientist at the University of Southern California. "There has never been this kind of intense media attention on the governor at anytime in the state."

She said that donations from faculty and staff will come as monthly payroll deductions from those who choose to contribute. The Office of Financial Aid will use the funds as they see necessary to provide greater monetary support -through grants ­for underrepresented stu­dents. 
Sayers also said that sup­port has come from many sources -including conver­sations with Mark Roche, Dean of the College of Arts and Letters, as well as Daniel Saracino, director of Admissions, and Joe Russo, director of finical aid. Sayers said that Notre Dame's com­mitment to improving diversi­ty, particularly through public affirmations by its adminis­trators, has proven especially positive to her. 

"This summer I read a piece in the Chicago Sun Times by our director of admissions Dan Saracino. It was a beautiful defense of affirmative action, and I thought it was so great that someone from Notre Dame was out there, out front, talk­ing about it," she said. 
Sayers contributed her cash prize as part of the Sheedy Award towards the scholar­ship fund. She said that although the funding may ini­tially be small, she hopes that faculty and staff contributions will create a much larger reservoir of funds, one that may possibly be used as an endowment. 
"It may be a small pool in the beginning, but my dream is that eventually it will be substantial."

Hillary steals Iowa spotlight 
Associated Press 
DES MOINES, Iowa ­Hillary Clinton sells her book and draws a crowd of more than 900 people. Three Democrats who want to be president speak at a syna­gogue before about 200. 
The New York senator made clear she isn't running for the White House in 2004 but, as a weekend of political events in Iowa showed, she can steal the thunder from the current crop of candidates who want to take on President Bush. 
"It's wonderful to see all of the friendly people out here," Clinton said Sunday as she autographed copies of her book. "''m here today to talk about books." 
Waiting in line, Carole Curtis called Clinton "a great role model and a strong woman" who would have her vote either in this election cycle or the next. That sentiment was echoed by Dan Pietzman, who said Clinton was "a great lady." 

Across town, John Kerry, Howard Dean and Dennis Kucinich appeared before a much smaller and more restrained crowd at the syna­gogue. 
Clinton moderated a major fund-raising dinner Saturday night featuring six of the con­tenders. 
The event sold out within three days of the announce­ment that she would appear, and party officials said the 7,500 who showed up was the biggest turnout in the history of the annual Jefferson Jackson Day dinner. 
It brought in more than $300,000 for the state party. Outside the basketball arena, supporters chanted and waved signs demanding that the first former lady run now because they see her as hav­ing the best chance to beat Bush. 
"Senator Clinton's ability to outshine and overshadow the Democrats running for presi­dent in Iowa's caucuses is fur­ther evidence of the weakness of the Democratic field," said Republican National Committee spokesman David James. 
At the fund-raiser, Clinton said the Democrats in the race were "the most accomplished, in terms of public service, that we've had since 1960. One of them will be successful." 
The candidates worked overtime seeking attention from thousands of activists and hundreds of journalists. 
Dean, the former Vermont governor, packed his backers in dozens of buses in a line so long he had to get a parade permit. Missouri Rep. Dick Gephardt held a rally with union activists before march­ing through the streets to the dinner.

EU asks Bush to remove duties 
GENEVA -America's allies appealed to President Bush on Tuesday to back ofT support for the U.S. steel industry or risk billions of dol­lars in sanctions that could spark a global trade war. 
Members of the European Union are threat­ening to impose retaliatory sanctions on $2.2 billion worth of U.S. imports unless Bush removes duties on imported steel he introduced in March 2002 to give breathing space to the embattled U.S. steel industry. 
"As frank and loyal friends of the United States, we hope that Washington will remove as soon as possible the steel tariffs that are consid­ered illegal by the World Trade Organization," said Adolfo Urso, Italy's Industry Ministry undersecretary in charge of foreign trade. 
"We want to ward ofT a commercial war that, in terms of its size, would be unprecedented." 
To ensure the sanctions hurt as much as pos­sible. the EU action targets products from key states, including Florida oranges, cigarettes and apples. 
Bill protects against outages 
WASHINGTON -Responding to the sum­mer's massive power blackout, Congress is considering in its broad energy bill the first federal rules, with penalties, to protect elec­tricity transmission systems from rapidly cas­cading outages. 
The Hepublican blueprint for an overhaul of 
U.S. energy priorities also would direct the government to order construction of critical power lines if states do not act. In addition, companies could charge more for moving power to spur investment in new lines. 
Some experts have questioned whether the electricity proposals in the energy legislation are enough to protect against a repeat of the rapidly moving blackout that blackened parts of eight states, from New York City to Michigan, in a matter of minutes in August. 
On Tuesday, a U.S.-Canadian task force is schedulnd to make public an interim report on the blackout's causes. Documents already released suggests that communications fail­ures, equipment problems and shortcomings in electricity grid management probably played a role.

Miami prepares for trade talks 
20,000 activists expected to protest Free Trade Area of the Americas in Miami 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -At most free trade meetings, protesters on the streets are the most vocal opponents to global economic expansion. But recently, Brazil and other developing nations have been equally resistant to proposed U.S. policies to ease trade restrictions. 
Those disputes will center in Miami at talks beginning Sunday to create the world's largest free trade area. As the 34 nations involved in the Free Trade Area of the Americas talks try to resolve their differences in hotel meeting rooms, police are prepared for at least 20,000 protesters to swarm the city. 
Law enforcement agen­cies have spent months training to· avoid a repeat of the infamous 1999 World Trade Organization talks in Seattle. Those meetings ended with little accom­plished after being derailed by disputes among member nations and five days of riots that cost the city about $3 million.

New energy bill to aid indus tries 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Energy industries that have invested millions of dollars in lawmakers' campaigns would reap billions in tax breaks and potential new business from compromise Republican legislation. 
President Bush took office promising to develop a new energy policy. Since then, energy-related businesses have contributed nearly $70 million to law­makers and political parties, with about three-fourths of it going to Republicans, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission records by the Center for Responsive Politics. 
The energy sector also gave an addi­tional $67 million -$50 million of it to Republicans -during the 2000 election cycle, when Bush won the presidency and Republicans regained control of the Senate. 

The House and Senate are expected to vote this week on the final compro­mise developed by GOP negotiators. The measure is designed to boost energy production, improve reliability of the electricity grids and make it eas­ier for energy companies to develop oil and gas on federal land. 
Energy interests have been "giving heavily to the Republicans for a long time, and this is what it's all about in the end. It looks like they got an ener­gy bill that they wanted," said Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a bipartisan research group. 
Environmental groups, which lob­bied unsuccessfully for measures to cut energy use or promote cleaner renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, made only $2.3 million in political contributions dur­ing the past three years. 
One of the biggest political contribu­tors over the years has been Illinois­based Archer Daniels Midland, the largest producer of corn-based ethanol. The company was one of the biggest winners in the energy agree­ment, which doubles the use of ethanol as a gasoline additive to 5 bil­lion gallons a year. 
Since 1999, ADM has given $2.4 mil­lion in unregulated donations to politi­cal parties, $1.5 million to Republicans and $874,000 to Democrats. Such soft money donations were outlawed by the campaign finance law that took effect last year.

Blanco defeats Jindal for LA. governor 
Associated Press 
LAFAYETTE, Newly elected governor Kathleen Blanco, the first woman to hold the job in Louisiana, on Sunday started piecing 
together a  new administra­ 
tion.  
Blanco,  the  state's  

Democratic lieutenant gover­nor, defeated conservative Indian-American Bobby Jindal with 52 percent of the vote in a runoff election Saturday that dashed the Republican Party's hopes for 
a sweep of the Deep South. And while Blanco acknowl­edged she still was get­ting adjusted to the new title, she offered an outline of her plans. 
"After we h u g g e d everyone and received con­gratulations from every­
one, we got down to the busi­ness of organizing," Blanco, 60, said Sunday. 
The new governor, who will be inaugurated Jan. 12, said she has already had an emer­gency preparedness briefing and plans immediate meet­ings with the heads of Louisiana's major businesses. She said she had not devel­oped a firm timetable on when she would name the members of her administra­tion. 
The win marks the first time a Democrat has been elected Louisiana governor since Gov. Mike Foster was elected eight years ago. Term limits prevented Foster from running again, but he had thrown his support behind Jindal, his 32-year-old pro­tege and a Republican whiz kid who served as an assis­tant health secretary under President Bush. 
Republicans had hoped Jindal would give them a sweep of governorships in every Deep South state ­Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina -for the first tfme since Reconstruction. 
Blanco won with 52 per­cent, or 730,737 votes, to Jindal's 48 percent, or 676,180. More than half of Louisiana's 2.7 million regis­tered voters cast ballots. an unexpectedly high turnout.

sultant.

swamped Jindal in New Orleans, where Democratic Mayor Ray Nagin had endorsed him instead. 
"I think there was immense disappointment of the endorsement of Bobby. I think it had the effect of energizing our campaign," Blanco said. 
She also gave credit for her victory to her attacks on Jindal's record as a former state health and education official and her final debate appearance, in which she recounted the death of her son when asked about the defining moment in her life. 
"I've always felt or found in a big campaign, people even­tually look for humanity," she said. Her son Ben died in 1998 at age 19 when he was hit by a weight that fell from a crane while he was cutting up a barge for scrap at his summer job. 
Sam Jones, the mayor of Franklin and a Blanco sup­porter, said the final debate offered clear differences between Blanco and Jindal, who had often sounded alike in their positions -touting tax cuts, improving economic development and continuing education reform. 
"Voters made up their minds after [that] night," Jones said. "The energy came at· the end when she drew hard distinctions."

Dean proves more careful with words 
Associated Press 
AMES, Iowa -Howard Dean's off-the-cuff straight talk helped propel him to the front of the Democratic presi­dential field. It's a style he would not think of abandon­ing, but one that's forcing him to be more careful with his words. 
The leader in the nine-way race has a full, nearly year­long record of extemporane­ous r'emarks and apologies. Mea culpas to rivals. Regrets over his Confederate flag comment. Some careless lan­guage about the Middle East process, a topic that demands precision. 
But Dean isn't about to become scripted, according to his advisers. It isn't his way and aides recognize that his directness is' part of his 

Skin cancer leads to other cancers 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Women with common, usually nonfatal forms of skin cancer face dou­ble the risk of developing unrelated cancers, according to a large study, suggesting that the initial diagnosis may be more worrisome that previ­ously thought. 
The skin cancer link was found for several malignan­cies, including cancer of the brain, breasts, ovaries and uterus. It was even stronger for liver cancer, which had a five times higher risk, and lung cancer, which had triple the risk. 
Previous studies have shown that men and women with skin cancer face an increased risk of skin cancer returning. Some also have found that people with non-melanoma skin cancer are prone to later developing non-skin cancers. but the earlier research didn't adequately consider other risk factors that might explain the connection, said the lead author, Dr. Carol Rosenberg of Evanston-Northwestern Healthcare, part of Northwestern University's medical school. 
Her study, involving 92,835 post-menopausal women par­ticipating in a continuing fed­eral study, considered other factors that influence cancer risk -including smoking, weight and education level ­and still found an increased risk associated with skin can­cer. 
Rosenberg said she suspects appeal. 

"Not every word that Howard Dean says is written for him," said Dean campaign manager Joe Trippi. "In fact, almost no words are written for him. He doesn't speak from a teleprompter because you don't say anything when you run that way. He's run­ning for president saying things." 
Still, the former Vermont governor is learning to hold his tongue in some situations. Consider his appearance late Friday night at Iowa State University. 
Students, jammed shoulder to shoulder, applauded the candidate's comments about health care, jobs and foreign policy. But they really were energized when Dean started discussing whether marijua­na use should be illegal. 
her results would apply to men, too, since previous stud­ies involved both genders. 
The results appear in the January issue of the Cancer, an American Cancer Society journal, being published online Monday. 
Of the more than 85,000 women who did not have skin cancer, just over 11 percent, 9,927, reported having had other cancers. 
Of the 7,665 women who reported having had a mild form of skin cancer, nearly 25 percent, 1,878, said they had also had other types of cancer. 
The results are compelling, said Dr. Alexa Boer Kimball, an assistant dermatology pro­fessor at Stanford University. 
Even though most patients with mild skin cancers won't develop other cancers, Kimball said, the results imply that they should still be vigi­lant about getting routine screening tests for other can­cers. 
Given previous research, the authors presumed that skin cancer preceded development of other cancers, though the study lacks information on which developed first. Rosenberg said. 
The skin cancers implicated -basal cell and squamous cell -affect more than 1 mil­lion Americans each year. Those skin cancers grow more

Accounting firm's tax shelter strategies criticized 
Medicare agreement 
Aociatcd Press 

WASHINGTON -President Rush on Sunday enthusiastically endorsed a tentative agreement on legislation to give older Americans a new prescription drug benefit, part of sweeping changes to the government-run Medicare program. 
"I will be actively pushing the bill" in the coming days to ensure passage, Bush said, lead­ing the Republican effort to overcome anticipated resistance from Democrats and objections from some Republicans. 
Hepublican congressional leaders on Saturday announced the breakthrough on the legisla­tion, which would mark the largest ever expansion of Medicare. Republicans hope to pass it by week's end.

In a written statement, 
KPMG said the strategies

environment. None of the 
strategies -nor anything 
like these tax strategies -is 
currently being offered by 
KPMG." 
"Today, KPMG only offers our clients tax services that are tailor-made to address their distinct business objec­tives and tax-planning needs," the statement said. 
Treasury Department offi­cials have indicated that the market for tax shelters appears to be shrinking. But Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the investigative subcommittee, disagreed. "I don't think we have any evidence that it's slowed down at all," he said. 
Levin said case studies assembled by his subcommit­tee staff show that account­ing firms marketed and developed potentially abu­sive shelters with the willing participation of banks, investment firms and lawyers. One shelter required cooperation from tax-exempt state and munici­pal pension funds. 
He said the penalties must be dramatically increased for anyone who abets illegal tax sheltering. At first blush, he said, the promoters should face penalties equivalent to the taxpayers, who lose the tax benefit and pay penalties on top. Promoters currently are fined $1,000. 
They also got a 
tax deduction 
for donating nonvoting stock, 
which was created specifical­
ly for this transaction, to the 
tax-exempt group. 
The subcommittee found 
evidence that about a half­
dozen tax-exempt entities 
participated, but the panel 
learned the identity of only 
two, the Los Angeles munici­
pal pension fund and an 
Austin, Texas, firefighter's 
pension fund. 
A second transaction, known as Bond Linked Issue Premium Structure, generat­ed a loss for taxpayers who typically had $20 million or more in capital gains or ordi­nary income. 
The structure generated a complex web of loans and investments that appeared to lead to establishment of a strategic fund for currency investments. 
Subcommittee aides said the real purpose was to secure a loan that, when eventually paid back, would generate a loss for the tax­payer equal to the income that would have been shel­tered. Two other transac­tions used similar strategies. 
KPMG said all four strate­gies were discontinued between 1998 and 2001. 
Levin said lawmakers need to enact new rules that ban transactions with no busi­ness purpose other than tax avoidance. The legislation has been passed twice in the Senate, but it faces opposi­tion from the Treasury Department and some House members, who believe the change would do little to deter abusive tax shelters.

I've lived in Mishawaka all of my life, and for years I've vainly attempt­ed to defend my community from onslaughts by non-Michiana members of the Notre Dame family. Sure, the weather sucks. there's not a lot to Mike Marchand do, many local cops are jerks, a substantial part of

Alumnus
tion has mullets and a disturbingly significant percent­age of women do, too; but despite all that, I say, at least we don't have a stand-alone Starbucks or a Krispy Kreme. 
Whoops. 
I figured Starbucks and Krispy Kreme never opened stores here because this was a tough market. We don't need a six-dollar double mocha latte venti frappucino when we can get a cup of joe at 7 -Eleven for a buck. While we're at it, we can grab a donut there, too. You have to go all the way to Elkhart to find a Dunkin' Donuts because all the ones here went out of business. 
But I suppose it was inevitable. On Grape Road and Main Street, you can find one of just about every propri­etary establishment in existence. I'm not normally one given to complain about the gradual corporatization of small-town America; as far as I'm concerned, if the people want glaze­covered fried confections, then glaze­covered fried confections they shall receive. 
I soon realized my error in judg­ment: Krispy Kreme is not just a place for glaze-covered fried confections, it's a freakin' lollapalooza under a green roof. Dunkin' Donuts used to represent itself with one short bald guy who woke up in the morning and said "Time to make the donuts." Krispy Kreme generates enough attraction in the media, both tradi­tional and electronic, that store open­ings are practically religious experi­ences. "Krispy Kreme is about the closest thing there is to a rock star company," according to Ben McConnell, co-author of the book Creating Customer Evangelists. 

And from the community's reaction, if Jesus Christ returned to earth at the same time as the new Krispy Kreme's opening, the lines for each would probably be equal. Except that half the people in the line to see Jesus would probably have a box of Krispy Kremes. 
Mishawaka police had to be called to manage the traffic flow at 5:30 a.m. on Oct. 28 when local radio personali­ty Rob Perugini, who set a Krispy Kreme record by waiting in line 17 days, was summoned 
Right. 
But I felt I couldn't really write about the earth-shattering event that is a Krispy Kreme coming to town, since I'd never had a Krispy Kreme doughnut. So I went this past Saturday morning, and the line was still out the door. Cars were lined up around the block in the drive-thru (the store is so popular that Mishawaka is probably going to have to fatten Main Street by a lane in order to accommodate the extra traf­fic). 
After about a half-hour wait, I ordered a dozen so I could share some with my family.

Mishawaka Mayor Robert Beutter declared it Krispy Kreme Doughnut Day after a ribbon-tearing ceremony (the scissors couldn't cut it). Store manager Jason Horvath said he expected to eclipse corporate sales records with the mas­sive opening. 
I heard about all of this from the local news networks and shook my head in disbelief. OK, I know the South Bend Symphony Orchestra or the Broadway Theatre League isn't going to shut down traffic when it sells tickets, but these are doughnuts we're talking about. We're not exactly the healthiest town in America, but when did we all turn into drooling Homer Simpsons? "This place is awe­some," said Michael Dotlich of Elkhart.

Why should it be surprising that many Notre Dame students behave in the manner described in the Nov. 5 Observer Editorial? 
An unfortunate by-product of admissions processes at schools like Notre Dame is that candidates are essentially discouraged from pursuing their own private intellectual fulfill­ment. 
Getting top grades and filling out one's extracurricular resume requires time and effort and does not require a highly developed sense of intellectual curiosity. In many ways, young stu­dents who feel compelled to read for their own pleasure are in grave danger of hindering their own chances for academic success. 
If Notre Dame wanted more students like the ideal ones described in the editorial, its admis­sions department would look for less conformity with academic demands and less task-oriented focus among the bright kids that make up its applicant pool. 
Such a state of affairs would increase the chances of higher dropout rates, but also increase the chances that the school would pro­duce more original thinkers. That's a decent trade-off, if you ask me. 
Finally, the way to resolve the problems with having 30 percent of the undergraduate student body majoring in business is to require double majors in non-business subjects, much the same way the pre-professional majors have done his­torically.

And can you believe that none of the newspapers have reviewed U2's latest full-size poster, "Spirit, Soul, Redemption, Salvation, Emancipation, Prophecy, WILL"?

energy up and engaged into the show. 
One of the best songs of the night is "Michigan," a song dis­cussing what to do when visiting Michigan. It is a good song with a solid beat and harmony, high­lighted with a catch refrain, only forcing you to sing along. 
Since the band has been described as "The Eagles of the new millennium" and one of Chicago's best kept secrets, Hello Dave played an Eagle song. They began singing acapella, which sounded amazing. Himebaugh's strong voice led the song. 
It is evident that Himebaugh, and the other musicians, have a passion for their music. Their songs tell great stories, obviously expressing events from their lives. 
Himebaugh and Magoo switched guitar roles on many of their songs, having the acoustic be the lead for the melody or the electric dominating. 
Hello Dave has much to offer both lyrically and musically. Their songs are independent of each other, providing different sounds. 
This aided in stepping up their show. Bello Dave is a feel-good rock n' roll band with so much talent in each of its members. 
Some of their songs provided a great beat for dancing. Many peo­ple in the crowd took advantage of the vast space between the stage and the tables set up on the floor of Legends. 
"1 thought [the show] was actu­ally very fun," Himebaugh said. "This is our first show in a little while. We don't do that many shows where it's like sit down and relaxed. It was the perfect way to come back from a break." 
The end of the show was ener­getic, singable and loud. It was the ideal ending to a great con­cert. Hello Dave came out and performed well for a crowd of people who were excited to in attendance.

Hello Dave 
w-ow-s crow-d 
By SARAH VABULAS Scene Editor 
Students filed into Legends Friday night, ready to listen to the sounds of Chicago band, Hello Dave. 
Hello Dave is comprised of lead vocalist, songwriter and rhythm-guitarist Mike Himebaugh, bassist Allen "Big AI" Wetzel, percussionist Bryan Resendiz and lead guitarist Mike "Magoo" McGahan, who togeth­er provided an entertaining compilation of llello Dave favorites as well as some new songs. 
Hello Dave began the show on a funky, upbeat note, allowing the crowd, both those familiar with the band and those who had not heard of them before, to engage into the music and ready themselves for an exciting show. 
Magoo spent a few seconds during the opening song exhibit­ing his skills on the electric guitar. Hello Dave came off really relaxed on stage, just having a good time playing together again. Nothing but smiles remained on all their faces throughout the course ofthe show. 
The second song, "Perfect Day," had a bit of a country sound, but could be more accurately described as real American rock n' roll. Himebaugh described tllis song by saying it "started when some punk stole our trailer." It is a catchy tune with much to offer melodically. 
Between songs, the crowd has opportunities to interact with the band and just let them know they were having fun. Good energy could be felt from the band and the crowd, emanating through the room. 
Himebaugh's voice is almost hypnotic, making the songs all that much better with his incredi­ble vocal abilities.

Last home game for Irish seniors is an easy 33-14 win over Brigham Young

On Senior Day, it was fitting that a senior would help lead tho Irish to vietory. 
.Julius Jones eontinued to help paee the team's offense with 161 yards and three touchdowns, and the Irish finally managed their first winning streak of the season with a 3:~-14 win over BYU Saturday. 
"It's always nicer to not have to win on a last-second f'inld goal," said Irish head eoaeh Tyrone Willingham, alluding to Notre Dame's pre­vious two wins at home this year -against Washington State and Navy -which both came down to last-seeond field goals.

McKnight, who has been Notre Dame's most reliable receiver so far this year, led the team with eight catches for 98 yards, but perhaps none more important than that one in the third quarter. 
"Whether offense or defense, anytime you have a big play your team peaks out there, and that's what we need," McKnight said. 
The Irish offense stalled several times in the first half, as Notre Dame was forced to settle for field goals in three straight trips to the red zone en route to an early 9-7 lead. With 25 seconds left in the half, Jones broke through on third-and-goal for a 1-yard touchdown run to give the Irish some momentum going into halftime. 
After going ahead 2:~ -7 on Jones' second touchdown on the game, the Notre Dame defense would stand tall, not allowing a single offensive yard to the Cougars in the third quarter and helping take advantage of four BYU 
turnovers in the game -the largest number of turnovers the Irish have caused since their win against Florida State last season. 
ILJ. Fitzpatrick, who set a new eareer high with four field goals, kicked a late field goal and Jones added a 13­yard touchdown run with just 47 seconds left in the game to give Notre Dame its highnst points total since a 42-0 shutout of Hutgers last year.

c 
8 8 A 8­A­A-
quarterbacks: Quinn had a performance similar to last week except he didn't throw for a TO and threw an intercep­tion. With the defense and running game, Quinn didn't have to play great. 
running backs: The Irish have found the winning formula-ride Jones to a victory. His three TO day was a fitting way to go out and Grant seemed to run harder than usual. 
receivers: McKnight had another impressive day, but Jenkins had another drop and it's becoming time to send out a search party for Stovall who doesn't have a catch since Nov. 1. 
offensive line: Another solid day for a 
group fighting through injuries and 
another day where the running backs went for over 200 yards. The 
unit gave up its first sacks since USC. 
defensive line: BYO could get nothing going on the ground, but on anum­ber of occassions, containment of the running back or quarterback was a problem. The pass rush wasn't con­sistent all day. 
linebackers: Curry and Watson each had 
an interception and the duo combined for two sack.<;. Add Hoyte into the mix and the linebackers had a combined · 
seven tackles for a loss. 

defensive backs: An inconsistent day by a group going up against a pass-happy offense. BYU receivers were wide-open a number of times, but Burrell's intercep­tion down sealed the victory. 
special teams: The kickoff and punt cov­erage was the best it has been all year and Fitzpatrick was perfect on field goals. The only negative was the low punt average. 
coaching: BYU had 16 days to prepare for the Irish and came out with a ton of trick plays. The Irish were very well prepared and the coaches are showing a commitment to ride Jones.

overall: The streak continues as Notre Dame clawed anoth­er victory away from Navy. Now, can the Irish keep a good thing going?

Julius Jones high-fived fans, got patted on the back and walked through the tunnel of Notre Dame Stadium for the last time with a smile on his face Saturday. 
For Jones and the Irish, every­thing was forgot­ten for a short time. 
The players forgot about the 4-6 record. The three straight home losses. The blowouts and embarrassments in this disap­pointing season. 
And Jones could enjoy the moment without thoughts of his past struggles and shortcomings. 
All failures of the 2003 season weren't on the minds of Irish players and coaches Saturday when, in the second half, Notre Dame played like Notre Dame should. 
The Irish beat BYU on Senior Day by their biggest margin of victory all season-33-14. They did so impres­sively -by using a ball control offense to dominate time of posses­sion, and a stifling defense that did not allow the Cougars' offense a sin­gle yard in the third quarter. They did so with a powerful running game, led by Jones' 161 yards and three touch­downs. And they did so by playing the way great Irish teams did during Notre Dame's successful seasons. 
The only difference was this season has been far from great, or for that matter, even mediocre. The team is 4­6 with slim hopes of a bowl and a best case scenario of a .500 record. They have been slammed by top teams in ways few thought Notre Dame foot­ball teams would ever allow. 


But Saturday, it's doubtful that the players or coaches were thinking of the struggles this season when they saluted the student body after the game. 
No one remembered the disappoint­ment of losing to Michigan, Michigan State and Purdue in successive weeks.

story is similar to the story of the 2003 Irish. He had great expectations put on him after a solid junior season, while the Irish were expecting good things in 2003 after finishing the 2002 season with a 10-3 record. 
Adversity hit the star tailback before last year when found himself out of school and out of a future with football when he didn't have the grades to stay enrolled. Not until he recommitted to the books at Arizona State and trained himself to become a better player and person did Jones make his way back to South Bend. He came back this season ready to become a leader for Notre Dame and finish what he started four years ago. 
But more struggles were ahead for Jones and the Irish, as the team lost games and Jones played inconsistent­ly. 
But Saturday both Jones and the Irish came full circle. Notre Dame played one of its best games of the season and got the win, much thanks to the performance of the senior run­ning back. 
For a few moments Saturday, everything was good for the gold hel­mets.

Saturday. 

For all the times the team played poorly this season, they played well in the second half of the seniors final home game. How appropriate that Jones led the way. Notre Dame played well below expectations for much of the season and Jones didn't put up the numbers he hoped in several of those games. · 
But Jones and Notre Dame ended the home season on a high note by playing to expectations in the second half of the BYU game. 
They didn't have to remember the past Saturday, but simply focused on the moment when Notre Dame foot­ball came back to life for a short time.

Unit makes big plays, contains Cougar offensive attack in 33-14 win 
By MATT LOZAR A.sociate Spotts Editor 
The defnnsn, appropriately led by its seniors, did some things Saturday it really hasn't donn all year. 
Early in thn game, the defense set the tmw on an intnreeption by linebacker Courtney Watson ofT a Brigham Young screen pass. The interception was Watson's first of the year and the coaches had let him know about that all week long. 
"It did fnel good because all week the coaches wern getting on me since I did­n't have a pick all year," the firth-year snnior said. "Last year I had four of them, so it was good to get it early." 
That turnover, whieh set the tone for the nntire day, was the first of a sea­son-high four for the Notre Dame defense. 
But the most impressive statistic for this defense Saturday was holding the BYU offense to three plays or less on seven conseeutivn drives. In the third quarter, the Cougars had zero yards of offense. 
Players don't get caught up in streaks like that during the game, but they assuredly notieed it throughout that third quarter, as their bodies were full of energy. 
"I think our bodies told us because we did a lot of standing on the side," Watson said. "I remember specifically in the third quarter just sit­ting there, and saying,

When the youngsters made plays, the seniors were the first ones to congratu­late them. 
"It's a lot more like the defense that we know that we can play like. It's beautiful to see, especially when you aren't in there for a few series and you see everybody out there doing things," given up by the Irish on 
two drives of a combined seven plays. But the defense stayed focused Saturday, determined to send the seniors playing their last game at Notre Dame Stadium out the right way. 
"I think we've had an up and down season but today we kind of had an up and down game, but we pulled it out," defensive end Justin Tuck. "I think we are never going to come out of a game perfect. We never come out of a game and did everything the way we wanted to. 
"We really wanted to send our sen­iors out with a great game and I think we did that." 
During the disappointing start to the season, this defense showed flashes of its 2002 form. Saturday, that defining characteristic from last year came back, after all the Senior Day emotions allowed the Irish to just play football. 
"I felt a little bit of relaxation after [the emotion[ died down, but more importantly, I think we got our swagger back, our tenacious attitude back, [which is] something that has been missii;J.g for awhile. It showed up in spurts, but we were very persistent in this game," Campbell said. 
"After all the emotion died down and we were able to focus a little bit more, we definitely were a lot more relaxed and were able to capitalize on all the mistakes they made."

"They are going to be out­standing," running back .Julius Jones said of the line's potential for next sea­son. "They are young this year, a lot of them have never played before, but they got a lot of experience this year and have done well." 
Despite allowing two sacks to the blitz-oriented BYU defense, pass blocking has greatly improved over the last several games, as Notre Dame allowed zero sacks in the last three games before BYU. 
Kicking back and enjoying himself 
D.J. Fitzpatrick certainly doesn't look like a walk-on anymore. The junior from loeal Marian High School has replaced injured start­ing kicker Nicholas Setta since the Pittsburgh game and has stepped right into the pressure-packed kicker's role nicely. 
Fitzpatrick has hit six straight field goals sinee his last two against Navy, ineluding that game's last­second game-winner, and has helped provide the Irish with points when drives stall in the end zone. 

"Those last two I hit in the Navy game, especially the last one, really gave me some confidence," Fitzpatrick said. "I just got that thought in my head and now I'm hitting it great." 
With Setta possibly return­ing for Notre Dame's next game against Stanford in two weeks, Fitzpatrick isn't fretting about losing his job. 
"Nick's a great kicker," Fitzpatrick said. "He's taught me a lot, and if he eomes back, it'll be up to the coaches. I know we'll both keep trying."

CROSS COUNTRY 

Huddle leads Irish -women to title, men finish in eighth place 
ByJOE LINDSLEY 
Sports Writer 

Led by a sophomore, the fourth-ranked Notre Dame women's cross country team earned its second consecutive Great Lakes Region title Saturday in Terre Haute, Ind., which means that the Irish have an automatic bid to next Monday's national champi­onships. Sophomore Molly Huddle led not only her team, but the entire field as she com­pleted the 6,000-meter course in 20:14. 
While the Irish women saw plenty of success, the men, who came in eighth place, did not finish high enough to automati­cally qualify for the national championships, and they will not know until today whether they ran well enough to earn an at-large bid to the NCAA title race. 
For the women, Saturday's race continued a season of suc­cesses that includes the team's second consecutive Big East conference title. 
"It seems like everyone just keeps improving in each race," Huddle said. "It's really exciting to see how good we can get. A,nd we feel like we can get even better than that, too." 
Huddle, who last year took second at the Great Lakes regional, admits she had a feel­ing she would do well before Saturday's competition began. 
After the first kilometer of the race, Huddle says she became fairly confident that she was in control of the outcome, partly because she could not hear any runners behind her. 
"I was always kind of worried about someone sneaking up on me, [but] I couldn't hear them behind me, so I thought that was a good sign," she said. 
Huddle was followed by jun­ior Lauren King, who was sev­enth overall with her time of 
20:48. Junior Kerry Meagher, senior Megan Johnson and sophomore Stephanie Madia completed the Irish top five with their eighth, 12th, and 15th place fmishes, respective­ly. 
In the men's race, the Irish were led by senior Todd Mobley, who arrived at the fin­ish line in seventh place after completing the 10,000-meter course in 30:4 7. He was not far behind the race's individual champion, Eastern Michigan's Gavin Thompson, who finished the course with a time of 30:12. 
Supporting the Irish behind Mobley were sophomore Tim Moore, who finished 15th in 30:54, freshman Kurt Benninger in 38th place, sopho­more Sean O'Donnell in 41st and senior Brian Kerwin in 44th. 
According to Moore it was tougher competition and inex­perience that hindered the Irish runners, who, he believes, ran well overall. 
"No one really ran badly," Moore said. "Last year, we did­n't really have too many great races coming out of the district, but this time I guess it's a little harder because we all ran pret­ty well." 
While the Irish are awaiting their fate, which will be deter­mined today, Moore believes that if given one of the 13 at­large bids to the national cham­pionship, Notre Dame will beat even some of the teams who surpassed the Irish Saturday. 
"We still think we have the potential to beat a lot of the teams that were there," Moore said. "I think if we run our best, we can still get top ten in the country, which has been our goal all season."

Oklahoma still No. 1 
Associated Press 

Oklahoma remained No. 1 in The Associated Press col­lege football Top 25 for the 13th straight poll, the third­
longest  run  ever to begin  
the season.  
The  Sooners  (1 0-0)  

received all 65 first-place votes in balloting by the panel of sports writers and broadcasters Sunday, one day after beating Baylor 41­3. 
The rest of the top five remained the same, with Southern California, LSU, Ohio State and Michigan fol­lowing Oklahoma in the poll. 
There will be some change next because the Buckeyes and Wolverines play with the outright Big Ten title on the line. 
The only teams to be N-o. 1 in more consecutive polls to start the season than Oklahoma are Florida State, which went wire-to-wire in 1999, and Nebraska, which had a run of 15 straight No. 1 rankings in 1983 until los­ing the Orange Bowl to Miami. 
Army and Notre Dame went wire-to-wire in 1945 and 1943 respectively, when the polls didn't begin until October. 
Oklahoma received the maximum 1,625 points, 
beating out USC, which had 1,559. 
Georgia, Texas, Washington State, Tennessee and TCU round out the top 10. The Horned Frogs are the only undefeat­ed team in major college football other than Oklahoma. 
The USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll had the same top eight teams as the AP. 
Florida State, the first team to clinch a BCS berth after winning the ACC on Saturday, was 11th and Virginia Tech was 12th. Miami and Florida were tied for 13th, followed by Mississippi, Purdue, Iowa, Miami of Ohio, Kansas State and Boise State. 
Pittsburgh, Bowling Green, Nebraska, Oklahoma State and West Virginia round out the poll. 
Kansas State, Oklahoma State and West Virginia are this week's newcomers, replacing Minnesota, Michigan State and Northern Illinois. 
The Big 12 and SEC lead all conferences with five teams apiece in the poll, fol­lowed by four each for the Big Ten and Big East, and two for the Pac-10 and Mid­American. Florida State is the only ACC team in the poll.

Associated Press 
CINCINNATI -Pop the corks and make the toast, you '72 Dolphins. The per­fect record is safe for one more season. 
It's guaranteed. 
With a punt return and a long touchdown catch, Peter Warrick eclipsed Kansas City's playmakers and let the Cincinnati Bengals back up their boast Sunday with a 24-19 victory over the Chiefs. 
Trying to become the first team to go 10-0 since the 1998 Broncos, the less­than-perfect Chiefs unrav­eled against the Bengals (5-5), who finished the day tied for first after making Chad Johnson's guarantee come true. 
"The worst thing is to have a guy come out and shoot his mouth making a statement, and they stood up to it," Chiefs corner­back Eric Warfield said. "This is a good team, but we feel like we shouldn't have lost." 
The undefeated '72 Dolphins get together for a toast when the last winless team falls each season, reveling in their distinc­tion. Warrick made this unbeaten team fall hard. 
"That's having my back," said Johnson, who apolo­gized to some of the Chiefs on the field for his guaran­tee. "They didn't leave me hanging in the wind, and I didn't want to leave them hanging in the wind." 

The victory left them into a first-place tie with Baltimore in the AFC North. The Bengals haven't been in contention this late in a season since 1990, the last time they had a winning record. 
Johnson was in the trainer's room getting intravenous fluids for cramps when Warrick made one cut and headed upfield on a 68-yard punt return early in the fourth quarter. He hoisted the ball in celebration when he reached the 20-yard line -and the '72 Dolphins could get ready to hoist those glasses. 
On the Chiefs sideline, players just dropped their heads, turned their backs and blamed themselves. 
Rudi Johnson ran for 165 yards and Kitna threw two touchdown passes and avoided a game-turning mistake as Cincinnati posi­tioned itself to pull off the upset. 
Trent Green threw two touchdown passes in the final seven minutes, the last one a 3-yard toss to Jason Dunn with 3:19 to go. The Chiefs never got the ball back. 
IN BRIEF 
James becomes Colts all­
time rushing leader 
INDIANAPOLIS -Edgerrin James became the Colts' all-time rushing leader early in the second half Sunday. 
James surpassed Lydell Mitchell when he gained 3 yards on his first carry of the third quarter. He entered the game against the New York Jets needing 75 yards to break Mitchell's career mark of 5,487. James carried 18 times for 72 yards in the first half, then broke the record with a short run up the middle. 
James finished with 127 yards on 36 carries, giving him 5,540 career yards. He also scored three touch­downs, the most he had in a game since Dec. 11, 2000, at Buffalo. 
The Colts are one of only two fran­chises with five rushers to have gained 5,000 career yards. The other team is Cleveland. 
James also rushed for two first-half touchdowns, the first time he scored more than one in a game since Sept. 

9, 2001, also against the Jets. 
Federer sweeps Agassi for 
year-end title 
HOUSTON -Neither Andre Agassi nor dreadful weather was going to stop Roger Federer. 
Capping a perfect tournament with another sublime performl!-nce, Federer beat Agassi 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 in a rain-interrupted final Sunday to win the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup for his tour-high sev­enth title of 2003. 
Federer earned $1,520,000 and moved up to No. 2 in the rankings, behind Andy Roddick. The Wimbledon champion went 5-0 against an elite field, including victo­ries over the other reigning Grand Slam champions: Agassi (Australian Open), Roddick (U.S. Open) and Juan Carlos Ferrero (French Open). 
By the end of the event's most lop­sided final since 1997, Agassi would shake his head after losing points. He never managed one break point, while Federer conjured 39 winners, three times as many as Agassi. 
South Africa's Immelman,
Sabbatini win World Cup 
KIAWAH ISLAND, S.C. -South Africa's Trevor lmmelman and Hory Sabbatini combined to shoot a l­over-par 73 Sunday for a four-stroke victory at the World Cup. 
Immelman and Sabbatini finished at 13-under 275 and gave South Africa its second World Cup title in three years and fifth overall. Ernie Els and Hetief Goosen teamed up to win in 2001, when the World Cup was played in Japan. 
The U.S. team of Jim Furyk and Justin Leonard was in contention until going bogey-triple bogey at Nos. 12 and 13. The Americans shot a 3­over 75 and finished in a tic for fifth at 4-under 284. 
The Americans fell off the pace after carding a triple-bogey 7 on the 440-yard 13th after Furyk hit his tee shot into the water.

Irish fail to -win regular season title 
By HEATHER VAN 
HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer 

Motivation comes from unlike­ly sources. No. 12 Notre Dame found this out Sunday afternoon in a five-game loss to Pittsburgh (22-4, 11-1). 
The loss (20-30, 30-26, 30-25, 13-30, 15-13) was one that thrust Pittsburgh into a tie with the Irish (22-4, 11-1) for the regular season Big East title, and gave the Panthers the No. 1 seed in this weekend's Big East tournament. 
But there's no doubt about it, the Irish are quite disappointed after a match that saw their offense falter and their play spo­radic. 
It was the first time the Irish lost to the Panthers since 1990, a streak that extended for 15 games before Sunday. 
"I think that we're really down right now," head coach Debbie Brown said. "But if it's not as much motivation as could possi­bly be given to turn it around to come back in the championships ... I don't know of anything else that could be more motivating, really." 
The Irish were unable to sus­tain any momentum in the match which saw the Irish win by the largest margin this sea­son (17 points) in the fourth game, .when they had just one error on 19 attempts, good for a .632 attack percentage. 
"I think it was sporadic play," Brown said. "I think we just did certain things that were unchar­acteristic of our team -we gave up some points that we haven't before." 
The Irish led 7-4 in the final game before the Panthers tied it 8-8 and went on to win the match. 
"I certainly would like to have that match back and have the regular season title, but we just have to bounce back and win the championship tournament," Brown said. 
Sophomore middle blocker Lauren Brewster led the way for the Irish with 21 kills and 10 blocks, and senior setter Kristen Kinder dished out 51 assists to go with a season-high 15 digs. Libero Meg Henican had a career-high 25 digs. 
But the Irish offense wasn't itself at Pittsburgh, as they fin­ished the match hitting only .215, with a .000 hitting per­centage in game three. · 
"I can't really pinpoint it on any one thing," Brown said. "On offense, we struggled a little bit, but I think it was just a lack of us staying at a high level of.play throughout the match." 
The Irish will have to turn things around before this week­end, as they face No. 3 seed Miami in the first round on Saturday. 
"There are a lot of little things that we can work on," Brown said. "So I think that I don't doubt our ability to come back and play at a higher level than we did and that's to take noth­ing away from Pittsburgh; I thought they played very well." 
One positive on the night for the Irish was their blocking. 
They fmished with 22.5 on the match, a season high. Lauren Kelbey and Emily Loomis were both in on eight for the Irish, who were disappointed with the loss.

Irish open season 1-1 
By JOE HETTLER 
Sports Editor 

Muffet McGraw wanted her team to compete hard against two of the top teams in the coun­try in the WBCA tournament last weekend. 
After beating No. 22 Auburn 77-64 then falling to No. 20 Colorado 67-63 in overtime, Notre Dame did just that to open the season 1-1. 
"I was pleased with our atti­tudes," McGraw said. "I thought we really competed well." 
The Irish opened their season by knocking off the defending WNIT champion Tigers behind Jacqueline Batteast's 27 points on 12-20 shooting. Katy Flecky added 17 points and made all six of her free throws. 
One of the keys to No_tre Dame's victory was stopping Auburn star forward Natasha Brackett. Brackett only scored 14 points on 4-10 shooting. McGraw said the team's zone defense was the key to contain­ing Brackett. 
"We were in a zone all game and did a great job on her the whole game," McGraw said. "We always knew where she was on the court." 
Batteast led Notre Dame's first half charge as she scored 11 points in the first nine minutes to help give the Irish a 36-27 halftime edge. 
Flecky put the game away with a 3-pointer with under five minutes to play to push the game out of reach for Auburn. 
Notre Dame jumped on Colorado from the opening tip and took a 12-0 lead. But the Buffaloes battled back to cut the lead to 37-33 at halftime. 
The Irish lead by three with less than ten seconds left in the game. but Colorado's Veronica Johns-Richardson drilled a , three-pointer as time expired to send the game into overtime. 
In the extra session, the Buffaloes' Emily Waner hit a three-pointer with 12.6 seconds remaining and the Colorado defense held on Notre Dame's next possession to clinch the win and the tournament champi­onship. 
Batteast had 13 points and 10 rebounds and Le'Tania Severe had 14 points, six rebounds and four assists to lead the Irish. 
Notre Dame had several opportunities to finish off the Buffaloes but could not capital­ize. Megan Duffy missed the front end of a one-and-one free throw chance with 19 seconds left in regulation with Notre Dame up three points. Batteast also turned the ball over on the Irish last possession.

The women's swimming and diving team continued its win­ning ways despite losing some swimmers to illness with a tri­meet sweep over Bowling Green (0-5) and Louisville (3-6), 188-90 and 189-89, respectively. 
"A lot of us had to sit out because of illness," senior Meghan Perry-Eaton said. "Our swimmers that were healthy just had to make sure that they stepped it up." 
The No. 19 Irish (4-1) domi­nated the meet, taking 15 of 16 events. 
Senior Lisa Garcia (200-yard butterfly, 100-yard butterfly. and 200-yard individual medley) recorded a trio of victories to lead the way for the Irish, while freshmen Katie Carroll (50-yard freestyle and 100-yard freestyle) and Ellen Johnson (1,000-yard freestyle and 200-yard back­stroke) and Perry-Eaton (1-and 3-meter diving) each won a pair of events. 

For Perry-Eaton, the two victo­ries preserved her undefeated record in diving this season. 
"I trained hard this summer and have been focused this sea­son," Perry-Eaton said. "We have a bunch of new divers this year, and we're working well as a team, which is really benefi-

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Ellis sees court from other side 
By MATT LOZAR 
Associare Spores Ediror 
Mike Hrey almost scheduled his team into an exhibition loss. 
Brey called Notre Dame graduate LaPhonso Ellis and asked him if he would be interested in playing against the Irish when they plaJ.ed the Illinois All-Stars. Ellis thought Brey was just joking around. but Ellis returned Brey's phone call and found out Notre Dame's coach was serious. lie decided to jump at the opportunity. 
"I made the phone call to see how serious [Brey] actual­ly was and obviously he was," Ellis said. "He of course need­ed to check with the Illinois All-Stars and the coaches to see if it was OK with them before he offered. A couple things came together [and I got to play]." 
Ellis was already coming to Notre Dame with his son for a "Dad-Son" weekend to watch the Irish in the exhibition game and the football team play Brigham Young. 
What made Ellis' perfor­mane -18 points on 7 -of-16 shooting, nine rebounds and four assists -even more amazing, was that Friday night was the Notre Dame star's first game since he retired from the NBA in April. 
But he credits his stat line on the abilities of his team­mates, especially their impressive 3-point shooting (15-of-27). 
"It was great. I had great teammates who could pene­trate and shoot the basket­ball. When you are playing with guys who really know how to play the game, it makes everything else easier," Ellis said. "Catching the ball on the inside, looking at guys and they know how to cut and just dropping passes for easy lay-ups. 
"When you are playing with really good players, it makes the game so much easier." 
That combined performance by Ellis and the rest of the Illinois All-Stars gave Brey some thoughts as this game stayed close the entire night. 
As Torrian Jones toed the free throw line with 1.4 sec­onds remaining and his team needing two free throws to send the game into overtime, Brey was formulating ways to turn an exhibition loss, a loss he would have been responsi­ble for, into something good during practice this week. 
"I was thinking as [Torrian] was going back for his second free throw. 'We can turn this into something over the next week,"' Brey said. "To have him hit those free throws and have the will to finish the game I thought was good. I wanted to add LaPhonso and then when he was spinning and shooting Uumpers] and passing, I'm thinking, 'Uh-oh, way to go, coach."' 
Ellis has scrimmaged with the Irish on football weekends and has good relationships with most of the team. 
The one player who Ellis especially takes a liking to is forward Torin Francis. With Ellis and Francis both being low-post players. Ellis has a good feel for the Irish sopho­more and sees a player who is dose to becoming dominant. 
"He has a great upside potential. With Torin, he rebounds the ball very well. He is strong qown there. If there is one thing I have to encourage him with is to real­ly take his time down there and to realize he is pretty close to unstoppable," Ellis said. 
"He is awfully tough down there and I love the confi­dence that he is playing with. The thing I love so much about him is that last year, he progressed and got better and better, culminating with his great performance through­out the NCAA Tournament. I just have a lot of affection for 

Dinner starting at $6.45 222 Dixieway S., S.B. 574-272-7376 

all of those guys, but particu­larly Torin, because when you've had a year like that and end the way he ended there is a bit of pressure that comes from the outside. 
"He worked really hard this summer, he looks in great shape, and I think he is going to have a great year." 
Eleven years after playing his last game with the Irish, Ellis suited up against his for­mer team in a place where he spent four years exciting Notre Dame fans. 
Friday night, even though some of the details are differ­ent, the trip back for Ellis was well worth it. 
"Although the environment isn't the same, the JACC has­n't changed. I love playing in here. The energy is a little different," Ellis said. "Obviously the cast of charac­ters on the side is a little dif­ferent and the uniforms ·are different, I can't say it was unusual. 
"There were enough things that were different that didn't make it unusual but enjoy­able."

number of perfect passes. 
With both teams scorching from 3-point land, the game was at a very high pace during the first half. The Irish made nine 3-pointers while the Illinois All-Stars hit eight. 
But for the Irish, their leading long distance shooter in the first half was a very unlikely source -forward Jordan Cornette. The junior, after sitting out the team's exhibition opener against Hoop Group because of a knee injury, made four of his five first half 3-point attempts, including scoring nine straight Notre Dame points at one point in the contest. He finished the first half with 18 points. 
"I was feeling it. The rim looked two times the size than it usually is .to be honest," Cornette said. "I was just feeling confident about my shot. I know what I'm capable of and I was able to show it tonight." 
While Cornette assumed a new role in the frrst half. it was Torrian Jones' turn in the sec­ond half. Jones became more active on the offensive end, drove to the hole aggressively and got to the rim easily on sev­eral drives. 
"I felt the flow of the game. I thought I needed to make some plays. I was patient and stuff came to me," Jones said. "I knew it was a mis!llatch. The guy that was guarding me is a great player, but he wasn't a guy that knew how to move his feet. I exploited that mismatch and I was able to get to the bas­ket and make some tough shots." 
The Irish needed Jones the most down the stretch. He was pushed underneath the basket with 1.4 seconds remaining in the second half and stepped to the free throw line with the Irish down 85-83. 
The first one hit the front of the rim and bounced in. After a time-out by the Illinois All-Stars, the second one was a perfect swish and the game went into overtime. 

In the extra session, Thomas put the Illinois All-Stars away, fittingly hitting two 3-point bas­kets to extend an 87-85 Notre Dame lead to a 95-88 advantage during a quick 8-2 Irish run. 
All those pressure-packed sit­uations, getting contributiol'ls from players other than the usual scorers, making free throws to keep the game going and making big shots down the stretch, should only the help the Irish later this year. 
"For us to have to make deci­sions in an overtime game, make free throws and then come into overtime and make plays, I just hope you grow up and get a little more confident before you start playing, espe­cially on your home floor," Brey said. 
Forward Torin Francis fin­ished with 14 points and 22 rebounds. Guard Chris Quinn was 4-of-4 on 3-pointers and had 19 points. Thomas also had nine assists. 
The difference in the game came at the free throw line as the Irish hit 11-of-15 while the Illinois All-Stars were 5-of-20, including 0-for-7 in the second half. 
Friday night's biggest disap­pointment was Notre Dame's play on defense. Coming into the game, Brey and the players talked about improving the effort on team defense. 
That improvement didn't seem to occur, as the Illinois All­Stars came out and made a ton of shots early in the game, mak­ing Friday night the second straight night where Notre Dame's opponent came out and scored easily early in the game. 
That defensive effort is some­thing the Irish feel they need to stop -right now. 
"Northern Illinois will blow us out if we play defense like this, if we try to outshoot them. We aren't going to have a shooting night like this every night," Thomas said. "We can't always rely on offense like we did tonight."

Irish Big East victory not just a trophy 
Winning the conference means nothing. 
Hang around college sports and you will hear such criti­cism more often than you should. 
And it is a fact that a conference championship between two highly ranked teams often has little to no signifi­cance in the grand scheme of things -just another piece of information for next season's stat book. 

That was not the case, how­ever, in the Big East champi­onship game between Notre Dame and St. John's Sunday. 
In fact, the belief that a con­ference championship means nothing only spawns from March Madness fans and ana­lysts who want to see the Cinderella story, the below .500 seven-seed defeating the one­seed in the final game to collect an automatic NCAA tourna­ment bid. 
Notre Dame and St. John's had already clinched a berth to the NCAA's before Friday, so why did it matter who won the conference? 
Well, following a 1-0 victory over Providence Friday night, Irish captain Greg Martin was asked who he would rather play in the final, Rutgers or St. John's-both teams beat Notre Dame by three goals in their matches this season. 
"Either one would be great, because they both got us earli­er, but I think we'd like to play Saint John's," senior captain Greg Martin said. 
"They've got the four-seed national ranking and we've got the five. It'd be nice to be No. 1 [in the Big East], and we really want to take home the hard­ware this weekend, but it'd be nice to have a shot at St. John's and prove who the real number four seed is." 
And there it was. By winning Sunday, Notre Dame would put themselves closer to achieving that fourth-seed national rank­ing, which would in turn give the Irish a bye in the first round of the NCAA's and home field advantage until the Final Four.

Kevin Richards helped Notre Dame's cause with his first goal since Oct. 8, 2000. 
Does Notre Dame absolutely need to play on the friendly confines of Alumni Field to advance in the NCAA tourna­ment? Not the way the team is playing right now, giving up no goals in the entire Big East tournament. 
But the Big East champi­onship means even more this year because of the strength of the conference. 
The Big East is one of the best all-around conferences in the nation. Big East teams are a commanding 53-31-12 versus other conferences, a record that shows the depth of the conference and not just the quality of its top teams. 
Seven Big East teams are in the top eight of their respective regions. Notre Dame holds first in the Great Lakes region, and St. John's is number one in New York. Connecticut sits at third in all of New England. Rutgers (3), Seton Hall (5) and Villanova (8) are scattered among the top teams in the Middle-Atlantic region, and Virginia Tech -a cellar­dweller for many years -is now fifth in the South Atlantic. 
Though Notre Dame and St. John's were the only two teams in the top 25 as of Nov. 10, Virginia Tech, Rutgers and Connecticut all received votes."The great thing about our league is the Big East is a tremendous conference, top to bottom," coach Bobby Clark said. 
"Some of the teams that used to be weaker have improved. The classic is Virginia Tech, who has come up from being a cellar team to being one of the top teams. Providence has done well, and Villanova is another team that has had a tremen­dous season. 
In the Big East you cannot take any team for granted." 
Strength of schedule and a huge effort in Connecticut this weekend have the men excited about their achievements and prepared, especially if they do get the No.4 seed, to make a serious run at the national championship.

"A lot of times at the end of the game they're throwing everyone forward," Riley said. "They're the times you can really ice games." 
Notre Dame recorded its 13th shutout of the season and its third of the tournament, outscor­ing opponents 4-0 at Big East tournament. 
Senior defender Kevin Richards scored Notre Dame's first goal. His second career goal came at the 77:59 mark to break a scoreless tie. 
Senior forward Devon Prescod hit Richards on a sideline run from 50 yards out and Richards split two defenders at the 18­yard line before hitting a shot far side. One of four assistant cap­tains, Richards had not scored since a 3-1 loss to Providence on Oct. 8, 2000. 
"In the first half I hadn't really tried to take the left back one­on-one. I was just crossing balls," Richards said. "I got the pass, and the defender was shading me down the line, so I cut it back inside and found myself right behind the defense. So I settled myself and tried to hit the back post." 
Richards is even more of an unlikely hero for a team whose top three scorers -Detter (12), Prescod (11) and Martin (5) ­have accounted for 28 of the team's 33 goals this season. 
"(Prescod] predicted that someone who hadn't scored in a while was going to score today," Richards said. "I guess it was 
me." 
Goaltender Chris Sawyer, named Big East goaltender of the year, made four saves in the game. Notre Dame is now 2-8-2 against St. John's all-time. 
The Irish earned the right to compete in the title game by defeating Providence, 1-0, on a blistering cold Friday evening. 
Forward Justin Detter flicked home a Kevin Goldthwaite free kick at the 68:13 mark in the second half, a.nd the Irish held on despite late surges from the desperate Friars in the first tour­nament meeting of the two squads. 
Providence (6-9-3, 4-5-1 Big East), the only team in the Big East tournament not ranked in the top 10 in its respective region, needed to win the whole tournament in order to reach the

NCAA's with an automatic bid. 
But Notre Dame would not relent after the first goal, staying in the Providence end of the field and applying pressure. 
"Notre Dame soccer is never going to sink in and play defense," captain Greg Martin said. "We're good when we're proactive defensively. We call it stepping. What the Boss [Irish head coach Bobby Clark] says and what I tell the boys after we score is 'five minutes hard.' After you score you want to hold onto the ball because lots of times in soccer, goals follow goals." 
Notre Dame out shot Providence 16-10 as seven dif­ferent Irish players had legiti­mate scoring chances, shots either saved or shot wide. 
After inching by Providence, Notre Dame opened the first half of the fmal game by out-shooting St. John's 7-5 in the first half. The Red Storm, however, had the best chances. Less than five minutes in, a timely offsides call saved the Irish from surrender­ing a penalty kick. 
Notre Dame repeatedly dumped the ball deep into the St. John's end in an attempt to slow the Red Storm tempo. 
But St. John's came right back,· peppering Notre Dame goal­tender Chris Sawyer. Sawyer saved a hard shot from Georgios Spanos at the 31:20 mark from 20 yards out. 
Notre Dame responded with a threat of its own. Justin Detter, who scored the lone Irish goal in the semifinal victory, juked left and hit a shot that St. John's goaltender Bill Gaudette cor­ralled at the 25:40 mark. 
Both goalies were solid, but Sawyer would soon prove why he was named Big East goal­tender of the year. 
With 18:30 remaining, St. John's midfielder Simone Salinno made a soft drop pass to mid­fielder Angel Rodriguez. Rodriguez drilled a rocket from 22 yards out that seemed des­tined for the back of the net. 
An alert Sawyer leapt to his left and seemed to never stop sailing until he landed on the ground with the ball between his arms. 
The half would end 0-0. 
St. John's played the Big East semifinal and final games with­out All-American defender Chris Wingert, who was playing on the 
U.S. Under-23 team in a pair of Olympic qualifying matches. 
St. John's reached the champi­onship game by beating Rutgers in penalty kicks, 4-3, after end­ing overtime in a 1-1 tie. Red Storm leading scorer Simone Salinno drilled home his penalty shot to ice it after back up goal­tender Guy Hertz made a diving save. It was the second match of the tournament decided on penalty kicks. The first came in a Providence upset win over No. 2 seed Virginia Tech in the quar­terfmals. 
Notes 
Notre Dame had eight play­ers named to an All-Big East team this season: 
All-Big East first team ­Justin Detter, F, senior; Jack Stewart, D, junior; Chris Sawyer, G, junior 
All Big East second team ­Kevin Goldthwaite, D. junior; Chad Riley, MID, senior 
All Big East third team -Greg Martin, MID, senior; Devon Prescod, F. senior; Kevin Richards, D, senior 
Goalkeeper of the year: Chris Sawyer, senior 
The team closest to Notre Dame is St. John's with six All­Big East players, including five first-team selections. 
Detter was named the most outstanding offensive performer of the Big East Tournament. Sawyer was namedmost out­standing defensive performer.

NO WOMEN'S SOCCER 
Loss does not take away from remarkable season 

Whether we like it or not, sometimes in life things are just not meant to be. This seemed to be the case for the women's soc­cer team in their game against 
Michig~n.  Andy  
Despitedominating  Troeger  
play through­out. the Irish  Sports Writer  
fell when  
Michigan was  

able to connect on their only·· 
shot on goal. The Irish valiantly 
tried to find the equalizer, but 
time after time were denied by 
the Michigan defense. 
Unlike the first game between the two teams. the Irish played reasonably well this weekend. Despite a continuous strain of injuries, the Irish dominated Loyola on Friday night. and cer­tainly played well enough to pick up the win on Sunday against Michigan. But it was not meant to be. 
"It's frustrating to me because we had some things lined up to make a good run at this," said Irish coach Handy Waldrum. "I thought we played well enough Friday and I thought we played well enough today. I felt like sta­tistically in every category we were all over them. It's not that we played poorly today, we just didn't finish our opportunities." 
Through it all. however. it was easy to see that this was not meant to be Notre Dame's day. The Michigan goal came on a play when Stephanie Chavez scored despite being surrounded by Notre Dame defenders. · Somehow the ball found the net. which was something the Irish were unable to accomplish. The ball bounced around the Michigan goal four or five times on the day, but each time the ball eventually bounced away. The lrL<>h and their fans also quickly became frustrated with the game referees, to the tune of five yellow cards, most of which came in the second half as the Irish tried to come back. 
It was an especially tough way to go out for the Irish seniors. Melissa Tancredi, who has a year of eligibility left due to an injury her freshman year, need­ed an IV in the morning just to play because of the flu. She came in for the second half only, playing forward for only the sec­ond time all sea;;on. Senior Amy Warner gave the Irish about twenty minutes of time in the second half, gutting it out despite a limp due to her sprained ankle. 
Despite the disappointing end, the loss does end what was another remarkable season for the program. After only finishing 13-8last season, the Irish domi­nated their way to an 18-0-1 start despite playing all season without preseason Big-East defensive player of the year Candace Chapman or midfielder Handi Scheller. The team defeat­ed perennial power Santa Clara at mid-season and shut out all nine Big East teams that they played over the course of the regular season. For much of the year the Irish were ranked in the top four in both goals scored and goals allowed. ranking right with North Carolina in both statistics. 
Waldrum made no excuses for the team after the game, despite being obviously frustrated con­sidering the effort given by his team. For the Irish this year, it just wasn't meant to be.

the game. but were never able to find the net. Freshman goal­keeper Megan Tuura managed to stymie the Irish for the sec­ond time this season, and the Irish were shut out for only the second time all season. 
"Beating them the first time was a huge confidence boost," said Michigan coach Debbie Hademacher. "We knew that we could come in not being hesitant and not be intimidated and just do the same thing we did before." 
For the Irish. the loss was especially disappointing because of the way the game was played and the missed opportunities that plagued the Irish during the game. 
"I'm disappointed for our kids," said Irish coach Handy Waldrum. "I hate to say it because this is twice that they've beaten us. but I thought we were the better team. If you're in this game long enough, some­times the ball kind of bounces that way. They jumped on their chance." 
Notre Dame had six shots on goal and Michigan only had one. and had eight corner kicks to only one for the Wolverines. 
"We had enough chances to win," Waldrum said. "We just didn't get it done." 
The team suffered from the injuries that have hampered them for the last few weeks. Starters Mary Boland, Amy Warner, Melissa Tancredi and Amanda Guertin all played fewer minutes than usual because of various injuries. 
"That's not the excuse," said Waldrum. "That's not the reason we lost." 
The game was very physical throughout. with the Irish being called for 20 fouls, including four yellow cards. The Irish seemed frustrated throughout as their chances slipped away. 

"They pack things in and play real ugly, ... said Waldrum of Michigan. "They're solid defen­sively, they've got a good goal­keeper and they are a tough team to break down. I wouldn't trade any of our players for what they have, but they're very organized." 
Despite missing many of their regular players. the Irish domi­nated play in the first half, but were unable to score. 
"We walked into halftime relieved," Hademacher said. "They put us under pressure and I thought we needed to do a little better defending out of our half." 
The Michigan goal came early in the second half, as they man­aged to force a corner kick six minutes in. Vince lofted the service into the box and Chavez was able to get the ball through and into the goal despite being surrounded by the Irish defense. 
"She got the same goal in the first game ofT the corner kick," Hademacher said. "We knew if we just had numbers in there and the ball was bouncing around that she could put it in the goal for us." 
The Irish and Wolverines got to the second round in different ways. The Irish blanked Loyola 5-0 as Jen Buczkowski scored two goals and Christie Shaner. Kim Carpenter and Jill Krivacek all added goals. Michigan escaped a few late challenges from Oakland to win 1-0. 
The Irish ended the season 20-3-1. Michigan moves on to the Sweet 16 next weekend.

"It was more of a defensive struggle than we expected," Heath said. "We would've thought the offense would've put up more points or at least moved the ball a little better." 
Badin grabbed the lead mid­way through the first half as Heath and Zachry took control on alternating plays in order to move the ball down the field. 
After strong defensive pres­sure knocked the ball away the first couple of times. Zachry finally connected in the end zone with wide receiver Laura Huarte on third-and-15. 

The first extra point was called back due to holding on the offense, but Heath was able to complete her pass to Jenn Carter on the second attempt. 
The Bullfrogs entered halftime up 7-0. happy to have put points on the board in the first half. 
As quarterback Erin Nasrallah scrambled for first downs and found open receivers, the Chicks seemed poised to make a come­back for the second game in a row. 
Lewis wide receiver Mimi Lundgren made the touchdown catch, but the Chicks failed to capitalize on the extra-point moments later. 
Lewis' efforts seemed to be too little, too late, as Badin held them on the Chicks' next drive as the clock was winding down. 
Badin credited its victory to the efl'orts and positive attitudes of everyone on the team, in addition to the great dorm sup­port they received and the expertise of their knowledgeable coaches. 
"We have really experienced, dedicated coaches. They were just as focused as we were on making it to the Stadium and winning," Wind said of defensive coach Anthony Pilcher and offensive coaches Kortney Hall and Dan Norton. 

Badin was happy to redeem themselves after losing a simi­larly close game to Lewis the first game of the season. 
"We wanted that rematch from the very beginning. We were very glad to have another shot at them," Heath said. 
"We proved we're a little dorm with a big heart," Wind said. 
Siegfried 13, Dillon 0 
Siegfried quarterback Bill Bingle had been here before -­a strong defensive opponent, emotions running high and a chance to win the interhall championship. The outcome was equally familiar to him. 
Siegfried won its second straight interhall championship with a convincing 13-0 shutout of top-seeded Dillon. 
Dillon's undefeated run this season came to a screeching halt as Siegfried's offense out­matched a resilient Dillon defense that had given up only 17 points all season. 

Siegfried's offense was lead by Bingle, who was 8-of-12 passing on the day with two touch­downs. A 35-yard touchdown reception by John Kaup and another touchdown catch by Marques Bolden gave Siegfried a quick 13-0 lead going into halftime after the Hamblers failed on an extra point. 
Both touchdowns were scored following costly Dillon turnovers. A fumble on a punt snap and another fumble on a rushing play gave Siegfried excellent field position inside Dillon territory. 
"We jumped on a few early turnovers by Dillon and were able to hold that momentum the rest of the game," Bingle said. 
The final blow came after Dillon mounted a 60-yard drive down the field only to come up empty after failing to score on four straight plays from Siegfried's 13-yard line. The drive took the entire length of the third quarter and put Dillon at the mercy of the clock the rest of the game. 
This was Siegfried's third straight appearance in the

championship game and their added experience dictated their attitude going into the game. 
His team's quarterback agreed, coming through in the clutch to help Siegfried repeat as champions. 
"We knew what to expect coming into the game and we had faith that our offense could get the job done," Bingle said. 
Even though Dillon had the higher playoff seed and Siegfried had the experience advantage, both teams matched each other in emotional intensi­ty. 
At halftime. a marshmallow war erupted between the Dillon fans while Siegfried fielded their own marching band. 
With a second interhall foot­ball championship title, Siegfried has lived up to the high expectations the team places on itself. 
"We want to establish a tradi­tion of Siegfried being dominant in interhall athletics," Torgenson said.

Guard Chris Thomas led all scorers with 26 points, including 6-of-14 shooting on 3-pointers. As a team, the Irish shot 14-of­28 from behind the arc. 
All of those long-range shots were necessary as the Illinois All-Starts were even hotter on their 3-pointers, shooting 15-of­27. 
"I thought we challenged a lot

INTERHALL fOOTBALL 

Badin upsets Lewis by one point 
Siegfried earns 2nd consecutive title 
By ANNIE BRUSKY Sports Writer 
All that separated the finest of women's interhall football Sunday afternoon was one extra-point conversion. 
A single point dashed Lewis' dreams of a championship, for many, four years in the making, as well as their hopes of an unblemished season. 
But, then again, a single point also propelled Badin into inter­hall history as the smallest girls dorm on campus took home their first football champi­onship with a 7-6 victory in the Notre Dame Stadium. 
"We're very excited. There aren't even words to describe "This was our first time in the it," said Steph Heath, one of Stadium and we were fortunate Badin's quarterbacks. enough to come out with a vic­
