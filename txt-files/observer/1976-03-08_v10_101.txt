Republican administration attacked

Humphrey elected, Bond VP 
by Jay Tldmarsh Staff Reporter 
On the final day of the 1976 Mock Democratic Convention,· the dele­gates heard Congressman John Brademas (D-Ind.) and Senator Patrick Leahey (D-Ver.) criticize the recent Republican administra­tions and call for the election of a Democratic president to work with the Democratic Congress. 
Bradcmas. delivering the key­note address at Saturday's session, opened his speech with a tribute to the late Prof. Paul Bartholomew. He then attacked the record of the recent Republican administrations. 
·'For too many years," he said, ''the American people has been afflicted by the Republican admin­istrations' mindless intervention abroad. economic recession at home, and tampering with the Constitution." He criticized the "no-no, not now, never-never veto policies of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford." 
Criticizes Ford Brademas singled out four spec­ific problems in the Ford adminis­

tration. First, despite his promise administration of attempting to left the American family with a cut a limitation to the arms race and for 
to be "candid and forthright," drag the United States into Angola in purchasing power."

Stating that he respected the selection of Sen. Hubert Humphrey as the convention's nominee, Brademas admitted that Sen. Birch Bayh was the candidate he had been supporting. 
Brademas, formerly a teacher at St. Mary's College, concluded with praise for the involvement of the Mock Convention delegates. He said the solution to the problem of student apathy is "more politics, not less; it is a more open-spirited public life.'' 
He encouraged delegates to "participate in campaigns of can­didates you support." 
"The high calling of we Demo­crats," Brademas said, "is to elect a president who holds the ideals of Congressman john Brademas and Senator Patrick Saturday afternoon. (Photo by Ch:-is Smith) the Declaration of Independence


Leahy addressed the Mock Democratic Conventi.;n 

by Phil Cackley Senior Staff Reporter 

Sen. Hubert Humphrey was the compromise choice of a weary and chaotic Mock Political Convention for the Presidential nomination early Saturday morning. 
Humphrey was nominated on the 

sixth ballot by a slim margin at close to 4:30a.m. Saturday. Julian Bond of Georgia was the Vice-Presiden­tial choice on the second ballot Saturday afternoon. 
A festive atmosphere dominated 

most  of  the  proceedings  Friday  
night  and  Saturday  morning  as  
over  700 delegates  listened  to  

nominating speeches and staged minor demonstrations for favorites among the IS-candidate field. 
But ~en the three hours of nominating speeches were finish­ed, the delegates became serious and got down to the business of choosing a nominee. Caucuses were held all night as state delegations plotted out their moves and determined their votes. 
Three major candidates stood out on the initial ballot: Gov. Jerry Brown of California, Congressman Morris Udall of Arizona, and former Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia. 
Other major candidates included Sen. Edward Kennedy Sargent Shriver. and favorite-son candi­dates Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Gov. Milton Shapp and Mayor Richard Daley. Over half of the 28 candidates receiving votes on the first ballot were favorite sons. 
Brown, a favorite-son candidate supported by the entire California delegation, showed unusual strength on the first ballot and continued to be a factor throughout the convnetion. But at no time was he even close to the nomination which required 381 votes of the 760 delegates. 
Udall and Carter at first polled less than 100 votes each but gained strength on succeeding ballots. Moynihan was supported by the New York delegation, Shapp by the Pennsylvania delegation and Daley by the Illinois delegatiOn, but none 
of the three polled large votes on 
any ballots past the third. 
Major national contenders for Democratic nomination, Gov. George Wallace and Sen. Henry Jackson, were never powerful forces in the balloting. Sen. Birch Bayh dropped out early. as did former Sen. Fred Harris and Ellen McCormick the pro-life candidate. Kennedy and Shriver dropped out after the third ballot. 
On the first four ballots Hum­phrey's vote tally never topped 50. As the convention appeared to be heading for a deadlock, however, his tally jumped from five on the fourth ballot to 298 on the fifth ballot. The senator from Minneso­ta was only five votes over the required 381 on the sixth ballot. 
California 'stubborn' 

The California delegation voted in a solid block, 68 votes, for Brown for five ballots before switching to Carter in a belated effort to stop Humphrey. Brown's support out­side of California was scattered and came from a number of states, but significantly there were no major blocks of votes for the California governor. 
The Brown supporters were re­portedly holding out until the tenth ballot, when they hoped their candidate would be the choice of a deadlocked conveilt'.nn. Several vice-presidential on~f/!1· from both the Udall and Carter camps were turned down, as Brown supporters believed he had a clear shot at the presidential nomination. 
An early "Stop Brown" move­ment formed, notably in the New York and Pennsylvania delega­tions. These two states voted for their favorite-son candidates on the first two ballots for the purpose of stopping Brown's momentum. 
As the evening wore on and the California delegation showed no signs of changing their vote, the rest of the delegates became anger­ed. At the Saturday afternoon session the California delegation was booed several times, and there was even a movement to unseat the delegation, although the resolution was never introduced or voted on. 
Udall close on fourth 

Udall picked up votes on the second ballot and rocketed into the lead on the third ballot on large blocks from New York, Pennsylva­nia and Ohio. On the fourth ballot· he was only 50 votes away from the nomination, but support vanished on the fifth ballot, with the tally going from 330 on the fourth to 147 on the fifth. 
Analysts credited Udall's demise to efforts by pro-life forces who were opposed to Udall's pro-abor­tion stance. There were also attempts to swing Brown votes to Carter to block Udall. On the sixth ballot Udall's tally fell to 36 votes. 
Carter polled large tallies on all six ballots, but never seriously (continued on page 7)

Hart complains of poor govt. leaders 
by Barbara Breitenstein Staff Reporter 
Warning that ''the people of this country are very confused and very angry," Senator Gary Hart (D-Colo.) challenged the public leadership to come "back to reality" in an address before the Mock Democratic Convention Friday night in Stepan Center. 
"We must.realize that the old answers aren't working any more," Hart explained .."The American dream ts a flawed and tarnished dream because it has been based on some false premises." 
Hart, who served as National Campaign Director for George McGovern in 1972, complained that as a result of these false assumptions the country is facing several problems including a lack of quality in leadership. 
"Our own government has come to be seen as the enemy of its own citizens," Hart said. "It has concentrated more and more power in itself." . _"T~e humble _members of society have a right to complain of the tnjusttces of thetr government," Hart continued, pounding his fist on the podium"and they are. They are complaining by their silence. 
They are turning their backs on political parties and their candidates by the millions.'' The Junior Senator from Colorado spoke before a full audience of 
· delegates _and a few outside visitors who responded with applause and cheenng to his attack of the "bureaucrats in government who preach only fear, hate, and division." 
Hart proposed an economic overhaul, redirection of national assets, eradication of health care costs, guaranteed jobs and massive conservation of the environment as some solutions to these problems. Speaking in a clear and strong voice, Hart stated that these issues "represent the greatest challenge of the age." 
After his fifteen-minute speech, the young Senator commented briefly on several topics in a press conference. He did not favor any presider_ttial candidate but stated that he thought the Democratic nominee\\(.ould be a "new face." 
Calling the United States a "merchant of death" Hart accused the government of being in ''the wrong business" with its policy of arms and grain sale. 
"It is wrong to base our economy on the production and sales of arms,'' he said. ''Ifwe must, we can stabilize Sadat or anybody else in another way. It is a moral question." 
Hart also stated that the abortion and gun-control issues are questions of morals. He explained that he personally would not have an abortion is he were a woman, but that abortion should be a matter of choice and should not be in the Constitution. Hart did

Morris Udall, D-Ariz., said Sunday that "his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination will be in trouble unless he wins the Wisconsin primary on April 6. His Washington headquarters announced he will not mount an active campaign in the March 23 North Carolina primary because of the Democratic National Committee's action restoring the April 6 Wisconsin primary to full delegate selection status.

"In tonight's competition there are no losers, only winners." This was the verdict of the distinguished panel of judges which presided this Saturday over the honary final . round of this year's Notre Dame Law School Moot Court competi­tion. 
The verdict was echoed by generous applause from the large crowd of spectators which packed the Library Auditorium. 
The panel of judges was compos­ed of the Honorable Tom C. Clark, retired associate Justice of the Supreme Court; Honorable Thomas Fairchild, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals; and Honorable Edward F. Henessey, chief judge of the Massachusetts Superior Court. 
Saturday's competition was the end product of year long competi­tion in which the members of Notre Dame's team tested their skill against the skill, imagination, and industry of othr law school teams throughout the nation. 
Over 200 teams competed in thi5 legal free-for-all which climaxed a: the National moot Court Finals he)( in New York City. The Notre DamE Team finished among the top fom teams in the country at thh competition.

advocacy program conducted dur­ing the second year of law school. Saturday's contestants were the best appellate advocates of the Notre Dame Moot Court Team. 
The case which this team presen­ted to the Moot Court invovled an alleged agreement between banks to buy a certain type of automated banking machine activating card which has foreclosed the petitioner from the automatic teller machine market in the state of Pacific. The Petitioner has brought the action under the Anti-Trust Laws. 
Counselors for the Petitioner were Kevin Gallagher of Illinois and June Gottschalk of Ohio. Counselors for the Respondents were Dennis Bronucchi of Michi­gan and Kathleen Comfrey of Massachusetts. 
First to be heard by the judges were the counselors for the Peti­tioner. Largely through. responses to questions from the bench the counselors attempted to argue that their client had been eliminated from an area of competition in the state of Pacific. They further argued that this was the result of a conspiracy perpetrated bv the Re­spondent which was in violation of the Anti-Trust Laws. 
After the Counselors for the petitioner had finished their pre­sentation the judges completed the competition with the questioning of the Counselors for the Respon dent. These counselors argued also pirmarily through responses to questions from the bench. 
They claimed that those actions of the Respondent which could be proven to be conspiratuoils were portected by law. They further argued that all subsequent actions by the Respondent were the result of prudent business decisions and not an' effort to eliminate the Petitioner from competition. 
The judges placed heavy demands upon the knowledge and composure of the participants throughout· the proceedings. But these demands were exceeded in many ways by the praise and respect which were accorded to the counselors by the court in its

Sen. Proxmire says nation can meet challenge 
by Pat Hanifin Editorial Editor 
''The theme of this conference is whether the American people are an 'almost chosen people' able to live up to their moral aspirations," Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wise.) said in his keynote address to the University Bicentennial Conference which he delivered at the opening 
ceremony  yesterday  afternoon  in  
the  Athletic  and  Convocation  
Center.  

Speaking to a crowd of several hundred in the basketball arena Proxmire discussed the problems and achievements of America and the challenges it will have to face in the future. He affirmed his belief that despite its failings, the nation does have "the vitality to meet the challenges it must face at home and abroad." 
National problems 
Among the problems of the nation which Proxmire mentioned were high unemployment and infla­tion, an overgrown and wasteful government, and the lingering ill-l'ffccts of Vietnam and Water­gate. 
a '"-'" '-' '-"J. '-' .3\.. V 11;.11 UUUlVU rt.lll"-'1. 
icans who want to work but cannot find a job," Proxmire said. He pointed out that this burden is distributed unequally, falling most heavily on blacks, young people and women. "It is a cruel fate to be out of work in the land of the work ethic," he commented. 
The effects of unemployment are worsened by the effects of inflation which has been corroding the buying power of the dollar for the last 20 to 25 years, Proxmite stated. ''This is a major change from the past when inflation usually coin­cided with wars and disappeared in peacetime." 
Proxmire, who has gained a reputation in the Senate as a strong opponent of waste in government, particularly in the Pentagon, heav­ily criticized the bigness and waste­fulness of today's government. "The founders feared the potential domination of big government but we have let it arise in the United States." As an instance of waste in the military Proxmire pointed out that there are now more generals and admirals than there were during World War II, despite the fact that there are only one-sixth the number of troops. 
Golden Fleece Award 
As further instances of waste he recounted some of the boondoggles that won, various government departments the not-so-coveted "Golden Fleece Award", a prize that Proxmire's office gives each month to the perpetrators 9f a particularly wasteful operation. 
"We have given it to the National Science Foundation for spending $84,000 on a study of why people fall in love. Even if they were to find out why I .wouldn't want to know--1 like the mystery." The NSF also won the award for a $500,000 study of why monkeys clench their jaws (answer: they are angry). Other winners include the FAA, the Air Force and the Navy (which spent $500,000 refurbishing the new Vice Presidential resi­dence). 
The nation has moral failings and scars as well, Proxmire claimed, citing the after effects of Vietnam and Watergate as well as the current scandals about the CIA, corporate bribery, and the large American arms trade with foreign nations. 
But Proxmire argued that Amer­ica's failings are more than 


Dems criticize Republicans 
(continued from page 1) high." Leahey then addressed the Con­vention, criticizing the Ford admin istration, and explaining his pro­posal to eliminate wasteful spend­ing in the federal government. Leahey criticized the Ford ad­ministration on several points in­cluding the "amazing double stan­dard of justice" that allows for the pardon of Richard Nixon and the administration's effort to involve the United States in Angola. On the economic front, Leahey criticized the administration for 
fostering an attitude in which "we find cheers when unemployment is only 7.6 percent." 
Government bureaucracy 
The federal government, accord­ing to Leahey. has become an unwicldly bureaucracy with many useless and costly programs.

Leahey said that both Democrats and Republicans have been guilty of instituting programs and then of forgetting to destroy them when they become ineffective. This, he said, allows for needless govern­ment expenditures. 
Leahey called for a ''trigger mechanism that automatically destroys a program if it is not working." Leahey stressed that he did not want to ban the creation of new government agencies, but he did want to "insure that programs go out of business when they are no longer needed." 
In order to implement his idea, Leahey urged the addition of a platform plank which guarantees 
100 

Center 
that "no program should exist for more than four years without being reevaluated and repassed by Con­gress." 
After citing numerous examples of wasteful spending in the Ford administration, Leahey said that "voters should not regard Demo­crats as bureaucrats." 
"We are the one party diverse enough to eliminate the problems of bureaucracy, he said. 
Leahey ended with a plea for the election of a Democratic President in November. "Since we have a Democratic Congress," he ex­plained, "the only way to insure my proposal is with a Democratic 
president."

matched by her achievements. "There has been progress -­including moral progress --in recent years," he announced, "though much of the good goes unreported in the media because 
only the bad things are 'news."' 
In material terms America has madca considerable progress ac­cording to Proxmire. "Even after figuring in taxes and inflation the personal income of the average American is double what it was in 1950. Social security, unemploy­ment compensation and welfare proviqe more security for the elderly and unemployed than they could ever expect in the past.:' 
He gave special stress to the progress in education, which he held to be crucial for both material

rom your fast friend in South Bend. 
Some people who fly West for vacation break never get on a plane until they reach Chicago. They don't realize they can save time. trouble. even money by flying the friendly skies from South Bend, instead of traveling by bus or car to O'Hare. 
For example, one-way Coach airfare from South Bend to Los Angeles may cost $5.00 more than the same ticket from Chicago. But there's no way you can get to O'Hare for less

money. or in a shorter time, or with less hassle. So flying United from South Bend is actually cheaper, quicker. and easier than rolling down the toll road.

(continued from page 1) equality of minority groups. "We haven't achieved our goals fully but we have developed the legal mechanisms we need to do so.-" The social status of women has also begun to improve, with more women than ever before receiving an advanced education. However, he stressed that there is still a long way to go, especially in giving women their proper role in the upper reaches of government and business. 
The Senator noted recent prog­ress in protecting the environment with new legislation. "For the first time the amount of air pollution went down last year compared to the previous year." 
Agriculture is one of the great American success stories according to Proxmirc. He noted that Amer­ican farms arc ten times more productive than their Soviet l'Ountcrparts and that only 4.5 percent of the American people feed hundreds of millions around the world. 
He claimed that American for­eign policy was improving since Congress has refused to go along with Presidential demands for in­
volvemcnt in Cambodia and An­gola. Watergate also indicated the strengths of American institutions 
in  resisting  the  excesses  of  the  
President.  
American  technology has given  

the American people a better life than ever but has also made life more dangerous by the possibility of its misuse. He recalled President Kennedy's remark that man now has the power to "make this the best generation of mankind in history or the last." 
But Proxmire affirmed his confi­dence that Americans are a "little kinder, more respectful people than before. And if we can avoid a nuclear holocaust we will be better still in another hundred years.'' 
Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, Univer­sity President, commented after the ceremony that Proxmire gave "a fairly good talk," and that the affair as a whole was "well­conceived and well carried out." He remarked that he would like to see the Conference as a whole produce "more consciousness of the history and heart of the country, of its beginnings and of the road ahead which still must be travelled to achieve the promises of 
the Declaration and Constitution." 
He added that, "we still have a 
long way to go." 
Dr. John Duggin, president of St. Mary's, introduced Proxmire, remarking that he had set a Senate record by being present for over 4,000 consecutive roll-call votes. 
The crowd at the opening· cere­mony was also addressed briefly by Hesburgh. "Patriotism is not just tlagwaving, bands, and marching off to war," he commented. It is also the quieter patriotism of an "almost chosen people who try to make the promises of the Declara­tion of Independence real and true 
in our time." Hesburgh stressed the concept of "practical patriotism": recogniz­ing the equal dignity of men in the way we treat them. "If the Bicen­tennial resulted in an increase in this practical patriotism it would be entirely worthwhile." Dr. Thomas Bergin, co-chairman of the University festival­conference opened the ceremony with a "Call to Celebration." "The Bicentennial offers us a chance to explore American spiritual devel­opment, examing the tension 

between goals and achievements," he said. 
Mrs. Dan D. Stiver, executive chairman of the South Bend Bicen­tennial Committee, also spoke, welcoming Proxmire in the name of South Bend and commenting on the Conference's links with the nation­al Bicentennial themes of "Festi­val, Heritage and Horizons."  
Besides the speeches the cere­mony featured a series of inter­mixed musical selections and read­ings designed to bring out the themes  of moral aspirations, achievements, and failings.

The tutorial staff of the clinic consists of 11 juniors and seniors, recommended as good writers and sympathetic human beings by members of the English depart­ment. These tutors were trained in composition, grammar, and the diagnosis and treatment of writing problems over the summer. Each tutor had the option of working for a salary or for two credits in a cross-listed English-Education course. Six chose to be paid, while the other five are working for the two credits. 
To insure efective communica­tion between tutors, Sue Laughlin, student coordinator, handles all publicity, internal problems and scheduling. Bi-weekly staff meet­ings cover general problems and progress. 
The Writing Clinic has proved to be a relatively inexpensive pro­gram. Its budget, under experi­mental programs, pays six tutors on the regular college pay scale of $1.85 per hour; the faculty coordin­ator at one course equivalency; and maintains a library of workbooks and grammar texts, both practical and theoretical treatments of vari­ous aspects of the writing process.

the top. At this point, the convention moved to Humphrey as a compromise candidate. 
Michigan was the first delega­tion to throw heavy support behind Humphrey, casting all 33 votes for the 1968 Democratic nominee. After this initial move, votes came flooding in from tired delegates who saw in Humphrey a candidate who could win and end the ballot-ing. 
The immense support that Hum­phrey received after having been a non-existent candidate for the en­tire night was a clear indication to most observers of how tired the delegates were.

Many delegates were unsatisfied with Humphrey and when his nomination became certain, voted for favorite son candidates as a means of protest. Pope Paul received two votes from Oregon, although his nomination was illegal because he is not a native-born American citizen. 
Guam started a movement to elect Mandello the Fighting Chicken, a favorite son candidate. Mandello polled only four votes for the presidential nomination but made a strong showing on Saturday for the vice-presidential spot. 
Delegates showed their discon­tent with Humphrey Saturday by abstaining in the vice-presidential vote. There were also a number of

Hart, who is now serving on the Senate committee to investigate intelligence activities, began his speech with a few jokes about the committee's attempts to receive testimony from former-president Nixon. "When he finally respond­ed to our questions, his answers were in hinese,'' Hart said. 
The audience also laughed and applauded Hart's description of a bowl of Nixon's memoirs. "The only problem,'' he explained, ''was that eighteen pages were miss­ing." 
Hart received a standing ovation at the conclusion of his speech, in which he called for the "courage of the American people." 
"Above all," Hart concluded, "we must use the occasion of the bicentennial to fight to re-establish the American character. The events of this time are important to the future of the country," he said. "we must draw again from the courage of the American people for leadership."

Imagine an order of 22,000 priests and brothers In 73 countries around the World. (That's a pretty big family.) 
But that's what the Salesians of St. John Bosco are all about -a large family of community-minded men dedicated to the service of youth. (And no one gets lost.) 
In the 1800's a chance meeting between a poor priest and a street urchin served to create a movement of such success that it is still growing today. Don Bosco became the priest who brought youth back from the streets-and back to God. 
He reasoned that a program of play, learn and pray would make useful citizens of the world. He crowded out evil with reason, religion and kindness In a (what was then unheard of) atmosphere of family spirit. 
The ideals of St. John Bosco are still with us today. His work goes on in boys c!ubs, technical and academic schools, guidance centers, summer camps and missions. And his very human approach is very evident in the family spirit of the Salesians. This is the way he wanted it. This is the way it is. The Salesian experience isn't learned-it's lived.
