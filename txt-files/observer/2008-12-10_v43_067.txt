Five student interns to teach for ACE 
Seniqrs committed to program after graduation express passion for Catholic education 
By NORA KENNEY News Writer 
This year, the Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE) program is working with five student interns who have all committed to teach for ACE after graduation. Each of the students expressed a love for the work they are doi'ng with ACE, and seemed excited to extend their internship into teaching jobs in new locations next year. 
Senior Laura Wilczek, a resident advisor from Howard Hall is one such stu­dent. She is majoring ·in 
English with a minor in Education, Schooling and Society and hopes to teach English in Seoul after she finishes her work with ACE. 
Wilczek hadn't attended a Catholic school until high school. When she started attending a Catholic school though, she said she began to feel passionate about her faith. 
She said she thinks her teachers at her Catholic high school taught from a differ­ent perspective than those she had encountered in pub­lic schools because they viewed their students as children of God rather than 
numbers. 

"Essentially, what I am trying to convey is my own positive experience at a Catholic school, and the belief I have in the Catholic school system is really why I want to dedicate my future to teaching at a Catholic school," \Vilcze.k said. 
Not only will Wilczek be using the education she received at Notre Dame to serve a cause she believes in, but she also thinks her work will bolster her educa­tion in ways that would not have been possible just through learning in a college classroom. 

"I know that working in the ACE program I will not only be the teacher but the student as well sometimes," she said. 
Kevin Veselik is a former resident of Zahm who now lives off-campus. Like Wilczek, he is passionate apout Catholic education. 
"Catholic schools are so important to our Church and our world, and ACE offers ·an opportunity to bring some energy and life to · schools that might need it," 
he said. Veselik is a member of

Kristol speaks onnew era of American politics 
By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistan News Editor 
Founding editor of the conservative periodical "The Weekly Standard" William Kristol said President-elect Barack Obama's leadership, if deemed successful by the American people, could lead to a new era in American politics in a lecture Tuesday at the Hesburgh Center for International Studies. 
Kristol's speech entitled "American Politics: A New Era?" assessed the current political situation and pre­dicted where Obama's lead­ership would take the coun­try in the future. 
Kristol, who is also a regu­lar contributor to Fox News and the editorial page of the "New York Times," said the November election results were "not so surprising" due to a war in Iraq "judged by a majority of Americans as a mistake" and the current economic crisis. 
"In some sense, you could argue it was no big sur­prise," he said. 
Kristol said the results, however, did not demon­strate an ideological shift for the country.

NDSPsays 
thefts rise with finals 
Stress contributes to student property loss 
By KARA COYLE News Wrirer 
Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP) said there is an increase in thefts before student<; go on break. 
Students' stress levels generally increase at this time and they are less prone to pay attention to their belongings, Keri Kei Shibata, an NDSP officer said. 
"The bad guys in town know that students at this time are dis­tracted," she said. "Keep an eye on your property and make sure you are keeping it with you." 
Shibata discussed the different safety measures that students should be aware of during Christmas vacation at a Winter Break Safety Forwn sponsored by Student Government on Tuesday. 
The University is offering a prop­erty storage facility for off-campus students in Hammes-Mowbray Hall, a winter vehicle storage unit and a bike storage unit. 
"These are simple things that anyone can do that won't take a lot of time," she said. "Be prepared. Do the little things." 
Shibata also advised students to register their property. This enables police officers to recover student's property and return it with greater ease. 
Her main concern, however, is for student's personal safety.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Off-campus discounts proposed 
ByJOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
The Council of Representatives (COR) discussed the ordering and distribution discount booklets for off-cam­pus eateries for students at their meeting Tuesday. The booklets are expected to be available in early January. 
An off-campus company will produce the cards and sell them to student government. Student government will then resell the books to students for $10. 
The booklets will contain pop­ular re~taurants including Buffalo Wild Wings, Domino's, Papa John's, Chik-fil-A, Studebagels, Nick's Patio, Krispy Kreme, Taco Bell, Star of India and Tippecanoe Place.

T-shirts raise awareness for gender problems 
By SARAH MERVOSH News Writer 

In an effort to raise aware­ness about sexual assault, Student Government's Gender Issues Committee handed out T-shirts to be worn today by 1,000 Notre Dame students. 
Gt'nder Issues paired the dis­tribution of T-shirts with their attempt to pass a resolution to review the University's sexual assault and rape policy, Gender Issues co-chairman and junior Patrick Tighe said. 
The T-shirts, which are teal for the color of sexual assault awareness month, list the fact that one in four women are survivors of attempted sexual assault or rape, Tighe said. 
The committee found the one in four statistic in multiple sources including duLac and the U.S. Department of Justice, he said. 
"That's why we are getting a thousand T-shirts -because there are roughly 4,000 under­graduate women here at Notre Dame," said Gender Issues co­chairman Lauren Cummings. 
"Just take the number of girls that you know and divide that by four," she said. "It's really an alarming number." 
The T-shirts are free to stu­dents who signed up to wear one, and were paid for by the Gender Issues committee. Each dorm had a sign-up sheet for the T-shirts and the committee targeted specific interest groups to wear them, Cummings said.

INSIDE CoLUMN 
Non-sequiturs for finals 
I am currently sitting in the library, "working on" the second of four papers I have due this week. Thus, the chance that I will put together a cohesive 40() words for you people is equivalent to the chance that anyone will be running through Stonehenge after the Hawaii Bowl. 
Tricked you-that wasn't a Laura Myers 
prediction that we'll lose, but a fact because no one Sports Writer 
will be on campus! Of course, we prob­ably are going to lose. A college football team can't win without emotion, and we don't have any. (Bulletin board?) 
Anyway, I have spent long hours in the 'Burgh, as I fondly refer to this lovely building, and have had some meandering thoughts that I've decided to share with you. 
+My roommate officially got together with her boyfriend over Thanksgiving. (They are now "in a relationship" on Facebook-what's more official than that?) That's great for her and all, but if she had waited a month that would be one less Christmas present she has to buy. 
+I hate movies in which a character says "There's a storm coming," and then it starts raining and something bad happens, like someone dying or someone getting attacked by Voldemort. I mean, seriously, did the writer pop out his "Symbolism 101" book and throw that in there? Did he also add some blue so it would be sad and some red to show anger? 
+Every time I fear that I'll never get married, I head to North Dining Hall. I firmly believe that no one who makes an omelette as well as I do will stay sin­gle 'forever. I think that's sexist. 
+My bottle of apple juice says it con­tains apple juice concentrate from eight different countries on four different continents. I guess Australian apples just aren't good enough for Minute. Maid. 
+My best friend bought her dad an iPod Nano for Christmas, and a pair of running shoes from Dick's. I bought my dad a Notre Dame napkin holder from a craft show for $10. I think I should feel bad about that. Of course, I work at the Observer for roughly $12 a week while pursuing my Arts and Letters degree, and my friend works full time as a wait­ress while studying to become a chemi­cal engineer. 
+Shoot, my dad's probably going to read this. 
+My eyes are three different colors at all times. It makes me wonder what I'm going to pass on to mychildren. Is · there a freak-of-nature gene? Is it dom­inant? 
+Apparently, bananas lose their nutritional value when refrigerated. However, they do not regain said nutri­ents if allowed to return to room tem­perature. 
+ Wiccans -Witchcraft -Feminism -The United States -George W. Bush. Five steps! Beat that!

"The Jollost important thing I can say is to always be alert of your surroundings," she said. 
Patlick Hechlinski, a crime pre­vention specialist for the South Bend Police Department, also spoke about what precautions off­campus students can do to stay alert. 
Hechlinski advised students to always report a crime, even if it's minor. 
"If you are a victim of a crime, be sure to report it," he said. Doing so enables the police department to be more aware of areas where extra security is needed. 
Hechlinski also recommended that students be aware of automo­bile and advi~ed that anything of value, such as iPods and phone chargers be removed from cars. 
"Put yourself in the shoes of the bali guys;" he said. If the object is of value and visible in a car, there is a higher rate oflarceny. 
Hechlinski also stressed the importance of being alert and proactive about safety. 
"Very importantly, even if you are at home, keep your doors locked," he said. 
He said students should be alert even when putting trash in out­door trashcans. Putting a televi­sion box in a visable waste con­tainer indicates that there are items of value within the house, he said. 
The South Bend Police Department also offers two free programs to increase safety,

Like many of the other interns, Julie Garcia, a for­mer resident of Lewis who now lives off-campus, has been involved with tutoring programs and service proj,. ects on campus and around South Ben.d throughout her career at Notre Dame. She is majoring in African Studies with a minor in gen­der studies. She expressed an excitement for her work that started when she dropped engineering as a freshman and came to the realization that she had always wanted to teach. She says she has "seen how great an impact one good mentor can make on a child's life, and I'd love to be able to do that for a liv­ing," and she also appreci­ates the communal lifestyle fostered by the ACE pro­gram. " 
Garcia's advice for stu­dents interested in the ACE program is to stop by the ACE office and express interest. 
"They are so friendly and love getting to know who you are, even if you don't have any specific ques­tions," she said. "Ask previ­ous ACErs for advice, too. They can really tell you what it will be like. It's never too early to get a foot in the door."

Hechlinski said. The Student Watch Program is an alert system made exclusively for Notre Dame students. Through it, students are alerted via e-mail about any crime that can affect .tlJem within the area. The South Bend Police Department also offers free home security surveys where security recommendations are made for off campus homes. 
Dominic Zultanski, a represen­tative from Gargoyle Preferred Investigative Services, discussed crime on the Northea~t side of the city specifically. 
He advised that students place everything of value in a room with closed blinds so that it is out of sight while the house is empty over Christmas break.

signed up to wear the T-shirts, and both Tighe and Cummings said there was a significant response from the male dorms to wear them. 
"I think it's going to say a lot to women that men are taking a stand and we're saying that we don't want to let this happen," said Tighe, who added that men commit 90 to 95 percent of all rapes. "We're the ones that are perpetrating it and we're not going to let it happen again." 
Tighe said men don't intend to be rapists, and emphasized that not all men are rapists, but that it is important to be aware of what defines rape and sexual assault, and to be aware of what it takes to avoid commit­ting it. 
In order to avoid it, men need to change their habits, "espe­cially our drinking habits, the way we party, the way we view women. We really have to start changing our habits," he said. 
Tighe sees the men who choose to wear the shirt as "a sign of solidarity and a sign of accountability." 
"[A man wearing the shirt is saying,] 'I'm wearing this shirt and you can hold me account­able and I will hold other men accountable,"' Tighe said. 
The resolution that Gender Issues committee hopes to pass tonight will revise rape and sexual assault policies in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the policies and strengthen resources for victims. The reso­lution cites that of more than 3,000 students surveyed, 61 percent listed sexual assault/rape as one of their top three issues and 18 percent list it as their top issue.

liberal," he said. 

Kristol said arguments could be made "that [the Republican Party] really stepped back not a great deal, or you could say this was the end of an era." 
Kristol called Obama "the first liberal Democrat to be elected in modern times," and cited the fact that ·the preisdent-elect is the first Democrat since 1964 to receive more than 51 per­cent of the popular vote. 
He also said Republicans would have to face being the minority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate after backlash against the Bush adminis­tration both in 2006 and 2008 resulted in a Democraticaliy-contro lied Congress. 
"This is two elections in a row where a comfortable majority has voted Democrat," he said. "It could be the beginning of a new era." 
Kristol said furthermore it is highly unlikely that the Republican Party would be able to retake Congress in 2010. 
"Obama has at least four years with a Democratic Congress," he said. 
However, Kristol said the future would mostly depend on "how Obama governs." He cited the example of Franklin RooseveIt beating Herbert Hoover in the midst of the Great Depression, comparing it to how Obama is taking over for President George W. Bush in the midst of the current recession. 
Any Democrat would have beaten Hoover, Kristol said, but Hoosevelt was able to govern successfully and thus changed American politics. 
"Obama has to change American politics if he gov­erns successfully," he said. 
Kristol said Obama is lucky to take over in the middle of a recession, because strategically he cannot receive any blame for having caused the crisis. 
"Objectively, honestly, he has a very good hand to play," Kristol said. 
Instead. many Americans ~ill blame Bush and the 
Republican leadership in Congress, which Kristol said would damage the public perception that Republicans know how to run the econo­my. 
"Voters right now think this is a problem that hap­pened ... due to Republican negligence," he said.  
Kristol said after Bush's victory over Sen. John Kerry in 2004, the Republican Party re.ached its "high water mark." 
Bush's failure to deliver on his campaign promises of Social Security privatization and immigration reform, as well as the unpopularity of the Iraq War and the gross mismanagement of the Hurricane Katrina disaster, led to Democratic victories in the past two elections, Kristol said. 
"The voters punished Bush and the Republican Congress in 2006," he said. "At the end of the day, this happened during the Bush administration." -
Kristol said Obama's biggest challenges lie in for­eign policy, particularly when it comes to controlling nuclear proliferation in Iran and ending the Iraq War. 
Kristol cautioned it is often hard to predict what will happen in the future, and any failure by Obama could result in the Republicans regaining con­trol. 
"It's amazing how quickly things can reverse," he said.

Greeks still rioting over shooting 
!\THEN -Masked youths and looters marauded through (ireek cities for a fourth night Tuesday, in an explosion of rage trig­gered by the police shooting of a teenager that has unleashed the most violent riots in a quar­ter century. 
The nightly scenes of burning street barri­cades, looted stores and overturned ears have threatened to topple the country's increasingly unpopular conservative government, which faces mounting calls for Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis to resign. 
Police fired tear gas at protesters following the funeral of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos, who was laid to rest in an Athens burial attended by about 6,000 people. 
Reactions to Mugabe worsen

U.S. President George W. Bush, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nieolas Sarkozy have called in the last week for Zimbabwe's 84-year-old leader to go. 
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter told National Public Radio that humanitarian condi­tions are "horrifying" in the southern African country, and that "the Mugabe government is so corrupt" only material goods -not cash ­should be sent to help the country's people, according to an interview posted Tuesday on NPR's Web site.

The alleged plot wac.; uncovered after the father reported the three weapons missing, prompting a police investigation that led to an attempted mur­der charge filed Tuesday against his son. 
The Pottstown High School freshman was being held in a secure facility, Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman told The Ao;;sociated Press. He does not yet have a lawyer, and no court dates are sclwduled, she said. 
Palin's office receives white powder 
JUNEAU -A spokeswoman for Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin says a letter containing a suspi­cious white powder was intercepted in the state capital of Juneau. 
Palin spokeswoman Sharon Leighow says the letter was addressed to Palin's predeces­sor, Gov. Frank Murkowski. 
Similar suspicious mailings were addressed to seven other governors this week. 
Leighow says the letter received in Juneau had a Texas postmark, but couldn't say whether it came from Dallas, as the other let­ters did. 
An FBI spokesman in Alaska says the pow­der is being tested. 
Letters containing white powder have also been sent this week to governors' offices in Alabama, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana and Hhode Island. 
In those sev(m cases, tests showed the pow­der wasn't dangerous.

Obama faces Blagojevich scandal 
President-elect claims he had no contact with Illinois governor concerning open senate seat

WASHINGTON -Though 
Barack Obama isn't accused 
of anything, the charges 
against his home-state gov­
ernor concerning 
Obama's own Senate seat

ultimate fallout is unclear. 
As Obama works to set up his new administration and deal with a national eco­nomic crisis, suddenly he also is spending time and attention trying to distance himself from Illinois Gov. Hod Blagojcvich and charges that the governor was trying to sell the now­vacant Senate post. 
The president-elect was blunt and brief in address­ing the case on Tuesday: "I had no contact with the governor or his office, and so I was not aware of what was happening" concerning any possible dealing about Blagojevich's appointment of a successor. 
It's Obama's first big headache since his election last month, and Republicans were anything but eager to let it go away.

IN BRIEF 
Car Czar is possible figure in bailout 
WASHINGTON {AP) -Detroit's automakers may soon be answering to a powerful "car czar," who would dole out short-term emergency loans like a kid's allowance, put them on a restructur­ing diet and hold veto power over any transac­tion of more than $100 million. 
An overseer for the auto industry was a central part of an agreement in principle reached late Tuesday to provide $15 billion in government loans to the companies. Congressional aides and a senior administration oflicial said the car czar would be named by President George W. Bush and tasked with overhauling the auto industry. 

Negotiators reached a compromise to require the czar to revoke the loans and deny any fur­ther federal aid to automakers that failed to wring concessions from labor unions, creditors and others to ensure their survival by next ' spring -essentially pushing them into bank­ruptcy. 
"If they don't meet the conditions of restructur­ing, there is not going to be an endless flow of money to this industry," warned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., before the conceptual agreement was reaehed. 
North Korea and nuclear envoys meet 
BEIJING -Envoys to talks on North Korea's nuclear program began a third day of meetings Wednesday to hammer out details of a proposal on verifying the eountry's accounting of its past atomic activities, a major step in the disarma­ment process. 
Host China distributed a draft-agreement to teams from the five other countries involved in the talks-Japan, North Korea, South Korea, the United States and Russia -and delegates were to go over the details in meetings, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said. 
"If we can get through this, this would be an important milestone on that road but with the understanding that we have a long way to go," Hill told reporters.

Sony to cut 4°/o of work force 
Japanese company takes steps to brace itself in the face ofrecessing world economy 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -The words on the recording sound as if they were uttered by a mob boss. Instead, the feds say, it is the governor of Illinois speaking. 
"I've got this thing and it's [expletive] golden, and I'm just not giving it up for [expletive] nothing. I'm not gonna do it," Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich says in a conversation intercept­ed by the FBI. 
Federal prosecutors Tuesday accused the 51-year-oldJ Blagojevich of scheming to enrich himself by selling Barack Obama's vacant Senate seat for
I cash or a lucrative job for him­self. In excerpts released by prosecutors, Blagojevich snarls profanities, makes threats and demands and allegedly concocts a rich variety of schemes for 
profiting from his appointment of a new senator. 
"I want to make money," he declares, according to court papers. Blagojevich allegedly had a salary in mind: $250,000 to $300,00 a year. (He earns $177,412 a year.) 
Even in this city inured to political chicanery -three other governors have been convicted in the past 35 years and numer­ous officeholders from Chicago have gone to prison for graft -· the latest charges were stun­
ning. And not just for the vulgar­ity, but for the naked greed, the recklessness and the self-delu­sion tlwy suggest. 
What is mystifying is why Blagojevich spoke so openly and so brazenly. lie knew the feds were looking into his adminis­tration for the past three years for alleged hiring fraud; one of his top fundraisers has been convicted, another is awaiting trial. lie even warned some associates not to use the phone because "everybody's listening ... You hear me?" 
Blagojevich also is no neo­phyte. lie was baptized in the nitty gritty of Chicago Machine politics and confirmed in back­room bargaining and big money deals. He spent years climbing the ladder, first as a state repre­sentative, then a congressman and finally governor. He was boosted to power by his father­in-law, Alderman Dick Mell, a veteran Democratic ward boss and longtime stalwart of the once mighty Machine. 

And yet, in conversations recorded from late October to last week, Blagojevich seemed almost oblivious as he vented his frustrations about being "stuck" as governor, complained of "struggling" financially, and allegedly talked of using the Senate appointment to land a lucrative job in the private sec­tor, or even an ambassadorship or a Cabinet post. 
"It's about greed," said Don Rose, a longtime political strate­gist in Chicago. "He's got to be completely off his rocker to be talking like that at a time when he knows the feds are looking at him.... He's out there like he's talking to his wife in bed." 
He added: "I think this is beyond ordinary sanity. We're talking about something clinical here. This is beyond logic. It's beyond greed as we know it." 
He also scoffed at the notion that Blagojevich had any chance of obtaining a post in Obama's Cabinet. 
"I consider myself a student of corruption, but I've never heard of this kind of thing going on," Rose said. "The way he's talking about it is lunacy.... 'Maybe they'll make me secretary of health and human services.' Who's going to hire this guy?" 
Paul Green, a political scientist at Roosevelt University, said: "If you're under so much scrutiny by an unbelievably dedicated 
U.S. attorney's oflice, why would you risk it all? This is a case less about politics and more about social psychology.... A hard­nosed Illinois politician wouldn't even dream ol' doing this, con­sidering the situation." 
One of the most intriguing aspects of the story was that Blagojevich was elected as Mr. Clean, promising to clean up state government. His predeces­sor, Republican Gov. George Ryan. is behind bars for graft. 
Blagojevich "had everything going for him," Green said. "He could have been the Serbian Obama. lie was young, hand­some, articulate." 
In court papers, prosecutors said Blagojevich also tried to strong-arm political contribu­tions in exchange for jobs and contracts, and tried to use his authority to get editorial writers from the Chicago Tribune who criticized him fired. 

He also discussed getting his wife, Patti, who has been in the real estate business, on corpo­rate boards where she could earn up to $150,000 a year. 
Some of the most shocking conversations came in the days before and after Obama's victo­ry, when Blagojevich seemed intent on capitalizing on his role in choosing the president-elect's successor in the Senate. 
According to court papers, on Nov. 3, the day before the elec­tion, Blagojevich talked with someone identified only as Deputy Governor A about the Senate seat, and said: "If ... they're not going to offer any­thing of any value, then I might just take it" -that is, make himself senator. 
That same day, he talked tough, and said he intended to "drive a hard bargain." 
Later, he noted the seat is a "[expletive] valuable thing, you just don't give it away for noth­ing." 
On Election Day, as crowds were gathering in Grant Park to celebrate Obama's victory, 
Former housing chiefs questioned 
Blagojevich spoke with John Harris, his chief of staff, who also has been charged in the case. The governor likened him­self to a sports agent shopping a free agent to teams, and said, "How much arc you offering, [president-elect]?" 
Days later, according to the documents, Blagojevich said he was willing to "trade" that Senate seat for the position of the secretary of health and human Services in Obama's Cabinet. There is no indication that Obama ever considered him.

ATTENTION: DON'T MISS OUT: DIRTY SEXY MONEY 
Associated Press 
TOKYO -Sony Corp. is slashing 4 percent of its worldwide work force, reining in spending and shutting plants as it tries to ride out a looming worldwide recession that is battering Japan's export-reliant manufac­turers. 
Tokyo-based Sony, which is cutting 8,000 of its 185,000 jobs, said Tuesday it will shut five or six plants-about 10 per­cent of its 57 factories. Sony also plans to reduce its electronics investments by about one-third by the end of March 2010, although it did not give specific numbers. 
The job cuts are the most drastic here since the U.S. credit crunch hit over the summer. They are a bad twist for Sony, which has been recovering from internal problems in recent years under cost­cutting reforms led by Chief Executive Howard Stringer. 
"This may mean that Sony is now back at square one," said Kazuharu Miura, electron­ics analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research in · Tokyo. "Japanese compa­nies are all in trouble because of this unexpect­ed worldwide slowdown." 
Miura also warned that Sony's measures might not be enough to offset its sliding profits. 
Sony's U.S. shares were up 87 cents, 4.3 percent, at $20.91 in afternoon trading. 
Sony said a plant in Dax, France, which makes tapes and other recording media will be among the plants to close, but it declined to list the others. The moves will deliver more than 100 billion yen

Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Four very rich former housing chiefs lined up before a House panel Thursday for a fresh spanking over the nation's economic crisis, but one -former Fannie Mae chief executive Daniel Mudd -captured the attention of Rep. Bruce Braley. 
"You are one of those rare people who can say, 'My name is Mud' with a straight face." 
It was one of the low points during a five-hour session of lame duck oversight, a special kind of hearing in which members of an expiring Congress lob questions and vent with litile blowback. ' 
There's no more crucial matter before this Congress or the next than the nation's worsening reces­sion and the role that the giant mortgage lenders may have played in it. But in the waning weeks of the 11 Oth Congress, Thursday's session . of the watchdog !louse Oversight Committee was as much about the politicians on the panel as it was about the meltdown affecting mil­lions of Americans. 
Signs of political transition were everywhere. 
After months of putting off Republican demands for the hear­ing, Chairman Henry Waxman chose to hold it this week as his own swan song before he departs to head the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Waxman bade farewell by releas­ing 400,000 documents showing that the CEOs arrayed before the panel ignored warnings that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taking on too many dicey mortgages years before they collapsed and the gov­ernment took them over. 
Waxman did not bother to stay for the whole hearing. And his counter­part, ranking Hepublican Tom Davis of Virginia, was absent; he already has retired from Congress. 
The man likely to replace Davis, Hep. Darrell lssa of California, made his first foray as ranking Republican with a public flogging of the CEOs. 
"You're not accepting any blame for this at all," he said. "You're either standing behind the mandate of the Congress or the mandate of your stockholders, perhaps, the mandate of your bonus packages. And you're telling us that, in fact, everyone was doing it." 
It didn't seem to matter what Mudd and his colleagues had to say in their own defense. From the Democratic end of the dais to the Republican side, lawmakers asked impossible-to-answer questions or just plain ranted against the CEOs' willingness to lower lending stan­dards to match those of Wall Street banks backing the subprime lending industry. 
For good measure, Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., asked the assembled former CEOs to state, out loud, their annual salaries and pen­sions collectPd while oversf~eing the doomed mortgage companies.

Christmas, too, or its season cele­bratory parallel, came around only once in a very great while. The one (or eight, or 12) day celebration itself seemed almost an impossibly, and the other 364, an eternity. Now, it's "Wow. Is it really a whole year that I've had my iPod?

Since sis­ter Maeve broke down sobbing at the end of Mass during '0 Holy Night', and said she believed it, she really did, and she could only hope she'd be half that happy when the baby came in summer? And is baby Zooks really six months old already?" 
Of course, the answer is "yes," though it may not feel that way. Because almost a year has gone by since last Christmas. 
And likewise, almost a semester has gone by since, er, the beginning of last semester. Which is, in its own way, pretty huge~

intellectualist "college" mindset. Still, there's no denying that while one is involved with any kind of educational program, on the giving or receiving end, the semester is a significant unit of time. 
So here we are (again, only quicker) at the end of one. For some of you at Notre Dame, this may signify the beginning of the end, or, for you early (or late) graduates, the end (more accurately: an end). For others, it~ the time to leave the new place they've only just managed to adjust to, and for those abroad in the spring, it'll soon be time to start adjusting (those of us in year-long programs will have our own adjustment issues come next fall). 
Freshman, on the other hand, whether you've had the kind of semester about which an outraged, aging journalist could write the Very Long Novel, or whether your most shocking escapade was stumbling upon the taxidermy display in Galvin (hint: second floor, next to the service elevator), you've still reached a major milestone in your life, and it's defi­nitely something to be proud of. Even if you wind up transferring, or even if your life plans change drastically and you wind up, as did my friend Penelope, taking a year off to teach orphans in Uganda, you will never again live through a first semester of college. Congratulations. 
And I, too, have now finished a first semester of my own. I hope I've learned enough from the first half of my time at Trinity to make the most of the second. 
It's not necessarily easy, though, to know which direction to turn once our semester driven life comes to an abrupt pause and what the rest of the world knows as "real" life starts up for us again. So, once the semester's

The Christmas season is after all a time for birth and rebirth, or at least a time to reboot. Much of the world will be taking a day off "normal" life, but it's never a bad thing to be ready for normal life when it gets back on course. Especially as, once it is on course, it'll only start racing faster. 
Enjoy your break, and use it well. Because before you know it, it'll be Christmas again, little Zooks will be walking, Uncle Moe will be pouring you a legal shot of mint gin this time, you'll think of Nyquil, and, believe you me, you'll find yourself a whole lot older than you were. ·

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


The best women's soccer 
When your team loses a tight game, it can be atough pill to swallow. But when you are the best team and you lose the one game you thought mat­tered, it can be almost impossible to believe. 
This weekend, Notre Dame's women's soccer team lost a game that could have easily gone their way with one more break or one more call. Even though they lost, I cannot express how great of a team they are and how proud they make me to be a Domer. When Hockey won its first CCJIA Championship, when Football went to two straight BCS Bowls, even when Women's Succer appeared in the Finals two years ago -none of these com­pareto what this team has done. 
This is a team that trailed less than five minutes the whole season featur­ing a starting lineup balanced between freshman, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. When North Carolina scored the winning goal, these players did not give up. They worked hard until the last seconds -even apparently draw­ing a free kick that was never called. 
On the sidelines after the game as a 
couple of the players periodieally 
returned to the benches you could see_ 
on their faces how much they had 
wanted that game, but they did not 
hang their heads. Nor should they. 
The 2008 women's'soccer team is easily the greatest team in any sport that I have seen in my four years at Notre Dame and they are a legend for this university. They have represented us well this year, not only by their play, but by their character and class. The best team does not always win and that was the case on Sunday. Even so, this team was just as great in defeat as they have been in victory. 
Congratulations to Kerri, Brittany, Carrie, Elise, Rebecca, and Kerry for leading the 2008 Fighting Irish to a truly great season!

I ran for student senate my sopho­more year. My platform in a nutshell was this: "the only reason to run for senate is to pad your resume, and I need that the most." 
While I was disappointed in not win­ning, I felt better after reading story after story about the Senate in The Observer: It seemed like all they could do was pass resolutions suggesting the University to do one thing or another. My favorite story is one that a would­be colleague told me: Apparently, the senate once spent a good chunk of time discussing the different options the University could take on a particu­lar issue, despite the fact that the University had already decided and acted on it. I think it's time we call the senate what it really is: a democrati­cally elected suggestion box. 
So before we let yet another fresh group of people claim they had leader­ship positions in their job interviews 
because they managed to get 15 peo­
ple to vote for them in their dorm, I suggest that we restructure student 
government by simply eliminating the 
middleman and create an online cam­pus-wide suggestion box. Just abolish the senate, and set up a Web site simi­lar to the Facebook causes page where students can create an join groups that support the issues they care about. To increase awareness, The Observer can publish a list of the top­ics that generate most support on the Web site, and get the remainder of the Student Government to create issue­based committees to do any student­side work if there needs to be. 

What are we fighting for? 
What are we fighting for ... To be 
hated again? I have read with interest 
the various articles; blogs, viewpoint<; 
over the past several weeks with great 
fervor. Articles about snowballs. coaches 
and bowl games have captivated my 
attention even as an alum many miles 
from the university. I, like many, have 
had my moments of angst and frustration 
with the recent event<> surrounding the 
football program. Why so passionate, 
why so interested? Whether we like it or 
not, the football program gives America 
a glimpse of what Notre Dame is all 
about.  
Football does not define the University to those of us who know it and love it. But for good or bad, college football is a passion that brings us together and chal­lenges us on how we examine many aspects ofour university. The national media also love to hate Notre Dame which only fuels our passion too. 
Notre Dame football is a window to the world, on what Notre Dames stands for. And right now. with these recent events. the media coverage and our own nega­tivity filling the airwaves, I think NO should take a step back to see what we are fighting for. Is it really all about wins and losses or being in contention for the BCS? 
Snowballs, humiliating losses, bowl game choices and the reaction of the Notre Dame community all make me wonder where humility and wisdom have gone among us who love Notre Dame. Maybe we should take this opportunity to learn from those wbo dislike this pro­gram so much, the Notre Dame haters. 
Notre Dame football has many haters. Notre Dame is hated and often perceived as arrogant because, in the past the foot­ball program won despite having high academic standards, turned down bowl games because they interfered with finals or Christmas, never failed to recog­nize those who came before and under­stood that The Lady on the Dome is what they "were fighting for." This was humili­ty and not arrogance. Humility would put away our 5 star status, our super bowl rings, our snowballs, and our own inter­
ests and helped us realize that only 
together can Notre Dame achieve some­
thing bigger than ourselves. 
So where is ND football today, how do 
we regain the humility? ND haters are 
upset by Notre Dame's wisdom. The wis­
dom that allowed Notre Dame to not 
compromise on high academic stan­
dards, accept bowl bids with a mediocre 
record, or compromise Christmas. ND 
had the wisdom to see the impact of our 
decisions before we made them. Wisdom 
that comes from experience and cannot 
be expected from college students sitting 
on a pile of snow or players asked to plan 
a bowl destination. 
I do not totally fault the students for throwing snow which should have been shoveled or football players choosing a bowl destination based on sunshine, "beautiful women", or their desire to return so to get ready for NFL scouts in senior bowl gam(ls. 
However. wisdom should come from there coach and administrators. The wis­dom to see the difficulty of leaving behind their classmates (especially the band) and their own families who will not be able to attend; to not consider the past history of not playing on Christmas Eve or Christmas; the need to practice during final exams; picking a later bowl game that would allow more practice which was the reason for accepting a bowl bid at 6-6; playing on another team's home field when there is a huge need for a win for this program which hasn't won a bowl game since many of the players were in kindergarten. Where is the wis­dom in this bowl decision? 
BCS consideration is important but not nearly important as Notre Dame seeking the humility and vvisdom which has sepa­rated us from every other football pro­gram in the country. What are we fight­ing for? To be hated again.

Question of the day 
Our campus is in the midst of a cri­sis. The crisis I speak of is worse than the steady replacement of pants by leggings. Worse than the disappear­ance of cheese fries from Reekers. And yes, even worse than Dave Cavadini's offensive and vulgar excuse for a comic. Notre Dame is in the grip of a monster. And this monster's name is discrimination. 
Allow me to explain. I love the ques­tion of the day. ln fact, unless some:­body has recently insulted a SMC chick or the Vagina Monologues are coming up (meaning a bitter and pointless · viewpoint war is raging) the question of the day is pretty much the only thing I read. Each morning, I eagerly grab my copy of The Observer, throw out the middle section, ignore the front page and turn to see which lucky students were selected to rise to the throne of campus fame and glory. Who knew Notre Dame students could be so clever? Question: "What do you think of the snow?" Answer: "It's cold!" These two small words are a simple truth sprinkled with a hint of sarcastic genius. 
After reading such intriguing answers, I stroll to my classes, hoping 
' to be approached by the miracle work­er responsiblt> for the question of the day. And yet after 4 years of such aimless wandering, I still have not been featured in the hallowed boxes on top of page 2. I paid my $160,000 dues to the University. Each semester my $6 Observer fee is collected just like everyone else's. (Check your stu­dent account bill ... it's there.) Still, nothing! I can think of no possible reason behind this depressing occur­rence except that "the Man" behind the question of the day is a discrimina­tor. He discriminates on the basis of attractiveness. 
I am not what one would call photo­genic. ("Not photogenic" being a euphemism for ugly). My own mother makes me stay in the back of family photos. Behind my 6-foot brother. She also makes me sit down. I inspire a sentiment similar to Buzz's girlfriend in Home Alone. Woof. Reader, have vou ever been featured in the question of the day? If the answer is no, take a look in the mirror. There's a 99.9% chance that you too have a face only a mother could love. This discrimina­tion must end. Those of us with asym­metric features, buckteeth, unibr:ows, and moles the size of Texas must band together. We must demand equal question of the day opportunity. We must fight: We must win.

Have yourself arecessionista Christmas 
It's the most wonderful time of the year, right? Yet, a lot of us are finding ourselves backed into a corner this season with too many people to send gifts to and not enough money to Adriana Pratt live up to retailers' standards. This per­spective makes for Scene Writer a dismal outlook on what is supposed to be a season of endless cheeriness and love that will soothe the soul like a nice cup of hot chocolate, so Scene has come up with a way to keep that hap­piness at an all-time high by eliminat­ing the monetary pressures giving the gifts usually come with. There's no need to stress this season, here are gift ideas that will fit into a minimal budget: 
For the easy-going significant other: A mixed CD 
This gift costs virtually nothing but at the same time can be truly touch­ing. Load a CD with songs that remind you of your significant other and your blossoming relationship, and you'll be sure to get a loving thank-you in response. Also be comforted by the fact that every time your boyfriend or girlfriend hears one of those songs on the radio, tliey'll forever be reminded of you. 
For the green gal: Organic aloe vera peace soaps

Made with organic aloe vera juice, these soaps will emanate a soothing fresh mint and herbal scent and come in a cute lime green shape with the word "Peace" printed on one side and a peace sign on the other and cost only $8. Visit midnightfarm.net for details. 
For the Budding Fashionist~: A Magazine Subscription 
Sometimes it's easy to lose touch with the fashion world as a Notre Dame student, especially when so much time is devoted to schoolwork and virtually the only place to get a magazine is the Bookstore. Make life easy for your fashion frenzied friends-:> by buying them a subscription to a fashion magazine. lnStyle has a going rate of two subscriptions fur the low price of $29.95. For the smartypants: "100 Words to Make You Sound Smart" 
This book, costing only $5.95 and provided by Urban Outfitters, promises to enrich people's vocabulary by pro­viding them with words that will fill those awkward gaps, entertain avid listeners, and impress that pinchy boss. Useful words ofjust one syllable (ex: glib), popular catch phrases from modern-day culture (Catch-22), classi­cal terms (stoic), and words derived from the names of influential people (Machiavellian) are all defined and showed in context in this golden piece. For the TV-Junkie: TV Show T-Shirts 
Falling around the $17.95 price range, the T-shirts provided by TVstoreonline.com capture funny quotes, memorable images, and famous phrases of the best shows around that will ensure "fan status" to anyone who wears them.

LAS VEGAS -Record­
·setting closer Francisco Rodriguez and the New York Mets reached a prelim­inary agreement Tuesday on a $37 million, three-year contract. 
The sides still have to work out a written agree­ment and the pitcher must pass a physical, two people familiar with the negotia­tions said Tuesday. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the con­tract had not yet been com­pleted. 
K-Rod recorded 62 saves for the Los Angeles Angels this year, five more than the previous big league mark set by Bobby Thigpen of the Chicago White Sox in 1990, and then filed for free agency. His agent, Paul Kinzer, had hoped to get a five-year contract, possibly equaling the $15 million average salary Mariano Rivera is earning from the New York Yankees. 

But with baseball execu­tives worried about the national recession, Kinzer accepted a more modest deal. 
With the agreement, the Mets are ceasing negotia­tions with Brian Fuentes and career saves leader Trevor Hoflinan, two other free-agent closers, one of the people said. Rodriguez's contract will contain an option for 2012 that could become guaranteed based on his performance, the person said. 
A three-time All-Star who turns 27 next month, Rodriguez was regarded as the top closer on the mar­ket. While some teams were worried about his violent pitching motion and drop in velocity last season, he developed an outstanding curveball to go along with his other pitches. 
Hodriguez and Kinzer arrived in Las Vegas last weekend and dined Sunday night with general manager Omar Minaya, chief operat­ing oflicer Jeff Wilpon and other team officials at a steakhouse. 

In a slow free-agent mar­ket, Rodriguez was the first of the top-tier free agents to reach an agreement. Pitchers CC Sabathia and 
A.J. Burnett, first baseman Mark Teixeira and outfield­er Manny Ramirez are among the high-profile play­ers still searching for deals. 
The Mets were seeking a closer to replace Billy Wagner, who is likely will miss all of next season fol­lowing elbow ligament­replacement surgery. Rodriguez's market value was depressed because sev­eral closers were free agent" and most big-market teams were set with the back end of their bullpens.

NFLPA files f,!rievance 
on behalf ofiJurress 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.-The NFL Players Association filed a grievance on Tuesday challenging the suspension and fine given to Plaxico Burress by the New York Giants after the receiver accidental­ly shot himself in a nightclub more than a week ago. 
The union said that the team vio­lated the collective bargaining agreement last week when it placed Burress on the reserve-non football injury list, suspended him for the final four games of the regular sea­son and fined him an additional week's salary for conduct detrimen­tal to the team. 
Placing Burress on the non-foot­ball injury list also will keep him out of the playoffs. The Giants (11­
2) won the NFC East title on Sunday. 
Union spokesman Carl Francis said the grievance will be heard by an arbitrator after the season ends.

Underclassmen helping lead the way for Belles 
By ERIC PRISTER 
Sports Writer 

Underclassmen have shined so far this year for Saint Mary's, and freshmen Audrey Dalrymple and Eva Cavadini have led that movement. 
The two have combined for 13 first-place finishes through six meets and have recorded impressive times throughout the year. But according to Belles coach Ran Dombkowski, neither swim­mer has reached her full potential, which gives hope to the Belles for both this season and the next three years. 
Dalrymple has also put on a strong showing so far this season, with six first-place finishes, including two firsts in the 200-yd medley relay and two firsts in the 100-yd breaststroke. 
Because of the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday, Dombkowski says, he hasn't had a chance to rest his swimmers as much as he would like. Dalrymple's strong performances, espe­cially at the end of this semester, give the Belles coach hope of great things to come. 
"Audrey's performances [at

starting to figure out that bal­.ance a little." 
Dombkowski attributes 
Cavadini's success to her 
excellent work ethic. 
"Eva is probably one of the 
hardest workers on the team 
from the start until the finish 

of practice," Dombkowski 
said. "She hasn't been quite 
as fast as I think both she and 
I would like, but...once she 
settles into a little more com­
fort level with balancing her 
schedule ... we'll see some 

impressive time drops next

Times drops would be impressive for Cavadini, who has recorded seven first-place times so far this semester, in a combination of freestyle individual and relay events, along with two first-place fin­ishes in the 200-yd butterfly. 
those times at an unrested invite only halfway through the season is very encouraging. I look for big things from Audrey next semester." 
Dalrymple herself agrees with Dombkowski, believing that more success is still to come. 
"Individually I am pleased where I am at so far this sea­son, but I have set my goals high and will continue to work toward them," she said. 
The Belles will take a win­ter training trip to Florida over break, and will restart competition on Jan. 10. When that time comes, look for both Eva Cavadini and Audrey Dalrymple to be at the top of their game and ready to suc­ceed.

NCAA BASKETBALL 
Red-hot Curryleads Davidson pastWest Virginia 

Associated Press 
. NEW YORK -Stephen Curry kept missing. His teammates kept telling him to shoot. 
Not a bad idea. 
Curry, the nation's leading scorer and one of the most popular college basketball players of this generation, fought off a terrible shooting start and took over the final 5 minutes to lead No. 23 Davidson to a 68-65 victory over West Virginia on Tuesday night in the Jimmy V Classic. 
"I was frustrated but my teammates kept telling me to keep shooting," said Curry, who missed 12 of his first 13 3-point attempts before mak­ing the last three and scoring 13 of the \Vildcats' last 15 points of the game. "I was trying to get some motion,~ but their defense with their long arms took that away." 
That didn't matter to Andrew Lovedale, whose 15 points were second to Curry's
27. . "We knew he had a dry peri.pd where he couldn't make any shots," Lovedale said, "but I walked up to him at a timeout and said 'Keep shooting. We'll get you the ball."' Curry got his teammates the ball as well, finishing with 10 assists, although he did have eight turnovers. He was 9-of-27 from the .field, including 4-of-16 from 3­point range, but finished 4.3 points below his average. 
Curry entered the game shooting 50.4 percent from 
the field and 40.9 percent from behind the arc. 
"It doesn't happen a lot," Curry said, when asked about the tough shooting night. "I got a little down on myself early in the second half because I had a fresh start and continued to go bad. 
"We all had our heads hanging a little bit because we couldn't get defensive rebounds, but as a whole, we energized and pulled togeth­er down the stretch, which is what we have learned to do over the last two years." 
The last of Curry's late 3s gave the Wildcats (7-1) the lead for good at 64-62 with 39 seconds to play. 
"He made two incredibly hard shots at the end," West Virginia coach Bob Huggins said. "The first one was a really, really hard shot where he was fading and got his feet down and we guarded that well. I hoped our length would bother him and we kept running guys at him so he couldn't get settled with one guy on him." 
The crowd at Madison Square Garden was oohing on every shot Curry let go, many of them from behind the NBA 3-point line, which is 2 feet, 3 inches deeper than college basketball's line. 
"It's cool to have that, but I don't really notice during the game," Curry said, "but it is special in a place of this magnitude. It's something I'll remember." 
John Flowers spent the most time covering Curry, but most of the Mountaineers 
(6-2} got a chance -espe­cially because West Virginia did an excellent job· of switching when Curry tried to use a teammate as a screen, forcing him farther away from the basket. 
When Curry connected with just under 5 minutes to play, he turned his back at mid­court and let his shoulders slump. The crowd was back on his side and he didh't let them down. 
"He is never flustered or frustrated by any adversity that faces him," Davidson coach Bob McKillop said. "I don't know how he does it, but that prevents him from having many shooting nights like he did tonight." 
D a ' S e a n B u t i.e r h ad a career-high 24 points and grabbed 14 rebounds for West Virginia, while fresh­man Devin Ebanks had 13 points and 17 rebounds. 
The Mountaineers finished with a 58-32 rebound advan­tage, 29-12 on the offensive end. 
West Virginia didn't have second-leading scorer Alex Ruoff, who injured his shoul­der in its win over Cleveland State last week, and Joe Mazzulla, the other starting guard, reinjured his shoulder early against Davidson and played only six minutes. 
"Take any team and take away its two starting guards and see how they do against Davidson, and we had a chance to win the game," Hu~ins said. "If we get something that goes the other way, I don't know. We had a hard time scoring at 

the end of the game." 
Davidson played without senior guard Max Paulhus Gosselin, the team's best defender, who was suspend­ed for one game by the Southern Conference after he was charged with a flagrant foul in a weekend victory over North Carolina State. 
That meant Curry had to play all 40 minutes. "We missed Max because with him in the rotation I 
usually don't play 40 min­utes," Curry said. "This was a special situation, but worked on my endurance over the summer." 
Curry had 44 points in that win over the Wolfpack, which followed his scoreless game against the junk defense of Loyola (Md). 
This was Davidson's first appearance in Madison Square Garden since the 1972 NIT.

we had a lot of young guys, myself included. A lot of our blue-liners were freshmen and sophomores. I think this year guys have a lot more confi­dence and experience." 
Jackson agreed that the biggest change in Pearce's game since taking over the starting duties at the start of last season has been his confi­dence. He spent his first two years at Notre Dame backing up the program's statistical leader in almost every catego­ry, Dave Brown. 
"I think the ability has always been there," Jackson said. "I think once he knew Brown was leaving... mentally he said, 'This is my chance' and I think he took a hold of it. I give him a lot of credit for that because some kids would have packed it in." 
Pearce said watching Brown play for two years taught him he had to be more consistent with his game. He also said that he has improved a lot from

"They're record is a little deceiving because they've played a really tough sched­ule .... I think they're a much-improved team over last year," McGraw said. 
If the Irish are going to break Michigan's defense, McGraw said, they will have to be patient. 
"If we can be patient with our shot selection, work the ball a little bit, see if we his work with Jackson, who played in net for Michigan State during his coltege days. 

Jackson and the team's three goaltenders have at least one session a week where they show up early and work on very specific technical weak­nesses for each goalie. The group also watches film every week to see where they need work. 
"[Jackson] knows a lot about goaltending. You might not expect that from him being such a great head coach. He is really good at pointing out a lot of subtle details and working on those things," Pearce said. 
That extra work has Pearce climbing in the Irish record books. Saturday night's shutout was the sixth of his career, tying him with Morgan Cey for the second most in program history. 
His first chance to move ahead of Cey comes .Friday night at Bowling Green. Pearce said he still hasn't decided which undies he will be pack­ing.

turnover-to-assist ratio. Currently, the Irish have only 10 more helpers than giveaways (122 to 112), including a 14 assist, 18 turnover game against Purdue. McGraw said the Boilermaker defense deserves credit for that number. 
"I thought they were long and athletic, and they got their hands on a lot of balls," McGraw said. 
McGraw said that her team is continuing to improve its ball control, mentioning guard Brittany Mallory in particular as

to be smart and just see how the game's going and use our heads a little bit more in terms of our shot selection," McGraw said. 
Notre Dame will also need to keep rebounding like it has most of this season. After being outrebounded in the opener against Evansville, McGraw made hitting the boards the No. 1 priority for her team. McGraw reemphasized that priority after Michigan State beat her team on the boards. 
"[Rebounding is] some­thing we're really empha­sizing at practice. We've been watching it real close­ly in the games," McGraw said. 
Against the Boilermakers, the Irish did win on the glass, grabbing 4 7 rebounds to Purdue's 35. 
"When I watched the film I saw a concerted effort to box out a lot better. It was a just a team effort to keep them off the boards. And then I thought our post 
players did  an  outstanding  
job  getting  the  ball,"  
McGraw added.  

Another offensive problem McGraw said she hopes her team can correct against the Wolverines is the 
continue their 

quest to defend the 3-point line this season. The Irish have given up only a 23.2 shooting per­centage this season, a vast improvement from a 35.5 percentage last season from 3-point land. 
"Look at their 3-point attempts, they've shot 203, and we've only shot 88. They're shooting an awful lot of 3s," McGraw said. "[Guard Carly] Benson in particular has a quick 
-release; she's big. So she's going to create a lot of matchup problems. But when you look at their stats, they all shoot 3s." 
Notes: 
+Ashley Barlow, who suf­fered a concussion against Michigan State on No. 29, is currently day-to-day. Barlow had a meeting with the trainer on Tuesday to see if she is ready for the Michigan game, but McGraw was still unsure of her availability.

expect because there will be plenty of negative recruiting from now until February." 
To combat these negative pitches aimed at the Irish pro­gram, Weis and his staff have focused on giving recruits per­sonal attention with in-home visits. 
"Coach Weis has never been a guy to stand on the sidelines when it comes to recruiting," Frank said. "He works extremely hard. He's probably the hardest working coach I've ever seen at Notre Dame. When

continued from page 20 
As a team, Notre Dame shot 3 7 -percent from behind the arc and 38-percent overall from the field -well below the team's season averages of 42-and 46-percent, respec­tively. The team's 62 points were also well short of the team's season average of 84 points-per-game. 
"We weren't ourselves," McAlarney said. "I was f.dlk­ing to some of the guys, and we were saying it just didn't feel right." 
On Saturday, Ohio State combined a three-quarter­court press with a 1-2-2 half­court zone. That approach slowed Notre Dame's tempo down forcing the Irish into a half-court game where the Buckeyes expanded their defense towards the three­point line paying razor-sharp attention to the Irish's shoot­ers, especially McAlarney. 
"They were talking really well," McAlarney said. "If I ran the baseline, they were [saying] here comes the shooter. Their big guys extended really well out with their length, and it was tough for a short guy like me to get a shot off." 
It didn't help that Notre Dame lost the rebounding battle to Ohio State 43-36. Failing to get defensive rebounds prevented the Irish 
~from running in transition forcing the team to bring the ball up against the Buckeyes' press. That full-court pres­sure also gave the Irish trou­ble as they committed several turnovers including two cru­cial ones midway through the first half. "We had a couple of spurts where they really got to us," Brey said. "After that stretch where we turned it over a few times in the first half, we never attacked the rest of the game whether it was the press or their zone in the half-court.

Although the 2008 Notre Dame season certainly won't be labeled as anything near ideal status, there is one thing the Irish can do to make at least a small stride on the recruiting trail-a bowl win. 
"I think it's really important," Frank said. "For the 2009 kids to see Notre Dame bounce back from a rough stretch and get

things back in order. I don't think it will make or break any­thing but for the 2010 kids, they were off to a tremendous start with the 2010 kids. They're in really god position with some of the elite guys and I'm not sure what kind of dam­age a 6-6 season can do. I know one thing -a win will certainly help. What they can't have is to see 'Notre Dame keeps its bowl losing streak alive' all over ESPN and that's the kind of thing you need to avoid, so it's very important for the future of the program to win this game."

pointed in that because we need to be more mentally tough." 
Given Ohio State's success in slowing down the Notre Dame offense, a lingering question is if other teams will emulate the Buckeyes sup­posed blue-print for defen­sive success against the Irish. Brey said that it wasn't lost on him that other teams may now try to zone-press Notre Dame more than they have in the past. 
Still, would other teams have the personnel to suc­cessfully play such a defense against Notre Dame? It's not every team that has Dallas Lauderdale -a forward with a 7-5 wingspan capable of defending out on the three­
" point line. Yet the Big-East will surely have teams with similar length and athletic ability on the defensive end. Louisville and Georgetown are both currently ranked top-10 nationally in defensive field goal percentage -both ahead of th~ Buckeyes, who are 11th in the nation. ''I'm sure other teams will be capable because in the Big East other teams will have similar bodies as Ohio State," 
forward Ryan Ayers said. "It will be a challenge for us if other teams go to that zone." 
Whether or not future Irish opponents ~re capable of playing the same caliber of defense as Ohio State, Notre Dame feels they will be pre­pared for it. Several players emphasized the blame for Saturday's disappointing offensive performance laid more with the Irish than the Buckeyes' defense. 
McAlarney talked about ' how the Irish would approach the same style of defense should they see it again, and his remarks echoed Brey's comments about how his team was taken out of their attacking mindset Saturday. 
"Our mentality will be dif­ferent. No [change in] strate­gy really. We know how to play so well that we'll figure out how to get to open areas. It was a matter of that night it was really us," he said. "Our energy level wasn't there, and I think we learned from that game that we have to bring it every night. When we didn't bring it, we're a normal team."

FOOTBALL RECRUITING 
Recruits happy to learn that Weis will continue to coach ND 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
Among the chaos and confu­sion that a potential coaching change brings, one thing was made certain about Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis dur­ing perhaps his moment of greatest adversity in his four­year career -despite his struggles on the field, Weis can recruit. . 
After the disappointing Irish loss at the hands of Southern California, Weis and the rest of the coaching staff hit the recruiting trail to attempt and convince potential commits that the program was in sure hands. 
With the uncertainty sur­rounding the head coaching position, most of the high­school prospects currently com­mitted to Notre Dame were hearing recruiting pitches from rival programs. Mike Frank, who covers Notre Dame foot­ball for Scout.com, knows that Irish commits were bombarded with these sorts of comments. 
"I think, originally, they were hearing a bunch of things," Frank said. "·Stuff like, 'Coach Weis is not going to be back, he's not going to be coaching them,' and I think the big thing was when Notre Dame finally came out and said something, it made a lot of people more com­fortable with their situation." 
Frank said he feels that this is the nature of high school recruiting -especially when a season doesn't quite live up to expectations. 
"Well kids are going to be hearing things from other schools whether you have a 6-6 record or a 9-3 record or even a 11-0 record," Frank said. "That's the nature of the beast. I can't remember too many recruiting classes that have gone by where Notre Dame did­n't lose one of their committed players at one point, but they usually gain some guy that nobody knows about as well." 

Despite all the other pro­grams attempts to get in the committed players' ears, the Irish coaching staff can restore

"They're a really good defensive team. If you look at what they're doing defensive­

Michigan has surrendered more than 66 points only once this season -an· 81-53 loss at USC on Dec. 2. 
The points per game is even more impressive considering M i chigan 's s c h e d u Ie so far this season. Notre Dame will be the fourth top-15 team the Wolverines have played. and they have gone 1-2 in those games. Michigan lost to then­No. 12 Texas A&M 59-56 and beat then-No. 13 Vanderbilt

Senior netminder earns CCHA honors in wins over Ferris St. 
. By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 
When Notre Dame arrived at Ferris State for a pair of games last weekend goaltender Jordan Pearce realized that he forgot a key piece of equipment -his lucky boxers. 
"I forgot the boxers this week­end so I was like, 'Oh, darn,' but I didn't really let it bother me," Pearce said. 
Apparently it didn't. Pearce stopped 55 of the Bulldogs' 56 shots to pick up two more wins and his second shutout of the season on Saturday night -so much for the luck of the Irish. 
"If I was really superstitious I would have been so worried about that I might not have got­ten ready the same way," he said. · 
Pearce was named the CCHA Goaltender of the Week for his performance at Ferris State. According to Irish coach Jeff Jackson, the award is a good recognition of how well the sen­ior netminder has been playing all year. Pearce is currently sec­ond in the CCHA in both goals against average (1.66) and save percentage (.937). Only Alaska's Chad Johnson has slightly better numbers. 

"Right now he's playing really well," Jackson said. "I just don't want him to get distracted by the awards or attention, but he's a pretty humble kid." 
The Alaska native had a red hot month of November. His 1.36 goals against average helped the No. 1 Irish a 12-game win streak, which is currently the longest in the country. The streak includes two shootout victories featuring game-saving stops from Pearce. For his efforts, he was named the RBC Financial Group's CCHA player of the month. 
"You get confidence the more you play," Pearce said. "Last year

Ohio State tough'vs. Irish attack 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
With under 10 seconds to play Saturday against Ohio State and Notre Dame need­ing a three-pointer to tie the game, Kyle McAlarney fired away from at least six feet behind the 3-point line. 
It was probably the best shot he was going to get. 
The Buckeyes stifled Notre Dame's high-powered ()ffense, especially McAlarney and the Irish's 3-point shoot­ing, like no other Irish oppo­nent this season. McAlarney, who entered Saturday's game having hit 10, nine and seven treys in his previous three games, missed all six of his 3-point attempts on Saturday.

Belles set to face Manchester 
By KATE GRABAREK 
Sports Writer 

Coming off. a pair of home wins, the Belles trav­el to Manchester tonight a 7 p.m. looking for a non­conference victory. 
"I think we are making progress as a team." Belles coach Jen Henley said. "We need to continue to focus on the defensive end of the game and develop overall consistency." 
The Belles are turning to some veteran leadership this season, including sen­ior Erin Newsom. 
Newsom, a South Bend native, is the co-athlete of the week at Saint Mary's this week, after racking up 39 points last week. 
The Belles' victory over Calvin last week was the first time they had beaten Calvin in 29 attempts. 
"I think that we see all the conference teams as rivals," Newsom said. "Some schools arc seen as tougher to beat like Hope and Calvin, but we try to go into every game with the attitude that we need to play our best in order to win, regardless of the team we're put up against." 
Along with Newsom, the Belles will turn to seniors Nicole Beier, Meghan Conaty and Katie Rashid to help improve on their fourth place finish in the conference from last year. 
The Belles took a big step in the right direction with their two MIAA wins last week. 
The Belles freshmen are also getting plenty of play­ing time early this season to help replace the loss of Alison Kessler to gradua­tion. 
"I think our freshmen class is adjusting well," Henley said. "Our return­ing players have done an outstanding job in welcom­ing them to our team and making sure they don't get lost along the way." 
Freshman Patsy Mahoney was able to rack up 10 points in the win over Calvin on Saturday leading
