Simpson -Mazzoli bill influenced by President Theodore Hesburgh 
ByMARYCAROLCREADON 
StaffReporter 
Father Theodore Hesburgh, Uni­
versity president, was influential in 
the sponsoring of the Simpson­
Mazzoli bill that would grant am­
nesty to all illegal aliens who arrived 
in the United States before 1982. 
Representative Romano Mazzoli, chairman of the House Subcommit· tee on Immigration, Refugees and International Law, a 19';4 Nmre Dame graduate, said in an interview with the Lexington Herald-Leader that Hesburgh was influential in his sponsoring the bill. The bill passed the house by five votes. 
Mazzoli was a sophomore at Notre Dame in 1952 when Hesburgh became president of the University. Mazzoli says he kept "in touch with him over the years." 
Four years ago at the start of the 97th Congress, Mazzoli had the choice to serve as chairman ofeither a crime or immigration subcommit· tee. In the Herald-Leader article Mazzoli said, "What convinced me to take the subject is the two-fold combination of Father Hesburgh and an opportunity to deal with a

Notre Dame professors disagree on impact of-V.P. debate 
By SCOTT BF..ARBY 
News Staff 
In the aftermath of the vice 

presidential debate between Wal­
ter Mondale and Geraldine Fer­
raro, Notre Dame professors 
disagreed on the impact of the 
debate. 
Donald Downs, assistant profes­sor for government and interna­tional relations, said, "Both were winners. They accomplished what they set out to do." 
Robert Schmuhl, assistant pro­fessor ofAmerican studies, said the "winners of the vice presidential debate were Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Both Bush and Fer­raro proved their value to their tickets. Both were knowledgeable and forceful in presenting their views." 
The 90-minute question session sponsored by the League of Wo­men Voters, centered around domestic and foreign affairs. There was a difference of opinion by the professors on the quality of ques­tioning. 
Michael Francis, chairman ofthe department of government, said the questioning was "not good at all." Downs had a milder view, stating that the questioning was better at the first presidential debate. He did say the questions were too personal at times. 
Both Schmuhl and Donald Kom­mers, professor ofgovernment and law, had no large difficulty with the panelists' questions. 

The panelists were representa­tives from U.S. News and World Report, Time, The National Broad­casting Network and Knight­Ridder newspapers. 
Each of the local observers had differing views on individual weak­nesses in Bush and Ferraro. Schmuhl felt that Ferraro handled herself well, except for lack of eye contact with the audience. Bush, on the other hand, 'came across as someone interested in talking about issues with his opponent,' he said. 
Downs felt Ferraro handled her­self better on domestic affair ques­tions, while Rush fared better with foreign policy. 
Francis felt the candidates, at times, did get away with not answering questions fully. 
All agreed Ferraro, in the spot­light because of being the first wo­man vice presidential candidate on 
a  major  ticket,  handled  herself  
well.  
Both  Ferraro  and  Bush  had  

prepared extensively the week before in hopes of making a strong showing in the televised debate. To prepare for her first political debate, Ferraro held practice ses­sions with a Bush stand-in and spent much time reviewing brief­ing books prepared by het staff. 
Bush's preparation included making refinements in his speaking style through criticisms by media consultant.">. 
Kommers said debates are useful and, if nothing more, make for good theater. "Vice presidential debates are in theory a good idea," said Francis. 
A similar view is held by Downs who said that vice presidential can­didates should debate. 
Schmuhl did wish to point out that the meeting Thursday was more ofa joint appearance than an actual debate, but he said that it is useful for voters to hear the candi­dates explain their views. 
There will not be a second vice presidential forum, although Wal­ter Mondale and Ronald Reagan will debate next Sunday. 
There was no 1980 vice presidential debate, although Mondale did battle Robert Dole in 
1976.

At least we can do something about world hunger 
One trillion, five hundred seventy-three billion dol­lars. No, this is not something out of a science fiction novel. It is the national debt ofthe United States. And on Saturday President Reagan signed legislation raising the debt limit by 1251 billion to Sl.824 trillion. 
To place this monstrous 13-digit figure in a student's grasp, here is the national debt in Domer terms: 
According to Vice President for Student Affairs Fa­ther David Tyson, the administration is going to spend $3.7 million to renovate LaFortune Student Center. With the national debt, the administration could renovate 425,135 such student centers. 
Tuition, room, board and laundry were increased an average of nine percent to a total of 19,445 for the 1984-85 school year. If the national debt were in the hands ofJoseph Russo, director of financial aid, more than 41 million students could receive four-year educa­tions at this cost at Notre Dame. This is the approximate population of Iran.

The Food and Agricultural Organization ofthe United Nations has estimated that 500 million people suffer from severe malnutrition. 
Data for the years 1972 to 1974 indicate that 10 percent of the daily nutritional requirement per capita in the world was available. 
During the last 10 years, the increase in world food production has slowed to 1.7 percent. Only three to four percent of the current total U.S. agricultural exports constitute food aid.

Joe Zahn resignation sparks mixed reactions from campus leaders 
By BOB MUSSELMAN 
News staff 
Joe Zahn's resignation last Thursday from the Judicial Council chair drew a mixed reaction. 
Pete )arret, the council represen­tative from Flanner Hall, said he "had no idea," that Zahn was going to resign until an hour before the meeting. 
"Some of his ideas were good," saidJohn Pietrowicz, representative from Pangborn Hall, citing Zahn's at­tempts to increase the interaction of the rectors and theJudicial Council. 

Bill Bergamo, elected to take Zahn's place, knew ofZahn's plans to resign. He said the only reasons for 
. the resignation that he knew about consisted of a "few personality con­tlicts." He said the council "got off on the wrong foot," and under his direction would complete the proj­ects already in progress. Zahn had been especially criticized for his attempts to transfer control of student elections from the Ombudsman's office to the Judi­cial Council. The Ombudsman's of­fice is a non-political organization within student government which acts as a problem seeker. 
35,000 attend Chicago protest rally against nuclear buildups in U.S. 
By KIMBERLY TRENNER 
News Staff 
lbirty-five thousand nuclear 
freeze supporters gathered Saturday 
in Chicago to march in the Midwest 
Freeze Rally. 
Amongthe 18scheduledspeakers were Chicago Mayor Harold Wash­ington and the Reverend Jesse L Jackson. Although the rally was billed as a non-political event many of the speakers attacked President Reagan's policy regarding nuclear arms. 
Jackson's speech was filled with anti-Reagan sentiment. He said that Reagan's diplomatic policies are leading us to war. jackson also said that the lack of an arms agreement with the Soviet Union is leading to an escalation of nuclear weapons. 
Leonard Woodcock, former United Auto Workers president, also urged negotiations for an arms con­trol treaty with the Soviets. Wood­cock said that our country would be stronger and safer with a freeze than by continuing to escalate the arms race.

Thousands of drunk Kansas State students attack police after game 
Associated Press 
· 

MANHAITAN, Kan. · Thousands of drunken Kansas State University football fans, celebrating a victory over their archrival, attacked police early Sunday in a "frightening'' near-riot in which several officers were injured and 2S people were ar­rested, police said. 
"We had several thousand drunk people on our hands ... and they started attacking officers," said Man­hattan police Sgt. Darrell Yarnall. The situation came close to erupting into a riot, he said. 
As many as 8,000 people, most of them students, had packed into a

"They got to drinking, it kept get­ting more crowded and they started to take over the streets," said Yar­nail, who was among officers from Manhattan, Junction City and the Kansas Highway Patrol who were called to the scene. "I can tell you it definitely was frightening."

The ·celebrants, chanting "We're

and choke off streets, he said. One 
officer was stabbed in the forearm 
with a knife and others were pelted 
with botdes and debris, he said. 
Reinforcements were called in, and it took about 75 officers, most of them wearing riot helmets and car· rying wooden clubs, a couple of hours to clear the area and restore peace, Brown said. 
Six officers were treated at a hospital and released, and several other officers sustained injuries that did not require hospital treatment, Brown said. Most of the injuries were cuts and bruises on the face and arms, he said. 
Twenty-five people were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and battery of a police officer, Yar­nall said. By mid-morning Sunday, most had been released after posting bail, he said. 
There were no reports of serious property damage, but at one point a crowd rushed into a convenience store and began stealing beer from the cooler, Brown said. 
Yarnall said police did not use tear gas, but that a "civilian type" set offa canister oftear gas in a bar. 
Chet Peters, vice president for student affairs at Kansas State, said Sunday morning that he had not received an official report about what took place. He said the situa­tion would be reviewed and appro­priate disciplinary action taken against any students found to have broken the law.

'Student store' challenges high Bookstore prices 
In the absence of market competition, there is nothing to stop prices from getting out of hand. Unfortunately, this is the case at Notre Dame, where the difficulty of getting off campus to the malls has resulted in a virtual monopoly by the Hammes-Notre Dame Bookstore. 
· A study conducted by the Student Senate last January confirmed that bookstore prices for school ~upplies and health and beauty aids are not com­petitive. When a committee compared prices at Hammes to area drugstores, it found differences of up to 45 percent -even for brand-name items. But when the committee approached Brother Conan Moran, bookstore manager since the 1950s, with suggestions for improving the situation, he was rude and un­cooperative. He said the committee was "dishonest" and its survey was "politically motivated." 
The committee proposed that the bookstore sell items at or below cost, but was told this was "a bad business practice." Another alternative, supplying products of a lower grade, was rejected because Notre Dame students were supposedly "brand conscious" and would not buy generic items. Moran made it clear students could not approach the problem through the bookstore. 
As a result, the senate recently took more direct action by proposing to establish a non-profit "student store" to sell generic items as an alternative to bookstore items. The store would be located in the basement of LaFortune Student Center and would be operated by students. In addition to providing day-to-day items at reasonable prices, a student-run store would be more con­veniently located for many students and presumably would be less crowded during football weekends. 
However, Thomas Mason, vice president for business affairs, said of the pro­posed store, "It would go bankrupt." The administration has consistently dis­couraged th~ senate from its attempts to provide any such alternative to the -
Hammes bookstore, suggesting it is unnecessary and implying that direct com­petition with Hammes will not be allowed. 
The attitude ofMoran and Mason raises questions about Hammes' purpose as a campus store. If the store is mainly to provide convenient and accessible shopping for students, then why not sell at prices more compatible with stu­dent budgets? If it is primarily to make a profit off visiting alumni and others buying Notre Dame paraphernalia, then why not support a separate, student­run store? 
The bookstore continues to make a profit at the expense ofstudents. Main­taining this practice just because it is "good bu5iness" is unfair unless there is a viable alternative for students who cannot easily get off campus to shop. But the administrative discouragement ofa student store suggests the University is reluctant to lose any bookstore business. It seems bookstore profits are a higher priority than student concerns. 
The rejection of a student general store is even less understandable in view ofthe fact that there are several other student-run stores on campus, including the Student Union record store, Irish Gardens, the newT-shirt store and dorm foodsales. 
The idea of a bookstore alternative has great potential. and should not be compromised or watered down so its effectiveness is lost. As a result ofadmin­istration pressure, the senate will propose tonight to establish a store selling only generic items. There is no reason not to carry brand name items as well, as generic goods will not have the same selling potential among students. 
A student store, set up in the spirit of fair competition, would provide a needed alternative to the bookstore and would prove that student government actually can have an impact on the issues that matter.

Gays on campus: The invisible presence 
. 
Suddenly last summer the world came crashing down on Jim (a pseudonym). His story could easily get lost in the sea of stories that wash routinely over this campus. But jim's story is too important to allow it to go unnoted by the campus community. 
You see, Jim is gay. And Jim used to attend Notre Dame and therein lies the crux of the conflict. Let's examine an aspect of Notre Dame briefly and then return toJim's tale. 
It is often said that the Notre Dame commu· nity is one grand family, but as with any family 
The ND-SMC Gay s·ociety guest column 
some members tend to be more prominent, more celebrated -more loved, if you will ­than others. And as with families, some mem­bers tend to be more hidden, less mentioned, less included than others. Sometimes it's diffi­cult to know why a parent seems to relish the achievements ofone child more than another, but in the case ofNotre Dame it is much easier 
-although realistically no less complex  -to  
perceive why  gays  are  "invisible"  to  the  
campus population.  

When this campus celebrates its stars, they are often athletes excelling on a field or a court, or scholars pioneering new paths in re­search, or believers embodying in their lives a commitment to social justice. These are indi­viduals the University chooses as images ofit­self, to be embraced by a public that longs to see heroism reflected in its symbols. The ath­lete, the scholar, the priest-these are symbols underlying the reputation of Notre Dame as "the premiere Catholic university" in the U.S. Except for the case of the priest, sexuality is not hinted at in the depiction of these sym­bolic figures -and in the case of the priest his 
vow ofcelibacy is honored in allowing him to channel his sexual energy into pursuits which will induce an improvement in the spiritual lives of his followers. The point is that in describing heroes, their sexuality is often out of the portrait. And frankly that's perhaps the way it should be since their sexuality has little to do with their accomplishments. 

But a gay person doesn't quite fit this portrait ofa hero. A gay man or a lesbian -as a fact of the "unfreedom" which continues to hound his or her life-is often defined by soci­ety by his or her sexuality. It is like being told to forget something specific -the more you are told to forget it the more likely you are to remember it. To society, a gay person is a con­stant reminder ofsexuality-whether the indi­vidual is sexually active or not, once society learns of an individual's homosexuality it becomes for society the salient characteristic of the person. 
Certainly there are cases of very talented individuals transcending such a societal obsession, but with people like Jim, rising above the label and its pejorative implications is a herculean task for which they lack the power. And the fear ofhaving to attempt such a difficult transcendence keeps many from re­vealing their true selves. Uke society, Notre Dame -given its particularly religious nature · chooses to leave sexuality out ofthe picture. 
Jim graduated from Notre Dame in May and returned to his home in Maryland. When he was a sophomore he had told his family of his sexual nature and his family had told him to get some help. He went into therapy for a while and the subject was never formally mentioned again. 
During his last two years at Notre Damejim was frank with his close friends about his true nature -but with the campus-at-large he felt constrained to conceal himself. To reveal gay­ness on this campus is to remove yourself from the potential hero's place that may await you. By not masking your gayness you are recalling to all that we are sexual beings (no matter your preferences) and such a reminder is unwelcome on this parietal-minded campus. You are no longer eligible for the favored place at the family table, and you now become invisible. 
Jim went home this summer and found his family shocked to learn that he was still gay. They had assumed that through therapy and the countless "heroes" surrounding him here at Notre Dame, this aberrant sexual "phase" 
was guaranteed to have passed quietly into 
the night. His family ordered him to "behave" 
or leave. By "behave" his family meant for him 
to model himself on the heroes -asexually as 
they are portrayed -of Notre Dame. After all, 
they said, that's why we sent you to Notre 
Dame, where there are so many fine role 
models from which to choose. 
Today Jim is looking for work in New York City. He is very much alone and invisible. And one wonders if somehow Notre Dame could have been more helpful to him during his stay here. 
Some might say that Notre Dame did help him by not presenting a false world to him, by not presenting a world where his gayness did not matter. Notre Dame, they might say, taught him the best lesson: that to survive in the cold world and to be gay he would have to mask certain parts of his portrait. He would have to pretend to be something other than he 
actually is. 

But perhaps Notre Dame could have taught him a better lesson: that iflater he truly would have to deny certain portions ofhimself, allow certain aspects ofhis character to become in­visible, ifhe were to have felt the freedom to explore his identity entirely -to have dis-

covered the roots of his drives and needs -he 
might be better equipped today in being a 
more secure individual in negotiating the nar­
row path to happiness away from the Dome. 
If Jim had been relieved of the worry of someone's discovering his genuine nature, if he had been free to expend his energies en­tirely in the pursuit ofbecoming the authenti­cally heroic Jim, if he had been exposed at Notre Dame to role models whose sexuality was included among their many human char­acteristics, perhaps Jim might be a stronger individual today -strong enough to withstand the abandonment by his family, strengthened in the knowledge that the Notre Dame family had supported him as a student and would continue to support him as an alumnus.

Sir Obnoxious for president 

by Joe Kapitan 
features staffwriter 
by Marc Ramirez 
features columnist 
Believe me, annoying ones, it was never among Sir Obnoxious' intentions to have to do such a thing, but it appears there is no altern­ative. Sir Obnoxious must do what is in his power to aid this wretched country. Therefore, you little rugrats, he hereby declares, at this obnoxiously late date, his candidacy for president of the United States. 
Sir Obnoxious realizes that he has a mere three weeks to campaign 
for this high and mighty position, and so he will have to move fast. 
Worry not, for every political move has been planned with careful 
precision. 
First, let Sir Obnoxious briefly present his platform. Ask him about 
any issue. Religion and politics? He's for them. The federal budget 
deficit? Make it bigger. Nuclear arms? The better to play practical 
jokes on countries with. 
What does Sir Obnoxious plan to accomplish in the next four 
years if elected? Legalize bigamy. Make Frisbee an Olympic sport. 
De-franchise the Dallas Cowboys. Create a Department of Tactless­
ness to promote and research rudeness. These are just for starters. 
Secondly, Sir Obnoxious must make his financial disclosures. Sir 
Obnoxious is not ashamed -he is poor. He has no ownership in any 
companies whatsoever. He makes money the old-fashioned way: he 
borrows it. When he gets a job, he pays it back. Employment in the 
past has included a cashiering position at K-Mart, photographer for 
Penthouse magazine, and public relations man for Motley Crue. Sir 
Obnoxious estimates his worth at approximately two thousand dol­
lars, but ifyou include his secret estate in Beverly Hills, then he runs 
somewhere up in the millions. 
Thirdly, since the two "major" candidates have quite a head start 
on Sir Obnoxious, drastic actions will have to be taken in order to 
make up for lost ground. 
Excerpts from the Mondale/Reagan/Si.rObnoxiousdebates: 
Wbat isyourstand on Latin America? 
Reagan: My stand on Latin America? Uh, well, I uh ... 
Mondale: Latin America's not going to push me around, no sir, no 
way, no how. Nope. And ifthey think they are, well they've got an­
other thing coming. · 
Sir Obnoxious: Latin American countries can push me around all 
they want. lbey can insult the United States and my family heritage. 
They can send illegal aliens into the country by the shipload. They 
can even threaten us with more. And then, after they've done all that. 
I'll just call out Air Force One and blow them offthe face ofthe Earth. 
Wbat do youplan to do in the way oftaxation? 
Reagan: Taxation? Uh, well, I uh ... 
Mondale: I've explained that many times, and I see no need to repeat it for this silly debate. What is this Sir Obnoxious character anyway? And who's his running mate? 
Sir Obnoxious: Ifyou must know, I have selected Howard Cosell to be the next vice president of the United States, and he has gra­ciously accepted the offer as he is lookingfor something to do. About taxation, I plan to tax anything which I consider wimpish or reeking of excessive politeness. Examples, of course, would be Cabbage Patch dolls, McDonald's restaurants, Air Supply records and tapes, and Old Milwaukee beer. 
Wbat question wouldyou mostlike to ask the othercandidates? 
Reagan: Who does your hair? Ha ha, just kidding. Just a little joke, 
heh heh. No, really, I was just kidding. 
Mondale: Why do you hate me so much? What did I ever do to 
you? Do you really want to hurt me? Do you really want to make me 
cry? . 
Sir Obnoxious: You guys call yourselves a choice? I'd have an 
easier time picking between Kenny Rogers and Julio Iglesias. You 
want to know why I hate you, Fritz? Same reason everyone else does. 
Your schnozz is simply too big. And Ronnie, who does your hair? No 
joke. 
Excerpts from the "Sir Obnoxious for President" commer­
cial: 
... and what does Ronald Reagan believe? Ronald Reagan believes in Santa Claus. And he believes in the Tooth Fairy. But most impor­tant, he believes he can win an election bysmilingand not answering any hard questions. And he's probably right. And what does Walter Mondale believe? Well, who knows what Walter Mondale believes, but Sir Obnoxious believes that Walter Mondale's nose is too big. Way too big. So, ifyou don't want an old geezer in the White House who'll blow up the sales tax and die within the next four years, and if you don't want a parrot with a very large beak there either, cast your vote for Sir Obnoxious, the leader America needs. Just take a look at who he's running against. 
Sir Obnoxious: 
I watched you debate against Mondale and Reagan the other night, and the vice presidential candidates weren't really touched on. I was just curious -what do you think oftheir running mates? 
A member ofthe Socially Unacceptable Party Dear member: 
Sir Obnoxious does not wish to touch either of the candidates. If Walter was going to pick a woman, h~ should have selected a saucy young vixen such as Phoebe Cates. Or perhaps Vanessa Williams. I mean, she was Miss America and all. And George Bush? Well, Sir Obnoxious does commend his wife for her comment about Ferraro, when she said Ferraro was a -well, she couldn't say it, she said, but it rhymed with "rich." And Sir Obnoxious would respect Mrs. Bush even more if, in Sir Obnoxious' humble opinion, she weren't such an ·well, Sir Obnoxious can't say it, but it rhymes with "old bag." 

Forum focus: Domer dining 
W
hen one writes a column such as this one, the author sometimes fails to realize that readers can easily become sick and tired oflistening to his or her own ideas and opinions. Four large men with clubs helped me to see the light yesterday, and I would like to show them my appreciation by trying something new. I've decided to start a feature's column entitled "lbe Forum," in which readers will see a variety ofideas and opinions on various topics. 
Here's what people had to say about this week's topic -the Notre Dame Dining Halls: 
"Definitely a viable social alterna­tive. It's a great place for respon­sible social gatherings. By the way, something has to be done about that salad "bar." 
-The Alcohol Committee 

"I never thought I'd be writing to you, but something happened at work last week that changed all that. I was alone in my office when my boss' secretary, Lola, walked in. 
·OOPS· WRONG FORUM! 

"Where's the beef?" -ClaraPellet 
"I don't baby the students -I feed them the same way I feed my own family. Leftovers are an unpleasant fact oflife." -The Director ofND Food 
Services 

"I could swear I've seen that meat-like substance before." -an observantstudent 
"Don't eat and drive. The life you save may be your own." -South Bend Pollee Dept. 
"Lettuce out ofhere!" -a diningball worker 
"They've got a great team in there this year." -Gerry Faust 
"What is really in noodlebake?" -Ripley's Believe Itor Not 
"No, they don't have toast-on-a­stick, but they do serve smelt -and we all know just how painful that can be." 
-David Letterman 

"We've really enjoyed doing business with them." -Soybean Growers ofAmerica

A
s I think most people know, the word "stud" refers to a special breed ofhorse or mare that is kept for the special purpose ofbreeding. Over the years, the word has ex­panded its meaning to include those males who pride themselves on their relations with females. Funny, some are only legends in their own minds. 
Last year, Potsy (fictional name from theHappy Days character which I will use to protect the stud's identity), in his big freshman year (which some contend has never ended), developed an intense letter correspondence with a girl he met the summer before while vacationing in Ireland. To those that knew him, it seemed that almost every day Potsy would be reading a new letter from "His Love." Her letters would arrive in cutesy pink or yellow envelopes, drenched with perfume the smell ofwhich would fumigate the corridors around our section. lbe odor ofthat "special" aphrodisiac came to cloud Potsy's mind. 
As time passed and the fog started toPticken, mere notes were simply not enough for Potsy and "His _ Love." Thus, phone calls between them (she goes to school in North Carolina) increased in frequency and length throughout the first half ofthe second semester. For hours they would talk about "things." The bubble was expanding at a tremen­dous rate. Anyway, there must have been some substance to their conversations. In late March, Potsy announced to us that somehow he would find a way tO" visit the beloved one over Easter break. This "somehow" was a big one since Potsy was absolutely broke at the time and had only a slim chance of catching a ride that would take him anywhere near North Carolina. Also, any expedition of this sort would have to be done without mom and dad's knowledge ofit. 
Still, when one is in love, I guess any feat is possible. Amazingly, Potsy was able to attain a sizable loan providing him with the necessary funds. Against the odds, he took off on a solo fourteen hour journey in a rented car to finally reunite with "His Love". 
While spending Easter back at home in New York, I occassionally would chuckle inside wondering about Potsy's fate. All I could do was wait for his triumphant return late Sunday night. When Potsy finally returned back to his room, 
The Near Side 
"Why should they change? They're doing a great job a.., it is." -a spokesman for Domino's 
Pizza 
"Their chili has definite possibili­
ties as the weapon ofthe future. 
The Russians are scared." 
-the Pentagon 
"I love the food -especially those 
tofu vegetables. I regret that my 
travelling causes me to miss many 
ofthe meals." 
-Father Theodore Hesburgh 
"I don't really like the food ­
especially those tofu vegetables. I 
wish there was a way I could get off 
campus more often and miss a few 
meals." 
-a South Quadfreshman 
"I would really like to know what's in those tofu vegetables." -a curious senior 
"No you wouldn't." -a dining hall cook 
"We don't know nothin', we only eat there." -the rest ofus 
Well, what more can I say? Cer­tainly food for thought, isn't it? Sorry about that, but I couldn't resist. Anyway, I'm starving, so I am going to go to the South Dini... uh, Wendy's for some food. Why do I get the feeling that I'll see you there? 
suddenly screamed, "She gained thirty pounds and watches profes­sional wrestling!" With this out­burst, all ofus broke down laughing. Obviously, pre-season hype is a common problem here at Notre Dame. 
Poor Potsy.A clear-cut and tragic victim ofcupid's arrow. But don't worry, Cupid's shot was definitely not fatal. According to the latest reports, Potsy is planning a west coast expedition this fall break to meet up with a cheerleader who has a whirlpool.

;pirit of Notre Dame football weekends 

It seems that nothing can keep us from enjoying our home football weekends. Not rain. Not the alcohol policy. Not even losing to Air Force. Absolutely nothing. 
This collection of photos from the last three football weekends gives testament to the fact that the Fighting Irish spirit never fails. The encouragement from our cheerleaders has continually kept us cheering, and the songs from the band have even moved us enough to get us to stand up during halftime. And if you've ever caught a glimpse of our band majorette, julie Schwebel, you know that she's never without a smile. 
We owe a great deal of thanks to our parents and assorted alumni friends who sponsored all those tailgaters that gave us a chance to do some partying on an otherwise partyless campus. Especially grateful is this partier, Chris Almon, get­ting by with a little help from his friends. 


., 
And last, but not least, is that talented little guy who returns to campus for every home game to show offhis football skills on the South Quad. Here we see him successfully recovering th~ fumble. Eat your heart out, Steve. 
And remember --keep the wave rolling!

NCAA confirms Phelps' allegations of cheating 
ByJEFF BLUMB 
AssistantSports Edttor 
Notre Dame basketball coach Dig· ger Phelps had to be feeling some­what satisfied this weekend after Walter Byers, executive director of the National Collegiate Athletic As­sociation, admitted Phelps was right two and one-half years ago when he made allegations of cash payments to athletes. 
Phelps, who alleged that a stan­dard rate of $10,000 a year was being paid to outstanding basketball players by a number of colleges, made his statements at the Final Four in March of 198.2 in New Or­leans. At the time, Phelps was sharply criticized by his peers for making his comments when he did. 
However, Saturday, in an inter­view with The New York Times, Byers acknowledged the truth in Phelps' remarks, saying additionally that Phelps had underestimated the amounts of the cash payments. 
"I didn't believe it at the time and I believe it now," Byers told Peter Al­fano ofTbe Times. "I won't speak to a sport, but to the value of the money. And we've had people tell us on a

Ifyou've gone to college on a National Direct Student Loan, a Guaranteed Student Loan or a Federally Insured Student Loan made after October 1, 1975, and your loan is not in default, here's a way to get your loan repaid. 
Use the Army's Loan Repayment program. Each year you serve on active duty reduces your indebtedness by one-third or $1500, whichever amount is greater. In a three-year enlistment, you eliminate your debt. 
Additionally, you could learn a valuable skill and take advantage of many other Army opportunities. Ifyou have the time, we have the money.

confidential basis that it's more than that." 
"When I made those statements," Phelps said yesterday, "I was just talking about things that I had talked about for years. I knew that time was in my favor. Those (in the coaching ranks) knew what I was talking about. But we still haven't com­pleted the mission." 
Byers made his statements in light of a growing awareness nationwide of the number of recruiting viola­tions presently taking place. 
"We're not keeping up with the chase," Byers said. "I've talked with our representatives and people I respect and the problem is much worse than I thought." 
Byers, who has been executive director of the NCAA since 1951, also addressed the issue of schools which break the rules and yet do not feel any remorse. 
"I will say that it bothers a lot of our people who sense a lessening of resolve among coaches that the rules are enforced," the 62-year-old Byers said. "Fewer coaches are will­ing to cooperate." 
The "younger generation" of coaches is somewhat less cooperative, Byers added. 
Still, Byers also feels that those in­volved with college athletics will do something soon to rectify the pres­ent problem situation. 
"I have the belief that ·an over­whelming number of people -the presidents, athletic directors, fac, ulty and coaches -want a better world in intercollegiate athletics," said the administrator of 791 mem­ber institutions. "I think they will embrace a new order. 
"In a society, there will be chronic violators in any system. But I think this is worth the effort. With a con­scientious re-evaluation... it could very well work. Ifit doesn't, then in-

tercollegiate athletics could be

"There's one way to handle it," 
contended Phelps in an interview 
with The Observer early last month. 
"If Byers would come out and just 
burn a few people good -with con­
sistency, and I mean the big powers­
it would stop. Stiffer penalties are 
what we need. 
"Obviously, it's not working now, 
is it? What we're doing now is noth­

"The penalties aren't severe enough. 
The academic credibility is not

Athlete says he was offered car 
Assodated Press 
DALLAS -Keith Slanberry ofOkla­homa, a leading recruit in 1981, says he might be playing for Southern Methodist University if an SMU alumnus had not offered him cash and a car to sign with the school. 
"I feel like he was trying to buy me and I didn't want to be put in that position," Stanberry · said. "Oklahoma didn't offer me anything and Texas didn't offer me anything. SMU was the only one that came at me like that." 
The Mount Pleasant defensive back is now a senior at Oklahoma. He told his story last year to the Na­tional Collegiate Athletic Associa­tion, which has been investigating the SMU athletic program and alumni recruiting for 20 months. 

Stanberry told The Dallas Times Herald the offer was made by William Means Jr. of Mount Pleasant, a 1971 SMU graduate who was a loan officer and vice president ofa Mount Pleasant bank at the time. 
"He said, 'What kind of car do you like?' I said, '280Z.' He said, 'You can have that ifyou sign with us,"' Stan­berry said. 
Means denies making the offers and says he did not even try to recruit Stanberry for SMU. 
Stanberry also says Means offered him a II0-an-hour summer job "to do nothing" except work out and lift weights.

comparison to last weekend when 
the Irish were overcome in their 
own backyard. 
"I was not pleased with our per­formance against Western Michigan at all," said Petro. "I didn't think we gave them a very strong effort. It ap­peared as if Western Michigan wanted it more than we did and we weren't willing to give that extra bit of effon that it would take to beat them. If we would have given a stronger effort, we would have won the tournament." 
Despite taking the North Star Con­ference Championship and receiv­ing early predictions of a Division II National Championship in women's tennis, Petro is now hesitant to predict that the Irish will even make it to the final tournament unless they strenghten their play and become more aggressive on the court. 
"As I discussed after our Irish Invi­tational with my players, I'm no longer talking national champion­ship," said Petro. "Not that it's out of the question-I'm not saying that-but as displeased as I was with their per­formance at the Irish Invitational, I suggested that they'd better be working a litde harder. Unless they get their act together, I'm not even talking national tournament. 
"I think we have the potential for 

it (the national title) and that's what ·we're going to do -maximize our po­tential because that's always been 
my goal since I've been coaching."

At Bethel College 

SMC volleyball wins two matches 
By KELLY PORTOLESE 
Sports Writer 
Last Thursday the Saint Mary's vol­leyball team travelled across town to Bethel College. where the Belles picked up two victories. 
In the first match Saint Mary's defeated a tough team from Trinity Christian College of Chicago, 1 5-12, 13-15, 15-13. The Belles then topped host Bethel, 15-4, 15-7. 
Saint Mary's Coach Brian Goralski said Trinity is one ofthe tallest teams he has seen. The squad's height ranged between 6-0 and 6-3, which 
obviously  helped  against  Saint  
Mary's  at  the  net.  The  Belles,  
however,  were  not  to  be  in­ 
timidated.  

"We adjusted pretty well," com­mented Goralski, "and we kept the ball in play every time they hit over our block." 
Although Trinity had the height advantage, the Saint Mary's coach said he feels the Belles had the upper edge in technique. The match was "good for our defense," Goralski said, referring to the team's excel­lent digging abilities which kept the match close. After splitting the first two games, 

The Belles found themselves down, 13-8, in the rubber game of the match. Senior Ann Boutton and freshman Anne Williard rose to the occasion and responded with their powerful serves to lift the team to its twelfth victory ofthe season. 
"(The Belles) proved they came 
out to play ball," Goralski said, citing 
sophomore Patty Williams for her 
nice outside shots when the pres­
sure was on.· 

Coming off the grueling two hour match with Trinity, th~ Belles con­tinued to play well as they disposed of Bethel in straight games for the second time this season. 
Goralski credited Bethel with im­proving since the two teams met earlier in the year, but he also said the Belles have been improving even more. He said he felt each indi­vidual player put forth a "good all­around effort " He particularly noted the consistent play ofBoutton and freshman Mary Carole Feldman. 
Saint Mary's season record now stands at 13-5. The Belles will at­tempt to improve this record against Ancilla College of Donaldson, Ind.,

In NAIA action, the Belles have only one loss in nine outings and a victory over Huntington could lock up a spot for them in the district tournament.

Detroit wins World Series on Gibson's homers 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -The Detroit Tigers 
capped a classic runaway season and 
captured their first World Series 
since 1968 by defeating the San 
Diego Padres 8-4 yesterday in the 
fifth game, as Kirk Gibson drove in 
five runs with two homers. 
Gibson's second homer, in the 
eighth inning, came off relief ace 
Goose Gossage, who had not 
allowed a run in seven previous 
World Series appearances. Lance 
Parrish also homered off Gossage in 
the seventh inning. 
The victory completed a three­

game sweep of the Padres at Tiger 
Stadium after the two teams had split 
at San Diego. 
The American League champions in the final game unveiled a potent offense that led the major leagues with 829 runs and 187 homers during the season. They combined the timely hitting of Gibson in this game, Alan Trammell throughout the Series and two complete-game , victories byJack Morris to dominate the Padres. Trammell went 0-for-4 
Sunday, but he still hit .450 with six RBI's in the Series. 
The Tigers also took advantage of shoddy Padre fielding and baserun­ning to turn a game that was tied at 3-3 into a runaway. 
Sparky Anderson became the first manager to win World Series titles in both leagues. Anderson managed Cincinnati of the National League to World Series titles in 1975 and 1976. 
The Tigers finally saw their start­ing pitchingfail in this game -a prob­lem that had plagued San Diego throughout the Series -but Aurelio 
Lopez bailed  the Tigers out  with  
some  overpowering  relief,  and  
Willie Hernandez finished up.  

Gibson, the AL playoff MVP, had slumped early in the Series, but he quickly made up for it with a two­run, upperdeck homer in Detroit's three-run first inning. He then scored from third on a shallow fly ball to right field to break a 3-3 tie in the fifth inning. 
Left-bander Mark Thurmond lasted only one-third ofan inning for the Padres, giving up those three first-inning runs, but the telling run

came off Andy Hawkins, who had 
pitched 12 innings ofreliefin this Se­
ries before gi'-:ing up a run. 
When Thurmond left, San Diego 

starters in the five games had 
worked a total of only I 0-and-one­
third innings, giving up 16 runs for a 
13-94 ERA. 
Gibson led off the winning inning 

with a single off the glove of Padres 
third baseman Graig Nettles. He 
went to second on a fly, and Hawkins 
then walked Larry Herndon on four 
pitches. 
Craig Lefferts relieved Hawkins 

and walked Chet Lemon to load the 
bases. Pinch-hitter Rusty Kuntz then 
popped up to shallow right field. 
Tony Gwynn moved in from his out­
field position, and second baseman 
Alan Wiggins moved out. Wiggins 
called Gwynn off the ball and made 
the catch whiJe still backpedalling. 
Wiggins made the catch above his 

head, stopped his momentum and 
With two homers 
threw, but it was too late to catch Gibson racing home with the clinch­ing run. 
The victory capped a season that saw the Tigers become only the third team, and the first since the 1927 Yankees, to go wire-to-wire in first place. The Tigers won a club­record I04 games, clinched the American League East on Sept. 18 and swept Kansas City in three games in the AL playoffs. 
Lopez, meanwhile, entered the game with one on and two out in the fifth inning and struck out Kurt Bevacqua to retire the ·side. He struck out four and didn't allow a hit the rest ofthe way. 
Thurmond, 14-8 in the season, was the second Padres starter to last less than one inning when he was pulled after getting just one out in the first, yielding three runs on five hits. Ed Whitson went two-thirds of 
an inning in San Diego's Game Two 
victory. 
Leadoff man Lou Whitaker started 
the Tigers first when he singled. 
Trammell hit into a fielder's choice 
before Gibson.came to the plate.He 
homered on the second pitch. 
Parrish followed with a single and stole second as Padres catcher Terry Kennedy was unable to get the ball out ofhis glove quickly enough. Par­rish moved to third when Larry Herndon singled to center, and Chet Lemon followed with a single that scored Parrish with the third run of the inning. 
That chased Thurmond for Haw­kins and gave the Tigers a 3-0 lead. 
Petry finally yielded a run in the third on two infield hits, and the Padres tied the score 3-3 in the fourth.

Gibs.on changes jeers to cheers 
Assodated Press 
DETROIT -Detroit slugger Kirk Gibson, booed by Tiger fans just a year ago, turned the jeers to cheers Sunday night. 
Gibson slugged two homers, driving in five runs, to lead the Tigers to an 8-4 victory over the San

Q. in the field a year ago, hitting only -6' .227 with 15 home runs and 51 g RBI's. This year, he finished the regu­
lar season batting .282 with 27 homers, 91 RBI's and 20 stolen bases. 
"Sometimes I'm a little too in­tense," Gibson said as he gulped a can of beer, eschewing the tradi­tional champagne which his teammates were pouring over one another. "When the game's on the line, I want to be at the plate. That's what I dream of. My concentration seems to be greater when the situa­tion is tighter." 
Gibson told of how he put extra pressure on himself in the Detroit eighth while on deck. Detroit manager Sparky Anderson signaled that Padres reliever Rich Gossage would probably walk him. 
Using hand signals, Gibson said he disagreed, bet Anderson S10 that Gossage would pitch to him and that he would hit a homer_ 
Anderson undoubtedly won't mind coughing up the S I o_ 
Detroit centerfielder Chet Lemon noted that it wasn't until Game Five of the World Series that the Tigers finally showed the balance that marked their spectacular season. 
"I think the key to a good ball club is being able to close the door," Lemon said. "We started doing that in Toronto in September, and then in Baltimore, in Kansas City and now we've closed the door on San Diego. The bottom line is that we played great defense, hit with power and got great pitching." 
jack Morris, the hard-throwing right-hander who won two World Series games, said he wasn't sure how history would judge the I984 Tigers. 
"I guess that's up to the public," Morris said. "But, they can never take this away from us. It's a reliefto have it over. I never realized win-
