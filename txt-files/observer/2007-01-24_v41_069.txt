ByJOHN TIERNEY and KAITLYNN RIELY News Writers 
U.S. President George W. Bush's State of the Union address Tuesday night came at a time when his approval rat­ings are low and Republicans and Democrats alike are ques­tioning his recently announced plan to send more than 20,000 new troops to Iraq. 
Bush reiterated his optimism about his recent decision to deploy more troops to Iraq as he appeared before the joint session of Congress and mil­lions of Americans looked on ­among those Notre Dame stu­

Tvvo tickets face off in SMC race 
Davis-Kennedy first pair to be eliminated 
By KELLY MEEHAN Saint Mary's Editor 
The Annie Davis-Courtney Kennedy ticket was the first elim­inated Tuesday from the three­way race for the helm of Saint Mary's student government. 
While that pair clinched 24 per­cent of the vote, the Colleen Ferreira-Jenny Antonelli and Kim Hodges-Kelly Payne tickets are competing in the runoff election that began at 12:01 this morning and will end at 11:59 tonight. Percentages will not come into play during the runoff calcula­tions -meaning the pair with the most votes wins. 
With approximately 35 percent of the student body voting, Ferreira-Antonelli received 38.3 percent of the vote-a mere 1.9 percent more than Hodges­Payne, at 36.4 percent. The nar­row lead, candidates said, makes the opportunity to campaign for the runoff more valuable than ever. 
''I'm optimistic that we'll get more voters," Hodges said. "I think our biggest draw is the open forum meetings where stu­dents will be able to voice con­cerns, comments and what's in their hearts." 
While Hodges and Payne announced their promises and catered to voters with free cook­ies outside Noble Family Dining Hall Tuesday, Ferreira-Antonelli did not let their lead overlook the need to continue their campaign.

Coalition reexamines Lunch Fast program 
By STEVE KERINS 
News Writer 
It has been more than 30 years since the World Hunger Coalition {WHC) began to con­front Notre Dame students with the stark realities of mal­nutrition in some of the poor­est nations on earth. 
Now, after watching partici­pation slacken in its signature Wednesday Lunch Fast pro­gram, the Coalition is prepar­ing to renew its commitments to feeding the hungry and rais­ing awareness by encouraging student involvement in new ways. 
"We do our best to fight hunger," said the group's pres­ident, junior Jessica Pillarella. "One of the best things about us is that we steer clear of the politics ... I think anyone can agree that feeding the hungry is a good thing." 
The WHC's primary activity on campus is the Wednesday Lunch Fast, in which students pledge to donate one meal per week from their meal plans. The money from the unused lunch is then given to the WHC, which forwards it to organiza­tions dedicated to stamping out hunger. 
"The Wednesday Lunch Fast, for a low semester, it brings in $8,000," Pillarella said. "For a great semester we'll bring in

'W~st Wing' actor visits College 
By LAURA BAUMGARTNER 
News Writer 
Renowned actor, playwright, author and producer Anna Deavere Smith, known for her roles in "The West Wing," "The Practice," "Philadelphia" and "The Americ­
an President," is a featured guest lecturer of the Saint Mary's com­munication and perform­ance studies department 

this week. Smith 
The College prepared for Smith's arrival by introducing her work to the community -it hosted a free screening of the film "Twilight Los Angeles," based on Smith's Obie award-winning one­woman play, at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday night in Vander Vennet Theater. 
As a theatre major, senior Rachel Sokolowski said she has especially looked forward to Smith's visit. 
"After graduation [theatre majors] have a huge variety of options, and it's definitely excit­ing to see someone who's taken herself so far in her field," she said. "It's very inspiring to have her come and share her thoughts." 
Smith will present a series of lectures open to the public over a three-day period. Assistant professor of communication and performance studies Colleen Fitzpatrick said Smith's first presentation, "The Art of Listening," will be targeted toward tbeatre majors. 

"Smith will be working with the theatre students and actu­ally running an interactive class with them," she said. "I think it will be a great experi­ence for the students and will really give Smith the opportu­nity to engage with our stu­dents." 
Fitzpatrick also said Smith will be having lunch exclusively with the students of the theatre department. 
Theatre department chair John Pauley said he hopes Smith's visit will "open stu­dents' eyes to think about pos­sibilities they might not have thought about," especially those considering a career in the performance arts.

ESP 111e 
Apple has once again excited gadget geeks and businessmen alike by unveil­ing the iPhone, which, in his demo of the new product, Apple CEO Steve Jobs so eloquently described as "cool" and "awesome." 
Jeff Albert 
Watching the keynote demo on Apple's Web site 
Graphics
got me thinking 
Editor
about the way the 
transfer of infor­
mation is constantly being revolution­
ized. 
Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, the cre­ators ofYouTube, gave the world a new outlet for conveying information (whether viewers find it relevant or ridiculous). But beyond the simple con­veying of information, I am consistently struck by how quickly the knowledge of a particular video can spread, especially at a place like a college campus (think: "OMG-shoes."). 
Since people seem to be taking it upon themselves to use these contrivances to establish communities, small or large, where they can interact with like-mind­ed individuals, it seems more than likely that product designers will actually put the establishment of these communities at the forefront of their future designs. Virgin America has designed an in-flight entertainment system that, among other things, would allow passengers to email/SMSfmstant message among themselves, creating an airborne com­munity. 
With the arrival of Web 2.0 (which encourages community and user-gener­ated content), and talk of Web 3.0 (a "Semantic Web"), a man by the name of Seth Godin has proposed a Web4, where the network would take initiative based on the way a person uses the Internet. It's a smarter Internet that takes into account how a person has previously behaved online, and proposes the best way to go about any particular internet task. 
It would perform autonomous search­es that could benefit you (for example, just as you're about to order the latest TV-on-DVD boxed set, Web4 steps in and informs you of a cheaper price on another site). 
Additionally, the network would be aware of a person's activities that are similar to others, and would be able to put those people in touch. Essentially, it would consist of a network of "machines talking to machines." 
This is where I would like to step in and suggest the future of community­based technology-extra-sensory per­ception, or ESP. Well, sort of. More like the ability for people in a network to access each others' thoughts, and, in a way, brainstorm. 
ESP is not some revolutionary new technology, and science isn't even sure it exists. But ifthe concept of ESP could be applied in technological terms, you would have the highest form of informa­tion communication. 
Essentially, it would be communica­tion sans effort. By allowing "machines" to do what they do best -that is, process information -and then interact with each other as well as with each particular user, a powerful network without rival will have been created. 
Microsoft's Zune allows sharing of music within a local network -so why can't that technology be applied directly to our mind's thoughts? 
Just think: In the future, you may hear your best friend say, "ESP me."

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 



Organizations' funds reviewed 
BySONIARAO 
News Wrirer 
Members of the Council of Representatives (COR) reviewed the 2006-07 reallocation budget in a brief meeting Tuesday night in LaFortune. 
The total budget of $41,037 was allocated to various organizations, including a $3,000 reim­bursement of the technology fund. 
"[The reallocation] is really a spending review and not a reallocation per se," said Student Union assistant treasurer Kadeja Gaines, who added that the treasury reserves the right to take money away from organizations that have not been spending requested funds. 
In the case of this semester, $3,000 was reallo­cated from the Class of 2007 funds to Senior Week, Gaines said. In addition, Judicial Council received $1,000, student government $5,000 and Student Union Board $21,018.90. 
In other COR news: 
The Class Councils of 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were the collective "Organization Spotlight" for the week. Each class president took a turn describing recent and upcoming events for his/her class, including new freshman T-shirts, a service opportunity at a local soup kitchen for sophomores, care packages for transfer students, the junior class' Holy Half Marathon and future alumni events for seniors. Most notably was the. recent Freshman Class Mass, which drew partici­pation from 600 class members.

Hispanic Outlook honors SMC 
College one of eight Ind. schools chosen for providing opportunities 
By KATIE KOHLER 
News Wrirer 

Saint Mary's recently joined the ranks of only eight Indiana colleges and universities to be recognized by Hispanic Outlook magazine for providing the best educational opportunities for Hispanics. The publication hon­ored schools from each state by placing them on the 2006 Publisher's Pick List. Notre Dame was also included. 
For Saint Mary's to be included · in a list like this is an honor, said Melanie McDonald, director of media relations at the College. 
"Schools are selected based on interviews with students of the institution," she said. "The Saint Mary's students surveyed obvi­ously felt supported and felt that a network of programs and peo­ple are in place at the College to make a Latin·a student's experi­ence at Saint Mary's a positive one." 
With the aid of the National Center for Education Statistics, Hispanic Outlook compiles the list each year using student sur­veys as well as an important cal­culation: the number of degrees granted in proportion to the Hispanic population at the insti­tution. The list represents the magazine's "latest and b.est thinking about which colleges and universities offer Hispanic students a solid chance of aca­demic success," publisher Jose L6pez-Isa said on the magazine's Web site. 
The Admissions Department at Saint Mary's has been working diligently to increase diversity on campus. This fall, the Office for Enrollment Management pre­sented the most diverse class in 15 years, according to McDonald. 
"Prospective Latina students, who make up a portion of that underrepresented [minority] group, are learning that Saint Mary's offers support to Hispanic students in many forms," McDonald said. 
Latina students have various campus organizations and offices that cater to their continued suc­cess, such as the Office of Multicultural Affairs, the Center for Women's InterCultural Leadership, the Mexico Study Tour, the Student Diversity Board and La Fuerza, a student­run group. 
Jeanne Choquehuanca, co­president of La Fuerza, sees inclusion on this list as a way for Saint Mary's to distinguish itself from other institutions. 
"The honors tell us that we are making a difference in our efforts for greater diversity and tolerance," she said. "Still, there is an obvious lack of diversity at our colle·ge, and this award hopefully will not indicate to our community that efforts for greater diversity should lessen." 
La Fuerza works to promote Latina culture both on and off campus. 
"This organization especially aims to reach out to incoming Latina· and minority students. These efforts are sometimes dif­ficult, but we always extend our welcome and support to all stu­dents," Choquehuanca said. 
Veronica Dominguez, a sopho­more Latina student at the College, said Saint Mary's offers a welcoming environment -to all its students. 
"I do not feel that Saint Mary's is only a good environment for Hispanics. It is a caring environ­ment with the common goal of preparin~ strong women for the future," she said. 
This recognition by Hispanic Outlook is not the first distinc­tion for the College regarding academic rankings. 
"Just like our number one ranking by U.S. News & World Report, recognition by Hispanic Outlook brings news of our excellence to a broader audi­ence," McDonald said. 
Hispanic Outlook Magazine has served as the premier news source for Hispanic education in higher education for 17 years. Published biweekly, the maga­zine reaches approximately 50,000 readers annually.

Ethiopian troops start to withdraw 
MOGADISHU, Somalia-Ethiopian troops whose military strength was crucial to helping Somalia's government drive out a radical Islamic militia began withdrawing Tuesday, raising fears of a power vacuum unless peace­keepers arrive soon in this chaotic nation. 
Somali government spokesman Abdirahman Dinari said Ethiopia helped chase out the Council of Islamic Courts militia, which had taken over the capital and much of southern Somalia. But it was time for the neighboring forces to leave. 
"As of today, the Ethiopian troops have start­ed to withdraw from Somalia. We are grateful that they played an important role in the restoration of law and order in the country," Dinari said. 
Ethiopia's government spokesman, Zemedkun Tekle, confirmed Tuesday's pullout but gave no details. 
The intervention of Ethiopia last month enabled a military advance that proved a stun­ning turnaround for Somalia's 2-year-old gov­ernment. Without Ethiopia's tanks and fighter jets, the administration could barely assert con­trol outside one southern town and could not enter the capital.

Robert Pickton, 56, is charged with killing 26 women, mostly prostHutes and drug addicts who vanished from a drug-ridden Vancouver neighborhood in the 1990s. He has pleaded not guilty to the first six counts. A separate trial will be held for the other 20 murder charges.

Lawyer says: Ubby was sacrificed 
WASHINGTON -White House officials tried to sacrifice vice presidential aide I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby to protect strategist Karl Rove from blame for leaking a CIA operative's identity during a political storm over the Iraq war, Libby's lawyer said Tuesday. 
After Libby complained "they want me to be the sacrificial lamb," Vice President Dick Cheney personally intervened to get the White House press secretary to publicly clear Libby in the leak, defense attorney Theodore Wells said in his opening statement at Libby's perjury trial. 
The new details of behind-the-scenes conflict at top levels of the Bush White House, along with some previously unseen blunt language from Cheney, were the high points of a dramatic day in which the prosecutor and the defense dueled in multimedia statements to the jury. 
State Farm to settle Katrina lawsuits 
State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. agreed Tuesday to settle hundreds of lawsuits by policyholders and reopen and pay thou­sands of other disputed claims. a land­mark deal potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Mississippi home­owners devastated by Hurricane Katrina. 
The settlement calls for State Farm to pay about $80 million to more than 600 policyholders who sued the company for refusing to cover damage from the Aug. 29, 2005, storm. State Farm also agreed to pay at least $50 million-but possibly hundreds of millions more-to thousands of Mississippi policyholders whose claims were denied but didn't sue the company.

IN BRIEF 
Bolivian plans help raise gold prices 
NEW YORK -Gold futures hit a three-week high Tuesday as the dollar broke lower against its major rivals and news of Bolivia's possible nationalization of its mining sector hit the mar­ket. 
February gold settled up $11.80 at $645.90 a troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. During the session the contract hit a three-week high of $646.90. 
George Gero of RBC Capital Markets Global Futures said the gold rally was due in part to news that Bolivia plans to hike taxes on mining, while also saying the government may national­ize companies that violated privatization rules. 
He added that news about two gold exchange­traded funds planned in India is also adding to the upside in the market. 
'That will take more metal out of the market," said Gero. "So with all that news, the path of least resistance has been up." 
Peter Schiff, president of Euro Pacific Capital, said gold has been holding key levels over the past few weeks despite a dip in oil prices and a bounce in the dollar. · 
AK Steel jumps even with losses 
CINCINNATI -Shares of AK Steel Holding Corp. jumped nearly 10 percent on Tuesday after the steelmaker reported a wider fourth-quarter loss than a year ago but an upbeat outlook for 2007. 
"They not only had a decent fourth quarter, but their guidance for the first quarter was very strong," said industry analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research/Soleil Securities in New York. 
The company, which has a plant in Rockport, Ind., also said temporary workers hired to replace locked out union employees at its Middletown Works plant are setting production and safety records and that more workers are being hired. 
AK Steel stock rose $1.63 to $18.40 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange as the company reported a loss of $49.3 million, or 45 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with $41.5 million, or 38 cents a share, a year ago. The stock reached as high as $18.68 on Tuesday. The low for the past year has been $7.71. 
The loss for the quarter widened compared with a year ago as higher average selling prices failed to offset weaker steel shipments and increased costs.

Oil prices trigger stock rail y 
U.S. plans to-double Strategic Petroleum Reserve .create optimism for investors 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Wall Street rebounded Tuesday, rising moderately as crude oil surged more than $2 a barrel and triggered a rally among energy producers. Investors regained their optimism about corporate profits after a series of pos­itive earnings reports. 
Energy prices spiked after the Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said the 
U.S. will double the size of the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Prices were already rising as a cold snap in the northeast United States was seen increasing demand for heating fuel in the region. 
Exxon Mobil Corp. led blue chips and was among the Dow Jones industrials' biggest gainers, while fel­low refiners ConocoPhillips and Chevron Corp. also surged during the session. The advance in oil stocks helped the Dow recover from an 88-point decline Monday, its biggest drop in two months and a reaction to investor uneasiness about earnings.

New kids on the block 
The Observer has graciously decided to allow two intelligent, charming and ridiculously good-looking men (Don't believe us? Check out our facebook pro­file.) To write a bi-weekly column for the Viewpoint. In 
Zach Finterz
addition to the semi­

and
nal columns written 

Mark Poyar
by Gary Caruso, Joey Falco and Liz Coffey, 

Bulletproof
among others, you 

Ideas
will find a new one authored by yours truly, Mark Poyar and Zach Einterz. Since we are a new column this semes­ter, we thought it would be prudent to begin by introducing ourselves and our ideas. 
First, let us explain the title of our column, "Bulletproof Ideas." Our inspi­ration for this title comes from the movie "V for Vendetta." (If you have seen this movie and thought it was a good movie, possibly the best movie ever, we congratulate you. If you haven't seen this movie, you should rent it as soon as possible.) In one of the closing scenes, the anti-authoritarian hero V becomes riddled with bullets from his assailants, including Mr. Creedy, and the following dialogue ensues: 
Creedy: Die! Die! Why won't you die? ... Why won't you die? 
V: Beneath this mask there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Creedy, and ideas are bul­letproof. 
Of course, we did not choose this title because we believe that our ideas are bulletproof, or that our ar.guments are invincible, although that may be the case. We chose this title because we believe that social change has to come from ideas. Progress doesn't come from forceful coercion; .it comes from persua­sion by logic and reasoning. Unlike a Britney Spears marriage, or a dining hall meal that slides through your gut by the time you make it back to your dorm, good ideas can last forever. Our goal here is to give you some new ideas. 
We am both members of the College LibPrtarians, and as such, our columns will generally be written from a liber­tarian viewpoint. What do we mean by libertarian? Simply put, libertarians believe in the freedom or the individual. We believe that each individual has an inalienable right to life, liberty, property and self-government. We believe that the only moral function of government is to protect these inalienable rights and that government used for any other mean eonstitutes an immoral use of force. Each person should have the right to choose what is best for him­selli'herself, so long as his/her actions do not interfere with the rights of others. We also believe that the United States Constitution, as the founding document of our great Hepublic, should be regard­ed as relevant and not brushed aside to suit the political whims of a particular interest group. For a very general idea of the libertarian stance on political issues, libertarians usually oppose war, interventionism, taxes, gun control and censorship, while supporting free mar­kets, immigration and civil liberties . 
This is a very brief and broad overview of libertarianism, and we promise to elaborate in our future columns. Hopefully, by reading our columns you will be given a different look at the world. You won't only see the world as red and blue, Hepublican and Democrat. or conservative and lib­eral. We don't expect you to agree with everything we write -in fact you prob­ably won't-but at least you will have been given a new perspective on the world around you. We hope to make this a conversation of ideas, not a monologue, so please write back when you disagree with us. 
Finall~, if you find that you agree with a lot of what we have to say, don't be apathetic! Come out as a libertarian! Are you disillusioned and disenfran­chised by the current state of politics? Did you have horrible memories of put­ting your dog down as a child because he/she/it broke zoning ordinances? Do you like "South P-ark" and Clint Eastwood? If you said yes to any of the preceding questions, then you may already be a libertarian! Libertarians encompass a wide range of peoples. We include everything from anarcho-capi­talists, environmentalists, and potheads to fundamentalist Christians and athe­ists. The only thing necessary to become a libertarian is a commitment to liberty. For more information on the College Libertarians of Notn: Dame, visit our website at www.nd.edu/-liber­ty.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
A revolutionary education? 
It's a comm.on scene early in the semester: students at their computers, shuffling around their elasses, some­times dropping a course or adding another. In an attempt to fultill the University literature, music or history requirement, a student will scroll through the course descriptions searching for an interesting, or -at the very least-easy, class. It was through this search that a friend alert­ed me of certain disconcerting choices being offered to fulfill those require­ments. 
One such class fulfilling the literature requirement in the English Department is called "Decadent Modernity" (ENGL 20405). A glace at the course descrip­tion reveals that the course aims "to explore visions of decadence spanning the last two centuries and more." Students are instructed to "bring a tol­erance for the grotesque and for authors who deliberately challenge deeply held Western attitudes about morality and values." Several "literary texts, visual arts and modern cinema" are to bn considered, but the "concep­tual groundwork" is to be laid with Freud and Nietzsche. 
I choose this particular class -there are several others -because I feel it well exemplifies many of the humani­ties courses being offered at universi­ties across the nation. These courses appeal to students' anti-authoritarian tendencies to draw them, ironically, to a not particularly tolerant, alternative orthodoxy. "Sticking it to the rn.an," as some have put it, does not necessarily imply liberation, for what if the new· "man" who replaces the old one brings even worse tyranny? 
There must always be a "man," an authority, and those who claim to free us from all authority in reality bind us to their own. Yes, rejecting traditional values sounds enticing, but this propo­sition raises an important question: what new set of values will replace the old ones we are so emphatically encouraged to abandon? Were this pro­posed new ethos original, empowering or socially progressive, as it claims to be, it would be worth consideration. But, upon closer examination, it seems to be merely a souftle of old Gnosticism of different flavors, marinated in the arguments of 1960s Cultural revolu­tionaries and spiced with some witty quotes from the Pre-Socratics. And, added to it all, in the manner of the Fairy Godmother in the latest "Shrek" film, is "just a hint of ... lust." 
An education such as this, of course, prepares us, in a strange but certain way, to be the leaders of the Twenty­First century, to carry on the torch ­there was a torch somewhere, wasn't there? -and, in general terms, to achieve the new, recasted American dream: becoming filthy rich without getting caught.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Revisiting ethics 
at Catholic 
university 
This letter is in response to James Welle's ("Ethics and morals not syn­onomous," Jan. 23) comment, "My point is that morals cannot and should not ever be used to justify ethics." 
Whose morals are we talking about? 
As written in DuLac, the mission statement of the University of Notre Dame states, "Notre Dame's character as a Catholic academic community presupposes that no genuine search for the truth in the human or cosmic order is alien to the life of faith ... There is, however, a special obligation and opportunity, specifically as a Catholic university, to pursue the reli­gious dimensions of human learning. Only thus can Catholic intellectual life in all disciplines be animated and fostered and a proper community of scholarly religious discourse be established." 
The founders of our university believe that truth is not alien to faith; they believe that truth and morality as established by faith are not foreign to one another. The search for truth about ethics at this university should be guided by a profound understanding of Catholic morality. The mission statement also states, "A Catholic university draws its basic inspiration from Jesus Christ as the source of wisdom and from the conviction that in Him all things can be brought to their completion." All things includes the examples of ethical dilemmas James provided; the founders of this univer­sity believe that ethical decisions can be justified by the moral ideas as established by the Catholic church. Catholics cannot have separate moral and ethical stances.

Raising wage has 
consequences too 
The silence from the living wage community had gone on for far too long, apparently, as even a South Bend resident felt the need to chime in. I don't doubt Louis Myers' good intentions, but his argument is plain sophistry. Mr. Myers calls for Notre Dame to pay its employees "at least a living wage, which would be about $12/hour now." Two questions come to mind after reading this statement. 
First, should we separate wages from earnings? Notre Dame employees, like other employees in a free society, earn their wages. We cannot dictate what one earns by circumventing the market wage. 
The second involves a more alarming concern with minimum wage arguments. Myers includes the words "at least" when ordering what the administration should pay its workers. Is it not obvious that we have scarce resources in a soci­ety and, therefore, in a university? As William F. Buckley Jr. once said, "Idealism is fine, but as it approaches reality, the costs become prohibitive." 
I can only hope that those students calling for an increase in wages will not be the same ones up in arms when it forces further increases in the already astro­nomical tuition hikes. Instead of rallying behind Myers' motivational effort, let's think about what it is we are doing when we undermine basic economic princi­ples. It is through flexible, not set, prices that capitalism functions most effi­ciently. That includes the price that an employer is willing to pay a given worker for his/her labor, and I have-yet to see a worker chained to a buffet line or a mop bucket, so I can only assume that Notre Dame is offering the most competi­tive wages for the necessary skills. 
Whether one likes it or not, Notre Dame must operate as a business-not to turn a profit, but to be responsible stewards of the students' tuition dollars. There is nothing theologically sinful about adhering to the competitive, market­clearing wages already in place.

Sex is good, 
condoms or not 
Let us be frank about the fact that sex is good. In fact, sex is great. It is holy. God is a big pro­ponent. And I get the feeling that a lot of what God made is good, in and of itself, apart from its function. Creation was good before humans ever exploited it. 
I would agree with Eleanore Strong ("Contraceptive society morally harmful," Jan. 
21) that God knows best. But I take strong issue with the idea that the Catholic Church always knows best. Passive acquiescence to theology with such far-reaching implications, when the experience on the ground screams in pain for theological review, cannot be our best answer. 
Theology is the work of every man and woman trying to discern how to live their lives. I will not deny that 2,000 years of collective experience and wisdom, in many realms of life, is truly a great resource. But contraception is too new, and its theology is just being worked out at a time when there are life and death decisions riding on the Church's interpretation. 
People, including priests, make mistakes. It doesn't mean everything the Church says is wrong. Far from it. It just means we need to be careful. So with that said, the irony of the Church's position is that while attempting to uphold the sanctity of sex, it actually demeans it. Objectifies it, really, in the same way our worth as humans today tends to be tied to what we can produce for our efficient profit-driven society. For whatever reason, we are uneasy with the idea that something can be good just because it is, not because of what it can pro­duce. And the union of two people into one flesh through sex is something that is holy whether or not it can or does produce another human life. 
It is an expression of love, a very deep and binding one, and not one that condoms or a pill can even begin to defile. If you want culprits for "more abortions, fewer children, more divorce and more AIDS cases," I suggest something other than contraceptives as the scapegoat. Millions of lives are riding on that careless statement. 
Try looking at our society of material deca­dence, where we exploit what we want from people and the environment, and then discard without thought. 
Try looking at the general commercialization of sex on TV and every other sphere of our lives. The problem is deep within each of our psyches. Fewer children can be attributed to more women in the workforce due to greater empowerment, not least of which is our greater access to education, not just reproductive con­trol. 
I cannot tell you what causes higher divorce rates, but something tells me its not just con­doms. 'And AIDS could be prevented through greater education and access to preventive tools, and less stigma associated with the virus so that people might actually want to get tested. Even promiscuity probably has little to do with birth control -it probably has everything to do with chastity just being difficult. 
Talk about sex is so taboo that most sex edu­cation is left to schools, as I have a feeling that most of our generation never got a real sex talk from our parents. Coupled with the fact that our faith exposure to sex when we are young is pri­marily through warnings against carnal tempta­tion, which suddenly changes as sex becomes holy when we are to be married, it seems as if we are trying to coax our minds to jump through schizophrenic hoops once we have a ring on our finger, or else abandon the cause of not saying more than we mean -the concept of chastity -long before. Which is really a shame, because the Church has some great theology about sex, under the title of "theology of the body," which unfortunately is still relatively obscure. And for all of the Church's 2,000 years of struggling with chastity directly, if given the chance, it may have insights which we find helpful. 
But please do not try and tell me that con­doms remove "permanence from marriage." I'm sure there are a number of octogenarians still going strong, who in their heyday used birth control, but who nonetheless are now celebrat­ing their 50th anniversaries. A piece of plastic does not kill the significance of sex or cause societal destruction. We do, if we allow it.

Condoms are not the cause 

Eleanore Strong recently argued in her Letter to the Editor ("Contraceptive society morally harmful") that contraceptives threaten humanity as condoms and other forms of sexual-pro­tection "erode respect for human life." But there is something else plaguing the world, and it too has no "respect for human life." It's called HIV and this pandemic has already claimed the lives of 25 million people. 
We, however, can fight this disease with that which Strong finds so morally repulsive -condoms. To end this great death requires more than idealistic policies of abstinence. These have been proven to be insufficient and leave future victims without the ability to make personal decisions and to protect themselves. As she continues in her misguided approach to solving the world's moral afllictions, Strong contends that con­traception robs the human race of a "stable, loving family" structure. 
Guess what? There are 40 million AIDS orphans in Sub­Saharan Africa and I don't think condoms have orphaned any­one yet. You may find it morally wrong to protect the gift oflife and the promise of a family through sexual-protection, but I think otherwise. The letter continues with her attack on such preventative-measures, claiming contraceptives "implicitly condone promiscuity.'' This broad assumption lacks any empir­ical evidence. Sexual protection allows for couples to physically express themselves without the fear of death, disease or an unwanted pregnancy. In no means do they cause individuals to have sex. They simply serve as protection, not as encourage­ment. 
And she doesn't stop there. Strong alleges that the preva­lence of contraceptives in our society has also caused a terrible sequence of events: they lead to more abortions and the spread of AIDS. These claims are devoid of truth, any support­ive evidence, and are the result of reckless, misguided assump­tions. Contraceptives prevent unwanted pregnancies that could easily result in more abortions and condoms prevent the trans­mission ofHIV/AIDS. Such preposterous attitudes toward sexu­al protection have already claimed the lives of millions in Africa, where rumors suggest having sex with a virgin to cure AIDS. To further such lies is surely more immoral than choos­ing to protect oneself. To dismiss contraceptives as immoral is to call wearing a seatbelt a sin. They provide a healthy choice for individuals wishing to express themselves with a partner and encourage physical and mental well being. It is a blessing that we now have an avenue to stop the spread of AIDS. It is time to utilize it and we have a moral obligation to do so.

AMERICAN IDOL FEATURE 

'American Idol' breeds talent, brings fame 
It's hard to avoid the "American Idol" phenomenon. Everyone knows who Simon Cowell is and can name at least one of the "Idol" winners or contestants. The show has produced a Grammy winner, a Golden Globe winner, a Country Music Award (CMA) female vocalist of the year and sev­eral platinum-selling recording artists. And it's only getting bigger and better. 
When the first season of "Idol" aired in 2002, it had nine million viewers. The premiere of the current sixth season enjoyed more than 57 million viewers. Its success single-handedly revived the talent show genre and gave rise to several suc­cessors, including "America's Got Talent," "Rock Star: INXS" and the latest, NBC's "Grease: You're the One That I Want." 
While "Idol" first began as a quest to find the best undiscovered young pop superstar, the show has since evolved and has lessened its age restrictions and opened itself to more genres, including rock and country. 
Even before the 24 finalists (12 males and 12 females) are named, the city open­call auditions are almost as popular to watch as the final contestants. As exciting as it is to see the young new talent, it is equally as fun to watch the delusional masses attempt to perform. 
The season three auditions introduced 
U.C. Berkeley student William Hung to the world, and he has since become a cult celebrity-even releasing his own album. Season five brought the Brittenum twins, Derrell and Terrell, and all of their accompanying drama. They both made it to Hollywood out of Chicago, and Derrell quit when he mistakenly heard that his brother had been cut. 
After he realized his error, he begged Cowell and the other judges to let him have his spot back. They agreed, but both twins were disqualified when they were recognized for being wanted for identity theft. Although the sixth season is only several weeks young, there have already been several (in)famous auditions, and several ambitious people have posted online guides to the MySpace profiles of some of the worst auditionees. 
The show has become so popular that appearing on "Ameriean Idol" is enough in itself to make the individuals almost instantly famous. They do not necessarily even have to win the contest to become a true American idol. 
As viewership has increased yearly, more and more of the finalists outside of first and second place have become exceptionally popular. Of the season live finalists, more than a third of them either already have a debut album on store shelves or are set to release one. Several more finalists, like Ace Young, have released singles online. 
Even beyond just selling albums, the "Idol" alums have met with success even outside the music arena. 
Most recently, season three contestant Jennifer Hudson won a Golden Globe and has been nominated for an Academy Award for her supporting role in "Dreamgirls." Season three winner Fantasia Barrino starred in a Lifetime movie based on her book, "Life Is Not a Fairy Tale." Season five contestant Kellie Pickler is getting her own sitcom, current­ly in production with FOX. 
Within the musical arena the original 

From his very first audition, Chris Daughtry made his presence felt during season five of "American Idol." While Bo Bice and Constantine Maroulis cracked open the door of the rock genre during season four, Daughtry blasted it open. His pulse-pounding performance of Fuel's hit "Hemorrhage" was praised by all three judges and was popular with the audience. 
His performance even impressed the members of Fuel, who asked him to be their lead singer after his departure from the show. His unforgettable renditions of Johnny Cash's "Walk the Line" and Bon Jovi's "Wanted Dead or Alive" cemented his fan base and earned him a spot among the "American Idol" greats. He finished the season as the fourth-place finalist. 
After the show ended, Daughtry declined the offer to join Fuel and instead chose to follow his own solo career. He formed his own band and recorded "Daughtry," a debut album that debuted at number two on the Billboard charts. His first single off of the album, "It's Not Over," is currently rated at 21 on the Billboard charts and is gaining in airtime popularity. The song, co­written by Daughtry and fellow "Idol" con­testant Ace Young, exemplifies his style of solidly blending together rock and pop qualities (much in the vein of artists such as Nickelback). 
Most of his album is a mesh of pop and rock, although individual songs vary on where they fall on th11 pop to rock scale. Songs like "Used To" and "Home" easily fall under the pop category, whereas "What I Want" and "Gone" are nothing but rock. ' 
Ilis version of rock, however, is much more blend1~d and stylized than some of his hard-rocking predecessors, and it is lairly easy to assume that Daughtry will find much more success in the pop circuits than in the rock. 
Although he tends to be grouped and compared to acts like Niekelbaek or Fuel, Daughtry still manages to impress upon his listeners his own unique sound -and it's obvious from the energy and enthusiasm of his album that he is doing what he loves to do. 
Daughtry's talent becomes apparent in the fact that there really isn't a bad track on the album. He wrot<~ or eo-wrote every song on the album with the exceptions of "Feels Like Tonight" and "What About Now," the latter written by Ben Moody 
Want," "Gone" 

from Evanescence. 
Daughtry's vocals are great on all of the songs, and he sounds even better than he did when he was on "Idol." The rest of the band is also excellent, with the guitarists specifically standing out. The song "What I Want" even features a special guest appearance by Guns 'N Roses guitar leg­end, Slash. 
The people behind "American Idol" never miss a beat, and this album is no exeeption. Every store carries the same "Daughtry" album except for one -Wai­Mart. Wal-Mart features a special "b_onus" Idol, Kelly Clarkson, garnered herself two Grammys and season four winner Carrie Underwood has twice won the CMA award for top female vocalist of the year, and has also been a Grammy nominee. 
With all of the success that "American Idol" and its contestants have enjoyed, it is a sure thing that it is not going away anytime soon and will continue to exist for the American public to enjoy ­William Hungs and all.

CD REVIEWS 
Personality helps Pickler after loss on show 
Jessica Simpson gained dubious fame for asking a now infamous question while pondering a can of Chicken of the Sea. "Is it chicken or tuna?" Following in Simpson's vein of dumb-blonde antics is Kellie Pickler, whose debut came in season five of "American Idol." 
Whether it was her confusing the meanings of "minx" and "mink" or her drawn-out Southern pronunciation of calamari, Pickler gained as much -if not more -attention for her naive per­sonality as for her musical abilities. 
She was so endearing and adorable, even when calling her fake eyelashes "tarantulas," that she warmed the hearts of all her viewers. Even the stone-cold Simon Cowell admitted that he was a Pickler fan. In the end though, her personality wasn't enough and she was eliminated from the competition in sixth place. 
Even after being bounced, the "Idol" producers recognized her lasting popu­larity and they filmed a recurring seg­ment called "Puck 'n Pickler," where chef Wolfgang Punk introduced Pickler to unusual food for comic relief on the show. She continued to be popular on the show, singing in the finale episode and doing several promotional spots for later shows. 
Although she finished in sixth place, Pickler has returned to the public eye with the release of her debut album, "Small Town Girl," which debuted at 

KELLIE PICKLER

Recommended Tracks: "Red High Heels," '1 W>nder" "'ne of the Guysn 
number one on the Billboard country chart. The album is standard fare as far as country music goes, and her catchy lyrics and upbeat voice will make the release instantly popular with country fans. 
Her first single off of the album, "Red High Heels," has consistently been in the top-20 of the country charts since its debut. A catchy and sassy song that talks about her love for collecting shoes, it is the perfect introduction for Pickler to the world outside of "Idol." 
In a break from tradition and a show of support for Pickler, the production company for the "Idol" contestants released her album two months before "Idol" winner Taylor Hicks was set to release his. In previous years, all of the contestants were under contract not to release their albums until after the first and second-place winners released theirs. 
"Small Town Girl" is full of energy, and Pickler celebrates everything that makes up her vivacious country personality. Although much of the album is upbeat and energetic, it also balances out these moments with more emotional, senti­mental songs. 
The tearjerker track "I Wonder," which is scheduled to be her second sin­gle release, is an ode to her mother, who left her when she was a young child. It's obvious that Pickler put her heart and soul into the song, and it is sure to be a successful country ballad in the future. 
Throughout the album Pickler ranges from sounding almost cynical on "Things That Never Cross a Man's Mind" to showing some heartbreak on "Didn't You Know." The song "One of the Guys" shows that she knows how to have fun, and then she goes back to being senti­mental on "My Angel," a tribute to her grandmother. 
Although Pickler puts together a great album and her performances are defi­nitely better than the ones she gave while on "Idol," she still doesn't have the wide musical appeal in the mainstream community necessary to become a big star. 
Pickler will find easy and rapid suc­cess in the country music circuits, but unlike her country-"Idol" predecessor, Carrie Underwood, she doesn't quite have the vocals to make an impact out­side of the somewhat self-contained country circle. 
Overall, "Small Town Girl" is a great country album, with both upbeat songs and ballads that hit all of the right notes. For fans of that genre, Kellie Pickler's album is a fantastic addition to any collection.

Pop singer, basketball star has promising debut 
All it takes now is simply an appear­ance on "American Idol" to become a recording pop artist. Ayla Brown, who released her debut album "Forward" last year, is proof of that. Akhough she made the top-24 field of finalists, she was eliminated in week three of the finals. Even though she lasted a relative­ly short time on the hit television show, her brief stint sufficed to gain enough of a fan base to warrant recording an album. 
Typically albums can take a long time to record, but Brown and her team at Double Deal Records managed to record, mix and produce her debut CD all in less than two weeks. She only had a limited time to record her album because she is also a freshman at Boston College, which she attends on a full basketball scholarship. She only had a small window of opportunity between the end of her "Idol" contract and her official enrollment at BC, where she is obligated to follow NCAA regulations concerning the recording and promotion of music. 
"Forward" has a very contemporary pop feel to it. From the upbeat first sin­gle "Know You Better" to the inspira­tional ballad "Ten Cent Wings," Brown displays a decent vocal talent which is as good as most recording pop artists today -where it doesn't take the most amazing voice in the world to make a hit song. 
Much like "Know You Better," which is gaining in radio play, her covers of "I Quit" and "Sugah" are driven by up beats and catchy lyrics. Her version of "Sugah" is much more developed than the one recorded by fellow "Idol" alums Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson for their cinematic travesty, "From Justin to Kelly" (2002). Likewise, Brown's arrangement for "I Quit" is much more upbeat and faster than Hepburn's origi­nal release. 
Most of Brown's album is written by such well-known songwriters as Diane Warren ("' Don't Wanna Miss A Thing") and Tommy Sims ("Change the World"), but she did manage to co-write two of her songs-the love ballad "Falling Into You," as well as one dedicated to her family and friends entitled "Thanks To You." Both songs, while not terribly deep, are heartfelt and catchy. 
Two of the better songs on the album have a more theatrical feel to them: "Miles Aw"ay (Too Fast For You)" and "Ten Cent Wings." Both demonstrate a great deal of vocal maturity from an artist who has really had limited expo-

sure to singing. While they aren't quite radio-friendly -and are unlikely to ever be released as singles -they are easily the most thought-evoking and enjoyable songs out of the collection. 
The most unique track on "Forward" is the "Jock Jams"-esque "Breaking Away." The up-tempo, easy-to-workout­to song features the sound of a dribbling basketball as part of the beat and is well-suited as a tune coming from a bas­ketball player. 
The biggest downside to the album ­and for Brown in general -is that there isn't enough to make her stand out from the rest of the pop world. While it's a great pop album, it doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from the rest of the homogenous pop albums. Likewise, Brown isn't quite unique enough to stand out on her own, and she didn't make it far enough on "Idol" to have that built-in level of success. 
While Kelly Clarkson's first album wasn't terrific, she had the support of her "Idol" win to continuously put her name in the public eye until she truly was good enough to stand on her own. Brown's next release will surely be bet­ter, but the question remains as to whether this album will garner enough success to warrant another.

'lABYRINTH' WEAVES COMPLEX TALE OF FANTASY, REALITY 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assisranr Scene Ediror 
Few films are able to meld the every­day world with a fantastical, mythical dream world better than "Pan's Labyrinth." This film tells its story through the eyes of a little girl who finds herself undergoing Herculean tasks at the bidding of a seven-foot faun while dealing with the after effects of the Spanish Civil War. 
The grittiness of the war is clear in the violence, the fantasy of her hidden king­dom is clear in her awe and the way these two worlds mirror each other is 
Pan's Labyrinth 


Director: Guillermo del Toro Writer: Guillermo del Toro Starring: Ariadna Gil, Ivana Baquero, Doug Jones and Sergi Lopez undeniably clear in the brilliant parallels director and screenwriter Guillermo del Toro weaves into this film. 
Few films this year will be as lush and beautiful as "Pan's Labyrinth." This, in relation to the story it tells, is the strongest aspect of the film. The lighting is beautifully done, especially during scenes shot at night. The proper amount of eeriness and fantasy is inserted into the film, which brings the war-torn real world together with the fantastic under­ground kingdom, a place described in the prologue as a world without pain or sadness. 
The. central driving force of the narra­tive revolves around a young girl named Ofelia who travels with her mother to live with her mother's new husband, Captain Vidal. Vidal is a captain in the Nationalist army that has just overtaken control of Spain. He's been assigned to a rural outpost to quell any opposition posed by Republican forces hiding in the forests. 
The actor behind the vicious and ruth­less Captain Vidal is Sergi Lopez, who puts in the best performance of the film. 
He is exacting and unbending in his quest to destroy the small Republican force and raise his son under his mili­taristic guidance. 
Vidal's bloodthirstiness is matched by one other character in the film -the Pale Man, a fearsome antagonist young Ofelia faces in the second task she is given at the labyrinth near her house. Only the imagination of a first-rate film­maker could have thought up the night­mare that is the Pale Man, whose eye­balls are embedded in his hands. The only way to truly experience the charac­ter is to see his inspired design on the big screen. 
The makeup in "Pan's Labyrinth" ­which was recently nominated for an Academy Award -is incredible. The fantasy elements are impeccable because they are not life-like. This may seem an odd assessment, but the make­up helps sell these creatures in exactly the way a young child might imagine them. The fantastic characters here do not attempt to be real in the way those in Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" do. 
The faun and the denizens of Ofelia's fantasy world exist in her world, not in ours. This makeup also extends to some of the most gruesome bloodshed in a film to date. There is not much blood, but the mutilation some characters endure can be unnerving even for the strong of mind and stomach. 
However, this mutilation has a pur­pose, unlike that found in the rash of torture/horror films that have been released recently. The real world is full of tenderness but also war, bloodshed and pain and the fantasy world of "Pan's Labyrinth" reflects this. The two worlds are separate yet identical. 
"Pan's Labyrinth" can best be charac­terized as very sad and heart-rending, yet life-affirming and hopeful. It is not only a beautiful film to look at but also a beautiful story that transcends language. Uel Torn's vision shows how those who are young at heart can dream to rise above the mundane and cruel aspects of an everyday world.

IMAGINATIVE FILM lACKS DEPTH AND MEANING 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Ediror 
"Pan's Labyrinth" wants badly to be a great movie, but its reach exceeds its grasp. It is a creative and unique film, and its originality is admirable, but it never pulls together as a singular work, and that lack of cohesiveness ultimately prevents it.from being as good a picture as it could be. 
Set against the turmoil of 1944 Spain, when the Spanish Civil War was coming to a close, "Pan's Labyrinth" follows Ofelia (Ivana Baquero). a girl who accompanies her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to a military camp. Carmen has married the brutal Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), who is attempting to weed out a group of rebels who have taken to the mountains. Carmen and Ofelia are looked after by Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), one of Vidal's servants. Mercedes' brother, however, is one of the leaders of the rebels, and Mercedes is secretly aiding them. During all of this, Ofelia is drawn to a nearby labyrinth and confronted by a mysteri­ous faun named Pan (Doug Jones, who also plays the eerie Pale Man). who informs her that she has the soul of a lost princess and must pass three tests to prove herself and take her rightful place in her true father's kingdom. 
The biggest problem with "Pan's Labyrinth" is that, despite its multifac­eted complexity, it's not nearly as immersive as it should be. The continual narrative shifts between the "real world" and the "fantasy world" are jolt­ing and the film's narrative footing is too dependent on Mercedes and the rebellion when it should concentrate on Ofelia. The three tests that Ofelia is given are simplistic in nature, and occa­sionally complicate (rather than clarify) her character. 
The film's lack of cohesiveness detracts from the movie as a whole, though there is much to admire, partic­ularly in its craftsmanship. The film is undeniably beautiful, especially in its art direction and sense of form. The script, penned by Del Toro, is humorless but complicated, brimming with ideas and creativity. Unfortunately, it too often lacks thematic unity, spiraling in several different directions without fully explor­ing most of them. 
"Pan's Labyrinth" is also quite dark and violent, with many disturbing scenes that are difficult and off-putting. For a film touted as an escapist fantasy, there's simply too much reality. The harshness and brutality of the "real world" threaten to overshadow what is ostensibly the narrative crux of the pic­ture, which dilutes much of the film's impact. 
Ivana Baquero, all of 12 years old, is superb as Ofelia. In many ways, the film rests on her shoulders, and her con­trolled, measured performance mixes innocence and wisdom perfectly. Sergi Lopez offers the other standout per­formance as the monstrous Captain Vidal, evoking shades of Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goeth from "Schindler's List." 
It's not hard to see why critics are rav­ing about "Pan's Labyrinth," since it 
Pan's Labyrinth 


feels like a picture specifically designed to make an artistic statement. Unfortunately, it never quite coalesces as a complete work, but it does hint at future greatness from a filmmaker starting to hit his stride. 
Del Toro has proven himself a director capable of great visual beauty, but he has yet to make a movie that fulfills his enormous potential. He is far more tal­ented than previous works like "Mimic," "Blade II" and "Hellboy" might have indicated, and "Pan's Labyrinth" is a great leap forward for him as an artisti­cally-minded filmmaker. The picture itself, however, is never as immersive or emotionally effective as it should be.

Associated Press 

ALAMEDA, Calif. ­After four miserable sea­sons, AI Davis knew the Oakland Raiders needed a fresh start. He couldn't have found a new coach much more fresh than Lane Kiffin. 
The Raiders officially hired the 31-year-old Kiffin on Tuesday, putting the former Southern California offensive coor­dinator in charge of restoring glory to a three­time Super Bowl champi­on that fell to the NFL's worst record last year. 
Kiffin, who took the job 
Monday, became the 
youngest head coach in 
club history and the NFL's youngest in several decades. If the job of rebuilding a 2-14 club intimidates him, Kiffin didn't show it while sit­ting next to Davis in a sharp black suit. 
''I'm extremely excited about this opportunity and where I see this place going," Kiffin said at the Raiders' training com­plex. "It's a historic fran­chise that has had great­ness and has fallen on tough times, but we will bring it back to where it was before. We will do that through hard work. I'm prepared to roll up my sleeves and go to work." 
Kiffin, the son of Tampa Bay defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, has just one season of NFL experience as Jacksonville's defen­sive quality control coach in 2000. But the 78-year­old Davis wasn't afraid to hire a coach young enough to be his grand­son. 
In fact, Davis wanted another talented young offensive mind to lead the franchise where John Madden, Mike Shanahan and Jon Gruden excelled in their 30s. Shanahan and Gruden won Super Bowls with other teams after leaving the Raiders rancorously when their ideas clashed with Davis' vision for the franchise. 
"I think, '31 years old, wow, that's young,"' Davis said. "But you don't have to be old to be great. You have to be good. You have to want it. You have to have a desire, a passion for football." 
The Raiders also will retain defensive coordina­tor Rob Ryan, who built an above-average defense last season despite the offense's woes. Kiffin, who left for the Senior Bowl after Tuesday's news conference, plans to hire an offensive coordi­nator soon. 
And he has plenty of additional work ahead with the Raiders. 
IN BRIEF 

Mipnesot~ fires Casey due to IDCOnSIStency 
MINNEAPOLIS -The Timberwolves fired coach Dwane Casey on Tuesday, one day after Minnesota lost its fourth consecutive game and only 1 1/2 sea­sons since he took over. 
Casey, in his first head coaching job, was unable to solve the Timberwolves' inconsistencies and push them back into the thick of the competitive Western Conference, prompting vice president of basketball operations Kevin McHale to make the move. 
"We were at a point as a team where we were just treading water," McHale said. "The ups and downs, we just couldn't fmd any consistency." 
The Timberwolves looked to be turn­ing the comer at the start of the new year, when they opened 2007 with seven wins in their first eight games. 
But they lost their next four games, including one to Phoenix without lead­ing scorers Kevin Garnett and Ricky Davis. 
Bears' Johnson cleared to 
play in Super Bowl 
SKOKIE, Ill. -Chicago Bears defensive tackle Tank Johnson will play in the Super Bowl with court approval. 
Cook County Judge John Moran granted a defense request Tuesday to allow Johnson to leave the state as he awaits trial on gun possession charges. The Bears will play the Indianapolis Colts in the Super Bowl in Miami on Feb.4. 
Johnson's attorney, Lorna Propes, said Johnson will have no special restrictions placed on him while in Miami. 
"Terry Johnson is going to Miami to play football and represent the Bears," she said. 
Johnson was arrested Dec. 14 after police raided his home in Gurnee, about 40 miles northwest of Chicago. Prosecutors say officers found six weapons and ammunition in Johnson's home. He faces 10 counts of possession of firearms without a state gun-owner identification card. 
Roddick cruises to semifinal 
showdown with Federer 
MELBOURNE, Australia -Andy Roddick was ruthless, treating his close friend like little more than warmup fodder for his semifinal showdown with Roger Federer. 
The 2003 U.S. Open champion flat­tened Mardy Fish without blinking Tuesday, making only four unforced errors in a 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 quarterfinal win at the Australian Open. 
"I played pretty flawless, thought," Roddick said. "I feel good going into the semis." 
Roddick said he could remember making more errors in one game than he had in the entire match against Fish, who lived with him in Boca Raton, Fla., for a while and went to his high school. 
"I tried my best to kind of put our friendship to the back of my head," Roddick said. "You know, it's always difficult. It's a weird, weird situa­tion."

The last time these two teams met, Alma forward Ashley Matuzak paced her. team with 27 points and a contest-high 12 rebounds. Saint Mary's won that game at home by a score of 72-60. 
"Ashley Matuzak is a very good player. She creates prob­lems for us defensively," Saint Mary's head coach Jennifer Henley said. 
In order to neutralize Matuzak, Belles freshman cen­ter Anna Kammrath and sopho­more forward Erin Newsom will need to play well. . 
Newsom has been steadily improving throughout the sea­son and is averaging eight rebounds a game. Kammrath has become a dominant pres­ence in the paint and is also pulling down an average of eight rebounds per contest. 
"We are going to have to give more help on [Matuzak] when she attacks the basket and find her earlier in transition defense," Henley said. 
Kammrath and Newsom have been keys to Saint Mary's recent success. After a rocky start the Belles have turned their season around. 
"I think our early struggles were due to three factors: adjusting to a new coach, play­ing an incredibly tough non­conference schedule and our overall youth," Henley said. 
The Belles roster of 15 play­ers includes only three upper­classman. These elders -most notably junior guard Alison Kessler -have been key con­tributors ·throughout the sea­son. But the Belles have found success when their younger

Despite their accomplish­ments in the pool, Carroll, who won three events at the Michigan Invitational, said their biggest impact has come out of the water. 
"They are a light-hearted and funny group," she said. "They don't take it too seri­ously, and they help lighten the mood." 
Carroll said the freshman group's hunger and work ethic has also encouraged the rest of the team to maximize its potential. 
"I train with Ashlee Edgell and Megan Farrell. They push me everyday. Their times are really good and are only going to get better." Carroll said. "It's so hard to single them out individually because all of them con­tribute in their own ways to the team." ·

Having other contributors has allowed the Belles to spread the ball around and alleviate the pressure that opposing defenses devoted to stopping Kessler and senior guard Bridget Lipke.

has a lot of depth," Carroll said. "The points they are able to get definitely help us and they're only getting bet­ter." 
While the freshmen may not always win their events, their ability to finish strongly and score third, fourth or fifth-place points are essen­tial to Notre Dame's hope of capturing a Big East title next month. 
"There are quite a few of them going to the Big East meet," Carroll said. "It's good for them to get their feet wet and get experience." 
At the prestigious U.S. Open meet -an event that fea­tured Olympic quality compe­tition -freshman Natalie Stitt finished 11th in the one­meter dive, while Tiffany Robak placed 16th. Megan Farrell and Ashlee Edgell placed 48th and 58th in the 200-meter individual medley. Numerous freshmen also hold top team times in their respective events, including Lexie Shue (500-meter

view. "It slowed them down and changed their rhythm." 
So when Red Storm forward Anthony Mason Jr. dumped the ball inside to Hamilton with less than 20 seconds remain­ing and the score tied at 68, Irish forward Russell Carter cheated from his position out­side of the paint to prevent Hamilton from getting an easy bucket. 
Once Carter took a step inside, Hamilton spotted St. John's guard Larry Wright open beyond the three­

struggled from the free-throw line, shooting only 15-for-25 (60 percent). 
Defensively, the Irish kept themselves in the game, limit­ing St. John's to just 30 per­cent shooting in the second half. Their inability to put the ball in the basket late, howev­er, prevented them from taking a significant lead. 
Falls finished with 16 points on 5-of-13 shooting, but con­verted only one of his six sec­ond half 3-point attempts.

Wright's clutch shot gave the Red Storm a 71-68 lead with 9.9 seconds left. 
"We gave ourselves a lot of chances to win the game," Brey said. "Wright made a big shot right there. We had our opportunities. We certainly had our opportunities." 
Notre Dame guard Colin Falls had tied the game at 68 by hitting one of two free throws with 40. 3 seconds left. The Irish (16-4, 4-3 Big East) had a chance to tie the game again after Wright's shot, but Carter's shot from well beyond the NBA three-point line missed, giving St. John's (12-8, 3-4) the win. 
"I don't want us hanging our head too much here," Brey said. "You just don't have time for that in league play." 
Despite missing the final shot, Carter led Notre Dame with a career-high 32 points and five rebounds, including an 11-0 personal run to begin the second half -in a game Brey wasn't even sure he'd play in. 
Carter hit the floor hard twice going after rebounds in Notre Dame's win over South Florida Sunday. 
"lie was kind of questionable for this game. He didn't prac­tice yesterday and was very sore this afternoon," Brey said. "I said tell me after warm-ups how you feel." 
Carter was "great," Brey said. "He gave us a great start ... I thought he was fabulous." 
Carter's early second-half spurt erased the Red Storm's 49-41 halftime lead, When Carter cooled off, however, the rest of the Irish could not pick up the slack. Notre Dame scored one bench point the entire game and, besides Carter's 10-for-20 perform­ance, shot just 27 percent from the field. The Irish also

"[Villanova's] very good and very hot right now," Brey said. "But they bumped us so I hope our guys remember that."

Notre Dame was unable to knock down shots when it needed to most, especially in the paint. As a team, the Irish shot only 35.5 percent from the floor, including 4-for-13 from beyond the arc. In the post, the Golden Eagles were able to outscore the Irish 36­26 as well as outrebound them 37-31.

Despite the outcome, the Irish were able to keep the game close with Marquette throughout the first half, even taking a 13-12 lead at 13:44. The Golden Eagles would soon recapture that lead, however, and would hold on to it the remainder of the match.

three-pointer and -even though forward Ashley Barlow grabbed the rebound -missed the go-ahead layup. After that, Marquette contin­ued to pull farther away from the Irish, eventually wearing out an 11-point lead with 3:42 to play that would be good enough to ride to victory. 
Another disappointment was the play of guard Charel Allen, who put up 17 points and eight. rebounds in the loss. Although this would be a good line on most nights, Allen scored 56 points in two games last week, a feat that earned her Big East player of the 

Allen did not give up hope late in the game. 
She continued to try and find her shot, and was inte­gral in keeping the score rea­sonable by making crucial baskets in the second half. 
"I was happy that [Charel] continued to shoot even though she was having an off night," McGraw said. "I was a little disappointed that nobody else could pick up the slack." 
Defensively, the Irish were only able to contain Marquette's potent offense, not effectively shut it down. Golden Eagle guard Krystal Ellis-the team's leading scorer -scored below her season average of 19.3 with only 12 points on 4-of-12 shooting. 
"I thought as a whole the whole team did a good job in guarding [Ellis]." McGraw said. "I think that was one of the things we did pretty well. We did a pretty good job on her." 
But forwards Christina Quaye and Efueko Osagie­Landry added 12 and 15 points, respectively, to help bolster the Golden. Eagle offense. 
Notre Dame's bench was also not the strong presence it has been in recent games. Against Marquette, the fresh­man trio of center Erica Williamson and guards Barlow and Lechlitner were effectively shut down, provid­ing the Irish offense only 17 points off the bench. 
"Our bench has been excel­lent this year and tonight they weren't," McGraw said. "Ashley Barlow gave us a lift early, but nobody really played well. We just didn't do anything well." 
After the loss, McGraw said that there was not one single thing the Ir-ish could do to improve after their perform­anc~ against Marquette before a matchup with No. 5 Connecticut. 
"You look at a game like that where you didn't do any­thing right, so you feel like you're stuck back at ground zero,'' she said. "But I just think everybody's got to come ready to play."

FOOTBALL RECRUITING 
Chicago running back Hughes co111111its to Weis, Irish 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 
Chicago running back Robert Hughes, a highly regarded 5­foot-11, 228-pound bruiser from Hubbard High School, announced in a press confer­ence Tuesday he will attend Notre Dame. 
"I think he beings a very phys­ical style of play to Notre Dame," said Mike Frank, who covers recruiting for Irisheyes.com, a member of the Scout.com re<;ruiting network. 
"The one thing you know you're going to get from Robert is you're going to get 100 percent of his effort." 
Hughes chose Notre Dame over Illinois after an intense recruiting battle. 
With the pickup, the Irish now have 19 recruits in this year's incoming class, including two running backs. Miami-area prospect Armando Allen verbal­ly committed to Irish coach Charlie Weis at the beginning of December, and the addition of Hughes gives Notre Dame its second-straight recruiting class with two premier tailbacks. In 2006, the Irish signed current freshmen James Aldridge and Munir Prince. Aldridge ran 37 times in seven games for a 3.8 yards-per-carry average. Prince saw action in 10 games but had only 15 attempts for 21 yards. 
Allen is considered to be one of the fastest backs in this recruiting class. But in Hughes, Frank said, the Irish land a physical specimen with impres­sive size. 
"It's all solid muscle," Frank said of Hughes' large frame. "He's a very cut, very strong

ND falls to St. John's on three­pointer with 9.9 seconds left 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 
After St. John's forward Lamont Hamilton scored 23 points in the first half, Notre Dame shut him down in the second by making a key defensive adjustment. 
The adjustment, however, contained an Achilles heel that ultimately cost the Irish in their 71-68 defeat to the Red Storm Tuesday at Madison Square Garden in New York City. 
Notre Dame switched from man-to-man defense to zone midway through the first half in an attempt to stop Hamilton from scoring by keeping more defenders near the basket. 
"The zone gave us a chance," Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said in a post-game inter-

Talented freshmen give squad depth, hu111or 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 
No. 19 Notre Dame entered the final event of last week's Michigan Invitational -the 400-yard freestyle relay ­with a slim 7 .5-point lead over No. 10 Michigan for sec­ond place. Things looked up for the Wolverines when one of their teams touched the wall first and grabbed 40 points. 
A few seconds later, howev­er, the Irish broke any hopes 
the Wolverines had of catch­ing up. Four Irish relay teams managed to outscore the rest of Michigan's squad and preserve Notre Dame's finish over a higher-ranked opponent. 
And while the Irish upper­classmen were important to the upset, senior captain Katie Carroll said the keys to the event were the six Notre Dame freshmen who con­tributed to the scoring.

kid. I just think he's going to bring a reitl toughness to Notre Dame." 
Hughes eclipsed 1,000 yards in his first three seasons at Hubbard, and his best perform­ances came in his third season, in which he rushed for more than 1,900 yards. 
"He brings a bigger back with some power, but he's also shifty," Frank said. "He's got the ability to cut right and left, which is not something all the bigger backs have." 
Full stats from Hughes' senior season were unavailable. 
Hughes, who is listed as run­ning the 40-yard dash in 4.6 seconds, played in the Chicago Public League, the high school conference of new Irish defen­sive coordinator Corwin Brown. Brown was an all-state player at Julian High School in Chicago and was scheduled to meet with Hughes Monday, Frank said. 
"Having Corwin Brown in Chicago is going to be a big thing," Frank said for long-term Irish recruiting in the area. "He's a guy who has a lot of

Belles head to Alma for MIAA tilt
