Students Approve Rossie Bill For Hall Self Government 
BY TOM FIGEL 

The General Assembly of Students, lleld Wednes­day and Thursday of this week in the Stepen Center spent most of its time on two motions: a statement of student rights proposed by Richard Rossie ancl a demand for parietal hours. 
A crowd of more than 2000 dwindled to little more. than 800 during Wednesday night's General Assembly, as it became clear that Student Body Presidential can­didate Richard Rossie's strong motion on student rights would pass. Rossie's motion, the third taken up by the Assem­bly, hinged on its rationale, "if students must obey 
the rules~ they should make them," exactly contrary t0 a second motion by Tom Scherer. Scherer's bill claimed that "the ultimate responsibility for. .. this university lies in the Administration and Board of Trustees."

200 Protest Dow Interviews Under Dome 

BY DENNIS GALLAGHER 
More than two hundred persons, rough­ly two-thirds Notre Dame studentd, gath­ered at the Administration Building Wed­nesday afternoon to protest the recruit­ment interviews being held by the Dow Chemical Company. Dow, the chief sup­plier of the napalm that the United States government uses in Vietnam, seemed to most of the demonstrators a symbol of what they considered the immorality of 
America's conduct in Vietnam. 
The protest is a landmark in Notre 
Dame student activism, in that it marks 
the first time a "radical" demonstration 
has been permitted within the walls of a 
University building. No disciplinary action 
has thus far been taken against any of the 
participants and apparently none is con­
templated. 
The gathering of students on the 
second floor of the Administration Build­
ing, where the Dow interviews were sche­
duled to be held, began about twelve-
thirty. Rumors spread through the small 
crowd that the demonstration had been 
forbidden by everyone from "Father 
Hesburgh on down." By 12:45 PM, about 
seventy demonstrators had collected di­
rectly beneath the Golden Dome. 
At this point, Rev. James Riehle, De~:>.n 
of Students, addressed the group. He as­sured them that the University would al­low their protest, but not, however, inside the Administration Building, which he termed alternately "a place of business" and "private property" where the students had no legal right. 
The students were considering Father Riehle's ultimatum to move outside, when suddenly a great number of demonstra­tors who li.ad massed outside came into the building. This not only trebled their number but gave them a certain respecta­bility with the arrival of several prominent faculty members, notably Rev. David Burrell of the Philosophy department and Peter Michelson of the English depart­ment. 
Hurried negotiations ensued between Father Riehle and Brian McTigue, the un­official quasi-leader of the student seg­ment of the demonstration. McTigue a­greed to keep aisles open to allow free movement among the second floor offices and also to keep the demonstrators quiet. 
The aisles were in fact kept open but the requisite silence was not so easily, or willingly, maintained. Ken Lux, an in­structor at the Indiana University exten­sion in South Bend, made several im­promptu speeches. "How do you silence burning people?" he said. "I'm not for peace, I'm for justice. Peace is the estab­lishment's word for order. I don't want to leave Dow in peace." 
Lux's views were tolerated but not shared by most of the demonstrators. "If we're going to have a demonstration for peace," said Forrest Hainline, "Let's make it a peaceful demonstration." Tom McKenna, the Student Body Vice-Presi­dent, added, "If you want people to be responsible, then you're going to have to show some yourself." 
The demonstration attracted curious onlookers throughout its two hour dura­tion. The ladies in the University Founda­tion office got little work done as they spent the afternoon clustered around their office door shaking their heads and cluck­ing unsympathetically about the younger 


generation. One woman pointedly ex­
pressed her view of the protesters' per­
sonal hygiene by coming forward with a 
can of air freshener and spraying it in 
their direction. 
As for the Dow interviewer, he was seen or heard by no one. At least one of the scheduled interviews was cancelled by the University. One prospective inter­viewee expressed his general indifference to the whole thing: "I have my point of view and they have theirs." 
With the preliminary victories over, the early afternoon was passed in a round of protest songs, reading from an anti-war publication entitled Viet Report and in scriptural readings by a number of those who opposed the war basically on Chris­tian moral grounds. 
Just before three o'clock, the protes­tors arose and marched casually to the Library Auditorium, singing "Alice's Res­taurant" and "We Shall Overcome" as they went. A series of short speeches was begun by Peter Michelson of the English 
STAFF PHOTOS BY PETE McGRAnt department who noted that Dow was not responsible for the war, not even really playing a major part in it, but was never­theless a symbol of the immorality and ir­responsibility of our position. "Dow has a greater responsibility to the suffering of the world than simply to profit from it," Michelson said. 
. Father David Burrell followed, saying, "One doesn't have to be certain that the war is wrong in order to raise questions a­bout it. There must be a Joyal opposi­tion." 
Howard Dooley, a graduate in History, concluded the afternoon with a call for practical political action. "I object to the 
war because it is stupid. The war is a mis­take. Whether we stay, stop the war to­morrow or ten years from now, there will still be a coalition government. 1t is tune for the peace movement to act politically to hold demonstrations that will appeal 
to outsiders as well as confirm the faith of the true believers."

Fed. Grants 
Rep. John Brademas (D., Ind.) has a·nnounced that the Univer­sity of Notre Dame has received a renewal of a $150,000 federal grant for a graduate program in world history designed for experienced secondary school teachers. Twenty teachers will receive M.A. degrees in the pro­gram which involves intern tea­ching in South Bend, Elkhart and Niles schools.

need in regards to social and re­ligious activities. However, to hold a dance in a chapel the Hall Government would have to go through the committee.

We Want It Now 
"If students should obey the rules, they 
should make them." 
Now that's not a very outrageous re­quest, but for some reason it has been a request that has not been uttered enough 
in the last 125 years at Notre Dame. Not only has it not been said frequently, but when it has been said, it has been whis­
pered. 
Wednesday, however, 700 students forcefully called for their freedom as they endorsed Rossie's motion for self-govern­ment. Heart fully, the freshman class, which was perhaps the most active in the proceedings, seemed to favor the bill, if only by a slight majority. 
So if the administration is unwilling to listen to Wednesday's cry for freedom, we are sure that there are some students here who are willing to keep shouting for the next three years. 
Student self-government, however, should not be the burden of one class or one student government officer. It should happen through a massive student move­ment to convince the University that we want student self-government. And that we want it now. 
It would be completely futile to let 
this motion of Rossie's die on the desk of University President Theodore Hesh­burgh. Delay would mean a new start, new obstacles and new failure. 
Things must be done today to make up for our lackadaisical attitude of yester­day. We now have the mandate, let us make our stand. And if student self­government is not granted here, let us 
cancel the elections and cancel Mardi Gras, and cancel the Mock Republican Conven­tion, and cancel Student Government and cancel classes, if that's necessary to show that we are sick of being treated like fools. 
Successful But.  
 

Wednesday's demonstration against Dow Chemical Co., if it didn't bring the  war in Vietnam to a screeching halt, had important consequences for the campus itself. 
For the first time students' actively called the Administration's bluff and sat­in, against Administration demands, at the Administration Building. According to Brian McTigue, one of the demonstra­tions organizers, Rev. James Riehle, C.S.C., Dean of Students, had refused permission Wednesday morning for the demonstra­tion to take place in the building itself. In addition, he warned that non-students in­volved would be arrested for trespassing. 
But there was nothing Fr. Riehle could or did do. The demonstration proceeded at least as quietly as the Up With People concert held on the same spot within the Administration Building and non-students were proudly singled out as "members of the Notre Dame family." Three of the five students scheduled for interviews 
showed up and were not hindered from seeing Dow's representatives, since the demonstrators had decided, wisely, not to prevent Dow from holding its interviews but simply to express student adversion to Dow's involvement in the Vietnam war. 
Unfortunately, a demonstration which 
had so much effect on campus saved little 
force for the world outside. It took only 
a few flashbulbs to discredit their sincere 
and correct opinion, since the average 
voter is not only saturated with demon­strations but deaf to the arguments of those who expFess by their dress little hope for change. Door-to-door salesmen don't grow rich wearing swastikas in Jewish neighborhoods. Unimportant ex­ternals should not be allowed to cover the outrage against this war. 
The day of the anti-war demonstration is over. Those likely to listen have heard it all, and those who oppose the war (and this involves working toward its end) should find another means. Nomination of a peace candidate at the Mock Po­litical Convention can be one such avenue, one that the demonstrators should exam­ine. 



Dennis Gallagher 
Simplistic Respectability 
... 

One thing that Father Hesburgh's recent missive to the Student 
Body proved is that "great students of the Russian language, his­
tory and culture" ought to confine themselves to writing about 
Russia. In case you've been avoiding your mailbox, FatherHesburgh 
has submitted another short term paper to the student body, the 
work of none other than George F. Kennan, noted diplomat and 
unofficial Patriot of the Year. 
Apart from certain feelings of discontent aroused by Father 
Hesburgh using University funds (if I'm wrong, I'll hear about it, 
you can be sure) to distribute what can only be termed a sort of 
propalganda, we should at least read the article with an open mind. 
After all, Mr. Kennan is a ranking intellectual by anybody's stan~ 
dards. So he should have something to say, shouldn't he? 
Well, it happens that Mr. Kennan's paper is a condemnation of tbe New Left, "rebels without a program." I don't think it's en­tirely false to suppose that there are good grounds for criticizing both ti1e militant activists and the flower children. Unfortunately, Mr. Kennan's conceptions of both groups seem to derive largely from Time magazine, whose simplifications run somewhat towards the nature of lies. 
You know you're in trouble from the first few paragraphs, a bit of old Southern idealization from the pen of Woodrow Wilson about the shady retreats of academe. In his stronger moments, Wilson was capable of better than viewing "calm Science seated there, re­cluse, ascetic, like a nun." But Kennan, who for no apparent reason considers this minor public address a bit of Divine revelation, accuses today's radicals of "flagrant repudiation of the Wilsonian ideal." 
Mr. Kennan goes on to a somewhat hysterical condemnation, full of galloping impersonalization about "eyes glazed with anger and passion, too often dimmed as well by artificial abuse of the psychic structure that lies behind them." Kennan's opinions are sim­ply intellectualizations of an all too popular stereotype. At no time does he notice the individualization in "them," apart from the ru­
dimentary division into leaping screamers and hippies. 
His big objection is that "they" are not, as he is, eminently ra­tional and civilized. It might be noted that Mr. Kennan's career is a prominent example of a man failing due to an excess of civility. His excellent official memorandums from Moscow were filed and for­gotten. The "containment policy" which he divised as a strategy of realpolitik has been misinterpreted and distorted into our present moralistic adventuring. 
Not that he doesn't say some valuable things. The New Left, he says, should not be righteous and pompously self-assured. And of course, some of them are just that and shouldn't be. The problem is that his truths are truisms, banal and repetitive -Kennan notes that hippies are bad people because they withdraw from th; real world 
and pursue illusory truths in drugs 'and occult religions. Apart from the fact that the whole country couldn't provide enough people who ansWer purely and simply to Kennan's description to fill the Library Auditorium, did we really need to be told by America's leading Russia expert what we've already heard from Kerry Drake and Mary Worth? 
Mr. Kennan will stand out in history as perhaps the finest prac­tical political theorist of our time. But his absurdly legalistic mind and simple lack of knowledge hamper him here to the point that his little article might well have remained in that mountain of ma­terial. With all good wishes, Mr. Kennan should leave simple-minded social philosophy to Norman Vincent Peale.

Mad, Mad 
It has become something of a status symbol. You know, big time journalist who sways the mood of the masses. They have all read their McLuhan and are now ready to dissect then reflect on their stu­dent society. Two schools o·f thought have produced the budding journalistic genius. One is the malcontent. He describes everything wrong with the social milieu of student life. The other is the excru­ciatingly poignant seeker of self. He car­ries us through the day-to-day cosmologi­cal discoveries of an existential search for the metaphysical reality in his personal being. 
This column is dedicated to madness-
mine, yours, the world's. Individual madness is a rel­atively harmless commod­ity. It is the collective var­iety that is bothersome. One man can call for with­drawak-{)f U. S. forces, urban renewal, resistance to conscription, and elim­

ination of social injustice with little or no disturbance of rational society. But when these demented unite it creates hav­oc. Good upstanding citizens are subjected to marches on the nation's capitol, law­lessness in their business districts, and dancing in the streets. It is difficult to understand just what these hysterical min­orities are trying to accomplish. They make the rest of society uneasy, subject­ing them to numerous inconveniences. The leaders of this free republic should put a stop to these infractions on the rest of the country's right to pursue life, _liberty and happiness. America is an open political entity and it should be allowed to preserve itself. If this means correct­ing a few irrelevant madmen, then she _must be willing to make the sacrifice. 
We must instill in the people a respect · and understanding of the enlightened pol­icies of our leaders. The world must be 
safe for our way of living, thinking and acting. The ·United States is right and it is her duty to impose these policies on the emerging nations. If a few of the cit­izenry die, if a few are restricted in th~ir activities, if a few must remain in second­rate neighborhoods, if a few exist}n pov­erty and others subsist on fatback and beans-it's worth it. The people realize we 
must all get in there and do our part to make sure this great government remains what it is. Dissent must be silenced. The nation has to present a unified front to counteract the subversive influences gnaw­ing away at the very foundations of the republic. 
~­

The ever present madness is again attempting to forge inroads into Ameri­cana. It is evident in all aspects of life. Students are insolent. Blacks are rebel­lious. Puerto Ricans are outrageous. Ac­tivists are attempting to undermine the most cherished beliefs of America. Ide­ological pollution and physical violence have manifested themselves in our univer­sities and cities. They are laying waste to ._ the youth of our nation -corrupting their minds, animating their bodies. It is a sad situation but we know our duty. We must correct the ulcers festering all over our land. We must act. And we must do it Swiftly.

No Time For Sirloin At-SMC 
BY 
FRAN SCHWARTZBERG 
"The day of the home econo­mics degree has passed," said SMC President, John McGrath, in addressing the student body, Wednesday afternoon. "I, for one, am glad. Because of it, I have inherited Reidinger House." 
Speaking on the role of higher education as experienced in to­day's woman's cbllege, McGrath continued that contemporary wo­man is interested in Viet Nam, Civil Rights, the problems of po­verty and social unrest. 
She does not necessarily know the social graces, "the difference between wedwwood and plas­tic." "You will have to learn it have time to teach it here." 
Catholic education, as the di­ocesan priest from Stubenville, Ohio, sees it, is no longer restric­ted to a ghetto world. The day of complete religious supervision is gone. 
"No one is here to see that you regularly receive the Sacra­ments. We are engaged in a strug­gle for men's minds, and faced with the knowledge explosion, it is a difficult task to educate the responsible American citizen." 
Fr. McGrath believes that in the age of the "specialist" the person of emerging importance is the "generalist," the enlightened product of a truly liberal educa­tion. The duty ofthe college is to 
uce students who are " 
human." This is done by pursuing the object of the intellect, Truth, in two ways; it is to be approach­ed from the rational intellect and seen as that "which God has re­vealed or spoken." 
McGrath also disclosed the identity of SMC's commence­ment speaker, Dr. Edward Re, who was recently appointed As­sistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Af­fairs. 
In a question-answer period following his talk, Fr. McGrath discussed the role of Heald & Hobson, the educational research team which has been engaged to study the college's present situ­ation. 
Th with the problems of decreasing appeal, financial bankruptcy, and loss of accreditation, SMC has none of these problems. Instead, it is examining the educational potential; results will be made known in a written report, avail­able to the students by next Oc­tober. 

McGrath spoke of intense co­operation with ND in the future, and a possible expansion of-the co-ex program with a greater sharing of faculty, and the poten­
tial of closer contact with the Holy Cross "sister" colleges, Dun­barton and Cardinal Cushing. 
"It is most probable that our government majors will spend their junior year in Washington, 
D.C. and our hi students in Boston. This year's freshman will experience a different kind of education than our present sen­iors. With these programs in sight, should we consider the word 'merger'?" Also under con­sideration is a program fostering greater contact with the area schools, Bethel College and Indi­ana University. Idea in mind is a "total, educational community." 
Commenting upon his past five weeks at Saint Mary's, Fr. McGrath said that he was still ex­ploring the campus. "Life with 1,500 women," he remarked, "is interesting." 
Health Report Not Ready 
The full report promised from the St. Joseph County Public Health Department on the North Dining Hall food poisoning is still under preparation. Dr. Louis How, Department director, said Wednesday, "in our opinion at this time, it was a food poisoning outbreak due to staphylococcus The final report, now scheduled for completion late next week, is expected to make How's opin­ion official. 
Dr. How termed the poisoning a "relatively mild outbreak," no­ting that, although many students were affected, there was no con­tinued sickness.

Nominations opened last night for Student Body President and will continue to be open until Sunday. Thus far, the only an­nounced candidates are Pat Dowd senator from Walsh Hall. and Richard Rossie, currently a stay senator. Sophomore class pres­ident Leo Klemm, who was re­portedly considering running,has dropped out of the race. 
A pre-campaign straw poll run by the Observer shows that the candidates are running ap­proximately evenly" with per­haps a slight edge to Rossie.

 SID SAVES MOVES FOR BIG LEW 
BY TERRY O'NEIL 

By any standards, Sid Catlett should be a frustrated young man. The Notre Dame community is about as natural for him as the North Pole community would be for you. Consider his plight: 
He's a soul man amongst Beatles' and Monkees' fans. He's one of the best dressed students on a campus of sartorial slobs. -He's a Negro on a campus which is 92 per cent white. 
-He's forced to study extra hours in order to remove his name from the academic probation list and fulfill an NCAA requirement. 
-He's one of the finest basketball players at a school which refuses him even the privelege of practicing with the freshman team. Sis Catlett is a frustrated young man He talks like a prisoner who's just served the first four months of his sentence. ... "Sometimes I wonder why I came here and think I regret it. It's so different; the social life is limited and it's kind of bad just sitting on the bench, watching the other guys play. Then I think I only have half a year to go and I buckle down .. to the studies. I decided last year I'd be 
willing to sacrifice this one year for the next three years." 
Some of the frustrations Sid has al­ready eased. Last week he moved from fourth floor Cavanaugh to 34J Farley 
where he now rooms with Austin Carr. Just below, in 231, are Bob Whitmore and Dwight Murphy. "Over in Cavanaugh, there weren't that many guys I could talk 
to about basketball and D.C. Over here there's Whit and Austin." The music sit­uation has improved, too. Sid's now play­ing drums for a small combo. It comes natural to a fellow whose father drummed for both Louie Armstrong and Count Basi e. 
The academic problem is not nearly the burden it once was. Sid came up with straight C's the first semester for a 2.0 average. NCAA rules state that an ath­lete must maintain a 1.6 average to retain his eligibility. Sid's average at DeMatha 
Catholic in Hyattsville, Md., was less than 0.1 below the NCAA requirement. 
That slight margin meant about $5,000 to the Catlett family and a year of exper­ience on the court to Sid. "My scholar­ship won't start until next year, provided I have at least 1.6," says Sid. 
High school days were good ones for the 6-9, 218-pounder. "I knew Austin and Collis (Jones) real well. We won the city title my first three years," he says with a little snicker. "But Austin's team. Mackin, won last year." When the subject turns to DeMatha's win over Power Mem­

orial three years ago, Sid's memory is flawless. 
"They had won 71 games in a row with Lew Alcindor," .he recalls. "We played in University of Maryland Field­house before about 12,500 people. We used a 3-2 zone with Whitmore (in his senior year at DeMatha) and me in fore­court. We double teamed him with one of us in front and the other behind, depending on where the ball was. They couldn't get the ball in to Alcindor at all." 
"It was close the whole way and it ended 46-43. Alcindor had 16 points and nine rebounds, Whit had one point and 13 rebounds, and I had 13 points and I 0 rebounds." 
Near the end of last year, college choice became the pressing issue. "I 
talked to Austin and we decided we'd go to the same school. So we listened to Whit and Coach Dee and agreed to come. I knew when I signed I couldn't play this year. But I came out here all summer for six no-credit courses. I'd leave my dorm at eight in the morning and get back at six in the evening." 
How about next· year? "I'm going to be out here all summer again," says Sid. "I think Coach wants me to play forward so I'm going to work as hard as I can. I'm real enthused, especially about that first game. One of the big reasons I didn't go to UCLA was so I could play against Alcindor again." Next December, in his college debut, 
Sid Catlett will get his chance. In the meantime, he's saving up a lot of frustra­tions to release on Mr. Alcindor and the Bruins.
