UCC meets challenges of students 
Counseling center keeps 97 percent of student cases 
By JANICE FLYNN News Writer 
Across the countr-y, college students are reporting ­with greater frequency ­more serious mental health concerns, creating a critical challenge for college coun­seling centers. At Notre Dame, students and faculty say these challenges have been met by the University Counseling Center over this past year. 
Last year, the center saw 815 students, roughly 8 per­cent of the student body. Ov11r 90 percent received individual counseling, while the remainder participated in group counseling. 
In addition, about 97 per­cent of cases are kept within the the UCC for treatment, which is directed by Susan Steibe-Pasalich. 
Such a high retention rate contradicts the common stereotype that college coun­seling centers are not equipped to handle serious cases. 

"Counseling centers at col­leges have never been con­ceived as centers like private practices," said Ava Preacher, the victim's resource person for sexual assault and assistant dean in the· College of Arts and Letters. "[They] traditionally have been where students deal with smaller, adjust­ment problems. In the last few years as diagnoses have gotten more sophisticated, the UCC has really been called on to do a different kind of work than they had been conceived to do." 
Heather Rakoczy, rector of Pangborn Hall, said this impression does exist among students that she has dealt with. 
"What I typically hear is 
one of two things," Rakoczy said. "One, 'My problem is so serious that a University Center would not be as qual­ified to help me as a private practice would,' or two, 'My 
problem  is  not  serious  
enough."'

University finalizes Juniper R<>ad plan 
County council approves changes to Juniper, Edison 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Associate News Editor 
With its plans to close Juniper Road at Douglas and realign Edison Road approved June 8 by the St. Joseph County Council, Notre Dame is focusing on finalizing designs, dates and costs for the cam­pus roads project. _ 
Assuming design approval, phase one of the project is tentatively scheduled to begin in April 2005 and wrap up by the end of that calendar year, according to the most aggres­sive timetable designed, said vice president for business operations Jim Lyphout. This first section of construction involves demolishing a large portion of the existing Edison Road and realigning it to swing out farther south of campus as well as beginning work on a new north-south corridor where it meets Ivy Road. 
Phase two of the project calls for work to be completed on the portion of the new road that runs parallel to Ivy by August 2006 and the improve­ment to the section of Douglas from the new road to Old Juniper road by December of that year. 

According to plans detailed by University architect Douglas Marsh at an April 27 community meeting, the new road would begin off Edison west of Ivy Road and merge into Ivy between Vaness Street and Dunn Road. Moving west, it would intersect Bulla Road at a stoplight and run behind the Fischer Graduate Residences, meeting Douglas Road at a traffic roundabout. 
"This four-lane north-south corridor will be much faster than [the] current route through campus with stop­lights,'' Lyphout said. "It will be a better road and a faster road." 
Juniper will not close until all the alternative routes are in place -January 2007 at the earliest. The road will be completely razed and replaced with green space and new construction sites, possibly including two new residence halls, said Lyphout. 
Lyphout estimated costs between $22 and $23 million, but said numbers were not firm. He also confirmed the University has located a fund­ing source for the project. 
Though the current football season has just begun, there are concerns about how the new construction will affect parking and traffic situations for tailgaters over the next few years. 
Lyphout said that under cur­rent designs, the new north­south corridor will run through tailgating lots in the grassy area south of Edison Road and will make them unusable. 
"I don't think we've had any discussion yet if there are other spots we can use as sub­stitutes, but we know there is more than adequate parking north of Douglas in a huge lot that is never full,'' he said. "The more prime tailgating position will just be moved further from the stadium." 
The discussion process between the University and the affected community has been described as a "model situation," as both parties made adjustments to their positions in accordance with new concerns, said Lyphout. 
The campus road project grew mainly out of safety con-

Almost 22? 
A few weeks ago, I was perusing the various 21st birthday cards in the store and thinking about how incredibly depressing it is to turn 22 as compared to turning the mag­ical age of 21, when I noticed a

year. 
Since this is my 
birthday, you can imagine how 
annoyed I was, assuming that 
Sweetest Day is a wannabe 
Valentine's Day and a Hallmark 
ploy to increase sluggish October 
greeting card sales. 
Now, however. the day took on special significance. I probably shouldn't admit this, but I went home and Googled Sweetest Day (there's a reason people call me Queen Nerd, and it's not just because I carry a travel-size stapler in my backpack for emergency in­class paper stapling). As it often happens, uneducated pre-judgment on my part of something I knew nothing about led me to misin­formed conclusions. 
First, I learned that Sweetest Day is not a recent greeting card com­pany fabrication; a Cleveland man thought of it over 60 years ago. The day is actually not like Valentine's Day at all. The original purpose was to spread cheer by giving small gifts to the underprivileged and forgot­ten, like orphans and shut-ins. 
The idea of remembering others with kind acts, a sort of national Random Acts of Kindness holiday, is not limited to honoring the sick or orphaned today. Now, it extends to friends, family and everybody else you appreciate having in your life. 
All of a sudden, turning 22 and one year closer to impending senior citizenship didn't seem so awful. A day dedicated to making other peo­ple happy seemed almost as fun as a day dedicated to using your real license for the first time to get into Boat Club. How many people in our lives are underappreciated and unrewarded 364 days of the year? 

A lot. The dining hall card swipers who smile at you and tell you to have a nice day, the house­keepers who clean up after the slovenly college kids in your dorm and even your best friend who lets you wear her new clothes before she gets a chance to wear them, and then doesn't get mad when you spill beer on yourself at the bar because you're a clumsy drunk. Did you remember to thank them all today? 
There I was. complaining about my birthday falling on the first Saturday of fall break and nobody being here to celebrate with me, when I should have been grateful that I have friends who like me in the first place (usually). I recom­mend celebrating Oct. 16 this year by sharing your gratitude with everyone you appreciate having in your life-knowing about rampant acts of kindness will make it an even better birthday for me than 21 was. Almost.

.Saint Mary's kicks off Pride Week today 
By DANIELLE LERNER 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's College kicks off its annual pride 
week today, offering fun and exciting events to stu­
dents. 
Lauren Fabina, Student Activities Board presi­dent, said she looks forward to this week's events. 
"Pride Week gets everyone excited about being a Belle," Fabina said. "It is about creating community and being proud of what your college is." 
The festivities begin tonight at 5 p.m. with a picnic and concert by Ari Hest and special guest Nini Camps, on the library green. Events also include a scavenger hunt on Tuesday and the Saint Mary's soccer game against Hope College Wednesday at 4 p.m. 
Always a favorite among students, ghost stories and ghost tours around campus begin Wednesday evening at 8 p.m. 
"It's fun to get to know the traditions behind our community," Fabina said. 
While Thursday offers a moonlit presentation of the summer hit, "13 Going on 30", events culminate Friday as Saint Mary's co-hosts the Purdue game pep rally at Notre Dame. 
Pride week centers around Saint Mary's College and its students. Student Activities Board member Kristen Vokaty, a junior at Saint Mary's, said this week is an important time for all students, regard­less of their year.

St. Helens could soo~ see explosion 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE -A strengthening series of earthquakes at Mount St. Helens prompted seismologiSts Sunday to warn that the once-dev­
astating volcano may see  a  small  
explosion soon.  
The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  

issued a notice of volcanic unrest in response to the swarm of hun­dreds of earthquakes that began Thursday. 
"The key issue is a small explo­sion without warning. That would 
be the major event that we're wor­ried about right now," said Willie Scott, a geologist with the USGS office in Vancouver. 
The quakes were tiny at first, but on Saturday and Sunday there were more· than 10. temblors of magnitude 2.0 to 2.8, the most in a 24-hour period since the last dome-building eruption in October 1986, Scott said. 
In the event of an explosion, Scott said the concern would be focused on the area within the crater and the flanks of the vol­cano. It's possible that a five-mile 
Both events are free and open to the public. 
According to David Solomon, W.P. and H.B. White Director of the cen­ter, the symposium is intended not only to celebrate the anniversary but also "to help guide us as we. redouble our efforts to build what Pope John Paul II has called 'a Culture of Life.' Our whole mission has been inspired by the pope's cri­tique of ~ontemporary culture, especially as he expressed it in his three major encyclicals, Veritatis Splendor, Centesimus Annus, and Evangelium Vitae. These encycli­cals eloquently distill the truths at the core of the Catholic ethical tra­dition and make them speak to the most difficult ethical issues of our times." 
In addition to its sponsorship of ethical research, conferences and lecture series, the center coop­

erates with Notre Dame's Alumni Association in organizing the Clarke Family Medical Ethics Conference. annually bringing together Notre Dame alumni working in health care with distinguished theologians. philosophers and legal scholars to discuss ethical issues in medicine. 
This year the center is working with the University of Notre Dame Press to launch two publications projects: The monographs of the "Ethics and Culture Series" will be devoted to a broad range of ethical controversies from stem cell research to the death penalty, and the "Notre Dame Medical Ethics Series" will concern debates specif­ic to the practice of medicine. Plans are also being made to develop two summer institutes. one for universi­ty level and another for secondary schoolteachers of ethics and philos­ophy. 
area primarily north of the volcano could receive flows of mud and rock debris. 
That portion of the mountain blew out during the 1980 eruption that left 57 people dead, devastat­ing hundreds of square miles around the peak and spewing ash over much of the Northwest. 
The quakes have occurred at depths less than one mile below the lava dome within the moun­tain's crater. Some of the earth­quakes suggest the involvement of pressurized fluids, such as water or steam. and perhaps magma.

Pasquerllla East 
center has been 
a tremendous 
asset for stu­
dents struggling with a disor­

"We highly recommend the 
Counseling Center, especially 
[Staples]." Bove said. 
"She's wonderful, she's just 
a professional. She just has a 
way to connect to each indi­
vidual." 
Many, particularly University 
staff. have noticed the UCC 
has improved in recent years. 
Several years ago, students 
encountered long waiting lines 
before being seen on a regular 
basis. exacerbating the diffi­
culty of trying to convince 
them to seek help at the UCC. 
"I would work with a stu­
dent for weeks, and finally get 
them to go to the Counseling 
Center,". Hakoczy said. "But in 
the past that lag time between 
the assessment interview and 
when they were matched up 
with a counselor sometimes 
was weeks, sometimes was 
months." 
To avoid that situation, the staff now meets twice weekly to discuss student intake. Students are paired with one of the center's 12 psycholo­gists. based on availability and specialization. Furthermore, an on-call crisis counselor is available every day for stu­dents who need immediate assistance, a policy that has been in place for many years. 
The UCC also has a 24-hour emergency service. At any time, an on-call therapist will return a message within 30 minutes, a service that rectors say is reassuring. 

"A number of years ago I had an attempted suicide," Hakoczy said. "[The counselor on-call] immediately called me back and talked me through what to do ... I was terrified. Afterwards I was just so grateful because I had never dealt with that kind of thing before." 
Outside referrals are a rari­ty, according to the UCC. However, if the staff deter­mines that a student needs more specialized services or more intense counseling than once a week sessions, the UCC will contact agencies in either local area or in the student's home community. 
The center. remains in con­tact with the outside treat­ment facility and often gives follow-up care upon comple­tion. After treatment is com­plete, they assist with read­mission by vouching to the Office of Student Affairs on the student's behalf. 
On the other end of the spectrum. the UCC is also equipped to address less seri­ous student difficulties, a detail that is often overshad­owed by the severe problems. 
"We do lots of counseling for students with just normal developmental problems," Steibe-Pasalich said. "But [these issues] do have real psychological components that can be addressed." 
Students and staff say the UCC has been very progressive 
and proactive. In 
recent years, it

A skit performed by resi­dents of Pasquerilla East, a new addition to this year's pep rallies, provided a change in format from last year's rallies which included speeches by students and other members of the Notre Dame community. This change has received support amongst students. 
"I think it provides a little variety as opposed to what it was last year with the stu­dent speakers," sophomore Rachel Rodriguez said. "The skits add a little bit more variety and are a little more fun." 
Hak said the skits give stu­dents more time to enter the Joyce Center before missing any of the more motivational aspects of the pep rally. including big name speakers.

Fourth hurricane strikes Florida 
Jeanne tears through Florida, killing at least 5 and leaving excessive damage 
Associated Press 
HUTCHINSON ISLAND, Fla. -Jeanne, Florida's fourth hurricane in six weeks, piled on destruc­tion in already ravaged areas Sunday, slicing across the state with howling wind that rocket­ed debris from earlier storms and torrents of rain that turned streets into rivers. 
At least five people died in the storm, which was a cruel rerun for many still trying to recover from earlier hurricanes. Jeanne came ashore in the same area hit three weeks ago by Hurricane Frances and was headed for the Panhandle, where 70,000 homes and _businesses remained without power because of Hurricane Ivan 10 days earlier. 
The storm peeled the roofs off buildings, top­pled light poles, destroyed a deserted community center in Jensen Beach and flooded some bridges from the mainland to the Atlantic coast's barrier islands. More than 1.5 million homes and busi­nesses were without power. 
"The last three weeks have been horrific," said Joe Stawara, owner of a Vero Beach mobile home park where about half the 232 trailers were dam­aged. "And just when we start to turn the corner, this happens." 
Until Sunday, no state had suffered a four-hurri­cane pounding in one sea­son since Texas in 1886. And the hurricane season still has two months to go. 
Rain blew sideways in wind that reached 120 mph when the hurricane's eye hit land shortly after midnight; by 5 p.m. EDT it had weakened to a strong tropical storm, with sus­tained wind near 65 mph. 
At least a foot of water rushed through some streets in Vero Beach, where a mattress floated 

through one neighbor­hood. 
The hurricanes have prompted the largest relief effort in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's history, eclipsing responses for the 1994 earthquake in Northridge, Calif., and the 2001 ter­rorist attacks, director Michael Brown said. 
"You're going to have some areas that have been hit once, twice and sometimes maybe three times," Brown said. "That's very frustrating, I know, for those who live in those communities." 
Frances was larger, while Charley and Ivan were more powerful. But Jeanne was bad enough, once again sending the Sunshine State into a state of emergency. 
Gov. Jeb Bush sought to reassure weary Floridians. "This will become a memory," he said. "This does come to an end, and when it does we can probably use the term 'normal' again." 
Seawater submerged the bottom floor of condomini­ums on Hutchinson Island, where Josh Lumberson rode out the storm. The parking lot was under 5 feet of sand and water, and sand rose to the kitchen cabinets inside first-floor condos. The ocean, once 75 yards away, lapped at the foun~ dation. 
"It sounded like the whole building was com­ing down," Lumberson said. "You could hear every metal screw coming out of the walls." 
As the wind subsided, the clang of metal siding could still be heard on the barrier island. 
Jeanne made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of up to 120 mph just before midnight Saturday at Hutchinson Island, 35 miles north of West Palm Beach. Frances struck in almost the same spot. 
Once inland, Jeanne's 400-mile diameter system trudged across the state, passing northeast of Tampa. It then headed toward the Panhandle, which was still recovering from Ivan.

Airborne raid destroys drug lab 
Associated Press 
CUMBITARA -Seven helicopter gunships skirted the steep mountain­sides, then quickly descended on a cocaine lab, marked by a smoke grenade thrown by one of the raiders. 
As the heavily armed anti-narcotics police jumped from the hovering craft. accompanied by an informant wearing a ski mask, peasants who worked the coca fields and in the complex scampered away. 
Associated Press journalists accom­parried the officers on the lightning raid Saturday, allowing them to see firsthand the type of dangerous oper­ation that has put a crimp in Colombia's cocaine production. 
So far this year, raids have destroyed 100 labs that convert coca paste -made from the leaves of the coca bush -into cocaine, said Col. Alvaro Velandia, dep1,tty director of Colombia's anti-narcotics police. 
Saturday's raid in the mountains of southwestern Colombia showed that precise intelligence, coordination between police and helicopter squadrons and swift action are need­ed to destroy the drug labs, often located in remote, rugged regions teeming with Marxist rebels, who make huge profits by controlling the drug trade. 
After flying over vast coca fields hugging the base of steep mountain­sides, the U.S.-made helicopters ­three Black hawks and four Hueys ­circled the cocaine producing com­plex. One raider dropped a smoke grenade, its purple ·cloud billowing against a background of bright green coca bushes.

Fado is the blues of Portugal, and for a generation there was only one nome in Fodo, but a new, powerful, and beautiful voice has reached the pinnacle. Mariza, recent winner of the BBC award for best European act, sings with a passion so soulful it is difficult to believe it comes from a 28-year-old woman. It is precisely this duality that makes Mariza the epitome of Fado. Fodo is known for poetry that fuses opposite emotions-impossible pain with fervent joy, or lifes cruelty with loves intensity. Marizo is a diva-in the best sense of the word -and when she puts her personal, indelible stamp on a song, she leaves audiences spellbound and breathless.

Best known for his nationally broadcast radio program From the Top, swashbuckling pianist Christopher O'Riley has emerged as one of the most distinguished, versatile and decorated pianists of his generation. He has won the coveted Von Cliburn competition solidifying his stature among classical musicians, but has also interpreted the music of the rock group Radiohead. Not many other classical pianists hove tracks named Subterranean Homesick Alien. O'Riley will be joined by the Academy of Saint Martin in the Fields, a chamber orchestra which has been the benchmark of Baroque music for almost 50 years. They are simply the best, and when they get together with O'Riley sparks will fly. O'Riley says, "I love that dramatic aspect, the hero soloist versus the orchestra. There's such a wonder­ful sense of tension."

IN BRIEF 
Unions decide to split company 
ROME -Alitalia signed a deal with eight of nine unions Friday to split the loss-making Italian airline in two -part of the company's plan to stave off bankruptcy. 
The deal foresees the creation of AZ-Fly, a company that will bring together Alitalia's !1ight operations, and AZ-Service, which will comprise the ground services business, the company said. 
It was a breakthrough_ for management, as the unions initially had strongly opposed the plan to split the company. 
Guglielmo Epifani, leader of the country's largest union CGIL, called the deal a "mira­cle," according to the AGI news agency. 
Under the terms of the agreement, the Italian Economy Ministry. which currently holds a 62 percent stake in Alitalia, will keep a minimum stake of 30 percent in AZ-Fiy. The rest of the shares will be sold to institutional investors. 
Alitalia said AZ-Fly will have a controlling 51 percent stake in AZ-Service, with the remaining 49 percent going to a state-owned company. State holding company Fintecna is widely tipped to become an AZ-Service share­holder. Oil prices rise as production lags 
NEW YORK -Oil prices neared $49 a barrel Friday, capping a rise of 7 percent for the week, as Gulf of Mexico crude pro­duction rebounded at a slower-than-expect­ed rate in the wake of Hurricane Ivan. 
Light crude for November delivery rose 42 cents to settle at a new high of $48.88 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price of oil is up 73 percent from a year ago. 
The federal Minerals Management Service reported Friday that daily oil pro­ductU:Jn in the Gulf remains 27 percent below normal at about 1.2 million barrels per day -the same level as Thursday. The agency said 10 million barrels of oil, the equivalent of 1. 7 percent of annual produc­tion in the region, have been lost since last Monday, when offshore producers began evacuating crews. 
"There continues to be hope for a quicker rebound in output," said John Kilduff, sen­ior oil analyst at Fimat USA in New York.

Chinese block Google results 
U.S. company doesn't know how to handle Chinese ban on certain Web sites 
~sociated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO Go ogle Inc.'s recently launched news service in China doesn't display results from Web sites blocked by that country's authorities, raising prickly questions for an online search engine that has famously promised to "do no evil." 
Dynamic Internet Technology Inc., a research firm striving to defeat online censorship, conduct­ed tests that found Google omits results from the gov­ernment-banned sites if search requests are made through computers con­necting to the Internet in China. 
Steered by an identical search request, computers with a United States con­nection retrieved results from the sites blocked by China. 
"That's a problem b.ecause the Chinese people need to know there are alternative opinions from the Chinese government and there are many things being covered up by the government," said Bill Xia, Dynamic's chief executive. "Users expect Google to return anything on the Internet. That's what a search engine does."

Edwards said everyone is unit­ed on doing whatever is neces­sary to protect the country from terrorism. 
The ad, which is airing at least in Iowa and Wisconsin, shows Sept. 11 hijacker Mohammed Atta, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and other terrorists, and shows pictures of terrorist attacks in Hussia, Spain and the United States, including wreck­age from the World Trade Center towers. It asks, "Would you trust Kerry against these fanatic killers?" and says "President Bush didn't start this war, but he will finish it."

Associated Press 

LONDON -A bomb threat that mentioned Iraq forced a New York-bound Greek air­liner to make an emergency landing Sunday at London's Stansted Airport escorted by military jets, authorities said. 
An airport spokeswoman said an Athens newspaper had received a phone call saying there was a bomb on board the Olympic Airlines plane. 
"Flight 411 Olympic for America has a bomb for Iraq," a caller to the Ethnos daily said, according to a tape the newspaper made available to journalists. In a second call, a voice that sounded like a different per­son said, "Are you listening? 
Flight 411 Olympic for America, bomb. America will see. Six o'clock message for you." 
Authorities immediately notified the pilot of the call, and he asked for a military escort. 
Britain's Hoyal Air Force scrambled planes to assist the Airbus A340 airliner, the Ministry of Defense said. The plane, headed from Athens to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, landed safely at Stansted, north of London, at 3:30 p.m., an air­port spokeswoman said. 
Olympic said in a statement that it learned of the threat about two hours earlier and notified the pilot immediately. 
Chief executive Leonard Vlamis said the passengers had remained calm. 
"There was no problem inside the flight, everything was normal," he said. 
He emphasized that strict security measures had been observed at Athens' Eleftherios Venizelos airport. 
· The Stansted spokeswoman said the plane, with 301 pas­sengers and crew on board, landed in "full emergency" status and was safely evacu­ated. 
"It is not believed to be any­thing out of the ordinary at this stage," a Department of Transport spokesman said on condition of anonymity. "Fortunately nothing has exploded, if indeed ther.e was a bomb on board, but we take all threats seriously." Essex police said teams were removing all baggage from the plane for searching.

PAKISTAN 
Associated Press 
KARACHI, -Paramilitary police killed a suspected top al­Qaida operative, wanted for alleged involvement in the kid­napping of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, during a four-hour shootout Sunday at a southern Pakistan house, the information minister said. Two other men were arrested. 
Amjad Hussain Farooqi was wanted for his alleged role in the kidnapping and beheading of reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002 and two assassination attempts against President Gen. Pervez Musharraf in December 2003. 
"I as chief spokesman for the government of Pakistan confirm that our forces have killed Amjad Hussain Farooqi," Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told The Associated Press by phone from Amsterdam, where he has gone on an official trip with Musharraf. 

Ahmed said "two or three other people were also arrested during a big gunfight." He declined to identify them but said they were still being ques­tioned by authorities and were "very important." 
"This is the work of our secu­rity agencies, and they have done a great job," Ahmed said. 
An intelligence official in Karachi identified the arrested men as Abdul Rehman and Yaqoob Farooqi. It was not clear what relation, if any, Yaqoob Farooqi had to Amjad Hussain Farooqi. Other officials could not immediately confirm that information. 
Pakistan is a key ally of the United States in its war against terrorism and has arrested more than 600 al-Qaida suspects, including several senior figures in the terror network. Many of them have been handed over to 
U.S. authorities. 
Since mid-July, Pakistan says it has arrested at least 70 ter­rorist suspects, including Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan, an alleged al-Qaida computer expert, and Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian suspect in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in east Africa that killed more than 200 people. 
Earlier Sunday, intelligence officials said authorities launched a raid on the house in Nawabshah, a town about 125 miles northeast of the main southern city of Karachi, after police received a tip that Farooqi was hiding there. 
Two men who tried to flee -one of whom was injured in the gunbattle -were arrest­ed, said local police official Ismail Jamali, adding that intelligence officials led them away in blindfolds. 
A paramilitary official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the siege last­ed four hours. 
The official said the suspect who was killed -presumably Amjad Hussain Farooqi ­had shouted in Urdu, the main language in Pakistan, that he'd prefer death to cap­ture. The suspect also pointed to the sky and shouted: "I ful­filled my promise to Allah," he said. 
One woman and two chil­dren were also taken from the house. Firefighters were called to put out a blaze in one room that broke out dur­ing the gunbattle. 
After a search, officials left the house carrying three boxes. It was not immediately clear what they contained. 
Farooqi was believed to

In the more than half-century that has passed since World War II, millions of lives have been lost to war, most of them· virtually ignored. Consider what has been the most destructive conflict since World War II. No, it is not Gulf War I or Michael 
II. It is not the Poffenberger Vietnam War or the slaughtering of East Timorese. It is SayWhyNot a five-year conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that ended in 2002 after claiming the lives of at least 3 mil­lion. 
Normally, violence that involves nine different nations and claims as its victims one in every 10 citizens in a country with rainforests the size of Western Europe would demand constant front-page headlines around the world. Obviously, this was not the case. 
But what does this have to do with us? There is a long history of Western pow­ers interfering in African lives in destruc­tive ways. In the DRC, it began in 1491 when Portuguese explorers visiting the African kingdom of Kongo opened the . door to the slave trade. It progressed to 1884 with the arrival of Belgian colonial authorities, whose desire to exploit one of the world's most resource-rich regions led them to introduce forced labor to local populations, with punishment of systematic rape, torture and murder for resisting. Those policies killed ofT half of the Congo's population by 1908 and set in motion the gradual unraveling of the local norms and practices that had guar­anteed relative peace, stability and equality for millennia. With colonialism came the opportunity for previously unimagined wealth and power as well as the resulting explosion of violence. 
If you fast forward a century and a half. Western greed has taken on a more subtle tone, though it is just as real. During the recent conflict in the Congo, the governments involved (Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Angola, Burundi, Namibia, Sudan and Chad) as well as various rebel groups exploited the work of Congolese people in the diamond, coltan, and gold mines, expropriating the valuable minerals and using the profits to buy arms. The international communi­ty did nothing to stop the steady stream of Western arms going into the country (after all, there was quite a hefty profit being made for corporate arms manufac­turers). The international community failed to prevent Congolese resources from reaching our living rooms, allowing us all to participate in the violence. Conflict diamonds and gold made their way into our jewelry stores, and coltan into all of our cell phones. 

The United States also had a hand in the politics that led to the war, at times supporting the reign of President Mobutu, a dic­tator who makes Saddam look altru­istic, and at other times lending support to the forces pushing for a regime change. Always, however, the position of the U.S. on politics with­in the coun­try reflected its economic interests, prod­ded by corpora­tions looking to get their hands on the Congo's wealth. Blinded by self-interest and· the opportunity for profit, we can convince ourselves that anything is in the best interest oflocal people. The result: the death-of 3 million people, the rape of women from little girls to grandmothers, the proliferation of small arms and the screeching halt of day-to-day activity as citizens undertook forced labor or fled for their lives, banished to existence as refugees. 
Now, even as the new government in the DRC struggles to consolidate power and gain control over the numerous parts of the country still engaged in con­flict, there are once again calls to open up the mines to international investment. The meager allocation of U.N. troops in the East was recently overrun by a Rwanda-supported rebel group, and a band of militants recently crossed into Burundi and killed more than 100 Congolese refugees. Stable infrastruc­tures to guarantee peace have yet to be developed. 
This rush to profit is sowing the seeds for more bloodshed and loss of life. Earnings from Congolese mining ven­tures have never made it to those who need it most. They are not yet directed to AIDS treatment, education or farm improvement. In this resource-rich coun­try, 73 percent of the population su!Ters from under-nourishment. Structures of accountability to the Congolese people 
still need to be developed and respected. This reality must inevitably raise a question I'm sure we would rather avoid con­fronting: how many other 
conflicts which our lifestyles and corpo­rate policy contribute to are we 
ignorant or? 
Those of us on this end of the destructive cycle do not have 
to deal with any of the consequences of our irresponsibility. as we might otherwise be 

forced to search in earnest for ways we can end it. Our inaction demon­strates that we instead prefer to receive the benefits and watch the death lay out before us. The United States has the power to ensure these conflicts never reach our doorstep, even if the plunders from them do, but it is our responsibility as citizens to recognize and reject the practices that are complicit in structural violence. Meanwhile, wars rage on in Uganda, Colombia, Sudan, Burundi, Ivory Coast, Burma, Kashmir, Afghanistan ... the list goes on.

Visa represents freedom 

The decision of the Department of State, based upon information and advice provided by the Department of Homeland Security, to rescind the visa for Tariq Ramadan, a well­known scholar of Islam and Muslim leader, 
runs counter to American  
principles and values, is a  John Esposito  
threat to academic free­ 
dom. undermines  
President Bush's policies and is against America's  Guest Column  
national interest.  

Professor Ramadan is a scholar recog­nized in Europe, America and many parts of the Muslim world. He is a prominent voice of mainstream Islam. Ramadan is a scholar and public intellectual whose positions can be found in his writings, speeches and appearances in major media. He is a well­published scholar in French and English whose positions have been stated · clearly in major publications such as "To Be a European Muslim" and most recently in "Western Muslims and the Future of Islam" (Oxford University Press, 2003). Ramadan is a reformer who has argued forcefully for substantive Islamic reforms and an effective advocate that Muslims in Europe and America become integral members of the countries they inhab­it, exemplifying Western standards of toleration, pluralism and interfaith understanding. He has been active in inter­faith dialogue and an advocate of peaceful conflict resolution. At the same time, as with many intellec­tuals, political activists and religious reformers, who address major religious, political and social problems, he has taken positions on controversial topics with criti­cal comments on issues such as France's ban on the wearing of a Muslim headscarf, the authoritarian nature of many Muslim regimes, the dangers of religious extremism and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. There are those who agree with him and those who do not. 
The fact that Ramadan received his visa after a rigorous screening process used for foreign visitors and then had-it revoked without any clear explanation or evidence for the decision has raised concerns that pressure to reverse the granting of the visa came from those who disagree with Ramadan's views as a scholar and as a pub­lic intellectual. Post Sept. 11, it is especially important to remember that disagreement and controversy do not constitute a security risk. Fear of such a disagreement is rein­forced by the unsubstantiated charges and claims made by some media commentators such as the New York Sun columnist Daniel Pipes of Ramadan's alleged "links" to terror­ist groups. As is typical of many of Pipes intemperate attacks against Muslim intellec­tuals and major Muslim groups, he fails to provide any hard evidence but instead relies on hearsay, speculation and rumor. Pipes' unsubstantiated charges and specious form of reasoning would not be acceptable in an undergraduate paper. There is nothing in the public record regarding Ramadan, or in his scholarship, that would indicate any basis for such allegations. 
Denying qualified scholars entry into the United States because of their political beliefs or unsubstantiated charges brought against them strikes at the core of American principles and values and is a direCt attack against freedom of expression and academic freedom. For this reason, the decision has 
been criticized by prominent professional organizations here and overseas among them: The Middle East 
Studies Association of North America (MESA) the pre­eminent professional 
association in the field, The American Academy of Religion (AAR), the major pro­
fessional association of scholars and teachers in religion, The American Civil Liberties, The American Association of University 
Professors and oth­ers. Critics like Pipes seeks to discredit and eliminate anyone who represents positions that do not support their ideo­logical agenda in order to silence dissent. This under­mines U.S. national interests and 
weakens American prospects for suc­cess in the war against terrorism, by under­mining the influence of those Muslims who themselves oppose terrorist extremism. It runs counter to President Bush's stated poli­cy, as described by Condoleeza Rice in mid­August, to_ pursue a public diplomacy that seeks to win the hearts and minds of the mainstream majority in the Muslim world. Today, U.S. government officials should be talking to, (and the American people should be listening to), Muslim leaders like Tariq Ramadan, rather than excluding them from the United States. The University of Notre Dame and the Kroc Institute are an ideal place for such an exchange to begin. 
John L. Esposito is University professor of religion & international affairs and profes­sor ofIslamic studies at Georgetown University. His most recent books include "Unholy War: Terror in the Name ofIslam" and "What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Keeping non-partisan-status 
In response to the cries of partisanship expressed in Wednesday's Viewpoint, the steering committee for ND Rock the Vote would like to set the record straight. . 
First, certain members of the community need to realize that ND Rock the Vote is a separate venture from the national organization Rock the Vote. Beyond supplying our venture with voter registration materials and a few bold "Rock the Vote" posters, we have no affiliation with the national organization. ND Rock the Vote is a venture strictly sponsored by the Center for Social Concerns and run by student leaders from various political and non-partisan campus organizations. 
Anyone who would like to learn more about our particular mission and the events we have organized for Notre Dame in this election year can visit the Center for Social Concerns website. Likewise, anyone who would like to know the details of the Youth Venture "Choose or Lose" Grant awarded to Notre Dame by MTV can find more information and a list of the other 19 grant recipients at www.youthventure.org. 
Second, anyone who believes that partisanship pervades ND Rock the Vote should know that it appears so for one reason: College Republicans are significantly underrepresented at our weekly commit­tee meetings. 
College Republicans, please know that while your co-presidents faith­fully attend each Rock the Vote meeting, your general absence is noticeable, disturbing and unacceptable. As student coordinators, we unfortunately assume that your absence is by choice for ND Rock the Vote publicizes the time and place of our meetings -Wednesdays at 5 pm at the esc-and all are welcome to attend. 
As leaders and politically conscious citizens, College Republicans, you have an obligation to foster healthy political dialogue in your time here at Notre Dame. With 40 days left until the election, we hope that you will not continue to ignore this opportunity to share your ideas and offer your unique perspectives. 
On behalf of the steering committee, we would like to formally re­invite you and all the other loyal sons and daughters of Notre Dame to participate in ND Rock the Vote and make it your own.

Appealing to all i\mericans 
Last week, several letters to the editor attempted to defend the recent actions of the College Republicans by turning the tables on Rock the Vote and the College Democrats. In particular, Kara Bailey speculates in her Sept. 22 submission that should Rock the Vote organize a voter registration initiative in Granger or a likewise conservative community, the College Democrats would withdraw their support. 
It is funny that Bailey specifically cites Granger as an example of a town she thinks the Democrats would likely abandon. In actuality, local Democrats, including several members of the College Democrats are actively canvassing in Granger on behalf of the 2nd Congressional District Democratic candidate Joe Donnelly. Unlike the College Republicans, we Democrats believe that our party platform has something to offer to all Americans. We do not shy away from registering voters from any walk of life. Last spring, our club participated in a campus wide non-partisan voter regis­tration drive;-yel another testament to the fact that we believe in the inclu­sive ideals of our party and are not afraid of who will be showing up to the polls on Election Qay. On the other hand, by rejecting opportunities to regis­ter urban minority voters, the College Republicans sent the message to the Notre Dame comrhunity that the Republican Party is an exclusive organiza­tion that can't be bothered registering certain groups of people to vote because they can only offer benefits to those who meet a certain profil!'l.

Avanti: a true ghost story 
Play sheds light on South Bend's industrial history 

ByKCKENNEY 
Scene Wrirer 
Outside of the borders of Notre 
Dame is the city of South Bend, a 
midwest town with history like 
any other. But this history is often 
over looked as progress goes 
sweeping by. A new play written 
by an assistant professor at the 
University hopes to change that 
and shed some light on the indus­
trial history of South Bend. 
Prior to the 1960s in South Bend, Studebaker cars were once built and shipped out all over the country. With the growing prob­lems of out-sourcing, product competition and labor unions, the company died and left graves in the form of massive factory build­ings where memories haunt the production floors like so many ghosts. 
"The ghosts -the ones who belong here ... they're upset. You've upset them." 
If this sounds like an ominous setup, it is no coincidence. The show "Avanti: A Postindustrial Ghost Story" is just that, a ghost story. It uses voices of the present and past to create a story that is both historically intriguing and suspenseful. The story opens up a doorway, literally, into the past as ghosts of the Studebaker plant take a man meant to demolish the now rundown factory back to the days of the plant's actual demise. 
When a demolition team arrives at the sight of the plant, it, too, is somewhat offset by past stories about ghosts that haunt the ruins. The team did not realize that it would actually meet one of the ghosts. Separated in the maze of factory, one of the members of the team discovers the ghost of an old secretary, Irena Stoup, who worked in the plant and was there to see its close in 1963. 
She takes the foreman, Wayne Kaminski, back in time to play witness to the final days of the factory, as the last truly hopeful president of the company does what he can to keep the company afloat. His solution is to create a new, stylish car known as the "Avanti." The effort fails and the company closes a year later. The foreman goes back and forth from the past to the present, trying to draw connections with what went wrong then and how it has unal­terably affected our present day state. 

The show is produced inside the old Deluxe Sheet Metal Factory in downtown South Bend. This is the perfect setting for the show as it creates an industrial atmosphere well-suited to the setting of the show itself while at the same time offering a great deal of versatility for the production company, The Builders Association out of New York City. In terms of industrial atmosphere, the stage itself is simply a room in the factory, with concrete and grates in the floor and metal girders in the ceiling. The audience easily feels as though it is actually exploring the old Studebaker plant as the ghost guides Kaminski through the past. 
The Builders Association, how­ever, made this show truly unique and worth seeing. The Builders Association is a New York-based performance and media company utilizing the full scale of contem­porary media technology there is to offer. The writer, Professor Jessica Chalmers, knew director Mariane Weems from her days in New York and had worked before with this media-intensive style with previous shows she has writ­ten. Bringing in sound and video designers from New York, the simple stage becomes a wonder­land of sights and sounds, an interactive light show the charac­ters actually work within as though it was a real world. Scrims fly in and out of the stage to cre­ate multi-leveled scenes and add depth and dimension. Projected visualizations create the feeling of 
being in a car on the highway or let the audience see old news clip­pings of factory strikes and make them feel as though they are at the strike itself. 
As if this was not enough, there is even a musical element to the show itself as one character is heard singing at one point about the woes that he faces as the head of a failing company. Background underscoring also plays very well into the general spooky nature of the show itself. 
Ultimately, that's what this show is -a ghost story. It has the typi­cal offsetting feel of a ghost story -you don't know what's going to come next, people disappear and reappear in this reality and in oth­ers and there is an overly lying ominous tone of everything that goes on. But it becomes another kind of "ghost story" also. It becomes one in which ghosts are the main characters and they try to tell their story to a contempo­rary audience with the hopes of averting their own fates. There is an unsettling feeling as the audi­ence looks back into the past; the characters of that past seem to be able to see forward into their own fate. 
In the audience were men and women that were once on that Studebaker assembly line. For them, these are not simply voices of the past, but voices they knew. This is one of the many connec­tions to reality this show delivers that makes it strike a very real chord with the audience. While the acting or writing of the show may not be stunning, the produc­tion of it, the creation of this once real world by tantalizing all the senses, is. a compelling experience and worth the trip off campus to hear what these ghosts have to say.

Thunder from the sky 
Quinn tosses four touchdowns in 38-3 Irish victory 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN 
Sporrs Editor 
Last week they got it done on the ground, this week it was in the air. 
Brady Quinn threw four touchdown passes and Notre Dame put up 21 points in the first quarter as Washington remained winless, losing at Notre Dame Stadium 38-3. 
The Irish (3-1) put the game away early as Quinn was 9-of-13 in the first quarter, good for 14 7 yards and three touchdowns. By halftime, Quinn had thrown for 193 yards and a school record-tying four touchdowns against the Huskies (0-3). 
"I thought that we played a pretty good first half," Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said. "For the most part, we were able to do everything that we setouttodo." ~. 
Tlw quick start was unusual for this Irish t<1am, which has taken awhile to get into its game plan this season. 
"Wp, really haven't had a quick start all ynar." Willingham said. "We had a great week of practice. 
"I thought we played well at Michigan State, but I sensed the play­ers wnren't happy with the entire per­formance. They came in with a great mindset to start the week and it went from there." 
Quinn drove the offense down the field on the second offensive posses­sion of the game, going 45 yards in five plays, capped by a 24-yard touch­down pass to Matt Shelton, the first of two on the day for the senior wide receiver. 
Shelton scored again eight minutes later on a 27-yard pass from Quinn, capping an 11-play, 79-yard drive that put the Irish ahead 14-0. 
Anthony Fasano caught an 18-yard touchdown pass to end the quarter, giving the Irish a 21-0 lead. 
In the second quarter, Washington put together a 58-yard drive that was abruptly ended with a third-and-goal incompletion by quarterback Casey Paus. ·

After all, Washington is a mem­ber of the Pac-10-the same con­ference in which a member of Stanford's band once tried to impede the progress of a California player -so it's not too much of a surprise that the Huskies would put nearly their entire team (including five mem­bers of the Tuiasosopo family, at one point) in the box.

passes to seven dif­ferent receivers, including even himself at one point. 
And even though the running game was being measured in inch­es. rather than yards, just the potential threat of the Irish rush­ing attack opened up holes in tho Notre Dame passing game. 
On Quinn's first touchdown pass to Matt Shelton, the sophomore quarterback ran a play-action fake and then threw in an addi­tional pump fake to find Shelton wide open in the corner of tlw end zone. 
"If they think it's a run and we can get that edge, it definitely helps," Shnlton said. "It's a tremendous boost for a team to 
have people out there making plays and helping out the running game and doing their jobs." 
For fans of a school built on the running game-Jerome Bettis was the "Bus," not the "Plane"­the potency of the Irish aerial attack might have seemed espe­cially surprising to the Notre Dame faithful. 
By the first half, Quinn had already tied the school record for most touchdowns thrown in a game by a Notre Dani.e quarter­back. 
Yet, even the most jaded of Notre Dame subway alumni has to 
give credit to Tyrone 
Willingham and the 
this season. 

Perhaps the most terrifying thing to Notre Dame's opponents is that the Irish few] their passing game can be even better. 
"I think we still have a lot more potential," Quinn said about tlw team's passing game. "I think we eemld have taken mom advantagl' of things in the second half." 
If Notre Danw can turn that potential into results, thnrP's no limit to how high this team ean soar.

Linebackers leaders of the Irish 'D' 

By MIKE GILLOON Sports Writer 
A chain hung around their collective necks as they huddled after the game, a symbol of the tight bond that unites this team and its defense. And after Saturday's win over Washington, that same chain could represent the leash that linebackers Mike Goolsby, Derek Curry and Brandon Iloyte latched on the lluskies. 
The trio sparked an Irish defense that allowed only three points and 112 rush­ing yards against a Washington team that tallied 31 points in their previous game against UClA 
Goolsby led Notre Dame with seven total tackles while Curry and Hoyte had six each. lloyte also forced a fumble and broke up a pass while Curry had orie fumble recovery. 
Their energetic physical style all sea­son has impressed coaches and raised the level of their teammates' play. Saturday, Curry knocked the helmet off Washington quarterback Carl Bonnell early in the third quarter and energized the rest of the defense. 
''I'm pleased with how they're playing," Irish defensive coordinator Kent Baer said. "They had some good hits today and I think they're playing really solid." 
Notre Dame defensive end Kyle Budinscak said the linebackers are one of the keys to the defense. 
"Those guys fly around and they're so emotional," he said. "Not only are they leaders. they get the job done. Knowing that those guys are behind [us], we're very confident." 
Even preseason All-American Justin Tuck is spurred on by the enthusiasm and hard-hitting play of the linebackers. 
"Just feeding off people like [Derek Curry!, who is the most energetic person I've ever seen on the field, is a great thing," he said. 
Curry, who devised the idea of placing a chain on the sidelines and in the locker room to symbolize how close the Irish defensive unit is, has embraced a leader­ship role this season. 
"We know that since we call the huddle the whole defense is going to be looking at us to see how we react," Curry said. 
"When you've got guys like [Goolsby] and Hoyte to be there with you it just makes everything easier." 
Though the trio may make most of the tackles, they don't take most of the cred­it.

With Maurice Stovall injured, Matt Shelton earned his first career start at Notre Dame. and he made sure Washington knew he was there. 
The senior caught a career-high four passes, two for touchdowns en route to registering 74 yards. Ilalf of his eight receptions this snason have gone for touchdowns. 
"It's a really good feel­ing,'' Slwlton said. 
Slwlton's first touchdown came in the first quarter with 8:59 to play, putting tlw Irish ahead 7-0 after the 24-yard eompletion from Brady Quinn.

said. "Our defensive coaches do an excel­lent job with the game plan. All we have to do is go play." 
Goolsby credits the defensive line for putting him in the position to be success­ful. 
"As a linebacker, from my perspective, [the front four] gives us so many opportu­nities to make plays," Goolsby said. ''I'm grateful to have the guys that we've got in that rotation. They're doing a [heck] of a job." 
With Goolsby and Curry in their final year of eligibility, their bruising, ener­getic style of play might result from the realization that after this season they will never again don the blue and gold. 

"We talk a lot about this being our last go round and having fun while we're doing it and just playing as hard as we can for one another," Curry said. 
Goolsby echoed the words of his friend and teammate. 
"We've been through a lot together. [After the game] we were just talking about how much we love each other," he said. "That's why we play the game is to get wins like this. It was just great to enjoy it with these guys."

New Orleans m.eets Harlem· 
The Marcus Roberts Trio jazzes up the Center for Performing Arts 
By MARIA SMITH Scene Editor 
You might think a performance featur­ing Wynton Marsalis' younger brother and his pianist of six years would sound like a recap of Wynton Marsalis' per­formance at the Leighton Concert Hall. 
This was not the case. The musicians of the Marcus Roberts Trio have their own ideas about what jazz should sound like, and they leave no doubt as to what those ideas are. 
The Trio played with a 
final solo at the end of the concert. 
Guerin's performance on bass was the biggest surprise of the show. The musi­cian has mastered a style called slap bass and provided his own percussion for an incredible bass solo. 
The rapport between the drummer and bassist was another highlight of the show. The two played off each other's rhythms in a way that only comes with virtuoso musicians who know each other's style very well. 
The Trio can

together, the Trio has room to play off the audience's mood. More importantly, they have the room to listen and respond to the other musicians on stage. 
The Trio made the excellent but highly traditional set played by the LCJO sound almost tame. The thinner texture of a trio gave pianist Hoberts, drummer Jason Marsalis and bassist Roland Guerin each a chance to show their considerable tal­ents. 
Anyone who came to the concert to hear excellent jazz piano was not disap­pointed. Hoberts, who is famous for his elaborations on standard numbers, was exceptional in every piece. Solo rendi­tions of two pieces, including "Someone to Watch Over Me," gave the audience a chance to appreciate his solo talent. 
Jason Marsalis is deservedly renowned as one of the most innovative drummers playing today. He often opts for relatively simple beats despite having masterful control over the most complicated rhythms. Marsalis brought the audience to its feet when he finally let loose in his 
pianist Ellington and other jazz greats. "If Scott Joplin were here, he'd probably walk out, because this is not what he wrote," Roberts said before starting into the first standard from the first days of jazz. The piece was certainly not what Joplin wrote, nor did most of the pieces in the concert sound the way their composers originally conceived them. But if it is in the nature of jazz to evolve and to be improvisational, this may still be exactly what the composers featured in the show intended. This was not the concert for someone who wanted the same old jazz they've always heard. But judging by the stand­ing ovations after both sets and the encore, no one in the audience minded. And judging by the show Friday night, the musicians of the Marcus Roberts Trio will earn their own place in the evolving history of jazz.

AFC 
Leftwich leads Jaguars to comeback victory 
Use this headline for smaller stories 
Associated Press NASHVILLE The Jacksonville Jaguars know how to make the most of their points. Fred Taylor ran for a 1-yard touchdown with 9 seconds left Sunday, and the Jaguars beat Tennessee 15-12 for their first victory ever at The Coliseum. Jacksonville is 3-0 despite scor­ing just 35 points this season. Of course, the Jaguars have allowed only 28. The Jaguars sacked Steve McNair three times and knocked him out in the fourth quarter with a bruised sternum. He watched the final minutes from the sideline as the Titans (1-2) lost their second straight. Byron Leftwich also threw for a touchdown as the Jaguars won their first three games for the first time since 1998 and stayed alone atop the AFC South. Tennessee has dominated this series since 1999, winning nine of the previous 11 games and each of the first five games played in The Coliseum. But the Jaguars said they didn't care about history with 36 players added since the end of the 2002 season. They held Tennessee and McNair, the 2003 co-MVP, to just 249 yards. Leftwich drove the Jaguars 59 yards in 13 plays, and Taylor capped it with a run to the right side. Taylor. one of only four Jaguars left from the 1999 sea­son in which Tennessee beat them three times, ran back to the sideline with the football in his arm. Leftwich hit Ernest Wilford for the 2-point conversion, but it wasn't needed. Leftwich was 14­of-20 for 124 yards, and Taylor 
ran 17 times for 81 yards. 
Backup Billy Volek warmed up, but the Titans had left him only 3 seconds after a botched play on the short kickoff return. Drew Bennett bounced a lateral back to Samari Rolle, but he was tackled. Volek's pass to Brown bounced off his back as time ran out. 
Brown snapped the Jaguars' NFL-best streak of 17 games without allowing a 100-yard rusher as he ran for 101 yards. 
But in the end the Titans couldn't stop an offense had generated only 20 points coming into this game. The Jaguars went three-and-out on four of their first six possessions. 
Texans 24, Chiefs 21 
The Houston Texans took advantage of the beleaguered Kansas City defense when it mattered most. 
Kris Brown kicked a 50-yard field goal with 2 seconds left for a victory Sunday, keeping the defending AFC West champions winless. The Chiefs are the fourth team since 1990 to start 0-3 after making the playoffs the previous season. 
The Texans put together three plays of 20 or more yards against the Chiefs in the fourth quarter. On the winning drive, Houston marched 42 yards in 
2:16 to set up the field goal. 
The victory came despite just 76 yards rushing against a team that gave up career days to opposing running backs in the first two games. 
Priest Holmes played despite a sprained ankle, running for 134 yards and becoming the Chiefs' leading career rusher. Holmes broke Christian Okoye's record of 4,897 yards midway through the third quarter, on a 7 -yard run up the middle. 
But his failure to score from the 1 in the third quarter kept Kansas City from taking a two-

touchdown lead and resulted in a defensive score one play later for the Texans (1-2). when Marcus Coleman returned an interception 102 yards to tie it at 14. 
Trent Green threw three touchdown passes for Kansas City, which is off to its first 0-3 start since 1981, when they opened 0-4. Last year's team went 13-3 in the regular season. 
Ravens 23, Bengals 9 

Jamal Lewis up the middle. Jamal Lewis around the end. And. with the game on the line, Jamal Lewis rumbling toward the end zone. 
After two subpar efforts, the Baltimore Ravens' game-break­er found his stride Sunday. He ran for 186 yards, including a 75-yard touchdown sprint that clinched a victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. 
Kyle Boller ran for a touch­down and threw for another, but had two costly fumbles that pre­vented the Ravens (2-1) from pulling away until Lewis unleashed on his fourth-quarter run. 
He took a handoff, changed direction twice, left two tacklers empty-handed and sped off, pulling so far ahead of the defense that everyone slowed once he reached the 20-yard line. 
Lewis repeatedly plowed through the Bengals (1-2), who always have trouble bringing him down. Lewis has topped 100 yards in all seven of his career games against Cincinnati, and had a 180-yard effort against the Bengals last December. 
The record-setting runner topped 2,000 yards last year but had found little room to run so far this season. He managed only 57 in a season-opening loss to Cleveland a team he torment­ed for 500 yards last season and Pittsburgh limited him to 62 yards a week later. 
The Bengals were much easier to crack. 
Lewis powered through defenders who couldn't get a grip. They clawed at his shoul­der pads and lunged at his thighs, then found themselves 
·flailing on the ground while Lewis went on his way. 
Palmer was 25-of-52 for 316 yards, but got sacked four times and threw three interceptions, two of them to safety Ed Reed near the end zone. 
Steelers 13, Dolphins 3 

The. weather was lousy and the Miami Dolphins' offense worse, while the Pittsburgh Steelers' defense was terrific. 
Unfazed by torrential rain in the first half from the remnants of Hurricane Jeanne. Pittsburgh forced four turnovers, made a key fourth-down stop and beat the hapless Dolphins Sunday night. 
The Dolphins, who have scored 23 points in three games, fell to 0-3 for the first time since 1969, the year before Don Shula became coach. 
Steelers rookie Ben Roethlisberger, making his first NFL start, had his first pass intercepted but otherwise avoid­ed costly mistakes despite the slippery ball and footing. He fin­ished 12-of-22 for 163 yards and one score. 
Hines Ward made a diving catch of a pass from Roethlisberger for a 7-yard touchdown. Jeff Reed hit field goals of 40 and 51 yards, the latter coming after the Steelers (2-1) stopped A.J. Feeley on a fourth-down quarterback sneak at midfield. 
Announced attendance was 72,225, but with Florida just beginning to recover from its latest hurricane, the actual crowd was about 30,000. Officials decided Saturday to push the starting time back 7 112 hours to avoid Hurricane Jeanne, and heavy rain fell at times. 
The showers left standing water in the baseball infield, which made footing especially treacherous on that part of the field. The start of the second half was delayed so the grounds crew could apply additional bags of dirt. Broncos 23, Chargers 13 
The play had little to do with the game plan, much more to do with stuff players figure out in the back yard. 
Knowing Ashley Lelie had a couple inches on the guy who was covering him, Jake Plummer threw the fourth-down pass high into the end zone. Lelie reached over the defender and made the catch for a momentum-shifting touchdown that led Denver to a victory over San Diego on Sunday. 

Lelie, who is really 6-fo6t-3, did just that, winning the one­on-one showdown with 6-0 cor­nerback Quentin Jammer for the 33-yard touchdown that gave Denver (2-1) a 10-point lead late in the third quarter. 
Just as importantly, it stifled the momentum San Diego (1-2) gained moments earlier when the Chargers recovered Quentin Griffin's third lost fumble of the season and converted it into a touchdown to cut Denver's lead to 13-10. 
The San Diego score turned an already slumbering lnvesco Field into a library, and it got even quieter when the Broncos stalled at midfield on their next drive. 
Plummer finished with 294 yards and two touchdowns, including a 16-yarder to Hod Smith to open the scoring. Lelie, largely considered a disappoint­ment his first two years in Denver, caught four passes for 67 yards and his first TD since Sept. 28, 2003, a span of 15 games. 
Speaking of droughts, San Diego fell to 1-9 in Denver since 1995. 
LaDanian Tomlinson ran for 60 yards and has yet to break the 100-yard mark in four games at Denver. Drew Brees threw for 121 yards, and never got into the flow. In fact, he had more yards receiving (38) than passing (16) at halftime, cour­tesy of a first-quarter reception from Tomlinson on a trick play that resulted not in a touch­down, but a field goal.

On the 18th, Kim's birdie putt rolled left of the hole. But Webb then missed her birdie attempt and had to settle for second place. 
''I'm disappointed I didn't make that putt on 18, but I can't be disappointed in the way I played all week," Webb said. 
After making her two-foot putt for par to clinch the win, Kim went to her knees, began to cry and eventually sought out her dad for a hug. 
"Watching that putt [of Webb's] was agonizing," Kim said. "It seemed to roll so slow­ly. I thought it was in, then it sped up and went past the hole. I stood dumfounded. It was the longest two-footer [for the win] I ever had to make."

"She [Kim] must have played well today. I saw all her putts," said Inkster, who played in the final group behind Kim and Webb. "All the holes were right in front of us, you could see what they were doing all day." 
Third-round leader Leta Lindley, who entered the final round a shot ahead in search of her first· LPGA victory, dropped off the leader board following a double bogey at No. 11 and shot a 76. 
The best round of the day belonged to Anna Acker­Macosko, who shot an 11­under 60 and made a run at Annika Sorenstam's tour record of 59. 
It was the second round of 60 this year. Jung Yeon Lee had a 60 on the par-70 course in Tucson, Ariz., during the first tournament of the season. 
Acker-Macosko walked to the 18th green with a chance for one more birdie, which would have given her a share of the record. The downhill 30-foot putt broke right of the hole and she made a short putt for par. She finished at 13-under 271. 
"I wasn't thinking about win­ning the tournament, I was thinking about the 59," said Acker-Macosko, who also missed a 23-foot birdie putt on 
17. "It's probably the closest I'll ever come to tying one of Annika's records. It's a once­in-a-lifetime round." 
Hee-Won Han (65) finished fourth and Jeong Jang (62) tied Acker-Macosko for fifth place.

Cardinals contain Vick, still lose to Falcons 
Vikings beat Bears in divisional battle 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Michael Vick wasn't much help. The Atlanta Falcons had to rely on their defense and Arizona's inept offense to get to 3-0 for the first time since 1986. 
The Falcons forced Arizona quarterback Josh McCown into three fumbles and managed to win with a pair of field goals by Jay Feely, beating the winless Cardinals 6-3 in a downright ugly game Sunday. 
How ugly? There were nine fumbles (seven resulting in turnovers), five calls that had to be reviewed by the referee (two were overturned) and not one touchdown despite countless opportunities by both teams. The Cardinals (0-3) lost three fumbles inside the Falcons 20. 
Atlanta did its best to give the game away in the fourth quar­ter. Vick threw a pass that was intercepted by Adrian Wilson and returned to the Falcons 18, but the Cardinals had to settle for Neil Rackers' 30-yard field goal with 9:24 remaining. 
Warrick Dunn, who rushed for 117 yards, fumbled at the Atlanta 19 with 3:19 remaining, giving the Cardinals a chance to at least kick a tying field goal. Of course, they promptly gave the ball right back. 
On a reverse, receiver Karl Williams got to the 7 but the ball was jarred loose by Chris Draft. Bryan Scott recovered for the Falcons with 2:26 remaining. 
Finally, Vick broke loose. He ran for 58 yards on a bootleg the longest carry of his career to seal the victory. The Falcons are 3-0 for only the third time in their 39-year history. 
Vick struggled the rest of the game, one week after account­ing for 288 yards rushing and passing in a victory over St. Louis. fie was sacked five times, turned the ball over three times and went just 1 0-of-20 for 115 yards. 
The Cardinals couldn't take advantage. Rod Coleman forced a couple of fumbles and Brady Smith finished ofT McCown with a blindside hit that led to anoth­er turnover in the fourth quar­ter. Patrick Kerney had a career­high three sacks for the Falcons, who had six sacks overall. 
McCown went 20-of-26 for 198 yards, but was replaced by Shaun King after the third fum­ble. The backup quarterback couldn't rally the Cardinals, who have managed just 25 points and two touchdowns in their first three games. 
VIkings 27, Bears 22 
As its injury list grew longer, Minnesota's high-powered offense was consistently limited to low-risk plays by Chicago's cover-2 defense. 
But the Vikings passed this patience test against the similar­ly banged-up Bears. 
Daunte Culpepper threw two touchdown passes to Randy Moss and ran for another score, helping Minnesota hold off Chicago on Sunday. 
"We just take whatever the defense gives us," said Onterrio Smith, who rushed for 94 yards and caught six short passes for 104 yards out of the backfield. 
Minnesota (2-1) has a week off to heal, but Chicago (1-2) must travel to unbeaten Philadelphia next week with several ailing starters. 
Quarterback Rex Grossman scored on a 6-yard scramble at the 2-minute warning, but he sprained his right knee on the play and left the stadium wear­ing a brace and using a crutch. He went 21-for-31 for 248 yards. 
Chicago got the ball back with 1:36left at its 10, but backup QB Jonathan Quinn was sacked by Kevin Williams on fourth down. 
"We have faith in him and have confidence in him," coach Lovie Smith said. 
Culpepper completed 19 of 30 passes for 360 yards, 119 of them to Moss. The Vikings never found a rhythm, but they made enough long gains to control a game otherwise bogged down by injuries, penalties, turnovers, more injuries and more penal­ties. 
Saints 28, Rams 25 
Even without Deuce McAllister, the New Orleans Saints' running game is in good hands. 
Perturbed after being described as a journeyman, fill­in Aaron Stecker responded with his first career 100-yard day in the Saints' overtime victory over the St. Louis Rams on Sunday. 
Stecker's performance added balance for the Saints, who also got big games from Aaron Brooks, kicker John Carney and defensive end Charles Grant, who had three of his team's five sacks. 
Stecker, who entered the game with 443 yards in four-plus sea­sons, was supposed to split time with Ki-Jana Carter, and the Saints figured to struggle on the ground with McAllister sidelined by a high ankle sprain. Stecker ended up with 106 yards on 19 carries, including a 42-yard touchdown run. 
"Hey, I'm a running back," Stecker said. "It's not like they pulled me out of the front office and said 'Deuce is out, do you know how to play some running back?' 
"I believe in myself and my teammates had no doubt in me." 
Brooks calmly directed the winning drive, Carney kicked five field goals and Grant led a strong defensive effort that com­bined to end the Rams' 15-game regular-season home winning streak. The Saints have never been intimidated by the Rams' home, winning in St. Louis in 2000 and '01, when both teams were in the NFC West. 


New Orleans (2-1) somehow forced overtime after the Rams (1-2) took the lead on Marc Bulger's 19-yard scramble with 28 seconds to go. Then they stuffed the Rams' once high­powered offense in overtime and drove to Carney's clinching 31­yarder with 7:59 left in over­time. 
The Rams won the toss in overtime, and they converted a somewhat ill-advised fourth­and-1 play from their 41 to keep the drive alive. Then they promptly lost momentum, punt­ed and never got the ball back. 
The Rams (1-2), who won the NFC West last year, have yet to force a turnover. Last year, they lost two of the first three on the road before recovering to go 12­4. 
Brooks was 24-for-41 for 316 yards and a touchdown. More important, he was 3-for-4 for 42 yards on the winning drive, and his 12-yard bootleg run to the St. Louis 13 set up Carney's field goal. 
Eagles 30, Lions 13 

After falling a game short of the Super Bowl the past three years, the Philadelphia Eagles seem to have the swagger and talent they've been missing. 
Donovan McNabb threw for 356 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a score, Terrell Owens caught six passes for 107 yards and a TO and Jevon Kearse had three sacks to lead Philadelphia to a win over the Detroit Lions. 
In a game between unbeatens, the Eagles made a resounding statement. 
And with a championship-or­bust mentality, Philadelphia is not satisfied with its first 3-0 start since 1993. 
"We haven't played our best and that's exciting," McNabb said. 
Rookie receiver Roy Williams had nine receptions for 135 yards and two TDs for the sec­ond straight week for the Lions, who had a chance to go 3-0 for the first time since 1980. 
Other than games to avoid or end futility records, the Lions played in their biggest matchup since the 2000 finale, when they lost to Chicago and fell to 9-7 and out of the playoffs. That set­back led to the hiring of presi­dent and general manager Matt Millen and coach Marty Mornhinweg, now Philadelphia's

AMERICAN LEAGUE 
Red Sox hand Brown, Yankees another rout 
Angels close within one game ofOakland 
Associated Press BOSTON --The Red Sox ended their home season in typical fashion with another brilliant performance by Curt Schilling and another bench-clearing con­frontation with the Yankees. Schilling (21-6) allowed one hit in seven innings Sunday when Boston beat New York 11-4 and knocked Kevin Brown out in the first inning of his return from a broken hand. The Red Sox (93-62) won 11 of 19 from the Yankees (97 -59) to take the season series for the first time in five years and cut 
New York's AL East lead to 3 1/2 games with one week to play. 
"We probably play them too much," Boston's Johnny Damon said with a smile. "There's too much anxiety brewing." 
In the top· of the eighth, Boston's Pedro Astacio was eject­ed for throwing behind Kenny Lofton and both teams were warned by plate umpire Jim Wolf. 
In the bottom half, New York pitcher Brad Halsey and manag­er Joe Torre were ejected after Halsey threw a pitch high and tight to Dave Roberts, causing the benches and bullpens to clear. Players were kept apart. 
On July 24, also in Fenway Park, the teams fought after Alex Rodriguez was hit by a pitch by Bronson Arroyo and was shoved in the face by catcher Jason Varitek. 
Schilling, who leads the major leagues in wins, is 12-1 at Fenway this season, the first since Boston acquired him from Arizona. He's won eight straight decisions for the f1rst time in his major league career. 
Boston scored four runs in the first off Brown (10-5), who got just two outs, then made it 7-0 in the second against Esteban Loaiza, who allow~d seven runs in 4 2-3 innings. 
After losing Friday's opener, Boston won the last two games. A week earlier, the Red Sox won on Friday in New York then lost the next two by 10 runs each. 
The Red Sox have seven games

left and likely will wind up with the AL wild-card berth they lead Anaheim by six games. They could meet the Yankees for the second straight year in the AL championship series. 
Angels 6, A's 2 
The Angels know how to bounce back. 
John Lackey fell behind early before Anaheim rallied behind three RBis from Troy Glaus to beat Oakland 6-2 Sunday to close within one game of the AL West­leading Athletics with a week to play. 
"We got to keep pushing," Lackey said. "We got to be at our best these next couple of games." 
After losing Friday's series opener, the Angels won two straight and head to Texas for a four-game series starting Monday before closing with three games at Oakland. The 1\s, who hold a two-game lead over the Rangers, host Seattle for four games starting Monday. 
"It's going to be an interesting finish," Oakland manager Ken Macha said. 
Mark Mulder (17 -7) was knocked out in the fourth inning, his shortest outing this season. Oakland, which has had sole pos­session of the division lead since Aug. 6, dropped to 10-14 in September. 
Lackey (14-12) gave up two runs and four hits in seven innings, improving to 10-4 since June 16 and evening the season series at eight apiece. 
Mariners 9, Rangers 0 
The Texas Rangers might not be in a must-win situation yet, but they're hurting their playoff chances with each loss. 
Texas managed just three hits Sunday off rookies Cha Seung Baek and Scott Atchison in a loss to the last-place Seaftle Mariners. 
"Any loss at this point is a tough loss," shortstop Michael Young said. "We realize this loss is not the end of the season, but it does make it tougher on us." 
The Rangers started their final homestand with a three-game sweep of AL West-leading Oakland, against the starting trio of Mark Mulder, Barry Zito and Tim Hudson. They got within two games, but missed out on a chance to get closer by losing two of three to Seattle. 
The Rangers remained two back after the Athletics lost 6-2 Sunday nigbt at Anaheim. The Angels, who are one game out of first, begin a four-game series in Texas on Monday. 
A surprise contender after four straight last-place finishes, the Rangers end the regular season next weekend at Seattle. 
"What's shorter than a sprint? A dash. How about a leap?" manager Buck Showalter said. "There is still an opportunity for us ifwe keep grinding." 
Ichiro Suzuki moved within six 
of the season hits record, going 
1-for-4 with an intentional walk. 
His sixth-inning single raised his 
total to 251 with seven games 
remaining to reach the record of 
257, set by George Sisler in 1920. 
Baek (2-4) allowed just three 
hits in eight innings, and 
Atchison pitched a perfect ninth 
to complete Seattle's seventh 
shutout of the season. 
The Mariners are trying to 
avoid 100 losses just three years 
after winning 116. 
White Sox 5, Royals 1 
Jon Garland's impressive per­formance against Kansas City did little to change his opinion of his overall performance this year. 
Garland pitched into the ninth inning, and Wilson Valdez hit his first career homer to lead the Chicago White Sox to a victory over the Kansas City Royals on Sunday. 
Garland (11-11) came within two outs of his second complete game of the season, and first since June 20 at Montreal. It was his first victory since Sept. 3 against Seattle. 
Brian Anderson (5-12) allowed five runs on nine hits for the Royals, who lost for the 98th time this season the second-most loss­es in franchise history. Only the 2002 team (62-100) lost more. 
Twins 6, Indians 2 
Omar Vizquel got a warm send -off in possibly his final home game for Cleveland, and the Minnesota Twins reached 90 wins for the third straight season with a victory over the Indians on Sunday. 
Vizquel, the Indians' wildly popular shortstop, went 1-for-4 in the team's home finale per­haps his last wearing Cleveland's white jersey. 
Carlos Silva (14-8) allowed one run and eight hits in seven innings, improving to 4-0 in his last eight starts. Jacque Jones had two RBis to help the playoff­bound Twins win for just the sec­ond time in six games. 
The AL Central champions (90­

. 66) are still trying to clinch home-field advantage in the f1rst round. 
Vizquel, a three-time All-Star and nine-time Gold Glove winner, is expected to become a free agent in November. He has a mutual $5 option for next season that the Indians are not likely to pick up. 
The 37-year-old Vizquel wants to stay in Cleveland and said before the game that he's willing to accept a one-year deal to remain and retire with the Indians. 
Playing in his 747th game at Jacobs Field, Vizquel received a loud ovation each time he came up. He led off the sixth inning with a single but was forced on a double play. 
Before stepping into the bat­ter's box in the eighth for his last at-bat, Vizquel waved to the crowd and then took a deep breath before digging in. 
He then grounded out to sec­ond, but not before he tried to beat the throw with a headfirst dive into first base, the type of play that has typified his stellar career. 
Orioles 5, Tigers 0 
Rodrigo Lopez put an appropri­ate finish on the Baltimore Orioles' season-long domination of the Detroit Tigers. 
Lopez pitched a three-hitter for his second career shutout, and the Orioles completed their first season sweep of Detroit with a victory Sunday. 
Miguel Tejada homered and drove in three runs, and B.J. Surhoff also connected for the Orioles, who went 6-0 against the Tigers in 2004 the f1rst time in the 51 years that Baltimore has been in the AL that the Orioles· went unbeaten against Detroit. 
''That's pretty impressive, no matter who you play," Baltimore 
-

manager Lee Mazzilli said. 
Baltimore outscored the Tigers 22-12 during a three-game sweep in Detroit in May, then beat the Tigers by a combined 15-5 margin in this weekend's sweep.

leading ERA to 2.25, the Padres pulled within 2 1/2 games of the Chicago Cubs in the wild-card race and remained 4 1/2 games behind first-place Los Angeles in the NL West.

Pittsburgh 4, Cincinnati 2 
The Pirates finished the home portion of another dismal season with a victory. 
Slumping Tike Hedman hit a pair of run-scoring singles, and Pittsburgh beat the Cincinnati Reds Sunday to stop a five-game losing streak. 
Pittsburgh went 39-41 at PNC Park and has not had a winning record at home since going 45-36 in 1999. The Pirates, 69-86 over­all, are assured of their 12th con­secutive losing season. 
Wilson helped save the win by starting a spectacular double play in the eighth. Leadoff hitter Anderson Machado walked and pinch hitter Jacob Cruz grounded a ball sharply up the middle. Wilson made a diving stop, then used his glove to flip the ball to second baseman Jose Castillo, who made an accurate throw to first as Machado was sliding into him.

"It felt good," he said of the game. "It feels good now to be back in almost full health." 
Putting one in the confer­ence win column also felt good for the veteran defender. 
"The biggest improvement was coming on and playing how we wanted to play," said Goldthwaite. "Last Thursday we didn't really play how we wanted to play." 
The defense held steady throughout the game, forcing goalkeeper Chris Sawyer to make only one save. Fellow defenders Jack Stewart, Christopher High, Ben Crouse and Ryan Miller welcomed back the steadfast left back. 
On the offense, the Irish recorded 12 shots with six on goal. Nine of the shots came in the second period as the offense found their stride in the Wildcats' danger zone. Villanova goalie Craig Bald recorded five saves.

Belles upset by Olivet in 4-1 loss 
By RYAN DUFFY 
Sports Writer 
Sometimes, there are just no words for a game like this. 
Entering Saturday's game undefeated in MIAA play, Saint Mary's was upset 4-1 by Olivet College, dropping them out of first place in the conference and leav­ing them wondering what went wrong. 
"I don't even know what to say. I'm speechless," sophomore Ashley Hinton said. "We didn't look like ourselves out on that soccer field. We didn't come out and play well." 
The Belles trailed for most of the game, and after tying the game at 1-1 midway through the first half, they allowed three unanswered goals to close out the game. The only bright spot came when senior Katie Noble received a corner kick and managed to slip the ball around a large group of players for a goal. 
"Olivet just took it to us," said Hinton. "They knew that we were one of the better teams, and they just brought their game." 

The Belles entered the game having given up the least amount of goals in the MIAA conference, but they had no answer Saturday for sophomore Stacey Stickney, who scored all four goals for Olivet College. Olivet was 1-2 entering the game, but displayed an unexpected dominance over the Belles. 
"It just proves that on any given day, any MIAA team can come out and play a great game," Hinton said. "Being in first place in the conference, \Ve've got a target on our back. Every team that faces us is going to want to beat us. The MIAA is such a strong conference that no matter what place a team 
. is in, no team can be taken light­ly." Although the loss is certainly demoralizing, the players recog­nized the fact they had an off day. "It definitely wasn't like we entered this game unprepared," Hinton said. "We were shocked 
throughout the game, but we never gave up at any point. We just couldn't find the net. 
"As hard as we tried, the shots just weren't falling." Rather than dwell on Saturday's mistakes, the Belles will-instead look forward to foeus on a big upcoming week. 
"We want to shake off this loss and move forward. We've got a big week coming up, and we need to set our sights on that. We'd like to stay real positive and come ready to play for every game for the rest of the year." 
Though the Belles can no longer achieve their goal of going undefeated in MIAA play, they still have high hopes for winning their conference. 
"We still feel confident for the rest of the MIAA season," Hinton said. "We need to just learn from thiis and move on. We've got to come out strong for Hope and Calvin and redefine what we want to do in this conference."

score, the Irish used Saturday's layoff to rest up and prepare to repeat their successful round and make a run at the title Sunday. They accomplished both things Sunday, storming through the competition and shooting a combined 297 to finish at 593 and move from one behind leader Missouri to four strokes in front of second­place Oklahoma, who fin­ished with a 597. 
Remarkably, every I.rish golfer finished with scores below 80 in both rounds, a remarkable feat, especially considering the weather. Leading the charge for the Irish was junior co-captain Katie Brophy, who not only led the team but also won the tournament by two strokes over Amparo Gala of Oklahoma. Brophy fol­lowed her .impressive round of 69 Friday, which left her in second place, with an even par 7 2, a score good enough to secure a victory for her. 
With her third individual title, Brophy set the career Notre Dame record for indi­vidual titles, a record that she has plenty of time to improve on. 
Right behind Brophy in the standings was sopho­more Noriko Nakazaki, who followed her three-Dver-par 75 on Friday with a two­

Guillen suspended for season 
Associated Press 
ANAHEIM -Angels left fielder Jose Guillen was sus­pended for the rest of the sea­son Sunday because of his out­burst after being lifted for. a pinch runner a day earlier. 
Guillen was informed of the club's decision after batting practice, when the Angels closed their clubhouse for 75 minutes. Anaheim said he was being suspended without pay and the suspension would con­tinue into the postseason in the Angels qualify for the playoffs. 
"He was obviously not happy with the decision," Anaheim general manager Bill Stoneman said. "Unfortunately, this was not the first time something has cropped up with Jose." 
Guillen was hit by a pitch to open the eighth inning of Saturday's 5-3 victory over Oakland. Manager Mike Scioscia sent Alfredo Amezaga in to pinch run. 
Guillen walked off the field as the A's changed pitchers, tossed his helmet toward the side of the dugout Scioscia was standing in and walked to the opposite side of the dugout before entering. He slammed his glove against the wall. 
Scioscia downplayed the 

incident, as did Guillen after the game. However, Scioscia said he didn't sleep Saturday night. 
"We had to do something with Jose," he said. "This is about the organization, not one guy. Bill wanted to be loud and clear with the message. It was an issue getting in the way of winning." 
Stoneman said the club advised the commissioner's office of Guillen's punishment and send a fax to the players' association. Stoneman said the decision was based on the team's opinion that Guillen violated the conduct provision in the uniform player's con­tract. 
Guillen's agent, Adam Katz, declined comment. 
"It's certainly not conduct that we would expect," said Stoneman, who reached the decision with Scioscia. 
Sciascia wouldn't say whether Guillen was contrite when told of his suspension. 
"He understands the line he crossed," Sciascia said. "It was needed. It wasn't just from yesterday." 
Guillen will not be allowed to be with the team the rest of the regular season, which ends next Sunday. Stoneman said the decision was "very difficult" because the Angels

are chasing division-leading Oakland in the AL West. 
"This is something we con­sidered very carefully," he said. 
Guillen, who signed a $6 million, two-year contract during the offseason, went on a profanity-laced tirade after being beaned in a game at Toronto in May, complaining that his teammates weren't retaliating for him. Anaheim pitcher Jarrod Washburn was annoyed Guillen went public with his complaint. 
Catcher Bengie Molina and utility outfielder Jeff DaVanon expressed surprise at the sanction. 
"He's aggressive, he's a good teammate," Molina said. "I would be more than glad to have him back." 
Reliever Troy Percival said the team's focus has to remain on the pennant race. 
"It's not shock level because we don't have time for that," he said. "If we start thinking about anything else than win­ning ballgames, it's not going to help us at all." 
Adam Riggs started in place of Guillen.

half that if we got one, we could break it open." Waldrum said. 
The Irish did in fact extend their lead three minutes left in the game. A left side corner kick from Thorlakson was sent to Tancredi, who headed the ball to the right side of the pocket. The pass set up Candace Chapman to score her sixth goal of the season. 
Despite having to come from behind for the 3-1 victory, Waldrum was pleased with the way his team performed. 

"The character of the team showed and if we are really going to be the best team in the country, we have to come back and win games like this," Waldrun said. Notre Dame 4, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay 0 
The Irish continued their dom­inance Sunday after playing the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. Notre Dame began the match by doing what Waldrum had set out to do, take advan­tage of the early opportunities. 
The team took advantage in the first half by scoring four goals out of its first five attempts. 
The first two goals came from Thorlakson within the first 20 minutes of the contest. Five minutes later, the third goal came off an assist from Thorlakson to Cinalli who scored at the top of the box for the 3-0 lead. 
The fourth and final goal of the half was scored by Annie Schefter who drove to the top of the box and hit the right side of the net. 
During the second half, the team made several changes to its lineup and failed to score. However, the Irish did manage to keep Wisconsin-Green Bay scoreless in the second period to get the shutout. 
Despite being kept scoreless for the second half of play, Waldrum remained optimistic with the team's performance on Sunday and is looking for the Irish to continue to mature and find chemistry on the field. 

"I think if we keep sharp men­tally and keep our focus as a team that we have a great shot at making a good run [in the NCAA Tournament]." Waldrum said. 
Another contributing factor to the team's overall success is Thorlakson's presence on and off the field. 
"She is one of the best players in the country. We have not come across any of the top teams this year and seen any­body play better than her," Waldrum said. "Hopefully [this year] she will get the recogni­tion that she really deserves." Notes:

SMC CROSS COUNTRY 
Belles take sixth at Jamboree 
By ANNA FRICANO 
Spom Writer 

The Saint Mary's cross country team finished sixth overall Saturday at the MIAA Jamboree at Hope College. The team's top runner, Megan Gray, was injured in the middle of the race and had to finish the day on a twisted ankle. 
Meghan Murphy, who fmished in the top spot for Saint Mary's and 23rd overall, had nothing but words of praise for her team­mate. 
"[Megan[ was in a lot of pain and she finished strong ... she still had a really good attitude," Murphy said. 
Gray, who took to icing her ankle after the race, is question­able for the upcoming races but will certainly return in time for the conference championship at the end of October. 
Although the team didn't finish as high as the fourth place spot that they are hoping to end the season with, they still view the race as a success. 
"Everyone tried their hardest, and it was obvious in their per­formance," Murphy said. 
The Belles finished only two points behind the fifth place fm­ishers, Alma College. Since this meet only accounted for one third of the total conference points, the Belles can still finish above Alma. 
Additionally, Becky Feauto and Katie White, who finished second and third respectively for Saint Mary's, both recorded their best times so far this season. Their strong finishes were a good indi­cation that every runner on the team can peak near the end of the season, which is exactly what coach Dave Barstis is planning on. That capability will be most important in a few weeks, when the conference standings are on the line. 
Few surprises occurred in the standings of the Jamboree. Hope and Calvin dominated the compe­tition, finishing well ahead of all other schools. Albion did overtake Kalamazoo College for a spot in the top three, and Saint Mary's put themselves in a comfortable spot in the conference. 
"I think we fulfilled our expec­tations and had fun ... everybody was in a great mood after the race," Murphy said. 
The Belles are now looking ahead to the Oct. 30 race that will decide the season. They will use the next five weeks to recuperate, train and prepare themselves for the championship meet.

Belles defeat Olviet, Hope in tournatnent 
By JUSTIN STETZ Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's finally had something to smile about on Saturday. At the Hope College Triangular the Belles came out with a pair of conference vic­tories over Hope College and Olivet College. 
The wins improve the Belles' record to 3-5 in the MIAA, placing them only one game behind Hope College for sixth place. The team is only 3-8 on the year, but put themselves right back in the hunt in the league. 
"We always knew we could do it," senior Michelle Gary said. "Hope is a huge rival for us and always has been. There have been other things outside the matches that have affected us and I think we were able to finally get passed that." 
In the first match against the Flying Dutchman, the Belles won in live tight games. They came out of the gates strong to capture the first two contests by scores of 32-30 and 30-24. However, things got a little tense as Hope evened the score with two wins of its own. But in the fifth and finalgame, Saint Mary's was able to seal the victory with a 15-12 win. 
Michelle Turley and Shelly Bender led the charge with 15 and 12 kills apiece respective­ly, while Anne Stephanie Bauer collected 19 digs. Amada David had 16 digs of her own. 
Another key statistic in the match was the team's ability to block. Behind a strong defen­sive showing, Saint Mary's had 
13.5 blocks in the contest. 
"The biggest change was our net defense," Gary said. "Great blocking gives our team ener­gy and the back row played well when we needed it." 
The second match against Olivet proved to be an easier victory for the Belles as they rolled over the Comets in three straight games. 
Saint Mary's won the first game by a score of 30-25. and from there things only got bet­ter. They held Olivet to 21 points in game two and pun­ished the Comets in the final game by holding them to only 13 points. 
The offense was powered by a strong overall performance from the entire team, as a variety of players contributed to the victory. On defense, Gary and Anne Cusack played very well and supplied the majority of the digs. 
Saint Mary's will have time to polish up its game this week. The Belles are idle until Saturday when they return to their home floor against Albion College at 11 a.m.

Thorlakson, Irish stay perfect 
By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Writer 
The No. I ranked Irish (1 0-0­

0) apparently needed a chal­lenge to prove why they are the top-ranked program in the nation. 
Friday night's 3-1 victory over Pittsburgh (3-0-0) was not an easy win for Notre Dame as the team found itself with a deficit in the first half. 
Tho physil~al style of' play by the Panther oiTense turned out to be bnnelidal f'or Pittsburgh as the team seored in the 31st minute of the game. Pittsburgh midfielder Erin llills tracked down a loose ball and seored outside the top of' the box over Irish goalkenpPr Erika Bohn to give the Panther's a 1-0 lead. 
The Irish struggled to find the net throughout the _first half despite having nine opportuni­ties. As the dock wound down towards halftime, it was appar­ent a sense of urgency began to a!Tnct the Notre Dame's play. 
"When it was getting a little closer to halftime, you could see a little bit of panic in the kids," Irish coach Randy Waldrum said. "That is one of the things we wanted to solve at halftime was to just calm down and relax." 
In the second half, the team continued to struggle early on with finding the net. It wasn't until 19 minutes left in regula­tion that the Irish finally scored their first goal. An assist from Kim Lorenzen opened up the shot f'or Melissa Tancredi at the top of the box and the ball was

"We had plenty of time in the next half but it was important that we got the next goal. We couldn't go two down," Waldrum said. "Fortunately, it was Melissa's goal off the deflec­tion, and we'll take it anyway we can get. But it got us back in." 
Once the Irish scored, it only took the team three minutes to find the net once again. The goal came oft' a penalty kick by Katie Thorlakson. The penalty kick was awarded to the Irish after freshman forward Amanda Cinalli was tackled in the box by the Panther's Rachel Vecchio.

McGeeney puts Irish over Wildcats 
Goldthwaite returns to Irish lineup for the first time this season as No.9 Notre Dame defeats former conference leader No. 21 Villanova 
By KATE GALES Sports Writer 

Twenty-three feet of net space has never loomed so large in the Big East confer­ence. 
On Thursday, the Irish statis­tically dominated West Virginia but dropped the match with a final score of 1-0. On Sunday, the Irish toppled the Villanova Wildcats when sharpshooter Justin McGeeney found the back of the net early in the sec-and period. 
After losing to West Virginia, the Irish improved to 5-2-1 overall and 2-1 in the Big East conference. Sunday's victory stifled a five-game winning streak from Villanova, who fell tg 5-1-1 and posted a 3-1 record in the conference. 
"After the loss, it was great," said defender Kevin Goldthwaite. "The guys were super motivated and ready to play, [and] I guess that's all you can ask for coming off a loss like that." 
McGeeney's game-winner was an important step forward for the Irish. 
"We eame out with a lot more intensity today," he said. "I think that was really what was missing in Thursday's game and we really wanted to come out hard [against Villanova) and get the tirst goal." 
Scored in the forty-seventh minute, McGeeney's goal was recorded as unassisted off a ball played into the box by Tony
