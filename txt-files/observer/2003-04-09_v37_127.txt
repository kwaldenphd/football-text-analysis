Janet Reno, former attorney general under President Clinton, addressed over 400 students and members of the public Tuesday night in Stepan Center. 
The nation's former top law enforcement officer praised Notre Dame's "sense of public service" as she discussed issues ranging from Elian Gonzalez to the war in Iraq. She emphasized her experi­ence in public service, which she characterized as "the greatest calling l have ever undertaken." 
Reno, whose hands were trembling from Parkinson's disease. spoke about her mod­est upbringing in South Florida. Her family was out­growing their small frame house, she said, and her moth­er decided to build a new home. 
"She dug the f~lllndation with her own hands," Reno said. She recalled when Hurricane Andrew barreled across Florida in 1992. 
"The world outside looked 

like a World War I battlefield, 
but the house had only lost 
one shingle," she said. Reno 
used the story as a metaphor 
for preparedness in life. 
"It's important to build a solid foundation," she said. 
Reno discussed her accom­plishments in public service, beginning with her tenure as a prosecutor in Dade County. Fla., where she helped to establish the Miami Drug Court at a time when the crim­inal justice system was bogged down by small drug cases aris­ing from the 1980s' crack epi~ demic. 
The new court helped con­victs find rehabilitation and job training in exchange for agreeing to drug testing. The program proved successful. and hundreds of jurisdictions created their own similar courts. 
"Recidivism was cut dramat­ic ally by the drug court process," Reno said. 
She also spoke about the 1993 Branch Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas. Federal agents entered the cult's com­pound to arrest cult leader

Janet Reno addresses public service 
that there is an ideal blood pressure. 
"The best blood pressure to have is one lower than you have," he said, adding that long-term elevated blood pressure leads to heart failure, strokes, coronary heart disease and renal fail­ure. 
Maintaining a low blood pressure involves avoiding abuses, according to Howard. 
"Be judicious with your use of salt," he said. "I think some people live for the taste of salt rather than the other spices in the cabinet."

STUDENT SENATE 


Referendum to be held 

By MAUREEN REYNOLDS 
News Writer 
The Student Senate will be conducting a referen­dum, beginning today, to survey 
student opinion on the topic of in-hall dances. The ref­ere n ­du m, 

which Lao will be open for voting until Friday, is the latest development in the Senate's year-long work on in-hall dances. 
Last year's Senate passed a resolution calling for in­hall dances to be reinstated for a probationary period of one year. The Campus Life Council will debate this issue in their meeting Monday and will vote on the resolution. 
Kevin Conley, Stanford Hall Senator for the 2002­03 term, worked on the ref­erendum and the resolution while snrving as Chair of the Senate's ResLife Committee. Conley said he believes the referendum is a good tool for the Senate to use in gauging student opinion. 
"We know what [the Senate] thinks about it," Conley said, "but we want to know how the students 
feel about it. We're not try­ing to serve ourselves; we're trying to serve our con­stituents." 
The referendum is com­prised of five questions: 
. 
How do you feel about a dance policy requiring dances to be held on cam­pus but outside the resi­dence halls? 

. 
How do you feel about a dance policy requiring dances to be held off cam­pus? 

. 
How do you feel about a dance policy allowing dances to be held in the res­idence halls? 

. 
If dances are held in the residence halls, how do you feel about a policy requiring you to: 


a) 
leave your room at a specific time to go down to the dance and 

b) 
stay at the dance for a specific period of time before being allowed to go back to your room? 


Conley said the most important thing for students to learn from this referen­dum is that even if dances return to the residence halls, they will not be the same as they were in the past. 
"We want students to understand that if they do come back that they're not going to be the same as before," Conley said. The purpose of the referendum. he said. is to see how stu­dents would feel about the proposed regulations. 
Jeremy Lao, Student Body Vice President, com­mented on the importance of student response to this referendum. 
"We hope to get enough students to respond [so that we have] a definitive answer on how students feel. We want to have good evidence to show what stu­dents want," Lao said. "I would encourage everyone to respond to the survey and give their true feelings on a new in-hall dance poli­cy. The more people vote, the more information we have to back our policy ... If the results strongly indicate that students want dances back, that will support our resolution at the meeting." 
He also said that the Senate will probably spon­sor a letter to the CLC in support of their resolution this week. 
"I expect a letter to be coming from one of the Senate's committees this week," Lao said. 
Students were notified of the referendum through c­mail Tuesday night and were provided a link through which to vote. Lao also said that three $50 Domer Dollar gift certifi­cates will be raffled off to students who participate in the voting,

INSIDE COLUMN 

A siinple
Inessage 
In a time when emotions and fears are at a critical high, it seems that it is human nature to become consumed by feelings of vengeance. America is at war because the evil enemy must be found and killed, no matter what the cost. 
As a result. those who oppose the war express their outrage at civilian causalities. In turn, there is indigna­tion toward these protestors who are deemed "unpatriotic." 
All of those who feel strongly about this war have become "shocked Claire Kelley and awed" with feelings of con­tempt and disgust Lab Tech for the actions of others. 
But as Sister Helen Prejean argued on Monday night, those vengeful feelings are taught and encouraged by a society that can lead to misguided action in matters of life and death. 
An example is the governmental authorization of the death penalty. As author of the book "Dead Man Walking," in which she describes her experience as a spiritual adviser for death row inmates, Prejean ques­tioned the notion that families of vic­tims of violent crimes deserve the "closure" of watching the perpetrator being executed. 
Instead she says the experience of witnessing an execution only leads to moce.psychologi.cal distress and does. _. not alleviate the pain from the death of a loved one. 
Killing people who kill will never bring real healing 
Like Prejean, I believe that acts of violence are not justified by appeals to deterrence, retribution or even patriotism and freedom. The true challenge is to maintain an open mind and an objective clarity. 
Every time we renounce reason and patience in order to solve a conflict with violence. we further the effects of the social problems we are attempting to solve. 
Martin Luther King Jr. once said, "Hate begets hate; violence begets violence," and that certainly seems to be happening now. Violent terrorist acts have resulted in a violent war and a world that hates us. 
In the aftermath of violence will we be able to restore peace and establish democracy in a country where the people have been subjected to bomb­ing, destruction and death? 
In our world and even in our own country, can we resolve the anger we feel toward each other and break the cycle of vengeance? 
We can, with a steadfast commit­
ment to life, to peace and to love. 
When she signed my copy of her book, Sister Prejean's message was simple: Choose life.

SMC freshman to walk for cancer 
Hy ANGELA SAOUD 
New, Writer 
Saint Mary's freshman Jill Funn11ll will participate in Cinicinnatti's 40-milc Avon Walk for Breast Cancer May 17-18. 
Funnell first became interest­ed in this walk when her friend pointc\d out an article about the walk in a magazine. Her great­aunt had broast cancer, but there is a largnr reason for her walking. 
"This is something that affects one out of eight women," Funnell said. uAttending an all-women's col­lege makes me want to be active with women's health issues." 
Funnell said she has been training for the two-day event by running and walking a few miles daily. 
By signing up for the Cincinnatti walk, one of eight around the country, Funnell also promised to raise $1,750. 
The money that Funnell rais­es will support breast cancer rnsearch. education and early detection programs and clinical care and support services for women with lhe disease. 
"I was intimidated when I first thought about1the fig\Ire, but it's turned out to be a lot easier than I thought it was going to be," Funnell said. "Saint Mary's ha'i been so won­derful in supporting me. I've 
been inspired by all the support 
everyone has given to me." 
Funnell began her fundrais­ing campaign by giving presen­tations to all major boards at Saint Mary's. Since then, vari­ous organizations have spon­sored her with such fundraisers as a bake sale and a penny war race. 
Hccently she was informed that a charity softball game will be held to assist her fundrais­i ng. and several R.A.'s in McCandless Hall have volun­teered to participate in a pie-in­the-face game. Funnell has aL'io been selling pink breast cancer awareness ribbons. 
..I only have a couple hundred ofdollars left to raise," she said. "I would estimate that I have close to $1,500. My family and friends have also been helping me in this cause. Between all these resources, l know it will all come together." 
Although this is Avon Walk for Breast Cancer's inaugural year, the Avon Foundation has been helping to improve the lives of women and their fami­lies for nearly 50 years. 
If it becomes an annual event, Funnell said she plans to partic­ipate again in the future. 
''I'll crawl to the end if l have to. I'll do whatever ,it takesi't, she said.

Group raising literacy levels 
By JULIA MILLER-LEMON 
Ne.,11s Wriccr 
Teamwork for Tomorrow, a non-profit group run by volun­teers from the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community, is dedicated to raising the literacy level of children who live in South Bend's public housing projects and attend the local public schools. 
Founded in July 1998 by a small group of Notre Dame stu­dents, its mission was to com­bine literacy, athletics and men­toring into an extra-curricular educational program that would brighten the futures of local chi!­drcn. 
"The program was started basically because people were frustrated with the accountabili­ty of both the Notre Dame volun­tcers and the kids coming to the program," said Mary Murphy, Teamwork for Tomorrow presi­dent. "People would decide not to come one day because they had a test the next morning, or a kid would just not show up. All of the tutors and the kids have to sign a contract promising to come every day and be fully involved." 
The 75 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's volunteers meet with the same child twice a week for two hours, and have all made a pledge to aid in the achievement of the five goals of the organiza­

Sports are given a particular amount of attention, as children spend half of each two-hour ses­sion working on athletic skills that are intended to serve as an incentive to learn. foster growth in sportsmanship and emphasize the importance of teamwork in their daily lives. 
The group also aims to improve the health and nutrition of each child by providing a healthy daily snack.

Murphy said Teamwork encourages tutors to see their kids off-site. 
A significant role of the Teamwork volunteer is his or her commitment to foster a posi­tive relationship with the child that they work with. 
Recently. the group took 70 participants to a Notre Dame women's basketball game, and last Sunday they organized the second annual "Kids These Days" talent show, hosting over 40 children, their parents and tutors, and members of the South Bend and Notre Dame communities.

The Air Force ROTC also sponsored a similar course for 24 years. That class was open to the entire student body, though the new course will be primarily targeted at Navy and Air Force ROTC cadets who are interested in flying. 
ROTC students and licensed pilots Joseph Friel, Jeff Newcamp and Bryan McCarthy will instruct the class under the direction of Lt. Cmdr. Dan Walsh. who teaches naval science courses to Notre Dame midshipmen. 
The class will cover naviga­tion, airplane systems and safety, though no actual flight time will be offered, Newcamp said.

Reno was more regretful when she began to discuss her failed bid in the 2002 Florida gubernatorial race. 
She was defeated in the Democratic primary by Tampa attorney Bill McBride in a close race characterized by massive fundraising. Reno raised about $2.6 million in the campaign, compared to McBride's $4.2 million. 
"I regret that it was not more of a grassroots campaign at the outset," she said, and went on to call for reforms ­including free airtime for can­didates -to reduce the neces­sity of high-dollar campaigns. 
"We do not have to accept the fact that money controls elections," she said. 
Reno went on to propose broad changes in government social programs and policies, criticizing what she called the 
Walsh, who was a naval aviator for 18 years after graduating from Notre Dame, emphasized that the class will not teach students how to fly. "We want to create an interest in people," Walsh said. "This is purely academ­ic and preparatory for the ground school completion course." 
The course can be applied 
toward  credits needed  to  
receive  an  FAA  pilot's

The aim of the class is "teaching the science of aeronautics, inspiring the art of flight, and producing avia­tion candidates for the mili­tary and civilian communi­ties," said promotional mate­rials. The class, number AS

"cookie cutter education sys­tem," calling for schools that focus on students' "aptitudes and interests." 
She also proposed wider use of affirmative action policies. "Why do we wait until the law school or university level? Why don't we have affirmative action for all our children?" Reno asked. 
The talk was not all serious, however. Reno joked about her appearance on Saturday Night Live. 
"I walked into NBC and there was Will Ferrell, in my blue suit," she said. She praised the actor as "one of the most versatile people I've ever met," but then added softly, "It was a ghastly imper­sonation."

Col. Chris Vernon, spokesman for the British forces, said the troops would use local police as much as possible. The British already have put a local sheik in power and asked him to set up an administrative committee for the region, Vernon said.

Medicare adtninistrators face collusion allegations 
Associated Prc,;s 
WASHINGTON 

Members of Congress are looking into allegations that the federal Medicare administrator improperly shut the Gallup Organization and other polling firms out of a chance to develop a new survey of patient satisfaction, which is used in evaluating hr5pital perfor­mance. L. 
Gallup sued Medicaid chief Thomas Scully and five unnamed co-workers at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Tuesday. The lawsuit alleged Scully tried to bully a Gallup official who was looking into alleged collusion over the patient satis­faction surveys between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the small Nebraska survey firm, National Research Corp.-Picker. 
The suit cites a March 5 e-mail mes­sage Scully sent to Bob Nielsen, man­aging partner for Gallup, calling him an "idiot," "jerk" and "weasel" for try­ing to get the new survey's financing stopped until an investigation was con­ducted. 
Earlier that day, Nielsen had sent an e-mail message to Office of Management and Budget official Brenda Aquilar, asking that funding for a pilot study be halted pending an investigation. 
Scully also threatened to stop speak­ing with Aquilar if she met with Nielsen on the matter. According to the suit, he wrote: "Brenda, if you meet with this guy it will be the last time I ever speak to you about CMS issues.

Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has written to Scully asking about the allegations that he favored NRC-Picker. Tauzin noted that ques­tions have been raised about whether proper contracting requirements were followed and whether "development of a survey instrument was tainted by the involvement of government employees with conflicts of interest." 
He asked that his committee be given the information by Friday. Earlier, Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., 
wrote to 0MB Director Mitch Daniels asking that financing for the pilot sur­vey be halted until the matter is resolved. 
Scully's agency and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality developed the survey, which is designed to help evaluate hospital per­formance by comparing patients' expe­riences. 
"This lawsuit is the result of a long and sorry road of deception and collu­sion at CMS, and was filed to protect Gallup's reputation," said James Clifton, Gallup chairman and CEO. The suit sought unspecified damages and a court order barring Scully and his col­leagues from favoring NHC-Picker. 
A call to Scully was not immediately returned.

Women's lacrosse club starts season 
By NICOLE ZOOK 
News Writer 
After spending a year as an unofficial group, the Saint Mary's/Notre Dame Women's Lacrosse Club has begun its first season as an officially recognized. student-run group. 
"Coming to college and not having this huge aspect of my life was really difficult," Saint Mary's sophomore and club president Kate Weiss said. "I decided that lacrosse was something there was enough interest in just walking around campus. I knew the demand was there, and I wanted to allow other people to play." 
In order to fill that void, Weiss spoke with Saint Mary's Sports Information Director Gregg Petcoff, who later became the team's adviser, and representatives from USLacrosse, the governing body of the sport in the United States, about the possibility of beginning a team last year. 

She spent the summer of Saint Mary's, half from each 2002 enrolling the club in school. Last week, the club USLacrosse and the Women's attracted new recruits at Saint 
College L a c r o s s e League under the Women's Division Intercollegiate Associates. 
The Saint Mary's/Notre Dame Lacrosse Club joined the WCLL's fourth division, join­ing five other teams from Indiana and 
'The girls are thrilled about the club, trying to get it on campus and trying to advertise it, because we need Saint Mary's women."

the surrounding area. 
"We had to go through and apply for club status in the fall," Weiss said. "Through a generous contribution from [Board of Governance}, we were able to cover team start­up cost. Without that. we wouldn't have been able to start as a club. They were very supportive of our idea." 
The 20 team members hail from both Notre Dame and 
Mary's Accepted Students Day. 
" T h e girls are thrilled about the club, try­ing to get it on cam­pus and trying to advertise i t ' 
because 
we need Saint Mary's women," Petcoff said. 
The team is assisted by Petcoff and volunteer coach Christy Yarnell, who played on the national Under-19 USA Lacrosse team and served as assistant coach for Notre Dame's varsity women's team for two years. 
"Everything you do," Petcoff said, "sometimes you need to fall into a little bit of luck. 
Ours was Christy." 
Weiss agreed. 
"She basically fell into our lap," she said. "She is an incredible asset to our team. We owe a lot of our success to her." 
The team holds a 3·2 record, is ranked third in its division, and sixteenth overall in the league. It recently played teams from Miami University of Ohio, Indiana University, Ball State University, Hope College and Taylor University. 
They will travel to Purdue Friday for their sixth game out of seven before qualifying for the regional tournament April 26-27. 
"I've been so impressed with the way our team has come together so far. and we've done better than I ever imag­ined we could," Weiss said. "My initial goal was to just get things going."

bet toward reducing cholesterol. Howard said. He added that tea extracts and soy isuflavor may also have affects on cholesterol levels but that studies indicate antioxidants vitamins and garlic are not particularly helpful in reducing cholesterol. 
The ideal diet, according to Howard, is the Mediterranean one, but not because of the prevalence of olive oil as original­ly thought. Rather, he said, it's due to the high quantity of nuts and fish consumed that contain polyunsaturated fats. 
The American diet and its emphasis on processed food, Howard said, is not only respon­sible for higher levels of choles· terol but also an increased inci· dence of Type II Diabetes. 
Prior to 1933 and the advent of processed foods, the American diabetes prevalence rate was less than one percent, he said. In 1998, it jumped to nearly eight percent. Today, it is estimated that 5.4 million people have undi­agnosed Type II Diabetes in the United States.

War, virus prompt layoffs at Qantas 
Australian flag carrier Qantas said Wednesday it will lay off 1,000 employees before the end of June in response to the twin troubles of war in Iraq and the deadly SARS virus. Qantas chief executive Geoff Dixon said the cuts were part of an ongoing restructur­ing program in response to changes in the aviation market. "We regret the need for this action," Dixon said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange. "However, it is vital we move quickly to protect our position in a very difficult and competitive industry." The carrier employs about 37,000.

After a 36-year run, the last Life Savers to be made in the United States are rolling out of Michigan.

Former employ­ee Joyce Van Dam says the sweet scents and memories gradually have diminished during the months since Kraft announced its deci­sion to close the plant. "It's kind of an empty feeling whenever you pass there," she told The Holland Sentinel. Kraft's decision to move Life Savers operations to a 900,000 square-foot facility in Mount Royal, Quebec, means the loss of 600 jobs and Holland's third-largest taxpayer.

Social service agency votes to take money 
Associated Press 
BOSTON 

A Homan Catholic social services agency has voted to accept $35,000 from a lay reform group that has been critical of the church over the abuse scandal, saying its responsibility to the poor out­weighs an edict from the head of the archdiocese. 
"Wo have a fiduciary obliga­lion to the poor people of the greater Boston area," Catholic Ch,1rities President Dr. Joseph Doolin said after the board of trustees' vote Tuesday. 
Last week, Bishop Richard Lennon, the interim successor to Cardinal Bernard Law, directed the agency not to take the money from the Voice of tho Faithful. 
Trustees said they met with Lennon last week to explain why the agency would likely accept the donation, which will be used to fund food pantries. 
"This was a painful deci­sion," said board chairman Neil Finnegan. "It did not feel like defying the bishop -it felt like we were put in a tough spot and made a deci­sion that the vast majority of the board felt more comfort­able with." 
In a statement, Lennon said he was "disappointed" by the vote, but would not take any artion in resoonse. addinl? 
that one of his chief aims is to "work toward ending division and fostering unity within the Archdiocese of Boston." 
A church spokesman, the Rev. Christopher Coyne, has said the reform group's fund­raising is hurting the church's own efforts to raise money. Coyne also said the archdio­cese expected Catholic Charities to refuse the money because its bylaws require it to follow church policies. 
Members of Voice of the Faithful. which claims 30,000 members in the U.S., gathered in Wellesley Tuesday night to attend a Lenten prayer ser­vice officiated by Lennon. The bishop did not mention the issue during the service. 
"At the end of the day, they decided the needs of the peo­ple took precedence over the needs of the power struc­ture." said Steve Krueger, the group's executive director. 
Last December, Catholic Charities accepted $56,000 from the reform group. The archdiocese didn't specifically tell the agency not to take that donation, which occurred during Law's chaotic last days before his resignation. 
Voice of the Faithful was established last year as the clergy sex abuse crisis erupt­ed in Boston, with its revela­tions that church leaders reassigned alleged molesters to oarish work. 
Lawmakers debate budget 
Associated Pre 
WASHINGTON 
House and Senate Republicans moved Tuesday toward striking a deal that would let the two chambers pass a compromise 2004 budget this week but settle their differences over the size of a tax cut later, aides said. 
Under the proposal ­which still needed sign-offs from many lawmakers and on which some final deci­sions remained -the bud­get would let the more con­servative House write a tax bill later this year with a deeper tax cut than the more moderate Senate has approved. The two cham­bers would then have to agree to a common figure before the tax bill could be sent to President Bush for his signature. 
The plan was, in effect, a decision to postpone resolv­ing the simmering House­Senate dispute over the size of the tax cut until many weeks from now. It was described by aides from both Republican-run cham­bers who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
It also provided hope to Bush that the 10-year, $726 billion tax cut he has pro­posed to energize the econo­my would not be cut in half, as the Senate voted to do last month. Bush's tax pack­age -which would elimi­
nate individuals' taxes on corporate dividends and accelerate some income-tax cuts -is one of the corner­stones of his domestic agen­da this year. 
Congress' budget sets rev­enue and expenditure totals for the year, and does not need the president's signa­ture. Subsequent tax and spending bills make actual changes in law. 
Passage of a budget has been crucial to GOP tax-cut­ting plans because the mea­
sure  can  protect  a  tax  
reduction  from  Senate  
delays.  or  filibusters, that  

take 60 of the chamber's 100 votes to halt. Republicans have badly wanted to give Bush's tax cuts that procedural protec­tion from the Senate's 48 Democrats, who mostly oppose even a $350 billion reduction, citing massive federal deficits. 
The House included a $726 billion tax reduction in the budget it approved last month. 
The Senate budget, how­ever, endorsed a $350 bil­lion tax package. The cham­ber included that lower fig­ure in its budget after mod­erates from both parties demanded a limit on tax reductions because of soar­ing federal deficits and the costs of war with Iraq. 
Aides cautioned that under the proposed compro­mise, each chamber's tax­cutting number would not 
necessarily be the figure it approved in its initial bud­get. 
The unusual agreement, if completed, means the House and Senate would probably be able to approve a $2.2 trillion budget for 2004 by late this week. when law­makers plan to begin a two­week recess. 
"We're going to do it before the break," Senate Budget Committee Chairman Don Nickles, R-Okla., said. 
Leaders hope to begin writing actual tax-cutting legislation after the recess. 
The proposal emerged after a day of meetings in which congressional leaders sought the votes to make the final budget's tax reduction as large as possible. 
Until Tuesday evening, GOP House and Senate bar­gainers had been stymied in efforts to craft a budget compromise, with moder­ates refusing to support a reduction bigger than $350 billion but conservatives threatening to oppose one that small. 
Senate Republicans hold a 51-48 edge over Democrats, plus a Democratic-leaning independent. Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga., supports Bush's full $ 7 26 billion plan, but four moderate senators have refused to back anything bigger than $350 billion, leaving the GOP two votes short of being able to increase the tax cut's size.

Relationships: hold 'em or fold 'em? 
Relationships have always been thought of as a game and a gamble. We play our hands as best we can and hope that we come out a winner, or at least ahead of the competition. We win some, we lose some and yet we Jacqueline continually up the 
Browder 

ante. However, in 
the end, when it's time to put all of Happily Ever our cards on the After table, there's no room for bluffing. And for seniors, with only a few weeks left until we receive our diplo­mas, it's time to show our cards. 
That said, when it comes to our relationships post-graduation, will we hold 'em or fold 'em? 
For many couples, it's time to make that very important. often permanent decision. No longer do we have the luxury and consistency of returning to Notre Dame at the end of summer. For us, life is changing and we often are pulled in different directions by jobs, graduate school or service work. Like in any decent game of poker, these changes raise the stakes. Not only are we putting our cards on the table, but we must make the choice to keep our hand or draw for another. 
After all, we start relationships for the same reason we gamble. We're all hoping to strike the jackpot -or at least get lucky. However, although we know that the house always comes out ahead in casinos, can the same be said for dating? Can we ever really win? 
Eventually we all want to rake in the chips. We want that proverbial straight flush. However, when we play cards, we never know what hand will be our best of the night and we can never be too sure what the rest of the table is holding. If we fold too early, that hand is gone forever and we don't know what cards we'll be dealt in the next round. It's a gamble, for sure. 
[n many ways, the same can be said for our relationships. For some of us, we're ready to cash in our chips. We're happy with what we've got. We oblige to the proverbial Notre Dame "ring by spring" myth and are ready to get out of the game while we're ahead. These couples aren't so much play­ing for fun as playing for keeps. In this case, the winning hand usually contains at least one diamond. second card from the left. 
For some, the game isn't quite as easy. Couples who we never thought would make it are now registering at Bed, Bath and Beyond and choosing various shades of sherbet for their bridesmaids' gowns, while some cou­ples who seemed altar bound from the start are now going their separate ways. It just goes to show us all that we never know what's in the cards. Whether couples are breaking up in hopes of getting a different, better hand or simply tired of the game, it's time to call the game. 
However, when a couple folds earli­er in the game than anticipated, we're often left wondering why. Maybe time has changed us all. Maybe we've all worked too hard these four years to sacrifice our dreams and career options. Maybe we're scared that someone will call our bluff. Or maybe we're just ready 
to give up this hand, save our luck and move on to the next 
game. When we do fold our hands at this point in 
the game. the 
stakes are certain­ly higher. But if it still feels like a 
gamble, maybe the best thing for us is a few 
new cards. After all, we never know when that per­
fect hand will come our way. Like gambling, dating is a game of chance, luck and possibility. Sometimes it's with clubs and spades. other times it's with hearts. Some take a chance with dia­monds. 
Think of it as the eternal game of five card draw. We may sacrifice our best hand and lose a few rounds, or we could win big -by sheer luck or by simply playing out the hand we've been dealt. For seniors, it's time to make that decision. We may have the winning hand, or we may take a chance at a new hand. We just have to decide whether to hold our cards -or fold 'em.

Club's alienation is hypocritical 
As a fellow Asian-American, I feel obligated to respond to Edward Song's letter Monday about his feelings of alienation as an Asian-American. 
When I came to this campus four years ago as a freshman, it was the Asian-American group who gave me feelings of alienation and not the "peo­ple in the Midwest." Upon my arrival at Notre Dame, I received numerous invi­tations from the on-campus multicultur­al groups and decided to attend some meetings. After participating in some events, I decided to stop going because the activities of the group were not of my interest. 
However. I did not realize that discon­tinuing my membership to the club would affect the way my fellow Asian-Americans viewed me. I was continually harassed by club members to attend club events because "all the other Asian's were doing it." Furthermore, club members could not understand why I wasn't "into the Asian thing." Eventually, when the club finally real­ized that I would not attend any more events, 1was shunned for doing so. 
The hypocrisy of the situation was overwhelming: A minority group which constantly whines that they are not accepted for who they are was rejecting someone for not conforming to their beliefs. This hypocrisy almost led me to leave after my freshman year. I decided to stay, however, because I found acceptance in the "people in the Midwest." 
While many might believe that this is an isolated incident, it is not. Several other members of minorities have felt the same way about their respective ethnic clubs. These people, like me, are expected to join their minority clubs because they are a member of a specific ethnic group. They are further alienat­ed when they do not do the ethnic thing. 
I only hope that this hypocrisy can eventually be overcome, because if it is not, then minorities are no better then the "people in the Midwest" who do not accept Asians for who they are.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Defending Thursday's pro-America rally 
Defining anti-Americanism and an invitation to debate 
I'm writing in response lo yesterday's letter on the pro-America rally. As some­one intimately involved in the planning and organization of this rally, I do not appreciate being branded as someone who is hiding my arrogance behind a flag. i\s vice-president of the College Republicans, I would like to defend the legitima­cy of my club and our motives. 
First. let's answer your question of what would be anti-American. It is not simply being in respectful disagreement of our administration_ It's poking fun at our head of state, it's talking lightly of this conflict as if it is a game and it's assuming people that are pro-peace cannot be pro­troop. It is choosing to sit back and mock the actions of our coun­try and stand by with the rest of the world, whose strategy was to do nothing other than ineffective inspections to hurry along lifting sanctions for their own economic benefit. 
These malicious and cynical ideals are not in the American spirit of debate. They are political potshots by Democrats and quasi-socialists aimed at betting a risky move by the administration intended in the interests of freedom. 
Why are we doing this rally? It's because it's okay to say supporting the troops is supporting America, and I don't feel arrogant when I see Iraqis being liberated from a mass-murderer. 
Did you notice we chose to have the rally at Stonehenge? llow quickly we forget the blood of Americans that have died under that flag fighting for this country for our right to speech. They did that for us. This is a rally to support the men and women who are the heroes of our generation dying under that flag again. They are over there in the hot sun getting shot at, and we come together to thank them for their bravery. I will not let petty jealousy of world opinion dull my pride in my countrymen. 
In the future, please do not twist our words. Supporting the troops is inherently pro-American, and we only want to show our gratitude for the armed forces on Thursday. We welcome people of all sides to the rally. If you want to debate policy, then we'll debate policy. It is my desire to involve our club in debates. I am looking forward to hearing from all of you. We support the flag, but by no means hide behind it, if debate is what you want bring it on, because I am well prepared to support our stance. I want to see all of you on Thursday, regardless of views, to come together in support for our brave men and women. God, Country, Notre Dame.

Rally will support troops and ideals behind flag 
As I was entering the restroom in Dillon on Sunday evening, I too was greeted by large blue signs; however, unlike Justin Brandon, I was glad that I saw them. In fact, my own roommate put up all the signs in Dillon concern­ing the so-called Pro-America Rally. Not only do I know about the rally, but I 
also wholeheartedly support it. I should -it was my idea. It is true that beyond the original concept. I had very little to do with it. The College Republicans took care of all the practical aspects of organizing this rally. However. I would like to explain why I came up with this idea and why I dis­agree with the words of Justin Brandon in yester­day's letter. 
First and foremost, what is inherently wrong with a rally supporting America? This is not a pro-war rally. This is a rally in sup­
port of our troops and the ideals represent­ed by the American nag. Even Eddie Vedder qualified his recent Bush-bashing 
by saying that he and the other members of Pearl Jam support the U.S. troops in Iraq. 
That flag represents the people of the United States of America. There is more liberty (freedom from governmental inter­vention in the lives of citizens) in America 
than in any other nation. Just as the First Amendment guarantees the rights of anti­war protesters, it allows for others to demon­
strate in favor of their government and its actions. What better time than uow is there to wave flags in support of American troops who are shedding their blood for the freedom of people in a foreign land? Let us try to preserve liberty in our own land. I loathe everything I have seen in anti-war demonstrations because 
those demonstrations take aim at the fabric of our country. However, I would never question their right to demonstrate or to burn the American flag. I encourage those demonstrators and supporters of their cause to extend the same courtesy to the vast majority of Americans who support the current policies of the government. God bless America.

Unjust athletic programs hurt African-Americans 
The pinnacle of the college basket­ball season culminated last evening with the National Championship game, bringing an exciting end to an other­wise scandal-plagued season. 
Jim 1-larrick, coach of the University of Georgia, resigned after he and his son (an assistant coach) gave academic credit to three players who did not attend their "Basketball Strategy" class. The Bulldogs were forced to for­feit the remainder of its season and wcro prohibited from participating in any post-season tournaments. 
Unfortunately, controversy is not exclusive to public schools. The Saint Bonaventure men's program was forced to forfeit its season after using an ineligible player. The coach, athlet­ic director and even the university's president have come under intense scrutiny for its "lack of leadership." These are just a few examples of the disturbing trends in big-time college athletics in recent years. 
Even more alarming than the numer­ous scandals are the graduation rates tor lack thereoO of college athletes, especially African-American athletes. According to ESPN.com, of the mem­bers of the "Sweet Sixteen," only three -Butler, Duke and Kansas -gradu­ated at least two-thirds of their black basketball players, while just those and two others -Marquette and Notre Dame -graduated at least two-thirds of all basketball players. Only six schools graduated at least 50 percent of all basketball players, while only seven graduated at least half of their black players. 
Men's basketball, which is comprised of 57 percent blacks, has the worst graduation rates of all college sports, with 58 of the 328 Division I teams failing to graduate a single black play­er in six years, including perennial powerhouses like Oklahoma, Louisville, Cincinnati. Memphis and, yes, National Champion Syracuse. 
"Win at any cost" seems to be the slogan of many college athletic pro­grams today. While their schools and coaches. who are predominantly white, rake in millions of dollars off their tal­ent, the athletes are left out to dry after their eligibility is terminated. Would it be an exaggeration to call the present state of college athletics a type of modern-day slavery? It certainly would be politically incorrect to do so. 
I will be the first to admit that the perks of a free college education are remarkable, but isn't the primary objective of a scholarship to pursue and eventually obtain a degree? Certainly a portion of the responsibility lies with the student-athletes to hold up their end of the bargain. Yet many of these programs will bend over back­wards for athletes until their eligibility runs out, at which point they cast aside the athletes like pieces of expired meat. 
The complete lack of outrage by national black leaders troubles me deeply. Where are Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton in the midst of this grave exploitation of black people? Both "reverends" are too busy getting their names in the newspapers and news weeklies for "pivotal roles" ensuring the humane treatment of POWs. 
In addition, Mr. Sharpton is busy running for president on a New Deal­type platform, insisting that the key to economic stimulus is public works pro­jects. If either of' these men truly cared about black people, the top item on their agenda would be the exploitation 
of African-American athletes. Where does this lack of outrage orig­inate? 
The answer is simple: the "rev­erends" realize that any voice of out­rage regarding this issue would not be politically advantageous. The limelight simply does not exist with this issue because college athletics have become so engrained within our culture that any opposition would be a major faux pas. So instead, the "reverends" are satisfied with the exploitation of young black men and women by convincing themselves that college sports demon­strate the athletic superiority of African-Americans. 
Until the day comes when black lead­ers stand up and fight against the injustice of this 21st century form of slavery, the NCAA will continue to look the other way while it is swallowed up by the almighty dollar, and schools will look at their athletic programs as busi­ness ventures -and nothing more.

"Twelfth Night" is a tale of twins, trickery and Time, written, of course, by William Shakespeare. This main stage production of the play by the University of Notre Dame's Department of Film, Television and Theatre opens tonight at Washington Hall. 
This comedy toys with mis­taken identity and makes fun of all its characters, whether they realize it or not. It begins with the shipwreck of two twins, a young lady and gen­tleman of noble birth. Separated in the wreck, they think each other dead. Viola, played by Cheryl Turski, cuts her hair to mas­

Their scenes provoked outright laugher. Their chemistry is so good that it carries the performance through some of its slower moments. 
It is obvious the actors worked extremely hard to master the lan­guage, but sometimes it lacks punch. Their timing is good and well-rehearsed, but occasionally their speeches seem to need a deep­er interpretation of the character or a deeper understanding of themes in the text. 
For example, at the end of Act 2 Scene 2, Viola resigns herself to fate and allows Time to work out the mess her disguise created, a significant thematic moment in the

Shakespeare originally set his play in Jllyria. This per­formance changes the tempo­ral setting to the 1890. The twins waltz about in black top hats for the majority of the play with long suit jackets top­ping off pinstriped trousers. Sir Toby looks like a reveling Irishman or a golfer out of "The Legend of Bagger Vance," with a plaid jacket and match­ing trousers that tuck into his brown side-button boots. 
While all the costumes are elaborate, impressive and beautiful, they do not add any­thing particularly intriguing to the play or provide a deeper insight to its seemingly light-heart­ecf plot.

confused identities and relation­ships that arise because no one really slows down long enough to set things right. This performance could learn from the play. 
Overall, the performance is defi­nitely worth seeing. All the actors should be congratulated, along with first-time Notre Dame director, visit­ing assistant professor Ann Marie Stewart.

White Sox spoil home opener for Indians 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND 

Jose Valentin took one look at Bartolo Colon wearing short sleeves and shook his head. The rest of his body already was 
shaking. 
"lle's nuts," Valentin said. "I was freezing. I put on every­thing I conld tind to stay warm. and believe me, I was not warm." 
Valentin heated up with a titibrcaking Hl3l single in Chicago's two-run 10th inning as tlrn White Sox won the Cleveland Indians' chilly home opener 5-3 Tuesday. 
The 10th home opener in .Jacobs Field history was rescheduled f'rom Monday because of' rain and cold weath­c r. and Tuesday's conditions were better suited for a Bears­Browns matchup than baseball. 
Fog shrouded the ballpark and the chill made it feel like it was 22 degrees when Indians starter Hicardo Hodriguez threw out the first pitch. Only about 10,000 fans braved the frigid clements until the final out. 
"It wasn't Kissimmee, Florida," Indians catcher Josh Bard said. "But the White Sox had to deal with it, too." 
Billy Koch (1-0} pitched two innings as the White Sox won their fourth straight. 
With the scored tied 3-3. Sandy Alomar Jr. singled -his third hit -to open the 10th off Chad Paronto (0-1) and was replaced by pinch-runner Miguel Olivo. 
D'Angelo Jimenez walked on four pitches and Valentin failed to get down a sacrifice bunt, before hitting his RBI single. 
"I got lucky we cashed in," Valentin said. "We can't afford to make mistakes. If I hit into a double play, not too many peo­ple in this room arc going to be happy with me." 
Thomas then lifted a fly ball, scoring Jimenez to make it 5-3. 
Cubs 6, Expos 1 
Dusty Baker felt the cold wind on his face and saw the snow on the winter-brown ivy at Wrigley Field . 
His Chicago debut as manager of the Cubs didn't seem like a home opener, not on a 32­degree day with thousands of empty seats at one of baseball's most popular parks. 
What warmed Baker up Tuesday was the way his new team responded to the elements and overcame them in a 6-1 win over the Montreal Expos. 
"It was very cold, the coldest I've ever been on a baseball field, but you've got to eliminate those thoughts," said Baker, who came to the Cubs after tak­ing the San Francisco Giants to the World Series six months ago. 
"You got to try to put those elements out of your mind, 
especially when people come and see you. Imagine how cold they are. 
"They probably have the advantage of having a flask or two. I saw a lot of people [reach] into their coats and J was like, 'They're not going for pop­corn."' 
The Cubs dealt with the condi­tions better than the Expos. 
Matt Clement, whose back tightened up in his first start last week, allowed three hits in 7 1/3 innings. Moises Alou drove in three runs, Alex Gonzalez had three hits to continue his early­season tear and the Cubs turned three double plays. 
The game, played in a biting 14 mph wind that was blowing in. was a makeup of Monday's snowout. 
"I felt like singing 'Jingle Bells.' It felt like it was Christmas," Baker said before the game. "That's the truth, it's what I did. I started signing to my son. Kids love it. They don't have to play in it like we do." 
The announced attendance was 29,138, and some in the crowd booed the Canadian national anthem when it was sung before the game. 
Yankees 7, Twins 3 
The crowd roared as Hideki Matsui rounded the bases after hitting his first major league home run. Just one game into his Yankee Stadium career, he made team history. 
Matsui became the first Yankee to hit a grand slam in his first game at baseball's most storied stadium, leading New York to a 7-3 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday. 
"I never dreamed of it," Matsui said. "Certainly I feel a little relief." 
Andy Pettittc improved to 3-0 in home openers and Robin Ventura homered as the Yankees won on a chilly 35­degrne day. The opener was snowed out Monday but the grounds crew worked all night to get the field in shape. 
Matsui made it worthwhile. with a dazzling play in the field and his home run. 
"That was a very special moment," teammate Bernie Williams said. 'Tm sure a lot of people in Japan were jumping up and down. They had to enjoy 
it." 
After Williams was intention­ally walked to load the bases with one out in the fifth, Matsui worked the count full against Joe Mays (1-1) as fans chanted "Mat-su-i! Mat-su-i!" 
Matsui then hit a drive into the right-field bleachers, draw­ing a thunderous ovation from the crowd of 33,109, which included his parents and broth­er. 
After Jason Giambi took weeks to win over the Yankee Stadium crowd last season. Matsui did it in one game. 
"Right now. I can't really sense that," Matsui said through an interpreter. KMaybc later in the season I can look back and say that was the moment. when I hit the home run, that I was a Yankee." 
Phlllles 4, Braves 3 
Tomas Perez's two-out RBI single in the 10th inning gave the Philadelphia Phillies a 4-3 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Tuesday night. 
Pat Burrell opened the 10th with a single ofT reliever Kevin Gryboski (0-1) and moved to second on a sacrifice by pitcher Brett Myers. who was pinch-hit­ting. 
After Mike Lieberthal was intentionally walked, Marlon Byrd hit into a fielder's choice, sending Burrell to third. Perez then singled up the middle past diving shortstop Rafael Furcal. 
Jose Mesa (1-0) pitched 1 1-3 hitless innings for the win. 
Atlanta's Gary Sheffield and manager Bobby Cox were eject­ed by plate umpire Kerwin Danley after Sheffield was called out on strikes in the fifth inning. 
Phillies manager Larry Bowa was also absent, serving a one­game suspension for inciting the benches to clear during a spring training game against Toronto. 
The gametime temperature of 37 degrees helped lead to 16 walks, including four to Lieberthal, two wild pitches and a passed ball.

NCAA WOMENS BASKETBALL 
Taurasi, Huskies capture 2nd stra,ight title 

Associated Press 
ATIANTA 
Diana Taurasi tormented Tennessee again, and Connecticut proved it could rebuild -and still repeat. 
Leading a young team that had four new starters, Taurasi ignored the sore back and bum ankle that have bothered her for several weeks and carried Connecticut to a 73-68 victory over Tennessee on Tuesday night for its second straight national championship. 
Taurasi, who averaged 22 points in her first five games against Tennessee, scored 28 in this one with a variety of the flashy moves that made her the national player of the year. 
The Huskies (37-1) won this third title game between the nation's two premier programs, and it was mostly because of Taurasi, who became the leader on a team that lost four starters. 
She made 8-of-15 shots. including four 3-pointers. She scored on a floater in the lane, a backdoor cut and even threw in a shot left-handed. 
Still, Tennessee (33-5) closed with a rush after trailing by 13. When Brittany Jackson pump faked and then made a 3-point­er as she fell forward, the lead was down to 70-66 with 1 :01 left. 
Gwen Jackson's layup drew Tennessee to 71-68 with 21 sec­onds remaining. But Ann Strother, one of two freshmen who start for Connecticut, sank two free throws, and freshman Ashley Battle intercepted Tennessee's inbounds pass. 
The Huskies moved the ball so quickly that Tennessee could not foul, and fittingly, Taurasi ended up with the ball. She nung it into the stands at the buzzer and Connecticut began yet another victory celebration. 
If any more evidence was needed that Connecticut has supplanted Tennessee as the nation's top program in women's hoops, this was it. 
The title was the fourth over­all for the Huskies, who also beat Tennessee in the 1995 and 2000 championship games and now have beaten the Lady Vols four straight times. 
Connecticut denied Tennessee and coach Pat Summitt a sev­enth title and delivered further insult to a program UConn head coach Geno Auriemma had dubbed the "Evil Empire." 
Taurasi and Co. made sure it did not strike back. 
Strother finished with 17 points, and the other freshman starter, Barbara Turner, came up with 10 points on five tough baskets inside. 
Maria Conlon, the spunky 5­foot-9 guard who looks so out of place among the other sleek athletes on the floor, con­tributed 11 points, six assists and four rebounds for the Huskies.

Hopes abound for a rebound after two straight losses 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Spores Writer 
Returning to their home courts after two tough road losses, the Irish are hoping to start up a winning trend as the season nears a close. When No. 61 Ball State travels to Notre Dame today, the Cardinals will be anxious for an upset, and the Irish will be ready for a win. 
After Notre Dame suffered a rough 6-1 loss to Miami March 30, the Irish were keenly set on rebounding against Southern Methodist in Dallas last Sunday. Unfortunately for Notre Dame, the Mustangs survived a very close match to edge the Irish 4­3. 
"I can't lie." junior trica_ptain Matt Scott said. "It was a heart breaker." 
The Irish had some promising moments in Sunday's match, including junior tricaptain Luis Haddock's upset of No. 55 Johan Brunstrom and Brent D'Amico's straight-set victory over No. 52 Gwinyai Chingoka.

FOOTBALL 
Irish and Willingham hire personnel coach 
Special to the Observer 
Notre Dame football coach Tyrone Willingham announced Tuesday the hiring of Jimmy Gonzales as the Director of Personnel Development for the Irish football program. Gonzales, who will work with recruiting and player develop­ment among other things, will begin his duties immediately in South B"end. 
Gonzales comes to Notre Dame after serving as the director of football operations and recruiting coordinator at Atmy since 1999. In that role, Gonzales handled the adminis­trative operations of the foot­ball program, aided in recruit­ing weekends and team travel and assisted in community service projects and communi­ty events. 
A lifelong football adminis­trator and coach during his career, Gonzales was the assistant athletic director for football operations under head coach John Mackovic at the University of Texas from 1996-98 before leaving for Army. 
While at Texas, the Longhorns finished first in the Big 12 South. defeated Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship game and advanced to the Fiesta Bowl during the 1996 season. Gonzales also served as the administrative assistant for recruiting at Oklahoma (1992­
93) during his career. 
Prior to assuming adminis­trative duties at Texas, Gonzales served as a coach for close to 15 years. He was the defensive backfield and ends coach at Duke from 1994-95, and coached defensive backs at Northwestern (1990-92). He served in a similar capacity ai with his own play in his loss to Lukasz Senzyszyn, praised some of his teammates for their strong performances that kept the Irish in contention through­out the match. 
"The guys, they fought their heart[s] out," Scott said. 
The close match with the Mustangs was the latest in a trend of tight competitions for the Irish this season. 
"I think we probably have more 4-3's than most teams in the country," Scott said. "Coach says we've been in the fire, and we can draw on those experi­ences. Every time you're in those 4-3 matches you just get tougher. We just hope we can use it to our advantage in the end of the year." 
Having passed through the fire posed by many of the nation's top teams, the Irish are looking for a win against Ball State to boost their confidence as they embark upon the last part of the season and prepare for the Big East Championship. Next Sunday, Notre Dame will travel to No. 13 Kentucky. 
"[The SMU loss] really hurt," Scott said. "I think that feeling

He also was the defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator at Tulsa from 1985-86, the defensive coordinator at Texas Lutheran in 1985 and was a graduate assistant at both TCU (1983-84) and Southwest Texas State (1982). At Southwest Texas, that team posted a perfect 14-0 record and captured the NCAA Division II national champi­onship.

has been in our stomach for the last three days. We're really looking to kind of bounce back from that. Ball State is going to be our rebound win." 
Like the Irish, Ball State has had a formidable schedule. All six of the Cardinals' losses came to ranked teams -No.I Illinois, No. 28 Indiana, No. 47 Northwestern, No. 51 Louisville, No. 67 Indiana Slate and No. 68 Michigan.

Ball State returns 10 letter­men from the 2002 squad that lost to Notre Dame 4-3 in the last regular season match for the Irish. 
'Tm sure it would make a career moment for a lot of them to beat Notre Dame," Scott said. "They'll fight hard. They're a scrappy team. They have some good players in the lineup."

Irish, but in order to signifi­cantly progress in the rankings, a win against Kentucky on Sunday is critical for Notre Dame in terms of qualifying for the NCAA Tournament. 
"We're going to close out the season hopefully with three wins," Scott said.

Weather forces Irish to reschedule games 
By BRYAN KRONK 
Senior Spom Writer 
The quest for Notre Dame's 12th consecutive win will have to wait a day. 
Miserable weather conditions in South Bend postponed Tuesday's match between the Irish (20-6) and Bowling Green (8-11) at Eck Stadium, marking the third weather-related dis­ruption in Notre Dame's last five games. 
Hope your schedule was filled out in pencil. 
Tuesday's game will now be played Thursday as the second half of a doubleheader at the Eck, following Notre Dame's originally-scheduled Thursday match against Chicago State (2­19), which has been pushed up from 5:05 p.m. to 4:05 p.m., allowing the second match to begin at approximately 6:30 p.m. 
Both matches on Thursday will be 7-inning affairs. 
In addition to the postpone­ment of Tuesday's game, the Irish added two home games as a result of the cancellation of Friday's doubleheader against Boston College. 
The first make-up will involve the Irish taking on Central Michigan (currently 8-14) on Monday, while the Irish added IPFW (11-13-1) as an opponent April 24. 
Both make-up matches will be played at Eck Stadium at 
5:05 p.m. 
The starting rotation has shifted slightly as well. as sophomore John Axford will start today against Western Michigan. and Martin Vergara and Tom Thornton will throw Thursday against Chicago State and Bowling Green, respective­ly. 
Notes: 
Due to an east coast snow­storm Monday night. Notre Dame was hardly alone in post­poning their match Tuesday. At least six Big East teams had their Tuesday matches either cancelled or postponed, as Connecticut, Villanova, Virginia Tech, Rutgers and Seton llall all called off their matches due to weather as well.

Edwards named Big East Player-of-Week 
Special to the Observer 
Notre Dame infielder Matt Edwards received Big East Player of the Week honors after leading the Irish baseball team to a 4-0 record in last week's action. Edwards -who has started at first and third base in recent weeks -led Notre Dame in hits and batting average (9­for-14, .643), RBIs (10) home runs (3), total bases (21) and slugging percentage (1.500). The sophomore also had seven runs scored, two walks, a triple, double, stolen base and just one strikeout from his key No. 3 spot in the batting order. He hit 6-for-9 in the doubleheader sweep at St. John's, with five RBI and a pair of booming home runs to dead-center field. 
Edwards -who missed most of the 2002 season with a bro­ken leg -heads into this week's action with a .385 sea­son batting average and an eight-game hitting streak, plus 32 RBI in 25 games played. He

According to Florida Department of Corrections records, Strawberry is moving back in with his wife. Charisse, and his three children at a gated community in Lutz. 
"He's doing well," lawyer Darryl Rouson said before Strawberry's release. "He's been clean for a very long time, longer than ever before." 
"I just wish Darryl the best," Yankees manager Joe Torre said. "I don't know what the next step is for him. I'm certainly happy he's out early and can get his life on the right path." 
Canadian anthem booed at 
Wrigley 
Some fans at Wrigley Field booed Tuesday when the Canadian national anthem was played before the Chicago Cubs' home opener against the Montreal Expos. 
The smattering of boos was notice­able among the crowd of 29,138, a backlash from last month when "The Star-Spangled Banner" was booed before an Islanders-Canadiens hock­ey game in Montreal -a response to the war in Iraq. 
"Two stupid reactions don't make it right, I think," Expos manager Frank Robinson said. 
"Whatever happened in Canada was uncalled for. but that doesn't mean that people in the States have to turn to idiotic acts by booing the Canadian national anthem," he said. "I think both anthems should be respected by whomever." 
Expos first baseman Jeff Liefer, who played last season with the Chicago White Sox, said he w.ould rather fans not boo during the anthems. 
"This is a free country, they can do whatever they want," he said. "I wouldn't do it out of respect for Canada. I know they did it to our anthem. That's what's great about this country. It's free and you can do whatever you want. That's what they did."

"When we come out of spring ball, he has to position himself at number two or backup role," Diedrick said. "And when you say play in a backup role, you're just one play away. You may be one play away, but you have to be prepared to play as starter.''

FOOTBALL 
Back to work 

Quarterback Chris Olsen is looking to climb up the Irish depth chart 

ByJOE HETTLER Sports Editor 
College football is vastly dif­ferent from high school foot­ball. Quarterback Chris Olsen knows this fact first-hand. 
Last season, the highly­recruited Olsen didn't get a chance to run Notre Dame coach Tyrone Willingham's West Coast offense with his new teammates until summer camps. By then, he had a lot of catching up to do and a lot to learn about college football. 
"I think that like most kids when they come in as a true freshmen, they feel they can walk on and play right away," Irish offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick said. "Even given a playbook in the early spring and having three or four months to study it [is not enough]. Then after the [com­petitions] begin they realize they have a lot to learn, not only from the mental part of it and learning the intricacies of the offense, but how to handle themselves with the protec­tion, with the checks and with everything else." 
During his senior year at Wayne Hills High School in Wayne, N.J., Olsen threw for 

1,864 yards and 24 touch­downs and was a first-team all-state pick by the Newark­Star Ledger. He was 31-4 as a starter and played in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl his senior year, 
But despite the prep success, Olsen still needed to learn the Irish playbook better when he arrived on campus last fall. Once he became accustomed to the plays, he still needed to play in games. at game speed, to become truly familiar with the college quarterback posi­tion. Since Olsen didn't get to play last year, he still has much to learn. 
"I think he's made a tremen­dous amount of improvement since the end of the season last year until this week," Diedrick said...... But every­thing happens at such a fast pace and high speed that [young quarterbacks) almost get mesmerized by the college game ... But that's what going to school as a quarterback is all about." 
Olsen has taken the football knowledge he learned watch­ing from the sidelines his freshman year into his first spring practices this year. He

Hickory High keeps Hoosier dream alive 
. Nostalgic team of barnyard ballers wins a thriller in throwback jerseys 
By KATIE McVOY Senior Staff Writer 
The bookstore courts were business as usual Tuesday. Most teams stayed focused on playing basketball, but one team was focused on the rebirth of a legend. 
Well after seven, well after all the other teams had left for the evening, two teams still struggled. One was struggling to fulfill a dream. In the state of Hoosiers, Hickory High was looking to bring just one more 
championship home, or at least to win its first round bookstore game. But Pumpkin in a Patch was trying to deprive these Hoosiers of their dream. 
With the score at 23-22 and Hickory High needing to win by two, that big play hap­pened. 
"When it got to 23-22, we decided to run the picket fence," Rob Stalter said. "And that was what sealed the win." 
Hickory High was victorious 24-22. Complete in l 980's-era gold shorts and maroon Hickory jerseys -sent from home by senior Brian Meyer's mother -Hickory High played a Pumpkin in a Patch team
