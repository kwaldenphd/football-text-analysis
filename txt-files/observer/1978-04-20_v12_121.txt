Seven students arrested for party 


by Jim Coyne Staff Reporter 
Seven Notre Dame students ar­rested at an off-campus party last Friday evening will pay the penalty enforced by the State of Indiana and no further punitive action will be taken by the University, accord­ing to ND Dean of Students James Roemer. 
The arrests took place at a party 
held at 823 N. Notre Dame Avenue. Those arrested were: Stephen Bitter and Bruce Martin, both of 
823 N. Notre Dame, on charges of selling without a permit; and housemates James Stephens, Gre­gory Swita, Thomas Byrne, John O'Connell, and Patrick Kehough on charges of conducting unautho­rized dealings. 
Stephens said that around 10 
p.m. two undercover policemen came to the party where Martin and Bitter were collecting money. These two policemen paid admis­sion to the party. A short time later, uniformed policemen arrived on the scene and asked Martin and

Bitter what they were collecting for. 
When told it was for the party that was taking place in the back yard, the policemen asked those . dispensing the beer if anyone had a bartending license or if they had any carding facilities. Each of the seven were than charged with a $50 bond, taken to the police station, and booked. 
Stephens said that Martin and Bitter were actually charged with "selling cups", while the others were charged with "dealing with a prohibitive substance." He added that it could have been worse if they had been "charged with contributing to the deliquency of a minor." 
The seven students are now waiting for their hearing, which will be held on Wednesday. According to Stephens, the group has talked with lawyer Richard Hunter about the possibility of his representing them at the trial. 
Roemer said he knows that there have been similar problems in the neighborhood. He said that from now on he will advise Notre Dame Security to bring all public adver­tisements concerning parties to him. He will in turn notify the Northeast Neighborhood Council, so that they will be aware of the partv, he added. 

"I'm not in any sympathetic position with the seven students," he stated. They allegedly broke the law and if convicted, will have to pay the price, according to Roemer. 
He also said that the University will not intercede on behalf of the students. 
'Vandals will make restitutions': Roemer 
by Rosemary Mills Editorial Editor 
On March 31, two male students damaged several cars in the D-2 west parking lot, according to James Roemer, ND dean of stu­dents. Roemer announced yester­day that the pair will make restitu­tion for the damages. Students who wish to be reimbursed should contact his office. 
The incident took place at ap­proximately 3 a.m. Roemer related that two students left the Library bar and drove to the D-2 parking lot. The pair then ran through the lost to campus, breaking car anten­nas and damaging windshield wipers en route. 
Unknown to them, however, a third student saw what Roemer called in legal terms "vandalism and malicious trespassing." After following the two, he caught up to them in from of the ND post office. 
Roemer said the student con­fronted them "in rather strong terms," and fistfight broke out. The fight attracted the attention of security stationed at the main gate. Security stopped the fight and learned of the damage. 
A quick investigation revealed some damage and the case was sent to Roemer. "Both students admitted their actions,'' Roemer stated. "They also admitted to being under the influence and said they would not have done it otherwise.'' 
"Number one is that they will have to make restitution," Roemer emphasized. 
He asked that students whose cars were damaged call his office at 6144 within the next five days. They should state where the car was parked and give an estimate of the damage. "If possible," Roemer added, "they should send a letter." 
The two students will also have some sanction imposed on them, according to Roemer. But he has not yet decided exactly what this will be. 
Roemer clarified the absence of University responsibility for stu­dent cars, saying "there is no way we can guarantee" protection. The lights around some parking lots, the fences and the patrol by security are all means taken by the university to diminish crime, he said. 
"I'm convinced most of the damage is done by other stu­dents," Roemer stated, "and I just

The election of student represen­tatives to the Campus Life Council was finalized last Tuesday night in LaFortune. 
Representing the North Quad on the council next year will be Chip Walter, vice president of Flanner, and Curtis 'Y'Iesslen, vice-president of Grace, who won the run-off election last Tuesday. Mary Ryan and Ed Zier, vice-presidents of Badin and Morrissey, will repre­sent the South Quad. The four were elected by the outgoing representatives. 
In addition to four hall vice­presidents. the Campus Life Coun­cil is composed of three hall rectors from each quad, two members of the Faculty Senate, the student body president, and one represen­tative each from the Student Union and HPC. As of yet, the people who will fill the remaining positions have not been determined. 
The Council, which was created by the Board of Trustees last October, meets weekly and is supposed to "act as a forum where faculty, administrative, and stu­dent representatives can discuss campus life and make recommen­dations to the vice-president for Student Affairs," Andy McKenna, student body president com­mented. 
"At every third meeting," McKenna added, "three exofficio members, another faculty mem­ber, the vice-president for Student Affairs, and the dean of students­sit in to consider immediate pro­blems and suggestions the Council might have." 

During the two weeks in be­tween formal meetings, the two groups meet separately. "This procedure,'' McKenna said, "gives the regular members a little more freedom to discuss issues more openly without being sty­mied." 
The first Council meeting is scheduled for next Wednesday, by which time the other members will have been chosen. An issue which McKenna feels will predominated the upcoming agenda is the Univer­sity's fire regulation policy, specifi­cally the policy on lofts. 
"We want to understand the University's position more clear­ly," McKenna commented, "and try to develop a more practical loft policy without sacrificing fire safety on campus."

Editors fight eviction order 
BOSTON, MA--Editors of the weekly student newpaper at Boston 
College, a Roman Catholic school, say they will fight an order that 
the paper move off campus because it published advertisements for 
abortion clinics. Paul McPartland, editor of The Heights, said 
moving from campus would hurt the paper's ability to do its job. 
The Heights was told to move by Kevin P.Duffy, the college's vice­
president for student affairs, who said the school must "assure that 
any independent corporation which desires the convenience of 
leasing space in college quarters respect the basic values of the

'One Earth Week' ends with International Festival 
by Valerle Stefani 
The ninth annual "One Earth Week," sponsored by the Interna­tional Student Organization {ISO) of Notre Dame concluded last Saturday evening with the "Inter­national Festival," an entertain­ment program that featured music and folk dancing from the repre­sentative countries. 
Countries represented included India,, France, Austria, the Philip­pines, China, the United States, and Latin America. Middle East­ern countries were also included for the first time this year. 
"It was the first time that the Arab countries and the Islamic Association of Michiana participat­ed in the festival," explained Betty Fitterling, secretary to Daniel O'Neil, director of International Student Affairs. 
The week long celebration also featured lectures, films, and the "One Earth Marketplace," a dis­play and sale of imported hand­crafts from around the world. Coordinators of the program stated 
that  attendance  at  the  events  
increased  this  year,  particularly

"There was a good turnout at the programs during the week and there was a capacity crowd at Washington Hall for the Festival Saturday evening,'' Fitterling said. 
"One Earth Week" was original­ly designed as a way to thank the host families from the international students. It has since come to include active participation by both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. 
The Chairman of the Week was Monica Echavarria, president of the ISO. Other chairmen include Gabriel Shakkour, for the Festival; Patricia Leon, publicity; Henri Van Tichelen, films and lectures; and Carlos Araujo, for the Marketplace. 
Rourke O'Brien also helped in planning and directing the Market­place. 
Eiections for next year's officers will be held on Thursday. The first 
event planned next year is the orientation program for new inter­national students in the fall.

The production, directed by Reg­

Cooperative Department of Speech

to celebrate the SOOth anniversary  
of the birth of Sir Thomas More.  
More became Chancellor of Eng­ 
land at a time of great turmoil.  
King Henry VIII wished to have his  
marriage to Catherine annulled so  
he could marry Anne Boleyn.  
When the Pope denied such action,  
Henry chose to form the Church of  
England, thus separating from the  
Catholic Church. Without going  
against the Law, More refused to  
take part in this matter. He was  
imprisoned and eventually behead­ 
ed over a perjured testimony of  
treason given by Richard Rich, the  
Attorney General for Wales who

Aldous also predicted that the students present would have more children than their parents or grandparents, and that 40 to SO percent of them will eventually divorce. 
"The kinds of decisions you make in the next few years are going to have very long-range affects," Aldous warned. 
Aldous, whose book, Famlly Careers, was published last month, has been teaching at Notre Dame for two years. She has the :listinction of being the only female full-professor at Notre Dame.

France allegedly explodes experimental neutron bomb 
PARIS [AP) -A Paris newspaper 
reported yesterday that France has 
exploded an experimental neutron 
bomb at its South Pacific test base, 
but French rese'archers are belie­
ved far behind the United States in 
developing any deployable neutron 
warhead. 
The Foreign and Defense Minist­
ries refused to comment on the 
front-page story in France-Soir , a 
mass-circulation daily, according to 
a longstanding French information 
on nuclear tests at the Mururoa 
Atoll range in the South Pacific. 
Well-informed observers believe 
theFrance-Soir story, which follow­
ed similar reports in the weekly 
magazine I.e Point and two ~est 
German newspapers, stemmed 
from an underground nuclear test 
last month. 
The test, widely reported but 
never officially confirmed, was part of a series of French efforts to improve its nuclear arsenal. Def­ense Minister Yvon Bourges, asked ·last fall about neutron bomb re­search, said testing covered all kinds of weaponry but declined

1978~·79 Senior Bar managers 
by Rosemary Mills Editorial Editor 
The 1978-79 Senior Bar general manager will be Mike Schlageter, announced James Roemer, ND dean of students. The two other
J ··-,... if'! nill managerial positions will be filled by Ron Zoroomski and Pat Jordan. The three were chosen from over SO applicants, all of whom were interviewed and rated by either Jimmy Dunne, Rob Civitelo, ,or Kenn Ricci, the present managers. Roemer and Ken Milani, associate professor of accountancy and advi­sor, then interviewed the top nine applicants and made the final decision. Dunne said he was happy with the choices and called Schlageter "a smart and really nice guy." "I would like to congratulate the new managers,'' Dunne stated. He added that he would also like to congratulate Roemer and Milani on their decision. "I think the new managers will find Roemer straight forward and easy to work with," Dunne noted. Roemer added his own compli­
specifics. 
The respected newspaper I.e Monde quoted "informed circles" yesterday as saying neutron weap­ons seemed within the grasp of a medium power like France but that research was not far enough along for experiments. 
France-Soir said a " senior milit­
ary officer'' also pointed out that 
France was still three or four years 
away from any deployable neutron 
weapons, but that he reportedly 
described the recent Mururoa test 
as a "full-scale laboratory exper­·iment." 
In Parliament later yesterday, Socialist leader Francois Mitterand demanded that the government reveal whether it had conducted a neutron bomb test. But Premier Raymond Barre sidestepped the issue. 
In Washington. U.S. Defense Department officials said privately they had no information on any neutron bomb testing by the French, and State Department officials said they were skeptical of the reports. 
capable of both the leadership and technical aspects of the job. All the applicants and everyone we inter­viewed were outstanding people," Roemer emphasized. "It was a very tough decision." 
Schlageter said he is ''anxious to do a good job." He added his general plans were to continue to "fix up the place, making improve­ments wherever needed, and run the bar as efficiently as possible." 
University-Bar relationship 
Senior Bar is owned by the University. According to Roemer, the University purchased the li­cense and subsidized it when it was losing money. but the day-to-day operation is the responsibility of the Senior Class, specifically those who are chosen and paid to oversee it." 
Roemer stated that many ad­ministrators and faculty are asso­ciated with Senior Bar. Philip Facenda, general counsel for the University is involved with renew­ing the license every year. He also deals with any legal problems the bar is faced with. 
Senior Bar is licensed by the 
Indiana Alcoholic Beverage Com­
mission (ABC) as a private club. 
According to ABC law, this type of 
license requires a defined member­
ship with dues of at least $6 a year.

Milani and Roemer are advisers and set direct overall policy and employment. This year, unusually high profits caused some discus­sion about investments. 
"From a legal 'point of view," Roemer stated, "there is no ques­tion who the money belongs to.'' He explained that he would like to see the profits used for improve­ments in the bar. Roemer cited the restrooms, the stairs, and the floors as areas which could be improved. 
"I think the more you upgrade a place, it will be reflected in the clientele and the way they act,'' he said. If possible, Roemer added that something could be set aside for next year's initial operating expenses. 
"The money put into Senior Har comes from the Senior Class," Roemer stated. He explained his ideas for using the profits to benefit future senior classes. This could be done by organizing a scholarship fund for needy seniors or possibly an emergency fund. 
Roemer agreed that the use of profits was definitely an admini­strative decision. He added that he would be open to suggestions from the seniors "as long as they are beneficial to the whole class." 
U.S. prepared to defend canal if Panama had tried sabotage 
WASHINGTON [AP] -The United 
States was prepared to defend the 
Panama Canal if the Panamanian 
military had tried to take the 
waterway by force, President Cart­
er's chief spokesman said yester­
day. 
"It is safe for you to assume we 
would be prepared to defend 
American interests and the canal, 
as we have been," White House Press Secretary Jody1Powell said. 
The White House statement was prompted after Panamanian leader Gen. Omar Torrijos declared that his regime was ready to sabotage the canal had the Senate defeated the second of the two Panama Canal treaties on Tuesday night. The treaties relinquish U.S. control of the international waterway by the end of the century. 
Torrijos said after the Senate's vote that if the treaty had been rejected, "we would have started another struggle for liberation." Torrijos said the close vote placed the Panama Canal "within two votes of being destroyed. 
Torrijos' statement. issued only minutes after the Senate approved the accord with one vote to spare, bll-32. still caused repercussions here yesterday.

"I'm not surprised," Laxalt said of the Torrijos statement. "But it was a hell of a way to start a shotgun marriage." 
Carter called Sen. Howard Can­non, D-NV, one of the last to declare himself in favor of the treaty switch. A Cannon aide said the senator told Carter "he was dumbfounded that Torrijos would make such a statement. He told the president he was very dis­tressed." 
But the White House and State Department shrugged off Torrijos' statement Tuesday night, as did 
Democratic congressionai leaders. 
At a White House briefing, Powell refused to acknowledge a report that U.S. forces had been placed on alert. But he said that if such an order had been given, Carter, as commander-in-chief, would have ordered it. 
The Pentagon said flatly that no alert had been implemented. However, Defense Department of­ficials said officers with the South­ern Command Headquarters in the Canal Zone reported late Tuesday that military patrolling in the zone had been stepped up. But authori­ties stressed that no leaves were cancelled and no U.S. troops were 
placed on alert.

A Reply 
from 
Senior Bar 
Editor's Note: The foUowlng Is Mr. Dunne's reply to the open letter from John Larrabee which was printed In Tuesday's Observer. 
Dear Mr. Larrabee: 
I would first like to thank you for 
your interest and concern with the 
operation of the Senior-Alumni 
Club. It is my feeling that many of 
our fellow classmates have similar 
questions and would appreciate if 
somc~me could answer them. 
Therefore the purpose of this letter 
is not merely to comment on your 
observations, but rather to better 
acquaint the members of the 
Senior-Alumni Club with the over­
all operation of the bar. 
First; I would like to discuss the bar's financial position. I was misquoted in the Observer as saying that it was necessary to build up the bar's profits to $25,000. At the time of the iinterview the bar's profits were! all't'ady in excess of that figure. At this point I would like to empha· size· it never was, nor will it ever by my intention "to build" the bar's profits to any level. I am somewhat disappointed that such great attention is centered around the Senior Bar's profit and so little consideration is paid to the staff . whose efforts have resulted in so many permanent improvements. The tremendous profits that did accumulate were due to the efforts of an extremely honest and hard­working staff. 
However, I would like to say that I am in no way angry with the Observer for misquoting me. To expect absolute perlection from any organization is unfair, especial­ly from a completely student-run operation such as the Observer or the Senior Bar. 
In your letter you also state that I am defensive about "implications that you(l) am personally benefit· ting from the bar's success.'' I feel that if I am defensive about this fact 1am with good reason. Until I did state emphatically that "we receive no profits whatsoever" many of the members of our class felt that Jimmy Dunne was becom· ing a very wealthy man. After this article a great number of people approached me and expressed delight in finding out the truth concerning the ba.-'s profits. In all honesty the Senior Bar is in a unique position since it has never realized such financial success. As a result it is still uncertain where the profits will go. I can assure you that once the· administration de­cides how it will allocate the funds it will be made ·public. If in the past I have acted irritable about discus­sion concerning the use of the profits, it is because, quite frankly, I am tired of hearing about them. 
As far as your objection to the fact that I did not mention the employee dinner at the Boar's Head, I would like to remind vou that all of your knowledge or'the operation of the Senior Bar seems to be the result of one very short article in the Observer. How is it possible for me to explain every aspect of the bar's operation in one short article? You are absolutely correct, I did not mention the dinner in the article, nor did I 
mention the fact that the enttre staff of 29 reported back to school eight days before registration for the sole purpose of renovating the bar and did so without pay. Along with working eight hours a day for eight days without pay, they also had to make arrangements for imd pay for room and board. However, 
I would like to mention that Dr. Kenneth Milani, the faculty advisor to the bar, suggested having the dinner and Dean James Roemer approved and signed the check for it. On this point Mr.Larrabee, I don't feel your criticism is in any way constructive but rather very cheap and petty. 
If you are interested in reviewing our books please be my guest. Keno Ricci is the business manager of the bar and I am sure he will enjoy meeting you and answering any of your questions. I would like to say publicly that we are audited twice a semester by the University auditor, Mr. Lou Cohen. As a matter of fact Mr. Cohen has recently completed his first audit of the second semester and he and I met in his office on April 14. Mr. Cohen commented to me that "The bar's records are very clear and in perlect order.'' Mr. Cohen went on to say that we had a very clean and successful operation, and I as general manager, should be proud. Since it is my understanding that you are a science major, Mr. Larrabee, I am sure Mr. Cohen would be very interested in your 
appraisal of the  books  he  has  
audited.

Class Elections: In Retrospect 
Dear Editor, 
In the recent Class ... of '81 
elections, l of all of the tickets running in the class, only one had a woman running for the post of President. And, much to my surprise, this was one of the two tickets which made it to the run-off election. There is something to be said for a class at Notre Dame which almost elects a ticket with a woman in the top slot. To use a popular phrase on campus, the rest was to be "gravy". 
I wish then to commend the class of '8t, especiallyall ofits members who saw past the p!)Sters to t]!~ platforms, and in particular, I wish to commend · everyone con~te~ted . with the Abowd·Ward·Solari-DoilY ovan ticket, for getting where they' did. .

WASHINGTON-·! like Rippleman 
because he has an opinion on 
everything. The other day I asked 
him how he felt about the neutron 
bomb and he said, "I like the 
neutron bomb. It's safe and it's 
sane, and God knows this world 
needs another war weapon to 
protect itself.'' 

"But," I said, "it seems so 
expensive." 

"For a tactical weapon it's a steal. Maybe it might sound expensive today, but let's say by the year 2000, when we give the Panama Canal back to Panama, somebody says the United States can't go through the canal before El Salvador. What do we do?" 
"I don't know," I admitted. 
"We use the neutron bomb. We kill all the people in the area but we don't hurt the canal. Then every­one will say the bomb was a bargain." 

"That's a good point. If we used conventional nuclear weapons to blast the El Salvador boat out of the way, no one would be able to use' the canal," I said. "The only thing that worries me is that if we build a neutron bomb, Iran and Saudi Arabia and Israel will demand we sell it to them first.

"Then we'll sell it to them. After 

all, if Iran. Saudi Arabia and Israel 
offer to buy the neutron bomb from 
us we can make it a lot cheaper." 
"I was hoping that the neutron 

bomb would be just for us. It would 
be nice if the United States had one 
weapon it could call its own." 
"We can't build weapons just for 

ourselves," Rippleman said. 
"They're too expensive. But if we 

can get every country to say they'll 
take a gross of neutron bombs we 
can bring it in at a price our 
Defense Department can live 
with." 
"What I don't understand is, if 

we let a country huy our latest war 
weapons. how will we have the 
advantage over them in case they 
do something stupid like let an El 
Salvador hoat go through the 
Panama Canal before we do?" 
Rippleman said, "It's quite sim­

ple. The fact that they buy the 
weapon from us doesn't necessarily 
mean they know how to use it. A 
neutron bomb is a very complicated 
piece of hardware. Only by 
lighting the fuse will it go off." 
"And you don't think someone 

can learn how to fire one?" 
"Not unless he's had an Ameri­

can high school education. You 
take two soldiers facing each other 
with their neutron bombs, one with 
an American high school diploma 
and one with a diploma from 
Albania. Who do you think will 
win?" 
"The American, of course," 

said. 
"Right," said Rippleman. "But 

why?" 
"I don't know.'' 

"Because the American Gl has been taught to think for himself. If he can't set the bomb off he'll hit the Albanian soldier over the head with it." 
"But isn't there another problem with the neutron bomb?" I said. "I understand many Gls want to retire early to get their pensions. Sup­pose they learn how to use the bomb and then quit the service for their pensions. Who will be left to fire it?" 
"I've been giving that a lot of thought," Ripple man said. "If a GI who specializes in the neutron bomb retires and goes on pension, he would be hired by the Defense Department as a 'civilian special­ist' in charge of firing it." 
''And then the Panama Canal would be saved,'' I cried. 
"I don't know if it will be saved, but it sure as hell will give El Salvador second thoughts about stopping one of our ships from going through the canal before they do."

How To Cook a Corned~ 
by florenceanne ·strigle 

Prepare one Neil Simon Comedy 
Blend in one fresh, two nearly ripe, and 
three vintage thespians 
Add one unseasoned director 
Mix well and serve 
Yields four nights of entertainment, 150 
servings per night 
This is the recipe Maureen Flynn, director 
of Come Blow Your Hom, is using to cook 
this semester's Student Players produc­
tion. The Neil Simon Comedy will be 
presented at the Nazz. in the Rathskellar of 
the LaFortune Student Center, April 21, 
22, 28 and 29 at 8:00 pm. 
Come Blow Your Hom, written in 1961, 
portrays 33 year-old playboy, Alan Baker (Don Murphy), showing his naive, 21 year-old brother. Buddy (Jeff Pecore), how to break the chains of parental domination (Mr. and Mrs. Baker are played by Mike Volbcrding and Brooke Waling) and how to take advantage of bachelorhood. One of Alan's "advantages" is Peggy Evans (Marita De Ia Cotera). The problems resulting from Buddy's corruption a111d from Alan's fall for Connie Dayton (Mary Browne are the meat of the play and its 
humor. 
"It is a fun. fast-paced show.," commen­
ted Pecore. "But it is also the most 
demanding comedy I have ever been in. It 
has very few one-liners or visual aids," he 
said. "You have to work for every laugh 
you get. and that requires a lot from an 
actor -especially an amateur." Jeff 
continued. "In our case," he concluded, 
"putting on Come Blow Your Hom is 
definitely a learn-as-you-go production." 
Flynn first became aware of just how 
much learning was necessary at the play's 
second practice. At this rehearsal, she 
asked Don Murphy and Marita De Ia 
Cotera to go through one of their love 
scenes. being especially aware of projec­
ting their characters' intimacy. In the 
middle of the reading. Don. in an effort to 
project this intimacy. slid his arms from 
around Marita's waist downward. until his 
hands rested on her buttocks. Immediat­
ely Marita pushed him away, and admon­
ished, "Please. nothing below the waist." 
De Ia Cotera. a SMC sophomore, laughed 
about the situation a few weeks later and 
explained. "That was tvpical of the 
difticultics I experienced trying to get into 
character.·· Marita is cast as the stereo­
typical dumb. "loose" girl. "This part is 
particularly hard on me for two reasons," 
she said. "The first is my strict 
upbringing. I kept thinking: .. My father is 
coming to this -what will he think when he 
sees me crawling all over this guy?" 
Marita's other difticultv was that she was 
afraid everyone who saw her would think 
she is "loose" in reality. "I could not 
separate my character f~om myself." she 
emphasized. 
According to Flynn. Marita's problems arc natural for someone who has held only three small roles in other shows. "We (the cast) had to explain to Marita that she was just doing a part and that everyone in the audience would realize this." recalled Flynn. "It was a delicate situation," she observed. 

While all the cast members confirm that Come Blow Your Hom has taught them a lot, the one who claims to have learned the most from the play is Flynn. Come Blow Your Horn is Flynn's first attempt at directing. "I have always been interested in theatre but never intensely involved," Flynn stated. ''My only theatrical exper­iences are some medium-sized roles in high school plays, enrollment in a four-­week course on "Irish Drama" at the Dublin College in 1976 and two theatre courses at Notre Dame,'' she said. 
What has Flynn learned from Come Blow Your Hom O"all the basics -what to look for at an audition. how to block a scene, organization, scheduling, lighting,...you name it. and I have learned it," she quipped. However, "the most important lesson I have learned from Come Blow Your Horn is that one should be willing to help others and accept help from others," she emphasized. 
This primary concern for others that Flvnn underlines is. coincidentally. similar to. the philosophy of the Student Players organization. According to Lou Spisto, co-founder of the group. Student Players has three goals: first. to foster fun and friendship; secondly. to encourage individ­ual growth, particularly in and through theatre; and finally. to present the best show possible. 
Spisto and Pecore. the other co-founder of the Student Players. emphasize that fun and growth are more important than professionalism. ''This is the only group at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's in which complete novices have a good opportunity to dabble in theatre," noted Spisto. "While this could mean less polish," he said. "Student Players is willing to sacrifice it to keep this opportunity in theatre open to novices." 
Other members of the cast also exper­ienced difficulties getting into their parts. Mike Volberding had problems becoming Mr. Baker, the middle-aged father. "Before l would go onstage," he began, "I would think: what arc the charaeterisitics of an older person? I would try to become totally serious and exude control, " he said, "but it did not always work." 
Volbcrding, a junior engineering major, has never been in any theatrical production before and in the initial practices, he became easily frustrated. "I needed a lot of encouragement,'' he admitted. Through awareness exercises and through takes of scenes, retakes, and retakes of retakes, Mike became more sure of himself as Mr. Baker. 
Practice also solved the problem of getting into character for Mary Browne a Saint Mary's government major and novice actress. ''Mary has the almost impossible task of being the only completely straight character in the show," explained Flynn. Consequently, "it is extremely difficult for her to keep up the comic undertones of the show and deliver all the heavy lines." Flynn said. However., Flynn noted that "Mary is holding her own." 
There are three veteran actors in Come 
Blow Your Hom. Two are Brooke Waling. 
a theatre major and a regular face on the 
ND-SMC theatre stage, and Don Murphy, 
a three-time Student Players production 
star. The third veteran is Jeff Pecore, a 
two-time director for· and three-time star in 
Student Players' productions. Pecore is 
also one of the co-founders of the Student 
Players. These actors found themselves above: Brooke Waling as mother; left: [Buddy] Jeff Pecore & [Father] Mike Volberding; below: Marita De Ia Cotera relaxing. [All photos by Mo Flynn] 

learning from practices, too. "The biggest lesson the three of us had to master," observed Murphy, "was concentration. Because Student Players is composed of amateurs, and peer amateurs at that, it is less disciplined than, say, ND-SMC theat­re," Murphy commented. "but," he added, ''A show still has to be produced in a limited amount of time and that means acceptance of responsibility." 

The Christian Message 
"In ten words or less, what's the Chris­
tian message? Let me have it. Ten 
words." 
I said: We're all bastards, but God loves 
us anyway." 
That's the explanation Will Campbell came up with when he was pressed by a friend for a succinct definition of Christi­anity. The definition, when carried to its logical conclusion, would eventually lead Campbell to a profound conversion and reappraisal of his own ministry. 
In a truly remarkable autobiography, Brother to a Dragonfly, Campbell spins a tale of our South during a critical segment of its history. He was a chaplain at Ole Miss, where he quickly found himself in the hot seat of racial trouble. They called Will Campbell a "nigger lover" during the civil rights struggle of the '60s; but are· they not just as liable to call him a "red-neck lover." That's what happened when he began to discover the full imr ::t of the definition of Christianity he had given years earlier. 
In the middle sixties, Campbell, who had acquired quite a name for himself as a civil-rights~ activist, was beginning to harbor some self-doubts. He suspected he might be doing the right things for the wrong reasons. He detected a healthy dose of self-righteousness in his liberal posture. And his suspicions were intensified by black leaders like Stokely Carmichael, who told him it was his job to make sure his own people--Southern red-necks--got religion also. 
A moment of truth came when Campbell learned that his young friend Jonathan Daniel had been killed by a special deputy named Thomas Coleman in Alabama. Will's friend forces him to assess the situation in the light of his definition of Christianity. "Which of these two bas­tards does God love the most? Does he love that little bastard Jonathan the most? Or does he love that living bastard the most?" 
The revelation comes suddenly. Camp­bell realizes that for twenty years he has been entrapped in a ministry of liberal sophistication: "An attempted negation of Jesus, of human engineerin.,, or riding the coattails of Caesar, of playing on his ballpark. by his rules and with his ball, or looking to government to make and verify and authenticate our morality, or worship­ing at the shrine of enlightenment and academia, of making an idol of the Supreme Court, a theology of law and order and of denying not only the Faith I professed to hold but my history and my people--the Thomas Colemans. Loved. And if loved, forgiven. And if forgiven, reconciled." 
Will Campbell saw that his ministry had 

by fr. bill toohey 
become one of Jaw, not of grace. Since then, he has involved himself in a ministry that refuses to take sides. He recognized that God loves equally the hater and the hated; and he tried to live that truth in his own ministry. 
When James Meredith was shot during a march through Mississippi, Campbell vi­sited Meredith in the hospital and then Meredith's assailant who was in jail. Similarly, he has visited in jail the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan. This radical following of the gospel is terribly hard to accept. Indeed, some of Will's former friends have never become reconciled to his latter-day "ministry of reconciliation." 
Nor does he endear himself to all-white Christian academicians when he points out that "the racism at Duke and Harvard and Yale is more serious than what happens when a few pitiful Ku Kluxers march around a burning cross in a cow pasture." 
Campbell is impolite enough to suggest that the Ku Klux Klan if not the only organization with a record of violence. "What about the Ford Motor Company, the textile industry," he wonders, "and their own system of violence; or the American State Department, the war in Vietnam (which was then raging out of all sense and control), or the American churches with their vast holdings and investments and power, or the University which teaches, fosters and carries out more violence in one semester than the Klan has committed in its history, for it is they who produce the owners, the managers, the governors and presidents, the rulers and the warriors." 
No wonder Will Campbell has enemies on the right and the left. He has been forced into becoming a reconcilor by his reading of the gospel and his understanding of the nature of tragedy. Campbell sees through his own smugness and arrogance and pridefulness--the infection of his earlier days as a doctrinaire social activist. He states his case: 
"There was drama and romance in the civil rights movement and we who had no home at home sought that home in the Jlack cause....We did not understand that those we so vulgarly called 'red-neck' were a part of the tragedy. They had been victimized one step beyond the black.... 
"We picked the wrong enemy. We were right in aligning ourselves with the black sufferer. But we were wrong in not directing some of our patience and energy and action to a group which also had a history. A history of slavery.'' 
And Will Campbell's cure for his pride­fulness comes through the realization thai "we are all bastards loved bv God"; forced to acknowledge that, we ail have citizen­ship in the "democracy of sin."

Linksmen boast fourth-place finish 
by Mark Ronsini Sports Writer 
"It was our day in the sun. All our perservence, patience, and hard work paid off. It was a totally outstanding performance by the Notre Dame golfers." These were the words of an elated coach Noel O'Sullivan as he characterized the fourth-place performance of the Notre Dame golf team at the Tenth Annual Kepler Tournament at Ohio State's demanding Scarlet Course. 
Twenty-five teams, representing the best and sturdiest competition in the Midwest gathered for the prestigious event. The Big Ten Conference, as well as the Mid­America Conference, e~;~tered ten participants. The remaining five teams represented the .Midwest's five major independent institu­tions, one of which is Notre Dame. 
After the first ronnd of action in the 54-hole tournament, the Irish sat confidently in fifth place with a combined team score of 396. Ohio State, last year's Big Ten cham­pion and perennial power, quickly revealed its super-team status and jumped to a comfortable first round the challenging par-72 course. advantage.

on the basics." 
Ohio State, as was expected,

good enough for sixth place in a 
field comiJrised of 150 players.
