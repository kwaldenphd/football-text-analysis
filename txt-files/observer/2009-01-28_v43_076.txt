Panel: Obama faces many challenges 
Political science professors speak ofproblem-s and opportunities for the new administration 
By ROBERT SINGER News Writer 
Exactly one week after President Barack Obama's inauguration, a roundtable of political science professors met for a panel discussion, talking about Obama's chal­lenges as he begins to tackle economic and military crises against a backdrop of high expectations. 
The discussion was titled "Challenges and Opportunities Facing the Obama Administration" and held in the Coleman-Morse lounge Tuesday evening. 
Professor Dan Lindley spoke of an overlooked dimension of dealing with high expectations. 

"The power he gets from his popularity is intangible, but nonetheless real," Lindley said. 
Since the public expects Obama to bring about so much _ positive change, they will be more willing to back his pro­posals, he said. 
"High expectations are a form of power," Lindley said. 

These expectations will apply to many different crises as the United States confronts chal­lenges in a variety of arenas, according to the professors at the roundtable. 
Lindley spoke of the need to build strong alliances by focus­ing on mutual interests to meet

Accounting prograllls ranked in top 10 
By AARON STEINER Assistant News Ediror 

Notre Dame's Accountancy Program recently received high marks from an annual survey of accounting profes­sors nationwide. The under­graduate program was ranked fourth in the nation and the Master of Science in Accountancy program was ranked sixth among graduate programs in Public Accounting Report (PAR), a trade maga­zine. 
Fred Mittelstaedt, professor of accountancy and chair of the department, said Notre Dame has ranked high in the report for "the last number of years." 
"The undergraduate pro­gram has been in the top five for the last several years," Mittelstaedt said. 
According to the report from PAR, "the survey asks account­ing professors, department heads and department chairs to name the undergraduate and graduate programs that ... they feel most consistently turn out students capable of some day attaining partner status." 
Mittelstaedt said because of the survey's nature, choices are "based on reputation, how [professors) think our students do, and also their perceptions about what they know of our

Food compost plan started by student 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Writer 
On average, Notre Dame stu­dents waste 5.03 ounces of food every meal. So junior Sarah Cline is working to implement a composting sys­tem. in which food wasted in the dining halls would be con­verted into fertilizer, instead of rotting in a landfill. 
Cline, a junior and member of GreeND, won the United Nations' "Climate Crews" com­petition with the help of last semester's GreeND president Lourdes Long. The competition called for students to submit a plan to improve the environ­mental impact of their school. 
Cline entered a proposal to cbange the way thP University's dining halls get rid of food waste. 
"There is a lot of food waste in the dining halls that can't be recycled. but it's better jf it's not just thrown in a land­fill." she said. "They can use it as fertilizer and it's really helpful." 
About half of colleges and universitios nationwide have a composting system, Cline said, but Notre Dame currently has no system in place. 
"At this point, all of the waste in the dining hall gets

Turn off 

the lights 
When I was little, my parents gave me a lot of instructions. They told me to duck if someone throws a softball at my head and I can't catch it. They told me not to bite the cat, regardless if it bit me first. 
They also told me that I should always, always, always, turn off a light when I leave a room. Just flip­ping a switch saves them money, saves the light bulb, and saves ener­
gy.  
Now that I'm  
almost 20 years  Laura Myers  
old, that seems  
like common  
sense. Which is  Sports Writer  
why I was sur­ 
prised at what I  

saw on Thursday and Friday as I walked home from Legends. 
On Thursday, my friend Katie and I went to Legends for their poker league. It ended at 2:30a.m. (Katie came in third or fourth). We live in Cavanaugh, so we walked past Debartolo and O'Shag and then into the little alley comprised of Hayes­Healy, Riley, and Nieuwland. Interestingly enough, literally all of the lights in Hayes-Healy were on, and several in Nieuwland. 
On Friday, my friends and I went to the comedians, who were disgusting, by the way. I'm all for a dirty joke, but these guys, the second one espe­cially, went above and beyond what anyone would consider reasonable. Half the time, the crowd, rather than laughing, just stared at him open­mouthed. Come on man, know your audience. 
Anyway, I walked back from that a little after midnight. This time, a good two-thirds of the lights in Nieuwland were still on. Now, I know some teachers love to hear them­selves talk, but I don't think there were any physics lectures that con­tinued to midnight on Friday. 
This year I happened to shack up with two environmental science majors, so my literacy in all things Green has gone up a bit, which is why I'm fairly up in arms about this. I mean, Notre Dame just won a $10,000 award for its sustainability efforts, but they can't turn off some lights? 
And maybe if it were just one or two lights, I could understand the slip up. But as I said, it was literally the entire building on Thursday night, and a majority on Friday. There is just no excuse for that. 
Story formula: Present the problem. Present the reasons for the problem. Present solutions to the problem. 
So here are some solutions. 1) Make sure you have a custodian go around and check that kind of thing. GreenND wants suggestions of what to do with the money it won -why not use it to ensure lights get turned off? 2) Let us do it for you. I bet that volunteers from Cavanaugh (the win­ners of RecycleMania last year), would have no problem heading ov_er to Nieuwland and turning off lights. It's one of those things that's not hard to do. 3) Turn off the light when you leave a room. 
Of course, a five-year old could tell you that.

Firefighter charged for stealing severed foot 
PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. ­Authorities said the St. Lucie County firefighter who took a man's severed foot from an Interstate 95 crash scene last year has been charged with misdemeanor theft. The firefighter told the Florida Highway Patrol after the Sept. 19 crash that she took the remains to help train her cadaver dog. She eventually resigned from the St. Lucie County Fire District. She was arrest­ed Monday. 
FHP Lt. Tim Frith said 
TODAY 
the severity of a theft charge is usually deter­mined by the value of what is stolen. Since there's no law specifically dealing with the theft of a body part, he said it was diffieult to determine the monetary value of the foot. 
The firefighter was released from jail on her own reeognizance Monday afternoon.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 

COR discusses funds bias 
Members express concern aver bias duringfunds distribution, offer solutions 
By LIZ O'DONNELL 
News Writer 
The Council of Representatives discussed .the process of allocating funds in its meeting Tuesday evening, with student body president Bob Reish expressing his con­cerns about possible bias when funds are distributed. 
Although the council ulti­mately decided that bias within the Financial Management Board (FMB) would be eliminated based on the checks and~ balances in place in the board, discussion was spurred by interest among COR members in learning about the allocation process, specifically from which. sources the money comes, and where the money goes. 
Currently, the allocation process takes place in the spring and members of stu­dent government organiza­tions (class councils, Club Coordination Council and others) create proposals that are given to the FMB at the allocation meeting. 
Members of the FMB, which include outgoing members from student government, lis­ten to all the proposals and then decide on fund alloca­tion. 
Reish wanted the council to take a closer look into the process to determine whether or not there were any biases present during the allocation process.

the security threats of the 21st century. 
"He talks a lot about com­mon security," he said. "The key to common security is common threat perception. How can Obama engineer a sense of common sense per­ception among different nations?" 
If Professor Tony Messina's account of transatlantic rela­tions is any indication, diplo­macy with European nations could prove difficult. 
"In the past Europeans made a very clear distinction of a president they didn't like and the United States," Messina said. "That boundary now is getting blurred. The Europeans are moving toward a worldview that excludes the United States from their think­ing, as far as international leadership." 
Messina said U.S. policies have caused Europe's unfavor­able views. American policy in the Middle East, U.S. action on climate change, the hard stance the Bush administration took against' Russia and the economic competition between the U.S. and the European Union are some of the reasons for the tension, according to Messina. 
Professor Dianne Pinderhughes expressed con­cern that the economic crisis is affecting African-Americans disproportionately, noting that blacks' incomes are on aver­age two thirds of whites', while also raising worries about the enforcement of voting rights laws. 
According to Pinderhughes, during the Bush administra­tion, the Department _of Justice hired numerous people to fill n·on-political positions on the basis of whether they were conservative, Republican and "right thinking." 

Fair 
continued from page 1 
Due to the state of the economy, the number of companies that will be represented at this year's fair is down slightly, Monahan said. 
However, Monahan still expects that students will find "numbers are down slightly, but we still have a good number of employers and a good mix of employers, as well," Monahan said. 
NBC Universal will be one of the companies present at the fair, as well as the public rela­tions company Edelman, Monahan said. Schurz Communications, a company that works in radio and televi­sion, will also be seeking stu­dents, Monahan said. 
'To have a couple public rela­tions firms and advertising firms coming to campus, that speaks well for the draw that is Notre Dame," he said 
In order to prepare for attend­ing the fair, Monahan recom­mended that students log into Go IRISH through the Career Center Web site and choose eight to 10 companies to speak with at the fair. 
Students should research the companies and find out what positions they have posted. 
After researching, Monahan said that students should "then actually go up to the company, introduce themselves and have some questions prepared about 
"My argument is that some of those individuals who were hired might still be in the department and might affect the way voting rights are administered," she said. 
The Obama presidency has a chance to set aside an incre­mental approach and trans­form the government's role in economic and other domestic policy, according to Professor Peri Arnold. 
"We are in a moment of tec­tonic shift in American politics which makes for a different kind of president," he said. 
Arnold remarked on what he 
viewed as a decline in govern­
ment competence over the last 
30 years, arguing that Obama 
has the opportunity to reverse 
this trend. · "There was once a time 
when young people like 'you 
thought about working for the 
federal government," he said. 
"I think we are in a time of 
change," he said. 
He added: "Barack Obama's 
conception of government is 
one that will inspire us." 
Arnold said that in times of 
crisis, past presidents like 
Franklin Roosevelt have gam­
bled with history by proposing 
bold agendas. 
"It's very risky, but it's exact­
ly these kinds of presidencies 
that have made the assump­
tion that there is an opportuni­
ty for great change," he said. 
"It's like walking out on a high 
wire without a safety net." 
Professor John Roos argued 
that as Obama takes steps for­
ward, he must make an effort 
to cooperate with Republicans 
or risk upsetting the nation's 
ideological divide and losing 
his high level of initial support. 
"The first big test is going to 
come in the next two weeks," 
he said. "I think he's going to 
get what he wants, but the 
question is whether he is going 
to get enough Republican votes 
to appear bipartisan."

the job opportunity or about the company and make a good solid impression on that firm," Monahan said. 
Although it is helpful to bring a resume to the fair, Monahan said that it is not a requirement. 
"It's recommended to bring a resume, but if you don't have a resume, that should not stop you from coming," Monahan said. 
Since there are a large num­ber of companies from many dif­ferent areas coming to the fair, students should narrow down the companies that they would like to learn more about. 
"With 135 companies, you have to be a little strategic about who you would like to approach," Monahan said. 
In addition to NBC Universal, Edelman and Schurz, Monahan mentioned Baxter Healthcare Corporation, which is interested in science students. A company that makes athletic wear, Under Armour is looking for students for its retail side, he said. 
Additionally, there will be a "number of engineering firms" such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, according to Monahan. 
First year and second year students should not hesitate to come the fair, according to Monahan. 
"They should come and check it out and use this as an infor­mation gathering ... that way they will be much more pre­pared," Monahan said.

Cafe 
continued from pag:e 1 
the demand for coffee and snacks increases during stress­ful times such as midterms and finals week, Callison said. 
Callison said Pangborn's hall staff came up with the idea in November, and most of the planning for the cafe has been completed in recent weeks. The hall staff created the cafe to respond to the wishes of students who 'wanted hot drinks without trudging through South Bend's frigid winter weather. 
Callison said the cafe organ­izers eventually want to expand the amount of snacks it offers. 
"We will definitely have more variety in the food and drinks we offer if we get a good response. This could mean that we have baked goods such as warm pretzels and fresh cookies, or somethipg like dif­ferent syrups to accompany the coffee," Callison said. "I think hot spiced cider would also be a popular option, espe­cially given such cold Notre Dame weather." 
The Phoxy Cafe has received positive feedback so far, she said. The cafe offered two free sample nights, and the girls who attended found the cafe's atmosphere and decor very pleasant. 
Organizers administered sur­veys during the sample nights to gather ideas that could improve the cafe. 
Phoxy Cafe shifts are cur­rently voluntary, as the cafe is still trying to cover its startup costs, Callison said. 
However, if the cafe contin­ues its success, Pangborn resi­dents may be able to work there for pay eventually, 
Callison said. 

The cafe's profits will go 
toward dorm activities and -equipment. Callison suggested an espresso machine, but prof­its may also be set aside to go to a charitable cause that 
Pangborn residents support; 

Although the cafe's patrons 
might be mostly from 
Paqgborn, Callison said that all 
are welcome. 

"I feel like this cafe will be a 
great way to make the dorm 
feel more like a home, and 
that it could serve to connect 
students of all years and 
dorms," Callsion said. "It's also 
a great means of setting 
Pangborn apart from other 
dorms. We may be that box in 
the corner, but we are a

Mexican immigrant remittances fall 
MEXICO CITY -The money sent home by Mexican migrants fell in 2008 for the first time on record, Mexico's central bank said Tuesday -part of a global trend that could worsen as emigrants from developing countries lose jobs in the global fmancial crisis. 
Remittances, Mexico's second-largest source of foreign income after oil, plunged 3.6 percent to $25 billion in 2008 compared to $26 billion for the previous year, the central bank said. 
The percentage drop is nearly twice what the government had expected for the year, and cen­tral bank official Jesus Cervantes said the decline will likely continue this year. 
Experts blame a crackdown on illegal immi­gration that has stemmed the flow of those heading north to seek work as well as the U.S. recession, in which many Mexicans, especially construction workers, have been laid off. 
It ·was the first time remittances have fallen year-to-year since the bank starting tracking the money 13 years ago.

Mbm. voters testify to save ballots 
ST. PAUL -Minnesota voters testified Tuesday their ballots had been unfairly rejected as . Republican Norm Coleman argued thousands of disqualified absentee ballots should be counted in the U.S. Senate race.

CIB finance connnittee recommends cut 
INDIANAPOLIS -The Indianapolis Capital Improvements Board expects to lose more money than it originally projected from its oper­ation of Lucas Oil Stadium, Conseco Fieldhouse, Victory Field and the Indiana Convention Center next year. 
The CIB's finance committee recommended Tuesday an 8 percent cut in its operating budget and an immediate freeze on hiring, salaries and travel, which it said would save about $6 million. 
"We're going to continue to review this," CIB president Bob Grand said. "If 8 percent isn't enough, we'll have to cut further."

Metropolitan Kirill elected patriarch 
Interim leader of the Russian Orthodox Church receives 508 out of 700 votes 
Associated Press 

MOSCOW -The interim leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, seen as a modernizer who could seek a historic reconciliation with the Vatican and more autonomy from the state, was over­whelmingly elected patriarch Tuesday. 
Metropolitan Kirill received 508 of the 700 votes cast dur­ing an ali-day church congress in Moscow's ornate Christ the Savior Cathedral, the head of the commission responsible for the election, Metropolitan lsidor, said hours after the secret ballot was over. 
Kirill defeated a conserva­tive rival, Metropolitan Kliment, who received. 169 votes, lsidor said. Another 23 ballots were declared invalid,

Avvard-vvinning vvriter John Updike dead at 76 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -John Updike, the Pulitzer Prize-winning nov­elist, prolific man of letters and erudite chronicler of sex, divorce and other adventures in the postwar prime of the American empire, died Tuesday at age 76. 
Updike, best known for his four Rabbit" novels, died of lung cancer at a hospice near his home in Beverly Farms, Mass., according to his long­time publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. 
A literary writer who fre­quently appeared on best-seller lists, the tall, hawk-nosed Updike wrote novels, short sto­ries, poems, criticism, the memoir "Self-Consciousness" and even a famous essay about baseball great Ted Williams. 
He released more than 50 books in a career that started in the 1950s, winning virtually every literary prize, including two Pulitzers, for "Rabbit Is Rich" and "Rabbit at Rest," and two National Book Awards. 
Although himself deprived of a Nobel, he did bestow it upon one of his fictional characters, Henry Bech, the womanizing, egotistical Jewish novelist who collected the literature prize in 1999. 
His settings ranged from the court of "Hamlet" to postcolo­nial Africa, but his literary home was the American sub­urb, the great new territory of mid-century fiction. 
Born in 1932, Updike spoke for millions of Depression-era readers raised by "penny­pinching parents," united by "the patriotic cohesion of World War II" and blessed by a "dis­proportionate share of the world's resources," the postwar, suburban boom of "idealistic careers and early marriages." 
He captured, and sometimes embodied, a generation's confu­sion over the civil rights and women's movements, and oppo­sition to the Vietnam War. Updike was called a misogynist, a racist and an apologist for the establishment. 
On purely literary grounds, he was attacked by Norman Mailer as the kind of author appreciated by readers who knew nothing about writing. Last year, judges of Britain's Bad Sex in Fiction -Prize voted Updike lifetime achievement honors. 
But more often he was praised for his flowing, poetic writing style. Describing a man's interrupted quest to make love, Updike likened it "to a small angel to which all after­noon 'tiny lead weights are attached." 
Nothing was too great or too small for Updike to poeticize. He might rhapsodize over the film projector's "chuckling whir" or look to the stars and observe that "the universe is perfectly transparent: we exist as flaws in ancient glass." 

Author Joyce Carol Oates, a friend of Updike's, said there was a "luminosity in John"s style that was just extraordi­nary. He also had a wonderful, warm, sympathetic sense of humor which people didn't always notice." 
In the richest detail, his books recorded the extremes of earth­ly desire and spiritual zealotry, whether the comic philandering of the preacher in "A Month of Sundays" or the steady rage of the  young Muslim in "Terrorist." 
Raised in the Protestant com­munity of Shillington, Pa., where the Lord's Prayer was recited daily at school, Updike was a lifelong churchgoer influ­enced by his faith, but not immune to doubts. 
"I remember the times when I was wrestling with these issues that I would feel crushed. I was crushed by the purely material­istic, atheistic account of the universe," Updike told The Associated Press during a 2006 interview. 
"I am very prone to accept all that the scientists tell us, the truth of it, the authority of the efforts of all the men and woman spent trying to under­stand more about atoms and molecules. But I can't quite make the leap of unfaith, as it were, and say, 'This is it. Carpe diem (seize the day), and tough luck.'" 
He received his greatest acclaim for the "Rabbit" series, a quartet of novels published over a 30-year span that fea­tured ex-high school basketball star Harry "Rabbit" Angstrom and his restless adjustment to adulthood and the constraints of work and family. To the very end, Harry was in motion, an innocent in his belief that any door could be opened, a believ­er in God even as he bedded women other than his wife. 
The series "to me is the tale of a life, a life led by an American citizen who shares the national passion for youth, freedom, and sex, the national openness and willingness to learn, the national habit of improvisation," Updike would later write. "He is furthermore a Protestant, haunted by a God whose manifestations are elu­sive, yet all-important." 
Other notable books included "Couples," a sexually explicit tale of suburban mating that sold millions of copies; "In the Beauty of the Lilies," an epic of American faith and fantasy; and "Too Far to Go," which fol­lowed the courtship, marriage and divorce of the Maples, a suburban couple with parallels to Updik~s own first marriage.

IN BRIEF 
Rising unemployment hits all states 
WAS! liNGTON -Rising unemployment spared no state last month, and 2009 is shaping up as another miserable year for workers from coast to coast. 
Jobless rates for December hit double digits in Michigan and Rhode Island, while South Carolina and Indiana notched the biggest gains from the previous month, the Labor Department said Tuesday. A common thread among these states has been manufacturing industry layoffs tied to consumers' shrinking appetite for cars, furniture and other goods. 
With tens of thousands of layoffs announced this week by well-known employers such as Pfizer Inc., Caterpillar Inc. and Home Depot Inc., the unemployment picture is bound to get worse in every region of the country, economists say. 
"We won't see a light at the end of the tunnel until 2010," said Anthony Sabino, a professor of law and business at St. John's University. 
Hedge fund manager surrenders 
TAMPA -On the day a Florida hedge fund manager surrendered to face federal securi­ties and_ wire fraud charges, authorities dis­closed what may have set in motion his two weeks on the lam: A partner concerned about the health of their funds after the Bernard Madoff scandal was pressuring him to have their books audited by an independent accountant. 
It's not yet elear where Arthur Nadel was during his time on the run, but he peacefully surrendered to authorities with two lawyers in tow in Tampa, about an hour north of his home in Sarasota, the FBI said. 
Nadel, who was due to pay investors $50 million when he disappeared, was chained at the waist and wrists when he appeared in court later Tuesday. Attorney Barry Cohen said Nadel is not violent and asked that he be released on his own recognizance. He said Nadel has emotional problems and does not pose a flight risk, but a federal judge ordered him held at least until Friday. 
Asked outside court where his client had been, Cohen said, "He went away for a while just to be alone." He said Nadel turned himself in as soon as he learned about the charges. 
Consumer confidence hits record low

Americans are battered by headlines about massive job cuts, im~uding thou­sands at Home Depot, Corning, General Motors and Caterpillar in just the past two days, and are still watching the values of their homes and retirement funds dwindle. 

"Virtually, there is no con­fidence out there," said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group 
LLC. "Household anxiety has reached a point that we can count them out to get us out of the recession."

Citigroup changes plan to purchase jet 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Citigroup won't be getting a new corporate jet after all. 
Under pressure from President Barack Obama, one of the nation's largest banks reversed course, announcing that it will not take deliv­ery of the jet it had planned to pur­chase before the credit crisis unfold­ed. 
The canceled deal ·came as many politicians voiced concern about how banks are spending government bailout money. 
The White House reached out to . Citigroup on Monday to reiterate Obama's position that such jets are not "the best use of money at this point," calling them "outrageous" spending for a company getting tax­payer dollars, said a White House offi­cial who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was describing private conversations. 
In a statement late Monday, Citigroup Inc. said it paid a deposit in 2005 to acquire the jet. The New York-based bank said it did not plan to use government money for the pur­chase, and it noted that any cancella­tion of the deal would probably lead to multimillion-dollar penalties. 
On Monday, the New York Post reported that Citi was set to take pos­session of the jet even after receiving $45 billion from the government. 
The government is also providing guarantees on hundreds of billions of dollars of Citi investments in mort­gages and other troubled investments. 
With the cancellation of the jet deal, a deposit on the plane will be lost, but is recoverable once the jet is sold, according to a person familiar with the situation. Citi was in the process of purchasing a Dassault Falcon 7X for $50 million, the person said. 
Citi is also planning to cut the num­ber of corporate jets in its existing fleet from five to two, said the person, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because the details have not been made public. 
Corporate jets have become contro­versial during the credit crisis as crit­ics of large companies question the cost of owning and operating the air­craft, especially for businesses receiv­ing government help. 
In November, executives of automakers Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC were sharply criticized for flying on corpo­rate jets to Washington to ask Congress for federal bailout money.

Obama seeks GOP help, compromise 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -On the eve of a key vote, President Barack Obama privately promised Republicans he stands ready to accept changes in the $825 billion ec<momic stimulus legislation, invoked Ronald Reagan to rebut conservative critics and urged lawmakers to "put poli­tics aside" in the interest of creating jobs. 
"The American people expect action," Obama said Tuesday as he shuttled between closed-door meet­ings with House and Senate Republicans on a trip to the Capitol that blended sub­stance with political symbol­ism. 
Republicans who attended the sessions said the presi­dent did not agree to any spe­cific changes but did pledge to have his aides consider some that GOP lawmakers raised dealing with additional tax relief for businesses. 
Prodded to budge on anoth­er point, Obama said that despite opposition, he will insist on giving relief to wage­earners who pay Social Security taxes but do not earn enough to owe income tax. His spokesman said the presi­dent reminded his critics that former President Reagan ­conservative hero to many contemporary Republicans ­supported the same concept while in the White House. 
In a measure of the complex political dynamic in Congress, House Republican leaders urged their rank and file to oppose the stimulus measure hours before Obama arrived. 
One Republican later quot­ed the president as saying any changes would have to come after the House giv'es what is expected to be largely party-line approval Wednesday to the Democratic-backed bill. Debate began late in the day on the measure, which includes about $550 billion in spending and roughly $275 billion in tax cuts. Democrats made one small change, vot­ing to delete $20 million intended for renovating the National Mall. Republicans had criticized the expenditure as wasteful. 
In the Senate, traditionally more bipartisan than the House, a companion bill grew to roughly $900 billion. That included a new tax break for upper middle-income taxpay­ers, at a one-year cost of $70 billion. It was advanced by Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, senior Republican on the Finance Committee. 
Democratic leaders in both houses have promised to have legislation ready for Obama's signature by mid-February, and Tuesday's developments coincided with fresh evidence of deterioration in a national economy seemingly growing weaker by the day. 
Housing prices tumbled by the sharpest annual rate on record in November, accord­ing to a closely watched pri­vate report released during the day, and a measure of consumer confidence dropped to a historic low. 
Separately, the Treasury Department announced distri­bution of $386 million to 23 troubled banks, the first awards from the federal bailout fund since Obama took office a week ago. 
Obama traveled to and from the Capitol in a snow,y motor­cade on Tuesday, far different from the inaugural parade seven days earlier. This was a business trip, marking his second reach across party lines in as many days in keep­ing with a pledge to seek bipartisan solutions to major problems. 
On Monday, he leaned on House Democrats to jettison an item that would make it easier for states to provide family planning funds for the poor under Medicaid, a provi­sion in the legislation that had become a target of ridicule for Republicans. Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Obama supports the con­cept but wants it included in a different bill. 
Ironically, Democrats said deleting the provision would wind up increasing federal spending, since it probably would mean more money spent on higher pregnancy and postnatal care. 
House Republican leaders welcomed the president a few hours after urging their rank­and-file to oppose the stimu­lus bill, and it was far from clear that Obama ·had man­aged to pick up any GOP sup­port during the day. 
Gibbs said the White House expects some GOP lawmakers will vote for the measure on Wednesday in the House, and indicated he hopes there will be more in the Senate and even more later when a final compromise is reached. 
One Republican senator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president pledged to Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., to have aides review two specific proposals. One would affect businesses that pay down their debt. The other would provide a tempo­rary tax holiday for compa­nies that have money over­seas and bring it back to the United States to invest. 
Obama ventured into an uncertain political environ­ment when he stepped into the Capitol, a president with high approval ratings pitching a plan that also has been favorably received in the polls. 
Republicans, on the other hand, are tryiog to regroup after last fall's elections, in which they lost the White House as well as seats in both houses of Congress. While some conservatives seem eager to mount a frontal attack on Obama and his plans, others are pursuing a strategy of criticizing con­gressional Democrats rather than the president. 
Hours earlier, according to officials who were present at a GOP meeting, none of the Republicans in attendance spoke up in disagreement when urged to oppose the leg­islation by their leaders. Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the party's leader, and Eric Cantor of Virginia, the second in command, said they want­ed "100 percent" opposition to the measure, which they argue includes billions in wasteful spending, these offi­cials said. 
Canada plans stimulus package 
Associated Press 
OTTAWA Canada's Conservative government unveiled a $32 billion plan to stimulate the flagging econo­my Tuesday, a move that could stave off opposition threats to force Prime Minister Stephen Harper from office. 
Finance .Minister Jim Flaherty said the two-year stimulus package includes $9.8 billion for infrastructure. Flaherty is predicting a deficit in Canada for the first time in more than a decade. 
New Liberal Party leader Michael lgnatieff said he'll announce Wednesday whether he'll support the package. The opposition Liberals had vowed to use a parliamentary confi­dence vote to topple Harper's minority government if the stimulus plan fell short. 
"There are some positive signs to this budget," Ignatieff said. "There's some things that we are concerned about. There's a negative side." 
Ignatieff said he's concerned the government has underes­timated the seriousness of the crisis, but he said the govern-

ment has responded to the combined pressure of the opposition parties and those results are positive. 
The credit crisis and the global sell-off of commodities have started to hit Canada hard. The country lost more than 100,000 jobs in the last two months of 2008, and the central bank is predicting eco­nomic output will contract 4.8 percent in the first quarter. 
Flaherty called the crisis "the challenge of our time." 
"Canadians are feeling the effects of the global recession, and they are concerned," he said. . 
The government is providing money for bridges and high­ways, high-speed Internet net­works and home retrofits. The government also lengthened the amount of time unem­ployed people will be able to collect insurance if they are laid off. 
There's also government credit support for automobile leasing, and there is money for job retraining programs, the aboriginal population and struggling industries such as the auto sector and forestry. 
Flaherty said he is prepared 
to provide more  stimulus if  
necessary.  
"We  are  in  uncharted  

waters," Flaherty said. "The economists have been wrong in their predictions. All of the so-called experts continue to become more pessimistic in their forecasts. Things could: get worse and if they get worse, we'll do more."

By the time I'd opened my eyes I was wide awake. I leapt out of bod and bounded down the stairs, skipping steps without noticing. For weeks I'd dreamt of this moment, the glorious 
Brad Blomstrom 
opportunity to unwrap the won­ders of another 

The Daft Punk 
Christmas morn­ing. As I wildly tore into Santa's delivery my mind raced with predictions of what precious gift waited for me beneath the ribbons, bows and wrapping paper. A Luke Zeller Fathead? Sadly no; that wouldn't lit on my waiL 4,000 plastic balls to make a ball pit in my apartment'? Disappointingly no; the package was too smalL A beer tree? Understandably no; people tell me those don't really exist. I was still struggling to come up with a suitable guess when I lifted the lid on the box and looked down at my reward for being an exceptionally good boy in 2008. I wish I could tell you that I was satisfied with what I discovered, but the sight that met my eyes left me shocked, disheartened, and thoroughly embit­tered. 
There they were, staring back up at me with their cold, steely, button eyes and their gnarled, zippered grin. Pants. Thanks a lot, Santa. I got a pair last year, too. Do you know how many times I've worn them? Zero. You really phoned this one in, didn't you? My Christmas list this year was just a post-it note with "ANYTHING BUT PANTS" scribbled on it in Sharpie. I hate pants and I hate you for being jolly while wearing them. 
Before you get upset with me for yelling at Santa Claus, perhaps I should explain the rationale behind my loathing for legged clothing. Pants, like HesLife, The Berlin Wall and the bouncer at Fever, were created to keep us down. They restrict our movement and crush the human spirit, preventing us from ever fully experiencing the freedom we cherish. Take a second right now and think of the times in your life when you were truly happy. Now think of the times in your life when you wore wearing pants. Not much overlap, right? History's greatest heroes were usually barelegged, its greatest villains exces­sively clad. Did Gandhi wear pants when he led the Indian nation to freedom? No, but llitler wore a crisp pair when he goose-stepped into Poland in 1939. Did Usain Bolt wear pants when he set the world record in the 100-meter dash in Beijing'? No, but the 2.3 million people in prison in the United States were each given a fresh pair upon inearceration. Each morning when I see some poor soul in jeans out on the quad I whisper, "Welcome to Shawshank." and head to the Grotto to light a candle. 

At homo in Virginia, my friends and I can skirt (or short) the issue for much of the year thanks to the mild climate, but in the depths of winter it's all pants, all the time. I can only imagine the eternal nightmare that unfolds year-round in Alaska. Do you want to know why I voted for Barack Obama? Because he's from Hawaii, a land free from the tyran­ny of trousers. That, America, is change I can believe in. 
Political considerations aside, I'm proud to say that the pants-wearing plague is noticeably less rampant at Notre Dame than it is at other cold weather locales. It's taken a lot of cre­ativity and courage, but we at Notre Dame have finally ligured out how to really stick it to the man. The answer: sweatpants. They're technically still "pants" for accounting purposes, but everyone knows pajamas-in-disguise when they see them. I can move like a cat in those things. They're durable, eomfortable and suitable for every occa­sion. Last night I went to sleep in a pair of sweatpants. Today I went to class, met with a professor, and went out on a date in them. Come to think of it, I haven't taken this pair off in over a week. Showering and changing? Yeah, right! Thanks to sweatpants I'm able to simply hop out of bed and amble on over to DeBartolo every morning in no time. 
One might expect the functionality of sweatpants to come at the expense of style, but this is simply not the case. I've been at Notre Dame for three and a half years now and I know high fashion when I see it. Nothing says sexy like the supple softness of sweatpants. They sure go great with a North Face, too. I wish I had a new pair of Uggs into which I could snugly tuck them; then I'd look g-o-o-d ... 
My advice to you? Wear your sweat­pants proudly, Notre Dame. In the war against the oppressive pants regime, they make us frontline· freedom fighters.

What happened to your rights? 
Last year on Sept. 20th, 37 Notre Dame students were arrested at an off campus party in a private residence at 702 E. Colfax Ave, including Notre Dame football play­ers Will Yeatman 
Jeevan Subbiah
and Mike Golic Jr. Based on various accounts appearing Guest in the press, there Columnist appear to be seri­ous allegations of police misconduct, including unlawful entry, illegally obtained evidence and mistreatment and taunting of these students. 
One of the central issues emerging in wake of the arrests is what fundamental due process rights do Notre Dame stu­dents have under these circumstances? Are these fundamental rights protected by provisions in du Lac, the student handbook? For example, if the police illegally obtained evidence during this raid, would the University be able to use such tainted evidence in a disciplinary hearing even though it would otherwise be inadmissible in court under the "exclusionary rule?" What stops the police from repeatedly violating stu­dent's rights to obtain evidence if they know the University will use it? 
Public universities are obliged by law to grant students 14th Amendment lib­erty and property due process rights. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that public colleges cannot expel students without proceedings that pro­vide at least minimal due process (Dixon v. Alabama State Board of Education, 1961). The 197 5 Supreme Court case Goss v. Lopez, ruled that stu­dents in public universities must be given notice and a hearing at a mini­mum before being suspended. However, the Supreme Court has not given stu­dents the right to be represented by lawyers in hearings for suspensions or to cross examine witnesses and produce evidence. Universities are not required to follow criminal trial procedural requirements in a disciplinary hearing. But some states have added student protections, such as laws allowing lawyers into student discipline hearings. Georgia ruled that all student hearings must be open and that disciplinary hearings are not educational records under The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). Yet Louisiana and Oklahoma had contradic­tory court decisions on the same matter. 
Private universities such as Notre Dame are not required by law to guar­antee these same 14th Amendment lib­erty and property due process rights. They are obliged to adhere to their con­tractual agreement with students and therefore must follow the disciplinary procedures spelled out in their student handbooks and judicial codes. The lack of guaranteed due process rights at pri­vate schools makes the issue of what is written in the du Lac Student Handbook that much more important. Students should compare du Lac's protections, such as the burden of proof for dis­missal, or the procedures for witnesses and evidence against the protections guaranteed in the handbooks of other universities. 
The 2006 Duke University Lacrosse case brought the issue of student due process rights at a private university into the national spotlight. Bias against the students was exposed in the media, police and university disciplinary sys­tem. The 2007 pr.-;Jsident of the Duke Student Government, Elliott Wolf, wrote an article "Dude, Where're My Rights?" detailing the removal of many student rights from Duke's Judicial code over a nine-year period. Student rights elimi­nated included the need to find proba­ble cause by a judicial officer, the right to remain silent at a hearing with no inference of guilt, the right to an open hearing if F:ERPA rights were waived, the right to confront witnesses and the exclusion of evidence obtained illegally through unlawful search and seizure. 
It would be interesting to see if simi­lar erosions of student rights have occurred in the du Lac student hand­book. Repercussions of the Duke Lacrosse case include lawsuits against Duke University and the city of Durham for claims including harassment, depri­vation of civil rights, and breach of con­tract. 
The Duke Lacrosse case due process issues are well detailed in "The Torch," a publication defending student rights, and in a blog titled Durham-in­Wonderland by Professor KC Johnson. In the June 4, 2007 issue of "The Torch," Robert Shibley wrote that Elliott Wolf sent a March 29, 2000 memoran­dum to Duke's Associate Dean of Students and Director of Judicial Affairs arguing that Duke should not "pursue judicial action against a student based on evidence collected by law enforce­ment officers that was illegally obtained." For example, is Notre Dame considering using illegally obtained evi­dence against those arrested? 
Notre Dame students and their par­ents pay roughly $160,000 for their expensive education at Notre Dame. Though public school students are guaranteed greater due process rights, any private school can enhance student rights by including them in their student handbook. In this internet age, where a student's reputation and future can be affected for life, the issue of what due process rights are guaranteed is very important. National and state laws on this topic seem to be evolving quickly. 
The bottom line for many students, parents and alumni may be that Notre Dame should value and guarantee at least some basic and fundamental due process rights in the du Lac student handbook. Perhaps for Notre Dame, the bottom line may be that students, par­ents and alumni may start to make their final determination of what university to attend and financially support based on which universities afford basic due process protections for their students.

Dear Mr. Smith, 
Even if any hot girls ignored your request and decided to read the entirety of your article ("Uphold Constitution" Jan. 26), I don't think you are in danger of being regarded as an intellec­tual. In the letter you claim offended you so much ("Objectivity please," Jan. 23), Furtado never even asserts his own opinion on whether the facility at Guantanamo Bay should ultimate­ly be closed. He simply expressed a desire to read about both sides of the issue in The Observer. 
Nevertheless, you managed to infer from the letter that the author denies the existence of innocents at Guantanamo, rejects global warm­ing and does not believe in evolution. 
Further, you suggest that Furtado is somehow responsible for our failing economy. Surely any­one who does not believe that global warming 

Missing the point 
is, as you ironically proclaimed, a "cold, sober 
fact," cannot hold a valid opinion about any 
important issue. The miniscule portion of your 
response that was not devoted to defending 
your "carefully constructed persona" or person­
ally attacking the author stiH failed to make a 
convincing argument. The Constitution is in no 
way being "cavalierly" dispensed of, as only U.S. 
citizens are afforded its protection. Torture is 
used to obtain information, not as a deterrent. 
I don't blame you for Il!istakenly asserting that "Even the Nazis got habeas corpus." After all, President Obama made the same claim while campaigning in Pennsylvania last sum­mer. However, the Nazis were not afforded habeas corpus at Nuremberg. The criminals were tried in an international military tribunal, not a U.S. court, an important distinction in itself. More significantly, the Nazis did not have the right to challenge their detention, which is the very defmition of habeas corpus. 
It is tragic to hear about innocent people who have been detained at Guantanamo. The torture of innocents is indeed unacceptable. This is the best, and perhaps the only valid point you make in your letter. Unfortunately, you were unable to avoid the "spin and distortion" you so nobly condemned. Although you might personally believe the issue of whether or not to close Guantanamo is not up for debate, there is cer­tainly a discussion to be had. 
I, like Furtado, would like to see this discus­sion take place objectively in The Observer.

January is drawing to a close, creeping towards what some fans have awaited for nearly a year: Super Bowl XLIII is about to go down in the history books on Sunday. Many 
have gone Patrick Griffin 
before and 
attained the 

Scene & Heard
glory that some strive for their entire careers. There have been plenty of surprise end­ings, unexpected follies, and tear­jerking conclusions in past Super Bowls. This year's championship game, however, boasts a lineup that may be considered the best yet -a true display of American spirit and culture. 
Oh yeah, there will be a football game too. 
In recent years, the buzz sur­rounding Super Bowl halftime shows has enveloped the nation with anticipation that rivals the game itself. The NFL champi­onship event has blossomed from more than just a football game into an entire cultural event and an American pseudo-holiday. 
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band were selected to per­form for Super Bowl XLIII earlier in the season. Before previewing The Boss's highly anticipated 
success Super Bowl party is all about the pre-gaming. By planning your party to watch the game before Sunday morning, you can make sure to have a 
great Super Martha Karam Bowl, no mat­ter who wins. 
Scene & Heard
First step? Regardless of whether or not you're throwing or attending a party, you better know who is playing this year. It is the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Arizona Cardinals. 
Now, use this checklist to make sure that when you and your friends watch the Super Bowl it is not just a watch, it is a party. 
1. Chose your guest list wisely. If you know one of your friends thinks sport watching is serious business, try not to invite him if uses the couch as a trampoline at every touchdown. If your best friend is die-hard football fan from Arizona, your outspoken boyfriend from Pittsburgh should stay with performance, let's reminiscD a grip on Super Bowl performances in recent memory. 
2002: Irish rockers and humanitarians Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr., a.k.a U2, produced one of the most emotional musical perform­ances of all, taking place only months after the September 11th terrorist attacks on the Wor-ld Trade Center and the Pentagon. The stage on which U2 per­formed was shaped like a heart and flanked by a giant banner displaying the names of the near­ly 3,000 citizens who were vic­tims of the attacks. 
2004: Who can ever forget the infamous and controversial "Nipplegate" of Super Bowl XXXVIII? Though the halftime show featured six prolific per­forming artists (Jessica Simpson, Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, Nelly, P. Diddy and Kid Rock) and the University of Houston and Texas Southern marching bands, the entire pres­entation pales in comparison to the final seconds of the perform­ance. In a pre-rehearsed conclu­sion to Timberlake's "Hock Your Body," a piece of Jackson's cloth­ing was torn off, but the wardrobe malfunctioned, reveal­ing her exposed breast. The lewd stunt generated uproar among thP American public, heavy fines levied by the FCC, and tighter regulation regarding broadcast­ing delays and cnnsorship. 
2005: Former Beatie Paul McCartney brought excitement to the Super Bowl c-rowd with a set list including the hits "Drive My Car," "Get Back," "Live and Let Die" and "Hey Jude" as the audi­ence joined in for a collaborative finale. 
2006: During the 2006 Super Bowl, the Rolling Stones earned onn of the largest television view­ing audiences in history, drawing 
89.9 million viewHrs. That total was more than the Oscars, Grammys and Emmy Awards combined. The Stones played "Start Me Up," "Hough Justice'~ and "Satisfaction" on a custom stage (the largest in Super Bowl history) in the form of their sig­nature tongue logo. 
2007: Despite a heavy down­pour in Miami, Prince lit up Dolphin Stadium at Super Bowl XLI performing a nonstop 12­minute medley. The performance included several sweeping guitar solos and was performed on a stage in the form of Prince's logo. 
2008: Tom Petty & the Heart 

game. your option 
2. 
Find, or make, a comfortable place to watch the game. It may be difficult to find a section lounge or 24-hour space that is free to watch the game, so make your own place. Most dorm rooms can hold you and a few of your friends cmn­fortably as long as you rearrange your room. Even if for the duration of the game you cannot get into your bed, desk, sink or dresser, if it means fitting your friends-com­fortably, by all means stack, push and crunch your bulk together to get a common-room feel in your double. Also set up a trash bag in a central location in your room to make the clean up easier. 

3. 
Feast and drink well. Though a dorm kitchen and the section microwave are probably not capa­ble of making Super Bowl snacks up to your standards, they both can come dose. The food you chose to be at your Super Bowl party needs to be inexpensive, easy and as mess-free as possible. A traditional option is mini-wee­


because their only requirements are toothpicks and a microwave. Another dorm option that is often featured at weeknight events is a chip and dip tray. The Huddle sells several different ready-to-eat dips and tortilla chips. If all else fails and you have nothing by Sunday, picking up buffalo wings from Buffalo Wild Wings or Wings Etc. passes as authentic Super Bowl food, not procrastination. When choosing beverage, cater to your guest9 with sugar-fee options and cups for water. 
Buy more napkins than you think is necessary and miniature plates to keep everything tidy and limit 
· your post-game clean up. 
4. Set your TiVo. Most college studeHts cannot afford to have a digital video recorder and skipping commereials during the Super Bowl is sacrilege, but this year's game promises to be as memo­rable as years past. With con­firmed guests such as Jennifer Hudson. Bruee Springsteen and Breakers performed on a stage 
shaped like a heart pierced by a 
Flying V guitar. Petty's set includ­
ed "American Girl," "I Won't 
Back Down," "Free Falling" and 
"Bunning Down a Dream." 
So, what will Bruce "The Boss" Springsteen and his E Street Band offer on this Super Bowl Sunday? What shape will his stage take? Will he avoid a derailing wardrobe malfunction? Following a string of creative and memorable performances, expec­tations are high for an innovative · performance. Fresh off of the release of his new album "Working on a Dream," Springsteen will have plenty of new material to choose from. However, one would assume that he will surely include some of his classic hits that some regard as timeless and legendary anthems. Tune in Sunday night to witness Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band go down jn Super Bowl halftime show history.

Contact Patrick Griffin at pgriffi3®nd. edu@nd. edu 
even after this Sunday the game can provide long lasting entertain­ment as memorable as the infa­mous wardrobe malfunction. 
5. As a host, stay neutral. Try not to make your guests uncomfort­
able by covering your door in Steelers or Cardinals gear or by attacking your opposing team. It will make your guests wish they had gone to the party down the hall. 
The key to having fun at any Super Bowl game is to find out what you love about the game and go with it. Whether you're having the party fur the food, friends, or just a study break, stick with these guidelines and you'll hav.e a good time.

With Super. Bowl XLIII quickly approaching, football fever is mounting. Of course, for Pittsburgh fans, football 
Josef Kuhn

fever is more like multidrug­
resistant 
Scene & Heard
typhoid. Few 
teams boast a tradition as long-and strong as the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
I cannot attest to the vivacity of the Cardinals' fan base, but as a Pittsburgh resident I feel that it is my duty to impart to the masses a little bit of Steelers fan culture in preparation for the Super Bowl. 
The Pittsburgh Steelers, estab­lished in 1933, are the oldest fran­chise in the AFC. They are one of only three teams in the NFL to have won five Super Bowls, and this year they will have the chance to become the first team ever to win six. In the 2005 season, the Steelers were the first No. 6-seed­ed team in NFL history to go to a conference championship. As if that wasn't enough, they won the game and then went on to win Super Bowl XL. 
The team included quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, Super Bowl MVP receiver Hines Ward, and leg­endary running back Jerome "The Bus Bettis. was only in his second professional season when he became the 
youngest quarterback ever to win 
a Super Bowl. 
Despite this impressive offensive lineup, the cornerstone of the Steelers has traditionally been their defense. During their 1970s dynasty, when they won four Super Bowls in six consecutive years, the Steelers' famous defen­sive line earned the nickname "the Steel Curtain." This moniker stuck and eventually came to designate the whole defensive squad. The current team is no exception to the rule, having the No. 1 defense in the NFL. 
But their fans make them spe­cial. 
In 2008, ESPN.com ranked Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL based on their "unbelievable" sellout streak -they have sold out every home game since 1972. Both the Steelers and the Pittsburgh Pirates used to play at Three Rivers Stadium, named for the three rivers that converge in the center of the city. However, Three Rivers was demolished in 2001 and the Steelers now play at the beautiful Heinz Field. Named for the famous condiment company based in Pittsburgh, the stadium features Homer Simpson-yellow seats and an open end that looks out onto .the rivers and the Pittsburgh skyline. The 96-foot JumboTron is crowned by two giant light-up ketchup bottles that tilt and pour red ooze down the screen whenever the Steelers score. 
Another fixture of the Steelers franchise is the Terrible Towel. 
It was conceived in 197 5 by Myron Cope, the legendary broad­caster who used to announce Steelers games on the radio. The Terrible Towel is a simple device, consisting of a school-bus yellow towel with "Terrible Towel" print­ed on it in black lettering, but when 65,050 of these towels are gathered together, the results can be deadly for the opposing team. 
Just think of the loudest noise you've ever heard, multiply that by ten, and combine it with a verita­ble ocean of whirling yellow cloth -that's what the Steelers are . greeted by every time they take the field. And who could talk about Heinz Field without reference to the food? Primanti Brothers, a local restaurant chain, has stands throughout the stadium. Their sandwiches are· a Pittsburgh tradi­tion, consisting of your choice of meat, cheese, tomato, coleslaw, and French fries, all between two 
pieces of Italian bread. 
According to legend, the Primanti Brothers sandwich was invented back in Pittsburgh's steel mill days. Mill workers ("steel­ers"-that's where the name comes from) would come into the restaurant for lunch, but they did­n't have enough time to sit down and eat with proper utensils. Instead, the cooks put the side dishes right on the sandwiches for them, so they could take it to go and eat with their hands. It may sound gross, but so does peanut butter to most Europeans.  
All of this is only basic knowl­edge to your average Steelers fans. There is much more I could tell you, but this should be enough to give you an idea of what this team means to thousands of people across the nation. At least when you're watching the Super Bowl you'll know what all those yellow things are flying through the air.

PHILADELPHIA ....,.... A Philadelphia man shot with a gun owned by Colts receiver Marvin I Iarrison is headed to trial Wednesday, accused of lying to police. 
Dwight Dixon is scheduled to appear in a Philadelphia municipal court on a charge of making false sworn state­ments. 
Dixon initially told police he was shot during a rob­bery but later accused Harrison of shooting him. Dixon's attorney, Robert Gamburg, said Dixon did not immediately identify Harrison because he was afraid of him. 
Gamburg added Dixon 

was denied access to his attorney after being shot and spoke under duress. 
''I'm shocked that the DA is going forward with it," Gamburg said. 
The Philadelphia District Attorney's office declined to comment Tuesday, and calls to Harrison's attorney, Jerome Brown, were not immediately returned. 
The shooting last April happened near a North Philadelphia car wash owned by the All-Pro receiv­er that is about a half mile from Playmakers, a bar he also owns. 
Accor-ding to an arrest report dated April 30, 2008, Dixon was interviewed by police officers at ar hospital after being shot and identi­fied himself as Malik Tucker. Dixon told police he had been robbed by two men and was shot during a strug­gle for a gun, the report said. Dixon later told other officers his real name and signed conflicting statements about where and how he was shot. 
Joseph Santiguida, an attorney who represented Dixon in a previous criminal matter, said he went to the hospital immediately after Dixon called and said he'd been shot. 
"I walk into his room and Dwight whispers to me, 'Marvin Harrison shot me,"' said Santiguida, who will tes­tifY as a witness Wednesday. "He didn't know what to do. 
He was worried about saying anything because of retribu­tion if word got out and peo­ple thought he was a rat. It's a street thing." 
When detectives entered the room to interview Dixon, Santiguida said he told police that Dixon did not want to talk. 
Santiguida said he and the officers got into an argu­ment, that police had hospi­tal personnel order him to leave and then questioned Dixon. 
The 32-year-old Dixon said he sustained "serious and permanent injuries" to his arm and body and a "severe shock" to his nervous system and filed suit last September against HarrL<>on. 
IN BRIEF 

A.C. Milan negotiates to 
resign Beckham after loan 
MILAN, Italy-AC Milan plans to meet with David Beckham's agents to see if the former England captain can get out of his contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy and stay with the Serle A club. 
"If Beckham reaches an agreement with the Galaxy, we are prepared to pay a fee," Milan vice president Adriano Galliani said Tuesday. ''We will meet with his representatives in the next few days." 
Beckham is on a two-month loan from the Galaxy and is due to return to Major League Soccer on March 9. 
The former Manchester United and Real Madrid player scored his first goal for Milan in Sunday's 4-1 victory over Bologna. 
"If he decides to free himself and wants to (stay), we will welcome him with open arms, but he belongs to another club and we've got to thank them because they were very kind with us," Galliani said, according to the Gazzetta dello Sport Web site. 
Rex Sox set deadline for 
resigning catcher Varitek BOSTON -The Boston Red Sox have given catcher Jason Varitek until Friday to accept or reject a one-year, $5 million contract offer with options for 2010. A person familiar with the nego­tiations said Tuesday the Red Sox, who begin spring training on Feb. 12, want an answer by Friday. The person disclosed the deadline and details of the offer on condition of anonymity because the team does not pub­licly discuss negotiations. The Boston Herald and Boston Globe reported earlier the offer was $5 million for 2009 with player and club options for 2010. Varitek, who turns 37 on April 11, is coming off the worst of his 11 seasons with the Red Sox. In 131 games, he hit .220 with 13 homers and 43 RBis. 
Former All-Star Casey to 
retire after 12 seasons CINCINNATI -During his 12· year career, Sean Casey's most endearing trait became his most enduring. Fellow major leaguers dubbed him "The Mayor" because he seemed to know everyone he met. He chatted up runners at first base, making the game's luminaries smile by respectfully calling them "Mr." before offer­ing a compliment. When he retired on Tuesday to move into broadcasting -a career that fits his gift for gab ­the 34-year-old Casey remained proud of his reputation as base­ball'~r Mr. Congeniality. "It means a lot to me if I'm looked at as a good guy in the game and a pretty good player," said Casey, who is joining the fledgling MLB Network as a stu­dio analyst. "It's a nice combina­tion."

NFL 
James has unique way of keeping his edge 
Associated Press 
TAMPA, Fla. -What to 
make of an NFL running back who looks fitter the longer his career stretches out and fresh­er the more hits he absorbs? 
Consider "The Curious Case of Edgerrin James." 
One look at the Arizona Cardinals' 30-year-old running back, on paper or in person, would make you think he has a nutritionist whipping up every meal, a personal trainer follow­ing him around and a team of health professionals on 24-hour call. Not even close. 
James boasts the same lean, sculpted muscles, gaudy stats and durability that were the hallmarks of many of pro foot­ball's best all-purpose backs. But the story of how he came by those things -and how 'The Edge' stays razor-sharp a decade after leaving college early and winning the rushing title in his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts -does not include the usual cast of char­acters. 
·More often than not, James' offseason workout partners in the Miami area are crack­heads. He makes no bones or excuses about it. James grew up in Immokalee, a town of 20,000 some three hours south of where the Super Bowl will be played Sunday, in a family with several addicts. He spent backbreaking summers work­ing alongside several more, harvesting watermelons at $20 a truckload. 
James said a few years ago that's why, when he showed up at the University of Miami to begin his college career, "I was hardened in every way." Besides, when you do your best conditioning work at 3 a.m., as he has been doing ever since college, pickings can be slim. 
"You find some interesting people at that hour," James said, "and they're plenty happy for the chance to make a few bucks." 
Running with crackheads? Makes sense, maybe. Having them spot you while bench­pressing a 400-pound barbell? Not so much. 
But James laughed off the idea that could be dangerous. "Everybody knows me because I'm around so much. .. . Racking weights, spotting me, doing the things I need is not a problem." 
Neither, apparently is finding a meal at that hour. 
Toward the end of his appearance at media day, a reporter from a children's TV network asked James to list what comprised his own nutri­tional game-day breakfast as a way of getting viewers off to a healthy start each morning. 
"Uhhh, I don't eat breakfast," he began. But trying to be help­ful, James added a moment later, "But I like to have a nice late-night meal." 
That erratic schedule, cou­pled with all the punishment a feature back like James takes, is hardly the only reason many people doubted he'd last this long. More than a few thought James was done when he left the Colts the.season before they won the Super Bowl. And his critics note he was so lightly used in the second half of the season, being benched after losing the starting job to rookie Tim Hightower, that James' resurgence in the regular-sea­son finale against Seattle, and in playoff wins over Charlotte and Philadelphia, should have come as no surprise. 
What all of them underesti­mated was his desire. 
Because of his contributions over seven seasons in Indianapolis, the Colts sent him a Super Bowl ring after their win in 2006. He accepted it gratefully, but would rather have one he earned on his own. 
"You've tried to put yourself in a position to be in games like this, and it didn't happen. It's not that I didn't do something, or that I didn't work hard

God suddenly in vogue with football players 
No longer just Warner, Cardinals and Steelers players alike profess their faith ahead of Sunday's big game 
Associated Press 
TAMPA, Fla. -Arizona 
running back Tim Hightower 
had just finished a thought­
ful explanation of his reli­
gious beliefs when one of the 
media types who found their 
way into the Super Bowl sta­
dium Tuesday decided he 
needed more proof. 
"Can you pray right now?" 
he asked. 
"I can pray that whatever 
is going on in your life right 
now that you find God," 
Hightower said. 
Hightower handled the 
question with the same ease 
he handled would-be tack­
lers to score the winning 
touchdown that got his team 
into the Super Bowl, which 
by itself was somewhat sur­
prising since he is a rookie · 
on the 'biggest stage of his 
young life. 
Even more surprising at 
this Super Bowl, though, is 
how so many players on both 
teams aren't hesitating to 
invoke the name of God as 
they prepare to play a vio­
lent game where there will 
be no mercy shown on either 
side. 
Usually that has writers 
setting down their pens and 
cameramen hitting the pause 
button until talk returns to 
the game itself. 
But the depth of convic­
tions from evangelical 
Cardinals quarterback Kurt 
Warner to the Steelers who 
will do their best to plant 
him face-first into .the 
ground on Sunday has put 
religion squarely in play this 
week. All of a sudden the G­
word is in vogue. 
"You just have to embrace 
it, whatever God does in 
your life and wherever he 
puts you," Warner said in 
one of his many religious 
references since landing in 
Tampa. "If it means being a 
role model in this game, I'm 
happy to do that. You are 
excited about that opportu­
nity because you get the 
chance to speak to millions 
of people and, hopefully, 
we'll get· an opportunity to 
impact some lives this 
week." 
Warner is the most·vocal ­and visible -Christian on the Cardinals, proclaiming his faith at every opportunity and underscoring it by car­.rying a Bible with him almost everywhere he goes. He had it with him at the postgame press conference after Arizona upset Philadelphia to reach the Super Bowl, and took time to credit his faith in God for the win before answering any 
other questions. 
The 3 7 -year-old Warner's 
public display of faith has 
left an impression on his 
younger teammates, about 
20 of whom join him in Bible 
studies after prabice every 
Wednesday during the sea­
son. 
"Our quarterback is a defi­
nite leader and devout 
Christian," cornerback 
Roderick Hood said. "I think 
that has spearhe a·de d our 
growth. Also, guys see the 
peace we have on the field 
and want to find that them­
selves."

Nash's hat tricks propels Blue Jackets past Wings 
Sabres crack double­digits in rout ofOilers 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -Rick Nash has been through all the bad times with the Columbus Blue Jackets. No one is enjoying the good times more. 
Nash's third goal of the game came on a rebound 3:27 into 
-overtime and gave the Blue Jackets a 3-2 victory over the Detroit Red Wings on Tuesday night. The win kept the surprising Blue Jackets in the thick of the race for their first playoff berth. 
"All the moments have felt real," Nash said after bumping up his scoring total to 22 goals. "We've been on 10-game losing streaks. They've felt pretty real too. This is a lot better." 
Nash's goals came short-hand­ed, on the power play and, finally, even strength. 
"He, more than anyone, recog­nizes the opportunity in front of us and he sent the other players a clear message," Columbus coach Ken Hitchcock said. "He wants to finish the job and make a run for this thing .... Rick's able to start at a high pace and others are able to tag along. And that's what leaders are able to do." 
The Red Wings were without stars Nicklas Lidstrom and Pavel Datsyuk, who were forced by the NHL to sit out their first game back after the break for not fulfill­ing their obligations at the All­Star Game. Henrik Zetterberg didn't play after the second peri­od because of back spasms. 
In the overtime, Nash carried the puck into the zone before passing to Fedor Tyutin who tossed a centering pass through the crease to fellow defenseman Mike Commodore. But Commodore could only kick at the puck with his skate and never got a stick on it. It bounced to the right corner of the goal cage

where Nash was waiting to jam it in. . 
"It's special. Everything kind of came together against on'tl of the best teams in the league," Nash said. "To win it in overtime, sud­den death, it ~as definitely one of the more special goals I've scored." 
It was the former NHL goal­scoring leader's third career hat trick. 
"Well, he's awesome, Commodore said of Nash. "He's a special player. To be his size and with his hands, to be able to pro­tect the puck and turn and make plays -I wish I had a quarter of his talent." 
Marian Hossa and Brett Lebda had Detroit's goals. 
Commodore fmished with two assists for the Blue Jackets, who were returning home after play­ing nine of 12 on the road. Now they play 15 of their next 24 at home where they are 14-7-1, including winning four of the last five and nine of 11. 
Down 1-0 and 2-1, the Blue Jackets pulled even twice in the second period. 
The Red Wings were on the power play when Nash got a stick on Derek Meech's pass for Brian Rafalski near the blue line. Nash beat them to the puck and skated in on goaltender Chris Osgood, beating him through the leg pads for the short-handed goal. 
"He's a good hockey player. It's kind of like Pav and Z, your best player has got to be your best player. That's why you pay them all the money. If they're not your best players, you don't win," Detroit coach Mike Babcock said. "I don't think anybody's sur­prised. Everyone knows Nash is a real good player." 
Just 29 S!JConds later, the Wings counterpunched. The Blue Jackets failed to clear the puck and Lebda made them pay for it when his hard slap shot from the point got past Columbus goal­tender Steve Mason, who finished with 21 saves. 
Hossa then was called for hook­ing Nash. The Blue Jackets, last in the league on the power play, wasted little time with Nash tak­ing a pass from Kristian Huselius and, from a hard angle, firing a shot that deflected ofT Rafalski's stick and popped behind Osgood and into the net to tie it at 2-all. 
On the power play, Zetterberg passed to Niklas Kronwall for a one-timer from the point in the opening period. The shot was right of the goal cage but took a big bounce off the back boards ­directly to Hossa who was at the right doorstep. He jammed it in for his 23rd ofthe year. 
Mason has had a huge year in goal for the Blue Jackets, helping to transform a bad team into a contender. But he said it's been a treat just to be around Nash, the club's captain. 
"He's a world-class player," Mason said. "It's pretty fun watching him every single night, seeing some of the things he does. Tonight was just like any other night for him." 
Sabres 10, Oilers 2 
Drew Stafford scored his first of three goals 10 seconds into the Buffalo Sabres' rout of Edmonton on Tuesday night, the Oilers worst home loss. 
Thomas Vanek and Derek Roy had a goal and two assists apiece for the Sabres, who also got goals from Nathan Paetsch, Jochen Hecht, Jaroslav Spacek and Tim Connolly with a pair. 
Buffalo (25-18-5) has won four of five and eight of 11 games. 
Erik Cole and Robert Nilsson tallied for the Oilers, who snapped a three-game winning streak. The loss on home ice eclipsed a 9-2 defeat to Chicago earlier this season. 
Edmonton had a disastrous start to the game as a mix-up between Lubomir Visnovsk.y and Ales Hemsk.y led to a goal just 10 seconds in. Vanek picked up the errant puck and fed Stafford who beat Oilers starter Dwayne Roloson for his lOth of the sea­son. 
Stafford made it a nine-goal game with two goals just 1:18 apart midway through the third to record the hat trick. 
Just 1:01 after Stafford started the scoring, Clarke MacArthur swung around from the back of the net and fed the puck to a pinching Paetsch for his first of the season. 
The Sabres took a three-goal lead midway through the first on a goal sent in through Roloson's legs by Roy for his 19th. Roloson was replaced with rookie backup Jeff Drouin-Deslauriers after allowing three goals on eight shots.

Calvin set to host Belles 
By ALEX WEST Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's will face the toughest test of its current four-game road trip when the Belles travel to play Calvin today. _ 
The Belles (10-7) will try to improve to 3-0 on their. cur­rent road trip and, more importantly, keep their lead in the MIAA standings over Satun;l.ay's opponent Hope College. 
To do that, the Belles must focus on beating Calvin {10-6), the MIAA's fourth-place team. 
Behrens 
continued from page 24 
"High school swimming in Indiana was a big deal," Behrens said. "It got me where I am today." 
Currently, Behrens is com­peting in three different events, the 50-free (23.81). the 100­back (55.61) and the 200-back (2:01.66). All three of her sea­sonal best times were reached at the Ohio State Invitational on Dec. 5-7. 
''I've always loved the back­stroke, maybe because I get to breathe as much as I want," Behrens said. "I like the 50­free because it's short and sweet." 
With just a few weeks to go before the Big East Championships on Feb. 18, Behrens is ranked third in both the 100-back and 200-back, and tenth for the 50-free in the conference's pre-championship 
"In this league, you can't afford to look past anyone," Belles coach Jennifer Henley said. "We take [it] one game at a time." 
Knights forward Marcia Harris could prove to be a handful for the Belles defense. Harris averages more than 19 points per game with a·.field goal percentage of nearly 60 percent. 
The Knights are also unde­feated (3-0) at home in con­ference play. 
The Belles will be· led by senior forward Erin Newsom, who leads the team in scoring at 14.9 points per game. 
rankings. 
"Even though we are confi­dent, the Big East meet can still be a very nerve-wracking meet, both as an individual and as a team," Behrens said. "Knowing that all the hard work you have put in for the last six months comes down to a few races is very stressful." 
Tough practices and a winter break training trip to the Bahamas have been quite help­ful in preparing the team for the challenge of the champi­onships at the natatorium in Indianayolis, where the team will try for its 13th straight Big East title. 
"We have nine water work­outs a week, plus three weightlifting sessions, and dry­land [workouts] on Saturdays," Behrens said. 
An intense practice schedule -which Behrens said includes nine water work-outs, three weightlifting sessions, and a Saturday dry-land workout. each week -has not only pre­
"We have asked a lot of [Newsom I this season and she has responded," Henley said. 
But Henley also said the team isn't one-dimensional. Saint Mary's has five other players -Nicole Beier (10.6 points per game), Patsy Mahoney (9.4), Maggie Ronan (8.4), Kelley Murphy (7.5) and Anna Kammrath (7 .4) -who average at least seven points per game. 
"[It] can cause some difficul­ty in defending us," Henley said.

pared the team for conference championships, but has also intensified team bonding. 
"[Behrens] really is a team player who knows how to be both competitive and support­ive at the same time," senior Claire Hutchinson said. "She loves tQ. race; she brings that type of mentality to practice with her everyday, and it really elevates the intensity of our training environment." 
Approaching the most impor­tant part of the season, Behrens has a clear plan of preparation for the conclusion of the season_ 
"My biggest challenge for the rest of the season will be fixing the small, technical aspects of my races in time for the Big East Championships," Behrens said. "I've put in the hard work, now I just need to make the right adjustments to make sure my races are perfect."

Rutgers 
continued from page 24 
After playing great defense on the Scarlet Knights' first few possessions, the Rutgers shoot­ers found their stroke and started lighting it up from beyond the arc. Ray got Rutgers on the board first with a pair of 3-pointers from the left corner on back-to-hack possessions. Prince got into the action next by nailing two treys of her own. 
After giving up four free throws early to the Irish, the Scarlet Knights surged to abig first half lead with a 17-point run. 
The Irish did not score their first field goal of the game until the 10:22 mark of the first half when freshman guard Natalie Novosel took a pass from guard Ashley Barlow for the layup. McGraw said she did not think Rutgers was playing particular­ly good defense, and placed the blame on her team for the Jack of offensive output. 
"I thought our shot selection was questionable at times," McGraw said. 
Foul trouble haunted Rutgers during the last nine minutes of the first half, committing 12 fouls and sending the Irish to the line 19 times before half­time. Those fouls helped get the Irish back into the game with a 7-0 run before another pair of Ray 3-pointers stretched the lead back to 23-12. 
In the second half, Rutgers was able to extend its lead steadily throughout the second half in part due to strong defense. Notre Dame also had many quick possessions in the second half, looking for quick baskets to get back in the game_ The team's inability to make shots and rebound kept the Irish out of the game and helped the Scarlet Knights push the lead to 15. 
The lead hovered around 15 points until a controversial play midway through the half. Rutgers guard Khadijah Rushdan nailed a 3-pointer from the right wing as an offi­cial blew a foul away from the ball. The basket and the foul were both called and Prince's two foul shots finished the five­point swing for Rutgers, mak­ing the score 57-39. 
"The rule is that if she's in her motion to shoot the ball, the basket counts. I didn't see the foul," McGraw said of the explanation she received from the Qfficials. "I thought it was very clearly after the whistle ... but her point was that, if she's in her motion to shoot it, then the basket counts, very much like an NBA continuation type of thing." 
For how much the whistles went Notre Dame's way in the first half, they burned the Irish in the second. Numerous times an Irish stop was undone by a defensive foul, sending Rutgers to the charity stripe 15 times in the half. 
One of the bright spots for the Irish in the game was guard Natalie Novosel, who posted 19 points and four rebounds in the loss. 
Only a late hot streak could salvage the score differential, if not the game. The Irish went on a 13-2 run against the Scarlet Knight bench over the last 1:16 to bring the score to a more reasonable finish. 
Notes

The announced atten­dance of 10,082 was the eighth largest crowd in school history. The Irish have had six sellouts.

The Irish honored area blood donors during the game, and especially Chuck Weber, who donated 54 gallons of blood, the most in St. Joseph County.

Rutgers dominates as Irish 'D'falters again

Rutgers guard Brittany Ray had 26 points -including a 4­for-6 performance from beyond the arc -and the rest of the Scarlet Knights helped her upend Notre Dame 78-68 Tuesday night at the Joyce Center. 
Ray was not the qnly Scarlet Knight to have a great offen­sive game against the Irish. Epiphanny Prince, who led the team going into Tuesday's game with 20.4 points per game, added 24 points to the Rutgers effort. 
"It was mostly an incredible lack of awareness and effort to know that those [Prince and Ray] were the two ones to guard," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said.

Behrens helps lead ND into Big East stretch run 
By MOLLY SAMMON Sports Writer 
When it came time to pick a college after a heavy recruiting process, the choice was easy for junior Maggie Behrens, who currently holds the team's sea­sonal best times in both the 100-and 200-metor backstroke events. 
"I've always been a big Notre Dame fan since both of my par­ents went to school here," said Behrens, who hails from north­western Indiana. "I feel in love with the school, the traditions and, most importantly, the team." 
Partially because of her par­
ents' experiences at Notre Dame, Behrens was not caught . off-guard by the school's aca­demic challenges. In fact, they were rriore a selling point than a 
determnt to joining the Irish. 
"I knew I didn't want to com­
promise my education for ath­
letics, and Notre Dame has that 
great balance and is strong in 
both ·areas," Behrens said. "You 
have to learn how to balance 
your time and .make a lot or 
adjustments." 
Behrens credits much of her 
growth in the 'sport to her years 
of practice in high school.
