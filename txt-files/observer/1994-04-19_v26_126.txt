Want violence? Try Wo01en's Bookstore 
Maybe it was the shoes. Maybe it was the ethanol. 
Maybe it was the first warm spring evening. Maybe it was the stench corning from D2. 
Being a naive freshman, I thought Bookstore was about spending an after­noon or evening with your 

friends, pretending to be  Suzy Fry  
the Shaq, Michael Jordan,  Viewpoint Editor  
Larry Bird, or even bas­ 
ketball's equivalent to  
Rudy.  Was I ever wrong.  

Nasty does not even come close. It was pure animal aggression. One would think the women's league would be slightly tamer than the free-for-all rugby-esque Bookstore league, but no such luck. I'll try to provide you a syn­opsis of the game but the confmes of journalism just do not permit me to share the vulgarity of the flapping tongues. 
In the beginning, there were ten girls. As they walked onto the court all traces of femi­ninity were left behind. And they say women wouldn't make good combat soldiers. 
Let me introduce you to my team's center. She has a very special tactic -she screams. And its not just a mere shout. It is a cry from eons past. It is a shriek that would scare the pulse out of any living being. And she lets it rip at the perfect moment, precisely as her oppo­nent takes her shot. It works, she missed every shot. Of course for strategy's sake, our cen­ter's identity will remain anonymous. 
Free tip number two: "Slow it the #!*@ down!" Speed doesn't help in a game when half of you are completely out of shape. Frankly, I have absolutely no business being on these courts; I am not the bionic woman nor do I claim to be anyone remotely close. Mter the first 10 minutes I was looking for an Emergency Medical Technician -those extra sessions on the Stairrnaster didn't exactly help. 
In order to really control the pace of the game, call a time-out when your opponent reaches for a sore shoulder or knee or some­thing, ask her how she's doing, if she'd like some water or something, and catch your breath. That may be low but I'd hate to be the roommate who has to haul you over to the infirmary for resuscitation. 
Thirdly, just keep in mind that the women's league is just as violent, just as dirty, just as cheap, and just as intense as regular Bookstore. Whining gets you nowhere in a game without referees, but calling false fouls certainly does. I must clarify that my team won fair and square. This last tip I learned from our opponents. When this happens, just make a joke of it or eise your entire team might end up in Student Affairs for battery. It is like the Honor Code: if winning the honest way means anything to you, that is how you will do it. 
Though this is my first experience with Bookstore, I think I'm qualified to share in some of its glory. Bookstore takes that win­ning, competitive drive within each of us Dorners and turns it into a four week adrena­line rush, including everything from the antici­patory nerves, name calling . and flying elbows to bloody lips, scraped knees, and aching mus­cles. 
I must thank my comrades in victory for if it wasn't for them I would never have had the opportunity to be doubled-over, gasping for air because, believe it or not, I was drafted.

Roseanne Arnold files for divorce 

LOS ANGELES 
Roseanne Arnold filed for divorce Monday from her husband, Torn, the man with whom she has shared fame, fortune, a television show and a knack for headline-grabbing shenanigans for four years. The filing carne three days after an argument erupted between the Arnolds on the set of ABC's "Roseanne," reportedly over a woman who had taken part with the couple in a mock three-way marriage. Mrs. Arnold, 41, fired Arnold from his job as her show's executive producer, cut up his credit cards and dashed ofT to Europe for a three-month trip without him, a source close to the couple said. The source said Mrs. Arnold also fired Kim Silva, an assistant who had joined in the mock marriage in what the Arnolds had said was a publicity stunt. Irreconcilable dif­ferences were cited in divorce papers filed for Mrs. Arnold in Los Angeles Superior Court. The petition says the couple, married Jan. 20, 1990, officially separated Friday. Mrs. Arnold asks that she not be required to pay alimony. Mrs. Arnold, formerly Roseanne Barr, plans to pick a new last name -a French one, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Police find captives at ANC Office 

JOHANNESBURG, South Mrica 
Four men and a 14-year-old boy who claimed to be members of a Zulu nationalist group were found impris­oned in the basement of an African National Congress office, police said today after freeing the _captives. The five said they were members of the nval lnkat~a Freedom Party, police spokesman Col. Dave Bruce said. He said they apparently had been badly beaten. They were discovered at ANC regional headquarters after one escaped and contacted police, Bruce said. He said one of the captives said he had been held since Saturday. The ANC said today that the incident had nothi_ng to..~o wit? the organization, but was the result of a pnvate mvesti­gation" by a security guard whose car had been broken into. The guard was detained by police late Sunday after being disarmed at the ANC office, Bruc~ s_aid. ~NC regional chairman Tokyo Sexwale told a radiO mterv~ew­er that if an investigation showed any wrongdomg, "heads would roll." 
French dictionary lays down the law 

PARIS 
In its endless guerrilla war against Franglais, the gov­ernment has armed itself with a new dictionary contain­ing 3,500 translations aimed at "user-friendliness." Oops, make that "convivialite." From "airbag" (sac gon­flable) to "zoning" (zonage), the glossy red handbook seeks to counter the ever-wider use of English in busi­ness, sports and science by providing French alterna­tives. It remains to be seen whether the new terms, some long and clumsy, will catch on in a nation struggling with itself over how to be modern, high-tech and cool, yet pre­serve its rich linguistic tradition. The Dictionnaire des Terrnes Officiels has translations mandated by govern­ment ministries since France started fighting Franglais in the early 1970s. This year's edition adds about 100 new terms and has an English-to-French index.

Endowment considered ousting Wood 

INDIANAPOLIS 
Lingering questions about the future of Eli Lilly and Co.'s former chairman and chief executive officer were to be answered today at the annual shareholders' meeting. Richard Wood was up for re-election to the Indianapolis­based pharmaceutical giant's board of directors, and the Lilly Endowment reportedly considered withholdi~g its nearly 48 million votes. The Lilly Endowment, established decades ago by the Lilly family, holds 16.31 percent of all outstanding Lilly shares. Wood would most likely win re­election even if the endowment withheld its votes. Five directors were nominated for re-election, with the top five vote-getters winning board seats. It would, however, be an embarrassingly public split between the endow­ment and Wood, who left the charitable foundation's board Dec. 31, after serving on it for 19 years. Wood also resigned in June as chairman of Indianapolis-based Lil_ly. after leading a very messy board coup that ended with the dismissal of then-CEO Vaughn D. Bryson, Wood's hand-picked successor. 
Lawyer jokes socially based 

NEW YORK 
Lawyer-bashing is a venerable tradition, but this is its Golden Age. Collections of lawyer jokes are available in books, on disks and from on-line computer services. Legal thrillers reside on best-seller lists, and lawyers' misdeeds keep viewers glued to screens. In the pantheon of popular culture, lawyers occupy a niche. Why do they take up space in our psyches? Why do we love-hate them so much? "The qualities you don't like are the same qualities you seek when you're in trouble," says Robert 
R. Butterworth, a Los Angeles-based clinical psychologist. "We want the shark on our side, but we don't want to be swimming with a bunch of them." Robert C. Post, a law professor at Boalt Hall School of Law at the Universit~ of California, says lawyers embody a deeper conflict, between the common good and individual independence.

'New homelessness' due to societal changes 
By MARCY DINIUS 
News Writer 
The problems of the lack of adequate low-cost housing, an increasing trend towards de-in­dustrialization, a misunder­standing of the nature of urban poverty. and stereotypes of the homeless are among the causes of a "new homelessness" in urban America, according to John Coleman, Professor of Religion and Society at the University of California. Berkeley. 
"Homelessness represents a kind of litmus test for under­standing the problems of the urban poor in this rich nation," Coleman said, noting that from an outside perspective, such as Japan or Europe, the lack of "social safety nets," high un­employment, and the increas­ing problem of homelessness are viewed as "scandalous" for a nation that should be able to solve its problems through its wealth. 
Coleman described the new homeless in urban America as mostly young males with a high-school education and as semi-skilled laborers able to join the work force. Also, he emphasized the growing num­bers of women and children among the ranks of the current homeless population in contrast to the traditional stereotype of the old, male "hobo." 
By citing various studies on the problem of homelessness, Coleman also argued against the view of the homeless as mentally-ill transients who have no motivation to find work. Instead, Coleman ar­gued, the majority are men­tally-healthy, long-term resi­dents of their area who have encountered some sort of work or family trauma that has forced them into homelessness. 
Also, Coleman countered the general perception that the homeless are often without shelter or work by choice, ar­guing that many are, in actual-

ity, employed, though their jobs are often of such a low-paying nature that these "working poor" are unable to afford a permanent residence. Instead, they must search for scarce affordable shelter that is rapid­ly disappearing. 
Urging the need for more af­fordable housing, changes in domestic policy to deal with the needs of the homeless, and a breaking down of public stereo­types of homelessness and its causes as necessary steps towards solving the problem of the nation's urban and, often, working poor, Coleman con­cluded by citing the poet Edgar Guest who said, "It takes a heap of living in a house to make it a home." Yet accord­ing to Coleman, "we've had a heap of living in this land," but "we will need a larger morsel of living before this land-this rich nation-and thus the scan­dal of homelessness, becomes a true home for the millions now living on the streets." 
Irish wars fought with paper also 

By ZOE MARIN 
News Writer 
Conditions prior to the 1798 rebellion in Ireland must be examined separately from the texts published afterward if the rebellion is to be accurately un­derstood, said Kevin Whelan in a lecture on "Writing Ireland, Reading England." 
"There was actually two wars fought in Ireland, one with arms and one with paper," said Whelan. 
This war fought with paper consisted of highly opinionated writings aimed to change view­points about the rebellion, he said. Two lines of texts devel­oped after the rebellion repre­senting both conservative and radical stand points. According to Whelan, both sides of these texts are deeply corrupted. 
The first line emerged im­mediately after the war and ex­pressed the primarily conser­vative, Protestant views. These writings were aimed at the mainly Protestant British audi­ence, according to Whelan. 
"Many of these texts saw the rebellion merely as a pope-like plot with tentacles that stretched back to Rome," Whelan said. 
One writing Whelan pointed out from this collection was one written by Sir Richard Musgrave which consisted of some 1000 pages and sold over 3000 copies, which was consid­ered successful for its time. 
"He painted the rebels in the most negative way possible, especially when he talked about Catholics," said Whelan. 
Mainly. the book downplayed the revolution and advised the British not to interfere with the Protestant government and church relationship and espe­cially not the Catholics. 
According to Whelan, the sec­ond group of writings were quite radical in context when compared to the earlier, more conservative texts and general­ly glorified the rebellion. 
Whelan exemplified these writings with a small essay which indulged in the rebellion and argued that Ireland should be free. It also declared that the community had nothing to do with the individual religious beliefs of its members. 
Whelan closed by warning that this sharp division between the two sides· could result in a misleading analysis of the rebellion if the initiatives behind the texts aren't taken into consideration.

Nixon stable after a stroke 
By TIM SULLIVAN 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK 
Former President Richard Nixon, whose accomplishments in a lifetime on the world stage were forever overshadowed by the Watergate scandal that forced him from office, suffered a stroke Monday. 
Nixon, 81, had the stroke at his Park Ridge, N.J., home and was taken by ambulance to New York Hospital-Cornell M.edical Center, where he was listed in stable condition, Nixon spokeswoman Kathy O'Connor said. 
"He's fine," she said. 

Nixon was conscious in in­tensive care and was being treating with blood-thinners, she said. 
Carolyn Migliore, a spokes­woman for the hospital, con­firmed Nixon was there but said she could not give out fur­ther details. 
O'Connor said Nixon was up­stairs getting ready for dinner when he suffered the stroke at 
5:45 p.m. He was able to sum­mon the housekeeper, who called the ambulance, she said. 
In 197 4, Nixon suffered a re­currence of phlebitis, inflam­mation of the veins, and result­ing complications from surgery. He nearly died. 
Nixon's wife, Pat, died last year of lung cancer. 
Nixon was the nation's 37th president. He served in the White House from Jan. 20, 1969, to Aug. 9, 1974, resigning amid the Watergate scandal. He was the only president to resign to avoid impeachment. 
Nixon dropped from the lime­light in his forced retirement but surfaced frequently through extensive travel, books, articles and speeches. He visited Russia last month and caused a stir by meeting with right-wing leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky. 
"I did something in Russia that no one has ever done, something that I have not done in my 10 visits to the Soviet Union," he said last month.

Waters of the controversy over the affair that threatened to rock the boat of the entire United States Navy earlier this year have calmed after several women brought charges 
against  men  at  the  1991  
Tailhook  Association  con­ 
vention in Las Vegas.  

Stories of the women who were allegedly sexually as­saulted and harassed at the convention and at other naval events triggered a widespread criticism of military policies and procedures regarding sexual harassment. 
The Senate Armed Services Committee voted that Admiral Frank Kelso should be retired at a four-star rank, his current full rank, later this month. 
Kelso, the chief of naval op­erations, was accused of lying in February of this year by the judge in the Tailhook scandal, Captain William Vest, when he claimed not to have witnessed any misconduct at the conven­tion. according to an article which appeared in The New York Times. 
In a 20 to 2 vote, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas (the only female member of the panel) and Robert Byrd of West Virginia were defeated. Hutchinson said that Kelso "should be held accountable for the bawdy convention of naval aviators" according to The New York Times article. 
The Senate must approve the retirement ranks of all three and four-star officers, or their ranks will revert to two stars automatically, according to The New York Times. 
"Senator Hutchinson and women's rights groups have said that retiring Kelso with four stars would send the wrong signal to the rest of the Navy that the Senate was not serious about combating sexual harassment and holding com­manders responsible for elimi­nating it." 
The full senate must approve of the retirement and will prob­ably vote in favor of it some time this week according to The New York Times. 
While the implications of the decision on the Navy and na­tional gender relations are po­tentially great, how will the decision affect local ROTC poli­cy and gender relations? 
Notre Dame Navy ROTC com­manding officer, Captain Pattison, said with regard to the Senate decisions, "I am not in a position to criticize or ap­plaud what the United States government decides. It is flat out against the law to criticize Congress or any officials of the government. Members of the military have limits on what they can do. Uniformed people cannot, under Jaws of the United States, say anything against their government." 
Jane Phinney, a former sergeant in the United States Marine Corps and a Notre Dame sophomore Gender Stud­ies student said, "Admiral Kelso personally did not mistreat any women. But he shouldn't be allowed to retire with full bene­fits because of what happened under his command. Being retired before his time, even if it is only a few weeks, is an absolutely dishonorable dis­missal though." 
"It was his responsibility as a leader to know," she said. "Otherwise the military seems to condone what happened in the Tailhook scandal by not punishing the leaders who allowed it to happen." 
Emile Edora, a sophomore engineering major and former ROTC member said, "My dad worked with and will be retir­ing with Admiral Kelso. So knowing him personally, I have a biased opinion on what the Senate should decide. He's a good man and he hasn't been personally implicated in any way. He should be retired at his full rank."

Democrats debate Clinton health plan 
By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell sparked fresh debate among fellow Democrats by suggesting ways to make President Clinton's health care plan less costly. The White House said it wasn't endorsing any compromises ­yet. 
Meanwhile, Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said Monday the House subcommittee he chairs will begin work Thursday on a version that does not include one of the most controversial elements of Clinton's plan -mandatory purchasing alliances. 
Alliances envisioned in the Clinton plan would pool large groups of people to give them purchasing clout in buying health insurance at better prices than they could negotiate individually. 
Clinton press secretary Dee Dee Myers welcomed Mitchell's alternatives to the president's plan as "yet another sign that things are moving along." And Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said Mitchell had "established himself as someone who's going to ram (reform) through the United States Senate." 
But the sponsor of one rival plan was much less en­thusiastic. 
"Mitchell did a real fine job of outlining three different ver­sions of employer mandates," said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., whose plan would avoid forcing any business or individual to buy insurance. "I don't think there's a majority of support for mandates before we move on (other) reforms." 
All of Mitchell's alternatives would retain Clinton's idea of making employers help pay for their workers' coverage. They would lighten the burden by tinkering with the benefit pack­age, the subsidies and the employer share. 
He got help from senior White House advisers in framing his options for less expensive ways to achieve health coverage for all Americans. 
Ira Magaziner, the senior White House adviser who took part in the Democrats' discus­sion at a weekend retreat, said of Mitchell's suggestions, "They were scenarios more than pro­posals. He was using them to get a discussion going." 
As for the House bill drafted by Williams, the Montana con­gressman said states would perform the function of alliances and could do so either by creating mandatory con­sumer purchasing cooperatives, voluntary cooperatives or no cooperatives. 
His proposal would also pro­vide more generous subsidies for all small businesses, with the majority of assistance going to businesses with 25 or fewer workers. 
Unlike the president's plan, which gives companies with more than 5,000 workers the option of forming their own al­liances, Williams would exclude all such businesses from his cooperatives. They would run their own health coverage, but pay a 1 percent payroll tax. 
His proposal also would pro­vide subsidies to low-income workers up to 200 percent of the poverty line instead of 150 percent as in Clinton's plan. 
He said his subcommittee would vote not only on his draft but on a single-payer plan, like the Canadian system, in which the government pays most bills. without copayments for all women of childbearing age 
Williams said that his propos­al would cost $15 billion to $30 billion more than the presi­dent's over five years but that it would be worth it. 
The Democrats spent much of Saturday discussing Clinton's plan and alternatives at a Williamsburg, Va .. retreat. Clinton joined them that evening and urged them to press forward on health reform and other issues. But the presi­dent did not take part in the talk of possible compromise on health reform, an aide said.

SARAJEVO, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Confounded by Bosnian Serb guns they cannot silence, inter­national mediators and U.N. officials said Monday there was nothing they could do for the terrorized Muslim enclave of Gorazde. 
"The town is at their mercy," said the U.N. commander for Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose. "We are on the edge of a major humanitarian catastro­phe." 
While Serb artillery pounded Gorazde and refugees searched for cover, U.N. officials said Serb leaders again promised a cease-fire and the deployment of U.N. troops in the eastern en­clave, home to an estimated 65,000 people. 
A Red Cross convoy and a company of U.N. troops were

Later Monday, U.N.  chief  

Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked NATO to authorize air strikes to protect all the U.N.-designated "safe areas" in Bosnia, a move that would expand U.N. author­ity to call in NATO planes. There was no immediate response from NATO. 
Previous NATO air strikes on Serb positions around Gorazde were called to protect U.N. peacekeepers there, not offi­cially to end the siege. 
Earlier in the day, President Clinton played down the possi­bility of further air attacks on Serb forces around Gorazde and renewed his call for ending a U.N. ban on arms shipments to the Muslim-led government. 
U.N. officials had said there would be little gained by calling in more NATO air strikes because the limited raids over the past week did not blunt the Serb offensive. The only mili­tary officer in Gorazde to guide NATO planes was among seven British officers evacuated at dawn, U.N. officials said. 
Fewer than 10 U.N. observers were left in the besieged enclave. 
U.N. workers in Gorazde reported heavy shelling of the town about 35 miles southeast of Sarajevo, said U.N. spokesman Joe Sills in New York. 
"The defenses have col­lapsed. There are intentional and indiscriminate attacks on civilians," he said. 
U.N. staff said thousands of people were camped in the 

Crash cause may be human error 
By DAVID BRISCOE 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
An Air Force general told Congress Monday that U.S. pilots flying over Iraq are not "cowboys or trigger-happy," but he said human failure may have led to the downing of two 
U.S. helicopters over Iraq by American jets. 
Maj. Gen. Larry L. Henry, act­ing deputy chief of staff for plans and operations, said a series of events led to the shootdown by two F-15 fighter planes that killed 26 people streets because they lacked shelter. 
"People are trying to hide in every conceivable safe place, obviously to no avail," said Ron Redmond of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. "People are literally exposed to any shelling, sniper fire, machine-gun fire .... People are terrified." 
Shells fell at a rate of one every 20 seconds during the morning, but slowed to one a minute by midafternoon, said Redmond. 
The few U.N. workers in Gorazde reported artillery shells hit the town's hospital, a refugee center and the Red Cross building. 
Bosnian Serb forces said they had taken over most of the Gorazde enclave, apart from the center of town and a stretch of 4 to 5 miles along the north­ern bank of the Drina. 
Russia's special envoy, Vitaly 
Thursday, "but in the end we had a breakdown of visual identification." 
"We may fmd that we simply had a human failure," Henry said. 
At the same time, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., lashed out at House Deputy Minority Leader Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., for sug­gesting the incident in which 26 people were killed was due to military budget cuts. 
Levin called Gingrich's sug­gestion irresponsible, and ser­vice representatives at a Senate hearing agreed there was no evidence to support such a con­clusion. 
Asked about the stressful environment under which U.S. forces were operating in pro­tecting Kurdish civilians in the "no-fly zone·· over northern Iraq, Henry said any area where pilots are watching out for enemy planes over a long period of time would be a haz­ardous area. 
"I don't think anybody gets lax over there," he said. "We're Churkin, lashed out at Serb leaders after a weekend of try­ing to negotiate a halt to the fighting, saying he had never heard so many broken promis­es. 

He told reporters in Zagreb, Croatia that his government should break ofT talks with the Serbs, despite their cultural and religious ties with Russia. 
The European Union nations sought a meeting with the United States, Russia and the United Nations to produce a coordinated diplomatic effort like the ultimatum that forced Serbs to pull artillery away from Sarajevo in February. 
Hampered by that muddled sense of purpose and lack of will, the United Nations did lit­tle but express outrage at the Serb attacks on Gorazde, one of six "safe areas" declared by the Security Council a year ago. That was not enough for Gorazde residents. 
not dealing with cowboys or trigger-happy people." 
Henry appeared with officers from the Army, Navy and Marine Corps at a Senate Armed Services committee hearing to assess the lessons of the Persian Gulf War. 
In that war, 35 U.S. soldiers were killed by "friendly fire" and 72 injured. But Henry said there were no incidents of U.S. planes firing at friendly air­craft. 
Glenn said that likely was because after only a few days of the war, no Iraqi aircraft were flying, and pilots could assume that any plane they saw was friendly. 
There were also no such inci­dents in the Vietnam War, he said. 
Henry said pilots are given extensive training in identifying aircraft and frequently tested on whether they can recognize the silhouettes of a variety of fixed-wing planes and heli­copters.

KHAN YUNIS, 
Occupied Gaza Strip 

Tired of crowding with his wife and six children into a room the size of a parking space, Ibrahim Abu Mustafa made a grab for prime real estate when the Israel army started pulling back . 
"There is chaos now, so I thought it would be a good time to build," he said. "There is no authority to stop me." 
But when he tried to build a house on the crest of a sand dune overlooking the Mediterranean, the Israeli army twice knocked down the foundation. 
Although the building site was on the ragged edge of the Palestinian refugee camp, the dune also overlooks two Israeli army posts, so the military apparently revised its hands-off

policy and stopped the con­struction. 
This power vacuum in the Gaza Strip leaves Palestinians like Abu Mustafa in limbo between Israel's diminishing vigilance and the arrival of Palestinian authority. 
Rival factions with guns are trying to control their pieces of Gaza and residents fear chaos and perhaps civil war. 
"We don't have 100 percent control. Anyone who tells you they have 100 percent control is lying," said Hisham Abdel­Rizzak, released last fall from two decades in Israeli prisons and now heading the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Gaza. 
The head of the secretive Israeli security agency, Shin Bet, told Sunday's Cabinet meeting that chaos and mas­sacres among the Palestinians would accompany autonomy, reported the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. 
~pusPhone: (219)277-6780 EMAIL: Ryan.N.Roberts.8@nd.edu 
The Palestinians concede dif­ficulties. Arafat's popularity sinks as each day slips past the April 13 deadline when autono­my was supposed to begin. His reluctance to delegate real authority hasn't helped. 
"If Arafat parachuted in today, he himself could not solve the problems we face," said Abdel-Rizzak. 
The PLO office is flooded daily with residents seeking help with everything from land dis­putes to finding jobs to paying hospital bills for sons wounded in gun battles. 
"Sometimes I wish I could go back (to prison) for a little time so I would not see all this," sighs Abdel-Rizzak. 
Every morning brings a new report of a gunfight somewhere in the Gaza Strip or elsewhere in the occupied territories between rival groups of Fatah members trying to assert authority.

Q f SUStaina I I y 

International tourism is toutedl-------...j as the gold mine of the 21st cen­tury. It has become the largest industry in the world, surpass­ing trade in oil and arms. Today tourism involves some 500 mil­lion visitors spending $300 bil­lion and supporting over 100 million jobs. It accounts for nearly 10 percent of world trade. 
In developing countries, ---------! tourism is even more significant. In the Caribbean region, it represents a third of all trade, a fourth o foreign exchange earnings, and a fifth of jobs. In the smaller well-known destinations like Aruba, Bahamas, Bermuda and the Virgins, it is the lead industry as cruise ships, hotels, marinas and taxis dominate the island landscape. 
In fact, high-density mass tourism has become so successful that destinations across the Caribbean, Mediterranean and Pacific are losing their appeal. This is evident from the slowdown in tourist growth that characterizes these areas, from the declines in repeat visitors and the average length of visitor stay, and from increases in crowding, pollution, and the substitution of man-made attractions (gambling, shopping) for lost natural assets. 
It is also evident from the rising demand for more pristine natural, cultural and educational vacations. This so-called "ecotourism" focuses on small-scale authentic natural and cultural experiences. It involves a variety of forms like visiting rainforests, bird watching, participating in archeological digs, witnessing village ceremonials, trekking, rafting and other types of adventure tourism. 
In this age of environmental awareness, the allure of ecotourism is the assumption that it will provide a sustainable alternative to mass tourism, whose economic benefits are overshadowed by destructive cultural and environmental intrusions. The belief is that these new "softer" low-density tourism forms will generate nearly the same economic benefits without the cultural and ecological costs. Evidence from rare natural and historical sites around the world does not support this claim. 
In Rwanda's "Pare National des Vulcans" made famous by Diane Fossey's "Gorillas in the Mist," increasing visitors have disrupted gorilla breeding patterns fostering miscarriages. In Malaysia, tourists witnessing the egg-laying of giant leatherback turtles, riding their backs and pulling their flippers, are partly responsible for drastic de­clines in turtle beach arrivals. In Kenya, sometimes 50 vans surround a pride of lions, and the destruc­tion caused by their tracks and exhaust is forcing cheetahs to migrate. 
Too many daily tourists climbing inside Egyptian pyramids are raising humidity levels and dislodging the paint of ancient artists. In the Alps, complex roadways and facilities to accommodate skiers have caused the loss of over half the endemic species in the heavily used North and Western regions. The trekking.boom in Nepal has lowered the tree line in the Annapurna Himalayan region several hundred feet to provide cooking fuel and warm bathing water for back-packers. 
Such evidence indicates ecotourism may be no panacea. Attractive assets inevitably become "suc­cessful." Creeping commercialization spawns rising visitor densities, environmental decline and socio­cultural change. The lesson is a curious one: to pre­serve the pristine, we must borrow from the arti­ficial. Unless visitor numbers and behavior are strictly controlled, and assets daily maintained a Ia Disney World, the untrammeled market will cumulatively destroy much of our celebrated natur­al and cultural patrimony.

By LYNN BAUWENS 
Assistant Accent Editor 
Tim O'Neill became known as a player of memories-Notre Dame's own piano man. He 
will say good­bye to the campus in his final concert during AnTostal. O'Neill began playing at Notre Dame 


for the Tim O'Neill Keenan Revue his freshman year. While he studied abroad in Innsbruck his sophomore year, he has contin­ued at the Revue becoming one of the most popular acts. This year his performance with his brother earned a standing ova­tion. 
Musical talent seems to run in the family and comes naturally to O'Neill. 
"Everyone in my family plays," he said. "I only took piano lessons through the eighth grade, but other than that I just played around doing my own thing." 
O'Neill has be~ome known on campus as the Piano Man' for his renditions of Billy Joel tunes. 
"I do not know how that hap­pened. I just started playing a few songs by Billy Joel. People liked it and he is in my voice range," he explained. 
While he has enjoyed his suc­cess playing Billy Joel songs for audiences at Notre Dame, he has found that it has limited his performance of originals. 
"I do write a lot, but I feel that now I am in a cage," he said. "I want to get out of the cage and 
During his final performance this year, O'Neill will be joined on stage by Mike McGlinn on guitar, Kevin Fleming on drums, Tony Garza on saxo­phone and John Sebastian on guitar. O'Neill and McGlinn recently went into the record­ing studio to record original songs, some of which they will be performing Wednesday evening. 
They will begin at 9:30 p.m. on the stage near Stonehenge. In case of rain, they will be per­forming in the Loft. 
write my own stuff-be original." 
O'Neill's best moment occurred while he was studying abroad his sophomore year. 
"I was in Lourdes, France, traveling by myself and I had to find somewhere to stay-every place was full," he said. "I couldn't speak any French and I had no French francs." 
The situation did not look promising, but O'Neill entered a small inn with a piano in the lobby. The owner said that he might have one bed available. 
"I started playing the piano. Then the owner came over and started giving me free coffee and then beer," he shared. "Even though I couldn't speak the French language and he could speak little English, we could still communicate through the language of music." 
This experience provides the drive for O'Neill to introduce people to the power of music. 
"That is the best thing about music-no matter what lan­guage you speak or where you are from, there is always a common thread of music," he said. 
After graduation in May, O'Neill will be pursuing a career in music, but utilizing his degree in marketing to mar­ket himself. 
"I am going to be playing with a band in Minneapolis and teaching students how to improvise and play by ear," he said. "I would like to play some­where like the Mall of America in Macy's or Bloomingdale's just because I could market my albums right next to where I am playing."

African Association celebrates donation of films 
By LISA MONACO Assistant Accent Editor 
On April 4, 1994 in an official donation ceremony, Notre Dame received eleven African films bought by the African Student's Association to Educational Media. The films explore the issues which con­front Africans. 
The film "Finzan, A Dance for the Heroes" describes the cry of African women for emancipa­tion. According to "Variety," "'Finzan' evokes furious sympa­thy for the plight of African women."

dolyak took over for White Shadow. Newcomer dominated the game from the outset with various acrobatic moves and a thunderous dunk.Towards the end of the game, Barbwire went cold and White Shado.w cashed in. 
"He can do anything," said Vrdolyak about Newcomer. "He has a nice touch, great hops, and he'll be all-Bookstore someday, guaranteed." 
"It was a tough game with a lot of fouls, but they're a good team and they'll get to 16," said Wrapped in Barbwire captain Matt Jennings. 
Hot Grits A Flyin beat Dogs That Bite in a grueling game at the Bookstore courts. 
"It was a real physical game," said Dan Pier, a member of Hot Grits. "It was close all the way and those types of games are always a lot of fun." 
"From here on in, every game is going to be a battle," added Pier. 
Some of the seeded teams that played yesterday advanced in waltzes. #11 Rebel Alliance, #13 Unfrozen Caveman, #14 DOS KLOSKAS, and #16 CCE dominated from the outset. 
Unfrozen Caveman and DOS KLOSKAS played side by side at Stepan yesterday, and both games ended simultaneously with acrobatic dunks. Sopho­more Kevin Janicki threw it down for the Caveman and classmate Pete Coleman jammed it home for KLOSKAS.

on the rims today as the top teams are all in action. With the start of 64, referees will begin to roam the courts and keep track of fouls. 
"Referees will be a positive," explained head commissioner Greg Bieg. "There won't be as much tension between teams, because the refs will provide an outlet." 
"Referees are a big factor, es­pecially if they get intimated by the crowd," said #6 Majestic Silverbacks captain Ben O'Rourke. "If crowds are really involved, it makes a huge dif­ference." 
O'Rourke's team features se­nior basketball player Brooks Boyer and expects to do well the rest of the tournament. 
"We're capable of beating any team in the tournament," con­tinued O'Rourke. "We'll have trouble with some big teams, but if we get some good weath­er and get lucky, we'll be able to stick with the other teams." 
Some unseeded teams that have a chance today include,

Sweeter Than Candy and 5X. Sweeter knocked off R.S.V.P in the first round and has played well thus far. 
"We're an outside shooting team, and we play tough, smart basketball," said junior Bryan Hakala, Sweeter's captain. "We have a pretty good chance of going farther than 64." 
5X, a confident, all freshman team led by football players Emmett Mosley and Thomas Krug, faces the #3 seed Head­hangers at 7:00 pm on Stepan Court number 8. 
"We're not surprised we've gotten this far," said Mosley. "I think we can take them, but it's gonna be a tough game." 
Many of today's games will be rescheduled for tonight because of football practice. 
"The tournament has gone well so far except for the leg in­jury," concluded Bieg. "All the top 16 seeds are in 64, but we might lose some seeds today. We'll have a better barometer of the rest of the tournament after today's games."

CLASS OF 1994 

Open Monday-Saturday 9:00 A.M.-5:00P.M. 
By JENNY MARTEN 
Sports Writer 

Intrastate rival Purdue comes to Eck Stadium tonight to face the streaking Irish in a 7 p.m. game. 
Notre Dame with a 21-8 record has dominated its less fortunate opponents lately win­ning 13 of its last 14 games. All of those wins came against teams with losing records and things shouldn't be any differ­ent when the 12-24 Boilermak­ers get into town. 
While the Irish are streaking in a positive way, Purdue is not. The Boilermakers have dropped 14 of its last 17 games to Northwestern, Iowa and Minnesota. 
The Purdue game is just an­other brick in the Irish's stone wall of a schedule. Having played eight games in the last four days, the players are being affected by the ceaseless sched­ule and the injury list is grow­ing. 
Third baseman Matt Haas has been sidelined with a lower back strain since last Monday. 
Centerfielder Scott Sollman sat out yesterday's doublehead­er with an infected knee and utility man Mark Mapes, both­ered by a recurring back injury, saw only limited action yesterday. 
All three should be ready to play either tonight or later this week. 
Haas' absence has disrupted the infield and Murphy is look­ing forward to having his in­field back intact. 
"With our defense playing so much better, it'll be great to have Matt out there this week," said Murphy who is impressed with the improvements some of his players have shown. "Failla, with all the things he has had to deal with, is still stepping up. Mike Amrhein is coming into his own."

short game," said Murray. "The home course advantage gave me a lot more confidence in my swing." 
The practice and confidence paid off. With the lowest first round in the tournament and an overall ninth place finish, Melby was clearly the most im­proved player for the Irish. 
Unfortunately. the play of Murray and Melby could not rectify the detrimental affect the wind had on the rest of the team's rounds. Although they were defeated by the Irish in the Boilermaker tournament at Purdue two weeks ago, Illinois State fmished second place be­hind Wisconsin. Michigan fm­ished third leaving the Irish with a fourth place finish. 
"I feel pretty good about last weekend," said an optimistic coach Ross Smith. "We are heading into our last tourna­ment with a lot of girls on the verge of breaking through. We need four of the six players to have a good round at the same time." 
With this in mind, the Irish are looking forward to the Illi­nois Invitational and an oppor­tunity to have luck finally fulfill its part.

great thing is that everyone 
realizes we've got to get a lot 
better." 
After winning the first game 
18-4, Notre Dame wasted no 
time in taking a sizeable lead 
over Cleveland State (7-22) in 
the second game of the double­
header. 
Six runs in the first inning was all Notre Dame starter Tim Kraus would need. Kraus (3-0) gave up one run on four hits with one walk and three strike­outs in his four innings on the mound. 
"I felt real strong today. I had good velocity on my fastball and I was changing speeds well." said Kraus whose team gave him a six-run lead. "You can't beat the run production we've been getting lately. I just try to pretend it's a 0-0 ballgame." 
Garrett Carlson followed Kraus, but only lasted a third of an inning after being tagged for four runs on three hits. 
Mike Amhrein and Wally Widelski closed the game with 2-2/3 shut out innings on the mound. 
Irish catcher Bob Lisanti, who has struggled at the plate this year, caught fire going 2­for-3 with a double, a triple and three RBis in the game. Greg Layson (2-for-5), Mapes (1-for­2, 3 RBls) and Rowan Richards (1-for-2, 3 RBls) also made con­tributions at the plate. 
Layson led off the bottom of the first with a single and came home on George Restovich's triple to the right field corner. After Ryan Topham walked, 
Read The Observer for Bookstore Basketball coverage. 
Mapes doubled home Restovich and Topham and eventually crossed the plate on a balk by Viking starter Andy Kovacic. Lisanti added a two-run double to give the Irish a 6-0 edge. 
Cleveland State grabbed one back in the third on Matt Car­penter's RBI single, but Notre Dame extended its lead to 10-1 in the bottom of the fourth. 
Rowan Richards scored on Layson's single and Layson scored on a Kevin Tommasini single before Kovacic loaded the bases. 
Mapes and Paul Failla notched RBis on a walk and a sacrifice fly respectively. 
Tommasini, a freshman, got his first start of the year after Irish fans voted him their first baseman over Robbie Kent. Tommasini was unfazed by the honor. 
"I've played before, but it was fun to start," said Tommasini. "Baseball is baseball. I just go out and play and have a good time." 
Cleveland State capitalized on Irish miscues to score four runs in the top of the fifth off Irish reliever Carlson, but Notre Dame got them right back with four more an inning later. 
In the bottom of the sixth, Robby Birk was forced across the plate on a bases-loaded walk to Dennis Twombley be­fore Richards cleared the bases with a triple. 
The first game was all-Irish as the offense turned 16 hits into almost as many runs in the 18-5 blowout. 
Kent, Topham and DeSenis contributed the majority of the Irish runs in the game. Kent went 4-for-5 with a two-run double, a triple and an RBI sin­gle. 

Topham (2-for-4) posted four runs batted in with his three­run dinger and RBI single of his own while DeSensi added a three-run double in the bottom of the sixth. 
Cleveland State took advan­tage of a shaky performance from Irish starter Gregg Hene­bry to put three runs on the board in the first inning. With only one out, Henebry was pulled in favor of A.J. Jones who inherited a bases loaded situation and gave up a sacri­fice bunt before retiring the side. 
Jones (3-1) got the win after allowing only three hitds and holding the Vikings scoreless in his 3-213 innings on the mound. Paul Pryblo (3 hits, 1 run, 4 K) earned his third save of the year with three innings on the mound. 
Topham made up for an er­ror in the bottom of the first with a three-run home run off the screen in deep centerfield to knot the score at 3-3. 
The Irish picked up four more runs in the second inning. Jones pitched out of a bases loaded jam in the fourth inning and Notre Dame turned that momentum into seven runs in the bottom half of the inning. The Irish got four more insur­ance runs in the sixth before Cleveland State's Matt Carpenter closed the scoring with a solo home run in the top of the seventh for the 18-4 fi­nal.

Upstart Irish face Midwest powers 

By KATE CRISHAM 
Sporn Writer 
There used to be a time where the words "Midwestern" and "tennis" were considered oxymorons in the world of women's collegiate tennis. Most of the traditional tennis power­houses were centered in the talent-laden Southern and Western regions, while the Midwestern programs were simply considered poor cousins. 
That's all changed now. 
The 16th-ranked Notre Dame women's tennis team faces what could be the most impor­tant three matches of the sea­son this week, as they play Purdue today, 14th-ranked Indiana on Wednesday, and 34th-ranked Michigan on Satuday in their quest to secure the regional bid to NCAA tour­nament. 
The Irish are one of five Midwestern teams currently ranked in the top-25. They currently boast an 8-2 record against regional teams, having lost only to fifth-ranked Kansas and seventh-ranked North­western. 
Head coach Jay Louderback realizes that the Midwestern teams-especially Indiana­boast an impressive level of tal­ent. 
Still, he believes that his Irish are equal to the task. 
"This is defmitely a big week­end," said Louderback. "These are very important matches, and it's good that we've had a week off to get rested." 
"Purdue is a bottom Big Ten team, but if we don't play well, it could end in a tied match," said Louderback. "And of course, Indiana is a very tough team." 
Ironically, it is Michigan that has resurrected Irish hopes for a regional bid. 
"Michigan upset North-west­ern and Wisconsin, and Indiana also has two losses," said Louderback. "That means no one in the region is undefeated, which is definitely good for us." 
The Irish will be without the services of senior Lisa Tholen in singles, and freshman Erin Gowen in singles and doubles in the Indiana and Purdue matches. 
"Our key is making sure Lisa plays doubles," says Louderback. "Erin. won't be playing either until the Michigan match." 
Notre Dame's depth has been a blessing in the wake of the two injuries. 
"We've had to shuffie around the lineup a little bii," Louderback said. "Terri Vitale has done a great job stepping up for us, and she's playing really well lately." 
One marquee match will be 13th-ranked Wendy Crabtree's match against Indiana's Jody Yin. 
"They're the top two players in the region, and Wendy beat her in the finals of our Rolex tournament," said Louderback. "They're both going to the NCAA tournament, so it will be a bigger match for the team than for the individuals." 


The Observer/Eric Ruelhling 
Thirteenth-ranked Wendy Crabtree will lead the Irish this week against the top programs of the up-and-com­ing Midwest.

Bookstore whittled to 64 
Few upsets as tournament 
action heats up 
By DOMINIC AMOROSA Sports Writer 
Dogfight, Battle, War and Intensity have been some of the words heard around the basketball courts at Stepan and the Bookstore the past couple of days. Hard­
fought games become the norm around this time of year at Notre Dame. Today

starts the round of 64 for Bookstore Basketball XXIII. 
Three top 32 teams have fallen thus far, and various others have struggled through close games. Two top 16 teams had to win overtime games to reach 64, and the top teams must be weary of unseeded teams sneaking up on them for an upset. 
The White Shadow, the number 12 seed, won a nail-biting game over Wrapped in Barbwire 23-2l.Hot Grits A Flyin, the #15 seed, won by the same margin. 
"It was just a great game," commented White Shadow captain Eddie Vrdolyak. "We had heard they were a great team and the only reason that they didn't have a seed was because they were young."
