Veltsin says some U.S. prisoners were executed 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Russian President Boris Yeltsin told U.S. senators Wednesday in a letter that Americans were held in prison camps after World War II and some were "summarily executed" but others still live in his country voluntarily. 
Yeltsin's letter also said some Americans had been forced to renounce their citizenship. 
Russian leaders are almost certain no U.S. citizens are still being detained, Yeltsin said in his letter, read to a Senate committee by the general who serves as Russian head of a U.S.-Russian commission searching for American POWs 
Loretto renovation underway 
By JENNIFER HABRYCH 
News Writer 
Controversy has subsided on the Saint Mary's campus now that renovation of the Church of Our Lady of Loretto has begun, according to Joanne Mullin, director of communica­tions for the Sisters of the Holy Cross. 
Renovation, which was originally scheduled to begin in November 1991, was postponed for various starting dates until work began this summer on August 17. Now in the con­struction and rebuilding phase, renovation is scheduled to be completed February 14. 
The project, which was un­veiled to the sisters during the sesquicentennial celebration of the Sisters of the Holy Cross in July 1991 and to Saint Mary's students in September, was met with opposition in the community. Mullin said that the controversy died down be­fore the project even began the construction phase. 
"Only a fraction of the community (of sisters) were opposed to it," said Mullin. "About 90 percent of the sisters were in favor of it (the renova­tion) from the beginning (according to surveys of the community). Anything the order does has to be a consen­sus. Those sisters who didn't want it have accepted it now." 
Mullin added that the con­troversy in the Saint Mary's and South Bend communities also died down before the ren­ovation even started. "Those who were opposed to it felt it was to late do do anything about it anymore." 
She said that efforts were made to address student con­cerns and questions about the renovation. Two student open forums were held, one in the fall and the other in the spring, in which the renovation com­mittee listened to student con­cerns. 
"Student concerns were lis­tened to, but the ideas weren't utilized," said Kathy Roe, a se­nior who organized the second student forum. "I think people are still upset about it, but they feel powerless. Why try any­more?"

Gore, Bush honor war vets at Vietnam memorial 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Veter­ans led by Vice President-elect AI Gore laid wreaths in the rain at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wednesday after President Bush paid a midnight visit to the wall where the names of 58,183 war dead are inscribed. 
Ceremonies marking the 1Oth anniversary of the memorial highlighted the nation's ob­servance of Veterans Day. 
Maya Lin, the artist who de­signed the monument, told a crowd estimated by National Park Police at 30,000, "I may be the author, but I would like to remain fairly silent. This wall is designed for you." 
Bush and his wife Barbara slipped away from the White House about midnight, hours before the main ceremony, and joined volunteers at the wall in reading the names of those killed and missing. 
"It was a very moving tribute," said Bush "I've been there several times before, but it was extraordinarily moving for Barbara and me. I just wanted to thank the veterans for their service to this great country of ours." 
Gore, whose appearance at the afternoon event was not 
listed on the program, ex­pressed thanks to the president "for coming here and partici­pating in the reading of names." 
"I think it is time to put the divisions of the Vietnam War out of our political process once and for all," Gore said. 
Many-colored umbrellas dotted the crowd of people who jammed the grounds as a steady rain, heavy at times, fell through most of the 90-minute program. 
Terry Anderson, the longest­held American hostage in Le­banon, who served a tour in Vietnam with the Marines, asked his fellow veterans, "Is everybody cold and wet? Does this bring back memories?" 
"This memorial is dedicated to those who gave their lives in Vietnam," Anderson said. "It is a fitting memorial. But it seems to me it is also a penetrating reminder that they were not the only ones who paid a price in that war, great as theirs was." 
"Veteran or civilian, supporter or opponent of that terrible war, we all paid, we all have the right to speak our thoughts here, to remember aloud what it cost us individually and as a nation," he said. 
LONDON (AP) -The Church of England voted Wednesday to ordain women as priests, risk­ing a schism with a stubborn minority in its pulpits and pews who feel the move contradicts Scripture and tradition. 
The vote allows the Church of England to join 12 of the 2 8 self-governing provinces in the Anglican Communion that al­ready ordain women priests ­most of them in the 2.5 million­member Episcopal Church in the United States. 
But in Rome, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the vote was a "grave ob­stacle" to repairing the 16th century split between Roman Catholics and Anglicans. 
"The church has been emo­tionally exhausted over this. Now we can get on with preaching the Gospel," said Cave Bergquist, a chaplain at Trinity College, Cambridge, who was in the crowd awaiting news of the vote outside Church House in central London. 

With a two-thirds majority required in each of the three houses of the church's General Synod, the legislation was ap­proved 39-13 by the bishops, 176-7 4 by the clergy and 169­82 among the laity after a day­long debate. 
A switch of just two votes among lay delegates would have blocked the path to priesthood for the church's 1,350 women deacons. 
If Parliament and Queen Elizabeth II endorse the deci­sion, as expected, the first woman priest could be ordained in 1994. 
"The ordination of women to the priesthood alters not a word in the creeds, the Scriptures, or the faith of our church," said Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, the spiritual head of the Church of England. 
The legislation does not permit women bishops. Also, parishes may refuse to accept a woman as priest, and bishops cannot be compelled to ordain women or accept them as priests in their dioceses. 
Following its historic vote, the synod approved severance pay arrangements for any full-time priest who decided to resign rather than accept women. 
Some opponents threatened to leave the church. Michael Silver, who was in the crowd outside Church House, said those who did not want the change "have no choice but to rebuild the Church of England from outside." 
Bishop David Hope of London said that a split "is a danger, but we have to wait and see how the thing turns out." 
"I now have to reflect carefully on the decision and the sort of options that lie open before me," said Hope, who opposed the legislation. "And I hope that I will do that in a generous and Christian kind of way." 
The crowd of about 400 out­side Church House roared in approval as it heard a radio broadcast of Carey announcing the vote. Many who had been clutching lighted candles hugged, cried, danced in circles and set off fireworks. 
"The vote was an affirmation of the direction the U.S. Epis­copal Church took, and it· will have an immense effect on the Australian Anglicans who vote on it Nov. 21," said Father Robbin Clark, an Episcopal priest from Santa Fe, N.M.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Clinton must lead 'Decade of Women' 
This year has been dubbed the "Year of the Woman," and, in many ways, it has lived up to its name. 
In the recent elections, womens' membership in the Senate increased from two to six, and from 29 to 49 in the House of Julie Barrett Representatives. Many Assistant News Editor 
"women's issues" have ________ been in the spotlight as well, such as abortion, sexual harassment, family leave and single motherhood. In fact, abortion was one of the most important and divisive issues in the presidential campaign. 
The plight to establish fair and equal rep­resentation of women and the issues they are particularly concerned with in our nation seems well underway. 

But, to play the devil's advocate, should women get their hopes up that real and immediate changes will take place with these few, but significant steps they've made? 
Men still hold a large majority in the House and Senate, and I don't foresee a woman president in the near future. 
Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that men don't care about women's issues; however, according to a recent study by the Center for the American Women in Politics (CAWP), women legislators are 50 percent more likely to support a pro-woman bill than their male colleagues. 
The survey also indicated that 7 5 percent o male state legislators said the presence o female colleagues made them more aware o the way legislative issues affect women. 
President-elect Bill Clinton's campaign platform included many promises to support women's issues such as a woman's right to abortion and a family leave bill. 
He also promised to make appointments to his administration that reflect America if he won the presidency. The fact that there are more women than men in America would mean that more than half of Clinton's staff will be women. 
I'm a little skeptical. 
But the idea is not quantity over quality. I there are more men out there that are better qualified than women, then they should receive the appointments without question. 
The fact is, however, that there are plenty o professional women qualified for positions in the White House Staff, the Cabinet and other areas of government. 
These promising, well-qualified women include Representatives Pat Schroeder and Maxine Waters, Texas Governor Ann Richards, former Vermont Governor Madeleine Kunin (the only woman on Clinton's six-member transition board), California Treasurer Kathleen Brown, University of Chicago President Hannah Gray and even Clinton's wife Hillary. 
The Clinton team should have no excuse for not finding qualified women to fill the positions. Then rather than "Year of the Woman," it would be "Decade of the Woman."

Bishops' may reassess role of women 
•WASHINGTON-U.S. Roman Catholic bishops next week try again to get a clearer focus on the role of women in the church and society, but church perspectives about it remain blurred. Criticism from interest groups and friction among the bishops themselves are likely to push bishops to abandon, for now, an attempt to turn out a pastoral teaching letter on women. "I don't think there's much chance it will get the two-thirds majority it needs," said Bishop Joseph L. Imesch of Joliet, Ill., head of a six-bishop committee during nine years of trying to shape an acceptable document. This is "absolutely the last round," he added in a telephone interview. The bishops, instead of issuing a pastoral letter, may settle for some less authoritative document, perhaps only a statement or brief summary of the problem, as suggested by some bishops, if the impasse can't be broken. 
Sawyer sued for libel and slander 
•TULSA, Okla.-Television evangelist Robert Tilton is suing ABC News and reporter Diane Sawyer, alleging an expose on his ministry was combined with "rumors, gossip, half-truths and lies." Tilton, head of the 8,000­member Word of Faith congregation near Dallas, alleges a "PrimeTime Live" broadcast on Nov. 21, 1991, andre­broadcast in July, libeled and slandered his ministry. The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court. ABC News spokeswoman Teri Everett said Wednesday the company had not been notified of the lawsuit and declined to com­ment. The lawsuit focuses on allegations that Tilton gets his holy water from Taiwan, fails to pray personally over prayer requests, and fails to send money to an orphanage in Haiti as he claims.

Applications submitted are judged by a board of three stu­dents: Campione; Liz Janz, senior representative; and Carolyn Withers, sophomore representative. There is no set criteria for acceptance and each nominee is judged sepa­rately by their accomplish­ments, according to Campione. 

"I encourage both faculty and students to continue nominating current students and alumnae. We have been pleased so far with the response,"she said. She hopes to bring strong awareness to current students of many possibilities of the future. STAR also helps to display a diversity and aware­ness of Alumnae achievements.

Cease-fire in Bosnia fails 

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herze­govina (AP) -Fighting erupted in Bosnia's capital Wednesday night shortly before a planned cease-fire, and the Red Cross scrapped efforts to move more civilians from the besieged city before winter sets in. 
Glowing tracer bullets streaked the sky after sundown. The thump of exploding mortar shells and chatter of machine guns and rifles sounded south of the presidency building in central Sarajevo, and machine guns could be heard firing in the western outskirts. 
The combat was the worst in the capital in days. Intense shooting lasted about a half­hour, but fighting continued into the night at the approach of a midnight deadline for a truce throughout Bosnia that was agreed to by military lead­ers of the republic's warring Muslim, Serb and Croat fac­tions. 
Dozens of cease-fires have failed to stop the 8-month-old 


EC wants talks with U.S. to avert trade war 
HAPPY 22 

JENNI"FER" GRANT 
Show a little faith there's magic in the night. 

~RISH IMPORTS 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) ­European Community (EC) ne­gotiators said Wednesday they will meet with their U.S. coun­terparts within a week to try to avert a trade war that could damage struggling economies on both sides of the Atlantic. 
The announcement signaled that the 12-nation bloc has at least temporarily bridged dif­ferences over dealing with U.S. demands for further cuts in subsidies paid to EC farmers. Britain, Germany and others have urged compromise, while France has pressed for retalia-Muslims and Croats to break Bosnia away from Serbia­dominated Yugoslavia. Fighters in the field often appear to defy the orders of their comman­ders, but U.N. officials ex­pressed hope this truce would take hold. 

Shortly before the heaviest shooting in Sarajevo, the Red Cross canceled the evacuation of some residents after one of its bus drivers was wounded in a mortar attack. 
Apparently ending a two­month effort to take away thou­sands of women, children, elderly and wounded because of food shortages and a lack of heat and shelter, the cancella­tion prompted some frustrated people to threaten to flee on foot. 
"Listen, commander, I'm fed up to my ears," Red Cross chief Pava Barisic angrily told the Bosnian army's 1st Corps commander, Mustafa Hajrula­hovic. "I don't want anything to do with any convoys anymore. I just want these people to get out of town." 

The Red Cross has been battling resistance to the con­voys and planned to evacuate 6,000 people, from the military forces of all parties. 
tion. 
The Bush administration has given the EC until Dec. 5 to re­solve the dispute or face import taxes on $300 million worth of European products, mostly French white wines. The United States and other nations argue that the subsidies keep European farm prices unfairly low in world markets. 
Community leaders say they will respond with punitive du­ties on a similar amount of U.S. goods. That might bring further action by the United States and trigger a tariff war that would cut sales of goods from both sides and could affect thousands of jobs. 
Although farm lobbies are strong in most of the European Community nations, particu­larly in France, influential Bri­tish and German industrial groups, which fear a trade war would further slow economies, apparently had the last word. 
"What the world economic situation requires at the mo­ment is calm discussion and not saber-rattling," said British Prime Minister John Major, who currently holds the community's rotating presidency. 
"There is an urgent need to come to terms with the Ameri­cans," said EC spokesman Nico Wegter. "There is a very good reason to believe ... that a deal can be made," he added. 
But there was no sign the community had changed its bargaining position of resisting going beyond the subsidy cuts adopted last spring. 
However, officials said chances for an agreement im­proved after EC Farm Commis­sioner Ray MacSharry agreed to resume his role in the nego­tiations. 
MacSharry, an Irishman, quit last week and accused EC Commission President Jacques Delors of interfering to protect French interests. Delors, a French Socialist, has seemed conciliatory in recent days. 
Germany also appeared to pressure France into a more accommodating position, rais­ing the specter of a loss of trade if no deal can be made. 
The meeting could come as early as this weekend, but most likely will be early next week, officials said.

DETROIT (AP) -At the in­tersection of Warren and 23rd, where empty lots and boarded buildings still bear witness to the riots of the 1960s, there's a new focal point: the police vio­lence of the 1990s. 
On a wall adorned by flowers is a plastic-covered picture of Malice Green, a 35-year-old man beaten to death by police last week. 
It has become a gathering point for neighborhood resi­dents who come to see the spot where Green died, to see where gravel has been spread to hide the blood stains. 
"I can't believe this is hap­pening in my city," Carrie Washington, a mother of three grown children, said in frus­tration. "The police used to be our friends." 
The death of the black mo­torist at the hands of a racially­mixed group of police has roiled this city, noted for its in­tegrated, neighborhood-based policing.

S&L executives say Clinton will help 
SAN DIEGO (AP) -Savings and loan executives and economists say mortgage rates could start declining again if President-elect Clinton proves to financial markets he isn't go­ing to enlarge the budget deficit. 
Since early September, when average interest on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages hit a 19­year low of 7.84 percent, rates have jumped up by nearly half a percentage point. 
That's a reflection of the fi­nancial markets' nervousness over what Clinton might do, said executives and others at­tending the final session of the Savings & Community Bankers of America convention on Wednesday.

If the new president wants to see rates stabilize or even edge down, he must couple any effort to stimulate economic growth with a credible plan to reduce the deficit, they said. 
That's essential to prevent an increase in interest rates from offsetting the economic effect of any stimulus from increased government spending or tax cuts, they said. 
Martin Regalia, chief economist of the trade group, said he believed Clinton would resist calls from liberal Democrats and keep his eco­nomic package relatively mod­erate. 
If that happens, mortgage rates, which hit a four-month high of 8.29 percent last week according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., could fall as low as 7.5 percent or 7.25 percent by the middle of next year, he said. If not, they could shoot up over 9 percent, he said. 
"I think Clioton's a pretty sharp guy, and I think his ad­visers are pretty sharp," Re­galia said. "They have a guy with a mandate, and they don't want to mess it up by doing something stupid that causes financial markets to react badly. 
"If they do this one right, they could be looking at a fairly long run of a reasonably good economy.

The Observer is the independent newspaper published by the students of the University of Notre Dame du Lac and Saint Mary's College. It does not necessarily reflect the policies of the administration of either institution. The news is reported as accurately and objectively as possible. Unsigned editorials represent the opinion of the majority of the Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor, News Editor, Viewpoint Editor. Accent Editor, Photo Editor, Sports Editor, and Saint Mary's Editor. Commentaries, letters and Inside Columns present the views of the authors, and not necessarily those of The Observer. Viewpoint space is available to all members of the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community and to all readers. The free expression of varying opinions through letters is encouraged. 

EDITORIAL 


The readers have spoken, and the editors respond 
Dear Readers: 
There's a system that functions in the belief that if all people have an equal voice, then the voice of justice will be victorious. 
Over the last two years, Viewpoint has tried to follow that system -which unfortunately has meant allowing the voice of injustice to be heard along with the others. 
On occasion, different individuals have expressed views trying to blame society's ills on a particular group. One blamed African Americans, another Caucasians, then gays and lesbians, the Japanese, Catholics, Jews and even the male gender as a whole. 
In each case, a public denunciation of the divisive views quickly followed -reaffirming the people's overwhelming choice for equality and justice. 
This system believes that silencing unjust ideologies isn't the answer, but that public exposure of all ideas and then open criticism and even condemnation of those ideas is. It's the American system. And without you, it doesn't work. 
I'm now serving my second term as Viewpoint Editor. My goal from the beginning was to make this section mimic the American system as much as possible. My efforts to create a more democratic forum sometimes required surrendering some of the monarchy of 
the editorship for the sake of the public readership. 
One change was opening the "Quote of the Day" section to reader participa~ion -instead of the quotes bemg preselected by one person -resulting in a broader spectrum of opinion. 
Another change was establishing a weekly poetry column, "Thursday's Verse," which again empowers our 

readers  to  submit  more  diverse  
thoughts  and  reflections  outside  
standard prose.  

The fmal change, lifting the Viewpoint policy restriction on the views of 

"unbalanced minds" has become the most controversial, and required the most trust in our readership. 
My reasoning was to let the public see what kind of views are really out there and let them be the judges of what is and is not "unbalanced" by reader response. The editorial board unanimously approved the change and the reins of control were loosened. 
The Observer is a college newspaper and college is the place to be experimental -to test limits, to be able to face the dragon in the darkest ideologies and fight the good fight. 
As I worked to create a more free atmosphere, interest and participation increased -and the Viewpoint section increased from one or two pages a day to two or three. 
The system was working -people from much more diverse walks of life and beliefs inside and outside the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's community were taking their stands. 
Then one recent day -last Thursday -a man took the stand, spouting off extremist rhetoric. To many readers, it was long-winded and incomprehensible ramblings about some ambiguous "slave law." 
For others more studied, the rhetoric conjured immediate and horrifying reminders of one of the darkest moments in recorded history -that of the mass and insane persecution of a whole people. 

These readers were not challenged by the dialogue, but were angered that such idiocy would be printed in a re­spectable public forum, especially with no warning or disclaimer. 
The American experiment wasn't working as it was intended. The excess of freedom -which I take full responsibility for -actually hindered the purpose of freedom by limiting a clear discussion of the column's content. As they say, ideals are great ... until they're put to use. 
Again, the Viewpoint section is for the readers. You have spoken, and we have heard your message. 
Now the reins are a little tighter, as the following Editorial Board clarifications indicate. But these moves should not be viewed as a hindrance to free discussion. Instead, our decisions reflect our commitment to protecting free speech within a context that neither confuses nor calls into question anything but the issues at hand. 
-Joe Moody Viewpoint Editor 

The following clarifications were passed unanimously by The Observer's Editorial Board on Nov. 11, 1992: 
I. "Guest Columns" have always reflected the perspectives of readers initiating dialogue on a particular subject in a format longer than typical letters. However, the title was misconstrued by many who thought the views somehow reflected The Observer's, or appeared as an invitation by the Editorial Board. 
To avoid further misunderstanding, the Editorial Board has eliminated the label entirely. Hereafter, only regular Viewpoint columnists or Observer staff columnists will be designated as such. All other material will appear as Letters to the Editor. We believe this will eliminate further confusion about material with the Viewpoint section. 
II. Many readers were further confused by the Viewpoint policy with respect to printing or rejecting material. While libel and personal slander are explicit in the policy, another consideration has historically been an unwritten part of the policy. 
Hereafter, the consideration of the relevancy of the letter will be formally included in the existing Viewpoint policy. Relevancy here applies to the local, national or world interest of a particular issue, its extension of existing issues on the Viewpoint pages, and/or it's role in fostering spirited and intelli­gent discussion. 
III. Finally, several of our readers questioned the shock treatment that the column in question evoked. To read the column on its own left many offended and outraged. 
While we sympathize with their reaction, we cannot condone suggestions to render extreme or explicit material unworthy of print ­including the column in question. 
Instead, a disclaimer will appear with any letter deemed highly graphic, profane or discriminatory, yet nonetheless relevant. This disclaimer will appear at the beginning of the letter and will alert readers to the serious nature of the piece in question. 
It is our belief that warning the readers of the letter's content and disavowing Observer endorsement of the material will sufficiently explain its placement and potential impact, opening dialogue on the issue at hand and not on the decision to print it.

Only solution to controversy is to recognize abortion as 'murder' 
Dear Editor: 
I feel compelled to take issue with Fr. Robert Griffin's article regarding the abortion conflict in this nation (The Observer, Nov. 6, 1992). I am disappointed that a Catholic priest would only pay lip service to the pro-life position and say that the two sides can and should compromise. 
Fr. Griffin states that he "want(s) to believe that a woman has a right to control her own body. Then (he) hear(s)of school-girls using abortion as a primary means of contraception." 
No one is questioning the right of a woman to control her body. All she has to do is choose not to have sex, and she doesn't need to choose between life or death for the life that is within her, nor does she have that right. 
Fr. Griffin goes on to state that he would like to see the Center for Social Concerns set up meetings with Planned Par­enthood to "eliminate the totally irresponsible abortions. For example, when a couple want­ing a boy find out the (sic) the child they are expecting is a girl, or when fetuses are de­stroyed though the woman is seven or eight months along." 
Does this mean that abortions performed because the mother does not feel that she can take care of the child are responsible and therefore acceptable? I sincerely hope that Fr. Griffin did not mean to imply that abortions performed for less controversial reasons like this are responsible and therefore acceptable, for such a position contradicts the faith to which he has devoted his life 
Fr. Griffin does make a good point in noting that addressing the reasons that a mother feels compelled to abort her baby should be paramount. However, he makes it seem as though pro-lifers that care about the mother are few and far between, and that the majority are the "right to-life zealots" that he says call mothers seeking abortions murderers. 
The reality is, in fact, just the opposite. The "zealots" that verbally abuse mothers seeking abortion are rare, while those of us who will address the mother's concerns are, by far, the majority. 
Fr. Griffin speaks of abortion as "sheer butchery," yet feels that we must compromise on this issue. 
The only way that this issue can be resolved is for everyone to see abortion for what it is: the murder of an innocent child who simply has not yet been born, for as long as abortion is allowed anywhere in this na­tion, there will be people speaking up for the one person most affected by the choice on abortion: the unborn child.

While initial structural changes were minimal, many men on campus resented women taking over their dorms. 
Building tor the future 
NO's decision to admit women in 1972 made campus structural changes anecessity 
Editor's note: This is the first in a series of monthly pages examining various issues related to coeducation at the University. This year marks the 20th anniversary of coeducation at Notre Dame. 

By SANDY WIEGAND 
Accent Writer 
Among the first women to attend Notre Dame "the big joke," according to 1973 graduate Nancy Parker, "was flowers in the urinals." 
In fact, the initial structural changes to accomodate women on campus were quite minimal, said Facilities Engineering Project Coordinator John Moorman, who has worked at Notre Dame since 1969. 
"The cost in the early '70s was minimal due to the fact that the conversion was very minimal," Moorman said. "Basically the dorm was spruced up to accept women." 
Students from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's had been allowed to take classes on their neighbors' campus since 1965. But it wasn't until 1972, Notre Dame's 130th academic year, that the University first admitted women for full-time studies. 
That year, 365 women enrolled at Notre Dame. Of these, 125 were freshman-composing less than one­tenth of the class. Of the 240 others who had transfered from other universities, 211 came from Saint Mary's. 
Residence halls Badin and Walsh, much to the chagrin of their male inhabitants at the time, were chosen as the first to house women. 
The changes in Badin and Walsh included repainting the walls in pastel colors, hanging cafe curtains, adding wardrobes and chests of drawers to each room, and placing full-length mirrors in the dorms. Workers also replaced sinks and medicine cabinets in Badin and replaced spigots in Walsh's"' sinks. 

More extensive projects included construction of kitchenettes and installation of coin-operated washing machines and dryers. An ironing room was designated. 
For added security, floodlights and fire escapes were installed outside the dormitories, and doors were equipped with Detex systems so only residents could enter. Fire doors with alarms were installed on all fire exits. Female security officers were hired to work in the dorms from 11 p.m. to 5:15a.m. 
The residence hall renovations cost about $150,000. 
Parker's joke was an exaggeration, but not completely off-base. Moorman said, "We would just go into the bathroom and block off the urinals, put a wall up in front of the urinals, and then added drapes and carpeting and things like this to, if you will, give a feminine touch to the building." 
Still, the Advisory Committee on Coeducation, composed of students, faculty and administration, "recommended that neither of the halls be renovated such that they became inordinately feminine," an Observer reporter from the era noted. 
Robert Ackerman, director of Student Activities at the time, pointed out that this recommendation was being followed, particularly sinc.e "neither hall was furnished with hair dryers." 
The decision to convert Badin and Walsh to women's dormitories, like the recent decision to convert Pangborn, incited much resentment on the part of the male residents. The administration explained the decision as follows: 
"...both allow for appropriate security for young women, both have adequate physical facilities, and both have room available for social and recreational purposes. Necessary renovations could be accomplished at a reasonable cost." 
Many Badin and Walsh men didn't consider the choices optimum, though. They complained not only that the conversion would break up a close-knit community, but that it was illogical. 
The situation was to worsen as overcrowding in succeeding years forced male students to live off campus. Despite assurances from the administration that coeducation and overcrowding were unrelated, some resentment remained. 
In January 197 4, student Butch Ward pointed out in an Observer column that all students forced to move out of their dorms "had one thing in common. They were all male." 
But Bill Hartigan, a former Flanner resident and 1973 graduate, commented recently that "at that time, it was more of a psychological change for us because it was really no problem with the dorms being changed." 
Hartigan, a Palm Beach, Fla. resident, added that some resentment was inevitable. He said, " ... that's going to happen anywhere whether you're a new woman on campus or you got lucky in the (room) lottery." 
Notre Dame women were not to be confined to their dormitories, and other renovations were necessary if they were to take advantage of campus activities. Even before women began attending Notre Dame, the University renovated the Rockne Memorial. 
On Oct. 28, 1971, when Notre Dame and Saint Mary's were still considering merging-a plan that was abandoned in late November, 1971-The Observer reported: "The Rockne Building is available to SMC girls at any time after 
P.E. classes ... The Rock has locker and shower facilities for up to 50 girls." 
A former boxing room in the Rockne Memorial was converted into a women's locker room, which was carpeted and equipped with hair dryers, and the shower facilities were in a former golf dressing room. 
The swimming pool manager in 1971 reported that "Sometimes we have more girls than guys here and I haven't seen any problems," and added that the pool even boasted a "girl lifeguard." 
But Dr. Thomas Fallon, physical education chair, advised that "girls using the Rock ... come in the front door and follow the signs. 'Otherwise there might be a little embarrassment. The building was not designed for co-ed use.' " 
It would take a while for women to gain complete access to the Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center (JACC), though. In 1971, women were restricted to the ice skating rink, and female fencers who had practiced in the building were barred. 
But JACC manager John Plowff assured the women that the facility would be ready for them in 1972. And that first year, students participated in coeducational physical education classes. 
The campus infirmary was expanded and divided into separate sections for men and women. Hanson said she stayed in the infirmary for a short time, and "was in a complete ward for women and didn't feel intruded upon or concerned about it." 
The University administration rejected the advice of the Advisory Committee on Coeducation that a part-time gynecologist be hired, deeming such services more "specialized" than the health services required.

•••CONSIDERATIONS 
Campus Ministry extends an invitation to all to participate in the annual Christian Interfaith Thanksgiving Prayer Service. 
Thanksgiving Day is a time for giving thanks to the Lord for the many, good things we have received as individuals, as families, as members of this University, and as the people of this great nation. Originally, it was a day set aside to express thanks for the abundant harvest of the fields. Today it is a national holiday, focusing on the virtues of gratitude and appreciation. It is an occasion to render thanks for the beauty of the earth and its resources, for family, for friends, for the Notre Dame community and for the love shown us in the life and works ofJesus. 
In order to express these sentiments as a community, we will have an ecumenical Thanksgiving prayer service on Thursday, November 19, at 7:30p.m. in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Christians from different religious backgrounds and different religious traditions and roots will come together to give thanks to the Lord. All will be united in the oneness of Christ Jesus. This will be a time for members of the campus community and local churches to come together to pray in a non, ritualized manner. In the future, I hope we will pray with non,Christians groups as well. We all benefit from the chance to share cultural experiences and religious traditions. 
Thursday, the sponsoring groups invite students, faculty, staff and friends to join in this festive celebration of song and praise to the Lord for the many benefits we have received. We will also remember those who are less fortunate and will pray for their needs. At the end of the service, there will be an opportunity to make a free will offering. This is a way to reach out to others and to share with them some of the gifts and goods which we possess. Please be with us and join in the corporate display of thanksgiving to the Creator and gratitude to Jesus, Our Brother. 
Fr. Al D'Alonzo, C.S.C. 
For three years now, Campus Ministry has purchased space in The Observer each week for a column entitled "Considerations ... " This essay is our attempt to share reflections with the members of the Notre Dame Community on topics we consider important from a pastoral perspective. Last Friday, The Observer published a two page article, using the Campus Ministry format and title, without indicating that the article was, in fact, a paid advertisement. The article was an offensive assault on gays and lesbians which used a confusing combination of citations, glosses and interpretations of Scripture and paraphrases of discontinuous quotations from a book authored by Father Edward Malloy. 
The reflections I wrote on homosexuality four weeks ago expressed clearly the teaching of the Catholic Church in this area of sexual ethics. "All men and women are called to live chaste lives," I wrote, " whether we are heterosexual or homosexual, and celibacy is required of all who are not married. By the way we live out these commitments, our lives can be strong statements of what we believe." This statement reflects the content of a 1986 letter from the Congregation of the Faith to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States which declares that "while homosexual inclination is not in itself a sin, neither is homosexual activity a morally acceptable option .... " 
The straightforward teaching of the Church on sexual activity was also stated clearly. "For all of us, regardless of our state of life, genital activity can take place only in the context of marriage, and under circumstances which respect the rights and the responsibilities of both partners whose love for each other is open to the possibility of creating new life." 
With regard to the harassment of gays and lesbians, I stated the obvious namely, that " ... harassment of gay and lesbian people has to be ' denounced as behavior which is inappropriate and contrary to the teaching of Christ." 
Father Malloy's book carefully distinguishes between homosexuality as an orientation and sexual activity between and among homosexuals and homosexual activism. His use of Scripture is not invoked to "prooftext" arguments, but to provide a Biblical vision of what we are called to become because of our capacity to love. 
Finally, I hope campus ministry will continue to look for appropriate ways to extend an open and sensitive welcome to gay and lesbian students. 
It is indeed unfortunate when animosity or disregard for any person or group of persons leads to hostile charges, angry words and demeaning characterizations. As men and women "called to life by a loving God, and brothers and sisters on a common journey back to the God who created us in love" our words and actions can reflect the compassion of the God we love and serve.

Take a great teacher home for Christmas. 
Looking for an extraordinary gift from Notre Dame? Well, there's probably someone back home who would love to meet one of your great professors. To make that possible, the Alumni Association has just published the first four programs in the Notre Dame Great Teachers Series. Why? Because the university can offer something exciting for people whose college days are behind them but who haven't forgotten what a difference great teachers made in their lives. So we asked four of NO's outstanding professors to help us throw open a window for the mind and spirit. They responded with specially prepared lectures on classic works --works they have spent their careers studying and teaching. The result is an affordable, accessible, high-quality series of videotape or audiotape programs that each come with the appropriate books and suggested readings. 
Now the folks at home don't have to wonder what you've been up to. You can show them. They may not have told you this, but they would give their right arms to have the freedom and the time that you have to explore what Notre Dame can offer. So give a great gift to someone who's house-bound, career-bound or family-bound. Send them on an adventure this Christmas with a great teacher.

-
raz1er 
ream 
LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -Last year at this time, Tommie Fra­zier was playing high school football in Bradenton, Fla. Now he's the starting quarterback for one of the top college teams in the nation. 
In the last two weeks, the fab­ulous freshman has led No. 7 Nebraska to stunning victories over nationally ranked oppo­nents-52-7 over Colorado and 49-7 over Kansas. 
"It's a dream being a fresh­man and knowing you can go in and beat two of the best teams in the country on national TV," said Frazier, the first true freshman quarterback to start for Nebraska in modern times. "It makes me feel overwhelmed." 
Despite the attention he's get­ting, Frazier is keeping his cool. 
"The main thing for me is to stay focused, not let my head get too big, stay down in reality a little bit," he said. ''I'm here just like everybody else. I can make mistakes." 
Frazier said his teammates are helping him keep every­thing in perspective. 
"They keep telling me, 'You're still a rookie and don't go out there to try to impress too many people, that you have a great supporting cast here and if we all play together we'll be successful,"' he said. "They all dog me, but that's typical for a freshman." 
Since becoming the starter three weeks ago against Mis­souri, Frazier has passed for 373 yards, rushed for 169 and accounted for eight touch­downs. 
Frazier said he's getting more comfortable with the Nebraska offensive system, which re­quires quarterbacks to make a lot of quick decisions. 
"The Missouri game I was 
kind of shaky, but the Colorado game I was feeling more com­fortable with it," he said. 
Frazier played against tough high school competition in Florida and was tested in a series of postseason all-star games. That made his adjust­ment to college football a little easier. 
"The only difference is I'm playing in front of more fans," Frazier said. 
Frazier didn't expect to play this quickly, but injuries to other players have accelerated his schedule. 
Redshirt freshman Tony Ve­land, who was expected to chal­lenge senior Mike Grant for the starting job, broke a collarbone before the season began. Then Grant was slowed by a back injury that gave Frazier his first start against Missouri. 
The Tiger defense tried to confuse Frazier. but the fresh­man handled the situation well.

The 280-pound Green cer­tainly has been a huge weapon -in more ways than one -for the Steelers, catching 15 touchdown passes in 29 games. But perhaps it's easy to lose sight that, by the end of his suspension, he will have been available to the Steelers for only five games in a 20-game stretch.

second Cy Young Award 
NEW YORK (AP) -Greg Maddux, who won 20 games for a losing Chicago Cubs team, outdueled Atlanta ace Tom Glavine and was named winner of the National League Cy Young Award on Wednesday. 
Maddux went 20-11 with a 
2.18 ERA for the Cubs. He received 20 of the 24 first-place votes from a panel made up of two writers in each league city, and was named second on the remammg four ballots, finishing with 112 points. 
Glavine, trying to become the NL's first repeat Cy Young winner since Sandy Koufax in 1966, was 20-8 with a 2. 76 ERA. He got the remaining four first-place votes and finished second with 78 points. 
Maddux won despite the Cubs going 78-84 -seven of his losses came in shutouts -and finishing fourth in the NL East. He is the fourth Cubs pitcher to win the Cy Young, joining Ferguson Jenkins (1971), Bruce Sutter (1979) and Rick Sutcliffe (1984). Maddux also is the first NL starting pitcher to win the award on a team with a below­.500 record since San Diego's Randy Jones in 1976. 
Maddux was the first Cubs pitcher to win 20 games since Rick Reuschel went 20-10 in 1977. Maddux gave up four or fewer hits in 12 of his 36 starts. 
Glavine's second straight 20­win season came for the Braves, who went 98-64 and won the NL West. The last pitcher to win consecutive Cy Youngs was Boston's Roger Clemens in 1986 and 1987. 
Bob Tewksbury of St. Louis was third in the voting with 22 points, followed by teammate Lee Smith with three and Doug Drabek of Pittsburgh with one. Only Maddux and Glavine were named on all 24 ballots. 
Glavine seemed a shoo-in to win again at the All-Star break. He was 13-3 at that point, but a disastrous start in the All-Star game signaled the beginning of a struggling second half in which he was troubled by injuries and went just 7-5.

Larry Bird speaks on Magic 
NEW YORK (AP) -Larry Bird would have "no problem" playing against Magic Johnson because of the AIDS virus and said "professional jealousy" is a factor in other players' opin­ions, the New York Post re­ported today. 
"I see it as a bad case of pro­fessional jealousy," said the former Boston Celtics star, who was in Palm Beach, Fla., on Tuesday for a celebrity golf tournament organized by Greg Norman. 'As far as playing against (Johnson), I'd have no problem whatsoever." 
Johnson announced his sec­ond retirement from the Los Angeles Lakers on Nov. 2 after Utah star Karl Malone and other players expressed fears about playing against Johnson. Bird and Malone spent two months during the summer practicing against Johnson as 
teammates on the U.S. Olympic team. 
"When you have a Magic Johnson or a Michael Jordan and there are other superstars not getting the press they are, the others sort of resent that," Bird said. 
"The same kind of thing hap­pens in everyday life. I think that's what's happening to Magic now. He's been on top for so long, that everybody is taking a shot at him, to cut him down a little bit. They've been waiting so many years to do it and now they're getting the opportunity to do it. It's sad. 
"There's a lot of attention being focused on Magic because he's the first athlete to come out and try to play with the AIDS virus. 
"I feel very sorry for him, but there's nothing you can do now."

ourning ends holdout, signs with Hornets 

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)-The Charlotte Hornets and Alonzo Mourning have reached an agreement on a multiyear contract, a newspaper reported today. 
The agreement signals the end of a holdout that kept Mourning out of the Hornets' preseason schedule and the first three games of the season. 
Hornets president Spencer Stolpen would not deny agree­ment had been reached when he was contacted Tuesday night, The Charlotte Observer said. 
Mourning, a 6-foot-10 center from Georgetown and the No.2 overall pick in the draft last June, could join the team sometime this week. However, the Hornets must first reduce their payroll to fit Mourning's first-season money under the NBA's $14 million per-team salary cap. 
One report said Mourning would get $2.5 million the first year. 
The Hornets have $1.96 mil­lion available under their salary cap this year. To sign him, they will need an additional $300,000-$500,000. 
They can do so by trading a player or renegotiating one or more contracts. The Hornets have discussed potential trades. 
Hornets owner George Shinn and John Thompson, Mourn­ing's college coach, expanded their roles in the talks last week, bringing the sides closer.

SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP)­Erving began his 16-year pro women in 1985. Julius Erving and Bill Walton, career with the Virginia Squires Bellamy, a 1961 graduate of 
by Atlanta O.C.
who met in the 1977 NBA Fi­of the American Basketball Indiana and member of the 
nals in which Portland upset Philadelphia, top a list of 10 players nominated for the Bas­ketball Hall of Fame. 
Walton, who led UCLA to two NCAA championships and Portland to the NBA title, and Erving were nominated in their first year of eligibility. Both re­tired in 1987. 
Also on the list announced Tuesday for consideration by the Honors Committee are Walt Bellamy, Richie Guerin, Dan Is­sei, Dick McGuire and Calvin Murphy, plus three women ­former UCLA and Olympic star Anne Meyers; Olympic and Eu­ropean standout Juliana Se­menova, and Eileen Banks Sprouse, an AAU star in the 1940s and 1950s. All except Semenova have been nominated before. 
Renominated as a contributor was Grady Lewis, a former pro­fessional player and coach, who helped develop the oxford bas­ketball shoe. 
A two-thirds vote of the 24­member honors committee is needed for induction. The en­shrinement ceremonies are scheduled for May 10. 
Erving, who is currently giving basketball clinics in Australia for the NBA, could not be immediately reached for com­ment. 
"He does pay attention to the Hall of Fame, but it's not something that we have ever discussed," said his business manager, Ray Wilson. "It's not the sort of thing you want to talk too much about, in case your (expectations) are prema­ture." 
After playing two years at the University of Massachusetts, Association in 1971. He was the league's most valuable player in 197 4 and 197 6 when he led the New York Nets to the ABA championship. 
In 1976, Erving, who is one of three players in pro basketball history to score more than 30,000 career points, joined the Philadelphia 76ers. An 11-time NBA All-Star, he was named the league's most valuable player in 1981 and led the 76ers to the 1983 NBA championship. 
Walton first attracted national attention at UCLA, where teams he played for lost only four games while winning 86 and two national championships. Among his big games was the 1973 final against Memphis State when Walton connected on 21 of the 22 shots. 
Nagging injuries slowed his 10-year professional career with the Portland Trail Blazers, the San Diego and Los Angeles Clippers and Boston Celtics. But in 1977, he helped lead the Trail Blazers to the NBA cham­pionship and was named the league's most valuable player in 1978. In 1986, he received the NBA's Sixth Man Award for coming off the bench to help the Celtics win the NBA title. 
Semenova, the 7-foot-6-inch center for the great Soviet women's basketball teams of the 1970s, was nominated by a special committee set up to honor the international game. She served this summer as vice president of the Latvian Olympic Committee. Meyers and Sprouse were tabbed by a special committee established last year to honor women.

Guerin, who scored 2,303 points for the New York Knicks in 1956, was the first NBA guard to break the 2,000-point mark in a season. Over his 13­year pro career, six of which were spent as player-coach for the St. Louis and later Atlanta Hawks he averaged 17.3 points a game and was named NBA Coach-of-the Year following the 196 7-68 season. 
Issei, now coach of the Denver Nuggets, averaged more than

McGuire, the Knicks' first­round draft choice in 1949 out of St. John's, had 2,950 assists in his 11-year pro career, in­cluding eight years with the Knicks and three years with Detroit. He later coached both the Pistons and the Knicks. 
Murphy, at 5-foot-9, was one of the first small men to make a big impact on the modern game. After averaging 33.1 points a game at Niagara Uni­versity, he collected 17,949 points during his 13 year pro career with the Rockets, scoring more than 1,000 points in 11 straight seasons.

Men's basketball plays a scrimmage 
DE AGUIAR By BRIAN KUBICKI 
Sports Writer 
Cheap Shots Coach John MacLeod and the Notre Dame men's 1-----------------4basketball team got a lot of
Electric Blue, 

Qu'.CkSI'Iver and Black Magic 
Walking past the sports apparel stores at the University Park Mall last weeek, I noticed a very disturbing trend. 
Michiana 's mall rats have left their Bulls gear at home. They've forgotten the San Jose Sharks and the Charlotte Hornets. This Christmas shopping season, the only colors I see are Electric Blue, Quicksilver, and Black Magic. 
Last June, when the Orlando Magic won the draft lottery, I transcended this vile world and entered my own personal heaven. Shaquille O'Neal would soon be playing in the 0-rena, and my days of embarrassment and shame about my pro basketball allegiances were instantly past. 
The little NBA ping-pong balls had fallen the right way, and several of my bizarre dreams about Shaquille O'Neal had strangely come true. I couldn't wait to see his 7-1, 301-pound body stuffed into the tacky Magic pinstripes. I couldn't wait to see him sending Rony Seikaly jumpers into the upper deck. 
I didn't have to hear about Mark Acres and Morlan Wiley and Michael Ansley and Sam Vincent anymore. Shaq was the biggest, baddest player to ever enter the NBA, and he made up for all of those journeymen. 
O'Neal's arrival precipitated a remarkable windfall in Magic paraphernalia. Almost overnight, every kid on the street was wearing Magic underwear. When I got to school, a personal survey showed that 73 percent of men at Notre Dame had bought a white Magic hat since June. All of them were on backwards. 
My Magical world had been turned upside-down. I used to be one of the 6 members of the Magic Fans' Support Group of Greater Michiana. As of November 2, the roster included 45,637 residents of the South Bend­Mishawaka area. 
But how many of them can sing the Magic theme song? How many of them can claim the autographs of the 24 original Magic Girls? How many of them can name the Magic mascot? 
All of those "fans" are poseurs, masquerading as believers in the Magic ethos. They try to believe in glitz and cheese. They try to appreciate the forced one-liners of Magic General Manager Pat Williams. 
But they can't do it. 
They don't know what it's like to be a part of the tourism capital of the world. They have no clue about living in the city with more hotel rooms than any other. 
How can they claim to support the Magic when they don't know what makes the Magic what it is? All Lakers fans understand Showtime. All Bears fans understand toughness. But few of the Magic's new-found fans have any clue about the magic in Orlando. Without being a part of the city, few ever will, arid I pity them. 
Hocus-pocus, Alakazaam, gonna set the spirit free! Orlando Magic, Orlando Magic, Orlando Magic, whoa. 
news about their future. yesterday. News of where they 
stand for the season, news of an injured player. and news of players yet to come. In the Blue-Gold Game, a series of five seven-minute in­trasquad scrimmages let the team and fans see how well the Irish can perform in game situations. "We want to run, but we can't run unless we have a solid defense," explained MacLeod of the game's slower, pass-oriented play. "(The players) are a little bit unsure, but they know what we want. Team play is paramount." He pointed out how the team moved the ball from side to side well and thus created scoring opportunities as an example of the players' response to the coaches' wish. But MacLeod was also quick to warn, "If we are to be successful, we'd better hustle and scrap." The inside play of his team is another concern for the coach. "Joe Ross needs to be strong and needs to be active," he explained and continued later, ''I'm not going to start (Malik Russell) in the point because we need him on the front court." 

Fencing team prepares to open season at Penn St. 
MacLeod was happy with some individual performances in the scrimmage as well, especially that of guard Lamarr Justice. 
"We wanted him to take it to the basket, and he did that tonight. lie doesn't shoot with the same consistency as (Elmer) Bennett, but he can drive to the hoop," he praised. 
The coach also commented on the development of forward Monty Williams who had sat out the previous two seasons with a heart condition. 
"Monty is doing well at the conditioning level but is not at the others' level. He is a very good athlete, so that will come. He also needs to get his defense squared away." 
The scrimmage also carried with it some dishea:rening news, as trainer Skip Meyer explained that freshman Keith Kurowski has a stress fracture of the navicular bone in his left foot and will be scheduled for surgery this weekend. 
"We are going to put a screw in the bone. He will be in a cast for at least two months," continued Meyer. "We don't anticipate him playing this season." 
If Kurowski does sit out the entire season, he will be eligi­ble to apply for a fifth-year of eligibility. 
MacLeod said that he was counting on Kurowski to be a scorer.

Notre Dame's top fencers will travel to Penn State University this weekend to compete in the Garret Penn State Open. 
This individual tournement will pit the nation's top collegiate fencers against one another and will provide the Notre Dame coaching staff with an opportunity to determine which fencers belong in which top positions when the season be­gins in January. 
Men's coach Mike DeCicco sees this meet as "a good yardstick for sorting out our top four or five fencers". 
With the best fencers from at least fifteen of last season's top twenty­finishing teams, the Penn St. Open should be an excellent means for DeCicco and women's coach Yves Auriol to finalize their teams' rankings. Just some of the teams sending representatives to this weekend's meet are 1992 NCAA Champion Columbia, 1992 NCAA runner-

up Penn State and third place finisher Yale University. 
Notre Dame will be sending a total of twenty competitors. Freshman Maria Panyi from Hungary, whose eligibilty was not determined until just this week, could be the nation's best women's foilist. Freshman Claudette de Bruin and senior Kathleen Vogt are likely to fill the number two and three spots in the women's foil this season. 
Senior Jeff Piper looks to lead the men's foil, and in the men's sabre, returning All-American James Taliferrio is expected to hold the number-one spot this season. 
"''m hoping he does well at this tournament," said DeCicco. 
In the epee event, potential number­one fencers junior Grzegorz Wozniak and senior Per Johnsonn will be among Notre Dame's representatives. 
Since practices began on October 17, the squad has been preparing to have another successful season after finishing fourth in last year's NCAA's. At this point, however, the focus is on determining exactly which fencers can do the job at which positions. 
As Coach DeCicco puts it, "We need to know who our top fencers are and how well they can compete against top fencers from around the country."

With only one match scheduled against each Midwestern Collegiate Conference opponent, every league contest is an important one for the Notre Dame volleyball team. 
Tonight's match is the biggest of all, as the Irish face conference frontrunner Loyola of Illinois in a battle of unbeatens

there is a lot riding on it. We would definitely like the first seed in the tournament, and we would also like to establish the fact that we are a better team. I really believe we are." 
The national rankings back up Brown's contention, with Notre Dame listed 21st in the AVCA coaches' poll. Loyola is unranked, but that gives the Ramblers added incentive: they must win the MCC tournament to have any chance at moving on to the NCAA. 
Loyola finished second to Notre Dame in last season's MCC race, and they added fresh talent to the experienced squad which returns. Last year's MCC Player of the Year, Julie McShane, is back to handle the setting duties for fellow returning starters Lori Miller and Therese O'Neill, both senior hitters. First-year player Missy Satorelli, who has further enhanced the hitting attack, was named last week's MCC Player of the Week. Brown, however, is more con­cerned with Loyola's play on the other side of the net. 
"Like most teams in the conference, their strength is on defense," the coach explained. "Most of the teams have the attitude that the ball is not going to hit the floor, and Loyola is no exception." 
Brown has observed what she feels is a soft spot in that defense, however, and her team will be concentrating on attacking in the middle. Middle hitters Jessica Fiebelkorn, Molly Stark. and Cynthia May are expected to be successful against the Ramblers. 
"A number of things have to happen for us to do that, though," Brown cautioned. "We will have to play good defense and our passing must be on." 
Whatever happens, this matchup should showcase the kind of excellent volleyball one would expect from two top-notch teams who are ready to peak for the post-season. 
"There is no doubt," Brown said, "that both teams will be fired up and playing at the top of their game."
