Past sales affect Bowl allotment 
by Jim Coyne 
According to Ticket Manager Michael Busick, the number of student tickets alloted for the Cotton Bowl game was arrived at by checking past bowl game sales. Busick stated that for the last six post-season contests involving Notre Dame, an average of 1475 student tickets had been sold. 
In 1970, when Notre Dame played Texas in the Cotton Bowl, 858 student tickets were sold. The following year, when the two teams met again, 1335 student tickets were sold. Even in 1973, when Notre Dame met Alabama in the Sugar Bowl for the National Cham­pionship, only 1400 student tickets were sold. 
The total number of tickets alloted to the university by the Cotton Bowl is 12,000. The remaining 10,500 tickets are pres­ently being made available to Notre Dame staff, faculty, and contribu­ting alumni. 
Busick stated that students mayI 'I purchase tickets at the designated ',. time at a special reduced price. He 
stressed, however, that they may buy tickets at this time only for "their own personal use." The checking of student identification cards at the Cotton Bowl will be "strictly enforced," Busick said. ·'They will be checking faces," he

Report takes 'flexibleapproach' in testing morality of sexu~l acts . 
by Tony Pace Features Editor 
Editor's note: This is the first of a three part series on the human sexuality study com­missioned by the Catholic The­ological Society. Today's first part deals with what the report itself says and the reaction of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops to ft. 
"It departs from the Church's traditional do's and don'ts about sex and takes a more flexible approach by assessing the morality of sexual acts on a case-by-case basis." This is how a recent Associated Press story summarized the much-publicized report, Hu­man Sexuality: New Directions in American Catholic Thought. The report allows for the possibility that certain acts such as masturbation, pre-marital sex, and contraception 

EXCUSE 
The Observer regrets the tardiness of the paper this week and would like to explain the problem. 
IJiness within the printing staff of our printer, the Penny Saver, has set back their pro­duction schedule. The slowdown is reflected in the later delivery of the Observer. The printer is trying to solve the problem as quickly as possible. We hope you will add to your prayers the return to the Penny Saver of Christopher Smith, page nega­tive developer and plate de­veloper of the printing staff. 
may be morally acceptable in certain instances. 
The study was written by a five person commitee of the Catholic Theological Society of America (CTSA). The CTSA takes into account not only the traditional Christian teachings, but also em­pirical evidence when it makes its claims. 
Anthony Kosnik, a Detroit priest and professor of moral theology, chaired the committee that wrote the report. He was assisted by William Carroll, Agnes Cunning­ham, Ronald Modras, and Jane Schulte. Only Carroll, a professor of law at the John Marshal School

of the clergy. 
The CTSA initially commissioned the report in 1972 with the inten­tion, as expressed in the report's foreward, of having it "contribute to the further reflection and discus­sion that is called for on a topic of such moral and pastoral signifi­cance." Since its publication last spring, it has been the subject of 
much controversy and debate. 
Although the CTSA did commis­sion the report and arrange for its publication, the foreward further states ''these actions imply neither the approval not the disapproval by the Society or its Board of Directors of the contents of the report.'' 
The fact that the report tends toward a more subjective evalua­tion of sexual acts and away from the "traditional do's and don'ts" stems mainly from two tenets. First, it denies that the traditional prohibitions concerning sex, which have arisen from Biblical interpre­tations and have been fostered 
throughout Christian history are true moral absolutes. 
A portton of th~ ope~t.ng sec~10n of the report, entitled The Btble ~.nd !fuman Sexuali~,'' reads,

the demand for tickets exceeds the supply, "a lottery will be held," Busick stated, and ''we will shuffle the applications, and pull out the losers." 
If these people do not exaust their allotment, the remaining tickets will be made available to students, who may then purchase them for their family and friends. At the same time, if the students do not exaust their supply, the re­maining tickets will be made available to staff, faculty, and alumni. An announcement will be made to this effect on Dec. 12.

Hesburgh holds forum 
by Mike Kenahan Staff Reporter 

Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, University president, entertained an audience of around 150 people in a question and answer session last night at Planner Hall. Hes-­burgh answered questions for a­bout one hour on foreign, national, and University related topics. 
Hesburgh's appearance on the scene was greeted with a round of applause from the mostly male gathering. Notre Dame's president started the forum off by apologiz­ing for being late. He was schedul­ed to arrive at 11 p.m., but did not appear until 25 minutes later. 
Out of the 18 questions that Hesburgh fielded, a major portion of them were concerned with the United States policy on the trans­fer of aid and knowledge to Third World countries. The reason for this was most likely due to the fact that Hesburgh was sworn in this past Tuesday as a U.S. ambassador to the 1979 United Nations confer­ence on Science and Technology Development. 
One of Hesburgh's major activi­ties with that position will be addressed at developing an ade­quate policy on America's transfer of technology to poorer developed sity of Texas' ticket office said that their school had been allotted 15,500 tickets, of which between 5-6,000 were set aside for students. 
The spokesperson also said that Notre Dame had been sent 12,049 tickets, not 12,000 as reported by Busick. The Cotton Bowl, located in Dallas, seats 72,000. 
In a related issue, Kris Quann, secretary of the Hall President's Council, confirmed that a survey had been taken in the halls, "on the spur of the moment,'' to check on student ticket demands. 
With approximately half of the halls at Notre Dame reporting, about 1 ,000 students expressed a desire to purc:.ase tickets. All of the halls at St. Mary's reported, with about 500 students wishing to buy tickets. Consequently, at the present time, the student demand 
already exceeds their allotment. 
countries. Hesburgh described his position as being personally very important. ''A chance like that comes along once in a lifetime," he stated. He also noted that, "this is a chance to really make a bite into that policy and to have a fairly large say into what it's going to be." 
In answer to the question of why the U.S. should be spending money on the foreign poor when there are still a lot of domestic problems, Hesburgh explained that the U.S. actually has the resources to take care of both areas. He said that the basic Christian philosophy of help­ing one's neighbor was reason enough for America to aid destitute nations. 
He also noted that the reason why the U.S. does not do more was basically political. "The means are there, but we don't have the political will," Hesburgh said. 
In answer to a question on his stance on abortion, Hesburgh re­sponded by saying it is "a problem that is difficult." He said that he is currently working on the problem through his association with the Rockefeller Foundation. He stated that he believed the solution to the problem was in trying to find a wide variety of birth control me­thods that would be perfectly moral

Sociology group recommends new women's health care center 
by Cathy Murray 
A women's health care center, to be located on St. Mary's campus, is being proposed in a project by students in the Methods of Social Work class, taught by Charles Martucci, associate professor of sociology. 
The idea began when Martucci assigned his students a project which involved the examination and resolution of a social problem. The 21 students agreed that the ND-SMC community needed a health clinic that dealt with the subject of human sexuality. 
The group, called St. Ma.rv's 
Rukavina: abolish Student Assembly 
by Caroline Moore 
Mary Rukavina, student body president, called for the disbanding of the Student Assembly at the St. Mary's Board of Governance meet­ing last night. 
Rukavina, who also heads the Student Assembly and the Board of Governance, explained that the Student Assembly "is not an integral part of student govern­ment." "The Student Assembly is not an articulate group, and it does not serve a purpose," she added. 
Rukavina said, "I am giving serious consideration to certain parts of student government. This might involve re-defining the roles or developing a new or different structure.'' 
Suggestions included abolishing the Student Assembly and incor­porating its members into either the Board of Governance or the Hall President's Council. 
No longer will she continue as head of the Student Assembly meeting, Rukavina said. Instead, the two vice presidents of the Executive Board, KathyO'Connell and Cathy Hedges, will run them. 
When asked for comments, some members ofthe Board were a5ainst abolishing the Student Assembly since they felt that the more input into student govenment, the great­er student support would be. 
Judy Eckelcamp, LeMans Hall president and a former member of the Student Assembly, said, "In previous years the Student As­sembly took an active role in student government, often havin~

Action Committee, elected Mary Hadlock, a Notre Dame junior, as their chairperson. 
Hadlock told the Observer that the committee has spent the last two and a half months putting together a "correct survey." Dur­ing this time, the committee divid­ed into three subgroups. These groups dealt with the writing of a survey, its distribution, and the organization of a coalition commit­tee. 
The survey, containing 24 ques­'tions on the sexuality of both men and women, will be distributed next week. The survey will also provide students a chance to add 
five or six proposals to deal with each meeting." 
One feeling was that the Student Assembly should be given more identity, and stregthened as an active part of student government. Nancy Mogab, Senior Class presi­dent, noted that if the Student Assembly was abolished or incor­porated into the Board of Govern­ance, it would cut down on student representation. 
Hedges advised caution in taking permanent steps. "Just because there are conflicts this year, this might not be true next year or five years," she said. 
In other business at last night's meeting, Mary Ann Fuchs, co-exchange commissioner, handed in her resignation, effective Dec. 23.

comments and suggestions. 
According to Hadlock, "It's really incredible, the taboos. People still don't believe venereal disease exists." The proposed center would deal with venereal disease as well as other problems such as human sexuality, rape and assault, personal hygiene, and contraceptive information. 
The center also hopes to provide a 24 hour phone service and walk-in center, a gynecologist on duty around the clock and referral services. 
Kathleen Rice, dean of Student Affairs at St. Mary's, has been notified of the committee's project and survey. 
She will be taking a leave of absence from St. Mary's to study abroad. Rukavina thanked her for her hard work. 
A St. Mary's alumna announced she would like to set up a scholarship fund. The means for 
raising the money would come from the possible raffle of a rug bearing the St. Mary's insignia. The pattern for the rug has a patent on it, and there is only one copy of this pattern. It presently hangs in the Reidinger Hous at St. Mary's. 
Jeannie Ritter, spiritual commis­sioner, announced a Christmas get together. A dinner and mass has been planned for up to 25 students. 
Those interested should call Jeannie at 4945 for more informa­tion.

The assemblage of Arab leaders in Tripoli, particularly President Hafez Assad of Syria, was a symbolic victory for Khadafy's oil-financed Arab revolutionary brand of leadership opposed to any concessions to Israel. 
But Assad, distinctly more moderate than his mercurial host in his approach to Middle East peace prospects, showed reluctance to get involved in any extremist outburst. 
"It is natural that when a nation faces a danger, the faithful sons call to meet and work to prevent the catastrophe which is about to take place," he said on arrival. 
Though he reaffirmed Syria's refusal to attend peace talks with Israel in Cairo, Assad avoided any mention of Sadat or the bitter Arab criticism Egypt has faced since the Jerusalem journey. 
President Houari Boumedienne of Algeria was the first to land at the former Wheelus U.S. Air Base, now Khadafy's military airport for Tripoli. 
He was followed by Palestinian chieftain Yasir Arafat and Assad several hours later. President Salem Rabayiah Aly of South Yemen also was scheduled to attend. 
Iraq, which vies with Libya for leadership in the radical Arab camp, dispatched a five-man dele­gation, headed by Taha Yassin Ramadan Getrawi of the ruling Revolutionary Command Council and including Foreign Minister Saadoun Hamadi.

the establishment of an area shelter for battered women. "One estimate says that half of American women are getting slugged," she stated. In addition, the committee safeguards the rights of women in the criminal justice system. 
Education is the Commission's fourth basic concern. Kolben­schlag cited the sexism which often permeates testbooks chosen for the 
Indiana  school  systems.  "I'm  
hoping  we  can  appeal  to  state  
government  to  eliminate  those  

which promote stereotyped female roles and language," she said. 
Because of her status as a nun actively involved in the women's movement, Kolbenschlag referred to herself as "a Christian femi­nist." "I fail to see how anyone who has absorbed the Gospel in both its traditional and prophetic implications cannot be a feminist," she stated. •'.St. Paul wrote to the Galations, 'There does not exist among you Jew or Greek, slave or freeman, male or female.' I'm not sure that even Paul realized what he was saying." 
Kolbenschlag is currently writing a book to be published in late 1978 which chronicles •'the obstacles facing women in their development to full personhood." In addition to her membership in the National and Michigan Wo­men's Study Associations, she serves on the Board of Associates for the Women • s Institution for Freedom of the Press. 
Her research tracing the origins andtransmission of "a stereotypical 
sexual mythology" is to be offered 
next semester. Kolbenschlag also 
described as "in an embryonic 
stage'' the efforts of a small group 
of faculty members to organize an 
interdisciplinary committee for wo­
men's studies.

A vile, wretched and generally all-around low-life person broke into The Observer office sometime early Wednesday morning and absconded with a priceless potted palm tree. NOT ONLY THAT, but further vandalism occurred as the renowned Observer candy jar was viciously knocked from its resting place atop the offices' front counter. Inside sources believe the two acts were perpetrated by the same des­picable rat. They theorize the jar was dealt its cruel fate as the intruder was removing the palm tree. Observer officials said they would do everything possible to catch the fink, believing as they do in truth, justice and the American way. [Photo by Ken McAlpine. Cutline by Bob Brink.]

IN DOLBY STEREOPHONIC SOUND 

LOS ANGELES [AP] -Scientists announced yesterday that for the first time they have succeeded in using artificial genes to "order" a bacterium to produce a hormone normally found only in higher animals. 
The breakthrough, hailed as a "scientific triumph of the first order" by the head of the National Academy of Sciences, paves the way for cheaper, purer insulin and other hormone-based medicines. 
The researchers were working in the controversial new field of genetic engineering using recombi­nant DNA -deoxyribonucleic acid ­the material within chromosomes that contains the genetic code. 
The scientists said they implanted an artificial gene carry­ing "blueprints" for a hormone called somatostatin into a bacter­ium, and the bacterium obediently manufactured the specified hor­mone. 
Hormones are the body's chemi­cal messengers. Insulin, a vital hormone that helps the body use carbohydrates, normally is pro­duced in the pancreas. Diabetics, however, do not produce enough and need it supplied to them. 
Scientists say it is now just a matter of time before protein substances like insulin can be

._..;.;.;....,.-.-...-..;;;.;;;;;._;..;.,;,;;;,;;.;;~--..a..----------------_. 
produced by this artificial gene process or one related to it. The medicines would be made to order in living bacteria "factories." 
Earlier this year, a gene carrying instructions to produce insulin was implanted into a bacterium, but the scientists did not succeed in "switching on" the gene to initiate the manufacture of insulin. 
But researchers at the City ot Hope National Medical Center in suburban Duarte were recently able to link a man-made gene with the proper control elements that turned on the hormone-making process. 
A sketchy report of the success came unexpectedly Nov. 2 at a Senate hearing in Washington on guidelines for research on recom­binant DNA. Some scientists feel the research, also known as gene splicing, could produce dangerous new forms of life. 
Details of the dramatic achieve­ment were withheld until yesterday when the researchers' paper was accepted for publication in the magazine Science. 
Authors of the paper are Keiichi Itakura, Tadaaki Hirose, Roberto Crea and Arthur D. Riggs of the City of Hope. and Herbert L. Heyneker, Fruncisco Bolivar and 
IHerbert W. Boyer of the University of California at San Francisco. Somatostatin is a chemical mes­senger that inhibits the release of 
·other hormones in the body. Being investigated as a form of treatment for diabetes and growth disorders, somatostatin has heretofore been obtainable only by extracting it from animal brains or synthesizing it chemically. Somatostatin or other biological products made by the bacterial process would ul­timately be cheaper and probably 
purer, said Riggs.

letters to a lonely God 
No Pie in the Sky for Tim 
Reverend Robert Griffin 
My memories of dinner conversations, seated with Seniors at tables in the University Club, are apt to be very imperfect. I know that somewhere between my first drink (a double Manhat­tan) and my second drink ( a single Manhattan) words trip off my tongue as gracefully as though they were ballet dancers doing Swan Lake with Nijinska. Only rarely is there a third drink, because, dammit, I am not a lush; and in that third drink lie the slurred word, the Dutch courage, and the tiresome tales that the tipsy man tells, making him seem a hero in no man's eyes but his own. After that first drink, I am brilliant, no doubts about it. Unfortuantely, my best lines seem to get swept up with the cherry stems. With the arrival of cold sobriety, insights that could have ruled an empire lie interred in the graveyards of amnesia. 
Last night, there were conversations with Seniors at a University Club table. This morning, as usual, my recollections are fuzzy; but I remember, with astonish­ment, we talked of God; and it was not I who made first mention of my Redeemer's name. It was Brian, whom I designated as the mystic of his off-campus household because he was more believing than the others, who said: 
"It is hard to think that only Catholics are going to heaven; and all the other guys, no matter how good they are, are gonna go to hell." 
"My word, young sir," I said, gagging on cheese and cracker at the theology being irresponsibly linked to the name of the all-tolerant Trinity, "Where did you ever get such a limited notion?" 
"The nuns," he said, "in grade school. They always told us stuff like that." Kevin and Tim nodded their heads in agreement; their nuns in grade. school had always taught them stuff like that also." 
"Some kids," said Brian, "you weren't supposed to play with. They had the wrong religion." 
"They weren't going to make it for pie in the sky," said Tim, staring into empty space. Tim wasn't sure there was going to be a sky for anyone to have pie in. Tim, in his own way, may be a mystic too, but he needs better evidence for eternity than anything he's read lately in the opinions of 
the Pope. 
"Why can't God have different sons," said Peter. Peter --a Catholic lacking assurance, a skeptic with faith in his veins--wants to be on both sides of the same high fence. "Why does Jesus gotta be His only son? Why can't Buddha be God's son. Why can't Mohammed and Confucius be God's sons." I thought: Peter doesn't need to know whose son Buddha is; Peter needs to know whose son Peter is." 
"Does it make any difference who God's son is?" said Brian. "Does it really matter what you believe, if you live good, and do the best you can, and don't hurt anybody. How do Catholics know that they're right, and everyone else is wrong, and only Catholics make it to heaven?" 

"You really can't know if Catholics are right or wrong," said Kevin. "It's just a matter of Catholics having their opinion, and Protestants having their opinion, and guys like Tim and me having no opinion at all." 
I was beginning to feel a little sorry for myself: one single priest matched against four representative doubters from the Senior Class. One priest, his head swimming with alcohol, staring at the bottom of his glass, drained too quickly after a day when he was very tired. Three skeptics and a mystic with doubts, with whom the priest wanted to be very honest; but in the vino he had drunk, what veritas? 0 Manhattans, would you fail me now? 
"I would not have dreamed," I said sincerely, "ofbeginning this conversation; I would not have imposed God on you, or dogma. I would not have preached, but you invite me to preach. 
"We're opportunists," said Brian. "We want to pick your brain." 
"These questions," said Tim, "are questions we often ask each other at home. Now we ask them of you.;' 
"First of all, then, let me say about the nuns: they may have taught you that the Catholic faith teaches truth as God's Son revealed it. I hope thev never told you anyone would go to hell. ­
"Hell," said Kevin. "It was all some of them ever talked about.'' 
"Ifbeing in God and with Him in heaven is a mystery--and it is a great mystery; St. Paul says eye has not seen, nor ear heard, the things God has prepared for those who love Him--then not being with God, choosing not to have Him forever--is equally mysterious. There would be an emptiness inside us that we would mourn 
The Fantastick Student Players 
In the early hours of an October Saturday morning, the sounds of hammers and saws echoed down the dark, empty corridors of Moreau Hall. Behind O'Laughlin's mas­sive stage, four people were building a large wooden structure. At the same time, one mile away behind a locked door in the 
basement  of  LaFortune,  a  half  dozen  
people  huddled  around  an  old  piano  
carefully  reading  notes  and  repeating  

apparently important phrases. 
But rest easy; no e.vil machine was being constructed in O'Laughlin, nor did crazed fanatics conspire in LaFortune to bring rebellion to the peaceful campus. These activities were only some of the prepara­tions for the Student Players' production of The Fantasticks. Stage Manager Steve Fantano and his crew worked long hours &or two weeks building the huge collapsible stage in the SMC theater's scene shop. Three times a week since the first day of school, the cast, led by director Louis Spisto, rehearsed their songs and dances in LaFortune's basement and sometimes in Crowley Hall. 
On one Sunday in Crowley, play rehear­sal had been going on for an hour. After listening to the four main characters sing "This Plum Is Too Ripe," Spisto decided that the lower voices were too powerful. "It doesn't sound right. Jules, I think you should sing your part an octave higher." Cathy Heisler, lead female singer and musical director of the show, said, "No, no it's right." The others agreed, "That's the way it sounds on the record." More discussion and assertive opinions followed, but with no compormise. The music was consulted, and Spisto was found to be correct. He walked back to his seat, acknowledging non-existent applause with waving hands, saying, "Lou Spisto who knows nothing about music ... Thank you, thank you." 
Later, Steve Rodgers and Spisto sang their duet "I Can See It." Heisler, cringing, said, "Lou, your harmony is all wrong." 
"I know," replied Spisto, "I haven't been able to practice this one much." 
"No excuses. Just do it right. And Steve, are you still going to voice lessons?" You better go over this one with your 
teacher." 
Rodgers nodded in reply and turned away, singing "I can't sing it" to the tune of "I Can See It." Frustrated and tired, Heisler dropped into a seat, saying, "Lou, I quit. Just find someone else for your show.'' Spisto, looking at the music on the piano, indefferently replied, "Okay." Everyone laughed, and the tension disap­peared. 
The tension that often arose during the rehearsals was to be expected. Directing Each member of the cast was talented, dedicated, and interested in contributing to the show. For many The Fantasticks was a personal favorite, and others were high school veterans of the musical. "Everyone had his conceptions of the music, the characters, and the style of the play; and no one wanted to compromise," explained Heisler. But Spisto let everyone have his say, considered the suggestions, and tempered his final decisions with his Staten 
Island humor. 
"Are we going to use real plums, Lou?" "If they're cheap that week, we'll get them." 
Before starting the last week of rehearsal on the new stage in Washington Hall, when everyone was nervously wondering whether all the pieces of the show would fit together in time, Spisto laid his feelings on the line: 
"Tonight we fix up everything that need fixing up. But let's be realistic about it. I'm in this show to have a good time. Ifthe show is good, then that makes me happier. The whole thing is not to be perfect; we can't be perfect, but we can try hard. The main thing is to have fun; and in the long run, things will be better. 
"But so far this show is neither here nor there for me. There's no sense of companionship yet. People are in this only for themselves. Let's change that. If we aren't a good group of friends, we should be. If we don't get any enjoyment out of this, then let's not do it. 
"There's been a lot of tension; let's leave that behind. Things will get tough and tight this last week as it is. Whenever I yell, I'm not yelling at you personally,. but at you as the part you play. If you are sincere and do your best, that's great. 
"So let's have fun while we work. If we like each other off stage, it will show on stage. I want a good time. I don't want a pain in my stomach opening night. Let's get along and relax." 
With these words the real work began. The tension faded as friendships grew. Everyone began to realize that within a week's time, he would be up on that stage facing crowds of over 200 people. No one wanted to be alone in such a situation. They wanted the support and the confi­dence inspired by friends. Survival and success demanded a team effort. 
Every night for one week, with rehear­sals often lasting over four hours, the cast and crew did work as a team. Members of the cast helped the crew set up the huge portable stage. Pianist Lisa Murray and actors Stever Rodgers and Jules Thompson took turns on the piano, entertaining the crew as they worked. And while the cast ran through the show, crew members followed along in the script, prompting forgotten lines, ran .to the Huddle to get 

bu•g!!~' ~,?.~oc~:,~~! ~~~~~ 
trial audience. After rehearsal cast 
members stuck around to help adjust lights 
and paint the stage. 
Opening night finally came, with the crew pounding last minute nails into the stage. The cast waited in the wings, hyped tip with nervous energy and excitement. Not only was Rodgers hyped up, he was doped up with about $15 worth of cold medicines to combat a voice-stifling sore throat. "I was so OD'ed on NyQuil, Contact, and Listerine, I had to use smelling salts and inhalators between scenes to keep myself going." During intermission pianist Murray checked to see why four keys of her piano suddenly died and found a wet dust rage lodged between the hammers and the strings. But the show went on. On those first Friday and Saturday nights, the cast played to enthusiastic audiences. 
With two performances under the belt and the end in sight, everyone was relaxed 
for the final rehearsal before the last two 
shows. Jules set the mood for the evening 
by banging out honky-tonk piano tunes. 
Spisto silently mimicked Heisler as she 
sang one of her solos. Laughter inter­
rupted many a scene. Dan Cole smugly 
refused to participate in one scene. His 
partner Don Murphy embellished his lines 
to encourage the stubborn Cole: "Fetch 
my doublet, you son of a bitch." And when 
Cole, billed as the "Man Who Dies," refused to die, Murphy eagerly volun­teered to help him accomplish the task. The fun in those minutes helped make all the months of hard work worthwhile. 
The best reward, however, was the applause of the four audiences which totalled over 900 people. The atmosphere of Washington Hall demanded a profes­sional production. In the past the Student Players presented their shows in the intimate confines of the Nazz. But with The Fantastlcks, they took on the challenge of Washington Hall using sophisticated lighting and staging. The applause testified to their success in presenting both an entertaining and professional show. "But all that really counted," said Heisler, "was that the audience walked out of the theater happy." 
Being in a show such as The Fantastlcks was an opportunity which many people sought. Cathy Buzard weathered the "frantic" audition and the three hour call-back of last semester to be given the challenging role of the Mute. "I embel­lished the character all along," said Buzard. "I tried, through mime and expression only, to create the mood of each scene. The experience did much to 
increase my confidence on the stage." Jules Thompson s&id, "The play allowed a part of me. certain talents, to be devel­over perpetually. The regret would tease us so much it would be like a fire in the brain, with the nerve ends of our con­science twisted as though it were being gnawed by everlasting worms. It would be a horror that some theologians doubt God would ever subject us to. No one, not even the Pope, has the right to give out a housing list to Hades, because no one knows at what point of our selfishness God's grace can interrupt and overcome our dull choices. Hell is something we do --' ourselves. Even when we try to do it to ourselves, we can't know that God will let us--or anyone--be successful." 
"In a world," said Tim, "where nuns 
and priests contradict each other, does it 
really matter what you believe?" 
"You can believe that the world is flat," I said, ''but if you are going to travel around the world, it's a comfort to know you won't fall off the edge. When you consider the empty spaces between the stars, and feel the terror of being specks of dust, it is a comfort to believe that God so loved the world, He sent His only Son." 
"I wouldn't know," said Tim. "I've never heard from Him."

Somewhere between the first drink and the second drink, I become brilliant. I'm only sorry I can't remember how beauti­fully I explained to Brian how Catholics know they are right more times than Protestants are right, and bow Protestants and Catholics, in their Christianity, are closer to the truth than Buddhists, Moham­medans, and Confucianists; and how those latter sects are right only sometimes, when they hap?en to agree with Catholics. How sad it is, when you've been brilliant, to have to live afterwards with imperfect memories.

loped. I never had the chance before." 
To give students that chance was exactly why the Student Players was formed. Three years ago Lou Spisto and his friend Jeff Pecore decided to form an informal theater company within which interested students could become directors, actors, set designers, choreographers, and stage managers, and have fun too. "We felt that there was a need for more theater on campus. A lot of people have talent, but hav~ no chance to perform." So along with Steve Fantano, Spisto and Pecore founded the Student Players, and with their own money, time and effort presented Star­Spangled Girl their sophomore year. 
With this show's success, the Student Players gained a budget from the Student Union, a reliable crew, and more responsi­bility to provide entertainment for the growing audiences. In the following semesters, the Players presented Jacques Brei Is Alive and WeD, Play It Again, Sam, and now The Fantasticks. Pecore is tentatively planning to produce Neil Simon's Come Blow Your Hom for next semester in the Nazz. And Spisto, now a senior, intends to interview interested students in taking control of the Student Players after the founders have graduated. 
''The Student Players is vital to the ND community," said Jack Boehm, actor in The Fantastlcks. "It shows that students can work together, take a personal interest in and care about doing something, and pleased with the result.'' Spisto said, 'The Student Players was an idea that worked; it worked because We busted our asses to make it work.". ·

Discotheque extraordinaire 

by Patrick Cole 
"Cinnebar's is a name I came across when I was a kid--I read this story about a fox. So that's where it came from. Names have a ring to them. You can always tell if a place is what it is by the name." 
Several years and $200,000 later, the name of that red fox has become South Bend's newest hot­spot, nightspot and entertainment spot. Located in downtown South Bend a few sidewalks from the River Bend Plaza, J. Michael

I 
Woodward. the owner of Cinne­bar's, has made a fox come alive as a discoteques that can make a first visit nothing less than an eye­opening experience. 

I 
Woodward. who has lived in South Bend all his life, decided to build a discoteque-entertainment center last December. He and his partner and brother-in-law, Steve Mitchell, decided they wanted to go into business. So they decided to take out a lease on the JMS building in downtown South Bend. 
Who is your average Cinnebar's frequenter? The discoteque attracts a wide variety of clientel, according to Woodward. Usually, a Cinnebar disco fanatic is 25 to 30 years old. "More of the sophisti­cated people come here," Wood­ward observed. "That sounds kind of snobbish but it's true. It's the best mixed crowd around--all kinds come here. A person can come here and not get roughed up." 


And if 800 to 1,000 people make it to Cinnebar's on a given week­end, there must be something appealing to it. On first visit, everyone travels through the mag­nificent octagon-shaped tunnel e:-:trance. Sheets of mirrors line the inner part of the tunnel.

If you don't know how to dance to 
the disco tunes, Cinnebar's has a solution for that. Monday through Thursday dance lessons are given from 8 to 9 p.m. On Tuesday and Thursday nights, Dance World, a group of professional dance instructors handle the teaching duties. 
A popular attraction on the weekends has been the dance contest on Fridays at midnight. Backgammon lessons are given on Monday nights from 8 p.m. to closing. 
In the future, Woodward would like to attract more college students to the club. "We plan on having a Notre Dame Night or IUSB Night just for the students," he said. And he hopes to see Cinnebar's remain as a lace where eo le can come to dance. "We would like to keep Cinnebar's disco-oriented," Woodward said. "If disco declines, we'll use live entertain­ment. Also we want to remain downtown and eventually coordi­nate with the Red Door Club," he said. Woodward is also the owner of the Red Door Club. 

Regardless of what the future holds for Cinnebar's, right now, Woodward is content with the club's immediate success and appeal. According to Woodward, word of mouth has been most effective in letting people know about South Bend's new night-time entertainment center. "Some people can't believe it when they see the place," Woodward remarked. 
Cennebar's is open from 8 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. Monday through Saturday and is open one Sunday of the month.

to apply with any kind of precision 
or assurance." "Similarly," the 
statement continued, "the sexual 
values proposed (the seven values 
derived from the creative and 
integrative principles offer little 
guidance. By abandoning norms 
which make specific demands, the 
report reaches the conclusion that 
sexual activity outside of marriage 
can be permissible and even virtu­

Although the doctrinal commit­

the whole conference, an Associ­

When asked how he would go about subduing ldi Amin, Hes­burgh answered that, "I'd like to take him on myself, but I can't think of any moral way to do it.'' He added to a laughing audience that from all reports he under­stands Amin to be "a pretty bad fellow.' • Hesburgh stated in a more serious tone, however, that there are legal and political means, "and certainly I'd try to do something short ofkilling. I don't like political assassinations'' 
Concerning campus topics, Res­burgh was asked to address a number of familiar areas, including co-ed dorms, student freedom, and faculty salaries. 
On the issue of co-ed dorms at Notre Dame, Hesburgh was stead­fast in his opinion. "I think we have 
[continued from page 1] behavior, regardless of circum­stances, must likewise bear the burden of proof." 
This position is later qualified by the statement, "Scripture provides us with certain fundamental themes as a basis on which to construct a modern theology of human sexuality." 
In tracing the evolution of Chris­tian tradition concerning sexuality, the authors cite the importance of the "Declaration on Certain Ques­tions Concerning Sexual Ethics." This 1975 document, issued by the Sacred Congregation for the Doc­trine of the Faith, develops a principle which links sexuality with personal growth and integration in society. "The application of this principle," the authors state, "re­jects both the extremely subjective criterion of sincere intention alone as well as the exaggerated objec­tive criterion of act alone as unacceptable." 
The last quotation is also part of the second major tenet which the authors rely on to aevelop their less absolute moral framework. This principle is that an individual's actions should not be evaluated in and of themselves, but in relation to the whole of his or her life. This is summarized, ·"In short, we 
.maintain that it is appropriate to ask whether specific sexual be­havior realizes certain values that are conducive to the creative growth and integration of the human person.'' 
In addition, the authors list seven values which they believe to be crucial to the evaluation of sexual behavior. These values are: self-liberating, other-enriching, honest, faithful, socially responsi­ble, life-serving, and joyous. 
These values "are not meant to serve as a check-list, the full and complete presence of which will guarantee wholesome sexual ex­pression." 
The overriding principle, from which these values are derived, is one of "creative growth toward integration." This differs from

what the authors describe as the 
"procreative and unitive" principle 
which the Church has used to 
establish certain moral values. 
The principle which the authors put forward allows the possibility for certain acts, which are con­demned by the Church, to be morally acceptable. However, the report points out, ''...the burden of proof that departure from the norm will nonetheless be creative and integrative not only for the indivi­duals involved but for the larger community as well rests with those who choose to make the excep­tion." 
Through the creative and inte­grative principle and the seven values which are derived from it, the authors develop pastoral guide­lines which involved some subjec­tivity and allow the possibility that certain types of sexual acts, tradi­tionally condemned by the Church, may be morally acceptable in certain contexts. Masturbation, contraception, homosexuality, and pre-marital sex all fall under this heading. 
Although the report issues no moral absolutes, the authors indi­cate that other types of sexual behavior may need to meet more rigorous criteria in order. to be accepted. This is because the authors believe certain forms of sexual behavior would be destruc­tive rather than creative and inte­grative in the vast number of cases. 

Examples of the forms of sexual behavior which the authors ques­tion with regard to their "creative and integrative" value are swing­ing and adultery. The authors say, "swinging seems destructive and alienating and therefore generally dehumanizing." The authors define adultery as "illicit inter­course between a married person and someone other than the mar­riage partner" and remark " ...an overall assessment of the variant forms of extramarital relationships leads us to counsel extreme cau­tion. Such relationships generally fail in their ability to be other­enriching." 
No Absolute Prohibitions 

The report has been condemned because it does not make any absolute prohibitions of any form of sexual activity. On Nov. 16, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' doctrinal commitee con­demned the report. In this statement, the bishops described the report as "pastorally danger­ous."

Carter plans 7-country winter trip to begin Dec. 29 
WASHINGTON [AP] • President 

Carter's once-postponed four­
continent trip was split officially 
yesterday into a less-hectic journey 
beginning Dec. 29 to Europe, India 
and the Middle East and a second 
trip in the spring to Brazil, Nigeria 
and Venezuela. 
White House Press Secretary Jody Powell said there also was a likelihood that an economic summit would be held in Bonn in the spring, which Carter would attend, but no announcement has been made. 
The nine-day winter trip will t~embine meetings with leaders in Poland, Iran, India, Saudi Arabia, France and Belgium as well as stops at well-known memorials. 
Powell described it as "primarily a working trip" to areas of the world important to the United States economically and militarily. 
Carter will dine New Year's Eve with the Shah of Iran in Tehran, hold a news conference in Poland ­the first such session by a U.S. president in a Communist country ­and visit the beaches where Allied troops landed in France during World War II. 
He also will address the Indian parliament in New Delhi, where he will talk with Prime Minister Morarji Dessai; meet with Saudi Arabian leaders in Riyadh; attend a state dinner at Versailles, outside of Paris, and stop in Brussels on his way back to Washington on Jan. 6. 
The White House did not give any dates for the trip to Brazil, Venezuela and Nigeria. Powell left open the possibility it might be expaned to other nations in Latin 
America and Africa. 
Carter originally was scheduled 

to begin an 11 day journey on Nov. 
22 to each of the countries on the 
winter trip, along with Venezuela, 
Brazil and Nigeria. It was canceled 
Nov. 7 so Carter could remain in 
Washington while Congress work­
ed on energy legislation. 
However, little progress has 
been made on the legislation 
during the period when Carter 
would have been traveling. 
Asked about reports on Israeli 
television that Carter would stop in 
Israel during the approaching trip, 
Powell said ''there are no plans for 
any additions to this trip." He said 
conditions in much of the Middle 
East are so fluid it would be 
difficult to plan visits there. 
Neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran 
are considered front-line nations in 
the Middle East conflict. 
Powell said that although the Warsaw news conference was the only formal such session on the 
Post-formal party to follow. 'Winter's Kiss' 
"Winter's Kiss", the ND-SMC Junior Class Formal will be held tomorrow from 9 p.m. -1 a.m. at the Great Hall of the new Century Center in downtown South Bend. Four hundred couples have pur­chased tickets for this event. 
Since the number of tickets sold generated extra revenue, the class will throw a party at Giuseppe's Restaurant, 713 East LaSalle Ave., after the formal. Pizza will be sold, and two free kegs of beer will be on tap. Giuseppe's party room hold 300 people, and the party will end at about 3:30 a.m.

schedule, he would try to make the 
president available to reporters 
"along the way." 
He said the stop in India was 
included because Desai had post­
poned a 1977 trip here in anticipa­
tion of Carter's visit. 
The spokesman said that if the stops in France were delayed, they would be so close to the French election in March that they probab­ly would have been • 'inappropri­ate.'' 



He said the visits to Venezuela and Nigeria had been delayed because their leaders had recently visited Washington. The stop in Brazil was put off because Mrs. Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus 
R. Vance had recently visited there. 
According to the White Huse agenda, Carter will arrive in War­saw late Dec. 29. On Dec. 30, he will visit the tomb of the Unknown Soldier and a monument to the Jewish ghetto of Warsaw, and will have lunch with Edward Gierek, first secretary of the Polish Com­munist Party. His news conference will be that afternoon. 
He will leave Warsaw on Dec. 31, flying to Iran where he will meet with the shah and attend an official dinner. 
On New Year's Day, he will fly to New Delhi and pay a formal call on Indian President Neelam Reddy. On Jan. 2, Carter will meet with Desai, lay a wreath at a memorial to Mohandas Ghandi, the Indian independence leader, and address

'Ride boards' may yield unplanned rides 

WEST LAFAYETIE, Ind. [AP] : Students who rely on campus ride boards to find transportation out of town could end up being taken for rides they hadn't planned upon, a Purdue University official says. 
"When you weigh the benefits of the ride board versus the danger of it, I'd say the danger greatly overwhelms the benefits,.' campus 
police Capt. Gilbert Buck said. Each year several thousand 
leave their names and other infor­mation on the ride board in Purdue's Memorial Union Build­ing. Many need rides to get home on weekends or holidays, while others use the service to help cut costs. 
In 1975, a student who put her name on the board was kidnapped by the man who offered her a ride. The woman was rescued 
. unharmed, but episodes like that one have convinced Buck the ride board is "a nuisance that ought to be destroyed." 
Precautions posted on the board advise students to check out in advance persons they will be traveling with, but Buck believes such guidelines are not enough to insure user safety. 
"The way it is now, it is just hanging out there so anyone can get at it. Too many students are too trusting with it," he said. 
Are women in government being used?_

Irish must first weather Hurricanes 
by Craig Cbval Sports Writer 
When the Fighting Irish take 
time out from their three-and-a­
half day vacation in sunny Florida 
to close out their regular season 
against the Miami Hurricanes 
tomorrow night, several Irish 
players will be trying to etch their 
names on the all-time Notre Dame 
record book and put the icing on a 
10-1 season. 
Luther Bradley, Jerome 
Heavens, Bob Golic, Jim Browner, 
Dave Reeve and Ross Browner will 
all be attempting to either break 
existing records, or extend marks 
of their own Saturday night in the 
Orange Bowl. The defensive squad 
is also looking for its twenty­
seventh interception, which would 
eclipse the all-time standard set 
during the 1966 National Cham­
pionship season. 
But the top priority for Head 
Coach Dan Devine and his charges 
is a victory that will send the Irish 
into their National Championship 
showdown against Texas in the 
Cotton Bowl with a 10-1 mark. 
The Hurricanes, under well­
traveled Head Coach Lou Saban, 
have posted three wins against 
-;even losses. the last five of those 
defeats coming in succession. 

.Junior running back O.J. Ander­son highlights Miami's offense, with 709 yards on 173 carries. The West Palm Beach. FL, native is also a dangerous receiver coming out of the backfield, and an . aggressive blocker. He is being touted as the next Chuck Foreman, aMiami grad currently starring for 
j.he Minnesota Vikmgs. 
Trying to open up the holes for 

Anderson wil be an offensive line 
anchored by senior tackle Bob 
O'Gara. A 6-4, 263 pounder who 
bench presses close to 450 pounds, 
O'Gara has the pro scouts drooling 
in anticipation of the January 
college draft. A three-year starter, 
O'Gara's specialty is run-blocking. 
A pair of seniors will lead the 

way inattemptingto put the clamps 
on Notre Dame's explosive offense, 
which is quarterbacked by honor­
able mention All-America Joe 
Montana. Middle guard Don 
Latimer, another three-year star­
ter, has terrorized opposing 
quarterbacks all season. Latimer 
exhibits good pursuit with his 4.6 
speed. 
Bryan Ferguson, who is also an exciting kick-returner, heads up the Hurricane defensive backfield. Ferguson s~iped four passes in 1976, and is one shy of doubling that total this fall. 
Devine isn't especially relishing Notre Dame's role as the favorite, but he feels that his squad will come ready to play. "You never know what to expect from an underdog, especially in the last game of the season," said Devine. "They're prone to gamble and put in new formations, so we'll have to be alert for anything. I know it's a cliche, but the underdog has nothing to lose and everything to gain. 
"Miami is a young team that has played very well at times, against some of the best teams in the country,'' praised DeviM, who has complied a 26-7 in just under three "Our immediate goal is to finish services of fullback Steve Orsini years at Notre Dame. "Because of the regular season with a ·10-1 and defensive back Ross Christen­their inexperience, they've had a record, and I'm sure our players sen, both out with neck injuries.

Women's varsity meets Valpo in b-ball twinbill finale 
by Laurie Reising Women's Sports Editor 
Notre Dame women's basketball team opens up their 1977-78 season at home Saturday as they take on Valparaiso University. 
This will be the first game since their elevation to varsity status and in the eyes of coaches Sharon Petro and Bob Scott, "The girls are more than ready." 
"We've come a long way since that first practice. Yesterday we had a good scrimmage against Southwest Michigan and though there still are a few rough spots, I think we're in good shape for Saturday," said Petro. 
"Although this year's squad lacks the height of last year's team, they try to make up for it in aggressiveness," said the coach. Paced by veterans Carol Lally and Marge Meagher the Irish will emphasize their speed and quick­ness. 
Unfortunately, the team will be without the services of t"vO of its starters. Center Jane Politiski is currently benched with a sprained back and Carolla Cummings will also be sidelined with a bad knee. Petro thinks ~>he may have a wild card in the for1:1 of freshmen dynamo Maggie La~ 1v. Lally, who stands just over five ket tall has amazed everyone to date and according to her coach, "Valpo is definitely going to be psyched out when they see her in action. She refuses to play like her height; she plays more like a six-footer," exclaimed Petro. 
The Irish will also be getting some extra advice Saturday from newly acquired assistant coach, Bob Scott. Scott, who is presently studying law here at Notre Dame, played on the 1969-70 varsity squad and said he ''knows first hand the importance of winning under the Dome." 
Said the coach, "There's always been that extra motivation of pride out on the court and I can see it's carried over to the women's team­these girls never let down." 
Scott predicted Notre Dame will probably use a 2-1-2 or 1-3-1 offense against Valpo Saturday since "this works best against either a man to man or zone defense." 
"We're strongest on defense right now and will probably be going to a l-3-1 zone," explained the coach. "The big girls have really been coming around pulling down those rebounds." · 
Game time is scheduled for immediately after the men's game on the main arena. 
Swimmer the past two seasons. i!> the top sprint freestyler on the squad and has his sights set on qualifying for the NCAA Cham­pionships t~is year. 
Other swimmers who will play a key role in the Irish s.uccess this year include sentors Btll Scott and Andy Petro and sophomores Tom Hartye and Mark Chiles. Scott, who captained the squad last year as a junior, will concentrate in the freestyle. Petro looks to have a good season, as he leads the Iri~h in the breaststroke. Hartye w1ll assume the leading position in the butterfly after establishing varsity records in the 100 yard butterfly 
(53.8) last year. chiles set Irish records in the 100 yard (:56.5) and the 200 yard (2:00.9) backstroke events last year. 
Notre Dame's diving crew will be forced to offset the loss of four time monogram winner Bob Ebel, the first Irish team member to qualify for the NCAA championships three years ago. Seniors Joe Caverly and Fritz Shadley return to form an experienced diving duo, while Freshmen Chris Leonard and Betsy Shadley will add depth. 
John Komora, another graduate of Adams, leads the talented group offreshmen for the Irish. Komora, who earned seven letters at John Adams, is an extremely versatile swimmer who will be utilized in both the individual medley and freestyle events. Another fresh­man who will contribute will be Rod McLaughlin of Syracuse, N.Y. in the butterfly. 
Dennis Stark, entering his 20th season at the helm of the Irish swimmers, has a very optimistic outlook on this year's squad. 
"I'm looking forward to this year because I have more depth than in the past two years," Stark said. "We still have eight kids from our 11-1 team in 1974, so I'm hoping that the younger guys can do what they can and let our outstanding swimmers take over." 
After this weekend, the Irish swimmers will tarvel to Kalamazoo for a meet with Western Michigan next Tuesday. On Friday, Decem­ber 9 at 4:00pm, the Irish will host Cleveland State at the Rockne Pool.
