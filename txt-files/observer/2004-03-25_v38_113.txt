The student government term may be winding down towards the April 1st tran­sition, but the Student Senate is showing no indi­cation of it, as was wit­nessed by Wednesday's one hour and fifteen-minute meeting that dealt with. among other issues, a reso­lution ·concerning Senate support of the Gay/Straight Alliance. 
Senior Joe Dickmann took the open podium represent­ing the Gay/Straight Alliance (GSA). an organiza­tion representing students of all sexual orientations that was denied club status under the name of United in Diversity by the Office of Student Activities on March 4th. Dickmann presented an open letter addressed to the administration and mem­bers of the Office of Student Activities and endorsed by the Senate Committees on Diversity Affairs and Gender Issues that detailed concerns about the status denial and its implications.

law-suits 

Notre Dame OIT officials say they are recezvzng more take-down notices 
By SCOTT BRODFUEHRER Senior Staff Writer 

The Hccording Industry Association of America announced it is filing a new wave of lawsuits against computer users illegally sharing copyrighted music, including 89 individuals at 21 universities. While none of the individuals sued attend Notre Dame, officials here are concerned the HIAA could sue a student in the future. 
HIAA president Cary Sherman said in an online press conference that college campuses are an attractive place for illegal file sharing because of free and unlimit­ed bandwidth. 
"Obviously. college students arc a big part of the prob­lem, and therefore it was only a question of time before university users would be named as defen­dants," Sherman said. "And we hope that it will send a message to students across the country that this activity is illegal and that engaging linl it can have conse­quences." 
Sherman said the HIAA filed lawsuits against 532 illegal file sharers and the average number of files shared by each was 837. Universities with users bning sued include Georgetown, Indiana. Michigan, Stanford, USC and Villanova, among others. The HIAA has sued a

Coming home 
I'm home -but don't tell my mom I said that. 
A couple of weeks ago, I let it slip; I explained to my mom that I had to make a quick run back to my house 
because I forgot Ann Loughery my coat. It took me a second to Sports realize why she Production 
sounded so dis­appointed after I had recounted such a minor detail of my day. 
All mothers like to believe they provide their children with the one and only home they'll ever know. But when I arrived on cam­pus this fall and moved into my dorm, I really felt as if I was returning to my second home. 

\ Call me the classic Legacy. Yes, I was a Notre Dame cheer­leader for Halloween. Our family visited campus at least once a year if not more. The only kind of football in our house was Irish football. My dad featured great Notre Dame legends in my bed­time stories. I was raised Notre Dame. Over break, I explained to my friends that I couldn't understand why anyone would choose to apply anywhere else. They, of course, smiled and agreed, knowing that I had always dreamt of attending Notre Dame. The last week in March marks the time that Notre Dame-hope­fuls receive news of their accept­ance. Each of them brings dreams for the future and a genuine love for the school. Little time has passed since we were in the same position. About this time, we each found our day­dreams centering around Notre Dame and acceptance. We had heard of the overwhelming masses of prospective students who had applied and also of those who had been waitlisted or rejected. At that time, many would have given anything for a spot in the fresh­men class. Too often this year, I've found myself stuck in a rut. I forget that I'm not just going to school -I'm going to Notre Dame. But all it takes is a walk past the Dome or a quick Grotto run to remind me how lucky I really am. Each time I look up at the Dome, I still get the chills. Remember how fortunate we are to call Notre Dame home, as much as our parents might be surprised with that description. There's no place like it.

Mezzo Methods to hold social -work fair 
By TERESA NOWAKAWSKJ 
News Writer 

In order to better educate students about the major and field of social work, Saint Mary's Mezzo Methods social work class will hold a social work fair today to both inform underclassmen about the major and to integrate the information that current stu­dents have learned in the course. 
Students said that many peers remain uninformed about what the field entails, and they said they hope to change this attitude. 
"A lot of people don't know what [social work) is about," said Erin lleidkamp, a junior social work major. 
Students said that the fair, which will be held in the LeMans Lobby from 7 to 9 p.m. today, has also helped to edu­cate them. 
"It's a learning experience for us too," junior social work major Theresa Ulrich said. 
In the field of social work, the "mezzo" level works with small groups and families, and is an intermediate level between the fields of micro social work, which works one-on-one, and macro social work, which deals with larger groups and organi­zations. In demonstrating that they have understood the mate­rial that has been learned, stu­dents planned the social work fair by diving the planning responsibilities amongst differ­ent small groups in accordance with the field of mezzo social work. 
The social work fair will be comprised of six different

tables in which all of the areas of social work will be repre­sented. These areas include both more well-known areas such as public welfare and school social work, as well as research, international social work and policy and planning. The tables will also allow stu­dents to see which organiza­tions deal with the areas of social work they prefer, and information on local agencies that deal with these different areas will be available. 
"We can say that these places deal with this issue," said Michelle Powell, a junior social work major. Powell said that this information will provide students interested in social work with the chance to net­work and see where they may gain experience in the field. 
Social work majors will be available, along with course professor JoAnn Burke, to answer any questions students may have. Students who attend the fair will have the opportunity to fill out a ques­tionnaire to inform the social work majors if the fair was a good idea, if it helped them to acquaint themselves better with the social work major and to suggest what can be done in the future to improve the event. 
As an extra initiative. stu­dents will participate in a raffie of $100 worth of different gift certificates. Breadsticks and soda will be available for refreshment, and all Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross interested students are invited and encouraged to attend.

dynamic group of people, the pas­sion behind everyone's motives will get it done," she said. 
Chin said the once the new structure of student government is implemented, students will see benefits. 
"We'll have more efficiency and more communication," she said. 
The new system will split stu­dent government into two major divisions the Campus Programming Council and the Campus Affairs Council. The CPC will coordinate events at the cam­pus and dorm levels and will have representatives from each resi­dence hall. Members will effective­ly take over SUB duties. 
The CAC, which will likewise be compromised of representatives from each dorm, will constitute the other side of student government. 
Members of the CAC, which is analogous to the current Student Senate, will tackle policy issues. 
Lao said he expects the new con­stitution will fulfill the needs of the student union in the years to come. 
"My plan is to have it stick around for a while," he said. "We foresee this to be a constitution for the future." 
President-elect Adam Istvan. whose term begins April 1, will likely have challenges in adapting to the new structure, but Lao said his successor will handle them well. 
"Judging from the commitment . he's shown, and the individuals he has around him, I have confidence in the whole team," Lao said. "Transition is all part of the process." 
Chief of staff Pat Corker agreed, saying Istvan has been actively working to prepare for the new constitution. 
"He's been at all the meetings, trying to familiarize himself with the new system." 
Istvan said he and vice presi­dent-elect Karla Bell are enthusi­astic about the prospects for the revamped system. 
"Karla and I are really excited to get going on our new projects," Istvan said. "Now we can move on to getting some things for the stu­dents." 
He said his administration will focus on diversity projects, particu­larly those dealing with ethnicity and sexual orientation. 
"The new system sets itself up for educational initiatives Hke Martin Luther King awareness week and GLBT [gay, lesbian. bisexual and transgender) issues," he said. 
Istvan said the overhauled con­stitution will encourage communi­cation among leaders from across student government and lead to a more effective student union. 
"You get all the best people working together," he said.

U.N.: Malnutrition hurts world IQ 
UNITED NATIONS -The brainpower of entire nations has diminished because of a shortage of the right vitamins, and slipping nutrients into people's food seems to be the only solution, a new U.N. survey says. 
To fight the problem, the United Nations is prescribing a whole pantry of artificially for­tified foods: soy sauce laced with zinc, "super salt": spiked with iron, cooking oil fortified with vitamin A. 
Ddiciencies in these vitamins are having alarming effects in developing countries, even ones where people generally have enough to eat, said the study, released Wednesday. 
A laek of iron lowers children's IQs by an average five to seven points, the report said. 
EU levies $613M fine on Microsoft 
BHUSSELS, Belgium -The European Union slapped Microsoft Corp. with a $613 million fine Wednesday for abusively wield­ing its Windows software monopoly and ordered sanctions that go well beyond the 
U.S. antitrust settlement -setting up what could be another lengthy court battle. 
Mierosoft called the EU's decision "unwar­ranted and ill-considered," and said it would ask a judge to suspend the order pending appeal. 
The EU antitrust office said it sought to alter Mierosoft's behavior because its five­year investigation found that the software giant tried to squeeze competitors out of Windows-related markets and "the illegal b(~havior is still ongoing."

Scientists find evolution gene 
Touching o!T a scientific furor, researchers say they may have discovered the mutation that caused the earliest humans to branch off from their apelike ancestors -a gene that led to smaller, weaker jaws and, ulti­mately. bigger brains. 
Smaller jaws would have fundamentally changed the structure of the skull, they con­tend, by eliminating thick muscles that worked like bungee cords to anchor a huge jaw to the crown of the head. The change would have allowed the cranium to grow larger and led to the development of a bigger brain capable of tool-making and language. 
The mutation is reported in the latest issue of the journal Nature, not by anthropologists, but by a team of biologists and plastic sur­geons at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's llospital of Philadelphia. 


Deadly riptides threaten bathers 
PALM BEM:t I, Fla. -Treacherous rip cur­rents along the Florida coast in the past week have killed at least four beachgoers, led to dozens of rescues and forced life­guards to issue an unpopular warning in the middle of spring break: Stay out of the water. 
This week's deaths were all blamed on rip currents, which are rushing channels of water that can carry away even the best swimmers. Although the currents do not drag swimmers under water, many people panic, become tired and drown as they try to swim back to shore.

O'Bannon will not cut gas tax 
INDIANAPOLIS -When gas prices were this high in Indiana four years ago, the late Gov. Frank O'Bannon made big news by sus­pending the state sales tax on gasoline. 
Do not look for a repeat by O'Bannon's friend, political partner and successor ­Gov. Joe Kernan -any time soon. 
"Governor Kernan shares the nationwide concern about rising gas prices, and sus­pending the sales tax will always be on the list of options in terms of what the state can do to assist Hoosiers with this added finan­cial burden," Kernan press secretary Tina Noel said Tuesday. 
"However, the governor is not considering a suspension at this time."

Ex-adviser: Bush weak on terror 
Former terrorism aide testifies Clinton had 'no higher priority' than al-Qaida 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON -The Bush White House scaled back the struggle against al-Qaida after taking office in 2001 and spurned sug­gestions that it retaliate for the bombing of a U.S. war­ship because "it happened on the Clinton administra­tion's watch," a former top terrorism adviser testified Wednesday. 
The Clinton administra­tion had "no higher priori­ty" than combatting terror­ists while the Bush adminis­tration made it "an impor­tant issue but not an urgent issue" in the months before Sept. 11, 2001, said Richard Clarke, who advised both presidents. He testified before the commission investigating the worst ter­rorist attacks in U.S. histo­ry. 
Clarke's turn in the wit­ness chair transformed what has been a painstak­ing, bipartisan probe of pre-Sept. 11 intelligence failures and bureaucratic missteps into a nationally televised criticism of President Bush on the ter­rorism issue at the core of his campaign for re-elec­tion. 
The White House redou­bled efforts to undermine Clarke, the author of a recent book critical of the president. 
Officials also took the unusual step of identifying him as the senior official who had praised the president's 
Former Illinois Gov. Jim Thompson, a Republican, took up the president's cause inside the commis­sion hearing. "We have your book and we have your press briefing of August 2002. Which is true?" he challenged the witness. 
Despite the flare-up, com­mission members worked later to distance themselves from the sort of partisan­ship that could undermine the credibility of the final report they are expected to release this summer. 
"Nobody has clean hands in this one," said former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, a Republican and the commission chairman, referring to the Bush and Clinton administrations. "It was a failure of individuals. The question now is whether or not we learned from our mistakes." 
Clarke began his appear­ance with an apology to "the loved ones of the vic­tims of 9-11. ... Your gov­ernment failed you. Those entrusted with protecting you failed you and I failed you," he. added, as some relatives of those killed in the attacks dabbed at their eyes with handkerchieves.

·the policy-makers were employing to defeat the ter­rorist enemy, the commis­sion needs to ask why that strategy remained largely un-changed throughout the period leading up to 9-11," it concluded. Officials from Clinton's National Security Council told investigators the CIA had sufficient authority to assassinate ai-Qaida, the report said, but Director George Tenet and other spy agency officials "believed the only acceptable context for killing bin Laden was a credible capture operation." Sandy Berger, Clinton's 
national security adviser, testified that the former president gave the CIA "every inch of authorization that it asked for" to kill bin Laden. 
"There could have not been any doubt about what President Clinton's intent was after he fired 60 Tomahawk cruise missiles at bin Laden in August 1998," Berger said, refer­ring to strikes at a camp in Afghanistan where the al­Qaida leader was believed present. Bin Laden escaped. 
Tenet, who preceded Berger in the witness chair, also was asked about the issue of authorization to kill bin Laden.

No Greater Love 
Hey God: Long Time, No Pray 
by Keara Coughlin Intern. Campus Ministry 
So it happened again last week: I found myself completely drained-trying to figure out what was bothering me and how I could fix it immediately. It was the kind of day when my own feeling ofemptiness is like a black-hole: draining all of the smiles, all of the laughter, and all of the energy from the people around me. You will have to excuse my exaggeration here, but in some respect, I think that these kinds offeelings may be more common among people our age than we may first think. \Xfithout the sense of a driving force, then, we are left feeling 'dry' inside, wondering what the point ofit all is. 
 It is for this very reason that I believe God gives me days like I experienced last Monday. Just coming off a busy and productive Spring Break, I had a full schedule with lots of things to 
get accomplished in the days ahead of me.  Yet what I didn't realize right away was that I was  
missing the very source of the energy  
and passion from which I am able to do what I need to do and be who I  No Greater Love  
need to be.  I am slowly learning that  This Saturday  
the emptiness that we can feel in our  1:oo p.m.  -6:oo p.m.

kindness of friends and the compas­ gnatian Meditation  
sion and support of loved ones.  But  
most ofall, we are made whole by the  

peace that we receive when we finally turn ourselves to God in prayer. 
Now we all know that relationships take work, and when we don't put enough time and effort into building and deepening them, they tend to fall apan or slowly fade away. It is always a wonder to me, then, why even when we know this, so many of us still tend neglect the one relationship that can be the most life-giving of all. Our faith tells us that a relationship with God is a gift-but like all things that are worthy of our love, they are ones that take some effort: ones in which we are called and challenged to take active roles. 
What does an 'active' prayer life look like though, and is it even possible for people like us? "I am not that good of a person. Prayer is for the 'holy' people like Mother Teresa -she could pray because she was like a living saint." Does this sound familiar to anyone? This is the kind ofresponse that far too many of us give when our own prayer lives (or lack thereof) are chal­lenged. Our defense mechanism is to deny the ability to converse with God because we fear that we don't live up to what God asks of us. 
Christ himself, though, gives us hope. In telling his apostles the parable of rhe Pharisee and the tax collector, Jesus assured them and us that the most perfect prayer is the one from rhe heart -like the tax collector who comes before God acknowledging simply, "0 God, be merci­ful to me, a sinner." Humility (not self-deprecation) is the foundation of true prayer. Ifwe can just get ourselves to keep inviting God into our mistake-ridden, tar-from-perfect lives, and ask for the Peace chat will help fill thac spot in our hearts that we can't seem to keep from drying up on our own ... we will be pretty astonished by the transformation that can take place. Our tradition teaches us so many ways beautiful forms of prayer which can help us find different avenues by which we can converse with God. The "right" way to come to prayer, though, begins with a humble and open heart, asking God to fill us up with His spirit.

Health worries sink Dasani launch 
ATLANTA -The Coca-Cola Co.'s effort to 
sell Europe on its Dasani bottled water is in 
limbo, following its decision Wednesday to 
delay the launch of the drink in France and 
Germany -a move prompted in part by pub­
licity over quality concerns about its product 
in Great Hritain. 
The world's largest beverage maker with­drew the beverage in Britain a week ago because it found samples contained higher than permitted levels of the chemical bromate. 
Coke also said Wednesday it has decided not to reintroduce Dasani in Great Britain at this time. 
Dial shareholders clean up in deal 
SCOTI'SDALE, Ariz. -Dial Corp. sharehold­ers on Wednesday approved the company's sale to the Henkel Group, a German deter­gr.nls, cosmetics and adhesives maker. 
Dial, which makes Purex detergents, Dial bath soap and Henuzit air fresheners, is being purchased for roughly $2.9 billion cash by !Ienke!. 
The deal gives Duesseldorf-based Henkel a stronger foothold in North America and allows Dial to become part of a larger, global opera­tion that can better compete with consumer products giants like Procter & Gamble Co. and Unilever PLC. 
Dial's corporate headquarters are expected to remain in Scottsdale, along with top man­agement.

Among those the government expects to tes­tify arc all live of HealthSouth 's chief financial officers and Emery Harris, who is already serving a live-month term in federal prison for his role in the scam.

Bill Kirk lays down the law 
NO's discipline czar dodges 'bad reputation' in popular business law course 
Editor's note: This is the third in a Thursday series focusing on interesting classes in the Mendoza College ofBusiness. 
By MATT BRAMANTI 
Senior Staff Writer 
In some ways, Bill Kirk is a walking contradiction. lie is at once loved and hated, feared and admired. 
As associate vice presi­dent for residence life, Kirk plays the stern role of the University's chief discipli­narian. Kirk freely admits he has an unpleasant stand­ing among many Notre Dame students, but says that it comes with his role in the administration. 
"My bad reputation has been around for years," Kirk said. 
But to his business law students. he's a thoughtful, caring professor who works to break the preconceived ideas his students often bring. 
"I think my enjoyment of the material gets across to the students," he said. "They learn that there are real people behind the administration's decisions." 
In the Mendoza College of Business, all students are required to take a business law course, entitled "Contracts and Agency." Kirk said the course's mate­rial -which covers con­tractual obligations, the principal-agent relationship and business-related litiga­tion -is highly relevant for future busi­ness leaders. 
school, and was hired by 
the University soon after 
being admitted to the 
Indiana bar. 
Kirk said his legal back­
ground frequently comes 
into play in dealing with 
duLac violators. 
"The work that I do now 
is involved quite a bit with 
the understanding of legal . principles," he said. 
But his demeanor in the 
classroom stems from his 
experience in dorm life at 
Notre Dame. While a law 
student, Kirk served as an 
assistant rector in Sorin 
Hall, then as the rector of 
Stanford Hall. 
"I've got a unique per­
spective on students' lives 
here," he said. "It allows me 
to connect with the students 
in a really pleasant way." 
That connection helps 
engage students in the 
classroom. Kirk said he fre­
quently fields "hypothetical" 
questions fro[Il students 
about disciplinary processes 
or police run-ins. 
"I try to make the exam­
ples I use in class relevant 
to the students," he said. "I 
try to give them some good 
advice about staying out of 
trouble, and we have fun 
with it." 

Kirk said he walks 
throughout the classroom, 
threading his way among 
students as he answers 
questions. 

"Students have said they 
get dizzy following me 
around," Kirk laughed. "It 
makes it that much more 
fun to teach when students 
are really

A number of faculty and 
administrators who attended portions of the committee meet­ings said they found the process helpful. 
Preacher said that she attend­ed discussions on numerous top­ics ranging from women's issues to the structure of faculty gover­nance and the University's sexu­al harassment policy. 
"For the most part, everybody in the room knows where the discontents are, but l don't think there's a sense that the institu­tion is on the wrong track," she said. 
She said that she believes the "This visit is . . . really a chance for them [the committee] to help us look objectively at how we're doing ... and how we may do it [better)," she said. 
As part of the preparation process, the University has writ­ten a thorough self-study that provides the committee with information on its departments and programs, among other information. Because the accred­itation process has traditionally occurred around the University's own 1 0-year strategic plan, .the plan plays a vital role in the cre­ation of the self-study. 
"The strategic planning process is a good base for the self-study," Ryan said. "The processes are distinct but not separate ... [we an~l not doing this in isolation." 
Barbara Walvoord, coordina­as women faculty hiring, promo­tion and retention, but said she also believes more work needs to be done. 
"We've gotten a whole lot bet­ter.... but we've still got a long way to go. The University has made a good faith eiTort to hire, promote and retain women, but we still have some things to do," she said. 
Robert Norton, chair of the department of German and Russian languages and litera­tures, said he attended a discus­sion with selected chairs of humanity departments. lie said that discussion focused primarily on issues that the University may face as it "continues its efl'orts to enhance its reputation as a research institution." 
"I found them [the two mem­bers of the committee] to be eager to listen carefully to what rweJ had to say ... engaged and very well-informed about the university and concerned to help us to improve," he said. 
Norton said his department has taken steps to improve the quality of student education and assessment of knowledge learned. lie said his department remains one among a "minority of departments" within the College of Arts & Letters to offer a senior capstone project option to its majors and is currently in the process of considering whether to administer an exit survey to graduating seniors to gauge their satisfaction with the major and their education, as well as assessing what students have learned. 
"The process itself [accredita­tion! is also part of a larger question of accountability -the University needs to be held accountable, and the process of the NCA is an example of how that works," he said. "The very process of examining practices and asking questions ... in and of itself is salutary." 
The committee's findings and recommendations will be pub­lished in the Notre Dame Heview later this year.

"A number of other people provided other information and answered queries," she said. 
As part of their fact-finding process, over 50 meetings have been conducted this week with various groups on-campus. Some meetings have been open and have encouraged students or faculty members to provide feed­back, while others have been more specifically targeted toward groups such as depart­ment chairs or administrators.

Of particular concern to the committee during the 1994 report was the process of the assessment of learning and teaching. 
"Assessment is really difficult to approach," said Ava Preacher, assistant dean of the College of Arts & Letters. "No institution has a really good handle on it."

said Dan Lindley, a political science professor. "Communications integrated with targets are more effective than ever before. However, the classic problem remains ... the classic problem of battlefield intentions." 
Keir Lieber, another political science professor, agreed that while it is only natural to see war evolve as military educa­tion improves and technology advances, the differences in intentions and goals of the two Iraqi conflicts were especially significant. an open threat in the area,

'Lieber ex-plained a conven­tional war as "total conflict," such as World Wars I and II, with "two sides fighting in tra­ditional combat ways, with a military victory through defeat of military forces." 
Indeed, war has changed in the last half-century -both in its technology and its intensity. 
Since 70 to 80 percent of the missiles used in the Iraq War were "smart munitions," Lieber said, the death toll in the conflict was far lower than in the past. 
"Many predicted a huge number of U.S. military and Iraqi civilian casualties," he said. "Neither of these things came to pass." 
However, George Lopez, a professor with the Kroc Institute for Peace Studies, pointed out that although many war supporters called today's weapons technology more humane, the collateral damage number could be mis­leading. 
"You go from high-intensity war to low-intensity war," he said, noting that the already weak Iraqi infrastructure suf­fered -a trial that has taken a toll on civilians.

support structures the University provides for homo­sexual students are the Standing Committee on Gay and Lesbian Student Needs, Campus Ministry and the counseling center, and he said that these were not able to suit the needs of the stu­dent population. 
"There is no point at which [the three support structures] can say 'your friends are here to help you'," said Dickmann. "We need a way for students to get more involved, because the Standing Committee only allows for six students. none of which are straight. This is where the GSA comes in." 
The letter elaborates on Dickmann's statement. 
"The letter of denial rea­soned that a student-run club is unnecessary due to the presence of University sup­port-structures ... Underlying this argument is the disturb­ing premise that University organizations rightfully supersede student ones in terms of supporting students. This premise shows an inher­ent lack of trust in student abilities and a blindness to students' own yearnings to deal with these issues as a 
Iraqis -and the end is not in sight. 
But the end is in sight on the home front. Twenty-four hour access to press coverage about the war has changed the pub­lic perspective on fighting. 
"The pliability and availabil­ity of the media gives military and political people a [public relations) potential they haven't had before," Lopez said. "Since Gulf War I, we live in a media-frenzied environ­ment about war.... This is 24 hours a day." 
That is strikingly different from the newspapers of World War I and the newsreels of World War II. progress that has made the public more informed but less sensitive, Lopez said. 
"It has dulled the sense of most populations to the nature of war," he said. "More Americans know more things, but feel them less intensely."

community," reads the letter, obtained by The Observer at the meeting. 
Cavanaugh senator Jordan Bongiovanni questioned whether the senators should sign the letter without first discussing the issue with their dorm constituencies. 
"Events have happened since January [when Dickmann first addressed the Senate]. and I have a very strong feeling about having my dorm's backing before I sign something specific on paper," Bongiovanni said. 
The Senate moved to table the resolution until next Wednesday's meeting in a vote of 14 for tabling, seven against and one abstaining.

The reasoning behind the change is that toner takes up 80 percent of the library's budget, and many students abuse the privilege when printing is not charged to their account.

the security problems were 
allowed to remain online. 
On Monday, the Minerals 
Management Service sent let­
ters to the governors of 36 
states, informing them they 
would not receive roughly $90 
million in monthly royalty pay­
ments until the computers 
were reconnected. 
The order also had prevent­ed American Indian landown­ers and Indian tribes from receiving their monthly royalty payments for oil, gas, timber and livestock activity on their land. It had left 50,000 chil­dren attending 184 Bureau of Indian Affairs schools in 23 states without Web access, and environmental groups had complained they were unable to collect key information on department policy proposals. 
It was the third time the Internet connections had been axed since 2001, when a court monitor, Alan Balaran, found security holes could allow even a novice hacker to pene­trate the system. To prove the point, Balaran repeatedly hacked into the system and created a bogus account in his name. 
Lamberth is presiding in a class-action lawsuit, filed on behalf of more than 300,000 American Indians, alleging that since 1887, the depart­ment lost, stole or never col­lected tens of billions of dol­lars in royalties that should have been paid to Indian landowners. 
Attorneys for the Indian plaintiffs could not be reached Wednesday evening. 
"I am pleased today's deci­sion restores badly needed Internet access to BIA schools," Sen. Tom Daschle, D­S.D., said Wednesday. However, he said: "The Interior Department has not met its responsibility to secure Indian Trust Accounts.... I urge Secretary Norton to act quickly to ensure that trust account holders' interests are protected so that no judge finds it necessary to shut down the Department's Internet service a fourth time." 
The government told the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that the judge had overstepped his authority and the shut­down was making it difficult for the department to function. 
An Interior Department spokesman said officials were trying to determine how long it will take to get the systems back online.

As I continued through the paper Dolores Dlaz jungles of various

I had just survived a hard night and I realized that the decision whether or not to support another Blair election was like one I had just made. Indeed, it was like the decision many of us make at least once. 
In one way or another, we all know a Tony Blair. And who is he'! I'll tdl you. Tony is the friend that proposed that bad night out. For you, it may be the weird kid sitting next to you; here in London it's my optimistic friend that lives in the nat 22. 
Now, you trust this friend and you think that everything is going to run smoothly if you just take his advice on where to go for a fabulous night out, but sometimps he just lets you down. Let's recap the last disappointing night out.

The decision. After painstaking delib­eration, your good friend convinces you that the threat is real and delaying action another night could prove detri­mental to your future. You feel you have no logical choice but to proceed and enter dangerous territory. 
The preparation. This requires fore­sight. Funds must be acquired and budgets adjusted as you prepare to embark on your mission and search for weapons of mass seduction. The proper equipment is needed and the closet must be ransacked for the proper gear; there's no telling what you may encounter along the way.

The inquiry into weapons of mass destruction and the questioning of the prime minister is serious stuff and I'm not oversimplifying-just livening things up from the mock blood strewn over the anti-Blair signs in Hyde Park. Mistakes happen. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a particularly terrible one; howev­er, let us not make matters worse by retracting support from a friend who has proved himself in the past.

center, we saw some people watching a movie-"The Passion." Those fifteen seconds that I watched Jesus' feet being nailed to the cross stuck with me for the rest of the week as we trav­llied around listening to the stories of religious and lay peo­ple both on and off the island talk about life and the Church. 
Before going to Cuba and for the first couple of days I was there, I had the opinion that the Church in Cuba was not doing enough. I was disappointed by the lack of public protest and anti-Castro sermons from the pulpit. However, I now think diiTerently. The Church is the only body in Cuba outside of the government that is recognized; this is both amazing and dangerous. 
On one side of the fence, the Church is allowed little freedom to work, and on the other the freedom can be taken away in a heartbeat by the government. The Church today in Cuba is able to provide social services for people that arc not politically threatening like the elderly and AIDS victims. It also provides educational and social services to other groups in secret. The Church is working to restore fami­lies separated by 90 miles and 45 years. It works in a country that just arrested 75 political prisoners, where workers make $8 a month, where people don't have free speech, press or assembly.

migration and homelessness? Freedom of press: when was the last time you wrote an editorial article or contacted your senator or university president? Freedom of assembly: have you ever attended a protest or a city council meeting? 
I have not; I have failed. I think the Church has failed too. Rarely have I heard a controversial homily or seen a television advertisement promoting social justice from the Catholic Church. We have all of the resources we need­all of the resources Cubans would die for. Why are we afraid to be radical? Jesus is radical. It's time the Church 
in the U.S. picked up its cross and started walking the road to Calvary with Cuba and other countries like it. One of the priests we spoke with in Cuba said, "On Judgment Day the bishops in Cuba will have a lot less ques­
tions to answer than those in the United States."  I think he's  
right.  
Jessica Brock  


Seeking truth 

While the March 23 letters by Michael Yaksich, Hristo Hristov and Brittany Sajbel arc each commendable and well-written, each contains untenable assertions that must be rejected by members of our truth-seeking Notre Dame community. 
Mr. Yaksich and Ms. Sajbel's appeals to Christianity to justify homosexuali­ty are unfortunately off base: Christ calls us to Himself and His truth-His truth is that we are sexual beings, called to live our lives as male and female. This sexuality has tremendous implications for our spiritual lives. See John Paul II's "Theology of the Body." 
I thank Ms. Sajbel. furthermore, for directing us to John 8 -but unfortu­nately she is overly selective in her quotation. Jesus, in verse 11, states, "Neither do I condemn you. Go, [and) from now on do not sin any more." Christ loves her too much to let her go back to her old life. 
I respond to Mr. Hristov's "scientific defense" with a philosophical proposi­tion. Homo sapiens have the unique position on this earth as being the only organisms with free will. Unlike the other animals, we have the capacity to trump pure instinct with our rational capacity and free will. We choose how we act. llunger strikes, for example, are possible for us, while inconceivable for our pets. Regarding Mr. Hristov's letter specifically: it seems that much is speculative, as no one truly understands the causation principles between genes and human characteristics -as admitted by Mr. Hristov-yet worth our attention nonetheless. 
Even if we grant Mr. Hristov's proposition that an orientation favoring homosexual activity is as "natural" to some people as gripping with the right hand instead of the left at age one, that does not mean that homosexu­al actions are to be embraced as natural or good. Unlike the hand example, not all "natural" inclinations are harmless or lead humankind toward our rightful end. It is undisputed that some people are born with inclinations toward activity harmful to themselves or to others. Instead of allowing these inclinations to dominate the person, though, society has determined that it is preferable to help these individuals: to work with them, in love, to over­come harmful inclinations. 
This is possible because, again, we all have the freedom to choose ration­ally. Free will is a great gift and a great burden, because we have responsi­bility for our actions -see "The Grand Inquisitor" in Dostoevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov." 
Here comes the fun part: through our natural reason, even without appeals to Church teaching, we can all reach the conclusion that the homo­sexual act is not in accord with mankind's rightful end. It's the natural law, shaping our worldview since time began, and it's not going away. 
All of this said, our emphasis must be on loving and supporting each and every member of our community. I have my own struggles. I have difficulty living my own life as I should, and I need to tend to the plank in my own eye. Official "recognition" of a GLBT-endorsing club, however, amounts to endorsement of the activity itself, and, for the benefit of this community itself, Notre Dame cannot comply.

Evaluating the facts 
In following the debates over the last couple of days, I have become quite perturbed by the reoccurring implications that one cannot be both loving and truthful towards homo­sexuals, truth changes over time and that choice is actually a factor in determining the appropriateness of homosexuality. What is even more disturbing however, is the faulty reporting on the part of The Observer. 
From The Observer reports on the wearing of the orange T-shirts last Friday, to The Observer's choice of headlines for the Viewpoint section this week, the staff has distorted facts and has presented information in a biased manner. A close exami­nation exposes the biases of the Observer staff. 
Andrew Thagard reported in his article, "Solidarity Debate Sweeps Campus," that the Gay-Straight Alliance estimated the sale of 1,600 T-shirts. According to the Notre Dame Web site, total student enroll­ment in fall 2002 was 11,311 stu­dents. Thus, 14 percent of students actually wore shirts. This statistic does not take faculty members into account although some purchased T­shirts as well. Thagard did state that, "A majority of students, howev­er, did not participate in the proj­ect," but is this fair rhetoric? Does this line lead the reader to believe that over 86 percent of the student body did not participate in the event? 
On Tuesday, the headline in the Viewpoint section mentioned a "Sea of Orange." Clearly, this is a refer­ence to the "Sea of Green" which consists of over 80,000 members of the Notre Dame community. How is this analogous? A more accurate description fit for a fair and unbi­ased newspaper might report on an exceptionally small group of extrem­ists attempting to change University 
policy based on either a rejection or fundamental misunderstanding of Catholicism. Remember, there is a word for Catholics who self-inter­pret Church teachings: Protestants. 
The Observer's use of the word "solidarity" is quite puzzling. How can the news editors allow a head­line that equates the demands of less than 14 percent of the student body with a call for solidarity even be published by any allegedly intel­lectual publication? I am shocked that The Observer can take a pre­cious idea such as solidarity and debase it by equating it with an ambiguously defined notion of toler­ance. 
Furthermore, how does publishing over 10 quotations in support of the T-shirts as opposed to one in opposi­tion constitute a debate? 
Finally, a letter to the editor on Monday was titled, "Wearing of Shirts is Sinful." Never in that beau­tifully written letter was this claim made -although there have been two ensuing letters claiming the opposite. Those who continually defend the homosexual lifestyle under the guise of Christian love must understand that love involves more than just shallow tolerance, but also looking after each other and preventing members of the com­munity from sinning. 
On a positive note, I must com­mend the administration for making clear their reluctance to make any changes in light of the T-shirt wear­in-g. Indeed, the administration is beginning to emerge as a Good Samaritan in the midst of confused thieves by recognizing that being untruthful is being uncompassion­ate.

ALBUM REVIEW 

Simpson goes beyond chicken and tuna 
invited to the Grammy's without the "Newlyweds" camera in tow, Simpson seems to be on her way towards legitimate recognition. In This Skin has been re­released with three new tracks and for the first time in awhile, Simpson is seeing some musical success. 
In This Skin is an album that allows the listener to hear Simpson's true voice-for the most part. Although there are a few attempts at Britney Spears-esque songs, 
overall the album is very good. 
In a recent Rolling Stone inter­view, Simpson admitted, "My dream is to be like Jewel, to sit on a chair in my blue jeans and sing my heart out." 
Simpson knows where she stands, but could somebody please tell her producers? In This Skin is basically a good album, but the bad songs are blatant. The enjoyable songs that will get stuck in a listener's head and let one appreciate the sheer talent that Simpson holds are the tracks where she is allowed to maximize her vocal talent. Tracks like "My Way Hom()," "Forbidden Fruit" and "Loving You" sound like Simpson is trying to sound like Spears, when there is no need for that emulation. Simpson will wow audiences with her voice alone -if only they could hearBy REBECCA SAUNDERS

ALBUM REVIEW 

El-P succeeds in fusion of jazz and hip-hop 
By KENYATTA STORIN 
Scene Music Critic 
In the past few years, rapper/pro­ducer El-P and his crew at Def Jux have slowly established themselves as one of the premier underground rap labels of the new millennium. They are best known for their intellectual, nonconforming brand of hip-hop, often going where other artists have not gone before. El-P and fellow Def Jux artists such as Aesop Rock, Mr. Lif and RJD2 may not be well known by the general public, but they have been embraced by many members of the underground rap community for their critically-acclaimed albums of the past few years. El-P, himself, is best known for his groundbreaking, gritty and dis­torted production style and his techni-cal rhymes. 


But High Water: Mark is a complete­ly different entity, unlike anything El-P has ever done before. In it, EI-P teams up with the Blue Series Continuum, a group of six jazz musicians managed by pianist Matthew Skinner, to create a fusion of jazz and hip-hop. This is not an entirely new idea by any means, since famous hip-hop artists including A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul and Gang Starr have all done various forms of jazz/rap, and Guru's "Jazzmatazz" series even implements live jazz with rap. But unlike these artists, El-P does not rap at all on High Water: Mark, and instead focuses on combining his hip-hop producing skills with live jazz instrumentation. In essence, it is more of a jazz album 
than a hip-hop album. El-P is essentially a 

composer on 
High Water: M a r k . arranging the parts of the six musi­cians, while throwing in some produc­tion of his own. The B I u e Continuum itself consists of Skinner on piano, Guillermo Brown on drums, Roy Campbell on trumpet, 
There are -some terrific songs on In This Skin. A 
cover of 
Robbie 
Williams' 
"Angels" is 
beautiful when 
sung in 
Simpson's 
impressively 
powerful voice. 
The other 
cover, and one 
of the addition­
al tracks on the re-released album, is "Take My Breath Away," which is good, but not quite as suc­cessful. If a person loved "Take My Breath Away" in its original form, there is not much chance of liking this cover. However, a listener who is more interested in pop music will love this new version. 
The large question looming in every "Newlyweds" fan's mind is "Where is Nick?" Both Lachey and Simpson were shown recording this album on the show, yet it is only and all Simpson. The major theme of the album is not just love, romance or sex -it is Nick. The majority of the songs on In This Skin are easily related to Simpson and Lachey's relation­ship. Cute or pathetic? Fans must judge that for themselves. 
Simpson co-wrote many of the songs, which have mediocre lyrics for the most part, but are not altogether without imagery and substance. Her voice is beau­tiful and powerful and that comes through on the album more than anything else. Songs like "Sweetest Sin," the hit "With You," "I Have Loved You," "Everyday I See You," "Underneath" and "Be" arc all well sung and memorable. 

In This Skin is an album worth getting if you are a Simpson fan, or even just a "Newlyweds" fan. It is generally a good album with a few misguided tracks, and it also includes a bonus DVD with footage from Lachey and Simpson's wedding as well as the best scenes from the first sea­son of"Newlyweds." 
Is Jessica Simpson as dumb as she comes across as? If she were judged by the caliber of her voice, not even close.

Daniel Carter on reeds and flutes, William Parker on bass and Steve Swell on trombone. The combi­nation of these six with El­P's production results in a trippy sound that resem­bles something like a laid back jazz jam session thrust into the middle of a sci-fi flick. It is also rather dark and mysterious due to sinister piano melodies and ambiguous, alien samples that are main­tained throughout. Those that are familiar with El-P will recognize his unique production style through the disjointed, often chaot­ic sound of the jazz musi­cians along with El-P's own trademark space age effects and samples. However, El-P does not overload the album too much with his effects, allowing the Blue Continuum to have their moments to shine as well. 
With just eight tracks, High Water: Mark does not suffer from having any filler, which allows listeners to forget that there is a fast forward button on the remote control. El-P does a good job of switching things up, occasional­ly even implementing hip-hop drum­beats on tracks like "Get Your Hand Off My Shoulder, Pig" and "Intrigue in the House of India." Even "Sunrise over Bklyn," by far the longest track at over 10 minutes, maintains a high 
.level of energy by gradually building up to a satisfying climax. 

El-P maintains his excellent track record with another impressive outing in High Water: Mark. Trip-hop fans with a liking for jazz, and jah fans with an appreciation for the uncon­ventional will both take much pleas­ure in it. High Water: Mark is perfect chill music when hanging out with friends, or for those weeknights when you have nothing to do and just want to lounge on the coach for a while. El­p is already established as a fine pro­ducer, but this latest work demon­strates just how versatile he is as a musician.

A soundtrack of the year 
The school year is winding down and we can now begin looking back at all the fond memories we have accu­mulated from the previous year. Whnther it was "Hally in the Alley" wlwrn we saw Guster and Black Eyed Peas Brian Foy at Turtle Creek, the Spring Break road

once. music has no doubt played a 
huge role in how we will remember 
this "academic" year. 
Wlwn the school year started, we Wflrt1 all happy to see our old chums, but who can forget the catchy collabo­ration of Allen Jackson and Jimmy Buffet on "It's Five O'Clock Sonwwhere." I remember it as though it were yesterday-the first time I heard the chorus as I made my way to a popcorn machine. As I look back at August, I could never have predicted that such a modest track would go on to become a staple at establishments such as Linebacker Lounge. 
As the football season began, our expectations were as great as our love for "Shake Ya Taill'eather" by Nelly, P. I>iddy and Murphy Lee. There were two certainties about Heartland on a Thursday night in September: you could expect way too mueh artil1cial fog and you could expect to hear "Shake Ya Tailfeather" about 10 times throughout the course of the night. So. when you got home after a late night out you might have forgotten the per­son's name you were dancing with, but 1'. Diddy's hook could never be forgot­ten. 
During Fall Break. many people took road trips throughout the country. My roommates and I decided to head to a warmer climate and that meant Boston. We must have listened to a hundred songs during that trip. but one song made its mark. When stu­dents first hear "I Believe in a Thing Called Love" by The Darkness the 
Big Bol and Andre 3000 of Outkast had two of the year's biggest hits with "The Way You Move" Although these songs were released last semester, they continue to be a staple of every good party. 
reaction is usually one of shock. The 
falsetto of the chorus makes this the 
perfect karaoke song and one that we still sing today. 
The month of turkey and stuffing brought us the expectant mother's anthem "Baby Boy" by Beyonce and Sean Paul. Beyonce proved that she was bigger than Destiny's Child and we responded with "You no stop shock ­girl" in a Jamaican accent of course. This song proved to be a big hit all across campus and this time you could expect two certainties from dorm dances: sweaty underclassmen and a Beyonce mix that included "Baby Boy." 
The end of the first semester and beginning of the second semester saw two songs by one group that captured our hearts. Andre's "Hey Ya" and Big Boi's "The Way You Move" were a sta­ple of the first semester. but they reached their peak near its end. 
Whether you were tailgating, lifting at the Rock or chillin' with the homies, the boys of Outkast were everywhere first semester. 
During the month of lovers, one man dominated music with his appearance on a collection of love songs. No mat­ter where you turned Lil' John was all over "da" club as he leant his vocals to "Yeah" by Usher and "Salt Shaker" by the Ying Yang Twins However, his greatest triumph might have been "Get Low" with the Eastside Boyz as it added the phrase "skeet skeet" into the hearts and minds of club goers from Notre Dame to Nicaragua. 
The start of the spring season gave us midterms and Spring Break. There were a myriad of songs that were in the running for "Spring Break Anthem." but the clear winner would have to be "Toxic" by Britney Spears. It would take the greatest poets years to describe the appeal of this song, but the bottom line is that the music is catchy and the undeniable fact that Britney Spears is hot. 
The remainder of the school year will bring songs that we will listen to if the weather ever gets warm or if we decide to study for finals. Those songs will remind us of the different events during this school year and perhaps school years of yore. Years from now' we will hear a song on the radio and it will jog memories of our friends and good times we spent with them while in school. The time we have left during this school year is precious and that means time is running out to make a mix for the power hour for graduation.

MEN'S NCAA TOURNAMENT 

Martelli sees future in freshman guard 

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.-If Chris Paul wants to see his future he needs only to look across the court at Jameer Nelson on Thursday night. 
Paul, the skinny freshman point guard with the quick first step, innate passing sense and solid jump shot, will be running the offense for fourth-seeded Wake Forest, as he has from his first game. 
Nelson, the muscular senior point guard with very similar offensive skills and the benefit of 123 college starts, will handle the ball for top-seeded Saint Joseph's, as he has for the last four years. 
All eyes will be on the two stars when they meet in the East Rutherford Regional. 
''I'm hoping experience and a little bit of size pays off," Saint Joseph's coach Phil Martelli said. 
The 5-foot-11, 190-pound Nelson is an inch shorter but 20 pounds heavier than Paul. 
"You can't make it all about them. We all have to guard Paul and they all have to guard Jameer," Martelli said. 
Nelson, a unanimous selection for the All-America team, aver­aged 20.6 points, 4.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists while shooting 49 percent from the field and 80 percent from the free-throw line. 
Paul was the Atlantic Coast Conference rookie of the year and was selected to the league's all-defensive team after leading it with 2.7 steals a game. He aver­aged 14.9 points, 3.4 rebounds and 5.8 assists while shooting 50 percent from the field and 84 percent from the free-throw line. 
Paul's most recent games ­one in the ACC tournament and the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament -have been his most impressive. He has 81 points, 22 assists and just three turnovers in those games. 
"He's done a great job," Nelson said, referring to Paul. "He seems to be a natural point guard. He's so calm out there and that's what a team needs a point guard to do." 
Paul, 18, has spent the last few days getting ready for the 22­year-old Nelson. 
"You can't just watch one film on Jameer and understand what he wants to do. You have to watch tons and tons of film because he's such a great player and he's so versatile," Paul said. "I know he's a senior and one thing Coach always says about seniors is they play with a sense of urgency because it could be their last game." 
Last season was almost Nelson's last in college, but he

WOMEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL 

Georgia coach pursues elusive nationals title 
Associated Press 
ATHENS, Ga. -Andy Landers leans back in his chair, managing a defiant smile as he ponders the ques­tion that always seems to pop up this time of year. 
Sure, he'd like to win a national title. No, he's not con­sumed by the quest. 
"That's the one thing in bas­ketball that I want to do the most," said Landers, the women's coach at Georgia for a quarter-century. "That desire and fire is still there. But will I feel unfulfilled if I don't do it? No. I don't think I'm a failure." 
No one else does, either. 
Landers has 609 career wins. He's guided the Lady Bulldogs to seven Southeastern Conference championships. He's been to the Final Four five times. He's nurtured some of the sport's greatest players, including five-time Olympian Teresa Edwards, Katrina McClain, Saudia Roundtree and Kelly Miller. 
But one thing -and one thing only -is missing from Landers' resume. A national championship. 
This is his 21st trip to the NCAA tournament. He's 0-for­
20. No coach has been to that many tourneys without win­ning. 
Is he bothered by that statis­tic? 
He's ready for that query. 
"Does it bother me that I've played in 21 tournaments, which is the third-most in the country," Landers said. "No, none of that stuff bothers me. The better question might be: Would you rather have played in one tournament and won it or gone to 21 tournaments, five Final Fours, 14 Sweet 16s?" 
Landers is four wins away from adding a national title to the list. Once again, he's taken the Lady Bulldogs (24-9) deep into the tournament, one of just 16 teams with a chance to win it all. They'll meet Purdue on Saturday in the West Regional semifinals. 
Will Landers finally break through? Or will he remain linked the teams such as the Buffalo Bills (four straight Super Bowl losses) and the Atlanta Braves (12 straight division titles, only one World Series championship}. 
The Georgia players know Landers is always passionate about winning, whether it's a December game against some overmatched team or a March showdown with the season on the line. 
Then again, they all know he would appreciate a champi­onship more than anyone else in the program. 
"The national championship is definitely something he's got his eyes set on," senior center Christi Thomas said. "That's what it's all about -champi­onships. He's imbedded that in us. He holds that dear to his heart. I know it's an important thing for him." 
Landers literally built the Georgia program from scratch. He arrived in 1979, only 26 years old when he took over as the first -and still only ­full-time women's basketball coach in school history. 
Before Landers, the Lady Bulldogs had spent six pitiful seasons as a varsity program, compiling a record of 37-85. By his fourth year, they had reached the Final Four. 
In 1985, Georgia lost to Old Dominion 70-65 in the final game. Eleven years later, the Lady Bulldogs made it back to the cusp of a championship, only to get routed by SEC rival Tennessee 83-65. 
"I think we were very unfor­tunate with a couple of our teams," Landers said. "I don't want to cop out on anything, but everyone in this business says you've got to have a little luck sometimes. Just being good isn't enough. I know we_ were good enough two oi· three times."

NHL 
Sabres continue push for playoffs w-ith w-in 
Associated Press 
BUFFALO, N.Y. -Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff thinks the Sabres can win their final six games of the season. They might just have to in order to make the playoffs. 
J.P. Dumont and Adam Mair both scored in the second period to lift the Sabres to a 2-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. 
Buffalo closed the gap to six points on the New York Islanders in the race for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. 
"I liked every aspect of our game," Ruff said. "We want to play each game very well and get points." 
But the Sabres' postseason hopes continue to be slim at best. If the Islanders play .500 hockey in their final six games, the Sabres have to win their last six contests to quali­fy for the postseason. 
Still, Wednesday's victory gave the Sabres plenty of hope. 
"Absolutely," said Mair when asked if his team has enough in the tank to over­take the Islanders. "Right now we're focused on a game-by­game basis rather than lump­ing all the games together." 
The Sabres were helped by a strong effort in goal by Martin Biron, who missed out on his second shutout of the season when Michael Ryder scored his 24th goal with a backhander from the left cir­cle with under six minutes to go. Thrashers 3, Capitals 2 
Daniel Tjarnqvist was just trying to get the puck near the net. It wound up going in. 
The Atlanta defenseman scored on a 55-foot shot with 
7:24 remaining and the Thrashers kept alive their slim playoff hopes with a vic­tory over Washington Capitals. 
"We'll have to check the radar on that one," Thrashers coach Bob Hartley quipped. "I believe it was clocked around 38 mph." 
Tjarnqvist flipped a shot from just inside the blue line that got by Matthew Yeats, making his first NHL start. The rookie goaltender was screened by Ilya Kovalchuk, and the puck also appeared to slightly deflect off a Washington player in front. 
''I'd rather see a 38 mph shot that's on net than a 110 mph shot that's on the glass," Hartley said. "It was a shot on net and there was traffic in front. That's the way you score goals." 
The winning goal came just three minutes after Brian Willsie tied it for the Capitals, knocking a rebound past Kari Lehtonen. 
Atlanta's rookie goalie won his second straight start since getting called up from the minors the night off in the second of back-to-hack games. 
Blue Jackets 2, Wild 0 
No one is running away with the NHL goal-scoring title, but it isn't for lack of effort. 
"Jeez, we're all trying," Rick Nash cracked after scoring his 39th goal in the Columbus Blue Jackets' win over the Minnesota Wild. "It's one of those things where I'm here, I might as well go for it." 
Nash moved into a tie for the goals lead with Atlanta's Ilya Kovalchuk -a fact that surprised the 19-year-old, second-year star. 
"I didn't really expect it. I didn't really think I would be this close this far in the sea­son," he said. "Obviously, guys are going on streaks where they score two or three and then they go three or four games without. It's kind of nice that Kovalchuk hasn't run away with it and hasn't scored in a while." 
Marc Denis stopped 20 shots in his fifth shutout of the sea­son -tying the franchise record -and the 14th of his career. He was seldom tested by the Wild, who have lost three games in a row.

Houston's Roger Clemens jokes with teammate Andy Pettltte during a spring training game against the St. Louis Cardinals. 





PILOTING 
Associated Press 
It's easy to envision the mar­quee matchups: Roger Clemens vs. Greg Maddux, with first place on the line. 
Or Andy Pettitte against Kerry Wood for a trip to the World Series. 
Maybe Mark Prior and Hoy Oswalt in Game 7 of the play­offs. 
Packed with pitching, the Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros appear headed for a heated race in the NL Central this season -and their budding rivalry could carry into October. 
"We're hoping to do some great things," said Clemens, who came out of retirement in January to join his good pal Pettitte with their hometown Astros. 
The Cubs won the division by one game over Houston last year and came within five outs of their first pennant since 1945. Looking to get over the hump, they signed Maddux, 11 wins shy of 300 and destined for the Hall of Fame. 


The former Atlanta ace began his career with the Cubs and won the first of his four straight NL Cy Young Awards with them in 1992. A crafty control artist. he slides into a hard-throwing rotation that already featured Wood, Prior, Carlos Zambrano and Matt Clement. 
"What makes it so good is it's so deep," Maddux said. "It's five solid pitchers. When you can go that deep, you have a chancn to win every day. That's something special." 
They hope it's enough to hold off Houston, which addPd a clutch performer in Pettitte when he left the New York Yankees as a free agent. 
He'll be the No. 2 starter behind Oswalt in an imposing rotation that includes Clemens, Wade Miller and Tim Hedding. 
"1 sec five aces," Oswalt said. "I know in a card deck you only get four, but I see five right now." 
COLLEGE BASKETBALL 
Barkley: Hire black coach 
Associated Press 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. Auburn's best-known name in basketball, Charles Barkley, said the Tigers should hire a black coach to replace Cliff Ellis, a move the interim presi­dent said was under considera­tion. 
"It's time for Auburn to step up to the plate. It would do so much for the state of Alabama," Barkley, a black native of Leeds, said in an interview published Wednesday in The Birmingham News. 
Auburn interim President Ed Richardson said the university is "looking heavily" at hiring a minority coach. 
Hichardson confirmed that the preliminary list of candi­dates to replace Ellis includes UAB coach Mike Anderson; Indiana's Mike Davis, who played at Alabama; Jeff Capel of Virginia Commonwealth; Gonzaga coach Mark Few, and Tennessee-Chattanooga coach JeiT Lebo. 
Anderson, Davis and Capel are black. 
Barkley, a retired NBA star­turned-TV commentator, likes Davis, who is under pressure at Indiana after a 14-15 sea­son. 
"It's not often you get a chance to hire a guy of his character and coaching abili­ty," Barkley said. "If you can coach at Indiana, you can coach at Auburn. I don't think Mike's ever going to get a fair chance at Indiana. lie's not Bob ,Knight. That's his only flaw. 
Davis declined on Monday to comment on the Auburn job. Calls to his cell phone on Wednesday went unanswered. 
Anderson said he was flat­tered to be mentioned but was concentrating on the Blazers' game against Kansas in the 
NCAASweet16.

PGA 
Players-Cham.pionship to decide front runner 
Associated Press 
PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. -Twelve tournaments. Twelve winners. 
The first three months on the PGA Tour were similar to last year, when the biggest names were on top of their games, but no one -not even Tiger Woods -dominated golf. 
"It just gets exponentially harder to win," Davis Love III said Wednesday. 
It doesn't get any easier this 
week. 
All the best players are assembled at The Players Championship to face the first major test of the year, and per­haps to sort out who the top contenders are with the Masters just around the corner. 
Woods seems like a logical choice, except that his only vic­tory was the Match Play Championship, and he is com­ing off his worst finish on the PGA Tour in five years. 
Vijay Singh was closing in on No. 1 until he missed the cut at Torrey Pines, then went two more tournaments without fin­ishing in the top 10. 
Phil Mickelson started his year with five straight finishes in the top 10, including a victo­ry in the Bob Hope Classic. Masters champion Mike Weir repeated at Riviera. Ernie Els won another playoff at Waialae. 
Seven of the top 10 players in the world have won. 
None has dominated. 
"There's a lot of guys playing great golf out here," Love said. "And it's hard to separate your­self." 
The Players Championship, which starts Thursday, has its strongest field ever with 80 of the top 100 in the world. 
The Stadium Course on the TPC at Sawgrass looks as tough as ever, especially given the firm greens during practice rounds and dry conditions that are expected to last through the week. 
"I can only imagine what they're going to be like on Sunday," Chad Campbell said. 
"It's going to be a hard test." 
Adding to the luster is the 
announcement Tuesday night 
at a players-only meeting that 
the richest purse in golf got 
even richer -$8 million, with 
$1.44 million going to the win­
ner. 
"There was a gasp in the room," Love recalled. "I don't think we were expecting that number." 
Love achieved rare separa­tion last year, when he had a superb closing round of 8­under 64 in cold, blustery con­ditions to win by five shots. 
But he has been reminded that no winner in the 30-year history of The Players Championship has ever repeat­ed. 
''I'm just trying to get lost in the process of golf and not think about results, not think about what I've heard for the last three weeks -that no one has ever won the championship back-to-hack," Love said. "I've won twice. I just have to put the years together." 
Told that 12 players-wo IJ. the first 12 tournaments of the year, Love replied, "I llope there's 13 different winners after this week." 
Love is among the top 10 players without a victory this year, although he is No. 4 on the money list. The others are Retief Goosen and Jim Furyk, who showed up Wednesday with a plastic brace on his left wrist from surgery Monday. Furyk will be out for at least three months. 
Of the dozen winners this year, only Woods has to answer questions about what's wrong with his game, although his performance last week at Bay Hill was peculiar -after four straight years of winning, he went three straight rounds over par and tied for 46th, 18 shots behind Campbell. 
The strongest and deepest field in golf tees off Thursday on a course that was reviled when it opened in 1982, but since has commanded the utmost respect.

PHILADELPHIA Bobby Taylor agreed to a four-year deal with the Seattle Seahawks, reunit­ing with former Eagles coach Ray Rhodes. 
The cornerback, who spent all nine of his NFL seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles, replaces Shawn Springs, who signed with the Washington Redskins this month. Taylor should bolster a pass defense that finished 27th in the NFL. 
His agent, Jason Medlock, said Wednesday the deal is a four-year contract worth $11.8 mil­lion with a $3 million signing bonus. With per­formance incentives, Taylor could earn up to $15.75 million. 
Also Wednesday, the Green Bay Packers were granted permission by Cleveland to talk with quarterback Tim Couch, whose days with the Browns appear to be dwindling. 
Browns spokesman Todd Stewart said the Packers called requesting a chance to speak with Couch and Cleveland gave its approval. Packers spokesman Aaron Popkey said the team had no comment. 
Couch's five-year stint with the Browns effec­tively ended earlier this month when the club signed free-agent quar­terback Jeff Garcia to a four-year deal. 
Medlock said one rea­son Taylor signed with Seattle was Rhodes, now the Seahawks' defensive coordinator. Rhodes was coach of the Eagles from 1995-98. 
Taylor is the fourth starter to leave the Eagles in free agency, joining five-time Pro Bowl cornerback Troy Vincent (Buffalo), run­ning back Duce Staley (Pittsburgh) and line­backer Carlos Emmons (New York Giants). 
Taylor missed nine games with a foot injury last season, but played in Philadelphia's two playoff games. He finished with 28 tackles and one inter­ception. Taylor's best season was in 2002, when he had five inter­ceptions, 49 tackles and earned his first trip to the Pro Bowl. 
Taylor has 19 career interceptions and two more in 12 playoff games.The Browns told Couch's agent, Tom Condon, he could discuss a deal outside the AFC North for his client. Stewart said the Packers were the first team to call.

Yao leads Houston 
t 
0 a 90-89 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -Yao Ming scored 27 points and had 17 rebounds, leading the Houston Rockets to a overtime victory over the Toronto Raptors. 
Steve Francis had a follow-up 
slam dunk to give the Rockets 
an 88-86 lead with 1:04 left, 
and Bostjan Nochbar hit two 
free throws with 51 seconds to 
play for a 90-86 advantage in 
overtime. 
Francis and Cuttino Mobley each had 17 points as Houston won its fifth straight from Toronto. 
Toronto, which has played more overtimes and won more than any team in the league this season. slipped to 6-4 in overtimes when Donyell Marshall missed a driving layup at the buzzer. A three-pointer from Chris Bosh with 33 sec­onds to play had closed it to 90­89. 
Vince Carter scored 26 points and Jalen Rose had 20 for the Raptors, who have won only once in nine games in Houston. 
Houston led 64-59 after three quarters, but an 8-0 run gave Toronto a 75-74 lead with 6:16 to play in regulation. A three­pointer by Marshall then put the Raptors up 82-80 with 1 :43 to go, but Mobley's layup tied it with 1:27 to play. 
Nuggets 101, Tlmberwolves 
92 
Carmelo Anthony had 25 points and a key steal in the closing seconds, and reserve Earl Boykins added 21 points to lift the Denver Nuggets to a vic­tory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
Denver shot just 30 percent in a 21-point loss to Minnesota on Sunday, and wasn't much better this time. The Nuggets spent a good portion of the game standing around offense and shot just 36 percent. 
They made up for it with just five turnovers -none in the first half-to stay within reach of Utah for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. 
Minnesota closed to 95-92 on Kevin Garnett's 3-pointer with 23 seconds left, but couldn't get any closer. Andre Miller hit two free throws to put Denver up 97-92, then Anthony stole an inbounds pass and called time­out before falling out of bounds with 14 seconds left. 
Garnett finished with 24 points and 14 rebounds, but was clearly frustrated by the Nuggets' physical play. Denver fronted him in the post with plenty of help on the weakside, then knocked him around when he did get the ball. 
Pacers 103, Mavericks 99 
The Indiana Pacers were just fine without Jermaine O'Neal. 
Ron Artest had 20 points, eight steals and eight rebounds and Jeff Foster added 12 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Pacers to a win over the Dallas Mavericks. 
The Pacers outrebounded Dallas 29-16 in the second half and kept their composure while the Mavericks came unglued to improve to 3-0 in games with­out O'Neal this season. 
O'Neal bruised his left knee in Monday's win over Chicago. The team's leading scorer and rebounder said he expects to miss at least two games, but he

hopes to be back for Sunday's game against Miami. 
Dallas was missing a star of its own. Michael Finley, the team's second-leading scorer. did not dress because of a strained right calf. 
The Pacers used their superi­or depth to their advantage, getting solid contributions from Austin Croshere and AI Harrington to fill O'Neal's void. 
Grizzlies 111, Knlcks 97 
Stromile Swift picked off Stephon Marbury's pass. hand­ed the ball to Jason Williams and watched him take off downcourt. 
A no-look bounce pass landed right in the hands of the trailer, Pau Gasol, who dunked the ball forcefully to give the Grizzlies their first double-digit lead. 
That play came late in the first quarter, and Memphis never let up. Demonstrating their league-leading proficiency in forcing turnovers, blocking shots and coming up with steals, the Grizzlies defeated the Knicks. 
"That~ been our bread and butter all year long," Grizzlies forward Shane Battier said. "We had very good pressure in the first quarter which led to our break. and it was working well_ for us tonight. It was good for us to start quickly. The last couple games we've started down in the first quarter." 
Memphis scored 27 points ofT 16 first-half turnovers. taking control early against an injury· ravaged Knicks team that was without Allan Houston (bruised quadriceps) and Tim Thomas (strained groin). 
76ers 99, Suns 94 
Samuel Dalembert was so physically dominant that even his teammates were complain­ing. 
Dalembert had 23 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a victory over the Phoenix Suns. 
"You elbowed me like four times tonight," Sixers forward Kenny Thomas told Dalembert. 
Dalembert threw plenty of elbows while patrolling the paint, blocking three shots and grabbing a career-high 10 offensive rebounds. 
"·How big was Sammy tonight? Sammy was outstand­ing," interim coach Chris Ford said. "I don't know how many blocked shots he had, but he certainly changed a lot of shots and was just relentless on the boards." 
Eric Snow had 19 points and three key free throws with 20.6 seconds remaining for the Sixers, who were without injured All-Star Allen Iverson for the second straight game. 
Iverson was out because of a sore right knee and was not on the bench during the game. Philadelphia moved to 6-1 in its last seven games without Iverson. When second-leading scorer Glenn Robinson also is out, Philadelphia is 8-2. 
"Our mind-set is that we have to play every game like it's our last," Dalembert said. "That's what we did tonight. Everybody stepped up, so I was really excited." 
Joe Johnson scored 27 points for the Suns, who had won two in a row. Shawn Marion and Amare Stoudamirc had 24 apiece.

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
One last challenge for Jones 
Irish senior will have his hands full in­defending Oregon guard Luke Jackson 
By MATT LOZAR 
Sports Writer 
It's appropriate in his last game at the Joyce Center, Notre Dame guard and defensive spe­cialist Torrian Jones will be called on for his biggest assign­ment of the season -somehow trying to contain Oregon's Luke Jackson. 
"I don't think there is a better way for me to go out at home but to go up against a guy like Luke Jackson, really testing myself on the court against a player of his caliber," Jones said. "To me, this is an honor to play against a great player. I love doing it, and it's been my role since I've been here." 
Jackson doesn't get the major publicity nationwide being on the west coast, but his numbers are impressive. The second­team All-American averages 
21.6 points in just less than 35 minutes per game. He also pulls down 7.2 rebounds, dish­es out 4.6 assists and shoots 
43.8 percent on 3-pointers. 
The Irish have seen some great offensive players this year, but they consider Jackson to be the best. 
"We know he is a great play­er, and he is probably the best player we have played against all season," Notre Dame guard Chris Thomas said. "He may not be the most talented player, but as a complete player, he is the best." 
Thomas has a personal con­nection to Jackson, as the two have attended summer camps together and even coached 8­Thomas doesn't have any secrets to stopping Jackson ­just good defense. 

year  olds  at  one  of these  
camps.  
Despite  the  friendship,  

"If you pressure him, he will look over the top of you and make the passes. I think the key is to get a hand up on his shot," Thomas said. "He's a great scorer, a great player. He can rebound. He can pass. It's going to be a team type aware­ness on him that we are going to have to do." 
Being 6-foot-7, Jackson may draw some defensive matchups with Notre Dame forward Jordan Cornette. 
But Jones knows, on what will certainly be an emotional night for him, his teammates are looking to him to contain one of the best players in the country. Not surprisingly, Jones is ready. 
"That's something I always look forward to every game ­a challenge defensively. This is my biggest challenge of the year. He's a great player. I'm really looking forward to it," Jones said. "Knowing this is the last time I will be playing on this floor as a Notre Dame play­er, I think emotions will be run­ning, but I will really be ready to do the things I've done since I've been here to help my team win."

tive out there on the field and especially at the plate," Mainieri said. "We've just been kind of in a little bit of a rut right now swinging the bats. We manufactured a few runs here and there." 
The Irish got out to an early lead with a three-run first as both center fielder Danny Dressman and second base­man Steve Sollmann drew walks. An error on a ball hit by Matt Edwards allowed Dressman to score. After a walk by left fielder Steve Andres loaded the bases, Cody Rizzo and Macri hit sacrifice flies to score a pair of runs. 
The Irish matched a third­inning run from Detroit in the bottom half of the frame when Bransfield smacked an RBI single to left to score Andres for the 4-1 lead. 
Notre Dame would blow the game open, however, with three runs in the fifth and four more in the sixth for the 11-1 lead. 
With the game in hand, Mainieri began to clear his bench and bullpen as several 

Irish position players and six pitchers saw action. 
"It was good to see so many guys get out there on the mound," Mainieri said. "I thought a couple of the guys threw very well. That was good to see. But it was just good to get that one in the win column." 
The Titans would make a lit­tle bit of a run, however, with. four runs in the seventh off righty side-armer Tyler Jones. 
In the eighth inning, Detroit narrowed the Irish lead to 11­6 with an RBI ground ball from left fielder Mark Moehlig. 
But with every starter but Edwards and Macri out of the game, the Irish put five runs on the board in the bottom of the inning to put the game out of reach. In the inning, three Irish batters drew walks, cen­ter fielder Alex Netty had a two-run double off the wall in right center and let fielder Brennan Grogan closed out the scoring with a two-run triple. 
Freshman Jess Stewart would get the win on the hill for the Irish, working three innings and allowing one run in a planned rotation.

Irish improved to 20-9 on the season after a tough early season schedule. 
"We are preparing ourselves for the Big East and for our home season," Irish coach Deanna Gumpf said. 
Offensively, Notre Dame was led by Meagan Ruthrauff, who was 3-for-4 with five RBis, and Liz Hartmann, who was also 3­for-4. Ruthrauff, Mallorie Lenn and Nicole Wicks all homered against the Crusaders. 
But while the Irish offense was on fire, Stenglein was the story. It was her second career perfect game, and her third career no-hitter.

Loyola (1 0-13) comes off a split of a doubleheader at Northern Illinois, where they beat the Huskies 7-1 before losing 5-0 in the nightcap. 
Meanwhile, the Irish hope to find their stride early this sea· son. 
"Consistency is the key," Gumpf said. "We've played very well, and we've not played well. The bottom line is we're capable of playing well everyday. They just need to come out and do the little things." 
Game time is set for 5 p.m. at Ivy Field.

offense has not meant a victory. 
"One of the biggest things about being an offensive team is it's a lot tougher to play from behind," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said. "The team can hold the ball and slow the game down. But we played hard tonight. We played hard enough to win and as hard as we need to play to be a top 10 team." 
Giordano's fifth goal with 5:30 remaining in the game put him one goal short of tying the record for most goals scored in an Irish home game, a record held by three different players in Notre Dame history. The most recent player to score six goals at home was Jon Harvey in a 2000 game versus Villanova.

and head coach Janusz Bednarski feels the team may have been dealt a crippling blow. 
"It's a very, very hard loss because Derek was in very good form," he said. "We have very talented kids but not experi­f:nced, and it's not the same level like Derek. Our chances to defend our national title are much lower. We have a weaker position for sure." 
Freshman alternate Frankie Bontempo will fill Snyder's place to maintain the allotted 11 fencers. 
Additionally, the fencing team will face much stiffer competi­tion at this year's champi­onships. In previous years, the Irish have had to contend with t.he traditionally strong squads J'rom Penn State and St. John's. But this year, a new contender has risen in Ohio State.

"The toughest [opponents are] our traditional rivals Ohio State, Penn State," Bednarski said. "But now without Derek, we have to watch attack of others. Columbia is very strong this year, and [so is] St. John's."

fENCING 

In search of a repeat 
Irish have a steep road to climb in defending their title 
By MATT MOONEY Sports Writer 
Every fencer on the Irish ros­ter has gone through the sea­son with one word in the back of his or her mind-"repeat." 
After winning the 2003 NCAA Championships, the next big test was to defend it the fol­lowing year. Today the Irish begin their quest to do just that. 
Notre Dame brings 11 fencers to participate in the 2004 national championships held at the Gosman Center on the campus of Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. The Championships will take place over a four-day span from March 25-28. 
The women will fence for the first two days, and then men will conduct their bouts over the remaining two. The nation­al championship is awarded based on the best combined score of both the men's and women's teams. Each fencer will compete in 23 round-robin bouts to determine the team score. 
Defending the title this year poses many challenges which the team did not face a year ago. Aside from the wearing the target of "defending national champion" this year, every fencer competing in last year's NCAA Championships had at least one year of colle­giate fencing under their belts. This year, over half of the Irish competitors will· be freshmen, including both saber squads, which are composed entirely of freshmen. 
Notre Dame also lost top foilist Derek Snyder for the season when he broke his hand March 17. Snyder had just won a regional championship,

Irish take Pride, top Hofstra by 8 goals 
By PAT LEONARD Associate Sports Editor 
The problem was obvious. The Irish gave up early goals in recent games and could not erase the deficits. 
The solution was simple ­score the first seven goals of the next game. 
Brian Giordano tallied five goals and Brian Hubschmann added four more and an assist as No. 15 Notre Dame (2-3) jumped on top of No. 13 llofstra (3-3) early and often, winning 19-11 in its final non-conference game of the season at the Loftus Sports Center Wednesday.

Ducks fly into Joyce 
Irish get 1st home victory 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Senior Staff Writer 
The Irish bats woke up a lit­tle bit Wednesday night, but Detroit gave Notre Dame a lot of help too. 
The Titans walked 12 Irish batters, hit three others and committed four errors as No. 6 Notre Dame (14-3) knocked off Detroit (1-10) 16-6 at Frank Eck Stadium. 
For the Irish, who had scored just 10 runs over their last three games, the free passes issued by the Titan pitchers stimulated the Notre Dame offense to score 16 runs, the most since a 19-6 win over Winthrop Feb. 27. 
"When you're not getting a lot of hits, it helps when the other team does some things for you, like walking batters and throwing a lot of wild pitches, but that's not some­thing you count on going into games," Irish coach Paul Mainieri said. "We need to swing the bats a lot better than we did these last two days." 
Designated hitter Matt Bransfield was 2-for-3 with three RBis and hit his second solo home run in as many days. Shortstop Matt Macri had a homer, three RBis and three runs scored, as he went 1-for-1 on the night with

Another NIT game and anoth­er game with major implications for the Irish.

Add in the fact this game is undoubtedly the last at the Joyce Center this season, and once again, it's not a boring game in "that other postseason tourna­ment." 
"It's definitely been fun, that's because we are playing against

don't want their season to end,""We just seemed very tenta-Notre Dame guard Chris Thomas said. "It's great because see IRISH/page 29 we are one of the few teams still playing right now, and we are fighting to play another day." 
After the frenzied atmosphere in Fort Wayne, Ind., Thomas feels the Irish are now ready to appreciate playing at home on a new level. Six losses at the Joyce Center this year lost the home­court advantage. 
"It was wonderful to have 12,000 fans in ND shirts. We were in awe of the whole atmos­phere," Thomas said. "Maybe we take our fans for granted, and sometimes they take us for granted because we don't come out and perform like it's a home-court all the time. 
"Playing at Fort Wayne inspired us to give our fans our all." 
Since this game is being played opposite the NCAA tour­nament, it won't be on national television and will keep these two teams in the shadows of the NCAA Sweet 16 games. 
That's a major reason why the Irish want a win so badly. A win gets them two more games in front of the country for everyone to watch.
