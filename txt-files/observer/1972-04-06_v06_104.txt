New calendar is adopted classes begin on Sept. 6 

by Jerry Lutkus 
Observer News Edito~ 

The Academic Council reversed their decision of March 6 and adopted a new academic calendar with a post-Labor Day start in their meeting on March 
22. Under the new calendar, classes will begin for all students on September 6. 
The semester will be interrupted by a Thanksgiving break, November 22-27. Classes will end on December 14 and finals will go until the 21st. 
The Council was called into special session by the petition of ten members of the board, in accordance with the Faculty Manual. The petition was signed by student representatives Alfred Giuffrida, David Koppana, Frank Palopoli, John Mateja, and Robert Meyers and Prof. Charles Allen, Alfon Veitzinger, David Appel. and Edward Vasta. 
The ten members of the Council who petitioned for the new meeting did so in light of extreme student resJ....;nse to the calendar passed on March 6. A poll taken _prior to the meeting indicated that 92 per cent of the students reached were not in favor of the calendar. 
Meyers, the student representative for the College of Arts and Letters, signed the petition because he felt "the students deserved to be responded to. They have the right to be heard before the Academic Council." 
Meyers, however, did not vote for the new calendar which passed by a 33 to 15 count. He called the first semester "a ratrace" and claimed that the pre-Labor Day Calendar was "something they will have to do in a year or two anyway." 
,a rat race" 

Meyers continued that the students reasons for change "were not valid." He claimed that the faculty "really gets screwed by the short semester" and that the students were being "selfish" with their demands. 
Student representative Fred Giuffrida called the decision "a milestone of sorts." He continued that "it's the first time to my knowledge that the Ad­ministration got beat in the Academic Council. In fact, it's probably the first that anything was. reconsidered in the Council." 
Giuffrida called a student-faculty power coalition "a real possibility", but he added that the students

Provost James Burtchaell. also a member of the Council. re-iterated the rationale behind the pre­Labor Day beginning. He claimed that llthe semester which slipped to 66 days was too short for an accredited institution and 2) there was a need for a break in the semester. 
Though he failed to confirm t. Council members mentioned that Burtchaell voted against the new calendar. It was Burtchaell who presented the pre­Labor Day calendar in the March 6 meeting. 
When questioned about the Administration never being defeated before, Burtchaell claimed that he really hasn't been on the Council long enough to make any kind of statement on that.

Civil Rights series begins 

with Warren 
bv Mfb Baum 
Earl Warren, former Cnief Justice of the United 
States, traced the historical development of civil rights 
in congressional legislation and court decisions when 
he delivered the second of three lectures dealing with 
Civil Rights last night in the Center For Continuing 
Education auditorium. 
Warren explained that, as in his first talk, the lecture 
would be, "singling out race relations rather than 
covering the whole broad field of civil rights and civil 
liberties." <In the previous lecture, Warren had said, 
"The subject of civil rights is of such magnitude, laden 
with so much history, and possessing so many facets as 
to make it impossible of meaningful discussion in all its 
aspects in the brief period of time allotted to this oc­
casion.") 
race relations 
The first lecture, delivered on April 4th, traced the 
development from the earliest beginnings of the course 
of civil rights on this country, especially with regard to 
blacks up to the 11~57 Dred Scott decision under Chief 
Justice Taney. 
Wednesday's lecture continued to trace the historical 
development of civil rights, primarily as seen in 
congressional legislation and court decisions. Starting 
with the Civil War, Mr. Warren followed the 
development of the Emancipation Proclamation, "A 
War strategy as well as a moral commitment," the 
13th. 14th, and 15th Amendments, ending with the 
backward step of the Hayes-Tilden election crisis. 
Warren observed that the election crisis "was stark 
evidence of how, in times of emotion, the President by 
the power of his position can, through subtle phrases, a 
tilt of the head, or a wink of the eye in chosen places, 
actually change the course of history." 
Presidential power 
The lectures by the 80 year old retired justice 
inaugurate a series on Civil Rights to be sponsored 
annually by the Law School in honor of University 
President Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh. 
US Repres~ntative John Brademas spoke briefly in 
introduction. citing Fr. Hesburgh as a man he was 
"proud to represent" in the Congress, and praising his 
15 years with the Civil Rights Commission. 
He also praised Mr. Warren, citing the former 
Justice's "historic contributions to the life of our 
people" during his sixteen years as Chief Justice. 
Prof. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr, of the Law School spoke in formal introduction. Beytagh, who once served under Warren as a law clerk, noted, "In a time of cvnicism and self-doubt. ..Chief Justice Warren is a 11·alking example that the System can work." 
lecture today 
The final lecture will be given today in the Center for Continuing Education auditorium at 8 p.m. The talks are open to the general public on a first-come, first­seated basis. and a closed circuit television system has been set up to accomodate the overflow from the small auditorium.

McGovern beats Wallace 
and Humphrey in WJScons.inl.!!!!~-­


McGovern wins solid voctory in Wisconsin. 
Ry Douglas Kneeland ((') 1!172 New York Times 
Sen. George McGovern of 
South Dakota, in winning a solid 
victory Tuesday in the Wisconsin 
Democratic Presidential Primary, 
captured 54 of the state's 67 
delegates to the party's national 
convention. 
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of 
neighboring Minnesota, who ran 
third behind Gov. George C. 
Wallace of Alabama, received 13 
delegates by taking two 
congressional districts. 
Despite his strong race, 
Wallace, whom unofficial returns 
showed with 22 per cent of the 1.1 
million votes cast compared with 
Humphrey's 21 per cent' failed to 
carry any of the nine districts. 
Under the Wisconsin primary 
system II delegates go to the 
statewide winner and the rest are 
apportioned among the highest 
vote-getters in individual electoral 
districts. As a result, Wallace was 
shut out in the battle for delegates. 
McGovern, who received almost 
:lO per cent of the total vote, won 
the at-large delegates as well as 
those from seven districts. 
The newly won delegates lifted 
McGovern's national total close to 
that of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of 
Maine, who finished a distant 
fourth in this state. 
Wallace. as a result of his victory 
in the Florida primary, is only 
slightly behind, with Humphrey 
trailing. 
St-n. Ht-nry M. Jackson of W 
Washington, who wound up fifth in 
Tuesday's voting with 8 percent, 
has no committed delegates as yet. 
Mayor John V. Lindsay of New 
York. who withdrew from the race 
Tuesday night after it became 
apparent that he had finished last 
among the six active contenders 
here. had garnered a half-<lozen 
delegates at the party's Arizona 
convention. 
President Nixon swept to an easy 
victory in the Republican primary 
Tuesday to pick up the state's 28 
delegates to his party's convention 
in San Diego next August. 
Nixon's only opposition on the 
ballot in an election in which he did 
not campaign were Rep. Paul N. 
McCloskey Jr., of' California, who 
dropped out, and Rep. John M. 
Ashbrook of Ohio, who made no 
appearances in the state. 
With all but 26 of the state's 3,294 
precincts reporting, here are the 
totals for the leading candidates in 
the democratic primary: 
Robinson resigns 

post as dept. head 
James E. Robinson, Chairman, of the English Department, has resigned his post as head of the department. Robinson's resignation was confirmed last­night by Provost Rev. James Burtchaell. Robinson will remain a member of the English Depart­ment. 
McGovern (30 per cent> 
Wallace (22 per cent) 
Humphrey (21 per cent) 
Muskie (10 per cent) 
Jackson <8 per cent) 
Lindsay ( 7 per cent) 
Six other democrats, who did not campaign actively here. were on the ballot. Each received one percent or less of the vote. Their unofficial totals were: 
Former Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota, 15,652; Hep. Shirley Chisholm of New York, 9,106: Mayor Sam Yorty of Los Angeles, 2,376; Rep. Patsy T. Mink Mink of Hawaii, 1,191; Sen. Vance Hartke of Indiana, who has withdrawn, 1,065; and Rep. Wilbur 
D. Mills of Arkansas, 934. 
In the Republican Primary the totals were: Nixon 274,682 (97 per cent l Ashbrook 2,615 (1 per cent) McCloskey 3,488 (1 per cent). 
u.1der Wisconsin law., voters have an option on the ballot of choosing "None of the above." With I,921 voters Tuesday, "none of the above" finished ahead of Hartke, Mink and Mills. On the republican side, "None of the above" did nearly as well, collecting 1,542 votes. 
McGovern, who flew to 
California this morning for fund­
raising dinners in San Francisco 
and Los Angeles, said that he 
thought his Wisconsin victory gave 
him a 50-50 chance for the 
nomination. 
Shying away from the title of 
"front-runner," he would say only 
that his success in this state was a 
first "great step" toward being the

democrats' choice to run against Nixon. 
Humphrey discounted his third­place finish, declaring that a large Republican cross-over vote has muddied the results. Contending that the vote was not a reflection of democratic party members' wishes, he said: "A 60 per cent Hepublican cross-over louses it up and everybody knows it." 
After examining the total ballot cast in each primary, most analysts agreed that about 50 per cent of the nominal Hepublicans who voted took part in the Democratic election. Fewer than 300,000 of the 1.4 million ballots cast were in the G.O.P.

There are now 6 positions open under Schneid that he must fill. Included in these are the Com­missioners; Cultural, Social, Academic. and Services; Business Manager, and the Associate Director 
In stressing the participation projects, Schneid noted that Fr. Thomas Blantz, Vice-President for Student Affairs, has approached the Union for help in renovating LaFortune Student Center. "It's this more permanent stuff that the Union should be involved in." 
But he assured the students by claiming that the concerts, movies, and lectures on campus will a "always continue to be high quality." Schneid mentioned that the Union "Might not flood the movie market so much, leaving 
some  room  for  the  other  
organizations."

"We we were a little hampered though," he continued, by the Student Union money being pretty much accounted for at the beginning of the year." The Union

Harrisburg jury dismissed 
by Homer Bigart (cl 1!172 New York Times 

HARRISBURG, Pa., The con­spiracy case against the Rev. Philip F. Berrigan and six other antiwar activists ended in mistrial late today. 
After 59 hours of deliberation, the jury reported itself hopelessly deadlocked and was excused without reaching a verdict on the government's charge that the seven conspired to kidnap Henry 
A. Kissinger, . assistant to President Nixon for National Security Affairs. 
I<'ather Berrigan and Sister Elizabeth McAlister, a New York City nun, were convicted of smuggling contraband letters at the I<'ederal prison in Lewisburg Pa. Berrigan faces a total maximum sentence of 40 years on four counts of sending contraband letters out of the prison in 1970, and Sister Elizabeth faces a maximum total sentence of 30 years on three counts of sending illegal letters to Father Berrigan. 
Defense lawyers said it was unlikely that the convictions would stand. The sending of illegal letters into and out of prisons is so com­monplace as to be generally overlooked, they said, and they said they could not recall anyprevious prosecution for contraband mail. 
The government's failure to obtain a verdict on the general conspiracy count may mean the end of prosecution for the other defendants--two priests, the Rev. Joseph Wenderoth and the Rev. Neil McLaughlin; a former priest, Anthony Scoblick, and his wife, Mary Cain Scoblick, a former nun, and Dr. Eqbal Ahmad, a Pakistani scholar, the only non-Roman Catholic in the group. 
The chief prosecutor, William S. Lynch, would not comment on whether the government would seek a retrial on the charge that the seven conspired to abduct

~
, Kissinger, blow up generators in the government's heating tunnels
r 
in Washington, and vandalize draft 

r 
boards in several areas.

r 
The prosecutor found solace in 

r 
r the convictions of Father Berrigan and Sister Elizabeth on tHe 
r smuggling counts. He had por­
r trayed the priest and the nun as ~ ~hotlgh! the.\ 1·; .. ,.  "'. -r-! ·.-.iasr: ·11 Bonnie and Clyde. He told reportt>rs that convictions on "Seven out of 10 counts ain't bad." The defendants, for their part, could not conceal their joy and relief. Earlier a note from the jury room indicated that some con­victions on the conspiracy count were being considered. The seven, who had remained cheerful throughout the long trial, fell grim when the jury foreman, Harold C. Sheets, submitted to Federal District Judge R. Dixon Herman the following question: "Do we find some of the defendants guilty if we have evidence they havP C'Onspired to commit A, B. C, and F offenses relating to the vandalizing of draft boards and the kidnapping of Mr. Kissinger and if we cannot find tnough evidence that anyone conspired to commit D and E of­fenses relating to the alleged bombing plot?" 
f 
' 
f 
r 
f 


Judge Herman answered af­firmatively. 
Defense Attorneys immediately denounced the judge's action as "amounting to a directed verdict of guilty against at least some of the defendants." The Defense also contendedthat the instruction was inconsistent with the judge's charge to the jury that it would have to find a single over-all conspiracy in order to bring in convictions. 
Sheets indicated in his note to the judge that the jury discussions, which began last Thursday af­ternoon and continued through the Easter weekend, were finally nearing an end. Tension grew. Berrigan, 48 years old, a stern, gray-haired priest described by the Government as the chief strategist of the alleged plot, buried himself in a paperback edition of "Bleak House." Sister Elizabeth, a slender, handsome Brunette, usually smiling, sat soberly by his side. 
The jury deliberated a few more 
hours, found itself unable to agree 
not only on the conspiracy but also 
on count 2, charging Sister 
Elizabeth with sending a kid­
napping threat through the mails, 
and count 3, charging Berrigan 
with the same offense. 

Before newsmen and spectators 
were readmitted to the courtroom, 
the defendants learned that the 
jury was "hung"on the conspiracy 
count. Scoblich and Father 
Wenderoth raised fingers in peace 
signs to the courtroom spectators. 
When the verdict was announced 
and the court recessed, Sister 
Elizabeth hugged everyone within 
reach. 

At a news conference later, 
Sister Elizabeth said, "We have a 
feeling we are celebrating 
something of a victory. But the 
rejoicing doesn't hide our 
awareness of the shoddiness we've 
seen." 

"We shall be out on the streets 
as fast as we can to continue our 
antiwar demonstrations," Ahmad 
said. 

Defense lawyers said that a post­
trial hearing would be held here 
May 2 and 3. Former Attorney 
General Ramsey Clark will argue that the convictions ot Berrngan and Sister McAllister for smuggling letters should be set aside as "discriminatory prosecution," contending that the Jaw on contraband does not apply to letters but to dangerous weapons and drugs.

ND gridders begin Spring drills 

by Jim Donaldson 
Sports Editor 
Notre Dame football teams always stress defense and, with the opening of spring drills yesterday, it appears that coach Ara Par­seghian and his staff will devote even more time than usual to that facet of the game. 
With eight of 11 starters, in­cluding All-Americans Walt Patulski, Mike Kadish and Clarence Ellis, graduating in June, the Irish defensive unit is in need of a virtually total rebuilding job. 
In contrast, the Irish offense, last spring's trouble spot, appears fairly solid, despite the loss of veterans Ed Gulyas, Bob Minnix, Dan Novakov, Jim Humbert, and Notre Dame's all-time leading pass receiver, All-American Tom 


Track team wins 1 out of 3 
by Eric Kinkopf 
The Notre Dame track team opened its 1972 outdoor season with a short trip to Tennessee over Easter break and returned to the ND campus with both encouraging and discouraging reports. 
Coach Alex Wilson's charges won one of the first three meets, defeating Middle Tennessee in Murfreesboro, 77-67 on March 28th, and placing a distant third to Tennessee and Wisconsin in a triangular meet in Knoxville on April 1st. 
The optimism came in what Coach Wilson termed "a few pleasant surprises." 
"We looked really sharp at Tennessee," Wilson said, "and Bill Phillips (quarter mile), Dan Cree han (440), and Rick Vallicelli 
(220) looked like they're really coming on. The team as a whole took a step up." 
The bad news came in the form 
of ·a untimely injury to sprint 
specialist Eric Penick.. After 
posting double victories in the 100 
and 220 yard dashes at Middle 
Tennessee, the fleetfooted Penick 
pulled a muscle in the 100 at 
Knoxville and will probably be out 
for a month, curtailing both his 
track efforts and his spring foot­
ball hopes. 
"Losing Eric is a big loss for us," 
Wilson said. "Not only will it hurt 
us in the dash events, but Jt's also a 
blow to our sprint relay team." 
Paced by Eric's double victory 
at MT. the Irish copped nine first 
places. 
Elio Polselli also captured two 
blue ribbons, winning both of the 
discuss and shot events. 
The muscular Canadian easily 
outdistanced the field in the 
discuss throw with a toss of 173-10. 
Junior Bill George finished second 
to Elio in that same event with 
an effort of 128-2. 
1972 NCAA indoor high hurdles 
champ Tom McMannon won the 
120 yard highs with a time of 14.1, 
while brother Mike finished second 
in 14.3. 
The individual milers managed a sweep in the mile events as Mike Gahagan took the mile with a time of 4:19.8 and Dan Dunne capped the two mile with a 9:23.9 clocking. 

Kane, Block named swim MVP, captain 
Freshman Jim Kane was named 
the Most Valuable Swimmer on 
Notre Dame's 1971-72 team while 
junior George Block of Yorkville, 
Ill. was elected captain for next 
year's team. 
Kane, a Owings Mills, Md., 
native posted varsity record times 
of 48.5 in the 100 freestyle and 
1:48.2 in the 200 freestyle. Sophomore Ed Graham was named the Most Improved Swimmer after establishing a varsity record of 2:02.8 in the 200 individual medley. 
Senior captain Brian Short won the Blanchard Award for the 
second straight year for in­spiration and leadership. 
Frank Pokigo and Scott McFarlin wrapped up the Irish firsts with victories in the javelin and pole vault events respectively. 
At Knoxville it was a different story though, as the Irish finished well be hind Tennessee 003 points) and Wisconsin (50 points) with a point total of 38.

Gatewood.Sixteen of the club's 20 returning monogram winners played on the offensive unit last fall. 
Revi~wing his team's aims in the weeks ahead, Parseghian said, "We've got to find a lot of key replacements on defense and also continue to experiment on other changes with both units. We must also develop depth--you can't figure to have an injury-free season." 
Only co-captain Greg Marx, an All-American prospect at tackle, and linebackers Jim Musuraca and Jim O'Malley return from last season's highly touted defensive­team. 
Marx (6'5,245) was the second leading Irish tackler last fall, making 85 stops, and is expected to 
"Actually we ran well at Ten­nessee," reasoned Wilson, "but our lack of depth hurt us." 
Dan Dunne posted good efforts in the three mile (14:23.5) and steeplechase (9: 35.7), finishing behind nationally ranked Vol ace Doug Brown in both events at Knoxville. 
Tom McMannon failed to duplicate his time of 14.1 in Murfreesboro at Knoxville and slipped to a 14.3 on a wet Tennessee track for the first runner-up spot. 


Irish stickmen 
by Andy Scantlebury 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team returned home Tuesday night after completing a highly successful trip to California during the Easter break. During their two week stay on the west coast, the Irish won three of four games, including an 11-5 win over the Orange County Lacrosse Club, the number 1 club team in Southern California. 
The Irish opened their 1972 season on a losing note, dropping their March 26th opener to the Los Angeles Lacrosse Club, 10-7, in Westchester, Cal. 
Two goals by freshman mid­fielder Steve Tarnow and single efforts by co-capt. Ed Hoban, John Corcoran, and Rich Mullin gave the Irish a 5-2 half time lead and Notre Dame seemed to have the game under control. 
But second half offensive in­consistency and a third quarter defensive lapse led to seven unanswered L.A. goals. Dave Jurusik and B.J. Bingle added fourth quarter tallies, but time ran out on the Irish. It was a tough loss for the Irish, especially for junior goaltender Paul Simmons who played a fine game. L.A. took advantage of Notre Dame penalties, scoring six of their goals while the Irish were a man down. 
Two days later the stickmen had little trouble disposing of a weak 
U.C.L.A team, 10-6, despite sloppy play by both teams. 
B.J. Bingle and Mullin gave the Irish a quick 2-0 lead, and N.D.'s Rich Marrinangelli matched a UCLA goal at the close of the quarter for a 3-1 Irish advantage. 
The Irish wasted little time adding to their lead in the second quarter as B.J. Bingle and Bill Dacey scored in the first two minutes. Notre Dame continued to dominate play and. after UCLA tallied, Dacey added another marker and fresh­man John Corcoran scored his second goal of the year. 
The highlight of the quarter was the defensive play of goalie Jim Roller and his three defensemen, Tim Baker, Fred Morrison, and anchor the club's forward wall, greatly weakened by the departure of Patulski, Kadish and Fred Swendson. 

Senior Tom Freis troffer, a top reserve last season, and freshman grid and wrestling standout Mike Fanning (6'6,260) are the top prospects at defensive end, just ahead of junior Jeff Hein, senior George Hayduk and frosh Tom Fine. · 
Freshman Kevin Nossbusch (6'4,255), junior Dick Maciag (6'5,250) and sophs Dennis Lozzi and Greg Szatko will be bidding for Kadish's vacated tackle spot. 
Juniors Musuraca and O'Malley, both powerful tacklers, give the Irish some strength at linebacker and would seem to have their starting positions sewn up. Two other juniors, Mike Webb and Pat McGraw, are likely candidates to land the other two backer-up spots, but they'll have to fight off challenges from sophomores Tom Devine, Tim Sullivan, Brian Clemente and Gary Potempa and freshman Sherm Smith. 
Defensive backfield coach Paul 
Shoults will have to start from 
scratch after losing Ellis, Ralph 
Stepaniak and Mike Crotty. In 
addition, only junior Ken Schelezes 
saw much action last year. Other 
prospects are juniors Joe Haggar, 
Terry Garner and Dan O'Toole, 
soph Mike Townsend and frosh 
ReggieBarnettandJim Chauncey. 
The offensive outlook is 
somewhat brighter than the 
defensive picture. Starters Frank 
Pomarico, John Kondryk, Dave 
Casper, John Dampeer and Mike 
Creaney return to give the Irish an 
experienced front line while let­

Four Notre Dame penalties enabled the Bruins to play "man up" lacrosse for the final six minutes of the session, but they could only score once as Roller was sharp in the nets. The Irish did all the scoring in the third quarter. Jim Brown scored early on a great pass from 
B.J. Bingle and attackmen Joe Anderson and Rocco Sadowski added goals. In the fin~l stanza, Roller was replaced by Joe Lepley and, despite a shaky start, the sophomore from Tulsa came up with severaLgood stops. The final score of 10-6 was closer than the game actually was, but Notre Dame still showed signs of in­consistency. 
The Temple City Lacrosse Club was the next Irish opponent, and the two teams met in a night affair at Temple City. Notre Dame put together a great offensive show, winning 14-6, as eight different players scored.

Ellington to play 
Saturday 
The jazz band that rocked the 19:lO's--and every decade since-­will present a one-night stand in Stepan Center at the University of Notre Dame on April 6. Duke Ellington's orchestra, fresh from a concert tour of Russia where they were greeted by 45-minute ovations will be sponsored by the Performing Arts Series of the Cultural Arts Commission, in the program beginning at 8 p.m. 
Famous for such musical masterpieces as "Mood Indigo," "Sophisticated Lady," "Satin Doll," and "Traffic Jam," Ellington recently added a new dimension to his talented career when he composed and performed music for a series of sacred con­certs in the nation's major cathedrals. Record albums of his now include such numbers as "In the Beginning God," "Come Sunday," "David Danced Before the Lord," and "New World A­Coming." 
Now 68, Ellington has had a band since Coolidge was in the White House. He has performed more than 1,000 songs in his 40-year career that spanned the eras from the Charleston to Bop. Discussing his recent interest in liturgical
-
jazz. Ellington has commented, "For far too long we have accepted Victorian religious music as a lasting criterion rather than social and artistic expression of a closed page of history. May I suggest that it is blasphemous to imply that God shares the bad taste of some of his worshippers or is insensitive to changing times?" Heserved seats for the Notre Dame appearance are priced at $4 and may be purchased at Pan­dora's Book Store, Witmer­McNeese Music stores and AI Smith's Hecord Bar. A limited number of $3 general admission tickets are on sale at the same outl£>ts.
