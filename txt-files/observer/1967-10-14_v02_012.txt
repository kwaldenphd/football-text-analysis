The 1967 Fighting Irish foot­ball season comes to an early cli­
max at 1 :30 this afternoon when top-ranked Southern California visits ND Stadium for a battle with more angles than a polygon. 
Among the many slants on 
today's tussle: 
-Notre Dame, No. 5 this week with a 2-1 record, must win to retain any hope of suc­cessfully defending its National Championship. After bowing to Purdue two weeks ago, the Gold­en Domers will need seven stra­ight victories and some Irish Luck to top the year-end polls again in 196 /'. 
-As if collegiate football weren't already confused enough, oddsmakers have selected the Irish by 12 points today, despite Southern Cal's superiority in the ratings. Pre-season favorites Not­re Dame, Michigan State, Alaba­ma, Miami and Houston have scrambled the national grid pic­ture after only four weeks by suffering losses or ties. 
-The Trojans will be trying to avenge the worst defeat in their history, a 51-0 thumping which the Irish administered be­fore 88,520 spectators in Los Angeles Coliseum last Nov. 26. 
-Notre Dame will be seeking its eighth straight home triumph. 
Southern Cal has not won in ND Stadium since 1939 and trails in the overall series 25-11-2. 
-Trojan Coach John McKay has made sure a sellout, Home­coming throng will be plenty aroused today. At a press con­ference Monday, he recalled the 1964 game and criticized bois­terous Irish fans. "I should have pulled my team off the field. You can't hear anything. You have to go with what you call in the huddle," said McKay. 
Most experts are looking for a high-scoring con test. Notre Dame's defense has yielded 41 points in three games this year, compared to 38 tallies surrender­ed all last season. 
USC, meanwhile, showed de­fensive weakness last Saturday despite its 30-0 pasting of Stan­ford. The Trojans gave up 338 total yards, including 148 thr­ough the air and 135 on kickoff and punt returns. The latter fi­gures indicate success today for Irish passer Terry Hanratty and return specialist Tom Schoen. 
Notre Dame's primary job will be to contain a team which Coach Ara Parseghian calls, "the fastest ever assembled." Indeed, the backfield looks more like 
Hell's Angels on the Los Angeles Freeway than four football play­ers. 
The Trojan Terrors are tail­back 0 .J. Simpson, fullback Dan Scott, flanker Jim Lawrence and quarterback Steve Sogge. SimQ­son, Lawrence and split end Earl McCullouch form three-fourths of the world-record 440-yard re­lay team. 
Simpson has an amazing per­sonal record to match his amaz­ing first name. OJ. (Orenthal James) transferred to USC this fall after scoring 54 touchdowns in two seasons at City College of San Francisco. He piled up 2,552 yards in 260 tries for a 
9.8 yard average. In his freshman year, he gained 304 yards and

ND Campus News Roundup 
Notre Dame's Pentecostal Movement is a coterie of stu­dents decidedly concerned about living and sharing their religious ideas. As their leader-apparent Jim Byrnes put it at their first gathering October 3, they gather together "to take Christ serious­ly... to praise God and to really 
rejoice in the salvation He's giv­
en us." 
The prayer meeting began 
with a fervent invocation in the 
carpeted basement lounge of 
Farley Hall. Several of the ori­
gina! devote, il\cluding Kevin 
Ranahan of the St. Mary's Col­
lege Theology Department, Dr. 
William Storey of the Notre 
Dame Theology Department and 
Father James Connelly were pre­
sent, as well as a handful ce stu­
dents who became involved soon 
after the movement was organiz­
ed last spring. The theme was ex­
pository, and the initiated did al­most all the talking. Some thirty others, occuping chairs and cou­ches or seated on the floor, lis­tened quietly. 
A song followed opening re­marks and served as aiJt intro­duction for the rest of the dis­cussion. The chorus included the lines: 
"Alleluia, I want to sing all about it/ Alleluia, I can't live without it/ Now I'm /ivin' in the new creation/ Now I'm drinkin' from the well of sal­vation"' 
• fhe Faculty Senate, a major ir.novation of this academic year, is presently in the process of for­mation. With a formula of one representative for every ten fac­ulty members, the four major colleges are determining election procedures. Election of Senate members should be completed by the end of the month. 
The mganization of the Sen­ate after elections will determine in large part the prominence of its role. First, it shall decide up­on its own procedures and rules, thus determirung how it is to op­erate. Secondly, a committee member stated that it must ex­amine possible areas of special­ization, thus clarifying the 1ssues it shall concern itself witt.. In this latter respect, the prevailing opinion is that the senate shall have to do considerable research into such matters as stud~::nt pub· lication, speaker policy, and dis­ciplinary policies. 
• 
A number of prominent Not­re Dame faculty members have met to establish a Phi Beta Kappa Chapter on the campus. A total of 35 Charter Members were present to launch the chap­ter. 

• 
Two Notre Dami! students and a friend were arrested Satur­day morning by Niles police on charges of stealing two America•• flags. 


Police charged Sam Boyle and Rob Englert of Notre Dame with petty larceny and Don Grisanti of St. Louis U. with petty lar­ceny and reckless dFiving. 
· The Peace Torch Marathon held a rally on the Notre Dame campus Monday night, on route to the Student Mobilization de­monstration in Washington, D.C. 
More man l 00 students sh­
owed up for the speeches and 
waited patiently for the arrival 
of the "torch" which was car­
ried up to Notre Dame by John 
Beaver, co<hairman of the Mich­
iana Committee to End The War 
The speakers were jeered by 
a few but the vast majority of the 
audience was responsive to the 
pleas of the Marathon members. 
The Marathon will continue 
on to Baltimore which they hope.

• The Action Student Party captured 13 of 49 Senate seats in Wednesday's elections. The ASP ran 23 candidated, electing 10. The showing was according to ASP's Chairman Jon Sherry, "short of what we expected." Several candidates offer­ing strong alternatives to ASP were triumphant, most particularly in Holy Cross, Breen-Phillips, and Walsh. 
ASP's major triumph came off-campus, where it swept five Senate seats. Ed Kickham, one of the five newly elected Senators, pointed out that many ASP members moved off-campus. This fact, plus the prominence of candidates such as Don Hynes and Paul Higgins, can be given as 
rellson for ASP's success. 
In tl;e vanuus halls, ASP faired less well Prominent ASP leaders were defeated in Alumm, where incumbant ASP Senator Bill Kelly went down to defeat, and Walsh, where SAP's former Presidential Candidate Denny O'Dea was de­feated by Dowd and John Hicke.

The Compleat Historye of Baskete Balle 
BY TOM CONDON 
Occasioned by the opening of practice by most of the na­tion's college basketball teams next week. I thought I might delve for a moment into the origins of that fascinating game. 
Basketball, it is generally con­ceded, was invented by James 
A. Naismith in the 1890's. Nai­smith was a Canadian student at Springfield College in Spring­field, Massachusetts. Naismith, like every other student at Spr­ingfield, was a physical education major. Springfield, then as now, was completely devoted to Ph. Ed., and it was a supreme insult not to be called a jock. 
There was a problem for Jim and his contemporaries. Between the football and baseball seasons, there was absolutely nothing to
• 
do. They were forced to gather indoors and undergo the rigors of Swedish calisthenics, with In­dian clubs and that sort of thing. 
Naismith and his compatriots realized after a very short while that it was going to be a long, cold winter. Then Jim got the idea that was to win Bill Bradley a Rhodes Scholarship. He tacked a peach basket to the wall and threw a kick ball into it. Voila! Someone in Indiana must have heard that first squish (it was a squish, not a swish, for there were still some peaches in the basket). 
There were a few problems at first. For one thing, there was the constant irritation of having to retrieve the ball from the basket. At first, Naismith tried a long metal hook. But 

Tell It Like It Is 
For another week, do not be surprised if you see a television crew interviewing students on the campus, for in just over two 
weeks, ABC-TV will televise an hour-long special "John David­son at Notre Dame." The pro­gram will be a musical variety show featuring up-and-coming singer John Davidso·n. It is beinl! 
taped on campus through the nineteenth of this month. 
The show, which will be car­ried the night before the Michi­gan State game, will contain both a musical offering as well as a portrayel of campus life and a selection on student opinions. The musical portion is to be taped October 18 and 19 in Ste­pan Center. The interview por­tion is underway at present. 
In order to get an accurate picture of campus life, the cam­era crew is workmg on the Notre Dame campus for two weeks. The University is assisting the producers in every way pos8iole, setting up a "headquarters" in the Continuing Education Cen­ter. Mr. James Thurin, Editor of the Alumnus, is working full­time with the crews as they tour the campus. The budget for the show is extensive, better than 
$280,000. 
The portion of the program underway now, the interviews, aims at getting a cross-section of student attitudes on a variety of topics. The show will, albeit in a casual way, delve into student feelings. As such it will have both an entertainment and an informative value. 



TROY TERROR

scored six touchdowns in one Smitherberger missed last Satur game. Simpson, 6-1, 202-pound-day's romp over Iowa but will er, averaged 11.7 per attempt in rejoin Schoen on pass defense 
1965. He has been clocked in today. 
the players began using the thing to put the ball in, thus inventing the 'hook' shot. Then he tried janitors on stepladders. However, the players kept knocking the thing over, and the wear and tear on the janitors was getting ridiculous. Just when Naismith was in a complete tizzy about what to do, the remaining peach­es in the basket, having rotted, rotted the bottom out of the basket. The stench that came crashing to the floor was awful­causing the first 'foul' in basket­balL However, when they realiz­ed the ball fell through, the ori­ginal problem was solved. 
There was another problem. Lengthy fights broke out, and it seemed that some of those prim­ordial games might never end. Again Naismith found himself in a quandary. To the rescue came Edward J. Referee. Referee was the biggest, toughest Springfield student -"Physical Ed" they called him. 
But not only was he loaded with sinew, he was an exception­ally cunning individuaL He in­vented the whistle. Naismith in­structed him to blow the thing whenever a fight broke out, and the players, not wishing to incur Ed's wrath, stood still when they heard it. Ed usually played the National Anthem on the thing, which helped. The game was on its way. 
The invention of the game made Naismith's name a family word. He stayed on at Spring­field for his PhD., then went on the road _selling places to play basketball, which he called "Jim Naisrnithiums". This was later shortened to "Jimnaisiums". He was a world hero. 
The future did look dim for one group, however. The janitors who fetched the balls out of the baskets lost their jobs when the bottom fell out. But one of their number gathered up all the now unused Indian clubs and invent­ed bowling. Basketball was good to everyone. 
The game was brought to Ind­iana, where it has nourished, by a fellow named St. Paul, a disci­ple of Naismith's. St. Paul put up a hoop in every barn in Indi­ana, and the rest is history. Even an Indiana college, Ball State, was named after St. PauL (Paul was named in 1885, Ball State not until 1932, which is consid­erably after 1885.) 


QUEEN PAM CLANCY-from Wayne New Jersey was elected Queen for Notre Dame Homecoming Ball this week-end. Pam a 5-foot-3 blonde hair green eyed freshman at Aulwell College New Jersey will be escourted by junior Craig Fenech, a junior Economics major. Craig and Pam met three years ago at a local swim club in Wayne, New Jersey. "We're going together now," said Pa:.11, "But we're almost positive we're going to get mar­ried in two or three years."

Ruggers face Badgers 
BY TOM CONDON 

The Notre Dame rugby team hopes to continue on its winning 
wdys when the ruggers face a strong aggregation from the Universi­
ty of Wisconsin on Saturday morning at I0:30 behind Stepan. The 
ruggers opened their fall season last week with an impressive 33-0 
victory over the University of Chicago. 
Injuries are plaguing the Irish for Saturday morning's encounter. Powerful fullback Sal Bommarito and senior forward Duke Heskett smashed heads in practice on Tuesday. Bommarito had I I stitches taken, and Heskett suffered a mild concussion. Hopefully, both will be ready for Saturday's clash. Also, hard-running Mike Joyce suffered a broken nose, but reportedly wants to play anyway. 
The Irish will go with their strong suit on Saturday. They will rely on the blazing speed of Bill Kenealy, Tom Gibbs and Mouse Adams, the cunning of fly half John Drndak and the nimble foot of hooker J. O'Brien Murphy. 
This is perhaps the most important fall match for the Irish. The men from the land of a thousand badgers have always been strong. They were Big Ten champions two years ago, and many members of that team return. The Wisconsin team is comoosed of ex-Mar­
quette football players, a huge Oriental law student, a magician and a French count. An interesting team. 
Present plans call for part of the match to be televised on the John Davidson TV special.

THE IRISH EYE---­
Beggar's Wish 

BY 'I'OM ftGEL 
Last Saturday a new chant sprang from the student section, just as vehement and just as fiercely held as the "We're No. 1" chant: "Eight in a row, eight in a row!" And last Saturday Notre Dame looked like an eight in a row team, at least against eight lowas. But_ Kevin Hardy, Jim Smithberger, and Tom O'Leary didn't play-bi~ chunks out of a defense already weak from last year's graduations. 
It makes you think of last year and of the injuries which almost ruined it. At quarterback and in the backfield the Irish are deep. Terry Hanratty was a tough act to follow Saturday, having gone nine for ten in a half; but Coley O'Brien, charged with candy bars and running for his life around the backfield, pulled it off. You have to wonder if he could do it for seven games and you have to wonder whether he's big enough to do it well. 
But other positions are not as strong and not as deep. Last year the Irish had what they wanted in twenty-two positions and only suffered when one of the twenty-two came up limping from a pile. Maybe another champion would have gone for it against Michigan State last year; but this champion was limping and proud of the tie. 
It could happen again and probably will. Last year the talent was divid~d and all of it was strong. But this year too much hinges on too few men, and as college football approaches pro ball intensi­ty, as teams begin to play for blood and schools for ~he money to continue, the key men don't hang around for ten game seasons. Notre Dame has done it to too many teams to forget that it can happen at home as well. 
Every team isn't an Iowa and every Irishman isn't Kevin Hardy. Hardy is big-maybe too big. The same is true ot danratty and the same is true of Bleier. Their loss would diminish the Irish chances and the Irish shot at No. 1. Every team isn't an Iowa and every 
second stringer isn't a Coley O'Brien. 
The "Eight in a row" chant presumes too much. It presumes that the Irish will be healthy and that all the breaks will be Notre Dame's. There are seven teams left and some of them bear grudge~ 
Miami has a loss to erase, has to attempt the same climb which faces Notre Dame. Each team has to be faced and gotten up for one by one. One plus one plus one plus ... equals eight in a row. But eight in a row looks like a beggar's wish. Some of the eight bear grudges; some of the eight are remembering already. 
Too much this year depe11~s on too few men. Eight in a row? Not this year and not this team.
