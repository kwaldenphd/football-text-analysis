Campaign debate could be 'pivotal event' in election 
Associated Press 

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.-­George Bush and Michael 
Dukakis clashed  over  
deficits, drugs and Pledge of Allegiance  the in a  

crackling campaign debate last night. Bush said, "I hope people don't think I'm ques­tioning his patriotism," but Dukakis said he was and added, "I resent it." 
Bush said his sharp cam­paign attacks were meant to question Dukakis' judgment on matters like his member­ship in the liberal American Civil Liberties Union and his veto of legislation requiring teachers in Massachusetts to lead their students in reciting the pledge. 
But Democrat Dukakis, saying he hoped he wouldn't have to repeat himself, replied, "Of course the vice president is questioning my patriotism. I don't think there's any question about that. And I resent it. I resent it." 

The clash came little more than 30 minutes into the 90­minute nationally televised confrontation. At stake was an edge in a contest rated a tossup in most national polls. With many voters un­decided or wavering, both campaigns viewed the show­down as a potentially pivotal event. 
The formal debate rules · were designed to prohibit 
direct candidate-to­
candidate comment, but 
there was no shortage of hos­
tilities. 

Bush worked into one an­
swer that Boston city police 
had endorsed him over their 

hometown candidate. Reply­ing to a Bush comment about being haunted by the plight of underprivileged children, Dukakis said, "I must have been living through a differ­ent eight years than the ones the vice president has been living through." He said pro­grams had been "cut and slashed and butchered and they hurt kids all over this country." 
In their argument over ways to cut the deficit, the vice president depicted his rival as a tax-raiser and the Democrat · suggested that Bush would cut Social Secur­ity. 
Both men aimed snappy comments at the other in the debate's opening moments. 
Dukakis was asked to

Debate preparations started early for two presidential candidates 
Associated Press 

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.­Both campaigns took pains to portray their candidates in advance as underdogs, but Bush and Dukakis both expressed confidence as they made their way to the debate city. 
The candidates flew to North Carolina a few hours before the debate began to check the lighting and sound systems in Wait Chapel on the campus of Wake Forest University and to browse through their briefing books. 
Bush and Dukakis, whose campaign wrangling has turned increasingly nega­tive, were believed entering the debate with some well­rehearsed; one-line barbs as well as more complex state­ments of their positions on the issues. 
Traditionally, the first of a series of presidential debates draws the largest television audience. 
Estimates of the audience for the first debate in 1984 between President Reagan and Democratic challenger Walter Mondale ranged as high as 132 million. Voter turnout for the presidential election was fewer than 100 million. 
"It's the beginning of a new phase of the cam­paign,'' Sen. Bill Bradley, D­N.J., said after a debate practice session with Dukakis. 
The format, agreed to after weeks of discussions between the two campaigns, allowed each candidate two minutes to answer a ques­tion and one minute for rebuttal. 
At the end of the debate each candidate was allowed two minutes for a closing statement. 
Other points over which the campaigns haggled were the makeup of the panel, the height of the podiums and whether the candidates would sit or stand. 
While the format allowed no opportunity for the can­didates to question each other, they were certain to find ways to raise questions that have marked their stump attacks on each other. 
"Where was George?" has become a Democratic cam­paign slogan referring to

Former presidential candidate speaks at ND 
By SHANNON RYAN 
News Staff 
Bruce Babbitt, former gover­nor of Arizona and Democratic presidential candidate, spoke at the Notre Dame Fieldhouse Mall Friday afternoon. Bab­bitt, a Notre Dame alumnus, discussed his personal back­ground and spoke about his ex­periences as a presidential can­didate. 
"I showed up (at Notre Dame) in the fall of 1956 with a strict Catholic family feeling that religion was just a lot of rules and rituals. By the end of my years here, I realized that religion was more than ritual; it was content, it was action ... .I began to see what it (religion) was like in terms of communi­ty," Babbitt said. 
"In your passage through this university--the explora­tion, the testing, the reaching­-you are making the kind of commitments that will help you wherever you go," Babbitt continued. 
After graduating in 1960, Babbftt, a geology major, went to South Africa to study its ter­rain. However, "The first time I saw a woman cradling a dying child in her arms, I asked myself, 'What kind ''Qf choices should I be making in this life?'" Babbitt said. 
Upon his return to the U.S., Rabbit said he formed a "private peace corps" with some fellow Notre Dame graduates. "Babbitt then be­came involved in the civil rights movement in Alabama, and eventually decided to at­tend Harvard Law School. In 1978, four years after gradua­tion, he was elected governor of Arizona. 
"When I decided to run for president, I knew it would be a difficult road to travel," said Babbitt. "However, the seriousness of. the campaign that I anticipated was not there." 
"I was disappointed in the level of dialogue; it seemed the entire campaign consisted of charges of who did what to whom," Babbitt said. He cited the media as a key offender, saying "It isn't right that The National Enquirer dominated the discussion of the cam­paign." 

"This is not a time in which Americans are eager to con­front the issues. There is an ebb and flow cycle of complacency, and Americans are in a mode of tranquility and satisfac­tion," Babbitt stated. "When times are good, we tend to take

Ritz issue aimed at pol icy, not hotel 
"These insinuations . . . inspired a woman, who identified herself as the mother of a Notre Dame student, to call the Ritz ... to let us know that she is going to recruit mothers of students to attempt to close down our establishment." 
letter to P.O. Box Q Wednesday, Sept. 21 
Well, perhaps I should have left well enough alone, but this excerpt from a recent Viewpoint letter was just too silly to let go. 
For those of you who may have missed the Ritz controversy, a column appeared in this space two weeks ago pointing out that a Uni­versity business directory contained advertis­ing for The Ritz, a local hotel "dedicated to romance and intimacy." 
The whole point of the column on The Ritz was to point out the inconsistency between Notre Dame's censorship of alcohol advertise­ments in The Observer and non-censorship of other advertisements apparently in conflict with Notre Dame policies on sexual activity. 
Now lo and behold, a local resident (or group of residents) seem to be bent on censorship of The Ritz itself by having the establishment closed down. No reason was given for this re­action in the Viewpoint letter, and, to be honest, I cannot think of one myself. If The Ritz were engaged in any illegal activities, the police would have shut the place down long ago. 
But The Ritz is providing an avenue for stu­dents to break Notre Dame's parietals and sexual activity policies, right? Maybe. If these are the grounds for attempting to shut down The Ritz, we might as well drop a neutron bomb on U.S. 31 North, where many more students go every weekend to escape what they view as overly restrictive rules. Better raze Campus View while we're at it. 
Shutting down The Ritz would be about as narrow-minded as the censorship the Ritz ad­vertisement was inconsistent with. Both are simply attempts to wall off all of society from actions that only some of society see as wrong. 
"But we're only trying to help people make the right choices," say the censor-minded provincials of the world. No, you're not. You're trying to eliminate the choices themselves. 
If the immorality of alcohol use and the im­morality of sex were so clear-cut, then why are many reasonably intelligent Notre Dame stu­dents using alcohol and having sex? Because they saw hotel and liquor store ads? Nonsense. They have chosen to do these things as consent­ing adults, although our cockeyed federal gov-
Mark Mclaughlin News Editor  


ernment has set up laws so that 18-year-olds can be shot defending their country but can't buy a beer. 
Censorship is a vile thing. It is an attempt to obtain compliance to arbitrary rules by force where logical arguments have either failed or never been presented. Foreign totalitarian gov­ernments do that sort of thing. American citizens and Catholic university administra­tions should know better. 
The question in both these cases is: Who is getting hurt? In the case of alcohol use, it can be argued that alcoholics, drunk drivers and their innocent victims are hurt and killed by users of alcohol. While I would say we should treat alcoholics and drunk drivers instead of attacking all alcohol users, there is some room for debate. 
Opponents of The Ritz have no such leg to stand on. There is nothing about The Ritz that violates the rights of anyone not staying there. There is only a fog of unjustified "morality" in some peoples' minds.

New plan could lower doctors' fees 
companies, his 2,000-page plan could have a profound effect on the nation's health care sys­tem. Among other things, it 
could: 
-Improve care by encourag­ing doctors to spend more time with their patients. 
-Lower medical costs by dis­couraging expensive tests, procedures and operations. 
-Increase the number of doc­tors willing to specialize in family practice and other kinds of primary care. 
-Lower the income of some surgical specialists while raising the pay of physicians who provide general care. 
A summary of the findings is scheduled to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday, the same day the report is released by the federal Health Care Financing Administration. Next month, the Journal of the American Medical Association will devote an entire issue to Hsiao's work. 
"This is going to be a very important piece of work that we hope will rationalize the manner in which physicians are paid," said Dr. James Todd, the AMA's senior deputy executive vice president.

Associated Press 
BOSTON--A long-awaited study being released this week could dramatically change the way doctors are paid, sharply reducing fees for many kinds of operations while raising charges for office visits. 
The study has been the object of intense speculation and ap­prehension in the medical world since it was undertaken 2 years ago by economist William Hsiao of the Harvard University School of Public Health. 
The massive project at­tempts to determine the amount of work involved in everything doctors do--from checkups and well-baby visits to brain surgery and coronary bypasses--so they can be paid what their services are worth. 
There is widespread agree­ment, Hsiao said, "that the cur­rent payment system is un­workable. The fees are distorted and inequitable." 
Hsiao's plan, requested by Congress, will try to correct that. It would pay physicians more for the time they spend thinking about patients, ex­amining them and talking to them and less for specific procedures. 
In an interview, Hsiao said that if adopted by government health agencies and insurance the column.

specify three programs he would cut to curb the federal budget, and said he would reduce "certain weapons sys­tems, which we don't need and can't afford." He also said he would try to implement a pro­gram of collecting delinquent taxes that has been successful in Massachusetts. 
With that, he focused on Bush, and said the Republican wants to spend more on defense, cut capital gains taxes, spend more money on other programs yet impose no new taxes. 
"If he's serious about what he's saying the only way he can do it is by raiding the Social Security trust fund," Dukakis said. 
"If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe lsuzu of American politics," he said, drawing laughter from the au­dience with his reference to the television advertising charac­ter who exaggerates every­thing he says about the cars he's selling. 
"Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?" Bush said in response. "That answer was about as clear as Boston Har­bor," he said in reference to 
environmental  problems  in  
Dukakis' home state.  
The  first  question  of  the  

debate was about drugs, and Dukakis took the offensive by questioning Bush's leadership on the problem. 
Bush said the reason drug use was exploding was because of a "deterioration of values." 
Dukakis agreed, but said values must begin with the na­tion's leaders. He accused the Reagan administration of dealing with Panamanian Gen. Noriega, whom he referred to as a "drug-running dictator. We've been dealing with him;

our hands off the oars, sit back and drift." 
"We need to challenge people instead of pandering to them," Babbitt urged. How long can we live beyond our means, complacent with our false sense of security, eating ban­quets at the expense of our fu­ture?" 
"America must step up to an enormous act of self­renewal. ... We need better edu­cation; we need to live within our means; we need to re­interpret ourselves," he said. 
"We need a government that doesn't answer every problem with a checkbook." 
Babbitt stressed, "The Cold War is over. We've won. Capitalism has won. Marxism is virtually dead. We need leaders who'll say more than just 'The Russians are coming, the Russians are com­.ing' .... Asia will be the domi­nant force in the next century," he said. 
"Americans must get ready to take it straight," according to Babbitt. "The winds of change are blowing, but not strongly. I know my message is what it's all about, though it may take another messenger to deliver it. I will do my part to support that messenger." 
"When I withdrew from the 
race, it hurt. It hurt pretty bad. 
I wasn't sure if it was all 
worthwhile," said Babbitt. 
he's been dealing drugs to our kids." 
Bush swiftly replied that the Reagan administration moved quickly to indict Noriega on drug charges as soon as it had evidence. 
Bush and Dukakis were all smiles as they walked onto the debate stage. They met mid­way and shook hands before taking their positions behind wooden podiums. 
Bush, vice president under President Reagan for the past seven years, told reporters on the flight from Washington that he was relaxed and determined to beat Dukakis. He said the debate was "the second most important" day of his political life after theNov. 8 presidential election itself. 
Dukakis, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, told several hundred cheering supporters on his arrival that the debate was long overdue. "It's time we had a face-to-face debate and this is going to be a good one," he said. 
The moderator for the debate was Jim Lehrer, co-anchor of public broadcasting's "MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour." 
Three journalists--John Mas­hek of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, ABC anchorman Peter Jennings and Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel reporter Anne Groer--were the questioners. The Republican and Demo­
cratic  parties sponsored  the  
event.  
Both  campaigns  flew  in  a  

team of political heavyweights in a bid to win the inevitable post-debate debate. Top-level . Bush aides were booked for net­work appearances scheduled to begin moments after the debate ended. Democrats countered with their own "spin patrol."

Also on the incomplete roster is the biggest environmental bill of the lOOth Congress, a revision of the Clean Air Act to strengthen the battle against urban air pollution, acid rain and airborne toxic substances. 
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd has warned senators to be prepared for Sat­urday sessions if the lOOth Congress is to end by Oct. 16-­two weeks beyond the original target date for finishing busi­ness.

In the House, a handful of negotiators led by Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., are firmly opposed to a work requirement for two-parent families on welfare. The Reagan administration is just as firm about its insistence that the requirement be included. 
The latest Senate offer adds a degree of flexibility to the work requirement and phases it in starting in 1991.

The bill would help low­income and, to a lesser extent, middle-income families pay for child care and would require child care homes and centers receiving federal money to con­form to minimum federal health, safety, training and staffing standards.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.-­NASA postponed the start of the countdown for space shuttle Discovery by eight hours yes­terday because of lagging preparations, but still aimed for a Thursday morning liftoff. 
"We're still on the timeline for launch on the 29th and that's the plan," said launch director Bob Sieck. 
The countdown was res­cheduled to begin at 8 a.m. EDT today for the first manned American space flight since the Challenger blew up over the At­lantic 32 months ago. 

Deaf Hoosiers fight for legislation 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS-­Hearing-impaired Hoosiers, who say the state has over­looked their needs too long, plan to let lawmakers know this week that the deaf are tax­payers, too. 
That slogan will be on some of the signs deaf Hoosiers and supporters will carry in front of the Statehouse at 8 a.m. Thursday. They figure a rush hour rally is a good way to get their concerns across tq large numbers of people. 
Members of the Indiana As­sociation for the Deaf also have scheduled meetings with legis­lators on the influential State 

The space agency had added 27 unprogrammed hours to the countdown as insurance for last-minute problems, and Sieck said eight hours of that time would be used in advance to complete the work of replac· ing panels and work platforms. 
"We don't want those people to have to do that under the gun with the clock counting," he said. "So we said, 'take all the time it takes and we'll delay the call to stations to accom­modate that."' 
NASA had planned to start the countdown at midnight, but "buttoning up" the aft end of the spaceplane--akin to closing

Pro-choice arguments lack foundation 
In recent years, abortion has become one of the most controversial and volatile issues. The actions of ex­tremists on both sides, however, have clouded the real problem and replaced it with name-calling and firebombing. At the heart of the matter is the fact that abortion is the murder of an inno­cent human being. Pro-choice individ­uals will argue that, firstly, a woman has the right to control her own body; secondly, that a fetus is not a person; and thirdly, that a woman has the right to choose abortion. When one glances at these arguments, one may find them to seem reasonable --but, at close study, will find them vague aud un­sound. 
Andrea Burman 
guest column 
The statement, "a woman has the right to control her own body," implies that she may do as she pleases in all ways. However, if she becomes intox­icated and proceeds to drive a car she will be· arrested, if she catches the chicken pox, she will not be allowed in a classroom, and if she scrawls graffiti on a building, she will be fined. Thus no right is absolute. When the "right to control" one's own body enters the realm of abortion, it implies a pregnant body. Though the pro-choice movement would have one believe that only the woman is involved in pregnancy, fetol­ogy has proven that, in fact, there are two bodies and that a fetus is a patient that can be transfused, operated on, etc. By the first ten weeks of gestation, a fetus has feet and hands, can eat, dream, suck his thumb, and feel pain. Because half of those aborted fetuses are unborn females, it seems a woman does not have the right to control her own body. 
Another argument is that the fetus is not a person. But, as stated above, preg­nancy involves two separate bodies. Pro-choice individuals first argued that the uterine contents were simply tissue which was part of the woman. Now tissue has the same genetic makeup as its owner. Fetologists and biologists, however, proved that the uterine con­tents possess a unique genetic makeup, thus . dismissing this tissue theory. Today, a major assertion is that a fetus may be of the human species, but that it is "potential" life. At all times, we are "potential" teenagers, "potential" adults, "potential" professionals, etc., but are we not always human? Biologi­cally, life begins at conception, but when do we become "human"? Does some physical change indicate humanity? But bone development is not complete until the teens, internal or­gans are not fully formed until the twenties, and the mind does not reach full development until the sixties, and by then, the body is deteriorating until death. Thus we are creatures of contin­ual change, and size or rate of devel­opment or age do not indicate exactly when we are fully "human." Once an individual is denied personhood, soci­ety may do what it likes to it because it has no rights, as was done to the blacks and the Native Americans in the past. 
A third argument for abortion is that it is a woman's issue and that she has a right to choose. It is supposedly be­tween a woman and her doctor, yet many doctors do not mention the pos­siblilities of hemorrhaging, sterility, a punctured uterus, and even death. It is often said, "I personally oppose abor­tion, but I support the right of others 
Would it not be broad­minded of us to say, "I would never send a Jew to the gas chamber but I support the rights of others to choose"? 
to choose." The right to choose seems to be a very democratic thing, yet what if_ one said, "I personally oppose slavery, but I support the right of others to choose?" Would it not be broad­minded of us to say, "I would never send a Jew to the gas chamber but I support the right of others to choose?" It was these attitudes which gave mass support ot the slavery system and to the murder of over six million Jews. Ideally, then, if the right to choose is a universal one, a father should have a right to save his unborn child, a tax­payer should have a right to choose not to pay for abortion-on-demand, a fam­ily should have the right to be involved in their minor daughter's decision to abort, and an unborn chi\d should have a right to live. Unfortunately, the law denies all of these. 
A further question here is that, if one personally opposes abortion, why does he condone it in others? If it is a rela-

tively safe procedure, with little or no physical or mental consequences, why personally oppose it? But, if there is a question of the safety or the morality of it, how can one condone it in others? A common response is that it is OK in cases of rape. Rape is always a difficul1t issue, and the disgust it generates in society makes abortion seem like the best answer, if a pregnancy should result. Rather than giving the woman the counseling and loving support that she needs, society gives her the impres­sion that an abortion will erase the trauma completely. But psychiatrists say that, in fact, an abortion may add an even further burden to a victim, even more so than would giving birth. 

The act of abortion is, in essence, not unlike the act of rape. Rape is an act of aggression on an innocent human being --the rapist acts out his rage on his victim's body. In the same way, so­ciety tells women to act out their rage by doing violence to yet another inno­cent body. There is such an outrage at the crime of rape that society automat­ically seeks out revenge. But it ends up giving the sentence of capital punish­ment to the innocent, unseen child, rather than to the rapist. After all, does killing the child really help the woman? It may help society, but it does not help the two individuals most involved.

P.O. Box Q 
Right-To-Life cares for all humans 
Dear Editor: 
Once more, the blight of politics-­governmental, social and personal--has left its stain in our midst. In his Sept. 22 letter "Pro-lifers guilty of hypocrisy," Mr. Mukul Ranjan, with one unsubstantiated, sweeping blow, in­dicted all those who struggle to protect the rights of the unborn children as cal­lous, ignorant hypocrities. Un­provoked, and uninhibited by lack of evidence or proof, Mr. Ranjan attacks the Right-To-Life movement as one deaf to the cries of the war-torn, im­poverished, oppressed people of the world. In doing so, he sets in motion the machinery of the political mindset which polarizes and tears asunder those who strive for a universal goal: The betterment of the human condition. 
How tragic that Mr. Ranjan, a person obviously concerned with the global protection of human rights, cannot see that we who demand the recognition of the most fundamental of these rights-­the right to life--stand at his side. How tragic that Mr. Ranjan fails to recog­nize that pro-lifers, who alone can never hope to heal all the world's wounds, pray to be flanked by others fighting the battle for justice on other fronts. Though each hears the vocation to a separate mission, all work for a common cause--to insure that proper dignity and justice is paid to human life in all its forms. 
We may betray the weakness of Mr. 
Garry Trudeau

Ranjan's assertions by simply revers­ing his central argument. Might one reasonably accuse those who spend their lives battling famine, or crying out for peace, or sheltering the home­less of caring naught for the unborn? 
Mr. Ranjan asks whether we of the Right-To-Life movement know how many are being killed by war, famine and poverty, and whether we care. The answer to both questions is: We do. The fact is, those who truly support the right to life give equal regard to all human life and feel equal pain for the loss of an unborn child as for starvation of a child in Ethiopia. In the eyes of the just, the innocent child in its mother's womb is no mere "group of cells" (as Mr. Ranjan asserts). Neither is the famine­stricken child only another statistic. There exists no ambiguity in either case. Both children deserve compas­sion; both deserve justice; both deserve to live. 
Though the purpose of Mr. Ranjan's unprovoked attack remains obscure, its potential effect looms ominous indeed. Dichotomizing our efforts in political divisions will do nothing to further the establishment of justice in our world. Attacking one another and so weaken­ing all the causes for which we struggle defeats the common purpose of all those who fight for human rights. We must all band together in a united effort to save humankind from itself.

Belles up record to 3-0 
By MOLLY McNEILL Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's soccer team continued its winning season by shutting out the Purdue Boilermakers, 3-0. 
Greer Gilliland was the first of the Belles to strike, scoring an una£Sisted goal just six minutes into the first half. 
Greer intercepted the ball at midfield, dribbled down the length of the field and booted it in the net from 20 yards out. 
The Belles had many other scoring opportunities through­out the half, but the tough Purdue defense refused all but one of the Belles' 18 first-half shots. 

The Belles came out strong in the second half, working to get an insurance goal early on. After failing to capitalize on three corner kicks, Kelly Fraleigh put one in the upper right corner, giving the Belles a 2-0 edge. 
With five minutes remaining in the game, a Boilermaker penalty resulted in a direct kick for the Belles. 
Kelly Cook took the shot, which went off a Boiler defender and into the goal finishing the scoring in the Belles victory. 
The Belles take a 5-0 record into their next home game Wednesday against the Univer­sity of Wisconsin.

middle for the score. 
Watters then returned his second punt of the year for a touchdown, accelerating what was already becoming a blowout. 
The Purdue offense contin­ued to sputter under McCarthy, who completed 9-of-19 for 51 yards and two George Streeter interceptions. 
"The first one he threw right at me," said Streeter. "We noticed from the films that he looked down a receiver. But it wasn't that easy. They execute their pass offense very well." 
Freshman Brian Fox replaced McCarthy with 3: 57 left in the half, and he was greeted by a Pat Terrell inter­ception. 
Meanwhile, the Irish already were on their third quarter­back. Senior Steve Belles threw the first touchdown pass of his career when he hit Brooks over the middle. The converted ful­lback caught the pass at the Purdue 34, and ran untouched into the end zone. With the score 42-0, the game was just about decided. 
"All we could do in the second half is try to get some­thing positive going for us," said Akers, who also had

several more linemen fall to in­juries in the game. "Not in terms of erasing 42 points,"but trying to do something we could build with." 
Likewise, the Irish used the second half to give the second and third teams a lot of work. Billy Hackett's 44-yard field goal and tailback Rodney Cul­ver's 36-yard scamper around the right end, both their first careeer points, capped the Irish scoring. 
In the fourth quarter the second-team defense stopped Purdue with a first-and-goal at the four, but on the next drive Fox found Calvin Williams in the end zone for a 10-yard touchdown pass, breaking the shutout. Sophomore saftey Greg Davis stopped the last Boilermaker drive with an in­terception. 
IRISH ITEMS --The Irish emerged injury-free except for Belles, who strained ligaments in his left knee. His status is day-to-day.

Bills, Bengals both win to run NFL records to 4-0 
Associated Press 
Perfection still suits the Buf­falo Bills and Cincinnati Ben­gals after four weeks of NFL action. 
The Bills stayed unbeaten with a 36-28 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers Sunday as Robb Riddick scored two quick touchdowns in the third quar-. ter, one on a blocked punt, and Scott Norwood kicked five field goals. 
The Bengals, a last-place team in the AFC central last year, moved to 4-0 by scoring all their points in the first half in a 24-17 decision against Cleveland. lckey Woods had a pair of 1-yard scoring runs and Lewis Billups went 26 yards for a score after recovering Kevin Mack's fumble. 
The Bengals have the right rhythm as they've gotten out of the gate faster than any Cincin­nati team since 1975, Paul Brown's last season as coach, when they were 6-0. 
Bears 24, Packers 6 

Chicago extended its recent mastery in the NFL's longest rivalry with its seventh straight, keeping Green Bay winless this year. 
Neal Anderson ran for two touchdowns and the Bears struck for 17 points in the final five minutes of the first half. Chicago also sacked Randy Wright five times and inter­cepted him twice, including once in the end zone by Shaun 
Gayle to stop a fourth-quarter drive. 
Jets 17, Lions 10 
The Jets won their third straight game as Ken O'Brien completed 27 of 38 passes for 253 yards and two touchdowns. O'Brien, who connected with AI Toon 10 times for 75 yards, found Wesley Walker alone in the corner of the end zone with 

9: 39 remaining for a game­winning 26-yard pass. 
New York's defense, which had not allowed a touchdown the last two weeks, gave up a 1-yard scoring run to Garry James in the third quarter. 
Cowboys 26, Falcons 20 
Disaster had been Steve Pel­luer's companion late in games this year. In both of Dallas' losses, Pelluer threw defeat­
clinching interceptions. 
This time, the fifth-year 
quarterback turned it around, 
hitting Ray Alexander for a 29­
yard score with 1: 48 to play. 
Other scores 
In other action Sunday, Dean Biasucci kicked five field goals to lead the Colts past the Dol­phins 15-13. Allen Pinkett scored three touchdowns to lead Houston past New En­gland 31-6. The Vikings edged the Eagles 23-21 nad the Saints topped the Buccaneers 13-9.

receivers. One series later on third and five from the Purdue 48, Rice hit a sliding Pat Eilers for a 10-yard gain. On the next play, Rice kept on the option and rambled 38 yards for the first Irish touchdown. · 
In the next Notre Dame se­ries, Rice again hit a diving Eilers for another third-down conversion at the Notre Dame 
34. Six plays later, Rice hit a wide-open Derek Brown for the touchdown. 
"I thought all along that if we get Tony some protection, he would be an awesome quar­terback," offensive guard Tim Grunhard said. "He proved the critics wrong. He hit the long pass, the short pass, ran and scrambled." 
Rice chose the dramatic ap­proacli for his passing encore in the next Irish series. 
On the first play from scrim­mage, Rice faked a hand-off and hit a streaking Ismail down the middle for his second pass­ing touchdown of the afternoon. 
"We proved to everybody that we can pass," Rice said. "If we didn't prove anything, we would have to start over. We have a lot of confidence in the passing game. We just have to keep on performing well." 
Overall, Irish quarterbacks completed 8-of-14 passes for 147 yards. Not bad statistics con­sidering Purdue brought the nation's top-rated pass defense into Notre Dame Stadium. 
"We hoped to make them throw when we wanted them to, but we couldn't," Boiler coach Fred Akers said. "We had no illusions. We knew Rice could throw the ball." 
More importantly, the emer­gence of the passing game es­tablished Notre Dame as a two­dimensional team. No longer do the Irish need to rely on the running game to control the tempo. No longer can opposing defenses key on the Notre Dame backfield.

Aussies beat Soviets; Louganis dives again 
Associated Press 
SEOUL, South Korea--The long-anticipated clash between the United States and the Soviet Union in women's basketball won't decide the Olympic gold medal after all. 
Instead, the semifinal game Tuesday morning (Monday night CDT> will only determine who will play for the gold Thursday morning <Wednesday night CDT). The loser can do no better than a bronze. 
The other semifinal matchup pits Australia against Yugos­lavia. 
The U.S.-Soviet game had been expected to decide the championship. But a prema­ture matchup was created Sun­day by Australia's 60-48 upset of the Soviets. 'The loss, their second In the preliminary round, dropped the Soviets to second place io their division. 
The Americans, who topped their division by going unde­feated, completed preliminary play Sunday by dumping China 94-79. 
The American and Soviet wo­
men have met only once before 
in Olympic play, the Soviets 
winning 112-77 in a 1976 semi­
final. 
The Soviets went on to win 
the gold that year, the first that 
women's basketball was an 
Olympic medal sport. 
-The Soviets also won the gold 
in 1980 when the United States 
boycotted the Moscow Games. 
In 1984, it was the Soviets who boycotted, and the Americans won the gold in Los Angeles. 
A U.S.--Soviet gold matchup appears still on track in men's volleyball. The undefeated Americans wrap up prelimi­nary play Monday night against winless Tunisia, while in the other division the unde­feated Soviets play Brazil, whose only loss was an upset to South Korea. 
American Greg Louganis doesn't have Soviets to fear as much as a 10-meter tower. A week after inflicting a five­stitch gash on his head by hit­ting the 3-meter springboard, Louganis goes for the gold Tuesday morning in platform diving. 
He will be trying to become the first man to win both the springboard and platform golds in consecutive Olympics. 
He won the springboard last week by shaking off the effects of his scrape with the board in the preliminaries. Striking his head on the three-story high platform could be much more severe. 
He hit his head on a platform once before, in the Soviet Union in 1979. He was unconscious for 20 minutes. 
Louganis admitted being nervous and frightened before last week's springboard finals, but he overcame his anxiety. 
"Fear is a part of anything that you do, whether it's in business or sports," he said. "You always have to take a chance to have big rewards."

Irish soccer teams combine for four weekend WinS 

The Observer I Eric Bailey

It was a big weekend at Moose Krause Field as the Notre Dame women's soccer team swept its men's team. Pete Gegen details the men's action weekend opponents in two shutouts, as did the below and the women's two victories at right.

Men w1n two physical battles 
By PETE GEGEN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame soccer team gave Western Michigan and Southern Birmingham a lesson in physical soccer this weekend at Krause Stadium. 
Forcing the guest tea-ms out of their short-pass, ball-control games, the Irish busted the Broncos 3-0 Friday night and tamed the Panthers 5-0 Sun­day. 
"We had a set game plan,"· said Southern Birmingham co­ach Preston Goldfarb, "but we never executed it. We couldn't adjust to Notre Dame's style of play, They play very hard for 90 minutes, never letting up." 
Playing their best team defense of the season, the Irish and keeper Danny Lyons regis­tered two important shutouts. Tight marking by Danny Gor­
don,  Dave  Augustyn,  Mike  
Drury,  and  Steve  and  Paul  
LaVigne frustrated  both  

teams, especially the Western Michigan forwards. 
"As soon as we'd go to turn with the ball, they would be on us," said Bronco coach Blake Glass, who was unhappy with the officiating in the match Friday. "When I coach, I rely on the referee to allow us to play our game, but he was let­ting it go." 
Forward Randy Morris was the offensive star against the Broncos, assisting freshman Mitch Kern on the first goal at 19:06, and then beating two Western Michigan defenders with dazzling moves to score an unassisted goal at 55:02. 
"Their sweeper was coming on," said Morris of the play. "The only thing I could do was push the ball between the defenders and pop through. And the goal was open, so I shot. 
"You really don't think on a play like that. You just see an opening and go." 
John Guignon knocked home a rebound at 83:54 to finish the scoring. 
Sunday Irish forward Bruce "Tiger" McCourt started the fireworks with two goals, in-eluding a rocket which Panther keeper Stefan Hofer couldn't handle. 
"The grass wasn't wet, so I was able to cut and control the ball better," said McCourt, who has been slowed by a sore foot. 
Another blast by McCourt was saved by Hofer, but Morris put home the rebound at 37:11 to make the score 3-0. Joe Sternberg added two second-half goals on assists from Kern and Morris.

the second half that the Irish would win their eighth game of the year, the-physical play on the field turned ugly. Irish for­ward Steve Archer suffered a collarbone injury when Pan­ther midfielder Oliver Lurz ran over Archer on a "violent charge" infraction. Later Lurz sent Irish midfielder Warrick Muldrow head-over-heels with a tackle, yet the referee did not even give Lun a caution. 
"I wasn't happy with how many fouls weren't called," 
-said Irish coach Dennis Grace. "We're getting too many injur­ies. As the game wore down and they knew they lost, they did some things to hurt us." 
Any danger of a letdown in Sunday's game against Bir­mingham Southern, an NAJA school, was erased by a -few words from the Panther coach. Several Irish players indicated that word had gotten back to them that Goldfarb called Notre Dame "an average team" after watching Friday night's game. "We had no prob­lem getting psyched up for this game," said Morris. 
IRISH ITEMS --McCourt's foot and Archer's injury adds to a growing list of injured Irish players. Morris and both LaVignes are playing through lower leg injuries, and Lyons is playing with a sore knee. 

Women roll over Adrian 7-0, topple St, Joe's again, 3-0 
By PETE GEGEN Sports Writer 
58-1. 

That was the final shots-on­goal totals for the Notre Dame women's soccer team's two games this weekend. 
And, yes, that lone shot on goal by a St. Joseph's player was saved, and the Irish rolled two shutout wins over Adrian 7-0 and St. Joseph's <Ind.) 3-0. 
Friday afternoon the Irish teed off on Adrian, outshooting the small Michigan college 37­
0. Alicia McNeill scored twice and Mimi Suba had a goal and an assist. K.T. Sullivan, Julie Constantini, Susan Haling and Susie Zilvitis each added single tallies. 
If the sport were basketball, Irish coach Dennis Grace would be accused of padding the schedule just to make the tournament. But as Grace ex­plains, these mismatches in the first year of varsity women's soccer at Notre Dame could not be helped. 
"Because the promotion of the girls' team to varsity hap­pened so late," explained Irish coach Dennis Grace. "we had to make as many concessions in scheduling as possible to get a full complement of games in­stead of just 11 or 12. We will upgrade the schedule next year. -Sunday's game against St. Joseph's is a prime example of this problem. Two weeks ago the Irish blasted St. Joseph's 8-1 at Renssalaer, Ind., but a rematch was already sched­uled at Notre Dame. 
Predictably the Irish wasted no time jumping to a big lead over St. Joseph's Sunday. Joy Sisolak and Susie Zilvitis each had unassisted goals and K.T. Sullivan added a third just before halftime. 
At halftime Grace decided to make fullback Kelly Hanratty a goalkeeper, forcing his team to concentrate more on ball control than teeing off at the St. Joseph's goal. The move helped, as the Irish did not al­low a single shot on goal in the second half.

Otfense rediscovers pass; Rice keys offensive output 
By GREG GUFFEY Sports Writer 

This first half was for the critics and the doubters. In a bigger way it was a confidence builder for Tony Rice and the Notre Dame offense. ' . Rice, criticized for his l~ck of passing success in wins over Michigan and Mic­higan State, sparked the Insh romp over Purdue Saturday in Notre Dame Stadium. 
The Irish w~re supposed to dominate the Boilers, and Rice took it upon himself to lead th_em mto battle. After co~pleting only 5-of-21 attempts in the opening games, Rice connected on four-of-six passes for 85 yards and two touchdowns in limited playing time. 
"I thought Tony threw more in the game today.like he has in practice" Irish coach Lou Holtz said. "For the first time, I felt he didn't overstride. Don't' get me wrong. lfie's not ready to play on Sunday yet."
