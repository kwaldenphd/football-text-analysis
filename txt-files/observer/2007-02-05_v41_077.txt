the Trustees have Notebaert elected me as their sixth chairman," Notebaert said in a statement Friday. "I look forward to 
joining with our president, Father John Jenkins, in advancing our position as the premier Catholic research universi­ty in the world."

Off-campus options draw students 
Break-ins, disorderly house ordinance don't deterfuture residents, say local landlords 
By MARCELA BERRIOS Assistant News Editor 
From the threat of burglary to the city's disorderly house ordinance to the perils of unplowed South Bend roads, there is plenty to give students pause before they move off campus. 
Local landlords, however, report no drops in the number of students leasing one of their homes or apartment complexes -saying, in fact, that factors that might drive future resi­dents away are not factors at all. 

Burglary concerns 
Turtle Creek Apartments general manager Francie Schmuhl said break-ins-one of the biggest fears of students moving off campus -are easi­ly avoided, as long as the stu­dent takes simple precautions. 
"Preventing break-ins depends largely on the com­mon sense of the resident," Schmuhl said. "You don't leave your iPod laying around in your car for everyone to see and you certainly shouldn't leave the front door unlocked either." 
She said there were no bur­glary reports filed at Turtle Creek in December, despite the holiday migration of most stu­dent tenants-an achievement she credited in part to the pres­ence of. a state trooper and a county officer who permanent­ly reside in two of the 192

Event attracts teams from across nation 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
The Notre Dame Air Force ROTC hosted its 21st annual basketball tournament this weekend, drawing Air Force, Army and Navy cadets from universities nationwide to the Joyce Center for the largest athletic ROTC gathering in the nation. 
Cadets from Texas A&M, San Diego State University and the University of Georgia were among approximately 400 tour­nament participants. 
Although a few teams were unable to make it to the tourna­ment due to weather condi­tions, 14 women's teams and 38 men's teams competed in the three-day event. 
"It was extremely competitive ... in the beginning, there were a lot of weaker teams coming [to the tournament] for fun but in the final rounds it got very competitive," said sophomore Air Force cadet Nathan Loyd. "In many games, last second plays decided whether a team would have to start their long drive home or stay for another game. A couple of games were won by points scored in the very last second of play." 
Texas A&M beat Notre Dame's Navy team in the men's finals Sunday. Each team was placed in a bracket of four

Keenan Revue skits amuse, offend audience members 
By EVA BINDA News Writer 
With skit names like "Gaybraham Lincoln" and "A Big Fat Floppy Cavanaugh" listed on the program, the 2007 Keenan Revue organizers set the tone before the curtains even opened Thursday. 
Nothing was safe from the Keenan Revue writers. who targeted everyone from Breen-Phillips girls to University President Father John Jenkins during the three shows this weekend. 
Popular skits included "Talk Love with Dos Padres," which featured two priests answering a fictional Notre Dame sex hotline to give students advice, "Catholic Disney World," a rendition of Aladdin's "A Whole New World" with inside jokes about Notre Dame substituted for the original lyrics and "And Then We Got In." which joked about what students learn after arriving at Notre Dame.

RecSports launches magazine 

By JOHN-PAUL WITT News Writer 
Students found a new source of reading material last week when Notre Dame's RecSports delivered a copy of its new magazine to the mailbox of every on-campus resident. 
The inaugural issue of Rec features articles about student­athletes and details ways to become more involved in the recreational activities offered on campus. 
The magazine profiles stu­dents Maureen Spring and James Zhang and contains information on club sports, nutrition and RecSports' new personal trainer program. 
Co-director of RecSports Sally Derengoski said planning for the magazine began at the start of this year. 
"We wanted to do something that was fun, enjoyable and informative," Derengoski said. "This is a little bit different than what RecSports normally does. We have a lot of good stories about students to share." The two writers for the maga­

Nick Possley of Notre Dame's Navy ROTC won the overall MVP award for the men's division and Stephanie Thompson of Marquette won the women's MVP. 
While the basketball tourna­ment is an annual highlight for Notre Dame's ROTC, it also inspires teams from around the nation to prepare all year for the opportunity to travel to South Bend. Loyd said teams like Texas A&M will already be fundraising and holding tryouts for next year's compe­tition. 
Notre Dame's Air Force ROTC cadets, led by junior Tony Crosser, were in charge of organizing the tournament. Crosser said he began plan­ning the first week back at school. 
As head basketball tourna­ment officer, Crosser was in charge of sending out invita­tions to every ROTC unit from across the country, finding facilities for the event, order­ing trophies and making T­shirts and programs. 
"I definitely consider the tournament to be a success. It was a lot of hard work and the staff did a wonderful job when I as playing and couldn't be there," Crosser said. "All the other teams were telling me that they wanted to come back next year." 
Sophomore Air Force cadet Brian Woodlock. who was in charge of finding referees for the tournament, said the event was a great way to interact with other ROTC cadets. 
"It was a competitive atmos­phere, but it was also a lot of fun to meet other cadets from across the country ... and have a good time together," he said.

Officer Derek Dieter from the South Bend Poliee Department (SBPD) -also a member of the South Bend Common Council ­advised students contemplating off-campus residenees to comb the neighborhood they're con­templating before they commit with a deposit. 
In his capacity as councilman on the city's Health and Public Safety Committee, Dieter said high tenant turnovers in any given neighborhood usually sig­nal a large number of students -since they only need housing for a handful of semesters -or a significant degree of unrest, if South Bend's permanent resi­dents also fail to remain there for extended periods of time. 
The committee, he said, moni­tors these turnovers and other indexes to serve as a "barometer for the threats in the city." 
Some of these threats include criminals who trail out-of-state license plates to pinpoint student residences, Dieter said. 
He advised off-campus stu­dents to take preventive actions against such lurkers by "closing your blinds, leaving the lights on when you go out and fustalling a simple alarm system." 
"These measures will tip the odds in your favor," he said. 
The SBPD told The Observer earlier this year the number of break-ins at student residences in South Bend during the winter vaeation decreased from eight in 2005 to three in 2006, which they attributed to increased pre­ventive measures, including additional alarm systems and requests from the residents for patrols to circulate their neigh­borhoods during their absence. 
One of the break-in incidents last month occurred at a student residence on St. Peter Street, one of landlord Mark Kramer's 175 Millhouse said he was "com­properties. pletely oblivious" to the ordi­

Millhouse may have developed a strategy to elude thieves, but in the fall he and his housemates will have to deal with another concern: the city's disorderly house ordinance. 
Disorderly house ordinance 
Since mid-2005, students off eampus have had to abide by a new amendment to South Bend's disorderly house ordinance, which stipulates that the city can send tenants -and their land­lords -a notice to abate after a single noise violation. 
If the noise violation reoccurs, both parties will owe the city a fine, unless the landlord evicts the tenant within 30 days.

said. "We try to educate the stu­

Still, junior Marina Cardona 
also leased a Castle Point apart­
ment for the 2007-08 sehool

the city have imposed on her. 
"I just look forward to deciding

more breathing room in deter­
mining the volume of the music 
and the amount of friends they 
may entertain Friday nights, but 
not all students have fled South 
Bend to eseape the disorderly 
house ordinance. 
Kramer said he recently pur­chased Notre Dame Apartments and Lafayette Square Townhouses to meet the rising demand for off-campus student residences, and more than 50 students have already signed leases to occupy his properties during the 2008-09 year. 

"Demand is high and increas­ing," he said. "We're signing leases two years in advance, so I wouldn't say the noise ordinance is discouraging students from moving off eampus." 
Stadium Club Condominiums property manager Susan Miller said the complex was also "almost full." 
Along Bulla Road, Miller said, Stadium Club neighbors a 20­year-old series of senior citizen residences, allowing the apart­ment complex to offer students "a quieter, more residential area." 
"We have our share of parties but generally they're not half of the parties you find at other apartment complexes," she said. 
Miller said 42 of the 52 Stadium Club apartments were already leased to students for the fall. · 
One of those students living at Stadium Club may be junior Frank Guerra, who got a taste of independence for the first time during his semester in the Washington D.C. program. 
"I really have enjoyed the apartment lifestyle and I feel a lot more responsible for myself, cleaning and cooking and taking out the trash," he said. "It seems like I had been missing out on that these last two and a half years." 
Guerra cited the absence of watchful rectors as another fac­tor that drove him to lease an apartment off campus next year. 
"Oh wait, du Lac still applies off campus," he said, laughing. ''I'll be sure to remember that."

Italian officer killed in soccer match 
ROME -Months after a game-fixing scandal shook Italian soccer, the sport was rocked again when rioting by fans left a police officer dead and scores of people injured. 
The mayhem, during a game between Sicilian teams Catania and Palermo, prompted soccer offi­cial<> to suspend this weekend's matches_ the first time that has happened in more than a decade. 
Italian soccer officials canceled Wednesday's exhibition game between Italy and Romania, and threatened to extend the suspension.

China calls for UN intervention 
President warns reluctant Darfur rebels to 'join the peace process' 
Associated Press 

ALJAILI Chinese President Hu Jintao told Sudan's leader on Friday he must give the United Nations a bigger role in try­ing to resolve the conflict in Darfur and also said China wanted to do more business with its key African ally, Sudan state media reported. 
In what appeared to be China's bluntest message to Sudan on the Darfur crisis, Hu urged President Omar al-Bashir in a face-to-face meeting to boost the U.N.'s "constructive role in realiz­ing peace in Darfur" along with the African Union, the official Sudan news agency SUNA reported. 
China buys two-thirds of Sudan's oil and is the largest investor in the country, giv­ing it some leverage with al­Bashir's government. Sudan has defied a U.N. Security Council call for the under­powered African Union mis­sion of 7,000 troops in the western region of Darfur to be taken over by a U.N. operation of 22,000 peace­keepers. 
China usually refuses to mix human rights issues with diplomacy, but Hu has come under international pressure to use his clout with Sudan to push it to accept U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur. More than 200,000 people have been killed in four years of fighting in the region between rebels and the army, backed by the notorious janjaweed militia. 
Human rights activists expressed concern ahead of Hu's eight-country tour of Africa that China is over­looking abuses to gain access to Africa's resources. Africa has become an important source of oil and other natural resources to feed China's rapid economic growth. 
Sudanese officials briskly ushered journalists out of the room Friday when Hu began voicing his expecta­tions on Darfur to al-Bashir. Later, a Sudanese official told The Associated Press that Hu had told al-Bashir his government "should work more earnestly to get the rebels who did not sign the Darfur peace agreement to join the peace process." 

The government signed the peace agreement with one rebel group last May, but other rebels rejected the accord as inadequate and the conflict escalated. 
This week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki­moon urged Sudan to accept a compromise deal by which a U.N. force would deploy in Darfur in a "hybrid mission" with African peacekeepers. Ban has also asked China's 
U.N. ambassador for help in trying to persuade the Khartoum government. 
Sudanese Foreign 
Minister Lam Akol insisted that Hu's words on Darfur were not hostile. 
Akol told reporters after the meeting that Sudan was willing to see the mixed U.N. and African Union force deployed in Darfur "as soon as funding and troops were secured." 
Diplomats in Khartoum said Hu's position on Darfur could be linked to Chinese concerns about Sudan's sta­bility, as well as that of neighboring Chad. The Chinese have recently improved relations with Chad, which also has impor­tant oil reserves and is fight­ing rebels in eastern provinces. Chad has accused Sudan of backing its rebels -a charge that Khartoum denies. 
Diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the issue is not set­tled, said the U.N. is pushing to have 10,000 to 15,000 peacekeepers in the region. Akol said Sudan would agree to whatever number a committee of Sudanese, 
U.N. and AU experts decid­ed. 
However, Sudan has a record of backtracking on agreements concerning Darfur, and some presiden­tial advisers say al-Bashir has not agreed to anything more than an advisory role for the U.N. 
Sudan wanted to draw attention to the trade and investment side of its rela­tionship with China.

Chavez backs environmentalists 
Associated Press 

CARACAS -His ambitious social programs are built on Venezuela's petroleum wealth, but President Hugo Chavez is increasingly talk­ing up environmental causes and urging the world to cut back on oil use to fight global warming. 
He wants to use some oil rev­enues in a venture to manufacture solar panels and has begun doling out millions of energy-saving fluo­rescent light bulbs to homes nationwide. 
Some critics say Chavez's cam­paign is mostly rhetoric, noting this is a country where govern­
ment subsidies have gasoline prices at 12 cents a gallon, car sales are booming and vehicle exhaust chokes litter-strewn streets. 
But Chavez says Venezuela can be an example, and he has begun exhorting his followers to drive less and take public transport. His government plans a windmill farm to generate electricity on the Caribbean coast and is exploring more uses for cleaner-burning nat­ural gas. 
"Venezuela is one of the coun­tries that least contaminates the environment, but nevertheless we want to give an example and be at 
the vanguard," Chavez said at a news conference Thursday. 
He called U.S. oil consumption­which handsomely funds his gov­ernment -a leading cause of the world's environmental troubles. 
"They're destroying the world," Chavez said, citing melting gla­ciers in the Andes and predictions of rising sea levels. "The human race will be finished if we don't change the world capitalist sys­tem." . 
Leftist ideology colors Chavez's views, and he has spent time dis­cussing the dilemma of climate change with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, his friend and mentor.

Kids join weight-loss surgery trend 
AP 
Kevin Federline is featured in a clip from the Nationwide Super Bowl ad "Life Comes at You Fast." 
Super Bow1features con1peting, funny ads 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Along with the trademark Clydesdales, talking animals and high-end computer graphics, there was a new entry this year in the annual show­down of advertisers in the Super Bowl: amateurs. 
Starting in the first quarter, a goofY spot for Doritos showing a hapless driver distracted by a pretty woman passing by marked the first time a purely amateur-created ad aired during the Super Bowl. Frito-Lay, the PepsiCo Inc. division that makes Doritos, ran an online competi­tion to pick the winning spot. 
Katie Crabb, a freshman at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point, was the winner of a separate contest by General Motors Corp. and had her idea for an ad made into reality by Chevrolet's marketing division. 
Despite being made by a new­comer, that ad was true to the tradition of using oddball huinor in Super Bowl ads, showing a number of men stripping off their shirts -and some other articles of clothing -at the sight of a new Chevy HHR rolling down the street. 
Sight gags were back, includ­ing one from Bud Light early in the game showing a rather unusual tactic for winning at rock-paper-scissors-throwing an actual rock at the head of your opponent. The gag wasn't completely new, however, since last year Sprint Nextel Corp. fea­tured a phone with a "crime deterrent" -which turned out to be throwing the phone at someone's head. 
FedEx Corp. combined a sight gag with another trademark of big ticket Super Bowl spots, fancy computer graphics, with an other-worldy ad showing an office worker drifting off into space from the world's first office on the moon, only to be clob­bered by a passing meteor. 
A lot is riding on the ads, and not just because CBS Corp. is charging as much as $2.6 mil­lion for a 30-second spot during the game. With some 90 million people watching, it's the most­viewed program all year on tele­vision and the ads are subject to intense scrutiny, both by ama­teurs and the marketing indus­try. 
Coca-Cola Co. was back in the game after a long absence, tak­ing on its rival Pepsi with a num­ber of creative ads, including an homage to Black History Month with an understated ad showing the changing shapes of Coke bot­tles over time as milestones in black history appeared along­side. Other ads also highlighted Black History Month and high­lighted the fact that, for the first time, both coaches in the game are black. 
Some of the uses of humor didn't resonate well with experts. Stephen Greyser, a pro­fessor at Harvard Business School specializing in communi­cations and the business of sports, said the rock-throwing spot by Anheuser-Busch Cos.' Bud Light was "attention-get­ting" but also "had a nasty char­acter to it." 
Bud Light, which often swings for the fences with wacky jabs at humor, scored better with Greyser with a different spot showing an auctioneer saying wedding vows at hyper-fast speed. Greyser said that spot had a much broader appeal. 
The job-search company CareerBuilder ditched its long­time office-monkey pitchmen of years past in favor of a jungle combat scene among office workers, where office supplies become weapons. Think of "Dilbert" meets "Lord of the Flies." 
Tim Calkins, a marketing pro­fessor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University who runs a panel of students to rate the ads, called this year's batch a "mixed bag," saying advertisers were "being safe," with no one "pushing the edge of either creativity or taste." 
An ad early in the game for Blockbuster Inc. with computer animations of animals trying to push, click and -ouch -drag an actual mouse resonated well with members of his panel, who said it was creative and also delivered the company's mes­sage. The panel found a spot by King Pharmaceuticals Inc. show­ing a guy dressed up in a giant red heart costume "puzzling," while Garmin International Inc.'s oddball spot with a showdown between a superhero-like char­acter and a monster made from maps was deemed "hard to fol­low.'' 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -As the popu­larity of stomach surgery has skyrocketed among obese adults, a growing number of doctors are asking, "Why not children, too?" 
For decades, the number of kids trying weight-loss surgery has been tiny. The operations themselves were risky, with a death rate of about 1 in 50. Children rarely got that fat, and when they did, pediatri­cians hesitated to put the developing bodies under the knife. Only 350 U.S. kids had such an operation in 2004, according to federal statistics. 
But improvements in surgical technique and huge increases in the number of dangerously obese children have begun fueling a change of heart. 
A group of four hospitals, led by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, are starting a large-seale study this spring examining how children respond to various types of weight-loss surgery, including the gastric bypass, in which a pouch is stapled off from the rest of the stomach and connected to the small intestine. 
Three more hospitals have approval from the Food and Drug Administration to test how teens fare with a proce­dure called laparoscopic gas­tric banding, where an elastic collar installed around the stomach limits how much someone can eat. 
The FDA has hesitated to approve the gastric band for children, but surgeons at New York University Medical Center reported in the Journal of Pediatric Surgery this month that the device holds promise.

Similar studies are under way at the University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago and at the Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, which recently opened a weight-loss surgery center for teens. Doctors there expect to con­duct about 50 operations this year. 
Children are only considered candidates for surgery after they have spent six months trying to lose weight through conventional methods under human digestive

Doctors, she said, still know relatively little about the long­term effects of such operations on the very young. 
The federal Agency for 1-Iealthcare Research and Quality released a study in July that said four in 10 weight-loss surgery patients develop complications within six months. Among adults, mortality rates among gastric bypass patients remain at between 1 in 100 and 1 in 200 patients. 
Laparoscopic gastric banding has been shown to have a much smaller death rate ­about 1 in 1000 patients -but complications do occur.

IN BRIEF 
Alternative fuels cause rise in com price 
NEW YORK -Forget about oil as the inflation bogeyman we should fear the most. The surging price of corn is the latest threat to Americans' wallets, and where it hits them may go beyond the supermarket. 
The issue here really starts with the govern­ment's push to increase the use of alternative fuels like ethanol to reduce a reliance on foreign oil. Since most ethanol produced here is made from com, that burgeoning boom is straining com supplies, and boosting prices. 
That makes everything from soda (sweetened with high fructose com syrup) to the steak from corn-fed beef more expensive. It's also crimping ethanol producers' profitability, which could lead to calls for increased federal subsidies to keep them afloat. 
This could particularly hurt consumers on the lower end of the income scale, who spend 16 per­cent of their discretionary income on food com­pared with the 11 percent for those in the top­income quintile, Merrill Lynch chief North American economist David Rosenberg said. 

Indiana lnsing 890jobs in plant closure 
CONNERSVILLE, Ind. -Visteon Corp. plans to close an eastern Indiana auto-parts plant, idling 890 employees, the company announced Thursday. 
Closing the plant in September is part of the company's three-year plan to fix, close or sell about 30 facilities to make Visteon more globally competitive, Visteon spokesman Jim Fisher said. 
"We've done a very thorough review of this facility," Fisher said. "We do not believe there is a viable business case for continuing to operate it." 
The plant in Connersville, some 60 miles east of Indianapolis, has about 7 50 hourly and 140 salaried employees. It produces climate control products like heating and air conditioning sys­tems for several vehicle manufacturers. 
"Some of that work will go away as certain products reach the end of their production run," said Kimberley Goode, vice president of corpo­rate communications for Michigan-based Visteon. "Most of the remaining work will move to other Visteon plants."

Bush wants to spend $2.9 trillion 
Plan to reduce deficit directs money to Iraq, cuts health care costs, keeps tax cuts

WASHINGTON -Pres­

Congress a $2.9 trillion 
spending request today that 
seeks billions of dollars more 
to fight the Iraq war and 
tries to restrain the spiraling 
cost of the government's big

Responding to the new 
political rea-lities of a 
Democratic-controlled 
Congress, Bush will propose 
balancing the budget in five 
years, matching a goal put 
forward by Democratic lead­

Racism is certainly a strange bird: rec­ognized by some, overlooked by others, even considered extinct by a few more. It is tempting, at times, to take a look around modern America and conclude that color blindness 
truly has become the norm. 
After all, we have certainly come a long way from the period portrayed in PEMCo's latest musi­cal, the pre-World 


War I days of Joey Falco "Ragtime." In an era when members of all Forty Ounces races resorted to vio-to Falco lence and overt racial slurs simply as a means of sur­vival and self-preservation, it was easy for the United States to glance in the mirror and recognize the hypocritical duality of the so-called American dream. 
Early in "Ragtime," Coalhouse Walker, the show's black protagonist, glances around at the promise of American democracy and proudly sings, "We'll see justice, Sarah; we'll see plenty of men who will stand up and give us our due. Oh, Sarah, it's more than promises; Sarah, it must be true. A country that lets a man like me own a car, raise a child, build a life with you." Of course, the dark side of 1906 America ­racism, violence and the preservation of class stratification -quickly punctures the wheels of Coa:lhouse's dream. 
Today, however, we seem above that. The American enlightenment of the 1960s, led by prophet-philosophers like Martin Luther King Jr., opened the nation's eyes to the tragic cruelty of a country that promises equality but gives nothing. Today, almost 40 years after Dr. King's assassination, racism, some would say, is also dead. 
After all, a conspicuously big deal has been made of the fact that African Americans currently hold the posts of secretary of state, Supreme Court jus­tice, House majority whip and the chair­manships of the House Judiciary, Ways and Means, Homeland Security and Ethics Committees. Other races, as well, are strongly represented politically in 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 
such posts as attorney general, secre­tary of commerce and secretary of labor. The leading Democratic candidate for the presidency in 2008, Barack Obama, is the son of a Kenyan. One could also point to the fact that yesterday not only gave America its first black coach to appear in a Super Bowl, but its second as well. On top of that, there are individ­uals like Oprah Winfrey and BET founder Bob Johnson, both of whom are listed as billionaires by Forbes. 
However, to steal a line from Hamlet, this nation doth protest too much, me thinks. 
If racism actually ceased to exist, very little would even be said about the unusual success of these nonwhite indi­viduals. If racism were truly dead, for­mer Virginia Sen. George Allen would never have faced public shame for call­ing an Indian man a "macaca." If racism really died along with Dr. King, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden would have had no reason to refer to Baraek Obama as "the first main­stream African American who is articu­late and bright and clean and a nice­looking guy." If racism was gone, the drunk Louisiana State fan sitting behind me at the Sugar Bowl would never have told me that Notre Dame was lucky not to have a n-----quarterback like them. 
Even here at college, where students are supposedly taught to look beyond the confines of race, racism has made headlines lately. Two Southern universi­ties -Clemson in South Carolina and Tarleton State in Texas -have erupted in a firestorm of racial tensions in the past few weeks because of photos posted online of white students attending Martin Luther King Day parties. At Tarleton State, students were shown cel­ebrating the holiday by drinking malt liquor out of brown paper bags and eat­ing fried chicken while dressed as gang members or Aunt Jemima. At Clemson, some students even wore blackface to their party. 
Fortunately, these schools have had the issue of racism thrust into the open, and both are now actively engaged in black-white dialogues and discussion groups about the topic. At Notre Dame, however, the question of racism often remains unaddressed. 
While no one has yet to me a formal complaint (most likely due to the over­whelming whiteness of the campus), race-based party themes pop up here all the time, too. "Ghetto Fabulous" parties, "Hampton-Compton" parties, and proba­bly dozens more in which racial stereo­types are encouraged have certainly taken place in numerous dorms, apart­ments and houses in South Bend in recent years. I've been to many of them myself. 
Sure, racial humor is a remarkably easy way to make people laugh -partly because in a diverse nation like America, everyone's a little bit ra,cist. The sight of white students wearing black face and dressing as Aunt Jemima, however, is a tragic play on an era of overt racial oppression that no American should use as an excuse to get drunk. You don't see many "Holocaust" themed college parties, and while no event can possibly ever be compared to the systematic killings of that period, racism certainly can be considered America's enduring, albeit less blatant, equivalent. 
It's about time we grow up a little, and a good start would be to make a con­scious effort to think before we crack subtly racist jokes or throw overtly race­themed parties. Yes, it's a lot different than engaging in the racial violence depicted in "Ragtime," but America still has a long way to go toward becoming a truly fair and equal nation, and every lit­tle bit helps. 
With far larger issues facing America in the very near future-global warm­ing, poverty and terrorism -it is time to recognize the oneness of the American people for the sake of the greater good. To quote "Ragtime's" Coalhouse Walker once more, "And say to those who blame us for the way we chose to fight, that sometimes there are battles which are more than black or white." 
Joey Falco is a senior American Studies major and Journalism, Ethics and Democracy minor. He encourages everyone to attend the forum on "Ragtime" and race in America at 7:30 
p.m. on Wednesday in Washington Hall.

LETIER TO THE EDITOR 
Questioning 
Siegfried's claitn 
to manliness 
We applaud the residents of Siegfried for raising money for South Bend's Center for the Homeless during their Day of Man. However, we believe that Tom Martin's claim that Siegfried is "one of the manliest dorms on campus" is unfounded. 
Fortunately for the Ramblers as well as all other dorms on campus, there is an opportunity this weekend to truly prove your (wo)manliness. At 2 p.m. Saturday, beginning in front of Morrissey Manor, there will be a two-lap "Polar Run" around South Quad. This race is a dorm competition (we will even provide everyone with body paint) and the winning dorms can make uncontested claims as the manliest or womanliest dorms on campus. 
After the race, there will be free hot cocoa and cider and we will be collecting money for St. Vincent de Paul. If you missed out on Siegfried's Day of Man or are looking for another way to prove your (wo)manliness while sup­porting a good cause, come to Morrissey's Polar Run this weekend.

Where'd the Renaissance n1en go? 
I can't formulate my feelings of aversion about the way things are going in this world into an outline. I can't look at a piece of art and tell you what tech­niques invoke such emotion in me. I can't play music. I don't know what the heck I am looking up at on a clear summer night. 
But I can feel. I can absorb Brenna all of those things and create Mcnamara some abstract way of describ­ing them. And I get happiness Daily Kent from that. Unfortunately, that's Stater my problem. I could earn a Kent State doctorate in "feeling," but in University reality it's emotions that are cheap, not words. In a world that is becoming so technical, so mathematic, is there any room for cre­ativity? 
We live in a society obsessed with the bottom line. We are in a rush to get to the top, fmd the easiest solutions and be successful. It's not a phone any­more, it's the iPhone. They aren'tjust doctors, there are pediatric orthopedic finger doctors. As Americans, we can't just be. We have to be the best. We have to specialize. So long to mom-and-pop shops. They're replaced by corporate chains that offer much more of everything, except persol)ality. It's good to go to a lawyer that specializes in eviction processes -obviously he knows his stuff. Good for him. But I'm one of those flighty people who fmd attending classes upon classes about writing con­tracts a bit dry. 
Yes, people do have different strengths. There's an enormous difference between the left brain and the right brain, this is only natural. But I'm just posing the thought that possibly our society is being influ­enced by all the pressure to fmd the fastest solution and the hardest facts. Emotions and instinct are far too abstract for such a concrete world. 
In this path to success, too many times a person must rule out passions and hobbies because they aren't on this narrowed down road to making money. Now, it seems pointless to even wonder what stars I see in the night sky unless I'm an astronomer. I can appreciate a painting, but if! can't have it, recreate it, or major in art history, my passion seems fruitless. I am pissed at our country and this mean­ingless violence, but since I'm not part of the govern­ment, I am just preaching or being ridiculed for being so idealistic. 
Where did the Renaissance men go? Those men of Da Vmci's time who were masters of art, poetry, astronomy, anatomy and architecture. Congratulations to anyone nowadays who could accomplish all of that. Hopefully you didn't get too many people asking you, "How are you going to turn all those majors into a career?"

Macs n1ight be pretty, but not n1uch else 
If you read the paper Thursday, you know that Ball State University stu­dents can download the full top-of-the­line version of VIsta, Microsoft's new operating system, for free. I'm going to download it. Why? Because I'll Joanna be getting a $400 Lees operating system and software Daily News suite for free. I 
Ball State 

think it's a great Universitydeal. Insert howls of derision from Mac users here. Follow this with me blowing raspber­ries at the Mac users. 
I've used both Macs and PCs for lots of things since I've been at college. In fact, as long as I've been computer lit­erate, I've been able and willing to use both systems. I use Macs in my jour­nalism classes and when I'm at work. They're excellent machines for graph­ics, movies and audio work (as the commercials remind us daily). 
But aside from that, there's not much else they can do. 
I've never liked that I can hardly do anything on a Mac without using the mouse. I'm a touch typist, so my hands prefer to stay on the keyboard as much as possible. On a Mac (like the one I'm using to write this column), I can use the keyboard to perform about 20 dif­ferent functions, most of which still involve the mouse in some capacity. 
On my trusty little Toshiba (which runs Windows), the number of key­board functions is Limited only by the number of menu options in each pro­gram. I simply press Alt to highlight the toolbar, then navigate through with the arrow keys until I find what I want. Easy-peasy. 
Granted, most Mac programs have keyboard shortcut<; for most of their menu options. But do they really expect me to remember every single combination? When I'm on a roll and I want to change my font, I don't want to have to stop what I'm doing and look up the "shortcut." I might as well just do everything with the mouse. 
Of course, there's always the ques­tion of reliability. Windows 95 and 98 made the "blue screen of death" famous, and PCs are notorious for crashing, eating files, deleting data, etc. Macs, on the other hand, have the reputation of an armored car. 
Except that in five years, I've lost more files to Macs than to PCs. I've owned two Wmdows machines since I came to college, and in all that time I have yet to see a single blue screen of death. Sure, I get a few security prob­lems every now and then, but that's why God made Norton AntiVIrus. PCs get spyware because the world runs on Wmdows. The only reason Macs don't get viruses is because no one's both­ered to port the viruses over. The ratio of time spent versus computers infect­ed is just too lousy. It's hard to deny hackers are a practical bunch. 
Macs sell themselves as the comput­er for cool, sophisticated hipsters. PC users, ifthe commercials are accurate, are a bunch of dumpy businessmen in plain suits. But what the commercials don't show is that when the Mac guy's trust fund runs out in a few years, he's going to be flipping burgers because you can't base a career on the strength of your iLife portfolio. Meanwhile, the PC guy will be sitting pretty in his condo in the Bahamas, sipping a daiquiri and watching his stocks mature. Turns out those boring spreadsheets were useful for some­thing after all, huh? 
Macs may be pretty, but like I said: The world runs on Windows.

Keenan Revue lackluster compared to past 

DVD REVIEW 

'Lambs' DVD adds little to horrific, historic film 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Ediror 

Just in time for the upcoming "Hannibal Rising" comes a new two-disc "collector's edition" of Jonathan Demme's "Silence of the Lambs." The film that made Hannibal Lecter the cine­ma's most famous cannibal, "Lambs" was also a critical smash, winning all five of the major Oscars at the 1991 Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay). 
The second film based on the novels of Thomas Harris -the first is 1986's "Manhunter," directed by Michael Mann and starring Brian Cox as Lecter -"The Silence of the Lambs" launched Anthony llopkins into superstardom and solidified Jodie Foster as a major talent. It follows rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Foster). as she pursues the serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). Starling and her boss, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). employ the hPip of incarcerated serial killer Hannibal "The Cannibal" Leeter. 
Lecter slowly leads Starling to the mur­derer, but through a series of mind

games that threaten to break down the fragile agent. 
"The Silenee of the Lambs" is anchored by its strong performance and the sure­handed direction of Demme, who gives the film a stylish -and somewhat styl­ized -look .and feel. Hopkins' perform­ance is one of cinema's all-time greats, and he managed to take home the Best Actor statuette, despite less than 20 min­utes of screen-time. Foster more than holds her own, and her strong-willed performance also won her a Best Actress Oscar. 
"Lambs" is also a modern classic, and its plethora of awards helped make it a template for its genre -it is the only horror film that has ever won the Bnst Picture Oscar (though the term "horror" has to be used loosely). As a chilling and disquieting pieee of psycholngieal drama, it remains nearly unsurpassnd, especial­ly by its inferior sequels, "Hannibal" (directed by Ridley Scott, with Julianne Moore in the role of Starling) and "Hod Dragon" (directed by Brett Ratner). It's difficult to believe that "Hannibal Rising" will come close to matching the effectiveness of "Lambs," espeeially with­

By ERIN McGINN Assistant Scene Ediror 

While this year's Keenan Revue fea­tured several hilarious skits, the show did not match previous levels of great­ness. Slightly tamer than past produc­tions, this weekend's show still featured the Revue's trademark humor -just not as much as in past years. 
The Revue followed a Dr. Seuss theme with the title "One Fish. Two Fish, Red Fish, Revue Fish." The opening skit went by the same name and cleverly introduced "fish" common in the Notre Dame community (the "jersey-chaser fish," the "Lizzi Shappell fish" and the "Osama Bin Laden fish"). 
The strongest skits were usually the simplest. In order to provide time to­prepare the more elaborate pieces, there were short 30 second to one minute-long skits in the vein of a one­liner joke. The skits "Stepladder," "GEICO" and "Jedi Inferno" were among the best of this variety. They worked so well because of their punch and quick wit -there was basically was no time to screw it up. 
The worst skits were the exact oppo­sites -they seemed like they would never end. While these often had good intentions and funny moments, they dragged on too long, often losing what­ever humor they initially had. Among these was "My Heart Hurts All the Time," with a guy singing about the sad story of his life. While it was humorous at points, it quickly lost audience inter­est, especially since it came close to the end of the first act. 
That skit was quickly outdone by "Driving My Uncle" less than a minute later. Again, while the idea of a kid driv­ing around with his very bizarre uncle is funny for the first couple minutes, it quickly waned and got stranger and less funny the longer that it was allowed to continue. This skit did not have the per­tinence to those familiar with Notre Dame and came across and funny but too random. 
Similarly, the second half of the Revue was marred by such failures as "Th£1 Wiggles" (an overly long mockery of children's shows), "Gaybraham Lincoln" (a terribly unfunny and mildly offensiv£1 portrayal of a play about our 16th presi­dent being gay), and "A Big Fat Floppy Cavanaugh" (a string of sexual innuen­dos and jokes told only using the names of female dorms on campus). 
There were also several skits that were good, but definitely short of great. Among them was "The Keenan Revue News," usually considered a favorite amongst audience members. While it was stronger and funnier than much of the Revue, it wasn't as good as in past years. Poor and off-timed delivery along with a lack of enough Notre Dame-oriented events hurt its overall performance and effect. 
"Talk Love with Dos Padres" had two priests working as Notre Dame sex-help phone operators. This was a genuinely funny skit that wasn't given nearly enough attention and could have been made longer to replace one of the afore­mentioned skits that weren't very funny. Similarly, the skits "Next" (a parody on the MTV show, but with a search for a savior) and "Go Fish!" (where guys play the game of "go fish" with girls' lD cards at the dining hall) had the poten­tial to be a great deal funnier if organiz­ers had devoted more attention and time to them. 
Thn standout performanees included "Legnnds," whieh mocked the old game show "Legends of the Hidden Temple," "Catholic Disney World," an outrageous­ly funny parody of the song "A Whole New World" from the Disney film "Aladdin" explaining why Notre Dame is the theme park's Catholic equiyalent and "Captain Planet and the Inconvenient Truth," which played on the "Captain Planet" cartoon show and Al Gore documentary that decries global warming. Easily the best skit of the evening was "And Then We Got In," which involved two guys hilariously explaining the non-academic precon­ceptions of Notre Dame and what they learned upon arrival. 
The 2007 Keenan Revue had its moments, but it couldn't stack up to those of the past. Although it was evi­dent much thought and hard work went into the Revue, it wasn't the best Keenan has offered.

The audio and visual quality haven't been upgraded since the last release, which was more than live years ago, so there really isn't a reason for anyone who already owns the film to upgrade. 
"The Silence of the Lambs" deserves better than this edition, and it's unfortu­nate that tl:w Criterion is out of print (and its special features with it).

DPAC SPOTLIGHT 
New Orleans Jazz Orchestra heats up DPAC 
Irvin Mayfield brings Big Easy culture to South Bend 

David Pulphus provides the musical backbone of the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra with his bass lines during its Saturday concert at the DPAC. 
By MICHELLE FORDICE 
Scene Writer 
From the moment the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra walked on stage Saturday and bridged the tuning of its instruments straight into a melody, the group filled the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center's Leighton Concert Hall with an energy it doesn't often see. Flexible and stirring, the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra is not one to miss. 
Director, composer and trumpeter Irvin Mayfield established the non-profit orchestra in 2002. The group presents the strong tradition of music in New Orleans culture, mixing jazz, blues, swing and spirituals. It has performed in arenas like Ravinia, Jazz at Lincoln Center and the Congressional Black Caucus. It also symbolically re-opened New Orleans with the first major cultural event after Katrina -a performance of "All the Saints" at Christ Church Cathedral. The 16-piece orchestra tours the country not only as a talented musi­cal ensemble but also as an ambassador from the Katrina-devastated city. 
Mayfield is a Grammy nominee and a member of Los Hombres Calientes, which was nominated for two Billboard Latin Music awards and one Grammy and won a Billboard for "Volume One." He is also highly involved in New Orleans politics and culture, serving as the city's cultural ambassador. 
The players are as good performers as they are musicians. On Saturday night, they joked with each other and the audi­ence throughout the concert. Mayfield treated his introductions to each song as a personal conversation: explaining the context of the songs, introducing his uncle who sat in the audience and "dedi­cating" the performance to getting back at the Bears for beating the New Orleans Saints in

strong and subdued with bassist David Pulphus and rose from there as the rest of the orchestra gradually joined in with both instruments and voices, humming and singing, "People in the city better get to higher ground." As the music wan­dered away and then came back to its center it soared to greater heights. 
In "It's a Creole Thing, You Wouldn't Understand," Evan Christopher "put the sexy back in the clarinet," according to Mayfield. Christopher dis­played the fluidity and

as each musician took his "Someone Forgot to solos. During these, the Orchestra is not one to Turn the Faucet Off, fellow players gave mur­miss. Probably Steve" inter­
murs of approval and whooped their apprecia­tion, displaying their own love of the music. 
The orchestra's first song after the opening, "Second Line" from Duke Ellington's suite dedicated to New Orleans, was cool and fun, featuring the clarinet and trombone. 
Mayfield composed the next song, "Higher Ground," which was inspired by a statement by a 911 operator during Hurricane Katrina. The song was meant to encourage not just the people of New Orleans, but all Americans, Mayfield said, to rebuild one of the country's treasures. "Higher Ground" began twined a feeling of over­
flowing tension and urgency with an oblivious fun, illustrat­ing how as a child Mayfield left the faucet running for five hours while his mother was away. 
Mayfield introduced· "Ballad of the Hot Long Night" by saying that jazz ballads are one of the most meaningful mediums for love songs because they embody "love that words can't express." The softly sensual song led by pianist Victor Atkins was beautiful. 
The vocalist on "Route 66" twisted and turned through the piece and passed it on to a wonderful small ensemble featur­ing the clarinet, trombone and trumpet. 
The orchestra concluded with "May His Soul Rest in Peace," composed by Mayfield in memory of his father and the other victims of Hurricane Katrina. The song was both mournful and filled with hope. Mayfield's trumpet rose above the rest of the surging orchestra, moving the audience and laying the souls to rest. 
It was also wonderful to hear the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra try its album, "Strange Fruits," which features the Dillard University Choir. "Strange Fruits" 
. builds on Billie Holiday's song by the same name -which protested the prevalent lynching of African Americans in the South during the early 20th centu­ry -expanding it into a nine-movement jazz oratorio. Like its concert, the CD covers a wide range ofjazz sound. The concert featuring the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra also marked a new experiment between the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center and Legends of Notre Dame. Audience members had a chance to purchase the first dinner and performance packages offered by the DPAC, which provided savings on both. Overall, the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra provided a wonderful evening of jazz. It strove to connect with its audi­ence while incorporating truth into its music and personality into its playing.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL -BIG EAST 
Villanova grinds out home win over Louisville 
Syracuse ends three-game losing streak; UConn tops Rutgers in overtime; Marquette, West Virginia pick up wins 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Shane Clark scored 12 points and Mike Nardi had 11 to lead Villanova to a 57-53 win over Louisville on Saturday. 
Curtis Sumpter scored 10 points and Scottie Reynolds had 10 assists as Villanova (15-7, 4­5 Big East) snapped a two-game losing streak with a win the Wildcats sorely needed if they want to crack the top half of the Big East standings. 
Earl Clark led the Cardinals (16-7, 6-3 Big East) with 14 points while all four of their double-digit scorers failed to reach that mark. Terrence Williams, Juan Palacios, David Padgett and Edgar Sosa were all non-factors, combining for only 24 points. 
Sosa, who averaged 11.2 points, didn't get going until it was too late. He scored his first bucket on a layup with 39 sec­onds left that pulled the Cardinals to 55-50 and hit 3­pointer with 4.3 seconds left that made it 57-53. But it wasn't enough and the Cardinals snapped a four-game winning streak. 
The Cardinals never led until Williams hit a 3-pointer early in the second to make it 30-29. 

After a small Villanova run, Williams evened it at 34 after another 3-pointer, making his only minor contributions. 
Syracuse 75, DePaul 69 
Eric Devendorf scored a career-high 27 points, including four free throws in the fmal 35 seconds, and Syracuse beat DePaul on Saturday to halt a three-game losing streak. 
Syracuse (16-7, 5-4 Big East) rebounded after being humbled 103-91 by No. 21 Notre Dame on Tuesday night. DePaul (13­11, 4-6 Big East) lost for the fourth time in five games. 
The win was No. 742 in head coach Jim Boeheim's 31-year career at Syracuse, breaking a tie with former Temple coach John Chaney for 14th on the all­time list in Division I. It also avenged an embarrassing 108­69 loss last year to DePaul, which made 16 3-pointers in handing the Orange the worst defeat of Boeheim's Hall of Fame career. 
Andy Rautins hit a career-high six 3-pointers for a career-high 18 points and Devendorf tied his career high with five 3s. Terrence Roberts had seven points and six rebounds, and Demetris Nichols had eight points. 

AP Marquette guard Jerel McNeal goes up for a shot in the Golden Eagles' 69-62 win over Providence Saturday. 
Draelon Burns, who had a career-high 26 points in DePaul's 66-58 win over Connecticut on Wednesday, again scored 26, Wilson Chandler had 11 points and 13 rebounds, and Sammy Mejia had 12 points and seven rebounds. Karron Clarke, who was 5-for-5 on 3-pointers and finished with a career-high 27 points in last year's win, had six points. 
Connecticut 61, Rutgers 50 {OT) 
Jeff Adrien had 19 points and Connecticut ended a five-game losing streak Saturday by beat­ing Rutgers in overtime. 
Connecticut (14-8, 3-6 Big East) won despite not scoring a field goal in the final 4:3 7 of regulation or in the extra peri­od. 
The Huskies' last field goal, by Craig Austrie, put them up 42­34. 
But the Scarlet Knights chipped away and pulled within two when Anthony Farmer hit a 3-pointer with 11 seconds left in regulation. 
UConn extended the lead back to three, but Farmer grabbed the rebound of a missed free throw by Stanley Robinson, drove down the right side of the court and hit a running shot from just behind the arc as time expired. 
Another 3-pointer by Farmer with just over three minutes left in overtime gave the Scarlet Knights the lead at 50-49, but UConn ended the game on an 12-0 run, all on foul shots. 
UConn was 24 of 36 from the line. 
Adrien scored 14 of his points after intermission. Jerome Dyson and Austrie each had 13 points for UConn and freshman center Hasheem Thabeet added eight points, 11 rebounds and five blocked shots. 
Jaron Griffin led Rutgers (9­14, 2-8) with 18 points, and Farmer had 13. The Scarlet Knights played without J.R. Inman, the team's leading scor­er and rebounder, who was attending funeral services for his grandmother. 
Three other Scarlet Knights ­Adrian Hill, Hamady N'Diaye and Ollie Bailey -fouled out. Bailey gave the fans an obscene gesture as he left the court. 

Marquette 69, Providence 62 
Jerel McNeal didn't want to spoil Dwyane Wade's big day. McNeal had 18 points and tied 
a career high with 12 rebounds, and Dan Fitzgerald had four 3­pointers to help No. 14 Marquette win its seventh straight game, beating Providence on Saturday. 
The victory came as Marquette retired Wade's No. 3 jersey at halftime. 
"It was a real emotional day for him," McNeal said. "We defi­nitely didn't want to mess that up by losing." 
Sharaud Curry led Providence (14-7, 4-4 Big East Conference) with 17 points. Herbert Hill added 14. 
With the victory, the Golden Eagles (20-4, 7 -2) reached the 20-win mark for the second straight year and fourth time in coach Tom Crean's seven-plus seasons. 
The Golden Eagles last won seven straight conference games in 2002-03, Wade's last with Marquette, en route to a 27-6 season and Final Four berth. 
"We can get a lot better," Crean said. "I tell the team I was part of 22 straight at Michigan State as an assistant." 
Wesley Matthews made all 10 of his free throws and finished with 12 points for the Golden Eagles. 

Providence, coming off its first road win of the season at Connecticut last Saturday, held Marquette star Dominic James to six points, tying a season low, on 2-of-11 shooting but had no answer for McNeal early. 
West Virginia 81, Seton Hall 
70 
For the next three years, Seton Hall and Rutgers are going to regret not having recruited Da'Sean Butler of Newark a lot harder. 
Butler capped a show for both New Jersey schools over the past four days by scoring a career-high 21 points to lead West Virginia to a victory over Seton Hall on Saturday. 
It was the second straight career game for Butler, a back­up freshman forward who had 17 in a win over Rutgers on Wednesday. 
"It was definitely special com­ing back to see my family and just to play against the teams we were playing," said Butler, a for­mer Bloomfield Tech player who came into the game averaging 
9.5 points. "Rutgers and Seton Hall are well coached and play hard. It felt real good to come on and play real well here."

MIAMI -A wet and wild Super Bowl, the winning conditions for Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts. 
A team built for indoors found its footing on a rain­soaked track· and out­played the Chicago Bears to win the NFL title 29-17 Sunday night. The Colts were far less sloppy, par­ticularly their star quar­terback, who proved he can indeed win the big game-the biggest game. 
That's what it was for Tony Dungy, too. He became the first black coach to win the champi­onship, beating good 
friend and protege Lovie Smith in a game that fea­tured two black coaches for the first time in Super Bowl history. 
It was a game of firsts: the first rainy Super Bowl and the first time an open­ing kickoff was run back for a touchdown when sensational Bears rookie Devin Hester sped down­field for 92 yards. 
And not since the Buffalo Bills self-destructed with nine turnovers in losing to Dallas 14 years ago had there been so much messi­ness. The first half was marred by six turnovers, three for each team. Even football's most clutch kick­er, Adam Vinatieri, missed 
IN BRIEF 

Woods' _putter drops him to 
third in Dubai Classic 
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates ­Exasperated by his poor putting, Tiger Woods headed home after one of those rare weeks in which he did not win a tournament. 
He finished two strokes behind winner Henrik Stenson in third place Sunday, unable to make a successful title defense at the Dubai Desert Classic before a gallery that included Roger Federer and Michael Schumacher. 
Woods can take consolation in knowing his streak of seven straight victories on the PGA Tour is still alive, but he knows there's work ahead. 
"That's one of the worst putting weeks I've had in a long time," said Woods, who shot a 3-under-par 69 to finish at 17-under 271. ''I'm going to go home and just kind of figure it out. Hopefully get my putting organ­ized before I compete again." 
a chip-shot field goal, and an extra point attempt was botched, too. 
The second half wasn't quite so ugly, but when much-maligned Bears quarterback Rex Grossman's wobbler was picked off and returned 56 yards for a touchdown by Kelvin Hayden with 11:44 remaining, it was over. 
Chicago (15-4), which led the league in take­aways this season, fmished with five turnovers, includ­ing two interceptions by Grossman. 
The Colts (16-4) will take it. It's their first title since the 1970 season, when they played in Baltimore. 
Manning ended up 25­for-38 for 24 7 yards, with one touchdown and one interception, and was the game's most valuable play­er. 
It was confirmation of his brilliance, even if he didn't need to be dynamic. The son of a quarterback who never got to the play­offs, Manning has been a star throughout his college career at Tennessee and his nine pro seasons with the Colts. 
Now he is a champion. 
It also was a validation of Dungy's leadership. He helped build Tampa Bay, one of the NFL's worst franchises, into a con­tender before being fired after the 2001 season. 
Irvin, Thomas voted into NFL 
Hall of Fame 
MIAMI -Michael Irvin wrapped his arms around Thurman Thomas in the kind of hug that new Hall of Famers share. Somewhere, Paul Tagliabue could only envy their emo­tional display. 
Michael Irvin had 65 touchdown receptions in his 12-year NFL career. In all, eight quarterbacks helped him reach Canton, led of course by Troy Aikman: 
"That embrace Thurman and I had, we talked earlier, we were falling apart on the phone," Irvin said. "We don't sound like cool people that played a tough game right now." 
The former Dallas Cowboys receiv­er with the off-field woes and three Super Bowl rings, was among six for­mer players voted into the Canton shrine Saturday. But the commission­er who guided the NFL for 18 years before retiring last summer didn't even make the first cut. 
Webb shoots even_par during
final round to win upen 
SYDNEY, Australia-Karrie Webb captured her third Women's Australian Open title, shooting an even-par 72 in the final round Sunday for a six-stroke win. 
Webb, who began with a four­stroke lead over Wei Yun-jye. of Taiwan, finished with a 10-under 278 total at Royal Sydney. Wei shot 7 4 to finish second at 4 under. 
"Hopefully, it's a good start to a good year," Webb said. "Obviously, four days ago I would've been happy to sit in the clubhouse at 2­under, so it exceeded my expecta­tions to finish at 10-under on a very good golf course." 
Paula Marti of Spain and Minea Blomqvist of Finland each shot 69 to finish tied for third at 2 under. Brittany Lincicome of the United States and Shin Ji-yai of South Korea also had 69s, finishing anoth­er shot back.

NBA 
Pistons earn win on the road in Cleveland, 90-78 
Lue makes game-winner in overtime to lift Hawks over Nets; Raptors hit season-high points in win over Clippers 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -Rasheed Wallace stepped out of the shower area and reset the track on the portable stereo in Detroit's locker room. Seconds later, he swayed to the boom­ing beat and began to rap. 
"Afraid of none of you cow­ards," he shouted, spitting out lyrics along with hip hop star Nas. 
Wallace might as well have been singing about the Pistons. 
On the road, they fear noth­ing. 
Chauncey Billups scored 18 points, Chris Webber and Wallace had 15 apiece and the Pistons reminded Cleveland who's the boss in the NBA Central with a 90-78 win over the Cavaliers on Sunday. 
Billups added 10 assists, Wallace 13 rebounds and the division-leading Pistons won their fifth straight regular-sea­son game over the Cavaliers, who pushed them to seven games in last year's playoffs. 
With their third win in a row, the Pistons improved to 15-9 outside Michigan's state lines and are the only team in the Eastern Conference with a winning road record. 
"We expect to win," Billups said. 
The Pistons controlled the tempo from the outset and never allowed a crowd of more than 20,000 fans to begin the Super Bowl partying. Detroit kept it quiet by limiting LeBron James' dunks, and any time Cleveland had a defensive breakdown, the Pistons hit an open jumper. 
"You make a mistake, they know how to exploit it," James said. "We didn't make too many mistakes, but as soon as you make one, they make you pay for it." 
This Pistons' squad is very similar to the one which beat Cleveland last May with one big addition: Webber, who signed with the club as a free agent on Jan. 16 and was fac­ing the Cavs for the first time with his hometown team. 
Webber's presence is bad news for the Cavaliers, who don't appear ready to dethrone their northern neigh­bors. Webber scored 13 points in the first half on 6-of-7 shooting when the Pistons grabbed control and never let go. 
"When Ben Wallace was there, you could kind of relax on the offensive end when he was on the floor," James said. "But now they have five guys that can easily score 20 points. They are a much better team with him [Webber]." 
Detroit is 7-3 since Webber arrived. 
Hawks 101, Nets 99 (OT) 
The way the Hawks mobbed Tyronn Lue at halfcourt after his game-winning shot in over­time, one might have thought Atlanta won a title instead of stretching a road winning streak to three games. 
You have to start some­where. 
Lue hit a 23-foot jumper at the .Quzzer to lift the Hawks to an overtime victory against the New Jersey Nets on spot in the weak Eastern Conference. 

Joe Johnson scored 37 points and Josh Smith atoned for a sub-par game by scoring six of his 14 points in overtime to help the Hawks win their ninth road game. That's more than they won on the road all last season. 
Lue's game-winning shot came after Vince Carter hit a clutch 3-pointer to tie the game at 99 with 2.9 seconds to play. 
After a time out, Lue took the inbound pass, dribbled to the 3-point line and launched his game-winner with his foot on the line. The Hawks tackled . him at halfcourt seconds after the shot hit nothing but net. 
Vince Carter had 27 points to lead the Nets, who lost their third straight since returning from a West Coast road trip. It also marked their fourth loss late in a game in the past eight games. 
"It's a tough loss," Carter said. "We can't be inconsistent and up and down during the course of the game. With us down bodies, we have to come out and play hard and scrappy from start to finish." 
Rookie Marcus Williams had 14 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter and overtime for New Jersey, and Jason Kidd added 13 points, 11 assists and five rebounds. 
The Hawks' best season on the road since 2000-01 was 10-31 in 2003-04. Their three­game winning streak in 00-01 came in a year when they went 7-34 away from home. 
The Hawks came close to blowing this streak, squander­ing leads of seven and four points in the final 3:23 of reg­ulation. They had a chance to win the game in regulation, but Smith, who was 2-of-14 before the OT, missed a wide­open 3-pointer from the right corner. 
Raptors 122, Clippers 110 
Balanced scoring helped the Toronto Raptors gain ground atop the Atlantic Division standings. 
Chris Bosh had 27 points as six players reached double fig­ures for the Raptors, who had a season-high point total in a victory Sunday over the Los Angeles Clippers. 
Morris Peterson added 18 points for the Raptors (25-23), who have won three straight. 
T.J. Ford, Anthony Parker and Jorge Garb~osa each added 17 points for Toronto, which shot 58.7 percent from the field. 
"It's unbelievable," said Toronto's Jose Calderon. "Everybody in this locker room is better than they were in the preseason because we've learned to play as a team." 
A cheer went up in the Raptors' locker room when Tyronn Lue hit a jumper at the buzzer to lift Atlanta to an overtime victory against New Jersey, putting Toronto three games ahead of the Nets. 
The Raptors haven't been .500 this late in the season since 2001-02. 
Cuttino Mobley scored 24 points and Elton Brand had 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Clippers, who had won seven of their past eight games. 
"Give them a lot of credit, they played well, they made shots," Sam Cassell said. "Everything we did to try and stop them, they did better." 
Ford and Calderon, Toronto's two point guards, combined for 27 points and 19 assists. 
Calderon had 10 points and 12 assists and started in place of Ford, who has been both­ered by a sore right ankle. 
"Things are going well right now with the situation, but it's not my call," Peterson said of the point guard shuffle. 
Toronto scored a season­high 66 points in the first half and shot 70 percent, tying a franchise record for shooting percentage in a half. 
Bosh had 19 points to help Toronto to a 66-54 halftime lead. 
Bosh's driving layup gave the Raptors an 18-point lead ­their biggest of the game ­with 6:10 left in the third quarter. Peterson had three 3­pointers late in the game to seal the victory. 
Toronto shot 12-for-20 from beyond the arc. 
Garbajosa, who had strug­gled in recent weeks, made four 3-pointers. 


Sunday, posting their first three-game road winning streak since December 2000. 
"This was a big win for our team," Hawks coach Mike Woodson said. "This is the sec­ond game I've had my nine­man rotation due to all the injuries. From a coaching standpoint it's nice to see us pull through like we did, but we still have a long way to go." 
The win was the fifth in seven games for the Hawks (18-28), which put them 3 1/2 games behind Miami (22-25) in the race for the final playoff

It was nearly a perfect weekend for Notre Dame. 
For the first time in school his­tory, the Irish advanced to the finals of the ITA National Indoor Tournament, but a red-hot Georgia Tech squad stung No. 4 Notre Dame's dream of victory. 
Yellow Jackets freshman Amanda Craddock defeated Irish junior Brook Buck in three sets (2-6, 7-5, 6-2), clinching a 4-2 vic­tory over Notre Dame (5-1) and the title for No. 6 Georgia Tech (4­
0). 
"They just have really good sin­gles and really good doubles play­ers," Irish freshman Cosmina Ciobanu said. 'They just played better than we did."

Squad sets four pool records at Cardinals' Ralph Natatorium 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
The No. 19 Notre Dame women set four pool records at Louisville's Ralph Natatorium on Saturday en. route to a 154-89 road victory over the Cardinals in the team's final meet of the sea­son before the Big East Championships. 
Senior Katie Carroll contin­ued her impressive season with pool record times of 
2:00.46 and 4:52.35 in the 200-yard butterfly and 500­yard freestyle, respectively. Those two wins increased her team-leading number of indi­vidual victories to 17 on the season. 
Carroll, along with sopho­more Christa Riggins, fresh­man Megan Farrell and sen­ior Rebecca Grove, was also part of the record-setting 400-yard freestyle relay team that touched the wall in 
3:27.48. Sophomore Claire Hutchinson was the final swimmer to etch her name in the record books when she won the 1,000-yard freestyle with a time of 10:17.08. 
Saturday's victory over Louisville brought Notre Dame's dual meet record to 8­1 on the season. It is the 15th time in program history that the. Irish have accumulated eight or more dual meet vic­tories in a season. 
On the men's side, the No .

Louisville  147-94.  Notre  
Dame  won  seven  of the 13  

NCAA record that spanned the past three years. Georgia Tech snapped that streak with a 4-3 victory, winning the fmal two sin­gles matches of the meet to com­plete the upset. 
On Sunday, the Yellow Jackets came out firing against the Irish, claiming the doubles point to take a 1-0 lead. After the teams split the first two doubles matches, the unranked tandem of Whitney McCray/Kristi Miller upset Notre Dame's pairing of No. 11 seniors Christian and Catrina Thompson 9-7 to claim the point lor Georgia Tech. It was the first time all year the Irish lost the doubles point. 
Yellow Jackets freshman Kirsten Flower knocked off Irish freshman Colleen Rielley (6-2, 6­1), and Tech sophomore Christy Striplin defeated Christian Thompson (6-1, 6-3) to give the Yellow Jackets a 3-0 lead. 
Catrina Thompson put Notre Dame on the board with a hard­fought victory over Miller (6-3, 2­6, 6-1), and Ciobanu kept the 
events to help them obtain their 11th dual meet victory in 14 tries this season. 
Leading the way for the Irish were sophomore Jeff Wood and freshman Andrew Hoffman, who each picked individual as well as relay victories. Wood won the 200­yard backstroke, and Hoffman touched the wall first in the 200-freestyle. Both were also members of the vic­torious 400-yard freestyle squad along with freshman John Lytle and senior Ted Brown. 
Freshman Andrew Deters 
. built on recent strong per­formances by winning the 1,000-yard freestyle with a 
pressure on the Yellow Jackets by beating Tarryn Rudman (7-5, 6-3) to pull the Irish within one. With the win, Ciobanu earned a perfect 4-0 record in her singles matchP.s for the tournament. 
But Craddock's victory over Buck ended hopes of an Irish comeback. The final singles match between Notre Dame soph­omore KelcyTefft and Tech senior Alison Silverio was suspended before it could finish because the Yellow Jackets had aln~ady won the title. 
The Irish reached tho finals with tins over No. 18 Clemson and No. 10 Baylor in the early rounds and then a victory over No. 8 Northwestnrn sophomore Nazlie Ghazal (7-6, 7-6) to boost the Irish to their first ever finals appear­ance in the tournament.

No. 14 Stephen Bass opened up singles play with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Abougzir-avenging his 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 defeat last year to the Florida State junior. 
"I think [Bass] got a measure of revenge," Bayliss said. 
The Seminoles grabbed their first point of the day when Aubone triumphed in singles over No. 30 Parbhu 7-5, 7-5. Seniors Keckley and King helped the team get back on track with wins at third and fifth singles, respectively. Keckley started the match off slow but quickly rallied to take the match 6-4, 6-2 from No. 76 Maciek Sykut, improving to 12­2 for the season. King captured the final match of the night at No. 5 singles with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Mixson.

"Going into the season there was some question about [King and Helgeson's] ability to blend together successfully and they really proved themselves," Bayliss said. 
Bass and Andrew Roth grabbed a 9-7 win over Kiril Dimitrov and Ned Samuelson to give Notre Dame the doubles point. 
Singles play was a battle of ranked competitors. No. 14 Bass took the win at first sin­gles with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 win over No. 80 Rodrigues. Parbhu made up for his fall Friday night with a 6-1, 6-3 win over No. 100 Atas. Keckley and Helgeson -both unninked ­defeated ranked opponents. Keckley battled it out with No. 84 Arnould to finally triumph 7­6 (9-7), 7-6 (8-6). Helgeson fol­lowed Keckley's lead by knock­ing off No. 54 Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3. 
The Blue Devils gained their only point of the match when Goulet defeated King 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) at No. 5 singles. Roth fin­ished out the night with a 6-7, 6-4, 6-1 win to Aaron Carpenter to five Notre Dame the 6-1 upset. 
The Irish concluded their weekend with a 7-0 blanking of Toledo. 
While Bayliss was concerned the second match of the day might have been difficult physi­cally for Notre Dame, the team proved it was up to the chal­lenge. 
"It's always a little risky play­ing a double header after play­ing a team as strong as Duke," Bayliss said. "But the guys showed a lot of courage."

Sweep

during a 5-on-3 advantage when junior Mark Van Guilder found him open on the doorstep, and the rookie slipped it past goaltender Jimmy Spratt for his sixth of the season. 
The Falcons got one skater out of the box after the goal, but before they could return to full strength the Irish power play struck again. 
This time, defenseman Brett Blatchford fired a pass from the point and Thang, who was parked down low, deflected it into the back of the net. The goal -Thang's 16th on the year -put him one "ahead of Van GuildBr for the team lead. 
"We know that unit has been productive throughout the sea­son. It's just a matter of find­ing more consistency with the other unit," Jackson said of the Irish special teams. 
Bowling Green tied the score in the second period with two goals of its own. Sophomore Brandon Svendsen put the Falcons on the board when he got just enough behind the puck to put it over goaltender Dave Brown's shoulder with six minutes left in the first. 
Senior James Unger then evened out the score at 4:22 in the second when he took advantage of a long rebound from a John Mazzei shot. Brown made the initial save but was not able to regain his feet to stop the second attempt. 
The score remained tied until Irish senior Michael Bartlett netted the game-win­

ner for the Irish on a rebound opportunity of their own. With less than a minute remaining in the second, linemate Jason Paige took a shot from the top of the faceoff circle and Bartlett sealed the deal in a serum in front of the net. 
"I decided to keep [that line] together because they played well against Miami last week­end," Jackson said. "They gen­erated some good cycle plays for us on offense and I can always trust them defensive­!y. " 
Notre Dame 2, Bowling Green 1 
Bartlett played a key role in Saturday's victory as well, scoring the first Notre Dame goal for his third of the year. 
Once again, the senior was down low to pick up a rebound goal when Brock Sheahan's shot from the point was turned away by Jimmy Spratt 7:31 into the second period. 
Freshman Kevin Deeth added another power-play tally for the Irish seven min­utes later. After gaining con­trol of the zone, classmate Kyle Lawson zipped a tape-to­tape pass to Deeth, who tapped it on net and beat Spratt in the five hole. 
The stingy Irish defense took over from there, holding the Falcons to three shots in the final period (15 total), and Brown had no problem turning away the few chances he had to face. 
Notre Dame will put its five­game unbeaten streak on the line Friday when it returns home to face Nebraska-Omaha Feb. 9-10.

Mountaineers coach Mike Carey said. 
At the outset, it seemed like neither team would have much success offensively. Notre Dame didn't score for the first 3:19 of the game, and West Virginia (15-8, 6-4 Big East) didn't get onto the board until 5:35 had elapsed. 
But behind eight first half points from forward Crystal Erwin and six from guard Charel Allen, the Irish went on a 20-6 run to open the game and took a 38-17 lead into the inter­mission. The Mountaineers tally for the first half marked the fewest points the Irish have allowed in a half this season. 
"Give them credit -they took us out of our offense," Carey said. 
The second half started off with more Irish domination as Notre Dame built up a 60-36 lead with just under 10 minutes to play, but an offensive slump and a Mountaineer hot streak allowed West Virginia to make a game of it by the end of the fourth quarter. 
"West Virginia's a really good team and they didn't play as well in the first half as they nor­mally do," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "You could see in the second half what a good team they are." 
Mountaineer center Olayinka Sanni scored eight of her 16 points in the fmal 10 minutes of the game, including six during a 16-2 West Virginia run that helped the Mountaineers cut Notre Dame's lead from 62-40 to 64-56 in a 4:27 span. 
"We had that little bit of a lull, land] we gave up too many easy baskets to [West Virginia!," McGraw said. "I think we got tentative. We were afraid to foul and we didn't play our best defense ... that kind of turned the game around for them." 
With 3:27 left, Irish freshman guard Ashley Barlow made a layup that broke a 14-0 West Virginia run and allowed Notre Dame to increase the lead back to 1 0 and curb the Mountaineers momentum. 
"I knew we hadn't scored in a while, [so] we tried to run the play and they left the lane wide open so.I took it," Barlow said. 
McGraw was pleased with Barlow, who finished with 17 points and eight rebounds.

Barlow's rebound total was second only to Allen's nine. The Irish were dominant on the boards, outrebounding the Mountaineers 46-23. 
"We were really attacking the boards," McGraw said. "We held them to three offensive rebounds in the first half so I thought that was outstanding." 
Still, the Mountaineers didn't go away quietly, and West Virginia sophomore Sparkle Davis' 3-pointer with 1:10 left cut Notre Dame's lead to 68-63 -the closest the Mountaineers came in the second half. 
The Irish made 9-of-1 0 from the charity stripe in the final two minutes, including 4-of-4 by Allen, who finished with a game-high 26 points. For the game, the Irish were 33-39 from the line.

get off to a good start, it's an uphill battle." 
The Bulls took a 31-26 lead into halftime and extended the lead to as many as 10 early in the second half. 
Notre Dame recovered and took a 46-44 lead with 10 min­utes left but couldn't hold on. 
Forward McHugh Mattis led South Florida with 23 points and 16 rebounds. 
"Mattis was fabulous tonight," Brey said. "He made every big play and cleaned up every missed shot. We had a hard time with him." 
Guard Colin Falls led the Irish with 26 points, but Notre Dame struggled in the paint. Forwards Luke Harangody, Rob Kurz, Zach Hillesland and Luke Zeller combined for just 14 points on 6-of-19 shooting. 
"We couldn't get much inside offensively," Brey said. "We need to be able to get it inside to take a little pressure off our shooters." 

Kurz, who was nursing a sprained ankle, played 19 min­utes off the bench. He collect­ed one rebound and four fouls but did not score. 
The junior had been averag­ing 14 points and almost nine rebounds. 
"The first thing we have to do over the next few days is get Kurz healthy," Brey said. "He gave us some minutes but he was hurting." 
The Irish will try to bounce back Thursday against DePaul in Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Ill. 
"I still think we have a very good basketball team," Brey said. "We just have to get some rest and get healthy and get ready for a tough one on Thursday."

No. 2 Irish sweep No. 8 Falcons; top-ranked Ne.w Hampshire splits series with Maine 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
For the second week in a row, Notre Dame got off to a slow start on a Saturday night. And for the second week in a row, the Irish fought back for points. 
After falling behind 1-0 in the first period against Bowling Green Saturday, Notre Dame scored twice to complete a weekend and season sweep of the Falcons, putting itself in the mix for the No. 1 ranking. 
"[Bowling Green] played their best series of the year. They made it difficult to create a lot offensively," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said. "It was a 


matter of grunting out or grit­ting out a couple of wins." The pair of wins brings the

Notre Dame 3, Bowling Green 2 
Notre Dame earned a tough win Friday against a deter­mined Falcons squad. A pair of power-play goals in the first period from freshmen Dan Kissel and Ryan Thang gave the Irish enough of an early edge to hand the Falcons their ninth straight game without a win.

Bulls use slovv tempo, strong rebounding to down Irish 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 
,Notre Dame's road woes returned Saturday. 
The No.19/21 Irish could not capitalize on momentum from their first true road win of the season -a victory over Syracuse at the Carrier Dome Tuesday -and fell to South Florida 69-63 at the Sun Dome in Tampa, Fla. 

Notre Dame (18-5, 6-4 Big East) dropped to 3-5 away from the Joyce Center this sea­son and fell to sixth in confer­ence. 
The win was the first over a ranked team this year for the Bulls (12-11, 3-6 Big East), 
and South Florida students stormed the court after the game. 
"We've had a couple people storm the floor on us this year," Irish coach Mike Brey said in a post-game interview, referring to the crowd's reac­tion when struggling St. John's topped the Irish in Madison Square Garden Jan. 23.

Notre Dame junior foilist Rachel Cota wanted the women in her weapon to go undefeated against Purdue, Michigan Stahl and Indiana in the Midwest Duals Saturday. 
The foilists delivered. 
En route to sweeps on both the men's·and women's sides, the Irish women foilists went 27-0 against the lesser com­petition. Cota, junior Melanie Bautista and senior Colleen Walsh each went 9-0 for Notre Dame.
