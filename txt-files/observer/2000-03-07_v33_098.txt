Members consider revamping graffiti dance 

Virmontes to speak at SMC graduation 
By NICOLE HADDAD News Writer 
Helena Maria Virmontes, critically acclaimed author and professor of English at Cornell University, will deliver this year's Commencement address at Saint Mary's on May 20. 
Virmontes is originally from Los Angeles and has written extensively on the experiences of Mexican­American migrant workers in this country. Her short stories and novels focus on the lives of these Chicano families through the eyes of mothers, wives and daughters. 
She joined the ranks of renowned authors Tom Wolfe and Graham Greene when she won the prestigious John Dos Passos Prize for Literature in 1995. She was the first Latina to receive this award. 
In addition to Viramontes, three other pioneering women will speak and receive honorary degrees at the ceremony. Bernice Johnson Reagon is an African American musician and scholar who performs with Sweet lloney in the Hock, an internationally

The Campus Life Council tackled freshman or.icntation concerns and passed three res­olutions during Monday's meet­ing. 
"We have to not put ourselves in the position of the upper­classmen, but the position of the freshmen," said student body secretary Luciana Reali referring to the freshman ori­entation events. 
The CLC gender relations committee members met with representatives from the Office of Student Activities to discuss freshman orientation activities with an emphasis on the graffiti dance. Student Activities is con­sidering changing this culmi­nating orientation event for first-year students because of issues surrounding the pres­ence of upperclassmen, alcohol and the discomfort of introvert­ed students. 
"When [freshmen] first come [to Notre Dame], they learn how to party in the wrong man­ner," said Ross Kerr, Student Union Board manager. "We learned that [Student Activities was] trying to put an end to the graffiti dance. 

"The graffiti dance at least forces you to talk to the other gender, but there are some people who are afraid or that. I can see both sides," said Kerr. 
"I don't like the idea that my virility is going to be measured by the number of signatures I got on a T-shirt," said Faculty Senate representative Edward Manier, expressing his opinion on how some students might feel about the dance. "You want to have as little stigmatization as possible." 
CLC members discussed ways to change the structure of the dance or incorporate different activities into it so those stu­dents do not feel pressured to obtain signatures. 
Kerr said that Student Activities might consider having a video dance party as an alter­native to steer away from the signature element of the dance. Suggestions from CLC members included keeping the dance but not allowing students to specify preferences by markers. Another suggestion was to change the theme.

lreating security guard and waitresses as hard­working human beings, or even forgiving imma­ture pedanls who throw water bottles onto the 
arena floor. 
Nonetheless. some of the lraditional practices should be put into context and not simply taken for granted. Fasting is currently defined as a reg­ular meal and two smaller meals with no snack­ing. For a college student on the Flex-14 plan, this is ridiculous -you don't get that much food on a normal day. So try simpler eating at the nor­mal meals. Avoid ordering Papa John's or doing Fajita-'Rita nights. Whatever it is, the idea is not so much to starve yourself as offering up to God a cleansing of body and soul. The idea is also to make an effort to know communion with the poor of our Christian family by being mindful of the luxury that our dining halls offer us daily. 
The idea that we should abstain from meat, as we should all know, originated when meat was a regular luxury and the Roman families needed a boost in their fishing businesses. But red meat is hardly the common luxury. and no one really gets anything out of giving it up anymore. Instead, why not abstain from TV? After all, that's the sta­ple luxury of our society today. Or throw in N64, DVD or the Internet, depending on which you depend on most. Give the time to the Knights of Columbus. Circle K or some other charitable organization. Be mindful oflife without these technologies that we sometimes assume are our rights to have access to but which are in reality useless luxuries that more often distract us from our lives than add to it. And while you're at it, be charitable to guys who use phrases like "be mind­
ful." 
Lent is an opportunity for reconciliation and penance (and Mardi Gras is an opportunity to do things worth seeking penance for). but try to approach it in a new light this year. Actively seek to reconcile differences with family or friends. Try to reestabush a lost correspondence; have a reunion with separated friends; accept gracefully the annoying attention of that one friend who you always thought of as platonic but seems to have something else in mind. (Yes. I am serious about that last one.) Lent need not be a time of sack­cloth and ashes, but ofjoyful reunion brought about by sincere repentance, whether it is between you and God or you and a friend. 
In the mean time, have an exciting Mardi Gras!

Grand jury indicts New Mexico student 
LAS CRUCES, N.M. 
A New Mexico State University graduate student and Border Patrol agent was indicted on four counts of extortion and fraud by a Grand .Jury Thursday. Leonel Baez, 22, was arrested in January for extortion and fraud for using his position as a Border Patrol agent to recover stolen property. "The Grand Jury found there was enough evidence to indict him on four charges of extortion and fraud," Jeff Lahann, assistant district attorney. said. Baez is accused of using his job status, threats and intimidation to coerce three women and their families into giving him money and jewelry he believed they stole from his girlfriend. Lahann said this case is very complicated and is related much to the state of mind Baez was in when he allegedly com­mitted the crimes. Baez will be arraigned a week from :vtonday and from there the case will go to district court where he will be tried. Baez has posted part of his bond with the court and is back at work with Border Patrol. Lahann said the Border Patrol most likely has to follow certain procedures and that is why he is able to continue working.

Clinton nominates Columbia prof 
NEWYOHK 

Columbia Law Professor Gerard Lynch has been nom­inated by President Clinton to serve on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Lynch. who teaches criminal law at Columbia, would try both civil and criminal entry-level cases in this position. Senate confirmation hearings on the appointment have not yet been scheduled. "This is a tremendously impor­tant job and a tremendously important responsibility," Lynch said. "It's an honor to be nominated." Lynch hopes to stay on at Columbia even after assuming the judgeship but did not speculate as to how large his involvement with the school would be. Nominating a professor to a district court position is somewhat unusual, Lynch said, due to the perception that acade­mics would be better suited to the abstract legal wran­glings of appellate courts. Lynch, however, likes the idea of trying cases. Lynch was a clerk to Supreme Court .Justice William J. Brennan after graduating from Columbia Law School and was a 1mimber of the federal commission on the Iran-Contra affair, heading up the prosecution of General Oliver North.

As the time approaches for spring break, many col­l(ige students are getting rearly for that much antici­patPd trip abroad. Most will have a safe and enjoy­able advi>nturt~. but for some. the trip will become a nightmare. J\ number of ruined vacations are cu.used by one or more of the following: drugs, alco­hol or disorderly behavior. 
Each year. more than 2,500 American citizens arc arrested abroad ­about half on narcolics charges, including posses­sion of very small amounts of illegal substances. A drug that may be legal in one country may not be legal in a neighboring nation. Some young people are viclimized because they mav be unaware of thi> laws. customs or standards of the country tlrny are vis­iting. 
Besides drugs, alcohol can also get U.S. citizens in troubln abroad. Students have been arrested for being intoxicated in public areas, for underage drink­ing and for drunk driving.

Disorderly or reckless behavior is also to be avoided. In many countries, conduct that would not result in an arrest here in tlrn U.S. constitutes a viola­tion of local law. It is cru­cial that young Americans be awnrP of this risk as lhey are enjoying tlrnir time abroad. 
Being arrested is not the only thing that can happen on a foreign vacation. Young Americans have bi>en killed in automobile accidents, drownings and falls because of heavy cl.rinking and drug use. Sadly, others have been raped or rubbed because thev have found themsPlves in ~nfamiliar locales and incapable of exercising proper judgment.

Dennis: nuns' murder shows greed 
By KAREN SCHAFF 
News Writer 
The story of four nuns mur­dered in El Salvador illustrates the greed for power, said Marie Dennis, din~ctor of the Maryknoll Office for Global con­cerns, in a lecture Mondav. 
The four women who· were murdered were ordinary people whose faith changed their lives, according to Dennis. 
"These women could have been anyone," said DPnnis. "[It isl a testimony of transformed lives." 
On December 20, 1980, nine mon tbs after the death of the Archbishop Oscar Romero. four American women were abduct­ed, raped and killed by Salvadorian soldiers. These sol­diers were trained in the United States and used guns made in the U.S., yet, nothing happened when these women -Ida, Mora. Dorothy and Jean ­were killed. 
Ida started her work in Chile, where she expPrienced poverty and oppression for the first time, Dennis explained. Ida also learned that government offi­cials were making threats against the Church in an attempt to discredit its mem­bers. 
Romero invited Ida to go tn El Salvador to continue her work with the poor. Shortly before her planned arrival, Romero died. 
Ida began to wonder about the message of the gospel and the power of the people. 
Ida's friend Clara, who was later killed while transporting prisoners, offered inspiration using the words of Jesus: "I am the way." It was then that these two women became completely engrossed in the poverty of the Salvadorians, said Dennis. 
Mora also faced the chal­lenges of poverty and despair, 
Dennis explained. Every day she saw the death of children and the misery of the poor. 
"The poor would give [their] life for some change," said Dennis. 
Dorothy started her work in 1974 by visiting homes and preparing people for the sacra­ment. Dennis quoted Dorothy: "They must continue preaching the Lord even if it means laying down your life." 
Jean was a coordinator of many of the events that led to strengthening poor communi­ties. She distributed food and educated those who could not go elsewhere. 
She was nicknamed St. Jean the Playful, even though she witnessed many deaths and "felt personally challenged to 

Survey: Freshmen have high aspirations 
Special to The Observer 
An annual survey of college freshmen indicates that while the academic aspirations of first­year students at Notre Dame are exceptionally high, they expect to use their knowledge as much for the common good as personal gain. 
Some 92 percent of Notre Dame's freshmen report they plan to earn an advanced acade­mic degree -including 43 per­cent who will pursue a master's degree, 17 percent a doctorate. 21 percent a medical. dentistry, or veterinary degree and 10 per­cent a law degree. By way of comparison, about 68 percent of students nationwide have similar plans. 
Hut as much as they are deter­mined to succeed, Notre Dame students place relatively less emphasis on financial gain than their peers. Some 62 percent say it is essential or very important to be well-off financially. 11 per-help these people cope," said Dennis. 

These women stayed in El Salvador at the price of their lives, Dennis said. They repre­sented the hopes and fears of this community. 
"It was a test of faith," she said. "It called us beyond what we are, to what we could be." 
Dennis said that this was the extraordinary story of four women who help us understand God. 
"Part of who we are is in their story," Dennis said.

cent less than the national aver­age. 
At the same time, Notre Dame students reported far more inter­est than their peers in participat­ing in community action, influ­encing social values, becoming a community leader developing a meaningful philosophy of life and assisting those who are in diffi­culty. 
Not surprisingly, such altruism also is found in Notre Dame stu­dents before and during their college years. Almost 97 percent of the University's freshmen report they volunteered in the past year, r,ompared with 75 percent of students nationally, and 58 percent plan to continue with community service. 
Notre Dame freshmen are like­ly underestimating their future volunteer efforts; the University's Center for Social Concerns reports that almost 80 percent of Notre Dame students actually engage in volunteer projects dur­ing their four years on campus.

He said that enrouraging stu­dents tu get numbers from stu­dents of the opposite sex missc>s the point that the dance is sup­posed to acquaint people with one another and help them adjust during the first week. 
"It turns the mentality into not meetin:; people, but getting a date," Scheidler said. 
He rncall!'d that beforn the gralliti dance became an evenl, students used to havfl sockhops in the Joyce Center that put less emphasis un meeting the opposite sex. 
"I met a lot of my lifelong friends at thal dance," Srheidler said. 
Once the freshman orienta­tion danre changed to an out­door luau, the dance began to take on a new form. he said. The dance also became more accessible to people other than freshman students. 
Now the event has turned into a "meat markeL." Scheidler said. 
"What happens a lot of times is that freshmen. sophomores and juniors come to the dance a little intoxicated and use it as an opportunity to meet fresh­man girls," said Reali, who serves on Lewis Hall's fresh­man orientation committee. 
Reali said that some of the shyer girls and international students in her dorm did not have a good experience at the dance. Fierro said that many ethnic students also feel "out of the loop" because of cultural adjustments during the first week. 
"There is a meat market mentality, but no one gets rejected," said Keough Hall senator and student body presi­dent-elect Brian O'Donoghue. "You need something to force the students to get involved. There's going to be culture shock regardless."

The CLC discussed switching thP time of the graffiti dance from Saturday night, and also possibly haviug two smaller North and South Quad dances instead. 
"Freshmen orientation is one of the only weekends when you can approach anyone and that's why we should have a campus-wide event," said stu­dent body vice president-elect Brooke Norton. 
"Keep the graffiti dance, but add an alternative," said cur­rent student body president Micah Murphy. 
Kerr is going to discuss the freshman orientation activities with the gender relations com­mittee and draft a resolution. 
In other CLC news: 
. The diversity committee drafted a resolution to make the diversity education pro­gram mandatory for transfer students. 
"It's so that studf'nts don't fall through Lhe cracks," Fierro said.

Members passed another resolution to stop parking on outdoor basketball courts. Currently some parking lots are used until 5 p.m., but this rule is not always enforced. Because of the upcoming Bookstore Basketball tournament, stu­dents will be using the outdoor courts more frequently and CLC members wanted to see that courts are available lo the student bodv. 

"By getti~g this done early, we're avoiding a conflict that I can definitely see right away," said Brian Rigney, co-chair of the Hall President's Council.

An additional resolution to have a student member on the University Committee for the First Year of Studies was also passed by the CLC.

MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich. 
Greeted by teddy bears and extra security, Buell Elementary School children returned to class Mondav for the first time since a first-grader was shot to death in her classroom. 
Children and parents alike expressed foars at first about return­ing to the school where 6-year-old Kayla Rolland was killed Feb. 29, allegedly by another first-grader. 
"He was afraid it was going to be him next," Lisa Davidson said of her second-grade son, Tim. 
Room 6. where the shooting occurred, had been cleaned and repainted. Trauma counselors with teddy bears were in each room to help the children, and by the lunch break, some children were skipping on the sidewalk out front. 
Plainclothes and uniformed police officers were inside and outside the school. School Superintendent Ira Rutherford said officials wanted to increase security without having too !)trong a police presence and scaring the children. 
About 335, or 79 percent, of the 424 children enrolled at Buell were in school Monday, according to Rutherford's office. Average atten­dance figures for other clays were not immediately available. 
The 6-year-old boy accused of killing Kayla wasn't at Buell, or any other school, on Monday, and offi­cials are determining his next step, Rutherford said. 
Todd Morrish said he had consid­ered not sending his son Ryan to kindergarten Monday. But when the morning session was over, Ryan came out carrying a brown bear and a drawing he had colored of a green bear. 
"He said it was fine. They played outside," Morrish said. 
The U.S. and Michigan flags remained at half-staff, and a nearby evergreen tree with stuffed animals at its base was decorated with pink ribbons in memory of Kayla. 
"l saw laughter. l saw lots of hugs. It was a smooth opening," said Susan Stuber, a spokeswoman for a neigh­boring school district.

Candidates prepare for 'Super Tuesday' showdown 
. Republicans still battling, but only an upset will keep Gore from Democratic bid 
As.sociated Press 
WASHINGTON 
George W. Bush's fortunes in New England and Ohio could he early signs to foretr,ll wlrnther Super Tuesday voting from Maine to California will deliver him the Republican presidential nomination or force him into another round against the challenge of John McCain. 
For Demorrats, there is less suspense. Only a miracle of upsets, beginning from the first votes counted, can kRcp Al Gore from effectively seal­ing that nomination. And Bill Brrrdlry doesn't really oxpect that, for all his talk of a Harry Truman-style reversal for hi~ waning campaign. 
There are 11 presidential primaries, caucuses else­where, decisions in 16 states across the time zones, Northeast to Midwest to the West Coast. California is cru­cial on March 7. as it may be again on Nov. 7. when the next president is chosen. 
The 162 Republican dele­gates that will be committed to the GOP winner there repre­sent 16 percent of the votes needed to win the nomination. Polls rate Gov. Bush well ahead of Sen. McCain among the Republican voters who will award those delegates. 
There is a separate, all-can­didates preference vote, and that is closer. Winning it will be a talking point and an argument for electability there in the fall, but with no reward in nominating delegates. the contest that counts now. The positioning primaries are over; Super Tuesday is about hard numbers. not momentum or doing well or any of the other catchwords of the earlier cam­paign season. 
"So much of this is an expec­tations game," McCain said. But that game is over.

WASHINGTON 

Hoping for a Super Tuesday worthy of' tho name, Gcorgr, W. Bush anrl Al Gore campaignrd on opposite coasts Monday in parallel pursuit of the victt>rics mieded to settle tlrnir parties' nominating struggles. 
"Rest is for another dav." said Gore's rival, Bill Bradley. And on the (We of a virtual nation­wide presidential primary with contests in all regions of the country. all sides seemed to agree on that. 
Republican John McCain said he sensed a backlash develop­ing against campaign commer­cials airnd by Rush and "his sleazy Texas buddies" in New York and elst!Where. 
Tim front-runners, Bush and Gorn, both courted Jewish vot­ers as they tailored their mes­sage as much to the general election as Tuesday's pri­maries. 
"Tolerance can never be assumed, and it always must be taught," Bush said in an appearance at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles where he also stressed his support for "a safe and secure Israel." 
Gore, in New York. told a Jewish organization he would be a "good and helpful and loyal friend" to Israel if elected to the White House. 
Public opinion polls had Gore ahead of Bradley virtually everywhern. Bush's position wasn't as commanding. although he led McCain in the polls in several key states. including Ohio. Maryland. Georgia. Missouri and in the winner-take-all competition for 162 California delegates. McCain's strength was in New England, and he and Bush bat­tled fiercely in New York. 
Bush and McCain girded for elections in 13 states in all, 11 primarir,s and two caucuses. with 613 dr,legates up for grabs. Democrats had contests in 15 states and the American Samoa, 11 primaries and 5 caucuses with 1,315 delegates in play. 
Aides said the Bush campaign was making two million get­out-thc-vote calls in nine states in the Super Tuesday lineup.

Cardinal O'Connor receives Congressional Gold Medal 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

Ailing Cardinal .John O'Connor smiled and joked Monday as he was presented with a proclamation awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian honor. 
"It was just nice. It was just one of those nice, almost magical moments 1.hat we a.re lucky enough to take part in ... it was so good to see him vigorous," said Sen. Charles Schumer, 
0-NY. 
Schumer and Hep. Vito Fossella, H-N.Y., presented 
O'Connor the framed prorlamation to O'Connor at his Archdiocese residence. The medal will be presented to the 
cardinal in a few months onrn it has boen mint­ed. "It meant a grr.at deal to him. Hr. was very, 
very happy, very pleased about the whole thing," the cardinal's spokesman, Joe Zwilling, said after Monday's presentation of the docu­ment. 
President Clinton signed the proclamation on Sunday and in a statement said, "For more than 50 years, Cardinal O'Connor has served the Catholic Church and our nation with constancy and commitment." 
Clinton recalled O'Connor's early days per­forming parish work in his native Philadelphia, his service as a military chaplain in Korea and Vietnam and his 16 years leading the New York Archdiocese. 
The medal is the highest civilian honor awarded by Congress, and both houses rushed to approve it for O'Connor, mindful of his pre­carious health. 
O'Connor is recuperating from brain tumor surgery last year. Zwilling said the 80-year-old cardinal was "feeling better the last few days but still weak and not able to resume a regular sclrndule." 
Hacker alters Gallup Internet site 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
An electronic vandal altered the Internet site for the Gallup Organization, one of the nation's oldest and most respected polling companies, just before Tuesday's presiden­tial primary elections. 
Gallup said none of its poll data was compromised because its vandalized Web site, at www.gallup.com, won't be connected to internal com­puters that store polling results until Sept. 1. That's when Gallup plans to make available changed to read "demonstra­through its Web site 65 years tion of Internet insecurity by of data. AntiOnline." 
"We have until September 1 Gallup indicated it now to guarantee that we have believes AntiOnline wasn't 
addressed all issues of security," said Phil Ruhlmon, Gallup's chief infor­mation offi­cer. 
Gallup results are relied upon heavily by campaigns and political journalists. The group's Web site was 

''To be able to put out a fake story about Microsoft merging with Apple, for example; just rumors about those kinds ofstories can send stocks skyrocketing." 
John Vranesevich head of AntiOnline 
involved, but it acknowl­edged that it originally called to complain to J o h n Vranesevich, who runs AntiOnline in Beaver, Pa. 
"We're pretty much used to that," said Vranesevich, who was 


vandalized in an obvious way early Sunday for about six hours before it was noticed and repaired. The more seri­ous risk was that subtle changes could have been intro­duced -the report of a surge by a political underdog, for example -and reported by mainstream media outlets as genuine. 
"That is a risk," Ruhlmon acknowledged. "It may have existed for a longer period of time if they had changed some­thing minor." 
Instead, the unknown vandal altered part of Gallup's Web site with a claim that a promi­nent Internet site devoted to computer security, AntiOnline, was itself responsible. Along with some text, a headline was demonized by hackers last summer after he offered to help authorities trace and prosecute hackers. "When someone's hacked, there's obviously a lot of frustration there. When some of these malicious hackers put our name down as a joke or to degrade us, we'll get a call sometimes." 

Vranesevich agreed that the greater threat in the attack against Gallup was the poten­tial risk to the organization's credibility if false data pub­lished on its Web site had been reported publicly. 
"To this point, we really haven't seen hackers do that," he said. "[But] to be able to put false information out, it could have serious conse­quences, all sorts of problems. To be able to put out a fake story about Microsoft merging

role in bringing democracy to Serbia. after draw­i n g applause and a bar­rage of

with  her  
message to  a  university audi­

Albright, visiting the land of her birth, delivered a speech Monday at Tomas Masaryk University in Brno in which she referred to a pledge by Czech President Vaclav Havel on Sunday to cancel a $30 mil­lion sale of cooling duct parts by a Czech company to Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant. 
Albright said halting the spread of nuclear weapons technology "is not without cost." 
"To keep tho best technology from falling into the wrong hands. American firms are required to forgo many poten­tially profitable contracts," Albright said, speaking in English. "But a similar responsibility rests upon the shoulders of all who pledged to defend the best interests of the Euro-Atlantic community." 
After her speech, which drew enthusiastic applause, Albright left the auditorium for a nearby hall, where a crowd of well-wishers had gathered to r.atch a glimpse of her. Suddenly, two men shout­
ed "d1rnth to American imperi­alism" and began hurling eggs. Pol ire Capt.. Zd e1rnk Lubas said two 22-year-old men described as anarchists were dctained for questioning. 
Albright was spatternd with bits of egg, but most of them were intercepted by hew body­guards, said a U.S. official who spokP-on condition of anonymity. Albright was rushed away quickly. 
"Whoever is unable to think about the serious problems of today's civilization, including globalization, has nothing bet­ter to do than to take an egg and throw it. at somehody," Havel said later.

"We considPr thl' campaign around Bushehr conducted by the Czech government and the local media a gift to the American minister Madeleine Albright linked to her visit," Sharif Khodai, the acting Iranian ambassador to Prague, told the newspaper Pravo. 
/\!bright also met Monday afternoon in Prague, th c Czech capital, with private Czech and other Eastern European organizations to dis­cuss the challenges or bringing democracy to Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant repub­lic. 
"The prevailing opinion was that Serbia·s democratic oppo­sition within the country and the international community should focus on elections in Serbia," said Tomas Pojar, head of the Prague-based Man in Need foundation. 
Sinre arriving Sunday for a four-day visit, Albright has said repeatedly that former communist countries such as the Czech Republic can offer valuable lessons to Serbian opposition figures in fighting for democracy against the authoritarian government of President Slobodan Milosevic.

Court backs Indiana on Good Friday 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The Supreme Court wants no say, not yet anyway, in how states treat Good Friday. 
Thr nation's highest court Monday rejected a challenge to Indiana's designation of Good Friday as a statr holiday. The denial of review. which was not accompanied by any court comnwnt. allows the state to continue giving ils employers that day off. a practice begun in 1941. 
The designation had bP-en attacked as a violation of the r,onstitutionally required sepa­ration of government and reli­gion. 
The justices similarly turned away a challengc in January to a Maryland law that requires the annual closing of' all public schools on Good Friday. 
Always two days before Easter. Good Fridav is the Christian holiday th.at com­memorates the crucifixion of Jesus. But some courts have ruled that designating the day as an annual holiday has a lrgitimatc. non-religious pur­pose. 
Indiana's law was chal11mged by taxpayer Russell Brid1mbaugh of Bloomington. I !is lawvers told thP court that at lr.asi 14 other states have laws making all or part of Good Friday a legal holiday. 
Thev art' California, Dr.laware. Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky. Louisiana, 
Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina. North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin. 
Some of those laws have been struck down after being challenged in court. 
After Bridenbaugh sued in 1997. a federal magistrate threw out the case without a trial. A three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal last July, by a 2-1 vote. 
A separate panel of that same appeals court previously had struck down the Illinois law that provided for school closings on each Good Friday. 
Indiana's main purposr, in designating the state holiday is to provide a long spring week­end. the appeals court panel found. 
"Indiana does not celebrate the religious aspects of Good Friday; for Indiana, the holiday has absolutely no n~ligious sig­nificance. To Indiana, Good Friday is nothing but a Friday falling in the middle of the long vacationless spring -a day which employees should take off to rejuvenate themst'lves," the panel said. 
The dissenting judge said the state should not be allowed to choose Good Friday as the spring holiday every year. But the two-judge majority noted that the designation gives state employers a three-day week­end "during a time which typi­cally involves travel. shopping, cooking and family gather­ings." 

Jury convicts three N.Y. policemen 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
Amid heightened tension between the police and the black community, three white officers were convicted Monday of a cover-up in the attack on a Haitian immigrant brutalized with a broken broomstick in a stationhouse bathroom. 
The guilty verdicts in one of New York City's most notorious cases of police brutality came 10 days after four white offi­cers were cleared in the shoot­ing of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo. an unarmed black man who died a barrage of 41 bullets. 
In Monday's verdict. former patrolman Charles Schwarz, 34, and officers Thomas Wiese, 36, and Thomas Bruder,\,_33, were found guilty of lying to investigators to conceal Schwarz's role in the 1997 attack on Abner Louima, who suffered severe internal injuries. 
"Not only are we now getting convictions of police on mis­conduct, but actually for the conspiracy. This is a real blow to the blue wall of silence," said the Rev. Al Sharpton. 
Louima cousin and familv spokesman Samuel Nicolas said: "This is not a happy occa­sion for us. We are not opening champagne bottles." But he added. "Now we can start the healing process." 
The officers' convictions carry up to five years in prison. No sentencing date was set. 
Schwarz also could get life in prison when he is sentenced for his 1999 conviction on charges of holding down a handcuffed Louima as fellow Officer Justin Volpe sodomized him with a broken broom han­dle. 
In the latest trial, prosecu­tors sought to show that the three officers hid behind a "blue wall of silence" within the department. 
"The verdict today should send a message within the police department that there is no greater

Attorneys for all three men said they will appeal, and Schwarz's lawyer said he asked that Schwarz be placed on suicide watch in jail. 
Louima was not in the court­room for the verdict.

Both Volpe and Schwarz had insisted Schwarz was never even in the Brooklyn police sta­tion bathroom during the assault. 
Volpe, who pleaded guilty to the attack and is serving a 30­yea r sentence, testified at Schwarz's trial for the first time about the attack. saying he mistakenly thought Louima had punched him during a dis­turbanc e outside a Haitian nightclub.

Deep moments in required classes 
I have struck up an e-mail friendship with a college freshman, to whom l often allocate certain pearls of wisdom that only a Real World-embattled grad­uate is capable of dispensing, such as 
Mary Beth Ellis 
how to magically transform a five­page paper into a Changes in seven-page one by latitudes,changing the font. 
Changes in 
She is grateful for 

Atitudes 
my assistance and shows it by whining a great deal about her required cours­es. I take this as an offense and a chal­lenge. Nobody out-whines me where cores are concerned: 
Class: Biology. Took Place: Every frickin' day of the week. Usefulness Rating: Would sooner drink formalde­hyde than have to smell it again. 
This course consisted largely of a man who wore the same four sweaters on a regularly rotating basis and talked at length about how cells divide. At one point he showed a film which graphical­ly depicted mating rituals of the American honeybee.The fact that this was immensely disgusting was all any­one remembered on the midterm. A fetal pig was also dissected. No one enjoyed this except for the man in the sweater. 
Class: Spanish. Took Place: Entirely too often. Usefulness Rating: Negative one million trillion gazillion stars. 
Spanish spoken by a learned or native tongue is lovely. Spanish spoken by hungover eighteen-year-olds at nine in the morning is not. An intense hatred of this course was easily engendered by its evil and deceptive nature. 
The first week or so was dedicated to introducing oneself and constructing such marginally useful sentences as "The desk is on the Ooor!" Then sud­denly. out of some deep, specially pre­pared hole of hell. came subject pro­nouns, the present tense of all verbs ending in -ar, singular forms of adjec­tives, the use and conjugation of the verb ir and one 125 vocabulary words, none of which even obliquely referred to the procurement of liquor. The explanations for correct usage and directions for homework exercises were written entirely in Spanish. And that concluded Chapter One. 
Raining especial torment upon Spanish 101 was Language Lab. This was an undodgable requirement for all foreign language courses, in which stu­dents signed in for their prescribfld one hour a week with a proctor, then hunched in carrels with a language tape. a Trudy the Time-Life Operator headset and a "listening skills" work­book. In theory, the student listened carefully to questions posed by the tape, then entered painstakingly constructed, accent-perfect responses in the spaces provided. 
This theory applied for perhaps a grand total of four seconds of the required 27 hours of my Language Lab time. Within a week J discovered the Listening Skills answers conveniently placed in the back of the book. the amazing physical resemblance between the textbook tape and, say, a personal mix tape containing Garth Brooks and Toad the Wet Sprocket and the fact that student proctor did not in fact give a damn so as long as everyone was checked in, wearing headphones and holding some sort of writing instru­ment. I am pleased that Spanish 101 managed to inject joy and meaning into the life of at least one human being. 
Class: The History of Western Civilization. Took place: Way the hell in the past. Usefulness Rating: Too many guillotines to tell. 

The textbook for this course con­tained an entire section entitled "The Use of the Hand Plow," and that's all you need to know about that. Otherwise, the most pivotal event of Western Civilization took place at noon on Wed., October 4, 1995, which was the starting time for a lecture on Charlemagne -and the designated hour at which the verdict in the O..J. Simpson trial was to be announced. A mammoth battle raged between the professor, who wished to lecture, and the students, who, fully cognizant of the verdict's impact upon the nation's judi­cial system and American society in general, wished to get out of hearing the lecture. A truce was reached when two "reporter" students were permitted to listen to the verdict on a radio in the professor's nearby office while actual learning took place for the rest of the class. (It should be noted that every­body hated this arrangement except for the two reporter students.) 
At 12:15 p.m., just as Charlemagne was conquering Saxony, a great "OOOOOOHHifHHHHH!" was heard from the professor's office, immr,diately followed by the stomping appearance of the reporting students, who screeched. "not guilty!" before flopping angrily into their respective seats. The professor was mildly stunned and the reporting students were near tears, but the lec­ture continued anyway. 
I will say one thing for the cores: They kept me busy between weekends.

'War on drugs' is ineffective 

The l 1nited States has a highrr percentage of our population imprisoned than any other coun­trv in the world. The number of' pr:isoners is expected to double over the next 20 years. We can ban~ly build nnough prisons tn keep up the pace. AH of this at a time when Drugs." has so demonized illegal drug use that it is impossible to speak about solutions other than incarceration.

Holding out hope in students and alumni 
Our Notre Dame Family, we address you as members of our family. Our brothers, sisters, friends; we came to this school in the pursuit of more than an education -we came in pursuit of a community in which we could all feel accepted. Hand picked by the admissions office, each one of us worked hard to get here and work harder each day to stay an integral part of this community. But we are not perfect. We make mistakes, piss off friends, get eJected from foot­ball games for doing pnshups in the stands and even get thrown out of Reckers for spilling things. We are human, what can you expect'? 
We expected a Catholic com­munity, a caring community, to look at the wrong of a fellow student and while not condoning it, forgive it. We arc just as frus­trated as anyone else is at the outcome of the Syracuse game. We are even more upset, howev­er. with the reactions of our fel­low students and alumni -the name-calling. finger pointing and threatening gestures ­lowards one of their own. We wonder if you would react the same if it was your roommate, your friend -you? We ponder what words you could find to say to your parents if your fellow students wouldn't stop threaten­ing you, just for the sake of a game'? 
Our expectations have not been completely disregarded, however, for we find some solace in the "class act" of the basketball team. We have dis­covered in them a source of inspiration, and we hope that you, our family, can do the same. We have not given up on you, in hopes that you will give back to the Notrf' Dame commu­nity a little of the respect it has lost in the past few days, we say to the him: Although we believe what you did lacked a bit of common sense, we still support you wholeheartedly.

UHS is endangering students 
I would like to respond to Ann Thompson's letter to the editor, published in The Observer last Friday. The author of the anonymous let­ter. printed last week, should be outraged at Ms. Thompson's callous critique of their reac­tion to the lost blood sample. No doubt, the nurse and laboratory technician did not intrmd to misplace the sample, but to dismiss the incident as an example of how "life isn't always perfect" is an insult not only to the person whose blood sample was lost, but to anyone who has ever experienced a problem with the University Health Services. I have spoken with countless individuals who have been the victims of misdiagnoses and poor medical treatment at the campus infirmary, and I would like to take this opportunity to share my personal experience and that of a friend who is very dear to me. 
Shortly after fall break, I awoke one morn­ing feeling intense chest pains and short breath. I decided to walk over to University Health Services for treatment. After meeting with one of the doctors, who told me I was probably suffering from inflamed lung tissue but did not say why, I was sent to have an X-ray taken of my chest cavity. 
I walked into the room to find the X-ray operator seated at her desk reading a romance novel with a man who 


looked a great deal like Fabio on the cover. When I told her I needed an X-ray to be taken, she lifted one linger, without looking at me. and continued read­ing her book. I stood in the doorway for about a minute in utter agony because every time I either inhaled or exhaled I felt a terri­ble pain throughout mv chest. 
Finally, she put the book down and attended to me. Now, I could be overreact­ing, but when some­one requires medical attention, I feel that attention should be as immediate as pos­sible. Had there been another patient ahead of me requiring an X-ray, I would have waited without complaint. However, I think it is shameful for an employee of a hos­pital to put a patient on hold because she wants to finish reading about all her unfulfilled sexual fantasies. If that is the standard of excellence exhibited by UHS that Ms. Thompson hailed in her article, I think the bar needs to be raised considerably. 
Unfortunately, my tale does not end on the X-ray table. About a month late; I began to experience the same symptoms that had initially diminished after receiving medication from the infir­mary. I told the same doctor that this was a repeat occurrencf' and that I thought it was something a little more serious than inflamed lung tissue. She said it was nothing and had the nurse give me shot, plus more prescriptions. Roughly 45 minutes after I received the shot. I had a violent attack of pain rn;1t only in my chest but in my neck and stomach as well. A friend dialed 911 and I was rushed to St. Joe's and stabilized. 
The doctor at St. Joe's told me that my lung tissue was inflamed but since it was apparent ly a chronic ailment I should see a doctor for serious medical treatment over Christmas Break, which I did. I am now receiving the proper medication and have not suffered from chest pains since last fall. 
This is not a single, isolated incident. There are so many students at Notre Dame with complaints about UHS that it would probably take an entire edition of The Observer to print each one. A close friend of mine, who will remain anonvmous, suffers from an incurable and potentiaily fatal heart disease. 
She first noticed something was wrong when she experienced chest pains -diffornnt and much worse than the pains I suffered from ­last February. Thfl doctor at UIIS said that she was simply suffering from stress and that a change in lifestyle was all she needed. When she asked for testing, they refused to adminis­ter any, saying it would be unnecessary. 
She spent the remainder of the year in con­stant pain and upon her return home in May she visited a cardiologist at one of the top hos­pitals in the country. They were willing to per­form the tests and discovered her condition. She was placed on medication that would treat but not cure the disease and could not be mixed with certain drugs used to treat other ailments. She was also told that she would need to go into a hospital for weekly check­ups while she was at school. 
In December, my friend contracted pneumonia and went to the infirmary on campus for treatment. Even though she specifically informed the doctors that she was on heart medication and that they could not prescribe 
certain drugs for the pneumonia, they went ahead and gave her a prescription that could not be 
mixed with her heart medicine anyway. This means one of 
two things: Either they did not do a thorough enough background check on the 
heart medicine or the pneu­monia medicine, or they ignored my friend's warn­
ing altogether. In any case, that is an unconscionable oversight. 
She took the medicine for 4 clays. It made the pneumonia go away but gave her severe heart problems, worse than she 
had ever experienced before. Her cardiologist at home immediately took her off the pneumo­nia medication because it was obvious that it was worsening the heart con­dition. 
As a result of all the problems she has had with UHS, my friend goes 
to St. Joe's for her check­ups, which is a terrible inconvenience for her. She 
no longer believes that anyone at UHS has a shred of medical expertise and 
will only go there in the most dire of emergencies. This is the state of health care on the campus of America's top Catholic univer­
sity. Ms. Thompson called the lost blood sample "truly a RARE occurrence." Perhaps blood sam­
ples are not often misplaced, but University Health Services has made too many mistakes to be con­sidered an adequate health care cen­ter. I do not feel that anyone who voices 
their disapproval of the medical attention they receive at UHS should be accused of hav­ing "an inappropriate response" to the situa­tion. 
Ms. Thompson encourages open communi­cation so that "constructive changes" can be made, but the rest of her article indicates that a student will be castigated every time they criticize UHS. Well, I have some open commu­nication for Ms. Thompson: The University Health Services is a pathetic representation of the medical profession and a disgrace to the University of Notre Dame. The administration needs to recognize this and do something about it.

Vertical Horizon and Stroke 9 held a concert that. hfllpe.d people put faces to the per­formers of those songs they always hear on the radio.

Much of that had to do wilh the two styles of music that the bands played. Stroke 9 has many songs that are faster and more upbeat so the fans can dance, 
happy to have the crowd vibe from Stroke 9's performance.

CONCERT REVIEW 

A shy Mr. 'Misery' delights Chicago crowd 
By CHRISTOPHER McGOVERN Scene Music Critic 
Elliott Smith's music has always been a study in contradictions. His songs are beautiful and emotional, yet the lvrics are stark and d11prnssing. Even his happier songs usually have a sad twist to them. This trend of contradiction remained apparent throughout his per­formance at Chicago's Empty Bottle on Saturday, February 26. A shy, reserved Smith took the stage around 11:00 and went straight into two new songs, "Son of Sam" and "Happiness." Though he appeared somewhat nervous -an early miscue on "Happiness" seemed to make him somewhat embarrassed -he settled into a comfortable groovA around the third or fourth tune. Despite his somewhat ill at ease man­ner, Smith. who earned national acclaim for his contributions to the "Good Will Hunting" soundtrack, managed to main­tain a commanding stage presence. For the most part, the audience stnod motionless, as if they didn't want to miss a single note or word from their mod­ern-day Dylan. The only damper on the evening, was the young lady in the front row who pantomimed everything from being a butterfly to taking heroin.

which has become almost customary at his shows. With most of the crowd suggesting "Thirteen." he went with "Night Time." a rather desperate song on a night in which Smith seemed to be anything but. His soothing voice and heartfelt lyrics have made him a college girl mix-tapA staple, and his performance showed why. Look for his new album on April 18, as well as the new Division Day EP released last week. 
The opening act, Chicago natives Okay Go!, pleased the crowd with their lyrical, poppy songs and colorful stage antics. This extremely witty band kicked off their set with the mid-80's hit "Don't Get Me Wrong," prompting the lead singN to proclaim them as a Pretenders cover band. 
They then proceeded to rip through a set of their own eclectic originals, rang­ing from punk-pop to Weezer-like power chord ballads, all while the keyboardist did his best to bring the Kraftwerk robots to life. 
To end their set. they did something unprecedented in the annals of rock­they covered the headlining act. They played a blistering version of Smith's own "Clementime," providing a nir.e contrast to the acoustic set he was about to play. Okay Go! is an rrnjoyable live act, and being that they play regularly in the Chicago area. would be worth the trip alone to see.

beat box to enable them to still makP music. f'rorn the laid-back grooves of Q­Tip and Mos Def to the in-your-face style of Master P and Spice 1, rap has shown a diversity and brilliance that places it alongside all other genres of music. With perfect harmony of lyrics and btiats that make people want to danr:e and learn every word. rap has the ability Lo take hold of people and draw them in. Despite what Mr. Jones 
belioves, it docs not take a 15-minute guitar solo to makP. music good. Music is what drives people, what put5 them in different moods. what makes them want

music, but grnat music to many peoplP. 
Jones next tries to point out that rap music is onlv about ridiculous and uno­riginal topic~,; like drugs and prostitu­tion. Groups like Public Enemy created beats and lyrirs that expressed the plight of a race that was still struggling despite efforts of the civil rights era. NWA and KRSl gave a voice to the thousands of Americans that face police brutality whilf' no one listens, and answers the people that think discrimi­nations in the criminal justice system are only isolated incidents. 
In the '90s. Tupac, Puff Daddy, No Limit Records. DMX.

In a year of subscribing to the Phish newsletter in high school, the most interesting thing I read about was whAther or not one of the membfffS should cut his hair. Can we honestly criticize rap for its "silly" topics while promot.i.ng Phish? Consider the numer­ous "serious" Phish topics. This group has a ten-minute song where they end­lessly repeat the name David Bowie. Another popular song is about a weasel named Fee that just wants to be free. ThPre's yet another song wherr the most intelligiblfl state­
that itself promotes promiscuity from a band that talks about or alludes to drug culture in half of their songs? And the drug use of groups like Phish and Dave Matthews is a matter of public record. I would say that all music has its imperfections. but no one should venture to say that rap is the least cultured form of music because it doesn't tone down its lyrics. 
There is the issue of rap music being overplayed as well as Jones' request to stop hearing it (he also talks about pop and 80's music but focuses mostly on rap). Jones makes a bold statement by saying that maybe we listen to rap so much because of diversity issues on campus. This is pretty much insulting and non-sensical because it ignores the fact that many people actually like rap music. He gives no reason why the racial composition of campus would prompt us to listen to more rap. Jones speaks on our behalf by saying that although the Oavc Matthews Band is overplayed, we would rather hear that at dances than rap. I. however, whole­heartedly disagree. I think Dave Matthews produces great music, but from the people I have talked to and by my own opinion, a real party would not last four songs into any "Dave" album without a large portion of peoplf) leav­
ing the floor. 
in defeating. 
Finally Jones states that Phish con­certs prove that people can dance to the music, but I would point out that flailing around in a pot-induced semi-slumber is no more dancing than what people supposedly do when they hear rap music. 
In conclusion, I am a fan of all the groups mentioned above and feel that you accept all musicians' flaws and bril­liance. One should not point out the shortcomings of a genre they do not like while ignoring the problems with their own taste. 
I close with one question. How can you enjoy dancing in a large group of people if everyone is worried about stepping on someone's Birkenstocks?

Mardi Gras is the day before Ash Wednesday, the first day ofLent. Today, however, is traditionally known as "Shrove Tuesday", because ir was the day on which "shrift" or confession was made in preparation for the great fast of the Lenten season of 40 days. Shrove Tuesday is called in French Mardi gras "Fat Tuesday," in allusion to the fat ox which is ceremoniously paraded through the streets on chis day. In Catholic countries Mardi gras is celebrated as the last day of che carnival, with feasting and merrymaking, of which, in England, the eating of pancakes alone survives as a social custom. The day had been called at one time "Pancake Tuesday." In the U.S., the festival season preceding Ash Wednesday and the Lenten season particu­larly associated with New Orleans is known, of course, as Mardi Gras. The season begins New Year's day and concludes with parades, pageantry and a ball on Shrove Tuesday. 
Frequently Asked Questions: 
Where do the traditions of Mardi Gras and Ash Wednesday originate? 
By Fr. Peter Rocca, C.S.C.,
Rector of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart 
The choice ofa period of forty days ofpen­ance and preparation for both the faithful as well as catechumens seeking baptism at Easter is a deliberate imitation ofJesus' fasting in the desert for forty days and forty nights. As the Sundays of Lent were never intended to be fast days, six weeks of six days fast each week ( =36 days) needed the supplement of four more days. Hence the season was moved backwards to Wednesday, later known as Ash Wednesday. 
It had been decided at a very early time that the special penance for those guilty of serious sin should start at the beginning of Lent. Peni­
d d I d h d 
tents onne a penitentia garment an a ashes sprinkled on them. Then came the rite of 
expulsion from the church. The wearing of special penitential garment and the sprinkling with ashes as an expression ofsorrow and repentance were already familiar to the Old Testa­ment and pagan antiquity. Jesus himself refers to chis practice (see Mt. 11:21). The early church was also familiar with the practice (e.g. Tertullian and St. Cyprian). 
Although the institution of public penance disappeared toward the end of the first mil­lennium, the custom of imposing ashes was restored and applied to all the faithful. Clerics and laymen had ashes sprinkled on their heads; women had a sign of the cross made with ashes on their foreheads. From antiquity and the Old Testament down to the most recent church documents, this action has-been seen as a symbol of transiency, sorrow and penance. 
The three traditional stages needed for a true change of heart during Lent are repen­tance, conversion and reconciliation, themes mentioned time and time again by Pope John Paul II as particularly appropriate during this Holy Year. The chief means to achieve such a change of heart has traditionally included prayer, fasting and almsgiving, as prescribed in the gospel reading for Ash Wednesday (Mt. 6:1-6, 6-18). 
The first reading ---------------------­
of this day from the l prophet Joel (2:12-18) The key word is #turn." This turning : sounds the prophet's 
manifests itself in outward signs:
I call for true repen­1 tance. The heart ofthe 
fasting, almsgiving, prayer. But the
I reading is an invitation I to turn away from sin 
essentiql turning is inward.
I and we do this with the 
I full knowledge that the --------------------­1 mercy we ask from God will be granted since his mercy and love are everlasting. l The reading from 2 Corinthians (5:20-6:2) speaks of the continual need we all experi­: ence for conversion and turning to the Lord. The time for the conversion is declared to be "now," for "now" is the day of salvation. : Finally, the gospel reading from Matthew declares chat it is not enough that we perform I the prescribed disciplines of the season. It speaks more about the motivation than about I performance, about the spirit which prompts them, and not that the letter is fulfilled. I The key word for this day is «turn." The prophet Joel cries out the words of the Lord: ! "Even now, return to me with your whole heart." This turning manifests itself in outward I signs: fasting, almsgiving, prayer. But the essential turning is inward. "Read your hearts, not I your garments." I As we turn to God in fasting, prayer and service, God rums with the gift of life. At the I climax of his turning, God made him who did not know sin to be sin that he might turn us / to be the very holjness of God. The Son of God rurned to rake on our nature that we, who I did not know righteousness, might live by his life. I Fasting, alrnsgiving and prayer arc the three traditional practices of Lent which set us in I our proper place before God and others. To live out this authentic relationship is, for the I Christian, its own reward.

NFL 

Green, Vikings try to lure Marino to Minnesota 
Associated Press 
MI~NEAPOLIS 
At least one team in the NFL doesn't think Dan Marino ts washed up. 
Dennis Green is trying to lure the league's c a r e c r passing leader to Minnesota, where he W O LI I d become the Vikings' eighth starter in eight sea­sons. 
Marino turns 39 this vear and has spent his entire ·17-year career in Miami. He is consid­ering an offer from the Vikings. but also considering retirement. 
The Vikings feature receivers Cris Carter and Randy Moss, but they also lost Pro Bowl offensive linemen Randall McDaniel and Jeff Christy to rival Tampa Bay. 
"Dan called me, and Dan said that the Vikings had offered him a contract and he was thinking about it," Carter told WPTV in West Palm Beach, Fla .. on Monday. 
"Before Minnesota called, I think Dan was going to retire," Carter said from his home in Boca Raton, Fla. "I think it real­ly rekindled some interest that he had maybe four or five months ago." 
Carter also said Marino was concerned about uprooting his children. 
Marino was offered Minnesota's starting quarter­back job last week in talks with Green. two sources close to Marino and speaking on condi­tion of anonymity confirmed Monday. 
Marino, who has never won a championship, most likely will decide by the end of the week, one of the sources said. 
The offer was first reported Sunday night by ESPN and Fox Sports Net, citing unidentified sources. 
''I'm just flabbergasted," Dolphins president Eddie Jones said. "I have no idea about Dan Marino and any report about him going anyplace. [ know nothing about where Dan's head is at or what he plans to do." 
But Jones said for the first time Monday that if Marino plays next season, the Dolphins want him. 
"Danny has been told he can come back," Jones said. 
Green didn't return phone calls from The Associated Press on Monday. Last week, he told

Wednesday's Observer for a preview of the men's Big East Tournament. 

his staff not to discuss the team's quarterback situation in light of heavy criticism of his declaration that Daunte Culpepper, his top draft pick last year. would enter camp as the projected starter. 
But Green told WAFN Radio in Miami he· d love it if Marino and the Vikings pursued their elusive championship rings together. 
''We think this is a perfect merger of a guy who wants one more year to get it done the right way and a team that's looking for that one guy who wants one morn year to get it right," Green said. 
The Vikings haven't offered Jeff George a contract, even though he went 9-3 after com­ing off the bench last season to replace Randall Cunningham, who was demoted 5 112 games into his new $28 million con­tract. 
George's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said he assumed the Vikings would make a push for his client's return once they

He became a free agent last month after voiding his contract with Miami. The Dolphins then signed free agent quarterback Jay Fiedler. 
The Vikings haven't had the money to do much in the free agent market. But Marino's agent, Marvin Demoff, had dis­cussions with the team on a contract that would fit within the salary cap. 
Marino, who had a mediocre 1999, could sign a deal with easily reachable incentives that would not squeeze the Vikings too much. 
The Vikings, who have shak­en up their roster and coaching staff this offseason. are hoping Marino won't pass up a shot at playing with Carter and Moss, who thrived last year with the equally strong-armed George. 
When the Dolphins signed Fiedler to a three-year, $3.8 million contract, it seemed clear Marino had played his last game in Miami.

WOMEN'S BIG EAST CHAMPIONSHIP 
Husky fever alive as UConn plays for Big East title 
STORRS. Conn. 

It's nearly an hour bt'fore the start of the r:onnccticut-Boston College semifinal game of the wo1111.m's Big East tourna­ment on l\1ondav. 
Stnvc and Ka(cn Wilson stand in front of the South r,ntrancc of' the c;ampci Pavilion, their dhows rnsting on a thren-foot high concrete wall. The nrnrriccl couple. residents of nearbv Chaplin, Conn .. ar;~ linishing the last drags of' their ciga­

Stt'vc in his UConn hat and Karr>n in trnr blue "Connecticut bas-ki>tball" sweatshirt \.Vith XXL embla­zon<1d across the middlo, arc getting rnady to SHH t!rnir beloved Iluskies com­pPtf' against their neighboring rivals. This is the second time they have seen Connecticut live this year, the first being n 72-71 loss to Tennessee on reb. 2, the Huskies' only defeat of this season. 
Lyi11g on the concrete wall is a white post.er with alternating blue and white letters spelling UConn. Below the UConn, in black letters, is the word "Rocks." 
"I got on TV the last time I had a poster." explains Steve with a grin. UConn Rocks, That phrase exprnsses the feelings of' many in Husky Nation. 
With their state located between Nr,w York and Boston, Connecticut profes­sional sports fans' loyalties are divided. There arc Hed Sox supporters and Yankee fans. Some prefer the Patriots; others like the Jets or Giants. Both Celtics and Knicks, Bruins and Rangers fans pnpulate the Nutmeg State. 
But when it comes to college basket­
ball. there's only one team in town. And for good reason. The Huskies have won the last seven 
Big East regular season titles and six­straight tournament championships. In the 1990s. they participated in three Final Fours and six Elite Eight appear­ances. The 1995 team finished the sea­son at 35-0 en route to the national title. 
Five I Iusky alums are currently in the WNBA, including three former national college Player of the Year recipients ­Rebecca Lobo, Jennifer Rizotti and Kara Wolters. 
These feats haven't gone unnoticed by the locals. 


All of the Connecticut regular season games sold out during the summer. Eighty members of the media regularly attend each home game, be it a January date with West Virginia or a nationally televised game against Tennessee. 
Getting a ticket for a game is as tough as predicting the weather in South Bend during the winter. The Wilsons were lucky enough to get their tickets through Karen's brother's company. Without those conner.lions, they would be sitting on their couch, watching the game with their thrne daughters. 
"We watch all the games," the Wilsons said. "We were fortunate tonight [getting tickets]." 
The Wilsons weren't the only Connecticut !'ans getting ready to enter Garnpr.l before the warm-ups began. 
As thousands rmtered the North entrance, they were greeted with high­fives by the team's mascot. the aptly named Husky. 
Ruses transported fans from cars parked miles away from the stadium. 
Ticket scalpers searched for any inter­ested buyers. There were plenty. Sellers are sr.arcc before Husky games. It's a far cry from the Irish home games, where you can't give away enough tickets to fill the Joyo Center. 
The scene is reminiscent of that an hour before an Irish home football game. 
Except the crowd at Gampel is an eighth of the size of Notre Dame Stadium. 
College basketball to them is what col­lege football means to many Irish fans. 
It's the biggest game in town. 

And it's not limited to just the women. The men's team, the 1999 National Champions, regularly sell out all their games. The crowd still chants an ever­present "U-C-0-N-N, UConn!, UConn!, UConn!" 
To witness the atmosphere of Husky Nation, take Route 195 North from Storrs, follow 84 west to 91 South and you'll be in New York City, home of Madison Square Garden, the site of this weekend's men's' Big East tournament. 
Once there, you'll be surrounded by a swarm of blue and white tee-shirts, hats, sweaters, sweatshirts -anything with a UConn logo. They could sell Connecticut toilet paper and these fans would be willing to pay for it. 
In last year's conference championship game against St. John's, you could have sworn it was a Husky home game. Never mind that St. John's is located a few

miles from the Garden. Tonight, the Connecticut women face Rutgers in the tournament final. 
Rutgers, eighth in the nation beat a very good Notre Dame team 81-72 in overtime on Monday night. The Scarlet Knights play an aggressive defense and feature one of the conference's top play­ers in Shawnetta Stewart. The last time the two teams met, the Huskies squeaked out a 65-60 victory. 
But this is different, this is the Big East 
championship, a title the Huskies have won each of the previous six years. And it's at home, where the Huskies have won 73 Big East games in a row. Tune in tonight at 7:30 on ESPN2 and look for a "UConn Rocks" poster. Steve and Karen Wilson were able to get tickets for the final.

Gilmore. 
Down by eight with 14:28 left in regulation, Gilmore came off the bench and scored nine straight Knights' points to keep her squad within a basket of the Irish. 40-38. 
"When my shots started falling, I said to myself, 'It's about time,"' said Gilmore. ''I've been struggling with my shooting for some time." 
But as Gilmore's streak wore off, momentum began to swing the way of the Irish. Notre Dame took advantage of Rutgers' center Tammy Sutton­Browne's absence on the court because of a fourth foul and took the ball inside to run up its lead to eight with seven minutes left to play. 


But with three minutes remaining, Sutton-Browne checked back in and momen· tum changed again. Shutting down the Irish in the lane, the Knights dominated on offense and took the lead 61-58 with 
43.3 seconds remaining. 
As Irish guard Danielle Green drove down the lane with a clear shot at the hoop, Stewart sPnt guard Alicia Ratay to the line with an off-ball foul. The stoic freshman nailed the two free throws. cutting the deficit to one, 61-60. 
The Irish fouled Stewart immediately on the in-bounds play, sending her to the line with 34 seconds remaining. The senior hit both, pushing the Knights' lead to two, 62-60. Irish center Ruth Riley came up with the rebound off Stewart's missed foul shot, giving the Irish possession of the ball. 
Danielle Green tried her luck in the lane again and was fouled by Stewart. The senior hit both free throws to tie the game. 
Rutgers had one last chance to score in regulation, but a lay-up from Stewart bounced around the rim and out, send­ing the game into overtime. 
The Knights took control on offense in overtime, leading the whole way. 
"We just wanted it more tonight," said Stewart. "We out-hustled them the whole time." 
Finding themselves down, the Irish were forced to foul, but the Knights were solid from the line, distancing themselves from the Irish by nine points with a minute left to play. 
The Irish could not find a good shot as the Knights tight­ened their defense as the final seconds ticked off the clock and Rutgers advanced to the final round of the tournament. 
Riley led the Irish with 20 points from the paint and Ratay chipped in 15 from the outside to pace the squad. 
"Most teams have double teamed me all year," said Riley of the Knights' defense. "I was just happy to be able to score or get the ball to Julie !Henderson] or Niele [Ivey] when I could." 
Stewart directed the Knights' offense with 23 points and Sutton-Brown added 17. 

The Irish struggled on the boards all night. The Knights outrebounded the Irish 39-27 and took advantage of many second and third looks on offense. 
Rutgers, which avenged reg­ular season losses to Villanova and Notre Dame in the tourna­ment, will have a chance to make up for its loss to Connecticut earlier in the sea­son when the Knights meet the No. 1 team tonight in the tour­nament finals. 
"We're just trying to survive and advance," said senior Knights' guard Tasha Pointer, who had eight points Monday. "We're just taking it one game at a time." 
The Irish have almost two weeks off to regroup before they begin their run for the NCAA title next week. 
"I don't know [what this does to our tournament hopes]. I don't know how tho NCAA thinks," said Irish head coach Muffct McGraw of her team's loss. "I think we deserve a home game, but we're proba­bly a second or third seed." ' 
The NCAA selection commit­tee will release the tournament seedings Sunday.

Irish pull away from Pioneers with late surge

By MIKE CONNOLLY Sports Writer 
The Irish scored seven unanswered goals in 17 min­utes as Notre Dame broke open a 5-4 first half lead into a 18-7 victory over the Denver Pioneers Sunday in Colorado. 
With 20 minutes left in the first half, t!w Irish led by just one goal. The slow start, how­ever, did not concern captain Laci 0'Shaughnessy. 
"Jt usually takes us a little bit to get rolling but w1-1 usual­ly pull it out," O'Shaughnessy said. "I guess it just took us until then to get into our groove." 
()'Shaughnessy scornd two goals in tlrn first half' and two goals in the second hall' to lead the Irish in scoring. The junior from Alexandria, Va., who led the Irish in goals last year with 50, also picked up an assist. 
The slow start for the Irish did not surprise 0'Shaughncssy either. The Irish tended to start slow last year as well. 
"We have just always had a hard time starting right off the bat," she said. "But I think we started a lot quicker [SundayJ than we usually have." 
Starting three freshmen Sunday also played a factor in the slow start. Although the Irish practiced in the fall and defeated Virginia in an exhibi­tion last weekend, the Irish are still adjusting to playing with each other. 

"It's just getting comfortable with each other," O'Shaughrrnssy said. "It takes a whole season to get comfort­able with each other really." 
The three freshman who did start Angela Dixon, Danielle Shearer and Kelly Mccardell -all played well for the Irish. 
Dixon scorNI thrne goals and added an assist. Dixon's three goals placed her third on the team i11 goals -behind ()'Shaughnessy and sopho­morn Alissa Moser who Pach had four. 
"I was really happy for her," 0'Shaughnessy said about Dixon. "l was glad she stepped up for us but she still has to get her freshman nfll'VPS out of her. She played well in practice with us so I was glad that she wasn't too scarPd or too nervous in her first game." 
Shearer tied 0'Shaughnessy for the lead in points with two goals and thrne assists. 
Mccardell, who played with the U.S. undcr-19 national team this summer. started on an Irish defensr, that yielded just 23 shots and won the groundball battle, 34-23. Mccardell also picked up an assist. 
In her first start after trans­ferring from the University of Massachusetts, Irish goalkeep­er Tara Durkin made 10 saves while Carrie Marshall, last year's starting goalkeeper, came in and made seven saves.

"W1 wnren't prnpared. They had s1·outC'cl our offonse and wn didn't eVl'll get to look at

The Quakers, with I.heir one­on-one dAfense. r.onfused the normally balanced Irish offense all day. 
Penn's d('f('nSP had prepared well for :-Jotre Dame's attack and gave llrnm troub!A on defense ½'hile their underrated offense kept control of the ball for mur.h of the afternoon. 
"Thev had the ball the whole time, and 1.he fow times w11'd get it. WP would panic and try to do too much," said Ulrich, who ltid the Irish with three goals. "Their defi>nse was rnally Lough. Our guys \\ho normally score were shut down." 
The Penn defcnsP was in r.ontrol but Notre Dame's offense still had some good chances. The Irish. howevPr, failC'd to capitalize, similar to the first half of the Penn State game. 

"We definitely oulshot them. We just couldn't capitalize." Ulrich said. "I think we played hard but we didn't execute." 
The Notre Dame defense struggled, giving up 10 goals, but goalie Kirk Howell did come up with 14 saves in another solid performance. 
The loss will not hurt Notre Dame's standing in the Great Wcst-ern Lacrosse League. since Penn is not in the League, but team members stressed the loss was not with­out consequence. 
"We need to win games like this to be successful," Ulrich said. "This loss doesn't affect our league standings, but it could come back to haunt us do:vn,. the road if we end up in a tie. 
The Irish will travel to Colorado for two matches next weekend. They face University of Denver on Saturday and Air rorce Academy on Mar. 13.

Coming into Sunday's show­down with the Nu. 21 Kentucky Wildcats, the Irish were running on fumes. Having played six matches in the previous nine days, Notre Dame was P-xhausted but nev­ertheless found a way to rise to the occasion, pulling out a 7-2 win.

NBA 

Rockets' Barkley hired as TV analyst 
Associated Press 
Charles Barkley will start his new job as TV analyst Tuesday, even though he still wants to return to his old job before the end of the season. 
Barkley has been hired by Turner Sports to work as a studio analyst on NBA broad­casts. He will make his debut Tuesday night, then will work only occasionally the rest of this season before picking up a greater workload in the next two seasons. 
Barkley still hopes to return from a serious knee injury to play one more game for the Houston Rockets, their season finale against Vancouver on April 19. 
"My objective is to play in the last game of the year," Barkley said Monday on a conference call to announce his hiring. "I want my last recollection of basketball to be a positive one, and I want to walk off the court under my own strength in my last game." 
Barkley ruptured a knee tendon Dec. 8 in a game at Philadelphia, an injury that was expected to keep his out for the rest of the season and end his career. 
But Barkley said his reha­bilitation is going so well that he is looking forward to play­ing one more time. He said his knee remains four to six weeks away from being strong enough to play on. 

"It bothers me that I'm not going to be playing basketball anymore. There's no substi­tute for that," he said. "If I hadn't gotten hurt in Philadelphia, I was going tu play next year because I was so mad I got hurt." 
Barkley, a 16-year NBA vet­eran, said he chose the job at Turner Sports over a similar job at NBC Sports because he felt Turner wanted him more. 
Turner televises NBA games on the cable networks TBS and TNT. 
Barkley's deal runs for two seasons after this one, coin­ciding with the length of Turner's broadcasting con­tract with the NBA. 
Barkley also will be avail­able to provide his own humorous brand of contribu­tions to Turner's other sports broadcasts, including the 2001 Goodwill Games. Atlanta Braves baseball. NASCAH races, professional golf and tennis. 
The network is still not cer­tain exactly what role Barkley might have outside of NBA telecasts, Turner Sports pres­ident Mark Lazarus said.

Irish post 2-1 record at Hormel Foods Classic 
By NOAH AMSTADTER Spom Writer 
Playing in its second tourna­ment of the season. the Irish baseball team improved its season rcr.ord to 4-2 as it won two of three games at last Wfc'ek­e n d ' s 
llorrnf'l F o o d s C.lassic at t h e Metrodome in Minn­e a po Ii s. Minn. 
On Sunday, Notre Dame defealed a Georgia team that came into the tournanrnnt undel'eatf1d before falling to Minnesota on Fridav. Notre Dame was led by junfor right­hander Aaron Heilman, who finished with a career-high 12 strikeouts while only allowing one unearned run in eight innings. 
"lllcilman] was basically the story of that last game,.. head coach Paul Mainieri said. "lie totally dominated that game and we scratched for enough runs to be able to win." 
The Irish went up 3-1 on a double by junior shortstop Alec Porzel before adding three insurance runs in the seventh. Those runs proved essential as the Bulldogs ral­lied to score three runs in the ninth off sophomore pitcher Drew Duff. Closer John Corbin came in to record the final out, earning his 10th career save. 
On Saturday, the Irish lost an up and down game to a surprising \finnesota team. After Minnesota scored five runs off freshman pitcher J.P Gagne in the first three innings, Notre Dame rallied to take a 7-6 lead before finally falling 9-7. 
"I can imagine what a 


thrilling experiencP-that must have been for the boy," said Mainir.ri of Minnesota native Gagne. ··Even though he gave up five runs and most people would say he wasn't st1ccP.ss­ful, I still think he showed a lot of poise out thflrn. I saw potential for thf' future, I'm not giving up on him." 
Sophomore Steve Stanley wPnt 2-f'or-3 with two walks und three stolen bases in Lhe Minnesota game, adding to an impressive weekend that earned him all-tournament team honors. 
"I had a good weekend. I just did whatever I could to help Urn trmm win the games." Stanley sai<l. "For me that's .i ust to try to ~et on basr, and producr, runs, let guys drive me in." 
Adding injury to insult, the team lost sPnior captain Jeff Perconte during the Minnesota game. Diving hard for a groundball on the turf, the second baseman injured his shoulder and his status for this weekend's games is unde­terminr,d. 
In thP opening game of the tournament. Notre Dame received its second consecu­tive dominating performance by senior right-hander Scott Cavey. Cavey allowed two runs on four hits in six innings in defeating No. 24 Wake Forest, 8-5. 
"The story of that game was Scott Cavey." Mainieri said. "Wake Forest has one of the top teams in the country, win­ning back-to-back ACC cham­pionships. and for Scott to go out then~ and pitch that, well. is just fantastic." 
Stanley and fellow sopho­more third baseman Andrew Bushey each had three hits to lead a 16-hit attack against the Deamon Deacons.

"The [regular season] loss was a heartbreak­er," said Scarlet Knights' guard Shawnetta Stewart. "It feels real good to beat them tonight. We really stuck together through the adversity on the court."
