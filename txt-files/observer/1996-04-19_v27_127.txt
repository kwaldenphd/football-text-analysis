Contending that his book, "Catholicism," was misunder­stood due to criticism meant also as an attack on himself. Father Hichard McBrien, Notre Dame professor of Theology and prominent moral theolo­gian, responded yesterday to a National Conference of Catholic Bishops committee's review of it. 
Last Tuesday, the Secretariat for Doctrine and Pastoral Prac­tices. led by executive director Father Augustine DiNoia, claimed that the latest edition

birth of Jesus probably never happened and holds that homosexuality, con­traception and women's ordi­nation are open questions, with the official church teach­ing merely being one option. 
The Committee on Doctrine, which makes statements on theological issues and is chaired by Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cinncinnati, claimed that while McBrien's book demonstrates the diversi­ty of viewpoints within the Church, it de-emphasizes established Church teachings and stresses modern thinking. 
This complicates the read­


tions. According to the five­member committee. the book contains criti­cisms of Pope John Paul II's conservatism and of the Church's demand of celibacy among priests. It also maintains the possi­bility for Catholics to believe Jesus Christ

'Intercourse' with Dr. Ruth... 
SUB brings renowned sex doctor 
By KELLY BROOKS News Writor 
"Sex kills, so go to Notre Dame and live forever." If that bootleg shirt slogan is any indication, then Dr. Huth Westheimer will have her work cut out for her as she tries to avoid controversial issues while still having a frank and engaging lecture on relationships. 
"I spoke with Dr. Huth and explained that it is a con­servative campus, asking her to be respectful of tbe Catholic character of the University," said Rob Laux, Student Union Board advisor. "She said she'd try but couldn't promise that she'd refrain from speak­ing on uncomfortable topics." 
The University can do little to censor the lectures that come to campus. "We have an open speakers policy at Notre Dame," explained Julie Wall­man, outgoing Ideas and Issues commissioner at SUB. "The administration will not stand in the way of intellectual pursuit." 
Wallman brought Billy Joel and Greg Louganis and con­tracted to bring Gerry Adams to Notre Dame. 
"There are no limits placed on what she [Dr. Ruth] could say but we asknd her to be re­spectful of the University," Laux commented. 
The questions submitted by students will be screened. This is actually Dr. Huth's pol­icy. "The questions are screened at all of her speaking engagements per her re­quest," Laux eontinued. "She doesn't want vulgar questions. 
"She wants to make sure the questions arc legitimate and not someone rambling. From her expnriences students may be embarrassed to ask thnm publicly and lind it easier to write tlwm down."

The OfTiee of Information Technology was granted a mere 10 percent of the funds they projected as necessary to eomplete the HesNet plan in its entirety. 
"We put together a budget proposal that we believed was just enough to support the halls and their wiring," said Scott Silflr, manager of Student Computer Support and coordi­nator support for HesNet. "The central administration has sev­eral plans they must review to decide which they will fund. It's a tough decision."

Ben a tar philosophy 
Let's face it: at times, we all think that we are the busiest person on campus. My roommate and I spend twenty min­utes each night, duking out just who is busier than the other. This semester, having had to adjust from the Club Med atmosphere of the London Program to the rigors of ROTC immersion and a challenging schedule, I have reflected on just why we stress our bodies and minds. As we enter the crunch time before finals, and prepare to "suck it up" for the remaining weeks, I offer the following insights on the constant state of pressure that surrounds us. 
Over the past few years, I have come upon and assessed the personal relevance of many motivational theories. One maxim, provided by an often underestimated philosopher, Pat Benatar, encapsulates all others. She sums up why we should continue to strive, to accom­plish and to challenge ourselves in a mere phrase; "We are young." Though seemingly simple, this principle has become fundamental in allowing me to motivate and continually push myself. 
We should continue to challenge ourselves because that is our role, and because we can. As I see it, the purpose of our is to pack our lives with so many experiences that we become exposed to an infinite matrix of situa­tions. Meet, and be open to, as many people as we come across. Join eight different clubs. Play interhall sports. Make time for an occa­sional book or lecture. Keep up with classes. Date as many people as time allows. Build friendships. Go to three bars, one party and Fat Shirley's on a Thursday night, and then cram for a test. Keep your wits about you through it all. Oh, and don't forget to have fun. It is only by surrounding ourselves with constant challenges, and staying infmitely busy, that we will ever realize our potential, learn our limits. and truly suck the marrow out of life. Never use time as a scapegoat. If you slept last night, then you have the time. 
By exposing ourselves to diverse envi­ronments, people, and situations, we will de­velop a true personality, a self. How can you be sure you want to be a lawyer if you have never tried any other jobs? How can you be sure of who you love unless you've tried to date twenty other people? 
Looking back on my short life, I have come to see that I have grown the most by placing myself in uncomfortable and challenging con­ditions. Joining the military was not some­thing I eased into. Spending Christmas away from my family was a difficult choice. Being chased, beaten and spat at in a Moroccan medina was an encounter that, in retrospect, I'm glad I experienced. During these times of stress and uneasiness. I neared my limit of endurance and learned a great deal about myself. I matured. 
Every one of us is lucky. We have families and friends supporting us, and we attend a university that abounds in opportunities. We are alive. Our good fortune presents us with a duality: the ability to avoid challenges, cou­pled with the responsibility to endure them. We owe it to ourselves to seek out the "roads less traveled" and expose ourselves to ill at ease situations. By doing so, we will fulfill our duty to ourselves, and we'll grow. In ten years. stressing over finals will seem like fight­ing for cereal box prizes, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't devote our energy to it. There is a lesson to be learned, and an experi­ence to be sought.

A few good men and women...

Rosswurm connects Jesuit values and FBI 
By ALEX ORR Nt·w, Wrirer 
.1. Elll{ar lloover, labor unions, and the .Jesuit vision of mas­eulinity all ligun~d prominently in a diseussion given by Steve Hosswurm last night in the llesburgh Library lounge. 
Hosswurm. a professor of his­tory at Lake Forest College, spoke about the disproportion­ate number of .Jesuit-sehooled nwrnbers of tlw FBI during lloovm's term as Direetor, and tlw FBI's link with the Catholic Church in Arneriea. 
Though "they workml through tlw Chureh as a whole," in par­ticular "tlw FBI and the .Jesuits were very elose," said Hosswurrn. lin detailed the give and take of information b1~twnen tlw .Jnsuits and tlw Bureau, the eoordination between the two orl{anizations to purge labor unions of communists, and the "n~ady pool of reliable men" produeml by various Ameriean .JesuitlJniw~rsitins for the FBI.

arehal family, law and authority are enormously important," said Hosswurm. The mutual belief in hierarchy, discipline, and a "combative maseuline personal­ity" provided a shared ethos and common ideals. 
Those beliefs led scores of well trained men coming out of .Jesuit schools into the FBI ranks. They also led to the efforts of the .Jesuit hierarchy to end a perceived communist threat within the labor move­ment with super-legal govern­mental help. 
Hosswurm claims that both lloover and the .Jesuits were "fathers without a family, patri­arclls without a wife." He explained that they were men driven by masculinity and a par­ticular view of the world order. 
This brought up the issue of lloover's social relations and personal drives. During ten years of research, Hosswurm uncovered "no evidence that he ever wore a dress. Hoover's detractors use the dress to dele­gitimize him." Hosswurm's paper was entitled "Manhood, Communism, and Americanism: The FBI and American Jesuits."

the additional 21,000 seats, won't be finished and available for use until the start of the 1997 season. 
Associate Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham, who is overseeing the project from that department's perspective, only sees optimism in the months ahead. "So far, so good. If things continue at this pace, I see no reason why everything won't be ready prior to the '96 and '97 seasons," he said. 
With the external structure and some decorative masonry in place, the north end of the stadium shows students what they can expect to see during next year's home games­including the construction equipment, yellow tape, and unleveled mounds of dirt. 
"Well, the six games next fall will look like they're being played in a construction zone," Cunningham said. 
Plans for next season call for four temporary asphalt paths to be laid to allow people to enter the stadium. Additional security and ushers will be hired to keep the crowd out of harm's way. 
"Our main concern is that 
people walk in the designated 
areas. The whole pedestrian 
flow will be significantly differ­
ent than it's been the past 60 
years," Cunningham added. 
Although they will use only 
one entrance gate, students will 
continue to enter the stadium 
from the north end in 1996, just 
as they have in the past. 
"We're excited that it's finally 
becoming a reality. We've 
looked at plans for years, but 
now it's taking shape," Smith 
said. 

McBrien 
continued from page 1 
McBrien said, "the primary mis­understanding" in the review is that the book is meant for beginners. 
"It is not a catechism," he pointed out. Rather, "It is a comprehensive survey of both Catholic doctrine and Catholic theology," and it distinguishes between both. "Catholicism" is meant for theological discussion by students who have a faith "strong enough" to handle di­verse opinions and a variety of points of view. "What it's really about is people learning their faith," McBrien said. 
In the preface to "Catholi­cism," McBrien states his intent that the book serve as "a bridge between the Church of yester­day and the church of today." 
After having the book pub­lished by Harper Collins in 1980, McBrien considered the committee's comments from its 1985 review of the book's first and second versions when his revisions resulted in the printing of a third edition of the 1,286­

1st and 2nd Place in the Fisher Regatta '96 
five years as chomps! 
page book in 1994. "It was even more carefully nuanced. I'm quite satisfied with the new edi­tion," he said. 
The real issue concerning the r(lview, McBrien said, is the committee's belief that "Notre Dame undergrads aren't intel­lectually sophisticated enough to be able to read and understand a book like this." This, too, is a misunderstanding on the part of the committee, according to McBrien, who has been teach­ing Notre Dame undergraduates for 16 years using "Catholicism." 
Basing his conclusions on stu­dents' grades and their re­sponses on teacher-course eval­uations, McBrien said, "I don't remember anyone saying that the book was hard to un­derstand or that it gave them a reason to leave the Church." 
McBrien said his response to the committee is, "You don't know Notre Dame undergrads." Because they are "sophisticated intellectually," McBrien believes that the book challenges Notre Dame students. "It doesn't give them encouragement to dissent to Church teaching." 
Not only is McBrien dis­pleased with the committee's intent to discourage the use of "Catholicism" as a text, he said he sees the review as an attack on himself. 
"It's not about the book, but me," McBrien told The New York Times last week. "They resent my interviews with the press and on television." 
This prompted the review, according to McBrien, who, as one of the highest profile American Catholics, is often asked for an opinion by the New York Times, Washington Post and Associated Press. McBrien has also appeared on major television networks, including programs such as Nightline and The McNeiVLehrer News Hour. 
"This irritates a certain type of Catholic leader in the Vatican," McBrien said. 
Noting that the review is not a ban, but rather an opinion of a five-member committee,

McBrien said he did not know whether or not the group was unanimous in its decision to crit­icize his book. 
Despite his expectation that the book will be used by "ultra­conservative groups as another hammer to whack" at him, McBrien said "Catholicism" will continue to be read and dis­cussed in classrooms and parishes. 
The book, having sold over 150,000 copies, is also pub­lished in England, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia. It was named "Best Popular Exposition of the Catholic Faith" by the Catholic Press Association, according to McBrien.

Rodriguez: Hispanic theology 'powerful' 
ByBERNADETTEPAMPUCH News Wri1er 
Jeanette Hodriguez, theolo­gian, lecturer, author and con­sultant, is not only Saint Mary's twelfth annual Madeleva Lec­ture speaker but also the author of "Stories We Live/Cuentos que vivimos," a book dealing with Hispanic women's theology that is soon to be published by Paulist Press. The book is unique as it deals with religion from a woman's point of view. 
"What I decided to do on a huneh was ask women to tell me a story, a story that some woman in their family had told them. I wanted the one story that was so transformatory that you will never forget them, that you will pass them onto your children," she said in an inter­view Thursday. 
She began eollecting stories in her kitchen over a 10 month timH and after collecting nearly 100 of them she was able to put together enough to lill a book and part of her lecture at Saint Mary's on Thursday night. 
"I cried when l wrote this book because some of the sto­ries are so moving," she said. "They are very intentionally about life, which led me to the whole theological discussion of how it is that you are experienc­ing life and articulating life, and that is through language. 
"What it is that sometimes helps us get through life is sto­ries. They can either delight us or entertain us, teach us and instruct us." 
One of the most powerful sto­ries in the Latino tradition is the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe, patron saint of Mexico and sym­bol of inspiration throughout much of the Americas. 
"It is the major symbol that pulls together the hopes and aspirations of the people," said Rodriguez of Guadalupe. "Guadalupe is really the Guadalupe of the Americas; when she appeared in 1531 there were no borders." 
Many of the stories in her book strike a chord with any­one, regardless of heritage. 
"A woman l interviewed from San Antonio, Texas, talked about the stories her mother would tell her ~bout growing up in World War II." 
She went on to tell the story of the woman's close-knit Chicano community where she grew up and the heart-stopping horror of hearing the bell of the bicycle of a messenger coming to tell a 
Lecture highlights spirituality, culture 
ByJILL FENSTERMAKER 
NewsWri1er 
The link between culture and spirituality is an important issue, according to Dr. Jeanette Rodriguez-Holguin. 
Last night a diverse audience listened to the twelfth annual speaker in the Madeleva Lec· tures on Spirituality. Ro· driguez focused on Hispanic women and their worship of OurLady of Guadalupe. · 
Rodriguez began her lecture with a song accompanied by a slide presentation. She showed that "sharing from within is the greatest service we can do." 
Rodriguez then began to fo· cus on Our Lady of Guadalupe. She told the story of how the Mexicans were oppressed by the Spanish, and Mary ap­peared to a poor man who wished to convert and learn Catholicism. Rodriguez ex­plained that Our Lady of Guadalupe conveyed a certain hope to them. Student Joanna Grossa felt this was a strong message. "The presenta· tion ... gave us an idea of what the people experienced through oppression and hope." 
Rodriguez concluded by stat· ing that cries of abandonment are not isolated to people in the time of Our Lady of Guadalupe. "They can be hea.rd in Bosnia, El Salvador, even Los Angeles." With this, Rodriguez showed a picture of Our Lady; the audience joined in singing to end the lecture.

Role stereotypes due to hormones 
By TRACY ALLEGA 
News Writer 
"Testosterone is overrated," said Helen Longino in a forum on the inadequacy of physiolog­ical and anatomical explana­tions to account for discrepan­cies in human gender role be­havior. 
In searching for biological explanations for homosexuality, Longino, a professor of Philosophy at the University of Minnesota,said, "we lose the opportunity to think of sexuality as an integral part of human life." 
The "linear hormonal model" used by biologists seeks to find a "functional connectivity of gender roles as an outcome of the exposure of the brain to certain hormones," according to Longino. 
Attempts to trace homosexu­ality serially to some set of in­dependent initiating events cat­egorize homosexuals solely on the basis of sexual orientation. Longino believes that, "sexuali­ty is tied up with cognitive life .. . and there is a better way of thinking than that about what it is to be a person." 
The "selectionist model," out­lined by Longino, is a theory addressing the question of how the structure and functioning of the brain affects human gender behavior. 
This model is more complex than the linear model in that it describes a "brain that is self­organizational in the context of experience," Longino said. However, with the complexity of the selective model, "human gendered behavior loses its sig­nificance to biology." 
The main issue addressed by Longino is the dilemma of the tendency for humans to avoid complex, holistic explanations of homosexuality in favor of more simple, linear models. 
An example is the "auto-parts conception of personhood" in which "we all have the 'right' parts that go with our kind, and when the parts gets switched, discrepant human behavior oc­curs." 
Longino also spoke on her belief that the discovery of a physiological or anatomical ex­planation for homosexuality would be a disadvantage to ho­mosexuals. 
"Although identifying some specific explanation is superfi­cially attractive, there are also situational and social factors that determine sexual orienta­tion," Longino said. 
A specific feature determined to cause homosexuality would be problematic for homosexuals who do not have this feature. "We love who we love," and "love the one you're with" are song lyrics Longino used to il­lustrate her point. 
Longino spoke Thursday on topics addressed in her article "Gender, Sexuality Research, and the Flight from Complex­ity" PPin the context of the GLND/SMC debate. She special­izes in the philosophy of sci­ence, and tries to incorporate a feminist perspective into the discipline. 
SMC sponsors display of unique Odissi dance 
Special to The Observer 
The Office of Multicultural Af­fairs, Saint Mary's College is cosponsoring with the India As­sociation of Notre Dame and the Asian Indian Classical Music Society of Michiana a concert of Odissi dance featuring the renowned dancer Protima Gauri Bedi and the Nrityagram Dance Ensemble. The concert will be held at the O'Laughlin Auditorium on Sunday, April 21 at 2 p.m. 
Indian classical dancing has a tradition dating back more than two millennia. The earliest treatise on drama, dance, and music of ancient India, the Bharata Natyashastra was com­posed in pre-Christian times and describes basic rules of Indian classical dances. Dancing (nritya) in India has always been closely connected with acting (natya), both being aspects of a single art, abhinaya, the por­trayal of emotions. 
Indian dancing is not merely a thing of legs and arms alone, but of the whole body. Every movement of the little finger or the eyebrow is significant and must be fully controlled. 
The poses and gestures have been classified in detail, even as early as in the Bharata Natyashastra. Later texts have classified many more poses and gestures, every one of which depicts a specific emotion or ob­ject. With so many possible combinations, the dancer can tell a whole story, easily com­prehensible to an observer who knows the basic convention. 
Odissi is a classical dance­form from Orissa, a picturesque state in Eastern India. Tradi­tionally performed by Devada­sis, who were young girls dedi­cated to performing songs and dances only in temples, Odissi dates back to the second cen­tury B.C. It is a dance of love and passion, human and divine rolled into one, and its poses are statuesque yet vibrant, casting an everlasting spell. It has its own distinctive features with motifs reflecting sculptural de­signs inspired by the temple carvings at Konark. 
Tickets will be available at the gate. General admission is $15; Notre Dame/Saint Mary's faculty and staff $8. Students are $3.

Notre Dame 'ideal' site for SRB 
By MARILYN ALIOTO 
News Writer 
Although there are 60 busi­ness sehools with membership and 650 members aeross the eountry, Notre Dame is the first business sehool to offer the unique Studenl'i for Responsible Business (SHB) opportunity to undergraduates. 
Established in 1993, SRB is an international organization based in San Francisco which pro­motes soeial responsibility as an important eomponent to tradi­ti!mal business practices. In eooperation with faeulty mem­bers, Notre Dame students at the undergraduate and graduate lev11ls are committed to conduet­ing business with integrity, aeco u n tability, responsibility and honesty by ineorporating ethies into the business arena. 
Aside from finaneial suceess, the goal of SRB, aeeording to Mark Moskowitz, is to "look at communities in relation to busi­nesses and to recognize that stockholders include corporate employees, customers, the com­munity and the environment." SHB works with companies like McDonalds and Amoco, making them more socially responsible. 
SRB completed a successful first year because, "there is a great foundation of service here at Notre Dame which allowed our business school to be the first to open SRB to undergrad­uates," said Moskowitz. 
He added that since Notre Dame emphasizes academics as well as social service and spiri­tual excellence, there is a great environment for SRB and a growing social responsibility. "Within the MBA Program there is a uniqueness, in that business majors take the social service medium from the classroom out­side," said Brett Barlag, director of Community Development Initiative (CDI). 
According to Jim Castro, co­director of SHB, "On the inter­

national level, Notre Dame ean be a leader beeause of the its history and dedication to soeial service." 
There were four programs established within SRB during this first year. The first pro­gram is Real Life Issues, whieh brings faeulty, students, and to­eat business leaders together to diseuss ethieal issues. In addi­tion, the SHB Symposium Series sponsored guest speakers who advoeate social responsibility. 
Another "main force in SRB," according to Barlag, is COL Its goal is to teaeh the prineiples of business to those in need and to improve the eeonomie eonditions of the South Bend eommunity through pro bono programs. Aeeording to Barlag, "an Entrepreneurial Assistance Program will begin running in the spring of 1997." 
CDI also helps Dismas House, a non profit organization that f~eds, houses and provides job opportunities for former pris­oners, by designing a two year finaneial program to help them beeome self-sufficient. CDI also visits local high sehools and pre­sents basie business situations for the students. "Most students will not be able to attend eollege and this is an opportunity for them to begin to see the prinei­ples of business," said Bar lag. 
"Ethies is not as vocal as it is at Notre Dame. We need to take one step further to set the tone. Notre Dame students should be thrilled to be involved," said Castro. In its first year, three SRB members were granted internships. 
This weekend, Chieago will host the SRB Midwestern Con­ferenee. Sehools in attendance will be Northwestern and the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Katie Lawler, outgoing Board Manager, explained why Dr. Ruth was approved to speak on campus. "There is a difference between bringing an entertainer and a speak­er.... Dr. Ruth is billed as a lecture [which means] she can't come and talk about sex and throw out condoms." 
As long as there is intellec­tual intent in her lecture, Dr. Ruth can rely on her First Amendment rights. The University had to approve her contract before she could be allowed to speak on campus. 
The University approves all contracts. First Joe Cassidy must sign them and from there they move to Student Affairs and Patricia O'Hara's desk. The General Council and Business Affairs must give their approval as well. 
Campus groups such as Stu­dent Union Board can get con­troversial figures such as Louganis and Dr. Ruth ap­proved by focusing on them as lecturers. 
"We know people are infa­mous for certain things and you have to combat it. ... There is compliance on a cer­tain level but we are still try­ing to bring in speakers," added Amanda DiGirolamo. 
Student Union Board is sponsoring Dr. Ruth's lecture, held at Stepan Center tonight at 7:30. Tickets are $3 at the door.

As for the remainder of resi­dence halls, they are still scheduled to receive ResNet service at various times throughout the 1996-97 year. "In the fall of 1997, all the halls, including graduate resi­dences, will be up and run­ning," Siler says. 
Help will be available for students s-eeking aid in using the network, or with any questions, problems, or con­cerns. Resident Computer Consultants (RCCs) will be appointed in each hall, help­ing fellow students with the connection and making aid more readily available at any time. 
"The application to become an RCC can be accessed through the clusters' home page," said Siler. He clarified that the RCCs will not be working on an on-call basis; rather, at the convenience of both parties, the RCC will meet with the concerned stu­dent. 
Further questions will be answered in the Byteline, a newsletter to be mailed to stu­dents' homes in May. 
Siler encourages both stu­dents and parents to read the Byteline so that they are fully prepared. "It will clarify exactly what does or doesn't need to be done to prepare their computers for ResNet," he said. 
Siler concluded by reaffirm­ing the belief that the tighter budget will not affect services. "Students will be able to use the ResNet and enjoy it," he asserted. "We're still excited about it."

ATLANTA 

.The number of people in the United States diagnosed with AIDS in 1995 fell 7 percent from the previous year, federal researchers said Thursday. 
Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 74,180 AIDS cases, or 
27.8 per 100,000 residents, in 
199.5. That's down from 1994, when there were 79,897 cases and a rate of 30.2. 
In 1993, the year federal re­searchers expanded their defi­nition of AIDS, there were 105,828 cases. 
Washington, D.C., had the grim distinction of having the highest AIDS rate among U.S. states and territories in 1995. Puerto Rico was a distant sec­ond, followed by New York, Florida and New Jersey. 
The nation's capital had 185.7 AIDS cases per 100,000 resi­dents, down from 246.9 in 1994, when it also led the nation. North Dakota had the lowest AIDS rate, at 0.8. 
The CDC figures confirmed that nationwide, the AIDS rate is declining, but more minorities and women are now its victims. 
Researchers had predicted this trend, anticipating that pre­vention methods and death would slow the rates among gay white men but that the virus would spread among women and minorities. 
Women accounted for 19 per­cent of all AIDS cases among 
• adults and adolescents, their highest proportion yet. 
But in a surprise, AIDS cases among children fell to 800 in 1995, from 1,034 in 1994, even though more women developed

House votes 
to approve 
terrorist bill 
ByCAROLYNSKORNECK 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON 

Congress passed long-await­ed legislation Thursday that would give federal law offieers new powers to use against ter­rorism, sending the bill to President Clinton on the eve of the first anniversary of the Ok­lahoma City bombing. 
The bill -which also would limit federal appeals by prison­ers, including death-row in­mates -was passed by the House 293-133. It had been ap­proved by the Senate a day earlier, 91-8. 
Clinton was expected to sign the measure next week, after he returns from overseas, even though it lacks numerous other law enforeement powers he had sought. 
"Today, Congress took an important step in making our country more safe and secure from the violent cowards who would tear at the fabric of civi­lized order," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said after the vote. 
Attorney General Janet Heno said the legislation contains "some very effective tools that we can use in our efforts to combat terrorism." 
Speeifically, she cited provi­sions that would allow deporta­tion of alien terrorists without disclosing elassil'iml evidence against them, prevent fund raising in the United States for terrorists, and require tag­gants, or chemical labels, in plastic explosives so they can be traced . 
To Hepublican supporters, the bill's key provision is its limit on so-called habeas cor­pus appeals by prisoners, pri­marily because it is expected to end delays in executions. 
The change would tell those considering a terrorist act that they ean no longer "eome into our country and kill our citi­zens, and destroy our govern­ment institutions and know that they will be able to spend the next 25 years laughing at us, thumbing their nose at the families of victims," he said . 
On the other side, Hep. Bar­ney Frank, D-Mass., noted that the only people eligible for such appeals are already incarcerated. "We're not talk­ing about anybody walking around," Frank said. "We're talking about people who are locked up and who are a dan­ger, presumably, only to other prisoners. but eertainly not to general society." 
The bill would create some new federal laws, and new fed­eral death penalties, fur inter­national terrorism eases and for the killing of a federal em­ployee or former mnployee be­cause of that person's work. 
Some prov1stons wer11 dropped at the insistenceof House lawmakers fearful that federal enforcement would intrude on individual liberties.

• I AM Nor A POTTED PLANT 
It all started a few weeks ago when I got sucked into another "female priests" discussion. My friend, imbued with the progressive Catholic faith, ended the dis­cussion by announcing, "Come on, you know it's only a matter of time." 
Charles Roth 
I went to a Theology conference this weekend. and I heard Richard McBrien say almost the same thing. Yes, he said, this pope stands in the way of the spirit of Vatican II, and so will the next. But. he said, "I am optimistic." The good father has faith that the Holy Spirit will guide the Church away from reac­tionary, outmoded practices, and into the glorious light of modernity. 
I confess that statements like these always give me pause. Are traditional­ists, like William Wallace, fighting an unwinnable fight against the tides of his­tory? It's just a matter of time before my bookstore team gets crushed by a ranked team of 6-6 football players; is it simply a matter of time before the Church changes its teachings on women priests, etc.? 
It was in this mode of thinking that I heard of the death of Walter Miller. His story bears repeating. Miller was one of the U.S. Army artillerymen who bombed the heck out of Monte Cassino during World War II (Monte Cassino was found­ed by St. Benedict in the Fifth Century; it was the center and inspiration for Western Monasticism). Miller, who'd never heard of it, was shocked by the outcry at the monastery's destruction. He started reading about the monks, and their role in preserving knowledge through the Middle Ages. His research eventually led him to convert to Catholicism. 
At this point, he wrote, "A.Canticle For Leibowitz," a thoroughly Catholic novel set in an age suffering from the after­effects of nuclear destruction. Miller could imagine a Catholic Church which survived unchanged, amidst the ebb and flow of time. It taught the same creed, spoke the same language, and still awaited the same Second Coming, as it had forever. It's one of the best novels I have ever read, along with The Brothers Karamazov, Kristen Lavransdatter, and Lancelot (start your summer reading list now!). 
Walter Miller lost his faith in the after­math of Vatican II. He became a Zen Buddhist, and never wrote another book. He died by committing suicide. 
A sadder story can hardly be imag­ined. He had such a glorious faith, so tri­umphant, so proud -Saecula saeculo­rum -"through ages of ages." And then along came a Church Council, and he lost his faith. 
Walter Miller can and must answer for himself, to a just and loving God. He should have seen that Vatican II made no changes to the deposit·of faith, he should have known that under the guid­ance of the Spirit the doctrine of the Church can never change. Uncomfortable new changes to the Church were no cause for him to lose faith. He should have turned to God in his doubts, he should have persevered. May God have mercy on his soul. 
But may God have mercy on us, if we fall prey, in reverse, to his doubts! Walter Miller left the Church because he thought it changed, when it had promised not to. Richard McBrien is mad at the Church because he thinks it promised to change, and hasn't followed through. There are so many like him, mad at the Church for not changing to suit their understanding of what it means to value men and women equally. They think that the vibrancy, the dynamism of Catholicism lies in CHANGE, in new ideas. 
What is there to say? I heard yester­day of a German justice (on the equiva­lent of our Supreme Court), who is a good liberal Catholic, etc. He was the moving force behind a 1994 constitu­tional decision which would require all the schools in Germany to remove cruci­fixes from classroom walls, where they have been for hundreds of years. I just want to shake the guy by the shoulders, and say, look at what you're doing! In the name of comfort, you're pulling Christ out of schools, out of countless people's lives. There's a reason those symbols have been on walls for these centuries! 
Of course, to every error there is an equal and opposite error. There are those who glorify the past overly much, worshiping whatever is "classical" and reverencing whichever books smell musty and fall apart in your hands. We must use our critical faculties to analyze that which is handed down from "men of old." 
The tough part, in the Catholic con­text, is differentiating between that which comes from men, and that which comes from God. Great care is required before old Church traditions are dis­carded. 
Since this is my last Observer column, I want to pull this back to NO. In my years here, I have been frustrated many times by McBrienesque disdain for Church tradition. In many arguments on these subjects, I have felt as if I was slamming my head into a brick wall. I wish I didn't enjoy that give and take as much as I do, but there it is. I have enjoyed every minute of my time here (weather aside). 
Notre Dame Catholicism may some­times be critical, but it is not dead. And as Billy Crystal pointed out in The Princess Bride, if something is only mostly dead, there's still hope.

• lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Rape survivor relates victory over fear and shame 
Dear Editor: 
To everyone -male and female, 
Hape... it's every woman's nightmare and unfortu­nately, too many women's reality. Hape is something talked about in hushed tones or in careful circles. Hape is something that angers us without even touch­ing us. It angers us so much that we too often have to ereate myths about it in order to make sense of it all. It lives behind a curtain of ambiguity. 
Unfortunately, as many of us know, rape is a very clear and very real experience for many of us -men and women. I am one of those who knows the reality of its anger. and the pain of its shame and senseless­niJSs. .Just a little over a year ago, I myself became a victim of this crime. I do not need to tell the story of the rape itself, for I no longer consider that the impor­tancn of my story. Instead. I want to tell of my sur­vival. 
After being raped by an aequaintance in an off-cam­pus apartment, I walked home to Farley hall where I had been living that spring. I was in a complete state of shock. My rector, Sr. Carrine Etheridge greeted me when I walked into the dorm and sensed that some­thing was wrong. When she asked me, I started to hn1ak down. I told her in broken and frantic words only what I felt I could at the time -"I told him no ... I told him no. I didn't want to." 
Knowing full well from these babbling words what must have happened, Sr. C asked if I wanted to go to the hospital. I eventually went to the emergency room that morning. accompanied by Sr. C and one of my roommates. I was met at the door of the E.R. by a rep­resentative of Sexual Offense Services (S.O.S.), who served as my advocate and emotional support during much of the unpleasant experience of the hospital. Less than seven hours after the crime, through my advocatn. I was bning told that it was not my fault and that I should absolutely not blame myself. 
I have never been one for secrecy or embarrassment, and so I did not hide this event from my friends and family. During the following weekend, my friends shel­tered me with more emotional support and comfort than I thought humanly possible. My parents, who I informed three days later. immediately came to school to be with me. 
I wish I could say that the love and support I received wiped away any pain that I had suffered, but that would be living a dream. In the months following the rape, I had to deal with fear of being alone, night­mares, depression. thoughts of suicide, and more. Normally a very talkative person in class, I lost my voice. I didn't go out again until the last week of school, and even then it was only for one night. I underwent a complete change in life-style and attitude. My world had been turned upside down because some­one had wrongly taken a part of me that was not his to have. 
Many of those people close to me encouraged me to get involved in counseling or in a support group. I wanted to be ready before starting such a task, but partly to appease my nagging mother. I went ahead and started meeting with a counselor at Madison Center (through S.O.S.). I also started meeting in a support group that existed on campus at the time. These two sources of learning and coping started a whole new phase for me in approaching the rape. I became determined to make my experience something which I controlled and which didn't control me. I was not only being told that the rape was not my fault, but I began to know that the rape was not my fault. Slowly. I began seeing myself in the way my therapist and sup­port group wanted me to see myself: as a survivor, not a victim. This change in self-concept was the most important step for me to take in the process of reclaim­ing my life. 
For the sake of brevity, I have not included many important elements to my story which I feel are also important in my ability to be where I am today. I do not wish to give the impression that it was easy. for it was the hardest thing I've ever had to experience. But the unending and amazing support I received from my friends and family amaze me to this day, and I have never regretted telling them. Nor do I regret telling you now, and giving you my name. I am not ashamed of the fact that I am a survivor of rape. I do not wish to hide behind a curtain of ambiguity, just as I do not think the crime itself should be allowed to hide behind that curtain. I feel very strongly for all other survivors, both those who have shared their experience with oth­ers and those who live in silence. I can only encourage you to talk to someone and start to see yourself as a survivor and not a victim. Be proud that you are alive. Be proud that you arc a woman (or man). Be free from the pain and shame that someone wrongly forced upon you. 
We should not have to live lives of secrecy and shame. The only reason why I hold myself back from telling someone now is for fear of their comfort level. Honestly speaking, most people don't know what to say when someone tells them of being raped. I do not believe in living in shamefulness because of something which someone else did to me. I suffered, and I sur­vived. It is possible, and I hope for every person who experiences the reality of rape that they also can win back their life. Rape doesn't have to end as a tragedy. .. it can also be a victory. 
KATIE LEHNER Senior Off-Campus 

Intimidation and pain should not cloud intentions ofthe heart 
I renwniher when an honor was some­thing important and respected. In high school, I seemed to accumulate honors ev11ry time they were handed out. I was an honor student, which meant I took honor dasses. I earned Headmastp,r's llonors in all my subjects and my grades earned m11 a pla1~e on the Honor Hull. In cxtracurrkulars, athletes earned Player of the Week honors, and I even saved tlw rwwspaper which printed my name as All City First Team llonorable M!Jntion. All these honors meant great things had been accomplished, and great pride should he associated with tlwm. Eventually. I tallied up all my honors. liswd thnm on an application. and gainml acceptance to a competitive university. But then the honors sep,med to stop. 
The reeognitions are still available, by many otlwr honor laden students com­PI~t~~ for much fewer meritorious distinc­tions. Aeademie honors seem nearly unattainable. and most can only day­dmam about earning even the opportu­nity to compete as a Varsity Athlete. No. llonors an~ few and far between here at Notre Dame. mserved only for the best of the best, and seldom accumulate. Something definitely sets those who reeeiv(~ honors here far apart from the rest in a very substantial way. And yet. it was with mixed emotions that I received my first honor here at Notre Dame. 
The ceremony took place in my own dorm, in the privacy of my own room. The whole thing occurred so fast, I nevp,r even got a chance to make a brief embarrassed acceptance speech. At first. I was just talking with a friend. We were making plans for the upcoming weekend. when she told me about a party. We both knew the host of the evr.nt. and I bngan to ask what time we should plan on arriving when I heard her say. "Well, its actually a black folk party but you're an honorary. so it'll be all right." And that was it. My first honor. It was over and done with in an instant. In fact, I might have even for­gotten about it had I not been congratu­lated repeatedly ever since. Later on that same evening, I was introduced to others and my achievement made known with the explanation, "she's just white on the outside." I began to be referred to by the dignified terms of "reverse oreo" and "white chocolate." The accolades kept piling on, so fast I could scarcely keep up with them. It 
o;••••mr>rl I hnrl rnntinnr>rl mv nr<>vinn<: 
how my new achievement made me more confused and hurt than proud. I wasn't sure how I felt when I was described as "trapped in the body of a white girl," particularly because those who presented the honors. seemed so excited and proud to bestow them on me. Ilow does one refuse an honor without offending? And would refusing also be interpreted as a refusal of friendship? It seemed that each non­white friend I had felt compelled to honor me by denying my racial identity. 
My dilemma significantly worsened when I realized my honors were not only a dubious nature in my own mind, but were even ignored and sometimes condemned by others. I was in my own dorm with a group of friends and we were discussing race relations on cam­pus. Specifically. the topic was minority students' reactions of anger and frustra­tion to real or perceived manifestations of the ideology of racial supremacy. I suggested to the group that if any one of us had suffered as many minorities have suffered in this country for hundreds of years, we would react to various inci­dents with exasperation and hostility as well. I was trying to present the issue from a different perspective, but my thought met with abrupt dismissal as biased excuses. I began to defend my position, but was shortly silenced by one statement. Uttered plainly and simply, it sent my reeling, nauseous, and out of breath: "Well, they sold themselves into slavery, you know." 
I remember being speechless for a suspended length of time. I remember leaving the room, and walking outside, then leaning against a tree while I tried to regain myself. It was the tone of dis­respect for my opinion which hurt and the ignorance which shocked me. All wrapped up in that one exclamation were so many messages: "What do you know, you're practically one of them anyway" "Its not my fault that other people have to suffer" "People bring these things on themselves" "Its not my problem" "Who are you to defend these people? They're not your kind" But these hidden meanings could all be summed up in one word of that one sen­tence: THEY. For a long time, all I could think was THEY THEM US WE THEY. Who were they? Them? And what was I? I am an honorary. So am I Us or Them? Do I have to be both? Does there have to be both? Why is there both in the first place? They them 
w<> "" th<>v THJ;"V w<>r<> mv fri<>nrlc: 
on the other and to them we are not us, but we are nothing but them and they are us. So if WE are THEM and THEY are US, then where does that leave me? 
I went to see another friend; a friend whose skin color happened to be differ­ent from mine. And I told her what hap­pened. The sentence. "They sold them­selves into slavery, you know." And she looked at me and recounted a similar experience within our own dorm. An instance where she had been separated, divided, excluded out, and made to feel that she was not and never could be anything by different. But I don't remember much of the details of what she said or who was involved or the events she described. No, what I remember most was what she said first. Before she told me the feelings in her heart. before she could build the bond of trust over which we could share human emotions, before she even began to tell the background information for her story, she looked at me and she said, "Well. you're an honorary so I can tell you." An honorary. I have the honor of being both what I am and what I am not at the same time while being neither to anyone. Wl'!at does my status as an honorary mean? It means to some that I can be trusted. I'm okay. I'm not a smiling hypocrite who will explain that ''I'm not racist, I have black friends ... " I won't complain in corners that one table in the dining hall is always so loud. And I won't ask people I have never met what sport they play. But it means more than that. Because for to me to be trust­ed. okay, and all these other intangible things, I have to tangibly NOT be one thing above all others: white. 
But what if I am white? What if I'm from a small private high school in the midwest and my daddy's a doctor and my brother's on the Irish Guard and I'm the prototype of the average upper mid­dle class white student which makes up the majority of the Notre Dame student population? What then? 
When two non-equal things are joined by an equal sign, only one alternative exists. White=Friend cannot remain. And so, with a small adjustment, a mathematical miracle is attained. The equality is changed and made logical, universal, and good. My definitive equa­tion because Honorary Non­White=Friend. Voila. 
And that's when I looked at my honor and was wrenched with pain. What kind of honor was this anyway? I have 
ff\ fll>nV who f "m in f\rfll>r fn I>Yi<:t? f Am 
tidy little honor, all is corrected and life can go on with white and non-white coexisting peacefully, calling each other us and them interchangeably, everlast­ingly. And I will live as an ethnic chameleon changing according to the color of my surroundings; existing as the hapless anomaly with a ribbon of honor and a badge of shame. 
Is the mistrust ingrained so deeply that my honest sincerity cannot be accepted without altering my ethnic identity? I firmly believe that "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice every­where." Do I have to be a member of the oppressed to earn credibility as an enemy of oppression? And what of the divisions of US and THEM? What can be accomplished from that type of think­ing? As long as there is an US there will always be a THEM and one or the other will end up on the bottom. WE need to work these things out together. But if one of US establishes a friendship with one of THEM and those two together do not make ALL, but rather an US and HONOHARY US who is PRACTICALLY ONE OF THEM. then those divisions still exist and separate but unequal will eter­nally prevail. 
I can understand and empathize with the pain that minority students endure on a campus which makes them feel unwelcome in so many subtle and cre­ative ways. I also can accept the per­spective of white students who feel intimidated by the closeness of the minority community on campus and are susceptible to noticing the differences between various American cultures and not the similarities. I would like to ask all Notre Dame students, however, to remember that we are part of a greater whole. In this sermon "Loving Your Enemies," Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. closed his plea for a caring human com­munity with a hymn in which he sang: 
In Christ there is no East or West 
In Him no North or South 
But one great fellowship ofLove 
Throughout the whole wide earth. 
We as members of the Notre Dame community, founded on Christian princi­ples of unconditional love, mercy. and forgiveness. must carry forth Dr. King's message to make every word and deed contribute to an understanding. And then I too will look forward to the day that my friendship can be judged not by the color of my skin, but by the honor­able intentions of my heart.

Michiana Tattoo Emporium 
116 South 11th Street Niles, Michigan (616) 683-3383 
The Emporium is a member of the Alliance of Professional Tattooists. It has the most combined experience of any tattoo parlor in Michiana. Five tattooists work out of this shop, all of whom have won various awards and have over forty years of experience. Owner Rockin' Robin is a member of the prestigious National Tattoo Association. To become a m~;~mber of this group you must be appointed by a cur­rent member. R. T., the manager, does both tattooing and body piercing. Shades, one of the tattooists, has been tattooing for seven years and did his apprenticeship in Texas. He has worked at two other tattoo parlors and owned his own shop before coming to the Emporium. He has won best of show awards for tattoos of all sizes in shows at Niles' Main Event Sports Bar and Kicker Sports Bar. Jewel has won third place at the natioflal show, the Easy Riders National Tattoo Convention. Jill also has won awards and worked at various shops. The Emporium has been open for four years. All artists charge the same price for tat­toos-a shop set price starting at $40-that takes into account placement, time, dif­ficulty and size of the tattoo. Most importantly, new needles are used for every customer. Although there are few laws regulating tattooing, and none regarding needle usage, the Emporium feels that reusing needles "is not an option." According to Shades there is no shape, design or color that they cannot do: "If you can draw it we can tattoo it." 
Hamlett's Grateful Tattoo Company 
1223 Pipestone Road Benton Harbor, Michigan (616) 927-1432 
Certified as a Master of Tattooing at the 1984 Houston Tattoo Expo. This shop's clientele has won various prizes for tattoos done at Hamlett's. Call for an appoint­

In the Eye of the Armadillo 
908 F South Centerville Sturgis, Michigan (616) 651-9340 
This shop is run and owned by Todd Spahr. He is the only tattooist that works in this shop although he does have an apprentice named Mike Sloan. Mike has been apprenticed for nine months and will probably have to remain in this position for a few more years. Mike has yet to use a tattoo gun but gets all of Todd's designs ready and takes care of most of the preparations. The shop .has been open for 15 years and was previously located in Three Rivers, Michigan. Todd worked for the previous owner, but bought the shop three years ago and moved it to Sturgis. Todd has been tattooing for six years. Although he has never won any awards (because he hasn't entered any pieces), he is a member of the National Tattoo Association. Prices start at $40 and go up according to size, difficulty and place­ment of tattoo. You should call to make an appointment, although walk-ins are accepted if time is available. The Armadillo also uses a new needle for every tat­too, although Michigan state law does not require this. As Todd said, "A needle will touch skin only once. Once itis used, it is dead." Body piercing is also available. 
YOU'nique Image 
2228 Mishawaka Avenue Mishawaka, Indiana 232-2228 
This is not really a tattoo parlor but rather a place to get permanent cosmetic make­up. But it really is the closest thing to a tattoo parlor on the Indiana side of the Michigan state line. Indiana has strict regulations to prevent tattoos; for example to professionally give tattoos one must be a licensed physician. Work at YOU'nique is done by a board-certified technician, Kathy Michael. Work that can be done is eyebrows, eyeliner, lipliner, full lip color, lash and brow tints, and skin camouflage and repigmentation. One can also go to YOU'nique for waxing and for a full ser­vice beauty and tanning salon.

''M 
"Mother" tattooed inside of it. 
Being the levelheaded mom that Marge is, she decided that this wasn't the best idea for a 10 year-old boy. When she discovered Bart in the tattoo parlor she stormed in and pulled him out before the beautiful etching could be complet­ed on his arm. 
Bart ended up with a tattoo on his arm proclaiming a love for ~------.•• small, winged insects; but not for very long as Marge was forced to use the family's Christmas money for the laser surgery to have it removed. 
Television (and all people for that matter) are intrigued with tattoos. On a "Friends" episode a few weeks ago Rachel got a tattoo on her hip. 
As a small child, I remember watching an episode of "Bosom Buddies" in which Tom Hanks' character decided that in order to impress his girlfriend he was going to get a tattoo. He showed up at the tattoo parlor (if I remember correctly) a little drunk and sat in the chair for his branding. The tattooing gun was put against his skin and turned on. Needless to say the pain was too great for him and the show ended with his girlfriend making some remark along the lines of "Where did this blue freckle come from?" 
I think it was probably at that point that the idea of a get­ting a tattoo of my own first entered my head. Years before when my sister had gotten her ears pierced, I begged my mom to let me do the same. She put that off nicely by telling me I could when I was my sister's age. By the time I was my sister's age I had completely forgotten about the ear pierc­ing. Yet, after seeing this show I suddenly thought "Maybe tattoos are for boys, and earrings are for girls?" 
I proved myself wrong on that point a few years later when, in the sixth grade, I was the first boy at my school to get my ear pierced. Lordy, did that ever cause a ruckus. Anyway, I decided that if my sister was going to get to have her ears pierced, I was going to get a tattoo. No need to repeat the parents'

Schmiedt, Moretti expand horizons at Oxford 
By BRIAN REINTHALER Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame track and field pro­gram hopes that their performances in the April rain this past weekend will bring May flowers at the Big East Championships to be held over the first weekend of next month. 
The Irish battled inclement weather at the Miami (OH) Invitational and record­ed some impressive results at the meet. 
"We were pretty happy with our per­formances at Miami," said junior pole­vaulter David Gerrity, whose own event ning events were concerned, senior Jeff Hojnacki and sophomore Errol Williams delivered solid times in the middle dis­tance and hurdles races, respectively. 
Hojnacki took first place in the 1500 meters with a time of 3:51:22 and cap­tured second in the 800 (1:54.39), fol­lowed by teammate Pat Gorman, who crossed the finish line in 1:54.74. Williams edged out Ball State's Gordon Drijver for first in the 110-meter hurdles with a time of 14.51. He complemented that finish by taking eleventh in the 400 hurdles. 
Sophomore Scott Grace and senior 
Capturing firsts in the field were Chris Smith in the javelin (54.56 meters) and senior Lamarr Justice in the triple jump 
(15.10 meters). Justice also took fourth in the long jump with a leap of 6.90 me­ters. Freshman Chris Schargen, com­peting in his first ever collegiate decathlon finished in the top six despite only competing in some of the ten events. The Irish will look to Schargen for a strong effort in the Big East Championships. Senior Todd Johnston took second in the high jump (1. 93). 
The star of the meet for the women was freshman Nadia Schmiedt. The hurdles, the freshman crossed the finish line in 61.82 to win the race. 
"I would have liked to run a better time (in the 400)," explained Schmiedt, "but considering the windy, cold condi­tions, I'm happy enough with the time." 
Also winning their events were seniors Kristen Dudas and Amy Siegel, and sophomore Berit Junker. Dudas took the 5000 meters with a time of 17:35.81, while Siegel ran a time of 10:01.44 to capture the 3000 and Junker finished in 
2:11.92 to win the 800. Alison Howard continued to put up solid performances, taking second in the 400 with a run of

Belles charge toward regional tourney 
Tough road ahead 
By LORI GADDIS Sports Writer 
If it's not one thing, it's an­other. The Saint Mary's softball team has been deal­ing with a roller coaster schedule, having many games rescheduled due to wet field conditions as well as surprise snow showers in April. That will all be reme­died this weekend as the Belles prepare for six games in two days, four of which are rescheduled games from early in the season. 
The Belles have been tak­ing advantage of the warmer weather this week after rain hit the Saint Mary's field, leaving them unable to play their game against achieved one of their season goals of going to the Tournament. Though they are not ranked in the top eight con­tenders, Cromer is pleased with SMC's season thus far. 
"We're seeded eleventh, and third in our bracket," Cromer said. "We're closer to the top eight, which is where we need to be. We want to take it one match at a time. I feel confi­dent going against the teams in our bracket." 
Saint Mary's gained some of that confidence in Tuesday's match against DePauw. Although DePauw won 7-2, Cromer said that the score gave no indication of her team's level of play. 
Specifically Cromer cited Kozacik's match against DePauw's No. 1 singles Katy Lowe as evidence of that fact. Kozacik took the National con­tender three sets 7-6, 6-1, 6-0 in a match that lasted nearly three hours. 
"We did really well," Cromer said. "I would have liked to have scored one more point, but I was happy." 
Underwood said that the Belles' match against DePauw will be a motivational factor this weekend at Madison. 
"We played well at DePauw," Underwood said. "We set up our points and we were moving well, but closing out points was difficult for us. 
Nothing seemed to go our way; it was frustrating. Maybe we can use some of our frustra­tion against BetheL" 
According to Kozacik, the combination of the team's strengths and their draw in the Tournament, the Belles should place high this weekend.

By STEPHANIE BUEK Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
For the fourth consecutive year, the Saint Mary's College tennis team is going to the prestigious Midwest Invitational Tournament. 
Seeded eleventh in a field of 16 and No. 3 of eight in their bracket, the Belles left yester­day for the weekend tourna­ment in Madison, Wis. 
According to Head Coach Katie Cromer, SMC has the op­portunity to face familiar foes in their bracket. If the team can get past their first round draw of Minnesota's Bethel College, they then take on the winner of the Coe College ­University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire match. 
In early season play at the Hilton Head tournament, Eau Claire beat an injury-plagued SMC squad in a tight 5-4 
However, Cromer and the Belles are focusing on one match at a time, particularly their first match against Bethel. Junior co-captain Anne Underwood, No. 5 singles, said that the team has struggled with slow starts in tournament play throughout the season. 
"We've really been focusing on that first match," Underwood said. "From there we get more excited and more motivated to win." 

Junior Kate Kozacik, No. 1 singles, agreed. 
"Eau Claire was a close match," Kozacik said. "We lost one match in three sets, and two others were really close. But. we're trying not to look ahead of the first round. Even in play at Hilton Head, we started out slow. " 
."We're trying to have a more optimistic attitude that we're the ones who are supposed to

Scholl's slam ignites Irish assault on Valpo 
By T. RYAN KENNEDY Spons Writer 
On a calm, 60-degree evening in South Bend, with a strong breeze blowing out to left field, Notre Dame home­red three times and shelled Valparaiso 11-3. It was a game of unsung heroes from the start, as spot starter and . 200 hitter Justin Scholl past­ed a grand slam in the first inning for a 4-0 Notre Dame lead. The Irish never looked back, scoring eight runs in the first three innings. 
"It feels good," said a beam­ing Scholl after the game. "I don't have the opportunity a lot, so it's nice to get up and help the team any way I can. He was throwing sliders but on the 3-2 I caught a fastball." 
The Irish literally walked to victory from the outset. Leadoff hitter Randall Brooks took the free pass, followed by Scott Sollmann and Mike Amrhein. But with no outs, Jeff Wagner whiffed and George Restovich popped to the pitcher. Notre Dame was squandering a prime chance. Then, with his back to the wall on a 3-2 count, Scholl belted a fastball for his fourth career homer. 
Scholl, however, was only the first of four Irish players to emerge from the shadows of the dugout. Freshman Chris McKeown pitched five and one-third innings with six strikeouts for his first win

ever. 
Pat Davis, who has been phenomenal of late, came on in the sixth and fanned the first two batters he faced in relief. The next inning, Davis struck out two more Valpo batters and to retire five straight players. 
On the year, Davis has 12 strikeouts in eight appear­ances and a 3-to-1 strikeout­walk ratio. 
Finally, Christian Parker, with a 5-1 record, performed some woodwork of his own against the Crusaders. Pinch hitting in the eighth with Notre Dame up 10-3, Parker added an insurance run with his first dinger of the year to right field. 
The last two games have been monumental for the con­fidence of the Notre Dame team. The Irish (29-1 0 over­all, 6-4 Big East) are 25-5 in their last 30 games but have often played lackluster base­ball against less than stellar opponents. 
Notre Dame will play three crucial games this weekend at Georgetown and Mainieri is hungry for a Big East title. The Irish are presently four games behind Villanova (16­11, 12-2) in the National Division. "These Big East games are huge," emphasized Mainieri. "We have a shot at winning the division and I think we can. We have 10 Big East games left and I believe we're going to win them all."

Irish face top, bottom of division 
By WILLY BAUER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's two softball op­ponents this weekend are on the opposite ends of the spec­trum. On one side is the peren­nial Big East power and loser of o~ly one game, the Connecticut Huskies. On the other, is Big East doormat, St. John's, on the bottom of the North Division. 
The Irish enter this Saturday's match-up with an 11-1 record, complemented by the Huskies 15-1 record. 
The Irish lineup is somewhat depleted by injuries, as star pitcher Terri Kobata and sec­ond baseman Andrea Kollar might or will not play this weekend. 
Kollar is out for one week, after being hit in the face dur­ing practice. Coach Liz Miller is more optimistic about Kobata's prognosis, 
"I feel that the only thing we're tentative about is that we'd like to have Terri healthy," said Miller. "We'd like to have her for this week­end, but our other three pitch­ers have been doing a great job. They can handle UConn." 
Miller's assessment about her pitchers seems to hold water, especially after last weekend's performance. 
Junior Joy Battersby collected two wins against Villanova last weekend, including a near­flawless one-hitter on Sunday. Freshman Angela Bessolo has pitched strong for the Irish as both a starter and a reliever. 
Last week's theme for the of­fense was; start off cool but end

up hot. Against Ohio State and Villanova, the Irish were 2-1 in its opener's of the doublehead­ers, with the two victories com­ing with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. However, in the night cap, the Irish pounded out 10-plus runs in two of the. games ... not an offensive short­age there. 
The offensive headliners were center fielder Jennifer Giampaolo, shortstop Meghan Murray and first baseman Kelly Rowe . 
Rowe scored the winning runs in last week's close victories, Giampaolo had one of the top batting averages for the week­end and Murray blasted a home run in the winning effort against Villanova, Saturday. 
"The rest of our players are ready to battle," said a confi­dent Miller. 
"Our bats have been the key. As long as we are attacking, we can do well." 
In the Big East, Connecticut has simply dominated. Since the league's inception in 1990, the Huskies have made the title game every year. They have won five of those championship games. 
This recent success does not phase Miller. "They are a good team," praised Miller. "But they're not 
any better than what we've faced this year. We've faced better teams. The biggest key is to play loose and aggressive and too have fun. As soon as we start to think about the game, we start messing up on the field." 
On the undercard, is St. John's on Sunday. The Red Storm have been on the bottom of the Big East's North division all season. Catcher Madeline Sandoval is St. John's big bat, coming off a second team Big East season last year. 
Since the Red Storm does not travel from its East Coast base, Miller has not been able to scout the seemingly less than formidable team, unlike Connecticut where the Irish coaches have been able to pick out weaknesses. 
"This is the first time I have ever seen their program," com­mented Miller. 
"I feel, because of our early season competition, we have faced stronger teams than the ones coming in this weekend. Our goal is to win all four." 
With the recent Irish success, 19 game winning streak for example, sweeping this week­end's four games is not out of the question. Actually, it is very much a distinct possibility.

SPLIT END

Receivers 
continued from page 28 
God that recruits Raki Nelson and Deke Cooper are worthy enough to hold Mayes' jockstrap, the Irish coaching staff offers a simpler solution. 
"The guys we got here will get the job done," said new receivers coach Urban Meyer. "While the group is thin and short on experience, there is a lot of tal­ent here. It just has to be developed a little more between now and September." 
The talent Meyer is referring to includes junior Emmett Mosely, junior Cikai Champion, sophomore Malcolm Johnson, and freshman Bobby Brown. Of the quartet, Mosely, who ranked third on the Irish with 17 catches in 1995, is the only name recognized by most Notre Dame fans. 
"He's got experience, and he's a good influence on some of the younger guys," said Meyer. "He's been consistent in spring drills, and we know we can count on him to make the big catch once the season starts." 
Although best remembered for his five touchdowns against Navy in 1994, the 5­foot-9, 180 pound Mosely was a terror on special teams last season, averaging 
27.9 yards per kickoff return and 14.5 yards on punt returns. 
''I'm happy to have a bigger role next season, and I'm glad the coaches have that kind of confidence in me," said Mosely. 
"I think that the receivers here are a lot better than people are giving them credit for, and I think you'II see that next year." 
While Mosely seems to have one of the starting positions locked up, it's any­one's guess as to who will start on the other side. As of now, the seldom used Champion is working out with his room­mate Mosely on the first team. 
"He (Champion) has improved a lot from what I've seen on the films and just since the first day of practice," said Meyer. 
"Champion, Johnson, and Brown haven't played much, but they are hard working guys, and I expect them all to contribute next year." 
The 6-foot-4, 206 pound Johnson has the size to take advantage of smaller defensive backs, while Meyer believes the 6-foot-3, 175 pound Brown is the fastest straight ahead runner at the position. 
"The entire group has improved so much just from day one," said Johnson. 
"The guys here are going to surp some people next season. The w ethic is good, and there's a lot of and speed at our position." 
To add to the mix, punter Hunte Smith has been working out with receivers and played the position in school less than two years a Quarterback Jarious Jackson is

QB Berringer dies in plane crash 
By JEFF ZELENY 
As!>Oeiatcd Press 
RAYMOND, Neb. 
Brook Berringer, the backup quarterback who helped Nebraska win the 1994 na­tional title, was killed Thursday when the small plane he was piloting crashed in a farm field. 
Plane owner Harry Barr said the other person killed in the two-seater was Toby Lake, the brother of Berringer's girlfriend. 
Berringer. 22, who was ex· pfH:ted to be selected in the NFL draft this weekend, held a pilot's license and often new the plane, Barr said. Berringer had often said he wanted to be a commercial airline pilot. 
The 50-year-old plane struggled to a height of 250 flltlt before crashing into the alfalfa field near this east-cen­tral Nllbraska village minutes after takeoff from a grass airstrip. 
"We could tell it was going slow," said Jim Jeffers. who lives about a mile from the crash site 11 miles northwest of Lincoln. "After takeoff. when the wing dropped, I knew it was going to hit the 
ground." 
Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner said the bodies wertl removed from the crash site about 6:25 p.m. and were taken to a Lincoln hospital.

records would be used to offi· cially identify the badly charred bodies. 
The plane, which Barr has owned for about 15 years, crashed about one-eighth of a mile from the airstrip. 
Wagner said he was told the plane took off, then began to shake. He said the left wing dropped as the plane attempt· ed to turn around and strong winds slammed the plane into the ground, where it burst into names. 
The National Weather Service said northwesterly winds were gusting to about 30 mph on the ground. 
Wagner said the pilot did not issue a distress call before the 2:30 p.m. crash. Berringer was not required to file a flight plan. and air traffic con­trollers weren't following the flight. Small, private aircraft do not have to file flight plans. 
Berringer was 7-0 as a starter during the 1994 sea­son when Tommie Frazier was sidelined with blood clots in his leg. Berringer and Frazier both played in the Orange Bowl against Miami, but it was Frazier who led the Cornhuskers to a 24-17 come· back victory in the fourth quarter. 
Berringer of Goodland, Kan., played sparingly behind Frazier last season when Nebraska won its second straight national title with a 62-24 rout of Florida in the Fiesta Bowl.

James: 'Model' of excellence 
By TIM SEYMOUR As.ociatc Sports Editor 
The mantle of 'ullimate Bookstom player' is not passed lighlly. 
In past years. Eric Jones of THquila WhitH Lightning, Joe llaigh of NIH, and Jayson Williams of Models lne. have all t~arnml aeeolades for knowing what it takes to win the world's largest basketball tournament. 
A worthy, if unwilling, sueees­sor is senior Conrad James, the key ingrt~dinnt for defnnding champion Modt~ls Inc. II. 
Sitting in his Stanford llall dorm room. appearances sug­gnst that 'hookworm' lits James morn easily than 'baskntball star.' But under the intense glare of thn Bookston~ spotlight, James has proven himself one of the most feared players on Llw asphalt. 
''I'm one of the most competi­Live pt~ople I know," says James. "I hate to lose. and thosn who see how angry I get on the court probably don't know that I'm easy-going and quint ofT it." 
James' eompetilivcness mani­fests itself in his multi-dimen­sional game. Once known pri­marily as a leaper with little ftH~I for basketball's intricacies. James has transformed himself into a versatile player danger­ous from either the wing or the paint on both ends of the floor. 
A rail-thin 6-5, James has addnd dnceplive strength to 
complement his athleticism, preventing him from being pushed around under the hoards, as was once the case. 
"I've gotten a lot stronger sinec freshman year." he ex­plains. "I never lifted weights in high sehool. but my room­mates started me lifting, and that coupled with playing more has improved my game." 
The results are his oppo­rwnts' bane. James was the leading seorer and rebounder on Stanford's interhall champi­on 'A' team, devastating oppo­nents with a virtually un-de­fendable turnaround jumper. 
"There's no question that Conrad was the MVP of inter­hall," states Stanford captain Travis Brown, a guard for No. 4 Showtimc. "Everyone knows about his scoring and rebound­ing, but his real strength is his ability to control the lane like no one else." 
James' talents have garnered him success in the Bookstore arena as well. As a member of Ebony Side of the Dome his first two years, James led the squad to appearanees in the Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen. And of course there is last year's run to the title with Models. 
But despite the victories, James' accomplishments as a player have been somewhat overshadowed by the larger is­sues at-stake in his games.

campus, and James, playing on all-black squads, has been in­volved in some of the most charged games -from the per­spective of both fans and eom­petitors -in recent years. 
Models was greeted with derision from the fans through­out much of last year's tourney, and were in fact booed soundly as they made their way from Flanner to the championship game. 
However, James, a Summa Cum Laude engineering student who will be pursuing graduate studies in the fall, does not hack away from one of the least discussed issues on campus. 
"There is a lot of racial ten­sion on this campus, and last year was one example," he notes. "We use the tensions to play better, though. Nothing pumps me up more than being booed by the crowd." 
James points to misunder­standing as the primary reason a simple basketball game be­comes the site for raeial hostili­ties. 
"I think the majority of cam­pus sees the black teams as very vocal, confident, and ag­gressive," he explains. "What people don't understand is that black people are very demon­strative in their emotions. Emotions stem from mental toughness, and in the envi­ronments that many black peo­ple come from, we have to be mentally tough." 
Beyond being his team's best defender and go-to player, then, James has also been forced to act as both role model

and peacemaker. 
He openly is proud of "repre­senting the black community that is under-represented on campus," but he also has served as a liaison during some of Bookstore's most unpleasant moments. 
In a heated game his sopho­more year, James was forced to intervene when tensions flared between his teammate Oliver Gibson of Ebony and the Ziolkowski twins, Brian and Keith, of C.C.E. 
Following the game, James succeeded in quelling any bad blood between the two teams by calling the Ziolkowski's to apologize for the incident, an

indication that in James' esti­mation, basketball should be a unifying factor, not a divisive one. 
"There is a great atmosphere to the tournament that nothing compares to, between the hype surrounding the seeds being announced to the scouting of opponents," said James. "It's great to watch all the people you play with all year compete in a tournament atmosphere." 
For James, the hope is that come next Sunday, the tour­nament's ultimate display of atmosphere, the championship game, will again be a showcase for his talents.

this weekend to face their old nemesis North Carolina. It will mark the first meeting between the two teams since the Irish defeated the Tar Heels 1-0 last December in the national semi­finals on their way to the NCAA crown. 
In past years, the Lightning Soccer Club, based in Atlanta, has brought the NCAA Division I champ together to play the NAIA winner. When the club approached Petrucelli about this year's match, he proposed an alternative. 
"I suggested that we play Carolina in order to meet the best team we could," Petrucelli said. "They (Lightning Club) were receptive and from a mar­keting standpoint, it made sense." 
Along with the women's game, Wisconsin will also play Clemson on the men's side, but this year, that game will not be the feature. 
"Notre Dame-North Carolina is a game people are always trying to get," Petrucelli added. 
While it is a spring game, there's no denying the heated rivalry that exists between the two teams. 
"A spring game never has the seriousness of a regular season contest, but they're human and they're going to remember what happened against Notre Dame," North Carolina head coach Anson Dorrance said. 
What happened was the Irish halted Carolina's string of nine straight national champi­onships, holding the Tar Heels scoreless with a superior de­fensive effort. Naturally, re­demption may be a factor. 
"I wouldn't be surprised if they have that mentality going in," Irish co-captain Jen Henola said. "However, this game ba­sically has no bearing on us." 
''I'm not sure if they'll be looking for revenge," senior Michelle McCarthy said. "I guess if we had played them last year after having lost to them, the thought would prob­ably be in my mind, but there's not the pressure of the season there." 
The game, however, will not even remotely resemble the contest in December. North Carolina will be playing without the heart of their team. Staci Wilson, Debbie Keller, Cindy Parlow, and Tiffany Hoberts are currently training in Florida for a spot on the Olympic team and will not be in attendance on Saturday. 
The Tar Heels could also be without the services of for­wards Sarah Dacey and Aubrey Falk who are in the middle of lacrosse season and have a schedule conflict. Dorrance puts a different spin on his problem of a depleted roster. 
"I have no problem with the lineup we're going to put on the field," Dorrance added. "It's good for the players to get ex­perience against a team the caliber of Notre Dame." 
As for the Irish, midfielder Holly Manthei continues to train with the Carolina quartet in Florida and will not play. Seniors Ashley Scharff and McCarthy will both make the trip, but are expected to see limited action in favor of dis­tributing experience to the un­derclassmen. 
"Ashley and I are just there if they need us," McCarthy said. 
Technically, the contest may mark McCarthy's last game in an Irish uniform, but the for­ward views the game in a dif-

ferent light. 
"I don't want to look at it that way because it sounds kind of sad," she added. "I guess I thought of the national champi­onship game as my last game at Notre Dame and there was no better way to end." 
With the different lineup changes, Dorrance understands the adjustments he will have to make. In the national semifi­nal, co-captain Cindy Daws was able to penetrate the Tar Heel defense and Dorrance recog­nizes this problem. 
"We're going to have to figure out how to contain Cindy Daws," he said. 
"I think they're going to have trouble containing our attack," Petrucelli added. 
The Irish will also be seeing many fresh faces because of North Carolina's short-handed lineup. 
"They (North Carolina) have a deep bench and will still have a good team out on the field," Henola added. 
"You have to be able to han­dle their pressure and we can't afford to give the ball up," Petrucelli noted. 
"This is just an opportunity to play a good game against a good team. Winning or losing will not affect a national cham­pionship."

Irish need youth to step up 
By MIKE DAY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
As far as Notre Dame foot­ball goes, Derrick Mayes is gone-out of sight, out of mind. Like Tim Brown and Raghib Ismail before him, the talent­ed wideout is taking his abili­ties to the National Football League. 
Now, on a team with few weaknesses, the question re­mains: how will the Irish possibly replace the record setting Mayes?

There is•an old adage that asserts "Numbers don't lie." 
During his outstanding four­year career at Notre Dame, that often proved true for Derrick Mayes. 
129 career receptions, 22 touchdowns, 2512 yards ­these are the kind of numbers that scream success, particu­larly in a run-oriented offense.

The funny thing about ap­plause is that it keeps you com­ing back. Before the last hands made some noise on Sunday. Petrucelli stated a familiar goal for the 1996 squad. Winning a national title and repeating as champions would be the inevitable focus of next season.
