Evaluations is arousing mixed opinions among faculty mem­bers, who think TCE publica­tion may merely serve as a way for students to find easy class­es. Some faculty members also worry about professors giving higher grades in exchange for better evaluations and are con­cerned about the issue of confi­dentiality of the TCE, which fac­tors into earning promotions and tenure. 
One common sentiment among both students and pro­fessors is that comprehensive information about professors should be available to students. The disagreement is over how

NO students move off-campus 
Housing shortage contributes to off­campus popularity 
By TERESA FRALISH Assistant News Editor 
As increasing numbers of Notre Dame seniors opt for off-campus housing, the trend of declining amounts of undergraduates living in the residence halls poses a major problem for Notre Dame. 
For a University that prides itself on the quality of its resi­dence hall system, the trend toward off campus housing is problematic. 
Scott Kachmarik, associate director of residence life, said about 52 percent of current Notre Dame seniors live off campus. 
Because on campus housing for Notre Dame currently stands at 101 percent capaci­ty, a certain number of stu­dents must live off campus each year to allow the University to meet the demand for housing. 
"We need about 1600 stu­dents every year to move off campus," Kachmarik said. 
Since the freshmen and jun­ior classes are larger than normal, Kachmarik said the housing crunch would likely continue for the next several years. 
The University has also seen an increase in the amount of sophomores and juniors who choose to live off campus, Kachmarik said. 
Over the past 10 years, the diction." 

As part of an attempt to keep more of its seniors on campus, Notre Dame's sister school Saint Mary's has opted to build on campus apart­ments that are set to open next year with space for 70 occupants. In this decision, Saint Mary's joins a growing number of colleges and uni­versities that have provided on campus apartments for their students.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Macaroni and... 

Now that football fans everywhere are done cursing or cheering at their TV screens, depending on what they think of mid-majors in NCAA Division 1 football, .I think it's high time for a few cheers of "Macaroni!" 
Oh, wait, wrong situation. But if you feel com­pelled enough, and the dining hall food just isn't getting you over the proverbial hump (again), feel free. 
Seriously though, football season is starting to get serious. Ohio State plays Michigan tomorrow, and that's never insignificant. 
Growing up an Ohio State fan (and probably still having a little of that in me), it's pretty cool watching scarlet and grey uniforms beat maize and blue uniforms to a pulp. 
Maybe this year they could use marshmallows to do so? Those cer­tainly seem to be considered lethal instruments around here... 
Nah, I think everything's positively peachy on that front. Now we just need to be ready to buy impressive "ND" labeled styrofoam cups next season, since water bottles are a hazard as well. 
I've been hit with several of those over my time here at Notre Dame, so I suppose one could say the issue hits home for me. 
Of course, I've waited until the season ended to say any of this, since I'm not a fan of RoboUsher coming to kick me out of the Stadium for supposedly throwing marshmallows -from the sopho­more section. What's it take to get a rimshot around here nowadays? 
Now, before someone sets their sights on writing me a nice long let­ter -that's right, hold your horses, Cappy-I really don't care that much about marshmallows or the lack thereof at games, regardless of the reason they're missing. 
Unless, of course, they're in the middle of s'mores. Take s'mores away, and then I'll fight. 
Ah, who am I kidding? A pile of Honey Maid boxes, Hershey wrap­pers and Jet-Puff bags tossed on the steps of the Main Building and lit on fire just wouldn't get much done. 
Somehow, Save Our S'mores does­n't have much of a ring to it, either -at least one that anyone really important would listen to. 
Ooh, I know! I can petition Student Government to get started on the "S'more Saving Committee" now, as opposed to six months after the fact! 
Ahhh ... I think there's something slightly wrong with my reasoning facilities. Maybe it's just all the ethanol in the air... 
Well, time for me to go stick a feather in my cap -you fill in the rest. A sometime columnist I may be, Yankee Doodle I'm not. At least, not if one of the requirements is to "with the girls be handy" -this is Notre Dame, remember?

Protestors turn out en masse for Bush visit 
What's Your Sleeping IQ? 
Marisha Fortner 
A test that may be more challenging than you tl1ink! Are you getting enough sleep? Does it take you more than 30 minutes 
to fall asleep at night? Do you wake up frequently or too early or have a hard time going back to sleep? When you awaken, 
do you feel groggy and lethargic? Do you feel drowsy during the day particularly during a monotonous situation? If you 
answered "yes" to any of the these questions you may have a sleep debt. A recent NSS"Sieep in America" poll found that 
60% of American adults experience sleep problems. 
Sleep ... it's as fundamental to our health and well being as food, water and air. Sleep deprivation impacts both quality of life 
and health. In the past 25 years we have added a month to our average work/commute time and in the past century we 
have reduced our average time asleep by 20 percent. Our bodies have not changed but our society has and we are ipaying the price. For example, when sleep deprived, we are less alert & irritable. Our productivity is sabotaged because 
our JUdgement and ability to concentrate decreases. Did you know that most car accidents occur between 2am-6am? 
Feeling fully rested and energized constitutes a good nighfs sleep. In general, most healthy adults need an average of 8 hours a night but a more 
demanding day may require as many as 9 hours. So how do you know you're getting enough sleep? We have a natural clock that's regulated by an 
internal biological "clock" that runs on a cycle of about 24 hours. Some people are "owls" or more alert late in the day, others are "larks" or morning 
people-plan your activities accordingly with your own clock. Most people's clock is set to sleep at night, especially in the early morning hours between 
midnight and dawn. There is also a natural decline between 1-4pm, reserve this time for less critical activities i.e. checking e-mail, doing laundry. 
exercising or even taking a nap. A study at Harvard University showed that a 15-20 minute nap reverses information overload. It can also improve 
alertness and sharpen memory and ease the impact of lost sleep. But, a nap is just a short-term solution and not a substitute for a full night's sleep. 
Don't nap if you are having trouble falling asleep at night or staying asleep during the night.

What you do during the day may interfere with how well you sleep at night as well. 
 
Avoid caffeinated beverages for at least six hours before going to bed.  Avoid ~lcohol for at least two hours before bedtime.  Stress... considered to be the number one cause of short-term sleeping difficulties. Learn to manage and cope with stress.  Eating too much before bed or being hungry can make it difficult to sleep. Keep your last meal light and enjoy a small snack before bedtime.  Say good~bye to n~cotine! Research suggests that it's linked to problems waking up and difficulty falling asleep.  Exercise regularly, and if possible, in the late afternoon. 

 
Get up at the same time every day regardless of when you went to sleep & utilize a nap if tired.  If taking medication, check the label for any sleep side effects.  Your bed is for sleeping only! No more studying, reading or watching tv before bedtime! 


How do I fix a sleep debt? On your next vacation go to bed when you feel tired (even if it's 9pm) and get up whenever you're ready with no alarm clock. 1 Sleep until you are slept out. It may take a few days to get rid of the sleep debt you've accumulated. After you've accomplished this your body will tell 'you how much sleep you need on a regular basis. If you don't have a vacation coming up, then get up at the same time everyday, even on the 
weekends and vary the times you go to bed until you've discovered how much sleep is enough for you to feel restored and ready to face the day

Associated Press 
LONDON -Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the heart of London on Thursday, toppling a 17 -foot tall papier mache statue of President Bush and burning his life-size effigy to show their anger for the Iraq war and Prime Minister Tony Blair's support of the inva­sion. 
As Bush and Blair vowed "not to flinch or give way or concede one inch" to terrorism in the wake of deadly bombings against British targets in Turkey, protesters said the close rela­tionship between the two leaders made them deeply uneasy. 
"We're angry that Bush appears to be leading our coun­try," said marcher Ted Edwards. "Why Blair is allying himself to Bush I do not know." 
Many in the crowd said Thursday's bombings in Istanbul, which killed more than two dozen people, strengthened their resolve to oppose U.S.­British policy in Iraq. 
"There have been more and more bombings since the action in Iraq and more terrorism," said Mischa Gorris, a 37 -year­old London lawyer. "You will never change the hearts and minds of terrorists by bombing them. This is what you will get." 
Amid chants, the blast of foghorns and the beat of drums, protesters marched past the Houses of Parliament and through the heart of governmen­tal London to Trafalgar Square. 
The march took almost two 
hours to clear its starting point 
at the University of London. The 
Stop the War Coalition, which 
organized the march,. said 
200,000 people participated; the 
police estimate was 70,000. 
As the work day ended, many people who had not marched joined a rally in Trafalgar Square, where the bronze-paint­ed statue of Bush was toppled to wild applause -a mocking ref­erence to the toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue after coalition troops took control of Baghdad on April9. 
After sundown, protesters burned placards and at least one life-size effigy of Bush. The 17­foot papier mache statue was shredded by organizers and given out to the crowd. 
The protests were generally orderly, but as night fell police struggled to contain a few hun­dred demonstrators who broke away from the Trafalgar Square rally and darted down a nearby street. Officers linked arms sur­rounding the protesters and arrested several who refused to move ofTthe road. 
Other groups headed toward Regent's Park where Bush was hosting a dinner for Queen Elizabeth II at Winfield House, the home of U.S. Ambassador to Britain William Farish. 
Police outside the grounds of the mansion handcuffed and searched two men after protest­ers tried to jump the fence into 
the neighboring gardens. The 
men were bundled into police 
vans and officers scoured the 
gardens with flashlights for 
more possible intruders. 
When the queen and the presi­dent drove away from the man­sion after the dinner, around 15 protesters waiting outside shout­ed "terrorist!" 
Despite the general peaceful­ness of the demonstrations, police reported two officers had required treatment for injuries. 
Opposition to the Iraq war, and Britain's role as the largest part­ner of the United States, has been strong and vocal in Britain. The largest protest, in February, drew about a million people. 
Security, which has been tight for Bush's state visit, was intense on Thursday, with more than 5,000 officers on duty in London. Rows of yellow-jacketed officers lined the march route. 
Protests during Bush's visit have been largely trouble-free. Police said about 50 people were arrested on charges that includ­ed theft. drunkenness and drug possession. 
As marchers chanting "George Bush, terrorist" made their way through a business district, a few scuffled with three Bush supporters holding U.S. flags and a sign saying "support America." Police quickly inter­vened and hustled the three counter-demonstrators into a nearby building.

TCE

to organize that information, and many professors feel the TCE in its current form is not the best way to do that. 
Biology professor Martin Tenniswood is in support of the proposal. 
"I don't really understand why anyone would be concerned about it being secretive," he said. Tenniswood said the main issue in the debate is how stu­dents and administration will use the published TCE results. 
The University of Ottawa, where Tenniswood previously taught, has published their equivalent of the TCE for over 50 years. He said the institution even went as far as to post the five highest and lowest evalua­tions in each department. Those professors posted in the lowest category never allowed them­selves to show up there more than once, said Tenniswood. 
Clive Neal, associate professor in the Department of Civil Engineering and Geological Sciences, said published TCE's would have two effects: "One, it allows students to avoid a hard class. On the other hand, it holds professors more account­able." 
Ava Preacher, assistant dean for the College of Arts and Letters, sat on the Academic Council in the mid -1990s when a similar proposal was written by Student Government. "There is more predilection this time than there was [in the mid-90s] in trying to find a way to get information to students," said Preacher. 
Preacher said that for the pro­posal to be successful, students will need to find a way to distill the TCE's into a digestible for­mat. "It's going to mean a lot of work on the students' part and on the faculty's part," she said. Preacher noted that publication of such reports at other schools, like Harvard, have been organ­ized by students. 
"There is a reasonable hesita­tion in publishing the TCE's in their present form," she said. "The data in present form can be subjective." 
Preacher added that the issue of confidentiality is at the heart of the debate because faculty jobs partially depend on the results of TCE's. "This is a really difficult, complicated issue." 
Currently, the TCE results are compiled by the University's Office of Institutional Research and are then given to respective professors, deans, and depart­ment chairs. Since students are not allowed to see the compiled results of the TCE's, they must turn to other media for informa­tion about professors. Traditional word of mouth is one useful method and another is surfing the Internet. Students can obtain a rudimentary evalu­ation of some professors through the student-run website NDtoday.com, but the site's pro­fessor evaluations are not as comprehensive as the TCE and are not available for all profes­sors. 
Jeremy Staley, chairperson of the Academic Committee in the Office of the Student Body President, and the person in charge of the proposal, sees the popularity of NDtoday.com as an indication of the need for students to know about a pro­fessor before jumping into a class. He also thinks the University could do better. 
"The University could provide something much more complete that could better serve stu­dents," he said. 
In regard to faculty concerns about TCE publication, Staley believes they have greatly underestimated the quality of students and professors at Notre Dame. 
"The typical student attracted to this university seeks an edu-­cation of a caliber and compre­hensiveness far beyond what any grade-point-average could provide. Instructors who would resort to grade inflation in hopes of higher TCE evaluations would be easily identifiable by administrators," said Staley in his proposal draft for TCE publi­cation. 
If the proposal is approved, Student Government plans to publish the TCE results on Irishlink so they would only be available to members of the Notre Dame community. Staley said some schools. such as Brown and Northwestern, pub­lish their teacher evaluations on the Internet for anyone to see. 
In addition to the numerical results of the regular TCE ques­tions, the published results will include a space for professors to write any information about themselves that they feel stu­dents should know. This could include information about their teaching style, requirements for their courses, or possibly why their TCE's were particularly good or bad and how they will respond to those evaluations. 
By allowing professors an opportunity to tell students about themselves, Staley hopes to reassure faculty that TCE publication is a means for pro­ducing good matches between students and professors, not GPA boosting. If some profes­sors are still against the idea of TCE publication, Staley said they would be allowed to opt out of the process. 
If nothing else, Staley said he is satisfied with the dialogue motivated by the proposal. 
"It's healthy for the University to have this discussion," he said.

On the occasion of International Education Week (November 17-21, 2003), the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures and the Office of International Studies salute our students in languages and l'iteratures, our participants in international study programs, and all of our applicants for international fellowships. 
"We are all students of the world we live in, and today, our world is more interdependent than ever before. The challenges we face in areas such as security, democratic development, economics, and health cannot be addressed by any country acting alone. International education -learning about other cultures and languages through study, living overseas, and interacting with people of other countries -promotes the free exchange of ideas, allows us to seek joint solutions to problems, and helps create lasting partnerships to meet our shared concerns." Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. 
"Since the inception of International Education Week in November 2000, Americans have experienced several world events that should leave us with little doubt that we are living in an interconnected world. The need for understanding other cultures, languages, and global issues has become increasingly more significant. We should do our very best to give our students the skills they need to be successful global citizens." Secretary of Education Rod Paige.

Translator pleads innocent 
WORCESTER. Mass. -A former Guantanamo Bay translator arrested with classified documents in his luggage pleaded innocent Thursday in a brief appearance in federal court. 
Ahmed Fathy ·Mehalba, who has been in federal custody since his arrest Sept. 29 at Logan International Airport, was charged in a Nov. 12 indictment with gathering, trans­mitting or losing defense information and making false statements. 
Mehalba, 31, was arrested as he arrived at Logan after visiting his native Egypt. The government alleges he lied to federal investi­gators when he told them he was not carry­ing any government documents from Guantanamo Bay. Customs agents found 132 compact discs in his luggage, including one that contained hundreds of classified docu­ments labeled "SECRET," authorities said.

Because the College opted to provide the on campus apart­ment opportunity to its seniors, Saint Mary's will keep at least one more senior on campus. Junior Melissa Montoya said she hopes to live in the new apartments, and would defi­nitely consider moving off cam­pus otherwise. 
"We want the experience of living off campus," she said. 
Montoya said she does not hope to see the same residence hall policies put in place for the new apartments. 
"It's ridiculous to have pari­etals for seniors," she said. "If they want us to act like adults they should treat us as such."

Mutual fund faces fraud charges 
NEW YOHK -The founders of the Pilgrim 
naxter mutual l'und family were charged with 
civil fraud Thursday for allegedly making mil­
lions of dollars for themselves and friends in 
an improper trading scheme that hurt other 
fund shareholders. 
Gary Pilgrim and Howard Baxter were accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission and New York's attorney general of defrauding investors by allowing selected customers to make in-and-out trades prohibit­ed by fund policy. 
The charges mark the first time that mutual fund leadership has been directly charged in a trading scandal that has rapidly spread across the $7 trillion industry. Previously, regulators had tu.ken action against two former Putnam Investments portfolio managers, as well as the firm, but Putnams top executives were not directly accused. 
Authorities said it appears Gary Pilgrim ben­efited the most financially from the trades, while Baxter broke the law by allowing them. One trading arrangement netted more than $13 million in profits, including $3.9 million for Pilgrim, according to the SEC complaint. 
Employees will receive $1 OOK 
INDIANAPOLIS -Employees of Golden Rule Financial Corp. are expected to receive an average of about $100,000 from the fami­ly-owned company's sale to UnitedHcalth Group. 
The windfall is the result of an employee stock ownership plan Golden Rule started in 2001 to replace a profit-sharing plan and supplement a 401(k) retirement plan, The Indianapolis Star reported in a story Thursday. 
Golden Rule created a trust that borrowed money to buy stock in the privately held com­pany, and gave stock to employees as the loan was paid down. When UnitedHealth closed on the $500 million cash acquisition Nov. 1_3, the trust was able to pay off the $55 million loan and hand out the remaining stock. 
The stock was valued at $71 a share in a December 2002 appraisal and UnitedHealth paid $133 a share, sald Patrick Carr, Golden Rule's chief financial officer. 
Stocks drop following attacks 
Blasts in Turkey make traders nervous, employment numbers remain strong 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Wall 
Street retreated Thursday 
as a wave of terrorist 
attacks continued in 
Turkey with the bombings 
of HSBC bank and the 
British consulate. Upbeat 
reports on employment 
and the economy helped 
limit the market's losses. 

The Dow Jones industri­
al average fell in early 
trading and then rose as 
much as 35 points before 
pulling back again late in 
the day. Though the econ­
omy seems to be improv­
ing, analysts say renewed 
political uncertainty could 
keep indecisive investors 
from making major com­
mitments. 

"Investors are very 
nervous about continued 
terrorist activity, but at 
the same time, they are 
showing more confidence 
in the economy and the 
equity market," said Peter 
Dunay, · chief ma-rket 
strategist at Wall Street 
Access. "So we have a lit­
tle battle of the pros and 
cons here." 
The Dow closed down 

71.04, or 0.7 percent, at 
9,619.42, having declined 
in four of the previous five 
sessions. 
The broader market 
also finished lower. The 
Nasdaq composite index 
fell17.73, or 0.9 percent, 
to 1,881.92. The Standard 
& Poor's 500 index 
declined 8. 79, or 0.8 per­
cent, to 1 ,033.65. 
In Turkey, two truck bombs exploded outside London-based HSBC and the British consulate. killing at least 25 people and wounding nearly 400. The explosions, which came during President Bush's trip to Britain, 
were blamed on the al­Qaida terrorist network. 
Until this week, terror­ism had receded as a fac­tor in stock trading, but the bombings of two syn­agogues in Turkey over the weekend and Thursday's attacks reminded markets around the world of the danger that terrorist organiza-tions still pose. 


Perhaps adding to the uneasiness on Wall Street was the brief evacuation of the White House after birds or possibly atmos­phere disturbances trig­gered a false radar read­ing, which initially was thought to be an unautho­rized plane flying near the White House. 
But the economic news lent support to the mar­ket, and enabled the major indexes to move briefly into positive ground. 
The Labor Department reported that new jobless claims fell by a seasonally adjusted 15,000 to 355,000. The reading, which beat economists' estimates, marked the seventh straight week 
that claims have been below the 400,000 level that is associated with a weak job market. 
And the Conference Board said its Index of Leading Economic Indicators, the widely watched economic fore­casting gauge, increased 
0.4 percent to 113.6 last month compared to a flat reading in September. Analysts were expecting a more modest 0.2 percent rise. 
"It's all about the unrest as far as the terrorism," said Todd Clark, head of listed equity trading at Wells Fargo Securities. "It's given people the excuse to stay away." 
He added that many investors, nervous that stock valuations might be 

a bit high after several months of advances, are being cautious to make sure they can end the year with gains. 
"The volume has crept to a standstill," Clark said. ··we need to see some kind of a change in terms of macroeconomic numbers or earnings guidance to get people back into the game here." 
Schering-Plough Corp. fell 72 cents to $15.28 after the drug company said its Polish subsidiary is being investigated by federal regulators. 
Hewlett-Packard Co. declined 7 5 cents to $21.59 even though the computer company posted a doubling of quarterly profits that beat analysts' expectations. 

Cell phone companies utilize gimmicks 
Associated Press 

ATLANTA-Don't leave! Pick me! 
Cell phone companies are blan­keting the market with price cuts, extra minutes, premium services and sleek handsets to lure cus­tomers from rivals and make sure their own subscribers don't bolt come Monday. 
That is when new federal rules will begin that allow legions of dis­satisfied customers and bargain­hunters to switch wireless compa­nies without losing their cell num­bers. 
Wireless phone companies tried hard to block the rule from taking effect, but are trying to make the best of it now that it is here, baiting customers with some of the most generous deals ever. 
They are offering more minutes and cheaper rates, camera phones and other cutting-edge handsets, as well as enhanced features such as faster Internet connections and walkie-talkie services. 
T-Mobile, for example, expanded its free weekend calling feature to include all day Friday, the busiest calling day of the week. 
Sprint and Cingular have taken a similar tack, offering to roll back the start time for off-peak calling from 9 p.m. to 7 p.m. The option costs $5 a month at Sprint, and $7 at Cingular, which is also offering 500 extra minutes for customers to use if they exceed their monthly allotment. 
This week, AT&T Wireless unveiled major upgrades in speed and features for its wireless data services. Next, the company plans to cut the charges for calls above a subscriber's monthly allowance to 8 or 9 cents per minute, down from 25 to 40 cents. Previously, it also halved the charge for extra phones on an account to $9.99 a month. 
Also this week, Sprint launched an aggressively priced walkie-talkie service, an area long dominated by Nextel, which along with Verizon Wireless has generally stood on the sidelines of the marketing frenzy.

Congress sends Syria legislation to President 
Associated Pn:ss 
WASHINGTON -Congress passed legislation Thursday to impose economic penalties against Syria, reflecting broad agreement among lawmakers that Syria has been a detri­ment to the fight against ter­rorism in the Middle East and Iraq. 
President Bush is expected to sign the bill even though he is not enthusiastic about such restraints on his foreign policy. The measure requires the president to act if Syria does not make significant steps to reverse its tolerance and sup­port of anti-American forces. 
The House voted 408-8 in favor of a Senate-amended version oirthe legislation that, at the urging of the White House, gives the president greater leeway to waive the punishment on the basis of national security. 
"The Syrian regime has the blood of Americans on their hands," said Rep; Ileana Ros­Lehtinen, R-Fla. Administration officials agree, she said, that "Syria is on the wrong side of history and now it is time for it to suffer the consequences." 
Syria long has been on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, along with North Korea, Sudan, Cuba, Iran and Libya.· But Syria is the only country on that list to have full diplomatic relations with the United States. 
Awarding normal relations to Syria never made any sense, said Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., a lead sponsor of the bill. Congress is saying to Syria in the legislation that "the time is up ... we are not coddling you any more," Engel said. 

U.S. officials acknowledge that Syria, at Washington's prodding, has taken steps to prevent anti-American terror­ists and weapons from crossing its border with Iraq. But law­makers said the Damascus government has fallen shor! in numerous other areas. 
The legislation notes that Syria has provided a safe haven for anti-Israel terrorist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad and is accused of pursuing the development and production of biological and chemical weapons. 
The bill states that Syria must end its support of terror­ists, terminate its 27 -year mili­tary presence in Lebanon, stop efforts to obtain or produce weapons of mass destruction and long-range ballistic mis­siles and interdict terrorists and weapons from entering Iraq. 
If Syria fails to meet those conditions, the president must ban sales of dual-use items, which can have both civilian and military applications. 
He also must impose at least two out of a list of six possible penalties: a ban on exports to Syria, prohibition of U.S. busi­nesses' operating in Syria, restrictions on Syrian diplo­mats in the United States, lim­its on Syrian airline flights in the United States, reduction of diplomatic contacts or a freeze on Syrian assets in the United States.

Sniper jury sees tapes,. car 
Associated Press 
VIRGINIA BEACH -Jurors deciding the fate of sniper John Allen Muhammad saw a softer side of the convicted murderer Thursday, watching a home movie in which he plays with his children and encourages them to take their first steps. But prosecutors said "that per­son no longer exists." 
The jury was to begin delib­erating Friday on whether Muhammad should live or die for masterminding the Washington-area sniper spree last year. Muhammad was con­victed Monday of two murder counts related to the wave of killings that left 10 people dead and three wounded. 
The 42-year-old Army veter­an appeared glum as he watched the five-minute video Thursday, alternately wearing a frown and hanging his head. 
"You can walk. Now go ahead and walk to daddy," he says on the tape as one of his daugh­ters takes her first steps. In another clip, Muhammad says to the girl, "Let me see the teeth" and the girl flashes two baby teeth and a big smile. 
But prosecutors said during closing arguments in the trial's penalty phase that evidence about Muhammad once being a good family man is irrelevant stacked against the terror of last year's killing spree. 
"That person no longer exists.... That person was mur­dered by this individual just as viciously and just as completely as everybody else," Willett said, pointing to Muhammad. "This is not a question of whether there once was a good father, whether there once was a good husband."

The tape was played immedi­ately after Muhammad's sister, Aurolyn Williams, described the difficult circumstances of their early childhood. Their mother died of breast cancer when Muhammad was 3 and was in constant grief because they could not afford pain med­ication for her. 
"She'd lay there and cry and moan. John would sleep in bed with my mom," Williams said. "He loved his mom. That was our backbone. That was all we had. He was like a cat with kit­tens."

At his trial, 14-year-old Iran Brown testified Thursday that he thought he was going to die when he was hit by a bullet as he arrived at Tasker Middle School in Bowie, Md., on Oct. 7. 2002. Brown, who was 13 at the time, was the only child shot during the spree. 
"My aunt drove me to school. I got out of the car, and I got shot," Brown said, speaking in an emotionless monotone. 
"I heard a big bang and then I fell to the ground. Then I felt a burn," said Brown. ·

QUOTE OF THE DAY

Bush inspires mass group therapy 
I had the distinct privilege of attending several of the organized protests across London against the visit of President George W. Bush this week. Media projections from both American and British 
Bill Rlnner 

news sources made me expect near­riotous condi­A Voice of tions from Reason the over­whelming opposition to Bush's visit. 
Instead, I witnessed a carnival of protesters participating in an act of self-indulgence. 
The right to protest and demon­strate is one of the most crucial liber­ties ensured by Western democracies, and the events preceding President Bush's visit inspired me to attend the protest to gain a better understanding of European opposition to the leader of the free world. In a jam packed theater at the London School of Economics, I listened to George Galloway, the leading anti-war Member of Parliament, mock the president during a speech to the Stop the War Coalition, then continue to state, "I cannot condemn suicide bombers in Iraq attempting to rid their country of the foreign invaders." My stomach turned as I considered the thousands of Americans placing their lives on the line for their country whether they agree with the presi­dent or not, yet rvowed not to be dis­couraged. 
Posters around school advertised a "Stop Bush" party in the Underground Bar-one pound for a pint! I never imagined the limitless social opportunities that existed for those who despise the president before I arrived in London, and the week's events were no exception. The highlight of the party was a heated debate between two individuals who could not decide if Bush was more of a terrorist or a war criminal. He was finally deemed a ter­rorist because the title of war criminal is more apt for a leader who is demo­cratically elected, of course. 
Finally. Bush arrived on Tuesday, and the streets were abuzz with gen­eral fervor as the historic three day visit commenced. I ventured out with my head low toward the protesting hot spots, not knowing what to expect. After approaching the crowd with caution, my apprehension allayed when I beheld the scene. 
Many of the trademarks of a nor­mal protest were present, from the upside down American flags to the Bush effigies. The most elaborate was a Bush doll gripping a missile in one hand and a flag in the other, complete with a sign reading "Smart bomb for a stupid president." 
A bit confused by the seemingly overstated signs that compared Bush to Hitler or painted Cheney with oil overflowing from his mouth, I politely 
asked the protesters their humble 
opinion of my president. Their 
responses covered a variety of issues, 
and most of which were as short­
sighted and irrational as their signs 
were untruthful. 
When one man with a "No Blood for Oil" shirt voiced his anger against Bush for failing to ratify the Kyoto treaty, I couldn't help but explain how President Clinton put ofT ratifying it during his term, and AI Gore, author of "Earth in the Balance," probably would not have signed the treaty him­self had he won the 2000 election. Before I could continue and explain the treaty's blatant anti-American bias, he jumped on the mention of the 2000 election and spouted ofT some Michael Moore-inspired rant about how Bush stole the election with his gang of thugs. 
Another protester, a woman carry­ing a copy of "A Terrorist Comes to Town" rallying poster, told me that she thought Bush's administration was composed of neo-Nazis who want to take over the world. And she was serious. I stopped myself before I could respond because a large crowd was forming around a protester with a loudspeaker who drew my attention away. 
The crowd was the largest yet, and at that point rrealized the massive protest was astoundingly similar to group therapy, with throngs of rabid Bush haters voicing their oft misguid­ed, though not entirely invalid, argu­ments against the president to wel­coming listeners. The act of scream­
ing obscenities against a person 
completely out of earshot in 
the midst of a sympathetic 
audience can be a cathar­
tic experience for some­
one with pent up rage. 
The social dimension 
of the entire event 
pervaded the crowd 
where people could 
connect through 
their one shared 
character trait: 
hatred for Bush. 
The personal 
benefits of their 
protest started to 
make everything 
from the last week 
come together, and 
I almost disregard­
ed the fact that the 
media attention they 
draw only makes 
them look bad in the 
eyes of a rational-mind­
ed individual. 
Ifyou watch CNN and 
hear tales of the noble protest­

ers voicing their utter rage against the Bush juggernaut, you're hearing a skewed version of the actual events that unfolded. Hardly any voices of intellectual honesty existed in the crowd; otherwise, we would hear more praise of Bush for bringing together one of the largest support groups in history in the streets of London. 
Bill Rinner is a junior economics major currently attending the London School ofEconomics. He believes that the most effective protests are for a common goal. not against a common enemy. His column appears every other Friday. He can be reached at wrinner@nd. edu.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Demand for English courses recognized 
There seems to be some confusion as to the makeup of the English Department's Spring 2004 curriculum. In an effort to alleviate some of this anxiety for our majors and others, I would like to clarify the situation. 
The English Department is offering, in the Spring 2004 semester, the exact same number of required courses for majors we offered in the Spring 2003 semester. We also have available the same number of seats in 300-level courses that satisfy the University literature requirement. As for 400-level electives, this Spring we are, in fact, offering more of them than we did last Spring. 
We understand the concern students have regarding the number and availability of courses in English. As demand for English courses grows, not only from the increasing number of majors we have but from the University as a whole, we do all we can to pro­vide the broadest, most accessible curriculum possible. 
Stephen Fredman Chair Department of English Nov. 20 
A call for equality 
On Nov. 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court struck down that state's ban on same-sex marriage, and homosexuals across the nation rejoiced. Gay columnist Andrew Sullivan tri­umphantly declared, "Thank God Almighty, we are free at last." 
Specifically, the Massachusetts Court found the state's current marriage statute inconsistent with the Massachusetts Constitution and has required the state legislature to remedy the situation within 180 days. The legislature has two options: either to enact a changed mar­riage statute consistent with the Court's ruling, or to amend the Massachusetts Constitution to include a ban on same-sex marriage. 
While gay-rights supporters have hailed this decision as a victory, it has neverthe­less come under fire by several Christian­conservative groups and prominent Republicans. The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, has called for the state legislature to draft an amendment to the state constitution to exclude same-sex marriage, and President George W. Bush declared firmly that "Marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman," and vowed to work to protect the "sanctity of marriage." 
As a gay Christian Republican, I freely admit that r am at this time conflicted in my loyalties. The party of Lincoln and the emancipation of the slaves has morphed into a party that too often resists chang.e merely for the sake of protecting the sta­tus quo. But alas, I am not a one-issue voter and will not let my disagreement with Republicans on gay rights dominate my political judgment. 
Cultural attitudes towards homosexual­ity are undergoing significant change, as society's understanding of it increases. Where most people used to think of homosexuality as a choice, hence the term sexual preference, many now think of it as a natural identity, or sexual orien­tation. This is no accident. Any homosex­ual will confidently proclaim that it is not a choice, and several scientific studies all point towards homosexuality as a genetic disposition. 
Once the understanding of homosexual­ity that has forever been in the hearts and minds of homosexuals enters the public consciousness, society's laws will begin to recognize homosexuals as a class of individuals with a common physi­cal trait, and thus subject to equal pro­tection under the decree of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. 
In Lawrence v. Texas, a recent Supreme Court decision striking bans on sodomy, and in subsequent cases, our nation's highest court has indeed recognized homosexuals as a group deserving of pro­tection. This realization, taken to its nat­ural conclusions, will inevitably end gov­ernmental discrimination against homo­sexuals, in the same manner that govern­mental discrimination based on race and sex has also been Constitutionally prohib­ited. The rights entitled by marriage, whether referred to as marriage or as a civil union, must extend to all. 
Opponents of same-sex marriage argue that the sanctity of the institution is endangered by removing the requirement that marriage involve a man and a woman. Yet, they offer no convincing evi­dence that such will actually be the case; only the most bigoted individual would argue that homosexuals are incapable of the love, respect, loyalty, honesty and other qualities necessary for a successful and fulfilling marriage. 
Therefore, they fall back on tradition and religious arguments. Tradition alone is never sufficient reason to resist change. If it were, then blacks would not be free today and women would not be allowed to vote. In regard to religious arguments, nobody is wishing the govern­ment to force any religion to accept a dif­ferent definition of marriage. Rather, they want the government to confer the solely civil rights of the civic institution of mar­riage equally upon all. Asking the govern­ment to define a civic institution based on religious grounds would be an unconsti­tutional breech of the First Amendment Establishment Clause, and therefore is an improper request. 
In Lawrence, Justice Antonin Scalia said this nation is becoming entangled in a "culture war," and in a sense he was right. We have the choice today between tolerance and equal treatment and big­otry and discrimination. Ultimately, the challenge facing society is the same chal­lenge that faces each one of us in our hearts and souls, and is best captured in the words of Martin Luther King, Jr.: "The good neighbor looks beyond the external accidents and discerns those inner qualities that make ali men human and, therefore, brothers."

By SARAH VABULAS and SCOTT FONFERKO Scene Writers 
With Irish football home games at a close for the season, you might just be wondering what there is to do on the weekends besides sitting around your dorm room and complaining that there is nothing to do. Well, hit the road! There is an abundance of activities to the west of Notre Dame on 1-90. 
Downtown Chicago has many things to offer besides fine-dining and world-renowned shopping. Seeing as though South Bend does not draw many popular bands, Chicago is the best place to go to see that desired concert. From now until Christmas break, if you can break away from those books, many popular bands will be appearing across the city. 
The House of Blues in Chicago, found near Navy Pier at 329 N. Dearborn, features several concerts and is a great venue for concertgoers and musicians alike. HOB, unless otherwise noted, is an 18 and over venue with general admission and standing room only. Valid identifica­tion is required for entry. All tickets can be purchased from Ticketmaster at ticketmaster.com or by phone at 312-559-1212. The phone number is 312-923-2000. 
Better Than Ezra, who played at The Show in Aug. 2002, is just one of many popular bands who is sched­uled to play at the HOB in upcoming weeks. Tickets for the Nov. 28 9 p.m. show are available for $22.50. Doors open at 7:30p.m.

For those of you who still enjoy the high energy, swing-dancing music, Brian Setzer Orchestra will play HOB on Dec. 6 at 9 p.m. Tickets are $45. This is a 21 and over show, presented by VHl. The doors open at 7:30 p.m.

formance. But the show is very audi­ence friendly, with many appear­ances by cast members in the aisles. It is a beautiful event and not to be missed. Beware; this magical musical leaves Chicago after Jan. 18, so go while you can. 
With Christmas rapidly approach­ing, there are many traditional events to choose from. One of those is the "Nutcracker" performed by the Joffrey Ballet Company of Chicago. This rendition of the classic is at the Auditorium Theatre and runs from Dec. 5 until Dec. 28. Tickets range from $13 to $63. So take a friend or that special someone and get in the Christmas spirit with this classic bal­let. 
Coming on Dec. 16 is the highly acclaimed "Hairspray" musical. It will be in Chicago until Feb. 15. 

Tickets are moving quickly and range from $40 to $80. "Hairspray" will be at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts. It is sure to entertain and make you laugh. 
While this is simply a brief overview of special events in Chicago in the coming months, it can hardly explain the overwhelming amount of things to do on a daily basis. Blue Man Group performs nightly at the Briar Street Theatre. Visit www.blue­man.com for further information about the group. 
After all the fun and you feel like enjoying an educational, but enter­taining experience, visit one of the many Chicago museums and revisit the days of elementary school, going on field trips and goofing around the museums. There's the Museum of Science and Industry, the Field 

Museum, the John G. Shedd 
Aquarium, the Adler Planetarium 
and Astronomy Museum and the Art 
Institute of Chicago. All the museums 
are within an hour and a half driving 
distance from South Bend. 
The Museum of Science and 
Industry, located on Lakeshore Drive 
is a museum that encases a full size 
submarine to a fully intact jet. The 
museum also has the luxury of an 
IMAX theater as well. The hours of 
the Museum of Science and Industry 
are 9:30 a.m. to 5:50 p.m. everyday 
except for Christmas Day. The admis­
sion charge for the museum itself is 
$5.50 for children, $9 for adults and 
$7.50 seniors. For admission with a 
ticket to see the IMAX movie the 
charges are $10.00 for children, 
$15.00 for adults and $12.50 for sen­
iors. 

The Field Museum, slightly smaller than the Museum of Science and Industry, showcases a lot of specified items. It is located north of Solder Field on Lakeshore Drive. The muse­um is currently featuring a special about the history of flight. A perma­nent Egyptian exhibit is encased within a pyramid inside the museum. This museum also includes a full size skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The hours for the Field Museum are 9 
a.m. to 5 p.m. The admissions charges for the Field Museum are $5 for children, $10 for adults, and $7.00 for seniors. 
The John Shedd Aquarium, which is also located on Lakeshore Drive, is north of Soldier Field and on the east side of the Field Museum. It is one the most renowned aquariums and is divided into the different waters of the world. The sections include a coral reef, the Pacific Northwest and the Amazon, and each features fish that are indigenous to the specific area. The aquarium also showcases dolphins, beluga or white whales, seals, otters and numerous salt water and freshwater fish. 
planetarium theaters. This includes the famous Zeiss Planetarium Projector that is capable of reproduc­ing every aspect of the night sky. The planetarium currently features an exhibit about Ancient Polynesian navigators and the art of steering by the stars to the history of astronomy and the thousand years of discovery. The hours of operation for the Adler Planetarium are 9:30 a.m. to 4:40 
p.m. 
weekdays and 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 

p.m. 
weekends. The admission charges are $11 for children, $13.00 for adults and $12.00 for seniors. Each admission includes a planetari­um show. 


The Art Institute of Chicago, locat­ed on Michigan Ave, is home to a variety of art from different cultures and includes 300,000 works of art from ten different curatorial depart­ments. It even houses 33 paintings by Claude Monet. Two exhibits that are currently featured at the Art Institute are Manet and the Sea and Aerospace design: The Art of Engineering from NASA's Aeronautical research. The hours for the Art Institute of Chicago are Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. 
and Tuesday 10:30 a.m. to 8:00 

p.m. 
The cost of admission is $10 for adults, $6.00 for children and seniors and free for children under age 5. Every Tuesday is free due. 


So while football is over, there is still much to do -all that is required is a short drive or a ride on the South Shore Railroad. If none of this suits you, there is always the amazing cui­sine found all over Chicago, or a short trip along Michigan Avenue can please even the toughest critic. So when all else fails, go to Chicago. 
Contact Sarah Vabulas at vabu4547@saintmarys.edu and Scott Fonferko at sfonferko@ha:-nd.edu 

It also has a center tank that houses a sea turtle and shark. The aquarium's win­ter hours, Labor Day to Memorial Day, are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays and 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekends. Hours during sum­mer months, Memorial Day to Labor Day, are 9 
a.m. to 6 p.m. both weekdays and week­ends. Admission charges are $21 for adults and $15 for children. 
The Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum, located in the same vicinity as the Field Museum and Shedd Aquarium, is the first planetarium built in the Western Hemisphere. It's also the only planetarium in the world to fea­ture two full-sized

HATTIESBURG, Miss. ­TCU in the BCS? Southern Mississippi put an end to any debate by fighting off a frantic comeback attempt by the Horned Frogs. 
Dustin Almond threw for 227 yards and three touch­downs and the Golden Eagles capitalized on four turnovers to hand the lOth­ranked Horned Frogs their first loss of the season, 40­28 on Thursday night. 
Southern Mississippi (8­3, 7-0} clinched at least a share of the Conference USA title and can win it outright with a victory over East Carolina. 
TCU (10-1, 7-1) trailed by 31-6 early in the fourth quarter before scoring three touchdowns in a span of 4:30 with the aid of two straight recovered onside kicks. 
Brandon Hassell led the comeback attempt with his passing and running. 
He swept around right end for a 1-yard TD with 
6:55 left and then threw for the 2-point conversion to cut the lead to 31-28. 
Hassell finished 18-for-31 for 260 yards with two interceptions. 
Southern Miss kicked a field goal to make it 34-28, then put the game away by forcing TCU's final turnover of the game. 
Greg Brooks got free on a corner blitz and knocked the ball from Hassell. Rod Davis recovered inside the TCU 20 with less than three minutes left and moments later Anthony Harris hulled into the end zone from 2 yards out to make it 40-28 with 1:30 left. 
TCU was eighth in the Bowl Championship Series standings this week and needed to stay unbeaten to have any shot of becoming the first school from a non­BCS league to receive an invite to one of the four high-dollar major bowls. 
Now, the best the Horned Frogs can hope for is a piece of the league title and a spot in one of five bowls with C-USA ties. 

That's a difference of about $13 million. 
Southern Miss, which has won five straight games, can earn a bid to the Liberty Bowl by beating one-win East Carolina next week. 
The win was the Golden Eagles' first ever against a ranked opponent at home, and the fans celebrated by taking down a goal post. 
Almond, who has thrown 12 TO passes since regain­ing the starting job five ga.rpes ago, was 14-for-23 with an interception.

The women's swimming and diving team looks to make a splash as theNo. 19 Irish (4-1) travel to College Station, Texas to compete in the Texas A&M Invitational this weekend. 
l\'otrc Da.me will have its hands full with a field that fea­tures some stiff competition, including the likes of No.8 SMU, No. 11 UCLA, co-No. 17's VIrginia and Texas A&M, No. 20 Florida State and Purdue.

Irish take a break from team schedule 
By MATT MOONEY 
Sports Writer 

The defending champs aren't sitting on last year's national crown. 
The Notre Dame fencing squads hope to build on their successful start last weekend as they clash against national powers Ohio State and Penn State Saturday and Sunday. But for senior Kerry Walton, the big names are just busi­ness as usual. 
"There's always a little bit [of pressure] but it's been so close the last couple of years that it's always been between us and Penn State," she said. "It's an individual sport and people are always used to other people gunning for them." 
However, the teams will not fencers will follow the men to match up against Penn State on Sunday. Both women's events are individual competition. 
Despite their division, the Irish fencers will face stiff competition at all locations. Penn State finished a very close second to Notre Dame at the national championships last season, and always main­tains a perennially powerful program. In Columbus, the men's squad will face the fencers who last year ousted them in the conference semifi­nals. They prevented Notre Dame from attaining its 19th consecutive combined confer­ence championship. 
"Ohio State is growing as our big rival," coach Janusz Bednarski said. "[As the defending champs,] all fencers

But the leftovers from last year haven't exactly gone stale. Leading the young freshmen are six returning All­Americans, including individ­ual national foil champ Alicja Kryczalo and national epee runner up Michal Sobieraj. 
Even though it's early in the season, Bednarski looks for these tournaments to provide invaluable experience to be used later in the season. 
"It will be good to check out what we have to be improved and what can be done," he said. "It will be good training for next year's champi­onships."

Irish open four-game homestand against Lakers 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER 
Associate Sports Editor 
If their games from earlier this season are any indication, Notre Dame's series against Lake Superior State could be over quicker than you can say, "He shoots, he scores." 
The Irish (5-3-1, 4-3-1 in the CCHA) and the Lakers (4-3-3, 2­3-1) are the first and second least penalized teams in the CCHA, respectively, as well as two of the least penalized teams in the nation. With fewer whis­tles and stoppages of play, the games 

are over much "We want to make "We showed faster. this a building our players film. "I think [fewer and it was pretty

Irish head coach Dave Poulin said. "I think you're going to see a heck of a game; I'd much rather it be 5-on-5 than a special-teams­fest, no question." 
The Irish are off to their fastest start since the 1998-99 season, when the team opened the season with a 7-1-1 record. The Lakers have been equally hot, going 2-0-1 in their last three years. 
Lake Superior State is a team that has had a history of success in the college hockey world, including winning the national championship in the 1988-89 season. Head coach Frank Anzalone led the team to four NCCA Final Four appearances from the years 1982-1990. 

Anzalone then left the college ranks for a professional career. but returned to the Laker bench in the 2001-02 season, in which the Lakers went 8-27-2 -a far cry from L.heir dominant 80's teams. Now in the third year of his second stint with Lake Superior State, the team is starting to show signs of reload­ing. 
Last season, Notre Dame won both matches against Anzalone's Lakers by 3-2 and 6­3 scores. Poulin serves note that this is not the same cellar­dwelling team as Anzalone's 
teams in 2001 
and 2002 were. 
certainly bringing 

back a coach who had a lot of success has given that team something to feed otT. 
"They're going to be perhaps even more disciplined and play even harder now that they've actual1y won a few games here recently." 
Notre Dame is coming off a 4­0 exhibition win last Friday against the U.S. Under-18 National Developmental Program. Freshman goalie David Brown collected his unof­ficial fourth shuto.ut of the sea­son, as the exhibition shutout wil1 not count toward his official statistics. 
Poulin said that he will start Brown on Friday against Lake Superior State, and then make his decision about Saturday's starter after Friday's game. 
Notre Dame's series against the Lakers is the first of two straight CCHA series at the Joyce Center for the Irish. Poulin stressed the importance of doing well in these four con­secutive home matches, espe­cially having opened the season with six of nine games on the road. 
"We have to make this a very difficult building to play in," he said. "We want to make this a building where people look at and say, 'I don't even want to go play there.' The band has been just tremendous at our games ­the energy they create is so great and they work so hard at creating noise and being a lively atmosphere . 
"I think it should be a great weekend." 
Forwards Trent Campbell and Nathan Ward lead the Lakers with seven points each. Like Notre Dame and Brown, the Lakers have a capable freshman netminder in Jeff. Jakaitis, who collected his first career shutout last Saturday in a scoreless tie against Bowling Green. 
Matt Violin is the other mem­ber of the Lake Superior State goaltending tandem and played well against the Irish last year in the 3-2 game, making 4 7 saves tii the Lakers' loss. He currently has a 2-3-2 record with a goals-against average of 
2.90 and a .877 save percent­age. 
Notre Dame faces Lake Superior State at the Joyce Center this weekend. Fac_eoff is scheduled for 7:35 p.m. tonight and 7:05p.m. Saturday.

NO WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
McGraw lands top 20 class 
ByJOE HETTLER 
Sports Editor 
For the eighth straight year, 
Notre Dame has landed a top 
20 recruiting class after 
bringing in three of the coun­
try's top players during the 
early signing period. 
"We are really pleased and proud to welcome to Notre Dame three young women of this caliber, both athletically and academically," Irish Coach Muffet McGraw said. 
The Irish signed Charel Allen, Melissa D'Amico and Tulyah Gaines Wednesday and the group was named No. 13 by Blue Star index. 
Allen had an outstanding season as a junior when she averaged 29.9 points, 11.4 rebounds, 7.2 steals and 4.8 assists at Monesson High School. She was the top recruit in the East region of the country and could make an immediate impact for Notre Dame. 
"She has a wonderful gift for getting to the basket and put­ting points on the board, and I believe she will be a major asset in our transition game," McGraw said. "I am also impressed with her work ethic and intensity on the court, which fits well with our pro­gram." 
Blue Index ranks Allen No. 27 in the nation. 
McGraw helped add some height to the future by signing 6'5" center Melissa D'Amico from Manorville, NY. D'Amico will be the tallest player on the team, and she averaged 
16.8 points, 9.8 rebounds and 
3.5 blocks last season for her high school team. D'Amico had a very solid summer camp, which helped put her on the map for many schools and she considered a rising star entering her senior sea­son. 
"For a post player, she is so multidimensional.," McGraw said. "She can play with her back to the basket or step out and knock down the outside shot. She's also a solid defend­er and someone who will be a great addition to our team at both ends of the floor." 
The third signee, Gaines, averaged 18.9 points and 5.1 assists. Her biggest asset is her quickness, and she will make the Irish a more athletic and fast team. 
"Tulyah may be the quickest player we've ever had come through our program, and that includes some of our cur­rent players," McGraw said. 
"She is a great on-ball defender and has great court awareness. She also is a strong passer and like Charel, we think she will help with our ability to get the ball up the floor quickly in transi­tion." 
With its eighth straight top 20 class, Notre Dame is only one of three schools to claim such an accomplishment.

Irish lead the nation in blocking, with a 3.73 per game average. Brewster is second in the nation, with 1.79 blocks per game. 
"Our block is key to our suc­cess," Brown said. 
However, that is not all that the Irish bring to the table. They have benefited from the out­standing play of Iibera Meg Henican and defensive specialist Danielle Herndon. 
When Notre Dame puts it all together, they have been a tough team to stop. 
"In order for us to be smooth, passing has to be good, setting has to be good hitters have to be on and they have to be smart," Brown said. "Overall, throughout the season, we've done a lot of good things -it's just a matter of everyone doing their job." 
But the Irish know they have room to improve, and they will work on this as they try to repeat as the Big East Tournament Champions. 
"We're not looking at the last match," Brown said. "We're tak­ing it a day at a time and looking forward to playing Miami. We feel like we have a good block defense, serving strategy, and we think our offense can do well [against Miami]. They will be hungry and we expect it to be a very competitive match." 
Game time is set for 3:30 p.m. in the Joyce Center. At 1 p.m., Pittsburgh will face Villanova in the first semifinal game. 
The winners of both games square off at 2 p.m. Sunday for the championship.

Also, the baseball facilities near Frank Eck Stadium, considered some of the best indoor facilities in the nation, and the fact that the Irish travel to the south for nearly the first quarter of the season make the wintry conditions of South Bend not as much of a fac­tor for the recruits in the deci­sion-making process. 
"It's amazing how over the last few years, the weather has not been as big of an issue with recruits as it once was," Mainieri said. "If you look at last year's class, [Irish freshman] Jeff Manship was the best player coming out of the state of Texas. So if you can take the best kid out of Texas, I think you can get just about anybody." 
The Irish recruited a pair of teammates for the fiTSt time dur­ing Mainieri's coaching regime in Korpi and Williamson, who were on the same pitching staff at Santaluces High School in Florida. In the 2003 season, Korpi posted a 1.06· ERA and 14.5 strikeouts per nine innings while Williamson notched a 1.35 ERA with 18 strikeouts per nine innings. 
The Fort Worth, Texas, native Langford will bring a great deal of versatility to the Irish, as the right bander not only logged a 6­2 record with a 2.25 ERA last year, but also hit .338 while see­ing time in the infield. 
The fourth pitcher, Gruener, posted a 1.75 ERA and near 9-to­1 strikeout-to-walks ratio as a junior at Life Christian High

The two infielders, Brezovsky and Lilley, will add depth to an Irish infield that could lose a pair of starters after the 2004 season in second baseman Steve Sollmann and shortstop Matt Macri, who may choose to enter professional baseball. Brezovsky batted .425 as a junior and is list­ed as the 65th best player in Florida by Perfect Game/Baseball America. Lilley was named the top second baseman in the state by The Buckeye Scout. 
Mainieri hopes that the recruits will come in ready to contribute in 2004-05, as the Irish stand to lose at least six players to gradua­tion and possibly more to the draft.

No. 2 seed Notre Dame (22-4,

dable opponent, in No. 3 seed Miami (22-8, 9-3). The last time these teams matched up, the Irish beat the Hurricanes 3-0 on College Sports Television at the Joyce Center. 

But it won't be as easy this time around. 
"The last match against Miami means nothing," Brown said. "It's another match and we have to prove ourselves again." 
That win was in front of a record 2,715 fans-the most for a volleyball match not played before a Notre Dame football pep rally. It was also a win in which Miami's star Valeria Tipiana only registered four kills after coming off an injury. 
On the other side of the net, the Irish have been led by sen­ior setter Kristen Kinder. She distributes the ball in a potent offense that includes junior Emily Loomis and sophomore middle blockers Lauren Kelbley and Lauren Brewster.

Six sign letters of intent 
Mainieri gets four pitchers, two infielders as early signees 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Sports Writer 
Irish head coach Paul Mainieri announced Thursday the signing of six high school seniors to letters of intent with Notre Dame during the early signing period. 
The group includes four pitchers -right handers Tony Langford and Joey Williamson and lefthanders David Gruener and Wade Korpi -and a pair of infielders in Ross Brezovsky and Brett Lilley. 
This recruiting season marked Mainieri's first without former associate head coach and recruiting coordinator Brian O'Connor, who took a head coaching position at VIrginia in July. But Mainieri was pleased with the work of his assistants, David Grewe and Terry Rooney, who is in his first year with the Irish after serving as pitching coach and recruiting coordinator at Stetson University. 
"David Grewe did an unbelievable job, while basi­cally he was the only one doing the recruiting, at the time when Brian [O'Connor] was deciding whether or not he would go to Virginia," Mainieri said. "Then when Terry Rooney came aboard -people get a chance to meet him and realize he's a very high-energy guy. He loves to recruit and he works hard at it, so when he got here, he hit the ground

Recent success sets high expectations for Irish 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
When Irish coach Mike Brey first arrived at Notre Dame three years ago, he pulled his players into a meeting room and told them he thought he could help them reach the NCAA Tournament -a feat the Irish hadn't accomplished in 11 years. 
Now, Brey looks back on those days and laughs at how the expectations have changed. 
Gone is the satisfaction with merely qualifying for the NCAA Tournament. Gone, too, is contentment with winning a tournament team before folding up against a more estab­lished power. 
team out. 
With each year, Notre Dame gains more experience, and its players appear less likely to pause in wonderment when they pass an old milepost. 
"What excites me is to hear our veter­ans talk about bigger things, playing deeper lin March]," Brey said. "That's not pipe dreams anymore. Those guys can really talk about this with the expe­rience that they've had." 
The centerpiece of Notre Dame's team is point guard Chris Thomas, who turned down the NBA for another year in college. His backcourt mate, sopho­more Chris Quinn, could, at best, help give the Iris.h one of the nation's top slate this year. The league re-aligned to form one massive 14-team division, and the Irish will play every team at least once. The three teams it plays twice are defending champion Syracuse, presea­son No. 1 Connecticut and perennial power Pittsburgh. 

There are other question marks too, like Notre Dame's relative lack of depth, that won't be answered until the season starts Monday. And the Irish won't find out who will replace graduates Matt Carroll and Dan Miller's remarkable point production until they tip off against Northern Illinois. 
But Brey and the Irish truly believe they will continue their improvement as a program. The Irish believe they are one of the nation's elite programs, and this season, they'll look to demonstrate it. 
''I'm really excited_about who we have back," Brey said. "When we think about this team all summer and watching them in ... practices, the six returning guys, that if we had to toss it up tonight in a Big East game, I would feel pretty good about it."

"Last year, we went to the Sweet 16. I think we should think nothing short of the Final Four [this year]," junior co­captain Jordan Cornette said. "We're thinking big dreams, and we want to go as far as possible." 
Each year, Notre Dame has steadily improved its postseason success. In Brey's first year, the Irish made the NCAA Tournament and won the opening round game. In his second year, the Irish pushed top-seeded Duke to the brink before falling in the second round. Last year, Notre Dame made the Sweet 16 before Arizona blew an awe-struck Irish backcourts at best and, at worst, a tandem that could wreak havoc on oppos­ing defenses. 
"It's hard for teams to guard two-point guards, especially Chris," Thomas said. "He can shoot, he can pass, he can han­dle the ball just as good as any point guard in 
the country." 
Notre Dame has typically beaten teams before by shooting them to death. Defense, on the other hand, is another question mark. And after Notre Dame's overtime win in a Nov. 14 exhibition, Brey seemed almost resigned toward the fact that the Irish would have to outscore teams to win. 
But Brey knows the Irish will need defense to face their tough schedule. It's no surprise that the Irish, who finished third in the Big East West Division last year, will face another tough conference

Strivin 
or new hei 
Eleven factors will lend the Irish to their fourth straight year of measurable improvements under the watchful eye ofhead coach Mike Brey 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sporrs Writer 
Every year of the Mike Brey era, the Notre Dame basketball program has made small but measurable improvements. Here are 11 key factors if the Irish want to see a fourth straight year of improvement. 
Chris Thomas' maturity 
When Chris Thomas withdrew from the NBA Draft in June, scouts told Brey the Irish would be getting a much more pol­ished point guard. Now that Thomas is one of Notre Dame's veterans, the Irish will be looking to him for leadership both on and off the court. 
Last year, Notre Dame's success was often equated to Thomas' success. When Thomas was on, the Irish were on. When he was off, the Irish struggled. That can't happen this year. 
In the early-season exhibition games, Thomas has still demonstrated the flashy playmaking ability that made him so good to begin with, but he also showed that he can take care of the basketball better. No longer does Thomas appear as eager to force things on the offensive end. 
If Notre Dame's top weapon has matured as much as the scouts say he has, then the Irish will be a formidable force indeed. 

CHIP MARKS!The Observer 

Chris Thomas shoots in a preseason Irish win against Hoop Group. 
The Thomas-Quinn backcourt 
Just how good can this backcourt be? Very, very good. 
Both Thomas and Chris Quinn have the ability to launch 3-pointers at will and both have shown they are adept at running the point. Where the genius of this pairing comes into play is when Thomas and Quinn rotate primary ball-handling duties during a game. Not only will it confuse defenses, but it will take the pressure off both guards who will likely be playing over 35 minutes every game. 
The point guard job will still be Thomas', but the presence of the equally-adept ball­handling Quinn in the backcourt will only help make this duo one of the best in the nation. 
Torin Francis' improvement 
In a rookie campaign that saw Francis earn all-Big East Rookie team honors, the then-freshman could either dominate in the paint or struggle against mediocre competition. While he improved as the sea­son progressed and wao:; a fiercesome pres­ence in the postseason, Francis knew he had to bulk up to establish consistency. 
That's why Francis walks around this year saying that he can't make the same mistakes he made as a freshman. And for Notre Dame's sake, he can't. 
The lrio:;h need to establish Francis as a scoring option early in each game, for it will free up Notre Dame's deadly 3-point shooters. Francis himself has to demon­strate that he can be a solid defensive stop­per as well as a reliable scoring threat to help the Irish as the season wears on. 
Torrian Jones' emergence 
For three years, Jones has passively played the role of the perfect teammate, deferring to more experienced players and coming in games when the Irish needed a spark only his athleticism could provide. But at the same time, Jones was one of the most vocal players in the locker room. 
This year, Jones finally gets to play the extended minutes he always wanted, but never complained for. He'll be expected to somehow replace Dan Miller as a potent defensive stopper while relying on his ath­leticism to penetrate opposing defenses to score and rebound. 
Jones has tremendous potential, and the Irish need him to live up to that potential. He's still a role player who knows he's not the No. 1 scoring option, but he's also going to get plenty of playing time. 
Jordan Cornette's versatility 
It would have been easy to be shocked that Cornette made four 3-pointers in an exhibition game when he made just six all last season. But while Brey jokingly says that Cornette isn't as good a 3-point shoot­er as he thinks, the junior forward gives the Irish a weapon that can exploited in multiple ways. 
First, Cornette is one of the team's most fundamentally sound players, with good footwork that often enables him to shut down his assignment each night. Second, he is effective at scoring both inside and outside. Third, his size quickness makes him diflicult to guard, while at the same time, Cornette can match up well against a variety of opponents. 
Cornette typically starts out each season with a bang -he had 19 blocks in Notre Dame's first two games last year -and on an Irish squad that struggles to play defense, the junior will be perfect as a stop­per. 
Depth at guard 
The Irish have Thomas, Quinn and Jones. After that, they're hurting for reliable options. 
Highly-touted sharpshooter Colin Falls has looked shaky in exhibition games, but the veterans on the team say he earned their confidence over the summer. Russell Carter has the ability to put points on the board in a hurry, but his defensive inepti­tude will probably limit his minutes as the seas"n begins. 
Notre Dame's top guards can match up well against any other guard group in the nation. But if the Irish get into foul trouble or somebody goes down with an injury, Brey will probably have a tough time -at least early on -going to one of his fresh­men. That's why the early season-games are so vital toward helping Falls and Carter gain experience. 

CHIP MARKS!The Observer 
Jordan Cornette looks to play a large role for this year's Irish. 
The big-man rotation 
Who Brey plays in the middle will depend on who the Irish face. Francis and Cornette will undoubtably see significant playing time, as will the team's biggest player, Tom Timmermans. And if needed, Jones can guard another team's big man. 
But Brey has been pleasantly surprised by Rick Cornett's improvement in early­season practices, and wants to fmd a spot for Cornett in the rotation. While he lacks Timmerman's size, he gives the Irish a more reliable scoring threat down low and is a fierce rebounder. 
Brey typically uses an eight-man rota­tion, which means some of the big men are going to see cutbacks in playing time. But which ones? 

BUG DAVISSON/The Observer 

Torin Francis grabs a rebound. 
Early start 

Notre Dame started formal practices the frrst week of September, before the Irish had even played a football game. They practiced 1 0 times before a foreign tour to Barbados, and will have had a full month between their foreign tour and their first game. 
Is the early start, combined with a gruel­ing schedule, too much? Nobody will know until February rolls around if early-season workouts will lead to late-season fatigue. 
The non-conference gauntlet 
Brey is a firm believer in scheduling tough teams to boost Notre Dame's all­important RPI rating, which is partially based on strength of schedule and is one of the factors the NCAA Tournament selection committee uses to select the field of 64. But the Irish face one heck of a stretch that could hurt them if they don't win enough. 

In addition to the traditionally difiicult Big East conference schedule -where the Irish face all teams at least once -Notre Dame plays perennial powers Marquette, Indiana, Kentucky and UCLA. Plus, the Kentucky and UCLA games come right in the middle of Notre Dame's conference schedule. On the other hand, Notre Dame fac(~d a tough slate last December of three consecutive top 10 teams -and beat them all. 
Time will tell if the tough schedule will help or hurt Notre Dame. 
February blues 
Since Brey has been the head coach, the Irish have typically stumbled their way toward the finish line each season. In it.;; last six games of the regular season, Notre Dame teams have gone 3-3 the last three years, and the Irish arc a combined 1 7-11 in February and early March (as compared to 48-20 the rest of the season). 
The schedule makes this February par­ticularly tough, too. The Irish have away games at Boston College, defending champ Syracuse, preseason No. 1 Connecticut and UCLA, plus home games against Providence, Pittsburgh and Connecticut. The "easy" game? Seton Hall, which was picked to finish sixth in a preseason poll. All the other Big East teams the Irish play in February were predicted to finish higher. 
The value of defense 
Notre Dame uses a 25-letter alphabet that begins with A. B, C and E. That's right, noD. 
Brey seemed almost resigned to having to out-shoot teams to win games, like the Irish have traditionally done in the past. And while the Irish have the offensive tal­ent to run away from other teams, they run into problems when their shots are falling. 
That's because Notre Dame is a lacklus­ter defensive unit. Ao:;ide from Cornette and Jones, easily the team's top defenders, the Irish are often more focused on scoring than stopping. 
The Irish must commit themselves toward establishing a dominating defensive presence, especially in close games. Then, and only then, will they advance deep into the NCAA Tournament.

Irish must rely on Batteast, Borton and Flecla; to make the differencefor this year's squad 
During her team's champi­onship run in 2001, Irish coach MufTet McGraw recruited the future of Notre DamP women's basketball, knowing her team would need a cou­ple of years to rebuild before chal­lenging for another title. 
Two years later, McGraw knows the next two sea­sons present that championship opportunity. 
Jacqueline Batteast, Katy Flecky and Teresa Borton are the three remaining members of that recruit­ing class, and all three have

Staying with­in striking distance until half­time was considered a pretty good game against tougher foes, and that's mainly what Notre Dame did against top teams. They would battle for a half before losing by 15 to 20 points.

and NCAA Tournament. 
Batteast must find consistency after having an up-and-down sophomore year. Borton needs to stay injury-free and be an everyday scoring threat after averaging eight points a game last season. 
And Flecky must make the greatest improvements, because she will switch from playing more inside to becoming one of the team's most important out­side threats, with the loss of Alicia Ratay to graduation last season. Ratay ended her career with the highest career 3-point­ing shooting percentage of all-time. 
How those three improve will determine how far this Notre Dame team goes in the 2003-04 season. They have the other pieces in place -a solid senior leader in La'Tania Severe, two outstanding sophomores in Megan Duffy and Courtney LaVere and an impressive freshman class with three pos­sibly immediate contributors. 
The X factor will be the three juniors and their ability to move from good players to every­game difference-makers. McGraw saw that kind of talent in the trio over two years ago when she recruited them to be a part of Notre Dame's future. 
Two years later, the future is now and the hopes of another national championship run rests in the collective hands of three junior players who can make this team better than sim­ply a good women's basketball team. 
They can make them a great one.
