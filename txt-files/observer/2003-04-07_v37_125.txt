undermine the United Nations, "fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars" and maintain American global superiority at all costs in order "to shape a new century favorable to American prin­ciples and interests." 
Sound like a conspiracy theory? It's not. The relevant interests have conveniently declared their positions on the Web site of the think-tank, Project for the New American Century (½"MV.newamerican­century.org). Check it out. 
Nor are these the rants and ravings of irrelevant fanatics. This group has defined the ideology behind the current U.S. for­eign policy. The powerful signatories to the Project's "Statement ofPrinciples" include: President Bush's brother, Jeb, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz (Rumsfeld's deputy secretary) and Lewis Libby (Cheney's chief ofstaff) -none ofwhom was elected by the peo­ple ofthe United States. 
In fact, the true rationale for the war on Iraq has never been examined or dis­cussed by we, the people, largely because it has been shrouded in secrecy and masked by absurd hints at a connection between Saddam and Osama bin Laden or by disingenuous justifications such as eliminating weapons of mass destruction {which, high-ranking American and British officials recently admitted, may not even exist). The real goal ofour leaders has been American control ofthe Gulf all along, as evidenced by a 2000 report released by the Project entitled, "Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategies, Forces and Resources for a New Century." 
As this report makes clear, Bush's cabi­net planned the takeover ofIraq long before the attacks on the World Trade Center. They were not even motivated by the human rights abuses ofSaddam's regime. On the contrary. they wrote, 'ihe need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue ofthe regime ofSaddam Hussein." 
Why? The New American Century strategists want to promote "American principles and interests." It is not immedi­ately clear what this phrase means, espe­cially given the domestic opportunity costs of maintaining a warlike posture through­out the world and the diplomatic costs of alienating old allies (not to mention the human costs of burnt and blown up Americans, Brits and Iraqis). 
A little context makes it clear enough, however. Halliburton, the energy con­glomerate of which Cheney was recently CEO, was awarded a lucrative contract to work in Iraqi oil fields just last week. Other U.S. companies with ties to the administration have been offered similar­ly juicy deals in the "reconstruction" of Iraq. "American interests," for this admin­istration, means big business interests. 
There we have it: an ambitious plan for world domination in service ofthe rich, paid for with our blood and tax dollars. And the whole thing is posted on the Web.

NBC correspondent dies from blood clot 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
NBC News correspondent David Bloom, one of the net­work's most prominent young stars and a near constant televi­sion presence reporting from the Iraqi desert, died Sunday from an apparent blood clot. the net­work said. 
The 39-year-old co-anchor of the weekend "Today" show was about 25 miles south of Baghdad and packing gear early in the morning when he suddenly col­lapsed. 
He never regained conscious­ness and was pronounced dead from a pulmonary embolism after being airlifted to a nearby

Thursday night along with a U.S. soldier when their Humvee plunged into a canal. 
Both Bloom and Kelly were traveling with the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division. 
NBC News had built a special vehicle, dubbed the "Bloom-mobile," to send striking­ly clear pictures of him riding 
atop a tank through the Iraqi desert. He reported memorably on the sandstorms that brieflydelayed American forces.

area with his wife, Melanie, and three daughters. After attending Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., Bloom started his career as a reporter for NBC-owned WTVJ in Miami in 1989. He joined NBC News in Chicago in 1993, moving to Los Angeles in 1995. 
He became a White House cor­
respondent for NBC in 1997, dur­
ing the Clinton administration. 
He reported on presidential 
races, the O.J. Simpson trial, the 
Washington-area sniper shooting 
and the Sept. 11 terrorist 
attacks. 
Former President Clinton said Sunday that Bloom's "integrity and good humor will be missed." 
"David Bloom was a smart, energetic professional whose enthusiasm for the job was evi­dent in every question he asked and every story he covered," Clinton said. 
Shaken NBC colleagues, includ­ing "Today" co-anchor Soledad O'Brien, paid tribute on the net­work's broadcasts Sunday. "It's a hard morning for all of us," Katie Courie said. 
Bloom. who had no apparent health problems, was indefatiga­ble during the Gulf War. He reported at all hours for NBC News broadcasts, and also for the cable outlets MSNBC and CNBC. 
On the Monday after the war started, Bloom delivered live reports at 2:22 a.m. ET for MSNBC, at 6:55, 7:09 and 8:04 for "Today," at 10:43 for NBC, 
10:47 for MSNBC, 11:12 for NBC, 
12:31 p.m. for NBC, 12:36 and 
2:33 for MSNBC, at 6:37 for NBC's "Nightly News." and at 
8:07 and 9:35 again for MSNBC, according to The Washington Post. 
"Given the fact that we're filing at all hours of the day and night, you try to pace yourself and get a little sleep," Bloom told the Post. "You're sleeping with your knees propped up around you." 
That may have been a risk fac­tor: blood clots frequently form in legs when they've been immo­bilized and travel through the body. said Dr. Harold Palevsky. chief of pulmonary critical care with the University of Pennsylvania health system.

Controversial professor released from prison 
Associated Press 
TEHRAN, Iran 
A university professor whose death sentence pro­voked nationwide protests until it was lifted by the Supreme Court began a one­week prison leave Sunday, his lawyer said. 
Hashem Aghajari, a histo­ry professor at Tehran's lawyer, Saleh Nikbakht. 
Teachers  Training

$125,000  bail.  said  his  

Although the death sen­tence was lifted in February, an appeals court must still reconsider the rest of his sentence, including 7 4 lash­es, a 10-year teaching ban and eight years of banish­ment to three remote cities. 
Aghajari was sentenced for insulting Islam and questioning clerical rule during a speech he gave in June in which he said that each new generation should be able to interpret the faith. 
His sentencing last November provoked the biggest student protests in Iran in three years and highlighted the power strug­gle between the country's liberals and hard-liners. 
Aghajari initially said he would not appeal the death sentence, challenging the judiciary to carry it out. But his lawyer filed an appeal over Aghajari's objections. 
Both the parliament and President Mohammad 
Khatami denounced the ver­dict. 
But hardliners defended the sentence. Conservatives, who dominate government bodies such as the judiciary and police, oppose reformists allied to Khatami, accusing them of undermin­ing the principles of the 1979 Islamic revolution. 
In overturning the death sentence, the Supreme Court ruled that the charges were not compatible with his speech. 
RUSSIA 
Mass graves discovered in Chechnya 
Associated Press 
ROSTOV-ON-DON, Russia 
Police in Chechnya have dis­covered four graves filled with disfigured bodies, many of them with their heads and arms cut off, officials said Sunday. 
Three sites were found in the northern Nadterechny dis­trict, usually a relatively peaceful area, Chechnya's Emergency Situations Ministry said. 
The heads and arms had been severed from the corpses, which were stacked in a shal­low grave and covered with soil, the ministry said. It did not say how many bodies were in the graves. 
Another grave with two bod­ies was discovered in the vil­lage of Solyonaya Balka out­side the capital, Grozny, the ministry said. The dead men's heads were wrapped in black plastic bags. Both bore signs of strangulation and their teeth had been knocked out, it said. 
Investigations were launched into both cases. 
Such grisly discoveries are not uncommon in Chechnya, where Russian forces have been battling separatists. Human rights organizations claim Russian troops are responsible for the killings, while the military blames the rebels. 
Also Sunday, the body of a pro-Moscow Chechen police official was discovered, an offi­cial in the Kremlin-backed administration said. The body of Madzhid Aguyev, the deputy commander of a rapid-reac­tion squad, was found with multiple bullet wounds in a car near the village of Itsi-Su, the Interfax news agency report­ed, citing the Chechen Interior Ministry. 
Meanwhile, Chechen police­man Ruslan Visarigov was killed by a mine near his home in the Shelkovskaya district, the official said on condition of anonymity. 
Rebels frequently have tar­geted Chechens who work for the Kremlin-appointed govern­ment. 
In other action, rebels killed four servicemen and wounded 10 others in attacks over the past 24 hours, the official said Sunday. In a clash near the vil­lage of Nozhai-Yurt, two rebels were killed and four soldiers were wounded. 
Russian forces fought a dis­astrous 1994-96 war with Chechen separatists before withdrawing. Troops returned three years later after rebel raids on a neighboring Russian region and after apartment­house bombings blamed on the rebels killed more than 300 people in Russian cities.

SOUTH KOREA 
N. Korea: handling of nuclear issue a prelude to war 
Associated Press 
SEOUL North Korea on Sunday rejected the 
U.N. Security Council's plan to discuss the standoff over its suspected nuclear weapons development. Meanwhile, South Korea canceled high-level talks with its communist neighbor. 
A South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman said the Cabinet-level talks, which were to have taken place Monday to Thursday in Pyongyang were canceled after the North did not confirm the meetings. 
"North Korea did not respond to our offer last week, and therefore the talks have been automatically canceled," ministry spokesman Kim Jong-ro said. 
Seoul had hoped to use the meeting to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its nuclear ambitions in return for aid and better relations with the outside world. 
North Korea called off two working­level talks with South Korea last month. 
The 15-nation Security Council is scheduled to discuss North Korea's nuclear program on Wednesday, and Pyongyang has said that any sanctions imposed on it will be tantamount to war. 
The U.N. discussions are "a grave provocation act intended to scuttle all [the North's] effort for dialogue and aggravate the situation on the Korean Peninsula," a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as say­ing by state-run news agency KCNA. 
The Security Council's "handling of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula itself is precisely a prelude to war," the spokesman said. 
For months, North Korea has insisted on direct talks with the United States to negotiate a nonaggression treaty. 
Washington has refused, saying a multilateral solution to the crisis was needed. The U.S. administration has been pressing the Security Council to adopt a statement condemning Pyongyang for failing to meet its obliga­tions to prevent the spread of nuclear arms. 
But KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying that the U.S. invasion of Iraq showed that Washington was not bound by international agreements. A nonag­gression treaty with Pyongyang would not necessarily avert war because it might not be honored, he said. 
It was not immediately clear if Pyongyang would drop its demand for a nonaggression pact. 
WORLD NEWS BRIEFS 
Friendly fire kills 18 in northern Iraq

NATIONAL NEWS BRIEFS 
Va. Tech reinstates affirmative action 
Virginia Tech reinstated its a_ffirmative action policy Sunday, despite assertions from the attor­ney general's offi.ce that some of its diversity pro­grams are unconstitutional. The school's Board of Visitors voted to rescind a March 10 ban on pref­erences for racial minorities and other underrep­resented groups in hiring. admissions and schc.,l­arships. The vote came after a four-hour meeting punctuated by outbursts from a crowd of about 250 people, most supporters of affirmative action. 
Bush and Blair review Iraq progress 
President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are meeting for the third time in a month to discuss the war in Iraq, but this time their agenda also includes peace initiatives in the Middle East and Northern Ireland. The reconstruction ques­tion has divided Bush's advisers and the United States and Britain. 
Prisons hold record 2 million inmates 
The number of people in U.S. prisons and jails last year topped 2 million for the first time, driven by get-tough sentencing policies that mandate long terms for drug offenders and other criminals, the government reported Sunday. 
The federal government accounted for more inmates than any state, with almost 162,000. That number includes the transfer of about 8,900 District of Columbia prisoners to the federal system. California, Texas, Florida and New York were the four biggest state prison systems, mirroring their status as the most populous states. But Texas. California, New York, Illinois and five other states saw their inmate populations drop compared with the year before as prison releases outpaced admis­sions. Some states modified parole rules to deal with steep budget shortfalls. leading to an overall growth rate in state prison populations of just under 1 per­cent from June 2001 to June 2002.

IN BRIEF 
Treasury changes debt borrowing 
Treasury Department debt managers intend 
to soon carry out an accounting maneuver 
that would free billions of dollars on paper to 
prevent the government from breaching the 
$6.4 trillion ceiling on the national debt. 
The step, announced Friday, is the latest in a series of moves Treasury has taken to prevent the government from defaulting on the national debt. 
Treasury is maneuvering because it has run out of room in its statutory authority to bor­row. It has asked Congress to boost the gov­ernment borrowing authority, a matter still pending on Capitol Hill. 
Mobil being investigated for bribes 
Federal prosecutors said Friday they are looking at Mobil Oil Corp. as part of the inves­tigation into bribes paid by Americans to secure lucrative oil contracts in Kazakhstan. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Neiman made the disclosure as businessman James Giffen· pleaded innocent to conspiracy. money laun­dering and tax charges. He is accused of extending more than $78 million in bribes in the 1990s to two senior Kazakh officials. 
Tom Cirigliano, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil said the company has no knowledge of any illegal payments made to Kazakh officials by any current or former Mobil employees. 
GOP to abandon Alaskan oil plan 
There will be no attempt to revive drilling in an Alaska wildlife refuge as part of a Senate energy bill, says the Republican senator who will guide the legislation. 
Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M .. said the Senate's recent rejection of a proposal to develop oil in the refuge has made it clear that another such confrontation will only fail and, perhaps, jeopardize broader energy leg­islation. 
This week the House signaled that it again will call for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil companies.

A new era for corporate America is upon us. 
New standards in financial reporting and new obligations to investors are being created. The effect these new standards will have on the 
future of business remains to be seen. 
What is certain is that everyone, in every field, will be affected. But let us not forget that the integrity of business lies on the shoulders of individuals. Beyond laws, beyond rules, regulations and processes, 
integrity is and always has been a personal responsibility and obligation. Integrity is about asking the tough questions, making the 
right decisions, and simply doing the right thing when the consequences are great and even when they are small. Over the past few months, PricewaterhouseCoopers has been working to help rebuild public trust from the inside out. By beginning a much needed conversation. Internally and externally. By helping to create new standards and accepting new responsibilities. By not only embracing the letter of the law but the spirit, as well. In the months and years to come, you too will have the opportunity to stand up and be an example of integrity. To make decisions that will have a profound impact on the future. We urge you to proudly accept this responsibility. We urge you to stand and be counted, alongside those who have already begun.

The moments of greatest faith often come in the deepest despair. Such is surely the case for First Lieutenant Dustin Ferrell. a 2000 Notre Dame graduate who was injured in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
A March 25 arti­cle in the VVashington Post told the story of troops who suf­fered injuries in Iraq and were flown to Landstuhl Regional Medical 

Center at Ramstein Mike Marchand 
Air Base in Germany. One of them in particu­
Undistinguished
lar, a member of 
Alumnus
the United States Marine Corps, had facial injuries and was on a ventilator, but still com­municated to an Army chaplain that he wished to pray. 
The March 27 Observer said that marine might or might not have been Dustin. But I believe it is, because that's the type of person he is. 
I believe that despite the fact that I've never actually met Dustin face-to­face. Deborah Sederberg, Dustin's mother-in-law and a reporter for the Michigan City News-Dispatch, wrote that he is "bright and funny and gen­tle." She, of course, knows Dustin bet­ter than I, but I believe that. I surmised those qualities from the many Inside Columns he wrote for The Observer while he was a student. Well, actually, only the first two qualities: "gentle" is absolutely not the word to describe his compositions, which had titles like "Bombs away" and hit with all the force and accuracy of a bullet from a sniper rifle. 
But I also learned his personality from the many e-mails we exchanged. 
While a majority of them concerned Viewpoint columns and idiots who deserved to be insulted therein, some of them were more personal. We kicked around the idea of meeting somewhere for a few drinks, but I wasn't 21 at the time and we could never seem to get our ducks in a row. He sent me correspondence (and praise for my Viewpoint pieces) even as late as last May when he was still a second lieutenant. He said he was "doing the USMC thing" and that he "spent some time in Bahrain but I'm getting ready to head home from Japan right now." According to The Observer last week. he wound up being deployed overseas again in January. 
His orders were to "float east," even­tually serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. According to reports. he was injured when a Humvee he was riding in overturned on March 22. I make it clear, however, that it was not a "Humvee accident" since their vehicle was being chased by RPG (rocket-pro­pelled grenade} fire. 
This is a sticking point for me because my grandfather was injured in the Italian campaign during World War IL His motorcycle hit a land mine and went speeding into an apple cart, which nearly severed his left leg. So, while he was technically injured in a "motorcycle accident," I credit the land mine for his wound and not the apple cart. Similarly, I assign the RPGs the blame for Dustin's crash because it wasn't anything like the "accident" that happens when a Ford Explorer rolls over. 
When the Humvee flipped, the impact killed the driver, but it crushed Dustin's windpipe. His life was saved by a fellow corpsman who performed a field tracheotomy, which sounds like a complicated medical surgery but is really a crude emergency measure consisting of cutting underneath the adam's apple and inserting a tube into the incision to allow air in and out. The medic who was brave and swift enough to accomplish that has the gratitude of everyone who knows Dustin. 
After being evacuated to Kuwait, he was airlifted to Landstuhl with other injured troops, where he. I'm sure of it, was the one who communicated his wish to pray to Army chaplain Colonel David McLean. I know this because in addition to earning an accounting degree, fulfilling the service of his ROTC scholarship, being the public affairs officer for the Navy ROTC. edit­ing their newsletter, editing Viewpoint columns, writing Inside Columns and spending time with his then-girlfriend Rachael (they were married last August in the Basilica). he somehow found the time to become Catholic while he was at Notre Dame. Father Jim Lies. his rector at Zahm Hall and the one who baptized Dustin into Catholicism. said he is "a model of all that we hope our graduates will be." 
He, of course, knows Dustin better than I, but I believe that, too. 
After being transferred to Bethesda Naval Hospital last week, Dustin was awarded a Purple Heart for his sacri­fice and service. 
I don't get as much information as those who are closer to him. so I assume he's still there. But since he is a fan of my columns, I know sometime soon he'll read this, wherever he might be: If you still want to get some drinks, Lieutenant Ferrell, they're on me. 
Semper fi.

Anticipating and worrying over the trip back home 
I just got back from our final confer­ence in Peace Corps. Most of it focused on the transition from life in an African village to life in an American city. And of course we talked about the 
government logisti­ 
cal nightmare of  Malte Uranga  
completion. It was  
also wonderful to  
spend time with  
the 18 people left  Li[ e in Africa  
in my group away  
from the stress of  
Mauritania.  

The realization also hit as I looked around the room that I made it. I made it through a difficult country to begin with, then there was 9-11 and now it is Iraq. I have seen an incredible out­pouring of support for America and I have also experienced hatred. My par­ents' stress levels mirror mine as they ask every time we have contact the exact date I will get home. 
The answer is I still do not know. It still depends on international rela­tions. It depends on if there are any more accidental bombing of civilians. It depends on if the protests in Cairo continue to grow. It depends on if I actually listen to my parents. It depends on if I let myself see how tired I am from two years here in this time. It breaks my heart. 
I came here with the desire to save the world. I know that everyone says that is impossible, but deep down everyone wants to do that. I saw the 9­11 attacks and the embrace of America by countries, kings and people who did not really like us. I talked to people at home about life for an American in an 
Islamic republic. We joked among 
Peace Corps volunteers about fighting 
the war on terrorism one girl's soccer 
game or computer center at a time. 
And in a sense I believed that and still 
do. 
Now we are the only Peace Corps representatives left in an Islamic republic and again they are giving us the option to leave. And again I do not want to. Tomorrow is the big meeting with details and options explained. Now there is a lot of speculation. Whatever happens tomorrow will be difficult because it will not be on my terms. Throughout my whole service I planned how and when I would leave the site and return to the United States. Maybe that will happen. But probably lots of people who have been with me from the beginning wi11 go. 
Most likely I will go. A small part safety and a very large part exhaustion with uncertainty and a need to go to the next phase of life. In a month, I could be in a coffee shop or in a car on a freeway. It sounds so safe and secure. It sounds so boring and aver­age. Here. I feel like I am doing some­thing for the United States and also the Arab world, some days positively and some days negatively. In America I will feel helpless. I will watch the 24-hour coverage of the war from a couch and complain about the state of the world. Here when I walk down the street to buy bread in the morning I am doing something. Home to me represents passivity.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Asian-American experience 
In June of my senior year at Tenafly High School, during our class's final hurrah together on our senior trip, my track coach approached me and asked, "So Ed, where are you heading to next fall?" I replied that I'd be attending the University of Notre Dame. 
I almost expected her response: "Oh, that's wonderful! But Ed. I know that people in the Midwest haven't been exposed to many Asians, so if anyone gives you a hard time, get out." 
What really irked me was that I thought I was being paranoid, pessimistic and too defensive about my premonitions of Notre Dame not being as accepting of Asians, but to hear this from a history teacher and track coach from my high school was very unnerv­ing. However, I still attempted to maintain an open outlook at coming to this school, hoping that college would be a broadening experience of diverse people, and if not that, at least diverse in thought and experience. 
But once again, I knew of Notre Dame's adamant Catholic tradition, its overwhelm­ing homogeneity and its conservatism. I don't think these characteristics are nega­tive attributes, but I think these qualities prevent Notre Dame from having a more open and broader perspective. I am not sure if it colored my outlook coming into the school or if I was simply seeing the institu­tion for what it was. 
I came to campus in hopes that things weren't what I assumed. But during my first taste of college life at Notre Dame, it felt as if the world was going in one direction, and I was going completely against the grain. 
I know this is cliche by now, but it still has an impact to see just how many articles of clothing are from Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, American Eagle. etc. It sent me the message that either I should conform or feel alienation. 
So I chose the latter. Then I thought to myself, "You know what? Clothing, music taste, all those factors are just personal preferences that shouldn't really matter." So I tried to talk, to explore and to experience new people. 
But somehow I would feel this constant sense of inferiority among a crowd that was quite different from me in terms of appear­ances, likes and dislikes and overall out­looks on life. Sometimes, I would be treated differently, either subtly or overtly. When conversing in a crowd, it is as if people don't even address or acknowledge you, that you don't exist in the conversation. Or I hear about other experiences in which an Asian is the butt of a joke. It's funny to everyone else, but it immediately singles the Asian kid out, creating self-consciousness and a feel­ing of inferiority to those who are Asian. 
I seriously wonder if I am being overly sensitive or defensive, but I talk to other Asians on this campus, and the subtleties and the lines drawn between races is clearly evident in listening to other Asian-American experiences on campus. 
People can hate and discriminate, con­sciously or unconsciously in their words and actions. Nevertheless, Asians on this campus are trying to educate rather than recipro­cate. We want to create understanding and broaden perspectives despite the struggles we encounter along the way. We want that true college experience, and hopefully you all do too.

In defense ofMoore's documentary 
In his Viewpoint column last Thursday entitled, "Michael Moore's gutterball," Peter Wicks claims that Michael Moore's Oscar-winning film, "Bowling for Columbine," uses lies and deception to further Moore's own political agenda. 
Mr. Wicks further criticizes Moore for his overabundance of expla~ nations for the problem of violence in the United States. In fact, Moore attributes American gun violence to one thing: a climate of fear. Moore mocks political activists who claim one party is culpable for the violence at Columbine. "Bowling for Columbine" highlights the various factors which create this climate of fear which distin­guishes America from other nations. 
Mr. Wicks attacks one such example, "the implied parallel between the NATO campaign in Kosovo and the Columbine massacre." Mr. Wicks terms this deception and idiocy. However, I cannot imagine the parallel was intended to suggest that NATO is analogous to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Moore simply uses these coincidentally simultaneous events to demonstrate the depth of the fear problem in our society. This ironic coincidence illustrates how fear influences our military as well as domestic affairs. 
Mr. Wicks also labels the South Park cartoon burlesquing American history "propaganda." Mr. Wicks himself notes that. by their very nature, cartoons are not intended to depict reality. This cartoon grotesquely identifies two historically controversial American organizations (the Ku Klux Klan and the National Rifle Association) that sprang up from fear. Moore connects the two orga­nizations only to suggest that they are both fruits from the same poi sonous tree. 
I grant that Moore likely edited his documentary for the purpose of persuading his audience. However, this hardly justifies labeling the entire film propaganda. Mr. Wicks seems to have missed Moore's core message: America is a nation controlled by fear. 
Maybe I am biased because I live in the community {Littleton, Colo.) where much of the documentary was filmed. I hope that Notre Dame students will take the opportunity to see this film and make their own judgments when it comes to campus April 24.

Bookstore Basketball: A tradition at Notre Dame 
Bookstore Basketball is a campus phenomenon unlike any other. 
Where else could your typical Joe Business Major square off against var­sity athletes and other campus icons? 
The fact that Bookstore, which began its 32nd edition on Saturday, just recently gained national promi­nence in the pages of Sports Illustrated last year illustrates not only the stay­ing power of such a popular event but also the mag­nitude to which it has grown since 1972. 
And every aspect of the tournament has contributed to its popularity and success. 
For starters, the fact that each and every game is conducted entirely out­doors is a unique aspect of Bookstore Basketball. This year's opening round -assuming today's games go accord­ing to schedule -will likely feature not one, but two days in which players will have to endure snowfall. 
In addition, in every year that I can remember, games have been won or lost by shots that are definitely affected by South Bend's biting wind. Driving rainstorms are not all that uncommon, either. It is a testament to the teams involved that they can succeed, or even thrive, in what can only be explained as less-than-ideal playing conditions. 
Then there are the players. From Joe Montana and Tony Rice, to those guys a couple years ago who covered them­selves in sandwich condiments, the players bring a great amount of appeal to the tournament, and not necessarily for their athleticism. 
Sometimes, most often in the earlier rounds, it is in fact the teams' lack of athleticism -most often as a result of drunkenness -that brings out a crowd ready to laugh and enjoy them­selves. 
There is an aspect of Bookstore that appeals to everybody. Whether it is watching your friends shoot airball after airball, or watching Notre Dame's best go all the way to winning the championship, the competition works on every possible level. 

Also, Bookstore Basketball is a quin­tessential springtime activity. Hypothetically speaking, the weather's nice -which is a rarity for South Bend -so why not take advantage of it while it's here? Soaking up some rays, while often just a byproduct of attend­ing a Bookstore game, is a great way to spend a lazy weekend afternoon in the midst of spring. 
Everyone on this campus knows that it has been deemed the world's largest five-on-five basketball tournament, but how it got there is a mystery to most. 
The first edition of Bookstore fea­tured 53 teams. This year's tourna­ment boasts 10 times as many, with that number peaking above 700 teams 11 years ago. 
The number of teams has exceeded 500 every year .since Bookstore Basketball XII, 20 years ago in 1983, which broke the 500-team level for the first time, boasting 511 teams. 
Fast-forward to this year. 
539 teams. Five players per team. That adds up to almost 2,700 students -roughly a quarter of the combined Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross communities taking part in one of the most popular of many Notre Dame legends. 
And that's just the players. 
Combine that figure with the average turnout for a bookstore game -which can vary widely from team to team and round to round -and you've got a solid majority of these three campuses turning out to support a worthwhile cause. 
That's right, not only do these hard­core players play for free, but they also donate a registration fee to charity. 
Just another Notre Dame trademark on a campus tradition that has never -and likely will never -be duplicat­ed anywhere else in the world.

The Bookstore Basketball Tournament is the largest 5-on-5 tournament in the world and has grown with each year. It began in 1972 with 53 teams, and reached a peak in Bookstore XXI with 705 teams. This year there are 539 teams participating comprised of faculty, staff and students from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's College and Holy Cross College. 
The tournament is held for the duration of the month of April and began this Saturday and the finals will be played on Sunday, April 27. 
In recent years, Bookstore Basketball has gained national atten­tion with their increased number of teams participating in the event. 
Additionally, former players have gained national recognition such as Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown in 1987 and both Adrian Dantley and Bill Hanzlik were chosen for Olympic basketball teams.

Bookstore Basketball has become a part of the Notre Dame community just as much as any other time hon­ored tradition at the University, with an added twist of humor. Not only do students dress up with themes and interesting costumes, some show up merely to make fools of themselves. It is an added comic relief to the University before things start to wrap up during finals week.

Everclear satisfies students 
By REBECCA SAUNDERS Scene Music Critic 
It was a cold and very rainy night last Friday when the Portland, Ore.­based band Everclear came to the Epcot Center of Notre Dame, other­wise known as the Stepan Center. Showing true dedication to ... well, something, students trudged across the. in spots, flooding campus with hope that this show would be worth the swim to the Stepan Center -they left satisfied. 
The show started off with the open­ing band Long Shot who, while very good, seemed almost juvenile. The dancing of the lead singer around the stage, at one point with the micro­phone cord wrapped around his neck, distracted from the music which oth­erwise was reasonably good. The sec­ond band, The Exies, was excellent. With a Notre Dame alum drummer from Keenan, the band was very well received -and they deserved to be. Their music was terrific and they are definitely a name that will be heard in the future. 
Then it was time. When the lights came up and the bass echoed through the building the literally dampened spirits of the crowd shot up. Starting off with a straight set of about four of their new songs, Everclear played for almost 20 minutes before a word was spoken. With plenty of cracks about the overly protective and conservative nature of the administration, Everclear quickly won over the stu­dent crowd. In their opening greeting, Art Alexakis, the lead singer, announced in a sarcastic tone that the tattoo-covered punk rock band had been asked to "lay off the profanity" for the night. 
The cracks continued as Alexakis introduced their newest single "Volvo Driving Soccer Mom," proclaiming 
that this song described the destiny of the women at Notre Dame. This comment of course was greeted by cheers, displaying the semi-blatant fact that the majority of the crowd was not composed of large enough Everclear fans to know any of their new stuff, but only their major hits (the song in reference being about how porn-stars become the "Volvo driving soccer moms" of the future). and as such just cheered at anything one of the band members said. However, this lack of a hugely dedi­cated fan base did not slow down the momentum of the show. 
Everclear started off with a good number of their new songs and then, about 45 minutes into the set, transi­tioned into playing some of their major hits, which boosted the energy of the crowd to whole new levels. 
Everclear exploited as much of the crowds· energy as they could. They asked numerous times for clapping, hands in the air, singing along, and they received each one with out even a moment of question from the audi­ence. 
This crowd participation made the audience love Everclear more and more as the show went on. The entire Stepan Center was filled with the sound of the crowd singing the na, na, na-na-na-na chorus of Everclear's hit, "Everything is Wonderful Now." 
The cooperative and enthusiastic show even led the bass player, Craig Montoya to declare the Notre Dame's show as, "the best fA'@%Aing college show we've ever had." 
This is quite a complement, espe­cially considering the restrictions placed on the band's content by the university and the venue of the Stepan Center in which they had to perform. 
Throughout the show there was even a steady dripping of water directly onto the hack area of the 


stage. Everclear put on a great per­
formance throughout their set and the crowd had fallen in love with them by the end. As if that wasn't enough, Everclear took the status of their show from good to excellent in their encore. Coming back onto the stage, each member had a very 
i. m p r e s s i v e solo moment as the band displayed their real musical talent. Then, in what ended up being a highlight of the night, the band invited a member of the crowd up to play a song with them. 
A random Notre Dame student, lived a dream when he performed "Santa 
Monica," singing and playing guitar. with Everclear. This performance was followed by Everclear bring up about 50 people onto the stage; they had to receive and sign a waiver in order to be allowed up onto the stage. This was explained with laughing by Alexakis, because well, that is just the way rock concerts go at Notre Dame. 
The performances of some of the students on stage were more memo­rable than much of the concert; the power of Everclear was on that stage, in every sense of the word. Some boys even tried to live their rock · n roll dreams by jumping off the stage onto the crowd, one was successful, the others met bitter defeat in the form of a cold and hard concrete t1oor. 
When the concert did end, most walked away very much satisfied and for the most part surprised that the show had been so excellent. Everclear's songs aren't all amazing musically, but despite all the weak­nesses the band may possess as a whole, they put on a terrific live per­formance. 
It was cold and wet that night. even inside the leaking Stepan Center, but Everclear came through as a truly professional and talented band and made what could have been a good show a truly excellent show.

Bright moments for Irish can't keep Mustangs at bay 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Sports Writer 
It was a great day for two Irish singles players and one doubles duo, but a tough day for the team as No. 49 Southern Methodist defeated No. 55 Notre Dame in a closely-contested 4-3 match Sunday. 
Junior tri-captain Luis Haddock and sophomore Brent D'Amico had personal proud moments, though, as they each triumphed over players ranked in the top 60 nationally. 
With both teams splitting the singles matches, the Mustangs, who moved to 10-7 on the season, were able to survive by securing the doubles point. 
Notre Dame, 6-11 on the season, has become familiar with close matches this season. Sunday's loss was the fifth 4-3 defeat for the Irish this season. Those losses were all to challenging teams ­No. 28 Indiana, No. 37 Florida State, No. 47 Northwestern, No. 56 Tulsa and now SMU. Michigan State and No. 50 Purdue are the only teams Notre Dame has defeated in 4-3 matches. 
The match culminated with four matches that extended to three sets, and with the top two flights finishing in final-set tiebreakers. 
Haddock, playing at the No. 1 flight, upset No. 55 Johan Brunstrom, 3-6, 6­4, 7-6 to put Notre Dame within a point of the win, but No. 87 Lukasz Senczyszyn prevailed over junior tri­captain Matt Scott to hand the victory to the Mustangs. 
D'Amico finished off No. 52 Gwinyai Chingoka, 6-4, 6-2 to obtain the first Notre Dame singles win. The Irish sophomore had never topped a player rated that highly before. 
After SMU's Peter Oredsson defeated Irish freshman Patrick Buchanan 6-2, 6-4. Irish junior Nicolas Lopez-Acevedo survived a three-set fight with Henrik Soderberg, 2-6, 6-3, 6-1, to tie the match. With the Sunday win, Lopez­Acevedo put to rest a three-match los­ing streak. 
After the Irish had tied the event, the Mustangs' Alexis Rudzinski put his team on the verge of victory with his defeat of senior tri-captain Brian Farrell. Rudzinski outlasted his oppo­nent 1-6, 6-3, 6-3. 
The Mustangs began strong by win­ning the first two doubles matches to leave the court. Eric Cohn and Ryan Mauck won 8-6 over Farrell and Haddock at the No. 2 position and Chingoka and Senczyszyn topped the duo of junior Ben Hatten and sopho­more Paul McNaughton. 8-4. 
The Irish did enjoy an upset at the No. 1 flight. D'Arnico and Scott, who were on a three-match losing streak together, claimed their second defeat of a ranked team this season Sunday. The Irish pair defeated the 55th-ranked partnership of Ryan Livesay and Dustin Taylor, 9-8. 
Notre Dame is now preparing for its penultimate home contest of the season when No. 61 Ball State comes to the Eck Pavilion. After that, the Irish will go on the road with hopes of improving their NCAA Tournament chances by upsetting No. 13 Kentucky. Then the Irish will complete the regular season back at home against No. 67 Indiana State.

Irish cancel_ spring opener 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sports Writer 
Snow was falling and the wind was blowing Saturday morning at 9 a.m. As a result. the Notre Dame Spring Opener was cancelled. The only home meet of the season for the Irish track and field squad was called off by the coaches over concerns about the well-being of the student-athletes. 
Notre Dame and Western Michigan were the only two teams on site, as Central Michigan pulled out of the meet Friday afternoon and didn't even make the trip to South Bend. 
However, Friday night's 10,000 meter race was run and the Irish quali­fied three runners for the Big East Championships. Brian Kerwin, Marc Striowski and freshman Kaleb Van Ort all qualified with times under 31:40, the qualifying minimum. Also finishing was Austin Weaver, who finished fifth in the first 10,000 meter race of his career. 
The Irish return to the track this weekend at the University of Missouri for the Tom Botts Invitational where they hope to encounter some warmer weather.

WOMENS FINAL FOUR 
Huskies, Vols will duel in final 
. Two No. 1 seeds will meet for the third time in the championship 
Associated Press 
With her offense down 
the stretch and her 
defense on the final play, 
Diana Taurasi put 
Connecticut back in the 
women's national champi­
onship game. 
Taurasi, bothered by a sore ankle and back, still managed to score 26 points and keep the Huskies on course for their third title in four years with a 71-69 victory over Texas on Sunday night. 
Connecticut (36-1) will meet Tennessee in the championship game, the third time the teams have met for the title. Earlier, the Lady Vols beat Duke 66-56 in the other semifi­nal to advance to Tuesday night's final. 
The seemingly inevitable meeting didn't come easi­ly. 
The Huskies closed the game with an 11-3 run to dispatch the Longhorns (29-6). who were in the Final Four for the first time since 1987. 
Taurasi's 3-pointer from well behind the arc gave the Huskies the lead for good, 67-66 with 2:07 remaining. 
Appropriately, Taurasi made the key defensive play, too, knocking the ball away from Alisha Sare as the Texas player attempt­ed to go up for a jumper just before the buzzer. 
Taurasi grabbed the loose ball and held up her right index finger as the horn sounded. Yes, the Huskies still have a chance to finish No. 1. 
Taurasi, who had not practiced since the region­al final in an attempt to heal, appeared a bit tenta­tive and pulled off few of the flashy moves that made her the best player in the country. 
But she came through when her team needed her most. 
With Texas leading 66­
60. Taurasi zipped a great no-look pass from outside the arc to Willnett Crockett standing alone under the basket, sparking the game-ending run. 
On Connecticut's next possession, Taurasi worked into the Iane, made the shot and drew a foul, leading to a three­point play that drew the Huskies closer.

The Longhorns went nearly three minutes with­out scoring, finally break­ing the drought on Jamie Carey's 3-pointer with 28 seconds left. That was the last basket of the game. 
Crockett gave Texas a chance by missing two free throws with 8.2 seconds left, but Taurasi made sure the Longhorns didn't get a chance to tie or win it.

The Longhorns pushed the lead to 50-41 with 12 1/2 minutes remaining, prompting Auriemma to call a timeout. Texas wouldn't fade away, and Taurasi had to fight through an uncharacteris­tic night. 
Grimacing at one point after a miss, she shot only 1 0-of-22 -including 4-of­11 from behind the arc. An 82 percent free-throw shooter, she went only 2­of-5 at the line.

Stacy Stephens scored 16 points to lead the Longhorns, but she missed a crucial shot in the final minute.

They went to the Final Four for the second year in a row in '87, but had not been back since as other schools notably Tennessee and Connecticut -became the sport's most dominating teams.

MENS LACROSSE 
Scoring streak helps Buckeyes topple Irish 
'l

By PAT LEONARD 
Sports Writer 
Matt Howell didn't play. That could have been one excuse. 
The Notre Dame mens lacrosse team had won nine of its previous ten meetings with Ohio State and simply took it for granted. That could have been another. 
But regardless of distrac­tions or statistics, coach Kevin Corrigan saw no excuse for his team's 11-5 loss to the No. 19 Ohio State Buckeyes on Sunday at Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium and seri­ously jeopardizing its chances at postseason play. 
"We weren't good in any phase of the game," Corrigan said. "You're not going to beat a good team when you don't have something to hang your hat on. You want to play well offensively. and you want to play wen defensively, but you can't get beat in every phase and expect to win a game." 
The Irish fall to 5-4 on the season and 1-1 in GWLL play. With a close call against unranked Denver last week­end and now a blowout loss to a league opponent, Notre II Dame feels it has to get its act ) together down the home
I 
stretch of its schedule. 
"We've got to decide what we're going to be," Corrigan said. "We're nine games into the season and we haven't established what kind of team we want to be." 
d 
In the opening moments of the game Sunday. Notre Dame was doing more than simply ! I) \ holding its own. They were

establishing themselves offen­sively. 
After the Buckeyes opened scoring, Irish leading scorer Dan Berger netted a goal at the 8:23 mark of the first quarter. Freshman attack­man/midfielder Brian Hubschmann scored his third goal of the season with 7:27 remaining, and Berger scored again at the 1 :07 mark to give Notre Dame the lead after one quarter. Freshman attackman Pat Walsh assisted on all three goals. 
From that point, Ohio State began to crawl back. The Buckeyes tied the game with goals at 11:52 and 11:41 of the second quarter. Walsh answered to put the Irish up 4-3. Ohio State scored two more goals, however. to go up 5-4 going into halftime. 
An early third-quarter goal by sophomore midfielder Brian Giordano tied the game at 5-5. But the Buckeyes rat­tled off six unanswered goals and took the GWLL game in what appeared on paper. and in Corrigan 's mind, as a blowout. 
Starting goalie Stewart Crosland made 18 saves in addition to letting up 11 goals. That amounts to 29 shots on goal for Ohio State and a whole bunch of questions for the Irish defense. 
Corrigan was almost at a loss for words. 
..We are playing poor funda­mental team defense right now," he said. 
More than just a defensive breakdown and an overall defeat, the loss to Ohio State means Notre Dame has some serious thinking and playing to do as they only have five games, and three league matches, remaining. 
..I think it means we need to win the rest of our games to go to the postseason." Corrigan said. "We don't know what's going to happen in the league. We can't worry about what other people will do, but we have to worry about what we want to do. We have to win the rest of our games because we control our own destiny."

to Beckstrom's grasp. 
A week into spring practice, the quest is well under way to find the player who can fill the void left by Shane Walton, Notre Dame's most decorated departing senior. Two-year starter Vontez Duff is firmly entrenched at one cornerback slot, and while Beckstrom fig­ures his experience gives him the inside track to the other opening, he knows he is going to be pushed by players like rising junior Preston Jackson and rising sophomore Garron Bible. 
But had Beckstrom been healthy last season, he figures he might have been the guy challenging, not trying to hold onto, a starting position. 
"It could be a blessing in disguise for him," Irish sec­ondary coach Trent Walters said. 
A year ago, Beckstrom was slotted as the third defensive back behind ·walton and Duff, likely to play only in situations where nickel and dime defen­sive packages were used. 
It could have been a disap­pointing end for a player who dreamed about start­an arm cramp. 
The doctors, however, told Beckstrom that the MRI results showed that if he didn't have surgery, he'd lose a lot of strength in his arm. A n d although he

season went on and I got healed, I wanted to play even more," he said. "It was the worst thing I've ever done as far as my ego, to sit on the sidelines." 
Despite the injury, Beckstrom refused to lose his trademark enthusiasm for football. While his teammates donned uniforms and pads on game days, Beckstrom's left arm rested in a sling while his right arm carried a clipboard. He ferried some players from the field to the telephone so they could talk to coaches in the press box and helped give

"I got a chance to sit out and see how the defense works and my responsibility and the game plan," Beckstrom said. "Now this year, I get a chance to go out and showcase my ability." 
His strength now at 100 per­cent, Beckstrom was able to begin working out with the team during preparations for the Gator Bowl and entered an intensive lifting program in the winter. 
Right now, Beckstrom is try­ing to impress coaches who only saw him on the field dur­ing a handful of spring prac­tices and even fewer fall prac­tices. He's trying to catch up to teammates who played an entire year in a new system that Beckstrom has committed to memory but hasn't yet put into practice. 
But he'd rather be rusty, as Walters jokingly described Beckstrom's progress, than finished. 
"If he'd graduated last year, he'd have played sparingly," Walters said. "This year, if he keeps playing well, he has a chance to be the guy."

Despite only being able to play one game in the 2003 International Showcase, Notre Dame's womens soccer team came out of the weekend in strong fashion by defeating the Mexican national team 3-1 Saturday. 
After a 2002 season that saw numerous Irish players miss time with injuries, the game against Mexico gave a glimpse into the 2003 season for the Irish, who were only missing starting defender Melissa Tancredi from the lineup.

Pruzinsky, sophomores Candace Chapman and Gudrun Gunnarsdottir and freshman Annie Schefter. all of whom returned after having nursed injuries at some point last sea­son. 
Freshman Erika Bohn also played very strong in goal for the Irish. 
"Erika has had a great spring," said Irish coach Randy Waldrum. "Also throwing Annie Schefter played very well. she is going to be very good for us. For Candace Chapman. it was her first game back and it was Vanessa's first full game in almost a year. For all that, we were very good defensively." 
"It was good to get everybody back," said junior Amy Warner. "They really did a good job and they make us so much deeper." 
The Irish scored at the end of the first half off a set play. Junior Amanda Guertin's free kick bounced off the crossbar. Mexican goalkeeper Jennifer Molina-Shea was out of position for the loose ball and Schefter put it into the net for a 1-0 lead. 
Early in the second half the Irish scored on a similar play. Freshman Katie Thorlakson's shot again hit the crossbar and Guertin scored off the rebound for a 2-0 lead. 
Fifteen minutes later, Notre Dame put the game away. Thorlakson passed to \Varner on the right flank. Warner flew past the defender and scored off the left post to put the Irish up 3-0. 
Mexico scored on a goal from Erica Audelo in the 75th minute to avoid the shutout. 
"Guertin, Thorlakson, and Warner are really starting to fig­ure each other out," said Waldrum. "All three had pretty solid games and it was good to see them on the same page. Maggie Manning didn't see a lot of minutes in the fall but has probably made the biggest strides this spring."

Canada had a 21-8 in total shots and a 6-4 edge in shots on goal but were unable to capitalize. 
Before the games Saturday, severe weather postponed Friday night's games. The games origi­nally scheduled for Friday were the ones played on Saturday. while Saturday's scheduled games were cancelled. 
Despite the weather. which included temperatures in the 20s when the Irish finally took to the field. Waldrum was pleased with the event. 
"At least we got the two games in," Waldrum said. "We had a fairly decent crowd of about 800 for the Mexico-Notre Dame game and it was still a successful event. I was really pleased with how we've made a lot of strides this spring. The last two weeks we've played very well. Mexico was very complimentary. There were two very good teams out there." 
The Irish spring schedule con­tinues with a game April 12 against Purdue before conclud­ing with home games against Missouri and Iowa State on April 
26. The Irish are 4-0 this spring with a total scoring edge of 1 7 -1 .

fast break with a weave offense that would have made the Harlem Globetrotters jealous. 
Steve Perry's vocal on-court leader, Matthew Cirenza, provid­ed some highlight reel entertain­ment late in the second half. 
Bringing the ball up court, Cirenza decided to call the "two" play, an intricate offensive sys­tem that involved weakside movement, numerous screens and precision timing. 
But he settled for a 3-point sky­hook instead. 
After hitting the basket, Cirenza held both arms high in the and yelled out that it was "the play of the decade!" 
Down 20-3 after Cirenza's shot, Capes was able to mount a come­back and cut the deficit to 16 before finally falling by the final score of 21-4. 
"The score doesn't really reflect our team's character." Capes forward Kristina Lundquist said after the game ... It doesn't accurately represent our ability." 
Asked about where the idea for the uniforms came from, Capes guard Katie Bell replied, "Just cause they're fun and we had them lying around." 
A jubilant Cirenza talked about his amazing shot after the con­test. 
"It was great," he said. "Someone said, 'What do you take in your coffee,' and I said, 'Kareem.' Get it? It's a joke, see?" 
All kidding aside, Steve Perry was very proud of its perfor­mance overall. 
"This was a classic battle between good and evil," said Steve Perry forward Ralph Pantoni, who scored three points in the game. "It was a classic David-and-Goliath matchup. And strangely enough, Goliath won."

1\ noon, as Team 457 knocked off Future Welfare Recipients, 21-4. Team 457 got off to an early 11-1 lead and never looked back, thanks to a shaky shooting per­formance by the team comprised of law students. 
.Between the Buns 21, PPP 13 
This game began as a back­and-forth affair, with teams exchanging baskets up until a 7  7 draw, but Between the Buns gained a lot of momentum by taking an 11-8 lead at halftime. PPP was worn down by the hus­tling Between the Buns squad, who dominated the second half offensively, both outside and inside, though they were hin­dered by a gusty wind through­out the game.

LeBron gave us a Hummer made it interesting late, pulling within 20-15, but it was too late, and a basket by Are You Serious? put the game away. Seriously. 
Bunion Predators 21, Cheese­

After falling behind 10-5 early, the Cheese-eating Surrender Monkeys made a run at the Bunion Predators in the second half, sneaking up to within two at 19-17. 
However, it wasn't a surren­der, but a late offensive surge that sent the Bunion Predators home victorious, knocking down two key shots to hold off the surging Cheese-eating Surrender Monkeys. 
The Matriarchs 21, Jenn Smells 2 
This blowout actually began as a 3-2 game in favor of the Matriarchs early on, as the two teams exchanged sloppy offen­sive possessions which eventually led to a few baskets. 
However, a more focused ­and sober -Matriarchs squad advanced with an 18-0 run to close out the disorganized Jenn Smells squad.

The game went from 16-9 to 20-17 because of the lackadaisi­cal defensive style of Azn Thug Ballers. Mounds Don't made it close, but turnovers cost them in the end, literally handing their opponents the game.

In the final scheduled match of the day at the bookstore courts, the upstart Amish Midgets squad were subdued and frustrated by the defense of the Naughty Foxes squad. From a 2-1 lead. the Foxes went on a run to get ahead at the half, 11-5. 
Using their tough defense once again. the Naughty Foxes were eventually able to string together a 6-1 run to close out the verti­cally-challenged female squad.

Belles blank Bulldogs 9-0 
By LISA REIJUIA Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's tennis team got back into the win column April 5 with a 9-0 shutout victory over host Adrian College. The Belles brought their 
MIAA conference record to 2-1 and are 10-2 overall for the season. 
Saint Mary's Jeannie Knish defeated Laura Kelley 6-3, 6-2 at No. 1 singles play. Fellow Belle Kristen Palombo was victorious over Liz Filipiak 6­0, 6-1 at the No. 2 spot. No. 3 Kaitlin won the first set over the Bulldogs' Sears and Lindsey Davis, 6-1. The Sears-Davis duo came back to take the second set 6-2. In the decisive third set, Cook and Mikulyuk secured the shutout for the Belles with a 6-1 win to take the match. 
"We played really well on Saturday," 
"The court was kind of a weird surface, so that took awhile to get used to. But we had fun and overall it was not too difficult ofa match'' 
Jeannie Knish junior 
Cutler beat Adrian's Cindy Krusienga 6-0, 6-1. 
In No. 4 singles for the Belles, Kris Spriggle blanked Heather Fraser 6-0, 6-0. Adrian's Shannon Sears fell to Elisa Ryan 6-3, 6-1 at the No. 5 slot. Saint Mary's Angela Sandner also won. defeating Sarah Kim 6-0. 6-1 at No. 6 singles.

The No. 3 doubles match was the closest contest of the afternoon. The Belles' team of freshman Lindsay Cook and sophomore Miranda Mikulyuk said Knish. "The court was kind of a weird surface, so that took awhile to get used to. But we had fun and overall it was not too difficult of a match." 
With the loss, the Bulldogs fell to 1-1 in the MIAA and 5-3 overall. The Belles were supposed to con­
tinue their road trip and travel to Chicago April 6 for matches against host University of Chicago and Carthage College. 
However, those matches were can­celled due to the cold weather and lack of indoor courts at the University of Chicago. 
"We were looking forward to playing in Chicago," said Knish. "There was going to be some tough competition there." 
The Belles resume play at home Tuesday against Albion College in an MIAA conference match.

WOMENS ROWING 
Irish upset No. 15 Hawkeyes 
By CHRISTINE ARMSTRONG 
Sports Writer 
The womens rowing team over­came rough weather conditions on Sunday to upset No. 15 Iowa. The Irish, ranked 21st in the nation, won four of its five races in Iowa City. 
Because of the weather, the usual 2 ,000-meter course was broken down into two 1,000-meter stretch­es. 
Coxswain Kathryn Long, Shannon Mohan, Kerri Murphy, Kathleen Welsh. Meredith Thornburgh, Kati Sedun, Devon Hegeman, Katie Chenoweth and Melissa Felker led Notre Dame's second varsity eight to two wins, taking the first heat in 
3:32.40. Iowa finished seconds later in 3:34.30. In the second piece, the Irish crossed the line in 3:33.7, fol­lowed by the Iowa in 3:35.16. 
Iowa secured two wins in the first varsity eight. The Hawkeyes won the first race by over four seconds and the second by almost five seconds. The Irish crew of coxswain Cassie Markstahler. Erica Drennen and Natalie Ladine. Alice Bartek, Meghan Boyle, Casey Buckstaff, Rachel Polinski, Ashlee Warren and Danielle Protasewich finished in 3:26.65. In the second race, Iowa finished in 3:28.42, and the Irish were seconds behind with a 3:33.30 finish. 
Notre Dame bounced back with wins in the varsity four races. Coxswain Kacy McCaffrey, Katie McCalden, Christy Donnelly. Katie O'Hara and Andrea Amoni won the first piece in 4:03.60, a solid eight seconds ahead of Iowa. The Irish barely escaped the Hawkeyes in the second race, though, with a 4:06.28 finish. Iowa finished less than a sec­ond behind them. 
The second varsity four crews only raced one piece, but the Irish pre­vailed yet again. The Notre Dame "B" crew of coxswain Caitlin Rackish, Kristen Mizzi, Sarah Keefer. Tricia David and Courtney Quinn took first place in 4:15.0. Iowa was second in 4:21.0, while Notre Dame's "A" crew of coxswain Maureen Gibbons, Ann Mulligan. Jacqueline Hazen, Antionette Duck and Megan Sanders was third with a 4:21.61 fin­ish. 
The Irish novice boats also had noteworthy performances in the novice eight races. Coxswain Shannon Lettieri. Pamela Jefson, Julie Lewis, Morgan Ertel, Danielle Stealy, Jenna Redgate, Catherine Schmidt, Andrea Doud and Sarah French led the "A" crew to a 
3:47 .01 win. The Hawkeyes took a close second in 3:52.91, while Notre Dame's "B" crew of coxswain Nicole Barczak. Meghan O'Neil, Megan Sheehan, Fallon Shields, Nikki Karis, Marcia Luttio. Katie Hanafin, Rachel Kemp and Laura Joyce finished in third. In the second race, Notre Dame's A boat won in 3:50.60, fol­lowed by Iowa in 3:58.40 and the Notre Dame B in 4:23.8.

SOFTBALL 
More rain holds Irish back 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Sports Writer 
As the Notre Dame softball team enters a new month of play, the last thing they want to hear is that old saying, "April showers bring May flowers." They have seen enough showers already this season. 
The Irish were scheduled to play two games in Providence Saturday, but that doubleheader had to be can­celled because of rain and snow in the Rhode Island area. 
In a season that just gets stranger every day, the Irish missed their 11th game due to inclement weather. Six of those games have been Big East con­ference matchups. 
"It's definitely not something we've been used to," said senior Andrea Loman. "It's never happened like this the past three years I've been a mem­ber of the team. It's just one of those things where Mother Nature decides to take its course and you can't do anything about it." 
The cancelled doubleheader versus the Friars is the third such Big East series that has been postponed the season. 
Earlier in the year at the USF/Wilson Tournament in Tampa, Fla., the team's scheduled games were pushed back a day after rain. The Irish were easily beating Rhode Island 12-0 in the fourth inning, but the game had to be cancelled so the team could catch its flight back to South Bend. 
At the NFCA Leadoff Classic, the Irish lost at least two games due to heavy rain in Columbus, Ga. Notre Dame also lost at least two games to rainy weather at the Kia Klassic in Fullerton, Calif. 
"[Losing these games] could just make us that much stronger,'' Irish sophomore pitcher Steffany Stenglein said. "Those teams that have been playing all year have a slight advan­tage, so we'll have to keep up our competitiveness even more." 
The Irish have been on a tear as of late, winning four straight against Purdue and Loyola (Chicago) while outscoring their opponents by a com­bined score of 24-5 in the four con­tests. 
"I think it just took us a while for us to straighten everything out," Loman said. "All three aspects of our game started clicking -hitting, defense, and pitching. I think we'll still play fine whenever we get back on the field." 
That is still the main question for this year's Irish -when exactly they will get back on the field. With fewer weeks in the school year remaining, rescheduling the missed games could grow more difficult. 
"The most difficult thing is that a lot of us will have to miss classes because ofrescheduling," Loman said. "A lot of us have projects due, so it puts a little more pressure on us." 
The lrish's next scheduled matchup is Wednesday in Pittsburgh, where they will attempt to make up the dou­bleheader against the Panthers that was originally scheduled for March 29. 
Of course, that series is weather permitting.

WOMENS LACROSSE 
Irish muzzle Huskies early 
By ANDY TROEGER Sports Writer 
After falling behind against No. 8 Syracuse last week, the womens lacrosse team knew it needed to get off to a strong start in their critical game against No. 19 Connecticut. 
The Irish got their strong start with a goal in the first minute as they rolled over the Huskies 15-7. 
"We knew that we came out a little slow against Syracuse and we needed to turn it around," said Mccardell. "It was a big game for us, being a Big East game." 
Junior Meredith Simon got No. 15 Notre Dame rolling with a goal 55 seconds into the game. The Irish controlled the first 10 minutes and finally cashed in again when senior defender Kelly McCardell's score began a three-goal spurt for the Irish that gave them a 4-0 lead at the 16:04 mark of the first half. Seniors Anne Riley and Danielle Shearer contributed the third and fourth goals, respectively. 
"We got off to a very good start," Irish coach Tracy Coyne said. "I thought our shooting was excellent and we capital­ized on a lot of opportunities. We have some objectives that we set in the pre-game and I think we met those pretty well." 
The Huskies finally got on the board with 13 minutes left in the half, but the Irish built their lead to 7 -1 at halftime on a goal by junior Lauren Fischer sandwiched between two goals from freshman Crysti Foote. 
The Irish used a strong defensive game, headed by a strong effort from senior goal­keeper Jen White, to hold the Huskies to one first-half goal while building the big lead. 
"I was really pleased with Jen's play," said Coyne. "She created a lot of turnovers; she had some interceptions and ground balls and some key saves. I also thought Kelly Mccardell played very well. The defense really just had a solid game." 
"We wanted to really come out strong," said McCardell. "We knew if we left it off for the attack that they would fin­ish it off for us." 
Notre Dame jumped out to a strong start in the second half as well, as Foote scored her third goal only 18 seconds in to make it 8-1. After a Connecticut score, junior Kristen Gaudreau scored on a free position goal and Simon added another score to push the lead to 10-2. Connecticut rallied to within five at 12-7, but the Irish added three more goals for the comfortable final margin. Angela Dixon, Jackie Bowers, Abby Owen, and Mary McGrath all scored in the second half for the Irish, while Simon scored a third time to provide the final mar­gin. 
Eleven players scored goals for the Irish. with Simon and Foote posting three goals each. Shearer and classmate Eleanor Weille each added four assists for the Irish 
"I think Danielle is doing a good job," said Coyne. "She obviously draws a lot of atten­tion and has been drawing a double team. She recognizes and finds the open player. I think four assists is great." 
The Irish had 31 shots to 19 fer the Huskies. Each team collected 19 ground balls. while Connecticut had 13 draw controls and Notre Dame hatl 11. With the win, the Irish evened their record at 4-4 (3-1 Big East), while Connecticut fell to 5-3 (0-2 Big East). 
"We've played a really tough schedule with a lot of ranked opponents." said Coyne. "When you play a tough schedule it really prepares you for a higher level of play and I think how we played today is a benefit of that." 
The schedule doesn't get any easier, as the Irish are in the midst of playing five consecu­tive games against ranked opponents. Next up for the Irish is a game at No. 3 Duke Friday, followed by home games against No. 16 Stanford and No. 6 Georgetown.

BASEBALL 
Irish distnantle Red Storm. 
By JOE HETTLER Spores Editor 
Notre Dame played 16 innings of baseball Sunday, scored 29 runs, collected 25 hits, allowed only three earned runs and won two Big East games. 
Not a bad way to end the weekend. 
Notre Dame used two offensive explosions and solid pitching from Chris Niesel and Ryan Kalita to sweep a doubleheader from St. John's, 11-3 and 18-3. The wins were the Irish 10th and 11th in a row, which is the fourth-longest winning streak in Irish baseball history. 
"Everybody's feeling really good right now," infielder Matt Edwards said. "It's big getting any Big East win. It's always good to win in confer­ence." 
Notre Dame jumped on St. John's early in game one by scoring 11 runs in the first three innings. Javier Sanchez tripled in teammates Kris Billmaier and Brennan Grogan to put Notre Dame up 2-0 in the first inning. Left fielder Cody Rizzo opened up the second inning with a solo homer. Steve Andres followed the homer with a walk and was driven in on a Steve Sollmann two-run shot to right field. 
The Irish put the game away in the third inning by scoring six runs, capped by an Edwards three­run home run. It was the first of two Edwards

SPRING FOOTBALL 
Beckstrom gets one more shot 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Spores Writer 
A preseason arm injury sent Jason Beckstrom to the side­line in what should have been his last season in an Irish uni­form. 
B u t Beckstrom, granted a fifth-year of eligibility, returns to the practice field hungry to earn a

long-eluded the Irish veteran, and a spot that, thanks to the injury, may be closer than ever

gave the rest of the game a valiant effort, but it was Beasts who eventu­ally prevailed as the victors. 
McConnell had something to say about each of his players after the game. 
"Jen Eves had a strong game down low. Amy Reiff played excellent 'D'. Kathryn Kinnier was our offensive powerhouse. Ivette Flores provided leadership as our team captain. Courtney Grattan ... well. she goes with the flow and hangs out. Basically just walks up and down the court and stands around," McConnell said. 
"She's looking forward to the post­game party," he added.

Maybe it was the green uniforms. 
The all-female Capes and Cowboy Hats were bamboozled and discom­bobulated by the all-male Steve Perry 21-4 Saturday in Bookstore Basketball action at Hammes Courts. 
Capes, so named because every member of the team was clad in a green cape and a black cowboy hat, simply could not handle the intense pressure defense of a hungry Steve Perry squad.

excitement of March Madness can indeed run into April. 
The game featured a thrilling first half in which the Beasts seemed to be in total control after jumping out to a quick lead. It was Slushies head coach Sean McConnell and assistant coach Dubber Johnson who helped maintain his team's composure. 
"Shoot," McConnell yelled at a play­er who had the ball five inches from the basket. Other times, he instructed his team to pass, dribble, or shoot at the correct hoop. 
The coach-player relationship was not monopolized by McConnell, how­ever. His teammates provided input right back to him throughout the game, as well. 
"My fingers, I can't feel them," said Slushies point guard Allison Christie early in the first half. 
The teams traded baskets back and forth, with the Beasts holding a 11-8 advantage at halftime. The second half got a little chippy, when a jump ball situation erupted between the two teams. 
A Beast tried to wrest the ball away from Christie, but the point guard remained firmly wrapped around the rock. Undaunted, the Beast simply decided to pick up Christie as well. 
Order was eventually restored, remarkably, and cooler -perhaps colder -heads prevailed. Slushies

If the first two days of the 32nd annual Bookstore Basketball Tournament could be summed up in a word, that word would almost. undisputably be "cold". 
With temperatures hovering in the mid-30's and the wind making it feel even colder, players were having trouble warming up -both physically and in playing their games.
