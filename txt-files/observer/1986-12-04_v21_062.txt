Teens arrested after $10,000 binge 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio-Two Cal­ifornia teen-agers took off on a cross-country binge of fancy meals and new clothes after finding a suitcase stuffed with about $8,000 in drug money, but their spending spree attracted police, who arrested them five days later. 
Raymond Salter, 13, and Marc Hairrell, 14, were picked up Sunday at Port Columbus International Airport with nearly $5,000 and a bag contain­ing less than a gram of cocaine. 
Each was being held Wednes­day on a charge of drug abuse, but Columbus Police Officer Floyd Wise said he would prob­ably seek dismissal of the charges so the boys could return home to Petaluma, Calif. A detention hearing set for Wednesday was continued until Thursday. 
"They were buying fine din­ners, riding in taxis and limousines," Wise said. "They just got mixed up in something that they shouldn't have." 
Wise said the boys told police they left California Nov. 26 after Hairrell found a suitcase that had been tossed out a win­dow during a police search at a Petaluma home. It contained an estimated $8,000 in cash and a bag containing less than a gram of cocaine. 
"They didn't even realize it was cocaine," Wise said. "All they saw was the $100 bills, the 50s and the 20s." 
He said the teen-agers flew to Chicago from San Francisco on Thanksgiving Day, buying tickets under assumed names. After spending a few days in Chicago, they flew to Colum­bus, where Salter grew up. 
The youths were arrested after police were told of two teen-agers leaving $100 tips with airport concessionaires. At the time, Wise said, the boys had ditched the suitcase and stuffed the money into their pockets. 

He said he charged the boys with delinquency counts of drug abuse simply to hold them until their parents could be con­tacted. Wise said the boys had purchased round-trip tickets, so their transportation home would be no problem once they are released. 
He said the cocaine found in the boys' possession had an es­timated street value of less than $100. 
During their spending spree, the boys bought new tennis shoes, leather jackets and a pair of stereo cassette players. They also bought dinners at ex­
pensive  restaurants,  police  
said.  
"They  went  through  about  

$3,000," said Wise. He said the boys had $4,993 in their posses­sion when they were arrested. 
Wise said he was astounded no one had reported the lavish spending earlier. 
"It's true. Money talks, with­out a doubt," Wise said. 
Theologians meet for symposium at ND 
Special to The Observer 
Several Catholic and Jewish theologians met Tuesday and Wednesday at the Center for Continuing Education for a symposium entitled "Teaching and Preaching about Judaism in Christian Parishes." 
The symposium began Tues­day with a presentation by Eugene Fisher, executive sec­retary of the National Confer­ence of Catholic Bishops' Secretariat for Catholic-Jewish Relations. Fisher spoke on "The Presentation of Jews and Judaism in Catholic Teaching and Preaching." On Tuesday evening, Rabbi Leon Klenicki, director of the Department of Interfaith Affairs of the Anti­Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, gave a presentation en­titled "Objects and Subjects of Faith: How We Teach Each Other." On Wednesday mor­ning both Fisher and Klenicki led an informal seminar on "Theological Education and Christian Jewish Relations." 
Eugene Fisher has held his present post in the Bishops' Conference since 1977, the first layman so appointed. A mem­ber of the Vatican Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews, he has lectured and pub­lished widely on relations be­tween Christianity and Judaism. 
Rabbi Klenicki, a native of Argentina, began his schooling in Buenos Aires and in 1967 received his rabbinical di­ploma from the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Re­ligion in Cincinnati. The follow­ing year he delivered the major paper representing the Jewish community at the first Latin American meeting of Catholics and Jews in Bogata, Columbia, during the visit of Pope Paul IV to that country. 

The symposium was spon­sered by the Department of Theology with funds from the Crown-Minow Endowment for Jewish Studies. The purpose of the Endowment, is to encour­age exchange and understand­ing between Judaism and Christianity and to advance Jewish studies at Notre Dame by bringing together scholars and religious leaders for a se­ries of lectures, dialogues and symposia for faculty members, students and the South Bend community.

Mating season was over weeks ago but a wild moose in Shrewsbury, Vt. is still making cow eyes at a brown and white Hereford named Jessica. When farm owner Larry Carrara spreads grain for his cows, the moose stands up and nudges a few cows aside to let Jessica eat. "He always watches out for Jessica," Carrara said. "He's acting like he likes it here. He's playing like a big shot," game warden Donald Gallus said Tuesday, 40 days after the love-struck moose wandered in to civilization. -Associated Press

Reaching 21 means another step in student's road 'over-the-hill' 
"Can I see your I.D?," the bartender will say with a cynical tone in his voice tonight. Those are the ominous words which strike fear into undergraduates everywhere. My impulse will be to turn around and walk out. I have been spotted. 
"Can I see your I.D.? ," the bartender will ask again impatiently. "What should I do?," I'll think, "I'm caught." 
It doesn't matter anymore, fortunately. Today is December 4th and I have been waiting 21 years for this particular day. Today I join the ranks of the "legal."
No matter how closely a bartender or boun­cer scrutinizes my Indiana driver's license, he can now find a true 21-year old who wants to patronize his establishment. 
Over the past few years I have had the op-Portunity to be legal on a temporary basis in states with lower drinking ages, but turningthe big "2-1" always marked the last hurdle to adulthood while growing up in Indiana, which always had a 21-year old limit. 

"Give me a Bud" seems to be the last sig­nificant phrase to master after a series of hurdles in the road to becoming adult. At first glance reaching the age of 21 means the phrase "over-the-hill" is not very far away. 
Of course this isn't correct. Along the trip over-the-hill I will encounter other phrases: 'what do I want for a career', 'for better and for worse', 'mama... dada', but these are only found in adult life. There are other obstacles to encounter, and now that I am adult I have to be ready for the challenge. 
It couldn't have been that long ago when my only goal was to reach double digits, the age of 10. That hurdle was long forgotten by the time I had grown up and reached the teen years. This is when my regular income began (in the form of allowance). All too soon this source will stop and I will have to search for other funding. Letters like IRS will replace the ABC's. 
Time passed until the first date occurred, the big moment. Another hurdle survived when you find out she really did like me. Now, the stakes are a little higher as I begin to search for someone to say "I do." The debate about what to do on a date changes into how many little Bearby's will be running around the house. 
There were the important occasions when "Big Wheel" turned into a 10-speed bike. Soon after, the next milestone followed as I ner­vously passed my driver's test. I now had a driver's license. It was then I should have realized that just four short years later that

The superficial goals of aging I had attained became a little more meaningful as I cast my first ballot. "The right to vote" was more than just a vote for homecoming queen. There was some responsibility now, something which was a foreshadowing that I will make a dif­ference in "the big picture." 
High school graduation marked a real transition, going away from home to a new setting. Adulthood was just around the corner, time to grow up, I thought. Fortunately I had a little extra time, for despite the growing process there is also a balance of lighter roo­ments. 
I find that just as I have surpassed one set of goals for the first 21 years more loom ahead of me. There seems to be a parallel of expe­riences from youth to adulthood and as the next 21 years begin. 
The future is rather intimidating, but so was growing up. 
I realize I have reached the verge of adul­thood as I look at my I.D., getting it ready for its first real use. If the true indication of he-coming adult is when I am no longer carded by the bartender I am glad that my I.D. pic­ture looks like I am only 18. It's just as well I will be carded for a few years to come be­cause I'm not ready to grow up entirely. 
Come to think of it, I wouldn't mind being carded for the rest of my life. No one should be able to grow up completely because there is always another challenge to meet.

Army to wait to destroy old nerve gas 

Associated Press 
LEXINGTON, Ky. -The Army apparently will wait an additional six months before deciding how to destroy ob­solete nerve-gas weapons stored in Kentucky, Indiana and six other states, the Lexi­ngton Herald-Leader reported Wednesday. 
The official announcement of the delay should be made Friday, according to the news­paper. 
"We are not in a position to confirm it, but we are in a po­sition to say it (delay) is very probable," said Larry Van Hoose, administrative assis­tant to U.S. Rep. Larry J. Hop­kins, R-Lexington. 
Hopkins already has told Army officials he would resist a "potentially catastrophic and profoundly dangerous rush to judgment." 
The Army's environmental impact statement, explaining its plans for disposing of the na­tion's stockpile of aging chemi­cal weapons, was scheduled for release Dec. 30. It was to be followed in January by an offi­cial decision by Secretary of the Army John 0. Marsh Jr. 
The timetable evidently has changed. "We have reason to believe it is being pushed back by as much as six months," said John Chambers, press sec­retary for Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky. 
An Army spokeswoman said "we are taking a hard look at the schedule," but declined to confirm any change in plans.

that our credibility has been damaged by this entire episode and its aftermath." 
Bush said the shaping of the Iranian policy involved diffi­cult choices and was clouded by the way in which the presi­dent's goals were executed, "specifically allegations about certain activities of the Na­tional Security Council staff. Clearly, mistakes were made." 
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in France on an official trip, said Reagan received bad advice from aides advising him on a new policy toward Iran. "What he was trying to do was to open an agreement and an arrange­ment with people whom he had been advised were of a far dif­ferent character than the people he was quite properly denouncing as being fanatical lunatics in Iran. 
"I think unfortunately some of that advice has not turned out to have been accurate or correct," Weinberger said. 
Meanwhile, Transportation Department documents show that a former CIA air transport company, said to have played key roles in both arms sales to Irans and shipments to the Nicaraguan rebels, flew more than 400 tons of cargo this year into an air base used by an American-manned Contra resupply operation.

'Blanket of soot' may be raising temps around North Pole, government study says 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A warm blanket of soot may be raising temperatures around the North Pole by ab­sorbing newly arriving sun­light as well as light reflected from the icecap below, government scien­tists reported Wednesday. 
"One pollution plume we encountered on a flight over the icecap off Barrow, Alaska, last March was the equivalent of five of six large power plants putting all their effluents in a single 
plume,"  said  Dr.  Russell  
Schnell  of  the  National  
Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  

Administration. 
The pollution "was about 100 miles wide and 1,000 feet deep, and when we first flew into it we thought we had flown into the plume of a vol­canic eruption. We didn't believe the instruments on the aircraft," Schnell said in a statement. 

The NOAA report was based on a five-nation study of the haze that has been ob­served over the Arctic region in the last three decades. 
This haze layer has been reported as much as 18,000 feet thick and scientists have expressed concern about its warming the Arctic climate, although they remain unsure of the exact effects as yet. 
There have been reports of a reduction in the amount of pack ice in the Arctic in recent years, although direct evidence has not yet tied this to the pollution layer. 
The average surface tem­perature of the Earth has risen slightly in recent years, probably a result of the so-called greenhouse ef­feet in which the increas­ingly polluted atmosphere traps more heat from the sunlight. 
The Arctic pollution prob­ably moves north from in­dustrial and chemical com­plexes in eastern Europe and Asia, NOAA said. Ex­aminations of air flow and a chemical analysis of the pol­lution indicate that some of the soot traveled as much as 4,000 miles, Schnell re­ported. 
Another participant in the study, Tony Hansen of the University of California's Lawrence Berkeley Labora­tory, said that at times the Arctic pollution exceeded levels measured over the At­lantic Ocean off the coast of New Jersey. 
Hansen said on one test flight carbon soot in the Arctic region was measured at 700 nanograms per cubic meter, while the highest con­centrations found in the New Jersey studies last January were 500 nanograms per cubic meter. A nanogram is about one-billionth of the weight of a typical paper clip. A cubic meter is a little more than a cubic yard of air. 

'Nuclear winter' test scrubbed after crash 
Associated Press 
SAN DIMAS, Calif.-A long­awaited experimental brush fire to study whether smoke and dust from an atomic war would trigger a "nuclear win­ter" was scrubbed Wednesday after a helicopter crashed while igniting a test burn. 
The pilot escaped serious in­jury, but the accident left in doubt when the $750,000 experi­ment would be performed. 
Gordon Rowley, fuels man­agement officer for the U.S. Forest Service and the official with the final say on the burn, said the fire would be res­cheduled for Friday at the ear­liest. If it does not take place by Dec. 15 or 16, it will probably have to be delayed until June because of difficulty in assem­bling the needed firefighting aircraft under favorable wea­ther conditions, he said. 
Two of the planes that were to have observed the burn promptly left the area to watch another, smaller controlled

Diego, said Bernie Zak, scien­
tist with Sandia National Lab­
oratory in New Mexico. 
"It's very disappointing," 
said Joel Levine, atmospheric 
chemist for the National 
Aeronautics and Space Admin­
istration. "No other experi­
ment will answer the questions 
we were planning to address. I 
think everyone's disap­
pointed." 
The chopper was dumping 
thickened gasoline to start a 5­
acre preliminary burn around 
10:40 a.m. when the cable suspending the torch from the bottom of the aircraft snagged on telephone lines, causing the crash, county fire Capt. Garry Oversby said. He said smoke from the test burn may have blocked the pilot's view of the wire. 
Eyewitness Bob Turr, a helicopter pilot reporting for radio station KFWB, said the Los Angeles County Fire De­partment "heli-torch" chopper caught on a wire across Lodi Canyon and lost its tail. He said the pilot escaped the wreckage, but the helicopter tumbled down the canyon afterward. 
"He went through the smoke, and at the very top of the ridgeline there is a set of . . . wires. What happened was the copter came across those ... wires and snagged. The front portion of the helicopter rolled over and went down the hill, disintegrating,'' Turr said. 
Helicopter pilot ·Gary Lineberry, 46, of Valencia suf­fered "some minor abrasions on his forehead,'' said chief nurse Pat Titus at Foothill Presbyterian Hospital in Glen­dora. 
Oversby said the Bell 260 helicopter was badly damaged. The tail rotor dug into the ground, breaking on impact, he said. A piece of the rotor flew off and hit the door of a nearby Forest Service fire truck car­rying several people, but none of them were hurt. 
About 200 scientists and firefighters had gathered near Johnstone Peak, 30 miles north­east of downtown Los Angeles, to observe the oft-delayed burn. The controlled fire, which was to have consumed 320 to 480 acres, had been ex­pected to create a 10,000-foot­tall smoke plume for study, said Philip Riggan, the U.S. Forest Service's scientist-in­charge of the experiment.

ND speech and debate team made 'marked improvement' this year 
By Lisa Davison 
News Staff 
Members of the inexperi­enced Notre Dame Speech and Debate team made a "marked improvement" this year, win­ning prizes in four tourna­ments, said Frank Guliuzza, Director of Forensics. 
"At this point last year, they hadn't won anything. This year we've won eighteen trophies and awards," Guliuzza said. 
Guliuzza added that he is pleased by his team's success, especially because of their youth and inexperience at the college level. "They are a very young team with a lot of poten­tial," he said. "I think they could be a really strong group if they work hard. The only thing that would hold them back would be lack of effort." 
Guliuzza said he hopes to help qualify students for the National Individual Events Tournament and help the team

qualify for the National Debate Tournament. "As a team, we want to build a balance be­tween debaters and those in in­dividual events, a competitive squad as opposed to a star team," he said. 
Dominic Alfaro and Sean O'Donnell competed and qualified for a national compe­tition. "They are two of the more experienced so they can add some leadership," Guliuzza said. 
Guliuzza does some recruit­ing among incoming freshmen with an interest in forensics but students basically discover the team by "word of mouth" said Guliuzza. 
Sophomore Rob Hennig said he sought out the program him­self last year. "The people who are on the team now are people who have tried to find the pro­gram," he said. 
Guliuzza said that Hennig has performed well. "It's Hen­nig's first year of competition. He had a lot of experience in high school. He's done very well in both debate and individ­ual events," he added. 
Hennig said the two seperate events have advantages. "I can appreciate both," Hennig said.

"You're learning to think on your feet." 
Hennig and teammates Mike Monberg, John Failor, and Paul Bielski won first and second place in the Junior Debate division at a tourna­ment at Wayne State Univer­sity in October. 
Earlier in October, Hennig, Failor, Bielski and :Steve Rawlings captured third place finishes in the Novice Debate division at a tournament at the University of Denver. 
Guliuzza said Notre Dame hosted a debate tournament early in November. "Schools from five different states atten­ded and Notre Dame won the team championship, but as host school, declined the team award," Guliuzza said. Peggy Kramer and Alfaro won first place awards in the tourna­ment. 
According to Guliuzza, the good teams are from the tradi­tionally academically-oriented schools such as Harvard and Northwestern. He said he wants Notre Dame to be in­cluded in this group, because "it would be a real boon for Notre Dame to be strong again in speech and debate." 
Hennig said, "What we need, I think, to build an effective program is more resources, more support from the univer­sity in the form of graduate as­sistance and office space." 
For the rest of the year the team will prepare for regional tournaments, Guliuzza said.

Buying personal clock cannot solve bell dilemma 
Don't panic! This crank epistle is about an entirely new subject. The new subject does not pose real heavy ethi­cal, moral, or legal questions; so all the titled sages in the dome need not dive for their foxholes. The new subject is bells. Just bells. Hang in, while a nar­rative historian narrates a tale. 
Bob Kerby 
guest column 
In early September, having noticed that the class bells were not ringing, I started calling this office and that to ask that the bells be turned on. I phone every September because the bells never work when the University first convenes. In years past, the various people I called-clerks, secretaries, ad­ministrative assistants, and one asso­ciate dean -often explained that admi­nistrators don't like the bells; so they forgot to turn them on. I then reminded them that teaching is, after all, one of the minor peripheral functions of this institution, whether administrators liked it or not. Usually, those whom I surprised with this revelation got the bells turned on, bye and bye. 
This September, my fifth telephone call turned up a secretary who told me that "someone" in the dome had decided not to turn on the bells this year. That was a new excuse. So I called the dome. I talked to the assistant registrar in charge of all the Univer­sity's bells. He was most congenial and most eager to oblige. He assured me that he would fix everything. I mar­velled at the efficiency with which a single bushleague teacher's petition through channels galvanized the dome to decisive action. I put my trust in the 
dome. A couple of weeks passed. Then I began hearing bells. I heard them at 
6:55 am, 7:45 am, 8:00 am (I get to work early!), and etcetera. I heard them until9:15 am. Then, at 9:15, they quit. No more bells. That seemed odd. 
So again I called the assistant registrar about the bells. He promised to check it, right away. He checked it. About two weeks later, we had bells from 8:00am to 2:15pm. They quit at 
2: 
15. After 3 pm, true, all the bells went berserk, ringing damn near every min­ute on the half-minute; but at least until 

2: 
15 they worked like they were sup­posed to work, starting and ending classes on schedule. That was progress, if not yet perfect. 


So again I called the assistant registrar about the bells. So did lots of other folks. Some complained about missing bells. Some complained about berserk bells. The assistant registrar said he'd fix it. He even prepared to summon first-class professional bell­fixers from the professional bell-fixers' guild. 
Then -the Monday before fall break somebody told the assistant registrar that, last spring, the clique that makes decisions hereabouts had decided never to ring the class bells again. Needless to say, this high-powered policy deci­sion had not been published, or an­nounced, or explained. And, needless 
to say, this high-powered decision was made by clowns who don't teach. 
Nobody had told the faculty about this decision. Nobody had even told the as­sistant registrar. Granting that the dome seems unable to tell anybody else what is going on, one must now wonder about the quality of coordination within the dome itself. Should not somebody have told the assistant registrar that all his bells were to be turned off last spring? 
I proposed an instant solution: why not put clocks in classrooms? The Great Republic has been mass­producing wall clocks since 1814, so the technology should be adequate by now. At first, the proposal met some obsta­cles. First, the assistant registrar told me that classrooms already had clocks. That surprised me because no matter how hard I looked, I could not find any clocks in the classrooms I was teaching in. Second, the assistant registrar of­fered to buck my inquiries to a coord­inator in charge of clocks. Can the co­ordinator really make policy decisions, queried I? No, said the assistant registrar, but she can listen real well. I didn't really want somebody to listen real well. I wanted somebody who could start and stop classes on time. So I told the assistant registrar, who had promised to fix everything 'way back in September' to get a clock into my classroom. Like now! 
A couple more weeks passed. Still, no clock. So, one day, I went to G. L. Perry's five-and-dime and purchased an Ingraham battery-driven quartz wall clock, plus all the fixings, for $13.31. The batteries would need chang­ing, now and then, but I figured that would give an unemployed assistant registrar in charge of bells something to do. I sent the bill to the dome. 
Just as I was about to mount my clock, a Seth Thomas plug-in clock ap­peared in my classroom. The first time I saw it, it was running about 25 minutes slower than the rest of the cosmos. Next time, it was only 6:22 minutes late. The third time, I climbed on a chair to reset it, despite my age, decrepitude, and general blubbery infirmity. At least I got the time right. 
Debates exemplify the spirit of education 
Dear Editor: 
Just as students often moan about their teachers, it is commonplace to hear faculty mumbling and grumbling about the lack of interest Notre Dame students supposedly show concerning current events, intellectual matters and, in general, anything other than romance, sports and grades. In this context, I find the news of a series of serious, substaantial debates being or­ganized and conducted by Grace Hall students, under the direction of Assis­tant Rector Joseph McKenna, worth noticing and comment!Jlg upon. 
I want first of all, to heartily congrat­ulate these students and McKenna for their work. I am pleased, very pleased, to know that these students of Grace Hall, outside of their classes, are taking the time to debate and learn about top­ics such as the role of women in the Church, gun control, immigrant legis­lation and public school sex education. McKenna and the students involved are, in my opinion, setting a very fine example for members of other dorms; I hope to see the idea of organization of and participation in such debates spread across campus until the day that all of our students are involved in debat­ing the issues of the moment, as well as more perennial issues. 
The example set by Grace provides a fine model of self-education (students educating other students, students educating each other in a setting that does not require faculty lecturing and students memorizing) that may, in the end, be just as important for intellec­tual moral development as any of the classes that we teach here.

"We are gathering together to ed­ucate ourselves and others in order to grow in the power of our common sis­terhood, to lead us to an understanding of our responsibilities in the world today, and to the action we must take accordingly." This was the beginning of an invitation proposed last year at this time in this same column, an in­vitaion to join a group of students con­cerned with social justice: Women United for Justice and Peace. We began our efforts with a celebration of Rosa Parks Day. Since then we have engaged in many activities and our numbers have grown.

The fourth time, I went to my class­room and somebody had kidnapped my Seth Thomas's clock. Darned if I know who is holding the Seth hostage. All I know is that since Seth's disap­pearance, I have been teaching my classes both bellless and clockless. All the while, more and more students show up late. All the while, more and more classes run over time. All the while, the official rule mandating a fifteen-minute break between classes erodes. All the while, my own classes start crumbling through their penul­timate moments, while fidgity students -not all of whom can be expected to be enraptured by my electrifying lectures wonder what time it is. All the while, the teaching function of this University suffers. 
On Nov. 21 I received a note from the dome telling me that deans-who don't teach -and "building deputies" ­whoever the hell they are-had decided, "last year," to "eliminate the last of the classroom bells." I treasure the note: it's the first note I've received from the dome in two and a half years. But I wish it explained why deans and

Being an old Air Force veteran, I hack my watch regularly. I expect the world to start and stop on time.

I appreciate that it's only been 200 years since the West­ern civilization accommodated to clocking time, but should not univer­sities be at the cutting edge of innovation?

'Good' makes good 
DOUG ANDERSON features writer 
Notre Dame Communication and Theatre Department is cur­rently showing C.P. Taylor's play, "Good", in Washington Hall. This play, which deals with the progression of a university pro­fessor towards a rationalized and tragic end, is well presented by the cast. Professor John Halder 

 
Onstage==d 
Good ~~ 
(Michael Grant), is recounting the past nine years of his life. He is a man who, in the beginning. simply writes a pro-euthanasia novel based on his own experi­ences with his infirmed mother. The Nazi party discovers his work, and gradually in­doctrinates Halder into their sys­tem. Taylor portrays Halder as a "good" person who, through his apathy and unwillingness to con­front the Hitler regime, contri­butes to the terror. 
The cast consists of ten mem­bers plus two musicians, a flutist and a pianist. Some of the cast have dual roles. All performers stay on stage for the whole per­formance, while Halder drifts in and out of certain memories of the past nine years. The cast and crew take the potentially confus­ing events of Halder's random memory and make them very easy for the audience to under­stand. The lighting and actor's positions make It very easy for the viewer to understand Halder's haphazard recollection of his experience. 
Brian Loeffler plays the role of a Nazi Over-Leader to near per­fection, maintaining his role as a dedicated Nazi when he is far from the spotlight. One intrigu­Ing aspect of the play is the re­lationship between Halder and Maurice. Both agree early on that Hitler's rise is temporary and the anti-Semitism will eventually end. Halder becomes a signifi­cant part of the Nazi party while his friend Maurice, a Jewish psy­
chiatrist, becomes more worried for the safety of himself and his family. Although he calls himself a Nazi, Halder is still a close friend of Maurice's. The 
stereotypical relationship be­tween Nazi and Jew is negated by the bond between Halder and Maurice. This relationship en­capsulates Taylor's theme: a large part of the people involved in the Nazi atrocities were not crazed killers or 'Jew-haters' but basically good people who did not have the backbone to con­tradict a few strong per­sonalities. 
In the.final analysis, "Good" is well performed by the Depart­ment of Communication and Theatre. Some people, however, could have difficulties with the language and crude situations. Taylor intended these instances to represent the reality of the Holocaust thro~Jgh various grap­hic scenes. The cast and crew give a fine performance, and will continue to do so Thursday through Saturday at 8: 10, with a 
3: 10 performance on Sunday. Tickets are available for all per­formances.

SMC basketball adds to win streak by topping Judson in home opener 
Thursday, December 4, 1986 -page 11 
By GLORIA ELEUTERI Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's used a team ef­fort Tuesday night in the home opener against Judson College, to pull off its third straight vic­tory. 
"In my three years of coach­ing at Saint Mary's, the team has not had any kind of win streak," said Coach Marvin Wood. 
Several tie scores throughout most of the first half gave the impression of a close game. But the Belles got on track after a field goal broke the 17-17 tie. A burst of five unanswered baskets put Saint Mary's ahead by a ten point spread for the rest of the half. When the two teams headed for the locker room, the Belles were on top by a score of 37-27. 
The second half brought a larger gap between the two teams. Saint Mary's led by as much as 18 points in the begin­ning of the half. They main­tained a 15-18 point margin for all but the last three minutes of the half. It was not until that point that Judson came within eleven points. But that was as close as the Belles allowed them as the final seconds ticked off the clock. 
"Key contributions by the front line helped our game," said Wood. "Both returnees and freshman are working well on the court. I used all those who suited for the game.". 
Particular standouts on the offense were Julie Radke, Tammye Radke, Kris Pan­telleria, and Stephanie Duke. Each of these players reached double figures with Duke leading with 15 points. Tammye Radke contributed 11 assists along with 14 points while sister Julie and Pan­telleria added 10 and 12 points respectively. 
Defensively Duke and Anne Gallagher controlled the boards with eight and seven rebounds. 
"The team has set a goal of 15 turnovers a game, and with only one over this game, I think that is good," stated Wood. "This was also our first game in six days with only one prac­tice in between. 
Wood said he was also pleased with periods of good play which included crisp pass­ing and accurate shooting. 
With the hopes of total team contribution continuing, the Belles travel to the Siena Heights Invitational Dec. 5-6 when they will face Nazareth College. 
Pacers win; Tisdale stars 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Wayman Tisdale scored 27 points and six other Pacers scored in double figures as Indiana broke open a close game in the fourth quar­ter to defeat the Washington Bullets 116-103 in NBA action last night.

Wilson won't appeal; denies shot was cheap 
Associated Press 

LAKE FOREST, Ill. Chicago Bears linebacker Otis Wilson said yesterday he will not appeal his one-game suspension for Sunday's injury to Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Louis Lipps. 
"I just want to get back to football, get ready for the playoffs and get this thing be­hind me," Wilson told a news conference at the club's north suburban headquarters. 
Bears President Michael McCaskey said the penalty, an­nounced Tuesday by NFL com­missioner Pete Rozelle, might have been less severe had the incident not come so close on the heels of Green Bay nose tackle Charles Martin's body slam of Chicago quarterback Jim McMahon a week earlier. 
On Tuesday, Rozelle upheld a two-game suspension of Mar­tin for the violation. 
"If it was just this one inci­dent, it probably would have just been a money fine," McCaskey said. "I think the commissioner wanted to send a clear message and, being that we are the Super Bowl cham­pions, we became the vehicle for sending that clear mes­sage." 
Wilson and McCaskey both said Wilson did not intend to hurt Lipps, who left the game with a concussion.

A realistic glance at the Bears: St. Louis style 
In this newspaper's quest to provide sports coverage that is of interest to the Notre Dame stu­dents, I now present my first-annual look at the playoff-bound Chicago Bears. 
First of all, I believe that, since I am not from Chicago (and I don't pretend to be every Sunday), and because I am from St. Louis (and I love to see Chicago sports teams lose), I can give a somewhat­unbiased look at this team that is dear to so many on this campus. 
Actually, I can honestly claim to be an intelligent Bears observer. My mother is from Chicago, and every time for the past hundred-or-so years the Bears were on television, my family would watch the game. I followed Neill Armstrong's teams, led by quarterbacks Bob Avellini (1975-78), Mike Phipps (1980), and Vince Evans (1981-82). 
And I have watched the Bears closely in the Ditka era, first of all because they have been consistent winners, and secondly because they have not beaten the St. Louis Cardinals in seven tries. 
On the subject Ditka, the man is an excellent coach, no doubt about that. But his public image is not exactly clean-cut, thanks to the press (although the press is not entirely to blame). Ditka has a habit of criticizing the media for problems he and his team have. So when he happens to be caught in, say, a DWI case, the press is not about to take it easy on the man. That's too bad, because it really doesn't benefit anyone. 
Besides that, Ditka has to put up with all the ballyhoo about his quarterbacks. 
The Chicago Tribune ran a story in which the lead paragraph said "There is life after McMahon." 

Pete Gegen 
Assistant Sports Editor 
O.K. McMahon is a main ingredient in the lifeblood of the Bears offense. But Ditka is the one who deserves the credit -the Bears have proved that they can survive with Mike Tomczak at the helm (5-0 this season). And the defense has survived the heart-breaking loss of its dear friend, Buddy Ryan (and to think the Cardinals were looking at him as their head coach). 
While on the subject of quarterbacks, I was shocked when Doug Flutie was singed by the Bears. Heck, the Cardinals don't even have one decent quarterback, and the Bears have three (sorry, Steve Fuller) . 
I also cannot imagine how so little can be heard from a player like Walter Payton. Every weekend its "McMahon this" or "Ditka that." Before Ditka, Payton was THE player for the Bears. Memories of Carly Simon's "Nobody Does It Better" still flash through my head when I see him run. But, given the current team-press relations, its probably bet­ter that the NFL's all-time leading rusher stays out of the headlines. And Ditka, do us all a favor and let Walter score a touchdown in this year's Super Bowl. 
Super Bowl? How can they make the Super Bowl without McMahon? Chicagoans are continually as­king this question, but to us unbiased observers, it is obvious that the Bears can breeze through the National Football Conference playoffs. Who's going to challenge them, the Redskins? After watching them struggle against the Cardinals, I don't think so. 
All the Bears need to do between here and Pasadena is work on their public image. The press jumped all over Otis Wilson for his forearm to the head of Louis Lipps last week, comparing it even to Charles Martin's job on McMahon. And Willie Gault gets a beautiful spread in Sports Illustrated featuring his skill in track and ballet, but on the subject of the Bears the magazine features only his complaints against the quarterbacks, especially McMahon. 
No matter what the press thinks of the Bears, and vice-versa, you can't take away the fact that they are winners. But for their public image, I think they will need something a little more effective this time than "The Super Bowl Shuffle II."
