Four more guards brought home as Marine scandal grows 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The investi­gation of an espionage scandal that has rocked the Marine Corps' elite embassy guard force broadened Tuesday with the announcement that four guards formally stationed in communist-bloc countries were being recalled from Austria for questioning. 
Robert Sims, chief Pentagon spokesman, said the Marines, now assigned to the U.S. em­bassy in Vienna, were suspected of possible improper fraternization with foreign citizens while posted to other embassies in Warsaw Pact na­tions. 
The four will return to the Quantico, Va., Marine Base, where the espionage inquiry is being conducted. 
A fifth Marine is being replaced for unrelated viola­tions of "local security regula­tions" in Vienna, Sims said, and a sixth was recalled to ap­pear as a witness at a pre-trial hearing Wednesday for Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, the guard whose arrest touched off the current investigation. 
Sims also said the Marine Corps has tightened its screen­ing procedures for new guard recruits, and he confirmed that an internal Pentagon study had recommended changes in the supervision of embassy guards. 
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, meantime, said the Pentagon might consider assigning more married Marines, accompanied by their wives, to guard duty instead of relying on young, single ser­vicemen. 
And a lawyer for Lonetree said he was seriously consider­ing an attempt to move the espionage case against hir: client into a civilian court and wanted to summon Arthur Hartman, former U.S. ambas­sador to the Soviet Union, as a witness. 
Sims told a news briefing he could not release the identities of the Marines who had been recalled nor disclose at which embassies the men had served before Vienna. He stressed that 


Intersection near campus set for improvements 
By MARIA DOTI Staff Reporter 
Improvements on the inter­section of Juniper, Eddy, An­gela and Edison streets, south of Notre Dame's campus, are scheduled for completion by this July, according to county officials. 
"No traffic light will be in­stalled," said Richard Jasinski, president of the Board of County Commissioners. "But the intersection will be paved and restriped in time for the opening of the International Summer Special Olympics." 
Rex Rakow, director of Se­curity at Notre Dame, says he doesn't think a light is neces­sary at this intersection. 
"Traffic flows smoothly," he said. "If you drive through there during rush hour, of course it will be blocked up. But not for more than 10 or 15 minutes." 
Rakow said the intersection is manned by police officers during large events. "People are in and out in 15 to 20 minutes," he said. 
"We're expecting about 60,000 people for the opening ceremonies of Special Olym­pics," Rakow said. "About the same population as a football game." 
Mayor Roger Parent recently urged county commis­sioners to install a traffic light and fix up the intersection. 
"It's dangerous, and it's ug­ly," Parent said. "It's not as if we're talking about a multi­million dollar project. The money is there. The job just needs to be done." 
According to Parent, the traffic light proposal is on hold partly because 86 percent of the land containing the intersec­tion belongs to the county. The remainder is in the city's juris­diction, he said. 
"People don't want to see a major thoroughfare running through campus," explained Robert Richardson, county en­gineer. 

none had been formally charged with wrongdoing. 
Lonetree, who has been charged with espionage, was arrested in December at the Vienna embassy. He had trans­ferred to the Austrian capital last fall after working in 1985 and 1986 as a guard at the Mos­cow embassy. 
The Marine Corps has for­mally accused Lonetree and a second former guard, Cpl. Ar­nold Bracy, of allowing Soviet agents inside the Moscow em-

Choice to go to Innsbruck becomes harder to make 
I was ten years old when I realized Vienna waits for me, although the call was located a little further west. It came in the form of letters and postcards from my sister who was studying in Innsbruck, Austria, as a sophomore at Notre Dame. She came home with stories of beer gar­dens, skiing in the Alps, and weekend trips to Rome. Four years later my brother also went to Innsbruck, returning with equally inviting stories and an earring in his left ear. I decided this was definitely for me. 
The year my brother left for Innsbruck was also the year I started high school, already with the goal in mind of going to Innsbruck six years later. My brother and sister had really struggled through introductory German here, so I enrolled in German in high school on their advice. In four years I gained moderate proficiency in the language and a love for the country and its culture. I devoured every bit of information I could get about Austria from lan­guage club activities, books, movies, and dis­cussions with my high school German teacher, an Austrian. I saw Amadeus four times and quit counting my screenings of The Sound of Music after the dozen mark. 
The only thing standing between me and the 
final realization of my dream was one short 
year here. Or so I thought. 
I guess I should do a little explaining. You 
see, I'm what most of us generously refer to as 
a "Bender." I've lived in South Bend for 
eighteen years and to top it off, I'm a faculty 
brat. So it really wasn't that out of control for 
me to realize, as a: ten year old, that the 
probabiltity of my coming to Notre Dame was 
high. It also follows that I would be more anx­
ious than your average Domer to escape the 
shadow of that great Golden Dome. 
My father went to Notre Dame and then 
returned to teach. Four of my brothers and 
sisters graduated from or are attending Notre 
Dame. I thought I knew what it was all about. 
My father used to lull me to sleep to the alma 
mater. I knew about the tailgaters and the foot­
ball games. I knew about SYR's and mud pits. 
I remember the alcohol riots, Molarity, and 
when Five Points didn't deserve its name be­
cause of traffic. 
What no one could tell me about was what would be my Notre Dame. No one could tell me that I would be able to get ready for a hall formal in only half an hour because I was run­ning around buying peach schnapps and reserv­ing hotel rooms. No one could tell me I would be in the Observer office until 3:00 a.m. dis­cussing Bambi's sex and other mysteries of the universe. No one could tell me what it would feel like to beat North Carolina. No one could tell me I would actually like it here. 

As the semester winds down, I keep reali.zing that I won't be here next year. When I return, my friends who are juniors and seniors now won't be here. My friends who are freshman and sophomores will have had a year's worth of experiences that I won't be familiar with. I won't know the other half of the students on campus. Of course, I will be seeing Europe and having many adventures that the students here won't have had. My close relationships with people here will be replaced by ones with my fellow Innsbruckers and hopefully some Austrians. 
I obviously feel that the benefits outweigh the costs in this situation, for I am leaving for Austria in August. I've just realized that al­though things may go according to plan, they are never going to turn out exactly as expected. 
Even knowing that I will be back in a year, it won't be easy to leave this place that has been a part of me for so long and that I have become a part of over the past year. I guess it will just make coming back almost as fun as going away. 

Do you want to have fun? Do you want to meet people? Do you want to get paid? 
The Alumni-Senior Club is still ac­cepting applications for staff mem­bers until April 21st. Applications may be picked up at the Student Ac­tivities Office, 3rd floor LaFortune.

West Germany questions Soviets about increased radiation levels 
Associated Press 
BONN, West Germany-West Germany said Tuesday it will ask Moscow about higher levels of radiation in Europe that some experts believe may have been caused by a nuclear power plant accident in the So­viet Union. 
West Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway and France on Tuesday confirmed varying increases in atmo­spheric radiation last mon.th. The Soviet government demed it was the source of the emis­sions, which officials said caused no damage or injuries. 
The Soviets were criticized after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster for failing to quickly report the power plant acci­dent, which killed 31 Soviets and spewed radiation around the world nearly one year ago. 
Officials in Bonn said unus­
ual levels of the radioactive ele­
ment iodine 131 and four to five 



NAME THE

times the normal amounts of xenon gas were measured in West Germany between March 9 and March 15. 
Environment Ministry spokesman Claudia Conrad said the radiation posed no health threat, but the govern­ment asked the Soviet Union for further information. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Klaus-Hermann Ringwald said the request was "on its way" to the Soviets but had not yet been formally presented. 
"The experts are all saying it was almost certainly a nu­clear power accident," Heinz­Joerg Haury, a spokesman for the government-financed In­stitute for Radioactivity and Environmental Research in Munich, told The Associated Press. 
A western diplomatic source in Moscow said Tuesday that the Soviets were asked about a possible radiation leak after some Scandinavian countries registered an increase in emis­sions last month. The source, who spoke on condition he not be further identified, said the Soviets denied any such leak. 
The source said it was un­likely a nuclear power plant ac­cident had occurred, since it would have released many ra­dioactive isotopes, not just iodine 131. 
In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said the Soviet Union's radiation detection equipment is ''functioning well and no discharges of radioac­tive emissions have been regis­tered on the territory of the So­viet Union." 
Erich Oberhausen, chairman of the Bonn-based Radiation Protection Commission, said a government study indicated that the radiation came from a minor Soviet nuclear plant ac­cident or an underground nu­clear test.

Retired Soviet officers to visit Notre Dame 
By SHARON HEGG Staff Reporter 
A group of former high ranking military officers from the Soviet Union will visit the University of Notre Dame on April 23 and 24 to participate in seminars sponsored by Notre Dame's Institute for International Peace Studies. 
According to John Gil­ligan, director of the in­stitute, the former generals and admirals, will partici­pate in a three panel discus­sion on relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
One panel consists of three 
retired United Stated mili­
tary people, another panel 
consists of three former am­
bassadors, and the third 
panel is made up of four or 
five students, Gilligan ex­
plained 
"We happen to be the only 
University in the country to 
have Soviet military people 
discuss openly, the policies 
of the Soviet Union and the 
United States, "he said. 
"Gorbachev is opening the 
JF)HILOSOPHY 
Soviet Union to an unprece­dented degree." 
According to Gilligan, recent developments in U.S.­Soviet arms control talks en­hance the timeliness of the Soviet visit. "This is an his­toric moment," Gilligan said. "Secretary Gorbachev has made proposals about the removal of intermediate range missiles from the European theatre which are remarkably similar to Pres­ident Reagan's 'zero option' suggestion of several years ago. The opportunity to dis­cuss the significance of such developments with respon­sible military leaders is an extraordinary 'window of opportunity'." 
The panel discussions will 
take place on Friday, April 
24 at 10 a.m., 2p.m., and 4:30 
p.m. in the auditorium of the Center for Continuing Edu­cation. 
The Soviet officers will ar­rive in Washington D.C. on April 19, where they will meet with former admirals and generals of the United States to discuss the current military and diplomatic policies of the two nations.

Bond denies charges by wife of cocaine use 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA· Civil rights vet­eran Julian Bond yesterday angrily blasted news reports about allegations by his estranged wife that he uses cocaine, saying he does not use drugs and has not committed any crimes. 
"What is at issue here is a family affair of concern only to those who are intimately in­volved," Bond said in a state­ment issued to reporters. He blasted "those professional scavengers and gossip mongers who have made life hell for innocent people whose only crime is that their last name is Bond." 
Bond, a former state senator from Atlanta, left abruptly after reading the statement and refused to answer any questions. 
But he appeared later on a radio talk show to discuss the matter in more detail. He said he agreed to be interviewed be­cause his responses would not be edited. 
"I've never used cocaine. Never at all," Bond said. But he said he would not take a drug test.

Senate urges judge to order release of Iran-Contra financial records 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Senate urged a skeptical federal judge on Tuesday to order retired Air Force Maj. General Richard Secord to release foreign bank records believed linked to the Iran-Contra arms deals. 
U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr. said he would rule in the case, but he called the order the Senate was seeking "a charade," said the Swiss might reject it and suggested whatever decision he makes will surely be appealed. 
Senate Attorney Michael Davidson said the Tower com­mission, appointed by Presi­dent Reagan to investigate the Iran-Contra affair, had identi­fied Secord's "prominence in global arrangements with respect to shipment of arms to Iran." 
The commission's report also said Secord was involved in a network supporting the Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras. It said contributions appear to have been routed to the Contras through a series of private organizations, some of them linked to Secord­controlled bank accounts by a chart found in the safe of fired National Security Council aide Oliver North. 
The Senate Iran-Contra com­mittee wants the records to learn about "the flow of money through these bank accounts," Davidson said. 
The Senate voted last month to seek a contempt of court citation that would threaten Secord with imprisonment if he did not sign documents giving investigators access to bank records in Switzerland, the Cayman Islands and Panama. 
Secord's attorney, Thomas Green, said Tuesday that such an order would violate the retired general's constitutional protection against self­incrimination. 
"This statement that Gen. Secord is being asked to make under the threat of contempt and threat of imprisonment is nothing more than compelled speech," Green said. 
"It's the equivalent of transporting Mr. Secord to Switzerland or some other foreign destination (and) making him say to bankers 'I consent to release of bank records,"' Green said. 
Judge Robinson told David­son, the Senate lawyer, he had 
problems  with  the  consent  
clause.  
"I  just  have  a  problem  

playing charades," Robinson said. "I have a problem with an order I know is a charade." Davidson said "consent" in 
the statement's context was merely a legal term so "the directive shall be construed as consent" to satisfy Swiss and Cayman Islands law. 
And he said the Swiss aut­horities could refuse to honor the directive, knowing that Secord objected to signing it. 
But Robinson nodded when Davidson argued that the only issue before the judge is the 1970 law empowering Congress to seek court orders directing production of documents. 
Secord's lawyer, Green, sug­gested that the court could defer its decision to give the Senate time to determine if it could obtain the Swiss bank records under a U.S.-Swiss treaty. 
However, Davidson argued that the treaty is only available to prosecutors, not legislative committees. 
The Senate, in a related ef­fort to learn more about Secord's affairs, has voted to request limited immunity from prosecution for two secretaries of Secord companies, Joan Cor­bin and Shirley Napier, in order to compel them to testify before the Senate panel. Robinson granted that request on Mon­day. 


Mexicans develop new technique for treatment of brain ailments 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Brain sur­gery developed in Mexico to treat Parkinson's disease is a dramatic advance that could lead to new treatments for strokes and Alzheimer's disease, but it requires more study because two of the 11 patients who received it have died, a U.S. doctor said Tuesday. 
Abraham Lieberman, chairman of the medical ad­visory board of the Ameri­can Parkinson Disease Association and professor of neurology at New York Uni­versity, went to Mexico last week to examine the patients and said he was enormously encouraged. 
"I think I witnessed his­tory," he said at a news con­ference in his office. "I think this is the approach you're going to take to Alzheimer's, to spinal cord injuries and to strokes." 
He predicted that doctors in the United States would rush to adopt the procedure, in which nerve-like cells from one of the patient's own adrenal glands, located above the kidneys, are transplanted into the brain to replace degenerating brain cells. 
Less than three weeks have passed since the first report of the surgery ap­peared in the New England Journal of Medicine, and George Allen at Vanderbilt University Medical Center inN ashville has already per­formed the operation on one patient there. The patient is in satisfactory condition, and no improvements in her Parkinson's disease have been reported yet. 
New York University is preparing to do its first transplant in May, and other hospitals will likely follow suit, Lieberman said. 
He warned, however, that hasty adoption of the proce­dure could be dangerous. "My fear is that there will be a number of deaths and the government or the states will come in and say 'What is going on here?"' 
Lieberman said one pa-

tient died from brain seizures 45 days after sur­gery, and although the Mexican doctors, led by Ig­nacio Madrazo, claim the death was not related to the surgery, Lieberman said it is not possible to rule out such a link without further study. 
The patient was given anti-convulsant drugs to prevent seizures, which are known to sometimes follow brain surgery, but the pa­tient had the seizures while taking the drugs, Lieberman said. 
The cause of death of the second patient is not yet known, but autopsy results are on their way to the Mexican doctors. 
Efforts by Swedish re­searchers in recent years to treat Parkinson's disease with brain transplants had failed, but the Mexican re­searchers transplanted larger, acorn-sized pieces of adrenal tissue and put them in a different part of the brain, which could account for their success.

The headlines, as usual, seem bleak. The Pope calls for an end to violence in Chile, and his listeners are dispersed by tear gas from government forces reacting to a group of anti-Pinochet protestors. Outbreaks of violence in South Africa continue as the white majority government systematically cripples the black majority through its apartheid policies, while back in Wash­ington, the United States government agrees to send 600 more missiles to Af­ghanistan to perpetuate that country's ongoing battle with the Soviet Union.

guest column 
Closer to home, things are not quite as bad, but still, the pressures are here. Many minorities find it difficult to "fit in" on these predominantly all-white campuses. Many seniors preparing to graduate experience the pressure of finding a job to pay off their costly un­dergraduate education. Other seniors, especially those planning to enter sci­entific or technological fields, must decide whether they are willing to work for a company whose policies they morally oppose or whether they will pass up the job offer. And for those of us remaining in South Bend for another year, we must face the increasing fin­ancial pressures of another year of higher education. 
When we consider all of the pressures that surround us and all of the bleak­ness in the world today, it truly does seem as though someone has opened Pandora's box. All of the evils of the world have flown out of the box and now appear as headlines in the media. Injustice reigns. 
But many people felt that one thing remained in Pandora's box after it was opened. The survivor was Hope. 
True, when we look at the surface of all of the injustices in the world today, it is difficult, sometimes next to impossible, to find hope in these situa­tions that are so far removed, so far out of our control. 
When we look at the issues closer though, our perspective changes. Yes,

this column is yet another call for an "awareness" of what is going on beyond the gates of our schools. But it is only through this heightened sense of awareness that we can begin to find "hope" in these seemingly "hope-less" situations. 
The people who have dedicated their lives, or at least part of their lives, to helping the oppressed perfectly ex­emplify this sense of hope. Ironically, theologian Thomas Merton once wrote, "Do not depend on the hope of results." Those who work with the oppressed rec­ognize the fact that their work will rarely produce immediate results; however, soon they realize that the value of their work is more important than seeing these immediate results. 
The dictionary defines hope as a "wish" for something with expectation of its fulfillment. Thus, we "hope" for good grades, we "hope" for a job, we "hope" for peace. But in this case "hop­ing" or "wishing" is not enough. If we wish for something, we must be willing to work for it. The workers who have dedicated their lives to bringing justice to the oppressed prove this to us. Again, we must remember that the impor­tance lies not in immediate results, but rather in the value of the work itself. 
But the dictionary also gives an ar­chaic definition of hope as meaning trust or confidence. Hope then becomes a way of trusting that justice will prevail. The volunteers trust that even­tually their work will help someone in some way. 
This notion may seem idealistic, but if it were not for hope, would the Philip­pines be where they are today? Would we be where we are today if it were not for a handful of "hopeful" rebels in the eighteenth century? 
No longer can we turn our backs on the seemingly "hopeless" situations in South Africa, Chile and around the world today. Instead, the time has come to view them with confidence that justice will prevail if we are willing to work for it.

thank all involved 
Dear Editor: 
On behalf of all Fisher Hall residents, we would like to thank the entire Notre Dame community for its enthusiastic participation in the Fisher Hall Regat­ta. 
The first annual edition of the event was exceptionally successful as Breen­Phillips captured first place in the wo­men's division and Fisher was for­tunate enough to capture first and second place in the overall competition. Cavanaugh placed third. 
We would like to thank Coca-Cola for its generous financial support and William Hickey, director of University Food Services, who planned a lakeside picnic to coincide with the Regatta. Un­fortunately, the brisk weather made the outside picnic impossible, but the hot chocolate came in handy. The bad wea­ther also prevented the Student Activ­hundreds of boat watchers and Regatta fanatics. 
Most importantly, though, the Center for Basic Learning Skills, the Regatta charity, will benefit greatly from the financial support generated by the event. This organization helps educate individuals who are lacking basic skills such as reading and writing. 
Finally, we wish to extend our ap­preciation to the fifteen boats and the "floating vessels" representing numerous dorms and organizations, to their courageous crews who braved the rough waters, and to our rector, Bro­ther Edward Luther who made the Fis­her Hall Regatta Notre Dame's answer to America's Cup.

'The Adventures of Steve McStevewell'. 
prelude to an off-campus adventure 
T
his week: Part One of the adventures of Steve McStevewell, Notre Dame stu­dent. future President of the United States, borderline al­coholic and all-around nice guy. 
Kris Murphy 
Altered 
It was another Friday night and Steve McStevewell was bored out of his skull. "''m bored out of my skull" said Steve, "maybe I'll play an­other record." He slapped an­other Ramones record on the turntable and stared out the window into the descending night. 
"Sitting here watching night descend is really bogus" said Steve. "I wish something wild and exciting would happen. Tonight I want to feel all the rapture, all the glory that is youth." 
Suddenly a knock came upon his door. Steve opened It and stared into the faces of three of his hallmates; Mike, Mike and Mike. "How come every guy at Notre Dame is named Mike?" asked Steve. "Stop asking stupid ques­tions" said Mike. "Tonight we're going off campus to get destroyed and hook up with some hot babes." 
"I never hook up with hot babes" said Steve. "It's bad for my complexion. And as for getting destroyed. . . well that usually ends with getting sick, and dry heaves are not my idea of tasting the glory of youth." "What's all this glory of youth drek?" snapped Mike. "You're coming with us and you're going to have fun." 
"Great." said Steve. "I feel like I'm in the Hitler youth." "Be ready in half an hour," chanted the three Mikes. "Then come upstairs and have some vodka." 
Steve decided to go. "Heck, 


I'm young and extremely good looking. These are the best years of my life, and, anyway, I could go for meeting some hot babes. I haven't done that since, well. .. since a long time." He went to take a shower but found a large football player standing in front of the bath­room. "Uh, I want to take a shower," said Steve, who was only wearing a towel. "Sorry," said the football guy in a dis­interested tone, "there's a chick in there." "Why doesn't she just use the ladies room on the first floor?" asked Steve. "Why don't you take a walk before I shove all your teeth down your larynx?" came the response. 
"That's an interesting ques­tion," said Steve, "but you should never answer a ques­tion with another question. It's very rude." 
"''m going to kill you!" said the hormone monster. 
"Well, since you put it that way maybe I'll go shave or put on some socks or some­thing." muttered Steve, back­
ing away down the hall. "The NCAA will hear about this and then they'll probably suspend you or cut your salary in half or something." 
Steve finally found a shower, shaved, and put on a sweatshirt and some long shorts. Then he stood there looking in his mirror. "I am going to have a good time tonight," he told himself, "It won't be like that other time when I walked home from St. Louis street In sub-zero wea­ther and froze my gazamba off. It also won't be like last week when I lost half my clothes and walked into the lake, and it surely won't be like that horrible time when I woke up in Glanetto's parking lot. No, tonight will be differ­ent." "Who are you kidding?" responded his mirror. 
Steve went upstairs and joined the Mikes. "We're going to walk" said Mike. "It's a warrn night and drinking and driving Is stupid. Anyway, I know these three girls in Lyons who want to go with us." "Are they cute?" asked Mike hopefully. "Do chickens have lips?" responded Mike. Steve wasn't sure whether chickens had lips or not so he didn't say anything. 
They went to pick up the girls. Their names were Moira, Carrie, and Kristie. Moira and Kristie were nothing to get all excited about as far as Steve was concerned, but Carrie was undeniably a goddess. Steve decided to subtly intro­duce himself. "Hi," said Steve "my name is Steve McStevewell and you are so hot that you're melting my

Reeboks." "Oh..."said Carrie playing hard to get. "Wait. Steve McStevewell, aren't you the guy who walked into the lake last week?" "No," said Steve, fum­bling for an excuse, "that was my brother Matt McStevewell." "Oh," said Carrie "It sure looked like you. Are we going to stand around here all night or are we going to go off campus?" "Never fear," said one of the Mikes, "we're 
leaving now, and I can per­
sonally guarantee you the 
best time of your lives." 
"Even better than Circus Lunch?" asked Moira. "Yes," said the Mike, "even better than Circus Lunch." "Wow," murmured Steve "better than Circus Lunch. This might not be so bad after all." 
Will Steve have a better time off-campus than he had at Circus Lunch? Will he and Carrie find anything in com­mon? Will the three Mikes develop separate per­sonalities? Will Moira reveal her terrible secret? Are these really the best days of your life or is someone pulling your leg? These questions and a couple more that couldn't be printed here wil! be answered in part two of. "Steve McStevewell: Who is he and why isn't he in jail?"

Expos pick up first win of season, Milwaukee continues to roll in AL 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS-Jeff Reed drove horne four runs to lead the Montreal Expos to their first victory of the season, a 9-4 deci­sion over the St. Louis Car­dinals Tuesday night. 
Expos right-hander Jay Tibbs, 1-1, took a three-hit shutout into the ninth inning, but Tommy Herr had a two-run double and Jack Clark an RBI single for the Cardinals before Bob McClure got the last three outs. McClure surrendered a sacrifice fly to Jim Lindeman. 
The Expos got their first vic­tory in six games with a 10-hit attack against Greg Mathews, 0-1, and three St. Louis relievers. 
Mathews walked three straight batters with two outs in Montreal's four-run first. The third walk, to Reid Nichols, forced horne Andres Galar­raga, and Reed then doubled to score Nichols, Tim Wallach and Vance Law. 
Galarraga's single and Wal­
lach's sacrifice knocked in runs 
in the second, and Reed's single 
made it 7-0 in the fifth. 
Wallach had a two-run single 
in the sixth. 
Brewers 7, Orioles 4 
BALTIMORE -Five Mil­
waukee players homered as the 
Brewers remained unbeaten in 
eight games with a 7-4 victory 
over the Baltimore Orioles 
Tuesday night. 
Paul Molitor, Robin Yount, 
Jim Gantner, Rob Deer and 
Greg Brock each homered as 
the Brewers continued the best 
start in the franchise's history. 
Molitor led off the game with 
the first of four horne runs al­
lowed by Baltimore's Ken 
Dixon, 1-1, who pitched into the 
sixth inning. 
Yount and Gantner hit their 
homers in the second inning 
and Deer hit his in the sixth. 
Brock's carne in the sixth off 
reliever Tony Arnold. 
Dale Sveurn had three of Mil­
waukee's 14 hits. His third, an 
eighth-inning single, drove in 
the final Milwaukee run. 
Mark Ciardi, 1-0, worked five 
innings for his first major­
league victory. Dan Plesac 
worked the final 1 1-3 innings 
for his third save. 
The Orioles loaded the bases with none out in the second but managed just one run as Terry Kennedy hit into a double play and Larry Sheets grounded out. 
Cal Ripken hit a two-run horner in the third. Ray Knight doubled in the eighth and scored on a single by Sheets. 
Yankees 10, Indians 6 
NEW YORK-Joel Skinner hit a grand slam off Cleveland reliever Steve Carlton that broke a fifth-inning tie Tuesday night and gave the New York Yankees a 10-6 victory. 
With two outs in the fifth and the score 3-3, Carlton walked Dave Winfield and Mike Pagliarulo doubled. Carlton, 0­1, then walked Willie Randolph and fell behind Skinner 2-and-0. Cleveland Manager Pat Cor­rales visited the mound and Skinner hit the next pitch for his first career grand slam. 
Cecilio Guante, who relieved starter Bob Tewksbury in the fourth, won his first decision, allowing one run in 3 1-3 in­nings. The Indians scored two eighth-inning runs off Dave Righetti. 
Joe Carter drove in four runs with a homer, double and two RBI singles for Cleveland, which suffered its fifth straight loss. 
Carter had an RBI single in first, but Rickey Henderson opened the Yankees' half of the inning with a home run off starter Phil Niekro. Niekro later hit Pagliarulo with a pitch with the bases loaded to make it 2-1. 
Claudell Washington's RBI single in the second made it 3-1 before the Indians knocked out Tewksbury in the fourth on 
Carter's homer,  and  an  RBI  
single by Chris Bando.  
Henderson  tripled  and  

scored in the sixth and singled in the eighth when the Yankees added their final two runs. 
Blue Jays 4, White Sox 
TORONTO -Rick Leach's single through the infield in the 13th inning scored Willie Up­shaw and gave the Toronto Blue Jays a 4-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox Tuesday night. 
Upshaw and Ernie Whitt 
were walked by Joel McKeon, 
0-1, to lead off the 13th. Leach, 
who entered the game as a 
pinch-hitter in the eighth in­
ning, slapped McKeon's first 
pitch up the middle and the ball 
deflected off the pitcher's glove 
and through the left side of the 
infield. 

Mark Eichhorn, the fourth 
Toronto pitcher, pitched one in­
ning to earn his first victory of 
the season. 

Chicago starter Floyd Ban­nister had scattered five hits and allowed only one run before the Blue Jays rallied to tie the game 3-3 in the eighth. 
Red Sox 4, Rangers 1 
BOSTON -Don Baylor hit a three-run homer in the first in­ning and AI Nipper scattered nine hits over eight innings as the Boston Red Sox defeated Texas 4-1 Tuesday, handing the Rangers their fifth straight defeat. 
Nipper, 1-0, lost his bid for his first career shutout on Pete Incaviglia's third homer with one out in the eighth. He struck out five and walked two before giving way to Calvin Schiraldi, who pitched the ninth for his first save. 
The Red Sox took a quick 3-0 lead against Ed Correa, 0-1. 
Wade Boggs led off the first 
with the first of his three con­
secutive walks and Bill Buck­
ner singled with one out. Jim 
Rice struck out, but Baylor hit 
a 3-2 pitch high into the screen 
in left for his third homer of the 
season and 29th lifetime 
against the Rangers. 
The Red Sox added an insur­
ance run in the sixth on a single 
by Dave Henderson, a sacrifice 
by Marc Sullivan and a single 
off reliever Dale Mohorcic by 
Spike Owen, hitting just .050. 
Reds 6, Braves 3 
ATLANTA -Kal Daniels drove in two runs, including a leadoff homer in the sixth that broke a 3-3 tie, and three Cin­cinnati pitchers held Atlanta at by in a 6-3 victory over the Braves Tuesday night. 
Daniels' homer just cleared the right field fence at the 330­foot mark off starter David Palmer, 0-2, and lifted the Reds to their sixth win in seven games. 
Eric Davis, hitting .478 going into the game, smacked a three-run homer in the first after Palmer issued consecu­tive walks to Daniels and Terry

The Observer 
Golfers take second place in Indy 

But the sad seven who don't make the playoffs can take con­solation in the fact that they all enter the draft lottery and have a shot at getting the first pick of next year's college crop. Just something for them to think about in the middle of the month it takes the NBA to finish its playoffs. 
There's just something about playing 80 and 82 games to eliminate five and seven teams that doesn't wash. Theoretical­ly, they could just have teams pick out of a hat to draw an opponent and start the playoffs right away, instead of wasting six months of regular season to knock out the basement­dwellers. 
But that wouldn't make these teams much money, would it? And if the playoffs would be shorter, the teams would make less money, wouldn't they? It's fine for these sports to do anything to help the financial stability of the leagues, but enough is enough. 
Let's cut those winter sports season a bit, or return the playoffs to what they ought to be, a reward for fine regular season play. If there are a lot of games played, the truly good teams should rise to the top, so fewer teams need to be invited to the playoffs. If there are fewer games in the regular season, more teams can be let in to account for the shorter time period. 
The length of the basketball and hockey seasons hurts in­centive, since almost all teams make the playoffs, and it les­sens the quality of the products since it requires players to coast some nights because of fatigue. 
And it's also confusing to watch the NBA Finals and Stanley Cup Finals in 90-degree heat. 

By ORLANDO RUBIANO Sports Writer 
Being a runner-up is akin to being a bridesmaid. You con­gratulate the bride but wish it was the other way around. 
The Notre Dame golf team did the congratulating, but un­like poor Greg Norman who must be looking for a good psy­chiatrist, second-place was not at all a disappointment. Playing in the Indianapolis In­tercollegiates this past weekend, the Irish took a runner-up trophy home after firing a team total 806 that was 18 strokes behind runaway win­ner Ball State. 
Coach Noel O'Sullivan said bad weather (lightning, cold temperatures and winds) kept team scores higher than they normally would have been. However, the weather did not dampen the linksters' game as they easily outdistanced Mil­likin University by 13 shots to take second. 
"We're pleased in taking the runner-up trophy," said O'Sullivan. "It certainly is not something to be disappointed about. Besides, we finished ahead of some good golf pro­grams, which can be easily overlooked when you don't finish first." 
The Irish were led by Norm Campbell's 158 (79-79) for the 36-hole event. Close behind was Pat Mohan who checked in with a 160 (77-83). The rest of the squad finished, in order, with Doug Giorgio's 162 (83-79), Chris Bona (85-80) and John Connelly (81-84) both at 165, and Dick Connelly with a 170 total (81-89). The hi-score in each round was not figured into the team score. 
The rest of the tournament field saw Wisconsin­Whitewater finishing fourth (819), followed by Franklin Col­lege at 820. Cincinnati took sixth with a two-day total of 825, Wittenberg was next at 827, DePauw was eighth at 844, Evansville finished with an 865, and bringing in the rear was Butler at a disappointing 886. 
The Irish will need the mo­mentum gained in Indianapolis as they head for Ohio State this weekend. The Kepler Invita­tional awaits the Irish and 22 other hopefuls. O'Sullivan calls this tournament the grand­daddy of them all. 
"The Kepler is the most pres­tigious golf tournament in the Midwest," he said. "All the big

The home field advantage proved favorable for the St. Mary's softball team as they combined strong hitting with tough defense to squeak by St. Francis in a doubleheader Monday, 8-7 and 6-5. 
The Belles' offensive attack was s..,arked by Trish Tierney, Janine Adamo and Marge Reynolds who connected for two hits apiece. 
St. Francis scored six runs in the fifth inning to take the lead, 7-5. Consistent hitting enabled the Belles' to rally for three

Winning pitcher Tammy Shelor fired six strike-outs from the mound and did a fine job of keeping St. Francis run­ners of the bases. 
In the second game the Belles attacked early, scoring all six runs in the first two innings. The Belles had to rely on strong fielding to allow them the vic­tory and the sweep.

The Scarlet course, home to several NCAA Championships, including this year's, is a par 72 with a course rating of 73.9. O'Sullivan acknowledged the Scarlet course is a tremendous challenge.

The 54-hole Kepler will be a true test of how far the Irish have come since the fall. 
"This weekend," said O'Sullivan, "will really prove to me how good this team can play in the face of top quality competition. 
"Realistically I would be content with a Top Ten finish, which I would call the sign of a good season's work. We have three of the five starters playing in their first Kepler ever, but if we can get consis­tency from the opening tee shot to the final putt I see us finish­ing well." 
The Irish will get their oppor­tunity to show that they are a team to reckon with this weekend. 

But now we arrive at the hockey and basketball playoff fields and things get a little strange. Our playoff cup run­neth over with nearly every team that dons the same color uniforms qualifying. 
In the NHL, 16 of 21 teams go on to post-season play. This means a team must win four series to capture the Stanley Cup title. With the brilliant in­stitution of seven-game series even in the first round, a team can play 28 games after the season is over. 
The NBA is another culprit of making a mockery of the playoff idea. Seven NBA teams out of 23 do not move on to post­
season play. These series start
out as best-of-five series, but quickly go to seven-game sets.

NBA, NUL playoffs invite too many guests 
Ah, the signs of spring. Bookstore Basketball action abundant. Baseball getting into high gear. Golf and tennis balls appearing in real life, not just televised from warm­weather cities. And NBA and NHL playoff action getting underway. 

Rick Rietbrock 
Irish Items 
That's right, NBA and NHL playoff action is just getting underway. 
The National Basketball Association playoffs really haven't even started yet, but in another week the NBA will begin its playoff schedule. The National Hockey League started its playoffs last week. 
And not a moment too soon. 
Our favorite winter (and half of fall and spring) sports are winding down to a close. The long haul from those openers last fall, during the first half of football season, through the frozen tundra of winter, has finally gotten these leagues to the playoffs. The climax to another big season is just on the horizon. 
But that horizon is quite an optical illusion. 
The seasons are not going to end soon. Some question whether they end at all, or just randomly roll together into one long, continuous season. There are at least two reasons for this dragged-out process. 
First, the seasons in both sports are frightfully long. These sports eat up seven months with their regular seasons and playoffs. The NHL regular season is 80 games long and the NBA regular season requires 82 games to complete. 
Major League Baseball, by comparison, takes seven months to complete its schedule as well, but its schedule has 162 games. Of course, baseball games are played nearly every day, and basketball and hockey only play about three times per week, partly because of the demand­ing nature of the sports, and partly because the three-game series format in baseball cuts down travel. 
But the question must be asked, what's the point to the regular season? 
Ideally, the point to the regular season is to play a large enough sample of games over a period of time to determine who the top teams are, and which of those top teams will reap the rewards of its success and make the playoffs. The best and luckiest of that group is crowned champion. 
But reality points in a much different direction. Baseball has remained traditional, allowing only the two division winners in each league to compete in the playoffs, while the National Football League allows the three division winners and two wild-cards from each conference to enter the battle for the Super Bowl. This seems to be a good formula as well.
