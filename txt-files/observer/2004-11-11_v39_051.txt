SENATE 
Ticket exchange approved 
Program instituted to resolve problems 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Associate News Editor 
Senators approved a resolution for a men's basketball ticket exchange program and dis­cussed an amendment to the student union constitution that changes election rules at Student Senate Wednesday. 
One week after concerns about the men's basketball ticket distri­bution were discussed at Senate, the university affairs committee came bq,ck with a resolution that would help resolve the problem of connecting students with unused tickets to those without. 
Zahm senator Mike McGinley presented the resolution, speak­ing-to the importance of swift implementation. 
"The faster we get tickets into the hands of students and those students fill up empty seats at games, the better," McGinley said. 
The Ticket Share Program works with residence halls to provide a central location for students to exchange extra tick­ets. Ifhall governments decide to take advantage of the optional program, student government will provide a banner that has a "give" and "take" section for each game, with space for the

In response to vandalism directed at the Right to Life Club's white cross demonstra­tion in October, the group has chosen to display the crosses on South Quad again, from Wednesday to Friday. 
Right to Life co-president Janel Daufenbach said the club decided to repeat the cross demonstration to bring the issue of abortion to promi­nence on campus. 
"We put them up to remind people of the truth of abor­tion," said Daufenbach. "The cemetery got torn down, and we don't think people can hide from the truth." 
When the club organized the first demonstration in early October, about 900 of 1,200 crosses were knocked down during the night. 
This display marks the first year the cross demonstration has taken place more than once during a scho.ol year. Previously, Right to Life set up the crosses for one day during

Food services survey for changes 
Dining halls look for student opinions 
By NICOLE ZOOK News Writer 
Well-known for efforts to 
improve campus life, this month 
stuchmts will have their chance 
to upgrade at least the quality 
of the food served in the dining 
halls. as establishments on both 
campuses conduct satisfaction 
surveys. 
Last week, Saint Mary's Food Services distributed about 300 surveys in the Noble Family Dining Hall so students could provide opinions on issues ranging from the food served to the cleanliness of the facility. Notre Dame will also send out online surveys to students later this month. 
Saint Mary's Food Services director Barry Bowles said he personally gave the survey to students as they left the build­ing and looks forward to seeing the results. 
"We take the "Surveys and send them out to be tabulated. ... We won't have the results for about two weeks," he said. "I already know not everybody is happy with what we do, and that's why I don't look at the surveys before we send them in." 
Bowles said the surveys would be extremely useful this year, as large numbers of stu­dents participated. Last year, 17 percent of the student popula­tion provided results. This year, he estimates about 30 percent of students filled out surveys. 
"We review them. and if it's something I can change, we change it," he said. 
South Dining Hall general manager Marc Poklinkowski also said gauging student reac­tion is important to food servic­es. 
"A lot of the things that we do are based on student reac­tions," he said. "We're going to be doing Ia survey] in November, and I think this will be the first year we're going to do a second one to see how opinions change." 
Based on previous surveys, Notre Dame has extended din­ing hall hours, included new menu items, increased vegetari­an and vegan options and changed from an 8-day menu rotation to a 12-day cycle. 
"We noticed that once we started [the surveys], freshmen and sophomores liked South Dining Hall's variety, but our ratings weren't as high with juniors and seniors," Poklinkowski said. "Now, instead of things showing up 28 times a year, it's down to 19. That's cutting 33 percent of repetition out of our menus." 
North and South Dining Halls each serve around 2,300 stu­dents per meal, and. Saint Mary's generally feeds about 800 at each meaL Bowles, for-

this very thing happnnnd to me my 
l'irst ynar at Notrn Damn. 

I livnd in Hnno, Nev. for 1 X years 
of my life. and going away to sehool 
in Indiana was the biggnst adven­
ture of my life. As I was prnparing 
to eornn home for llw sumnwr. rny 
parnnts dropped a hugn·bomb on nw: "We'n~ thinking of moving." The prospncl of rnloeating in itsnlf is a big dnal, but thnn llwy addnd. "To llw Marshall Islands." 
So lwgan onP of the strangest and most intPrPsting yPars of my lifn. 
Crantnd. I didn't have to physi­cally movn to tlw Kwajalainn Atoll. a tiny island of about 2,000 pnople which is l'ivn miles long by half a milo wide, but lluml was a dnl'in'ite snnsn that things worn very diiTnr­nnt. My entire family had to gnt major physicals and military dear­ancn in order to go. and wn could only takn one of our family pets over llwrc. When I called my par­nnts from school. it was already the nnxt day since they wnrn past the intnrnational dateline, and our cat had l'ights with sand crabs. I ol'ten fnlt like I was related to the cast of "Gilligan's Island." 
I went to visit my family during Christmas break. and it took me thnw days, five airports and Christmas Eve in a hotel alone in llonolulu to get there. The week I spent there was both fun and strange, because I was basically in a tropical paradise without any erowds, but I finally realized that my family literally lived in the mid­dle of nowhere. Nothing is quite as seary or liberating as knowing that your parents are an entire ocean away from you. 
While my family was living the island life, I thought that it was the worst thing that could have ever happened to me. Looking back at it now, I have a different perspective. There are a lot of things worse than your parents moving to an island, and I have a great experi­ence to write about if I apply to grad school. Most importantly, I realized that my family could sur­vive anything, whether it be mov­ing, sand crabs or an entire year of "Gilligan's Island" jokes.

Walsh Hall natnes 2004 Mr. ND 
Mr. Knott, sophomore John Lyons, wins fourth annual competition 
By SARAH BARRETT 
News Writer 
The cream of the Notre Dame men's crop competed in the fourth annual Mr. ND Pageant Wednesday, as men from 13 of the male dorms on campus competed for the elu­sive title. 
Each contestant allowed the 150 attendees get to know them a little bit better by per­forming their diverse talents ranging from poetry readings,· song and dance and piano playing to magic tricks, karate and even baking. 
lleld in the LaFortune Ballroom, this event was put together by sophomore Kathleen O'Brien as part of Walsh Hall's 'Wild Week' and raised money for boxes of to donate to the South Bend Center for the Homeless. 
Auctioning off the contest­ants after the pageant as dates for Walsh Hall's dorm dinner, the organization raised $85. 
!laving been serenaded, kissed on the hand and bribed with cookies, the judges declared John Lyons, Jeffery Stephens, Spence Zervoudakis, Brandon Ilollihan and Pete Lavorini as the top five contestants, allowing them to move on to the second round of the pag­eant. The round consisted of questions concerning the con­testants' favorite meal at the dining hall, their feelings on thefacebook.com and popped­collars and the color and con­tents of their own 'man­purse' if they had one. 

Sophomore John Lyons last year's first runner-up and this year's winner said the pageant was a fun experi­ence. 
"It was pretty cool, just a bunch of great guys goofing around and having a great time," Lyons said. 
O'Brien felt that the talent­ed contestants made for a wonderful pageant. 
"It was a lot of work but I am glad it turned out really well," O'Brien said. "I hadn't had a lot of experience run­ning a campus event but it turned out to be a lot of fun."

Arafat, 75, dies after lapsing into con1a 
Future of Palestine, people unknown 
Associated Press 
RAMALLAH, West Bank­Yasser Ararat, who tri­umphantly forced his people's plight into the world spotlight but failed to achieve his life­long quest for Palestinian statehood, died Thursday at age 75. 
The French military hospi­tal where he had been treated for nearly a month said he died at 3:30 a.m. The Palestinian leader spent his final days there in a coma. 
Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat and Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a top Arafat aide, con­firmed that Arafat died in a conversation with reporters at Arafat's headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah. 
White House spokesman Trent Duffy said the adminis­tration was waiting to com­ment until it confirmed Arafat had died. The State Department had no immedi­ate comment. 
The Palestinian parliament speaker will be sworn in as Palestinian Authority presi­dent in the coming hours. 
Palestinian officials have said they want to ensure a smooth transition. Under Palestinian law, Parliament Speaker Rauhi Fattouh, a vir­tual unknown, is to become caretaker pre~ident until elections are held in 60 days. 

. Arafat's last days were as murky and dramatic as his life. Flown to France on Oct. 29 after nearly three years of being penned in his West Bank headquarters by Israeli tanks, he initially improved but then sharply deteriorated as rumors swirled about his illness. 
Top Palestinian officials flew in to check on their leader while Arafat;s 41-year­old wife, Suha, publicly accused them of trying to usurp his powers. Ordinary Palestinians prayed for his well being, but expressed deep frustration over his fail­ure to improve their lives. 
Arafat's failure to groom a successor complicated his passing, raising the danger of factional conflict among Palestinians. 
A visual constant in his 

checkered keffiyeh headdress, 
Arafat kept the Palestinians' 
cause at the center of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. But he 
fell short of creating a 
Palestinian state, and, along 
with other secular Arab lead­
ers of his generation, he saw 
his influence weakened by the 
rise of radical Islam in recent 
years.

Forces storm Dutch house, end standoff with terror suspects 
TilE IIAGUE, Netherlands -Special forces overpowered two suspected Islamic extremists Wednesday after a daylong armed standoff, adding to Dutch concerns that global terrorism has spread into their corner of Europe. 
Police said five more suspects were detained in two other cities on a day that possible links emerged between the Muslim militant charged with murdering a Dutch filmmaker a week ago and terrorists allegedly involved in attacks and plots in Morocco and Spain. 
The bloodshed began when police tried to force their way into a house in the Laak working-class neighborhood at 2:45 a.m. and a suspect threw a grenade, seriously injuring an officer, authorities said.

Opening a second front, gue-rrillas mounted attacks in other cities and kidnapped three relatives of Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. 
Troops found "hostage slaughterhouses" where foreign captives had been killed. according to the Iraqi commander, Maj. Gen. Abdul Qader Mohammed Jassem Mohan. The abandoned houses had hostages' doc­uments, CDs showing cap­tives being killed, and black clothing worn by militants in videos. 
But it appeared troops did not find any of the at least nine foreigners still in kidnappers' hands ­including two Americans.

The resolution spndlies that the Ticket Share Program is designed to be a frne exehange, and that nxchanges in one dorm are not limitnd to resi­dents of that dorm. 
Ofr.eampus students ean use the OIT-eampus Wnb site as their exchange system. 
"llanding dorms a program that will work is thn best idea for the situation. and shows that student government cares," Badin senator Lizzi Shappell said. 
The resolution passed unani­mously. 
Senate also diseussed an amendment to' the S(lction of the studnnt union constitution about general student body elections, but it eould not be fully debated or voted on because of Sonato rules. 
The changes mainly concern write-in eandidates and run-oil' elnctions. 
Under r.urrnnt rules, write-in candidates -those who missed the deadline to appear on the ballot or switched tickets ­need only 150 signatures on a petition to be approved. 
The amended rule requires 50 percent of the required sig­naturns for the position to bn submitted. That would mean in thn presidential raee that rnquires 700 signatures for a eandidate to appnar on the bal­
lot, a write-in can­didatn would need 350.

MGM Mirage to build megacasino 
LAS VEGAS -Gambling giant MGM Mirage intends to build a new 4,000-room megaresort and sprawling urban develop­ment in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, a project that would dramatically change the landscape of this city's most important commercial center. 
MGM Mirage officials are calling the ambitious plan "Project CityCenter," and they believe it will help transform Las Vegas into a sophisticated, multidimension­al city, one that rivals other major metro­politan areas. 
"Our master plan represents a significant new direction for our city and our compa­ny," !;laid Terry Lanni, MGM Mirage Inc.'s chairman and chief executive. 
The multibillion-dollar project includes three, 400-room boutique hotels, approxi­mately 550,000 square feet of retail shops, dining and entertainment venues, and a 1,650-unit luxury condominium complex. 
The massive development will be built on a 66-acre site between the Bellagio and Monte Carlo hotel-casinos, with the first phase creating 12,000 jobs. 
U.S. dollar slumps to all-time low 
BERLIN -The U.S. dollar slumped to a new all-time low Wednesday against the euro, which briefly rose above $1.30 for the first time after data showed the U.S. trade deficit above $50 billion in September for the fourth straight month. · 
The euro briefly rose to $1.3007 after the trade figures were released, breaking its two­day-old record of $1.2987 before dropping back. In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.2895, down slightly from $1.2903 late Tuesday. 
The dollar's recent drop against the 12­nation European currency's recent rally has been fueled by persistent worries over high oil prices and the U.S. trade and budget deficits. 
September, which beat most forecasts with exports posting their best month on record.

Federal Reserve ups interest rates 
One-quarter percentage point increase cited to ameliorate economy 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The Federal Reserve boosted a key short-term interest rate by one-quarter per-" centage poii;Jt Wednesday. Citing an improving econ­omy and "well contained" inflation, it said further increases would be grad­ual. 
The rate increases are part of a credit-tightening campaign to bring rates back up to more normal levels now that the econo­my's recovery from the 
+0.37 49.76 +0.36 42.54 +0.57 35.71 -0.08 20.29 

2001  recession is  more  
deeply rooted.  
Fed  Chairman  Alan  
Greenspan  and  his  

Federal Open Market Committee colleagues ­who set interest rate poli­cy in the United States ­increased the target for the federal funds rate to 2 percent from 1.75 per­cent. 
The funds rate is the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans and is theFed's pri­mary tool for influencing economic activity. 
In response to the Fed's decision to push up the funds rate, Wells Fargo said it was increasing by a corresponding amount its prime lending rate for many short-term con­sumer and business loans to 5 percent from 4. 7 5 percent. Other commer­cial banks were expected to follow suit. 
The Fed's current rate­raising campaign began in June with a quarter­point boost, marking the first rate increase in four years. The Fed bumped up rates again by a quar­ter-point in August and September and then once more Wednesday. 
Fed policy-makers stuck to their view that future rate increases would be gradual. They said rates could rise at a pace likely to be "measured," retain­ing language contained in previous statements. 
On the economy, the Fed said it "appears to be 

growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, ami labor market conditions have improved." 
The Fed also said infla­tion and longer-term inflation expectations "remain well contained," another reason the Fed can stick with its gradual approach to raising rates. 
The vote was unani­mous. 
"Monetary policy-mak­ers seem quite pleased with the current state of the economy," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Bane of America Capital Management. Still, she said, "The Fed's task is not complete. Policy-mak­ers want to see rates at more normal levels with the belief the economy no 
longer needs the prop of 
excessively low interest 
rates." 

Economists believe the 
odds are increasing for 
the Fed to boost the funds 
rate again on Dec. 14, at 
its last meeting of the 
year. Before the good 
news on October payrolls, 
many economists believed 
the Fed would probably 
stand pat at the 
December meeting. 

On Wall Street, the Dow 
Jones industrials were up . around 10 points in trad­ing after the Fed's 
announcement. 

The Fed's latest rate 
increase comes as many 
economists believe the· 
economy has emerged 
from a late spring and 
early summer soft patch. 
The economy added a sizable 337,000 jobs in October, the most since March, the government said last week. While the figures were helped by job gains related to hurri­cane cleanup efforts, they nonetheless raised hopes that the recovery in the labor market, which has been uneven, is gaining some real traction. 
The pickup in October's payrolls was welcome news to President Bush, who sparred frequently with Democratic rival John Kerry over the health of the labor mar­ket and job losses that have occurred since Bush took office in January 2001. 


Calif. settles lawsuit with Diebold 
Associated Press 

SAN FRANCISCO -Diebold Inc. agreed Wednesday to pay $2.6 mil­lion to settle a lawsuit filed by California alleging that the electron­ic voting company sold the state and several counties shodd·y voting equipment. 
Although critics characterized the settlement as a slap on the wrist, Diebold also agreed to pay an undis­closed sum to partially reimburse Alameda, San Diego and other coun­ties for the cost of paper backup ballots, ink and other supplies in last week's election. California's sec­retary of state banned the use of one type of Diebold machine in May, after problems with the machines disenfranchised an unknown num­ber of voters in the March primary. 
Faulty equipment forced at least 6,000 of 316,000 voters in Alameda County, just east of San Francisco, to use backup paper ballots instead of the paperless voting terminals. In San Diego County, a power surge resulted in hundreds of touch­screens that wouldn't start when the polls opened, forcing election offi­cials to turn voters away from the polls. 
According to the settlement, the North Canton, Ohio-based company must also upgrade ballot tabulation software that Los Angeles County and others used Nov. 2. Diebold must also strengthen the security of its paperless voting machines and computer servers and promise never to connect voting systems to outside networks. 
"There is no more fundamental right in our democracy than the right to vote and have your vote counted," California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said in a state­ment. "In making false claims about its equipment, Diebold treated that right, and the taxpayers who bought its machines, cavalierly." 
The original lawsuit was filed a year ago by electronic voting critic Bev Harris and activist Jim March.who characterized the $2.6 million settlement as "peanuts."

Cadet Captain Patrick Mcllugh, a senior in the Army HOTC, acknowledged the unity that the vigil cultivates between the three branches on campus. 
"It's a chance for us to gather all three branches of the mili­tary," McHugh said as he waited his turn to stand guard at the fountain. "It reminds us or the distinct brotherhood and sister­hood that unites all members of' the military. We're all out here for the same reason."

for Veterans Day. 

"We play sports against each other, but this is an opportunity to come together and show sup­port for all veterans," Zervoudakis said. 
Sandwiched between Halloween and Thanksgiving, Veterans Day is a holiday not always given a great amount of attention. Yet, Mike Edwards, retired Lt. Col. and retired pro­fessor of military seienee, believes Notre Dame does a fine job of acknowledging the impor­tance of the holiday. 
"I think it's terrific the way the HOTC programs commemorato the holiday," Edwards said. "They absolutely do an ade­quate job of showing apprecia­tion for veterans." 
Wednesday at 5 p.m., the Air Foree Hifle Drill Team per­formed a routine in front of the fountain. The nine members performing the routine were in full uniform. 
Many non: membnrs attend­ed the drill tnam routine to view the culmination of the team's hard work. 
"I am amazed at how good our drill team looks. It is very impressive," said freshman Joseph Janke, who was selwd­uled to stand· guard at 8 a.m. today.

"In my experiences here, it is always the most meaningful when the old veterans come up to us with tears in their eyes saying thanks," she said.

Supplen1ent linked to disease 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A New York City company is recalling two Chinese herbal supplements because they contain a carcino­gen linked to kidney disease, the company said Wednesday. 
Kingsway Trading Inc. of Brooklyn said it is rPcalling its dietary pills Double Deers Formula brand Expellin Extract (Concentrated) and Cardioflex. lbe company said it stopped dis­tribution of the products after being notified by the Food and Drug Administration that they contain aristolochic acid, a car­cinogen and toxin found in plants that has been associated with some cases of kidney failure and an increased risk of kidney cancer. 
Expellin extract has been mar­keted to relieve headaches and sinus congestion, while Cardioflex is suggested for main­taining cardiovascular and circu­latory health. Both supplements were imported from China and distributed nationwide through retailers and acupuncture clinics since May 2000. 
The FDA confirmed the recall Wednesday and advised con­sumers who have taken the products to contact their health care provider immediately. No illnesses related to the products have been reported, the compa­ny and the FDA said. 

"Even if these products have not been used recently, con­sumers should still inform their health care provider about which product they took, so that an appropriate evaluation may be conducted," said FDA spokes­woman Kimberly A. Rawlings. 
The recall covers all lots of the two products, a total of 2,873 units, the company said. 
Consumers can return the recalled products to their place of purchase for a full refund. The company can be contacted with question~ at 718-366-2300.

Drug exposed as risk, Pfizer stock plunges 
Painkiller dangerous for heart disease patients 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS -A. scien­tist's claim of evidence that Pfizer Inc.'s Bextra might be even riskier for people with heart disease than rival arthri­tis drug Vioxx sparked contro­versy Wednesday at a medical meeting and sent the company's stock lower. 
Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a University of Pennsylvania car­diologist who helped test these types of drugs years ago, told a medical conference that he had reanalyzed some previously published studies on Bextra and concluded that it roughly doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes 
the reason 

warning of risks in heart dis­ease patients, and to do larger studies to define their safpty for people with arthritis but not heart risks. 
He and others have criticized Merck and the FDA for not removing Vioxx before 80 mil­lion people took it and the risks became known. 
In an opinion piece in the New England Journal of Medicine last month, FitzGerald argued that studies long ago s-uggest that thP problems with Vioxx aore a "class effect" shared by other cox-2 inhibitors.

Pfizer, which besides Bextra also sells a similar painkiller, Celebrex, complained FitzGerald had selectively cho­sen data that made results appear worse than they were from larger studies of Bextra's safety. 
"Pfizer has shared Bextra clinical results in a timely man­ner with regulatory authorities both in the United States and worldwide," said Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer's president of worldwide development.

In light of the Vioxx with­drawal and his alleged new analysis showing risks of Bextra, "This has shifted the burden of proof onto those who would have to establish that this is not a class effect," he said. 
The Food and Drug Administration plans to con­vene an advisory committee in February to review the safety of all cox-2 inhibitors. 
"We look forward to a scien­tific and reasoned evaluation in this appropriate setting," Pfizer's Feczko said. 
Shares of Pfizer fell 52 cents, or 2 percent, to close at $27.47 on the New York Stock Exchange, only slightly above their 52-week low of $27.20.

First and foremost, last Tuesday saw the highest percentage of votHr turnout since the 1968 election. or particular interest was the fact that some· 20.9 million Americans under the age of thir­ty voted. This marks an increase of 4.6 million from the 2000 election -I'm sure this can be largely attributed to P. Diddy's inspiring "Vote or Die" cam­paign. In short, Democrats and Hepublicans alike emphasized the importance of getting out and voting, and the country responded. 
Another positive element of this campaign came as a result of last month's debates. Both candidates were efl'ective in using the debates to ener­gize their bases. More importantly, Sen. John Kerry and President George W. 
Bush used the forum to help bring sev­eral key issues to the foref'ront of' voters' consciousness. Obviously, the war on terrorism, Bush's. war in Iraq, abortion, gay rights and the economy dominated the debates. However, the contests also caused people to think about taxes. health care and Supreme Court nomi­nations. Hegardless of which candidate was more eff'cctive in the debates, they both succeeded in bringing thnse topies into our national discussion. 
If you arc anything like me, you arc not thrilled with the idea of Bush in oflice for four morn years. Still it is important to support the president and the Unitnd States. I have heard many people claim that they are going to !nave the country until the 200!~ elec­tion. Do not go packing your bags quite yet. It is time to stop complaining and begin trying to make a diiTerence in America. Do not let the issues that you felt so passionately about prior to last Tuesday go to rest until the next elec­tion cycle. 
This is not a time for partisanship. This is a time for people in Hod States and Blue States to band together and try to repair some of the deep divisions in our country. For Democrats, that does not mean that you should go invest in a NASCAR bumper sticker to put on your car. Instead, start with something simple. Whnther or not you agree with 
the war in Iraq. it is important to sup­
port tho troops. Bather than complain­
ing about the war and its causes, stand 
behind the brave men and wonHm who arc ovnrscas dd'ending our rights. 
Similarly, this is not a time for Hepublieans to tout ~political capital" or gloat about a supposed mandate. Instead. it is a time to reach out to Dmnoerats and look for some common ground. For the president, a good start would be to hoed tlw words of his oppo­nent. Kerry. In his eonenssion spnPch hn rmninded tlw country, "But in an American election, thern arn no losers. because whother or not our candidates are successful. th1~ next morning wn all wake up as Americans. That is the greatest privilege and tho most remark­able good fortune that can come to us on Earth. With that girt also comes obligation. We are required now to work together for tho good of our coun­try."

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Show some consistency in your loyalty 
To the current students of the University, I feel the need to enlighten those who may be confused regarding the leader­ship of our football team. This past Saturday, Notre Dame students stared at their television sets in a fixed glaze of dis­belief, excitement and, for some, relief. Eyes were glued until the very last second of play to ensure the Irish vietory. 
Following the game, students bellowed out in excitement; running through dorm hallways and chanting down South Quad, only to be followed moments later by silence and crude ro11ection: if we can beat Tennessee (no. 11) and Michigan (no. 9), then why can't we defeat the mainstream teams like BYU and Boston College (no. 21 )? 
Students, who moments before wore heard avidly com­mending our fearless student-athletes, were still complain­ing about the leadership of coach Tyrone Willingham. In addition to doubtful believers, the alumni's impatient, hard­to-satisfy attitude seems to eclipse our community's air of success. 
First, I feel that it is impHrative for me to share certain facts with you about college football. In today's world, there is more parity in college football compared to the "glory days" under coaching legends such as Hockne, LPahy, Parseghian and lloltz. The resilient streak of Notre Dame's football preeminence -11 national championships from 1924-l<JHH-made Notre Dame college football's bench­mark for excPIIence. Dw~ to the reduced number of scholar­ships and the expansion of television game coverage, there are now many exceptional football programs throughout thfl country. That's why smaller teams like Baylor can defeat his­
. torically dominant programs like Texas A&M (no. 22). The ship is clearly turned in thP right dirnction, and now is not the time to take the wind out of the sails. Defeating Michigan and Tennessee demonstrates the caliber of our team. The school doesn't need disruption now, from the alumni or band-wagon fans. Instead, it needs to fill the holes and develop consistency. Willingham's presPnee will develop that consistency. You will have some of the best high school 
football players aspiring to play under Willingham. Let's not dwell on the losses of the past and lose the next year or two's future All-Americans beeause of the uncertainty of Notre Dame football leadership. 
Willingham has proven that in addition to high academic standards, both at Stanford and Notre Dame, he has been able to attract and motivate football players that can play at a top 25 program level. Be careful what you wish for, alum­ni, for if Willingham leaves, he will be sucecssful at whatev­er job he takes-college or professional level. (Could you imagine him taking the Florida head coaching job, with a hot bed of Florida talent without the academic pressure in addi­tion to the incredible economic support that the University of Florida's football program is accustomed to n~ceiving. lle'd probably have a national title within three years.) 
If Willingham and the Irish beat no. 1 USC in the Memorial Coliseum, that should guarantfle him a contract ren~~wal. The alumni, as well as the student body, m~ed to realize that our football organization is well equipped with somn of the best coaches and student-athletes that put it on the line every weekend. As the saying goes, football game day is like "Any Given 'Saturday."' The jesters of the court could bring mighty kings to their knees on a so-called "good day." Thfl players cannot blame anyone if they fail; there arfl simply no excuses on the athletic lield. Hather, they must be prepared for their next opponent who would love nothing more than to boast about beating tlw Irish. We are tho fans, they are the coaches; they are the players; and "We are all NI>." They nPed our support. They l11Wd our eneouragenwnt. And they need our loyalty now more than ever. That is the essence of the Notre Dame "family." To the players and coaches I say this: Get 'er donn, and Go Irish!

'The Year of the 1Eucharist' 
Are you sick of politics? Consider the derivation of the word. Some say that "poli'' means many and "tics" are little blood-sucking creatures. The profes­sion of politics, of course, is honorable. But, whatever side we were on in the recent Charles Rice election, we can be excused if we suspect Right or that politicians don't Wrong? have all the answers, neither for what ails the country nor for the issues in our own lives. Maybe it is time to look elsewhere. 
When John Paul II instituted Eucharistic adoration at St. Peter's basilica in 1981, he said: "The best ... way of establishing everlasting peace on the face of the earth is through,.. Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament." For many years, Notre Dame has had the Eucharist exposed for adoration on Friday afternoons in the Basilica. Since 1997, on student ini­tiative and with the aid of Campus Ministry, we have adoration also on Monday through Thursday in the Coleman-Morse chapel. . 
Why is this important? First of all, because Christ is really there. "In the ... Eucharist, the body and blood, ... soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ and, therefore, the whole Christ is truly, really and substantially con­tained. This presence is called real, by which is not intended to exclude the other types of presence ... but because it is presence in the fullest sense ... it is substantial presence by which Christ, God and man, makes himself wholly and entirely present." (Catechism, no. 1374) 
This reality will come as a news flash to many Catholics. Surveys show that 70 percent of Catholics in the 18 to 44 age group believe the Eucharist is merely a in work; when all seems to go awry, they spend .an hour in prayer before the Blessed Sacrament. This practice has never failed to bear fruit; they experience peace and strength."

Recent years have seen a resurgence of adoration in parishes and Catholic colleges. When you do it, you will see the reason.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Wake up Americans 
Do you remember that day during senior year of high school when you got that fat envelope with the Notre Dame seal? Why were we the ones selected from a huge applicant pool? According to Admissions, it wasn't because we were Catholic. 
Instead, each of us showed that we were enthusiastic leaders, crit­ical thinkers and difference-makers. Under this impression, I was upset to read Orlando Rubiano's letter and hear his call for the entire Notre Dame family to define our views entirely in terms of Catholic teaching. Although not all Notre Dame students define themselves religiously as Roman Catholic, most, if not all, of us define ourselves politically as Americans. · 
Catholics strive to live according to Church teaching, but how many succeed? We must remember that there is more to Catholic doctrine than opposing abortion and upholding the sanctity of mar­riage. Among other things we, as Catholics, are called to humble ourselves to the Lord -often difficult to do -take no part in the seven deadly sins -I remind this campus that drunkenness is a form of gluttony -and love all our neighbors, regardless of their faiths. Until each of us can truly live according to all Catholic princi­ples, we cannot expect non-Catholic Americans to live by them as well. · 
Rubino said that Sen. John Kerry's stance on abortion was that of a coward. Although Kerry's position may be weak from a Catholic viewpoint, from an American viewpoint, it is courageous. After all, since when is defending the constitutional rights of Americans a cowardly action? We are proud to call heroes the thousands of Americans who have given their lives defending our rights and free­doms, including freedom from religious tyranny. As we live our lives, I hope that we all remember that we were accepted into Notre Dame because of our ambition to change the world for the better. Each of us will, at one time or another, have the opportunity to do so. Let us use tha·t time to make America, and the world, a better place for all people, not just those who agree with our Catholic beliefs.

utes, just sitting there? 
Suppose I fall asleep?" As Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen noted, "that's the way the Apostles made their first Holy Hour in the Garden." So falling asleep should not be a concern. Just be there to spend time with Christ. 
Why do it? Because it works. When Mother Teresa was asked, "What will convert America and save the world?" she replied: "My answer is prayer. What we need is for every parish to . come beforE Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament in holy hours of prayer." 
John Paul II has proclaimed the Year of the Eucharist, from October 2004 to 
The turn of the century has provoked a fight for the rights of gays. Ga.y marriage has been· outlawed in almost a dozen states. The Catholic Church has deemed homosexuals morally corrupt, saying 1that it is acceptable for a person to acknowledge to him or herself that he or she is, in fact, a homosexual, but that that person is not allowed to act upon his or her inner acceptance. While homosexual inter­course is being frowned upon by the Church, there are many Catholics who are engaging in adultery. Despite having adultery laws in place in 26 states, there has only been one prosecu­tion in the past five years. Why has the Catholic Church not pushed for a national law criminalizing adultery? Is it not expressly writ­ten in the Ten Commandments? 
There are many who do not fol-October 2005. "During this year," he said, "take the time to kneel before Jesus present in the Eucharist, ... to make reparation ... for the neglect, and even the insults which our Saviour must endure in many parts of the world." 
"Christians," continued John Paul, "should not be afraid to speak about God and to bear proud witness to our faith. The 'culture of the eucharist' promotes a culture of dialogue.... [O]ur troubled world, which began the new millennium with ... terrorism and· ... war, demands that Christians learn to experience the eucharist as a great school of peace, forming men and women who, ... in social, cultural and political life, can become promote.rs of dialogue and communion." John Paul encouraged young people to "[b]ring to your encounter with Jesus, hidden in the eucharist, ....all the enthusiasm of your age, all your hopes, all your desire to love." 
So if politicians don't have all the answers, it might be a good idea to look to someone else.

With these examples, it is easy to see the mis­translations that often lead to t)1e Biblical text being misconstrued. 
Where would Jesus stand on homosexuals? The Catholic Church would like for us to believe that Jesus would express disapproval of such a group. But, when we examine Jesus' teachings historically, social pariahs of the times, such as prostitutes and lepers, were welcomed. His acceptance of all teaches us to love our neighbors, regardless of their reli­gious belief, or any other view that they hold. How can we force our religious views on peo­ple who do not believe in them? This is the purpose behind the separation of Church and 
State in the Constitution. The gov­
ernment is not allowed to endorse 
the men of Bible have m.[l.ny wives? God did not puni~:h them for their polygamy. The writer of the phrase "the two shall be one flesh" is Moses, who had two wives. The monogamous requirement of marriage started in Roman culture, and had no roots in the Bible. Seeing: this, it is easy to understand how biblical passages are often misinterpreted. 
The Bible also never explicitly condemns homosexual relationships. The passages often cited to denounce homosexuality contain incor­rect translations from the original Greek and Hebrew texts. Research proves that the Revised Standard Version of the Bible, first used in 1946, was the first version of the Bible to use the word homosexual. The word "homo­sexual" itself has no parallel in Hebrew or Greek, and only came into being around one­hundred years ago with the combination of the Greek "homo" and the Latin "sexualis." Translations of the Greek "malakoi" and "arsenokoites" into "effeminate" with regards to homosexual men are equally incorrect. Even sodomy, which has been used to describe the act of homosexual interc-ourse, was not a word will go to heaven and who will 
not. Because of this, it is not right for the Catholic Church to ostracize a portion of society that does not follow its teachings. 
The Church cannot continue to condemn the gay lifestyle through the advocacy of laws that govern people who do not always believe in the Catholic faith. It is important that the Church recogniz'es that gays are people. Biblical pas­sages that are cited in support of why homo­sexuality is morally wrong are mistranslations and therefore misinterpretations. I am not gay, but I believe that gays should receive the equal rights the Constitution guarantees to every American. I urge America as a whole to accept the gay community for what it is. There are too many misconceptions about gays. Just as race and gender should have no place in how peo­ple are viewed, neither should sexual orienta­tion. It is time for a new rights movement­one that accepts all people as they are.

ALBUM REVIEWS 

Fans get a dose of Lennon unplugged 
By JULIE BENDER Scen.e Music Critic 
Pulling things apart to see what is on tlw inside oftm1 fascinat<1S little kids. Tlwy want to know what makns a clock ti\'.k, or how a gumhall pops out when you put a J>Pnny in tlw maehinn. 
It happnns that musk fans as wnll take innocnnt dPiight in hearing songs stripp(HI to tlwir· barn boned, outtake versions. At limns fans havn taken this delight to nxtrnnws. like thn rumored circulation of tapes containing nothing 1110n1 than Bob Dylan's lwavy breathing. Most fans, howevnr, prize the musical side of tlwir favorite artist's "unplug­ging." .John Lennon fans arn thn latest to be treated to songs stripped down to tlwir d(1mo-versions with the rPiease of "Acoustic." 
Every ynar, between thn anniversaries of Lnnnon's birthday in October and his death in December, his widow Yoko Ono releases a collection of songs in his remembrance. This year marks what would have been Lennon's 64th birthday and the 24th year since his death, and "Acoustic" is Ono 's fitting tribute to her late husband. 

The album is a collection of 16 songs from Lennon's solo-era songbook. Although most of tlwse versions have bmm rel(1ased before. primarily on "The .John Lennon Anthology," there are seven tracks seen here for the first time, including "Cold Turkey," "Real Love" and a cutting "Working Class llero." 
This unplugged, acoustic arrangement is a suitable and flattering format for Lnnnon 's songs. Known for his honest and direct lyrics, the minimal guitar aceompaniment delivers Lennon's voice with an endearing clarity. Making the album even more attraetive is the know!­

edge that L(~nnon was self-conscious about his voice. On polished recordings he often mixed his own vocal tracks, obscuring the natural sound of his voice. On "Acoustic." however, fans get to hear Lennon raw and untaint!1d. 
Althciugh some of the album tracks seem to be throwaway numbers -the dosing track of nothing more than Lennon whistling -there are S(Weral good moments on the album that make it worthwhile. 
The album's highpoint is a touching version of "Watching the Wheels." Originally released on the "Double Fantasy" album, this song is a plaintive del'ensn of Lennon's withdrawal from the rock 'n' roll scene in the late 1970s. Ilappily married and tending to his new­born son during this time, Lennon was criticized by fans for abandoning his music. With "Watching the Wheels," Lennon defends himself singing, ''I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go 'round and 'round I I really love to watch them roll I No longer riding on the merry-go-round I I just had to let it go." 
·Fans will also like the live version of "Imagine," where Lennon re-creates the piano song on his guitar. This song, which has become a worldwide anthem for peace, is givnn a new innocnnce when played acoustieally. The faint sound of the audi~mcP accompanying Lennon on thn chorus, "You may say I'm a dreamer I But I'm not the only one I I hope someday you'll join us I And the world will live as one," adds to the poignancy of this agelnss song. 
Other good tracks on Acoustic are "Heal Love," which the Beatles released

John Lennon fans will find "Acoustic" 
a welcome addition to their CD col­
lections. 
on Anthology II, "The Luck of the Irish," a song decrying thn British for their abuses on Irnland, the stark opener "Working Class llero" and the haunting "My Mummy's Dead." 
For those who arn unfamiliar with· Lennon's solo work. it would be better to start with one of his oth11r albums in order to appreciatn "Acoustic." For vet­eran Lennon fans, however, "Acoustic" will bn a weleome addition to the album collec~tion. Guitar playnrs will f'ind thP album ospecially appealing with the inclusion of the actual tablaturn Lnnnon used, and a chord chart for thn songs. "Acoustic" allows fans to unplug and lis­tnn to Lnnnon in a rwwfound purity, and musieians will be able to acoustieize right along with him.

A'i a rnsult. it is not surprising Hull' Hyders dPddPd to takn a d1anen and sign Jin to his lirst rPcord dmtl. 

Once Jin became a Hull' Hyder, he c~ame out with the single, "Learn Chinese" at the end of 2003, which quickly bneame an underground sueeess. Doe to his Chinese etlmidty and growing undorground popular­itv, lw started to reePive some media attnn­tirm, including a positiw writt1-up in the New York Times. Evnrytl1ing snomnd to be going .lin's way, and his debut album was slatnd liJr an Odobnr 20m releasn. Unlhrtunately. due to snveral delays in production. Hull' Hyders mL'isnd tim opportunity to capitalizn on .lin's growing popularity, and it was not until this past October that his debut, "Thn Hest is llistory." finally materialized. 
Of course the question L'i, was it worth the wait? The answer is yes and no. 
More than anything else, Jin uses his Chinese baekground to distinguish himself from his penrs, tl1rowing out lines like "I ain't your 50 Cent, I ain't your Eminem, I ain't your Jigga Man, I'm a (]1ina man" and "This ain't Bruee Lee, ya'll watch too much TV" At times he also gel'i serious about hL<> expnri­nnecls as a Chinnse-Anwrican, rnltlfring to his strugglns as an aspiring rappnr ("In evnry rap bat.tln, the racn-eard was my downlitll"). lost love ("Then reality attacks I his pops couldn't s11e p<L'it I The fact his son wa'i A'iian but his girlli-icmd W<L'i black") and problmns in China ("Overpopulation. but dcunn just to nwet tlw rweds I It's illegal to havn morn than one send"). 

Although Jin provides a rntu·.h-iwnded li-nsh pPrspectivn lor hip-hop, his rapping is rather ordinary at times. There are instancns when hn lalls in the trap of using the same rhyming sehnmes and patterns ovnr and over, whir.h causes his flows to sometimes beeome repetitive. Furthcnnor11, despite having witty lines here and there, for a renowned freestyler the album a'i a whole lacks the deverness one would expect. 
I Iowcver, the album's biggest flaws are actually the fault of Huff' Hyders, which tries too hard to commercialize the album for mainstream popularity. Even with popular producers like Just Blaze and Kanye West on board, several of the songs sound forced and generic because of plain pop beats, mundane content and dull, unoriginal choruses. This is quite evident on tracks like "Club Song," where Jin repetitively says, "This rr.y club song, this my dub song" and "I Got a Love," where Kanye West rehashed one of his old beats. Even the single that put Jin on the map, "Learn Chinese" has a rather cheesy beat by Wyclef Jean. 
Jin is dearly at his best on tracks where he is not forced to conform to Ruff Ryders' ideas. Jin sounds much better on cuts like "Love Story," "C'mon" and "Thank You" where he sounds like he is coming from the heart, rather than trying to fit a certain mold.

Jin is the latest addition to the New York-based rap group Ruff Ryders. 
But even thesn songs Jack the innovation and production to be true highlighL'i. 
Jin daims he is "a threat to every rapper· in the game or that's ever been it," but that is cnrtainly not the case on "The Hest is History." Whiln he shows signs of hi'i poten­tial throughout, tllis is not an album that will make much of a dent in the hip-hop main­stream. Despite this, it is not entirnly his fault the album falters, since many of thn album's flaws are the result of Hull' Ryders' produc­tion decisions. Hopefully Jin will have more creative control on his nnxt album, so he can tailor his rhymes in a way more suitable for him. Then hip-hop fans will· know for sure whether or not Jin will leave his mark on hlp-hop or just be a forgettable gimmick.

Rascal Flatts still on fire 
By COURTNEY WILSON Scene Music Critic 
With the release of "Feels like Today," Rascal Flatts naturally main­tains its standing as one of the hottest groups in country music today. Five years into its recording career and these multi-platinum simgsters have already achieved numerous billboard hits and music awards. Voted by both the CMA and ACM as a top vocal group, it has produced three soulful and highly acclaimed records. With their stellar good looks, and ever so charming vocals, the members of Bascal Flatts have come to represent a new wave of refreshing pop-country. 
After its release five weeks ago, "Feels like Today" had rapidly climbed its way to the number one spot on the Country Music Billboard Chart and has since maintained a top 
position on the countdown. This week the group comes in at a not so shabby number six, dropping two spots from last week. For Rascal Flatts fans, this should ccime as no surprise. The guys have developed an identifiable sound, well liked for its animated harmonies and communicative lyrics. Like most country artists, the group's songs are characteristically about lil'e and love. Distinctively, however, the members of Rascal Flatts reflect positively on the past, live in the moment, and con­vey confidence toward the future. 
The female audience is sure to respond to this album in that, the majority of the songs portray men in the not so common role of starry-eyed romantics. "Bless the Broken Hoad," tells of the narrator's journey to find­ing his soul mate. It is easily the best song on the entire CD. The chorus is a touching reaction, which repeats "Every long lost dream, lead me to 
Feels Like Today Rascal Flatts 
Lyric Street 




where you are, others who broke my heart they were like the Northern Star, pointing me on my way into your loving arms. This much I know is true, that God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you." 
Traditionally, the Rascal Flatts audi­ence has been made up of predomi­nately young females. With each album, this being the third, the group has progressively matured in its music, and additionally broadened its fan base. Previously released hits such as ''I'm Movin' On," and "These Days," wore clearly geared to a more adult audience. The majority of its songs, however, and especially those on "Feels Like Today;" are interpre­tive and can be widely appre'eiated by most agn groups. 
Hascal Flatts' devotees will enjoy "Here's to You," a fun song dedicated to every type of fan, calling them, "You're the heart and the soul, and the reason we do what we do." 
"Fast Cars and Freedom," as well as "Oklahoma-Texas Line" are two of the more upbeat and 'twangy' tracks you can find on the CD. 
Country boys Gary LeVox, Jay DeMurac and Joe Don Hooney are an undeniably talented and involved group of singers. So much so that they have eo-produced their albums, played their own instruments and col­laborated to create a collection of personal lyrics that hones their suc­cessfully re eogn izab le sound. Comparable. but not limited to. a boy band imago, the trio works perfectly in unison with each other, comple­menting one another's individual styles. 
The album "Fenls like Today," is just another hit album the guys can taek on to their fast growing list of chart toppers.

Jnhn Nolan and Shaun Cooper took a big chance with their careers when they left Taking Bac~k Simday at the height of its succ!'ss in 2003, but they were com­pr~lled by irreconcilable artistic differ­ences with the band. However, separa­tion proved to make Nolan and Cooper's art grow fonder as they teamed up with former Breaking Pangea drummer Will Noon, and Nolan's younger sister, Michelle Nolan, on keyboard and back­ground vocals to form Straylight Hun. Without even releasing an album, Straylight Run has already acquired a loyal following from extensive touring and from making the demo songs avail­able online for free. 
On Oct. 12, however, the band finally released its highly anticipated debut album on Victory Heeords. With mostly piann and guitar-driven tracks, Straylight Hun's self-titled album pro­gresses in a very different direction from Taking Back Sunday. Whereas John was previously known for his intense screaming in back up for TBS, he main­tains more composure on lead vocals, while still earnestly delivering moving inflection throughout the album. Simplicity and sincerity prevail over ostentatious outbursts in Straylight Run's music, yet manages to affect you just as strongly. 
Ironically, the first song on the album is called "The Perfect Ending." 

Accompanied by the piano and under­used glockenspiel, a slightly wistful John rel1ects ttpon the differences that led to the division in Taking Back Sunday. Bather than pointing blame, John reveals tl1e band's acceptance with the past as he sings, "And if it's over/Just remembPr what I tpld ya/lt was bound to happen so jusVKeep moving on/ There's no perfed endings." Despite the title, this song is the perfect beginning for the album by creating a sense of closure with the past and by affirming an identi­ty independent of Taking Back Sunday. 
Straylight Hun picks up the pace on the second track, "The Tension and the Terror." The energy of this flowing melody is continually driven up as John passionately delivers lyrics capturing one's inabjlity to move beyond the fear and anxiety that gets in one's way of fol­lowing his heart. 
The very title of the next track, howev­er, necessitates moving past the tension and the il3rror because we are the one's who control our lives and destinies. "Existentialism on Prom Night" begins softly with the piano on solo, but it is immediatElly intensified with the abrupt entrance of John's voice, which is pro­pelled by the percussion. "Exist­entialism" is an absolutely beautiful song that manages to convey the ineffable feeling that everything in your world is perfectly in balance. Both Michelle and John bring you into an enchanting rap­ture as they repeat, "Sing me something sof1J Sad and delicate/ or loud and out of key/ sing me anything/ we're glad for what we've go1J done with what we've lost/ Our whole lives laid out right in front of us." 
Michelle shows that talent definitely runs in the family as she steps up to lead vocals on two tracks. After the dreamv little number, "Your Name Here (Sunrise_ Highway)," Straylight Hun shakes things up when Michelin takes lead vocal in "Tool Sheds and Hot Tubs," which resembles a dance song by Kylie Minogue. However, Michelle best demon­strates her capability as a lead vocalist through her haunting delivery of "Now it's Done," in which she laments over the "memories of what didn't last." In short, this CD is absolutely incredible and should be at the very top of your Christmas lists this year. Straylight Hun is the result of the members' commit­ment to fulfilling their vision, which has materialized into something that is defi­nitely worth the long wait for its realiza­tion. The album evades predictability and keeps you pulled in until the very end. It gets five shamrocks not only because of its amazing music, but also because of Straylight Hun's enormous potential. As long as the members of Straylight Run maintain the sincerity and vision that has brought them to where they are today, there is no doubt that these existentialists will carve out a bright future.

MLB 
Red Sox alumni salute World Series champs 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Pedro Martinez, Jason Varitek and more than a doz!'n other Hed Sox free agents might want to take advicP from some pnople who know: Stay in Boston, or you'll regret_it. 
"It would be hard to walk away from this city," former Red Sox pitcher Bruce Hurst said before posing for pieturns with the World. Seri<1s trophy. "I would vnnture to guess that thny_'d 1~1iss it more than they'd realize. 
Hurst was inducted into the HPd Sox Ilall of Fame on Wmlnesday night, an opportuni­ty to get together with former tPammates such as Wade Boggs and wallow in the tnam's reefmt success. 
But even as they celebrated the end of one of sports' most ignominious streaks, the ex-Red Sox knew the business of the offseason was in full swing. Boston has 16 free agents, and there is virtually no way the team will keep all of them. 
Hurst knows all about leaving Boston. After the Red Sox came within one strike of ending their championship drought in 1986, he returned to the playoffs with them in '88 but opted to sign with San Diego that offseason. 
At the time, the Padres had an up-and-coming team. But Hurst soon realized the passion and intensity there didn't match what he'd experienced in Boston. 
"We had a million come out [for a parade] and we lost," he said. "I always said 1 couldn't imagine what it would be if we won." 
Hurst doesn't have to imagine anymore, with many more than that turning out for the victory parade last month after the Hed Sox swept the St. Louis Cardinals for their first World Series title since 1918. 
"We don't have to wait until next year," said Boggs, another inductee and another player who left Boston as a free agent. 
"Hopefully, I won't have to look at [video oil myself crying on the bench again," he said, referring to the '86 loss to the New York Mets. "Now when you talk about the Red Sox World Series, the main focus will be from 2004. 
"They won't have to bring up all the bad things." 
Hall of Fame pitcher Dennis Eckersley, a 20-game winner with the Red Sox in 1978, said all the bad things help make this year's win so special. 
"If we had won in '78, I prob­ably wouldn't have understood all the agony they go through up here," he said. "I think you have to spend some time here. You can't just come in and out. 
"You get it pretty quick, though." 
And that's what makes play­ing in Boston different from other places, former outfielder Bernie Carbo said. 



"I would stay here and take less money, or take what I need," he said. "You'll never find a better organization, a better town, a better ballpark. 
"My advice would be to stay here, continue to win, continue to be a family." 
Carbo was honored by the Red Sox Hall of Fame for hitting· the tying home run in Game 6 of the 1975 Series, setting the stage for Carlton Fisk's more famous game-winner in the 12th inning. 
Inducted with Boggs, Eckersley and 'Hurst during the dinner at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center were: 
Bill Carrigan, who won three World Series as a catcher from 1906-16. He was the player­manager from 1913-16 and manager from 1927-29. 
Jimmy Collins, a third base­man and manager from 1901­06 who led the Red Sox to a World Series victory in 1903. 
Billy Goodman, a lifetime .300 hitter who won the AL batting title in 1950 with a .354 aver­age and finished second in MVP voting that year. 
Pawtucket Red Sox owner Ben Mondor, who turned the Triple A team into one of the minor leagues' most successful franchises.

Calling All Men 
by Greg Ruehlmann Intern, Campus Ministry · 
Some things in life are constant. 
Take gravity, for example. A football (or marshmallow) hurled into the air at 
Notre Dame Stadium is bound to come down somewhere. 
Math has givens as well. A one-dollar hamburger plus a one-dollar soda 
equals a two-dollar lunch (unless we're at Reekers, in which case it equals ten 
dollars). 

But there is one fact that history proves to be more constant than anything 
else. More certain than the rising and setting of the sun, it is this: we can't get 
men to sign up for retreats. 
This has held true since the very first retreat, which happened in prehistoric 
times, when two cavewomen approached their male friends. "Thag and Ook," 
they said, "we have a wonderful idea! It's called a 'retreat.' A group of us will come 
together to talk about God, share our feelings, renew the spirituality which sustains 
our existence, and in the process make new cave-friendships and strengthen old 
ones! Isn't that great?" 
Thag and Ook grunted. On the whole, they were skeptical of sharing. Also, they were in the middle of crushing the heads of some antelope with a big rock. 
"You two are something else," the cavewomen exclaimed. "Don't act like it wouldn't be good for you, and a lot of fun! What's more important in life than God? Besides, it's healthy for us to get away from work and stress on occasion. And it's definitely not healthy to keep your feelings bottled up!" 
Thag and Ook made a cavepainting about elephant dung and laughed at it for an hour. When they were finished, Ook grunted, then said to the cavewomen, "Sorry, we've got heads to crush.'' 
As you can see, some things never change. Here we are in the year A.D. 2004 and many men still hesitate to go on retreat. Excuses vary: too much homework, too busy, too tired, too much tou.chy-feely stuff. 
This is surprising, because no guy I've ever met regretted going on a Campus Ministry retreat. Whether it's Freshman Retreat, Sophomore Road Trip, Senior Retreat, NDE or Man's Weekend, there's something for everyone and they're all a guaranteed good time and much-needed break from our crazy schedules. The beauty of a retreat is that it's whatever you want to make of it. If you need reflection time, make it happen. If you need a community to support you and help you talk some things out, it's right there. 
More than once as an undergrad, a retreat weekend proved to be the defining event of a semester for me. So guys, if you've enjoyed the retreat experience like I have, it's time for us to talk it up and challenge the excuses. Encourage your friends and dorm mates to go on retreat. And for you guys who haven't gone yet, it's time to man up and join the club. If you need any more incentive to go, just remember that the cavewoman-to-caveman ratio is definitely in our favor.

NFL 
McNair frustrated chest is still sore after rest 

Associated Press 

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -Steve McNair wants to help .his Tennessee Titans start winning games while redeeming his own sub-par performance this sea­son. 
Now if only his chest would stop hurting whenever he gets out of bed or throws a pass. 
The NFL's co-MVP of 2003 has played through pain from a list of injuries, but he said Wednesday he still can't take a direct hit 2 1/2 weeks after being knocked out of the Titans' 20-3 loss at Minnesota on Oct. 
24. 

"I'm trying to fight through some of the pain and get some throwing in. The thing we're worried about now is, 'Can I take a hit?' If I do take the right hit, it's going to knock me out two to three more weeks," McNair said. 
"That's the Catch-22 we're working with right now." 
McNair was able to throw passes in a one-on-one drill and in a seven-on-seven drill Wednesday, his first work with 
teammates since his latest injury. 
The Titans (3-5) listed him as questionable yet again on their injury report, and coach Jeff Fisher called McNair's limited passing "encouraging." l-Ie said the quarterback's availability will be a game-time decision Sunday against Chicago (3-5). 
'The issue is not throwing the football or running around with the ball, doing those kinds of things. The concern is just a hit," Fisher said. "We want to make sure it's not going to set him back, and any kind of con­tact is going to set him back." 
McNair is frustrated by this latest injury because he came back within two weeks after hn first bruised his sternum in 2000 in a victory over Kansas City. 
He spent two nights in the hospital after being knocked out of a loss to Jacksonville on Sept. 26; which caused him to sit out a loss to San Diego the next week. Then he was caught in a high-low hit on the first play of the second quarter at Minnesota.

Artest wanted time off for rap album and rest 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indiana l'aci1rs forward Hon Artnst said Wndnesday that he asked coach Hick Carlisln for time off bneause of a busy schedule that inrludnd promoting a soon-to­be rPieased rap album; which led to his two-game benching. 
Artnst held a short nnws con­l'on11lC11 bnl'orn Wednesday night's ganH' against the Los Angeles Clippers, and in his usual ambiguous manner. tried to nxplain why hn was benched. 
Artest said that he asked Carlisle for as much as a month ofT to heal his aching body and recover from a particularly busy schedule. 
"My body has been aching, I was going to take some time off and I said it the wrong way," Artnst said. "Everything that happnned wasn't too negative. I kind of surprised the team by wanting to take some games off, just to get back together, maybe stay home for a little bii. rest a littl11 bit and come baek." 
lie certainly surprised Carlisle, who said Tuesday that the situation, "compromised the integrity of the team. It's a pri­vate team matter, and I'm going to leave it at that." 
·"I don't know what that means,'' Artest said. "They probably expected a little more; expected me to play every game. Everybody's different It's early in the season, so I feel like I eould take some time off early and be ready for the long strnteh." 
So Carlisle benched Artest for Tuesday night's win over Minnesota and Wednesday night's game against the Clippers. It is not a suspension, and Artest will not lose any salary. He will return Friday. 
The 24-year-old is scheduled to release his debut rap album later this month and has been spending a lot of time making promotional appearances. 
"I've been doing a little bit too much music, just needed the rest," Artest said. "I've still got my album eoming out Nov. 23. After the album comes out I'm going to make sure all of my time is focused on winning a championship." 
It's the latest in a long line of controvf)rsial situations for Artest, ranging from destroying television monitors at Madison Square Garden two years ago to missing the team flight to Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals at Detroit last season. 

Carlisle tried to downplay the issue before the game Wednesday night. 
"This isn't the Cuban m tssile crisis. It's not life or death, it's not about national security," Carlisle said. "It's just simply about a group of guys n1wding to remind ourselves -all of us -about the sanctity of t1am, and what it's about." 
The message appears to have landed with Artest. 
"It was a good decision," Artest said. "l need the r·est. There's a lot of things going on." 
When asked if he thought the punishment fit the crime, Artest said, "There was no crime done. I think it helped out. I ·was tired. 
"l was doing a lot. I was run­ning around a lot and doing a whole bunch of stuff and I've also been working out, so I think I wore myself down physi­cally, I wore myself down men­tally. I was ready to take some time off, at least like a month off, but two games is enough." 
With so many injuries, the last thing the Pacers needed was to lose another player. 
The Pacers played with just nine players against the Clippers:

visor and playbook to South Florida. But Spurrier told Florida Today that NFL teams shouldn't even bother pursuing him. 
''I've said recently to several peo­ple that if I get baek eoaehing, it will probably be a good college job somewhere," Spurrier said. "It seems like I'm better suited for that. I know I certainly had a lot more suc­cess in the college game than in the NFL. So if I return to coach­ing, I think that would probably be the best idea." 

Spurrier even took a shot at his NFL record. 
"Probably very few NFL teams would want me after the success I had," he said. "Some probably would say that in the right situation I eould be suc­cessful. But if I had a choice, I'd lean toward the college game. Everybody has their own little niche. The college game was certainly a lot better success­wise for me." 
Spurrier withdrew his name from consideration to return to Gainesville, where Hon Zook was fired last month after two­plus seasons. 
Spurrier refused to reveal whether he would have taken the job had it been offered, bu( school president Bernie Machen and athletic director Jeremy Foley weren't planning to extend any invitations with­out a full-blown search-and­interview process -something Spurrier may have felt was a slap in the· face considering his track record with the Gators. 
Now Spurrier could· land else­where, maybe even with anoth­er SEC team. 
Sp.urrier said he would prefer to eoach in a warm-weather climate. South Carolina? North Carolina? How about Texas? 
He declined to say whether he has spoken to any schools. 
"I can't answer all that. I can't answer all your questions. In the next two or three weeks, onee the season is over, we'll see what happens," he said. 
"I think I've made it dear now that if I go baek into c.oaehing, it'll be at a good state university, a college job."

EAST LANSING, Mich. --Two Michigan State football players were arrested and charged with possess­ing a dangerous chemical compound after they allegedly planted home­made bombs that blew up outside campus apartments. 
Terry Lovn and Irving Campbell, both 19-year-old redshirt freshmen receivers, were arrested Tuesday morning as they left the scene of the first explosion, campus police said. A second bomb exploded shortly after­ward, and a third was detonated by the campus pelice bomb squad. 
The men said they planted the bombs in Spartan Village as a prank, campus police Sgt. Florene McGlothian-Taylor said. 
No one was hurt and there was no propPrty damage, McGlothian-Taylor said. The players released on $500 bond after b0ing arraigned Tuesday .. Chiefs p'ut Barber on injured reserve

said. "We've just got to make sure we know what our shot is. I think we are still learning that, but that's a fine line. I love when guys are confident and aggressive. 
"We got to 80 pretty easy tonight, and 80 in a college bas­ketball game is a lot of points. We are shooting it well and making the extra pass out there." 
Playing against a more con­ventional opponent in Quincy, the Irish were able to turn up their deftmsive effort and not just try to keep up with the quick up-and-down pace of St. Joseph's. 
After a slow start. the Irish picked up their energy level and started getting in the face of their opponents and jumping the passing lanes. 
They outrebounded the Hawks 37-33 -including 17 offensive rebounds -and forced 22 turnovers while get­ting 15 steals. 
"I thought we were a lot bet­ter on defense challenging shots, getting hands on balls," Irish guard Chris Thomas said. "We had a lot of guys going after the hall on rebounds. We tried to make a conscious effort of doing it on the defensive end in the backcourt." 
The Irish will practice today and take Friday ofT as they get ready for the regular season opener against I Iarvard Nov. 19 at the Joyce Center. 
Unlike in years past. Brey feels his team has something tangible to gauge itself on and doesn't have to wait for the reg­ular season to start to get an accurate assessment of his group. 
"We got a lot out of both exhi­bition games. We got to prepare for a system," Brey said. "You have a group that isn't going to let up and keep coming after you. Having to prepare is really helpful so I love the rule and I thought I would. 
"This is the first time we can ever say in my memory as a head coach that we got a lot out of both exhibition games." ·

she helped limit the Wildcats' offense to .007 on hitting. 
Coach Debbie Brown says that Henican's most significant contributions cannot be inferred from statistics, how­ever. 
"She takes a really large area of the court as her responsibility," Brown said. "She can really frustrate hit­ters because she's consistent and keeps getting digs. 
"That's something that will never show up in the box scores, but it's a huge part of our success." 
Last year, Henican played a prominent role on the defense as well, becoming the third player in Irish history to record 400 digs in a season. In addition, Henican's efforts were part of the reason Notre Dame limited Big East oppo­nents to a .134 hitting per­centage and set a school record for fewest service aces allowed per game with 0.94. 
"She's always been a fighter and a competitor," Brown said. "We cannot afford to not have her on the court. When we're not doing well, she helps to refocus the group." 
Although the Irish are still focusing on one match at a time, a Big East championship and a long run in the NCAA tournament are still in the back of their minds. 
1-Ienican said she believes the team is capable of fulfill­ing this season-long wish list, as long as they remain focused and play consistently.

announcement in late April arguably spurred the ensuing commit­ments that· rounded out a top national recruiting class. 
"We were. very excited last spring·, and three Wednesdays in a row we were able to hit on those last three guys. Luke, Kyle and then Ryan lc.ommit­ted], in that order I believe," Brey said. "Just like in a game, you can get momentum in great class with a great bunch of guys with, as coach Brey said before, four-year guys." 
The team welcomed its recruits (three unofficial, one official) on visits during the weekend of Sept. 11. The recruits scrimmaged with the existing team to get a feel for how the Irish system fit their style, and vice versa. 
And they came away con­vinced Notre Dame was the place for them. 
"The thing about all the play­ers is they all have high basket­ball IQ," Hillesland said. "It's really easy to go come in and have a piek-up game with them and play good basketball. A lot of times at open gyms the ball fumbles around it's really ugly, but with them everybody knows hovy to play the game." 
Now, each player has an entire year to improve. But all four are eager to succeed under Brey.

You hit a couple 3's, you get some stops and you have a run in a game. You can have a run in recruiting." 
Zeller said all four players' signings was a huge advantage for Notre Dame. 
"I don't know how huge [my signing wasl," he said. "But I know all four of us committing is a huge thing for Notre Dame as an institution. Our class gets me real excited because it's a

Irish knock offQ'unicy @cfjinish up preseason, ink four recruits 
By MATT LOZAR Spons Writer 
The other "Chris" in the Notre Dame back­court slwwnd he's got some game Wndnesday night. 
Chris Quinn's game-high 25 points paced the Irish as thny cruised to an 80-61 vie tory over Division II Quincy at the Joyce Centnr. 
"He's really a heck of a guard and one of the most underrated guards in the l Big East) and nationally," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "It probably won't be as much of a secret in December. [He's] so solid, )the) game comes easy to him, doesn't really force a thing. It's fun to watch his maturity and confidence level growing." 
In his second game in an Irish uniform, sen­ior Dennis Latimore looked more comfortable than he did in the exhibition opener against St. .Joseph's. That game was his first since february 2003. 
Latimore came out more aggressive and with more nnergy on both ends of the floor against the llawks. 
lie hit a eouple of fadeaway jump shots along with getting a breakaway steal leading to an uncontested dunk on the other end. 
"I tried to work on that," Latimore said. "It's a big difl'erenee coming from a practice situa­tion to a game situation. <iame speed is so much quicker. and it took me the whole first game to adjust. I think I'm adjusted to that now." ~ 
That spurt from Latimorn came during a 23­8 run in the first half that saw the Irish turn an 8-5 deficit into a 36-1 (J lead.

Last year, when people thought of Pittsburgh. thny thought of Larry Fitzgerald. This year, however. is difTM­ent. 
T h n I' an the r s o ITn n s e is diverse and still dangerous under t.hn arm of first-ynar starter Tyler Palko. 
Palko has beconw famous for his ambidl'xtrous tosses whiiP !wing prt>ssuwd. 
"lin's versa.tile," Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said. "lie's. doing a great job of protecting tlw football. for tlw most part. 
lie moves around in a timely basis to make it very difficult. And he's putting the ball in the right plaees with his receivers." 
One threat eatching the ball is 5-foot-8 Joe DelSardo. The former wa.Ik-on burned Hutgers Oct. 23 for 105 yards on night catches. DelSardo is orw of live Panthnrs who has rocordod 100-yard receiving gamns this season. Greg Lee is also one of those.

Sealing a promising futurn for a program on the rise, Irish coach Mike Brey announced the commitment of Byan Ayers (Blue Bell, Penn.), Zach llillesland (Toledo, Ohio). Kyle McAlarney (Staten Island, N.Y.) and Luke Zeller (Washington, Ind.) to the Notre Dame basket­ball reeruiting class of 2009 Wednesday morn­ing. 
All four players signed national letters of intent by 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. Brey said the players' commitments add future security and potential to a program already poised for a strong showing in the upcoming season. 
"People wanted to put the moniker 'Fab Four' on them," Brey said from the football conference room in the Joyce Center. "I said, 'Yeah, that's great, with the emphasis on [the word) four' ... beeause they're going to grow up and grow old together in a college basket­ball program." 
Notre Dame assistant coaches pushed recruitment last winter and spring because the team had roster spots to fill. 
"I want to emphasize my assistant eoaches do a great job with that, and every day they're doing something with reeruiting," Brey said. "I think they heard that a lot this summer from their competitors and I'm glad they heard that." 
Hob Kurz, a graduate of Penn Charter high school in Philadelphia, was the lone signer for the dass of 2008, opening the door for sweep­ing recruiting efl"orts. 
"This class needed to be a really talented dass," Brey said. "With the players we were
