Apple's new computer to be sold at discount at ND within 3 weeks 
By MARK WORSCHEH 
News Editor 
The future of Appk Compmers Inc. goes on sale today, and Notre Dame faculty, students and staff soon will be able to get a slice of the action at savings that will exceed 50 percent. 
Within the next three weeks, a General Microcomputer. Inc., store will opt:n in the basement of the LaFortune Student Center offering the new Apple Macintosh personal computer, bilkd by designers as one which could make all others tech­nologically obsolete. 
The Macintosh system, retailing today for S2.49S at computer stores across the United States. will be of­fered here for $1.090. Purchases at reduced prices will be limited to one system per full-time student, faculty or staff member. 
Ease of use separates tht: Macin­tosh from the rest on the market. For instance, the machine comes with no instruction manual. Packed with the system is a software program and an ordinary cassette tape designed to teach the user how to operate the Macintosh in less than two hours. 
Executing many commands on the computer involves the use of a "mouse" -a small box connected to the machine by a wire -whiCh controls the movement of a tiny ar­row on the screen. Typed com­mands are a thing of the past with the new system: options. such a filing or erasing, have bt:en replaced by drawings offolders and trash cans on the scrt:en. To execute, one simp­ly ust:s the "moust:" to direct the ar­row to the correct symbol. 
The Macintosh represents Apple's attempt to take a bite out of IBM':-. hefty 33 percent market share in personal compmers. Apple's share has plungt:d from 47 percent to 28 perct:nt ov<:r the past }Tar, and the company plans to spend SIS million on tdevision and magazint: advt:rtis­ing during tht: next thrn· months promoting tht: new system. 
The Observer rt:portt:d in Novt:m­ber that tht: lhiversity was nt:gotiat­ing with Appk to purchase computers at a substantial discoum, but this is the first time that details of the plan have bet:n made public. 
tinder the agreement, Notre Dame has joined the Apple Univer­sity Consortium and will purchase $2 million of Apple products over the next three years. 
Notre Dame is one of 2-l univer­
sities to join the group, aimed at 
devdoping new applications for

Narcotics agents nab $3.8 billion in largest drug bust ever 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Sixty-two people have been indicted in the "largest nationwide narcotics investigation ever," 30 of them accused of smug­gling five tons ofcocaine worth S 3.8 billion into the United States, au­thorities announced yesterday. 
The 62 were named in indict­ments unsealed yesterday in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami and Little Rock, Ark., with some defendants indicted in more than one city. 
"We believe ... it is the largest nationwide narcotics investigation ever," FBI agent Jim Nelson said in Los Angeles. 
The 30 named in Atlanta were accused of operating what a Justice Department official called "the lar­gest cocaine trafficking ring in the nation's history." 

Associate U.S. Attorney General D. Lowell jensen said the ring smuggled about five tons ofcocaine from Colombia into Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Pennsylvania in 1982 and I983. Of that, authori­ties seized 2,700 pounds worth 
1!940 million, he said. 
"Measured by the amount of 
drugs, it is the largest cocaine 
trafficking ring ever broken up in the history offederal law enforcement," Attorney General William french Smith said. 
The Atlanta indictment, returned Thursday, identified Harold J. Rosenthal, 53, of Atlanta as ringleader ofthe cocaine operation. 
He and five others were charged with violating the federal "drug kingpin" statute by engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. 
Rosenthal escaped from a federal prison in Memphis, Tenn., in I98I and was at large until he was captured in Colombia and deported to the United States in September. 
The indictment said he re-entered 


Campus Ministry begins program 
Special to The Observer 
Campus Ministry inaugurates a new "Catholic Faith Program" tonight aimed at helping students respond "to the challenges of living as a Christian in the world." 
More than 160 students have signed up for six sessions which will be held on consecutive Tuesday nights in three locations on campus. 
North Quad students will meet in Stanford-Kt:enan chapel; South Quad in Lyons Hall chapel; and East Quad in Pasquerilla West chapel. 
The program is designed after ex­
tensive discussions and surveys 
from students and hall-staff mem­
bers. 
Father David Schlaver. director of 
Campus Ministry, said, "We hear stu­dents asking for more guidance in their Christian lives, for more under­standing of the Gospel, and for assis­tance in forming consciences and responding to the challenges of living as a Christian in the world." 
The program is based around the theme "What should Catholics know about?," and six topics have been selected to elaborate on that theme. 
Resource people will be on hand to lead discussions on each topic. "Their relationships with God" (Brother Tom Maddix); "Celebrating the Sacraments" (Dr. 
Loretta ]ancoski ); "Scripture and Tradition" (Father Danjenky, pastor of Sacred Heart Church); "Formation of Conscience" (Sister Carol Descoteaux); "Living a Moral Life" (Father Ed Malloy); and "Their Relationship with the Church" (Father Michael Rosswurm ). 
The sessions will last about 90 minutes with some large and small group discussion and a period of in­formation input from the leader based on a series of questions al­ready submitted by those signed up to take part. 
A number of persons from each hall wel'e-invited by rectors to take part in this "pilot" program. In future semesters. Campus Ministry will continue to sponsor and expand the program, based on the ex­perience of these first six sessions, Schlaver said. 
the United States several times during his two years as a fugitive and tried to arrange the slayings of U.S. and Colombian law enforcement agents after his arrest. 
Nelson said in Los Angeles the probe was triggered in I982 by in­formation from a wiretap in an unr­elated case. 
Jensen said the probe was begun by the Drug Enforcement Ad­ministration and the FBI but was turned over to the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. 
U.S. Attorney George Proctor in Little Ibck said the indictment there was the sixth and last, in a series of Arkansas indictments flowing from the probe. He said in earlier cases, 15 defendants art: serving 74 years in prison and have been fined 

S128,000. 
The Miami indictment accused 
Rosenthal and three others of 
conspiring to free Rosenthal from a 
federal prison in Miami where he 
was taken after his recapture in 
Colombia last fall. 
The indictment issued Nov. I4 in Little Rock charged two of the defendants in the Atlanta case along with I I others, with conspiring to import heroin and marijuana.

Student Senate chooses committee to study proposed alcohol policies 
By CAROL CAMP 
Senior StaffReporter 
Student Body President Brian Cal­laghan announced the formation ofa committee responsible for devising a Student Senate alcohol policy at a Senate meeting last night. 
The Senate committee, which will meet Sunday evening, hopes to create a policy representing a con­
census  of  opinions  voiced  in  
meetings with  various dorms,  the  
Hall  Presidents  Council,  and  ad­ 

ministrators. rectors. and students. 
By creating the committee. Cal­laghan emphasized "the need to let students know what the committee (on Alcohol Awareness) is think­ing." In addition, he stated the im­portance of publicizing committee's findings so students can understand the effects which any changes in the University's present policy will have upon them. 
In other business, Senators Rob Bertino and Dave McAvoy an­nounced the acquisition of forty ad­ditional parking spaces in the D-6 parking lot. Seniors living in Morris­sey, Pangborn, Howard. and Fisher halls will have the opportunity to gain a space hy participating in a lot­tery which will be publicized through the collaborative efforts of Student Government and The Ob­server. 
Senators also passed a resolution calling for renovation of classrooms in the Administration Building, Hur­ley Business Administration Build­ing, and Cushing Hall. The proposal was approved in response to Ex­ecutive Coordinator John Gallag­
her's report which cited the need for such renovation. Student Government will donate one hundred dollars to the Financial

Sometimes censored press tells better story 
I came home the other night to watch the nightly news. I saw Secretary of State George ~hultz condemn the grounding of a U.S. helicopter in Honduras and the killing of the pilot hy saying, "It is unacceptable to fire from 
The Cohen column 
one country to another country and end up killing some pt·opk." Larry Speakes at the Whitt· llou:-.e calkd the anion "reckless and unprovoked." Then. Dankl Ortega, the Nicaraguan <.·hid of statt', chara<.·terized tht· !light a:-. anything hut "innocent." I hdieved tht· Nicaraguan. 
Shultz, who will apparently say anything to prove he is not an academic sissy, is fast bah­hling away his credibility. When it comes to shooting from one <.·ountry to the next, the llnited States has heen doing that for quite a while. llnlc:ss you are tht· only person in the world who hc:licves that tht· anti-Sandinista Contras in Honduras are not receiving both CIA money and advice in their war against Nicaragua, then what Shultz said should strike you as preposterous. 

Daily, the Contras launch strikes from Hon­duras into J'l;icaragua. The G.mtras have hlown up oil depots within Nicaragua and have even managt·d to bomb the airport and Managua. They are, in effect, conducting a guerrilla war against the S.mdinista regime -a war launched at the hehest of the United States and financed by it. just to complicatt· fl1atters, witnesses reported that the downed helicop­ter not only strayed over Nicarauan territory, but its American markings were obscured by mud. The Nicaraguans may not have known they were shootingat an American helicopter. 
The issue at the moment is not the ad­visahility of this dirty little war, which is both acknowledged and unacknowledged by our own government -its tendency to talk to us the way the Soviet leaders talk to their own people:. In the persons of both Shultz and Speakes, for instance, you have two important govt·rnment officials telling you something that you know is either not true or downright 
absurd. 
For Shultz, though, this is parfor the course. lie was the first to pop onto the tube after the downing ofthe Korean airliner-and the first to say things that turned out not to be true. He 
characterized the downing as something akin to premeditated murder and left us all with a picture of a homicidal Soviet government ­one that knew it was dealing with a civilian 
lin er and one that ordered the trigger pulled from Moscow. 
It turned out later that this was not quite the case. It turned out that there had been a U.S. spy plane in the vicinity, that the Soviets might have confused the two planes, that the Soviet pilot might not have recognized the Korean plane as a civilian aircraft (Shultz said he did) and that the order to shoot probably was not given in Moscow, but at regional headquar­ters. just recently, for instance, the Soviet armed forces published a critique ofthe way it handled the Korean airliner incident, indicat­ing not the homicidal intent that Shultz al­leged, hut something different -a mistake. 
Similarly on Grenada, the administration was quick to issue statements that turned out not to be true. These statements concerned the jeopardy American medical students were in, the number ofCubans on the island and the sorts of Cubans they were -construction workers or soldiers. 
In contrast, from yet another island, fidel Castro of all people was issuing statements that conformed to the facts. It was he who an­nounced the corre<:r number of Cubans. It was he who gave their right occupations. It was he who provided a more accurate ac­count of events leading up to the American invasion. 
Mistakes are inevitable, especially in con­fusing circumstances. Shultz and the ad­ministration can be excused for some statements simply because all the facts were not in. But even taking that into account, you still have to conclude that they are not above winging it on the facts or striking a ludicrous posture. 
In discussing the helicopter incident on television the other night, the Marxist leader of an authoritarian state came off better than two officials ofour own democracy. He usc:d a clever media device. He made sense. ·

ALL 'IQU Nl~D TO DEAL WITH r~t NEW PUON~ SYSTEM 
Sitting in an otlicc in Downtown Dallas, sur­rounded hy lawyt·r:-., hankers and other professionals, I came to the unlikely realiza­tion that my timt· at N.Hrt· Damt· was drawing to a dost· and that sooli I would ht· moving on. l'lushcd hy a wavt· of panic and anxiety, it sud-
Robert Lloyd Snyder Then midweek 

dcnly struck me -I am a "St·nmd-st·mcstt·r Senior." 
Whcrt· lin we go fr<1m here? 

lley, Notre Dame didn't prcpart· nll' to dt·al with this, ht·y, wait' 
Many of my frknds art· now looking at tht· future with um:ertain and cautiously expt·c­tanc t·yes; a lot of thl·m havt· no idea whcrt· tht·y will he in a year. 
Wt· takt· solace in knowing that most other Notre Damt· graduates have eventually settled into comfortahlt· positions in sodety. Notre Damt· is suppost·d to make most of us "successful" after all. That is why we have heen shelling out our seven grand t·very August. 
But none of us -whether we are going on to law. medical or graduate school, entering the seminary, taking a job with a Big Eight accounting firm, or getting married -real~y know what the future holds for us. 
This uncertainty and apprehension over future events makes us retreat into noscalgia and thoughts of past, and seemingly better, timt·s. \X'e seek solace in the wonderful and outrageous events ofour youch to comhat the difficulties ofeveryday life. 
Nostalgia often romanticizes and idealizes past times, and each of us will slowly become aware of this trend as life "back at Notre Dame" looks better and better with each pas­sing year. 
I will look hack at Notre Dame with a par­ticular fondness I would have thought inconcciveahlc as a freshman. In the past few years I formed friendships which will last the rest of my life. The best people I have ever known I met here. 
I regret many things. I regret not having become closer to some persons I may have alienated. I still kick myself for mishandling some relationships. I regret not having become more involved in social and extracur­ricular activities earlier than I did, because these arc the intangibles which have made the differt·nce for me at Notre Dame. 

I will regret abandoning my endowed chairs at Lee's and Nickie's, and will relinquish "my" booth at Albert's with similar dismay. I regret not having scheduled more overloaded semesters than I have, and am sorry that there arc some professors I never experienced from whom I could have learned a great deal. 
But I have enjoyed seeing myselfgrow, and have enjoyed seeing similar changes in my friends. That is what I will rememhcr first and foremost when I recall my days at Notre Dame. That is what I will tell my friends and children about Notre Dame, and that is what I will carry with me for the rest of my life. 
In this respect, I welcome the change 
which will soon come for all seniors, and I, for 
one, am ready to leave. These changes, while 
often tumultuous and havoc-causing, are the 
critical stages ofour lives from which we can 
profit and grow if we can harness the oppor­
tunities open to us. 

Many of the soon-to-be graduates will reap­pear with alarming frequency on campus next year, waxing longingly about the "good old days" and complaining about life down at Ar­thur Andersen. 
I don't feel that I'll need to return to campus to relive this time of freedom and carefree academia. I hope I will only have ~pick up the phone. 
And so, I trust I will not he returning to Notre Dame, South Bend, its winters and bars, or its rivers and monuments for a long, long time. 
Life goes on. I hope.

TheAP poll is out 
ByDAVE KAPLAN 
AssociatedPress 
Like the previous week, No. 1­ranked North Carolina collected every first-place vote in the weekly Associated Press basketball poll. But this also was a week offallout, as five "new" teams entered the Top 20 thanks to several surprises in con­ference play. 
A nationwide panel of 60 sports 

writers and broadcaster retained the 
Tar Heels and DePaul, both 14-0, 
and Kentucky as the nation's 1-2-3 
teams. 
In beating Atlantic Coast Con­

ference rivals Duke and Virginia , the 
Tar Heels received a perfect I ,260 
points. DePaul collected 1,130 
points and Kentucky, which lost to 
florida but beat seventh-ranked 
Houston, amassed 1,053. 
The points system is based on 20 points for each first place vote, 19 for second, etc. 
Five familiar names re-emerged in this week's poll as Oregon State, St. John's, Boston College, Fresno State and Purdue all dropped out. 
After a rocky start this season, 

Louisville has begun to pick up 
steam and emerges at No. 14. On 
Sunday, the Cardinals, now 11-4, 
streaked by OCLA, which in turn 
dropped six notches to No. 15. 
Also re-entering is Arkansas, 

which comes in behind the Bruins at 
No. 16. The other newcomers are 
Georgia, Virginia and Syracuse, 
placing at Nos. 18, 19, 20, 
respectively. 
For the Orangemen, who slipped 

by Boston College in Big East play on 
a last second desperation shot 75­
73, it's the first time they've been 
ranked this season. 
Back in the Top 10, Georgetown, Maryland and Nevada-Las Vegas all advanced two places to rank at Nos.

Victorious weekend 
Irish fencers keep rambling on 
By MIKE CHMIEl 
Spurts W•·itt•r 
The Notre Dame fencing teams 

rambled through tough men's and 
womt•n's l'Ompetition from the Big 
Ten and the Midwest in Evanston 
this weekend. The men wert· 4-0, 
and the women finished 3-l in 
matches which proved Notre 
D;llllt''s depth andd ability. 
The men's squad. which is begin­

ning to "gell" according to Head 
Coach Mike IkCicco, soundly 
dd(:atcd all four of thcir opponents. 
Tht· scores were 26-l over Chicago, 
25-2 ovt·r Michigan, 23-4 over 
Northwcstcrn, and 21-6 over Min­
nt:sota. 
In tht· sabre, the Irish were at their bt:st with efforts led by a 7-0 perfor­mance from junior captain Mike Janis. Sophomores John Edwards, 7­0, and Tony Concsoli, 8-0, als(J 
looked good. 
"The dt·pth we have in sabre is rt·ally paying off," said DcCicco. "We fenced without Don Johnson, and John Edwards fcnccd at less than 
I00 percent with a spraincd ankle. Yet, the squad really responded." 
Also responding well has bcen the 

Irish foil squad paced by freshman 
Charles Higgs-Coulthard who has 
posted 15 straight wins ( l 7 -I on the 
season). 
"Higgs-Coulthard has really 

surprised me," DeCicco said. "He's 
gaining the valuable hout ex­
perience that our lineup will need in 
March."

Impressive for the foilers has been sophomore Mike Vander Vdden. He was underfeated over the weekend, and he stands with a 1.3-l season record. 
The young epee squad has come around surprising many people. To date, they boast two undefeated fen­cers in captain Andy Quaroni, 13-0, and freshman John Haugh, 8-0. 
The Notre Dame women fencers have also been impressive of late as they downed Illinois, 7-2; Min­nesota, l 0-6; and Northwestern, 9-7. The only match they lost was an ex­tn:mdy dose one to Wisconsin, 66­52, which was decided on total touches. 
Top kncers among the ladies 
were freshman Pia Albcrtson, l 0-l ( 14-l on the season) and senior co­t'aptain Mary Shilts, 9-5 ( 2-2 ). 
"I thought the women fenced ex­
ceptionally well in Evanston," 
explained DeCicco. "Pia Albertson 

has been fencing up a storm. We 
need Mary Shilts to pick up some 
slack. 
"Our priority is to qualifY for the 
nationals. I think that we can 
surprise some people." 

The Irish will look to immprove their records as thcy travel to Columbus, Ohio on Saturday where: they will face Bowling Green, Miami (Ohio), Nmth Carolina, and North Carolina State.

diver. "His loss will hurt," said Flynn, "but Rich looks better at every meet. I think wc can adjust and I'm op­timistic about the: rcst of the season." 
To keep in shape over the Christmas break, the team travelled to San Juan. Puerto Rico for training. According to Stark, the trip provided a means for getting in shape and. good training. "Hopefully it will help in the long run and helped solidifY the team," said Stark. 
Flynn explained the trip hdpt·d to create a favorable outlook among team members and gave the tcam the opportunoity to scout some of the other teams who were also in training. "The training was intense, but it really brought the team to­gether," he said.

Notre Dame devours Rice in an unimpressive victory 
By THERON ROBERTS 
Sports Writer 

The Irish men's basketball team 
looked to be uninspired as it used an 
offensive spurt to begin the game, 
and then coasted to a 50-35 win over 
the Rice Owls. 

The Notre Dame offense was 
functioning much like the game 
clock -sometimes on and other 
times off. 

The highlight of the game may 
well have occurred at the 9:13 mark 
in the first half, when the game clock 
malfunctioned and took nearly five 
minutes to fix. 

After hitting their first five shots of 
the game, the Irish went cold ­

converting on only 4-16 from the 
field for the rest of the half. 

Rice hung tough throughout the 
first half, pulling within one point at · 19-18 with 6:04 left in the first stanza The Owls then committed three turnovers, fuiling to grab the lead each time they had an oppor­
tunity. 

The Irish, meanwhile, managed to tally only eight points in the last 12 minutes before intermission. 
Rice slowed down the tempo of the game beginning in the second half, but the deliberate tactics did not work for the Owls. Notre Dame 

Track must clear new hurdles 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
SJH>rts l:'dilor 

When Notre Dame track coach Joe Piane looked ahead lO the 1984 indoor track sea<;<>n, he saw no bar­riers to the best Notre Dame track season ever. 
However, he received some bad news during the semester hrt·ak. five key performers had failed to clear a major hurdle -their grades -and were placed on academic probation for the sea<;<>n. 
Still, the outlook for this team is not all that bad. Most of last year's squad whic:h won the Midwestern City Conference title returns and an impres:;ivc group ofnewcomers also will provide some punch. If Piane's strong group of middle-distance runners can perform up to cxpecta­
'tions, the 1984 track team sh6uld 
show a good deal of improvement 
over lao;t year's squad. 

"The thing that's unfortunate is that we would have had the best team in Notre Dame history if we hadn't lost thoS<.· guys to grades," says Pianc who is now in his ninth year a-; the Irish coach. "The other guys arc going to have to pick up the slack." 
The people that are going to be counted on to pick up most of the slack arc the middle-distance and distance runners. Always the 
strength of the team,  the  middle­ 
distance  races  seem  to  be  the  
foundation  on  which  the  team  is  

being built. During the last few yt·ars, Pianc ha-; recruited a number of outstanding high school middle­distance runners_ 
Senior Jim Moyar and juniorsJim l'yler and Tim Cannon will be three >f the runners to watch a-; they at­tempt to become the second Notre Dame miler to break four minutes .<huck Aragon did it in 1981 ). Moyar, who wao; injured most oflao;t 
offhis season with a victory in a dual 
meet with Iowa this pao;t weekend. 

Tyler gives the Irish an excellent 
one-two punch in the 1000. Last 
year, he had an outstanding year, 
qualifying for the NCAA's in the 
I(){)() by tying the school record of 
2:09. His 4:02 time in an outdoors 1600-meter race also makes him a major threat in the mile. He finished third in the Iowa meet, but is ex­pected to improve his time ( 2:15.4) considerably as the season progresses. 
Cannon paced a Notre Dame 
sweep of the mile in Iowa He 
finished ahead ofseniors EdJuba and 
co-captain Andy Dillon, two of a 
large pack ofrunners who add depth 
and versatility to the middle­
distance squad. 

Sophomore John McNelis and freshman Jeff Van Wie, the nation's top-ranked high school 800-meter runner, are the runners on whom Piane is counting to place in the 800. They finished second and third, respectively, in Iowa, but were far off their personal records. Meanwhile, junior Dan Shannon is the main Irish threat at 600 yards. 
As far as the distance races are concerned, Pianc is counting on a group of seniors to build up team points. Ralph Caron, Dillon, Juba, and Mark Wozniak are e~pected to place highly, while freshman cross­country star Mike Collins is also ex­pected to help out. 
Notre Dame's depth at these distances will be very important for the team score, because the Irish are not as deep in the sprints and field events. If they can build up enough points in their strong events, the Irish should be able to overcome their other weaknesses. 
It is difficult to call the sprint and field squads "weak" hut the academic losses took their toll. Piane must now rely a great deal on football players to score in the Dziabis. Pearcy led the Irish last year in the 200 outdoors and the 300 in­doors. 
He will get help from junior Mitch 
Van Eyken and fellow football 
players Allen Pinkett and J\lvin Mil­
ler. Juniors Phil Gilmore and Shan­
non should also perform well. 

Meanwhile, Miller will also be counted on to do well in the hurdles. Ifthe Iowa meet is any indication, he should have no problem pulling double-duty. He was barely nudged out of first in the 60-yard da'ih and ,. finished just behind Iowa's Ronnie McCoy, a highly-rated hurdler, in 
the 60-yard hurdles. 

Junior jumper James Patterson 
will be the key for the Irish in the 
field events. Patterson was the 
leading long jumper and triple jum­
per on the team last year, placing 
third in the long jump in the pres­
tigious IC4A championships. This 
year, he will also perform as the high 
jumper. In the Iowa meet, he placed 
third in the high jump at 6-6, set a 
personal record of48-1 in the triple 
jump, and set a school record of24-8 
in the long jump. 

Obviously, Patterson is an ex­
tremely talented athlete, but he will 
also need some help from some 
other people. Senior John Langdon 
and freshman Pat Hirl will serve as 
the pole vaulters, while freshman Joel Autry and senior Greg Bell will help out on the horizontal jumps. Freshman Chuck Lanza rounds out the squad as a shot putter. 
"With the loss of some guys to 
grades, I expect that the guys who 
are still around will be more ag­
gressive," says Piane. "That may 
mean that they will have to double, 
even triple, in meets." 

Notre Dame did not win in Iowa 
as it fell to the Hawkeyes, 68-63. 
However, there is a lot of racing to 
come and many of the individual 
performances should improve 
markedly. 

scored the first seven points of the second half, although it could manage only three for fifteen shoot­ing during that stretch. 
Tom Sluby continued to play well 

for Coach Digger Phelps, by starting 
an Irish rally with 6:48 left in the game. Sluby canned his first of five baskets in the next five Irish posses­sions 
"That time down the floor we had 

to score," Sluby said. "We were 
looking to get the ball inside, but as 
soon as I got the ball, I decided that I 
was going to take the shot." 
Sluby's field goal barrage left the 

score at 44-31, and the Owls could 
get no closer than I 1 points the rest 
ofthe way. 
Sluby led all scorers with L. 1 

points. 
One element of the Notre Dame offense that was noti<:eably absent was the scoring contribution from players off the bench. 
Joe Howard made two free throws with 41 seconds remaining to regis­ter the only points by a non-starter. 
The Irish reserves shot an un­
characteristic 0-12 from the field. 
Tim Kempton added I I points for 
the Irish, while Ken Barlow and Jim 

Dolan chipped in eight and six 
points, respectively. 

Tony Barnett was high-point man 
for the Owls with 12. 

The 3"; points scores by Rice was 
the lowest total scored by a team at 
the ACC, breaking Lafayette's mark 
of39 set just last week. 

Phelps was unimpressed with his 
team's performance. 
"I thoght we jumped out well, but then we went flat," Phelps said. "We missed some easy shots and had too many turnovers." 

This Irish team was different from the one that rolled over Villanova. 
"Wt" never got into our transition game," explained Sluby. "That's where we get the best shots -when we get the ball moving around." 
Notre Dame is back in action tomorrow night. playing host to the Wildcats of Davidson College. 

The new year is good to the Irish swimmers 
By MARY SIEGER 
Sports Writer 
If Friday's victory is any indication for the rest of the sea'i<m, Big Brother shouldn't give the Notre Dame men's swim team too much trouble this year. In its first dual meet of the new year, the Irish defeated a tough squad from Ferris State College 58-55 Friday afternoon in the Rockne Memorial Pool. 
Although the meet was not decided until the closing races, the Irish clinched both first and second place in three important events. 
Junior Tim Bohdan and freshman Steve Coffey claimed the top two spots in the I ,000 yard freestyle race, while senior co-captains Dan Flynn and Brian Casey won first and 
second place in the 200 yard butterf­ly rac:c:. 
Later in the meet, junior Paullknz and sophomore John Coffey t·arned Hrst and second pla(_'t' spots in the 200 yard backstroke event. "It was an exciting meet ;md those swet:ps really helped us," said Notre Dame head coach, Dennis Stark. 

While the team performed wdl in most races on friday, a large gap has been left by the absence of junior Mike Kennedy. Kennedy, the top diver for the Irish, will not return to the Universtiy this semester so he can take care ofhis mother who is ill. 
In Kennedy's absence, junior Rich Yohon will become the team's only
