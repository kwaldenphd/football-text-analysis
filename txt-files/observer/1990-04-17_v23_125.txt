Matheney trial 
necessitates 
death penalty 
The man sat there in the chair, his bald --------­
head dotted with electrodes and his hands and feet strapped to the chair. He had just talked to a priest and had a de­licious meal. Sud­
denly, as the wit-John O'Brien 
nesses looked on, a man behind a wall Managing Editor through a switch. The man in the chair writhed and squirmed as the electricity shot through his body. As the flow continued, his eyes rolled back in his head and he lost control of his excretory functions. Soon he was dead. No this was not a scene from some horror movie. The above scene is acted out every time someone is executed in the electric chair. At every execution, protesters are a common sight. They come with signs that read "We have no right to play God," "The death penalty is cruel and unusual punish­ment," or simply, "Don't support legal mur­der." However, there are also protesters from the other side. When mass murderer Ted Bundy was executed, people chanted "Burn Bundy Burn" and sang a new version of "On Top of Old Smokey," substituting the name of Florida's electric chair. The latter group shows what is wrong with the death penalty. To some twisted people, it has become like a circus. This mentality surfaced in the recent Texas Democratic gubernatorial primary. In a now infamous campaign spot, former Gov. Mark White struts through a panorama of faces bragging of the fact that 32 criminals were executed under his tenure. Luckily, White didn't make it to the primary. White was proud of his record. That scares me. The last thing he should have been is proud. It was bad enough that crime was rampant enough to warrant 32 executions, but it was worse that he was proud of the fact that he took the lives of 32 people. Taking the life of a human being should not be a source of pride for White. It's nothing to be proud of but, unfortu­nately, it is necessary in our society. Every day this paper and others like it across the nation run stories of people who are bru­tally murdered, tortured and raped by criminals, many of whom are repeat offend­ers. In a highly publicized local case, Alan Ma­theney has been convicted of murdering his ex-wife, Lisa Bianco, while out on furlough. He had threatened her before, but this time he followed through, clubbing her with the butt of a shotgun as her children watched. In the Matheney case, the jury has rec­ommended that the judge sentence Matheney to death. Does Matheney deserve to die? He has proven to be beyond reform, and prison obviously doesn't scare him Alan Matheney should be sentenced to death. I am not proud of the fact that he should be executed, for I believe in the sanctity of human life. But that includes Lisa Bianco's life. too.

I teach many of my classes on the workshop or seminar model, and I insist on discussion even in classes of 50."

George Powell, president of the Bergen County chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, touched on a theme heard throughout the two-hour service, saying parents in the minority community must listen to children who complain of ra­cial harassment. 
"We apologize to our children for letting them down and not lending an attentive ear in a critical time of need," Powell said. 
Herbert Daughtry, the Pannell family's pastor, read the names of about 10 blacks killed recently in altercations with police in the New York metropolitan area. Despite the riot in Teaneck the day after Pannell's death, the black community has been compla­cent in responding to violence from police, he said. 
"I just wonder what would happen if a black officer killed a 15-year-old Irish, Italian or Jewish kid," said Daughtry.

Lithuania asks for Soviet meeting 
MOSCOW (AP) -Lithuania on Monday asked Mikhail Gor­bachev to meet immediately with the secessionist republic's president to provide details of Moscow's threatened economic sanctions so that Lithuanians can be prepared. 
It would be Gorbachev's first meeting with Lithuanian Presi­dent Vytautas Landsbergis, who was elected after the Baltic republic declared independence from the Soviet Union on March 11. 
Some Soviet publications suggested Gorbachev, with newly expanded presidential pawers, will refuse to discuss the standoff as long as Lands­bergis is leading the breakaway republic. 
Landsbergis told a news con­ference Monday night that if the Soviet Union closes Lithua­nian borders to prevent ship­ments from foreign countries, "We will consider it a form of aggression." 
In a telegram to Gorbachev, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimieras Prunskiene said Lithuania wants to explain to its people what difficulties they may face if they continue ignor­ing an ultimatum Gorbachev is­sued Friday. 
Gorbachev gave Lithuania 48 hours to rescind laws aimed at bolstering its drive for inde­pendence or face a cutoff of products the Kremlin supplies. He did not spell out the items, but Lithuania depends on the Kremlin for oil, gas, machinery, raw materials, chemicals and automobiles. . 
The deadline expired Sunday night with no visible cut in de­liveries, but also no yielding by Lithuania. 
Prunskiene's telegram said such broad action would dam­age both the Soviet and Lithua­nian economy. She suggested the best way to clarify the threat would be at an immedi­ate meeting in Moscow with a Lithuanian delegation headed by Landsbergis. 
If measures are not defined, Prunskiene said in an interview on Soviet television Monday night, "this is a cold and very hard war, a war with the people of Lithuania, which includes people who consider themselves citizens of the Soviet Union." 
Her remark implied that Gor­bachev's sanctions would boomerang, hurting loyal Sovi­ets in Lithuania he claims to be protecting. If fuel is cut off, many Russian factory workers would lose their jobs and plants in the Soviet Union would stop getting parts manufactured in Lithuania. 
The evening newscast Vremya ran the Prunskiene interview in an unusually straightforward broadcast. Much Soviet news coverage of the Lithuanian cri­sis has been slanted, despite Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness. 


Vilnius Radio quoted Prun­skiene as saying the leadership of Lithuania's legislature de­cided that "until we see definite physical measures against Lithuania's industry and econ­omy, all contractual obligations to the U.S.S.R. must continue to be carried out by all our enter­prises, so there should be no pretext for possible disruption of supplies by the Soviet Union." 
The telegram was sent to Gorbachev after an emergency meeting Monday of the Presid­ium, or legislative leadership.

U.S., Brazil differ in justice systems 
By PAUL PEARSON 
Assistant News Editor 
The criminal justice systems in Brazil and in the United States are greatly different, ac­cording to Robert Kant De Lima. 
De Lima, a visiting professor from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said, "In order to enhance our understanding of society and culture, empha­sizing differences is more im­portant than noting similari­ties." 
De Lima, a native of Brazil, spent 10 years researching criminal justice in both Brazil 
Father Charles Sheedy 

A specialist in moral theology and Christian ethics, Sheedy oc­casionally took controversial stands on many contemporary social issues. In 1957, long be­fore the morality of nuclear arms had become a concern of the mainstream Church, he had condemned the use of nuclear weaponry even for defensive purposes. 
In 1964, testifying before a legislative committee of the Commonwealth of Mass., he advocated the abolition of capi­tal punishment. Following the Supreme Court decision in 1973 to legalize abortion, Sheedy correctly predicted that the is­sue of "meaningful" human­hood would soon carry over into areas such as retardation, euthanasia and suicide. 
A major postwar figure at the University, Sheedy was dean of 
and in Birmingham, Ala. 
In his April 12 lecture, "Criminal Justice: A Compara­tive Approach, Brazil and the United States," De Lima said that, in the United States, "negotiation is the ideal resolu­tion of conflict." This would explain the practices of judicial pre-bargaining and police bar­gaining. It also explains the American style of reaching a verdict, which De Lima called "a negotiated public decision." 
According to De Lima, this notion comes from the idea that "A good deal will serve justice better than a fair trial." 
In contrast to the American justice system, which is based traditional idea "that society is already in order. Any conl1ict is going to hurt society." 
This idea is manifested in the fact that police records may be introduced in trials. De Lima said that these records "may legitimately influence a judge." 
It is also manifested in the fact that members of the seven­member jury are not allowed to talk with each other. "Even when giving the verdict, they cannot discuss [the easel with each other. In fact, if it can be proved that they discussed it with each other, the trial can be nullified." De Lima said. 
the College of Arts and Letters from 1952 to 1968 and was twice appointed chairman of the department of theology. 
In 1968, an anonymous .~lumnus established a fund in the College of Arts and Letters for the Charles Sheedy Award for Excellence in Teaching, de­scribing an excellent teacher as one "who can teach students what is truly important and en­during, and why this is so." 
From 1968-1971 Sheedy served as the dean of theologi­cal studies and institutes and then was in residence as a re­
search scholar at Notre Dame's Ecumenical Institute in Tantur, Jerusalem. lie returned to campus in 1972 and joined the staff of Moreau Seminary where he taught moral theology in the master of divinity pro­gram. 
He retired from teaching in 
,
1979 and went to serve on the staff of Holy Cross Novitiate in 
"" 
Cascade, Colo. In 1982 he moved to Holy Cross Center, Berkeley, Calif., where he also served as a staff member. In 1985 he returned to Corby Hall on the Notre Dame campus and in 1989 retired to Holy Cross House, where he was in resi­dence at the time of his death.

Medellin Cartel questions leader's terrorist activities 
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) ­The Medellin drug cartel rejects its longtime leader, Pablo Escobar, because of his indis­criminate terrorism, according to a statement claiming to be from cartel members. 
The newspaper El Tiempo on Monday doubted the the state­ment's authenticity. It said the format and lettering were dif­ferent from previous docu­ments sent by the traffickers to local media. 
Defense Minister Oscar Botero said Monday he did not know if the statement was au­thentic, but that a split in the cartel does exist over tactics in a battle against the govern­ment. 
"There are many drug traf­fickers," Botero said in a TV interview broadcast by the Cinevision news program, adding that some members of the Medellin Cartel were op­posed to terrorist violence. 
The statement was issued Sunday night and declared: 
"We the Extraditables do not agree with the terrorist acts that Pablo Escobar is ordering in an indiscriminate and per­sonal way. Previously we asked Pablo Escobar to stop detonat­ing bombs and executing inno­cent people because such acts did not help our cause. 
"From now on, we declare ourselves in total disagreement with the terrorist acts ordered personally by Pablo Escobar. We reject the violent way (Escobar) is forcing us to carry on his personal war by kidnap­ping, torturing and threatening our families." 
Authorities have blamed the 
Medellin Cartel for a campaign of bombings and other terrorist violence that killed 238 people in the last eight months. 
The attacks were in retalia­tion for a government crack­down in which 15 drug suspects were extradited and hundreds of traffickers properties seized. 
Last month the cartel ended a unilateral truce declared in Jan. It said the renewed violence was in reply to continued gov­ernment pressure on them. 
In two weeks, terrorists killed 28 police officers in Medellin. On April 5, police defused a 1,650-pound dynamite truck bomb on a main avenue in Bo­gota during morning rush hour. Authorities say the bomb could have killed thousands. 
Authorities blamed the Medellin cartel for all the at­tacks. The statement makes it appear that Escobar may have acted alone.

NEW DELHI, India (AP) -A leaking gas cylinder explodnd in a moving commuter train on Monday and snt off a lirn that lnft at least SO people d11ad and (,5 othms woundnd, news re­ports and oflieials said. 
Heporters at the scene said the explosion and lire killed at least 100 people. 
Fire swept through two of the train's 16 ears as it traveled near Kurnrahar in Bihar state, 500 mil11s southeast of New lklhi. Tlw fire began at 9:30 a.m.

Firelighters evnntuaIIy extm­guished the blaze, but "The hnat was so intensn no one dared to entnr the train for at lnast a half-hour after the lire," said S.K. Sharma, the top eivil administrator in the re­gion. Sharma said a cylinder of oxyaeetylene gas, used in weld­ing, was found in one of the guttnd ears. "The outer shell of the bogies (ears) was intact, but the inside was terrible," Sharma said in a tnlephone intnrview.

Ham Naresh Singh, a sur­vivor, was quoted by Press Trust of India as saying that because "I would not be able to save anyone and would get killed myself, I jumped off the train." 
The United News of India quoted local officials as saying at least 80 people died and 65 were wounded.

Press Trust of India said many bodies were buried under smoldering wooden berths and heaps of luggage. 
Bihar is one of the poorest of India's 25 states. 
The train, which was travel­ing from Mokammeh to Arrah, is widely used by morning commuters to Patna, the state capital.

cab killings frighten N.Y. drivers 
NEW YOHK (AP) -The 

killings of five cab drivers in 
the Bronx, including three who 
may have been victims of the 
same robber, have terrorized 
hundreds of drivers who are 
sacrificing profits for daytime 
driving. 
At the Seaman Car Service, 

employer of the latest victim, 
black flags flew Monday from 
the antennas of cabs, and 
drivers held a memorial pro­
cession. 
At the Flash Car Service Co. 

in the Bronx, only 15 of the 80 
drivers who normally work 
Sunday nights showed up for 
work, said dispatcher Pablo 
Feliciano. 
"Most of them are switching 

to the days," Feliciano said. 
"They're really disturbed about 
what's going on. Everybody's 
shaken up really badly." 
Drivers again vented their outrage later Monday when 400 to 500 cabs descended on a sec­tion of the Bronx and tied up traffic after hearing a false re­port on their radios that an­other driver had been shot, said Officer Fred Weiner. 
With lights on, the cabs parked in the street and blocked traffic from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., said Weiner, a police spokesman. 
"A canvass of the car service companies did not turn up any drivers missing," Weiner said. "They caused a major traffic jam over there." 
The latest killing Saturday and another three days earlier were dismissed by police as un­related to the first three, but the slayings heightened fears in an area where cab drivers haven't felt safe for decades. 
Officer James Terretta, part of a task force of about 30 of­ficers investigating the slayings, said police do not have a suspect in any of the killings but are receiving many tips. 
Mayor David Dinkins has of­fered a $10,000 reward for in­formation leading to the killer or killers. 

SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -A jury's condemnation of a mur­derous ex-husband adds to a growing intolerance of family violence, says the director of a Elkhart women's shelter. 
The jury, sitting in South Bend, convicted the former husband of a shelter counselor, Lisa Bianco, in her 1989 mur­der. The jurors, nine men and three women, then recom­mended execution. 
"I do feel that they sent a message to the people by their verdict, and by their recom­mendation, that they're not go­ing to. tolerate this anymore," said Michalyn Chilcote. 
"No matter what circum­stances you have lived under, you never have the right to go out and bludgeon somebody." 
Bianco's death was a stun­ning blow to the shelter staff and the battered women she had counseled there. She had finally broken free of a some­times attractive but dangerous relationship, successfully pressed assault charges, and set about rebuilding her life. 
She still so feared Alan Math­eney and his eventual release

Verdict condemns domestic violence 
that she planned to move away with her two daughters and change her name. On March 4, though, she had time only to flee her house, and send the children rushing for help, when Matheney broke through the kitchen door brandishing a shotgun. 
He beat her to death with the unloaded weapon outside a neighbor's house. Five hours earlier he had been released, without a promised warning, on a short furlough. 
Her ordeal and the attention the case brought to the women's shelter may have helped others escape before it was too late. 
The eight-bed Elkhart shelter helped more than twice as many women last year and re­ferred even more for help else­where, said Chilcote. ''The pub­licity of the Lisa Bianco case has opened doors so that peo­ple knew these resources were available." 
Callers have asked how to help . friends and co-workers who may have been battered, she said. "Call in, do some­thing, get involved," she said.

Metheney awaits sentencing 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) ­A jury recommended execu­tion Thursday for a convict who murdered his former wife while on prison fur­lough. 
The same jury Wednesday convicted Alan Matheney of murder and burglary in the 1989 slaying of Lisa Bianco. The jurors rejected his de­fense of insanity. 
Matheney, who listened im­passively to the verdict, stood quitely as the judge read the recommendation of death in the electric chair. Lake Superior Court Judge James Letsinger set sentenc­ing for May 4. 
The defendant's mother, Martha Matheney, showed no emotional reaction as she sat in the back row of the courtroom. She left without comment. 
Eugene Bianco, the victim's father and the grandfather of her two daughters, said he was pleased with the jury's work. 
"It's a just sentence (recommendation) for the crime he committed," he said. "I hope it doesn't drag on for years." 
He said the children still have nightmares from their memories of Matheney's breaking into their home, armed with an unloaded shotgun, and threatening their mother. Matheney chased the partially clad Lisa Bianco into the street and beat her outside a neighbor's home. 
"The kids miss their 
mother more, and they wish 
Matheney was no longer 
their father," Eugene Bianco 
said. 
Letsinger extended a gag order on the trial attorneys until the sentencing. St. Joseph County Prosecutor Michael Barnes cited the order and declined comment. 
Defense attorney Scott 
King, however, held a brief 
news conference outside the 
courthouse and said he will 
argue for a prison term. 
"The jury was out quite 
some time, so it was obvi­
ously not a snap decision," 
he said. 
The Lake County jury, 
brought with Letsinger to 
South Bend on a change of 
venue, declined to speak with 
reporters. The jury was dis­
missed, and the jurors re­
turned to Lake County. 
The jury of nine men and three women began delibera­tions around 2 p.m., broke two hours for dinner, and signaled a decision around 8:15p.m.

Doctors claim TV causes violent behavior, childhood obesity; urge viewing restraints 
CIIICAGO (AI') -Long-term tPievision viewing is one cause of violnnt or aggressive behav­ior in children and contributes substantially to childhood obfl­sity, tlw American Academy of Pndiatrics said Monday. 
In its first policy statement on childrnn and tnlnvision since 19H4. tlw 39,000-membnr academy called for morn in­volvement by parents and pndi­atridans in regulating chil­dnm's vinwing, and urged that vinwing time bn cut in half. 
By the time a child today reaches agn 70, he or she will have spent approximately seven years watching television, the pediatricians said. 
"For some children, the world shown on television be­comes tlw real world," the statemnnt said. 
The academy also recom­mendnd: 
lntnnsifying 
p,fforts to teach parnnts and pediatricians about television's innuence, and promoting critical viewing among children. 

Parnnts' 
limiting children's viewing to one to two hours daily and dnvnloping activitifls such as reading, athlP.tics and hobbies. 


Supporting 
legislation mak­ing broadcast of high-quality children's programming a con­dition of license renewal and mandating at least one hour per day of educational chil­dren's programming. 

Supporting 
efforts to ban programs that have toys as main characters. 

Portraying 
sexuality respon­sibly. 

Working 
to eliminate alcohol ads on television and encourag­ing extensive counter advertis­ing. 


A.C. Nielsen Co. data indicate children ages two to five watch TV about 25 hours weekly; six­to 11-year-olds, more than 22 hours weekly; and 1.2-to 17­year-olds, 23 hours per week, said the policy statement. 
"We're asking that parents cut their kids' television viewing in half or more," said Dr. Vic­tor Strasburger of the Univer­sity of New Mexico School of Medicine. He added that the academy did not recommend a time limit five years ago. 
Experts have established a link between heavy television viewing and obesity, he said. The policy statement credits a 1985 study by Drs. W.H. Dietz and S.L. Gortmaker that ap­peared in the .Journal of Pedi­atrics. 
Dietz, a member of the academy committee that pre­pared the policy statement, has done followup research, Stras­burger said. 
"It could be that television watching is such a sedentary activity," he said in a telephone interview Monday. "It could be because the nutritional mes­sages on television are so terri­ble. Or it could be that kids usually ... eat while they're watching television .... It prob­ably is all three." 
He said TV still offers "a steady diet of violence," causing some children to believe "that if you're the good guy, violence can be acceptable" to solve some problems. 
The policy statement also calls for contraceptive advertis­ing and for responsible por­trayals of sex. 
Strasburger said "no na­tional networks have been brave enough ... or public-spir­ited enough" to advertise con­traceptives.

Problems forming a new coalition

Saudi Arabia frees 7000 prisoners 
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) 
-The government said Monday 
it had freed nearly 7,700 
inmates, including all political 
prisoners, as a goodwill ges­
ture marking the holy month of 
Ramadan. 

There is "not a single political prisoner" in the kingdom, according to an Interior Min­istry announcement broadcast by state-run Hiyadh radio, be­cause King Fahd had deelan~d amnesty for 7,681 prisoners. 
The gesture was made possi­ble by benefactors who donated about $87 million to help pay the public and private debts of some prisoners, the ministry said. 
In a report on Saudi Arabia issued in .January, the London­based human rights group Amnesty International said more than 700 people were de­tained without trial from 1983 to 1989, mainly Shiite Moslems, including Iranian-backed fun­damentalists. 
The report said at least 100 people were seized last year and named 66 held in three prisons. 
Saudi Arabia denied the re­port. Monday's announcement did not specifically refer to the Shiites. 
Those still jailed were being held for capital crimes or were convicted and awaiting sentHnc­ing. 
Capital crimes under Islamic law include murdnr, punishable by bnheading; adultery, punish­able by stoning; and thievery, punishable by cutting of hands from the wrist. In recent years, beheading was also decreed by Moslem theologians for drug smuggling. 
The amnesty included Saudis and foreigners, but no break­down was released. It referred to an unspecified number of foreigners detained for various misdemeanors, financial crimes and public law violations. It said their embassies were asked to prepa're for their de­portation, as is customary. 
Neighboring Gulf countries have already announced their amnesties for Ramadan, but they have not exceeded 200 prisoners.

Merchants strike in protest over Chinatown freeway 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -De­spite a merchants' strike that shut down the city's famed Chi­natown, the Board of Supervi­sors voted Monday to tear down a quake-damaged free­way the merchants consider a vital link to their community. 
Almost 1,200 shops, restau­rants and professional offices -all but five small businesses -signed up to take part in the three-hour shutdown, said protest organizer Rose Pak of the Chinese Chamber of Com­merce. 
Many of the business people attended the meeting at which the supervisors considered a proposal by Mayor Art Agnos to consider replacing the ele­vated Embarcadero Freeway with either a surface or under­ground road. 
The board voted 6-5 to accept Agnos' proposal. The state De­partment of Transportation previously agreed to abide by the supervisors' vote on the state-owned freeway. 
Supervisor Angela Alioto said the vote means the freeway that runs along the waterfront will have to be torn down, but Pak vowed to continue the fight and hold state officials to a plan to repair the road. 
The strike began at 1:30 p.m. and Chinatown came to a grinding halt. Most stores closed, with shopkeepers taking their goods off the sidewalks. 
The usual shoulder-to-shoul­der pedestrian traffic in the heart of Chinatown went away. The noise of car horns was re­placed by the sound of chimes blowing in the breeze. 
"We just got in to Chinatown and already got kicked out of two shops," said Michael Kiri­azis, a businessman from Port­land, Ore., just as the strike be­gan. 
Hundreds of Chinatown busi­ness people and residents climbed aboard buses that shuttled them to City Hall.

It has stood empty since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook northern California six months ago, killing 68 people, cracking concrete columns supporting the waterfront roadway. 
Agnos recently proposed tearing down the elevated free­way, long considered an eyesore as well as an' easy entrance for drivers into Chinatown and the restaurants of North Beach and tourist attractions at Fish­erman's Wharf. In its place, the mayor suggested building an underground road that he be­lieves would be safer from earthquakes and more aesthet­ically pleasing. 
But Pak and others such as Supervisor Tom Hsieh contend repairing the existing freeway would be better because it would get business traffic back into the economically depressed Chinatown area sooner and cheaper.
Temko argued for a buried freeway, and said San Fran­cisco could once again be the "beau ideal of a civilized Amer­ican metropolis, as it was be­fore the freeway transformed one of the loveliest waterfronts in the world into one of the

Aversion to pro-abortion label reflects ambivalence 
By Kevin Smant 
An old refrain has reared its ugly head again--one that al­ways pops its face out of the swirls of the abortion contro­versy. It is an attempt to wrig­gle out of the moral and ethical questions that abortion poses; since the position it reflects is so untenable, I suppose it's not surprising that its advocates use it. Anyway, the refrain is: "To be pro-choice is not to be pro-abortion." It's time, r think. to give this cliche a little closer scrutiny. 
The issue isn't about abor­tion, say many of the so-called "pro-choiee" advocates. Rather, since the "theological" question of the status of the fetus has not and cannot be decided, lawmakers should not impose "their values" on the female de­cision-maker. Pro-choicers are neither pro-nor anti-abortion, they claim; the only thing they care about is that the proce­dure for making the decision be entirely "individual." 
How ingenious. And yet how fundamentally misleading and morally anarchistic. For the fact is that much of the pro­choice crowd, perhaps a major­ity of them (although one can't be sure, due to the Cuomoistic ''I'm personally opposed but..." position), takes a stand on the issue of the status of the fetus. To them, it is nothing more that a piece of tissue, a lump of protoplasm, a blob of cells. Removing it from a woman's body has all the significance of the excision of a benign tumor. 
This position is reflected in their attitude towards the ac­tual performance of abortions. They resist any restrictions upon it, even the relatively mi­nor proposal of requiring parental consent for abortions administered to women under the age of eighteen. They establish and fund abortion clinics and actively promote abortion as an alternative to pregnancy. They publicly ex­press no sorrow at the fact the number of abortions performed yeatly now extends into the 
millions. 
One must ask, then, why such advocates run from the term of being "pro-abortion." The fetus is not human, they say; remov­ing it has all the moral portents of popping a pimple. Many of them (though perhaps not all) aid, abet and encourage its practice. Yet they insist they in­sist that this is not "advocating" abortion. Why? 
It could be that some of the facts of this issue--not the ideo­logical abstractions--prick at the pro-abortion conscience. Medical research shows that, at nine weeks, the fetus has all of the genetic characteristics of a nine-year old child. Medical ad­vances now indicate that it is at least possible for even only a four or five month old prema­turely born fetus to be viable. And is it really logical to con­sider a fetus of any age as be­ing, in essence, a nonentity? 
Normally arguments in poli­tics over semantics, labels and titles only bog us down and ob­scure the real issues. But this time a label assumes real im­portance. Pro-abortionists' re­sistance to the title which best explains the objeetive results of their position reflects their own ambivalence, I think, with that position. Could it be that ''I'm not pro-abortion!" really means "I'm 'pro-choice' but not at all comfortable with abortion?" If so, then these owe it to them­selves to carefully examine why this feeling exists; they must stop shouting and start think­ing. 
Meanwhile, anti-abortion ad­vocates must not worry about the charge of "imposing their values" on others. After all, it was Abraham Lincoln who "imposed his values" on South­ern slave owners.

The university's faeulty will also lw per·mittnd to "rewrite Soviet history," in the form of a new tnxtbook. which will give tlwm a chancP to pwsnnt tlw country's history from a hroadPr perspertiVP. 
"This is a rPally good opportunity to to have morP obj~rtiVP msearrh about our history," said I>olm~nkov. 
The student prPss has been pPrmittml to bP very rritieal of the governnunt. Moscow State Univnrsity's rwwspaper gives studnnts plenty of opportunity to express uncnnsornd thoughts. Tlwy can also purchase newspapers from otlwr countries. USA Today is availabiP on a daily basis. 
The addition of a Wnstnrn perspective to the univnrsity has not only all'erted intellectual life. Students are interested in popular culture from other countries and are familiar with American tilms and music. For tlw 12,000 studPnts residing in Mos~ow State Univmsity's dormitories, them is ample space and opportunity to dance, drink and socialize. The two studPnt bodies arc "the samP. Absolutely," said Dobn~nkov. Above all, Moseow StatP Uniwrsity students arP no longer afraid to lw active. 
"It snmns to nw that it is now more important to have coop~ration between our univNsities," lw emphasized. 
Tlwn~ an~ currently 50 Anurican students at Moscow StatP Uniwrsity, a number Dobn~nkov would like to incrnasn to 400-500, with Notn Dame students among tlw number. 
"It is important for young pnop!P to meet and come to a mutual understanding of each ot.lwr and form cooperative friPndships." h~ noted.

While purchas­ing books is a rarn or.currencn in Moscow, at Notre Damn it is not only usual, but, as Dobrnnkov observed,"very expnnsive." 
Mexico City, the best bet for Mexican experience 
For owr 20 yPars, tlw tourism industry has played an important rolo in tlw Mexican Pconomy. MPxico has sonw of thP most lwautiful bParlws in tlw world. and millions of visi­tors takP advantagP of Mexico's tourist locales nwry ynar. 
Wlwn pnopln think about taking a vacation in Mnxico, thny usually think about lxtapa, Canntn and (obviously) Aca­pulro. Whi!P tlrns«' hnaclws of'­fpr an PrHIIPss varil~ty of food and PnlPrtainnwnt options, thP rPsort arnas of Mnxiro oll'nr v~ry little of the nml Mexico. 
Although it is snvnntl hours from a bnach, Mnxko City rn­ePivns a lot of tourists. and tlw Zona Hosa is the most popular hangout for foreigners and MPxieans alikn. I>nspitn the largo amount of tourists in MPxieo City. this sprawling city of' approximat11ly 20 million in­habitants is still the b11st place to go if you want to truly nxpe­rinnen MPxico. 
Obviously, if you deeide to spend all of your time in the Zona Hosa, you will only get to sen tho major hotels and restaurants, which includns McDonald's, Denny's, and Pizza llut. (lneidPntally, Mexican pizza doesn't quite comparn to American pizza. espnr.ially for thosn of us from the Chicagoland arna. but the Pizza llut pizza in Mnxieo is just as grnasy as the Pizza Hut cuisine back home.) 
Outside of the Zona Hosa, Mnxieo City is a microcosm of the Mexican people. Thnrn are snr.tions of extremn povnrty contrasted by amazingly wealthy neighborhoods. While most pnopln could get by in tho Zona Hosa using a minimal amount of Spanish, the non­Spanish spnaking traveler might have a considerabln amount of difliculty communi­cating in thn middle-class neighborhood where I live. 
In the rnsort areas such as Acapulco and lxtapa. the situa­tion is rnvnrsed. Most people spend their vacations at the Mexican beach resorts without 

Robyn Simmons 
Accent Writer 
spnaking a word of Spanish, because thn Mnxir.ans who work at thnse rnsorts all speak English (and sometimes a few other languages as well). This is unfortunatn beeausc it makes the resort areas seem less Mex­ican. Speaking Spanish is thn bnst way to immerse yourself in the Mexican eulturn, and thosn people who don't try to speak the language are definitely missing out on a valuable cul­tural experience. 
When I wont to Acapulco sev­eral weeks ago, the amount of English used by the Mexicans there and the great quantity of American stores gavp, me a m­vcrsc cultun1 shock. I hadn't seen so much English since I flew out of O'llare Airport in January. We ran into several Amp,ricans therP (a few of thnm wern stereotypieally "ugly") and I was amazed at how diffP-rnnt the atmosphere was in Aca­pulco as eomparnd to Mexico City. 
As popular as Acapuleo is, a lot of people don't like it be­cause it is too touristy. Thn beach is linnd with luxury ho­tels and the nightlife in Aca­puleo exceeds all of the other cities in Mexico, including Mex­ico City. I have to admit that I had a grnat time in Acapulco, but for a tranquil vacation, Acapulco is delinitnly a place to avoid. 
Ixtapa is not quite as estab­lished as Acapulco, but it's get­ting there. Alnmdy the coast of lxtapa is lined with luxury ho­tels and expensive boutiques (where, unfortunately, you can't bargain to get the price down). Hight next door to Ixtapa is the small fishing villagn of Zihu Atanejo. which is prderable to lxtapa bn~ause then are less pnopln. lnss buildings, and the accommodations arn cheap-which is w~ry important for travelers living on a student's budgnt. 
The only big-name beach rn­sort wn haven't visitnd yot is Cancun. in tlw Yucatan penin­sula. but it's our nnxt stop. Caneun is supposed to bP somnwhen in bntwenn lxtapa and Acapuleo as far as "touristy-ness" is concerned. During the 1970s, both Ixtapa and Cancun w1~rn chosen by the computer of Mexico's Tourist ministry to bncomn nnw luxury resorts to accommodate the ovnrllow of tourists coming to Acapulco. 
For those pnople who lovn sun, sand, surf, as wnll as an exciting nightlife. Acapulco. lx­

tapa, and Cancun arn the thren hottest spots in Mexico. But for those who want to sen what Mexico is really like, be sure to swing by Mexico City.

B.C. Lions of CFL express interest in QB Major Harris 
VANCOUVER. British Columbia {AP) -The British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League liked what they saw in a workout by Major Harris and said they will pursue the former West Virginia quarterback. 
Harris flew home Sunday after a 45-minute workout Saturday with the CFL team. The Lions must wait until after the NFL draft next Sunday to see whether they have a realis­tic shot at signing him. 
"He's a prototypical profes­sional quarterback, whether it's in the CFL, NFL or any league," coach Lary Kuharich said. "He certainly has a strong, strong arm and a bonus of escapability. When he does run, he's like a big running back at 220 pounds plus." 
Harris, 22, announced earlier this year he will forgo his se­nior year at West Virginia. He is eligible for the NFL draft although some scouts predict he will be no higher than a middle-round pick because of his lack of height and some­times erratic arm. 
The higher he goes, the less chance the Lions will have at matching the money offered by the NFL team that picks him. 
Kuharich said the Lions will continue to pursue Harris this week. 


"There will certainly be dis­cussions but realistically there's less than one calendar week until the NFL draft and I'm sure Major and his repre­sentatives want to see where they fall in that draft," the coach said. 
The 6-foot-1, 220-pound Harris said he was impressed with Vancouver. 
"I just came up here to feel things out, to meet the coaches and some players, to see what type of offense they run, to see where I would fit in and stuff like that," Harris said Sunday. "It felt good. " 
The Lions rolled out the red carpet for Harris, his fiance and business representatives. They picked them up at the air­port Friday in a white Rolls­Royce and took them sightsee­ing by boat Saturday. They also managed to squeeze in a tour of B.C. Place Stadium. 
Harris led West Virginia to a 25-10-1 record as starting

College juniors may be sorry for jumping to NFL 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) Many of the college juniors who have entered this year's NFL draft may be disappointed with the outcome and their agents will have to answer, the presi­dent and general manager of the Kansas City Chiefs said Monday. 
Of 32 juniors entering the draft, which will be held early next week, only 12 are "draftable" and not many of those may be taken early on, said Carl Peterson to sports writers attending a workshop hosted by the Great Plains Region of the Associated Press Sports Editors. 
There are many good seniors in this year's draft, Peterson said, and many of the juniors who elected to enter the draft are doing so on the basis of "poor advice" from agents. 
Peterson said he opposed al­lowing college players to enter the NFL before completing their eligibility and blamed the agents for the growth in the number who are doing so. 
"It's being driven strictly by player agents looking for more money for themselves," Peterson said. He cautioned that "the money they thought will be there" may not.

-Big 10 has second thoughts about inception of Penn St. 

CHICAGO (AP) -Nearly four months after the Big 10 an­nounced tentative plans to add Penn State as an 11th school, a published report indicates that that some conference officials are less than enthusiastic about the proposal. 
Addition of the Nittany Lions is encountering increased op­position from athletic directors and coaches, especially Rick Bay of Minnesota and Bob Knight of Indiana, the Chicago Tribune reported in Sunday's editions. 
In response to the opposition, Big 10 Commissioner Jim Delany emphasized that invita­tion to Penn State represented only a _tflntative arrangement. 
"It's a two-step process," Delany said. "The first step was the invitation. The second step is for them to be brought in formally. That's under a process of review." 
Delany said the conference has set up a Transition and Expansion Committee, which has subcommittees on aca­demics and governance, com­petitive format and television and revenue sharing. 
The opposition to adding Penn State reportedly focuses on the Pennsylvania school's relatively remote location. 
''I've been to Penn State," Knight said recently. "And Penn State's a camping trip. There's nothing for about 100 miles."

The Czechoslovaks led 1-0 after the first period, then scored four goals in the second to put the game out of reach. 
Zdenko Ciger, Hobert Reichel and Jiri Dolezal scored two goals apiece for Czechoslovakia. Chris Dahlquist of the Pittsburgh Penguins scored the Americans' lone goal at 7:19 in the third period. 
In an earlier opening-round game, Team Canada beat West Germany 5-1. The Soviet Union, the defending champion, blitzed Norway 9-1 and Sweden beat archrival Finland 4-2 at Bern. 
Team USA missed an excel­lent chance to get back into the game when John Fritsche was stopped on a penalty shot early in the second period with the Americans trailing 2-0. Instead, the Czechs took a 3-0 lead about two minutes later when Ciger scored his first goal.

BOSTON (AP) The Milwaukee Brewers recorded the largest shutout in the club's history, pounding out 20 hits and beating the Boston Red Sox 18-0 Monday before a Patriots Day crowd of 35,478 in Fenway Park. 
Dave Parker and Greg Brock had four hits each and Gary Sheffield, Edgar Diaz and Brock drove in three runs apiece. Milwaukee had nine doubles, one triple but no home runs. 
Blue Jays 4, Orioles 2 
TORONTO (AI') -John Cerutti pitched five shutout in­nings and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Baltimore Orioles 4-2 Monday in the first game between the teams since their season-ending series last year. 
Toronto entered last season's 

-final weekend with a one-game lead over Baltimore in the American League East. The Blue Jays won the first two games of the series to clinch the division title, then lost to Oakland in the AL playoffs. 
Mets 10, Cubs 1 
CHICAGO (AP) -Frank Viola extended his scoreless streak to 13 innings and Howard Johnson doubled twice to drive in three runs as the New York Mets beat the Chicago Cubs 10­1 Monday. 
Viola (2-0) struck out eight, walked none and allowed four hits before Alejandro Pena re­lieved and got his first save for New York. Viola had combined with John Franco on a five-hit shutout last week against Pittsburgh. 
Reds 5, Braves 3 
ATLANTA (AP) -Barry Larkin, with at least two hits in all six games, keyed a three-run first inning with the first of his four hits and Cincinnati re­mained the only unbeaten team in the majors. 
The Reds, off to their best start since going 8-0 in 1980, jumped on Pete Smith (1-1) for four hits in the first. They made it easy for Jack Armstrong (2­0), who ran his scoreless string to 11 innings before the Braves, losers of four straight and five of six, scored in the sixth.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -Terry Pendleton had a two-run double and Jose DeLeon and five re­lievers combined on an eight­hitter, leading St. Louis over troublesome Pittsburgh. 
Jose Oquendo and Vince Coleman also had RBis as St. Louis, 5-13 against Pittsburgh in 1989, ended a six-game los­ing streak against the Pirates that dated to last year. 
John Smiley (0-2), still recov­ering from off-season elbow surgery, retired the first two hitters before Todd Zeile walked and Pedro Guerrero singled. Pendleton doubled down the right field line, scor­ing both when the ball struck the bullpen fence and caromed away from Bobby Bonilla. The Cardinals made it 4-0 in the fourth on doubles by Brunansky and Oquendo and Coleman's RBI single. 
DeLeon (1-0), winning for the second time in five career deci­sions against his former Pittsburgh teammates, allowed two hits in 5 1-3 innings, in­cluding a two-run homer by Bonilla in the fourth. Bonilla has two homers and five RBis in his last two games.

Ex-Assistant will succeed Holland as coach of Cavs 
CIIARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (APJ -Assistant Jeff Jones was named Monday as Virginia's basketball coach, ending a search that saw three more prominent coaches turn down a chance to succeed Terry Holland. 
The 29-year-old Jones, who becomes the youngest coach in 


dation he has established," Jones said of Holland, who left after 16 years to become ath­letic director at Davidson. "There will be some changes, but I promises you that the physical and mental toughness and pride with which players wear the Virginia jerseys will continue." 
During the coaching search conducted by athletic director Jim Copeland, Providence coach Rick Barnes turned down the job and Xavier's Pete Gillen and Stanford's Mike Montgomery turned down overtures about coming to Virginia. 
"I got a little lucky," Jones said. "Some things fell into place. But I'd like to think that hard work for Coach Holland has prepared me for this task." 
.Iones called the period of the search "a little bit of an emo­tional roller coaster. I've tried not to let my emotions get too high, or too low. But when the season was over, it was hard to keep and even keel." 

Copeland said Jones "has an ­uncanny grasp of the technical and strategic aspects of the game." 
A native of Owensboro, Ky., .Iones was the Cavs' point guard during the Halph Sampson era. Those teams were 102-28, won the 19SO NIT and reached the Final Four in 1981. .Iones still holds the school record for career assists at 598. 
In the summp,r of 1974, Holland took over a Virginia program that had never sent a team to the NCAA tournament and had produced winning records in just four of the pre­vious 25 years.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) ­The San Antonio Spurs, with rookie David Robinson bounc­ing back from his worst game of the year with 25 points and 12 rebounds, tied the NBA record for the most improved team with a 110-101 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night. 
The Spurs are 53-26 after winning only 21 games last season. The 32-game improve­ment ties the Boston Celtics, who did it in 1979-80, Larry Bird's rookie season. 
The Spurs also pulled within 1 1/2 games of idle Utah in the race for the Midwest Division championship. The Spurs have three games remaining, includ­ing a home date Wednesday night against, the Jazz, who have four games left.

Douglas's court battle with King is delayed again 

LAS VEGAS (AP) Heavyweight champion Buster Douglas' courtroom fight with promoter Don King has been delayed once again and now may end up being heard first in New York instead of Las Vegas. 
A federal judge in New York on Monday said he might hear the case on April 30 if a crimi­nal trial set for that date does not go forward. 
That would put the New York trial ahead of a planned trial in federal court in Las Vegas, now set for May 21. 
Douglas initiated the legal battle after he knocked out Mike Tyson in February to win the heavyweight crown, claim­ing he should be free of his con­tracts with King so he could de­fend his title in September against Evander Holyfield at The Mirage in Las Vegas. 
King filed a suit of his own in New York, asking that the con­tracts be declared valid and that The Mirage be stopped from interfering with them. 
Both sides agreed earlier this month to go to trial April 23 in Las Vegas, but that date was later vacated by U.S. District Judge Howard McKibben, who set a new date of May 21 for the Las Vegas trial. 
U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet on Monday said he would hear the New York case April 30 if a scheduled criminal case does not go forward, or May 28 if it does. 
Douglas has agreed on a $60 million two-fight deal with Mirage operator Steve Wynn, but the fights are contingent on Douglas winning the suit and being free to fight at the resort. 
Under terms of the pact, Douglas will get $25 million to defend the title against No. 1 contender Evander Holyfield in September. Should he win that fight, he will receive another $35 million for a rematch with Tyson.

Bordin, Mota stride to Marathon triumph 
BOSTON (AP) -Olympic champions Gelindo Bordin and Rosa Mota both made history Monday by becoming Boston Marathon champions. 
Bordin won the men's marathon, becoming the first Italian and first Olympic cham­pion to accomplish the feat. Mota, of Portugal, ran away with the women's race for her record -setting third Boston Marathon victory. 
The 31-year-old Bordin did what nine other men's Olympic champions failed to do by over­taking Tanzania's Juma Ikangaa at Heartbreak Hill and winning in 2 hours, 8 minutes and 19 seconds. It broke the Italian mark of 2:09:27 Bordin set in finishing fourth at Boston in 1988. 
"It is. not easy being an 

 Olympic champion," Bordin said. "For three or four months, I couldn't move with­out people stopping me -at a restaurant, on the road, every­where. If I didn't go, I hurt the sport." 
He's about to become even more well-known. The race was broadcast live in Italy, with the announcers screaming as Bordin covered the final yards. 
"Gelindo's victory on the streets of Boston brought back for me the emotions of the Olympic Games in Seoul, emo­tions which I thought couldn't be repeated," Gianni Gola, president of the Italian Track Federation, said. "But today the emotions were even more intense." 
For Ikangaa, it was another heartbreaking defeat. It was the third straight time he has finished second at Boston. Ikangaa, a one-second loser to Kenya's Ibrahim Hussein in '88 and beaten by 50 seconds by Abebe Mekonnen of Ethiopia last year, finished 1:33 behind Bordin, in 2:09:52. 
Rolando Vera of Ecuador was third in his marathon debut in 2:10:46, a South American record. 
Mota, who also won at Boston in 1987 and 1988, led the women's division the entire way, finishing in 2:25:24. Her other winning times were 
2:25:21 in 1987 and 2:24:30 in '88. 

Mota finished 42nd overall and beat runner-up Uta Pippig of West Germany by nearly three minutes. Pippig finished in 2:28:03, while Maria Trujillo of Mexico was third in 2:28:53. 
In the Masters division, 41­year-old John Campbell of New Zealand smashed the Masters world best. clocking 2:11:04 and finished fourth overall. Campbell, sixth in 1988 and fifth last year, erased the mark of 2:11:10 set by New Zealand's Jack Fultz in 1974. 
World bests also fell in the men's and women's wheelchair divisions. 
Moussetapha Badid, 24, of France took more than six minutes off the previous men's mark, winning in 1:29:53. The first eight finishers also went under the mark of 1:36:04 set 

-
by Philippe Couprie of France last year at Boston. Franz Nietlispach of Switzerland was second in 
1:31:31 and Couprie third in 1:32:15. 
In the women's wheelchair section, Jean Driscoll, 23, of Champaign, Ill., won in 1:43:17, also more than six minutes un­der the previous mark of 1:50:06, set by Connie Hansen in winning at Boston in 1 ':)89.

SOCIETY 

But it was the stirring per­formance of the unconventional Bordin who most excited the crowd that lined the 26-mile, 385-yard course from subur­ban Hopkinton to the finish line at downtown Boston. 
Running a smartly paced race, he let a group of African runners burn themselves out with a blistering early pace be­fore making his move over the hills -especially over the gru­eling Heartbreak Hill, the 20­to-21-mile mark of the race. 
"They run crazy -4:20 the first mile," Bordin said of the Africans. "I understand it im­possible to win the race at that speed. I just run by myself, con­trol my pace." 
Bordin is one of 21 children and started running at 14 wearing oversized shoes. Until five years ago, he designed homes, churches and other buildings. And now, in between running, he designs a line of clothing for a sporting goods store he manages in Verona. 
Bordin ran his first marathon in 1984 and won the European championship. He also won the European title in 1986 and the Rome Marathon in 1987, was third in the 1987 world cham­pionships and third in the 1989 New York City Marathon. 
This was his first victory since winning the Olympic gold at Seoul. 
He and Mota each collected $50,000 from the $350,000 purse.

While Mota's victory was an easy one, there was some drama in the men's field. The group of African runners, in­cluding Ikangaa and Hussein, went out so quickly it appeared the world best of 2:06:50 set by Ethiopia's Belayneh Densimo in 1988. would be broken. 
But one by one, the group broke up, until Ikangaa was far ahead after 16 miles. By 19 miles, he had stretched his lead to about 120 yards. 
Shortly afterward, however, he began experiencing cramps in his left calf and slowed no­ticeably. 
That's when Bordin, running a consistent pace, began mak­ing inroads on the faltering Ikangaa. Once he sped past him, Ikangaa could not cover the move, and steadily fell back. 
"I feel unlucky," Ikangaa said. "I will keep trying until I win. I was very disappointed. I thought I could control the pace, but I couldn't." 
Instead, it was Bordin who controlled the pace and the race the rest of the way. 
As he neared the finish line, he pumped his right hand into the air three times, then just

Chicago defeats North Stars, wins playoff series 4-3 
CHICAGO (AP) -Wayne Presley and Jeremy Roenick each scored a pair of rapid-fire goals in the second period Monday night and the Chicago Blackhawks rolled to a 5-2 vic­tory over the Minnesota North Stars to win their Norris Division semifinal series in seven games. 
The Blackhawks. the regular­season Norris champions, will open the division finals at home Wednesday night against the St. Louis Blues, who eliminated the Toronto Maple Leafs in five games. 
Presley tied the game 1-1 three minutes into the second period and put the Blackhawks ahead to stay at 4:06 with his fifth goal of the series. Both came from directly in front of goalie Jon Casey, the second on a short wrist shot during a de­layed penalty. 
Roenick knocked in his own second round at 12:41 for a 3-1 lead, then scored again at at 
14:06. giving him five goals for the series. 
Greg Millen, who was pulled for the third time in Game 6, was outstanding in goal for Chicago, stopping 30 of 32 shots. 
The Blackhawks were in trouble during the first period. They fell behind 1-0 on Don Barber's power-play goal, then went down two men when Keith Brown took a high-sticking major for cutting Barber at

Something seems strange in first round of Bookstore 
Wait just a minute here. Something seems a little bit strange in this Bookstore Basketball tournament. 
Commissioner Kevin McGee and some other Bookstore offi­cials play on a team called Jamere Jackson, Phil Sheridan and Three Other Guys Who Won't Score this Year. In its first round game on Ken Tysiac Wednesday, Jamere Jackson, Phil Sheridan and Three Other World of Sports Guys won 23-21 over a team named The Commissioner Likes to Beat Girls. 

Does anybody else smell a rat here? I can't say that I had the pleasure of seeing that game, but I'm sure those two teams battled tooth and nail right to the end. After all, the Bookstore Committee wouldn't fix games so its members could advance easily against a bunch of girls, would it? 
I don't know. What do you think? 
I suppose there is no great harm done even if the game was fixed, but it doesn't seem fair that the Bookstore offi­cials can play charades in their opening games while other teams must play their hearts out to advance to the second round. 
I just hope McGee and his friends haven't scheduled an­other Iaugher for their second round game. 
Remember when there were only three teams in the National Basketball Association? When year in and year out, the NBA title was won by either Boston, Los Angeles, or Philadelphia? 
Those days are over. A strong dose of parity has injected some life into the NBA, and as a result the first few rounds of the playoffs could be entertaining. The following teams, listed in order of relative strength, could challenge for the ti­tle. 
1. Detroit: Chances are, if you don't live in Detroit, 1) You hate the Pistons, and 2) You will be disappointed at the out­come of the playoffs this year. 
The Pistons have three excellent guards in Isiah Thomas, Vinnie Johnson and Joe Dumars, who should return from his an injury in time for the playoffs. They also have good strength up front and play great defense, but perhaps their greatest asset is their depth, a factor which always plays a key role come playoff time. 
2. 
The Los Angeles Lakers: Last year injuries to Byron Scott and Magic Johnson doomed the Lakers, but this year's club looks healthy. The only real weakness here is the lack of a true center now that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has finally re­tired. 

3. 
Utah: The Mailman, Karl Malone, is a force, and John Stockton may be the best passer in the league, but a lack of outside shooting could doom the Jazz if and when they play the Lakers. 

4. 
Chicago: Michael Jordan can't carry the Bulls to the championship all by himself. Scottie Pippen, Horace Grant
