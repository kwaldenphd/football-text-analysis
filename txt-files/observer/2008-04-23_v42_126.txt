Pope's visit spurs discussions of Catholicism 
University professors contemplate meaning of Catholic education 
By KATIE KOHLER 
News Writer 
Only days after Pope Benedict XVI made his first trip to the United States, Catholic educators at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's are pondering what it means to "witness truth and professional­ism" in their institutions. 
On April 17, University President Fr. John Jenkins and Saint Mary's College President Carol Ann Mooney were among those in attendance at the pope's address in Washington D.C. regarding academic freedom and Catholic identity. 
"It wa.'i a reaffirmation of that commitment [to truth and reason]," Jenkins said in a statement to the South Bend Tribune. 
Benedict made no speeifie references to any college or university in the address, but eneour­aged Catholic educators to seek the truth and uphold Catholic teachings.

Students find inspiration, hope for the future in papal actions, talks 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
Pope Benedict XVI visited the United States for the first time since being elected to the papacy in 2004 last week. 
The pope's talks during his visit focused on immigration, Catholic education and the Church's sexual abuse scandal. His universal message of hope resonated among Catholics nationwide, and even among Notre Dame stu­dents. 
Junior Susan Bigelow said she was touched by the fact that the pope took the time to meet with so many people throughout his visit. 
"His willingness to meet with diverse groups of people -sexual abuse victims, immigrants and teachers -has really shown how diverse we are," she said. "It was an affirmation that the American Catholic Church is a place of

University gathers to mourn student's death 
Former Zahm Hall rector Fr. Parrish delivers the homily dt a Mass to commemorate the life of junior Andrew Bunikis 
By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
Friends, family and classmates gathered at the Basilica Tuesday night in memory of Andrew Bunikis, a Zahm junior from Phoenix who died in a bus crash in Thailand last Friday. 
Bunikis had taken the semes­ter off to eontinue his work edu­cating ehildren in northern Thailand. 
University president Fr. John · Jenkins presided over the Mass. In his greeting, he expressed feeling of "sadness" and "loss." Jenkins also welcomed Bunikis' immediate family -his parents AI and Caroline and his sister Michelle -who attended the memorial service. 
Former Zahm Hall rector Fr. Daniel Parrish, who was the dorm rector when Bunikis was on campus, delivered the homily at the memorial. He also men­tioned Bunikis' family. 
"Our hearts are heavy as we remember the life of a man who was taken from us too soon," Parrish said in his homily. "Our hearts are breaking tonight with Andrew's family." 
Parrish described Bunikis as a truly caring young man who served the people of Thailand "whom he had grown to love." 
He emphasized the theme of the cross and what it means to carry its burden. 
"We find ourselves tormented by this tragic death," Parrish said. "There is no getting around it. Tonight, we know the cross." 
However, Parrish said Bunikis' life is an example of someone who did all they could to spread hope. 
"We come together in this plaee to declare against the darkness of the night the bril­liant light of Christ," he said. "[Andrew's mission] was to bring hope to all he met, from South Bend to Thailand." 
Current Zahm Hall rector Fr. Corry Colona, who lived down the hall from Bunikis, offered

Juniors run Web site to buy and sell books 
By MEG MIRSHAK News Writer 
Students in the Mendoza College of Business have a new option to sell their textbooks at the end of the semester: DormBooks.com. 
Co-founded by juniors Andrew Matasic and Karol Grzesiak, DormBooks.com is a Web site facilitating the buying and selling of used business textbooks. 
The Web site buys baek text­books for more than the book­store offers and resells them to students at a lower price, the pair said. 
"In addition to beating [the bookstore] on price, we're also more convenient since we go right to the [student's] dorm room to pick up the books and deliver the books," Matasic said. 

He said they offer the delivery service because students should not have to stand in line during finals week and worry about losing money reselling their textbooks to the bookstore. 
Currently, Dormbooks.eom employs 15 Notre Dame stu­dents who serve as pickup agents for the Spring 2008 buy­back period, which runs from May 6 to 13.

Old before 

After reenntly visiting my grand­

home, I found myself envious of 
them. 

Needless to say, this jBalousy of

feoling. 
Apparently tho 

elidu1 stating that youth is wasted 
on tlw young rings some truth. 
Throughout the visit, all I could think about was the mountain of homework that I had waiting for me when I retur01~d to campus. While I was obsessing over the numerous tests and papers due throughout the eoming week. I watched my grand­ma pack for Florida after rnturning home from a nice broakfast out with some frionds. 
At that moment, rntirnment seenwd a joy. Old agn is a small price to pay for tho lif'e that my grandparents arn leading. 
While some pnopln struggle through retirenwnt, expnriencing the hardships of monoy problnms and old age, my grandparents love being rntired. Hntirement nnablns tlwm to jnt ofT to Florida for a month to partake in walks on thn bnach and poolsidn happy hours with their condo friends. with no throat of deadlinns. papers or working for a paycheck. Tlwn, wh1m they return from Florida, they will conw back to a lifn of golfing, reading and visiting with friends. 
Meanwhill~. I would return from a 
rushed weekend visit to throe tests 
and two papers along with the loom­
ing threat of finals. 

Somehow schoolwork has driven 
mn to pathntically wish I were old 
and retirml. 

However, my grandparents paid their dues. My grandfather worked as an engineer for 40 years before retiring while my grandmother raised a family of three. They also went through eollege, though unlike me, they had to struggle for means to pay tuition. And now, their retire­ment is not without the pitfalls of knee surgeries and medical bills. 
Still, it must be a great feeling to live devoid of work and school, a feeling well-deserved after an aceomplished and successful life, although there is something wrong with a 19-year-old wishing she were 80. 
But soon I will turn in the last paper of my freshman year. turn in my last artiele for the paper, and take my last nnal. 
After that, I believe I will experi­enee a feeling somewhat akin to my grandparent's retirement. There really is no better feeling than the weight lifting off your shoulders af'ter completing a job well done. In a mere two weeks, I will eomplete my freshman year of eollege, and I will be able to proudly look back on a mostly suecessful freshman year and look ahead to a summer of free­dom and fun.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Group discusses iTunes for non-class lectures 
By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
The Council of Representatives (COR) dis­cussed the possibility of making all lectures not affiliated with courses available online as pod­casts on iTunes U at their meet­ing Tuesday. 
Making them available as podcasts will allow all students and staff to listen to lectures and forums that they cannot fit into their schedules. 
"There are a lot of things that students want to attend, but they can't," student body presi­dent Bob Reish said. 
Uploading the lectures as podcasts is simple and relative­ly cheap, Morrissey senator Austin Iloller said, 
"I believe it's just a matter of recording it and then upload­ing," he said. "The fees are minimal." 
Class of 2011 president Cynthia Weber said Notre Dame should not only offer non-class lectures but also course and lecture content as podcasts. 
"I think absolutely we should pursue podcasts as a beginning and then go to iTunes U," she said. "We bring something real­ly unique to the table as a Catholic university." 
Heish said one example of an event that could be uploaded as a podcast would be "The (Un)Holy Trinity: Entourage, Media, and Men," which took place last week and examined the portrayal of gender rela­tions in the media. 
Some COR members voiced concerns of the difficulty get­ting professors and speakers to agree to allow the University to upload their lecture online. Weber, however, said this should not be a major stum­bling block. 
"If I was giving a lecture I would jump at the opportunity to put it online," she said. 
In other COR news: 
+COR members briefly fol­lowed up last week's discussion on the Notre Dame Clothing Haiti Project. Hall President's Council co-chair Erin Walsh said she was able to meet with some alumni over the weekend and discuss specific plans. 
"We came up with some real­ly good ideas on how to make is a joint alumni-student project," she said. 
Wash said she would attempt to organize a clothing drive, possibly before the end of the semester, and then arrange to have the clothes flown to Haiti next year using an empty cargo plane.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 

Multiethnic celebration approved 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 

The Saint Mary's Board of 
Governance (BOG) approved two 
co-sponsorships at their meeting 
Tuesday. 

The first proposal came from 
former student body president 
Kim Hodges. She was seeking 
funding for a Multiethnic Senior 
Celebration event on May 3 at 7 
p.m. in Dalloway's. 

After attending the Latino and 
Black graduation events held at 
Notre Dame, Hodges said she 
wanted to do something like 
that at Saint Mary's, she said. 

"We don't have the numbers to 
do specific graduations like [at 
Notre Dame] so I thought of a 
multiethnic graduation," she 
said. 

Her reasons for wanting to hold this event were not just because of Notre Dame's cere­monies; she said she is also con­cerned with the lack of legacies ·at Saint Mary's from "alumni of 
color," she said. 

''I'm sure all of you can name 
one person on your hand... 
somebody that came to Saint 
Mary's," she said. "That's not the 
case for alumni of color, students 
of color at this college. It's just 
not happening." 

The plans for the event include 
a keynote address from 1999 
black alumna, Tysus Jackson, 
Hodges said. 

The event will be honoring and recognizing 12 multiethnic sen­iors for their support and hard work over the past four years, she said. 
"I think that it's important that we celebrate all the endeavors that our girls have had since they've been here," she said. 
Senior biology major Olyenka Bilyk also requested a co-spon­sorship for partial reimburse­ment for her participation in the Experimental Biology Conference in San Diego. 
At the conference, Bilyk pre­sented her senior comprehensive project to scientists from across the nation, she said. 
She also was able to attend lectures and meet other scien­tists, which she said gave her crucial knowledge for the Saint Mary's biology department, she said. 
"I can impart this knowledge to fellow Saint Mary's biology majors and students," she said. "I can also help bring this knowl­edge to the Saint Mary's biology department and help them become more competitive in their research." 
Both co-sponsorships were approved by the board. 
In other BOG news: 
+Student body president and vice president Mickey Grusinski and Sarah Falvey began working to extend the Student Center hours for finals week, Grusinksi said. 
They have also tried to create a stress free atmosphere in the Student Government Office dur­ing that week. There will be col­oring books and games available 
to students, Falvey said. "We're also going to try and have snacks up there," she said. 
They are also hoping to have a masseuse for a few hours for "stress release," Falvey said. 
+Admissions commissioner Kristle Hodges asked BOG mem­bers to help her look for student ambassadors for next year. 
"We love to take first-year stu­dents and sophomores," she said. 
Ambassadors are required to give one to two tours a week, participate in official visit days on campus, and are sometimes asked to host prospective stu­dents overnight, meet with prospective students for lunch, Hodges said. 
+Women's issues commission­er Becki Faunce announced that there are events for the National Week of Silence taking place this week. 
There will be a National Day of Silence Panel on Thursday at 6 
p.m. in Dalloway's, she said. The panel will include students and professors who will be talking about Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning (LGBTQ) issues.

He said Bunikis was "very kind and had a speeial energy about him" and was "very determined." 
Colona said when Bunikis told him he was nervous about being in Thailand for Christmas, Colona "encouraged him to not focus on the home­sickness but to find value in his experience there, to pick a moment and make a full senso­ry memory of it." 
In an n-mail to Colona, Bunikis dnsc.ribnd how he had brought American Christmas traditions to his school in Thailand. lie stutl'ed stockings with candy, decorated with streamers and Christmas lights and taught the kids how to make gingerbread houses. 
"I did my best to identify what I was feeling in all five senses -it was a good way to remember a happy moment," Bunikis said in the e-mail. 
Colona said Bunikis's work in Thailand perfectly described the type of person he was. 
"Andrew cared about oth­ers," he said. "His happy moment was completely inter­twined with bringing joy to the people around him. lie set out to make a difference in their lives by sharing his creativity and enthusiasm with others." 
Colona also said Bunikis would keep notes posted around his room. While some were simpln reminders about tests and sporting evnnts, oth­ers were morn ambitious like "learn Cantonese" and "learn to play piano." 
"Andrew bnlifwed that lw would accomplish thosn bigger tasks and he planned to accom­plish them, just like he plannnd to take a test or do his laun­dry," he said. "I never saw the notes myself. but I hope that one of them said, 'make a dif­ference in the world,' and another one 'Give to those in need,' bncause Andrew certain­ly accomplished those things in his life." 
Colona concluded by saying that Bunikis' life should serve as an nxample to others, and has certainly impacted his own. lie said he has already made his own note -"Believe like Andmw believt~d." 
"I encourage all of you, whoso lives Andrew toudwd, to make a note for yourself. one that Andn~w would have appredatnd," he said.

Bigelow said that she was impressed by the way Benedict addrnssnd the issue of immigra­tion during his visit. 
"Just the fact that he was in Nnw York and didn't skirt the issue said a lot,'' Bigelow said. "We should be protneting immi­grants rights and their families and I think it was really impor­tant that he addressed that." 
Bigelow said the pope's trip to the United States showed his "sorter side" to the public, despite the fact that he is usual­ly characterized as more aus.­tero in comparison to his late pmdm:nssor Pope John Paul II. 
"I grow up with .John Paul II, who is so charismatic, and I had always seen Benedict as more reserved. I think that ever since hn's bonn pope he's bonn show­ing his softer sidn,'' she said. "It's cool that America was real­ly abln to encountnr the compas­sionate side of the pope."

"Mibospi is an acronym for 'mind, body, spirit,' and it is a linn of nxclusivo luxury yoga aeeessorins that makn women l'nnl individual, fominirw and fashion-forward,'' Martini said. "Wn had sevnral advisors from tho fashion, retail and manu­l'aeturing industry that providnd us with guidance and continue to lwlp us as we dnvnlop our busirwss." 
Martini's team of four started working on tlwir husinnss von­turn in August. 

Shn said this was most evident in his willingness to meet with tho victims of the Church's sexu­al abuse scandal, which was somnthing she had not expected during his weeklong trip. 
"This was the first time vic­tims of the sexual abuse scan­dals had been met by a pope," Bigelow said. "This shed a lot of light on the pope as a leader who genuinely desires reconcili­ation with this painful past." 
The fact that the pope spoke in support of immigrants' rights and sexual abuse victims in America was great because he was able to bring that unifying message to a country that needs a lot of unity, Bigelow said. 
Sophomore Colleen Moran also said that she also was sur­prised that Pope Benedict was willing to meet with sexual abusn victims. 
"I wasn't expecting the com­ments on the sexual abuse scan­dal because he neglected before to eomment on it, but it was one of' most pressing issues for the Church and I was pleased to sec he did comment on it,'' she said. 
Additionally, Moran said that 
"Tlw four of us live in four diiTen~nt cities and three differ­ent time zones. We have beon working together since August and didn't meet in person until the night before tho competi­tion,'' she said. "We had spnnt eountloss hours on e-mail and eonl'nn~nco calls to get us ready for tlw competition. It was so nxeiting to finally meet in per­son." 
Martini said even though her team didn't win she is glad she participated in the competition. 
"We were the runner-up so we wore a bit disappointed as we hoped to win the competi­tion,'' Martini said. "However. tho experience and feedback was invaluable. The two days on campus were amazing and gave us additional validation that our idea for this business could work. It was such a thrilling experience, and not orw wo will soon forget."

the pope's visit was a unique opportunity for Americans to gain a bettor understanding of the pope and his ministry. 
"Since Home is on the European continent, it can snem like the hierarchy of Church is rather distant to the American people, having the pope come to us makes it feel much more like a personal mlationship," Moran said. · 
Moran said she thought the Pope's address to the United Nations General Assembly last Friday was particularly perti­nent. 
'The pope's address to the UN was an important reminder of Church's stance on the high value of human life, and that normative national sovereignty should not take precedence over the protection of human life and dignity," Moran said. 
She said she was also impressed by the pope's efforts to reach out the people of other faiths. 
"His visit to a synagogue in New York was important because it showed that the Church is committed to working with other faiths," she said. 
The pope's visit to a syna­gogue in New York was the first time a pope had ever visited a Jewish house of worship in the United States. 
Junior Jack Kiley said the theme of the pope's visit, "Christ our Hope," resonated through­out the Benedict's time in the country. 
"The main thing that stood out to me aside from the theme of 'Christ our Hope' -the mes­sage of hope and renewal for Church in America -was his address to the youth in New York," Kiley said. "It really res­onated with me when he said, 'Take courage."' 
Kiley said the pope's message of hope was crucial for the American Catholic Church. 

"There has been a lot of talk about losing vocations, so it was important for Benedict to come with the theme 'Christ Our Hope,' and say that if we put our hope in Christ, Christ will take care of the Church in America,'' he said. 
Kiley also said the week's events helped him better under­stand the pope as leader of the Church. 
"I think before he came to America a lot of people won­dered about who he was," Kiley said. "When he came here he showed that he's an incredibly holy and intelligent man who has deep faith and deep com­passion and cares about his Chun~h-that surprised me and I really liked that."

Zimbabwe's neighbors block shipment 
JOHANNESBUHG, South Africa-Zimbabwe's regime got a taste of the international isolation critics say it deserves, with its neighbors uniting to block a shipment of Chinese arms to prevent them from being used against Robert Mugabe's opponrmts. 
Union, church and human rights leaders across southern Africa rallied against allowing the Chinese freighter An Yue Jiang to dock at ports in any of landlocked Zimbabwe's neigh­bors, and they were bolstered by behind-the­scenes pressure from the United States. 
In the end, governments usually unwilling to criticize Mugabe barred the ship at a time when Zimbabwe's government is being accused of cracking down on dissenters. 
On Tw~sday, church leaders in Zimbabwe said people were being tortured, abduct11d and mur­dored in a campaign of retribution against opposition supporters following the March 29 election, and urged international intervention.

Chicago sees increase in violence 
CHICAGO -Nine people were killed in 36 shootings over the weekend in Chicago, reflecting what some community leaders say is a deadly breakdown in discipline among gang members after a crackdown over the past few years put many of their leaders behind bars. 
"The older guys in the past looked out for the little ones. Now they're all locked up." said Nick Stames, a social studies teacher at Crane Tech lligh School on the city's gang-ridden West Side. "There's no sense of discipline in the projects. Everybody's doing their own thing." 
Now there is growing fear that Chicago could be in for a long, bloody summer.

Bush continues to support NAFfA 
President warns that migratory pressure from Mexico could increase without group 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS President Bush chastised lawmakers on Tuesday for letting international trade deals falter in Congress and criticized Democratic presidential contenders for wanting to scrap or amend the vast North American free-trade zone. 
At the clese of a two-day summit, Bush, along with Mexican President Felipe Calderon and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Ilarper, stood solidly behind the North American Free Trade Agreement. Under NAFTA, trade between the U.S., Canada itnd Mexico has swelled from roughly $290 billion in 1994 to an estimated $1 trillion by the end of this year. 
"Now is not the time to renegotiate NAFTA or walk away from NAFTA," Bush said. "Now is the time to make it work better for all our people. And now is the time to reduce trade barri­ers worldwide." 

The summit was over­shadowed by Tuesday's Pennsylvania Democratic presidential primary race between Sens.

Thn pope addressnd between

intimate quality to thn speech, 
Mooney said. 
"This was not a large crowd. We 
were only about nine rows deep," 
shn said. "We were all anxiously 
awaiting and when hn came in, it 
was elnetrilying." 
For those not in attendance, 
however, tho message resonated 
through both campuses. 
For theology profnssor Timothy 
Matinova, the William and Anna 
.Jean Cushwa Director of the 
Cushwa Center for the Study of 
American Catholieism, the Pope's 
message was not one of' dirncted 
change, but more of advice on 
how to improve the current status 
of' Catholic institutions. 
"Ao.; I hnard it, he wasn't saying 
do X. Y. and Z. it WlL'i an admoni­
tion to pay attention and continue 
to do the good work ... But you're 
never linishnd. You can always do 
bntter to guard the Catholic char­
actor and identity in universitins," 
Matinova said. 
Ao.; presi(llmt of a Catholic col­
lngn, Mooney heard Bnnedict's 
message as one of hopn for tho 
futuro of Catholic institutions. 
"The primary thing I took away 
from it W<L'i his encouragmnnnt to 
all of us to rnalize what important 
work we're doing and his grate­
fulnnss to all of us li>r doing that 
work," shn said. "It was an elo­

Moonny, along with othnr edu­
cators. did not know what to 
~~xpnct from thn spnnch. 
"At onn point, he said that bdng a Catholic institution isn't dnpnndnnt on statistics or ortho­doxy. It is more about the spirit of the plaen whom people nm:ountnr the living c;od ... it WlL'i a kind of optimism that our faith gives us and the hope we can communi­eate to others because of our faith," shn said. "I think he was absolutely right ... it is a spirit that infusns Itho institution I and leads p1~ople to lwpd'ulness." 
Defining Catholic Identity 
Lawrencn Cunningham, the .John A. O'Brien Professor of Theology at Notrn Dame, was sur­prisnd with Benedict's eneourag­ing words amidst renmt critieism of Catholie institutions li1r recent eonlli1:Lo.; bntwmm Catholic identity and acadmnic l'n~Pdom. 
"I think the most interesting thing about the talk is the nneour­agmnnnt that hn gave to Catholic nducators. You have to remember hn wao.; speaking not only to uni­versity and college presidenlo.;, but also to all people in Catholic edu­cation," he said. "I very much admirn mu:ouragement li1r priesLo.; and sisters and brothers to contin­ue important ministry in the church." 
Cunningham also noted the importance of recognizing and defining a sd10ol's Catholic id(mti­ty. 
"I Bnrwdktl said that schools ought to be vnry firm in the identi­fication of sehools ao.; Catholic. And I think that, of course, goes with­out saying. I think for example, what is singular about Notre Dame'? It is a Catholic university," Cunningham said. "That gives fur­ther encouragement to kind of reflect upon, how we best articu­latn that idea." 
Cunningham also echoed Bnnndiet's point that universities are more than just statistics. 
"You cannot meao.;ure a Catholic university purely by reason of nurnbnrs. For example, the demo­graphies of the student body at Notre Damn according to tho books is H5 to H7 percent Catholic. Georgetown is 50 percent of a lit­tin less. Sophia University in Tokyo is lnss than I 0 percent. Dons that make it less Catholic than Georgetown or Notre Dame'?" 

Numbers, while important to the composition of the institution, cannot be the sole determinate in its Catholic identity. 
"You can't use numbers to equatn with ideals." 
Rev. Hichard McBrien, a theolo­gy professor at Notre Dame, said it's the rnsponsibility of the mem­bers of a Catholic institution to maintain its Catholic identity. 
"The point is that a particular number of Catholic faculty and studenlo.; does not itself make an institution Catholic. At the same time, there must exist a critical mass of faculty. students and administrators to sustain and enhance Catholic character," he said. "There must exist a commit­ment that permeates all aspeclo.; of life of the institution -not just the academic, but also the liturgical and spiritual." 
Academic freedom 
In light of the performance of the "Vagina Monologues" at Catholic colleges across the coun­try, inducting Notre Dame, and the recognition of pro-choice clubs and other actions deemed anti­Catholic at colleges and universi­ties across the country, Pope Benedict articulated his stance on academic freedom and the place it holds in university life. 
"He reafiirmed academic free­dom and in afiirming it, said fac­ulty has the freedom to pursue truth through caref'ul analysis that leads them to find it," College president Carol Ann Mooney said. "He emphasized that if we're should not be ignored. 
"I think that's probably an over­ly generous way -making a much more subtle point, and the subtle point was this -you can­not make academic freedom an absolute value," Cunningham said. "It always has to bn seen in the context of the pursuit of the

trine for the sake of academic free­dom, Cunningham said he worries about the relationship between the Vagina Monologues and Notre Dame 
"Not that I was much in favor of the Vagina Monologues ... My biggest objection-it becomes kind of code word to identify Notre Dame. In the big scheme of things, the Vagina Monologues are basically minor league." 
During his address, Pope Benedict asserted that Catholic values trump academic freedom, however, academic freedom

tion, the truth as 
it comes out of both our encounter of faith and reason . . . There are no limits to academic freedom." 
McBrien focused not on the competition between Catholic identity and academic frnedom, but their similarities. 
"There is no inherent opposition between the teachings of the Church and academic freedom. If there is any discrepancy at all, it is between the requirements of aca­demic freedom and particular interpretations of church teach­ings," McBrien said. "In other words, the differences are matters of theology, not faith." 
Implications of the visit 
Pope Benediet's visit to the United States had many important implications for the future of Catholicism, McBrien said. 
"It was a great success. The Pope showed himself to be a non­threatening, warm and engaging person, contrary to the impression that many Catholies have had of him because of his many ynars a<> hnad of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith," he said. "His talk to Catholic edueators was, a'i prndicted, free of scolding, warn­ings, or harsh demands. It was essnntially a positive address with which few Catholic university fac­ulty or administrators could take serious issue." 
Matinova, too, saw both the speech and the visit as an unex­pected surprise to many Catholics. 
"It is a great boost forward, a moment of encouragement. It is a good positive effect, a shot in the arm for Catholicism in the United States."

IN BRIEF 

Yahoo Inc. first quarter profits rise 
SAN FRANCISCO -Yahoo Inc. delivered first­quarter results that surpassed analysts' modest expectations, but the performance might not be enough to fortify the Internet pioneer's defense against software maker Microsoft Corp.'s takeover bid. 
The Sunnyvale-basp,d company said Tuesday that it earned $542.2 million, or 37 cents per sharP., more than triple its profit of $142.4 mil­lion, or 10 cents per share, at the same time last year. 
Most of the first-quarter improvement stemmed from a non-cash gain of $401 million recorded to recognize Yahoo's stake in the par­ent company of Alibaba.com, a leading e-com­merce site in China that went public last year. 
If not for the Alibaba windfall, Yahoo would have Harned 11 cents per share, comparable to its profit at the same time last year, on an apples-to-apples basis. 
The results were 2 cents above the average earnings estimate on the same basis among analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. 
H1Mmue climbed 9 percent to $1.82 billion. 
Whirlpool suspends 39 workers 
INDIANAPOLIS -Smoking can be hazardous to your health, and it's turning into a bad career move, too. 
A Whirlpool Corp. factory in Evansville, Ind., suspended 39 workers who had signed paper­work claiming they don't use tobacco after they were seen smoking or chewing tobacco on com­pany property. Now. some could be fired for lying, company spokeswoman Debby Castrate said. 
Rising health care costs are turning employers across the country into nannies. Annual health care premiums are rising more than 10 percent a year. and many companies are fighting this by trying to encourage healthy living, said Indianapolis benefits lawyer Mike Paton. 
"I can't think of a client of ours who has not shifted their focus to controlling the cost of their health care plan," he said. 
Many employers have developed wellness pro­grams to motivate employees. Others ask employees to state on benefits forms whether they use tobacco, Paton said.

Government releases fuel plan 
Gas prices and global warming call for environmentally-efficient vehicles 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The next generation of new cars and trucks will need to meet a fleet average of 31.6 miles per gallon by 2015, the Bush administration proposed Tuesday, seeking more fuel­efficient vehicles in the face of high gasoline prices and con­cerns over global warming. 
Transportation Secretary Mary Peters outlined the plan on Earth Day, setting a sched­ule that was more aggressive than initially expected by the auto industry. It responds to a new energy law that requires new cars and trucks, taken as a collective average, to meet 35 mpg by 2020. 
"This proposal is going to help us all breathe a little easier by reducing carbon dioxide emissions from tailpipes, eutting fuel con­sumption and making driving a little more affordable," Peters said.

The Pope on Catholic school identity 
Pope Benedict XVI's address to Catholic educators requires extensive analysis. We can mention here only a few of the aspects pertinent to Notre Dame. 
The Pope reject­

ed a merely statis­
tical eoncept of 
Catholic identity:

"A university or 
Wrong?
school's Catholic identity is not sim­ply a question of the number of Catholic students ... Catholic identity is not dependent upon statistics. Neither can it be equated simply with ortho­doxy of course eontent." Some at Notre Dame will spin those statements to minimize eoncem about the sinking of the number of Catholic faculty below the fifty percent mark or about the haphazard exposure, if any, of Notre Dame students to orthodox course con­tent. For Benedict, however, the irrele­vaney of mere statistics evidently means that it is not enough to count the faculty who, for whatever reason, cheek the "Catholic" box. "Catholic identity," he said, "demands and inspires much more: namely that each and every aspect of your learning com­munities reverberates within the eccle­sial life of the faith. Only in faith can truth become incarnate and reason truly human, capable of directing the will along the path of freedom (cf. Spe Salvi, 23). In this way our institutions make a vital contribution to the mis­sion of the Church and truly serve soci­ety." 
This obviously means that a Catholic university cannot isolate itself from the "ecclesial life" of the Church: "A partic­ular responsibility therefore for each of you, and your colleagues, is to evoke among the young the desire for the act of faith, encouraging them to commit themselves to the ecclesiallife that fol­lows from this belief. It is here that freedom reaches the certainty of truth. 

In choosing to live by that truth, we 
embrace the fullness of the life of faith 
which is given to us in the Church." 
On this point, that "the fullness of the life of faith ... is given to us in the Church," Notre Dame has a problem, of its own making. The President, Fr. Jenkins, and the Provost, Dr. ·Burish, initiated a new process of dialogue in their April 2 "statement on the ration­ale for hiring faculty who will enhance our Catholic mission." The statement went on for six pages about keeping Notre Dame "truly Catholic" without once mentioning the Catholic Church. That is like explaining how to play baseball without mentioning the ball. The new dialogue process will be inter­minable and fruitless, as have been all its predecessors. 
The incoherence of this dialogue project arises from Notre Dame's dogged adherence to an abstract relic of 1960s ideology. In 196 7, officials of the leading Catholic universities met at the Notre Dame retreat at Land ()'Lakes, Wise., and declared that: "To perform its teaching and research functions effectively, the Catholic uni­versity must have a true autonomy and academic freedom in the face of authority of whatever kind, lay or cleri­cal, external to the academic commu­nity itself." 
That claim of autonomy from exter­nal authority is phony. Notre Dame, like all universities, willingly submits to dozens of governmental and non­governmental authorities including, of course, the NCAA. The only "external authority" Notre Dame will not recog­nize appears to be the Catholic Church. The Notre Dame brand of academic freedom, for example, is hardly consis­tent with Benedict's: "I wish to reaf­firm," he said, "the great value of aca­demic freedom. In virtue of this free­dom you are called to search for the truth wherever careful analysis of evi­dence leads you. Yet it is also the case that any appeal to the principle of aca­
demic freedom in order to justify posi­
tions that contradict the faith and the 
teaching of the Church would obstruct 
or even betray the university's identity 
and mission; a mission at the !wart of 
the Church's munus docendi [teaching 
office or function] and not somehow 
autonomous or independent of it." 
Interestingly, Benedict reaffirmed, without explicit mention of it, the prin­eiples of Ex Corde Ecclesiae, the 1990 Apostolic Constitution on Catholic Universities. Ex Corde requires of the Catholic university "a recognition of and adherence to the teaching authori­ty of the Church in matters of faith and morals." 
A !ina! quote from Benedict causes regret that no one asked him about the Vagina Monologues: "Teachers and administrators, whether in universities or schools," said Benedict," have the duty and privilege to ensure that stu­dents receive instruction in Catholic doctrine and practice. This requires that public witness to the way of Christ, as found in the Gospel and upheld by the Church's Magistnrium, shapes all aspects of an institution's life, both inside and outside the class­room." It would be difficult to imagine the man who spoke those lines finding academic merit in the Vagina Monologues. 
The problem is truth-in-labeling. Notre Dame, in its fundraising, profess­es to be Catholic. But it defines that term by its own interpretation. An appropriate name for that mind-set is Protestantism, except that Protestants have the integrity not to call them· ·  selves Catholic.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
China reaping what 

it has sown 

In response to the commentary titled Olympics Symbolize Peace {Apr. 18) I felt compelled to point out some glaring omis­sions and hypocrisy. The authors Yue and Lili take issue with recent protests associ­ated with the tour of the Olympic torch calling the protests "unacceptable." In the sense that it is unfortunate that this cere­mony has been characterized by political protests rather then celebrations of athlet­ic excellence, we both agree. 
However, it is clear that the authors have no understanding of why China's hosting of Olympic Games generates the type of political activity that we are see­ing. In particular, I had a problem with the hypocrisy concerning their complaints about the media coverage and the call for the games to be apolitical. Yue and Lili complain about "some media coverage being seriously distorted." This seems incredible to complain about given the wide-scale censorship that the Chinese government practices. Since the Chinese government strictly controls foreign media access to Tibet, practices wide-scale inter­net censorship at home, and regularly imprisons those who attempt to speak out it seems odd for one to complain about alleged "media bias." 
Another problem was the authors' state­ment that "the Olympics are not about politics." While in an ideal world this would be true, but reality paints a com­pletely. different picture. Berlin before WWII, the killing of Israeli athletes at Munich, and the boycotts for the Los Angeles and Moscow games clearly shows that politics are deeply engrained with the Olympics. To think because China is host­ing the games that politics should be dis­missed is naive. It's ironic that the authors on one hand call for the games to become apolitical, but then make the argument that abandoning calls for a boycott will lead to China to open politically strikes me as extremely hypocritical. 
In closing I agree with the authors' sen­timents that the Olympics should symbol­ize peace. However, when the government that hosts the games is complicit in wide­scale human rights abuses both at home and abroad (Darfur and Myanmar/Burma come to mind) then it becomes very understandable why some people feel the need to protest what they see as a gross misrepresentation of what the Olympics symbolize. I would suggest that the best way for the authors to achieve their goal of a torch ceremony and Olympic Games free of protests would be to pressure their government towards increased political freedoms and respect for human rights, but then I realize that is not such a good idea as many of the students in Tiananmen Square found out. So in the end the Chinese government has reaped what they have sown to the detriment of its own citizens and the international com­munity.

You knovv what really 
grinds my gears? 

After almost four years of observation, wonder and silent judgment, and in thanks to the many contributions of close friends (either by idea or example), I present to you a Peter Griffin-inspired rendition of ... "You Know What Really Grinds My Gears?" ... when people have an unnecessary sense of entitlement ... when people make out on the track in Rolfs {at 11 a.m.... that's right, you just got called out) ...when people unnecessarily abbrev ... the Hammes Bookstore ... when girls carry those ridiculously huge and won­derfully impractical bags into the dining hall while getting their food (seriously? get the hell out of my way!) ... obliviousness and inconsideration ...when people cut the line at Fever {party foul) ... professors who unnecessarily bring their politics into the classroom ... people who chew with their mouth open ... reality shows that portray how pathetic people are (Flavor of Love, Rock of Love, the Gauntlet, Pick-Up Artist, the Hills, etc.) ... when people pretend not to remember talking to you at the bar the night before ... when the Observer prints the same crossword two days in a row ... when professors {or admin­istrators, for that matter) make attendance a requirement (ifl can learn just as much by not coming to· class, upon whom is that a reflection?) ... the bureaucracy of SAO ... PigTostal ... that little undercover Indiana State Excise policeman with the backpack and backwards hat ... Hillary Clinton ... people who call for the prohibition of alcohol at Notre Dame ... when people care more about their taxes than they do about justice, humanity and responsibility ... arrogance ... fake baking (yet, I strangely appreciate the effort involved in presenting a perfectly tanned and groomed body for the purpose of donning a Borat thong) ... girls who misrepresent themselves to get a guy to like them ... when peo­ple care more about the Vagina Monologues and the morality of alcohol consumption than they do about China, Tibet, Sudan, the Iraq War, the next Potus, the failing health care "system," people denying the Holocaust, the environment, etc ... drivers who don't use their turn signals when turning ... when guys grunt/hiss/generally make noise when they're working out (seriously? We know you're lifting bud, keep it together) ... waiting lists ... straight-brimmed hats ... the word "Pink" on clothing (for that matter, guys who wear pink as well) ... every application that you can think of for the idea "someone else will take care of it" (e.g. the dishes) ... when people initiate a conversation with you and then proceed to talk endlessly about themselves ... and lastly, when we forget the experi­ence of things that have fallen by the wayside or don't get to experience them at all (Rally in the Alley, Budweiser sponsoring Antostal, Boat Club, Corby's actually being on Corby's, St. Patrick's Day at College Park, Dis-0 as it used to be, SYR's in dorms, the flowerbed entrance to ND, Fever being cheap, a National Championship in football, funny team names for Bookstore, actually finding a parking spot on campus) ... 
And that, ahem, is what really grinds my gears.

Don't criticize Ine or I just Inight cry 
I love Notre Dame. I love walk­ing around campus and being able to reflect what is going on in the world. Sometimes it makes me cry. So it is with lots of thoughts and experiences in class that I sit here and try to tell everyone what I think is a going on. 
There is a major problem with the student body here. It is the problem of ignorance mixed with close-mindedness. A person who is ignorant does not need to remain so. It is the problem of those who refuse to recognize that there is the possibility of dif­ferent views in the world. That people have multiple explana­tions for what is going on in the world. 
You don't need to Ghange your views, but be open to the possi­bility that there are different views. I urge the student body to do research on both sides of all issues that you believe in. On both sides of issues that are most close to your heart. I want to believe in the goodness of peo­ple. I believe that people love. 
It is hurtful to be told in class that I am a hypocrite. Yet, it is important to take someone call­ing you a hypocrite to look at why they would say that to you and others in your class. The problem for some people who will go and say you are being hypocritical is that they take bits and pieces of what you say and ignore the rest. This is why I want to tell the student body to look at the whole picture. Look at what you can do for the world. It is our responsibility to go out and do something. 
There was recently a film series and conference on geno­cide. From this I could not help but feel pain for what is going on. Speaking with my room­mates, I realize we are on the path to do something for the world. We all have that opportu­nity, especially here at Notre Dame. We must take those opportunities and take them. Do the research and love life, all of life. Be open to what is out there in the world. Stop being ignorant and stop the close-mindedness present when you ignore what you hear in classes. And most importantly remember that you are loved, no matter what.

Olympic boycott only 
hurts athletes 
In agreement with the April18 column by Yue Li and Lili Ji enti­tled "Olympics symbolize peace," I believe it is necessary for those protesting the upcoming Olympic Games to evaluate the implica­tions of such an action. 
Not only is it correct to say that the Olympics are not about poli­tics, but what many appear to have forgotten is what the Olympic Games are about: the athletes. These individuals have dedicated countless hours to bet­tering body, mind and soul in aims of participating in this timeless, incredible and (supposedly) unit­ing experience. Then what hap­pens? Just because the Olympic Games happen to find place in a country whose historical and recent conduct we reject, we throw a fit, forgetting that, although it is true that this event serves as a great opportunity for China to illustrate her character, the vast majority of the Olympics has nothing at all to do with the Chinese. 
The eventual outcome -and it's only getting worse -is that the separation between a govern­ment's foreign policy and its com­mon citizens is horribly perverted. We have wheelchair-bound Chinese paralympian Jin Jing being mauled as she's wheeled down an avenue in Paris and, while we're on the subject, world leaders such as French President Nicolas Sarkozy boycotting the opening ceremonies. Is this for real? 
Of course, boycotting the Olympics is nothing new, as coun­tries have previously refrained from attending when quite con­venient, namely in 1965 and 1980. But again, who is losing by our boycotting? Presumably, nation A boycotts nation B to pain nation B such that nation B will now stop doing whatever it is that nation A condemns. Unfortunately the pain is -in some cases literally -on the athletes more than anyone.

Watch out Notre Dame, things are about to get fierce. Christian Siriano, the winner of the fourth season of Bravo's hit TV series "Project Runway," is coming to campus tonight to talk about life as one of the country's hottest new designers. 
Siriano, 22, is the youngest win­ner in the fashion design show's ment in New York City that didn't even have a 1 proper bed, as the designer claimed to rathecl use his money for clothes and his space as a, work area. After this fact was made known in one of the last episodes of the season, W Hotels gave Siriano a bed to help furnish his living area.

moved to London where he attended American InterContinental University, later interning at both Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen. These internships provided Siriano with invaluable experience and opportunity, especially since the designer has named McQueen as his favorite designer and one of his strongest fashion inspirations. 
After being cast on the fourth season of "Project Runway," Siriano immediately proved to be a top contender. He won four challenges, the most of any individual of the season, and earned a spot as one of the show's three finalists. With this honor came the opportunity to create a twelve-piece collection to be shown in Bryant Park during New York's fashion week. 
Victoria Beckham, guest judge for the finale, along with regular judges Heidi Klum, Michael Kors and Nina Garcia, praised Siriano's Musketeer-inspired collection, which prominent­ly featured ruffles and voluminous tops. Siriano was not only named the overall winner of the show by the judges, but was also voted "Fan Favorite", an honor decided by viewers. 
Siriano was glad to accept the prizes that came with his victory, which included $100,000 to start his own label and a 2008 Saturn Astra. 

Siriano's distinctive character 
and flair also seems to have 
made an impact on the writers of NBC's "Saturday Night Live," which in a recent episode featured a skit about a fictitious Bravo show called "Fierce: The Hot Mess Make-Over Show." Amy Poehler, sporting flat-ironed hair and familiar glasses, played Siriano, and used his catchphrases "fierce", "tranny" and "hot mess" to excess to parody the always-entertain­ing comments of the "Project Runway" winner. 
"Project Runway" mentor, Tim Gunn and his, show "Tim Gunn's Guide to Style" were also par­odied in the skit. Gunn, who has guided hopeful designers through all four seasons of the "Project Runway," has been especially praiseful of Siriano. Gunn stated in a March 2008 inter­view, "I really believe he is his generation's Marc Jacobs. I really do. We have found America's, next great fashion designer." 
By speaking to any "Project Runway" fans on campus, you can quickly sense the excitement for Siriano's appearance, which leaves many anxious to find out just what kind of entertaining· they are in for. The lecture will take place tonight at 7 p.m. in 101 DeBartolo Hall.

COMPILED FROM THE OBSERVER'S WlRF. SERVlCES 
NFL 
Associated Press 
DAVIE, Fla. -Jake Long seemed at ease in his new role as the NFL's No. 1 draft pick, leaning into a news conference microphone to talk about his mean streak while his mother sat in the corner, nodding as she smiled. 
The Miami Dolphins were grinning Tuesday, too. They signed the Michigan left tackle to a five-year contract with $30 million guaranteed, and they'll select him with the top pick in the draft Saturday. 
The deal allows the Dolphins and Long to avoid a possible holdout. 


"It's really important for us to know Jake is going to be on the field for us on time when training camp begins in July," coach Tony Sparano said. "That was critical." 
Long's total contract package is for $57.75 mil­lion, said a person famil­iar with the negotiations who didn't want to be identified because the Dolphins declined to reveal terms. Last year's top pick, JaMarcus Russell, signed for $61 million with the Oakland Raiders but missed all of training camp before reaching a deal. 
Long becomes the high-
IN BRIEF Kevin Garnett named NBA 
defensive player of the year 
WALTHAM, Mass. -When Kevin Garnett starts screaming. the Celtics' defense stops struggling. 
For all his assets _ athleticism, intensity, intelligence _ it's the ability to communicate with team­mates that he considers the key to Boston's skill at shutting down opponents. 
"I talk. I understand how defense works," he said after being selected the NBA defensive player of the year Tuesday. "Communication's probably the biggest thing when it comes to defense." 
An outstanding defender throughout his previous 12 sea­sons, all with Minnesota, Garnett won the league award for the first time by a wide margin one day before Boston takes a 1-0 lead into Game 2 of the first-round series against Atlanta. 

est-paid lineman in the NFL and a 6-foot-7, 315­pound cornerstone in a rebuilding project for the new Dolphins regime led by Bill Parcells. Last sea­son Miami went 1-15, and the offensive line has been a chronic problem in recent years. 
"Jake was our guy from the beginning," general manager Jeff Ireland said. "Jake Long was on the top of our board for a long time. There wasn't a whole lot of debate. We thought it was a very good fit with the Miami Dolphins." 
With many other needs as well, the Dolphins were interested in trading 
Brendan Hayw:ood escapes
suspension for flagrant foul 
WASHINGTON -Washington Wizards cenier Brendan Haywood was so steamed over his lack of play­ing time in last year's playoffs series against the Cleveland Cavaliers that he left the court before the final game was over and removed the nameplate above his locker. 
In this year's rematch, Haywood has very much made a name for himself. In highlight shows across the land, he's The Man Who Shoved LeBron James. 
"I've been criticized normally for not fouling," Haywood said. "This is actually different ground for me." 
Under orders to give James a rough time in the paint, Haywood took the bruiser's act a bit too far when he pushed James with both hands while the Cavaliers' megastar was airborne during a layup attempt in the third quarter of Cleveland's Game 2 victory Monday night.

the top pick for multiple lower choices. When no suitors surfaced, they began negotiations last week with Long's agent, Tom Condon. 
"It's such a great honor to be the No. 1 pick," Long said. "I don't think it has sunk in yet. It's some­thing every kid dreams about. I'm just real excit­ed that it happened. Now I'm coming to a great place." 
Long flew to South Florida with his parents Tuesday morning for the news conference. The Dolphins said they didn't conduct contract talks with any other potential picks.

WADA drops appeal of U.S. 
arbitration agrunst Jenkins 
LONDON -American sprinter LaTasha Jenkins can compete again after the World Anti-Doping Agency dropped its appeal of a US arbitra­tion ruling that cleared her of a posi­tive drug test. 
The decision makes it official that Jenkins is the first athlete to beat the 
U.S. Anti-Doping Agency on a drug charge. The two-time world medalist tested positive for the steroid nan­drolone at a meet in Brussels, Belgium, in July 2006. 
A three-person U.S. arbitration panel had ruled against the USADA in December. It said results of her test were compromised because both European labs testing her sample violated international standards that require the tests be run by two dif­ferent technicians. 
At the time of the ruling, USADA had been 36-0 against American ath­letes in front of arbitration panels.

Seahawks release former MVP 
Associated Press 
KIHKLAND. Wash. -The Seattle Seahawks released former MVP Sh<tun Alexander, just 26 months after he signed a $62 million contract as the franchise's cornerstone. 
Seahawks president Tim Huskell said Tuesday the team released Alexander unconditionally hours after the running back passed a physical. It's been a rapid fall for the 30-year-old. When he signed that mammoth deal, he was coming ofT an MVP snason in 2005 and a Super Bowl appearance. Now he's looking for work, coming ofT of two unimpressive and injury filled seasons. 
"Yeah. it's sad, really," Huskell said after announc­ing a move that had been expectPd in Seattle for six weeks, since the signings of free agent running backs Julius Jones and T.J. Duckett. "He's been such an 

upstanding guy through my whole tenure here. I don't think we have that Super Bowl run if it wasn't for Shaun. 
"It shows you have tough this game is, how ever­changing it is, how you can't play forever.... You just can't do it." 
Alexander will try again in 2008. The three-time Pro Bowl run ncr, whose last two seasons have been his worst, said he is not retiring. 
"I will be playing for anoth­er NFL team this fall, and doing everything I can to contribute," said Alexander, who ran for just 716 yards in 13 games last season _ his lowest total since he replaced Hieky Watters as Seattle's lead back in 2001. 
"I am healthy, energized and looking forward to beginning the next chapter of my NFL career," he said. 
"My family will remain in the Seattle area, and when my days in the NFL do even-tually come to an end, I plan to retire here. Our hearts are woven into the fabric of this community, we are blessed to be part of it, and we enjoy contributing to it in every way we can. Thank you, Seattle." 

The Seahawks were wait­ing for Alexander's broken

Irish end 
 

season In fourthplace 
Marquette shoots ten over par to gain title 
By PETER REISENAUR Sports Writer 
Notre Dame ended its season with a fourth-place finish in the Big East Tournament, completing what was a good, but at times frustrating season for the Irish at the Traditions Golf Club in Hebron, Ky. 
The Marquette Eagles took the title, shooting a 10-over par to beat out Louisville who finished up with a 12 -over par for the tournament. The Irish were able to l'inish in fourth place amongst the 12 teams at the Tournament this weekend. 
Sophomore Doug Fortner, a solid performer all year long for the Irish, finished three-over par for the tour­nament with a 219. He fin­ished the tournament in fourth overall, helping him earn his first career all­conference honors, and cap off' an impressive year for the second year golfer. 
Junior Josh Sandman. the most consistent performer all year long for the Irish had another strong tourna­ment this week. He did not have his best final round but still earned a second all-Big East honor, and also l'inished in the top 10 of the tournament, making him the first Irish player to finish in the top 10 since 1980. Sandman was able to finish the tournament at four over par and tied for seventh place in the tour­nament. 
Sandman also was able to finish the year off with a 
73.1 stoke average and 
72.41 in the spring season, which gave him an individ­ual berth to the NCAA regional. 
The other impressive fin­isher for the Irish was a freshman in Dustin Zhang. He showed improvement throughout the year, and in the tournament, finishing in 18th place in the tourna­ment despite a 77 in the first round. lie finished eight over par for the tour­nament, and the Irish hope that he will be one of the future stars for their team. 
All in all, the Irish were happy with their season, although they were at times a little inconsistent. They hope to improve upon that inconsistency next year, and hopefully come up with a Big East title.

Irish win third straight Big East title 
By MICHAEL BLASCO Sports Writer 
After dominating the compe­tition through the first two rounds of the Big East Championship Tournament, No. 25 Notre Dame cruised through the final round to cap­ture the program's third con­ference title in six years. 
The Irish lead throughout the three-day tournament, which was held at the par-72, 6,080 yard Elk Run Golf Club in Batavia, Ohio, and shot a final round-best 302 to clinch the victory. Notre Dame sophomore Annie Brophy earned medalist honors for the first time in her career, leading the field with a 6-over par 222, while Irish freshman So-Hyun Park shot an 8-over par 224 to finish sec­ond. Overall, four Notre Dame golfers finished in the top five of the field. Brophy reaffirmed the importance of the team effort in the victory. 
"To win conference as a team is great because we've worked really hard for this," Brophy said. "As an individual, it also feels great. We all played really hard. We played one hole at a time. I know that sounds cliched, but it's true." 
Behind the Irish (899), No. 28 Louisville (908) and Cincinnati 
(908) rounded out the podium ahead of the seven-team field. Notre Dame shot the three low­est team rounds of the tourney (296, 301, 302), while Cardinals freshman Sara­Maude Juneau shot a third­round, even-par 72 to stake out the lowest 18-hole score of the week. 
The young Irish squad thor­oughly outplayed the competi­tion, with every Notre Dame golfer finishing in the top 15 overall. Behind Brophy and Park's 1-2 fmish, junior captain Lisa Maunu and sophomore Kristin Wetzel carded twin 11­over par 227s to finish tied for fourth. Maunu led after the first round, but bogeyed four of her final seven holes of the tournament to slip to fourth. Freshman Katie Conway added a final-round 77 to her previ­ous scores to finish a respectable 17-over par, tied for 15th overall. 

The conference title caps an Irish season marked by unprecedented success. Notre Dame, who opened the 2007­2008 season with three straight tournament victories, have fin­ished in the top five in nine of ten tournaments this season, with the Big East Tournament win being their fifth first-place fmish. Freshman So Hyun Park, ranked No.14 in the country, has led the Irish, her scoring average of 73.12 a program­record; she also recorded two first-place finishes this season. Junior captain Lisa Maunu has contributed three podium fin­ishes, including one first-place finish. Notre Dame head coach Susan Holt attributed the tour­nament victory to the team's consistent success throughout the season. 
"Everything they've done this year has been a momentum builder for this week," Holt said. "They had pressure on them because they were the teani to beat coming in. I was just really proud of them because they really hung in there. It was a good team effort with the way the scoring worked out. They all played a role and we needed all of them to show up and they did." 
The Irish hit the links again May 20 for their final tourna­ment, the NCAA Championship in Albuquerque, New Mexico; the squad earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament through the Big East tourna­ment victory.

"Brntl Lilley had a grnat day, he got hit by a pitch, mad1~ a diving catch in a clutch situation, and had a homor." said Schrage.

Notre Damn broke the game open in tho bottom of the inning with seven runs, chasing Goya from the game. Lilley singled home two runners for his third and fourth RBI on the day, and senior left fielder Ross Brezovsky extended his hitting streak to 17 games with a single. 
With the lead already extended to 8-2. junior first baseman Evan Sharpley hit his team-leading ninth home run of the year with two aboard. Sharpley crushed the first pitch he saw from Cougars junior reliever Patrick Hernandez far over the 380 foot sign in right eenterlield to give the Irish a nine run lead. 
Sophomore outfielder Braden Ashdown added a run to the Notre Dame lead with a solo shot over the left field fenee, the first homer of his career. 
Dupra struck out five and scat­tered seven hits in his seven innings of work, picking up his second win of the season. Sophomore reliever Evan Danieli finished otr the Cougars, striking out four and holding Chicago State

"Brian was able to throw three pitches for strikes, he's really becoming a pitcher," Schrage said of the freshman. "I was really pleased with how Evan Danieli threw the ball the last two innings, he threw with some good velocity and I was very impressed."

"The mental approach of our hitters W<L<;n't that great li1r the ofl'­spend pitches we were facing," Lemire said. "We wnm trying to hit the pitcher's strength instead of waiting f(Jr good pitches." 
Things li~ll apart for the Irish in the seventh, when the Boilermaknrs were abln to string some offense together. Purdue sophomore catcher Jenna Alexander walked to open up the inning and was advanced to sec­ond basn on a sacrifice bunt by sophomore outfielder A'ihley Barr. A single from junior outfielder Christina Trauger into center field scored pinch-runner sophomore second baseman Amy Butcher from second to end the game. 
"Bargar's only downfall was the lead-ofT walk in the seventh," Lemire said.

"It feels great to get a win," Lmnin1 said. 
Tho second game against the Boilennakers started oil' with some much needed ollense, when junior third b<L<>eman Unda Kohan came through once again for the Irish when they needed it most with an HBI in the first inning, scoring Fleury who had singled and stolen seeond base. 
"We have relied on Kohan to come up in the clutch for us all year," Lemire said. "And she came through for us again today." 
The Irish added to the lead in the top of the third when Smith put herself into scoring position by sin­gling and stealing second base. 'l'hlm Laing came to the plate and was able to got an RBI single to plate Smith. 
Freshman Jody Valdivia (8-6) earned the start for the Irish, and responded to the impressive per­formance of Bargar with a strong outing of her own. Valdivia went 
4.2 innings with four hits, an earned run, two walks, and four strikeouts. 
"Valdivia had a great game and kept her pitch-count down," Lemirn said. "She only had a cou­ple walks and we're really proud of her." 

The Boilermakers brought the score back to within one with a solo homerun from junior short­stop Candace Curtis in the third inning. That would be their only run of the game, however, as Bargar came on in relief in the 
fifth. 

Adding an insurance run in the seventh inning was an HBI single from Fleury that brought junior pinch-hitter Stephanie Mola home. That score would hold up, giving the Irish the split. 
Lemire would like to see the team pick up the intensity as the team nears the Big East and NCAA tournaments. 
"Our biggest challenge is to play with the mentality that it is tourna­ment time," Lemire said. "We need to settle into our own and pick up the intensity." 
Thursday's game against Loyola­Chicago that begins at 5 p.m. is fireworks night at Melissa Cook Stadium. The Irish will look to start getting into posl<>eason mode in the double-header.

"Sometimes you get excited, but pros are difl'erent than col­lege," he said. "I wasn't [an emotional! kind of player any­way. I played the same every gamn." 
Dantley, who is responsible for the Nuggets' big men, said the biggest change between coaching and playing is that he has to keep track of the progress of all his players, rather than just worrying 
utes, and the Irish ended the peri­od with a commanding 5-0 lead over the Faleons. 
The Irish improved their lead to seven at the start of the second period when Hoff and Wharton scored.

The match will end the confer­ence season for the Irish and will begin at 12 p.m. at Moose Krause Stadium.

Happy Birthday: Home, family and your own well-being should take top prior­ity this year. If change is necessary, make it happen instead of thinking about it.

ARIES (March 21-April19): You'll be thinking too big and trying to do too much and that will be your downfall today. You have to keep your emotions down and your common sense up in order to finish well whatever you are doing. 3 stars TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Nothing can stop you once you've made up your mind. Take action at home and you will spark others to take part in your plans. Feeling good about your lifestyle and surroundings will make a difference to your morale. 3 stars GEMINI (May 21-Jone 20): Someone will try to take advantage of you. You may be tempted to take an impromptu trip or to delve into something totally dif­ferent. Don't let too much change scatter you. Focus will get you ahead today. 3 stars CANCER (June 21-July 22): Social events, networking or taking on a new hobby should all be at the top of your list but don't do any of the above because someone else wants you to. Do things for your benefit and knowledge. 5 stars LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): There is someone_yon shouldn't trust just waiting to put you in an awkward position. Let others go first for a change. You are far better off knowing what you are dealing with rather than having to do damage control later on. 2 stars VIRGO (Au~. 23-Sept. 22): Home, family and loved ones should all take prior­ity over helpmg someone you aren't close to get ahead. Pull everyone you care about together for a worthwhile activity. Plan an entertaining time that will help build a close bond. 4 stars LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): Temptation is likely to get to you.

Don't let someone you Jove or are trying hard to impress bamboozle you. 4 stars SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Listen to what everyone else says before you share your opinions.
