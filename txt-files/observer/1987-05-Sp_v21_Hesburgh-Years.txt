Editor's note 
"The greatest gift a president can give his students is the example of his life." 
-Theodore Hesburgh 
Today, we take a moment to celebrate a lifetime. 
Father Theodore M. Hesburgh has led Notre Dame in academics and prayer as president and priest. 
His vision of Catholic higher education has been the cornerstone from which the Univer­sity of Notre Dame has grown physically, in­tellectually, and spiritually. 
This issue puts forth a student portrait of Hesburgh's 35 years of leadership as Univer­sity president and as a servant of Christ. 
Being a University president and priest re­quires the help of God and the hands of others. 
"Effective leadership means getting the best people you can find to share the vision and help in achieving it," Hesburgh has said. 
Among those contributing most to Notre Dame's development as a great Catholic uni­versity has been Father Edmund P. Joyce, who has guided many of the financial and ath­letic interests of the University. 
No portrait of Hesburgh would be complete without Joyce's presence. 
Hesburgh often states the students are his primary concern; however, as a dying Tom Dooley wrote to Hesburgh, "Do the students ever appreciate what they have, while they have it?" 
On behalf of students past and present, we hope this special moment shows that indeed we do.

lfesburgh: A Look Back 
page 5 

by Mary Heilmann 
I 
t's been 35 years. Thirty-five years of teaching and building and fundraising and traveling and serving. For 35 years, Father Theodore Martin Hesburgh has been president of the University of Notre Dame. He has guided its growth from 4,979 students in 1952 to 9,600 today. He has watched its endowment skyrocket from $9 million to more than $350 million, its annual operating budget from $9.7 million to $176.6 million. 
He has served four popes--hattan National Bank, the three as permanent Vatican first priest to do so. City representative to the He has traveled more than International Atomic Energy two million miles and visited Agency--and has accepted 14 about 130 countries. He has presidential appointments. received 110 honorary 
He has served in a formal degrees, breaking Herbert diplomatic role for the U.S. Hoover's previous record of government, and has acted as 89, as well as the Medal of a director of the Chase Man-Freedom, the nation's highest award. 
By anyone's standards, Hesburgh will leave behind a highly impressive legacy when he retires as University president on May 17, 1987. 
Yet, when looking back over what he has accom­plished, Hesburgh says, "One always figures that one might have done better or do better given different circum­stances." 
It would be hard to imagine how Hesburgh could have done better for the Univer­sity. When he assumed the presidency as a 35-year-old priest in 1952, Notre Dame was an all-male institution with 389 faculty members and the reputation in some circles as a "football school." When he retires on May 17 of this year, he will leave behind a coeducational institution which has grown by more than 40 campus buildings and has emerged, in his own es­timation, as "one of the really great Catholic univer­sities of the world." 
That is the identity Res­burgh's vision has realized for Notre Dame, and he believes his own identity as a Catholic priest helped him achieve this. "This is a very religious place. Being a priest here is a great asset; it's very easy in a way. I've never wanted to be anything but a priest. I don't want to be anything but a priest today, and I'm delighted I became a priest." 
Hesburgh's roles as Univer­sity president and as priest 
enhance and complement one 
another, allowing him to 
serve in capacities which gain 
recognition for the Church · 
and the University. 
As an educator, Hesburgh 
received 110 honorary 
degrees, which he values 
primarily for the attention 
they have given to Catholic 
education. · 
"The special thing about it was . . . that many of these schools have never really honored Catholics very much, and certainly not Catholic educators. I think this ex­emplifies that we, indeed, are once in a while in our honorary degrees listed as a Catholic or a Catholic educa­tor. When you go down the

so closely with Father Res­
burgh for the last 35 years. 
Weli, obviously it was an inestimable privilege to be in a position where I could share in the vision he had for Notre Dame, be inspired by his un­flagging leadership and then work hand in hand toward the goals which he had set. 
Father Hesburgh's lon­gevity in office, his reputation as America's foremost uni­versity educator, his drafting by presidents and popes for difficult tasks give ample tes­timony to his achievements and I need not elaborate on these. I gather you were more interested in learning from me about the personal, human qualities of the man. 
First and foremost, Father Hesburgh was a priest who never neglected his sacerdo­tal ministry. Daily Mass was a must for him whether in ice-bound Antarctica or the Brazilian jungles. He always had time, patience and under­standing for anyone who came to him with troubles, spiritual or otherwise. 
The most remarkable thing about Father Hesburgh, be­sides his soaring vision, his compassion and his intellect, was the fact that he was un­flappable. I have never seen him unduly perturbed by problems, no matter how intr­icate they may be. His quiet confidence that there had to be a solution had a soothing

Over the years many of our discussions took place at 2:00 or 3:00a.m., when the phones stopped ringing and the stu­dents refrained from climbing the fire escape in the Main Building to his third story of­fice. Some time ago I cut back on these late hours. Not Father Hesburgh! 
No wonder Notre Dame has made great progress with this kind of leadership. I repeat that I have been the most for­tunate of administrators to be such a constant witness of his example. But all members of the Notre Dame family have been his beneficiaries, not the least of whom have been the student body which he dearly loves.

Ivy League and you get a degree from Dartmouth, Har­vard, Yale, Princeton, Colum­bia or Pennsylvania, that's quite a change for the public toward Catholics." 
As a priest, Hesburgh has pioneered involvement in gov­ernment by Catholic cler­gymen, marking another change in public attitude toward Catholics. He was named an ambassador to the 1979 U.N. Conference on Sci­ence and Technology for De­velopment, making him the first Catholic priest to serve in a formal diplomatic role for the U.S. government. He was appointed a charter member of the Civil Rights Commission by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1957, serving as its chairman from 1969 to 1972, when President Richard Nixon asked for his resignation. 
In all of the public service positions Hesburgh has filled, however, his roles as priest and as University president have been his highest priorities. "I turned down some interesting jobs because I didn't think they were com­patible with being a priest or head of a Catholic Univer­sity," Hesburgh has said. 
And although campus legend has it that his speech­giving and board-serving has kept Hesburgh away from Notre Dame virtually all the time, he says this is simply not true. 
"I think I've spent enough time here to do what has to be done," he says. "And a few things besides. I think on balance I spent more than 60 percent of my time on the campus and worked a double shift when I was here. You're getting your money's worth." 
THANKS, FR. TED 
Notre Dame Club 
O£Peoria8 
But perhaps it is inevitable 
in a place like Notre Dame, 
where the ghosts of Knute 

Rockne and George Gipp still 
loom large in campus myth, 
that Hesburgh and his ac­

complishments would assume 
almost legendary stature 
among the students. Having 

lunch with the Pope, traveling 
around the world to China or 

the South Pole, being pictured 
on the cover of Time 
magazine--this is the stuff of 
which legends are made, and 
it is the fabric of Hesburgh's 
life. 

Although Hesburgh has said 
that the legends surrounding 
him "make for amusement 
and good stories," they are 
not something he has tried to 
cultivate. He invites students 
to call him in his office, and 
they do, sometimes at 2 or 3 

in the morning. He says Mass 
in hall chapels all over 
campus, and accepts invita­
tions from professors and 
students alike to speak in 
classes or at meetings. He is 
a university president acces­
sible to the students in a way 
that few other university 
presidents are. 

And judging from the man­ner in which he responds to students, he likes it that way. Whether at a reception follow­ing a dormitory mass or simply walking through the basement of the Administra­tion Building on his way to the office, he stops to talk to everyone. He has been a pres­ident who satisfies the needs of the university with commu­nication and warmth. This personal contact is not merely another part of the Hesburgh legend; it is the reality of the man, constantly made manifest in his actions.

0 nee in a very great while comes an indi­
vidual who will tackle more than his share of world chores. One such person is Father Theodore Hesburgh, whose accomplishments during his 35-year tenure as president of Notre Dame are now legendary. What is not so well-documented, however, are Hesburgh'searly years at Notre Dame, years during which he set the groundwork for his later accomplishments and success. 
Hesburgh's first official contact with the University of Notre Dame came in 1934 when he was a freshman, but he quickly outgrew those gangly shoes and after graduation was chosen to study at the Gregorian Uni­versity in Rome. He went on to Holy Cross College in Washington, D.C. and was ordained a priest in Sacred Heart Church at Notre Dame on June 24, 1943. 
Hesburgh continued his studies in sacred theology at the Catholic University of America and received his doctorate in 1945. 
He returned to Notre Dame to become a "dynamic" reli­gious instructor. At the same time, he served as chaplain to the veterans on campus. His creative exuberance was of­ten let loose--the veterans would tell anyone that "Fat­her Ted" worked long hours of overtime to produce a little happiness. 
He arranged dances with nominal admission charges; then, to keep the young wives from ruining the family budget through dress binges, he gave away prizes for the worst-dressed couples. 
By 1948, he was appointed head of the department of religion. The following year, he was appointed executive vice president of the Univer­

sity under Father John 
Cavanaugh. 
In 1952, Hesburgh was illu­minated from head to toe by the proverbial spotlight. He stepped into the role of presi­dent of the University of Notre Dame at the tender age of 35. He landed running and hasn't slowed down since. 
Hesburgh wanted to es­tablish Notre Dame as a great university, and he took rock hard stances in many controversial settings to achieve this goal. 
He immediately took a very firm and respected stand on the issue of college athletics. His original statements were quoted nationa1ly: "Everyth­ing that is done in inter­scholastic athletics should be done for the good of the boy." He raised the passing stand­ards for athletes to dispel any notions of freeloading and refused all offers for football bowl games because it would rob the athletes of precious scholastic hours. 
During the revamping of the athletic programs he en­countered some rather unus­ual snarls. In October of 1952, Life magazine published a picture of four gap-toothed football players as represen­tative of Notre Dame's foot-

0 ver half of his life has been spent as president of Notre Dame. For nearly two thirds of his life he has been affiliated with the University. University President Father Theodore Hesburgh's distinguished career at Notre Dame is well documented. The events of the Hesburgh Era are indoctrinated into anyone who spends time under the Golden 
Dome. 
Relatively few people, however, know very much about Hesburgh's life before he came to Notre Dame. What kind of childhood did the man whose signature is on over half of all Notre Dame degrees have? 
"I did what everyone else did," says the man himself. "I mean, I went to a lot of dances and parties, had a lot of dates, played sports, altar boys. I think I had a very full social life during that period. In fact, I remember kissing 36 girls the night before I left for the seminary, not that I felt the same about all of them. They were all class­mates," Hesburgh said. 
According to Hesburgh, the only restriction placed on his childhood came from a priest he used to say confession to. "He said you live a perfectly normal life even though you want to be a priest, just don't do anything you'd regret after you become ordained a priest." 
Born before the United States entered World War I, Hesburgh grew up in Syracuse, N.Y. in what his younger sister Betty O'Neill called a "very comfortable, middle class" background.

ball team. Hesburgh was in­furiated. "The thing that burns me up is that Dan Shannon is a good-looking boy and this makes him look like a goon.... They are pillory­ing these boys before the public. It is a misrepresenta­tion in such a way as to make them look horrid." 
When he thought Notre Dame was being "smeared," Hesburgh was always ready to defend his University. 
Hesburgh was also strengthening Notre Dame's intellectual status with a number of reorganizational programs, including revamp­ing the program of liberal studies. His views were respected and published na­tionally. "Modern (1954) liberal education is a melange of disaggregate parts .. . without internal unity ... . The result is a tossed salad." He built his new programs on a foundation of more philoso­phy and theology for better unity. The result: Notre Dame's still existing basic University requirements, copied by other schools 
across the nation. 

The increasingly difficult entrance requirements raised some eyebrows, but Hesburgh had an answer. After hearing him speak "heatedly" about improving the academic quality of the University, and alumnus asked, "What about the ordinary boy? Why can't he find a place at Notre Dame?" 
Retorted Hesburgh "What

Notre Dame." 

"I was very impressed with them, and one of them asked me if I ever thought about becoming a priest, and I said sure, I think about it all the time," Hesburgh said. 
Hesburgh then almost added a few more years to his life at Notre Dame. "(The missionaries and I) went to see my mother, and they said I should come to Notre Dame for high school. In those days, Holy Cross Hall was a minor seminary," he said. Accor­ding to Hesburgh, the mis­sionaries said he might lose his vocation if he didn't go. Hesburgh's mother said if he lost his vocation in a Chris­tian family then he didn't have one for starters. "She said no dice, so I stayed home for high school," he said. 
"I was glad about it. I was in a co-ed high school. I just enjoyed high school," he said. 
O'Neill, who holds three masters degrees and has had six sons graduate from Notre Dame, says education has always been important to the Hesburgh family. Hesburgh's only brother earned a masters degree from the Harvard Business School. "The family has a healthy respect for education. As a family, education means a lot to us," she said. "He encour­aged us in our education. He was always there when you needed it," she said. 
Both of Hesburgh's sisters say they are proud of their brother but a little worried about his retirement. 
"I think (his retirement) is good. He's 70. He's getting on in age. I'm worried a little bit. I don't think he knows how to take care of himself. He doesn't know how to cook, as far as I know. The secretaries have been taking care of him and Father Joyce for so long," said Jackson. 
O'Neill commented on Res­burgh's upcoming cross country trip. "He'll get 10 miles down the road, and decide he made a mistake."

horses had spikes on their 
shoes since they were on the

"Everyone marveled that 
he survived. He said God had 
saved him for a very special 
purpose," said O'Neill. 
Apparently, part of this 

purpose involved becoming a priest. "I never wanted to be anything else," Hesburgh said. "I've never, from the day I started thinking about being something, thought about being anything but a priest." "I just always wanted to be a priest," he

"We never wanted for anyth­

Attending Holy Rosary grade and high schools, Res­·_.-.;... burgh "always had good marks," said another younger sister, Ann Jackson. Although he was "no troublemaker," 
he was sometimes "a 
character," she said. 

Along with an older sister, his two younger sisters and a younger brother, the future president had a "normal childhood, he played with the guys and had a treehouse," said O'Neill. 
Like another president, Hesburgh also has done some acting. "I used to be in plays," said Hesburgh. "I once played Christ in a pas­sion play. Someone asked me what that involved, and I said memorizing half the New Testament. It was an interest­ing experience." 
The young Hesburgh had his share of excitement as well. At age 12, he had a close call with death on a skating trip.

Hesburgh was responsible for Notre Dame filing an ap­plication for its own television station in 1953. He advocated television as the "nearest thing to pioneering in modern American life." And if that was pioneering, Hesburgh was leading the wagon train, with Notre Dame as the head wagon. It was all part of his plan to put Notre Dame in the national spotlight. 
Hesburgh's fame was spreading far beyond the homefront; his personality was in demand across the nation as chairman, commit­tee member and public speaker. A classic introduc­tion to Hesburgh: "He's equally at home explaining the split atom, split T, or split infinitive.'' 
He seemed to play the role of the proverbial Socratic gadfly, constantly reminding a confused nation of its spiri­tual capabilities; certainly not an easy task. During the McCarthy era, Hesburgh was a member of a prestigious civilian group consisting of 30 outstanding Americans ap­pointed to discuss the nation's foreign relations. This group recommended a drastic over­haul of the defense depart­ment, including a $3 billion increase in defense spending during what they described as a time of "great peril."At the same time, Hesburgh was personally reminding the frightened nation that faith "is still our best weapon" in the conflict between democracy and communism. 

A Young Hesburgh 
He warned: "We have no need to have the same num­ber of scientists and tech­nologists as Russia ... The number of such men we need 

is the number this nation can 
use ... If we follow Russia 
we become what we are op­posed to, with no thought of spiritual values." 
While he tried to bring an element of spirituality to public education, he also tried to bring a new element of education to the spiritual, and specifically the Catholic, world. He prodded his Church, saying "We have generally neglected science and have not particularly distinguished ourselves in the humanities either." 
Even while hobnobbing among some of the world's most prominent people, Res­burgh never forgot his stu­dents at home. He remarked once while speaking to a group of students, "I don't get a chance to talk to all of you very often, but you are still my favorite audience and I am fully conscious of my responsiblity for so many Notre Dame students." 
It was a responsibility that he continued to fulfill. during the rest of his presidency, the longest in Notre Dame's his­tory.

Hesburgh the Priest 
Role as priest foremost 
~~~' -: ~-..
in Hesburgh's busy life •, 
by Kevin Becker 

T
he robes he wore were purple, for the Lenten season, and the Mass was the Mass of the Holy Spirit. In a private room off to the side of the Crypt in the basement of Sacred Heart Church, Father Theodore Hesburgh prepared to say his daily Mass as he had done so many times before. 
"May the grace and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all ... And also with you," said Father Hesburgh. 
Today he was to be both celebrant and congregation as he stared forward from behind the altar, flanked only by a window and a radiator. There was little in the chapel besides the altar that filled the center of the room, just as the priesthood has filled Father Hesburgh's life for the past 44 years. 
"I've often felt that my first and main and most important obligation in life is to be a priest, and I'd put that ahead of being president of the University," said Father Hesburgh. 
"If someone came to me tomorrow and said you can be the president of the United States but you have to quit being a priest, I would say 'shove it.' My glory is being a priest," he continued. 
"I confess to Almighty God ..." 

Although he had done it over 15,000 times, in front of large audiences and in solitary places, this Mass was nothing mechanical. 
"I'll be a priest 44 years on June 24, and of all those years, except on Good Friday when you can't say Mass, I've never missed Mass," said Father Hesburgh. "Except one day ... 
"Lord have mercy ..." 
"Lord have mercy ...." 
"Christ have mercy ..." 
"Christ have mercy ..." 

On the only day he missed saying Mass in 44 years, he ''was 
at the hospital all night helping a gal who was having a Caesarian and 1 baptized the child. And I walked by a drinking fountain and without thinking had a drink," he said. Father Hesburgh explained that in those days one had to fast from midnight in order to say Mass, abstaining even from water. 
"A reading from the Holy Gospel ..." 
The chapters from Father Hesburgh's religious life are filled with as many stories of holiness and devotion as the readings for the day. No matter the time or the place, Father Hesburgh is always on call as a priest--to hear confessions, to offer advice, to lend a hand. 
"I'd say a third of my mail every day is cries for help," said Father Hesburgh. "I've saved people from suicides and that sort of thing." 
"May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands ..." 
Father Hesburgh continued to respond to his own prompting, never letting his being alone in prayer affect his enthusiasm for what he was doing. In similar fashion, he has never let being the president of Notre Dame affect his religious station in life. 
"I've never felt that this job gets in the way of being a priest; in fact, it probably enhances being a priest," he said. "I think that if that's the way you feel about it, and I do feel that way about it, it gets reflected in your priorities. 
"If I have a choice to do something as a priest I think is worth doing, I'll do it. It may take a little time or rearranging of schedules, but I'll be there." 
" ... so that from East to West a perfect offering may be made .. . " 
At this point in the benediction, Father Hesburgh looks symbolically to the East and the West, possibly reminiscing about the many places he has been as priest, never failing to say Mass at each every day. From his hotel room in China to the icy tundra of the South Pole, Father Hesburgh has never forgotten to make his "perfect offering" as a priest. 
"I leave you peace, my peace I give you ..." 
Following these words of Christ, Father Hesburgh has sought peace throughout the world during his term as president; he has done so, however, not as politician but as priest. 
"One thing I'm doing as a priest which is fairly unusual is I'm giving a lecture in Moscow to a scientific group at the end of May, after graduation, on religion and science," said Father Hesburgh. "When's the last time the Muscovites have asked a priest to come and lecture on religion and peace?" 
Father Hesburgh administered communion to himself, quietly enjoying his experience with Christ. He is a man who has seen the world and all that it has to offer. Yet ... 
"I'd say that the best experiences I've had in my life have been as a priest," he said. 
"Lord, through this Eucharist send the Holy Spirit of Pentecost into our hearts to keep us always in your love." 
So went the closing prayer of this Mass of the Holy Spirit. And so has gone the life of a man whose career of service to Notre Dame has been a joyful Eucharist. 
Said Father Hesburgh, "If I had one prayer it would be that I die as a priest." This Mass, and Father Hesburgh's tenure as president of the University of Notre Dame, has ended. May he go in peace to love and serve the Lord. 
Kevin Becker is a junior from New Orleans, La. 
Hesburgh and Joyce offer communion during Junior Parents Weekend. In his 44 years as a priest, Hesburgh has missed saying Mass only once.

projects. He also gives final approval for all site selections and architecture. 
Of the many structures which have arisen during the Hesburgh era, one edifice in particular towers above the rest not only in size but in importance to the University. The Notre Dame Memorial Library, completed in 1963 and dedicated the following year, will be named after Hesburgh upon his retire­ment, according to the de­partment of public relations and information. 
"Credit Hesburgh for the vision to build something large enough to meet future needs," said Dedrick. "Res­burgh avoided the temptation to meet temporary goals in 
-
building the library. He had 

the fortitude and foresight to 
build the largest college li­

brary building at that time." 
The improvement in library facilities under Hesburgh represented a giant stride in the academic development of Notre Dame. The old Lemon­nier Library which serves today as the Architecture Building housed 338,238 volumes compared to Memorial's 1.6 million. Usage also increased tenfold. Accor­ding to Hesburgh, "The old library was used by 30,000 students a month. The first month the Memorial Library

Few buildings have had to be removed or demolished during the Hesburgh era. However, two of the more recent examples show that despite the University's com­mitment to renovate the his­toric buildings of the campus, some projects are just not possible. The old Senior Bar was replaced in 1981, and the University Fieldhouse was reduced to commemorative bricks in 1983. Both structures were too unsound to warrant major renovation projects.

f you ask any Notre Dame student to explain the difference between God and University President Father Theodore Res­burgh, the response probably will be the punch line of a popular campus joke. "God is everywhere, and Hesburgh is everywhere but 
Notre Dame." 
There's no doubt the Uni­versity president of a record 35 years has done some ex­tensive traveling. The man has become an airline's dream, a frequent flyer whose itinerary routinely in­cludes cross-continental visits. 
He wrote in a July 2, 1986 journal entry, "Off today for another trip around the world. I have forgotten what number this is, but it has to be at least the seventh or eighth time." 
Those keeping track say that by 1960, Hesburgh had visited virtually every country in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America, each year logging nearly 100,000 miles in trips away from Notre Dame. 
"I first saw Latin America in 1956 and Africa in 1958 by visiting practically every im­portant university in every country where there was one. It was a wonderful introduc­
tion to each continent as I saw them through university eyes for the first time," he said in his 1979 book, ''The Hesburgh Papers: Higher Values in Higher Education." 
Visits to Asia, the Philip­pines, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand and Russia also came as a result of university visits, Hesburgh explained in the book's introduction. 
In the summer of 1986, Res­burgh and companions-­Father Bill Beauchamp, exec­utive vice president-elect; former Ohio governor John Gilligan and his wife, Katie; and alumnus Jack Reilly and his wife, Sarah--took a whirlwind, 17-day trip to the Soviet Union and China, focusing on Moscow and Beijing. 
The group's mission to en­list Russian and Chinese sup­port for Notre Dame's new Institute for International Peace Studies soon will result in a seminar of young Rus­sian, Chinese, American, British, French and Japanese students meeting at Notre Dame to discuss international peace issues. 
On his major trips, Res­burgh often keeps a written account of daily activities, charting his 18-hour days with the detailed precision of a movie camera. 
On July 11, 1986, for exam­ple, Hesburgh wrote in · Siberia, "We haven't had a bit of news since we left home. . . it's been a little too busy this past week and a half to sit around at midnight listening to the BBC. I'm sure the world got along without us during these days." 
Several days later, when the group climbed the 1,171 steps to the top of the Great Wall of China, the weary Res­burgh said he suspected he was "getting into something that might challenge my nor­mal capabilities." 

He and several other hikers, however, managed to complete the rigorous climb, and later took a half a dozen pictures to prove they had made it, "like Edmund Hilary on Mount Everest," the 69­year-old president said.

a well-worn path to Vatican City, where he has served three popes as representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
At the request of Pope Paul VI, Notre Dame in 1972 built and continues to operate an Ecumenical Institute at Tan­tur, Jerusalem. 
Washington, D.C. is another frequent stop for Hesburgh. He was a charter member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and he chaired the commission from 1969 to 1972. President Gerald Ford ap­pointed him a member of the Presidential Clemency Board which decided the fate of various groups of Vietnam offenders.

He describes the hideaway as distracting, "by the beauti­ful, tree-fringed lake out beyond, birds singing, clouds floating, water lap-lapping, and all the rest." Here, Res­burgh collected many of his thoughts for "The Hesburgh Papers."

Hesburgh's traveling days won't end when he turns over the keys later this spring to Father Edward Malloy, president-elect. He and 35­year partner Father Edmund Joyce, executive vice presi­dent, plan to tour the United States in a recreational vehi­cle for six months. 
And in January, the duo will take a three-month cruise aboard the Queen Elizabeth II, where they will serve as ship chaplains. 
According to Notre Dame history books, when Fath~r John Cavanaugh appointed Hesburgh president 35 years ago, he said the young priest was "already off to a running start." Hesburgh, it seems, hasn't stopped running yet.

Hesitant about changing your long distance company? 
It's a big decision. A big step to take. And before you go from the past into the future, there are several things you should know. 
First, not all long distance companies are alike. Some give you good service for a high price. Some give you inexpensive service -and you get what you pay for. And some, like Clark Telecommunications, give you high quality service...affordably. 
Second, some long distance companies use a single type of transmission system. This means that if an emergency happens, your phones are dead. Period. But at CTI, we use a network of diverse systems including fiber optics. In an emergency, they can take over for each other. So your telephone service stays in service. 
Finally, there are only a small handful of long distance companies that can offer you AT&T telephone systems as part of their service. CTI is the only such company in this area. 
That makes what we can do for you unique.

Women at Notre Dame 
page 20 
ND's 'male bastion' gives way to women in 1972 
Hesburgh steers decision for  
undergraduate coeducation  
by Kathy Martin  
T he women of Notre Dame. The phrase still sounds a bit awkward in context of the  
University's 130-year all-male tradition. Every now and then an alumnus knocks on a Lyons or Farley door early on a football Saturday morning to see his old room and still sighs or frowns at the pink carpet or yellow lace cur­tains. Attempts to change the words of the Fight Song to "sons and daughters" are usually booed or laughed at.

Dame had given way. 
Today both Notre Dame men and women cite the un­even ratio of male and female students as the source of most social problems, but the ratio has been narrowed since 1972 from 1 woman to 17 men to 1 woman to 3 men, largely due to Hesburgh's goals to equalize that ratio. The steady rise in women's ad­missions reflects the steady growth in Notre Dame's mis­sion as a true "university," that is, a realistic representa­tion of the complete world outside the college campus. 
The decision for the Univer­sity to admit women, as well as the decision to turn Notre Dame over to a lay board of trustees were, according to Hesburgh, "the two best things I've done in my years here." "Notre Dame, for 125 years, was an all-male society, totally," said Res­burgh. "There were no wo­men professors, no women students, no women adminis­trators. Today it's a totally different picture and it's all happened since 1972, which is

realized it was a better place with the close relationship with Saint Mary's women. Many other schools at the time, like Princeton, Yale, and Harvard, were split on the issue of coeducation but they all went at once. After the student revolution of the 60s and 70s, the vote for coeducation would have been overwhelmingly 'Yes.' There was a tremendous turnaround from the 50s to the 70s." 
On December 1, 1971, Hes­burgh's official announcement that Notre Dame would admit women the next fall followed the news of the failure of the scheduled Notre Dame-Saint Mary's merger. The merger, designed to unify the two schools into one coeducational institution founded by the same religious community, fell through at the last minute after a complete study of the integration of faculty, cur­ricula, and building space. The primary obstacles to the merger were financial and logistical, but Hesburgh said that the decision for coeduca­tion had been made indepen­dent of the merger. "We had bPen through two years of unsuccessful attempts to charm the Saint Mary's Sisters, but in the end we sat down together and I said, 'You want to marry us, but you don't want to take our name or live with us.' The Sisters agreed, and we decided to make Notre Dame coeducational some other way." 
According to Assistant Provost Sister John Miriam Jones, Notre Dame said, "We've decided on the right­ness of coeducation. We'll do it on our own." Jones said the choice for coeducation came also from the male students at Notre Dame. In the Viet­nam era, students were out­spoken and courageous in expressing their views. "This 
was a time in society when men were coming to realize that a more normal mode of education would be men and women living together," she said. "It was really from the male students that the early initiative to admit women to the University came." 
Transitional problems 
It was difficult, however, to foresee the awkward prob­ley were converted to wo­men's halls. 
lems of transition when the women actually arrived on campus. The men of Badin and Walsh resented having their dorms taken away to house the first class of Notre Dame women. Hesburgh replied, "If you want girls on campus you can't put them in tents." Badin and Walsh were chosen on the basis of their size and central location on campus, which would provide more effective protection for

the 365 women. In the first year, men from the North Quad rarely saw a woman student, but a few years later, Breen-Phillips and Far­ 

"I'd seen Notre Dame from 1934 to 1972 as an all-male enclave," said Hesburgh. "If a girl walked between Cavanaugh and Zahm in the early years, it was like feeding time at the Bronx Zoo in the monkey cage. Now, there's a totally different atti­tude, no more whistling and calling." 
"Now it wasn't as if Notre Dame had had no contact with women, though," said Hesburgh. "We'd been living next to Saint Mary's for 125 years. It wasn't like we were out in the woods and women suddenly appeared." 
To alleviate some of the early tension the women stu­dents faced, women adminis­trators were appointed to pay close attention to these prob­lems, like Assistant Provosts Sister John Miriam Jones and Dr. Isabel Charles. They in turn established committees of women students to discuss the problems. 
Many Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students were upset about the two schools goirig their separate ways. Because a large number of Saint Mary's students had Notre Dame majors not of­
fered at Saint Mary's, these 
women were caught in their 
junior and senior years with 
the choice of changing their 
major to one offered at Saint 
Mary's or transferring to 
Notre Dame. In 1972, 200 of 
240 Notre Dame transfer stu­
dents were from Saint 
Mary's, joining 125 freshman 
in the first class of Notre 
Dame women. 
NO males protest 

Some male students protested the breakup of the merger because they would have only 300 Notre Dame women to take courses with, instead of 1500 Saint Mary's women. A student editorial in the Observer read, "That. .. is not coeducation. That is the old game played out by the Ivy League schools--bring enough women here to dress up the place, enough women to continue to attract top ap­plicants who aren't interested in a monastic type life, enough women so that the Justice Department can't sue the University for discrimina­tion on the basis of sex."

Another 1971 student, Ted Price, complained that wo­men should not be admitted at all because they would compete with Notre Dame men in the job market. "Women will have a detri­mental effect...and lessen our chances of securing a job," he wrote. 
Women's early difficulties 
Jones, advisor and friend to the first group of women, witnessed the difficulties they faced at first. They assumed that since Notre Dame was open to them, Notre Dame was psychologically prepared for them. Some never ex­pected to be such pioneers, to find television microphones stuck in their faces in their first week here, and to face some discrimination as a minority among 6, ooo male students. 
'' Some of the women just didn't make the connection as to the trail-blazing that was going to be imposed upon 
them. '' 
Sister Jones 
Also burdensome were some of the chauvinistic no­tions that stereotyped women as bodies instead of brains. In the early years, the men would often whistle whenever there was a woman around because it was so rare. Jackie Bollas, one of the early female valedictorians, said at the ten-year anniversary of the admittance of women that many men wouldn't date a smarter girl. 
Jones saw changes for the 
better and felt the tense 
transitional period ease after 
the first five years, and she 
said in the tenth year, the 
group of women at Notre 
Dame was large enough to 
feel they had a real identity 
on campus. 
ND women graduate 
Although their three or four years at Notre Dame may not have been smooth, many of the women graduates from the early years of coeducation feel that Notre Dame prepared them well for a dominantly male professional world. Jones called the Uni­versity "a training ground for what society is still like. Hap­pily, it's changing, but there's still a bit of adjustment that needs to be made." 
Dr. Alice Harrington graduated from Notre Dame in 1975 and is now a pediatrician in Valparaiso, Indiana. She transferred into Notre Dame her sophomore year from Marquette be­cause, like many of the first women students, her father and brother had attended Notre Dame. "A lot of us transfers felt weirder about being there than the Saint Mary's women and freshman who had had an orientation session," she said. "But the men were excited and curious for the most part about having us there." The only negative experience she remembered was with her

group of pre-med majors. "There was some hostility toward me when it came time to apply to med schools," she said. "Some of the men said I would get into med school before them just because I was a woman and there weren't many women in med schools then." 
Harrington's Notre Dame experience was helpful, though, in preparing her for the medical profession. As the only woman in a chemistry lab of 20 students at Notre Dame, she found a propor­tionally higher number of women in her medical school classes than at Notre Dame. 
Elizabeth McGregor, pro­duction manager at General Mills in West Chicago, is an­other 1975 graduate who believed that Notre Dame "really made the difference" in her career success. She'" spent her freshman year at Saint Mary's and transferred into Notre Dame after the merger fell through. There were only two women in her Finance program at the time, but it wasn't too difficult for them, according to McGregor. 
Notre Dame prepared McGregor in a concrete way for her position with General Mills. She is the highest­ranking woman in her divi­sion, and supervises mostly middle-aged men. "I felt like a pioneer even after I graduated," she said. "I truly believe that the training I had at Notre Dame, getting used to living and working in a

Notre Dame is currently attempting to increase housing for women students in order to narrow the gap

between the number of wo­men who apply each year to Notre Dame and the number who are admitted. In 1984, Admissions Director Kevin Rooney described the admis­sions process as two separate application pools: one for women and one for men. "I can say that we are denying admission to some women with strong credentials," he said. Currently, only 28 per­cent of each freshman class is reserved for women stu­dents, but the number of qualified women in the total applicant pool ranges from 35 to 40 percent. 
Future for ND women 
Change cannot be expected overnight, but Hesburgh has initiated and witnessed a great amount of growth at Notre Dame. Due to his com­mitment to equalize the ratio of women to men, the Univer­sity has constantly sought more women in the faculty and administration, as well as the students. 
Hesburgh would like to see women on campus today take more initiative in effecting

change. "I get upset when I see political groups vying for class office that don't have any women on them at all," said Hesburgh. "No woman has ever run for Student Body President. Women have to participate as fully as they can. But I can't order women to run for office and to partic­ipate .... I would just invite and welcome women to take full part in the place. That is the official attitude, if you will." 
The conversion of Howard into a women's hall and the construction of two new wo­men's dorms will increase women's admissions to 37 percent of the total applicant pool. According to Jones, Notre Dame has committed itself to a "balancing act" in the redistribution of the num­ber of class spaces available for men and women appli­cants. "When we built Pasquerilla East and West, we admitted 500 extra stu­dents, all women. That was a black and white decision," said Jones. But with the two new dorms, the balancing act is founded on a "replacement theory": Notre Dame will be accepting 600 more women and cutting 600 men. 
Hesburgh had envisioned no particular ratio goal of wo­men to men at Notre Dame, only a more natural propor­tion. "I never put through an increase in our women enroll­ment without consulting Saint Mary's," he said. "We've grown together; we don't want to hurt their enrollment in any way. Now we're at the point that within four years, the total ratio of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's women stu­dents combined will be 50 percent. We have to consider the whole community, and any excess of 50 percent would cause problems." 
In 16 years of coeducation, Notre Dame has experienced a steady growth toward nor­malization of the male-female ratio and relationship. Jones believes it is time to lay to rest discussions on the women of Notre Dame. 
Hesburgh agrees that the situation of women at the University should be put into perspective of American soci­ety. "Notre Dame is a part of the world in which it lives and you can't change that. But I think Notre Dame can provide a wonderful experi­ence of men and women working equally toward the same endeavors and com­plementing each other in

what they bring to bear upon the quality of life on this campus." The women of Notre Dame have evolved from a novelty on campus to partners with men in learning and achievement. Stereotypes between the sexesstill are cited as a social problem at the University, but they are a social problem of society it­self, and not unique to Notre Dame. Living and working together, men and women increase their sensitivity to each other's situation and benefit from each other's collective and individual in­sights. 
Hesburgh said he could recall spending most of his life in what might be called male societies. "I've lived in both worlds," he said. "I've 
.. 
seen Notre Dame as an all­male society from '34 to '72 and as growing more and more coeducational from '72 to '87. I think the latter reality is vastly superior. Notre Dame is much more like a family place, a relaxed place." 
Maybe the phrase "the wo­men of Notre Dame" is growing as outdated as "the men of Notre Dame."

Joyce: Hesburgh's 'silent partner' 
by Marty Strasen 

o those familiar with the Notre Dame 
administration, Father Edmund Joyce is known and respected as the man who probably has had more to do with Notre·name athletics 
than any other. 

To those who are not so familiar, the University's executive vice president and treasurer is known as the quiet, number-two man to Father Theodore Hesburgh. Sometimes he is even called the "silent partner," most often by people who do not realize that Joyce just does his noise-making in the shadows, and that he likes it that way. 
"I really don't look for publicity and I never have," says Joyce, who has remained somewhat of a mystery to many even after some 35 years in the Hesburgh admin­istration. 
What he did look for, espe­cially at the beginning of his stint at the controls of both Notre Dame's finances and the most closely-watched ath­letic program in the nation, was an opportunity to work with students. He had in­tended to live in the dor­mitories and deal directly with Notre Dame students, but was instead called on to handle "part-time" duties in the business office under Fa­ther John Cavanaugh's admin­istration. 
Just six months after his ordination, in late 1949, Joyce was suddenly the acting vice president of the same college he graduated from in 1937 with a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting. Joyce's part-time work was impres­sive enough to make him a valuable asset to a new ad­ministration. 
He had expected to study for two years at Oxford after his part-time role in the Ad­ministration Building, but Father John Burke, who held down the business side of Notre Dame under Cavanaugh, fell terminally ill. Joyce's stay at Oxford was cut short. 
The Hesburgh era was about to begin. 
Or is that the Joyce era? 
"When I decided to become a priest," Joyce says, "I really was looking forward to spending 20 or 30 years in student halls, being a coun­selor to students and teach­ing. The reason I had such a driving ambition to do that is because I went through here as a regular student, and I could see what an impact a good priest could have on a 
young person who is just reaching maturity. 
"That's what I really wanted to do. It's kind of ironic that I've not been able to do that at all. You have to see yourself as being in the hands of the Lord, accept your assignments in life, and carry them out to the best of your ability. It's not really that surprising that the Uni­versity selected someone with my background in finance and with a CPA for the job. I guess I just never expected it at the time." 
But what Joyce has missed in close contact with students, he has made up for in his dedication to keeping the Notre Dame budget in the black for all but one year in the three and a half decades he has held the job as Res­burgh's second-in-command. 
Perhaps even more notably, Joyce has kept Notre Dame

on the right path in the face of growing college athletics. While many other schools were having trouble handling the transformation of college sports into an unpredictable realm more like that of big business, as evidenced by scandals ranging from drugs to point-shaving to academic complacency, Joyce and the 

"That has helped keep it honest over the years, and I give that advice to a lot of other schools. I really think we at Notre Dame have been a beacon for the rest of the country. I think we have proven better than any other institution that you can com­bine serious academics and a successful athletic program." 
To back up his convictions, Joyce appointed Mike DeCic­
"We do get along well," Joyce says. "As he would say, he's quite a liberal and I'm more conservative. My back­ground is really in finance, and I really have to watch very carefully over our finan­cial assets and our growth, keeping the budgets balanced, building the buildings and so on. 
"That takes up a good part of my life, and he depended upon me enough and had enough confidence in me so that we really work in sepa­rate areas, where I handle most of the practicalities and he can handle the vision of making Notre Dame a great university." 
But those days are rapidly coming to an end. Soon Hes­burgh and Joyce will be traveling the world and leaving behind the troubles of keeping Notre Dame on its feet. 
Perhaps Joyce will finally get his chance to work more closely with the students--the task he wanted to take on in the first place. 
Or perhaps that will be put on hold again. "I've always had a lot of contact with the people be-

I am willing to admit that I would not have made it during all of those years without his ever­present and highly unselfish help. He was strong in all of those areas where I was either weak or not all that interested. He has supervised budgets, investments, finan­cial and legal affairs, building programs, development mat­ters, and athletics inter alia. 
Just one indication of his important role here: During the past year, he has been much involved in bringing to the University the more than $20 million needed to build two new women's dor­mitories, renovate the LaFor­tune Student Center and do some other things we will be announcing in the fu­ture.

eing fired is one of the more interesting things University President Father Theodore Hesburgh has had happen to him. Hesburgh was appointed as a charter member of the Civil Rights Commission in 1957 by President Dwight Eisenhower. Hesburghserved as chairman from 1969 to 1972 when President Richard Nixon replaced him after the administration came under considerable fire from the commission. He had served for 15 years in what was probably the second biggest job he's had next to being president of the 
University. 
A burr in the saddle 
Hesburgh often described the commission as a "burr in the saddle " of the president and the government. 
Before the commission was formed in 1957, no federal civil rights legislation had been passed. But the commis­sion, with Hesburgh as its chairman, succeeded in pass­ing a great deal of legislation. Despite the fact the commis­sion had no formal power, it managed to get 80 percent of the legislation it suggested passed by Congress into law as of a year before Res­burgh's resignation. 
Shortly after his resigna­tion, Hesburgh wrote that the purpose of the commission was to "ascertain, through study and hearings, what the actual situation was regard­ing deprivation of voting and other rights, and then suggest possible solutions to the Pres­ident and Congress." 
The commission was so successful in the early 1960's

that Southern senators at­tempted to kill the committee by cutting off its funding, according to a Chicago news­paper at the time. The com­mission concentrated on ra­cial conditions in the Deep South, holding hearings to discuss job discrimination, denial of the right to vote, and other issues. Information gathered at these hearings was used when devising the provisions for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
The commission could sub­poena witnesses, but it had no enforcement powers. Hes­burgh said the commission's real power was publicity power. It could bring injus­tices to light and make sug­gestions on how they should be remedied. 
Hesburgh emphasized the independence of the commis­sion which enabled it to act objectively because it had "no axe to grind." 
The commission was com­posed of three Republican members, three Democrats, and Hesburgh, the indepen­dent.

equality of opportunity to vote--the commission proposals that became federal law gained millions of black citizens, for the first time, the right to vote," Res­burgh wrote in 1973. 
"One of our most satisfying victories was the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which completely eliminated Jim Crow prac­tices sanctioned by law and practice for more than 200 years," Hesburgh added. "Overnight this removed a daily series of insults of the human dignity of millions of Americans." 
In 1971, Hesburgh said the independence of the commit­tee was important because minorities still did not have enough power to obtain a decent political compromise on many issues. He said mon­itoring was also very impor­tant at that time because there were so many federal agencies with civil rights responsibilites. 
Clashing with Nixon 
Hesburgh was not afraid to go head-to-head with the ad­ministration. He attacked administration proposals and testified before congressional committees. In October of 1970, the commission issued a broad report which con­demned many federal agencies for not following civil rights statutes them­selves.

clash with the administration. Nixon aides would attack the commission for disloyalty to the government, but they were careful not to attack Hesburgh himself because he was a priest. His religious, non-partisan voice was per­ceived to be objective, and it had to be assumed that his voice was a voice of morality, and to directly dispute his statements would not make one look very good. 
Upon re-election in 1972, Nixon asked for pro-forma resignation letters from most of the higher officials in the government, and Hesburgh complied with the request just as did other officials and the rest of the commission members. But the country was shocked when Res­burgh's letter was actually accepted. 
The administration first claimed that Hesburgh had resigned of his own volition, but after denials by Res­burgh, the administration admitted that it had asked for his resignation. 
The commission today 
Hesburgh approved of his first successor as chairman. "But once he got out, things went downhill really fast." 
Hesburgh's opinion of today's Civil Rights Commis­sion is rather low. "The com­mission has been totally politicized," he said. He sug­gested scrapping the whole commission, saying it would be easier to start over again than try to salvage the cur-

"Today's commission is completely a voice-piece of the administration," said Hesburgh. "It is no longer a conscience for the Congress." 
Apartheid and divestment 
Hesburgh's concern about human rights extends beyond the civil rights of the people in this country. 
Hesburgh said he was working against apartheid as far back as 1958.

ather Ted has a "pas­sion" for ministry. That is why at an early age he decided to come to Notre Dame and enter the Congregation of Holy Cross to become a priest. After his ordination he was as­signed here and from that moment until this very day he has generously served our faith community on campus. 
He very much identified ministry with his vocation as a Holy Cross priest. He once wrote some reflec­tions on his priesthood: 
"I never wanted to be anything but a priest which is in itself a great and un­earned grace. I hope to live and die a priest, noth­ing more and nothing less." 
He has dedicated himself in a most generous way to sacramental ministry. Several generations now can proudly testify to Fa-

ther Ted's celebrating key moments in their lives, es­pecially weddings and bap­tisms. 
In order to be an effec­tive priest a person has to possess a good relationship with God through prayer. 
Those of us who know him well can testify to his dedication to prayer. Daily he celebrates the Euc­harist, prays his breviary, and recites the rosary. He has always had a deep love and affection for Our Lady and has surely placed many a care in her loving hands at the Grotto. 
Father Ted has also been known by many to be a man of "availability" to anyone who sought his ad­vice on a personal or moral problem. He listens compassionately and offers supportive direction. 
We are so grateful to God for these many years of ministry which Father Ted has given our campus. His retirement as presi­dent, however, is not the end of his ministry at Notre Dame. After a well-earned sabbatical year he will return and continue his ministry among us. The younger generation will certainly seek him out to share the wisdom that a faithful life has to offer. 
On this occasion we pause to respect Father Ted's dedication to mini­stry and to his vocation. He answered his call from God decisively and generously and still con­tinues to do so everyday. This is a great example for all of us in the church but especially for the young who are seeking their own call from the Lord. Thanks so much, Father Ted, and we look forward to many many more years of your ministry on our campus.

worse off today then when the sanctions started. 
"Now, I don't want to make apartheid worse than it is," but apartheid has been wor­sened by what has been done so far, said Hesburgh. 
"I think students generally have been sold a bill of goods­-that's all over, not just here," he said. "All I'm saying is you should do something be­cause morally you think it's the right thing to do. And morally I don't think it's right to do something you think is going to worsen the situation you are against and are trying to clean up," he said. 
"I think it's better to stay put and to use leverage on the companies rather than just force them out,'' Hes­burgh added.

Hesburgh has had 'record' career 
by Joe Bucolo 
W
hen people think of Father Theodore Hes­burgh, they often reflect on his outstanding job as pres­ident of Notre Dame or his superb books and articles. One of Hesburgh's most impressive accomplish­ments, however, is often overlooked: Hesburgh is listed in "The Guinness Book of World Records" for receiving a largest number of honorary degrees. 
To Hesburgh, though, this record is "no big deal. All those degrees and a quarter gets you a cup of coffee." 
In 1954, Hesburgh received his first honorary degree. It was bestowed upon him by LeMoyne Col­lege in Syracuse, New York. In the following two years, Hesburgh received two more degrees (one each year) from Bradley University in Peoria, Illi­nois and Catholic Univer­sity of Santiago in Chile. 
As the years progressed, Hesburgh began to accum­ulate more and more honorary degrees. By 1960, he had received a total of 

six degrees, more than 
most people acquire in a 
lifetime. These degrees 
began to bring nationwide 
fame to him, but that was 
only the beginning. 
Between 1960 and 1970, 
Hesburgh received 25 more 
degrees bringing his total 
up to 31. These awards 
were granted from Prince­
ton, Northwestern, Indiana 
University, University of 
Illinois, Valparaiso, and 
Michigan State. Hesburgh 
received his honorary 
degree from St. Mary's 
College in 1969. 
By 1980, Hesburgh had 
received a total of 69 
degrees. In the ten years 
between 1970 and 1980 
alone, Hesburgh received 38 degrees, more than he had achieved in the previ­ous sixteen years. Among . the institutions bestowing these awards were Loyola, Yale, Syracuse, Harvard, 
and Georgetown. 
The early 1980s added 
more degrees to Hesburgh 
tally. In 1980 and 1981, Hes­
burgh received seven and 
nine degrees (respectively) 
bringing his total to 85. At 
that time, Herbert Hoover

held the world record with 89 degrees; however, Hes­burgh received eight more degrees in 1982, bringing his total to 93 and breaking the record. 
Hesburgh's record-. breaking award was given to him from Hahnemann Medical College and Hospi­tal in Philadelphia. Pres­ently, Hesburgh has a col­lection of 111 honorary degrees. The awards received during the 1980s were from such institutions as the College of William and Mary, Tuskegee, New York University, and Duke. 
Twelve of Hesburgh's degrees are from foreign institutions. In 1956, he received his first foreign award from the Catholic University of Santiago in Chile. 
In 1983 Hesburgh earned a degree from Ramkham­haeng University in Bangkok, Thailand. His most recent foreign degree was received in 1985 from St. Thomas University in New Brunswick.

human situation is probably going to transcend the logic, and it could well be that everybody will pull out," he said. 
"I wouldn't get excited about that. At least not yet. I would get excited though if it makes the situation worse. I'd hate to do that consciously." 
Justice and peace 

Hesburgh has been involved in a private initiative which is attempting to bring internationally-known scien­tists and world religious leaders together to condemn nuclear weapons. 
Two years ago, Hesburgh established the Institute for International Peace Studies. The Soviet Union recently agreed to send three students to participate in a year-long post-graduate peace studies program sponsored by the peace institute. 
In 1968, Hesburgh estab­lished an institute which would later be renamed the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies when John L. and Helen Kellogg donated $10 million to the University in 1979. Part of the grant money was to be used for five endowed professor-
Best Wishes 
ships, for symposia, research 
and publications, and visiting 
scholars. 

Hesburgh emphasized that when he returns to the Uni­versity after his year away, he will stay on as a helper with the peace institute and the Helen Kellogg Institute. 

A new sort of ROTC 
Hesburgh recently proposed a Peace Corps program modeled on the Reserve Offi­cer Training Corps. "My as­sumption is that there are other tens of thousands of high school graduates who would compete for the same educational opportunity to volunteer for four years of service overseas to the least fortunate of human kind in the Peace Corps," he said last semester. "Young Americans need this alternate opportunity." 
Instead of taking military science courses, students would study the language and culture of the country in which they would be working. In the summer, instead of going to military duty, stu­dents would do service work in the poor areas of this country.

of the rectors. "Many were getting pretty old and many were looking at students as there for their convenience. We wanted to start off with strong campus leaders," said Hesburgh. 
The University President said the scholarship program at Notre Dame began with the revenue from the first bowl game the football team played. "We took all the money from the first Cotton Bowl and established scholar­ships for blacks and other minorities," Hesburgh said. 
Throughout his presidency Hesburgh has confronted many issues which affect students and campus life. One such issue was addressed on Nov. 8, 1967, when Hesburgh said no parietals, or visitation hours between members of the opposite sex in dor­mitories, would be granted at Notre Dame. "I have no stomach for laws and rules which don't mean anything," he said. "And the laws and rules which we have should be enforced," Hesburgh said. 
"I am aware of the position of the Board of Trustees on the matter of parietal hours, and I'm sure that parietal hours will not be allowed." The University's reason for not allowing women in the then all-male dorms stemmed primarily from the social repercussions of entertaining a woman in a bedroom. 
Parietal hours were in­stituted and subsequently expanded at Notre Dame a few years after Hesburgh made the statement. 
Other important actions instituted during Hesburgh's presidency were: 
The construction of the Memorial Library. Hesburgh cited the action as the most important, significant project on the campus. "We began (to build the Library) in 1960 without a nickel and it was paid for when we dedicated it in 1964," Hesburgh said. 
The establishment of the 15-minute rule in 1969. In an eight-page letter to the stu­dent body, Father Hesburgh specifically explained the steps which would be enacted against "anyone or any group that substitutes force for rational persuasion, be it violent or non-violent." 
The letter said such a group "will be given 15 miriutes of meditation to cease and desist. . . . If they do not within that time period cease and desist, they will be asked for their identity cards. Those who produce these will be suspended from this commu­nity as not understanding what this community is. 
"Those who do not have or will not produce identity cards will be assumed not to be members of the commu­nity and will be charged with trespassing and disturbing the peace on private property and treated accordingly by law," Hesburgh wrote, in response to student protests of U.S. involvement in Viet­nam. 
"Without being melodramatic," Hesburgh wrote, "if this conviction makes this my last will and testament to Notre Dame, so be it." 
The cessation of the at­tempted merger between Notre Dame and Saint Mary's in 1971. On Nov. 31 of that year the two schools officially announced that "it is not possible to accomplish com­plete unification at this time." The joint statement included the announcement that Notre Dame would begin admitting female undergradu­ates for the 1972-1973 school year. 

The establishment of the new alcohol policy in 1984. Released April 16, the new policy, set by the Committee on the Responsible Use of Alcohol, eliminated parties and happy hours in dorm rooms as well as prohibited underage students from at­tending parties in hall social space where alcohol is served. 
Recalling the first decade of his presidency, Hesburgh said "from '52 to '62 it was during the Eisenhower years. It was kind of quiet." He added that several of his appointments to national and international commissions occurred during that time. "In '54 I was appointed to the National Science Board. I 
learned an awful lot about 
science," he said. "We 
started with next to no money 
and today the National Sci­
ence Board has over $600 
million. It was an exciting 
time," said Hesburgh. 
"Up till today I have had 14 presidential appointments, all approved by the Senate," Hesburgh said. Among other honors, Hesburgh served as representative to the Vatican of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In 1960, he was the first Catholic priest to serve on the Rockefeller Foundation Board of Trus­tees. 
In 1953, Hesburgh started one of Notre Dame's myriad traditions: Junior Parents' Weekend. "(The administra­tion's) public relations people did the planning, then the students took over and I think they did a better job. After all, it's their thing," he said. "From '52 to '68 I was at all the class dances, I never

Joyce discusses football success, SMU probation and Title IX 
Excerpts from an interview with Father Edmund Joyce conducted by Dennis Corrigan and Marty Strasen. 
Q: When you first took over, what did you think of the balance between athletics and academics? 
A: "A lot of people thought Father Hesburgh and I changed things but that's not really true at all. I think Notre Dame always ran the kind of program where they kept their priorities straight. I think academics was always number one in my long expe­rience, and my experience with Notre Dame goes back 54 years. 
"I arrived here in 1933 as a freshman and I graduated in 1937 and all the athletes who were here graduated then, even though the academic restrictions at that time were tougher than they were later. 
"It might come as a surprise to you, but in those years 70 was the passing grade. And we required the athletes, in order to be eligi­ble, to have a 77 average. They needed that just to be able to play. We moved away from that when they changed the whole marking system from percentages and got into the one, two, three and four. Finally, we decided that didn't make any sense any longer, and said that as long as they weren't on academic

ble. 

Q: Was it more a matter of changing people's perception of Notre Dame as a football factory? 
A: "I think the perception always came from the fact that we were always so sue-was here, of course, we won four straight National Cham­pionships and had four straight undefeated years. Maybe it was in those years, right after the war, that the publicity arose because most of what you heard about Notre Dame was because of the success of the football 
"Obviously it was a mis­taken perception, but there wasn't much you could do about it. So any time you met somebody and said you were from Notre Dame, why they'd want to start talking about the football team. But that's still true to some extent. 
"Let me explain that 70-77 thing for you. You had to have a 77 average in order to graduate from Notre Dame. Anybody who made 70 was in good standing, but every stu­

had to have a 77. This, again, shows the priority given to academics by our ancestors. They insisted that the athletes had 77 all the way through to make darn sure they were going to graduate. 
"Here you have the origin of our marvelous record in graduation. The pressure was on in those years to make sure those kids graduated. That was the reason for the 77.

continuedfrom page 35 
Q: Is Notre Dame that unique in that yourself, the chairman of the faculty board, has a whole lot more control in the athletics than at any other school? 
A: "If I had to pinpoint why I think Notre Dame has been able to operate a pro­gram that has always had the highest kind of integrity, the main reason for that is that the responsibility has been placed in a very high level in the University administration. By that I mean that it has al­ways been placed on the exec­utive vice president. That is something we adhere to but nothing that we started. 
"Having somebody at that high a level actually watching over the program I think has helped keep it honest over these years. I give this advice to a lot of other schools, be­cause I'm afraid that at a lot of other schools, especially the big state schools, the presidents can't pay a lot of personal attention to athletics because they have a lot of other problems of more im­portance. Sometimes the ath­letic department then operates in a vacuum, with­out anybody reporting to anybody." 
Q: What was it like when Title IX came in? How did you have to sit back and re­evaluate? 
A: "We were just beginning to be co-ed at the time, and we weren't caught up in any kind of friction or anything. We had very few co-eds, we were just getting started and it was always our intention to give the women here as many athletic opportunities as the men had. I got involved in many debates at that time because the bureaucracy in Washington was proposing some God-awful guidelines that made no sense at all. 
"One of the guidelines that 
was being put out by the De­
partment of Health, Educa­
tion and Welfare was that if 
you gave 95 scholarships to 
men football players, you 
should give 95 scholarships to 
women athletes. This is just . absolutely asinine. 
Q: What do you think of the situation where SMU was finally seriously punished recently after it seemed they were always getting away with a slap on the wrist? 
A: "I think it conveys a very strong message to other schools--and there may be others out there like SMU which haven't been exactly honest in their programs. Certainly no one would like that to happen to them, so if they are doing illegal things like buying players and what have you, I hope they'll all clean up their act pretty quickly." 
Q: Do you think Notre Dame should consider not playing teams who have been known to have these prob­lems? 
A: "Father Hesburgh has said that from time to time, and it's true that we would not want to play an outlawed team--one that we were cer­tain was cheating but you never know that really. Then the question comes up: What about a team like Southern Cal, who was on probation for whatever they did wrong? Do you drop them? 

"Well, there are several problems. You have a con­tractual relationship with them that's involving millions of dollars and you wouldn't want to drop them carelessly. Some of the things they are guilty of might be Mickey Mouse while others might be more serious. 
"What makes this most

difficult is the fact that you

you have a contract with for 
maybe a 10-year period. If 
you cut them off now and say 
you're not going to pick them 
up again, by that time they're 
probably going to be the most 
honest team in football. 
They're going to turn around. 
"So from a practical point of view, it would be a very difficult thing simply to stop playing. Each time this hap­pens generally the president doesn't know about it, people in authority haven't known about it--it's been something that's happened behind their backs because some over­enthusiastic alumnus has given money under the table to some of these kids or whatever else has happened. You can't blame the whole university. If they turn things around, you have to be proud of them."

Father Hesburgh always 
tells the story about his introductory press confer­ence back in 1953 when the photographers asked him to hike a football through his legs. He refused--not because he didn't think athletics played an impor­tant role at the University, but because he didn't want to give the impression that football was the only area of importance here. He has always made sure that everyone at Notre Dame-­faculty, staff, coaches, ath­letes and students--understood where sports fit into the scheme of things. 
The University has a well-deserved reputation developed over many years for its handling of athletics, and there's no question Fa­ther Hesburgh deserves the credit for maintaining the philosophy that called for the high standards under which all our sports are conducted. He always insisted that ath-

dent, Father Hesburgh held the position of chairman of the Faculty Board in Control of Athletics during his tenure as executive vice-president-­so there's no question he's well acquainted with the ath­letic realm. He doesn't have to make every football road trip with us, or see every other event, and yet you get the distinct impression that he always has a great feel for what's happening with our athletes and teams. I think he has taken great pride in the fact that he has had a man working with him all these years--Father Joyce--who loves athletics and shares the same pride in the integrity and values of our program. Even though Father Joyce is the man I work with on a day-to-day basis concerning athletic matters, I still send Father Hesburgh the annual report on our athletic pro­gram, with evaluations of each program and coach. Each time I receive a letter back from him with com­ments about our teams and seasons. I can assure you that both Father Hesburgh and Father Joyce lead the nation in respect earned from presi­dents and athletic directors of

Anytime we hire new coaches Father Hesburgh al­ways enjoys getting a chance to visit with them. He will tell them, "You won't find me or anyone else in the Univer­sity's administration coming to your office and demanding that you win so many games or matches. We aren't here to meddle in your program. Over the long haul, we think the elements are here so that you'll be able to win more than you will lose. But the only time you'll hear from me is if you get caught doing something wrong, or breaking NCAA rules. Then you'll be on the next flight out of town." 
I've only been here for six 
years, but I can't tell you how 
much I've enjoyed working 
with both Father Hesburgh 
and Father Joyce. They're 
both great fans, yet no one 
keeps everything in perspec­
tive better than they do. I 
think, in light of some of the 
problems we see in college 
athletics today, it's reassur­
ing to know that we have 
people like them who have 
exhibited such leadership and 
integrity in the area of inter­
collegiate athletics.

ather Edward "Monk" Malloy settled back in his chair and smiled. "I don't think pressure is the right word," said Malloy. "I feel excited about what I see as a challenge. 
"I'm not sitting around looking over my shoulder or excessively fearful." 
Following commencement, Malloy will succeed Father Theodore Hesburgh, who is retiring after 35 years as president of Notre Dame. 

"You know, with a lot of these things, the expectation is harder to deal with than the reality," said Malloy, who served as associate provost and associate professor of theology before his election. "It's like getting ready for the big game." 
Since his election on Nov. 14, Malloy said he's spent most of his time speaking with groups, talking to reporters and consulting with administrators, faculty and students. 
"I'm not suffering from sloth," said Malloy, who got his nickname "Monk" as a child. 
The 45-year-old native of Washington, D.C., was elected the University's 16th president by the Board of Trustees. 

On the recommendation of Malloy, the board also elected Father William Beauchamp as executive vice president. Beauchamp, currently ser­ving as executive assistant to Hesburgh, will succeed Fa­ther Edmund Joyce. 
Malloy and Beauchamp will serve five-year renewable terms. 
"I really feel confident about the people in the ad­ministration," said Malloy, who will be officially in­augurated on Sept. 23. "I think it's a good working team." 

At the news conference called to announce his selec­tion, Malloy said, "No one can replace Father Hesburgh, nor do I intend to try. 
"But together, together with the administration, together with the trustees, together with my fellow brothers and priests in Holy Cross, we can continue to build on the legacy of these last 35 years." 
As president, Malloy said he will continue with many of 
the directions that have already been started. 
"It is clear to me that Notre Dame needs to be a major graduate research in­stitution," said Malloy, add­ing that capable faculty must be attracted to accomplish this. 
Malloy, who holds under­graduate and graduate degrees from Notre Dame, said he also wants to continue the "established legacy of high-quality undergraduate education." 
And like every university, he said, Notre Dame will con­tinue its struggle to maintain a balance between research and teaching. 
In addition, Malloy said he hoped to continue Notre Dame's tradition of residen­tiality by attracting high­quality dormitory staffs.

addresses and public repre­sentation. 
A second quality that I have always admired in Ted Hesburgh is his intellectual curiosity and youthful spirit. He is one of the most well­read people I know, and that includes a whole range of academics who have less of a record of social activism and administrative responsibility. In the course of his life he has been willing to change his mind on the basis of new evidence or more persuasive arguments. He is accustomed to absorbing quickly the central elements of an issue. This has served him well when Presidents and Popes have asked him to participate in study groups covering matters for which he had no professional training. He is a theologian comfortable in discussing immigration reform, the space program, nuclear deterrence strategy and world hunger. And al­ways he has brought a partic­ular set of values to the dis­cussion which has forced the formulators of public policy to a heightened sense of con­science. 
Finally there is the human dimension of the man. Well known as an inveterate world traveler, he also enjoys quietly fishing for b~ss, pike and muskies in far northern retreats. He smokes cigars (except during Lent), some­times to the consternation of his meal-time guests. A raconteur, adept with the media, accustomed to public recognition, he seldom com­plains about the price he has paid in lost sleep, meals taken on the run, ill-directed criticism, and the emotional pounding that goes with the job. He goes to bed late at

On the other hand, he fits in easily amidst the local Holy Cross groups at Corby Hall and prefers to eat with the community when offical duties do not require him to be elsewhere. Ted has aged well. Although he pos­sesses deeply held convic­tions, he is not narrowly bound to the past either by way of thought or procedure. 
Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., has been a pastor, a teacher, a counselor and an administrator here at Notre Dame. These roles are in­separable for they all spring from a deep sense of faith and the vowed commitment to a life of service which is at the heart of his understanding --­of Christian discipleship .

great administrator, as a holy 
man and a wonderful priest. 
He is certainly all of these 
and more. But I would prefer 
to write of him as a friend, as 
somebody who has given 
much of himself, and who has 
shared with me opportunities 
unique in all of the world. 
About six years ago, Father 
Joyce invited me to join him 
as his administrative assis­
tant, and I was introduced 
firsthand to the team which 
has led Notre Dame for the 
past 35 years. Father Res­
burgh has said over and over 
again that he and Father 
Joyce are a team, and it is 
clear that this is true. 
Working with Father Joyce, I 
came to truly appreciate how 
much the prestige enjoyed by 
Notre Dame today, and the 
financial stability that has 
made that possible, are the 
result of a vision and respon­
sibility shared by Fathers 
Ned and Ted. Father Res­
burgh dares to dream, and 
Father Joyce finds the 
wherewithal to make those 
dreams come true. Neither one of them ever lets their egos get in the way of what 

has to be done. Rather, each 
in their own way, they 
embrace the challenges and 
opportunities their positions 
at the University present 
them, and do what has to be 
done. 
Three years ago, I became Father Hesburgh's executive assistant, and became even more familiar with his world and his responsibilities. It soon became clear that I was working with a man who was excited every day by his work and the challenges it pre­sented, a man who was hap­piest when he was busiest, a man who could survive on little sleep if need be. 
I would not want to guess how many letters Father Res­burgh gets in a week, but I know it is in the hundreds. They come from national and world leaders, students, alumni, concerned Catholics, prisoners, young people and old people. They come from the rich and the poor, and everyone in between. They write on Universitv 
and world business. But every

letter is answered no matter what its purpose. 
I have also had the opportu­nity to travel with Father Hesburgh to far corners of the world. As a result I have gained an appreciation of how much he is known and respected all over the globe. He is capable of getting sig­nificant things done in the world because he is "Father Hesburgh." Important gov­ernment leaders will change their schedules, and will even check themselves out of hospitals to see him. Not be­cause he can harm them or their careers in any way if they don't, but because they admire and respect him that much. Furthermore, it is vir­tually impossible for him to travel unrecognized, even if he tries. He is simply too well known. But, no matter where he is, or with whom he is speaking, Notre Dame is al­ways part of the conversa­tion, if not its main focus. No matter where he travels, Notre Dame is with him, and he is always spreading her name and her fame. 
However, everything else about Father Hesburgh pales when compared to what comes first in his life, his priesthood. From his daily celebration of Mass, to the simplicity of his lifestyle, to his putting people and their needs as top priority, there is never any doubt that he is first a Holy Cross priest. Everything he does flows from that reality, and it be­comes obvious to anybody who spends any time with him. The thing I cherish most about the opportunity I have had to work closely with Fa­ther Hesburgh is what he has taught me by the way he lives his life in service to God and the Church. It is a lesson I hope to recall often in the years ahead.

up to now." 

"And to make all of this n<~nno:>n we're going to have to raise money," Malloy said. 
In a March interview, Mal­loy said he also wants to look at the use and abuse of alco­hol on campus. 
In addition, he said, "I 
a desire to get more 
and minorities in-

in the administrative roles at the University, and in the years ahead I plan to give priority to that." 
So far, Malloy said, he has had only a few positions to fill. 
As for what he'll do differ­ently from Hesburgh, Malloy said he's "going to be myself as <Hesburgh) was himself." 
"I just want to develop a style of administration that I'm comfortable with," Mal­loy said. "So rather than dis­tinguish myself from Father Hesburgh, I'm going to try to build on what I think are my strengths." 
Those strengths, Malloy said include being a good listener, working well with others and being able to articulate the views of the University. 
The selection of a new pres­ident became necessary when Hesburgh told the Board of 
Trustees in 1982 that he would 
retire in five more years. 
Hesburgh, who has been 
president since 1952, served 
on the nominating committee 
but did not take an active 
role in selecting the new pres­
ident. 

Speaking at the November news conference, Hesburgh said, "Both Ned (Joyce) and I believe the new team going now is going to really bring a new spirit to the place. 
"They're going to bring 
new ideals and new initiatives 
and that's good. Places need 
change ... That's what keeps 
places vital," said Hesburgh. 
"You don't worry about it 
because these are very won­
derful people and they have 
our total support and our 
prayers," said Hesburgh. 
As president, Hesburgh has become famous for his exten­sive travel and participation in groups, boards and com­mittees outside Notre Dame. 
How much time will Malloy spend on outside activities? . "I have enough invitations already to be gone every day," he said. "I don't intend to do that." 
Malloy said he'll try to achieve a balance between his responsibilities on campus and those involving national and international issues. 
In the past, Malloy has maintained contact with stu­dents through his popular theology courses and his Sorin Hall room. 
"I don't know of a greater group of people than Notre Dame students," said Malloy, speaking at the November press conference. 
Malloy, who has lived in Sorin Hall for more than eight years, said he will con­tinue living in the dorm next year. 
"I happen to live in Sorin Hall," he said. "It has also provided a place for me hope­fully to be available to other students. I hope to continue that outreach in the years ahead." 
Once he becomes president, Malloy said he expects there to be plenty of issues that people will disagree over. 
"But I hope that people will at least know that they are being taken seriously and consulted with," Malloy said. "One of the jobs of an admin­istrator is to help people deal with disagreement and disap­pointment. 
"I hope I can do that, as well as help people dream some big dreams for the place too."

by Chris Bednarski 
W 
ith the election of Father William Beau­champ to the position of the University's executive vice-president, he and Uni­versity President-elect Fa­ther Edward "Monk" Mal­loy will work as a team. 
Beauchamp, 44, current executive assistant to Uni­versity President Father Theodore Hesburgh, and previously considered a possible successor to Res­burgh, will succeed Father Edmund Joyce, current ex­ecutive vice president when he and Hesburgh retire this year. 
"I believe in consulta­tion, in a collaborating style, in listening," he added. 
"I'm very excited," said Beauchamp following the November press confer­ence. "A team was brought in today. But Father Mal­loy is the boss," he said. 
Beauchamp said he and Malloy will model their ad­ministration after that of Hesburgh and Joyce. "That's (Malloy's) model. We will function as a team," he said. 
Beauchamp, in addition to his role as executive as­sistant to the president, has also served as assis­tant professor of manage­ment in the College of 
Father Ted, 
Business Administration. 
Beauchamp graduated from the University of Detroit in 1964 with a B.S. degree in accounting, re­ceiving an M.B.A. degree from the same institution two years later. He pursued postgraduate studies in higher education on a part-time basis at -Michigan State University between 1966 and 1971 while teaching and serving as associate director of ad­missions at Alma College in Alma, Michigan. 
In 1975, after receiving a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Notre Dame Law School, he returned to Alma to work as an attorney in a general practice law firm. He en­tered Moreau Seminary at 
Notre Dame in January, 1977, received a Master's degree in divinity in 1981 and was ordained a priest Apri117, 1982. Between 1980 and 1984, when he assumed his present position, he served as adminstrative assistant to Joyce. 
In 1984, he chaired the University Committee on the Responsible Use of Al­cohol, which set the Uni­versity's present policy on student use and abuse of alcohol.

The Road Not Taken page 44 
Presidential choice was less dramatic in 1952 
by Mary Jacoby 
S
peculation about who would succeed Father Theodore Hesburgh as Notre Dame's president ran high and intense last November in the weeks before the Board of Trustees announced its decision. In 1986, there were at least five candidates con­sidered in the running, and guessing about the final selec­tion continued until the Board announced its choice of Fa­ther Edward Malloy. 
Thirty-five years ago, however, speculation about who would succeed then Uni­versity President Father John 
. Cavanaugh was more aca­demic. Since he was Cavanaugh's assistant, no one was surprised when Hesburgh took the keys to the adminis­trative offices from his predecessor. Yet, other names had been mentioned as possible successors to Cavanaugh, most notably Fa­ther Howard Kenna, then the superior of Holy Cross Col­lege in Washington, D.C. 

There were several reasons why the selection of a new University president in 1952 created considerably less drama than it did in 1986. Canon law then limited the religious superior to a maxi­mum of six years in the posi­tion. Thus, the changing of the guard had been regular and expected. And in 1952, Hesburgh accepted this job he didn't particularly want--he preferred teaching--under the impression that he would serve a maximum of six years before being free to pursue other interests. 
But six years later Res­burgh was coming into his prime at age 41, and the posi­tion of religious superior was divided from the University presidency so that Hesburgh could remain in office. He was the first in more than 40 years to occupy the presi­
We'll miss you, Father Ted Love, Farley 

dent's office for longer than six years. 

How would the University be different today if Kenna had been selected over Res­burgh in 1952? One thing's for sure: Notre Dame wouldn't be bidding farewell to a presi­dent who has headed the Uni­versity for 35 years. Kenna died of a heart attack in 1973 shortly after his retirement as provincial of the Indiana Province of the Congregation of Holy Cross. 
Kenna would not have seemed a surprising choice for the presidency in 1952. A native of rural Minnesota, Kenna graduated from Notre Dame in 1926 and was or­dained into the priesthood at Sacred Heart Church in 1930. 

He served as head of the Uni­versity's math departmentt and also held the position of director of studies for Notre Dame. From 1949 to 1950, Kenna was vice-president for academic affairs. In 1955, Kenna moved to Oregon and became the president of the University of Portland, an­other Holy Cross school. Res­burgh's term was three years old. 
Kenna became provincial in 1962 and helped Hesburgh guide Notre Dame through the Vatican II era. Pope Paul had announced the building of a bridge to the contemporary world as one of the Council's goals. In 1967, two years after Vatican II had ended, both Kenna and Hesburgh were supporting the establishment of a predominantly lay Board of Trustees for the versity. 
It was this Board which decided upon Hesburgh's suc­cessor last November--the Board which might have pro­vided a little more suspense to the selection of University presidents if it had existed before the Hesburgh era. 
But those were different times. Hesburgh was the man chosen to preside over the changes. Hence, speculation about other men in his job is almost unthinkable for the Notre Dame community which has lived under his leadership for 35 years. Mary Jacoby is a senior from Little Rock, Ark.

hen the Notre Dame community wel­comes the new administration after commencement, it will say bon voyage to the old. Father Theodore Hesburgh and Father Edmund Joyce will spend the first year of their retirement traveling the United States and abroad. Joyce said their vacation, in part, is meant to give the new administration "breath­ing room. Part of the purpose is to get away from Notre Dame so that the new administra­tion can stand on its own two feet. We won't be seen. That brin~s the message to the Notre Dame commumty that there are new people 
now.'' 
"Our plans for vacation are unstructured for the moment, but one way or another, I am going to get out of here for a year," said Hesburgh. "I may come back to change laundry now and then, but I'm literal­ly, as much as possible, going to be out of here for a year." 
Hesburgh and Joyce said that they want to see their own country. 
'I've been in 130 different countries, but I'd like to see my own from the ground. I've traveled over two million miles, all over the world, but I've seen my own country mostly from airports, meeting rooms, and hotel rooms," said Hesburgh. "I've done literally zero touristing in all this travel because I don't spend the night in New York or Washington or San Francisco if I can get a plane

back here." Departure tentatively is set for June 10. The duo will travel in a recreational vehicle donated by Art Decio, a Notre Dame Trustee and President of the Skyline Corporation. 
Hesburgh and Joyce will depart from Notre Dame and travel throughout the northwestern part of the na­tion. Joyce said that the course has not been outlined definitively, but that he and Hesburgh hope to spend the summer months in Montana, the Dakotas, Oregon, Colorado and Alaska. During the fall months they will work their way down the California coast to Arizona, New Mexico, and into Mexico. The trip will last approximately six months. 
"We may RV it or we may do something else. We're at least going to start out RV­ing it. Smart money is we won't get past Gary," Res­burgh said. 
In January of 1988, Res­burgh and Joyce will leave on the Queen Elizabeth II to travel around the world. They will function as the ship's chaplains. "We're working for our keep," said Hesburgh adding that, "I've found that aboard the ship as priest, you get a workout." 
Joyce said that counseling and presiding over baptisms, marriages, funerals, and masses for the QE II's 3000

passengers will involve much of their time. "And aside from the duties, we will be eating well and enjoying all of the sight seeing." 
The winter cruise will last three and a half months. The trip will circle the globe, starting from Fort Lauder­dale, Fla. It will pass through the Panama Canal and port in the South Sea Islands, Australia, Hong Kong, Sin­gapore, India, the east coast of Africa, Buenos Aires, and in various locations along the coast of South America. 
"I'd like to swing through Latin America, which I'm a little bit behind because I haven't done that swing in a few years. I'm interested in that part of the world. I'm going to work with (Helen) Kellogg (Institute for Interna­tional Studies) and the Peace Institute when I get back and that trip will probably be in connection," Hesburgh said. 
Upon his return to Notre Dame in April of 1988, Res­burgh will assume the capacity of chairman of both the Advisory Board of the Kellogg Institute for Interna­tional Studies and the In­stitute for International Peace Studies. The Institute for Peace Studies was formed using the $6 million endow­ment donated by Mrs. Joan Kroc of the McDonald's Cor­poration. According to Joyce, one aspect of the institute will be a program under Gov. 
John Gilligan to bring young people from Russia, China, America, Europe and the Third World to talk about the issues of peace. 
"Father Hesburgh will be doing a lot of other things, seminars and lectures, just to keep the attention of the world on this important sub­ject," said Joyce. 
Joyce said he will occupy much of his time raising money for the university. As honorary chairman he will work with the Sorin Society and the newly developed Badin Guild to bring wills of bequest and trusts to the uni­versity. 
Even though both Hesburgh and Joyce will be functioning in the Notre Dame environ­ment, both said they will not participate in administrative matters. "Neither Father Ned nor myself are pushing our­selves on anybody. We'll just be here. Things the adminis­tration wants us to do, I'm sure they'll ask us to do it," said Hesburgh. 
Joyce said that he and Res­burgh are staying involved with Notre Dame on their own volition. "We're both healthy and we have so much of ourselves involved in the University that we both want to work for it and do as much as we can for it as long as we live."

Saint Mary's improves with Notre Dame 
by Margie Kersten 
T 
he relationship between Saint Mary's and Notre Dame can only be as strong as its leaders. College Presi­dent William Hickey, has been at the College for 25 years and directly has wit­nessed the effect University President Father Theodore Hesburgh has had on Saint Mary's as a Catholic women's college. 
"Father Ted has always been a strong supporter of Saint Mary's," Hickey com­mented. He continued by noting that as Notre Dame became stronger academi­cally and received national recognition, Saint Mary's received "greater recogni­tion." 
Presiding as Saint Mary's acting president in 1974-75, Hickey said, "This experience provided me with numerous opportunities to interact with Father Hesburgh. Saint Mary's always was included in all of Notre Dame's activi­ties," he continued. 
When Hickey served as vice president he was responsible for the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame cooperative aca­demic programs. "Father Ted always supported these activities. In fact, he often said to me, 'If you have any difficulties on this side of the road, just give me a call and I'll take care of it.' That is very much the way we operated together," Hickey said. 
"Now, as I begin my term as president, Father Ted has been very supportive and en­couraging," he said. 
Hickey said he sees Res­burgh as a deeply religious, committed and sincere per­son. "Father Hesburgh al­ways made it clear that beyond everything else, he is a priest," Hickey said. 
Hesburgh is a dreamer "who made things happen." He has an enormous amount of energy and most impor­tantly, he is "honest, open and clear about his positions on issues, including tough ones," Hickey said. 
Hickey said the advice Res­burgh gave him at his in­auguration in September characterizes his approach to the presidency. "He told me to have courage, keep a sense of humor and remember that there is an easy way to go and then there is the right way," Hickey said. 
"Overall, Father Ted has demonstrated at Notre Dame that it is possible to be a strong institution academi­cally and also be a Catholic institution, concerned with social, ethical and spiritual dimensions." Hickey said.

Quality and diversity of students increases 
by Kevin Rooney 
I 
n 1951, Notre Dame's freshman class was an average group by all the standard measures of stu­dent quality. In addition, it was all male and Caucasian. Ten years later, Father Hesburgh's cam­paign for academic excel­lence had attracted many students with strong aca­demic credentials who sought the undergraduate education available at a medium-sized Catholic uni­versity with a strong teach­ing faculty. Since then, Notre Dame's academic reputation has grown steadily and the quality of the applicants and the freshmen has continued to improve. 
Minority students never numbered more than a dozen in any freshman class until the late sixties when their numbers began an erratic growth pattern which continues today, even as minority enroll­ment seems to be declining nationwide. Father Res­burgh's leadership in the campaign for civil rights provided the impetus for Notre Dame's initial in­volvement in minority recruitment. 

The admission of women to Notre Dame's under­graduate programs ranks as one of Father Res­burgh's two proudest ac­complishments. Women have helped to improve the intellectual and social at­mosphere of the campus, while also gaining an edu­cation which has opened many doors for them.

ather Theodore Hesburgh is especially proud of two of the countless accomplishments of his 35 years as president of the University of Notre Dame. One is the admission of women to Notre Dame in 1972, and the other is his decision to turn the control of the University over to a lay board of trustees. 
Since the founding of Notre Dame in 1842 under charter from the State of Indiana, the University has been governed by a Board of Trustees, the governing body for all academic, financial, investment, public, and student affairs. Originally, this Board was made up of six Holy Cross priests. In 1967, however, Hesburgh and that clerical Board initiated the first major reorganization of its government in 125 years by giving their sole control of the University to laymen as legal trustees of Notre Dame's endowment. They created the Fellows of the University and the predominantly lay Board of Trustees. 
Hesburgh said there were special meetings in 1967 to obtain permission to turn the control and legal assets of the University over to the lay Board. He had to meet with representatives of the Holy Cross Order, the state of Indiana, and even Rome, because the Church needed to approve giving away more than $10,000. "The University was already worth a half billion," he said, "and we gave the title and powers of the University over to the Trustees without asking for anything, with no conditions. It had to have been the largest amount ever handed over to lay control." 
Father Hesburgh described Notre Dame's Board of Trustees today as "truly unique, a microcosm of our country. We have trustees who are black, white, men, women, Hispanic, Protestant, Jewish, and they come from all over the country and beyond," he said. 
"They are not just businessmen who are barely involved with the University," Hesburgh said. 
Of the lay Board of Trustees, one of his two greatest accomplishments at Notre Dame, Hesburgh merely smiled and said, "I wouldn't change a thing about it."

N
otre Dame's endowment has increased over 45 fold since Father Theodore Res­burgh and Father Edmund Joyce began their administra­tive duties, largely because of a combination of wise invest­ment and energetic fundrais­ing. 
"Father Joyce deserves most of the credit for the way our financial resources have been managed. Father Joyce is the principle architect of Notre Dame's financial re­sources and physical plant," said Joseph Sandman, direc­tor of development at the Uni­versity. 
As a result of four capital campaigns in addition to an­nual giving, the endowment has risen from $9 million to $400 million at market value. 
According to James Murphy, associate vice presi­dent for University relations, the University coordinates its fundraising through a single office. "We have a depart­ment of development which is almost totally concerned with fundraising," said Murphy. 
"Fundraising goes back to the very beginning of the Uni­versity," Murphy continued. He said University Founder Father Edward Sorin made some 40 trips to Europe to raise money. The University

started its annual fund in 1942 with a professional fundrais­ing office being established in 1947. 
The first capital campaign in the HesburgWJoyce admin­istration was the Challenge I from 1960 to 1963. The Ford Foundation challenged the University with a grant of $6 million if they could raise twice that amount, according to Murphy. "The centerpiece of that campaign was the Memorial Library," Murphy said. 
Challenge I raised $18,603,157 from 23,438 gifts in addition to the $6 million added by the Ford Founda­tion, according to the Final Report of the Campaign for Notre Dame. 
"Almost continuously, the Ford Foundation said we'd do it again," Murphy said. The Ford Foundation pledged an­other $6 million if the Univer­sity could again double that amount by 1966. 
This time, $16,084,291 was raised through 19,213 dona­tions, with the Ford Founda­tion adding another $6 mil­lion, according to the Campaign for Notre Dame's Final Report. The Athletic and Convocation Center was the most visible result of Challenge II. 
"We had hoped the Ford Foundation would go with us a third time," said Murphy. When they did not, the Uni­versity went ahead with the SUMMA campaign from 1967 to 1972. This time, a total of 31,426 gifts generated $62.5 million in support. 
Finally, from 1975 to 1981, the Campaign for Notre Dame generated $180,507,236 through 47,521 gifts. Accor­ding to its final report, the Campaign for Notre Dame received the participation of 86 percent of the University's alumni and supported the building of Pasquerilla East and Pasquerilla West, The Snite Museum of Art, and Fitzpatrick Hall of Engineer-· ing. The Campaign also produced a dramatic increase in the endowment and the es­

tablishment of several en­
dowed chairs. 
The latest campaign, "Notre Dame: A Strategic Moment," is scheduled to begin May 9 of this year and continue through 1991 with a goal of $300 million. 
In addition to the four capi­tal campaigns, Notre Dame also has other sources of sup­port. According to Sandman, the University needs un­restricted financial help from its supporters. "We want to educate our donors so that they know Notre Dame needs three types of support-­capital, annual and deferred-­if we are going to fulfill our mission," Sandman said. 
Since Hesburgh and Joyce took over the business of run­ning Notre Dame in 1952, the annual support has increased from $1.1 million in 1953 to $48.3 million last year. The annual fund has doubled since the 1983-84 academic year. 
In addition to annual giving, the University seeks deferred gifts. "We get a very small percent of our cash from deferred giving," Sandman said. 
In addition to alumni, the Development Office seeks contributions from parents, friends, corporations and foundations, according to Murphy. 
According to Murphy, Notre Dame's endowment "hovers around the 20th largest in the country." There are several reasons for this. 
First, "Notre Dame has had an absolutely unique mis­sion," said Sandman, citing the Catholic character of the University as an important factor in its ability to generate donations. 
Second, Sandman said, Res­burgh's strong leadership has been very important. "He has been the strongest, most en­during leader in American higher education," Sandman noted. 
Finally, Sandman identified "the unbelievable loyalty of our alumni and friends" as a factor in fundraising. 
Despite constructing over 40 buildings during Res­burgh's tenure, the University has managed to incur very little debt. "It's almost a debt-free campus," said Sandman. Concerning the budget generally, he added, "In the 35 years Hesburgh and Joyce have been in their jobs, the University has finished in the black 34 of them." 
Sandman said Joyce is in large part responsible for the profitablility of Notre Dame's auxiliary enterprises like the Morris Inn, the ACC and the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore which have helped to keep tuition down. 
In addition to both Res­

burgh and Joyce, the Invest­
ment Committee of the Board 
of Trustees has been a major 
factor in the growth of the 
endowment. 
"They decide how the Uni­versity should invest its money," Sandman said.

''(The new adminis­tration) should try to get the best professors and the best students and they should main­tain the moral and spiritual values of Notre Dame, so that this remains a Catho­lic university in reality as well as in name." 
Rev. Edmund P. Joyce Quoted in "Scholastic" Oct. 2, 1986 
"We do not pray today that somehow all crises will miraculously cease, for crisis is the pat­tern of history and al· ways will be. We only ask, humbly and con­fidently, that we may be worthy of the truth that is ours, for those on the side of truth are on the side of God, and, ultimately, of victory.''

"Going co-ed after 125 years as an all-male institution was a big thing. I've seen Notre Dame from 1934 to 1972 as an all-male enclave, and it left many things to be desired. I think it's vastly superior in the latter reality than in the former reality. It's much more of a fam­ily place."

If they do not within that time period cease and desist, they will be asked for their identity cards . . . Without being melodramatic, if this conviction makes this my last will and testa­ment to Notre Dame, so be it." 
Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh Letter to the student body,

"Our University stu­dents should be given a clear, precise, and scientifically accurate picture of what faces them today, what will happen "if,'' and what intellectual, moral and political options they have if their gen­eration is to emerge safely from this cor­ner into which we have painted humanity. The situa­tion is desperate but not hopeless. Students must be led to under­stand it and to act while there is time."

If no real steps are taken to make in­tercollegiate athletics academically respec­table and honest, Notre Dame simply can't expect to be as competitive in the fu­ture as we've been in the past. We're playing by another set of rules."

Hesburgh has been busy doing saints' work 
T
he essential thing about him is he's a Holy Cross priest, as he's always proud to point out. He's grown old in office, though he still looks good and seems in fine shape. He certainly doesn't look old, but his pictures tell a story. He was 35 when he became president of Notre Dame, and now he's twice 35: the face has lines in it that weren't always there, and his hair is silvery. Sometimes, late at night, he looks tired; when you're his age, all the tired­ness is not gone by morning. But he's a priest, and his priesthood doesn't get old or tired. 
Father Hesburgh has a con­tinuing vision of himself as a priest. It gives him an iden­tity to live up to, and God blesses him for the effort, as God blesses anyone who stays open to His grace. You don't have to be a mystic to see he's a very good priest. Lay people who would find the idea of the supernatural em­barrassing love and respect him as a man of God. But sometimes critics, having low opinions of clergymen, dis­miss them as hypocrites. To be honest, the hypocrites don't survive long. Nothing could wear a priest out as much as hypocrisy would: preaching a Gospel he doesn't believe; offering a Mass that perpetuates medieval non­sense; urgmg the precepts of a religion that enfeebles the mind. For two decades now, we have watched priests dropping out: the signs of their unhappiness show up well in advance of their resigning. They find it miserable to stick around, once their faith has gone. 
Father Hesburgh has been one of the Holy Cross priests who have kept the Church going. His doubts would have betrayed him if he had be­come religiously indifferent; we would have heard the hol­lowness in every word he preached; we would have noticed the worldliness taking over. Day in, day out, for many years now, demands have been made upon him; his admirers don't leave him alone long. No matter how tired or busy he is, he always finds time to write the letter, give the talk, say the Mass, attend the dinner, befriend the student, give advice to the losers. When, since his or­dination, has he ever stopped acting like a priest, thinking like a priest, believing like a priest, praying like a priest; nurturing other priests who have given up on themselves or God or the Church? The Holy Cross community sees him on those few informal occasions in the week when he's not in the spotlight. He's eating a bowl of cereal at lunchtime in Corby Hall; he's having dinner; he's on the 

Robert Griffin 
way to, or on the way back from, his office. His word is constantly encouraging, like a shipmate telling you all is well. I'm a better chaplain after saying hello to him, be­cause I want to be worthy of belonging on his crew. His message, usually unspoken, is "We're here for the sake of others. Some of them are in hot water or have made mis­takes. A few are afraid we're not to be trusted. All of them are wonderful, even when they're unhappy or bitter; they're worth any amount of trouble, so what makes the difference if they cost you a night's sleep and hours of persuasion? Notre Dame is here as a moral miracle, showing us what decency and sacrifice are all about; we're here temporarily as caretakers of this mythical campus. Let's show the world all the class we've learned from the traditions that were handed down to us. Even if the ones, for whose sake we're knocking ourselves out, are mad with us, let's make them see we're here for them, if they need us." 
As a child in Sunday school, I was taught a simple verse: "Only one life( 'Twill soon be past ;I Only what's done! For Christ will last." That's the message Father Hesburgh registers with me. If they took back his honorary degrees one after the other; if they reduced him in rank un­til he was the most lowly as­sistant, in the meanest parish, in the most benighted city, in the poorest country in the world, he would still greet you--I swear--in a way that lets you see his passion for Christ's people. If he's not a saint, it's because he's too busy doing the saints' work for them. He's never missed saying Mass; before his life is over, he'll probably be saying Mass on the dark side of the moon. Why bother to ask if he's a saint, if you can see the visible manifestations of wellsprings of grace from the depths of his soul? To talk of him as a saint would embar­rass him. It shouldn't hurt him to know he confirms many of us in the faith we so imperfectly share with him. 
Hesburgh's Notre Dame is the kind of place it is because he's a young-at-heart priest 
who will dream young dreams until his dreaming time is over on this earth. Ask him what's ahead, and he'll talk of children growing up, free of hunger and fear in a peaceful world. Notre Dame, as fine as it is, is only one of his dreams, and it may be second in importance to the dream he has now. Per­haps as he is passing on the stewardship of Notre Dame to some of his younger col­leagues, he's dreaming of the ways he can help them make the place better. Already his datebook is filling up with other appointments he must keep, other talks he must give, other traveling he has to do, other Masses he has been invited to say, for the sake of the children. They may have a better chance of growing up beautifully, because they 
have peacemakers like Fa­ther Hesburgh on their side. 

Your heart doesn't have to be kept younger than springtime by the graces of an eternal priesthood, in or­der for you to have global concerns. But the love that Christ taught us shows that we should never stop trying, even when we're dying. Fa­ther Hesburgh never has stopped trying to use himself up in the service of goodness and truth. I love him very much for working so hard.

Hesburgh has served as a priest and mediator 
Vision +Commitment= Excellence. 
In 1952, Father Theodore Hesburgh started using this formula to make the University of Notre Dame one of the finest Catholic schools in the world 
Thirty-three years later, Adworks was founded using the same formula. We saw the need for a student-run, on-campus advertising network to provide campus organizations with quality advertisements at low prices. 
We strive to follow the same formula for excellence that Fr. Hesburgh has followed during his 35-year tenure at Notre Dame, and wish him the best of luck in the future. 
It all adds up . .. 
Thanks, Father lfesburgh for growing up with us.

ather Hesburgh has played many roles, but he has had only one identity-­that of a priest. 
I have always thought the centrality of his priesthood is the very thing that has en­abled him to be so effective in all he has done in the more than four decades since his ordination in Sacred Heart Church. He may have awakened, as I sometimes have, wondering if this were Pittsburgh or London, but he never wondered about who he was--a priest of God--or what he was essentially about--the ministry of mediation. 
Mediation is a kind of template that one can lay over the life of Father Ted as a guide to understanding it. As a priest, he mediated be­tween God and Man. He has done this in reform schools, in diplomatic circles in Vien­na, in the parched and barren Sahel, in the chapels of campus residence halls. He has never had a parish, yet he has always done pastoral work. "When someone calls you 'Father'," he once said, "You know you belong to everyone." 

I was reminded recently of the theme of mediation in Fa­ther Ted's life when I saw a copy of the 1962 Time maga­zine that featured him. In the cover painting he is holding an open book. On one page is a Madonna, on the facing page, atomic equations. As an educator, Father Hesburgh has mediated between the supernatural and the natural, between religion and science, between value and fact. He has recalled to us the blend­ing of faith and inquiry represented in the great medieval European univer­sities nourished by the Church and has challenged us to recreate that unique com­munity of learners and believers in contemporary America. 

Donald Keough 

Mediators serve, and Fa­ther Ted has taken the Roman collar to some places where it was seen for the first time. He was the first theolo­gian to be a member of the National Science Board, the first priest to be accredited formally as U.S. diplomat, and certainly the first person to be on the Board of the Chase Manhattan Bank with­out even having a checking account. In the 14 Presiden­tial appointments he ac­cepted, none was partisan or parochial. All were public service tasks above the politi­cal fray and all dealt with the broadest issues of our time-­civil and human rights, world poverty and hunger, the search for peace and justice. His priesthood set him apart in a way that allowed him to pursue the mediator's job of bringing people together to work for the common good. He brought with him moral credibility and disinterest in personal gain, and so people listened to him. In fact, some of his best homilies came not from the pulpits of churches but from the hearing rooms of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. 



Father Ted's long and dis­tinguished record as a public servant underscores the fact that he has always been--as mediators are--a man of ac­tion. He has never been pa­tient with those who, he once observed, "sit in the corner and suck their ideological thumbs." He not only preached the Word but also turned the Gospel to deed. When the nation of Cambodia was threatened with massive hunger, he led a fundraising drive that raised $70 million in a matter of months from public and private sources, saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. Others at the time simply quarreled about the relative "merits" of the two oppressive and opposed regimes who had laid waste to the country. 
Mediators represent those who have no voice, and more often than not Father Ted has championed the cause of the poor and powerless. He can look back with satisfaction at the omnibus civil rights legis­lation of the 1960's that broke the back of apartheid in America. As chairman of the 
Overseas Development Coun­
cil he was an early prophet 
warning of devastating 
hunger sweeping Third and 
Fourth World countries. He 
has rallied world-class scien­
tists and leaders of the great 
religions to work for the elim­
ination of nuclear weapons. 
Lastly, mediators depend on commitment and dis­cipline. Their mission is for the long haul. Father Ted's lifelong faithfulness to his vows reminds us that such commitments are not only possible but also a source of deep strength. And his daily custom of saying Mass and reading his breviary is more than laudable habit. It speaks to discipline and hence to character. I ask all members of the Notre Dame family to join me in saluting Theodore Martin Hesburgh--priest and mediator. 
Donald Keough is the presi­dent and chief executive offi­cer of the Coca-Cola Company and is the chairman of the Notre Dame Board of Trus­tees .
