University officials meet with police

Student Body President Bill 
Roche yesterday called a prob­
lem of "making sure no one 
gets hurt'' in a confrontation 
with law enforcement officials. 
Dean of Students James Roemer, Security officials Glenn Terry agd Rex Rakow, and Judicial Coodinator Jim O'Hare abo attended the meeting which was re9ue.>ted by the South Bend pollee. Roche also encouraged discussion of the off campus crime problem which has generated tncreasing concern. 
According to Roche, the 
police are now taking "initia­
tives" to remedy the crime 
situation, but Roche declined to 
specify those initiatives--saying 
that making them public would 
defeat their purpose. 
Roche also explained that 
police must respond when 
South Bend residents complain 
about the noise and general 
atmosphere created by students· 
en route to and from the local 
bar.;;. Though South Bend 
police do not initiate bar raids-­
the Alcohoiic Beverage ·.Commission does this--they are responsible for controlling 
c'towds and maintaining order in' the event of a bar raid. 
\'We want to make sure everybody keeps cool. I don't want anyone to get hurt,'' Roche satd yesterday. He said the meeting may be viewed as a preca\}tionary measure for studenp as well as the officials' safety to the future.

"People who do not belong there (the bars) should not be there," he stated. He said students are more aggresive in,situations like bar raids and tend toJ·eopardize themselves.

Civiletti 
warns about info leaks 

WASHINGTON (AP) -Con­demning "the flood of leaks" from criminal investigations, Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti warned Justice De­partment employees in two special meetings yesterday that he will fire anyone caught disclosing confidential infor­mation. 
In one of the more extensive and dramatic efforts in recent years to stern leaks to the press, Civiletti appeared twice in the Justice Department's Great Hall tQ deliver a 25-rninute speech to about 800 employees. 
In addition, he said videotapes and transcripts of his remarks were being sent to department offices around the country. 
He said his efforts were spark­ed by the leak of the FBI's Abscam investigation of politi­cal corruption and by two other leaks. Etght members of Con­gress have been named by sources as being implicated in the Abscarn case, although no charges have been brought. 
The two other cases are FBI 
investigations of insurance rac­
kets and organized crime, dub­
bed Brilab and Pendorf respec­
tively. There, too, the names of 
potential defendants have been 
published before any charges 
have been lodged. 

Civiletti detailed the harm that 
leaks cause, methods that re­
porters use to get them and 
ways of deflecting inquiries by 
reporters. But he emphasized 
that he felt it proper for 
~eporter~ to try to get such 
mforrnatton. 

"If a department employee leaks confidential information from an investigation, that em­ployee, iffound, will lose their position,'' Civiletti said. ''Ifnot found, at least that employee will lose his or her honor and self-respect.'' 
Civiletti has already begun an

Conservative Bush edges Anderson in Massachussetts 
NEW YORK (AP) -In Mass­
achusetts, George Bush was the 
man in the middle. 
An Associated Press-NBC 
news poll of voters showed that 
Ronald Reagan bested Bush 
among Republican voters with 
conservative views, while doing 
as well as him among older 
GOP voters. 
And Rep. :John Anderson 
took away the ballots of those 
with more liberal views on the 
issues, along with the better 
educated and the younger 
voter. 
But Bush's support from this 
wide variety of groups gave him 
a tiny margin of victory over 
Anderson in Tuesday's 
balloting, with Reagan only a 
few thou3and votes behind. 
Interviews with more than 
2200 GOP voters outside polling 
places were the basis for the 
AP-NBC News poll. 
One way to analyze the re3ults 
is to look at the GOP voters 
positions on the is3ues. Take 
the proposed Equal Rights 
Amendment: 
Reagan's voters split 46-37 
against the ERA. Next came the Bush supporters, who favored . the ERA by 54-35. And then were the Anderson backers, Iwho favored the amendment by 1 an overwhelming 77-16 margin. 
The re3t were undecided in 
each ca3e. 
Anderson and Bush support 
the ERA. Reagan opposes it. · 
Or take nuclear power. 
Those who voted . in the 
Massachusetts GOP primary 
split 47-42 in favor of imposing 
a moratorium on building more 
nuclear power plants until 
safety questions are resolved, 
even in the face of possible 
energy shortages. 
Anderson backers support 
such a moratorium by a 63-27 
edge. 
But Reagan backers oppose 
one by a narrow 47-39 margin. 
Bush backers take a similar 
stance -opposing such a mora­
torium by 52-37. 
These issue breakdowns 
reflect the basic political orient­
ation of each man's supporters. 
Reagan got 38 percent 9f the 
Massachusetts GOP con­
servative vote, with Bush 
taking 34 percent. Anderson 
got 17 percent of thei..· ballots. 
Bush came out on top among 
moderates, with 39 percent of

Candidates showcolors 
BOSTON (AP) -George Bush gained a hairbreadth victory over Rep. John Anderson yes­terday morning in the Massa­chusetts presidential primary election. Senate Republican leader Howard Baker quit the race, and former President Gerald R. Ford said the contest for the GOP nomination is "a wide open ballgame'' he may yet enter. 
Because Anderson had taken the lead, several news organi­zations declared him the win­
ner,  only  to  pull  back  when  
lat  tallies  showed  no  one  
with  a  conclusive  lead.  The  

Associated Press was among them, having given Anderson the victory in early evening. 
Ford said the razor margins by which Bush won Massachusetts and Ronald Reagan edged An­derson in Vermont were ''a clear indication to me that there is no consensus'' among Re­publicans. 
He said there won't be such a consensus before the GOP na­tional convention, and thus forecast just the kind of cam­paign stalemate that would give him an opening for another White House bid. 
While Ford hinted in Lauder­hill, Fla., that he may get in, Baker conceded in Washington that he is out. 
''It's pretty clear the cam­paign isn't going anywhere," he said after lagging far behind the leaders in the first five Republican campaign tests. 
While the Repubhcans ran to virtual dead heats in the two Tuesday prima,ries, . President Carter and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy won Democratic land­slides. 
Kennedy won his home Mas­sachusetts primary with 65 percent of the vote to Carter's 29 percent. The president swept Vermont's non-binding primary with 75 percent of the

He said as far as he knew no dogs had been at Goose's. As a former police officer, Terry explained that policemen can­not release dogs without an order from a command officer. 
On the problem ofoff campus crime, Terry confirmed recent police initiatives which he deemed. "ongoing efforts" to combat the problem. However, he declined to comment on those initiatives for the same reason as Roche. 
Roche has asked police to work next year with the Off Campus Commission to' inform students what they can do to prevent theft in their houses and apartments. According to Roche, police are co-operative and willing to meet with stud­ents. 
The same group of officials and students will meet again on Monday to continue their dis­cussions in an effort to resolve these concerns.

their vote. Anderson got 33 percent and Reagan 19 percent. 
Anderson also took the vote of those who had college degrees or graduate degrees. He got 41 percent of their vote and Bush took 34 percent. Reagan got 18 percent. 
But among those with only a high school diploma or less, Reagan got 39 percent of the vote, Bush 27 percent and Anderson 21 percent. 
Reagan also did best among older voters and Anderson the best among the younger group. 
As with all sample suryeys, the results of the the AP-NBC News polls can vary from the opinions of all Massachusetts voters because of chance varia­tions in the sample. 
For polls with more than 2200 interviews, like the poll of the GOP the results should vary no more than 3 percentage points either way because of sampling error.

Gerry's strongest complaints concerned the posters used to advertise the open discussion. He strongly objected to his name being used without his permi3sion and accused the women's organization of mis­quoting him on the posters. 
Mary Ann O'Connor, pres­ident of the organization, apologized for misquotin~ him and said that it was a mtstake made while printing the signs. 
Gerry also asked why he was not sent a personal invitation telling him about the dis­cussion. In response, a mem­ber of the organization pointed out that the meeting held an open invitation to everybody.

the arts. The program was divided into the three segments of film and theater, dance and visual art, and was held in the Center for Continuing Educa­tion. The conference format included lectures, exhibitions, 
films and seminars. 
According to Moira Marti Geoffrion, chairman of the con­ference, the program was an exploratory one for future con­ferences of the same type. Geoffrion said that she was pleased with its outcome. 
Associate Professor of French Anne Lacombe did not express similar satisfaction. In a letter to the editor of The Observer, Lacombe challenged conference organizers with the questions: "Where are the women? Who are they? Are there women?'' 
In her' criticism of Monday's conference activities, Lacombe referred to the ''vacuity of the content and the vacuum of the container." She wrote that there was a total of thirteen participants on Monday, and only three visitors. 
"Artists, intellectuals, crit­ics, students, teachers, when! are you?," Lac om be de­manded. "Not at the confer­ence. 
"Because the conference was put together in two months, it was not highly publicized, and we were not expecting a large turn-out," Geoffrion explained. ''The response to the first two days was rather small, yet the people attending the confer­ence were thrilled. The speak­ers were excellent, and we hope to repeat the conference on a larger scale next year, with more publicity."

facing America today. "We're only short of energy because we are short of leadership,'' he said. The solution to the energy problem, according to Hickel, must be found within the United States. He cited large reserves of tar sands, coal and oil shale that remain untapped due to environmental concerns. 
'The greening of America may, if we follow it too far, lead to the reddening of the Mideast,'' he said. 
"We have not run out of energy," Hickel stated. "We have run out of imagination and leadership. Is that any reason to go to war?'' 
Hickel proposed a )-step plan to achieve prosperity without war. First, he would call for a strengthening of the country's moral fiber. To this end, he advocated readmitting prayer to public schools. "We have got to get back to the well being of the majority. Let's put God back in the schools." 
Secondly, Hickelstre:Ssed the importance of the family unit. "We must rediscover the strength of the family in order to become a nation of one," he said. 
He also asked for an increase in self-discipline among Americans. "Total permissiveness results only in slavery," he said. 
Hickel then called for a stronger economy. An increased level of production is necessary, hs said, to increase the wealth of the nation. "Wealth can only be produced. The government isn't the answer because it can only p.t;.oduce money, not wealth, and this weakens the dollar for all of us," he added. 
Finally, Hickel asked Americans to understand their environ­ment. "We can clean up our countryside and still produce energy that will lift our country out of its slavery to OPEC," he said. 
Bowen anticipated Hickel's remarks, concentrating his criticisms on Carter's economic, energy, and defense policies. 
In the area of national defense, Bowen cited the individual ready reserve which is at less than half its authorized strength according to Bowen. 
''This is one of the ker element.> require~ for early mobilization and early deployment m advance of addmonal manpower that would not be available until the processes of con:Scripti~n were put in place," he said. 
Also, "the intelligence gathering capabilities of the United States have been whittled to the point that our effectiveness in this area is open to question,'' Bowen said. 
According to Bowen, allies of the United States may now be reluctant to share their information ''because they fear it might be rompromised.''. 
Bowen aliio attacked Carter's economic policies. "Our inflation rate has gone from roughly 5 percent whenGeraldFord left office, to over 13 percent today," he said. The cause of this trend, Bowen said; is a "government that continues to spend in excess of its income." A Republican in office, he added, would curb defici 
spending and begin to bring the budget back into balance. 
Bowen accused the predominantly-Democratic Congress of "selling out" the American people on the subject of energy. He cited the recent conference committee report on the· Windfall Oil Profits tax as "doing little or.nothing to solve the .energy crisis facing the nation.'' . ·-­
Bowen su~gested that the most important issue facing the next President ts that of national security. "We must make the volunteer army work and restore o.1r military manpower to its fully authorized levels," he stressed. ' 
.In the energy field, Bowen proposed a combination of ''conservation and production and utilization of alternate fuels to end our dependence on unstable nations.'' 
''The incumbents have failed,'' Bowen said. ''It is time to replace them with a new generation of vigorous Republicans." 
According to Bowen, the 1980 campaign represents "a unique opportunity'' for the Republican party to provide the leadership that is necessary to resolved the nation's problem

P.O.BoxQ 
The Anderson difference 
Dear Editor: 
In his article of Feb. 29, Mi­chael Onufrak state.> accuratt"ly that mo.>t candidates are in agreement over the wording of the 1980 ND Mock Conventior platform. However, we take great pride in pointing out that our candidate, joh11 B. Ander­son, _stands apart from the rest. 
There was lirrle debate last Thursday over whether or not Notre Dame should support tht· -1Pe~pg of billi~n.> of dollar.; on o""'J five mthtary boon· doggie,, mentioned in the plat.. form. Yet Onuft:ak did point out that there was a dt.>.>enting opinion--Anderson's. For Jvhn 
. Ander.>on i.> the only candidate who is re.spon.>ible enough to .state that it is u.sele.s.> to engage in what will be only one of many more round.> of a continuing unrestricted arms race. An­derson know.> that a .stronger defen.;;e is nece.:;.sary, but call.> for an adequate increase in conventional weaponry and na­val .str_ength to deter Soviet expan.swn. 
Along with Ander.>on, the other candidate..> call for an increa.>e in domestic producti­vity to balance the budget. Yet th~ eight other.> plan to plunge the. bonuses of American.>' more efficient work into missile .system.:., .submarines and neu­tron '·bombs rather than on better government, roads, health care, or .>chool.s. Priori­ties are out of order--but not only whfn it come.> down to defen,:;e. 
John Anderson is the only candidate to come up with any kind of program to reduce American dependence on fo­reign o;I. The Platform Com­mittee .saw this and wisely tncluded a recommendation of Anderson's 50-50 plan. With­out offerin~ any alternati.ve, the other candtdates have criflbzed the idea, preferring to tald about way_.; to better defend the . Persian Gulf. We are at the brink of national emergency becau.>e our oil .>upply is en­dangered, and we will continue to be at the brink until we le,.;.-;en the strategic importance we place on the Gulf area. We mLI.-it con,:;<"rve fuel. Going to war in orde.r to protect our right to over-con.;ume is unthink­able. Sacrifice i.> nect"..>..>ary. Granted, it i.~ .rime to _be rough abroad, but rr .s also ume to be tough on our:;elve.; at home. 
Finally, one other i.>.sue mu,:;t be di.scu.>.sed. A.> read, the platform calL-; handgun control "crucial" to the le.>.>ening of violc·nt crime. Yet we find the plank insufficient. At the Gun Owner.-; of American -Nationa H.ifle A . .;sociation foruin in Nev.· Hamp.-;hire two weeks ago. John Anderson called for licen­

sing of handguns and: their 
owners. Strf'.s.sing the practical 
,;en.sibility of a program which 
would require prospective gun 
buyers to pa,;;.s a te.st proving 
competence, Anderson wa,;; 
.shouted down by the con.>erva­
ti':e. ~udience, and predictably 
cntlCtzed by the other candi­
dates. We feel that an amend­
ment recommending his testing 
program would make the plat­
form more laudable. 
On Thursday, when the plat­
f,lrm is radied, and on Friday 
when a nominee is .selected, 
Notre Dame .>tudent.s have a 
chance to .speak out--a chance 
which comes only once every 
four years. We can demon­
strate the inventiveness and 
leader,;;hip expected from thi,;; 
campus by calling for a plat­
ferro thac '"re.s.se.s program,;; 
Instead of platitudes and by 
nominating a candidate who 
dares ·o be different--who dares 
to tell America what it must 
hear, rather than what it want,;; 
to hear. 
The Anderson difference is 
unmi.stakable.

A learning experience 
Dear J<..'ditor: 
Last Fridav, TlJe Observer· 
criticized the· platform written 
for the ND-SMC Republican 
Mock Convention. I agree that 
the platform is tO> conservative 
and not an accurate reflection of 
the feelings of the members of 
the ND-SMC community. It is a 
ba,;;is for debate on the i.;;.sue.s 
for Thursday night at the 
convention. 
Bur a., a member of the 
committee which wrote the 
Platform, I urge everyone, e,;;­
pt:cially tllf' delegates to the 
upcoming convention, to read 
the platform. I al.>o urge 
cor~ment orJ the platform; it i.s, 
m fact, the duty and right of the 
delegates at the convention to 
amend the platform Thur,;;day 
night. 
I .strongly urge delegate,;; who 
do not agree with the platform 
to offer amendment..> and speak 
during the debate. Thur.sday·is 
an important night, because 
that is when we will discover 
how this community really feel.> 
about the issue,;;. And once we 
understand the issue,;; we can 
m~xe responsibly. choose a no­

The Mock Convention i.s a

THJ; FIGHTING .IRISH 
an Observer sports supplement 



Hot Irish hope m.om.entum. contunuesuntournar.nent 
by Mark Perry Sports Editor 

For the seventh straight season the Notre Dame basketball team begins its annual quest for the national cham: pionship this Saturday, as it begins play in the Midwest Regional of the NCAA tournament. Although the Irish aren't sure of their opponent for the 
3:23 CST contest, coach Digger Phelps is confident that they are ready to face anybody. 
"I feel like we're heading into the tournament with good momentum," Phelps notes. ''Knocking off top-rank­ed DePaul at home and beating Dayton on the road, a place where we usually have trouble, has to help our confi­dence. 
"We're probably playing our best basketball of the season right now. We feel we're at the top of our game, and that's exactly where we want to be when the NCAAs starts.'' 
The Irish will face the winner of tonight's Missouri-San Jose State contest. Although Mizzou is the heavy favorite, the Irish will have a chance to look at both teams in this first-round contest. 
Missouri heads into tonight's game with a 23-5 record, and is ranked 16th in the final Associated Press poll. The Tigers won the regular-season crown in the Big Eight Conference with an 11-3 mark, but were upset by Kansas in the semi-final game of the confer­ence post season tournament. 
In addition to losing the tourney, the Tigers lost the services of forward Curtis Berry, their leading rebounder 
(7.5 average) over the season. 
Berry slipped in last Friday's game, tore cartilage in his left knee, and underwent sur~ery Monday morning. Berry, an All-Btg Eight team member, also averaged 14.4 points to rank second on the team in scoring. 
Berry's absence will put additional pressure on freshman sensation Steve Stepanovich. The 6-11 center, who was heavily recruited by Notre Dame last season, leads the Tigers with a 14.9 point scoring avergae, and was picked as the Big Eight Newcomer of the Year. 
Sophomore Ricky Frazier and Mark Dressler will handle the forward spots. Frazier had the best field goal percen­tage in the Big Eight (.638), while Stepanovich, Berry, and Dressler stood in the next three spots. The Tigers rank first in the country with a .573 shooting average, and should break UCLA's record of .55 5 set last year. 
Senior guard Larry Drew-the Tigers' career leader in games played, games started, and assists -anchors the backcourt. He has started 101 consecu­tive games, and is currently scoring 
12.9 points per game. Freshman Jon Sundvold fills out the starting lineup at guard, scoring 6.5 ppg. 
The Spartans of San Jose State, under the guidance of first-year coach Bill Berry, own a 17-11 record, and made the NCAAs with a 94-68 win over regular-season champion Utah State in the Pacific Coast Athletic Association post-season tournament. 
Seniors Wally Rank and Mickey Jackson lead the team in both scoring and rebounding. Rank, a 6-6 forward, is hitting 16.4 ppg, while Jackson, a 6-7 forward, has an 11.3 average. Arthur Graham, a 6-8 junior, mans the center spot, and has an 8.4 scoring average. 
The guard spots are manned by junior Michael Mendez (7. 5 ppg) and senior Dan Sullivan (3.6 ppg). 
The Irish have been healthy lately ­the main reason behind their strong finish -but head into the tournament with sume minor injuries. Forward Kelly Tripucka has a minor back sprain, a problem earlier this season, and also has some partially-torn tendons in his right thumb. Center Gil Salinas has a sprained right ankle and a bruised thigh. Both, however, are expected to play this weekend. 
"We are very excited about being in the tournament," Phelps concludes. "We have a tough road to the finals, but every regional will be tough. I still think there are 14 or 15 teams that could take the whole thing. I think we are one of those teams. 
"We're just going to go out and play the best that we can and see if we can shape our own destiny."

Paxson Searly maturity aids Notre Dame 
by Paul Mullaney Assistant Sports Editor 
There were only five seconds left against UCLA when John Paxson pulled up, 18 feet from the basket, for a jump shot. The shot didn't fall, but Paxson drew a foul on the Bruins' Rod Foster. The Irish, who were trailing by one point, took the lead as Paxson calmly sank his two free throws. The Paxson, in only his fifth collegiate game, stole the subsequent in bounds pass. He was fouled again, connected on two more free throws, a,nd led his team to a dramatic 77-74 victory in what Notre Dame coach Digger Pvelps considered his team's first "power game" of the year. 
That scene was no fluke. Paxson, a 6-2 rookie guard, has consistently demonstrated the same "veteran" instincts throughout the 1979-80 sea­son. Nineteen points against David­son, a starting berth against Manhat­tan, crucial driving layups against DePaul and Dayton ... all have shown that Paxson's performance this season has been anything but '~beginner's luck.'' 
During the regular season, Paxson logged 428 minutes of playing time and scored 119 points -the highest in each category for Notre Dame'.;; non­starters. He also ranks second to Rich Branning as the team's assist leader with 59. 
Not bad for a mere youngster, who just nine months ago ~raduated from Archbishop Alter Htgh School in Kettering, Ohio. 
"Before I came to Notre Dame," says the freshman guard, "I really wonder­ed what it would be like playing with the likes ofa Kelly Tripucka or a Tracy Jackson -playe_rs that I had watched for years on television.'' 
Now youngsters around the country are watching Paxson on television, and they're seeing more and more of him. 
"I've really felt comfortable lately," he smiles. ''Things have worked out very well. I'm happy."­
Things weren't always so rosy for Paxson, however. He really had to struggle in his first few months at Notre Dame. 
"It was really hard for me at first," he argues. "And I'm not just saying that to say it. During my senior year of 

Irish freshman John Paxson has proven that his performance this season has beenOn the ball! anything but "beginner's luck." He has scored more points and played more minutes than any other non-starter. ­
high school I hardly ever studied. That  was just the way it was. You didn't have to. 
"But when I came here, it was like I was out ofpractice. If you didn't study, you were in deep trouble. It was tough on all three of us freshman players. It seemed like a two-sided world basketball and academics -and there was time for nothing else.'' 
One would think Paxson won't worry about his studies on Saturday. The Irish will open tournament action in Lincoln, Neb., and the youngster from Ohio will be in the thick of the action. And he sees his team's chances as very positive. 
"We've really been pro~ressing well," he says. "It started agamst San Francisco, when we first started showing some intensity. You could see it in each other's face 
"When we got it going both ways -on offense and defense -like we did against Frisco and DePaul, we really look good. We're starting to peak, and I think it's at the right time. Just so we keep it up." 
And as long as John Paxson keeps it up, Irish fans can keep smiling.

East Regional 

There are several things that the Eastern Regional of the NCAA Tourn· ament should be noted for. 
1. Balance 

2.The number of teams that could win it. 
3. !\s rnatlV Notre Dame opponents (four) as th(" other trree regions combined. 
The East has traditiona.lly produced a number of upsets, especially in the cournamem's early rounds. Remember a year ago when the unsung heros from Penn and St. John's met in the finals, while highly touted Duke and Norrh Carolina sat at home and watched on TV? The 1980 field presents vast potential for a similar championship game. 
Any one of eight reams has the fOtential to advance to the Final Four, with the Maryland Terapins (23-6) bt>ing the most likely choice, at least on pa~y·r. 
Ot' Notre Dame's five losses this season, four came against schools in rhe 48-team field. Only San Francisco (current!}' on NCAA probation and unable to participate) is missing. Among rhose four schools to beat the irish, Marquette (18-8) and North Carolina State (20-7) are in the East. T"'-'O rh:m,..r m!"'rnh,..ro;; of th" Tr~ry Jackson Fan Club, Villanova (22· 7) and 
\.1aryland, also find themselves in 1 his braeket.

Mideast Regional 
All year long, coache.s aero.;.; the 
country belly-ached about Kentucky 
having an opportunity to play regional 
.semi.; and fi"nah on their home floor. 
So what happen.;? The NCAA, in it.s 
attempt to achieve the mo.st balance 
po.s.sible, .seed.; Kentucky fir.st in the 
Midea.st Regional. That'.; the regional 
which will be concluded at Kentucky'.; 
own Rupp Arena. And who .said 
politic.; and athletic.; didn't mix? 
I .;rill can't figure out the logic in that 
one ... let alone the ju.stice. Someone 
mentioned that they (whoever the 
cu!prit.s are) were worried that it would 
be difficult to fill Rupp Arena'.; 22,000 
.seat.; if rhe home team wa.sn't there. 
Nice try. 

I don't think anyone (except Joe B.) 
would object to placing Loui.sville in the 
Midea.st (it'.; only a .stone'.; throw from 
Loui.sville ro Lexington), and .sending 
the Wildcat.; to the midland.;. It 
certainly wouldn't hurt attendance. 
And be.side.s, with Indiana and po.s.si­
bly Purdue having good .shot.; at 
reaching the regional .site, who can 
worry about filling the .stadium. Both 
Hoo.sier .school.; have good following.;, 
and it'.; not a long ride to Lexington. 
(It'.s a lot .shorter than it i.s to Lincoln 
or Houston). 

Bur mavbe it'.; all immaterial, .since 
the Wildcat.; won't make it to the Final 
Four anyway. Coach Bobby Knight'.s 
Indiana (20-7) .squad i.s a new team 
with the return of Mike Wood.son. 
Wood.son, who.se return after back 
.surgery i.s .somewhat miraculou.s, 
make.; a difference of night and day. 
Hi.; mere pre.sence on the court i.s quite 
uplifting to the Hoo.sier.s, who were 
fltrting with mediocrity ju.st a few 
month.; ago. 

Additionally, Wood.son'.; return ro rhe. lineup lighten.; the load for fre.shman .sen.sation I.siah Thoma.;. Tse guard from Chicago wa.s beginning to show sign.; of rookie wear until Wood.son reappeared on the scene. 
All of that, plus Indiana'.; dramatic ovenime win over Ohw Stare last Sunday in the Big Ten'.; title game, make.; Indiana the emotional favorite. So emotional that even Adolf Rupp l'an 't do anything about it. 
The \X'i!dcats (28-'i) will be rough, h<>\\Tv(·r Thev ,hou],J have li:rl~ uou!Jie wnh 'either Florida Statt (21-7) or Toledo (23· 5) in their tourney opener (which, by the poor luck of the draw, has ro be played in Bowling Green, Ky.). Once on it's home: <.ourt, Kentucky wJII beat Duke (22-8), and then fall to the Hoosier.;. 
Purdue (18-9) and Western Kentuc­ky (21-7) also received home-court advantage.; for fir.-;r and .second-rou.1d games. The Boilers will hold uff a tough LaSalle (21-8) club at Mackey Arena in West Lafayette, anr:l then knock off 13th-ranked St. John'.; (24-4). But once the 20th-ranked team of Lee Ro.se has to move away from hnme, it will fall prey to Woodson and Companr. 
Western Kentucky ho.st,:; Virginia Tech ( 19-7) in first-round a,:tion, and .;hould advance to host the Hoo_;;ier.s. That's when the Hiltopper.;' (what a name!) season will end. 
Indiana, Sports Illustrated's pre­_.;eason favorite. may just make the magazir·e look a_;; accurate a.> it wa.s two year.; :.go, when it picked both Notre Dame in foothall and Kentucky in ba.;;ketball.

TheIrish Extra Thursday, March 6, 1980 -page 9 



No tomorrow in Notre Dame's second season 
A3 Notre Dame prepare3 to make it3 17th appearance-in the NCAA tournament, I think there'3 a few thing3 that have to be mentioned. 
Traditionally, the Midwe3t Regional ha3 been con3idered the "cakewalk" regional of the tourney. The perennial powerhouse conference3 (the ACC, Pac-10, SEC, etc.) have alway3 3ent their champions to the Ea3t, We3t and Midea3t, respectively. Marquette, complete with 3even los3es, came from the Midwest to win the national championship in 1977. Chance3 are they never would have made it out ofany other regional. When Notre Dame made their premier journey to the Final Four, they also-were the Midwe3t entry. 
Thi3 year, however, the Midwest bracket isn't theat ea3y. Notre Dame will mo3t likely have to face team3 such as 3econd-ranke9 loui3ville, No. three LSU, 15th-ranked North Carolina or 16th-rated Mi33ouri before heading for the promised land in Indianapoli3. A lot of expert3, nevertheless, believe the Iri3h could have fared wor3e. I, for one, think they could have done a lot better. 
Take, for in3tantce, Kentucky. All 3ea3on people feared the Wildcats would win the SEC conference tournament and wind up playing the regional games in their own Rupp Arena in Lexington. Well, they 
lo3t the title to LSU, but they still got the number one 3eed in the midea3t. You have to almost wonder who Joe B. Hall payed off this time. 
Or DePaul. Every Chicago 3port3 writer took offen3e to the Demon3 being "3hipped" to the Far We3t to try and earn another berth in the Final Four. 
"The number on team deserves better!" they 3hrieked in Monday'3 tabloid3. The number one team doesn't realize how lucky they are. Ray Meyer'3 3quad will be out there 3oaking up the 3un and drinking the blood of back-up conference team3 that almo3t made the grade, but not quite. Joey Meyer'3 daily diary will probably include a weather report to keep thing3 intere3ting. 
But let's talk about the Iri3h. Digger Phelp3 claim3 
indifference to the 3quawb about which team3 got 
the ea3y draw3 and which one3 got the 3haft. 
"When you get into the tournament you forget 
about every team but the one you play next and 

Frank 
LaGrotta 
your.self," he declared after a less-than-illustrious practice ye~terday. "a lot of team3 will be watching the thing on television. All we asked for is an invitation and we got one. Whether Cit" not wet win, it i3 totally up to us." 
Preparing for the first ~arne in the tournament (a game, incidently, that D1gger has never lost in six attempts) is no easy task becau3e, until tonight, Notre Dame will not know who they're going to play.SanJose State will face Missouri for the right to play the Jrish on Saturday, and while practice includes strategy for both teams, the smart bet atthis point is the Tigers. 
Mi3souri is led by Big Ei~ht Freshman of the year, Steve Stipanovich and the Ironic implication3 of him facing the Irish are plenty. The 6-11 center leads his team with 14.9 points and 6.5 rebound3 per game and he has been the catalyst in Mi3souri' s jump from a nothing team to a tournament contender. But I promi3ed some irony, and the fact that Digger heavily recruited Stipanovich 3hould provide plenty of that, plus .some pretty good new3paper article3 if the two teams were to meet. But Digger isn't worried. 
"I know we're going to need Woolridge, Salinas and Andree badly if we .should happen to face Mi33ouri," he 3aid. "Rebounding will be the key and I have confidence that any one of our center3 can do the job on him." 
But getting down to bra33 tacks, the real key to thi_;; game, and "very game the Iri.>h play before the clock 3trike3 12, just might be Kelly Tripucka. Tripucka i3 on what gambler3 like to call (and bet on) a "hot 3treak." With 3even 3traight 20-point game3 to hi.> -credit, No. 44 ha3 been nothing 3hort of sen3ational 3ince returning from a back injury that 3idelined him for a four-game stretch midway 
(continued from page B) 
have three legitimate NBA first round draft choices in the lineup -Herb William3, Kelvin Ran.>ey, and Clark Kellogg, 3till a fre3hman of untapped potential. Coach Eldon Miller also ha3 quality at the forward spot with Jim Smith. who has 3aved hi3 be3t ball for the end of the 3ea3on, and at guard with Carter Scott. They can be awe3ome. They can be un3toppable. 
Mo3t coache3 ,.;ay the Buckeye3 have 
the be.>t talent in the country. Granted, 
rhe Big Ten 3chedule is a brutal one, 
hut Ohio State has been throwing 
games away. Big lead..; against Wi_;;­
:un.,;in (rwtce) and Indiana in the 
second half fell apart with .>ome stupid 
r·t ilnical fouL, and ~ lot of one-c>n-('ne t·~.:: Cheir ~alenl ~-:.; c·.ln.~tderable, but if the buckeye-s are to be 3ucces3ful, they mu.,;t do it in spite of them3elves ­must take 3ome re3pon3ibility for Ohio State3'3 bonehead 3treaks. 
The Buckeye3 3hould du3t off Arizona State, after the Sun Devils de3troy Loyola (Cal)., the weake3t team in the regional 3emifinals. Both teams can and like to run. On the board3, the team3 are even. However, Jim Mit­chem, at anything les3 thatn 100 percent, mean3 trouble for DePaul. 
The individual things to watch for will be the performance3 of players like Skip Dillard and Carter Scott. Tim Smith is every bit a3 strong as Mark Aguirre and could make the All-A­merican work harder for his points rhan he did in South Bend. This g<,me will be close Ir seems, however, th.>.t DcPauJ' s bubble is destined ro burst. Herb Wiiliam3 will give Terry Cum­ming_;; a les3on in the pivot, and career come to an end in Tuscon, Arizona. If Tedd Grubb3 cannot keep pace with Kellogg, DePaul'3 problems will be compounded. It's tough to bet again3t Aguirre, but Ohio State has the advantage in super3tar material. One word of caution, though, all the talent in the world will not help Ohio

Since then, Tripucka ha3 averagerd 21.8 point3 and 7. 7 rebound3 while 3hooting at a phenomenal .637 ctp from the field. He 3howed him.>elf a3 a player to be reckoned with against DePaul la3t W_edne3day when he had 28 point3 and should have been named the game'3 Mo3t Valuable Player. (I think there 3hould be a rule again3t Chicago 3portswriters stuffing the ballot box. Maybe they only came to the game to vote for Mark Aguirre?) 
Since it 3eems Digger ha.> mellowed on hi3 "liberal sub3titution" policy, you have to believe that Tripucka will be in3trumental to any 3ucce33 Notre Dame achieve3 thi3 3pring. Phelps' critic3 have alway3 charged that in a big game or a ti~ht 3ituation, the Irish have no one to look to for 3conng puch or the clutch ba3ket. At thi3 point Tripucka certainly 3eem3 able to fill that role. 
And ofcourse he'll have help from Tracy Jacbon.

Trick, Van Halen, and practica.!ly any other band that comes from Califor­nia or the Midwest, have gone for a more commercial sound, The Clash have still maintained and perhaps enhanced the raw sound of their first album. The Clash perform a rock' n' roll .found in the streets, not in the studios. However, not only is this great guitar-based rock'n'roll -the lyrics are good, too. The Clash have one of the few bands that don't advocate a "Let's Party!" or "Let's Screw!" attitude to life. You may wonder why they don't and some­times I wonder, too.

Scott Spencer READING SA1URDAY MARCH 15 4:00 PM MEM. LIB. AUD. Editor's note: The article below did not run ;,. yesterday's SIP preview owing to space limitations. The Sophomore Literay Festival begins this Monday and continues through Sa'*rf:Jay, .'Wirch 15. Teen-age love is a topic about which authors have written for years, but few with the flair of Scott Spencer in his novel Endless Love. The transition from absurdity to romantic seriousness is accomplished with ·the finesse of a gymnast doing a floor exercise. The tempo changes the mood of the story without missing a beat or startling the audience. It is the summer of 1967; David Axelrod is soon to enter college at Berkeley. He is a middle-class, Chicago teen-ager who has just been banished from his girlfriend's home by her parents, who think the .couple's romance needs to be cooled off. In order to get back into the parents' favor, David sets fire to their house in the hop6s of rescuing them from their dire fate-which he just happens to notice as he is passing through thet neighborhood. The trouble arises when the fire begins to get out of control and the Butterfields are unwilling to leave. Reason? The Butterfields have been tripping together on LSD. Luckily, David is able to get them out unscathed. Then again, maybe he isn't so lucky after all. Hugh Butterfield has him tried for arson and eventually placed in a mental hospital from which he is not paroled until three years later. Spencer does not treat David as an immature, compulsive threat.to society, but rather as an intelligent, sensitive boy in love.. His rash beha.vior is brought on not by the confusion within him, but by the mass confusion that exists in the world of which he is a part. The Butterfields, for example, attempt to dampen David's passion for their daughter Jade; however, they allowed him from the start to stay overnight, and, indeed,even bought Jade a double bed so that they could be more "comfortable." The symbolism is evident in the waspish name of "butterfield"; he is a conventional physician and she a writer for The New Yorker who together just happen to he into open sex and drugs. As the story continues, David breaks parole in order to search for his eternallove,Jade. He finds the Butrerfields in New York where Hugh spots him and, in an attempt to run after him, is killed by a car. After the funeral, Jade and David have a passionate, all-night reunion, and soon after enter a communal student rooming house in Vermont. Jade soon .discovers the details of her father's death, and calls the police, who take David away. He is committed to various mental hospitals where he hears of Jade's eventual marriage and move to Paris. He then turns into a dedicated erotomaniac, taking part in, wild li~isonswith several fe.male inmates. Afte~ seven years (a lucky number?), lie IS released, and begms to make a new hfe for htmself. In the end, he writes an imaginary letter to Jade:· It is night and I am alone and there is still time, a moment more. My arms open wide, 1'\ot to embrace you, but to embrace the world, the mystery we are caught in. There is no orchestra, no audience; it is an empty theatre in the middle of the night and all the clocks in the world are tickmg. The world may be "mad," but David Axelrod surely is not. Scott Spencer creates in him a character at whom we laugh at...one moment, and for whom in ne next vre find flurcdv.es feeling lhe utmost sorrow.

Science reprieves saccharin 
BOSTON (AP) --People who 
drink artificially sweetened soft 
drinks and use other food 
containing saccharin face little 
or no unusual risk of developing 
cancer of the bladder, two new 
studies conclude. 

A .,rudy of 1,118 people, conducted at the Harvard school of Public H:ealth, is the latest in a series that fails to show any broad link between the controvershtl sweetener and bladder cancer. 
A similar study of 367 blad­der cancer patients by the non-profit American Health Foundation, to be published in the Journal of Science on Friday, reaches the same con­cluc;ion. 
"Taken together, the results to date support the conclusion that the use of artificial sweet­eners is not an important risk-factor for bladder cancer," the Harvard researchers said. 
The reviews were undertaken after scientists discovered that large doses of saccharin cause bladder cancer in rats. D!et drink bottlers mu.st label their soda with warnings of the lal:. animal results. 
Despite the latest findings,a federal cancer expert urged that nondiabetic children and pregnant women avoid sac­charin. 
The Harvard doctors were not sure why saccharin makes rats sick but not humans. They speculated that the reason may s1mply be that rats are different from people. Or lJ!jYbe sacchrin is such a slow-acting cancer cause that its bad effects have not yet appeared. 
Sacchann has been widely used since the 1960s. The researchers noted that it took 30 to 50 years for health officials to spot the danger when some occupational hazards caused bladder cancer.

Treatmentoffers hope 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -Human t~.sting of a drug which eases the .symptoms that often accompany cancer treatment could resume this summer, a medical reseracher says. 
Plans call for the synthetic drug Nabilone to be given each month to 10 patient.> at the Indiana University Medial Center who are undergoing chemotherapy for cancer of the testicles, sa1d Dr. Lawrence Einhorn, a profe.ssor at IU Medical School. Later the drug could be given to patient.> with other forms of cancer, he said. 
Einhorn said he learned of the tentative June targrt date from Dr. Paul Stark, a re.searcher for Eli Lilly & Co. who i.s involved in developing the drug. 
Lilly, one of the world'.s 
largest pharmaceutical com­
panies, .stopped all clinical 
te.sting of Nabilone in January 
1979 after it proved toxic and 
sometimes fatal to dogs during 
long-term experiments invol­
ving large doses of the drug. 
Russ Durbin, a spokesman for Lilly, confirmed that th~ company i.s hopeful of .pro­ceeding with tesung on humans this summer. But he :said the final decision hinges on tests on laboratory monkeys, whose­metabolic response to Nabilone closely resembles that of humans. 
Lilly researchers said the principal side effect.> of Nabilone arc drowsiness, temporary light-headednes.>, and a drop in blood pressure when the patient gets up.
