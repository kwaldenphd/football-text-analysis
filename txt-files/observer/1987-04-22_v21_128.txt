An Tostal marks end of year but also onset of new season 
An Tostal has arrived, once again, to the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's community. This traditional event always marks the end of yet another year. 
To some, this year has been long and boring, but to others time seemed to fly by much too rapidly. I can remember last year's An Tostal just as if it happened yesterday. 
The freshmen aren't experiencing this strange feeling of time passing right under their feet yet, but this year's sophomores, juniors and seniors are beginning to meet with the dif­ferent challenges next year will offer. 
Granted, I'm only a sophomore and still nineteen. Most people would agree that I'm too young to start waxing philosophical and com­plaining about the years which seem to be creeping upon me. Perhaps these authorities are correct in their assumptions. 
But still, it's hard to believe that a few very good friends of mine are preparing themselves for their senior year while I'm trying to get used to the fact that in a few weeks I will no longer be an underclassman in college. The week before Easter break one of my junior friends, Sally Brownlee, commented that she wished time could stop right now. Sally also said she couldn't believe she was going to be a senior next year. She seemed to be voicing a cry common among many juniors. 
Knowing that in one short year (and the older I get, the shorter the years seem to be), I'll have to say goodbye to these friends bothers me a great deal at times. Please don't misun­derstand me. I'm not going to spend the majority of my junior year stewing over the impending farewells, but this situation may bot­her me at times during the next year. 
Before I end up depressing people to the point of no return, it is important to remember that for every time there is a season. The transition periods and changes that everyone has to go through can be difficult, but they are necessary. 
A good example of this necessary change oc­curs most noticeably during childhood. Every kid hates the day the Christmas tree goes down, and most parents use the universal line (or at least mine did) that if the tree never went down, then summer would never come. At Labor Day the opposite line is used, if the summer never ended, Christmas would never come. Most kids fall for these lines, and they even find comfort in these wise, old sayings (at least I did). But it was and is true that winter had to end for summer to come again, and each season had its own advantages and fun times. 
While many of my friends may be leaving their teenage years, they are entering a new and exciting part of their lives. Becoming junior or a senior represents a new stage in a person's life, but just as each season offers unique and different advantages so does each new stage. 

It's hard and frightening to look to the end of college, but it's important for upperclassmen to remember that there is life after college. This next stage should not be as dreaded as it often times is. 
The greatest fear of the future is the fear of the unknown. Not knowing what I'll be doing, where I'll be doing it and how I'll be doing are some anxieties I occasionally face when I think about what my life will be like several years from now. The future is probably not as scary as most students think it is, but college students have to realize that life will never be the same again. The world is waiting for us, but it has its positives and negatives just like life does now. 
The most difficult part about the end of the year, An Tostal time, is that students have to learn how to let go of an old year and sometimes old friendships. Even though An Tostal represents the end of another school year, it also celebrates the coming of summer and the beginning of a new year.

'Distinguished Student' named 
By JIM RILEY News Editor 
The Notre Dame Alumni Association has named the recipient of its Distinguished Student Award for 1987. 
Jennifer Lynn Crawford,. a pre-med major from At­lanta, Georgia, was named the award-winner after being selected from a field of 55 nominations. 
The winner of the award is chosen on the basis of three criteria, according to Maria Miceli, assistant director of the alumni asso­ciation. The criteria are ser­vice to Notre Dame, service to the community and good academic standing, she said. 
"She's excelled in all the areas that make her a com­plete person," said Miceli. 
She said the unique aspect of the award is that it doesn't recognize just academic achievement or just service work as do many campus awards. Rather, the award

award)."  

The association will pres­ent the award to Crawford at a May 8 luncheon. A.fter receiving the award, she will give a speech to an audience comprised of her parents, the selection committee members, and representa­tives from the 187 alumni clubs. The representatives will be in South Bend for the alumni senate. 
Crawford said she will at­tend Harvard Medical School after she is graduated from Notre Dame. She said she is cur­rently interested in cardiol­ogy. "But that may change once I'm exposed to new areas of medicine in med school," Crawford said. 

SMC student activities fee to increase 
By DEIRDRE FINN News Staff 

An increase in next year's student activities fee was an­nounced by the Saint Mary's Programming Board in a meeting Tuesday night. 
"The fee will be raised to two dollars per semester, giving the student government an es­timated six thousand dollar budget," said Smith Hashagen, Vice President of Student Af­fairs. 
"The increase will give stu­dent government the opportu­nity to have more quality events next year," said Has­hagen. 
"We have not developed a formal budget yet," said Has­hagen, "but the money will be used for guest speakers, hall and class dances, and other special events." 
Activities for Thursday's An Tostal picnic at Saint Mary's were outlined by Lisa Lawler, Traditional Events Commis­sioner of the previous student body administration at the col­lege. 
"Canoe races, bicycle races, and three legged-races are scheduled," she said, adding, "There will also be Jello fights and the balloon toss." 
A Twister Tournament will be one of the newer events at the picnic, said Lawler. "We don't have enough students at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame to compete for the Guinness record," she said, "but it should still be a lot of fun." 
Saint Mary's is sponsoring another picnic, "Party on the Quad," the following Saturday, May 2, according to Hashagen. In addition to food and refresh­ments, this festival will feature the live entertainment of the rock groups "The Law" and "Freudian Slip," she said. 
"This gives the students an opportunity to relax before finals week begins," said Has­hagen. 
Commenting on the recent April 15 election run-offs Has­hagen praised the forty­percent voter turnout. 
"Things went really well this year," she said. "Even the run­offs had an excellent turnout."

12:04 a.m.: A Fisher Hall resident reported the theft of his bicycle from outside the Engineering Building. At the time of the theft, the bike was locked with a U-shaped lock, which, according to the manufacturer, can­not be cut even with a bolt cutters. Since the lock was only secured around the frame and tire and not locked to a stationary object, however, It is believed that the bike was carried away.

P.O. Box Q 
Activities abound on campus for students 
Dear Editor: 
How many more times will the adage "There's nothing to do at Notre Dame" be uttered in the hopes of justifying an­other "lost weekend?" Mter reading Mark McLaughlin's editorial concern­ing the lack of activities available to Notre Dame-St. Mary's students, I wonder if perhaps Mr. McLaughlin and I are on different campuses. In my mind, that weekend was not a "lost weekend," but one in which so many alternatives existed that someone could not possibly participate in all of them. On campus alone, the number of oppor­tunities available could not be counted on both hands ... Peter Thorpe Blues Band, Collegiate Jazz Festival, Beaux Arts Ball, The Bottom Line Band, Fis­her Hall Regatta, Mud Volleyball, Chicago Trip, Mr. Stanford Contest, 22 Cave Gods Band, Sophomore Siblings Weekend, Bookstore Basketball, "Top Gun," and Theodore's. 
In just one weekend the various or­ganizations on campus; Student Gov­ernment, HPC, the Classes, SAB, and Clubs; have appealed to the musical, cultural, athletic, and social needs of the Student Body. Granted these diverse events may not appeal to all, but to say the needs are not being met is a misnomer. 
If an enjoying evening of jazz or dan­cing to a live band is not appealing, then look for something else, perhaps in the South Bend community. Van­lines, currently sponsored by Student Government, runs to and from Univer­sity Park and Scottsdale Malls. The Morris Civic Auditorium regularly sponsors events. And contrary to popular belief, this area does have some fine restaurants. 

There are a number of activities planned not only for the weekends but during the week as well. Please do not blame the various campus organiza­tions for your lack of social life. We can "spell it out," and do so every weekend with a variety of activities simply waiting to be attended.

Clean-Up volunteers thanked for effort 
Dear Editor: 
On April 11th, fifty Notre Dame stu­dents connected with the Great Hunger Clean-Up volunteered to landscape and clean-up several blocks in the North­east Neighborhood through Neighbor­hood Housing Services. 
By participating in this event, stu­dents demonstrated their concern about South Bend community and about world hunger. They enthusiastically worked to get the job done. In spite of bad weather, the scheduled landscap­ing and clean-up work was completed. Sophia Twarog and the Great Hunger Committee did an impressive job coor­dinating the project. Neighborhood residents helped out with the work. The whole effort gave us a boost in working with several buildings that need rehabilitation work. 
Several blocks in the Northeast neighborhood have been improved as a result of the student's work. Our sin­cere thanks to everyone who helped to make the project such a success.

The Face only a mother could love 
H
ave you ever looked at a picture of yourself taken a few years ago and asked "Why did I wear my pants hiked up so high?" or "How could I have ever parted my hair there?" That's the way I am with my face. 
I guess I was cursed in a lot of ways, but one of the ways I was really cursed was that I have never had a decent photograph taken of me. Pictures of me usually call to mind words like "pinhead," "freak." or "lunatic." A common remark on family portraits Is "Boy, what a nice picture of everybody ... too bad Kevin looks like a reptile... " I was pulled over for speeding once and the officer laughed so hard at my driver's license that he had to let me go. Very funny.

n recognition of his more than 35 years of dedicated service In maintaining high moral and academic standards In all phases of the atheletlc program at Notre Dame, the Snlte Museum's collection of Pre-Colombian ballgame equip­ment and related sculpture from Meso-America will be named In honor of Fr. Joyce this evening at 8 p.m. in the Annenberg Auditorium. 
The collection conststs ot many exemplary pieces of bal­lgame equipment most of which was crafted between 1000 B.C. and 500 A.D. In­cluded In the collection are ball-court markers, a protective yolceh, and ceramic ballgame figures. A recently acquired, fully dressed, masked ceramic ball player dated to I000 B.C. will be added to the collection this evening at the dedication in honor of Fr. Joyce. 
"This piece of sculpture is the best example of its type, in terms of quality and condition, that I am aware of," said Doug Bradley, curator of the Snite Museum. 
The ritual ballgame was played In Meso-America from before 1500 B.C. until the Spanish Conquest when it was outlawed In an effort to remove important aspects of Indian life to speed their subjugation. The game Included elements of modern basketball, soccer, and jal-alal. 

Played In high walled, paved x-courts called "tlachtli," mea­suring 125 feet long and 20 to 50 feet wide, the ballgame is · believed to have provided an outlet for aggression between neighboring villages, as well as figuring prominantly into their seasonal religious ceremony. The gods themselves were believed to have been skilled players in their heavenly courts. 
The number of players varied from two to eleven or more on each team. Despite local vari­ance In the rules, the main objective was always the same: to gain points rather than ground. Thus, the ball was constantly kept in motion and in the air, using the elbows, knees and hips. A team scored most commonly whenever the opposing team failed to return the 5 pound solid rubber ball, and it fell to the court. 
While there were several 
other ways to score, the most 
Important of all goals occurred 
when a player was able to 
knock the ball through one of 
the stone rings, barely bigger 
than the ball itself, set vertical­
ly, high upon the center of 
each of the two long walls. 
Whenever one of these goals 
ocurred (a rare and special oc­
casion), all other points were 
discounted and the scoring 
team pronounced victorious. 
Since the ball was usually not allowed to come into direct contact with hands, feet or calves, and was kept in play with the elbows, hips, and knees, these areas had to be afforded protection. Elbow and knee pads, thigh protectors and gloves were generally sewn from gullded cotton, while heavy belts (called yokes). crafted of leather, basketry, or stone protected the players' waists and kidneys. Many fine Pre-Columbian sculptures, In­cluding the one to be dedi­cated this evening In honor of Fr. Joyce, show ballplayers In an Impressive array of the equipment described above. 
Players were often seriously injured and death was not an uncommon fate for those who took the court. but the laurels for the victor were so great that the obvious dangers were not considered a hinderance. The winners were showered with honors and gifts, while many members of the losing team frequently found themselves being offered as sacrifices to the gods of the winning team. 
Everyone is invited to attend the dedication ceremony tonight in honor of Fr. Joyce's lifetime of dedication to the ideals of this University. Stu­dents, faculty and friends are also encouraged to take the time In the future to visit the new Joyce Collection. 
more ways than one. 
Well-meaning people always try to make me feel better by saying "Oh, come on. Not everybody can be photogenic," as they smile tlteir perfectly photogenic smiles. I resist the urge to throw acid in their faces. 
To ease my own mind, I usually try to come up with a few folks who are less photogenic than I am. I never get past Bella Abzug. John Hinckley, and Jim Bakker's wife, Tamml. This, of course, doesn't make me feel any bet­ter. 
It's just that it seems like the people who are having the. most fun are the ones who seem to be the most photogenic. At least they're always having a good time in the pictures of them. In pic­tures of me I always look like I've just been poisoned and I know it. 
'' The bottom line is that I'm about as photogenic as your average urine sample." 
John F. Kennedy was photogenic. You always see him laughing on the beach or horsing around with his kids, and it looks good. I guess this means that I'll never be one of the beautiful people. They wouldn't let me In Camelot with my photo portfolio. 
Of course, the more I think about it, this really limits me. I could never be a politician. Would you vote for The Face? Would you trust your tax dol­lars to The Face? After what Nixon did? No way. Even I wouldn't. I could never be a TV newscaster. The Face staring out at millions of television viewers every night at 6:00 would be sure to cause at least nightly panic, if not a few grisly deaths. 
It also depresses me that The Face limits other peoples' 
'my current incarnation' looks a lot like Satan." 
memories of me. I bet there's somebody's parents out there today sitting In their living room going over old pictures wondering who the 6-year-old with the sex degenerate's smile was and why they let him play with their son. "Well, whoever he was," I hear them saying. "from the look on his face here I'd guess that he's a seriously deranged multiple felon today if he's even alive." Years from now, there will be some girl with a picture of me at a dance wondering what could have possibly possessed her to come within miles of The Face. 
Even my memories are lim­ited to my family's pictures, to a certain extent. In pictures I progress from a formless blob of drooling fat. to what my own loving father once described as "a miniature Winston Chur­chill." I go from a punchdrunk baby trying to learn how to walk. to a big-eared buck­toothed goof In an oversized baseball hat; from an adoles­cent geek with a big head and 12-lnch nostrils, to a short­haired high school grad with Charles Manson eyes. And, fi­nally, now, we have my current incarnation. 
Unfortunately, "my current incarnation" looks a lot like Satan. Satan Is probably much more photogenic than that. 
You might think that I've been exaggerating a lot in this column, but the proof is right here. What you're holding in your grimy little hands is a per­fect example of The Face In action. It's the kind of picture you might see under the heading "Ex-Marine Goes On Killing Spree" or "Manhunt On For Retarded Child Molester." Most weeks, that picture is the funniest thing about my column. 
Someone once told me that the Indians believe that every picture taken of you contains a piece of your soul. This is obvi­ously false. Somehow I know that my soul Isn't that beastly.

Irish rip Bethel, 10-1, extend winning streak 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
After strangely starting the 
year by playing over .500 on the 
road and going 0-8 at home, 
things returned to normal for 
the Notre Dame baseball team 
last weekend. 
The Irish lost two games at 
the University of Detroit, 3-2 
and 6·2, on Saturday, then 
swept a doubleheader from St. 
Joseph's, 6-3 and 6-5, at Jake 
Kline Field on Easter Sunday. 
Notre Dame won another home 
game yesterday with a 10-1 rout 
of Bethel College. At 12-20, the 
Irish put a three-game winning 
streak on the line in a 
doubleheader today against 
Western Michigan, beginning 
at 1 p.m. at Jake Kline Field. 
"Western Michigan is an ex­
cellent team," said Irish head 
coach Larry Gallo. "It's a big 
rivalry for us. They beat us 
twice by one run last year, and 
we beat them twice the year 
before." 
Notre Dame will try to make it five in a row at home after yesterday's win against the Bethel Pilots. A four-run out­burst in the third inning and steady pitching from Mike Cof­fey and Dirk Madden led the Irish to a 10-1 win. Coffey al­lowed only one earned run and six hits in five innings of work to raise his record to 2-1. Mad­den pitched four innings of hit­less relief to earn his first save. 
The Irish offensive attack also was in full force yesterday. 

Notre Dame amassed sixteen hits, as Dan Peltier, Chris Flynn, Scott Rogers, Tim Hut­son, and Mike Moshier each had two hits. 
The Irish started the winning streak against St. Joseph's on Sunday. Notre Dame came into the doubleheader winless at home, but it came back from a 3-1 deficit to score five runs in the last two innings and record its first home victory, 6-3. 
Shortstop Pat Pesavento was a star for the Irish, with two runs and three hits, including his tOOth career hit in the third inning. Mike Passilla went the distance on the mound to raise his record to 2-3. 
In the second game, Flynn had three RBI's on two hits, in­cluding a game-winning home run in the fifth inning. Flynn has rebounded from an early­season slump to record seven hits in his last 15 at-bats, in­cluding three runs and seven RBI's. 
Irish starter Tom Shaw got his first collegiate win in the second game, and Mike Har­mon came on in relief to earn his first collegiate save in the 6-5 win. 
"If at the beginning of the season," said Gallo, "you told me we'd be 12-20, I'd say you were out of your mind. But any way you slice it, that's what we are. We just have to accept it and get some wins together. We're on a mini-winning streak now."

date, was incensed at the referees' inability, in their view, to keep the game under control in the first half. Though SOMFAW led 11-8 at half, the crowd remained belligerent toward the referees, and when Carte Blanche rallied in the second half to take an 18-15 lead behind Tony Rice's nearly flawless outside shooting, Bookstore 10 was on the verge of a riot. 
But that was just the begin­ning. With the score 18-15, Carte Blanche's Mike Haywood was called for a tech­nical foul for intent-to-injure on a breakaway. Haywood ap­parently didn't injure Pat Sul­livan on the play, and he didn't stop him from scoring, either. On a technical foul, the basket counts on the foul, the fouled

at 18 and complete the three­

Carte Blanche managed to reach game-point at 20-19, but Pat Marget calmly canned a IS­footer to knot the score again. Three baskets and several con­troversial calls later, Joe Auer buried a jumper to finish the scoring. 
The Corporate Raiders eliminated Jus' Tofu, 21-16, knocking off one of last year's final sixteen entries. The Raiders shot a sterling 21-of-34 from the field and neutralized Tofu's inside game. After Matt "Bingo" Hanley pulled Tofu to within one at 17-16, the Raiders took control and did not miss a shot the rest of the way. 
Also, Da' Brothers of Man­hood, who fought off the Killer Bees, 28-26, on Wednesday af­ternoon, survived another scare in the form of Verkler's Construction yesterday. Da' Brothers escaped, 21-19, but were surprised by Verkler's who, behind Jim Dolan's 11-of­19 shooting, nine rebounds, and 11 blocked shots, finally seemed to reach their peak in stretching the highly favored Brothers to the limit. 
In other action, Minahoonies chilled Heat Miser, 21-14, as Steve Antinelli poured in seven points; Put It In the Hole, Chief scored a surprisingly easy 21-12 triumph over the Ball-Headed Freakdaddies; Terry Andrysiak shot 8-of-9 as 5 Really Cool Guys blasted Playing on the Veranda, 21-16; Tequila White Lightning con­tinued to roll, impeaching All the President's Men, 21-10; Leone's Stallions cruised past the East Side Runners, 21-15; and Party at Chips When We Repeat looked impressive in shooting down Air Doggers, 21­7.

ND soccer t<)ps Lewis 
By PETE GEGEN 
Assistant Sports Editor 
The Irish soccer squad fi­nally returned to the great out­doors Tuesday afternoon for a scrimmage with Lewis at Stepan North field. 
Notre Dame played well overall in the 3-1 victory over the Chicago-based college, but the players admitted is was dif­ferent playing outdoors after spending six months on astroturf and playing in two in­door tournaments. 
"I just have no feel for it," said Irish stopper Johnny Guig­non in the first half. "We've been indoors for so long." 
The Irish started the scoring in the first half off a restart. Forward Randy Morris chipped the ball from the left side to midfielder Kevin Kade, who trapped the ball in front of the Lewis goalie and passed it to wingback Sean Fieber, who knocked it home. 
Irish forward Tiger McCourt gave Notre Dame a 2-0 lead when he scored off a feed from midfielder Rolfe Berhje. 
Lewis tallied in the second half on a direct kick just out­side the goal penalty area. But the Irish put it away when Berhje centered from the right corner to Guignon, who fed Morris. Morris dribbled in and scored from 10 yards out.

Hogan and Andre fought an epic battle last March 28 in which Hogan retained his belt. 
The bout was added to a card which features a tag-team championship match between the Hart Foundation and the British Bulldogs. Ricky 'The Dragon' Steamboat will defend

pass which found Tony Eason in the corner of the end zone on his first drive of the day, ending an impressive 70-yard march. Two plays earlier, Andrysiak had hit Reggie Ward cutting across the middle for a 25-yard hook-up on a second-and-18 play. 
The No. 2 quarterback slot, however, is still up in the air at best. Pete Graham and Steve Belles have been sharing time calling the signals with the second unit, as neither appears to have won the position out­right. 
Graham was 5-of-9 for 36 yards in the third scrimmage, while Belles finished 1-of-4 with 38 yards. 
"We've been a little inconsis­tent behind Terry, but I think we should be able to move the football fairly well," Holtz said. "I know we're going to make some very good plays, and now we've got to eliminate some of the bad ones." 
Andrysiak's other two touch­down passes included a 38-yard dump to Alonzo Jefferson down the sideline and a four-yard connection with tight end Tom Byrne. 
Another plus for Holtz' offen­sive unit was the return of star flanker Tim Brown. Brown missed the first two scrim­mages because he was at track meets, but returned last Thursday in familiar form, picking up 81 yards on the ground. Included in those was a 66-yard touchdown on a reverse pitch. 
"A lot of things happen when he's out there," Holtz said. "He's a great talent and he opens up a lot of things for other people with the things he does. 
"I thought Alonzo Jefferson (42 yards rushing, 38 yards re­ceiving, three touchdowns) played the best I've seen him play since I've been here." 
Jefferson also scored on 
pitches from nine and six yards 
out. Aaron Robb sprinted out­
side on a third down from the one-yard line to complete a 65­yard drive skippered by Belles, and freshman Anthony Johnson rounded out the scoring with a three-yard run on the last drive of the day. 
Defensively, freshman linebacker Mike Stonebreaker led the team with 13 tackles and also recovered a fumble. Greg Hudson and Darrell "Flash" Gordon also recovered fumbles for the defense. 
"Fundamentally, I look at how well we're executing," Holtz said. "Offensively, we have to eliminate the turn­overs, but I thought we moved the ball well. Defensively, we might have digressed slightly. You never like to see big plays on defense. 
"Considering the numbers, I think we've made a lot of prog­ress this spring. We've still got some problems, but overall I'm pleased. We've kept people healthy and that comes with a good attitude and good fun­damentals.''
