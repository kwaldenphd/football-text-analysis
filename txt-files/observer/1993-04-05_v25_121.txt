Ngobi: Sanctions ensure US lacking world order and security firm policy 
By NANCY FENOCKETTI 
News Writer 
Sanctions facilitate the pursuit of individual goals in an atmosphere of security and peace, according to James Ngobi, Secretary of the United Nations Security Committee, the keynote speaker of Friday's "Economic Sanctions and International Relations" conference. 
Essentially, "the idea of sanc­tions is as old as the oldest hu­man society," and sanctions carry out the vision of the founding fathers of the UN. They are the last resort before the use of force and, in princi­ple, "punishment at the na­tional level," said Ngobi, a citi­zen of Uganda and graduate of Oxford University. 
The purpose of sanctions is to insure peace, security, and good order in the society concerned, he said. 
The UN accomplishes these goals through the establishment of an individual committee for each situation, made up of fifteen members whose ob­jective is to monitor and rec­ommend how sanctions can be made more effective. 
In addition, this committee passes onto states information to help them investigate sanc­tions violations and allows them to use such measures as are necessary to halt and inspect vessels and insure these sanc­tions. 
However, "small powers feel inhibited against taking ac­tions," said Ngobi. 

Editor's note: The following two stories are the first in a four-part series examining the initial committee reports of Colloquy for the Year 2000.

Colloquy for the Year 2000 is an attempt to look at where ND has been and what the vision is for the year 2000, according to Patricia O'Hara, vice president for Student Affairs. 
"It is important to receive input from several different constituencies on that vision," she said. 
The Colloquy has been a very productive process, involving people from all different constituencies within the University, according to O'Hara. 
A 100-member colloquy of faculty, staff and students has spent the past 18 months de­veloping a report to assist Notre Dame's transition to the year 2000. The final report will be presented next month to the University's board of trustees. 
The colloquy will "seek to re­view the present reality that is Notre Dame and, bearing in mind its distinctive Catholic mission and heritage, identify the most appropriate steps to take to realize our vision for its future," said University Presi­dent Father Edward Malloy.

cording to Malloy. 
A 25-member committee of the whole is responsible for planning and organizing the colloquy and for writing its final report. Malloy chaired the committee, which also included O'Hara, Provost Timothy O'Meara and Executive Vice President Father E. William Beauchamp. The committee's membership is a cross section of the University's students, faculty and staff, including the leadership of the faculty senate, undergraduate student government and the Graduate Student Union. 
Each member of the commit­tee of the whole also will serve on one of four committees ex­amining a particular facet of University life. Malloy headed the committee on mission, op­portunities and challenges; O'Hara chaired the committee on student life; O'Meara headed the committee on aca­demic life; and Beauchamp chaired the committee on fi­nances, University relations and athletics.

South Africa is a good ex­ample of that because we are afraid of a powerful future regime developing there, but are unsure about how much progress towards nuclear ar­mament they have made, Mil­hollin said. 
When Brazil and Argentina wanted to obtain nuclear power, it took a small amount of international pressure to get them to stop, according to Mil­hollin. 
Milhollin lists Pakistan and India among the most danger­ous countries because they have no experience in a large­scale war, they have nuclear power, and they want more of it. 
"In the eighties, we gave In­dia breakfast, lunch, and din­ner," said Milhollin. 
Another area that has been kept under a close watch lately is North Korea, according to Milhollin. If North Korea launched an attack on U.S. forces in South Korea, the U.S. would not retaliate with any sort of sanctions, but would in­stead use conventional warfare, he said. 
In general, it is too early to tell how well America's present policy on sanctions towards nuclear arms is working, but it should be changed to the "bombs-or-breakfast" theory as soon as possible, according to Milhollin.

eyes of Notre Dame's Father, Son and Holy Ghost) will be unable to control themselves, and will find it necessary to make whoopee a lot. All the time: before and after 2 a.m. on weekends and midnight on weekdays. But parietals are not the problem. Those who value parietals more than they value everyday contact with the opposite sex should be able to remain in single-sex dorms. However. privacy is just about all that parietals offer. Of course, "valuable" male bonding occurs during the Keenan Revue or the Dillon Pep Hally, but it resembles frat hazing more than genuine camaraderie, and generates the sexism that we are trying to leave behind as shameful history. If Notre Dame offered the option of co-ed housing, she would begin to combat this sexism on a new front-the breeding ground. Like an exterminator who moves in to destroy the place where insect larvae mature, Notre Dame could attack the system of hierarchical sexism that exists openly in male dorms. By dismantling this structure. the University could begin to stop the sexism before it starts. And by dismantling the archaic structure o single-sex dorms, the university would embark on a new kind of education for her male and female students-an education in how to communicate with one another. This is the fundamental problem with Notre Dame's lack o co-ed housing: that men and women spend far less time together than they must after leaving the University. Where else are men and women more strictly isolated from one another than they are at Notre Dame? Nowhere, except in cultures far different from our own, high school locker rooms, and novels about seventeenth-century New England. And in each of these scenarios, intersexual communication makes more sense than it does on this campus. Only in this environment does an institution which claims to educate send its men and women into adulthood without a pragmatic understanding of how to communicate with hal of the people that they will work with throughout their adult lives.

A review of architecture stu­dents schematic proposals for improving the Notre Dame campus was conducted Friday morning by Liam O'Connor, an instructor at the Prince of Wales Institute of Architecture. 
The purpose of the review was to offer students the oppor­tunity to exercise their knowl­edge on ideas for the campus. 
"We thought this would be a good theme for Notre Dame students to work with," said Professor Thomas Smith, ar­chitecture department chair. 
Some students focused on the area to the south of the main entrance to the University and on the new quad near DeBar­tolo Hall. Other students fo­cused on the stadium, the Per­forming Arts Center, and the area between the two. 
The proposals are part of a hypothetical project. Members of the administration and Uni­versity architecture staff were present at the review, but the designs were not created with the intention of being built upon, according to Smith. 
Students and faculty re­sponded to the proposals and made recommendations for improvement. A final review will be conducted April 27 at 
10:30 a.m. in the school of ar­chitecture.

King memorials focus on future 
(AP) -Twenty-five years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s words were silenced by an assassin's bullet, civil rights leaders reminded a ra­cially charged nation Sunday that King dreamed of a land where children will not be judged by the color of their skin. 
In the past year, racial ten­sions have erupted into violence in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta and New York. 
"It seems sometimes that we take two steps forward and three back," said Elisa Gilham, 63, a trustee at Ebeneezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where King was a co-pastor. 
King was shot April 4, 1968 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn., where he was staying while in town to organize a sanitation workers' strike. James Earl Ray is serving a 99­year prison sentence for the killing. 
One of the largest of Sunday's tributes took place at Mason Temple in Memphis. where King gave his last speech the night before he was killed. 
"We have not overcome," Mayor W.W. Herenton, who became the city's first black elected mayor in 1991, told some 4,000 people. "We still have racism, bigotry, poverty, joblessness, homelessness and greed." 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was with King at the Lorraine, said at All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena. Calif .. that

733) to "reduce the intensity of the factions fighting"; and in Liberia and Cambodia in November "in an endeavor to restore central authority and world order in a country in­volved in a civil war for two years," according to Ngobi. 
Most recently, on March 31st, the Security Council authorized the use of force in Bosnia. Ngobi said there is a possibility of using sanctions on both sides of the Bosnia conflict. 
if the nation had learned the lessons of the 1960s civil rights movement, the Los Angeles riots wouldn't have occurred. 
Americans still haven't learned the danger of "having large segments of society with no stake in it," he said. 
Later, Jackson told a rally in nearby Los Angeles that Presi­dent Clinton should have an aid program for U.S. cities like the one proposed for Russia. 
"The same plan to rebuild Moscow ... must apply to re­build America," he said. 
Jackson also called on Clinton to hold a town hall meeting in South Central Los Angeles be­fore the verdicts are reached in the city's racially charged fed­eral trial of four white officers accused of beating black mo­torist Rodney King. 
When the officers were ac­quitted of similar charges after a state trial last year the deadly Los Angeles riots followed, starting in South Central Los Angeles. 
At another tribute to King on Sunday, children in New York City were asked to commemo­rate his call for nonviolence by turning in their toy guns at a rally near the United Nations. 
"Those of us who love peace must organize as effectively as the war hawks," Mayor David Dinkins told the rally.

On Aug. 28, 1963, King told marchers in Washington. D.C., of his hopes for the future. 
"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character," he said. 
But a poll published Sunday found 52 percent of black re­spondents believe race relations in the United States are the same or worse than they were in 1968. Forty-five percent thought things had improved. Among whites, 42 percent felt things were the same or worse and 54 percent felt things were better. 
Sixty-six percent of blacks and 55 percent of whites said race relations were generally bad, while 27 percent of blacks and 38 percent of whites felt race relations were good. 
The New York Times-CBS News poll of 1,368 adults was taken March 28-31 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for whites and 6 per­centage points for blacks. since fewer blacks were interviewed.

JASA unites black women 
By GERALDINE HAMILTON News Writer 
The newly founded campus group, "Just a Sister Away"(JASA) is an alliance that brings African American women together to discuss their spirituality and aspects of their life that separate them from the rest of Notre Dame, according to Chandra Johnson, Notre Dame freshman and founder of JASA. 
"The purpose of JASA is for African American women to come together and share their spirituality, goals, communicate and establish a level of sister­hood," said Johnson. 
The University does a great job of recruiting minorities to attend NO, but does not have the capabilities established to assist them when they get here, said Johnson. In response to this, Johnson and a core group of 15 other students organized JASA as a group that would support her as an African American. 
The initial core group met over a month to establish the goals for JASA and to become spiritually connected. 
Another function of JASA is to be a program which reaches out to the outside community. Johnson herself is involved with the "Slice of Life" mentor program. 
"The topics are generally things that separate us as a race and as women," said Johnson. "There are disparities here at Notre Dame that are acute unless you find someone or something that gets you over the obstacles." 
Fundamentally the group is a spiritually based, yet the meet­ings end in a discussion of what is most important to the women, whether it be school­work or relationships with friends, according to Rochelle Stewart, an NO sophomore and core member of JASA. 
JASA has had Hispanic American women attend the general meetings and any member of the Notre Dame community is welcome to sit in on the meetings, yet the issues that are raised primarily con­cern African Americans, said Johnson. 
The goal is eventually to ad­mit African American males into the alliance once the group is more established, said John­son. 
In general the results of JASA have been nothing but positive. 
"The spiritual uplift that I get from JASA I could get from no other group on campus, seeing as it is about African American women," said Stewart. 
"Chandra has brought an element to campus -she has taken on the job to bring us to­gether,"said Stewart. "She's a mother, a friend and a sister when you need her." 
Since the founding of JASA the group as grown tremen­dously. There are now approx-
SMC examines larger activity fees 
By MEGAN BRUCHAS News Writer 
The Senior Officers at Saint Mary's will vote next Monday on the proposed student activity fee increase. 
The Officers will use a survey conducted by the Board of Gov­ernance (BOG) on March 25 as a way of measuring student support for the increase. 
Results of the survey show that 65 percent of the students support the increase BOG has asked for. 
The amount they will ask for is not yet decided, but the Board estimates that it could increase from $40 a year to $120 or $150 a year. If ap­proved the increase could pos­sibly begin the next fall semester. 
Students proposed in the sur­vey that the money go to the following areas: 
Social events-67 percent 
Clubs/Organizations -55.7 percent 
Lectures-53 
percent 

Class 
Boards -46 percent Culture -30 percent Celebration series -27.5 


percent 
"We would like to prevent students from having to pay for dances. For example, the all school dance (held last Thurs­day) cost $6,000. We have been saving for about two years, it would just be nicer to have the money up front for such events," said Tina Carrara, student body president. 
The new proposal may pro­vide movies and dances for free and allow more big name speakers to come talk to the school depending on the amount of increase that is ap­proved. 
"I support an increase, but I can't justify going from $40 a year to $120 to $150," said Kelly Kilmer, Le Mans Hall freshman. 
Many students feel that an in­crease is necessary yet wonder if such a huge increase should happen so fast. 
"If the student's activity fee reflected the quality, diversity and number of activities avail­able to Saint Mary's students, I could understand the increase, however I highly doubt that it will," said Julie Semrow, Le Mans Hall junior. 
"I would support the increase if it's clearly stated and spelled out where the money is going," said Jennifer Paplava, Le Mans Hall sophomore.

Veltsin, Clinton agree on aid 
VANCOUVEH, British Columbia (AP) -Clinton and Yeltsin strode side by side into a convention center hall for the wrap-up to a summit domi­nated by Hussia's need for aid to nurture its reform move­ment. 
.Clinton said that for 45 years the two countries "pursued a deadly confrontation in nuclear arms. Now we can pursue a safe and steady cooperation." 
Said Yeltsin, "We are strug­gling against Communism." 
Clinton said he had asked America's allies "to come forth with their own individual initia­tives" to aid Hussia, and that he and Yeltsin had discussed a co­ordinated effort by the world's seven industrialized nations to help Hussia stabilize its econ­omy and its currency. 
Yeltsin invited Clinton to visit Hussia, a trip the president said last week he would like to make -assuming Hussian reforms survive the April 25 popular referendum. 
The referendum will pre­sumably clarify the political sit­uation in Russia, where Yeltsin last week narrowly survived an form efforts and defending them since. 

Clinton, after a successful de­but on .the international stage, must persuade Americans to support aid to Russia at a time of record budget deficits and stubborn unemployment at home. He said a healthy Rus­sian economy will mean new trade opportunities for Ameri­cans. 
The second and final day of talks focused on national secu­rity and foreign policy issues, following intense discussions Saturday on Russia's crumbling economy. 
Crowds shouting "Bill" and "Boris" cheered the leaders as they arrived at the downtown convention center for their 
impeachment attempt by the meeting and a news confer­legislature and has been ma­ence. Political instincts took neuvering against former over and both Clinton and Communist foes to preserve his Yeltsin walked across the street power. to shake hands.

Clinton's world debut a success 

VANCOUVEH, British Columbia (AP) -All eyes were on President Clinton's debut in the world spotlight -unfamil­iar turf for a young president who campaigned almost exclu­sively on domestic issues. 
Despite Clinton's lack of for­eign policy experience, the first superpower summit to focus on economics instead of arms seemed a made-to-order show­case for the former Arkansas governor's strong suit -an easy command of facts and fig­ures. 
The early review from his summit partner, Boris Yeltsin: "Pretty original." 
Not only was Clinton out to prove his foreign-policy prowess to Americans, but to other world leaders as well. 
As usual, the two-day summit in this western Canadian sea­port was carefully chore­ographed by both sides to put the two leaders in the best light for domestic consumption in their respective countries.

And even though Yeltsin re­mains on extremely shaky polit· ical ground in his home and Clinton faces a daunting sales· manship job on the aid package in his, both leaders left the summit having achieved most of what each wanted. 

For Clinton, that meant being viewed in the eyes of Americans and U.S. allies as a serious leader in the world arena. 
"I think he's handled it ex­tremely well," said Washington attorney Robert Strauss, an elder of Clinton's Democratic Party who was George Bush's ambassador to Moscow. 
Both Clinton and Yeltsin "were two very impressive politicians," said the summit's host, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. 
Clinton came to office with no foreign experience whatsoever and a penchant for criticizing Bush for spending too much time on foreign policy.

Need becomes criteria for college admission 
MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -The American tradition that smart students who work hard can go to any college they desire is go­ing the way of the little red schoolhouse, educators say. 
More and more private uni­versities say they can no longer afford to ignore a prospective student's finances when making admissions decisions. 
At Tufts University, which sent out acceptance letters last week, officials denied admission this year to some otherwise­qualified students who could not afford the tuition and did not qualify for scarce financial aid. 
"It became apparent that, for a small number of these stu­dents, it would be an empty gesture," said David Cuttinow, director of admissions. 
Long proud of their need­blind admissions policies, even elite and Ivy League schools may soon close the door on qualified applicants who can't afford to pay. 
With the price of four years at a prestigious private college now exceeding $100,000, it is not only poor students who are being frozen out. 
"A number of schools have been doing their best to meet the need of all students regard­less of their circumstances, but this has been a dwindling number," said Richard Rosser, president of the National Asso­ciation of Independent Colleges and Universities. 
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which lost an antitrust case last year over its practice of sharing financial aid information with competing schools, argued it was only this cooperation that allowed the group to accept all qualified candidates without regard to income. 
"The only way we can main­tain need-blind admission is if there is not a wide-open bid­ding war," said MIT spokesman Ken Campbell. 
The same argument will be 
part of the university's appeal of the ruling, scheduled to be heard in May. 
One Ivy League school, Brown University, admits needy applicants on a first-come, first­served basis. The policy has been the subject of protests from students, who complain it has a disproportionate effect on qualified minorities. The university says its relatively small endowment limits the amount of aid it has available. 
Other schools that claim to have need-blind admission nonetheless deny financial aid to some of the students they've accepted, effectively preventing them from coming. 
Cornell University last week canceled a plan to ration finan­cial aid for next year's freshmen because the need was not as great as first predicted. Still, four percent of admitted stu­dents are on a waiting list for scholarships. 
Tufts ran out of financial aid last year, and 30 students were denied admission because there wasn't any money left. 
"Students should be admitted to the best college in which they can compete, predicated only on their academic ability, not their economic status. That's always been the tradition in this country," said John DiBiaggio, president at Tufts, where undergraduate tuition, room and board will cost $24,962 next year. "But that certainly is going to be endangered at many institutions." 
A survey of 3,500 high school seniors last month by the Na­tional Association of College Admissions Counselors found 29 percent hoped to go to a four-year, liberal arts college or university, but only 17 percent thought they would. The major reason: cost, which has eclipsed location, academic reputation and social life as the No. 1 reason for choosing a college.

permissive indeed. But the greater number appear to me to desire a stable lifelong rela­tionship just like heterosexuals (sit down if you must), and sin­gling out youths for pure sex is clearly not in accord with such a goal. 
Child abuse is an issue apart from homosexuality, which leads to my next point. I contend that child abusers suf­fer from some emotional disor­der and are in need of thera­peutic help. Of course, Dr. Reisman attributes like charac­teristics to anyone who happens to be gay and declares that all gays are "in pain." Funny. but I know plenty of homosexuals who lead a perfectly happy life, have never sought psychiatric help and manifest no need to do so. 
I also express amazement be­cause quite a few of my hetero­sexual friends have received counseling of some kind, and two of them were so much "in pain" that they attempted sui­cide -one succeeded. Likewise with the substance abuse and AIDS arguments. The one per­son with a drug problem that I have personally known (for which she was hospitalized) was heterosexual. 
If you include alcoholism I have known a multitude of people with such a problem. And while I have personally remained unaffected by the AIDS crisis, I had been assuming along with an over-
consultants, whose counterparts in the orient or in Ireland work for less. 
The ball is loose; who wants it? 
The best corporate reports on my coffee table give the investor a sense of an internal balance of contested vision of the corporate future. They provide assurance that the likelihood of a palace coup resulting in fragile. narrow specialization is small. But not one talks about more good jobs. The Colloquy's concurrent comment? A "tempered vision." Downsizing to match downsizing? An increased contingent workforce? More "visitors?" more full time adjuncts at $10K -, per annum? 
The precious fear that ques­tions concerning our Catholic character may not be raised a decade from now ignores our continuing "lace curtain" indif­ference to Notre Dame's ex­ploitation of a large segment of its own workforce. Our gradu­ates won't learn the importance of "solidarity" until they find themselves unemployed. 
Our Catholic character is deeply contested; there are significant rival visions con­cerning its content. To pretend that these divisions can be re­duced to quotas or bureaucratic procedures enforced at the top is innocuous nonsense. 
This is a University in deep need of living icons whose ex­amples inspire our work. Louis Putz, C.S.C., Ernest Sandeen, Matthew Fitzsimons are a few I can mention because I no longer see them regularly. We need to contest our Catholicism. not quantify it. The Colloquy for the Year 2000 is innocuous in 1993. Where is the Abbott Leibowitz when we need him?

eaceFes+ '93 
Campus bands 
to promote world harmony 
BY PATRICE MILLER 
Saint Mary's Accent Editor 
This Wednesday, Stepan Center will transform itself from the usual conference hall into the cite of the World Peace Action Group's PeaceFest '93. 
The PeaceFest is being held as a charity fundraiser for two local area charities, the !lope Rescue Mission, and Teens Inc. All of the money that is raised will be split equally and then donated by the World Peace Action Group to the charities. 
PeaceFest '93 will be highlighted by a concert. Five campus bands will perform. This year's groups are Grope for Luna, Mr. Head, Chisel, bother, and Severinsen. 
Colin Clary, from the band Severinsen, said the reason that their band is playing in Peacefest is, "it is for a good cause, plus I like to play." 
PeaceFest '93 is the culmination of a year's work by the World Peace Action Group. This is the only event that they sponsor. and they spend a year planning and preparing for it. 
The World Peace Action Group was started during the Gulf War and was supportive of non-military action, according to Elizabeth Trigg, a member of the group. They have continued now with a broader and more global view. 

Last year's PeaceFest was the first and they hope to continue the new PeaceFest tradition, Trigg said. 
The two charities, the Hope Rescue Mission and Teens, Inc., will both have representatives present at the concert. The representatives will be handing out literature and will answer questions about their organization for anyone in­terested. 
The Hope Rescue Mission is a local homeless shelter and is a non-profit organization. They take people in off of the street who are in need of shelter. They also provide other services such as. dentists, doctors, they help them find work, and they provide counseling, if needed. 
Teens Inc. is also a non-profit organization that has been helping the underprivileged since 1919. They work with children and sponsor Camp Ray Bird which is a summer camp for

teenagers with problems. Altt~r the summer camp they set up a pen pal program so the children are able to stay in touch with each other. 
The World Peace Action Group decided on The Hope Hescue Mission and Teens Inc. to receive the proceeds based on the fact that they have not received anything from any other campus organization recently. 
According to Lisa Fortman the co­chair of PeaceFest '93 said, "The World Peace Action Group is a campus group that was organized to promote peace. World peace is something that we should all try for, and making a small difference is better than nothing at all." 
"PeaceFest of 1993 should be fun and it's for a great cause", Fortman said. 
The cost for tickets is $2 and will only be sold at the door. The doors will open at 7:30 pm, but the first band will not begin to play until 8 pm. The festivities will last until 1 am. 

Rare Irish maps broaden students' horizons 
By KATIE LEHNER 
Accent Writer 
Irish maps and sea charts are featured in two collection now available in the Rare Books and Special Collections department of the Hesburgh Library. 
Thomas McGrath, together with his wife Betty, donated two collections. one of Irish sea charts and one of Irish maps, to the University of Notre Dame Libraries in 1991. Last Monday, McGrath visited the University and spoke on "The Joy of the Chase: Collecting Old Irish Maps." 
"Like novels, maps are exciting, image producing segments of our culture," said McGrath during the speech. 
McGrath went on to compare his fascination for the maps for a chase. "To have a chase you need both a hunter and his quarry. I was 
'To have a chase, you need 
both a hunter and his quarry.' -Thomas McGrath 
the happy hunter who so enjoyed chasing 
down his quarry of old Irish maps," McGrath 
said. 
McGrath attended Notre Dame for one year while waiting to be called up for active duty in 
-
the United States Navy. In spring of 1945, he left Notre Dame in order to go through Navy boot camp up at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. lie then entered the United States Naval Academy from which he graduated in 1950 to serve during the next four years as an officer in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets. It was during summer training cruises that McGrath first began gathering his collections of old maps and sea charts. He originally would try buying maps from all the various 
countries he visited, but found that it was more financially sound to limit himself to maps and sea charts which showed Ireland standing alone, not as part of Great Britain or of Europe. 
McGrath said he chose Ireland because "I am of Irish blood. I studied at Notre Dame, and Ireland was unique in that it remained for centuries the westernmost land known to the ancients." 
The maps which have been donated to the University date from 1567 to the mid 1700's and were given in memory of Mrs. McGrath's father, David Butler, "a native Irishman who . loved this school." The twelve sea charts of Ireland date from 1584 to 1759 and were donated in memory of McGrath's parents, Thomas and Helen McGrath. 
The collections include maps made by some of the greatest map makers of all time, includ­ing Gerard Mercator, Benedetto Bordone and John Speed. 
In addition to their geographical character. the maps also hold a whole collection of beautiful artwork. Seas were full of monsters and sailing vessels, and land was complete with little castles or towns drawn in. "The illustrations constitute material as rich for teaching and research as the geography of the maps themselves," said Robert Burns, profe 
"These early printed maps were far more richly illustrated than the geographical and road maps familiar to us today," said Notre Dame rare book librarian Laura Fuderer. "Most of them have been hand-colored and have engraved pictures of coats of armor, ocean animals, tall ships, and other objects." 
One may see some of the old maps and sea charts hanging in the reading room of the Rare Books and Special Collections de­partment of the library. The department is located on the first floor of Hesburgh library. For more information, call rare books librarian Laura Fuderer at 1-5610.

Thomism 
at Notre Dame  Fall, 1993 
The philosophy department at Notre Dame is nationally ranked and world class. Among other things, it has, over the years, been noted for its oontributions to interpreting and teaching the thought of St. Thomas Aquinas. 
It is not often clear what courses among the many excellent offerings in philosophy are designed to serve that interest. A brochure providing descriptions ofthe Fall courses which are Thomistic in inspiration has been mailed to Freshmen and Sophomores. 
Ifyou have not received the brochure, ask for one at either the Philosophy Department, 337 O'Schaughnessy or the Jacques Maritain Center, 714 Hesburgh Library.

Irish earning recognition

Now that Notre Dame's lacrosse team {8-0) has solidly secured their position in the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association's (USILA) coaches' poll, the question arises as to whether the Irish are commanding enough re­spect from their peers in the lacrosse community.

"Th·e east coast schools all have very tough schedules, not to say we don't have one, but the Midwestern teams are tra­ditionally considered weaker by the polls," said sophomore midfielder Kevin Lynyak. 
For that reason, a lot of the players on the team believe the rankings are a fair representa­tion of where the Irish stand in relation to the rest of the coun­try.

Again Georgetown responded with a goal of their own, but Colley and sophomore mid­fielder Kevin Lynyak scored to push the lead to 9-5, before the Hoyas added another goal right before halftime to make the score 9-6. 
In the first half, the Irish ef­fectively neutralized the big­play capabilities of Hoya stand­out Chris Remington as sophomore Mike Iorio, Notre Dame's best defender, had him blanketed. Sophomore goalie Ryan Jewell also played effec­tively, turning away numerous Hoya opportunities that were created by slick off-ball cuts by their midfielders. 
"The defense played well by sliding and backing up each other all afternoon against middies that got open a lot and attackers that were good crease players," said Jewell. 
The second half was marked by tough, aggressive play by both teams at midfield as the middies battled for ground balls and rode hard, refusing to al­low either team to easily main­tain possession. The game saw numerous hard hits as both de­fenses did all they could to keep the ball out of their offensive

end of play. 
In the third quarter, neither team scored until halfway through when junior midfielder Billy Ahmuty's low shot from the top of the box made it 10-6 in favor of the Irish. 
Georgetown, however, re­fused to go away, as Mike Boyle tallied two scores around a Randy Colley goal, to make it 11-8 after three quarters. 
But Corrigan's plan for run­ning a lot of people in and out of the lineup paid off as the Irish were fresh for the final quarter, a quarter in which the Hoyas turned up the intensity and pressure on the Irish de­fense. 
"They were really aggressive, especially on ground balls, try­ing to keep the ball in our end. They pressured all over the field with a 10-man ride, and tried to turn the game into an unorganized one in which their middies could create a lot of chances," Jewell said. 
But the Irish responded like a top-ranked team by winning more ground balls in the quar­ter, thus securing more pos­sessions. But the Hoyas refused to quit, and after Doug Madden scored with six minutes remaining, Georgetown was within two, 12-10. 
Colley answered the Hoya challenge with a goal 51 sec­onds later that all but secured the Irish victory, and the Irish defense wrapped up the victory with a suffocating performance that denied the Hoyas the op­portunity to score again. 
In summing up the team's performance, junior midfielder Willie Sutton said, "A lot of dif­ferent guys played well out there today, we came out and played 60 minutes of steady lacrosse."

"We have to move on," said Rugby Club president Mark Babka. "He always gave 100 percent and he would want us 
to do the same.  We can't let  
up."  
Only  close  family  and  

friends have been able to visit Broski in the hospital, where he will remain in intensive care for an indefinite period. 
Despite his condition he re­mains in good spirits. 
"We finished the games after he was injured," Knowl­ton said, "and when (Rugby coach Jay Nash) saw him at the hospital, one of the first things Broski asked was if we won." 
They did, 10-8 and 8-7. But the biggest victory has yet to be won .

SMC softball splits a pair 
By JENNIFER GUSTAFSON 
Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
The Saint Mary's softball team opened regular season play this weekend by splitting a double-header with North CentraJ College. 
The Belles had complete control of game offensively and defensively, as they easily defeated the Cardinals, 7-1. 
After giving up one run in the first inning, freshman pitcher Michelle Umb limited the Cardinals to only seven hits. 
"I was a little nervous and anxious for my first game. but once we got through the order. 1 got a feel for the hitters and felt stronger as the game went on," she said. 
Coach Don Cromer was pleased with Limb's perfor­mance. 
"Michelle pitched a real good first game," he said. "Her placement is improving and she is getting stronger each game." 
Umb had a lot of help from the rest of the defense, who eliminated many of the errors that had been present going into the games. 
"We eHminated a lot of the mental errors," said Cromer. "Everyone knew where to go, but there were still some times when we were not thinking." 
A four run seventh inning by the Cardinals was the deciding factor in the 9-6 defeat of the Belles In game two. The Belles attempted a come back in their half of the inning but stopped with one run, leaving three stranded on base. 
"We had a few errors in the game, but they also had some timely hits and we missed some opportunities," explained Cromer. 
Hitting was a strength in both games for the Belles who out hit the Cardinals 11­7 in the first game and 11-9 in the second. Amy Misch reached base seven times in nine attempts and scored three runs, while Seanne Patrick hit two triples and Shannon Heise contributed three RBis and four runs. 
Cromer was optimistic after Sunday's performance. 
"The freshmen are getting stronger each game and I think that we'll be tough this year," he said. 
Limb agreed, adding "We're excited about this year. Everyone feels comfortable playing together, especially after Florida and now our first game." 
The Belles will use this experience tomorrow as they travel to Concordia College.

Women's tennis smashes Texas A&M 
By RIAN AKEY 
Sports Writer 
After beating Texas A & M Friday afternoon at the Eck Pavilion, the Notre Dame women's tennis team may have had a desire to trade their tennis racquets in for brooms. That's because the win over the Aggies gave the Irish a seven-game sweep in their two week homestand, pushing the 23rd-ranked Irish's dual match record to 13-6. 
Notre Dame's thumping of Texas A & M was the latest in a string of one-sided victories. During their home streak the Irish have outscored their opponents 57-5. In Friday's match against the Aggies, the Irish did not drop a set winning 9-0. 
At number-three singles, Notre Dame junior Christy Faustmann won her twelfth match of the last fourteen, upending A & M's Wilson Pate. Faustmann cruised through the first set 6-2, then fought ofT a Pate rally and chugged to a 7-6 (8-6) second set victory. 
"I'm usually a slow starter," Faustmaun admitted, "and I've been working on trying to get rid of that. Today, though, it was kind of opposite. I came on strong and faltered a little bit in the second set." 
"In the first set I was really focused and I set up my shots well, but in the second set she [Patel came on a little bit." 
Faustmann and Pate each held serve 
throughout the second set to reach a 6-6 tie. In the tiebreaker, Faustmann got ahead early 2-1, then stumbled to a 2-4 deficit before rallying to the 8-6 win. 
"Those last few points were all mental," she said. "I played a few good, aggressive points and was able to pull it ofT." 
While Faustmann dismantled Pate at number three, freshman Wendy Crabtree was busy claiming her second upset of the week, a solid 6-3, 6-4 win over 47th­ranked Janine Burton-Durham. Crabtree is currently ranked 78th by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. 
"Wendy did a great job of keeping the pressure on," said assisatant coach Maureen McNamara. "She served well and made her [Burton-Durham] do a lot of moving from side to side." 
The win pushes Crabtree's season singles record to 20-8, including a 10-5 mark at number one. 
"Wendy just has so much composure for a freshman," said McNamara. "As she gets more experience it shows even more." 
Crabtree combined with junior Lisa Tholen at number-one doubles to claim yet another upset. The unranked duo breezed past A & M's 28th-ranked team of Burton­Durham and Julie Blackburn 6-2, 6-0. 
Tholen and Crabtree had not played enough matches together to qualify for the last ITA rankings, but should represent the Irish in the April 6 release.

Lacrosse out plays Georgetown, 13-10 

Noonan scored the game's first goal two minutes into the first quarter, the Irish responded with goals by junior attacker Randy Colley and freshman attacker Kevin Mahoney, only two minutes apart. After Ge­orgetown tied the game at 2-2, Notre Dame rattled off three unanswered goals coming from Mahoney, freshman midfielder Brian Erickson, and junior at­tacker Mark Hexamer, who also assisted on Mahoney's goal. 
At the end of the first quarter, the Irish led 5-3, and it was ev­ident that they were outplaying a very highly touted Hoya mid­field that came into the game with the reputation as being very good at creating chances off the transition. 
The Irish used a lot of differ­ent players and lines to combat a Hoya squad that was ex­tremely deep and showed a lot of quickness to the ball. The plan paid off for coach Kevin

In a first-ever battle between top-15 ranked teams to involve a Notre Dame lacrosse team, the No. 14 Irish convincingly defeated the No. 15 George­town 13-10 at Loftus on Satur­day afternoon. It was the first time the Irish have ever de­feated a top-15 team. 
As a result the Irish climbed to No. 12 in the latest United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association's coaches' poll. By becoming the 12th-ranked team in the country, the Irish moved their highest ranking ever, up two notches. 
Saturday's game was touted as one that would really prove whether the Irish were deserv­ing of their ranking because it was the first game of the sea­son against a top-20 team. But the Irish came out and showed the rest of the country that they are, indeed, for real.

Senior Broski injured in Rugby win

Rugby is a sport of courage, challenging its players to dis­play a combination of mental and physical toughness. 
Senior Rugby Club member Todd Broski will need all the mental and physical toughness he can muster to overcome the greatest challenge of his life.

The Observer/Sean Farnan 
Notre Dame,.s wins over the Fort Wayne Men's Club were marred 
Saturday by the severe injury suffered by senior Todd Broski. 
Broski suffered a severe neck injury in Saturday's game against the Fort Wayne Men's Club, and he is currently in the intensive care unit at South Bend's St. Joseph's Medical Center. 
No information as to the ex­tent of his injury or the prog­nosis for recovery was available from the hospital.

ered, although some damage 
three of four from Butler
was done. It will be another day or two before the doctors can make a judgement about whether or not Broski will be able to regain the use of his limbs. 
The injury occurred in a sit­uation known as a ruck, where the forwards fight for a loose ball. In a ruck, the players col­lapse on top of one another, and Broski found himself propped over another person and other players then fell on top of him. 
"It was a freak accident," said sophomore Nick Knowl­ton. "Rugby is a very physical game, but it wasn't one of the more dangerous situations." 
Members of the team gath­ered Sunday at the hospital to offer encouragement to their teammate, known for his com­petitive nature and compas­sionate attitude. 
"(Broski's) always been there for the players on the team," said Knowlton. "I·Ie's known for his toughness. If there's anyone who can get through something like this, he can." 
Notre Dame sports psychol­ogist Dr. Mickey Franco joined the players at a team meeting Sunday afternoon to help them cope with the injury. 
Franco encouraged the players to show support for each other and Broski's family as everyone tries to come to grips with their feelings. 
At the meeting, the team decided to play the three re­maining games on their sched­ule, knowing that cancellation wouldn't speed Broski's recov­

The Notre Dame baseball team (1 0-7) won three of four contests against Midwestern Collegiate Conference rival Butler this weekend in Indianapolis. 
The Irish bats were cold on Saturday with Notre Dame 
notching only 12 hits, but recovered on Sunday scoring 25 runs on 38 hits in the doubleheader. T h e 

Bulldogs won Tom Price the first game on Saturday 3-1 as the Irish could only muster five hits off Butler starter Scott Metzinger who struck out four in the complete game win. 
Freshman designated hitter Ryan Topham (.468) and junior second baseman Greg Layson (.337) led Notre Dame at the plate with two singles each. 
The Bulldogs came up big in the third inning with three runs off Notre Dame starter Chris Michalak. The Irish responded with a run in the fourth, but were shut out from there. 
Michalak ( 4-1) took the loss for the Irish after spreading 12 hits over nine innings, striking out three and stranding runners on third five times. 
In Saturday's second game, Tom Price (2-1) was in control as the junior pitcher walked no one in the seven inning 3-0 shutout over Butler. 
Price face just 24 batters and gave up three hits for the win, but he also had the Irish hitters behind him as senior Eric Danapilis drove in all three Irish runs with a single and a double. llis three H.Bls brings his team-leading total for the season to 24. 
Price was pleased with his performance. 
"I think I pitched pretty well. I pitched real aggressive which I have tried to do recently," said Price who although not overpowering got the Butler batters to hit ground balls. "I pitched inside more. I felt strong and my location inside was good." 
In Sunday's first game, South Bend native Marty DeGraff put a stop to Butler after relieving starter AI Walania in the second inning with the score 8­6 in favor of the Bulldogs. DeGraff (2-0) took the win for the Irish by striking out five and allowing one run in five innings on the mound. 
DeGraff was also helped by the Irish lineup which pounded 19 hits in the game. Freshman Rowan Hichards led the way with four hits, four runs and two runs batted in while fellow freshmanTopham had four HBls on a triple and a single. Both freshmen reached base five times in the game and Hichards took advantage of it with three stolen bases. 
"It seems pretty easy right now. I got off to a good start," said Richards of his success so far. "I know I have a job to do now and I just have to do it."
