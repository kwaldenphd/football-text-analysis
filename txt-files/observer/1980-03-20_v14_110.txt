Lewis accuses Registrar 
ofhampering vote drive 
Laura Lan'more Senior StaffReporter 

As the May 6 Indiana primary nears, County Registrar Coreen 
Wroblewski continues to make student voter registration as 
"difficult as possible," according to Paul Lewis, executive 
coordinator and head of the campus voter registration drive. At 
present, the effort has signed approximately IJO voters of an 
initial goal of 2500. 
After requesting 30 authorized deputy registers and 1500 
registration forms, the Notre Dame group received 4 deputies 
an~ 10~ forms. This. sho~age has. ~eriously hampered 
regtstrauon efforts, Lewts satd . .An addiuonal problem 1s the 
Registrar's stipulation that to obtain one other form, one must 
be turned in. 
"We wanted to blitz the campus, in the dorms and dinin~ 
halls," Lewis explained. "But these problems have made It 
virtually impractical. Ifwe started in the dining hall at 5:00 we'd 
have to stop at 5: 15 when we ran out of forms," he continued. 
The registration drive began last Wednesday on the campus. 
The group has worked one day in the dinin~ hall, Lewis said. 
Lewis stressed that a student can temporarily resign his home 
state registration in order to register in Indiana. ''He could 
reregister at home this summer, in time for the Novemnber 
election,'' he said. 
Lewis cited evidence from Wroblewski that other minority 
groups in South Bend are more fairly treated. The black 
community has 27 deputies and the League of Women Voters 
was alloted 400 registration forms, he reported. 
Wroblewski justified the discrepancy with several reasons. 
The printer of the forms failed to meet the requisition by the 
county, she told Lewis. 
As a second reason, the Registrar challenged student 
residency. "Why does she allow any student registration at all if 
she believes it's illegal?" Lewis responded. According to 
Richard L. Hill, City Attorney, Notre Dame residents do meet 
residency requirements. 
Wroblewski also maintained her office is understaffed. The 
student group is trying to be as helpful as possible with 
registration procedures, Lewis defended.

McCambridge attacks alcohol abuses 
byEariRix 
Academy award winning ac­. tress and confessed alcoholic Mercedes McCambridge chal­lenged a small but entranced audience in an emotional attack on contemporary attitudes con­cerning alcohol and alcohol abuse last night in the library 
auditorium. 
McCambridge blasted those 
who tolerate alcohol abuse in 
their families and among their 
friends. "Nobody becomes an 
alcoholic without the consent of 
the family or the employer. To 
the degree that you tolerate 
intolerable behavior, you are 
responsible for it.'' 
She defined alcoholism as a 
disease and cited medical re­
search supporting biochemical 
predisposttton to alcoholism. "I 
personally believe that it is 
largely inherited,'' McCam­
bridge said. 
A girl in the audience did not 
initially accept the concept of 
biological causation and des­
cribed a friend who ''drinks too 
much because she is lonely.'' 
''What is important is why you drink and what it does to you,'' McCambridge responded. An alcoholic is a person who drinks against his or her best in­terest." To a shocked audience, McCambridge said that the girl who drank to relieve her loneli­ness was indeed an alcoholic. She then accused the audience of "doing a dance around the word 'alcoholic.' It makes us think about how far we have gone in reducing the stigma,'' she said. The questioner was speechless. 
In criticizing the stigma at­tached to alcoholism, McCam­bridge described the acknow­ledgement of her alcoholism before the Senate in an attemtp to call attention to the disease as' 'the roughest morning ofmy life. My disease is as legal as diabetes, under the law. Alco­holism is the only disease where the victim is held re­sponsible if the treatment fails. You will feel sorry for the diabetic and you will throw the alcoholic in the drunk tank,'' she charged. 
"We are eminently salvagea­ble, and well worth the while," McCambridge said about alco­holics. She challenged the au­dience to confront ,their alcoholic friend and to "love that person enou~h to have him hate you for a whtle.'' 
In response to a comment that most people only drink to get comfortable, McCambridge emphasized that "alcoholics start drinking for the same reasons everyone else does. It made me comfortable for a while -it is making you comfor-

House works on balanced budget 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The House Budget Committee got ·to work yesterday on a 1981 federal budget· proposal that includes a $1.4 billion surplus and tax reductions opposed by the Carter Administration at this stage of the war on 
inflation. 
Rep. Robert N. Giaimo, D­Conn., chairman of the House budget panel, presented the proposal with a declaration that rising inflation "makes a bal­anced budget imperative." 
Giaimo's proposal, which will serve as the framework for House budget action, calls for $15.9 billion in new spending cuts, including an end to Saturday mail deliveries and the state share of federal re­vepue sharing. 
In an inflation-fighting move last Friday, President Carter announced a revised version of his spending plan for fiscal year 1981. He called for S13 billion in spending cuts to balance the budget, including a $1.7 billion reduction in the general reve­nue-sharing program that would eliminate aid to states.. 
Administration officials said 
the president has yet to make 
final decisions on most of the 
cuts. 
Meanwhile, House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill, D-Mass., and about a dozen Democratic members of the House Appro­priations Committee met Wed­nesday with Carter to discuss the processing of his spending plan. 
The committee chairman, Rep. Jamie I. Whitten, D-Miss. later told reporters the group urged the president to set broad spendin~ targets and permit appropnations subcommittees to decide the details. 
Asked whether Carter had ~greed, Whitten said, "You

Talks with' Carter 
B~gin, Sailat to visit Washington 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Prime Minister Menache:m Begin of Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt will visit Wash­ington for separate talks with President Carter in April, White House officials announc­ed yesterday. 
White House press secretary J ody Powell, announcing the new move in the b6gged-down talks over Palestinian autono­my, said the dates for the meetings had not been set. 
Powell said the Israeli and Egyptian leaders would visit Washington "to review the 
progress and pace of autonomy negotiations for the West Bank and Gaza." 
''The negotiations are being conducted in accordance with the principles of the Camp David accord," which the three leaders signed in September 1978, Powell said. 
The agreements reached be­tween the United States, Israel and Egypt provided for negotia­tions to settle the question of Palestinian autonomy on the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip, Arab terri­tories occupied by Israel follow­ing the 1967 Middle East war. 
Israel, Egypt and the United States have agreed to accele­rate the pace of the negotiations on self-rule for the 1.2 million Palestinians or the occupied doubtful agreement will be reached by the May 26 deadline 
spelled out in the Camp David accords. 
Begin said Tuesday the talks were stalled on three Egyptian demands -that Jerusalem A­rabs participate 10 Palestinian elections, that the Palestinaia:n government include legislative as well as executive powers, and that Israeli security ar­rangements be a subject for dgreement by the Palestinians. 
In 1978, Carter closeted the two Mideast leaders at Camp David for 13 days until they agreed on two framework a­greements that were honed in~

Soviet music grows soft 
The stirring songs that once 
glorified the toil. of Soviet 
workers -a sort of music-to­
build-locomotives-by -are 
being pushed aside by new 
sounds of soft rock and pop. 
The new tunes mark a swing 
in musical tastes that has some 
ideological officials worried. A 
~eneration ago, famous patriot­
Ic melodies blared out with 
bugles, drums and massed 
choirs were leading instru­
ments of Soviet propaganda for 
the masses. 
The strident ''Son~ of the 
Motherland,'' the tnumphant 
"Boldly Forward, Comrades" 
and a host of others boomed 
from factory loudspeakers. 
They typified the Soviet 
Union's early dears and the 
battles of Worl War II. 
The old songs have held on 
to some popularity and are still 
regulars on radio and tele­
vision. But new composers are 
steadily cutting away at the 
brass band tradition, writing 
instead gently lyrical songs, 
even for patriotic themes. 
And many new songs have 
nothing ideological about them 
at all. 
The national trade union 
paper, Trud, complained in a 
recent editorial that the national 
song repertoire has turned 
increasingly to "songs of love, 
modern versions of gypsy 
romances and light western 
tunes." 
The top songs in Moscow at 
the moment include "Summer 
Night," a soft rock love song; 
the lyrical ''Looking for you,'' 
on a similar theme by top 
Soviet singer Alia Pugacheva, 
and "Summer Rains," a love 
song by Mark Minkov. 
Miss Pugachev' s lusty 
singing covers a variety of 
themes, from love to the 
problems of women in modern 
society to the effect of stardom 
on her own life. 
Revivals of traditional 
Russian folk songs are popular, 
too, as well as rock and pop 
from East European countires. 
Authorities seem to have made 
their peace with rock as a 
genre, including Western 
tunes, which regularly turn up 
on state radio. 
But authorities still call for 
more songs on ''worthy'' and 
"significant" themes. 
One modern pop groul? that 
has received offical pratse is 
the group Pesnyari, one of 
whose members, Leonid 
Borrkevi.ch, is married to 
former Soviet gymnastics star 
Olga Korbut. 
The group has a lyrical song 
extolling the western Soviet 
republic of Byelorussia among 
its hits. 
Another patnottc number, the rock song "My Address is the Soviet Union" by the group Samotsvety, is a dancing hit at Soviet youth cafes. 
The Moscow Summer OlymJ?ics, too, have found their way toto pop music. One contemporary composer in good standing is David Tukmanov, who has a hit called "Olympiad-80." It includes the line, "Welcome to the Moscow Olympics, welcome to Beautiful Moscow.'' 
Despite such songs, Trud complained that many other composers do nothin~ to bring listeners a Commumst spirit, ''not to mention any cultivation of high aesthetic tastes." 
The same issues came up last Novemeber at a nationwide conference of the Union of Composers. A Moscow composer, Eduard Kolmanovsk 
... 

said songs with "deep, signif­icant themes were being forced into the background by light, Western-style tunes. 
Tikhon Khrennikov, the long time chief of the Composers Union, added that"ideological opponents'' of the Soviet Union were trying to make the work of a. ".sensation-loving" Soviet mustctans appear to be a new wave in all Soviet music. 
Young Soviet musicians are full of experiments with advanced jazz, electronic music and new forms of rock. But patriotic music in the very oldest Soviet style -that of the 1920s and 1930s -is still being composed. 
"Day of Victory," a sttrnng song about World War II, composed in 1975 and recorded in a rich baritone with orchestra accompaniment, has become a modern day classic. 
The  old  favorites  are  an  
inseparable  part  of  Soviet  
history.  

One of the most famous, the 1936, "Song of the Mother­land" with music by the late Issak Dunaevsky, includes such lines as "From Moscow clear across the nation, from the southern mountains to the northern sea, a citizen can stride like the owner of his great unlimited country.'' 
Soviet music is still supposed to serve the state and the Communist Party. But its tone is softer now than the blaring hymns to socialism of the past. 
Leboyer method of childbirth reduces labor 
BOSTON (AP) -One method of childbirth tries to soften the shock of entering the world by delivering babies in a hushed, darkened room and bathing them gently in warm water. But a study shows those children are no happier or healthier then those born by more convention­al means. 
The Leboyer approach to childbirth has been adopted by many hospitals since it was proposed five years ago by Dr. Frederick Leboyer in his book "Birth Without Violence." 
The new study, conducted at McMaster University Medical Centre in Hamilton, Ontario, compared 28 infants delivered by the Leboyer method with 26 who began life with "~entle but conventional" delivenes. 
After eight months, there was no difference between the two groups of children, the resear­chers reported. 
The study was directed by Nancy M. Nelson, an epidemio­logist, and was /ubhshed in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. 
The Leboyer babies were de­livered in a hushed labor room lit only by a single gooseneck lamp. 
They were then placed on their mothers' abdomens and gently massaged. Instead of cutting their umbilical cords at once, doctors left the babies attached to their mothers for three minutes. Then their fathers placed them in warm baths. 
''Birth is a tidal wave of sensation, surl?assing anything we can imagme,'' Leboyer wrote in his book. He theorized a gentle transition from the womb to the world would produce healthier babies. 
The Canadian doctors com­pared the health, irritability and responsiveness of the two groups of babies during the first hour of life. Then they repeated the exams after a day, three days and eight months. At the same time, they ques­tioned the mothers about their experiences. 
"Our results suggest that the Leboyer procedure has no ad­vantage over a gentle, conven­tional delivery in influencing infant and maternal out­comes," they concluded. 
The Canadian doctors noted some obstetricians do not want to use the Leboyer method because they object to ''deliver­ing in the dark, delaying the cutting of the cord and bathing the baby." But they said their 
, ,.. ',' 

study shows the procedure does 
not in,crease the risk for either 
the mother or the baby. 
The ;Study also found women who delivered by the Leboyer method spent less time in labor. For the Leboyer women, the first stage of labor -the time from the first contraction until the cervix is fully dilated ­lasted an average of seven hours. It was twice as long for the women who gave conven­tional births, but the doctors attributed this difference to psychological factors. 
The researchers reported the Leboyer method for many wo­men raised "the expectation of a later positive experience,'' making it apparent to the doctors that ''psycholo~ical fac­tors influence the phystcal pro­gress of labor.''

After 3years in office 

Cat·ter fails to halt inflation 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Since taking office in 1977, President Carter has thrown everything but a balanced budget, waj~e and price controls and t 1e kitchen sink at inflation -all without success. 
Now he is trying a balanced budget, which leaves wa&e and price controls and the kttchen sink in reserve. He has said he will not use controls. 
The latest C!rter anti-infla­tion program, announced last Friday, is the fourth in the past three years. Although Carter has said each program should help, inflation has progres­sively worsened. 
As measured by the Con­sumer Price Index, inflation was 4.8 percent in 1976, th:: year before Carter took office. It was 13.3 percent last year, and prices have increased at an annual rate of 18 percent so fa:r in 1980. · 
Here's a look at how Carter has tried to cope with inflation since he has been in office and the results: 
1976 Campaign 
-During the campaign, Car­ter said Congress should ap­prove standby authority for the president to impose wage and price controls. He also advo­cated requiring big businesses and labor to notify the ~overn­ment in advance of pnce and wage increases. However, he dropped both of these ideas soon after taking office. With inflation at 4.8 percent, he said 
~~~~;!!e~~.rity would be fuJI 
jan. 31, 1977 
-Carter proposed a $31 bil­
lion economic stimulus pro­gram that included major tax reductions and a $50 ta:x rebate for Americans--aimed at re­ducin& unemployment--whilo:: commuting himself to a ba­lanced 1981 budget to help control inflation. "This adnu­nistration will never let ilts guard down against inflation, which robs us all," he said. His goal was to reduce inflation to below 4 percent within two years. 
April 15, 1977 
-Inflation was worsening and Carter announced his first anti-inflation program that included a labor-business team to <:O· operate in restraining inflation, plus a hospital cost contain­ment program and pledged anew to balance the 1981 budget. At the same time, he scrapped his ta:x rebate plan as "a mtstake." Inflation was in the 5 percent "to 6 percent range. Carter's new goal was to reduce inflation to 4 percent by the end of 1979. 
jan. 20, 1978 
-Inflation was 6.8 percent in 1977, and Carter announced his second anti-inflation pro­gram that called on business and labor to accept price and wage increases "significantly less" than the average of the past two years. Inflation and unemployment need to be bat-tied "simultaneously," Carter said. He abandoned his ba­lanced budget tar~et for 1981. He forecast a 6.1 mflation rate for 1978. 
Apri/11, 1978 
-In another inflation speech, Carter repeated his call for business and labor to restrain wages and prices, proposed a 
5.5 percent cap on pay hikes for government whtte-collar workers, and named Robert Strauss as his special anti-in­flation adviser. He again ruled ployment as a solution to rising prices. Inflation appeared headed for 7 percent for the year. 
Oct. 24, 1978 
-Carter unveiled his third program, including voluntary wage and {>rice guidelines and a wage msurance plan to insure workers against losses from inflation in return for their cooperation. He hoped to reduce inflation to between 6 percent and 6. 5 percent in 1969, down from an expected 8 
percent in  1978.  He  named  
Alfred  Kahn  to  succeed  
Strauss.  
Nov. 1, 1978  

-Worried about the effect of inflation on the dollar, the administration and the Federal Reserve Board announced a dollar-support operation that included a major increase in interest rates. It appeared the board would spearhead the struggle against inflation by pushing interest rates to record heights. jan. 23, 1979 
-Inflation was 9 percent in 1978, and Carter called in his State of the Union address for redoubled efforts, although he said "It is a myth that we must choose endlessly between infla­tion and recession." However, he said the unemployment rate then about 5.8 percent, proba­bly was too low for a successful struggle against inflation. 

Sept. 28, 1979 
-Carter announced an accord with the AFL-CIO to involve organized labor with his anti­inflation effort. A ~overnment pay advisory councd ~.vith busi­ness and labor participation was established. 
Oct. 9, 1979 
-Carter vowed to support new moves by the Federal Reserve Board to increase in­terest rates. He said he would do "whatever it takes" to control inflation. 
jan. 28, 1980 
·Inflation hit 13. 3 ~>ercent in 1979 and the admmistration forecast 10.4 percent in 1980. Carter unveiled his 1981 bud­get, containing a deficit of $15.8 billion, but said it "en­sures that the federal budget will not be an inflationary force in the economy." For the first time, a presidential budget officially predicted a recession. 
March 15, 1980 
-In an unprecedemed rever­sal, Carter scrapped his J anu­ary budget and said he is developing a new one that provides a budget surplus of as much as $13 billion for 1981. He imposed controls on credit and a fee on imported oil that will raise the pnce of gasoline by 10 cents per gallion. The administration now says infla­tion wiU be just under 12 percent in 1980. A recession is stiU in the forecast. 
Reagan 's successes combine 


NEW YORK (AP) -Ronald Reagan has swept to victory in the Republican primaries by putting the votes of moderates, Independents and middle­income voters together with his hardcore support among the conservative GOP rank-and­file, Associated Press-NBC news polls say. 
Neither Rep. John Anderson nor George Bush has been able to build sufficient support a­mong those groups that hold the key to any possible GOP victory in the general election to defeat Reagan consistently. 
Among the Democrats, the polls say Sen. Edward M. Kennedy is right that President Carter's policies are not getting the endorsement of the voters in the primaries. But while the voters may not agree with Carter's policies, they are clearly rejecting Kennedy in favor of the incumbent . 
In 111inois, the core of Reagan's support came from conservatives, who gave 66 percent of their ballots to the former California Governor, the AP-NBC News Poll of GOP voters on Tuesday found. That was about the same level of support Reagan got from conservatives in earlier pri­maries, according to earlier AP-NBC News voter polls. 
But Reagan added the votes of others to that core. 
In Illinois, he took 41 percent of the moderate votes, while Anderson got 45 percent. 
Only in Massachusetts, where Reagan was a close third to Anderson and Bush, did his support among this group dip below the Il1inois level. He got only 19 percent of the moderate vote in the Bay State. 
Reagan has also managed to blunt Anderson's drive for the votes of independent voters, out of ten Americans. In many cases, they can vote in partisan primaries. 

Anderson aimed to build large margins among independents to offset Reagan's edge among conser­vatives. 
But in Illinois, Reagan took 40 percent of the independent vote, while Anderson took 47 percent. Bush got only 9 percent. 
That's about as well as Reagan did among indepen­dents in New Hampshire and not quite as well as he did in three Southern primaries. Again, only in Massachusetts did Reagan do poorly among independents, gettin:8' only 19 percent of their vote to 46 percent for Anderson and 26 percent for Bush. 
Middle-income voters are critical to any general election campaign. And Reagan has been doing very well amon~ that group in the GOP pn­maries. ' 
Reagan got the support of 51 percent of those with incomes from $15,000 to $35,000 a year in Illinois, while Anderson got 36 percent of their votes. Bush got 10 percent.

'Disturbingpriceincreases' 
Carter requests price reports 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Carter administration'slanti-in-~ flation agency announced Tuesday1 it is asking special price reports from ,250 busi­nesses, mcluding oil compan­ies, "because of disturbing price increases" in recent months. 
The government announced separately that Americans' personal income increased in February by only $6.9 billion, or 0.3 percent, the smallest amount in more than four years. 
Consumer spending also slowed sharply during the month, an indication that con­sumers may be reaching the limit of their purchasin~ power in the face of high inflauon and a sluggish economic growth. 
In tts announcement, . the Council on Wage and Price Stability said it is seeking 
APPLICATIONS 
other businesses, including those in air transportation, paper, cement, hotels, food processing, retailing and mach­mery. 
A spokesman, Mike Gelb, said there have been "disturb­ing price increases" in these industries as reflected in the government's index of whole­sale prices. The special price reports will help the council determine whether the in­creases havebeenin violationof the administration's voluntary 
. price guideline. Inflation worsened sharply in recent months, with consumer prices rising an annual rate of 18 percent and wholesale prices up at a 20 percent rate. The administration's latest inflation forecast for 1980 is an overall increase in consumer ·

easing of inflation after mid­
year. 
The price information the council is requesting is for the' three-month period ending in January. It said the informa­tion is due in 10 days. 
While the council said it is requesting information from the 250 companies, which it did not name, it said it is ordering price reports from some petro­leum companies that failed to comply with previous requests. It dtd not name these com-, 
panies, either. 
The council has authority to require price information, by court subpoena if necessary, but lacks authority to order price changes even where it considers prices to be unjusti­fied. 
The council also announced that it is requiring all compan­ies with annual sales in excess of $100 million to file regular price reports by May 15, a total of 2,500 companies. 
President Carter announced on Friday that as part of the administration's stepped-up effort to control inflauon, the council will extend its price monitoring to companies with sales in excess of $100 million companies. 
Previously, only companies with sales of at least $250 million had been required to file regular price reports. 
Meanwhile, the effort by the government to slow the econ­omy through higher interest . rates was reflected in a slow­down in consumer spending activity in February, Commerce Department figures showed.

Hughes asked. She pointed out that iflack of love was the case, then the elderly may also be in danger. 
During the program, as pic­tures of babies in various stages ofdevel.opment were flashed on the screen, Hughes continually challenged the audience to ask themselves "Is this a human life?" 
Hughes called the question of protection of unborn children a civil rights issue. She described abortion as "the big killing the small," and "the strong killin2 the weak.'' As a result o1 abortion, according to Hughes, 
1.4 million babies died in 1978, more than the total U.S. casual­ties for the Civil War, the two World Wars, and the conflict in Korea and Vietnam combined. 
Hughes ended the presenta­tion by saying that more educa­tion is needed on the subject of abonion before people can make decisions concerning the issue. She also pointed out that a human life amend,...ent is possible, but she , .:d the road to such a law "a long, hard struggle."

The last date of deputized registration is Friday, after which students will have to go downtown to the city Icounty building. "If necessary, we wtll sponsor some sort of mass transporta­tion early next week," Lewis stated. 
In a related area, off-campus students are eligible to vote in city elections, unlike on-campus residents who ·may only vote in county and state contests. 
''With a population of over 2000 undergraduate and graduate students, the off-campus students could have a substantial impact in a city _el~ction," said Shannon Neville, outgoing off-campus commtsstoner. 
Mark Kelley, the new OC commisioner concurred with Neville. He said he believed a drive for voter registration off-campus would be successful. 
I ''Ifwe could get 2000 people to vote, we could raise the level of citizenry in student netghborhoods," Kelley commented. He said he hoped the students would be less apathetic about a city election than they are about student elections. "We wouldn't be just students, we would be city residents," he added. Kelley also said that tentative plans to go into the predominantly student apartment complexes, such as the Notre Dame and Campus Views Apartments to register voters were being discussed. Any student wishing to register may contact Paul Lewis, Sean Hefferman, or _!Jreg Anselmi, authorized deputies .

don't ask for flat committment 
from the president." 
Meanwhile, Senate Demo­cratic Leader Robert C. Byrd urged Carter to submit his proposed list of cuts without further delay. The Senate Budget Committee is expected to begin work on its spending plan before the end of the month. 
The process of arriving at a fmal budget has been compli­cated this year. After Janu­ary' s inflation rate was pegged at an 18 percent annual rate, Carter repudiated his original spending plan, which called for a $15.8 billion deficit, and said he would submit a balanced budget--the first for the federal government in 12 years. 
There were more signs of a worsening economic J;>icture yesterday. Despite soarmg oil mdustry profits, the overall performance ofU.S. businesses weakened in the last quarter of 1979 and analysts say the pattern will connnue. 
At a news conference yester­day, Giaimo said his budget plan, which includes $15.9 bil­lion in new spending cuts, represents "some painful choices (that) will require sacri­fice from millions ofAmericans. But there is no painless way to balance the budget."

Mad love 
linda Ronstadt 
(Asylum) 
Don't expect any more soft country­rock albums from the alluring chan­
! tress, Linda Ronstadt. Ater riding upon a crest of success for so long, she has moved her slick Los Angeles/ Eagles sound towards different stomping grounds: New Wave. On Mad Love, Ronstadt makes some bold explorations of the rougher rock sound, and the end result is some­times disastrous, and sometimes mar­velous. Ronstadt knows this could be a dangerous experiment, since it may alienate devoted fans more accus­tomed to her softer style. In a recent national interview, she said: 
"I don't know how this album wtl! sell. I'm sure I'll lJe atttacked: 'Linda's sold out, tryit.rg to be trendy, gotten away from her roots. ' Well, I can't wony about what the critics say''· 
but' you have to adm\n: her confidence and willingness to try new things. 
How does the new Linda sound? Surprisingly not much different. Peter Asher, slick producer par excel­lence, and most of the usual L.A. "Section" session musicians are back. Ronstadt hasn't abandoned the mellower style; she has tried to expand and build upon it. When she remembers where she came from, the harder Ronstadt is intriguing and enjoyable. When she crosses the threshold into punk, she is terrible. Period. 
The rockier sound is directly attri­butable to Mark Goldenbers and Ron Glaub, guitarist and bassist of the New Wave group, The Cretones. Goldenberg and Elvis Costello (who has just released another fine New Wave LP of his own, Get Happy!) wrote most of the songs. 
The successful songs are "How Do I Make You,""I Can't Let Go," and "Justine." On all, Linda keeps the harder guitar riffs perfectly in balance with her milder harmonious style. The end result is gutsy, snappy, catchy, and sexy, although she occa­sionally slips into a Deborah Harry (from Blondie) impersonation. Fortu­nately, Ronstadt has enough vocal power to avoid Harry's sweetly artifi­cial notes. 
The best runes, however, are the Elvis Costello creations, "Party Girl, "Girls Talk," and "Talking in the Dark.'' Costello has an affinity for inspiring lyrical entendres and hyp· nottc rhapsodic melodies of such range that only Ronstadt can rise to the challenge and fill the measures with any real depth. 
The bad songs are painful to hear, at best. One cannot help but wince when Ronstadt forgets her gift for healthy melody and speaks the lyrics in a pseudo-English punky accent on "Cost of Love." On "Hurt So Bad," Linda tries to blend country senti­mentality and New Wave anger in an emotive, pained vocal that pronounces each syl-la-ble with condescending grace--a pathetic experiment. The single Nell Young composition, ''Look Out for My Love," just doesn't fit on the album at all--Neil does his harder songs much better on Rust Never Sleeps, and Linda does him an injustice here. 
MadLove, in short, is an admirable 
experiment, though in many respects, 
a failure. If Linda can remember to 
keep her glorious gift for accurate 
tonality and t?e energy of New Wave in balance, then she provides hard rock with some much needed namral melody. Linda's strength is that s~e can sing. If she could do thts consistently in a New Wave format, she'd have a milestone.

Endofthe Century 
TheRamones 
(Sire) 
Gabba gabba hey! 

Gee whiz, what else can I say 
except that the best darn rock band 
in the world has just released a swell 
album destined to take its place 
alongside such rock classics as Cheap Trick's In Color and either volume of Abba's Greatest Hits. Yet 
unlike these albums, the Ramones' End ofthe Century surpassed them 
with a much more intense emotion and a greater social significance. 
Now, suppose that Jou were to approach me today an say, "Hey, Mtke! I've got a challenging philosophical problem from you. Describe the Ramones in just one word.'' Confident of my great knowledge, I cockily reply, "Fun!" Yes, fun. The Ramones embody the true spiri~ of rock 'n' roll. One can 
not help but be caught up in their 
infectious rhythms. Everyone wants 
to do the "Blitzkrieg Bop," don't 
they? There is no such thing as a 
depressing Ramones song. When 
they want to address topics of great 
social significance, they simply a­
dopt a light-hearted view of the 
subject. For example, take note of 
the treatment of child abuse in 
"Beat on the Brat." Yet, they don't 
laugh. They maintain a certain 
element of seriousness and this is 
part of their charm. I often wonder 
how these guys dressed in ~~a~k 
leather jackets, examples of vmhty 
adinfinitum, can be so serious about 
the nonsensical stuff they sing. But 
how can anyone keep a straight face 
listening to J oer. croon ''Baby, . I 
Love You,'' whde looking at hts 
cover picture at the same ttme. 
Phil Spector contributes his pro­
duction techniques on End of the 
Century and thts adds to the fun of 
this album. The bells in the back 
ground of "I Can't Make it on 
Time'' seem ludicrous when ·associ­
ated with Johnny's bludgeoning 
guitar. Once agam, the Ramones 
lighten their message and make us 
laugh. 
The significance of this album will 
probably never be measured. The 
Ramones tackl(t such pressing prob­
lems as mercenaries, insurance po­
licies, groupies, and what sights to 
see when touring a Communist 
country. And speaking of touri~g, 
there's even a song about roadtes 
called "Danny Says." It makes 
Jackson Browne look like a wimp. 
The Ramones' End ofthe Century is no disappointment to the millions of Ramones fans the world over who expect great rock 'n' roll from them. Ifyou let me down and don't run out and buy this album immediately I'11 probably lose my sanity (lose it?) and do something irrational rlike go 
headbanging with Suzy ,oi'self admi­nisteria lobotomy. I really like this album. It accurately captured the fun spirit ofrock 'n' roll. Just listening to this album makes me wish that I had a driver's license. 
Yabba dabba doo!

At Stepan 
Collegiate Jazz Festival Returns 
The Notre Dame Collegiate Jazz Festival has over the years blossom­ed into one of the premier jazz events in the nation, and this year's pro~ram promises to continue that tradiuon. The Festival, now in its twenty­second year, will open on Friday, March 21, at Stepan Center. 
Headlining this year's event will be such well-known and respected jazz personalities as Billy Taylor, Herb EUis, Tony Williams, Zoot Sims, Milt Hinton and Dan Morgentstern. These celebrities will serve as talent judges for the Festival. 
Joining these masters at the Festi­val, the oldest and largest event of its kind in the United States, will be a wide range and var.iety of highly talented colle~e performers. A total of 15 college Jazz groups, from eight states, are scheduled to perform at the Festival, playing every form of jazz from Dixieland to Swing, Be-bop to Fusion.

A master guitarist, Herb Ellis has played with many of· the greats mcluding Jimmy Dorsey, Ella Fitz­gerald, and Oscar Peterson. Joining Ellis and Taylor will be highly acclaimed drummer Tony Williams.

ting his sta.d' with Miles Davis at age 
18. Sought-after saxophone player 
Zoot Sims has also raniCed in Down­beat's poll and is a welcome addition 
to the 1980 Festival. Morgenstern needs little introduction to jazz lovers. Former editor of Downbeat Magazine, Morgenstern is a highly respected critic and author and is widely recognized as one of the top critical authorities in jazz today. 
Bassist Milt Hinton, nicknamed "Tne Jud~~", has played and re­corded with Cab Calloway, Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basey and Louis Armstrong. He also served as co-chairman of the jazz panel for the national Endowment for the Arts.

Kiel and Grooms head the list. Kiel led Columbus (Ind.) Easlt High to an unblemished season and the state's AAA title. An accomplished passer, he is also known for his strong foot. His longest punt was 70 yards, which is good news for a team whose punting game has been virtually non-existent smce the graduation ofJoe Resuc. 
Grooms is the most highly-touted of all bigh school quarterbacks !this year. He followed in the footste_ps of Ohio State's Art Schlichter at Miami (Ohto) Trace High, and piled up 2,993 total offensive yards. in two years. Interest· ingly, many so-called grid experts claim that Grooms has a better arm that his high school predecessor. 
Chris Brown, from Owensboro, Ky., is another quality quarterback recruit. Last vear he passed for 1,300 yards and 14 touchdowns, in addition to running for 600 yards and four TDs. 
j

His 4.3 speed in the 40-yard dash, coupled with the stiff competition at quarterback, mi~ht make Brown a prime candidate for a defenstve back position. 
Devme landed a blue-chipper when signing 
Chicago Weber's Tim Marshall (6-4, 240) to a letter-of-intent. Known best for his defensive tackle skills, he should challenge for a starting berth. And when defensive coordinator ] oe Y onto travelled to Connecticut to sign tackle Roosevelt Reede (6-4, 260), the defensiw outlook began to look all the more rosy. 
Also among the most promising of recruits is Cincinnati's Rick Naylor, another of the many stars at Moeller High to enroll at Notre Dame. Naylor (6-3, 210), a linebacker, might be able to· step right into the _picture, especially if the Irish use the 3-4 defenstve alignment that they have supposedly been talking about. 
AI the recruiting analysts and scouting services include Notre Dame in their lists of schools that had top recruiting years. It's just too bad that the freshmen-to-be won't have the good fortune of experiencing those exciting spring drills.

Over Pakistan border 
Soviets pursue Afgl.tan rebels 
BA]A WOOR, Pakistan (AP) ­Afghan rebels who brought their families across the high mountain border in the Hindu Kush range yesterday to shelter in Pakistan said they were pursued all the way by Soviet helicopter gunships. 
"More than half the people in my village were killed," said Shakir Brasul, a young, beard­ed Pathan warrior from Kota­pur village in Afghanistan's Konar province on the other side of the molllntain. 
He got across the border with a group of about 60 survivors, including women and children of all ages. ''It was so cold coming over the mountains that four children in our group died of exposure,'' Brasul said. 
As he spoke the sound of heavy guns and explosions rumbled through the mountains that divide Pakistan from Ko­nar, where Soviet and Afghan government troops launched a large-scale anti-rebel operation 20 days earlier. 
His group was the latest to reach the Khazana refugee 

Para(le selects Murphy 

A Notre Dame senior is one of a group of campus leaders across the nation selected to accompany out­standing newspaper carriers on a tour of Yugoslavia and Greece. Martin Murphy of Napervillw, Ill. was named by Parade Magazine as a chaperone for the April 15­28 triJ?. 
MaJoring in accounting and economics in the Col­lege ofBusiness Administra­tion Murphy has been a leader in the Neighborhood Study Help Program, a vo­lunteer program involving more than 300 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's smdents who tutor grade school stu­dents in 20 centers in the South Bend School Corpora­tion. Murphy ha.s served as a tutor, director ofa tutoring center and curre1t1tly is tran­sportation coordinator for the program. 
Murphy said he consi­dered volunteer work to be his most rewarding Notre Dame activity and hts parti­cipation in the annual Mardi Gras pro~ram was prompted by the distribution of pro­ceeds to several area chari­ties. 
Inau~ural ceremonies to­day wtll honor Fred R. Dallmayr, the ftrs.t holder of the Packey J. Dee Chair in Government and Interna­tional Studies. Events will include a public lecture by the new Dee Protessor, en­titled "Political Philosophy Today," to begin at 4 p.m. in the Center for Continuing Education auditorium. 
Although this is his first year in residence at Notre Dame, Dallmayr was named to the endowed professor­ship in September 1978. From July 1978 through June $979, he held a fellow­ship for independent study and reasearch from the Na­tional Endowment for the Humanities and was a re­search fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford University, during the fall term. 
 Dallmayr is a political theorist whose major inter­ests include contemporarv political theory, contemporary European polittca.l thought, theory of social science, and modern political thought. 
"Professor Dallmayr is both a fine scholar and a creative, subtle thinker," Dr. Peri Arnold, chairman of the Department of Govern­ment and International Studies, said. ''His work in 20th century European poli­tical and social philosophy will greatly strengthen our already strong field of politi­cal theory. Furthermore, he reinvigorates the tradition of eminent European scholars in the department. He not only holds a Munich docto­rate as well as an American Ph.D., but he also maintains close ties with the European scholarly community." 
A native of Germany who received U.S. citizenship in 1962, Dallmayr received a Doctor of Law degree from the University of Munich in 1955, an M.A. from South­ern Illinois University in 1956.

camp, only 10 days old but already cramped because 5,000 refugees a day stream in from Konar.. 
Brasul said it was a four-day climb through the snow-cover­ed ridges to the safety of the border a couple of miles from the refugee camp. 
The rebels said the Soviet and Afghan troops used Mig fighter bombers, artillery and tanks against the mountain villa~es and later dropped parachuttsts to mop up resistance. 
The rebels were forced to abandon their villages and took to the mountains, where they continued fighting until their ammuntion ran out, Brasul said. "Russian helicopters flew overhead constantly trying to locate us and kill us, but most of the time we managed to hide amidst the boulders on the mountain slopes and a~oid de­tection.'' 
The Russian troops have been in Afghanistan since late De­cember, when they backed a government coup and remained to help the government pt-t down the rebellion by these devoutly Moslem, anti-commu­nist tribesmen. 
The camp of 5oo small green tents, allocated one per family, is pitched in neat rows in a field next to a small river. There are more than 600 families here but many more are ;scattered in nearby villages in the Bajawour Valley or live out in the open because there are not enough tents. 

Ne\V doubts arise in ho~tage situation 
(AP)-Iran's attempt to elect a new Parliament bogged down yesterday in slow vote-counting ~d complaints of improprie­ties, castmg new doubt on just when the revolutionary govern­ment will be ready to make a decision on freeing the U.S. Embassy hostages. 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in a Persian new year broadcas~ to the nation, chided those who have accused some groups of fraud in last Friday's voting. Such loud complaining before the rest of the world is anti­Islamic, he said. 
In Washington, U.N. Secre­tary-General Kurt Waldheim, apparently concerned over in­creasing public anger among 
U.S. polittcians, told reporters that any American attempt to end the crisis by military force would ''create an explosion'' in the entire Middle East. 
Republican Sen. Richard Lu­gar of Indiana, in a statement Wednesday endorsed by Senate Republican Leader Howard Ba­ker, called on the Carter admi­nistration to prepare for a naval blockade of Iran and for mining of its ports. 
Revolutionary leader Khomei­ni has said the new 270-seat Parliament, or Majlis, must decide whether and whell to 
release the hostages, who spent their 138th day in captivity yesterday. Iranian officials have predicted this decision could not be made before mid-May. But by yesterday it was dear that Lht vote counting from last Friday's first round of parlia­mentary elections was going more slowly than anticipated. Final results mar not be known u.ntil eru:ly A~ri , election offi­cials satd, virtually ensuring that the second round of voting will be delayed a week or more beyond the planned date of April 4. This in turn would probably mean a further post­ponement of a deci~.ion on the hostages. 
The second round of voting will consist of runoffs in dis­tricts where no candidate won a majority last Friday. 
Allegations of fraud are fur­ther complicating the electoral process. Most of the complaints are aimed at the clergy-domi­nated Islamic Republican Party, which leads in the early el~ction results. 
The . ruling Revolutionary Council has named a commis­sion to inv~stigate the allega­tions, and President Abolhas­s~n Bani-S~d~ met yesterday with Khomeim to discuss them.

Haight-Ashbury 
15 years can make a difference 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -Fif­teen years ago, a street sign marked the crossroads of young America. 
Orphaned by the death of a beloved president, cast into the army by what they felt was an unjust war, given material wealth without moral guide­lines for using it, a new generation fell apart and came together at the corner at Haight and Ash bury. 
Fifteen years ago. It was a time of flower children, the Jefferson Airplane and the Greatful Dead. Of marijuana and LSD. Of communalltving, long hair and outrageous cloth­ing that once and for all divorced the young from the old. 
It was, Paul Kantner recalls, a time of innocence -''a never­never land.'' 
"It was an experimental time," says Kantner, who helped found the Jefferson Airplane back then and is the only original member of the band, now called the Jefferson Starship. 
"We trusted the drugs we took, almost offered ourselves as guinea pigs for a whole new way of dealing with each other." 
Joan Didion was less kind. In 
''Slouching Towards Bethle­
hem," she called what was 
goin~ on here in the mid '60s 
''soc1al hemorrhaging.'' 
''San Francisco was where the 
missing children were gather­
ing and calling themselves 
'h1ppies,"' she wrote, and she 
meant the Haight-Ashbury. 
But now the magic is gone, along with the posters that once converted the walls of Haight Street into a minarure Pekmg, announcing free con­certs in nearby Golden Gate Park and promoting the slo-

gans of the left calling for one 
world, one people. 
Today, Ha1ght-Ashbury is like 
many neighborhoods in the 
city, sporting a variety of shops 
and restaurants, noble Victo­
rians being renovated, and a 
sizable gay community bring­
ing in new business. 
Few signs remain of the time 
when the anti-war movement 
flourished and Greatful Dead 
leader Jerry Garcia poured 
forth the first psychedelic 
chords from his black and gold 
Gibson. 

"In the beginning, it was a 
very pleasant thmg," says 
Alex Holcombe, whose jewelry 
store has operated on the 
corner of Haight and Ashbury 
since 1932. 

''But it degenerated into a 
very heavy drug culture. I 
never went out of business, but 
we did lose 19 stores on this 
street. 

Dr. David Smith, founder and medical director of the Haight­Ashbury Free Clinic, has seen it all. 
"You saw the beginnings of the counterculture and psyche­delic scene as early as 1964," he says. ''In '65 and '66 it accelerated, and in '67 it peaked, the primary things being the rock groups and the expanded use of LSD.'' 
The clinic opened in 1967, operating 24 hours a day, says Smith, and treating as many as 200 patients a day, mostly for bad LSD trips and short term outpatient care. 
Today, .the clinic has evolved and expanded to include five sections, including detoxifica­tion for heroin addicts and a women's center, as well as a volunteer training branch and a research department. 
By 1970, the Haight-Ashbury was in the throes of a major heroin epidemic. The inno­cence that had heralded the new age had given way to crime and violence. The rock stars had long since packed up and moved to more pleasant surroundings in the suburbs. 
"It turned into a jungle," remembers Kantner, who blames that on the police. ''They allowed it to happen almost gleefully. Sort of to let the flower children face the tough world.'' 
The Haight looked, according to Smith, "like a bombed out ghetto." 
''There was so much crime and violence that only the most hardy of businessmen could hang in there. " 
But hang in there they did, and the neighborhoc d made a comeback. 
"I would say that 1971 and 
1972 was when there were 
some major community organi­
zation successes and the neigh­
borhood started getting to­
gether," says Smith. "The 
community started taking con­
trol and believing that they 
could handle it through rehabi..­
litation rather then the urban 
redevopment plans that were 
advocated by city hall. 
''As soon as things started improving, there was a big influx of different populations, includin~ the gay community," says SmJth. ''They came in and bought a lot of the houses and renovated them, and they 'O­pened a lot of shops and worked to improve the area.'' 
Renovation brought new pro­blems, however. Real estate prices skyrocketed, with some s rents jumping as much as 300 percent when apartment hou­
:I 

ses were sold. Neighborhood organizations fear that rede­velopment will result in a street decorated with tourist shops, driving land prices up further. 
There still are people on the street who look like character actors out of the original play, although Kantner says he doesn't feel a lot of life in the Haight. But Smith and others who work and live there are happy with the way things are turning out. 
''The old idealism still sur­vives, but it's tempered with reality," said Smith, adding that as far as he is concerned, the nei~hborhood has gone from be10g one of the most dangerous in the city to one of the safest. 0 Perhaps the most clear-cut proof of change in the Haight, 
however, is supplied by Kant­ner. He stills goes back every so often, but when he does it's not to play free concerts or take drugs. He goes to the Mac­Donald's on the end of Haight Street and buys his daughter a cheeseburger. 
Gas prices soar overseas 
(AP) -The next time you pump $1.201-a-gallon gasoline 10to your car -and think longingly back to last year when 1t was half as much ­consider the !?ocr motorists in other countnes. You could have it worse. 
You could be drivin~ in Bul­garia, where the pnce of a gallon of regular gasoline dou­bled to $4.32 last year, or in Italy, where a gallon of high­test would set you back $3.02, up 71 cents in a year. 
An Associated Press world­wide survey, condutted in late Ja~uary, found that. ga~oline pnces m most countnes JUmp­ed as the world price of crude oil doubled to nearly $30 a barrel over the past year. 
In Hong Kong, gasoline climbed to $1.72 from $1.12 , prompting one wealthy tactory owner to forsake his luxury Mercedes-Benz and Continen­tal cars for a compact Honda. 

Israeli schoolteacher Shlomo 
Eidaw said a 53 percent in­
crease in gasoline prices over 
the past year has meant 
"there's no way I can afford to 
drive my car to work instead of

"We take the car only if we 
have a lot of shopping of for

Notre Dame n1arried couples encounter many difficulties 
Editor's Note: This is the secondpart ofa two-part arllde about married students at Notre Dame. The topic is the pres,<Jnt social and living conditions t.bat exist for this silent minority. 
Liz and Jim Niehaus are married undergraduates at No­tre Dame. They account for two of the 39 wedded undergradu­·ates. Two-hundred twenty-f:tve graduate students combine with that number to equal the total population of married students at Notre Dame. Looking for ~heap h~usinB m:ar to campus, Ltz andJtm Ntehaus studied the options available to married students. 
The Niehauses discovered that Notre Dame offers 117 units in a housing complex called University Village, one­naif mile from campus. One criterion at the Village is that the residents have children. For those who do not have children, there are 24 apa.rt­ments provided on Cripe Street. 
The University Village apart­ments have two bedrooms, a living room, bath, and a kit­chen. The Cripe Street apart­ments only have one bedroom, but otherwise their layout is the same. 
Fr. Michael Heppen, directm of housing, explained in a recent interview that his office is not directly responsible f,::>r providing married students with housing arrangements. According to Heppen, the stu­dent managers of the Villa~:e and Cripe Street apartments arrange the leases. 
"I don't know if there are 
married students who are not 
able to get married student 
housing or not,'' Heppen said. 
He added, "I haven't had any 
complaints so I assume we're 
doing well in that area. There 
are no changes to be made in 
the foreseeable future." A 
random sampling of 27 married 
students at Notre Dame were 
surveyed as to whether or not 
they had difficulties finding 
housing arrangements! Nine 
said "yes" and 18 answered 
'~no.''  
As the Niehauses have a young daughter, Stephanie:, chose to live in Umversity . The youn~ family tried non-umverstty S,(>onsored apartments, butJtm noted "at University Village you 't beat the rent and the kids lot ,?f playmates and

She added that the::

marriages, particularly in 
fai~ly conservative Catholic 
to Frank Carrico, retired · of Mainte­for the Village who 
a~nrlr~·t1 there for 18 years, all 100 units there are usually filled. "If there aren't people in 'em, they are paying the rent just to hold 'em," he said. Overcrowding at University Vil­lage is a big problem for many on the waiting lists. Enwere Dirke commented: "I applied for housing accomodations at University Village in the sum­mer semester. The; manager tells me the list of waiung students is so long I do not have a chance. Now I live in South Bend where my stipend isn't even enough to pay my rent, not to talk of other expenses." 
SO(:iology graduate, Pat Her­rimann has found the Cripe Street apartments very agree­able: "The rent is reasonable, the apartments are clean and the carpentry is nic. They are small but' there is just enough room.'' Notre Dame bought the Cripe Street apartments, built in 1970, from Portage Realty approximately five years ago. 
''They were kind of bad when we got them; they had bad plumbing and bad closets," says Frank Carrico. He re­placed all of the bathroom fixtures in the apartments, and he checked three times a day to make sure everything was run­ning smoothly. 
Located between the Village apartments and those on Cripe Street is the University Village Center, a house owned by Notre Dame which has been turned in to an all-purpose center by tearing down a wall between the living room and the dining room. Fr. Kevin McGrath, OSB, a Benedictine from Ala­bama working on his doctorate in Theology at Notre Dame, resides there as the married students' chaplain. The center is open to all couples to use and vanous activities including La­vage Childbirth Sesswns, Brownie Scouts meetings, and men's Sunday chess clubs have gone on there. 
''Being a student myself, I know . what it entails, and working with the married stu­dents at University villas.e, I know what family life entails. I find that it's a challenging combination and realize that I'd like to be of whatever help I can to them,'' reflects Father Mc­Grath. 
He does not understand his job to be the same as those who work for Campus Ministry with unmarried students. He deli­berately stays in the back­ground. 
"In a way I've felt that they have been the step-children of the J]niversity --left on their own, yet, they like not being in the middle of things,'' McGrath said. 
He stressed that the families value their independence and that he must, therefore, take a differeint approach with them than if they were on campus. He said that he likes to remind them that he is there to help them by casual encounters. He added, however, that he knew that the villagers would be 
upset if they  did  not  have  a  
chaplain.  
The  Financial  Aid  Office  

deals with a number of Notre Dame's 254 married students. Two-hundred and two are re­ceiving financial aid this semes­ter. Mr. Joseph Russo, Direc­tor of Financial Aid, said in a recent interview: ''I would not reward a married student with a scholarship because he is mar­mied, nor would I take it away." 
Russo stresses that many married students come to the Financial Aid Office solely for advice. He told that he often sits with students just married, and works a budget out for them. 

Married students have dif­ferent tastes in recreation from­those of single students. The Niehauses say that there are few social events set up special­ly for married students. They find they do not fit into the on-campus social atmosphere that involves going to the bars and drinking, or going to par­ties in dormitories in order to meet other singles. 
Another married students a~­reed saying: "Socially, thts University seems to me to be one large keg." 
The managers of the married student apartments will some­times arrange large-scale com­munity activities, but generally the students have small get­togethers among themselves, continued Jim Niehaus. His wife, Liz, remembers only three large social events for married students in their three years as a married couple at Notre Dame: a Summer of '77 village-wide picnic, and the annual Knights of Columbus Easter Egg Hunt and Christmas Tree Lighting. 
Instead of meeting other couples at the bars, many Umversity Villa~e residents meet each other vta their child­ren on the playground behind the apartments. Men and women both make this trip "out back.'' If both spouses are students, they arrange to es­cape having classes at the same time so that one parent can babysit. Yet, if both parents do have classes at the same time, or if one parent works, they are on their own to find baibysitters. 
Nothing has been arranged by the University or by the apart­ment managers. Findiing baby­sitters, perhaps, is one of the married students' biggest prob­lems. 
Like most sirigle undergradu­ates, many married couples enjoy Notre Dame sports. However, some quarrel with administration policy for spouses' football tickets. They hold that since there are so few married undergraduates, the spouses should be able to sit with their partners in the student section. Instead they are given tickets in the end zone with the graduate students. 
Still, the married students 
are not asking to tumble Notre 
Dame's single-oriented social 
atmosphere. Out of 27 inter­
viewed, 20 responded that the 
atmosphere was generally 
agreeable, six responded nega­
tively, and one did not com­
ment. 

They seem to agree 
with the student that: said: 
"Married students have diffi­
culties peculiar to their state, 
but because of his responsibili­
ty to his family, he must make 
certain adjustments io his 
schedule, and omit some of the 
usual campus activities... It 
comes with the territory·.''

A.C.S. revises reconunendations for routine tnedical tests 

NEW YORK (AP) -With evidence mounting that early detection does no ~ood in lung cancer, the Amencan Cancer Society said yesterday it no longer recommends routine an­nual chest x-rays for heavy smokers. 
The society also revised re­commendations for tests for cancer of the cervix, colon, rectum and breast after a study by Dr. David Eddy of Stanford University of the cost versus effectiveness of such tests. 
A statement from Dr. Saul Gusberg, the society's national president, said the revisions ''deliver essentially the same health benefit as the previous recommendations at a greatly n;duce~.cost, risk and inconve­nience.

But Gusberg cautioned that they apply only to people who don't have any symptoms of cancer. People with symptoms should see a doctor immediate­ly, he said. 
For lung cancer, the society dropped a recommendation that peoJ?Ie with a higher-than­normal nsk get an annual chest x-ray. "High-risk" persons were those over age 40 who are heavy smokers or work with known carcinogens like asbes­tos. 
Eddy's study concluded that tests for lung cancer, which include chest x-rays and spu­tum cytology, a test based on mucus from the lungs, do indeed detect the disease· at an early stage. But he said lung cancer is so hard to cure that "there actually is evidence from a half-dozen studies that such early detection does not reduce mortality.'' 
Besides, Eddy said, x-rays themselves carry a smaJJ health risk, and there is "serious risk'' of wasted time and money when tests are ''false­positive," that is, they indicate a cancer where none exists. 
In other revisions, the society: 
Dropped a recommendation for an annual Pap smear to detect cervical cancer, recom­mending instead a Pap smear every three years for women aged 20 to 65 and those under 20 who are sexually active. 
Dropped a recommendation that men and women over 40 get annual tests for blood in the stool and an annual exam with a proctosigmoidoscope, an instrument that looks for can­cer of the colon and rectum. 
Strengthened its recommen­dations for the use of x-rays to detect breast cancer. The soci­ety previou-1y urged routine annual mammograms for wo­men over 50, those over 40 wi:h a family history of breast cancer, and those over 3 5 with a personal history of breast cancer. 


Helection were held today, Harris poll predicts Fordthe winner 
NEW YORK (AP) -A new ABC News -Lou Harris poJJ: says former President Gerald Ford would defeat President Carter if the 1980 presidential election were held today. 
In addition, the poll said Ford may now be a slight favorite over Ronald ReaBan among Republicans and mdependent vote~s f~r the GOP presidential nommanon. 
The poJJ was taken last week and completed before the final results of Saturday's South Carolina primary were known. Reagan won that GOP primary so decisively that the second­place finisher ] ohn ConnaJJy dropped out of the race yester­day. 
The poJJ said Ford would get 54 percent of the vote to Carter's 44 percent if the November general election were held now. Two percent of the registered voters inter­viewed were not sure. 
But Carter would defeat Rea­gan by a 58-40 margin, the same poJJ showed. Two percent were not sure. 

Republican and independent voters in the poll were asked for their choice for the GOP presi­dential nominee. 
Ford was named by 33 per­cent and Reagan by 27 percent. 
Because of the sampling error margin involved in these figures -ABC -Harris polls generally have error margins of about 6 percentage points ei-­ther way -one can only say that Ford and Reagan split the vote, with Ford perhaps slightly a­head. 
A surprising finding of the poll was that Rep. John Ander­son, R-Ill. was the choice of 15 percent of the GOP-independ­ent group. That put him in a virtual tie with Georse Bush, who received the backmg of 14 percent. 
Others received 7 percent. Four percent of the voters polled were not sure. 
Those results compare to a ABC-Harris poll taken in No­vember 1979 which showed Ford with 25 percent, Reagan
 
30 percent, Bush 6 percent, Anderson 2 percent and other candidates 25Jercent. Twelve percent name no one or were not sure. 
The number of voters polled was not available from the pollster.

Economics sponsors lectures 
The Department of Econo­
mics is spo~soring a pair of 
lectures g1ven by Gar 
Alperovitz, co-director of the 
National Center for Economic 
Alternatives. 
The first lecture _entitled 
' 'Inflation, Basic Necessities & 
the Distribution of Economic 
Power" is scheduled for 4:15 
p.m. Monday in room 122 of Hayes-Healy. 
"Community as a Funda­mental Economic Strategy,'' the second talk, will be held at 8 p.m. Wednesday in the Galvin Life Science Audito-· rium. 
~lpero~itz enjoys a .distin­gmshed hst of academ1c ere­dentials. In addition, he has authored several a:rticles which have appeared in the New York Times and the Washington Star. He has also authored several books. 
Alperovitz has been quite active with labor groups. He has served as Legislative direc­tor in both the U:S. House of Representatives and the Sen­ate, and is also the former president of the Cambridge Institute. 
At present, from his Wash­ington based office, he analy­zes economic policies and offers proposals for restruc­turing the American economy. 
cooling system. 
The plant has been out of operation since it was damaged on March 28, 1979, when the rec. -.r lost cooling water and overhc...~ed in the worst acci­dnet in the history of U.S. commercial nuclear power plants. 
Monitors inside the building, which adjoins the giant reactor containment building, first de­tected the increase at 1 a.m. yesterday. 
Although plant operations theorized an extremely low amount of radioactivity escaped into the air, it could not be detected on sensitive monitors in the building's ventilation system. 
"The main thing is we're not seeing any changes on our outside monitors. We know something is going out, but we can't detect it," said plant spokesman Sandy Polon. 
"It's a very small leak. We've not seen any release that would exceed limits," said John Col­!ins, chief of operations at the site for the U.S. Nuclear Regu­latory Commission. 
Plant officials would not spe­culate on the type of radioactive material. However, Collins said it may have been particles of radioactive cesium released when the leaking water eva­porated. News of the leak came after 
~ hundreds .of a~gry residents, 
· som~ vvavmg stgns and a few weanng gas masks, vented their fears over a porposal to purge radioactive gases as a way to speed the cleanup of the badly contaminated plant. Thomas Geruskey, head of state Department. of Environ­tal Resources,_ satd the state favors t~e ven~10g plan because leaks wtll conunue at the plant until it is cleaned up. "Even though they may be small, . there may be _greater ones 10 the future 10 bad w_eather conditions, giyins . htgher exl?osures to the 10d1v1­duals offstte than a controlled venting situation would,'' he said. 

The drug companies argued there was no basis for legal action because the women could not identify the manufac­turers of the drug their mo­thers took. 
The decision, joined in by Chief Justice Rose Bird, Jus­ticeFrankNewmanandJustice Pro Tern Clinton White, agreed liability generally depended on proving injuries were caused by the defendant. 
But it said there were excep­tions, adding ''berween an innocent pllaintiff and negligent defendants the latter should bear the cost of the injury." 
The decision said that ad­vances in science and techno­logy create goods which may harm consuHJers and cannot be traced to any producer. 
''The response of the courts can be either to adhere rigidly to prior doctrine, denying reco­very to those injured by such products, or to fashion rem~­dies to meet these changing needs," the court added. 
The dissent by Justice Frank Richardson, joined by Justices William Clark and Wiley Man­uel, said the decision was unwise because the "ramifica­tions seem almost limitless." 
The majo:rity, the dissent ad­ded, "effectively makes the entire drug industry, or at least its California members, an insurer of all injuries attributa­ble to defective drugs of uncer­tain or unprovable origin, in­cluding those injuries manifest­ing themselves a generation later...''

By voice vote yesterday, the House Budget Committee ap­proved the recommendation to cut $836 million by ending Saturday mail deliveries and reducing subsidies for bulk mail. 
The pand's vote does not mean Saturday mail deliveries will definitely end, however. Even if approved by the full 
Congress, the proposal could be 
averted if the U.S. Postal Service raised rates or made other cuts to achieve the sav­mgs. 
Rep. Jim Mattos, D-Texas, said the Saturday mail proposal might also be defeated when it reaches the House floor and suggested the committee sim­ply recommend an $836 million postal cut without mentioning Saturday deliveries. 
Meanwhile, Rep. James M. Hanley, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Post Office Commit­tee, attacked the proposal to end Saturday deliveries, saying such a move "would not serve the America~ people well." 
The budfret committee also recommen<led saving $100 mil­lion through elimination of the 
Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, which has pro­vided grants to local police departments for research and equipment since 1968. The LEA.A proposal brought the first sharp clash berween Giaimo and committee liberals as Rep. Elilzabeth Holtzman, D­N.Y., denounced the cut as "gratuitous." Democratic liberals openly threatened to break with Giai­mo in a dispute over a proposed $50 million cut in the $321 million legal aid .... program.

P. 0. Box Q 

The Truth in the scriptures Dear Editor: From his comments in the March 10 issue of The Obser­ver, it seems that Bill Toohey is absolutely certain that Jesus was a pacifist and ''totally rejected violence,'' just as the Christian theologians alre also absolutely certain that the term "resurrection from the dead' is not a reference to a monotheis­tic doctrine of reincarnation. Approxiamtely two years ago a letter appeared in The Obser­ver in whtch I challenged the chairman of the department of theology and any other theolo­gian at Notre Dame to a public debate on the meaning of the · term "resurrection of the dead." I am now challenging Bill Toohey or any other theo­logian at Notre Dame to a public debate on whetherJesus ''totally rejected violence.'' Of course, I do not expect a reply to this challenge any more than I expected a reply to my first challenge. People who claim to understand th(: scrip­tures but who do not, in fact, understand the scriptures, tend to avoid those situations which either make their lack of under­standing more widely known or tend to mcrease, unnecessarily the risk of unemployment. An investigation of the Tmths in the scriptures is, after all, entertainment at its best, just so long as the individual makes certain thay any of those Truths do not interfere with how one makes a living. Michatl Cecil  3) One week before the election in Illinois, the Chicago Sun-Times poll showed Alder­son leadingReagan, 39-31. The Tn"bune had Anderson ahead by a 33-31 margin. Again, the results indicated otherwise, as Reagan carried Anderson's home state with a comfortable 48-37 percent victory. The much heralded crossover vote did vote 47 percent for Ander­son. ~hat has been ignored, however, is that Reagan won 40 percent of the Democrat and Independent voters, according to NBC News. The point of these examples is to illustrate that which should  now be obvious, i.e. that the polls mean nothing when it comes to the election. The polls always seem to show Reagan in bad shape until he begins his campai~n in each state, at which ttme his popularity soars. Those who claim that Reagan in unelectable ignore a number of significant facts. First, they ignore the fact that .Reagan is the best campaigner in politics today. They also fail to note that Reagan won the governor­ship twice by an average of 750,000 votes in California, where Democrats outnumbered Republicans 2-1. Finally, they ignore the fact that Reagan has a huge target to run against, James Earl Carter. Never in American history has the office of President been occupied by a man of such incompetence. The possibility of his reelection is truly frightful. So let's be realistic. If we are going to talk about electability, let's talk about ·the facts. Governor Reagan is electable. Reagan can, must, and will be elected our next President.  operation. The Observer infers that the student representatives are incompetent, calling for "a wider student representation" in order to get "more imagina­tive and meaningful student commentary on campus life.'' And, yet, the main source of information on campus issues, The Observer, does not even send a reporter to most of the meetings. I agree that there are some problems with the present com­position and lack of power of the CLC, but at this point there does not seem to be a. good alternative available. There has been discussion, in the CLC, about possible changes in its composition, but the consen­sus, thus far, is that the present structure is the most represen­tative. I disa,gree with The Observer's claim that the CLC "can no longer be taken seri­ously" and that it is "useless." I think most CLC members would agree that we have done some very positive things this year. Before it criticizes the CLC for being irresponsible, I think The Observer should assume a little responsibility itself. If they come to the CLC meetings and learn, firsthand, how it operates, then maybe they will be justified in their future opimons of it. Until then, I think it is unfair for The Observer to influence student opinion on a very important topic. Mi~hael P. Sexton Services thank NDcorrununity  Molinelli 'dead' toour community Dear Editor: I am writing in response to the letter by B. P. Goyer concerning Michael Molinelli, the author of "Molarity." First, I would like to express my conviction that the stnp is still 'being composed by Mr. Moli­nelli. I have examined the writing carefully and have dis­covered that it is indeed that of the cartoonist himself. To address the claims which Goyer appeals to in order to support the theory that Mr. Molinelli is deceased and there­fore could not be the author of the strip any longer, I wish to make public the fact that I have been tn con~act with the car­toonist and have in my posses­sion a postcard that was sent to me by the allegedly late Michael Molinelli himself. He is, as has been announced in The Observer several times, abroad this year with the Notre Dame Architect Rome Pro­gram. The postcard to which I refer has a ptcture of a statue of the Madonna di Monte Alfeo. Mr. Molinelli relates in his note on the back of the card that this statue sits on top of the mountain where his family comes from. Mr. Molinelli is far from being physically dead: he is in bell' Italia, searching for his roots. I do concede that there have been some very cryptic symbols in "Molarity" lately. Indeed, upon examtning more closely the strip referred to in Goyer's  mentioned. In the last panel, just above the author's signa­ture appears on a sweatshirt the message "Bye Notre Dame." In today's cartoon, there are a couple of other clues which seem to indicate that Mr. Molinelli has met with some cruel fate. In tne first panel, Jim Mole appears to be holding a skull; in the last panel, on the desk are the words, "I was. " To most people this would seem to be a clear indication that Mike is no longer among the living. However, it is my belief that these clues are not to be taken in their literal sense. As one who has spent a year abroad, I know that among students who spend time away from their horne campus there is often the feeling of being ''dead'' to friends on the home campus. Very few friends find the time to keep their promise to write to those abroad. It is my contention that Mr. Moli­nelli feels dead in this very way. He must be employing his comic strip to lament the fact that he hears nothing from the people for whom he writes "Molarity." I propose therefore that we, the students ofNotre Dame and Saint Mary's, do everything in our power to resurrect Michael Mollinelli from his "death" to our community. Let us deluge him with letters. In fact, why don't we attempt to make this a universal resurrection and write to all those friends abroad to whom we made promises to write?

Perhaps the most frequently cited poll of the past few weeks has been one pittin~; Gov. Ronald Reagan vs. President Carter in a general ekction. Carter leads Reagan in this poll, 58-40. This survey has Incessantly been cited as gospel proof that Reagan canno1: win in November against Carter by such people as John Anderson, NBC, CB.S, and ABC. I think it is very important that we keep our perspective on this poll, con­cermng which, a few oibserva­tions should be made. 1) In New Hampshire, the Boston Globe Joll of voters indicated a dea heat betWeen Ronald Reagan and Geor~e Bush. The results wen~ qutte different: Reagan 50 percent, Bush 23 percent.  Dear Editor: As a member of the Campus Life Council, a ~roup under considerable critictsm of late, I read with interest the recent articles in The Obsen;er abouc it. I think that Fr. Richard Conyers and Paul Riehle have brought out some of the impor­tant problems concerning the keg proposal, and the CLC in general. They have raised some of the weaknesses in­herent in the CLC which, of late, have led to some disap­pointing results for myself and others. ~ith one of the articles, however, I have some personal objections. That article is an editorial written by The Obser­ver (March 14). In the editorial, The Observer claims that "the  Hardly a month goes by that we are acknowledging a gift from the Notre Dame Commu­nity. Donations come to us from students, faculty and alumni. Letters telling us of their efforts on our behalf have been received from the Campus Ministry, Third ~orld Relief Fund, Cambodia response, Holy Cross Fathers and Bro­thers and the 'World Hunger Coalition. (I just hope I have not left out anyone.) In every case, their efforts were to both raise funds and, more impor­tant, to raise the conscious level of awareness. Needless to say, this over­whelming response of your good people has certainly been an inspiration to all ofus here at CRS.

I wonder where The Observer gets its justification for ma~ing these requests. It seems trre­sponsible to me that The Observer would have such  passton.

their dream became a reality. Now, the squad, m first place 
As one examines the team roster, there is one name that catches the eye right away. That name is Kevin Hawkins, whom we all know and love as one of the "walk-ons" on Digger Phelps' basketball team. Hawkins, a junior from Los Angeles, also just happens to be the tallest member of the volleyball team at 6-5. He uses that superior height and his incredible leaping ability to his advantage on the volleyball court, and is a valuable asset to the squad. 
But, of course, he cannot do it alone. Although the members of the rest of the squad do not enjoy the notoriety that Hawkins possesses, they are just as valuable to the squad. There is that often-heard-of blend of youth and experience present, with one law student, two seniors, five juniors, one sophomore, and two newly-recruited freshmen comprising the eleven member team. 
O'Harlon's team is predominantly a tall squad, with six of its players standing at least 6-2. Freshman Barry Smith, who hails from Lancaster, NY, stands at 6-4. Team captain 
1 Dennis Regan (a junior from Newport Beach, Calif.), 
· ~rs~-year law student John Klebba (Des Moines, Iowa), JUmor AI Schumacher (South Holland, Ill.), and senior Gary Metzler (Grand Rapids, Mich.) all stand at 6-2, providing a formidable sight for the oppostiton. Senior Tom Meaney (6-1) and sophomoreJohn P1erce (6-0), though they lack the size of the others, are very adequate performers nonetheless. 
But volleyball is not just a game for the skyscrapers to show off their spiking skills. There is a place in the game of yoll_eyball for the "littlt: man", and 5-9 Brent Beutter (a 
JUmor from nearby Mtshawaka), 5-10 Clark Gibson (a freshman from Torrance, Calif.), and 5-11 Bill Strotman (a

Without the harping over who gets top bi:Iing the two campus volleyball groups join a l6-team field in Saturday's competi­tion of power play. 
"Power denotes a higher level of plar. It means not recreational volley­hal . " says Erin Murphy, head coach of the Blue Wave. "Volleyball has progressed so much that there is a need for distinction, we don't pat the: ball around like someone in a back­yard.'' 
The Division A tournament, Division A being the second highest level of play sanctioned by the USVBA, is a collection of 26 teams-16 women's and 10 men's-with members repres­enting a broad level of ages, experi­ence and motives. 
' 1There'll be people from all age groups," offers Murphy, a graduate of Lewis Collese. "A couple of clubs will be all-star high school teams like South Bend Turner's, which has girls from Adams, St. Joe's and other area schools. They could beat a college ~aJD. It's interesting that they play at boasting an winning basketball team in the Saint Mary's intramural tournament. 
''Our season is so short, from September to November, that they have to_ play more," says Murphy of her charges. "Next year they would have forgotten everything without playing. It would take a month to get them back to where they had been the previous year." T earns will travel to the competition 
from such sites as St. Charles, Missouri, and Columbus, Ohio. The host teams can thank the USVBA for the tournament's publicity. 
''The tournament is approved by our organization. The USVBA publishes a newsletter with tournaments listed," explains -Murphy, also the assistant athletic director at Saint Mary's. "All 
the  clubs  have  to  do  is  call  fo.r  
information.''  
Murphy  expects  the  host  Blue  

Wave, which placed second at the Kellogg Invitational in January, to be one of the better teams along with a few other talented dubs in the women's division. 
"Valparaiso ought to be good, they are Division II in college and the coach plays on the team," says Murphy. ''Kellogg Community College also has Western Michigan, Indianapolis, Val­paraiso and Notre Dame to be the front runners. 
"You can't rule out Notre Dame as one of the favored," states Murphy. ''They have been winning at a lot of big tournaments lately. ' 
Sarurday' s invitational will begin at 9 a.m. with five pools-three women'£ and two men's-in round robin play. Each club will play all the other teams in its pool two games ending at 11. The record of games won in pool play will boost teams to the semi-finals which begin at 6 p.m. in the AAF. _The semis will be based on the best of three games to 11 points. The championship matches for both men and women will follow the semi-finals as the top two teams clash in the best of three games to 15. 
Individual trophies will be awarded to the members of the winning teams in both the men and women's divisions whil~ the second p~ace clubs will each receive team trophies. 
The tournament means much more to the Blue Wave and O'Hanlon's than another trophy on the wall, according to Murphy. 
"Besides volleyball we have gained valuable experience through traveling and meeting others. We all pi1;ch in and have fun, too."

keep up, but if the reader fits that 
bill, this book can control your eyes, 
and not let go until the last bullet, the 
last laser, the last intercontinental 
ballistic missile, is fired. 
The book is not some lunatic 
writers sadistic fantasy. It's a 
responsible, well-researched, and 
perhaps prophetic warning to the 
world of what could very well be 
staring us in the face. 
There are some surprises in this war. If it means anything to you, I think it is comforting to read that any future war doesn't necessarily have to end up in a total nuclear holocaust. 
but that doesn't mean nuclear wea­
pons aren't used. Or chemical weapons. Or space weapons. If you're more confused now than ever, good. That's a great indication you 
might want to read about the Third 
World War before it happens.

LETTERSTOil LONELYGOD 
1"'he Devil You Know 
Late Sunday evening, after the last Mass was said, and the cheer­leading for J ahweh had ended fvr another week, I admitted the Devil to my room, and we played the n'ame of being agnostic. The: Devil, reeking of perfume from Pucci, wore a Pierre Cardin shirt and a Princess Mara necktie, like the ones Jeannie gave me for Christmas. He sported a new moustache that's the spitting image of my moustache; and he had the air of a gentleman who has recently lost a great deal of weight. The advantages, to the Devil, of looking like me, is that I don''t waste time doubting whether he really exists. As long as I can admit my own existence, I don't have prob­lems establishing the identity of the evil one. 
"As usual," he said, taking my Pall Mall away from me as soon as I had lighted it, "You're working too hard, setting up land deals in Disneyland." In separating me from my cigarettes, he makes one of his cleverest appearances as an a.ngel of light. 
"I feel fine," I said, "but who invited you? If you don't mind, I'd rather be alone.'' 
"You are alone," he said. "Except for you, this room is as empty as an atheist's heaven. I'm just the night shadow of the doubt you're afraid of, the darkness hug­ging the corners of your mind. If you pray, a flight of angels will be sent to keep you safe. Isn't that what the Divine Ineptitude has promised?'' 
"It's like a game of politics between you and Him," I said, ''where neither candidate speaks well of the other.'' 
''Except,'' he said, ''that Old Tinhorn keeps insisting that the meek shall inherit the earth. They could hardly complain if He even­tually cheats them; otherwise, ifthey complain, they wouldn't really be the meek, and shouldn't be inher­iting anything.'' 
You can't argue with the Devil; to tell the truth, I don't even try. On Sunday evenings, after the cheer­leading of worship, I'm a little diswuraged with God. The Devil, sensing the weariness, cheered me up "'ith the vffer of an unruly passion. Out of habit, I rejected it, but I'm unredeemed enough to be grateful. 
"He n1ins Himself," I com­plained. 'He seems to like to be defeated. I like Him so much, but He loesn't deserve to be a winner." 
"I could have made it easy for Him," the Devil said modestly. "I could have given Him the whole world to bootlick the legs of His throne; but He wouldn't share. He didn't want to be partners; He insisted on doing it His way.'' His wa;Y, for Frank Sinatra, was the height of macho. His Way, for God, was merely self-destructive. 
"Blessed are they that mourn," I tell them, ''for they shall be comfor­ted. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the/eacemakers, for they shall be calle the children of God." 
"Honeyed words, like opium," the Devil sneered. "And He calls me the Father of lies." 
''Experience alw~ys ends with death," I said. "In the green leaf of nature, life keeps re-appearing, until winter overwhelms it. But when the great globe of earth itself is cracked, and the earth and seed are consu­med in fire, what will become of existence? Will God give back life then that He wouldn't lift His hand to save now?" 
"I watched Him die," the Devil said. "Proud, mean, spiteful, He preferred to suffer. When He finally died, I covered Him with darkness. He couldn't prevent me from helping Him when He was dead, and I covered Him with darkness, because I didn't like to look at Him." 
"I guess," I said, "that when you finished with Him, He didn't look very much like God any more?" 

"What," he said, "is He suppo­sed to look like except a skinny kid who is going hungry, or a sick woman whose friends have left her, or a poor man who needs clothes to keep him from freezing. He looked like all of them. I could never respect a superior whom I had to pity.' ' 
"He ruins Himself," I said, "and I'm worn out from trying to get people to take Him seriously. It's very tirin~, teaching them lessons about grams of wheat, falling into the earth and dying, so that they might bring forth new life." 
"He couldn't forgive me," the Devil said. ''I offered Him the· kingdoms of the world and the glory thereof that He could have shared with His beggars, and He couldn't forgive me. With His dying breath, He forgave everyone who hurt Him, but He couldn't forgive me, and it hurt me for quite a long time." 
He didn't seem like a bad devil, as 
he sat there, looking like me, 
grieving for himself, loving God and 
hating Him in the same emotion. 

"Why do you suppose He wouldn't 
forgive you?" I said. 

"Our argument began a long time 
ago," he said, "when I said to His 
creatures: 'Would you like to be like' 
-he hesitated, refusing to say the 
name -'like His Nibs?' His Nibs, 
when He found out, got very angry. 
He said it wasn't supposed to be that 
way at all; that He wanted to become 
like those low, vile creatures Him­
self; that was the way He had 
planned creation. I said it was 
ridiculous ; He should raise crea­
tures to His level, nqt descend to 
theirs. Did He expect outstanding 
angels like myself to look like vile 
vermin? He said that He didn't 
expect anything from His angels 
except that they should await their 
marching orders. I said that if 
marching orders meant Ikowtowing. 
to silly creatures, He could shove 
them up St. Gabriel's horn, because 
I marched to the beat of a different 
Rev. Robert Griffin 
drummer. The He told me to get out, and I told Him I was getting out, but He could send for me when he had come to his senses. He hasn't sent for me yet, so I keep taking His creatures away from Him, tempting them with offers of the kingdoms and glory ofthe world that His Nibs, with His slumming, had no use for.'' 
By now, the Devil had begun 
weeping, as though he regretted 
taking creatures away from their 
Maker, but taking creatures away, 
was what a Creator, who wouldn't 
compromise, made a poor devil do. 
Sweat was beading brow, and he had 
begun reeking rather vulgarly with 
the smell of burning sulphur. Mraid 
that he might hun me, I threw holy 
water at him, to make him disap­
pear. "Et tu, Brute? Then falls 
Caesar," he said with great dignity. 
With words from a scene he had 
rehearsed before, the archvillain of 
the world left my room, like an actor 
playing tragedy with wounds frotn a 
personal sorrow. 
There is an evil part of me that 
makes me nervous: the night shadow 
of a doubt I'm afraid of, a darkness 
hugging the corners of my mind. On 
days like Sunday, when I preach too 
much, making God somewhat smal­
le~ than myself, feeling sorry for 
Him because He may not exist -if 
He does exist, why the suffering? ­
tharDevil comes to tell that God 
bears him a grudge. 
As a member of the De~tl's party, I . 
know that the Devil lies. God doesn't bear grudges, but the Devil nurses a grudge. The Devil resists the mercy to forgive God for being outcast and leperous The sin of not forgiving is tne Vevil's sin against God Who, so fra, seems to have lose most of the 
battles. 

An old lady once praised the Devil 
with the remark: "You've got to 
admit that He's a hard worker. On 
Sunday evenings, when I've finished 
cheerleading, I wish like the Devil 
that I could say ofGod; "He's a hard 
worker.'' 

Mom, Stick to Bingo 
Mrs. Eileen A. F. prominent resi­~ent of che township of Lower Merion, pa. braked to a screeching talt in front of Mapes Five and Dime 1tore :tnd honked her horn. Mr. 
vtapes, a hulking, shapeless m~m ~n tis early fifties, sporting the latest m 1olyester chic, slowly ambled to the :ar window. Mrs. F. whipped a check mt of her wallet. 
''Would you mind cashing this for ne?" 
The check, a ~ood one, too, repre­sented an enure week's worth of grocery money -money to feed the five voracious little mouths at home. Mr. Mapes gazed at the check f.Jr a long moment. His gaze shifted to Mrs. F's face. He looked at the check lgam. 
"Can we make a deal?" 
Apparently, Mr. Mapes had ~otten a hot tip from his bookie at Ltberty Bell race Track. He was talkin1~ a gelding named Black Destroyer 
"Why don't you JUSt l?u a.tJc.:tu and place the bet yourself?' , asked Mrs. 
F. 
"Well, I've already put down some money, and, well, I've gotta pay the help." 
The help, seven punky thirteen year olds, had their ltttle noses pressed against the store window to make sure Mr. Mapes would not try to run away. 
"Look Mrs. F.,ahorse is a sure thing. If you go halves with me on this bet, you could get those new living room curtains." 
"I don't know, I've got a husband and five kids at home.'' "Yeah, and do you got a mink coat at home?" "What race is it?" 
Black Destroyer was running in the 
ninth race. The track was hard and 
fast. The race started precisely at the 
designated time; Black Destroyer ran 
without mishap and finished last. 
That night, Mrs. F. ftxed scrambled 
eggs for dinner. She said she was too 
tired to ftx a big meal. Then after 
dinner, while her family was watch­
ing reruns of "Voyage to the Bottom 
of the Sea," she turned up the T.V . 

really loud so no one cou_ld hear anything, which was good, smce she didn't want anyone to overhear the call she was about to make. Since half the bet was Mr. Mapes', she could therefore extort enough money from him to enable her to fake :it through 
the weekend. 

''What do you mean you can't give me the money yet?" 
"Well, .a lot of those little twerps 
had put in overtime, and cash 
turnover was high today and there's 
nothing in the cash register. What 
can I say?" 
What could Mrs. F. do? 

Her children, sensing' her distress, without understanding its cause, rallied around her to offer their comfort and support. 
"Mom, I need new sneakers." 
"Shut up." 

"Mom, I need them bad. See, my 
toes are sticking out.'' 

"I'll break your toes and then you won't need any sneakers." And so it went. Finally, Mrs. F. became de­sperate. There wereno eggs left to scramble, no hot dogs to defrost. 
The sounds of her 
children wailing for peanut butter 
forced her to extreme measures. 
Storming her way into Mr. Mapes' 
five and dime, she planted herself 
nex t to the cash register, and as the 
Narberth Little League bought their 
post -/ractice bubble gum, she 
snatche . the change from the 
cashier's hand until she had collected 
the amount Mr. Mapes owned her. 
Then, she set about her weekly 
shopping. 

''Why are you giving me such a lousy cut of pork roast,'' she screech­ed at the butcher,'' I had to wait around for two hours while some little creeps at the soda fountain traded Jim Palmer for ] oe Morgan and 
I want value."

Gasoline 
-targets announced 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Energy Department yesterday announced gasoline conserva­tion targets, which each state is expected to meet during the next three months. 
The targets call for a nation­wide reduction of about 6. 7 percent in gasoline use during April, May and June, comparc·d with the corresponding months ::>f 1979. 
The proposed state reductions range from a low oJf 1.1 percent in Wyoming to 17 percent for Alaska. 
Department representatives said the percentages for each state are not actually related to the amount of gasoline used in the states last year. They said the J?ercentages represent an idealized estimate of what last year's figure would have been in each state under "normal" conditions -when adjusted for the effects of weather and fuel shortages, for example. 
The targets set by the depart­ment are voluntary and each stare is to decide how to meet its target. The states are to submit plans to the federal government, detailing ways to achieve the goals. 
DeJ?artment spokeswoman Mana Uharenko said this 
means  an  individual motorists  
can't  tell  what  kind  of  a  
fuel-saving  effort  is  expected.

State initiates plan to combat Curene 442 
ADRIAN, Mich (AP) -The mainly Mexican-American working class people of Sunny­side are struggling to under­stand that they must wear shoes in the summer and keep dust outside because of a substance they cannot see and have no Spanish W()rd for. 
The substance in Curene 442, a synthetic chemical which makes plastic unbreakable. Sci­entists say its yellow particles have permeated the air and soil in Sunnyside, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Adrian. 
The Curene in Sunnyside comes from the Anderson De­velopment Co., the only U.S. manufacturer of the chemical. Chemist Amos Anderson founded the firm in Adrian in 1967 and has made Curene for the past 11 years. 
Residents are mystified by the public debate over Curene ­which has caused tumors in rats and dogs. While it has yet to make any person sick, scientists say Curene may also produce cancer in humans. 
But Curene is a small worry in the lives of l?eople in Sunny­side, who felt tsolated by pover­ty and municipal neglect long before they heard of the chemi­cal. They say they've complain­ed for years about foul indus­trial odors, the lack of running water in many homes, inade­quate sewers and unpaved missioner. "Politically speak­
ing, if it were where the rich 
people live, there would have 
been some imibediate atten­-tion." 
''These poor Chicano and 
white people don't have the 
political clout that, it takes to get 
so'llething done.'' 

Sunnyside didn't even learn of 
the rotential chemical dangers

In Italy, however, gasoline consumption climbed eight percent from the 1978 level despite the price increases. 
U.S. gasoline use fell five percent in the same period.

trolled domestic crude oil pri­
ces are 60 percent below the 
world level, drivers pay 81 
cents a gallon for regular

In many countries, high gaso­
line prices are due not only to 
rising crude oil prices but to 
high taxes as well. 

Taxes make up 53 percent of 
the price of gasoline in Bel­
gium, where a gallon of pre­

Wr. Europeans leave decisions UJ, to Olyntpic committees 

STRASBOURG, France (AP) ­Britain and The Netherlands found no support yesterday from the rest of Western Eu­rope for a boycott of the Moscow Olympic Games. 
An overwhleming majority of the ministers and secretaries of state for sport, meeting under the aegis of the 21-nation Council of Europe, favored leaving the deciswn to their national Olympic committees. 
They said their governments opposed making recommenda­tions to the committees until the approach of the May 24 deadlme for accept~g invita­tions to the Summer Games. 
The Netherlands' Secretary of State for Sport, C.G. Wallis de Vries, said he and his British counterpart, Hector Monro, were the only ministers who spoke in favor of a boycott. 
Sources said France took the lead in opposing anti-Soviet a~tion, SJ,>orts Mini~ter Jea~­Pierre Soisson argumg that 1t would be an intolerable inter­ference of politics in sport. 
Soisson originally opposed e­ven putting the boycott issue on the agenda, threatening to stay away from the meeting, sources said. Later he agreed to attend, provided the talks were discreet and given minimum publicity ­a condition rejected by Britain and West Germany. 
De Vries said he warned his colleagues here that if they went to the Olympics while the Soviet Army was on Afghani­stan soil, they would be letting 
Soaring energy costs may crealte jobs 
for hurnan laborers 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The soaring cost of energy may be prompting employers to return to an old means of production thar some government econo­mists say is becoming cheaper than machines: human labor. 
Labor Department economists estimate that up ito 1 million jobs were create·d in 1979 because businesses have found it economical to substitute la­bor for energy-draining machi­nery. 
Labor Secretary Ray Mar­shall, a trained economist, has been promoting this theory, which has received dther scant attention or skeptical resl?onses from most other economists. 
... The theory suggests that de­spite the jolts that the economy has suffered because of high energy prices, employment will remain healthier than conven­tional forecasts of sharply ris­ing unemrloyment this year. Marshal estimates that of 2 million jobs created in 1979, between 750,000 and 1 million resulted from substituting la­bor for energy, . which rose more than 30 percent in price last year. f "I am seeing it happen all over tbe country,'' Marshall said. "If you reduce the speed limit to conserve fuel, you need more truck drivers. If you're putting in more insulation to keep from losing heat, you need labor to do it." Nancy Barrett, a deputy assis­tant secretary of labor, esti­mates based on the limited research done in this field that each 1 percent rise in the price of energy leads to an increase of about 33,000 jobs. She said this explains why unemployment has st:ruck at 
about 6 percent smce mid­1978, defying economic fore­casts of between 6112 and 7 percent unemployment by the end of 1979. Each 1 percent of unemployment equals about 1 mmion people. 
Ms. Barrett says this trend also may be a main factor in last yea(~ distur~ing decline in . productivity, which measures/ how efficiently goods and ser­vices are produced. President Carter's Council of Economic Advisors, however, rejects this conclusion . 
Marshall's theory does not 

mean that the workforce is actually larg·er because of high­er energy p.rices. The country's 200,000 laid off auto workers can vouch for that. 
Rather, labor-for-energy sub­stitution appears to cushion the harmful eff,ects that rising e­nergy prices might otherwise have caused. For example, Ms. Barrett said,, the rise in energy prices last year slowed econo­mic growth at a cost of 1 million conventional jobs. But that loss may have been fully offset by the iP.crease in ener­gy saving jobs. 
Hostages, guerillas request negotta.ttons 
BOGOTA, Columbia (AP) ­The Colombian government a­greed yesterday to a request from hosta&es and guerrillas in the Domimcan Republic Em­bassy to resume face-to-face negotiations, deadlocked for a week over the guerrillas' de­mand for the release of alleged political prisoners. 
The talks, ftrst set for today, were postponed until Monday after Foreign Minister Diego Uribe Vargas met with Presi­dentJulio Cesar Turbay Ayala, diplomatic and government sources said. 
''At the request of the ambas­sadors held hostages and the chief of the terrorists, the Colombian government has a­greed to resume the negotia­tions," UribeVar_gas told repor­ters as he entered the presiden­tial palace. 
The foreign minister said he received the request Wednes­day in a telephone call from Ambassador Richard Valan, one of the 32 foreign diplomats and others hdd hostages. 

The request for new talks may signal the first major break since the M-19 guerrillas seized the embassy during a diploma­tic reception on Feb. 27. 
Galan called the foreign mini­ster less than 24 hours after Uribe Vargas stated on a na­tionwide radio and television broadcast that the government would not budge on its refusal to meet the guerrillas' "non­negotiable" demand that 28 alleged political prisoners be freed. 
In the broadcast, the govern­ment said reopening the talks indicated a softening of the M-19 position: However, there

But he said he could under­stand other countries "not wanting to take a decision too prematurely.'' 
De Vries said he had the feeling other countries might end up supporting a boycott. He pomted out that no country, not even France, had stated outright that it would attend the Games.

Scenes from eight plays by' Falstaff in a fit of melancholy Shakespeare will be interpreted over old age, and the SJ?urnea 
[continued from page 20] 
"I like having people think I'm conserva­
tive," he admits. "Writers, players, other 
coaches; it's just not me to always be excited 
and -carried away. Sometimes people get the 
wrong impression from that but I can't help 
it. Usually the people who criticize my behavior 
are the people who don't know me very well but 
that's ok, too. I'm all for letting people believf" 
what they want about me." 
A ploy which often times works to his 
advantage when he decides. to call a not-so­
conservative trick play, or give a rare ''fire-and­
brimstone" pre-game talk. 
"You see," he chuckles, "by playing the role 
ofa deadhead conservative, I can surprise a ftw 
people once in a while.·' 
Yet some people, sportswriters especially, _like to intimate that maybe Devine just doesn't 
care. But that isn't the case at all as evidenced 
by the schedule he keeps. On Wednesday, for 
example, he left the office at 7:30 p.m., 
worked at home until 2 a.m. and was on the phone with assistant Brian Boulac shortly after seven the next morning. 
"I just like to pretend I don't care " he sighs. "And if people want to criticize ~e for that, fine. Now if a writer that I really know and respect said something bad about n:te then that would hurt me deeply. And if one of my players said I didn't care, I'd quit this job tomorrow. 
. "You see~ my basic coaching philosophy hmges on betng myself. If I were to offer any advice to a young man starting out :in this business, I'd say just be yourself. " 
The 55-year old Devine has lifetime statistics of 164-54-8 and stands third in the NCAA in total triumphs. He'-s been in the winning locker roo~, at every major bowl game as eitlher an assistant or a head coach and he's been honored with seven post-season all-star head coaching assignments. . 
"Hey," he says with a wink. "Just between you and I, I really do care."

Virginia in the championship game Wednesday. 
"We have two teamds still alive (in the NCAA), and I personally felt that there might be a third one," Olson said. "I thought Ohio State had the best shot of any of us to get in,'' but the Buckeyes lost a 72-68 semifinal to UCLA. 
''There have been some great (Big TEn) teams involved in the tournaments andsome awfully goods teams in the other three that didn't make it," said Olson, referring to Wisconsin. Michigan State and Northwes· tern. 
The Big Ten season was a brutal one, and the league title wasn't decided until the last game of the season when Indiana beat Ohio State. 
There were "upsets" galore, and the three teams taht didn't get postseason bids can brag of beating the top squads: last­place Northwestern toppled Purdue, Wisconsin downed Ohio State and Michigan State whipped Iowa. 
''We've felt all along 
that the Big Ten was the 
toughest basketball conference in America.'' 
The Big Ten schools had such a habit of knocking each other off that when Olson was asked if he was surprised at the outcome of a particular game, he replied, ''I'm suprised at anybody winning anyplace." .

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -Indiana University track L:Oach Sam Bell was listed in critical condition Thursday ll'ter suffering a heart attack earlier in the week, doctors

Bell has coached the Hoosiers to 12 Big Ten champion­ship in cross country, indoor and outdoor track. 

The Big Ten's dominance in postseason play has become a tradition. Indiana won the 1976 NCAA title by defeating Michi­gan, and last year Michigan State bumped off Indiana State for the NCAA crown while Indiana won the NIT at the expense of Purdue. 
''What happened last year with Michigan State and India­na and this year certainly indicate that this is the best conference in America,'' said Olson.

Of the top seven players only

''With a young team, you 1 have to concentrate on doing j what· you do and not on what ' the other team does,'' Crum

said. 

"If you practice against the other team's plays, you get into the game and start thinking about what they are doing, instead of what you are sup­posed to be doing,'' he said. 
But Crum is not ignoring Iowa either.

''They are a lot like Memphis \ State," Crum said of Iowa . ''But they are bigger and have , better players, Iowa will be tough for anybody to beat.'' 
That is something that the 43-year old coach has been trymg to impress on his team. "I've caught these guys living in the past," he said. 
''They've·been watching vid­eotapes all week, but guess which games -Kansas State, Texas A&M, and LSU. I said, 'Look, fellas, if you can't afford to go to the movies, watch videotapes. But do you mind watching Iowa?' They're not old enough to understand.''

drills. The sun was shining brightly, helping the temperature reach into the middle fifties. Nevertheless, yesterday's scheduled opening day for Notre Dame spring football drills was cancelled. 
Despite the somewhat-unseasonable warm weather, the grounds at Cartier Field are not quite thawed out. The frozen patches of earth forced the football coaching staff to 'lleet and temporarily suspend all sprins football activity. tn f~ t, there is a good chance that nothmg will commence until after Easter break, due to the number of mid-term exams next week. 
Irish coach Dan Devine did accomplish something yesterday, however. He signed Greg Golic, brother of former Irish linebacker Bob, to a letter of intent. Golic, a

Iowa Coach Olson singspraises ofBig Ten 
lOW 1\ CITY, Iowa (1\P) ­
When Coach Lute Olson isn't 
~inging the praises of lova 
basketball, he's gald to talk 
about the gloric~s of the E·ig 
Ten. 
"We've felt all along that the

since the expanded tournament 
field that people have found out 
how tough the confe renee is '' 
Seven Big Ten teams got posrseason tournament bids this year -the most from any conference 10 the country. The closest competitors were the Atlantic Coast with six entries and the PAC 10 with five. 
The top fc,ur finishers in the Big Ten -Indiana, Ohio State, Purdue, and Iowa-were invited to the NCAA tournament, while Minnesota, Michigan and Illi­noise went to the NIT. 
Purdue and Iowa are in the NCAA semifinals, along with the PAC lO's UCLA and Louis­ville of the Southeast Confe renee.

[continued on page 17] 
.Believe it or not, Devine cares 
In anything as transient as a university commumty the patterns of change are a wistfully accepted way of life. Freshmen grow Frank up to become sophomores, juniors become seniors and, at Notre Dame, seniors turn into card-carrying, money-giving alumni, complete LaGrotta with green hats, leprechaun neckties and rwo 

tickets to every football game but U.S.C. That's 
why they never make soap operas about college 
life. Everything happens too fast. 
Dan Devine has srent the greater part of his 
life involved with al of ic--26 of his 30 years in 
coaching have been at the college level so he's 
had some time to observe the changes. 
"Oh, the environment is different around 
colleges today," he ponders. "But the 
important element, the kids, are basically the 
same. I have this notion, although sometimes it 
appears a bit naive, that a coach is a teacher. 
At least I like to believe that's my primary role. 
When I was at Mi~souri, they granted me a full 
professorship complete with academic tenure.'' 
And he likes what he's teaching. 
''I have fun coaching football,'' he smiles. ''I love my job 1d I love the people I work with. In fact, the thing I enjoy most is getting to talk to my players and help them through problems boLh on the field and off. It isn't easy being a coach, but it's very rewarding." 
And the rewards don't rest exclusively in the myriad of plaques and trophies that adorn the plaid-pafere~ w~lls (blue and gree~ plaid, wh~t else?) o Devme s tastefully-appomted office. 
.On one wall there's a plaque proclaiming him a Cavanaugh Hall Fellow; on another is the momenta that marks his being named the National Football League's Coach and Man of the Year. He's got game balls and game photos and game paintings and even a congressional proclamation that "officially" made Notre Dame the number one football 
team in 1977. However, he h~s little trouble selecting the most meaningful piece in the collection. 
.. 

"You could have everything in this office but the game balls and this,'' he says, holding a plaque that hangs right next to the door whtch reads: 
"To Dan Devine and the Fighting Irish -Thanks for never giving up The Notre Dame Student Body'' 
''They gave me this after we lost to Southern Cal rwo years ago in that comeback in the Coliseum," he points out proudly. "It means an awful lot to me. '' 
And it's one of the reasons he's as excited about this year's spring practice as he was the first time he stepped on a football field with a whistle. 
"I love it," he says. "But you have to love it because if you don't the pressures and problems will get to you." 
That's something else he's familiar with-­pressures and problems. You see, one does not follow a legend like Vince Lombardi at Green Bay without fe-eling the r.ressure. One does not take over for someone ltke Ara Parseghian at a place like Notre Dame without much more of the sam~. Yet he willingly accepted both positions with equal aplomb. Why? The answer rests in another aspect of Dan Devine's personality that most people never see. "I guess I like pressure," he grins. "In fact, you might say I thrive on it.'' 
Which comes as a surprise to someone first observing his almost sleepy mild manner and passive, soft-spoken ways.

Crum plans ~othing new for Iowa 6~;~t :~!r"ll: tr.~~~i~;e r., 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) ­
Louisville Coach Dennv Crum 
has revealed his secret plan for 
defeating Iowa in Saturday's 
NCAA semifinal basketball 
game at Indianapolis. 

"We're not going to do anything different," Crum said after a recent l?ractice. "If you can't win by domg what got you where you are, then you can't win at all." 
The Cardinals got where they are by cm 1bining a blistering full-court press with a fast­break offense. Their 31-3 record attests to the success of Crum 's strategy in his ninth year at Louisville. 
"We want to make the other teams play the full 94 feet for the entire game," he said. 
"Very few teams have been 
able to keep up with us." 
Part of Crum' s rationale for 
using the press is that ''with 
our size and youth we'd get 
killed if we didn't force the 
other teams to play our style." 
However, Crum admits that that style of play has also caused some/roblems for the second-ranke Cardinals. 
"We are a quick, explosive team that plays with a lot of emhusiasm. But the constant press causes spurts," Crum said. 
Those spurts showed up dramatically in Louisville's NCAA Midwest Region victor­ies. Two of the games ended in overtime. 
Against Kansas State in its first tournament game, Louis ville squandered a 61-54 lead with 7:44 remaining to force an overtime with the score 67-67. The Cardinals won 71-69 on a last-second shot. 

In the second round against Texas A&M, Louisville out­
scored the  Aggies  13-2  in  
overtime  to  pull  out  a  66-5 5  
victory.  

And a~ainst Louisana State in the Mtdwest Championship game, Louisville trailed by as many as eight points in the ftrst half. In typical Cardinal fash­ion, they spurted to a 31-29 advantage at halftime, and went on to win, 86-66.

ND rele.ases sports proposal to comply with Title IX 
by Michael Lewis Exe_cutive News Editor 

Notre Dame released its long-awaited proposal to comply with Title IX Saturday, calling for a major women's basketball program, cutbacks in the present hockey program, and major efforts to "improve athletic revenues" by charging students for football tickets, raising ticket prices, and creating an athletic endowment. 
Hockey is the only current sports program that will lose scholarships under the proposal. The plan will be presented to the Board ofTrustees for approval, probably when the full Board meets on campus beginning May 2. 
In a major break with tradition, Notre Dame students will be charged for football tickets. Students will be able to buy tickets at a 50 percent discount. The plan calls for an increase in football ticket price to $12 per game, so students can expect pay $6 per game next fall. 
The initial women's grant-in-aid will be concentrated in women's basketball, which is expected to begin Division I competition in three to four years. The University's women's team currently competes in Division III. 
Athletic Director Edward krause said the University will ''go all out" to field a top-flight women's team, but said that other women's sports will receive grants-in-aid "right away." 
Krause did not know exactly how many scholarships will be offered to women ne·xt year. Richard "Digger" Phelps, coach of the ND men's ream, will assume overall responsibility for the women's program. 
Krause added that the University will begin interviews for a new coach of the women's team, and that current coach Sharon Petro will be one of those considered. 
The University will reduce the cost of hockey by decreasing hockey scholarships from 20 to 18 next season. Further cuts were The three student aid granted." .

JERUSALEM (AP) -In a decision likely to complicate already stalled palestinian au­tonomy negotiations, the Israe­li Cabinet voted for the first time to let Jews settle in an occupied Arab city. 
The Cabinet approved by an 8-6 vote, with three absten­tions, a proposal to establish two schools in which Jewish students would live full-time in the Arab city of Hebron on the West Bank of theJordan River. 
The last Jewish residents of · Hebron lefi the city after Arab rioting in 1929. 
Opponents of the settlement plan said they would appeal the vote to the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee in the Israeli Parltament, and Prime Minister Menachem Begin a­greed to delay action until the committee meets. The Parlia­ment begins a one-month re­cess Thursday. 
Israel has built more than 50 settlements on the occupied West Bank but has not allowed Jews to settle in Arab cities. However, Begin has come un­der pressure from right-wing Israelis to carry out the Hebron move. 
The settlement issue is re­garded as one of the major stumbling blocks to a success­ful conclusion, targeted for May 26, of Palestinian autono­my negotiations. There has been little progress in the talks to determme the nature and extent of the autonomy, and President Carter has sum­moned Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to Washington for separate meet­ings mext month.

Begin said yesterday. he would respond in the next few days to a letter he had receive d from Sadat and would call a special Cabinet session before leaving for his meeting with Carter. 
Israei news reports said the letter from Sadat to Begin placed responsibility for the outcome of the autonomy talks entirely on Israel. The Egyp­tians have placed greater em­phasis on progress being made by the date set in the Camp David peace accords. 
Israel, Egypt and the United States began negotiations on Palestinian autonomy last May with a one-year deadline for establishing an autonomous A­rab administration on the West Bank and Gaza Strip where there are 1.2 million Palestini­an Arabs. The territories were occupied by Israel in the Mid­east War of 1967. 
The United States and Egypt have been pressing for an end to Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Washington has criticized the settlements as an obstacle to peace. 
The Israeli cabinet declared in February that Jews have the right to settle anywhere in the Btblical land of Israel, which includes the West Band and Hebron, a city of 50,000 Arabs 20 miles south of Jerusalem that is the burial site of the Patriarch Abraham and is con­sidered holy by both Moslems and Jews. 
However, the vote on the Hebron settlements was post­poned more than a month because of its controversial nature. 
Cabinet spokesman John Salem said after yesterday's severn-hour meeting: ''The political implication of the de­cision was the main issue discussed." He also said the Cabinet wanted to make it "very clear and very direct" that Jews would not be barred from Hebron or anywhere else.

Student fees for football tickets, a first for Notre Dame, is part of the attempt to increase athletic revenues. With the ticket price increase and the student fee, next season will probably bring record gate receipts for ND football. University President Fr. Theordore Hesburgh said the time had· come to charge students for football tickets. ''I think we were the only school in the world that gave free football tickets to its students," he said. "Now we can't." 
Krause said he believes the student fee will not affect student attendance. "Students pay for hockey and basketball, why not football," he said. 
The proposal also calls for the establishment of an athletic endowment to help meet the costs of the University's varsity, club and intramural sports, but neither the statement nor Krause could offer specifics on this endowment. 
Hockey coach Cha.rles "Lefty" Smith called the endowment "a great move." "It has to be done in this day and age," he said .

OPENING THIS MONTH AT A THEATRE NEAR YOU! 
ly Katie Gilligan 
Due to the recent rise in the tuition feees at Saint Marv's for the 80-81 school year, many students have expressed con· cern in regards to meeting this increased financial demand. However, according to Director of Financial Aid, Kathleen ) effnies, a substantial rise in available institutional funds should permit a bmad range of distribution. 
These funds, which include grants, scholarships and en· dowments, are awarded on the basis of individual need. Although 53 percent of the Saint Mary's student body is on some type of financial aid, the rise in tuition will only affect the institutional scholar­ship funds. As)effries points out, there will be more funds, and not necessarily more scholarships. In this way, either more lower-figure awards can be given, or per­year's expected enrollment does not show a marked in­crease in those wanting finan­cial assistance. 
Like all types of loans, money from Saint Mary's institutional funds is distributed on the basis of need. "Need" is defined by the family's income, assets, current debts, medical or unusual expenses, the num-· ber of dependents, and the number of dependents enrolled at the post-secondary level. The family is expected to pay a calculated sum, which will then be accompanied by the aid. Although this calculation is federally mandated, there is no clear cut-off point when deter­mining the eligibility of a family. 
Another financial aid division at Saint Mar/s, the Work/ Study Program, which received a $68,000 increase in funds over the '78-'79 school year, is hoping for equal assistance. 
Last year, the program re­

government are used w pay for 
80 percent of the s1udenrs' 
wages, while Saint Mary's 
pays the remaining 20 percent. 
If, however, a student is employed by the college but not because of financial need, then Saint Mary's must pay the full salary. 
Therefore, because there are 
a frozen number of available 
jobs, it is financially advanta­
geous for the college to employ 
only those involved in the 
Work/Study Program. The 
money that Saint Mary's would 
have to use to pay those· not in 
the program can then be 
reallocated for other programs, 
including the institutional 
scholarship program. 
Despite the tuition hike, and 
the rate of inflation, ) effries 
stated that the number of those 
who would seek financial aid 
for the '80-'81 school year 
would remain "fairly con­
stant'', with the possibility of 
only a "slight increase." 
haps, fewer, but more expen­sive ones, can be distributed. During this school year, $330,095 was available, yet due to the new tuition increase, there will be approximately $336,310 available to the stu­dents. Currently, ~·85 students are using these funds, and next 
ceived only $46,260 as opposed to this year's originally slated $75,000 which rose to $114,725. Next year's figures are undeterminable at this time, but ) effries promises a ''comparable student work pro­gram.'' 
The funds received from the 

[continued from page 1] 
three percent, and interest on a Guaranteed loan is seven per­cent. "In the Higher Educa­tion Amendments pending leg­islation, an increase from three to seven percent is proposed for the NDSL," Russo said. 
''The Guaranteed Student Loan faces a possible increase from seven to nine percent. These increases from seven to nine percent. These increases may affect the 1981-82 term." 
''It is not impossible that the budget cutbacks wiH create problems for students this fall, but they will most probably affect students this trme next year," Russo said. "Lender participation in the Guaran.teed Student Loan progr~Lm ts a problem. At pres<:nt, the government pays lenders up to 16 percent on student loans. This is done to increase the availability of loans for stu­dents. If controls and limits are put down, the availability of loans will be reduced. Fewer lenders will be willing to put up with the red tape and possible additional costs.'' 
''The Guaranteed Student Loan program is the most commonly used loan program at Notre Dame," Russo said. "The costs of the program are spiraling." 
''Many students attending private schools have a limited choice between public and private institutions,'' Russo said. "The effects of Carter's budget cut could make it more difficult for these students to attend private institutions." 
Russo added that because of the elections, the significant changes in federal aid will probably not take place until the 1981-82 school year. 
"Public pressure in an election year from middle families who benefit from these programs will greatly offset a major change for the 1980-81 (school) year."

Sr. Maureen Feedler lectures on Catholic viewpoint ofERA 
by Mary Ellen Woods 

Sr. Maureen Feedler, repre­senting Catholics for ERA, addressed a small crowd in the Library Auditorium Lounge last night. In her lecture, Feedler presented a Catholic perspec­tive on the Equal Rights Amendment. 
Drawing from "a distinctive Catholic, religious and scriptor­al tradition," Sr. Feedler ex­amined the text of the ERA. She pointed out that the pro­posed amendment consisted of only 52 words. 
The amendment is prohibi­tive, she emphasized. It does not force any action, nor is there any connection with abor­
tion  or  the  use  of  lavatory  
facilities.  
''Equality for  men  and  wo­ 

men is an integral part of the Judeo-Christian tradition," noted Feedler. Vatican II, for­mal Church doctrine, states that any form of discrimination is contrary to God's intent. Sr. Feedler sees ERA as an imple­mentation of the teachings of Vatican II. She also pointed to the gospel as a norm for equal rights, citing Jesus' treatment of the women of his day. 
Sr. Feedler emphatically told the audience of the situation today for the women of Amer­ica. "Women earn $.59 for every $1 that men earn," explained Sr. Feedler, quoting a U.S. Government report. 
This situation is not getting better. ''In fact the difference is broadening," she said. In the last decade, women earned $.63 for every $1 earned by men. 
This discriminatory situation can only be corrected by ERA, according to Feedler. The ERA will guarantee equal rights for both men and women. 
Sr. Feedler proposed to end her often dramatic presentation with a discussion of the myths and distortions surrounding the ERA. In fact, her comments were concerned solely with the connection of abortion and the proposed amendment. 
''The ERA is guilty by asso­ciation in regards to the ques­tion of its relation to abortion,'' demonstrated Sr. Feedler. 
ERA has no legal connection with abortion, according to Feedler. It proports to deal with the protection of those rights that are of concern to both men and women. As Sr. Feedler pointed out, men cannot be­come pregnant. Pregnancy be­ing a necessary precondition to the desire for an abortion, the question of equal rights and abortion can and will not be tied to ERA, she said. 
The floor was then opened to questions from the audience. Sr. Feedler was asked to com­ment on the need for ERA in light of the Fourteenth Amend­ment and the Civil Rights Amendments. She noted that as presently interpreted, "these are not grounds for protection against sex discrimination. " · 
An interesting point was 
raised regarding the benefits of 
ERA to men. According to Sr. 
Feedler, the rights to be grant­
ed alimony and child custody, 
as well as the responsibility of 
women to aid in military duty 
would be of service to men. 

The discussion frequently de­volved to heated debate as Sr. -Feedler was asked to defend ERA against ar~uments ques­tioning its effectivity, relevancy and ability to protect the rights of women in particular situa­tions. Sr. Feedler replied con­fidently, if emotionally, that she knew how the amendment would be implemented, point­ing to the ridiculousness of the fear that men and women would be forced to share the same rest room facilities. 
Sr. Feedler requested sup­port of the Notre Dame· com­munity in the up-coming na­tional, Pro-ERA march on Chicago on May 10. The march on Ch1cago is viral, according to Sr. Feedler, in the drive to have Illinois ratify ERA before the 1982 deadline.

ded that there was no set procedure for handling this type of incident. 
According to Terry, the guards' version of the incident differed from Geraci's. The guards claimed it was Geraci who was belligerent when he tried to get his ID returned. 
Terry said the matter will be handled confidentially. ''Any problems with personell is a 
confidential matter. What I 
decide could possibly lead to 
friction on campus, which 
would not be good," he said. 
Geraci could file a complaint with Roemer against Terry's actions, according to Terry. He added, however, that his decision concerning the guards would be final. 
Geraci said he would talk with Terry about the matter before going to Roemer.

''I'm going to stay in the

television interview before he 
toured a poor black neighbor­
hood in New York City and met 
with Orthodox Jews. 
The Massachusetts senator, who so far has won only two primary and caucus contests compared with President Car­ter's 18 election triumphs, again attacked Carter's hand­"ling of economic, energy and 
foreign issues. 
Kennedy said he would not 
withdraw from the race even if 
Democratic Party leaders asked 
him to. 
Meanwhile, a Gallup poll 
done for Newsweek magazine 
said Carter and Reagan were 
running about neck and neck in 
vm....-s' eyes if they are the 
major party nominees. Forty­
five percent of those question­
-::d leaned toward Carter and 44 
percent toward Reagan in the 
poll, which has a margin of 
error of 4 percent either way. 
Forty-eight percent, inci­
dentally, replied that they 
thought the primaries thus far 
were not a good way to choose 
the best-qualified candidates, 
while 40 percent approved of 
the system.

Senate debates balancing the budget 
_A receptive audience was captivated by this performer's vzbraphone solo at the C}F Saturday night. [photo by P. johnson] 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Re­publicans and Demotrats are squaring off in the Senate to see which stde can come up with a more appealing plan for ba­lancing next year's federal bud­get. 
The Senate has set aside 
tomorrow for debating the 
~eparate approaches, both of 
which would result in a balance 
between spending and income 
in the 12 months that begin 
next Oct. 1. 
The Republ\::an version go a step further and limit spending during that period to a fixed percentage of national income -a move that Democrats insist would force severe cuts in many programs. 
. Whi1e the Senate prepares instructions for its Budget Com­mittee, the House will consider the spending plan already rec­ommended by its budget­writers. That plan would cut $16. 5 billion from the budget submitted by President Carter in]anuary and would result in a $2-billion surplus. 
Rep. Robert Giaimo, D­Conn., chairman of the House Budget Committee, anticipates problems in getting that budget passed. The reason: liberal Democrats insist the budget­cutting fever would gut social programs they've been swear­mg by for years. 
With inflation running at an annual rate of 18 percent, the drive to reduce government spending and balance the bud­get has taken on new life this year. The Carter administration and congressional leaders say a balanced budget will be a major signal to workers and to finan­cial markets that the govern­ment means business in the 

publicans have signed the GOP 
plan, which is sponsored princi­
pally by Sen. Bill Roth, R-Del. 
That resolution simply directs 
the Senate Budget Committee 
to ensure that the next budget 
does not exceed 21 percent of 
the Gross National Product, a 
measure of all goods the nation 
produces. 
That would limit spending to either $596 billion, as Roth says, or $584 billion, according to Democratic opponents. 
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, chairman of the Budget Com­mittee, insisted such limitations would make it more difficult for Congress to deal with the ups-and-downs of the economy and would force unr(;alistic cuts in spending. 
In an effort to sidetrack the Roth resolution, Muskie won endorsement by the Democratic 
Caucus of a substitute that 
would require a balanced bud­
get and earmark any surplus for 
tax cuts. And to give the Senate 
a clear choice, 1t would show 
where additional cuts could be 
made in order to reach the 
21-percent level preferred by 
Roth. · 

The Senate will continue 
talking this week about Carter's 
propose~ ."windfall-pr?fits" tax 
on the otlmdustry, whtch also is 
a major part of the war on 
inflation. 

Re~ublica':l-led opponents of 
the btl!, whtch would cost oil producers and royalty owners an estimated $227.7 billion in the 1980s, are drawing out the debate in an effort to force the convening of a new Senate­House conference committee that would write a more accept­
able version.

Later, at an "agriculture day" of parity -a subsidized farm price level intended to give farmers the same purchasing power they had before World War I. "I am not as familiar with some things like that,'' he replied as a murmur of sur­pnse swept his audience of farmers.

The win was coach Tom Fallon's 349th in his 24-year career, surpassing fencing mentor Mike DeCicco for se­cond place on Notre Dame's :til-time coaching victory list. Only retired baseball c0ach Jake Kline has more wins with 
552. Fallon also posted 62 wins as wrestling coach before 1969, bringing hi!:> grand total to 412. 
Saturday's gr<~dge match with Indiana State was sweet re­venge for the h ish who lost to the Sycamores a year ago, 6-3. The match was all but decided following the six singles competitions with Notre Dame winning four of them. 
McMahon did away with Tin Capulong, 6-2, 7-5 and junior Mark Hoyer battled to a hard­fought victory over Chuck Nor­man in the number four singles match 7-5, 7-6 (5-4). Sopho­mores Tom Hartzell and Tom Robinson wasted little time in beating Galen Scott and Steve Huda<k at the number five anp six singles respectively, 6-1, 6-0 and 6-3, 6-1. Robison improved his singles record to 5-I, best on the team.

"We're about where we ex­pected to be at this point,'' said Fallon. "Things are looking very good for ~he rest of the season, and that goal of 20 wins still isn't out of the question. We can only afford one more loss, but with the great attitude on this team, we may not lose any. The leader­ship this year has been great with Carlton (Harris, senior

Fallon will take the team to sunny Mexico City and Acapul­co, Mexico, on Thursday after­noon for a ten-day, ten-match workout/vacation. The team will be the guest of a group of former Irish players under Fallon. "The major objective of a trip of this nature is conditioning," says Fallon. "Playing a match a day on mostly clay courts in Mexico's high altitude would get any­body into top shape. ·' 
The Irish will need to be in top form upon their return as they will play 15 matches in a 23-day span starting with Bel­larmine on Friday. April 11 is the first match of the Notre Dame Quadrangular Tourna­ment. ''I'm looking for the team to be playing it's best tennis right after we get back.

Despite his claim that New York--where a whopping 282 Democratic convention dele­gates were at stake--would put his withering challenge to President Caner back on track, the latest polls indicated that Kennedy would reap only ruin from the Empire State. 
The New York Daily News said that while Kennedy ran about even among the state's Jewish voters--about one-third ·of the total--he still trailed the president by 20 points, or 56 to 36. 
At least two Kennedy aides were _P-repared to tell him to quit 1f he loses New York badly. But Kennedy said he wouldn't do that, since he was "chemically and viscerally" suited to nothing less than a fight to the end. 
On the Repub!ican side, front-runner Ronald Reagan was already a winner in New York, where the GOP contest effectively boiled dovn to a choice between his slates of delegates and those who were uncommitted. There was no preferential vote in the GOP ballotting, in which a total of 123 delegates were allocat­ed.

Democratic Party 'gag' tape causes officials embarassment 
WASHINGTON (AP) -If the Republicans needed any help in lampooning President Car­ter, they could have gotten· it last weekend from none other than Democratic Party head­quarters. 
Callers who dialed a certain telephone number at the Democratic National Commit­tee heard a recorded spoof of the president, complete with background banjo music, taped excerpts from Carter speeches and at least one raw expletive from a country-rock star at a Carter concert. 
Embarrassed Democrats said the message, entitled "Quest for the Presidency 1976," was all a terrible mistake. 
It was a parry tape, they said, and was bemg used in a live test of telephone equip­ment for a dial-in message service at the Democratic Na­tional Convention in New York next August. 
When party officials dis­covered yesterday that people had learned of the gag tape and were dialing the number at Democratic headquarters to lis­ten to it, the tape was quickly yanked. 
"We were just testing out the equipment," pleaded Bob Hirschfeld, chief of broadcast services for the committee's news department. "We weren't expecting anyone to call during that time. That number has been out of service for at least a year and a half.'' 
Hirschfeld said he erased the entire three-minute tape. "It will never be on agam," he said. 
On the tape, heard by re­porters before it was removed from the (>layback machine, a serious-vmced narrator said Carter obtained "seed money" to start his 1976 presidential campaign by· signing on as a donor for the ''Atlanta Sperm Bank."

Concerning Iran 

U.S. w-arns against retaliation 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The 

United States warned Iran 
sterday against punishing

f:
e American hostages held in 
ehran as retaliation for the 

eparture of the deposed shah from Panama. 
Insisting that the decision of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to leave Panama for Egypt was made by the former monarch alone, Carter administration of­ficials also tried to cool tempers in Tehran by offering to improve relations once the 4 Vz-month-old hostage cnsts ends. 
The officials said the Soviets pose a common danger to U.S. and Iranian interests in the Persian Gulf and reaffirmed an offer to discuss American aid after the 50 American hostages are liberated. 
The shah's sudden departure from Panama on Sunday upset "the hell out of people" in 
Tehran, a senior administration official acknowledged. And yet he dismissed a threat by Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkahi, an Iranian prosecutor, to put the Americans on trial and then jail them. The official said this 
was "not a very fOssible or probable outcome.' 
Even so, the administration 
issued a warning through State 
Department spokesman Hod­
ding Carter that ''the Iranian 
government is aware of the 
consequences and condemna­
tion that would take place" if 
the hostages were tried. 
A White House official, who asked that he not be identified, indicated the administration does not attach "the same degree of concern'' to the trial threat that it did when Iranian officials earlier suggested the Americans could be placed be­fore courts. 
''The concern we would feel has not changed," this official said, "but our assessment of the problem is certainly less than it was before." 
For the most part, officials within the administration in­dicated they felt the ultimate fate of the American hostages would not be affected by the shah's move to Egypt. He left Panama after two presidential advisers, Hamilton Jordan and Uoyd Cutler, held quiet nego­tiations with those in his entourage. 
The Iranian government had

Panama has  no  extradition

Iranian officials had taken a number of steps to circumvent that problem. 
Still, the White House of­ficials said flatly that "there was never any prospect that the shah would have been extradited to Iran and that was made clear to him and to his people.'' 
The families of the hostages were assured on Saturday that the shah would not return to the United States. "He (the shah) had made no request to come back here," the White House official said. "Those in­volved did not consider that to be the best option.'' 
However, another U.S. offi­cial said the option of returning to the United States was open to the shah but that he and his doctors decided against it. ·

to the hostage issue.'' 
Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkali, a 
leading Iranian revolutionary 
and former chief judge, told 
reporters in Rome that hostages 
accused of espionage would be 
put on trial and jailed if found 
guilty. ' 
He said the trials would take place after Iran's new Parlia­ment convenes--something not expected before mid-April at the earliest, Khalkhali, a mem­ber of the Parliament, also said the other hostages would be freed at that time. Khalkhali was in Rome en route to Libya for an official visit. 
It was also clear that the shah and those around him wer:e worried by Panama's willing­ness to consider the Iranian extradition request--even though some Panamanian offi­cials said he would never be sent back to Iran. 
Looking ha~gard and much older than hts 60 years, the shah was met by Sadat at the Cairo airport. The two accom­panied by their wives, took a helicopter to the Maadi military hospital, near the Nile five miles south of the cir:y

U.S. officials said medical reasons led the shah to accept Sadat's long-standing invitation to reside in Egypt. The shah's doctor's say he requires sur­gery to remove an enlarged and 
. possibly cancerous spleen, but U.S. specialists and Panama­nian physicians had been wran­gling over who would be res­ponsible for the operation in Panama. 
Iran's prosecutor general was one of the first !raman officials to react to the news that the shah had flown to Egypt. 
Denouncing Sadat as an American "stooge," Siyed Ka­rim Moussavi Ardabili said the shah's move was"a violation of international laws" that "is going to cause great difficulties

JETMORE, Kan. (AP) More 
than 100 travelers huddled in 
this small southwestern Kansas 
town yesterday after spending 
the night on pews behind\ the 
pulpit when they were stranded 
by one of the worst blizzards in 
the state this century. 
The 135 unexpected over­night guests at the United Presbyterian Church, inclu.ding a baseball team from a Colora­do junior college. were amoung thousands who took rc::fuge from the snowstrom across. the state at motels, National Guard armories and evena city jail. 
The storm also left up to a foot of snow in the Oklahoma panhandle, where rescue crews freed dozens ofpeople stranded in snowbound vehicles Sunday night. ''The area is paralyzed,'' said Phil Shideler of the National Weather Service in Topeka. Winds up to 45 mph accornpan­nied the fast moving strorm and reduced visibility to near zc:ro in some spots.

town. 
''They were really worried because there were children in the other cars. The mothers were here from 6 o'clock until about 9:30 and the sheriff came in carrying the kids. It was quite a poignant reunion. There were a lot of tears and kisses." 
The 22-member baseball team from Trinidad State ju­nior Colle~e was also stranaed overnight m the church.

Explosion sears offshore site 
GALVESTON, Texas (AP) ­
An explosion and fire seared 
an offshore drilling platform in 
the Gulf of Mc:~xico early 
yesterday, killing two men, 
mjuring 29, and leaving four 
persons missing, officials said. 
The rig, drilling a gas well 
about 100 miles off the upper , Texas coast, en1pted mto flames in the pre-dawn hours, sending men in the crew of 41 scurryin~ for safety. Only six 
escaped mjury. 
The Coast Guard in Galves­
ton said a fixed wing aircraft, a 
helicopter and the cutter Pont 
M?~oe were searching for the 
mtssmg crewmen, who were 
said to have been in the 
vicinity of the explosion. 
Wild well fighter Red Adair put a crew on a n~:arby rig to assess the damage and deter­mine how best to put out the. raging fire. 
The cause of the explosion was under investigation. 
The survivors were taken by boat to another rig five miles away to await medical person­nel airlifted from the coast. 
Helicopters ferried them to John Sealy Hospital in Galves­ton. All 29 injured, many on

noon, said Sealy spokesman 
Miles Kanape. 
Fourteen were treated and 
released Kanape said, and 
others were admitted or held 
for observation. The injuries 
ranged from burns to "mul­
tiple trauma" involving frac­
tures, abrasions and cuts, he 
said. 

A medical corpsman who had flown to the scene told some reporters vhat many men were injured when they donned life jackets and jumped into the water. However, a company spokesman said evacuation capsules were used.. The plat­form itself is about 100 feet above the water line. 
The drlling platform is oper­ated by Pennzoil for a group of owners, but Pennzoil had only one man on the rig, said com­pany spokesman Bob Harper in Houston. The others were con­tract workers for Pool Offshore Co., located in Harvey, La. 
Rescue operations were hampered by high winds and waves as a cold front moved through the area.

seriously injured had to be tied to the platform to keep from being blown overboard. But at about 7:15a.m. it managed to lift off with the first of the injured for the trip to Galves­ton, which took more than an hour. 
Harper said many of the men got off the platform via two evacuation capsules, which he 
said  "look  a  lot  like  flying  
saucers."  Each  holds  28  
persons.  

-The capsules are completely sealed and have a small power unit aboard that allows persons inside to lower the unit mto the water and then move at rela­tively slow speeds. 
''Our boats picked them out of the capsules," Harper said. "We had a 185-foot work boat and a 90-foot standby boat at the rig. That's standard proce­dure." 
One 19-year-old survivor, Gary Owen, who worked for a caterer, told his father he had ridden the evacuation capsule. YoungOwen, who suffered cuts 
on hts. elbow and kneecaps, 
would ilot discuss his 
experience.

the Physical Education De­partment and guided the Irish wrestlers for 18 years. In 1957 he added tennis to his coaching duties, a job he has come to cherish more and more as the years pass. 
"Maybe I'm mellowing out as I get older," admits Falllon, "but I've enjoyed coaching more the last couple of sea­sons, mostly because of the types of kids. we've had ~he great leadership. I find a h1gh positive correlation between good leadership, a good cap­tain and the success of the team. We had that last year with Mark (Trueblood) and again this year with Ca1rlton (Harris)." 
A whole lot of intc:rnal 
leadership and a little das.h of 
Tom Fallon--the secret to Notre 
Dame's success for the past 25 
years. "You name the cap­
tain," he says, "and I'll tell 
you whether or not it was a 
good season." 
Fallon knows what his job is, 
and does it well. "I find that 
when lou get to the college 
level o coaching, most of these 
k;1s games are set. Thc:re's 
not a whole lot you can do 
about individual technique. 
Take (Mark) McMahon (this

year's number one singles player), for example. It would take major surgery to give him a big serve," he says with a smile. "But it's amazing what attitude can do. Sometimes when these kids get really enthused about it, they play better than they're capable of. I don't think the coach is as much a motivator as the team's morale and the leadership of the captain. 
''You name the captain , and I'11 tell you whether or not it was agood 
season.'' 
''The job of a college coach today is to offer the best in the way of facilities, opportunity to develop, organization, a good schedule ana a certain amount of discipline." 
As the 63-year old coach reflects on his tennis career, certain moments highlight the Fallon era. What would any coach remember better than the year his team won it all? 

ally, we tied Tulane under the scorin~system the~r had then." But h1s is quick to point out, "We'd have won hands down ifwe'd had the present scoring system, but they'd only let you take four players at the time." 
Since then, Fallon has wracked up an impressive 350-131 tennis record, second only to retired baseball coach Jake Kline on the all-time Notre Dame coachi1ng victories list. Including hiis wrestl~ng wins, Fallon totals 412 behmg Kline's 552. Add to that four Eastern Collegiate Champion­ships and 21 (on th,e w~y to 22) winning seasons, and lt spells nothing but success. 
Fallon realizes that there are a number of teams in the country that his teams could never compete with ... but they do, nonetheless. "The kids don't mind losing to Michigan 9-0," he says, "because they know that they'll never im­prove playing wc:aker oppo­nents.'' 
At present, the: university allots two full scholarships for Fallon to divide as he pleases, three grants fewe:r than the NCAA's maximum limit of five, a situation he is willing to live with. 
''Ifwe had a full scholarship program here, ther,e's no doubt m my mind that we'd be nationally ranked every year, but I'm not sure it's worth the they go to .a sc~ool a~d 
announce they re gomg to wm the NCAA championship their freshman year and them go pro. As acoach and a teacher, I'm not sure I want that guy. The high turnover rate hurts the other guys on the team, and that guy isn't getting out of college what a student-ath­lete should--a meaningful de­gree. 
"'"Most top-20 schools have gone all the way in terms of time and money," he adds. For example, they now have about five indoor tournaments during the winter. At the last NCAA meetings, I asked a guy from Princeton, 'How can your kids afford that much time away from school? The mini-do it. In aU justification, I couldn't take these kids away 
from school for that long. " 
It seems that every week we hear about another athlete or group of athletes that received credit for a course he or she never took or has someone else take an exam or some other unethical (not to mention ille­gal) tactic, somehow connected to making their team the very best. In the long run, both the school and the athlete suffer.
