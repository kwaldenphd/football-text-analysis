Student participation in the census is important to city 
By JANICE O'LEARY 
News Writer 
Sunday, April 1, is the bicen­tennial anniversary of the United States census; census questionnaires will be dis­tributed in the Notre Dame dorms on April 2 through April 19. 
Not everyone will receive the same form, according to Assis­tant Director of Residence Life for Student Affairs Pat Doran. Every sixth student will receive a "long form" and it is very im­portant that these be fill~d out, he said. 
The different forms will have a specific and definite time pe­riod during which they must be completed and turned in, said Doran. 
Doran and John Keane, dean of the College of Business Ad­ministration and ex-director of the Census Bureau, stressed that it is very important for students to fill out these census questionnaires. Students are counted in the census at school, not at home, said Keane. 
If Notre Dame students do not complete the forms it will be detrimental to the entire South Bend community since the number of people in a city determines the amount of money allocated to that area. This money includes federal, state and local funds, Keane said. 
Foreign students should also fill out the questionnaires even if they are not U.S. citizens since the census is an account of the "usual place of resi­dence" of people in the U.S., he said. 
Keane also emphasized that the questionnaire is "absolutely confidential. Neither President Bush, the HUD, nor anyone else can get your questionnaire."

Kohl asks Poles to admit to injustice to Germans after war 
CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) ­West German Chancellor Hel­mut Kohl asked Poland on Thursday to acknowledge that it inflicted "an injustice" on in­nocent Germans who came un­der Polish rule after World War 
II. 
"We Germans are not entitled to such words, and even less must we try to balance ac­counts in one way or another," Kohl said at a dinner with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
The occasion in this English university town marked the 40th anniversary of the Koenigswinter Conference, set up to foster Anglo-German re­lations five years after the Al­lied defeat of Nazi Germany. 
Kohl recalled that one of Va­dav Havel's first acts as presi­dent of Czechoslovakia was to express his country's remorse at the expulsion and persecu­tion of its German population after the war. He suggested Poland could follow Havel's ex­ample. 
Thatcher declared in her own speech that German unification should not weaken security and said that U.S. and British troops and NATO nuclear mis­siles must remain in a united Germany. 
She also unveiled a plan to turn a 35-nation East-West summit this year into a newly enlarged alliance of democra­cies across Europe. 
In the aftermath of World War II, about 13 million Ger­mans were expelled from pre­war German territories that now are part of Poland and Czechoslovakia. 
Germany also became divided into Communist East and capi­talist West Germany, but with the reforms that swept Eastern Europe last fall also came the present drive toward German unification. 
Kohl said Thursday that he had "time and again ... recalled the untold suffering inflicted on the Polish people by Germans" during the Nazi occupation or Poland. 
But, departing from his pre­pared text, Kohl toned down his remarks to refrain from di­rectly accusing Poland of mistreating Germans. 
The prepared text said:

"It would no doubt be benefi­cial for the relationship be­tween our two people if Poland were to refer with equally clear and noble words, as President Vaclav Havel did for Czechoslo­vakia, to the injustice commit­ted by Poles against innocent Germans." 
When he spoke, Kohl noted that Havel had mentioned "the injustice that was also inflicted on innocent Germans." and said "it would be good" if such words "were also possible now between German and Polish people." 
He said "such a word, such a gesture, would point the way to a future in which the relation­ship between the Polish and German peoples is marked by a spirit of good-neighborliness in a common Europe." 
One-third of Poland was German territory before the war, and Kohl indicated he was not making a Polish apology a condition of honoring his pledge to respect Poland's bor­ders. 
Kohl said a united Germany will enshrine Polish borders in "an internationally binding treaty" with Poland after Ger­man unification. 
He finally made a forthright pledge last month about Poland's borders after months in which his position on the is­sue appeared equivocal. upset Poland and worried officials in other European countries, par­ticularly Britain. 
Kohl said the West German government and the new demo­cratically elected East German government should both quickly issue identical declarations reaffirming the inviolability of the Polish borders. 
"This declaration should unequivocally express the idea that immediately after unifica­tion of the two German states the all-German government and 
Parliament will definitively set­tle the border question along these lines in an internationally binding treaty with the Republic of Poland," he said. 
Days before Kohl's arrival in London, the Polish issue became a source of friction when the Hamburg magazine Der Spiegel said Thatcher claimed Kohl 
was  still  saying  he  did  not  
recognize  Poland's  western  
border.  

A Kohl spokesman denied it, saying the prime minister mis­interpreted Kohl's comments. A Thatcher spokesman would say only that Der Spiegel accurately reported the interview with her. 
Thatcher suggested Thursday that the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) should stipulate conditions for free elections, hold formal meetings of foreign ministers twice yearly and call emergency sessions in times of crisis. The summit is expected to take place this fall. 

Former prime minister of Cuba cal.ls for constitution to guarantee human nghts 
By COLLEEN GANNON 
News Writer 

Although he does not advo­cate entirely duplicating the constitution, the Constitution of 1940 should be the basis for any code established in Cuba after Castro. said Rogelio de Ia Torre, former chief counsel to the Cuban Prime Minister's Of­fice under Fidel Castro. 
The Constitution of 1940 guaranteed human rights and the dignity of human beings, Torre said yesterday in a lec­ture titled, "The Cuban Consti­tutional Ideal." For example, it included freedom of expres­sion, protection from child ex­ploitation, and prohibition of property confiscation. 
A problem Torre found in the Constitution was its inability to limit the power of the president while making the system actu­ally work. The government of­ficials enforcing the text proved to be more problematit than this deficiency according to Torre. 
"Failing Cuba was the human element, not the text, "he said. 
Torre traced Cuban constitu­tional history to make his basic point that Cubans' desire for a Constitution is not something new. 
"Cubans had a long standin2 love affair with the Constitu­tion,"said Torre. 
Father Felix Varela served as a key figure in the country's ongoing desire for a successful Constitution, Torre said. 
"Varela created and devel­oped the ideas of freedom and independence in the Cuban peo­ple," he said. Varela wrote the first Constitutional Law text­book published in Latin Amer­ica. 
The Platt Amendment to the 1901 Constitution was also dis­cussed by Torre. The amend­ment basically gave the United States power to intervene in

Registration still has flaws, despite DART 

It's spring. Almost. Bookstore Basketball is starting, snow has (hopefully) left the forecast, and DART has once again in­vaded our lives. 
I shouldn't complain 

about DART though. Colleen Cronin 

It actually is a good system. No more Accent Editor 
waiting for hours in checkmarking lines, no more of that pre­registration annoyance, and everyone has an equal chance of getting the classes they want. 
Or at least that's how it is supposed to be. 
I am going to be a senior. By now I should be able to get into most of the classes I want. I have gone through three years of al­ternatives, and that is to be expected. But I am almost a senior, have worked (relatively) hard to get to there, and so should be rewarded by finally getting some of my first choices. 
For three semesters I have been trying to get into one of the Fiction Writing courses. I am a concentrating in journalism and this would be of great benefit to me. But no dice. I inquired about the status of the course in the middle of the first DART day and all three sections were closed already. I didn't think that was statistically possible. 
It seems that English majors, and anyone who may have heard through the English grapevine, were able to pre-register for this course (and a few others) at 8 a.m. Monday morning. 
Why? Why didn't anyone else know about this, like American Studies majors who have many English courses open to them for credit towards their major? 
Doesn't this sound like checkmarking, something that DART was supposed to eliminate? Doesn't this sound like a shady deal on behalf of the English department, like some top-secret information that goes out to only English majors and a few other privileged people? 
"English majors should have preference over other majors." That is a valid reason, but if it is a course open for credit to Amer­ican Studies majors, can't the classes be di­vided evenly between the two majors? Or maybe those who were closed out in one semester can have first crack at it for the next semester. There are many viable alter­natives to secret pre-registration at dawn. 
In talking to other students, it is obvious that other departments are at fault for the exact same thing. I can see no reason for there to be this unfairness to the students. Either all departments should go through he registration system in the same manner or trash the whole thing and regress to the checkmarking hell of two years ago. 
Nothing, unfortunately, can be done about this now for the upcoming fall semester. I must stick to my alternative schedule once again. All I can do is cross my fingers and hope that in my very last semester of my college career I can get some of my first­choice classes.

JERUSALEM (AP) -Workers hooked up telexes and cleared away debris in the Palestine Press Service on Thursday after police lifted a two-year closure of the agency that once served as the main source of news on the Palestinian uprising. 
The reopening of the Arab­run service was one of the first casings of the tough restric­tions that Israel imposed on Palestinian journalists at the height of the uprising. 
Yossi Olmert, head of Israel's Government Press Office, said there was decreased interna­tional interest in the 27 -month revolt, so authorities adopted a more liberal attitude. 
"The uprising is declining, and some of the pressure is off," Olmert told The Associ­ated Press. "We can live with the press and the uprising at the same time." 
Arab newspapers still must submit all articles to the Israeli military censor. The army also continues to block foreign journalists from entering trou­ble spots by declaring them closed military areas. 
Two weeks ago, the army gave a hint of easing restric­tions when its spokesman's of­fice issued a directive ordering its employees to respond to queries by Arab journalists. 
Such a practice was unthink-
Albums will be labeled 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -Six major record companies plan to create an album labeling sys­tem so retailers and purchasers can identify explicit recordings. 
The label-reading "Parental

industry is buckling to pressure 
groups complaining about sex­
ual and violent songs, officials 
said at a recent convention here 
of the National Association of

Trish Heimers, vice president of 
the Recording Industry Associ­
ation of America. 
More than a dozen states are 
considering record censorship 
bills, said executives at the 
NARIM meeting. 
The labeling decision may not 
solve the controversy, some re­
tailers said, adding they were 
fearful that legislation won't be 
derailed.

able early in the uprising, when Palestinian journalists often put the spokesman's office on the. defensive with up-to-the­minute reports of troops firing on Palestinian stone-throwers. 
At the time, the Palestine Press Service was the main liai­son between Palestinians and the foreign press. It distributed information from a network of dozens of stringers, accompa­nying foreign journalists to trouble spots and providing translation services. 
"In the beginning of the uprising, hundreds of iournal­ists would come here. We were the main source of informa­tion," said the agency's co­owner, Ibrahim Karaeen, speaking in his office in Israeli­annexed Arab east Jerusalem. 
On March 30, 1988, four months into the uprising, police ordered the agency closed. Karaeen said army officials told him the office was shut be­cause of suspicions it was funded by Yasser Arafat's PLO. 
For the next two years, the four-room office stood vacant, its door sealed by a police lock. Pigeons sneaked through an open window, leaving behind piles of droppings and three nests of eggs on a table in Karaeen's corner office. 
Karaeen said he was given no explanation why the ban was lifted. 

in the country. According to Torre, "we were all the time complaining about the Platt Amendment." In 1933, this amendment was eliminated. 
When Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, work on a new constitution began. Although based on its 1940 predecessor, the new constitution eliminated the word "God" from the preamble. Cubans complained a lot about this, and Torre said it caused the first suspicion that something was not going very well with Castro. 
Eventually, Castro drafted an entirely different socialist con­stitution. 
"They now control the life of Cuban people to the most minute detail,"said Torre, "To me, there is no legality to any­thing they are doing." 
The newly formed Cuban American Union of Student Ad­vocates (C.A.U.S.A.) sponsored the lecture. Currently, Torre is the assistant chairman of the School of Arts and Sciences at Indiana University at South Bend. C.A.U.S.A. formed this year after some Notre Dame Law students realized there were a number of Cuban Amer­icans in the Notre Dame com­munity.

Senate refuses aid to coal miners despite long debate 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Senate by a razor-thin margin turned back pleas for special aid to coal miners Thursday, rejecting a measure Senate leaders and the White House said could have jeopardized broader clean air legislation. 
The $500 million assistance amendment was voted down 50 to 49 after five hours of debate during which supporters ar­gued the miners needed help because they would be adversely affected by tougher air pollution controls. 
The measure was seen as the biggest remaining obstacle to passage of major air pollution control legislation that is scheduled for a final vote next Tuesday. A similar bill is pend­ing in a House committee. 
The government has esti­mated more than 5,000 miners of high-sulfur coal are likely to Jose their jobs as Midwest utili­ties switch to other fuels to meet new pollution re uin~­

Child-care bill rejected 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The House rejected the White House's version of major child-care legislation Thurs­day in a vote that cleared the way for a more ambitious Democratic plan. 
The House defeated the conservative alternative on child care on a largely party line vote, 225-195, before turning to the competing and more expensive plan to help families find and afford day care. 
The vote came despite a re­newed threat of a veto from presidential spokesman

Marlin Fitzwater. The House first turned back amend­ments aimed at limiting fed­eral aid for church-run day care centers. 
The vote followed eight hours of sometimes emo­tional debate that masked the fact that there was actu· ally bipartisan agreement on major portions of the com­peting versions. 
"What we're talking about here may be the most impor­tant issue we're going to deal with this year." said Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. 
ments in the coming years. 
The narrow vote was a vic­tory for Senate leaders of both parties -George Mitchell, D­Maine, and Bob Dole, R-Kan. ­as well as the Bush administra­tion which had opposed the as­sistance proposal as too expen­sive and discriminatory against other workers. 
The White House had threat­ened to withdraw support from any bill that exceeded the cur­rent estimated $21 billion-a­year cost, and Mitchell said the amendment pressed by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., prob­ably would have pushed the to­tal beyond that level. 
The vote came after days of intense lobbying from both sides, including last minute telephone calls from the White House to key senators -some calls coming even as the vote was under way. Byrd, whose power as chairman of the Ap­propriations Committee is widely respected, had visited dozens of senators in search of support. 
He got the votes of 38 of the Senate's 55 Democrats and 11 of its 45 Republicans. 
Byrd said later that under in­tense White House pressure "three of my votes took wings." Among those voting with Byrd was Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D­Hawaii, who suffers from cancer and was brought into the chamber in a wheelchair. 
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said he voted against the pro­posal in the last minutes after a telephone call from White House Chief of Staff John Su­nunu, who told him President Bush would veto the clean air bill if the assistance proposal were included. 
Senate leaders also had feared that if the measure were approved other senators would seek similar financial aid for workers in other industries. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Tex., promised to do just that. 

Amnesty for Lithuanian deserters who return is possible step toward compromise 
VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) ­The Soviet army offered amnesty Thursday to Lithua­nian deserters who return to their units in what appeared to be a first step toward compro­mise in the crisis over Lithua­nia's independence drive. 
The decision announced by the Defense Ministry General Staff came a day after Lithua­nia offered two compromises: it suspended a plan to institute its own border guard, and it told citizens not to resist Soviet at­tempts to seize their firearms. 
Both sides seemed to be yielding in the war of wills over Lithuania's March 11 declara­tion of independence, the strongest defiance of Mikhail Gorbachev in his five years as Soviet leader. 
"I think Lithuania is seeking a way out, and I think Gor­bachev is seeking a way out," said Algirdas Brazauskas, head of the Lithuanian Communist Party, which split with Moscow in December. 
But the war of words did not die down entirely. 
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, asked about the Defense Ministry's offer, said: "I don't have much trust in this promise. There have been instances where very high

"This amendment discrimi­nates against all workers who are not coal miners," declared Mitchell minutes before the vote. 
Mitchell and other senators said thousands of workers in other fields, including the steel and petrochemical industries, also could suffer job losses and would not have such benefits. 
Byrd, who has been a staunch advocate for miners for years, argued that the issue was a matter of "fairness .. . and jus­tice" because of the severe im­pact that new acid rain controls would have on Midwest utilities and, in turn, on miners in high­sulfur coal fields. 
The main clean air bill, which is scheduled for a vote in the Senate next week, calls for sweeping pollution controls on industry, automobiles and util­ity plants.

military officials have lied." 
Lithuanian leaders are angry that the military said nothing before arresting 23 deserters Tuesday. They said the military had agreed to discuss any such move in advance. 
Defense Ministry officials told Tass that Lithuanians who left the Soviet armed forces when their republic declared inde­pendence would not be punished if they resumed their military service. 
However, those who continue to hide will be "searched out, detained and be subject to criminal punishment in accor­dance with current law," they said. 
Red Army soldiers on Tuesday stormed two psychiatric hospitals in Lithuania to ap­prehend deserters. Witnesses said some of the deserters and a policeman who tried to stop the detentions were beaten. 
The Lithuanian prosecutor's office said Thursday it had opened a criminal investigation into the beating of the police officer. The republic's Interior Ministry said the policeman sustained a concussion. 
Lt. Gen. Frants Markovsky of the military General Staff told Tass a special military commis­sion had been set up to track

ide emissions from Midwest electric power plants -an ef­fort to combat acid rain -are expected to cause utilities to shift away from high-sulfur coal to cleaner fuels, causing mines in Appalachia and the Midwest to close and miners to lose their jobs. 
Calling on senators to "hear the cries of people" and re­spond to them, Byrd said help for the miners is no different that the federal assistance given to victims of a hurricane or earthquake, who suffer be­cause of no fault of their own. 
"We're not asking for wel­fare," he declared. 
For nearly two weeks, Byrd, a former Senate majority leader who still wields considerable power as chairman of the Sen­ate Appropriations Committee, has cajoled, pressured and pleaded with senators to line up in support of his proposal. 
down deserters. 
Soviet officers visited the families of 97 soldiers who de­serted, and in 40 cases were told the soldiers would return, Markovsky told Tass. In 42 other cases, parents said they were willing to help the military but did not know where their sons were, Markovsky said. 
"No reasoning and appeals for common sense and for parental wisdom, however, worked with the parents of the other 15 deserters," he said. 
Markovsky said 51 soldiers already had returned to their units. 
Soviet officials estimate 250 Lithuanian soldiers have de­serted. Lithuanian figures put the number at about 900. 
Wednesday was the deadline for Lithuanians to comply with Gorbachev's order issued last week to turn in their firearms or have them seized. 
Deputy Interior Minister Va­clavas Zabarauskas said Thursday that only 1,500 of the 30,000 registered guns had been turned in. Local officials have said they will not cooper­ate with Moscow to collect them.

Idaho governor expresses doubt about prudence of supporting state abortion law 
BOISE, Idaho (API-Gov. Ce­cil Andrus on Thursday ex­pressed his first public doubts about signing what would be the nation's most restrictive state abortion law. 
"I am concerned that this bill may narrow it to the point where a woman who has suf­fered rape, who has suffered incest or the mother's life is in danger might not be able to re­ceive an abortion," Andrus said at an impromptu news confer­ence. 
''I'm looking at that," he said. ''I'm agonizing over it." 
But the Democratic governor quickly cautioned against in­terpreting his remarks to mean he has decided to veto the bill. 
"Don't read anything into it," Andrus said. "My views being pro-life haven't changed.... But I am concerned about the bill." 
Pro-choice forces, meanwhile, staged another rally on the Capitol steps, dumping 10,000 potatoes in a show of support

for the campaign to launch a national boycott of Idaho's biggest cash crop should the bill become law. 
To counter that threat sym­bolic-ally Thursday, Wisconsin Right to Life Inc. delivered a half ton of potatoes to the Sal­vation Army office in Milwau­kee. And a group called Con­cerned Women for America, which claims 600,000 members, said it will increase potato pur­chases to offset any boycott by the National Organization for Women. 
"This is a long-term com­mitment," said Beverly LaHaye, president of Concerned Women. "Our membership ... is commit­ted to this cause out of respect for the courageous men and women in the Idaho Legisla­ture." 
A day earlier, the governor said business leaders in key Idaho industries told him they were already losing sales be­cause of the evolving boycott. 

But while expressing concern, he said economic considera­tions would not be the crucial factor in his decision. 
Later in the day, a major buyer of Idaho potatoes, Mc­Donald's Corp., said it had no plans to participate in any boy­cott over the abortion contro­versy. 
Andrus promised earlier in the week he would act by Sat­urday on the legislation that would ban abortion as a method of birth control. Both sides in the debate agree it would make more than 90 per­cent of the abortions performed in Idaho illegal. If signed, it would take effect Julv 1. 
The bill makes abortion ille­gal except in cases of non­statutory rape reported within 
seven days, incest if the victim is under age 18, severe fetal de­
formity or a threat to 
mother's life or physical health.

Attempt to smuggle nuclear devices into Iraq discovered 
LONDON (AP) -Customs of­ficials said Wednesday they foiled an attPmpt to supply Iraq with 40 American-made devices for triggering nuclear weapons, and they arrested five people after an 18-month investigation by U.S. and British authorities. 
The probe climaxed in a freight shed at London's Heathrow Airport as an at­tempt was made to put the de­vices -which may have been dummies -aboard an Iraqi Airways flight to Baghdad, British customs officials said. 
Of those arrested in and around London, one was an Iraqi national who was imme­diately served with a deporta­tion order. authorities said. Iraqi diplomats in London re­fused to comment on the affair. 
In Washington, the U.S. Cus­toms Service said sealed in­dictments had been returned at a U.S. District Court in San Diego. 
Customs officials in London, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the devices were capacitors, electrical components of the detonation chain of a nuclear bomb. 
Defense experts said it demonstrated Iraq's determi­nation to become a nuclear power, even at the risk of being caught violating Western bans on the export of strategic high technology. 
"There are only a very few countries in the world capable of manufacturing this type of technology, and there is no other use for a nuclear trigger­ing device than to trigger a nu­clear weapon," said Tony 
Banks, a Middle East expert at described as a secret Iraqi nu-

White House spokesman Mar­lin Fitzwater said: "This issue raises once again our concern for the nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. It continues to pose a serious risk to U.S. in­terests, and it continues to ex­acerbate regional problems." 
There were indications the devices deposited at Heathrow were dummies. substituted· for the real hardware as part of the U.S. Customs investigation. 
British Broadcasting Corp. TV said customs officers made the switch after the packages arrived from the United States this week. Channel 4 TV News carried an interview with the manufacturer of the so-called Krytrons, who said his com­pany turned over dummies to 
U.S. Customs late last year. 
"We provided about 40 de­vices ... to the Customs Service and they were deliberately made to be inoperative," said Don Kerr, president of EG & G in Wellesley, Mass. 
He indicated he did not know whether these were the devices that reached London. 
The Iraqi, arrested along with three Britons and a Le­banese, was ordered deported because of "attempted breaches of legislation govern­ing the export of strategic goods from the United King­dom," the Home Office said. 
BBC-TV showed footage of the operation which it said was shot by an NBC crew that was in on the investigation. 
NBC reported that Scotland Yard detectives raided the headquarters "of what is being

It quoted authorities as say­ing that "the man at the top of the Iraqi operations is Ali Daghir, who was sent to Lon­don from Baghdad almost two years ago."

New Romanian regime accused of similarity to rule of Ceausescu 
GENEVA (AP) -The Rev. Laszlo Toekes, an ethnic Hun­garian whose resistance ignited Romania's December revolu­tion, accused the new regime Thursday of abuses reminiscent of ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
Toekes, 37, an outspoken Ceausescu critic, has been elected bishop in the Reformed Church. An announcement Thursday by state Bucharest radio said he will serve in the northwestern city of Oradea, near the Hungarian border. 
In comments Thursday in Geneva. Toekes said extreme nationalist Romanian groups were to blame for deadly clashes between ethnic Hungar­ians and Romanians last week in Tirgu Mures, a Transylvania city about 250 miles northwest of Bucharest. 
Toekes, who was traveling in the United States during the ethnic unrest, accused the in­terim Romanian government of failing to intervene and of spreading "false information" that ethnic Hungarians ro­voked the clashes. 
He questioned the value of a proposed official inquiry, say­ing authorities blamed the Hungarian population from the outset. 
Many Romanians believe eth­nic Hungarians in Transylvania want to secede and join Hun­gary. The ethnic Hungarians say they only want more cul­tural autonomy. Last week's unrest in Tirgu Mures report­edly killed six people and left 300 injured. 
In a statement distributed to a meeting at the Geneva-based World Council of Churches, Toekes said "misinformation" from the interim government and the Romanian media "reminds one of the practices of the Ceausescu-era." 
"Ceausescu argued in the same way, in keeping with his long-standing policy of dividing the nationalities and playing ... the Hungarian minority, as if the 'Jews' of the country, against the Romanian nation," he said. 
Ceaucescu was executed dur­

Idon't know where I'll be in five years. But if I'm in the business world, Iknow I'll have my Apple® Macintosh® computer with me. I've seen people in business change their attitudes about computers the minute they get their hands on a Macintosh. They get this look on their faces like, 
ing the revolution, which broke out in the western city of Timisoara when demonstrators tried to evict Toekes from his church. 
Toekes had run afoul of au­thorities by championing Hun­garian rights. After the out­break of the revolution, Ceaus­escu loyalists tried to assassi­nate Toekes, but he escaped without injury. 
In his statement Thursday, he said allegations that ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania want unification with neighbor­ing Hungary are unfounded and intended to incite hatred. 
"What happened in Tirgu Mures was something like a pogrom; its perpetrators came exclusively from among Roma­nians stirred up in the spirit of Ceausescuism...." he said. . 
At a press conference in Thursday in Geneva, Toekes said former Reform Church leaders had collaborated with Ceausescu and his hated secret police. 


"Now Iget it. That's what computers are for." 
Ithink that's what attracted me to a Macintosh in the first place. It lets you take control. You start out working the way you want to work. And it just keeps getting better.

Deadliest Navy missile deployed 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Navy's newest and deadliest missile -the Trident 2 -has passed all its tests and has been deployed aboard the sub­marine USS Tennessee, the Navy said Thursday. 
The Trident 2 is considered by experts to be the nation's most accurate ballistic missile. 
"This marks the start of an era," said Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley. "This mis­sile will serve as one-third of the nation's strategic triad for many years to come." 
The program encountered problems last year after two of the first three submarine-launched missiles self-destruc­ted. The program was declared on track in January after a $125 million fix of the missile's nozzle system. 
The program, which has cost $35 billion to date, "was deliv­ered two years early and was 12 percent below the budget originally provided," the Navy boasted. 
On Thursday, the program formally achieved what is called the Initial Operational Capability. That marks the end of its land-based and subma­rine-based flight tests, as well as all readiness checks for mis­siles, crew and equipment aboard the Tennessee, the statement said. 
That means, said Navy spokesman Cmdr. Craig Quigley, "that it is declared ready for use." 
Quigley declined to confirm whether the Tennessee had put to sea for its first operational patrol from its base at King's Bay, Ga. A military source, however, confirmed that the submarine had done so early Thursday. 
"It went out around 7:30 a.m.," said the source, who spoke on the condition he not be named.

Greyhound and union will return to bargaining table 
DALLAS (AP) -Four weeks 
into a violent strike by its bus 
drivers, Greyhound Lines Inc. 
says it is losing hundreds of 
thousands of dollars a day but 
considers the walkout effec­
tively finished in much of the 
country. 
Nevertheless, the company 
and union agreed Thursday to 
return to the bargaining table 
next week, said Bernard 
DeLury, head of the Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Ser­
vice. 
The agency did not say why 
talks were resuming, and com­
pany and union officials were 
not immediately available. 
Greyhound said it plans an expansion Sunday that will put it at 54.1 percent of its total pre-strike miles, adding 112 round trips that will increase service to some cities and add 50 destinations. 
But President Frank Schmieder also says Greyhound has no near-term plans to add some 205,000 unprofitable miles that constitute about 32 percent of the total Greyhound system. 
The decision could leave nu­merous areas without any in­tercity bus transportation, although Greyhound spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale said Thursday the company would attempt to subcontract some of the routes. 
"In no way are we abandon­ing that 32 percent forever," she said. 
Greyhound is the only nation­wide bus company, serving about 9,500 pre-strike destina­tions. In about 9,000 of those areas, the company provides the only intercity transporta­
tion. 
The strike began March 2 when Greyhound and the Amal­gamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions failed to reach agreement on a new, three-year contract. Negotiations resumed briefly, but broke off amid company complaints the union was doing little to discourage violence against its buses. 
There have been more than 
200 incidents of violence, the 
company says, including 25 
shootings, 69 bomb threats and 
more than 100 less serious at­
tacks. 
The union has said it opposes 
the violence and has called for 
prosecution of law breakers. 
Schmieder said Greyhound would like to end the "open warfare" with the union, but contended "we're beginning to have plenty of drivers. ... In certain areas, yes, it's over." 
"Essentially through the Southeast and Southwest, I think it's over," Schmieder said in an interview Wednesday. "Chicago, Minneapolis, it's over," although "it's still tight" in the Northeast and West, he said. 
Greyhound says ridership has increased steadily, although the 
1.3 million riders it has had since the strike began is only 
34.6 percent of the amount for the same period last year. 
"If the company were being as successful as it's claimed to be, I think you would have seen some kind of rush back to work," said union spokesman Jeff Nelson.

Dear Editor: 
I am writing to express my outrage at gubernatorial nomi­nee Clayton Williams for his remark comparing bad weather to rape. As quoted in The Observer (March 26), he said, "If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it." For raising this issue, some may label me yet another angry feminist (perhaps not enough estrogen in my system today!); for others, this is just another letter complaining about the intolerable attitude towards rape in our society. 
Well, it is another letter about that attitude -because the attitude still exists, and Williams' comment is proof of that fact. That he could even jokingly suggest that a woman: 
1) should accept rape, that it is an inevitable reality, that it is not something to be fought against; and 2) that somehow the violent abuse and forced domination of a woman's body and mind should be looked at as a pleasure, something for a woman to enjoy, Williams, by getting away with expressing these thoughts, demonstrates the existence and toleration of such attitudes. What I find even more horrifying is the fact that Williams, by his chosen candidacy, believes he best represents the values of the 
DOONESBURY 
people of Texas! 
Is it not enough that 284 rapes occurred and were re­ported in South Bend alone last year, and that it is estimated nine times that many went un­reported? How many women are we willing to continue suf­fering? How many of our friends do we thin_¥ should have to bear this pain? Is not one victim too many? 
Granted, there are many problems in this world, and we all wonder just which ones and how many we are called to ad­dress, but we do have an obli­gation to address at least a 
few. In this particular case, my personal convictions and my personal conscience would not let me remain silent The insen­sitivity of Williams' remark is something, I believe, that has to be more fully understood. It is a time to call attention to an injustice -the toleration and encouragement of rape -in the hopes that we, who have the power to make a difference, will bring an end to this de­structive attitude of condoning violent crimes against human­ity, by silence or by verh:tl agreement.

Dear Editor: 
Tomorrow, March 31, is our last official day as student body president and vice-president. It has been a truly rewarding ex­perience, and we feel it is only appropriate to recognize all of those who have helped make this year a success. We would like to thank everyone in our cabinet for their dedication to the goals that we outlined at the beginning of the year. When we were first elected, we stressed the importance of im­proving student services and promoting intellectual life on campus. Our cabinet helped us to realize these goals, with events such as the successful Iceberg Debates, ND Safewalk, the Parents' Weekend dessert buffet and the World Awareness Series. We all worked really well as a team this year. Furthermore, there has been a great working rela­tionship with the other depart­ments within student govern­ment, such as Student Union Board, the classes and the Hall Presidents' Council. The fact that we have been able to work so well together has helped us

all be more effective leaders. 
Student government has also enjoyed a strong relationship with The Observer and Scholastic this year. In the past, this has not always been the case, but we do recognize this relationship has con­tributed to our success this year. These publications have made ardent efforts to cover student government events and issues throughout the year. This has helped increase awareness as to what student government actually does and what it can accomplish. We thank these publications for their support. 
We have also developed a good working relationship with the administration. The Office of Student Activities has been very helpful this year. Furthermore, we have worked well with the Office of Student Affairs. For example, with re­gards to the matching funds is­
~sue, Father Tyson was willing to sit down and reevaluate the situation, taking into consider­ation student input. This shows that the efforts of stu­dent leadership are recogniZf~rl. 
Finally, we would like to ex­press our pleasure in serving as student body president and vice-president this year. It has been an invaluable experience, one we will remember for a long time. We have learned a little more about ourselves and about others. Thank you for the opportunity to serve you and make a difference at Notre Dame.

Profanity was not used in discussion 
Dear Editor: 
In his article, "Spike Lee accurately depicts life in New York inner cities" (The Observer, March 21), Mr. Russell Jones misquoted me. I asked the Director of Minority Student Affairs, "What have you been smoking?" There was no profanity at all (as I was quoted in The Observer).

O'Connor fans get record they want 
COLLEEN CRONIN 
accent editor 
I 
Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, the new 
album by Sinead 
O'Connor, is a record 
brimming with emotion. It does not boast many dance songs--only one actually-but does boast her singing talents, and her songwriting talents as well. 
Her debut album last year, The Lion and the Cobra, was a fast-paced danceable release that reflected the passion and desire of the 20-year-old singer. This second album is the result of those same emotions. 
O'Connor wrote or co-wrote all but one of the songs, so the album became largely autobio­graphical. Though only 21 now, O'Connor proves she has expe­rienced a lifetime of emotions. Her songs range from preg­nancy to discrimination, and all have more substance and con­creteness than those from her debut album. 
O'Connor plays the acoustic guitar on most of the songs and contributes keyboards, electric guitar and percussion on many of the others. 
One of the more catchy songs on the album is "I Am Stretched on Your Grave." The music has a heavy bass pulse and sounds almost tribal. When paired with O'Connor's distinct voice, the song that comes together is completely different from any­thing else I have heard. O'Connor reveals she was very affected by a ruined relation­ship: "I still love you my love and you're dead/ and with you in your cold grave I cannot sleep warm." 
"You Cause as Much Sorrow" 
better portrays her frustration 
and anger. "Why must you al­
ways be around?/ Why can't 
you just leave it be?/ It's done 
nothing so far but destroy my 
life." This is one of the most 
emotional songs on the 
album-you can practically feel 
what she feels. 
O'Connor attacks England and racial discrimination in "Black Boys on Mopeds." This in one of two songs not about love, or the lack thereof, but it is not at all out of place. It has a great deal of emotion and awareness driving it, and she manages to make a definitive political statement: "Margaret Thatcher on TV/ shocked by the deaths that took place in Beijing/ it seems strange that she should be offended/ the same orders are given by her." 
The one track that has made it to the radio airwaves is "Nothing Can Compare 2 U," written by Prince. I would like to think it is being played be­cause it is the song that best shows off her incredible voice, but I am more inclined to think it is due to the Prince factor. 
The album ends with an a cappella rendition of the title song. It is almost prayer-like: "I have water for my journey/ I have bread and I have wine/ No longer will I be hungry/ For the bread of life is mine." 
Though it may take a few lis­tenings to get used to, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got is well worth the time. O'Connor has grown up within the past year, and has used that experience to fuel this album, which is masterful from any aspect. 
Farley's production, directed by Robin Maher, combines some stunningly good singing with simple but effective chore­ography. 
"Godspell's" only major flaw is the soft-spokenness of sev­eral cast members, who don't use microphones. At times, especially in dialogue and occa­sionally in the songs. the voices are difficult to hear. 
Overall, however, "Godspell" is well-acted and a load of fun to see. Acting out Jesus' para­bles. the cast draws laughs by harmonizing like a '50s group, rapping about the man who didn't forgive his debtor and playing a comical game of cha­rades to show how to treat others. 
Some of the show's best singing occurs in "Turn Back, 0 Man." a cabaret-style number about repentance, and "All for the Best," a soft-shoe routine with straw hats and canes. 
Other memorable songs include "Day by Day" and "Learn Your Lessons Well." 
Despite the happy, casual mood through most of the show, Farley Hall Players' treatment of Christ's passion and death is reverential and deeply moving. 
The apostles chant the sor­rowful song "Long Live God" as they carry Jesus from the cross and off the stage. When he re­turns, alive, the same words signal their joy. 
The cast of Diana Barnes, Margaret Haugh, Joshua Henderson, Theodore Leo, Chris Norborg, Aimee Pernicano, Mary Pozar, Matt Roscoe, Timmy Sullivan and Laura Williams earns applause for an energetic, entertaining performance. 
"Godspell" is playing at Washington Hall tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m. Don't miss it.

"Basically, they are the same team that beat us last year 5­4," said Assistant Coach Brian Kalbas. "They are really ex­cited because this is the first time we have played down there. Miami is a talented group of players. It is impor­tant for us to take each match one at a time. Also, it is critical for us to get off to a fast start and establish dominance in a hostile environment." 
Yes, the Miami contest is critical, but the match in the back of Notre Dame tennis team's mind is the Wisconsin battle. In what could well de­cide the Midwestern NCAA tournament representative, the Irish will face a very solid, deep Badger team that owns a six­year winning streak against Notre Dame dating back to the 1983 season. 
The 12-5 Badgers possess the credentials and the talent to dash the hopes of the 18-3 Irish. To date, Wisconsin has notched victories against Kansas, Minnesota and No. 5 Cal-Irvine. 
"Wisconsin is a very deep squad with three excellent dou­bles teams," explained Kalbas. "In singles, they are solid one through six. Their number three doubles team is ranked nationally and that tells how deep they are. It is important for us to concentrate on each individual match and if we do that we will be in good shape." 
This weekend could acceler­ate the fortune of the Notre Dame tennis program that un­questionably did not expect to be in this position so soon in a rebuilding year. It could also squash the hopes of young, aspiring team. the Irish won't be the only ones interested in the outcome of the weekend ac­tion; the NCAA selection committee will keep a close eye on the Midwest. 
"We are in competition with three or four teams, including Wisconsin, for the Midwest re­gional bid," said Kalbas. "This weekend is extremely important as far as the NCAA goes. The Wisconsin match is one more step that we have to take. Our win against Indiana was the first key, and the match against Wisconsin is the second key. In order to go, we have to beat Wisconsin." 

DENVER (AP) -First is the look, the ~ounddog eyes, the hands-behmd-the-neck slouch on the bench.

j 
Tark th_e Shar~.
1 \ l N~xt IS the City_. where books don t necessanly relate to ~lasses and !he Stri~ has noth­mg to do w1th steahng a bas­ketball. And finally is the philosophy that the rules are ridiculous, an
'l outlook embodied by the quip
l' -maybe only half in jest ­
\' that it's better to accept trans­fer players because their cars are already pa~d for. Could anythmg be more ap­propriate than Jerry Tarkanian coaching a team nicknamed the Rebels? 
Lest there be any doubt, though, that the 59-year-old Tarkanian is a real, live bas­ketball coach, not just a Las Vegas act, look at the record: 
Wins 563, Losses 119 in 22 seasons, an 83 percent winning percentage, tops among active coaches. At UNLV alone, it's 44 7-102 over 17 seasons. 
Still, something is missing: an NCAA championship. Tark's Runnin' Rebels have made it to the Final Four twice, but never as far as the final game, a fail­ing that even the usually pes­
Tark looks to capture elusive title 
simistic Tarkanian is hopeful of correcting this time. 
UNLV is a 7-5 favorite to win it all, starting with Saturday's semifinal against Georgia Tech and then in Monday night's championship game against the Arkansas-Duke winner. 
"If we play well, we can beat any team in the country," Tarkanian says. 
If they do, though, Tarkanian insists it will only be sweet vic­tory, not sweet revenge for his long-running fight with the NCAA. 
"This has nothing to do with vindication," he says. ''I'm not even thinking about that." 
Only a day before the Rebels arrived in Denver, Tarkanian signed an agreement bringing to an end the NCAA's 13-year effort to suspend him from coaching an effort Tarkanian claims was part of a vendetta by NCAA officials to run him out of college basket­ball that began in the early 1970s. 
For all his success, Tarkanian is still viewed by many as an outlaw coach, a renegade who takes inner-city players unfit for college and casts them off when their use­fulness expires. 
And controversy seems to

follow the doleful coach, even in a year when his team began the season ranked No. 1 and won 33 of 38 games to reach the Final Four. 
Tark swears it's all unde­served. 
"This group has overcome more adversity than any I've had. and kept winning," he says. "There were other teams in the country who would have packed it in." 
It's quite a litany, to be sure. 
David Butler and Moses Scurry were suspended the first six games of the season for academic reasons, Scurry after flunking physical education. 
Anderson Hunt was sus­pended one game for falling two months behind on student loan payments. 
Eight other players were sus­pended one game for failing to repay incidental hotel charges run up on road trips during the 1988-89 season. 
On top of all that came a brawl after a game with Utah State in which Scurry punched Utah State Coach Kohn Smith. Scurry was suspended for one game, reserve forward Chris Jeter for three games for trig­gering the melee by throwing an elbow that cut an opposing player in the closing seconds.

Greg Anthony, the UNLV guard who proved his toughness earlier this season by playing with a broken jaw and a sore nose, will lead the Rebels against Georgia Tech Saturday. 
Oliver's injury slows Tech's Lethal Weapon 
DENVER (AP) -Bobby Cremins says Lethal Weapon 3 is more like Lethal Weapon 2.7. 
Georgia Tech's high-caliber offensive trio -Dennis Scott, Kenny Anderson and Brian Oliver -has lost some of its firepower due to Oliver's nag­ging ankle injury. 
Through much of the season, Georgia Tech has won although Oliver has been slowed by a stress fracture in his left ankle. Now that his team has reached the Final Four, however, Cremins isn't so sure the ankle can outlast UNLV. 
In the NCAA tournament, Anderson, Scott and Oliver have scored 297 of Tech's 367 points, including 89 of 93 in Sunday's two-point victory over Minnesota in the Southeast Regional final. 
Oliver is still averaging more than 21 points per game, even though he's been at less than 100 percent. But scoring hasn't been the problem, and won't be the problem Saturday against UNLV.

Duke will be comfortable in Denver 
DENVER (AP) -Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who knows a thing or two about playing in small arenas, says the Blue Devils should feel right at home in the Final Four. 
The Blue Devils play their home games at Cameron Indoor Stadium, a 9,314-seat facility where boisterous Duke students jam together and sit within a few feet of the playing floor. 
The NCAA tournament's final three games are at Denver's McNichols Sports Arena, whose seating capacity of about 17,000 makes it comparatively small by Final Four standards. The next three Final Fours are in the Indiana Hoosier Dome, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and the Louisiana Superdome. 
"McNichols is a great arena," Krzyzewski said. "A small arena is louder and you feel the emotions more in a small arena."

Duke has yet to win a na­tional title under Krzyzewski, but its semifinal Saturday against Arkansas will mark the Blue Devils' third Final Four appearance in as many years and their fourth in five seasons. 
Now in his 10th season at Duke and the school's win­ningest coach, Krzyzewski said there is no magic formula for his ability to lead teams deep into the NCAA tournament. 
"We've had good players and basically our good players have been healthy in March," he said. 
As was the case following their arrival in Denver on Wednesday night, the Blue Devils held a closed-door workout Thursday at Cherry Creek High School. At the ses­sions was Duke captain Robert Brickey, who has been nursing a hamstring injury suffered last weekend at the East Regionals. 
''I'm hoping by Saturday I'll be ready to go, because this is my last shot," the senior for­ward said. 
Duke and the rest of the Final Four participants are to con­duct open practices Friday afternoon at McNichols. 
Krzyzewski is not on com­pletely unfamiliar turf in Colorado. He spent 18 months stationed at Fort Carson after his graduation from Army in 1969. While at Fort Carson, Krzyzewski was player-coach for the post's basketball team. 
"We won the 5th Army championship," Krzyzewski said. "But I'll tell you, it was more for my playing than my coaching." 
Krzyzewski's latest team dropped three of its last four regular-season games and was a semifinal loser in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. 
But the Blue Devils came back strong in the NCAA tourna­ment, using a 35-point rout of Richmond as a springboard to the East Regional title. 
team," Cremins said, "and be­lieve it or not, Brian Oliver is one of our best rebounders. His injury has disabled us from be­ing a great rebounding team." 
Averaging 6.1 rebounds per game -third on the Yellow Jackets -the 6-foot-4 senior guard pulled down an average 
4.25 rebounds during the NCAA tournament. 
''I've been amazed at the way we've been been able to get by, but we've been getting by by the skin of our teeth," Cremins said. "Against LSU, Michigan State, Minnesota, a basket here or there and you've got another team here." 
Cremins was so troubled by Oliver's play against Louisiana State in the second round that he came close to resting him. Oliver knows that only rest will get him back to full strength ­but that would come too late for the Yellow Jackets. 
"It's still sore, but the more opportunity I get to stay off it the better it's getting," Oliver said. "The biggest thing is to rest so I can get more strength in it." 
He's tying to take it easy and using a special electrode bone­healing system to hasten the recovery. 
"This time of year, I can't af­ford to sit out because I can't take a a chance of getting rusty or lose my timing," he said. "If it starts really bothering me then I'll sit down." 
Oliver reinjured the ankle during the first half of a January game against N.C. State. He came back in the sec­ond half and ended up scoring 27 points. 
But following a win over Temple, the Yellow Jackets dropped their next three games, including an overtime loss to Virginia. 
·Against the Runnin' Rebels' strong inside game, Tech's re­bounding will be crucial. 
UNLV's front line grabs more than 26 rebounds per game, and the Rebels pulled down 56 in a 131-101 win over Loyola Marymount in the Western Regional final. 
Huery wins out over alcohol, looks to win for Razorbacks 
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -Credit Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson with an assist in saving Ron Huery's career. 
As a freshman, Huery was the Southwest Conference Newcomer of the Year. As a sophomore, he was .Arkansas' leading scorer. Last year, he was off the team and in an al­cohol abuse treatment pro­gram. 
And then there's this sea­son. 
Last Saturday, after the Razorbacks' lead over Texas had dwindled to three points, Huery was Coach Nolan Richardson's choice to replace an injured Arlyn Bowers at the free throw line. Huery made both ends of the one-and­one with 16 seconds left and the Razorbacks ad­vanced to the Final Four with an 88-85 victory. 
"I may have bailed him out of the last one," Huery said. "But he bailed me out of the tight spots. If it was another coach, I wouldn't be here. I'd be somewhere out on the streets." 
It was Richardson who suspended Huery last year afte"r problems involving alcohol. Huery was ar­rested in December, 1988, on a charge of driving while intoxicated. He even­tually pleaded no contest to the charge and paid a fine. 
He was also arrested July ~3. 1988, by Memphis po­hce, who stopped a car that was traveling at a high rate of speed with a flat tire.

However, Murphy knows they have a number of other players that can play. 
"With Dave Christiansen (at shortstop), (pitcher/first base­man) Bubba Smith, and (catcher) Brian Mulligan." they have three players as good as any three on any team in the country," says Murphy. "They have tremendous balance. speed and power." 
In addition to all the talent on the field, the Illini have one of the elite field generals in col­lege baseball in Augie Garrido. Garrido was a legendary coach at Cal State-Fullerton, where he won a national championship and consistently produced College World Series partici­pants. 
The key combination to stop­ping the potent Illini attack will be seniors Brian Piotrowicz and captain Ed Lund. Piotrowicz, who is 3-2 with a 2.43 ERA and has issued only 8 walks in 3 3 1/3 innings, is a veteran of big games against Miami and Texas. Lund, a master at han­dling the Irish pitching staff, knows there isn't much room for error against Illinois. 
"Our pitching is going to have to be on," comments Lund. "We're going to have to spot the ball well and make big pitches." 
Piotrowicz is the key to the game for the Irish. If he has yet another good performance in a

big game, the Irish will be suc­
cessful. 
"Brian's going to have to get all three of his pitches over." adds Murphy. "He'll have to open with strikes, but not throw too many good strikes. He must field his position and stay composed." 
If he does get in trouble, Murphy will call on Chad Hartvigson in the early innings, Tony Livorsi in the middle, and Dave Sinnes or Chris Mihalak late in the game. 
Offensively, the Irish need to keep getting the consistent play from Eric Danapilis, Cory Mee and Dan Bautch. Freshman Danapilis leads the regulars in hitting with an astounding .406 average. Mee (.295) is steady with glove at second and at the plate. Bautch provides speed, a great on base % (.460) and a steady average (.267). The Irish need to get big games from some of their big guns though, especially Joe Binkiewicz. 
"Bink has to improve greatly," Murphy said. "I'm disappointed in his perfor­mance so far, but he's a great kid and I know he can come out of it and help us this weekend." 
If pitching takes over the game as the Irish hope, look for the team that runs the bases better to come out on top. The Irish handle the bat well and have players up and down the lineup who can move the runner over or lay down a sacrifice. Bautch leads the team with 13 steals followed by Danapilis with nine and Lund with six. The Illini are not

"They have good speed and 
they run a lot," says Lund 
whose rocket arm will go a 
long way toward discouraging 
the Illini from running. "They 
like to mix it up, using a lot of 
bunt and hit and run." 
One thing the Irish must put 
behind them is Wednesday's 10­
8 loss to Purdue, a game which 
they led 6-2 in the 7th inning. 
"We have a better ballclub 
than Purdue," observed 
Murphy. "We let things like the 
umpires and the weather get to 
us. That's not a good sign for 
the mental makeup of a team 
but I have every confidence 
we'll bounce back." 
When a team has a game like 
that, it has to go back and find 
the things that made it success­
ful. 
"Tonight (Thursday) we 
stressed the fundamentals, got 
back to basics," commented 
Lund. "You just want to pound 
the wall because you know 
you're better than that. We just 
got back to doing the little 
things right." 
Besides the Illinois game, the Irish have three big games against St. Louis at Covaleski at 1:00 on Saturday and Sunday (two games). 
"St. Louis would love to beat us," Murphy claims. 
These games are just as im­portant to the Irish and Murphy as the Illinois game. Just don't tell ESPN that. 
Umpires reach agreement 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) Major league umpires now say they will return to work Sunday under a new agreement that reimburses them for games canceled during the 32-day lockout and gives them three more vacation days during the regular season. 
Lawyers for the umpires' union and the leagues reached the out-of-court settlement Thursday. after U.S. District Judge Norma L. Shapiro re­opened a hearing on baseball's request for an order forcing the umpires back to work. 
The agreement also calls for umpires to receive regular-sea­son per diem payments begin­ning Saturday, and for the leagues to repay them for travel deposits made before January 31, but forfeited be­cause of the lockout. 
The American and National Leagues will divide a $48,500 payment among all umpires. 
Shapiro thought both sides had resolved the dispute Tuesday and announced in court that umpires would end a weeklong boycott and return to work Friday. Management and the union agreed to settle left­over differences by arbitration, and Shapiro appointed retired Common Pleas Judge Stanley Greenberg to do the job. 
But that fell through Wednesday when the owners' rejected Greenberg for undis­closed reasons. That brought both sides back to Shapiro's courtroom. 
And this time, the stumbling block was scheduling umpires for six regular-season games that were postponed from the first week of the season, American League president Bobby Brown said. 
"We were very anxious to get

a schedule they could work with and we could work with, and that's what took the time," he said. 
The union agreed to drop an unfair labor practice complaint it had filed with the National Labor Relations Board; the leagues agreed to drop their suit aimed at forcing the urn­pires back to work. 
"Fans are sick of squabbles, they're sick of legal terms," Brown said. "Now opening day can take place without any clouds on the horizon." 
In addition to Brown, those working on the final agreement included union chief Richie Phillips, National League presi­dent Bill White and their lawyers. 
"I think it's terrific," Phillips said. "It addresses all the problems we had -it increased the expenses for what's left of spring training, it compensates them for games lost in the lockout and it gives them an ex­tra three-game vacation during the season." 
The umpires boycotted the spring games, which started Monday, to protest not being consulted when regular-season games were rescheduled after the lockout ended. Minor league umps have been working the exhibition games. 
Shapiro, expressing impa­tience with both sides, opened the hearing Thursday by say­ing, "The parties have had am­ple time to resolve this. It is not complicated, it is not difficult." 
During testimony, manage­ment contended that umpires needed to work spring training to get ready for the regular season, while seven umpires testified that spring training wasn't necessary.

ND lax travels west for tournament 
By PETE LAFLEUR 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team will be looking to soar past the Air Force Academy this evening in a pivotal game to be held at the San Diego State .Tournament. The Irish will then take on either the host team or Texas Tech tomorrow in the second round of the four­team tournament. 
Notre Dame (3-3) will be looking to take a crucial first step toward an elusive NCAA bid in battling the Falcons (2­2), a team that captured the NCAA berth in 1988. The series stands at 1-1, as the Irish pre­vailing last year 10-7 at home while the Falcons won 14-8 two years ago in Colorado Springs. 
"I think every player on our team wants to play in the NCAA tournament and that's a very important goal for our pro­gram," said Irish second-year coach Kevin Corrigan. "We feel that if we do what we should, then the bid will take are of it­self. It's something that we're not going to talk about every­day." 
The first thing the Irish have to do is beat Air Force, and then wait until the season-end­ing clashes with Michigan State and Ohio State to see where they stand. All four teams are again considered to be the main contenders for the western bid, which was introduced in 1987 to increase interest in the tradi­tionally eastern sport and has twice been captured by the

Spartans (in 1987 and 1989). 
The Irish have been in con­tention for the bid every year including 1988, when they lost to Air Force early but beat Michigan State late in the year. But a win over the Falcons tonight is viewed as a must if the Irish are to make their first trip to the NCAA's. 
"We really need to get this win, especially since it's on a neutral field," said senior co­captain Mike Quigley. "If we can get past Air Force, then we will be in the driver's seat when Michigan State and Ohio State come here to play us. We've been too close in the past to not play our best now." 
Air Force will field a typically fast and athletic squad which should challenge the speed of the Irish to create a fast-paced, high-scoring game. And, as usual, the game between the growing rivals should be quite physical and emotional. 
"Every time we play them it seems to be a really fast-paced and intense game," said Quigley, who went to high school with several of the Air Force players, including his younger brother, Paul. "But if we play like we are capable of, there shouldn't be many prob­lems." 
The Irish again will be look­ing for the one-two scoring punch of their starting attack­men, senior Brian McHugh and sophomore Mike Sullivan. Sullivan leads the Irish with 16 points (7 goals, 9 assists) while McHugh has chipped in 14 points (9 goals, 5 assists). 
Sophomore Brian Schirf, who had made four straight starts on the crease, did not travel with the team after suffering a separated shoulder in last week's win over Wooster. Junior Mike Sennett is expected to return to the start­ing lineup for Schirf. 
Middie John Capano, mean­while, is expected to return to the starting lineup after miss­ing the Wooster game with a lacerated forearm. Freshman goalie Chris Parent will be starting his seventh game, hav­ing already established an Irish record 29 saves in one game while carrying a .578 save per­centage into tonight's contest. 
McHugh currently ranks sev­enth on the Irish all-time scor­ing lsist with 85 career points. He needs only seven more points to move into the sixth spot. Quigley currently stands 13th with 49 career points and needs nine more points to move into the twelfth spot. 
"They're talented, but we've gone up against people like The Bushwackers and Demolition," said Mr. X3, who claims to have averaged 43.6 points for Our Lady of the Sacred Foot in high school.

During the 1988 and 1989 seasons Darnell served as de­fensive coordinator at Florida, and for seven weeks of the lat­ter he acted as head coach. On October 8 Gator Head Coach Galen Hall resigned, and Darnell guided Florida to a 3-4 record as interim coach before being replaced by the new per­manent head coach, Steve Spurrier. During Darnell's two years at Florida the Gators ranked third in the nation in total defense. 
"When you come to Notre Dame, number one, it's a great honor, and number two, it's a great responsibility," said Darnell at the press conference on Jan. 18 when he accepted the position on the Notre Dame staff. "When we take the field, people expect to see the pinna­cle of collegiate preparation and the very best that can be done." 
Now Darnell finds himself all over the field for Notre Dame, trying to bring his defense to a type of pinnacle he discussed only two months ago. And the problems of which he and Holtz complain?

"There's a higher level that we're going to reach," said Darnell. "Lately we've tried to get the fundamentals, but there's so much to be done. There are a few basic things in Lou Holtz's defensive philoso­phy and we're not there yet. 
"The talent is there-we've just got to get that blend where the defense moves easily. We're getting there, some are nearly there, and some are a step away, but we're going to get there." 
After 21 years of coaching, Darnell has not had many problems integrating himself into the Notre Dame scheme. 
"Notre Dame as a place, the Notre Dame people, they give you a chance," he said. "They're open-minded, receptive, and I appreciate that. If things aren't working right, the problem will be right in front of your nose." 
But for now, with spring football only one week old, much work is left to be done. With so much coaching and in­struction ahead of him, Darnell is guardedly optimistic. One might say his optimism, like spring football, is in its rudi­mentary stages. 
"Right now the optimism stands because I know it (the defense) is going to work itself out. Right now we have things that we have to do. In time, the expectations are that somehow, some way, we've got to have an outstanding defense." 
Women's tennis squad travels northward to face Easte~n Michigan, Michigan State 
By BARBARA MORAN Sports Writer 
The women's tennis team will attempt to improve its 10-6 record when it heads north this weekend to face Michigan State on Saturday and Eastern Michigan on Sunday. 
The Irish snatched a close 5-4 win from Michigan State last ypar, but Notre Dame coach Jay Louderback expects a wider margin of victory against the team tomorrow. 
''I've heard that they're down a little this year from last year," said Louderback. "They've lost to a couple of teams that we've beaten and they're ranked thirteenth in the region." 
Louderback expects a stronger challenge to come from the Eastern Michigan squad, which is currently ranked tenth in the region. The Irish. who are ranked fifth, scored an impressive 7-1 vic­tory over Eastern Michigan last season, but Louderback pre­dicts a closer contest this year. 
"They were at the Eck

NO hosts Badgers Saturday after match at Miami of Ohio 
By BOB MITCHELL Sports Writer 
For the majority of the past three years, an invitation to the NCAA Collegiate Tennis Championships was a product of the Notre Dame· players' imagination. But as March' winds to a close it is reality. 
With the focus of the Irish eyes on obtaining a regional bid, one of four that are given na­tionally, Head Coach Bob Bayliss's squad is putting it all on the line this weekend as his team travels to Miami of Ohio on Saturday and 
then makes  a quick return home to take  on  
Wisconsin,  the  top-ranked  team  in  the  
Midwest.  

All that Notre Dame has accomplished this season, i.e. its first ever national ranking, wins over No. 8 TCU, No. 20 Duke, then 24th­ranked West Virginia and No. 25 Minnesota, could become an exercise in futility the Irish fall prey to two of their most competitive Midwestern foes. 
On Saturday, the Irish will travel to Miami of Ohio to take on a very experienced, senior-ori­ented squad. Under the reign of Bayliss, the Irish have never knocked off Miami. And this year's journey could prove to be a measurable task.

Darnell fits in well with Irish 
By SCOTI BRUTOCAO Assistant Sports Editor 
"What we have to achieve on 
defense is a comfort zone-to 
be fundamentally sound. There 
is nothing more important than 
that. To be fundamentally 
sound is the basis of football." 
If you guessed that these words came from a Notre Dame football coach observing spring drills, you are correct. If you guessed these sentiments came from Head Coach Lou Holtz, you're only half right. 
Though the indispensability of having a solid command of the basics is central in Holtz's philosophy, he did not utter these words. The above quote comes from Gary Darnell, new defensive coordinator and in­side linebacker coach. 
The fact is that the philoso­phies of Darnell and Holtz co­here to such an extent that you can almost interchange the names with the words. 
Consider Holtz: "The defense should come on. I just want to see us get better fundamentally and get to where we have to be." 
The inclination to panic about this mutual concern is still a long way off. In fact, such question marks on a team is only natural in spring football, especially when there are four coaches who are acclimating 
themselves  to  a  new  football  
team.  
Darnell,  former  assistant  

coach at Florida, is only the most visible of the new coaches. New on the Irish crew are de­fensive line coach Dick Bumpas, running back coach Peter Vaas, and receivers coach Skip Holtz, son of Lou. 
Darnell has taken to the Irish program with vigor. At practice on Wednesday, Darnell was jogging back and forth from watching his defensive platoon to instructing them in the bud-

Irish baseball ready for ESPN spotlight 
By MIKE KAMRADT Sports Writer 
This week, you can't mention Notre Dame baseball without saying ESPN in the same breath. 
"The stuff with ESPN, that's over," states Irish head coach Pat Murphy. "It's time to take one more step. We're preparing for this game the same way we prepare for every game. " 
It's not that Murphy isn't happy with the fact his ballclub will be playing before a national TV audience Saturday night. On the contrary, he couldn't be happier, but now it's time to face the task at hand. That next step is not only facing the Illinois Fighting Illini (7:30 at Covaleski), but beating them. That will prove to be a formidable task. . 
"This is the most explosive team we'll face all year," explains Murphy. "They're a senior-ju­nior dominated team with a lot of maturity. We'll have our work cut out for us." 
Illinois has beaten Texas and Oklahoma twice, as well as other national powers Cal State-Fullerton, New Orleans, and Michigan. The Illini have two Team USA players in third baseman Mark Dalesandro (.317) and centerfielder Kevin O'Connor. However,
