Attempted rapes reported near ND 
by Tom Kruczt"k Staff Reporter 
Three rapes or attempted rapes have occurred near the Notre Dame campus in the last three weeks, ac­cording to South Bend police. One student and his girlfriend narrowly escaped from a moving car during an attempt at gunpoint, two girls were raped and robbed, also at gunpoint, while two others were able to escape. 
According to Arthur Pears, director of security at Notre Dame, "We have not had any rapes on our campus in a number of years. We have had cases of girls having been grabbed, but there have been no rapes on the campus in a few years." 
The story is much the same off-campus, according to Division Chief Foy, of the South Bend Police Depart­ment. "It's been very quiet around the Notre Dame area." 
Captain Benninghoff of the South Bend police ex­plained that "There have not been that many incidents in the area near the Notre Dame campus to warrant more police protection. Both cases reported to us (the rape and the attempted rape) were due to hitchhiking, and we are trying to discourage this practice. These people involved are old enough to realize that they shouldn't be hitchhiking. I am sure that there have been more cases than those that hve been reported to the police." 
The alleged rapes which occurred within the last three weeks were reported to the police. The Observer interviewed the male student who was threatened by gunpoint while hitchhiking back to the campus from Nickie's with a girl three weeks ago. His name was withheld upon request. 
The student explained that a 1961 white Cadillac driven by two black men stopped and offered a ride to him and the girl. Once inside the car, one of the men produced a gun and attempted to force the male hit­chhiker out of the car. As he was being forced out of the car. the male student pulled his female friend with him and ran to safety. 
Tht" Obst"rvt"r learned of this incident afteroneof the two students involved approached The Observer to warn others of similar incidents. Captain Benninghoff stated that this case "was one of two assaults that have taken place in the last three weeks. This was an at­tempted rape, withanotherrape also being reported." 
It was also learned by the student involved in the previous attempt that the same thing happened to two other girls ten days ago. They also were able to escape unharmed. 
However, this past weekend, two other girls were raped and robbed at gunpoint, before being released on the south side of the city. The descriptions of the assailants of the latter rape case did not correspond to the first attempted rape. 
Another incident occurred earlier in the year. A male student from the University, coming back from the South Shore station to the campus, was robbed and beaten at gunpoint, by different assailants. 
The male student interviewed expressed his concern for other students who hitchhike. "We have to en­courage others to come through Tht" Observer to help out other people. It may not be the nicest thing to talk about, but something has to be done," he claimed. "Something has to be done to help students avoid this unpleasant and dangerous situation." 


Theodore Charach shows that the bullet removed from Kennedy is different than that romoved from • bystander 
by Jim Edt"r Staff Reporter 
The Hall Presidents Council last night elected Bob Howl, president of Lyons, as its new chairman by an overwhelming 12 to 3 vote. 
Howl was among three nominees for the position, including Diane Merten of Breen-Phillips and Tom Porter of Grace. Although he will be living off-campus next year, Howl is eligible to hold the chairmanship under the council's 

·· new rule allowing both former and current hall presidents to be elected chairman. 
Howl has also been recently appointed off-campus com­missioner by. Student Body President Pat McLaughlin. The question of whether holding both positions would constitute a con­flict of interests was r<rised at last night's meeting. The council, however, voted unanimously to allow Howl to decide himself whether or not he could serve both posts effectively. 

Howl said that he would like to hold both offices. "I do not believe there is a conflict of interests in­volved," he explained. "As far as the amout of work required, there is no question at all in my mind that I can make enough time to hold both positions. As off-campus commissioner I will have a large staff under me to handle most of the leg-work, so I will function primarily as an organizer and coordinator." 
Howl further explained that he believes working with both Student Government and the HPC will "help rather than hurt the two bodies." 
Holding both posts, he said, "should iust be a greater aid in 

Charach claints cover-up in Kennedy assassination probe 
The bullet that killed the late 
Senator R9bert F. Kennedy on 
June 4, 1968 couldd not have been 
fired by Sirhan Sirhan's gun an­
nounced Theodore Charach last 
night in the Library Auditorium. 
Charach, a broadcast newsman 

and investigative journalist, was 
the first person to arrive in the 
pantry of the Hotel Ambassador 
after Kennedy was fatally shot. 
For the last five years hes has 

conducted an investigation into the 
real circumstances of the 

assassination which has 
culminated in his production of the 
film "The second Gun". 

In his film, Charach presents evidence that there was another assassin responsible for Kennedy's murder and accuses the Los Angeles Police Department, Attorney General's office, presiding trial judge and California Attorney General of the suppression and manufacture of evidence and the obstruction of justice. 
In a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Charach presented an affidavit signed by the emminent criminologist Herbert L. MacDonell. In it MacDonell concludes: 
1) The bullet removed from the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy, exhibit No. 47, and the bullet removed from Mr. 
good insights who is not afraid to say what he thinks." Chong, however. did express his doubts about the feasibility of holding two positions. 

"Although J wouldn't want to force him to resign one of the posts, I feel he really should hold only one. Student Government and the HPC are two separate entities. At times being both a commissioner under the authority of the student president and the HPC .,..• chairman responsible to the hall 
Bob Howl won the election for chairman by a 12 to 3 vote 
uniting a-ll student organizations: 
HPC, Student Government and 
SLC." 
Howl mentioned that he had 
spoken with Student Body Vice 
President Frank Flanagan· before 
accepting the nomination for 
chairmanship of the council. 
"Frank assured me that my duties 
as off-campus commissioner 
would not interfere with my 
responsibilities as HPC chair­
man," he said. 
"If any problem does arise, I will deal with it at that' time by discussing it with Pat I McLaughlin>, Frank and the hall presidents," he stressed. 
Upon hearing news of Howl's election, McLaughlin said that he would speak with Howl in the next few days about his responsibilities as off-campus commissioner and the possibility of any conflicts.. "Bob is a very good choice," commented McLaughlin. "That's why I had selected him to work for me as a commissioner. I certainly won't ask him to give up the HPC chairmanship." 
Bob Chong, president of Howard praised Howl as "a person with 
Weisel, <another victim of the Sirhan shooting> exhibit No. 54, could not have been fired by the same weapon. 
2) The bullet removed from the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy, exhibit No. 47, was not fired from the Iver Johnson .22 Cadet No. h53725, the revolver reportedly taken from Sirhan. Charach, together with jour­
nalist-cinematographer Gerard Alcan have been accumulating evidence over the past five years in an atempt to re-{)pen the Kennedy assassination case. "This nonsense and this cover-up has got to stop," declared Charach. 
Dr. Thomas Noguchi, a key witness cited by Charach, was the coroner and chief medical examiner who conducted the six­hour autopsy on the late senator. In his testimony he states that the fatal bullet struck Kennedy from behind and was fired an inch or two away, from back to front and from down up so that it singed his right ear. Witnesses all agree, however, that Sirhan fired from the front from at least two feet away. 
Thane Eugene Cesar was the security guard with Kennedy at the time of the assassination. Charach has evidence that Cesar also had a .22 caliber gun, but was only cursorily examined and allowed to 

•· presidents may result in a con­
flict." 
Howl said that he realized that "the HPC is and should remain an autonomous organization. I have no intention of compromising its position, I simply hope to help the two bodies work together. The HPC finally started to realize some of its power this year by working much closer with Student Government. I hope to continued that trend." 
In his comments before the election HPC Executive Coor­dinator Wally Gasior advised the council to select a chairman who would "command respect from the 
'student organizations and the administration. He should be articulate, committed to his work and able to work well with people." Gasior also expressed his concern that "the chairman should work closely with Student Government, vet still remain the unrestricted ~oice of the HPC." 
After the election Gasior ex­pressed his approval of Howl: "He was the best choice of the three nominees. He always has something to say and he is a very good worker." 

go free by the Los Angeles authorities. 
Although Cesar claimed to have sold hisgunbefore June 4, Charach found proof in the form of a sales receipt that Cesar didn't sell the gun until September. The gun has since been stolen from the buyer. According to Charach. Cesar was a right-wing political extremist hired by the Ace Guard Service. Kennedy aides were supposedly unaware that these guards would be present. 
Charach also uses the findings of ballistics expert, William W. Harper. Harper conducted a three­year study in which he concluded that none of the bullets from Sirhan's gun entered RFK. The bullet found in Kennedy were fired from different rifling angles, from guns with different manufacturers and from barrels in different conditions. The Los Angeles Police Department tried to discredit Harper and his testimony because it contradicted the police con­clusion that the shooting was performed by a lone assassin. 
· Charach explained that Donald 
Schulman, who was in the pantry 
at the time of the shooting, insisted 
that Security guards fired back. 
His testimany was also discredited 
and he was branded a liar.

ladies going unrecognized 
by Chris O'Brien Staff Reporter 
"Basically, the Ladies of Notre Dame is an organization of the wives of members of the faculty and administrators as well as all the professional women in the University, who meet for the purpose of serving the Notre Dame Community," said Mrs. Yeandel, current president of the Ladies of Notre Dame. 
This group, which meets mon­thly, is forty years old this year and runs many programs on campus which many of the students do not know about. "Some of our most important programs," ex­plained Yeandel, "are: a blood donor program in conjunction with the blood bank in South Bend which is free to all members of the faculty, a gift to the Library Association in the Memorial Gift Fund and small gifts to the Notre Dame Merit Award. If your dorm has ever received a parcel of goodies at Christmas, chances are it came from the Ladies of Notre Dame. 
"Two of our newer programs," cited Yeandel, "are the VIA, <Volunteers in Action) and Stage Hands. The latter group is working with the Speech and Drama School and basically helps the theater group in any way we can." 
Perhaps the groups most im­portant function is to welcome the wives of new faculty members to the Notre Dame Community. "We help the wives get settled down in the neighborhood and generally meet their counterparts," said Yeandel. 
Yesterday, the Ladies of Notre Dame held their annual April meeting in the Library Auditorium The main item on the agenda according to Yeandel, was a talk given by Sr. John Miriam Jones on co-education at Notre Dame. Yeandel commented, "All the women thoroughly enjoyed Sr. Miriam's talk. We are all very pleased with Sr. Miriam's part in helping our organization.". "Following the talk, the election of officers for next year took place along with the annual reports of the programs run by the Ladies." Yeandel stated, "The Ladies will end their activities for this academic year with their luncheon in May and the newly-elected of­ficials will start to work this summer to line up our programs for next fall." 
Yeandel concluded the interview by saying, "The main purpose of the Ladies of Notre Dame is to instill a spirit of friendship and service here. We are anxious to do anything the University asks."

Pompidou dead at age 62 
By ARTHUR HERMAN 

PARIS <UPI) Georges Pompidou, who inherited from Gen. Charles de Gaulle the presidency of France and a determination to recreate the glory of France, died Tuesday of an undisclosed ailment. He was 62. 
For many months Porn­pictou's health had been of concern to Frenchmen. He himself had declared, however, "My health is my affair." 
Unofficially, French spokes­men attributed the puffiness of Pompidou's face to cortisone which he took to relieve painful arthritis. Others, however, speculated that he sufrered from multiple myeloma, a desease of the bone marrow. Cortisone is also used for this disease. 
A brief flash over the French news agency ticker at 9:58 p.m. 
(4:58 p.m. EDT) said: "M. Pompidou is dead." 
Radio stations immediately interrupted their regular pro­gramming and broke into mournful music. 
An official communique two minutes later confirmed the news. Signed by Prof. Jean Vignalou, presidential physi­cian, the medical bulletin said: "President Pompidou died today April 2." 
No official cause of death was immediately given. 
Pompidou's death will result in early national elections to pick a successor. The ballotting will be a showdown between 

Gaullists and  their  leftist  
opposition. Pompidou died  at  his  private  

residence on Quai de Bethune in the shadow of the Notre Dame cathedral. All lights were put out in the apartment where heavy curtains were drawn and a lone policeman beat the sidewalk in front of the stonewall mansion. 
Earlier Tuesday, Elysee pal­ace officials said they could

offer no explanation for Porn­pictou's newest spell of bad health. Medical bulletins pub­lished sparingly by the Elysee palace since his first indisposi­tion a year ago spoke cryptical­ly of fatigue, influenza or, on the latest occasion Feb. 21, of a painful recurrent disorder later described as hemorrhoids. 
Pompidou Tuesday canceled all official duties indefintely because of what an official Elysee presidential palace an­nouncement said was "his health condition." 
He had delegated constitu­tional presidential duties to Premier Pierre Messmer and instructed him to chair Wednes­day's cabinet meeting at the Elysee palace, an official statement from Presidential Secretary General Edouard Balladur said. 
Pompidou's death came politically at a crucial time in France, two days before the scheduled opening of the National Assembly session where the ruling Gaullists faced a major challenge from the Socialist and Communist oppo­sition on the government's economic policies. 
Wednesday's cabinet meeting was considered important since Messmer planned to seek authorization to force a show­down confidence vote in the N a tiona! Assembly. 
The parliamentary Commu­nists and Socialists have blamed the ruling Gaullists for galloping inflation and spread­ing strikes in such vital industries as banking and shipbuilding. 
Pompidou became president of France in 1969 following a brief interim reign by Alain Poher, who took over when De Gaulle resigned. 
Immediately upon the an­

nouncement of the death, 
officials informed Poher, 64, 
still president of the senate, 
that he would be the interim 
president once again under the 
constitution until the election of 
a new chief executive. 
The large tricolor flag on the 

Elyse palace was hauled down. 
In recent weeks, Pompidou, 

with his wife Claude, had been 
taking increasing refuge in his 
private home, away from the 
drafty ancient Elysee palace, to 
rest. 
The first persons to be 
informed were Premier Mess­
mer and Foreign Minister 
Michel Jobert. 

Messmer immediately took over the duties of supreme commander of the armed forces and guardian of the key to France's. nuclear force developed by de Gaulle, govern­
ment officials said.  
Pompidou's  death  left  the  
Gaullist coalition without  a  heir  
apparent  to  the  president.  
Gaullist  political  sources  said  

the Union for the Defense of the Republic <UDR>, the main Gaullist faction, would meet soon with its Independent Republican and Centrist coali­tion allies to name a single presidential candidate. 
An Elysee palace official said, "We don't know whether the president has left a letter, a sort of his political testament in which he had named his successor to be elected." 
As president of France, Pompidou continued most of the policies of de Gaulle, founder of the Fifth Republic. Like his predecessor, he became involved in several trans-Atlantic confrontations with the United States. 
In the latest of those clashes, France with Pompidou at the helm refused to join in a common energy policy of Western industrialized nations proposed by the United States. Instead, France led the in­dividual scramble for oil in the Middle East, taking advantage of excellent relations with Arab countries. 
In 1971, Pompidou held a summit meeting with President Nixon on the Portguese Azores Islands where he somehow convinced the United States to devalue the dollar for the first time, something which the United States had refused to do but which Europe had clamored for. 
Pompidou also proceeded with French national prestige projects such as the Concorde supersonic jetliner.

During the fifties and sixties, every conscientious news-listener recognized the condition of Black civil rightsasone of the continuing social tradegies in this nation. Today, the civil rights headlines are gone, but the status quo remains essentially tact. The average Black man is environmentally deprived. He earns three fifths of what his white counterpart earns. Some psychologists even claim the Black man subconsciously often considers himself inferior to his caucasian countrymen. 
The Civil Rights Conference held last week at Notre Dame rekindled another white soul search for those who bothered to listen. Despite the persistence of Blacks' second class citizenship in America, Black civil rights does not attract the attention of past years. Black civil rights seems to have sunk to the feature section of daily papers and the 
trifling "you  know  whats"  of daily  conversation.  The  general  
population rights.  se ems  to  have lo st track  oi important  minority civil  

. Wh~re has ~he "all men created equal" ideal gone? Everyone, who hved m America after the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision in which the Supreme Court outlawed <>eparatebut "equal" facilitie~ for Blacks, knew of no greater issue thanthe "race.issue. For the first time since Lincoln, Black people received impetus towards eman­cipation. Several leaders rose to meet the call, including a Mon­tgomery Alabama, Public Transportation boycotter named Martin Luther King. From 1954 until the late sixties, every news-listening American heard thirteen percent of America demand equality. Then a bullet went off, and a leader fell. Somewhere in the midst of all the confusion, news-listening America heard the words civil rights replaced by VietNam. More bullets went off, and America stayeddistracted. 
The Civil Rights Conference, this past week, seemed more like a commemoration than a dedicationtowardscivil rights. The public, wh­ich listened so intently during the fifties and sixties attended the commemoration in numbers that normally attend wakes. 
America today has found Watergate to replace Viet Nam. This 
country has also mixed a great deal of women's needed rights with the cause for Black equal rights. In this confusing, political maze, Black problems do not receive as much attention as Arab sheiks, Russian Jews or the price of gold. 
Since 1947, Blacks have improved their lot in America slowly. From an income offifty-three percent of white earnings, Blacks have im­proved their pay to sixty percent of a white pay check. Blacks now enjoy access to higher education and opportunitieS to previously closed occupations. Although change is occuring, ghettos are still Black. Poverty rolls are still Black. Discontent, only temporarily silent, is still Black. The United States guarantees equality to all, but equality does not exist for all. If America does not find the same concern for civil rights that she has shown in the past, America will find the drive toward equality thwarted. Unless American remem­bers the news-listening concern of Martin Luther King's fifties and sixties, America ·will continue to have second class .citizens, second class racial problems and a second class morality.

the 46th parallel -­notes on the academy awards 


by fred graver 
************************************************* 
One question: why does this colossal display of ·bad taste and putrid "Babbitry" continue to be one of the most popular an­nual events in the world'? 
Answer: Because it's a vicarious thrill for the common everyday person to see people being awarded and congratulated for something that, to them, is just their job. Like Sly says, "Everybody Is A Star." Deep in the hearts of those people who sit their bods down in front of the tube is the wish that one day they will hear, "and the nominees for most boring and tedious work imaginable, carried on with fanatical dedication, are: Harry W. Scranz for pumping gas at the Esso station on the corner of 5th and Main in Oshkosh, Wise; Melva J. Purnell for her duties as late-shift telephone operator in Scranton, Penn­sylvania; Jacob Trackovich for his creative use of the plumber's helper in a special leak repeair for his mother-in-law; and Mr. Clive, of Omaha, for "the works," per­formed in his salon for Mrs. L.W. Brooks, Oak Brook, Ill. And the winner is ..." 
************ 
I really think it would be something if, one year, the man who hands over the en­velopes would sell out for advertising. Not only would he make himself a few bucks, but it might prove interesting. Imagine Raquel Welch and Burt Reynolds staring blankly into space, waiting for the envelope, when an arm shoots out with the words em­blazoned across "Hemorrhoids are no laughing matter." Then on the following award, in the great Burma-Shave tradition, a rejoinder reading "Use Preparation H." 
************ 
The choreography for "Live and Let Die" reminded me of a film I saw on "Creature Features" a few weeks ago. It was entitled "Attack of the Silver Mongoloids" and featured George Sanders and Zsa Zsa Gabor as a pair of unknowing astronomers who receive a visit one night from a group of, well, Silver Mongoloids. Except last night the part of Zsa Zsa was played by Connie Stevens, and the part of George Sanders was not played at all. Which is a pity, because I think David Niven could have pulled it off, as long as they didn't let him say anything. 
************ 
I wonder if Marvin Hamlisch will beome the new darling of Hollywood, as Burt Bacharach did after all of his awards for "Butch Cassidy." I doubt it, since Marvin has that lisp, and the strange swing of his hips, and a wife who looks about as much like Angie Dickinson does as Alfred Hit­chcock looks like Candice Bergen. 
There's also the matter of that strange waving of the wands which Marvin displayed when he ran up to receive his first award for The Sting. From what my press release says, Marvin used to be a member of the Krishna sect, and twirls his fingers in the air every time he gets in front of a crowd. This definitely will bring points against him when they are voting for "New Hollywood Darling." 
************ 
It is a .common Hollywood notion that no actor should ever attempt to steal a scene from a child, or an animal. One of the worst things I have ever seen, along thsee lines, were those two little cherubs singing that song last night. Talk about hamming it up. Next time, maybe they should try having a little kid singing to a horse, or a pig, or perhaps a bowl of pirhana. <Better yet, a bowl of farina. This has never been known to steal a scene in the entire history of films.) 
************ 
This was a night for the old men and women of the films. Also I think that it was the night for all of Hollywood to flaunt their garishness in the face of America and say, "Forget you, folks. We earn a lot of money, and have a good time, and you pay us for every cent of it. So, if you don't like the awards, shove it." 
The two are related, I think. One of the prime features of old age and affluence is the ability to tell the world to get lost. This was "old" Hollywood's way of saying, 

'1Look Marlon Brando, George C. Scott, and 
Sacheen Littlefeather, we gave the chance 
to play along, now go and find another 
game." 

It's too bad that most of the people ex­
claiming this didn't think twice about their 
words. If Hollywood really thinks that it is 
arrogant and brash in the true f,rtistic 
sense, why do they have to keep patting 
themselves on the back to remind each 
other'? 

Perhaps they are getting the feeling that people are beginning to say "So What" to -the Academy Awards show. 
************ 
I doubt if many people got the irony of the 
streaker coming in just before the award for 
"Best Picture" was given to a Notre Dame 
graduate, Notre Dame being the home of the 
streak. 

I doubt if many got the irony, because it 
really wasn't there. I just thought I'd 
mention it. 

************ 
The musical number before the Marx 
Brothers' tribute was really, as Bette 
Midler would say, "the pits." No wonder 
that show only ran on Broadway for three 
performances. 

Groucho was pretty spunky, though. I 
think he was just trying to look more 
mentally competent than Chaplin. 
Maybe some smart newsman or talk-show 
host could hold a showdown between all of 
the grand oldsters of Hollywood. One hour of 
Chaplin, Groucho, Hitchcock, and Chief Dan 
George answering the rapid-fire questions 
of Tatum O'Neal and Linda Blair. That is 
why television was invented!

When is the Beaux Ball? 
The Beaux Ball, held in the Architecture Building, is this Saturday, April6 at 9:00p.m. It is a costume ball and is open to the student body. The cost is $4.50 per couple. The theme of this years ball is FAT. 
I am a Sophomore Business Major intending to major in Ac­counting. Because of the lack of room some students were not able to get into the CPA coaching course this year. What policy will the Accounting department go by in future years for the enrollment in this class? 
The Accounting department underestimated the number of ac­counting majors two years ago which is one of the main reasons why there was a problem this year in the CPA class. The Ac­counting department has come up with a policy for future years regarding this course and it will be explained to the Accounting majors during their Meet-Your-Major week. 
I'm from Boston and would like to know if there is a Boston truck to get all my stuff home at the end of the year? 
Right now there is no Boston truck. The closest truck to the New England States would be the New York Met truck which covers New York and White Plains. However, if there is enough student interest and the administration permits it a Boston truck could be gotten. For more information call Bill Kelly, head of the New York Met Club, at 234-5193. 
Will transportation be provided for the Armory Party?

Buses will leave the Notre Dame circle at 8:30, 9:00,9:30, and 10:00. They will be at SMC at 8:45, 9:15, 9:45 and 10:15. They will also be at the armory after the party for rides back. If you miss all of the buses you can get to the armory by going south on 31, taking a right on Ewing, going for ten blocks and turning right on Kemble.

Survey to be conducted on health needs 
by Fred Graver 
Contributing Editor 
The Office of Student Affairs will be conducting a survey this week to find out what students think about the University Infirmary, and what changes they would like to see. 
The survey is being conducted for several reasons. First, the study has been recommended by the Committee on University Priorities. Second, it is necessary for future planning by the In­firmary staff. Finally, it should determine, from the consumer's point of view, what is in the needed in the way of health services on campus. 
Not only does the questionnaire seek information about the In­firmary, but also about the students' preferences for other types of medical care. 
The survey is being taken in two ways. All students using the In­firmary over the next few weeks will be asked to complete a questionnaire following the visit. In addition, a sample of all students eligible for the services of the Infirmary will receive a questionnaire in the mail. 
The sample will include ten percent of the male students and twenty-five of the female students, the difference being necessary because of the small number of women attending Notre Dame. In all, it is hoped that as many as 2000 students will have a n opportunity to express their attitudes toward health care at Notre Dame. 
The written comments on 
specific aspects of the Infirmary 
are most important to the 
researchers, and will be held in 
strictest confidence. They will be 
used only in summary reports. 
Students who receive a 
questionnaire are urged to return 
it promptly. Students living off 
campus are included in the study 
as well as graduate students. 
Brother Just Paczesny, C.S.C, 
director of student services, has 
represented the University in 
planning the survey. Clover 
Gowing, a master's candidate in 
health education, has coordinated 
the plans with the administrator of 
the infirmary, Sister Miriam 
Dolores, C.S.C. Also working on 
the survey was Dr. Charles Arens 
of the psychological services 
center. 
Because the survey is brief, and 
the responses are returned by 
campus mail, a high rate of return 
is anticipated.

Weather, par not hazards to golf captain Burda 
by John Fineran 
Whether or not Notre Dame's golf team opens its 1974 season this, Saturday on the Burke Memorial Course against Tri-State University (12:00 p.m.) will depend on--well, the weather. 
However, for one member of 
O'S II' ' d
Coach NoeI u JVan s squa , Je{f Burda, the weather won't be much of a factor. In fact, the Aptos, Calif. native is used to all kinds of it. 
Burda's home is not far from one of the greatest golf courses in the world-historic Pebble Beach-and a~yone who ?as watched any of ~mg Cros~r s annual January 
cl=mbakes •can attest to the various degrees of the weather there. Certainly, Burda is no exception. 
"When you play at Pebble Beach," the junior co-captain says, "you have to think about every shot. There are no easy holes and the weather in the winter doesn't help things at all." 
The facf that Burda would be used to golf weather at all is a story in itself. After all, he won eight letters, four of them in baseball, during his high school days at Robert L. Stevenson High in Pebble Beach. 
"Baseball was a six-month sport for me in high school," Burda 
10, I never really concentrated on playing golf until the spring of my senior year." 
Burda could have stayed in California and decided to play at a school where golf is a year-round thing, but he decided to come to Notre Dame because of its "big­time reputation." 
And O'Sullivan is glad he did. "I'm blessed to have a player of Jeff's talent, potential and tern­perament," the popular first-year coach says. "This could be his 
season to become one:>f the all-time great.s in the sport at Notre Dame." "He hits the ball long of{ the tee,

But eventually those things work themselves out. You find your staff. You turn to Greg Corgan and Peggy Lawlor and ask them for their time and their help, and they give you both. Willingly. You get the same sort of response from John Fineran. And you are lucky enough to find a cluster of very talented underclassmen: Pete McHugh, Hal Munger, Sam · Yannucci, and John Higgins. 
Then, finally, you have only yourself to train. So you begin to do just that. You begin spending time at the Convocation Center, getting to know people, and becoming familiar with the phenomena that can only be described as "Notre Dame athletics." 
As you become part of the day-by-day routine at the ACC, you discover a genuinely human operation. You get to know the staff in that building. From the Sports Information crew-Roger Valdiserri, Bob Best, Lois Walsh and Patty Sniadecki-in one instance, to ticket manager Don Bouffard in a second, to business manager Bob Cahill and his office staff in a third. And you begin to appreciate the incredible behind-the­scenes effort that goes into making Notre Dame athletics what they are. 
You get to know the coaches. From Ara, Digger, and Lefty, to Noel O'Sullivan. You get to know the athletes, too. Personally, in a way few others will. You come to realize what they go through in practice every day and, realizing that, you're able to savor their game performances just that much more. 
There's no other way to explain the tearful jubilation you feel when Robin Weber makes a game-saving catch in the Sugar Bowl; or to explain how pleased you feel when guys like Pete Crotty perform well on the basketball court, or when Ric Schafer scores a crucial goal in a hockey game. 
But you run the risk of seeing things go the other 
way, too. You run the risk of seeing Tom Devine 
crumple to the turf of Cartier Field. Screaming. 
Knowing that a knee tear has just ended his football 
career. 
You run the risk of seeing John Shumate sitting by 
himself in the corner of a hushed locker-room in 
Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Dry~yed, but silent. Knowing 
that the season, once so promising, is now over. 
And you run the risk of seeing Adrian Dantley, 
sitting in front of his locker, enduring the questions of 
local reporters. You run the risk of hearing him say, 
as an 18-year-old freshman, that "I let the team down 
tonight. Of all the starters, I think I played the worst. 
I let them down." 
You run those risks, but you know, at the same 
time, that they will round out the picture you have of 
college athletics. For just as four years at Notre 
Dame will teach you that this is a very good-though, perhaps, not an ideal-place, nine months of close association with Notre Dame's athletic program will teach you that there is more than triumph in this realm, too. In seeing both extremes, though, you learn to respect these people-the players and the coaches-just a little bit more. 
And if you're luck, as I have been, you'll gain something else, too. You'll gain friendships­friendships which would give you cause to lament the 
year's passing even if the football team had gone 7-3, or if the basketball team had gone 13-13. 
Many of those friendships will be formed during practice sessions, or in post-game locker-rooms. Many will be formed elsewhere: in classrooms dorm rooms, and maybe even press rooms. '

Pittsburgh-eight hours each way in the Observer's 
Ford Econovan, and sleeping 14 in a room for four in 
the Iron Gate Holiday Inn. 
Austin Peay-sitting in aTerre Haute Pizza Hut on 
Friday evening and, along with Tom Varga, John 
Palkovics and Leo Schmelzer, stuffing the Pizza Hut 
ballot boxes for Goose Novak-and, at the same time, 
casting 20 write-in votes for Schmelzer. 
UCLA-Dwight Clay, surrounded by a circle of 
reporters, moisture beading on his face, his lips 
curling in a smile, saying: "I wanted that shot badder 
than anything." 
Miami-Gerry DiNardo, trying to break into the 
cocoanut he'd found on a nearby golf course; and a 
young Latin girl, a Dairy Queen employee, asking, 
curious, "Where is Notre Dame? That's near here, 
isn't it? Isn't it just to the north of us?" 
Wisconsin-goalie Mark Kronholm, being mobbed 
by the Irish icers after the 6-4 victory which snapped 
Wisconsin's unbeaten streak. 
Southern Cal-standing and shouting, along with 
Greg Corgan and virtually every other occupant of .

Danny Reese and broke into the clear at the Notre

Alabama-Hysteria. And you remember laughing, 
"Weber caught it. Oh my God, Weber caught it." 
Vanderbilt-the woman behind the counter at the 
Alabama Bookstore, smiling sheepishly as she 
displayed the stack of bumper stickers which read 
"Notre Who?" "Y'all should have seen how many of 
them we sold before the Sugar Bowl," she said. 
And your list could go on and on, filled with 
moments sometimes connected with Irish athletics, 
sometimes not: talking with Father Jim Riehle 
during a hockey practice session; or talking with 
Terry Lally just before the student bus left for the 
cross-town drive to the Orange Bowl and the Miami 
game; or an outrageous party in Keenan Hall during 
the telecast of the Rice game. 
Those events seem so alive now, even though some 
of them happened 'way back in October, but you've 
known all along that they seem that way because of 
the people--the friends-involved. 
Even so, you begin to appreciate that even more as 
your year as sports editor draws to a close. You 
begin to realize that yours has been a rare and 
privileged position. And you begin to realize, too, that 
you'll never be able to give those friends sufficient 
thanks for what this year has brought. 
Finally, you begin to realize just how much you are 
going to miss it all. And you realize that the time has 
passed quickly. Much more so than you ever thought 
possible.
