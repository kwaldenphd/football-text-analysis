The long journey home 
Friends come together to help cancer patient George Porter-Young return to his family in England one last time 
By CHRIS HINE News Writer 
On a bitter cold January day in South Bend, Dr. Dean Park walked into George Porter-Young's hospital room and shut the door. 
Over the past few weeks, George, 72, had been passing out during his breaks at work in Sbarro's in the LaFortune Student Center, a pattern that alarmed his doctor. Dr. Park, an oncologist, had put him through a rigorous regimen of tests -from X-rays to multiple bone marrow drills ­but this time George sensed something was different in Dr. Park's demeanor; he rarely shut the door to talk to George. 
"I said, 'Hello, something must be up," George said in his British accent. It's been 42 years since George left his family in England and came to America, but he never lost that accent so many customers in LaFortune have come to love over the past eight years. "You closed my door, you must want some privacy." 
Dr. Park confirmed George's intuition. "I've got some bad news for you," he said. 
But before Dr. Park could speak another word, George interrupted him. George was fed up with all the tests he was taking and the time he was spending in the hospital. He didn't want more tests. He didn't want Dr. Park skirting the issue. He just wanted to know the truth, no matter how chilling it was. 

"Do me a favor," he told the doctor. "You better tell me the truth, because ifyou don't tell me the truth, I'll be your worst enemy. But ifyou tell me the truth, then I'll be your best friend." 
Dr. Park told George the truth. "You have myelodysplastic syndrome," Dr. Park said. 
But George had no idea what that was. "It's bone cancer," Dr. Park said. "And it could lead to leukemia." 
Leukimia? George knew from experience -his uncle had suffered from it -that leukemia was not curable. And so, George asked one of the most painful questions of his life. 
"How long do I have left to live?" he asked. 

"Six months to two years. But maybe more," Dr. Park said, trying to put as posi­tive of a spin on it as he could. 
At first, George's mind went blank. 
"I said 'Well, there's only one person who knows when I'm going to die,"' George said. "And that's God. I'm sure he will let me know when it's my time." 
After a few seconds he thought of one thing-his sister, Joan. 
After listening to Dr. Park describe the various treatments he would have over the next few months -including hydration, blood transfusions and chemotherapy ­George called his sister in England. 
George dreaded this call to England. Joan's husband, Thomas, had just died of cancer a few months earlier, and George couldn't make it home for the funeral. How would Joan react now when George told her that he, too, had cancer? 
"I thought 'Oh God, not another one,"' Joan said. "I said to him, 'Please come back home.' All my life I've always said he's been gone to America. Wait until he's a little older and he's not well. He'll be back. And I've always said that." 
George Porter-Young has stared death in the face before, and hasn't backed down. As a young boy living near London during WWII, death was an everyday occurrence. George said its coming was signaled by the sound of Nazi war planes flying overhead

ND ere a tes office for envirol1111ent awareness 
By KATIE PERALTA Assistant News Editor 
In its efforts to continue sus­tainability and environmental awareness, Notre Dame has created the Office of Sustainability, and had named James M. Mazurek as its first director. 
Mazurek, a Notre Dame grad­uate, will begin at his new post May 1. 
The new office, which was created in January, will focus on University building efficiency and carbon strategy, among other environmental issues, said junior Lourdes Long, a repre­sentative to the Energy and Environmental Issues Committee. 

"[The office was created] to focus on energy and environ­mental action on campus," Long said. "It will develop a sustain­ability strategy for Notre Dame." 
Long said the plans for the office's implementation have been in the works for about a year, and that she is excited about Mazurek's appointment

Love thee Notre Daine 
I did not always know that I wanted to attend the University of Notre Dame. For a while, I thought the University of Pennsylvania or possibly Dartmouth would be my top choice. They were both good schools, close to home and a bunch of my kids from high school always went there. 
I decided to visit Notre Dame on a whim. Two of my

and I figured that even if I didn't like the school, it would be a fun weekend anyway. 
When my dad and I drove up Notre Dame Avenue, we were greeted by possibly the most beautiful sight I have ever laid eyes on -the Golden Dome. It left both of us speechless, and I never looked back. I ended up applying to Notre Dame early action, and, after receiving my acceptance letters; I shredded my other applications (much to the chagrin of my mother). 
llowevor, it was not long until she too was won over. When we carne out to South Bend last fall, she still was not convinced that Notrn Dame was the right choice. It was far from horne in New York, and it had always been her hopo that I would attend an Ivy Lnagtw school. 
But tlw energy I felt when I stepped on this campus was intoxicating-unlike anything else I havo ever fnlt. There is this ineredible aura that sur­rounds the University. As my dad would say, it is weird to be in a place where everyone seems so happy all the time. My mom must have felt it too, because at the end of Frosh-0 she told me that I had definitely made the right decision in choosing Notre Dame. 
However, freshman year has not been entirely easy. There have been times of trial and tribulation as well. I have gotten bad grades, experienced heart­break and gotten very little sleep. 
But the mistakes I have made and the hard times that I have experienced at Notre Dame have helped me grow more as a per­son. I am happier now than I have ever been in my life, largely because the friends I have made at Notre Dame have helped me get through the bad times and focus on the good. Together, we have tested our strength against the force of gravity, found new uses for a rope, a skateboard and a bike, fed the ducks, expe­rienced the glory that is Fr. George Hozum, Alumni Hall and the Wake and made more trips to Meijer than I can even count. 
It has truly been the greatest time of my life, and all this sum­mer I will be counting down until next year.

Newlyweds spend night in jail after fighting each other 
PITTSBURGH -A newly­wed couple spent the night in separate jail cells -she in her wedding gown ­after police said they brawled with each other, then members of another wedding party, at a subur­ban Pittsburgh hotel. 
The fight started Saturday night after a reception when he knocked her to the floor with a karate kick in the seventh-floor hallway of a Holiday Inn -and escalated when she attacked two guests from another wed­ding party who came to her aid, police said. 
The melee moved to an elevator and then to the lobby, where the couple threw metal planters at the two good Samaritans, caus­ing minor injuries, police charged. 
300-pound man sues Ark. jail over weight loss 
BENTONVILLE, Ark. -An inmate awaiting trial on a murder charge is suing the county, complaining he has lost more than 100 pounds because of the jailhouse menu. 
Broderick Lloyd Laswell says he isn't happy that he's down to 308 pounds after eight months in the Benton County jail. He has filed a federal lawsuit complaining the jail doesn't provide inmates with enough food. 
According to the suit, Laswell weighed 413 pounds when he was jailed in September. Police say he and a co-defendant fatally beat and stabbed a man, then set his home on fire. 
"On several occasions I have started to do some exercising and my vision went blurry and I felt like I was going to pass out," Laswell wrote in his com­plaint.

Barbie deemed 'destructive' in Iran 
TEHRAN, Iran -A top Iranian judiciary official warned Monday against the "destructive" cultural and social consequences of importing Barbie dolls and other Western toys. 
In the latest salvo in a more than decade-old government campaign against Barbie, Prosecutor General Ghorban Ali Dori Najafabadi said in an ollicialletter to Vice President Parviz Davoudi that the doll and other Western toys are a "danger" that need to be stopped. 
"The irregular importation of such toys, which unfortunately arrive through unofficial sources and smuggling, is destructive culturally and a social danger," said the letter, a copy of which was made available to The Associated Press. 
Iranian markets have been inundated with smuggled Western toys in recent years partly due to a dramatic rise in purchasing power as a result of increa.:;ed oil revenues. 
Chinese train derails leaving 70 dead

China reacted swiftly to its worst train acci­dent in a decade, sending top officials and sol­diers to Zibo, the site of Monday's pre-dawn crash in eastern China's Shandong province, and sacking two railway officials. 
Authorities were quoted as saying that human error was to blame. The official Xinhua News Agency also said one of the trains was traveling too fast.

I 00 truckers protest high fuel prices 
WASHINGTON -Horns blaring in a deafen­ing fanfare, a convoy of truck drivers traveled to Washington on Monday to protest record fuel prices. 
Members of Truckers and Citizens United circled the National Mall before parking their rigs at RFK Stadium. From there, about 100 protesters marched and took shuttles to the Capitol, where an afternoon rally was held. 
"The high price for oil is hurting our econo­my," organizer Mark Kirsch said. "It's hurting middle class people." 
The national average price of a gallon of regular gasoline is a record $3.51, according to a recent survey of stations by AAA and the Oil Price Information Service. The price for diesel-used to transport most food, industri­al and commercial goods-is $4.20 a gallon. 

Storms, tornadoes damage Virginia

Suffolk city spokeswoman Dana Woodson says the death occurred when two apparent torna­does passed through the city Monday afternoon. 
Bob Spieldenner from the Virginia Department of Emergency Management says at least 200 others were injured in Suffolk. Spieldenner says at least 18 others were injured in Colonial Heights.

Voters still required to show photo ID 
WASHINGTON -The surge of new voters into the 2008 presidential campaign could run up against a Supreme Court-sanctioned barrier next week, a law requiring photo identification before casting a ballot. 
The court upheld a Republican-inspired law in Indiana Monday that Democrats say will keep out some poor, older and minority vot-. ers. 
Indiana's presidential primary is May 6, and many new voters are expected to turn out for the Democratic contest between Sens. Hillary Hodham Clinton and Barack Obama. 
The results could say something about the effect of the law, either because a large num­ber of voters will lack identification and be forced to cast provisional ballots or because the number turns out to be small.

Senator 9 points ahead of McCain, outpaces Democratic rival Barack Obama 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Hillary Hodham Clinton now leads John McCain by 9 points in a head-to-head presidential matchup, according to an Associated Press-Ipsos poll that bolsters her argument that she is more electable than Democratic rival Barack Obama. 
Obama and Republican McCain are running about even. 
The survey released Monday gives the New York senator and former first lady a fresh talking point as she works to raise much­needed campaign cash and persuade pivotal undecided superdelegates to side with her in the drawn-out Democratic primary fight. 
Helped by independents, young people and seniors, Clinton gained ground this month in a hypothetical match with Sen. McCain, the GOP nominee-in-waiting. She now leads McCain, 50 percent to 41 percent, while Obama remains virtually tied with McCain, 46 per­cent to 44 percent.

LeMans hall director gets new apartment 
Office of Residence life converted the student lounge located in the tower into a living space during break 
By MANDl STIRONE 
A.'5istant News Editor 
LeMans Hall residents 
returned from break in 
January to lind that the tower 
room, one of the few student 
lounges in the building, had 
bnen turned into an apartment 
for their hall director, Trish 
Hodge. 
All of the hall directors at 
Saint Mary's were having their 
apartments refurbished, 
Director of Residence Life 
Slandah Dieujuste said. 
Continued construetion 
around and throughout the 
building had rendered Hodge's 
previous apartment, located in 
the basement of the building, 
unusable, Director of Facilities 
Bill Hambling said. 
"We kept traipsing through 
the apartment to do what we 
had to do. It just really was 
making a mess of things for 
anybody who had to be down 
there," he said. 
Construction on the tower 
room was supposed to be over 
in December but didn't finish 
until January, Dieujuste said. 
!lodges was able to move in 
right after that, she said. 
ller new apartment is a "New 
York style kind of motif," 
llambling said. 
It has a loft where her bed­
room is with a space under­
neath, Oieujuste said. There is 
also a private kitchen ofT to one 
side of the entrance to the 
apartment. she said. On the 
opposite side of the entrance is 
"her private bath which also 
has her washer and dryer," she 
said. 
Construction crews have 
been working on the plumbing 
and drainage of the building 
and much of the work has b(~en 
in the basement, Hambling 
said. 
"The down spouts and gut­tBrs from the roves were plugged, water was backing up and going into student rooms," he said. 
This was because these down spouts and gutters actually ran inside the walls of LeMans and were tied into the sanitary lines of the building, IIambling said. 
Construction crews were working to clear out these spouts as well as disconnecting them from the sanitary lines and connecting them to the storm watnr system, he said. 
Now, instead of running rain­water out of the building with the sanitary lines, he said, it is going into Lake Marion and the St. Joseph's Hiver, he said. 

In addition. the pipes that are running down the walls of l.cMans arc being pressurized to eheck for further leaks, and then hydro-flushed to ensure that all the water is flowing out of them, hn said. 
"We're going to stop the leaks from eoming back into the building," llambling said. 
This surnnwr tlwy will also be going back through LeMans to fix much of the damage caused by the leaks, he said. 

Though the basement apart­nwnt probably eould have been rnfurbished, the decision was made to move Hodge into an apartmnnt in another part of the building, Dieujuste said. 
"It just wasn't the same as the other hall directors apart­ments that were rnnovated," she said. 
After a careful snareh of the building, Dieujuste and llambling decided on the tower 
room for the new apartment, 
he said. 

"Slandah and I walked 
around looking for available 
space throughout the entire 
part of Lemans ... trying to find 
something that would be big 
enough to accommodate Trish's 
needs and there really wasn't 
anything without taking rooms 
out of service," he said. 

The decision was made in 
Oetober or September of this 
sehool year and student input 
was not eonsidered, Dieujuste 
said. 

"[When we do] renovations 
then we consult students and 
we form a small committee, but 
something like this, because it 
was a personal space, we really 
didn't form any committees or 
anything like that," she said. 
Based on the information she 
had received, the tower room 
was hardly being used by stu­
dents, she said. 

"From the feedbaek we got 
from RA's and the hall direc­
tors, [use was] seldom. I mean, 
most students didn't even know 
that it was there, for those stu­
dents that did know it was 
quite a hike ... it was just an 
awkward space," she said. 

Student reactions to losing 
the lounge space has been 
mixed. 

Some students were unaware 
that the tower room spaee had 
once been available to them as 
a student lounge. 

"I didn't even know that we 
were allowed up there," sopho­
more LeMans resident Ashley 
Breen said. 

Other students were upset about losing the space once reserved for student use. 
"1 hate it, I think it's ridieu­l<lus," sophomore Emily Schneider said, "When it would snow, you could see the coolest view ever [from the tower room] and it was really serene and really pretty and now we can't even see it." 
She went on to talk about 
how she and her friends used 
the room. 

"We used to have pizza par­ties up there for my friends' birthdays," the former LeMans resident said. 
Other students who lived in LeMans were also upset about losing the tower room. 
"[The tower room] should be for the use of students, like it's always been," senior Jeney Anderson said. 
However, students will be getting an updated lounge spaee in LeMans, Oieujuste said. They will be refurbishing "Vendoland," the area near the vending machines and the washers and dryers in the basement of LeMans, she said. That ineludes new lighting, rugs, window treatments, tables and chairs for group work, she said, and some more comfortable eouehcs, potential­ly including a few recliners. 
They are also looking to add some nnw appliances and sup­plins to the kitehen also loeated in the basement of LeMans off of the "Vendoland" room, she said. 
"What we're really looking to do [with Vendolandl is provide students a space that they're comfortable, wlwrn they can socialize but a space that they ean also study. So we're look­ing at providing different types of furniture than is already there," she said.

IN BRIEF NYRA moves its way out of bankruptcy 
ALBANY, N.Y. -The New York Racing Association said Monday it's closer to emerg­ing from bankruptcy, and horse racing in the state got a potentially lucrative boost with a decision allowing racetracks and off-track bet­ting facilities to take wagers over the Internet. 
NYRA holds the state's franchise to run thor­oughbred racing at Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga. The group said a federal judge approved its amended plan to pay back credi­tors, a deal funded by a $105 million state bailout. 
The Racing and Wagering Board, the state's racing regulator, said it will allow bets to be taken from phones, including cell phones, over the Internet or by other electronic means. Some Internet betting has been temporarily allowed since last summer. 
In another development, bidders who creat­ed Hard Rock cafes and others who helped bring big-time casinos to Connecticut want to turn Aqueduct into a Queens hot spot. 
Crude oil prices continue to rise 
VIENNA, Austria-Oil prices hit an all-time high near $120 a barrel Monday after a week­end refinery strike closed a pipeline system that delivers a third of Britain's North Sea oil to refineries in the U.K. 
The shutdown comes amid supply outages in Nigeria that have helped to support oil against a strengthening dollar. 
"We've got a confluence of a number of events that have really disrupted crude oil supply," said Victor Shum, an energy analyst with Purvin & Gertz in Singapore. "That's what's driving oil to a new record even though the U.S. dollar actually strengthened a bit." 
Light, sweet crude for June delivery rose to a record $119.9 3 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract eased back to $119.04 a barrel by afternoon in Europe, up 52 cents from Friday's closeof$118.52. 
BP PLC on Sunday shut down the Forties Pipeline System that carries more than 700,000 barrels of oil a day to the U.K. because of a 48-hour walkout by employees at a refinery in central Scotland.

Candy corporations to combine 
Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. to sell to M&Ms maker Mars Inc. in deal financed by Warren Buffet 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -The Oracle of Omaha is betting that the country's candy jar is recession-proof. 
With financing from Warren Buffett, candy maker Mars Inc. on Monday said it is buying .confectioner Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. for an estimated $23 billion in cash. The deal would marry brands that sweet-toothed Americans have munched cin for decades: Mars owns Snickers and M&Ms; Wrigley's gum brands include Juicy Fruit, Orbit, Extra and Big Red. 
"A good time to buy a really great business is when you can do it," Warren Buffett said on CNBC Monday, adding that he understands Mars and Wrigley better than the balance sheets of most major banks. 
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. will pur­chase a $2.1 billion minori­ty equity interest in the Wrigley subsidiary once the deal is completed. The Omaha, Neb.-based com­pany also offered $4.4 bil­lion of subordinated debt to fund the deal.

President urged to step dovvn 
Opposition unites in Parliament; asks Mugabe to concede defeat 
Associated Prrss 
JOIIANNESBUHG Zimbabwe's opposition move­ment united Monday in spite of long-standing divisions, declaring that it has won con­trol of Parliament for the first time in history and that President Hobert Mugabe must concede defeat. 
Opposition leaders also appealed to the U.N. Seeurity Council to send a special envoy to Zimbabwe and to warn Mugabe that the mounting vio­loncn against opposition sup­porters was tantamount to "crimes against humanity." 
Putting months of bickering behind them. Movement for Democratic Change leaders Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara stood together and ordered Mugabe to step aside. 
"Old man. go and have an honorable exit," Tsvangirai said in a message to the S4­year-old autocrat who has ruled since independence from Britain in 19SO. 
"In a parliamentary democ­racy, the majority rule," Tsvangirai said alongside Mutambara at a news confer­fmce. "lie should concede that ... he cannot be president." 
More than a month after the elections, results from the presidential race have not been announced. Tsvangirai maintains that he won the presideney outright although independent observers say he fell just short of the votes needed to avoid a runoff. 
Tsvangirai reiterated Monday that he would not take part in a runoff. 

"The question about a runoff doesn't arise. It doesn't arise because of the simple fact that the people have spoken, the people have decided," he said. 
The opposition maintains that hundreds of its supporters have been arrested, attacked or driven from their homes, especially in rural areas that used to be Mugabe strongholds but voted against him in the elections. It says that 14 of its supporters have died, but there is no independent confir­mation of this. 
The Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights says more than 63 people were hospitalized in three days last week alone, and pro­vided shocking photos of injuries. 
Movement for Democratic Change secretary-general, Tendai Biti, was due at U.N. 
headquarters in New York for a U.N. Security Council discus­sion Tuesday on the deterio­rating situation in Zimbabwe. 
Tsvangirai said Biti would ask the Security Council "first­ly to stop the violence, and to communicate to the regime in Harare that its actions are tantamount to crimes against humanity." Biti would also ask the U.N. to send a special envoy to investigate the vio­lence and recommend a way to resolve it. 
On Monday, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission failed to publish the results of the recount of 23 disputed parlia­mentary seats from the elec­tions, as had been scheduled. 
Officials announced Saturday that recounts of 18 of 23 dis­puted parliamentary seats left initial results unchanged -­enough to confirm opposition's

Family and friends had urged Dale and Leilani Neumann to get help for their daughter, but the fatlwr considered the illness "a test of faith" and the mother never eonsidered taking the girl to the doctor because she thought her daughter was under a "spiri­tual attack," the criminal com­plaint said.

Madeline Neumann died March 23 -Easter Sunday -at her family's rural Weston home. tier parnnL'i were told the body would be taken to Madison !or an autop­sy the next day. 
"They responded, 'You won't need to do that. She will be alive by then,"' the rnedieal examiner wrot1~ in a report. 
An autopsy determined that Madnlinc dind from undiagnosnd diabetic ketoacidosis, whieh left her with too little insulin in her body. Court rneords said she like­ly had sonw symptoms of the dis­nase li1r months. 
The Neurnanns nach face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. The couple and their attorney did not immediately return messages left Monday by The Associated Press. 
Falstad said the Neumanns have eooperated with investiga­tors and arc not under arrest. They have agreed to make an ini­tial court appearance Wednesday, she said. 
Handall Wormgoor, a friend of the Neumanns, told police that Dale Neumann led Bible studies at his business, Monkey Mo Com~e Shop, and believed physi­eal illness wa..<; due to sin, curable 
· by prayer and by asking for for­
 hriveness from God, the complaint said. Wormgoor said he and his wife. Althea, were at the Neumann home when Madeline -called Kara by her parents -died. Wormgoor said he had urged the father to seek medieal help and was told the illness "was a test of faith for the Neumann family and asked the Wormgoors to join them in praying for Kara to get well," the complaint said. Althea Wormgoor said she "implored" the parents to seek medical help for the girl, the com­plaint said. 
Leilani Neumann, 40, told the AP previously she never expected her daughter to die. The family believes in the Bible, which says healing comes from God, but they have nothing against doctors, she said. 
Dale Neumann, 46, a former police of!iccr, has said he has friends who are doctors and started CPH "as soon as the breath of life left" his daughter's body. 
According to court documents, Leilani Neumann said in a writ­ten statement to police that she never considered taking the girl, who was being home-schooled, to a doctor. 
"We just thought it was a spiri­tual attack and we prayed for her. My husband Dale was crying and mentioned taking Kara to the doctor and I said, 'The Lord's going to heal her,' and we contin­ued to pray," she wrote. 
The father told investigators he noticed his daughter was weak and slower for about two weeks but he attribut~d it to symptoms of the girl reaehing puberty, the complaint said. 
A day before Madeline died, according to the criminal com­plaint, the father wrote an e-mail with the headline, "Help our daughter needs emergency prayer!!!!." It said his daughter was "very weak and pale at the moment with hardly any strength." 
The girl's grandmother, Evalani Gordon, told police that she learned her granddaughter could not walk or talk on March 22 and advised Leilani Neumann to take the girl to a doctor.

GAZA STRIP 
Israeli tank shell kills 5 civilians 
Associated Press 
GAZA CITY -An explo­
sion shattered a tiny Gaza 
Strip house as Israeli troops 
battled militants Monday, 
killing a Palestinian woman 
and four of her children in 
new bloodshed that threat­
ened efforts to arrange a 
truce between the warring 
sides. 

Palestinians said the 
house was hit by an Israeli 
tank shell; Israel said 
explosives being carried by 
militants blew up and 
brought down the two-room 
structure. 

Miyasar Abu Meatak was 
preparing breakfast for her 
children in the northern 
Gaza town of Bcit Hanoun 
when an explosion ripped 
through the home, her step­
son Ibrahim said. Four of 
her children, ages 15 
months to 6 years, were 
killed instantly, and she 
died shortly afterward at a 
hospital, Palestinian offi­
cials said. Her two older 
children were reported crit­
ically wounded. 
"What a black day. They 
killed my family," the grief­
stricken father, Ahmad Abu 
Meatak, wailed outside the 
hospital. Abu Meatak said 
he was on his way to a 
nearby market when the 
house blew up. 
The force of the blast 
scattered clothes and other 
household items outside the 
wrecked home. A single 
white child's shoe, flattened 
by the explosion, lay near a 
pair of blue shorts covered 
in sand. A green baby seat, 
one end bent, stood empty. 
Omar Abdel Nabi, a farmer in a large crowd watching workers clean up debris and bloodstained sand, said he was driving his tractor in a nearby field when two or three explo­sions shook the ground. 
"People were screaming that a tank shell landed in the next street," he told The Associated Press. "I carried two people covered in blood out of a house." 
Israel's military said its troops launched an opera­tion in the town after gun­men approached a border patrol. Palestinian Health Ministry official Moaiya Hassanain said two mili­tants and an unidentified men were also killed in the fighting. 
In a statement, the mili­tary said explosives carried by the militants were deto­nated by an Israeli airstrike, and the blast from the explosives hit the house, not a tank shell, "and uninvolved civilians were hit." Palestinians said the militants were at least 400 yards from the house and none of the fighters were killed near the struc­ture. 
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak put the blame on the Islamic militants of llamas, which has run Gaza since defeating the rival Fatah movement in a five­day battle last June. Barak said Israel would continue to operate in the volatile coastal territory. 
"We see llamas as 
responsible for everything 
that happens there, for all 
injuries," Barak said during 
a tour of an Israeli weapons 
factory. "llamas is also 
responsible, by operating 
within the civilian popula­
tion, for some of the civilian 
casualties." 
During fighting April 16, 
a Reuters TV cameraman 
was killed by an Israeli 
tank shell in central Gaza. 
At least 18 rockets and 
dozens of mortar shells 
were fired at Israel from 
Gaza on Monday, the Israeli 
military said. No one was 
seriously hurt. Palestinian 
militants frequently launch 
rockets from Beit Hanoun. 
In recent weeks, militants 
have also tried to infiltrate 
into Israel at least four 
times. 
Monday's violence was a 
blow to Egyptian efforts to 
mediate a truce between 
Israel and Gaza militants. 
Ismail llaniyeh, Gaza's 
Barnas prime minister, 
accused Israel of trying "to 
ruin any regional and inter­
national efforts to end the 
siege and halt aggression." 
Last week, Hamas said it 
would accept a six-month 
cease-fire with Israel, pro­
vided Israel ended the eco­
nomic blockade it imposed 
on Gaza after the Barnas 
takeover. The blockade has 
caused shortages of fuel, 
cement and other basic 
items in the impoverished 
territory. 
Israel dismissed the truce offer, saying Hamas would use the lull to rearm after sustaining heavy losses in recent fighting. But Israel said it would hold its fire if llamas and smaller Gaza militant groups halted their attacks. 
While battling llamas in Gaza, Israel has been con­ducting peace talks with the rival Palestinian govern­ment of President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank. 
Abbas condemned the new Gaza fighting, saying it would make peace negotia­tions with Israel even more difficult. "We emphasize the need to achieve calm and keep our people away from the agony of war and destruction," he said. 
The sides hope to reach a peace deal by the end of the year, though Abbas acknowledged after a trip to the White House last week that he was growing pessimistic because of the lack of progress in talks. 
In the West Bank on Monday, a Palestinian mili­tary court ordered the exe­cution of a man convicted of collaborating with Israel. 
Judges said the man, a Palestinian security ofl'icer, provided information that helped Israeli forces kill four Palestinian militants. Abbas must approve death sentences, though often they are commuted. 
The last execution was in 2001. Suspected collabora­tors are often killed vigi­lante-style before they can be arrested and tried.

Colbert? Really? 
I don't remember who spoke at my graduation. It's not that he/she was so forgettable, though I'm sure he/she was. I didn't go. I do remember, though, the previous year, when the graduating class president 
sniffed publicly that the speaker was good enough for Purdue maybe, but not Notre Dame. How she endeared herself to all Indiana! 
Anyway, I don't 


remember any Greg Yatarola 
administrators ask­
ing us seniors 

Dome and
whom we wanted 

Domer
to hear, and if they had, I hope they wouldn't have listened, for I'm sure that whoever did speak that day was less of an embarrassment to ND than our pick would have been. 
Nonetheless, I understand seniors' frustration with this year's speaker. One doesn't become a cardinal archbishop by saying anything interesting. I imag­ine he'll talk a bit about following Jesus, but it's doubtful at best that he'll make such following seem noble or somehow attractive, or that he'll discuss clearly what the stakes are. No, this won't be Patton, or Kierkegaard, or Alyosha's speech by the stone. But I hope I'm wrong. 
What I do not understand, though, is how seniors can complain that the administration didn't consider their input, given that their pick was Stephen Colbert. I'm more worried that the administration actually did consider it. They're giving the Laetare award to someone who played pretend for a liv­ing, so why not invite an obnoxious pre­tend journalist to address the seniors? What I hope happened instead is that whichever official saw Colbert at the top of the list just blurted out "[expletive] grow up" and hit delete. 
I don't dislike Stephen Colbert, or think he'd disgrace NO by speaking at graduation, because of his show's 
THE WITTIEST STEIN 
rather un-Catholic content. It's sad to see a man his age amuse teenagers with jokes about selling his own semen, but oh well. Nor is it because I can't identify a single accomplishment of his that would make him worthy of being at all honored by the University of Notre Dame. It's not even that Colbert, like his mentor Jon Stewart, is a small, weasely man, a dishonest cheap-shot artist, a bigot with all the acceptable bigotries who can only counter ideas he doesn't like by caricature. I highly doubt they'd practice their routine casual smearing if we had the right kinds of laws in this country, allowing dueling. I stopped watching Colbert when he described the pope in passing as a former Nazi. It's not just that his target was the pope. He and Stewart do it all the time. Just recently, after his man-crush the Obamessiah came under fire for his delightful "bitter" remarks (delivered to affluent San Francisco donors --per­fect!), Stewart went to bat for him. Obama was wrong in saying that slack­jawed rural whites turn to religion, guns, and racism because of economic hardship --no, according to Stewart, small-town white America is built on such backwardness. Don't hold your breath waiting for him to give such can­did analysis of some of Obama's con­stituencies -say, Chardonnay-sipping hot-tub liberals in Marin County. 
No, what disappoints me about this year's pick is how unimaginative it was. I bet the couch-burners up in East Lansing picked Colbert too, or would have. Why not just pick Flavor Flav? I'm sure an interpreter could be provid­ed. 
Notre Dame's student body is often criticized for conformity, and usually in terms of its Catholicity. I saw plenty of conformism at Notre Dame, but it was­n't to the teachings of the Church. It was to our culture. As I tried to state in a previous article, I knew as many girls actually on birth-control as dead-set against it. I knew far more people who watched "Seinfeld" religiously than who said the rosary. The music I heard at

parties was whatever awful noise was popular at the time. not the quirky unknown stuff college kids traditionally take pride in liking. Nobody I knew went to see independent movies, but blockbusters were a staple. Several kids I knew could recite every line of "Austin Powers". Girls on the treadmills read "Cosmo". My classmates, by and large, had no problem adopting a critical atti­tude toward the authority of the Church, often with the help of their thn­ology professors. But rarely did I see such critical distance maintained toward the multiform stupidities of our popular culture. Slander Jennnifer Lopez, and you'd start a fight; my theol­ogy professor called St. Paul "evil," and nobody batted an eyelash. 
Of course, it's better to have low-brow tastes in music, movies, TV, magazines, etc. than to be pretentious and elitist. But that's the thing -Notre Dame too often combined the worst of both, devo­tion to "The Heal World" or "Sex & the City" with looking down at state-school kids, believing themselves so difl'erent from· the collegiate hoi polloi. You're not that difl'erent. You greet strangers sometimes on the way to class? Great, but do you think they just hiss and spit at each other at Penn State or LSU? And kids at Cornell do lots of service too. You're maybe smarter than the kids at Kentucky, and you've spent four years studying timeless works of tower­ing genius (hopefully). But then you want a comedian at your graduation? 
I'm not trying to scold anyone. Just please don't go out into the world with a sense of superiority. We Domers already have a bad reputation for that. If we're really that much better, let's show it. 
Greg Yatarola is a 1999 alumnus. He hopes it's clear to all now why he asked to write under a pseudonym this year. He fears his class would have picked Jerry Seinfeld as graduation speaker. His address is gregpy@hotmail. com

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Economics at Notre Dame, an open letter 
As members of the University of Notre Dame, we have a special obligation to engage our learning, our teaching, and our world with integrity. Additionally, students deserve an education that explores the "full range of ideas." Therefore, the University, if it hopes to fulfill its mission, must teach its students to think critically and provide opportuni­ties for students to intellectually engage their discipline. It is our contention that the current situation of economics at Notre Dame often stifles debate, impedes student learning, and undermines the Catholic character of our University. 
At Notre Dame, economics is divided into two separate departments: "The Department of Economics and Econometrics, which is a: neoclassical economics department committed to r-ig­orous theoretical and quantitative analy­sis in teaching and research," and The Department of Economics and Policy studies, which is committed to "issues relating to socioeconomic justice and ethics," "openness to alternative methodological approaches," and the "roles of history and institutions" in the "broader political economy" It is our fear that. in pursuit of higher depart­ment rankings, Notre Dame will sacrifice the latter department in favor of the for­mer. 
In other words, we oppose a situation in which neoclassical economic theory is taught to the exclusion of other theories. This tendency is already apparent in the one-sidedness of economics majors at our University. The required courses ­introductory/intermediate microeconom­ics and macroeconomics, statistics, and econometrics -are all typically taught using only mainstream theory. It is alarming that a student could easily graduate from Notre Dame with a degree in Economics, having never ques­tioned the basic assumptions of or been presented with plausible alternatives to neoclassical economics. 
Neoclassical economic theory, because of its dominance in the academy, has become widely known as "mainstream" economics. Currently, introductory and intermediate micro and macro theory courses teach mainstream economics from an a historical perspective. These courses foster a narrow and incomplete view of economics, because they exclude teaching about the social and historical forces that shape economic theory and avoid sincerely questioning the underly­ing assumptions vital to the models. Furthermore, most professors present only neoclassical models to their stu­dents. This exclusive presentation implies that neoclassical theory itself is "economics." This system of education, insulated from critical dissent, produces the next generation of economists with a fixed toolkit of models and prescriptions that assume an unchanging economic reality. As a result, students fail to con­textualize neoclassical theory in the broader discourse of the social sciences.

In addition, mainstream economics is often presented as analogous to a natu­ral science, such that economic laws are attributed the same character of univer­sality as the laws of physics. As such, many faculty members teach main­stream neoclassical theory as a series of straight-forward mathematical concepts. This causes students to believe that eco­nomics is merely a matter of fine-tuning a particular model and thus void of ethi­cal implications. Many faculty promote this inaccurate notion in their courses by arguing that mainstream economics fur­thers a "positive analysis" of the world, a value-neutral agenda of "efficiency" in the process of allocating scarce resources. They argue that their eco­nomic models do not contain or render value judgments. However, this perspec­tive ignores the reality that neoclassical theory's starting assumptions and sup­porting logic carry an embedded ethics and have serious social implications. This misrepresentation of a value-laden theory seriously misleads students and inhibits their ability to morally engage current trends. Today's simultaneously increasing wealth and growing inequali­ty affirm a desperate need for models critical of the mainstream. 
To prevent this tendency toward a one­sided education, some economics stu­dents take courses where heterodox the­ories are introduced. These students are empowered to think about and critically engage both neoclassical models and alternative approaches. Unfortunately, the number of these courses at Notre Dame has dwindled in recent years. The deeper understanding afforded by these courses reveals that the current stunted education in economics is one of mostly memorization and unchallenging accept­ance rather than a critical examination of assumptions, logic, and implications. With a more sophisticated teaching of economics, which includes a plurality of ideas, students better learn mainstream neoclassical theory and, in the process, are exposed to a variety of instructive alternatives. 
As firm believers in the mission of the University and our ability to fulfill it, we hope that this letter begins a dialogue for change. The University of Notre Dame should reconsider its current teaching of economics, affirm the cours­es that currently offer heterodox approaches, and create more opportuni­ties for challenging intellectual engage­ment ifit hopes to provide its students with the truly premiere education it espouses.

And once we see her dating smoothie maker Rob (Greg Kinnear). she seems so normal. confident and unflawed that we can't understand why her past relationships failed, leaving her single today. 
"Baby Mama" is McCullers' directorial debut, and it quickly becomes clear that with faster pacing (and a better editor). he could have made a better and funnier film. But "Baby Mama" drags, partkular­ly in the beginning. and the humor does­n't come as sharply and quickly as Fey and Poehler arc capable of. 
But even with all its flaws. "Baby Mama" still has its charms. As Kate's boss. Steve Martin steals scene after scene. His haircut alone is a visual gag that makes us laugh as soon as he appears on screen. "SNL" fans will get a treat with cameos from east members Will Forte and Fred Armisen (watch out for Forte's killer mustache). The friend­ship between doorman Oscar (Romany Malco) and baby mama Angie is sweet (yet unexplored), and Dax Shepard even has his moments to shine as Angie's white trash boyfriend. 
In the end, "Baby Mama" is worth see­ing for its truly hilarious moments. But it's unfortunate that poor direeting gets in the way of Fey and Poehler producing comedy gold. The two do not fail as actresses or eomedians; they only fail in their choice of project.

"Down This Road" drew interest from Nashville critics for the couple's dircet and soulful lyrics as well as for their dose harmonizations. The lyrics on songs like "Down this Road" and "On the Hocks" displayed an honesty only achieved when the lyricists are in fact partners in love. 
Whether it was the lack of over-atl'ected eountry accents or amped-up guitar rifl's, "Down This Hoad" failed to attract the broad country audience it deserved.

CLUB SPORTS 

Men's, women's ultimate fall short of title bids 
Special to The Observer 
Ultimate 
Notre Dame competed in the Great Lakes Hegional, part of the UPA College Series, this weekend in Hartland, Mich. Both the men's and women's squads were playing for a spot in the National Championships, which will be held in Boulder, Colo. 
Notre Dame's women's team opened with two pool games Saturday. Its first game was against rival North Park, who they had seen multiple times throughout the season. The women got tlw job done early and coasted to a 17-6 victory under the leadflrship of captains Shannon Morrison and Loretta Brown. Thn Irish dropped the second game 13-11 to the University of Chicago. 
Notre Dame headed into bracket play looking for a spot at Nationals. Notrfl Dame ddnated Indiana 15-5 to elose out the day on Saturday. 
On Sunday. Notre Dame had to win four games in a row to earn a spot at Nationals. Notre Dame used fresh legs to outrun Loyola to eome out on top 15-6 in the first game. The team's next game was against a Michigan State team who had previously rolled over Notre Damn 13-1 earlier in the sea­sorl. The Irish eame out with inl!msity and fire but were no match for Michigan Statfl's spend and backhand breaks, falling 15-4 in the final contest of the season. 

Men's play was double elimi­nation in a sixteen-team field. Notre Dame beat Oberlin 15-11 in the first game. The next opponent was Dayton, who had pulled off an upset in the first round. Next, Notre Dame took care of Dayton with a 15-6 vic­tory. 
This set up an anticipated match up between Notre Dame and Illinois in the semifinals. After not seeing each other at the sectional tournament, each team was anxious to get a chance to test its merit against the other. The game went back and forth early on with both teams essentially trading points until half. After halftime, Illinois came out firing and capitalized on some costly Notre Dame mis­takes. Illinois pull ahead and led 12-7 before the Irish fought their way back into the game. Despite amazing defense from junior Danny Collom, Notre Dame fell short, 15-13. 
On Sunday, Notre Dame drew Miami (Ohio). Miami gave Notre Dame problems early on. The first half only involved one break from each team and Miami took the halftime lead, 8­
7. Notre Dame came out fired up in the second half. Thanks to some fine throws from senior Erie Morin, Notre Dame pulled away and eventually won, 15­10. 
Notre Dame dropped its final game to Ohio State by a score of 15-12. 
The club finished one of the most successful years in recent men's play, with a 41-9 record. The Irish women's season was equally successful. Two tourna­ment victories, including Sectionals, were among the highlights. 
Men's Rowing 
The oarsmen of Notre Dame traveled to Eagle Creek for the perennial Indianapolis Invite, a regatta drawing the best crews of the Midwest. Arriving late Friday afternoon in preparation for Saturday's morning races, windy conditions that swamped three other crews prevented the Irish from getting in a light row before race day. Fortunately, however, the conditions improved, albeit slightly, afford­ing the Irish an opportunity to row for coveted shirts and medals. 
The story of the first day was the Notre Dame first novice 8­plus boat. The crew was the top seed entering the day's racing and confirmed its status with the best morning row, setting the stage for the highly-contest­ed final that was to follow in the afternoon. After a countdown start at 1:30, the Irish asserted their dominance, establishing an early lead, and holding off Marietta during the last 500 meters for what appeared to be the Novice crown. However, after lengthy deliberation stem­ming from post-race protests, the officials deemed the race void and mandated a re-row. The unusual re-row resulted from two separate instances of poor steering on the part of competing crews during the race, neither of which involved Notre Dame. Yet, after a poll of the coaches involved, a majority cast for a re-row that sent all six crews back on the water at 3:30, making it the final race of the day. The Irish found them­selves sitting in fifth place off the start and had only reclaimed fourth place at the 1000-meter mark. The Irish ral­lied in the final 1000 meters, with a sprint in the final 250 that had the crowd on its feet. But the Irish came up short, los­ing to Purdue by nine-tenths of a second with a second place time of 6:29.6. 
Sailing 

Having already earlier quali­fied entries in both the team and fleet racing at the Intercollegiate championships in Newport, R.I., Notre Dame was unable to qualify for the third event, eo-ed racing. The dub did earn a berth in the pre­nationals, which were hostfld by USC in Los Angeles this week­end. Georgetown, Yale, College of Charleston, and MIT finished in the top four spots. 
Rugby 

Notre Dame dropped a 56-24 game at Bowling Green over the weekend to conclude its season. Bowling Green played in the Nationals last year, and was ranked No. 5 just two weeks ago. The Falcons' coach retired after the game, which made for an emotionally inspired oppo­nent. 
Don Greiwe intercepted a pass and scored the game's first try and conversion in the opening two minutes to give the Irish a 7-0 lead. Bowling Green scored two minutes later on an advan­tage call following an Irish off­side. The Falcons then rolled to a 42-7 lead at the half. The Irish next scored as they mauled into the try zone off a Iineout as David Bray scored. Three min­utes later, Andy Mullen scored yet another try. Kevin Hitt added the final score of the day for the Irish A-side squad. 
The B-side fared no better, dropping a 65-7 game. Andy Mullen scored the only Irish try and Don Greiwe added the con­version. The Irish measured themselves against one of the nation's strongest teams and displayed promise for the future. 
Fishing 

Largemouth bass provided the competition for the fishing club this weekend in Chelsea, Mich. The dub arrived Friday evening and immediately start11d catch­ing fish. Using a "t<iuehdown worm" from their canoes, the anglers caught many big fish. highlighted by Brian Kirkendall's seven-pound bass.

Associated Press 

MIAMI -On the night of his last game as an NBA head coach, Pat Riley heard the final buzzer, looked straight ahead and briskly walked away. 
Deep down, he knew it was over. 
"I didn't have to look back," Riley said. "I know that's behind me." 
And now, after spending several days plotting the Miami Heat's next course, Riley's past becomes Erik Spoelstra's future. 
The Hall of Fame coach resigned Monday, although he'll remain team president. His first act as Miami's for­mer coach was to choose i1s new one, and hired Spoelstra, a 37 -year-old who started in the Heat video room in 1995 and now becomes the NBA's youngest coach. 
Riley sees himself in Spoelstra. 
Riley was 36 when he first became a head coach, and didn't have any experience either. His first off-the-court job in the NBA was traveling secretary for the Los Angeles Lakers, handling boarding passes. Spoelstra also was at the bottom of the Heat totem pole when starting out, mak­ing videos for the team Orristmas party, but Riley is convinced he's ready for the top job. 
"It's very rare to have the opportunity to work for one organization for your entire career like I have," said Spoelstra, who was told the job was his Friday. "It means it's a special organization." 
Miami finished with the NBA's poorest record (15­67), by far the worst of Riley's career. As president, Riley will continue oversee­ing the plan to revamp a franchise just two years removed from a champi­onship, after deciding he'd best benefit the franchise from the front office. 
Last year, Riley said he was committed to coaching three more seasons. Monday, he admitted he never believed that to be true. 
"I am definitely sure that I don't want to do this any­more," Riley said. 
Riley's future was among Miami's many offseason issues. The Heat could have the No. 1 pick in the draft, are assured a top-four pick and are certain to make moves in an effort to revamp a roster plagued by injuries. 
"Pat Riley has instilled in me values that enabled me to win a championship in just three seasons," Heat guard Dwyane Wade said Monday. "''ve seen him do the necessary things to make us winners and I believe that with his focus on being pres­ident and his commitment to the team, we will once again become a contender." 

IN BRIEF Major changes to BCS not 
likely 

HOLLYWOOD, Fla. -As they kicked off three days of meetings at an oceanfront resort, the Bowl Championship Series overseers appear to have a better chance of getting a sunburn than making any major changes in the controversial system. 
"I continue to sense a certain comfort level, if you will, with the current status of things with the BCS," BCS coordinator John Swofford said after Monday's ses­sion. "I think it's been a pretty sta­ble few years." 
Still, the commissioners of the 11 major college football conferences, along with Notre Dame athletic director Kevin White, will have their most detailed discussions to date of the plus-one model, which could use two bowls as semifinals and another as a national title game, with the four participants seeded. 
Lieberthal to retire in June 
with Phillies 
PHILADELPHIA -Two-time All­Star catcher Mike Lieberthal will retire with the Phillies on June 1, ending his career with the franchise where he played 13 of his 14 major league sea­sons. 
Lieberthal, the third overall pick in the 1990 draft, hasn't played this sea­son and spent last year with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
"Philadelphia has always been a sec­ond home to me, so I'm really looking 
· forward to this," Lieberthal said on Monday. "I spent half my life there and still follow the team closely on televi­sion." Lieberthal hit .275 with 150 home runs and 609 RBis in 1,17 4 games with the Phillies. He batted .234 with one RBI in 38 games with the Dodgers. Lieberthal was the sixth catcher in major league history to hit .300 with 30 home runs in a season when he reached those marks in 1999. 
Posada placed on DL for 
first time in career 
CLEVELAND -The New York Yankees took the field Monday miss­ing a familiar face: Jorge Posada, the club's proud catcher and one of its leaders, was in Alabama getting his injured right shoulder examined. 
Posada was placed on the 15-day disabled list for the first time in his career, ending a remarkable run of durability at baseball's most physi­cally demanding position. The 36­year-old, who has caught at least 137 games in each of the past eight seasons, finally succumbed to pain in his shoulder that he had been feeling for most of the season's first month. 
"It's kind of strange to go into the clubhouse and you don't see him," said Yankees manager Joe Girardi, who helped teach Posada in the 1990s. "He's a quiet leader. He's a constant in the clubhouse, you like to see guys like that."

Mussina (3-3) allowed two runs and seven hits in five innings, just enough to eatch Hubbell for 41st place. The 39-year-old had his second consecutivn solid outing after 
there  was  speculation  he  
might lose  his spot in the  
rotation.  

Mussina was followed by Jonathan 1\lbaladejo, Kyle Farnsworth, Joba Cham­berlain and Mariano Hivera, who worked the ninth for his eighth save in eight tries. New York's bullpen held the Indians to one hit over the final four innings. 
llideki Matsui had two HB!s for the Yankees, held without a hit for five innings by Aaron Laffoy (0-1), making his sea­son debut. 
But in the sixth, New York strung together four hits ­throe didn't leave the infield -two groundouts and a hit batter to score four times and tako a 4-2 lead. Matsui's RBI double in the eighth made it 5-2. 
"Sometimes it's not how you hit them, it's where you hit thorn," New York manager Joe Girardi said. 
It wasn't pretty, but the Yankees will takn it on a day when they had to place durable cateher Jorge Posada on the disabled list for the first time in his career. The :{6-year-old has been both­ored by a shoulder problem for weeks. lie left the team to have his shoulder examined by famnd orthopedic surgeon Dr. .James Andrews in Birmingham, /\Ia. 
Tho Yankees are still await­ing test results on Posada, who playnd in at least 137 games in each of the past night seasons. Girardi is try­ing to stay optimistic he'll get baek his catcher, who signed 
a four-year, $52.4 million 
contract before the season. 
"I have my fingers crossed," 
Girardi said. 
He's also going to keep a elose eye on Alex Rodriguez, who played the entire series but is still slowed by a strained right quadriceps. Rodriguez was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the eighth inning, and Girardi said he'll likely sit his All-Star third baseman on Tuesday against Detroit. 
"lie's not 100 percent and 
we felt it was best to get him 
out of there," Girardi said. 
"lie gave us four games and 
kind of sucked it up for us." 
Rodriguez said he felt a 
"pull" while running the 
bases. 
"It's hard for me not to play 100 percent," Hodriguez said. "Thn key for me is to get healthy." 
Laffey had never faced the Yankees, but he didn't look seared of their big names or big salaries.

Laffey retired 14 straight before hitting Hobinson Cano in the ribs with a pitch in the fifth. 
With Hall of' Farner Bob Feller, who no-hit the Yankees 62 years ago this week, watching from the press box, Laffey took a no­hitter into the sixth before New York manufactured a scoring rally that hardly befit their Bronx Bombing image. 
Melky Cabrera hit an infield single and Jeter was safe on a bad-hop roller to third. Abreu's single loaded the bases and Laffey got ahead of Hodriguez 1-2 before hitting him on the left leg to force in

Postseason hopes in NCAA's hands 
By ALEX BARKER 
Sports Writer 
The season hangs in the 
balance for Saint Mary's 
until May 5 when an NCAA 
selection committee will 
determine the fate of the 
Belles' post-season lives. 
The Belles finished as the 
runner-up in the MIAA con­
ference tournament, placing 
them into a group of teams 
vying to receive an at-large 
bid into the NCAA national 
championship May 13-16 at 
the Centennial Oaks Golf ·Club in Waverly, Iowa. 
There are a total of three 
spots open for at-large 
teams who did not receive 
their conference's automatic 
bid. 
Belles coach Mark 
Hamilton said he likes his 
team's chances of receiving 
one of those spots. 
"The first two spots are 
pretty much wrapped up by 
higher-ranked teams that 
failed to win their confer­
ences," Hamilton said. "But 
with our recent performanc­
es against higher-ranked 
opponents, I think we have a very good chance of captur­ing the final spot." 
One of the Belles' best per­formances of the season came in the MIAA tourna­ment last weekend. 
After the first round of play, the Belles found them­selves down 18 strokes to No. 10 Olivet. 
However, in the final two rounds, Saint Mary's showed great improvement by shoot­ing the lowest score of each round. 
"It was a pretty gutty per­formance by our team, but the first-round deficit proved to be too great," Hamilton said. "We beat the No. 10 team on its own course and that is a pretty big feat." 
If the Belles are fortunate enough to receive an at­large bid into the national championship tournament, they will certainly have their work cut out for them. However, they have beaten many higher-ranked teams already this season and will not hold anything back in trying to do it one last time.

NHL 
Flyers take 2-1 series lead from Canadiens in Philly 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Derian Hatcher wq.s like all the other Flyers fans who watched the last 15 minutes on TV. He did it in the locker room, feeling sick, stressed and helpless as the lead nearly slipped away. 
Unlike the other orange-clad diehards, Hatcher could have prevented the frayed nerves Monday night. 
When Philadelphia held on for the victory, Hatcher could thank Martin Biron that the defense­man's late ejection didn't cost them the series lead. 
Biron stopped 32 shots and the Flyers scored three goals in the second period to beat the Montreal Canadiens 3-2, taking a 2-1lead in their second-round series. 
"Marty has been terrific. He's been our best player in this series," coach John Stevens said. "We probably felt going in that he would have to be." 
Biron lost his shutout -and the Flyers nearly wasted a three-goal lead -when Hatcher was ejected in the third period and Montreal capitalized on the lengthy power play. 
Hatcher drove his right arm into the center of defenseman Francis Bouillon's back and slammed him into the glass. Bouillon, who wears a visor, was cut near the corner of his right eye. 
Hatcher was whistled for 5 minutes for boarding and a game misconduct, ending his night. That was all the opportu­nity Montreal needed to make its first serious run at Biron. It was nearly enough to tie the score. 
"Your first reaction is you just hope the team can get through it," Hatcher said. 
Tomas Plekanec quickly scored a power-play goal off a serum in front of the net to make it 3-1. The goal was reviewed, but the replay showed the puck was over the line before the net became dis­lodged. 
Saku Koivu was stopped on a breakaway by Biron's poke check in the first period, but he scored on the power play in the third to pull Montreal to 3-2. 
"It got a little scary on the power play," Biron said. 
Hatcher felt awful. 
"Watching the last 15 minutes was a lot more draining than actually playing the game," Hatcher said. "I feel mentally exhausted right now." 
The Flyers killed the rest of the penalty and Biron quickly reverted to the form of the first two periods, when he stopped shots in all kinds of ways. He made 17 of his saves in the third period while the Flyers took a measly two shots on goal. 
No wonder he was serenaded again from the stands: "Mar-ty! "Mar-ty!" "Mar-ty!" 
That's a sound the Flyers want to hear all the way to the Stanley Cup. 
"It's fun when they chant your name," Biron said. "They chal­lenge the guys to play better." 
The Canadiens outshot Philadelphia 34-12. 
"It seems that we're being tested right now," Koivu said. "I don't think we played as well tonight as we did in the second game, but still we were able to put a lot of pucks on net and create a lot of chances. That's a positive thing, but at the same time when you outshoot your opponent, you're hoping to get the win." 
Mike Richards, R.J. Umberger and Scottie Upshall all scored goals on the first six shots of the second against 20-year-old Carey Price. 
Price never made it to the end, yanked at the start of the third period for Jaroslav Halak. Price will get another shot in Game 4 on Wednesday in Philadelphia. 
"Cary has proven in the past that he can bounce back and come back really strong," said Montreal coach Guy Carbonneau. "I know he can come back and play really strong." 
After a scoreless first period, the Flyers made the most of their limited shots in the second. 
Upshall fired a wrister past Price 7:04 into the period and another sold-out crowd roared in approval. One fan pressed a sign that read "The Price Is Wrong" against the glass. 
Richards made it 2-0 when his short-handed goal bounced off Price's glove. Lasse Kukkonen was in the penalty box for hold­ing the stick, putting the Flyers a man down. Who else but Richards would give them a lift? He scored five short-handed goals in the regular season, which led the Flyers and was tied for third in the NHL. Richards picked off the puck to score the unassisted goal. 
Then the Flyers got what turned out to be a needed goal.

Relationship could hurt Clemens' rep 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Roger Clemens had a decade-long relationship with country star Mindy McCready that began when she was a 15-year-old aspiring singer and the pitcher was a Boston Red Sox ace, the Daily News reported. 
Clemens' lawyer, Rusty Hardin, confirmed a long-term relationship but told the news­paper it was not sexual. 
"Mindy McCready is a long­time family friend of Roger Clemens and the Clemens fami­ly," Hardin said in a statement Monday. "At no time did Roger engage in any kind of inappro­priate or improper relationship with her. It is unfortunate that the Daily News has chosen to report anonymous allegations that are completely unfounded, have no basis in fact, and have nothing to do with Roger's base­ball career or the issue of steroid use in baseball." 
The story, which appeared on the newspaper's Web site Sunday night and in editions Monday, quoted several people who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. 
McCready's lawyer, Lee Ofman, said he did not have any comment on the Daily News story. 
Clemens was 28 and a mar­ried father of two when he first met McCready, the newspaper reported. 
The story could undermine Clemens' reputation, which is central to the defamation suit the former pitcher has filed against former personal trainer Brian McNamee. McNamee con­tends Clemens used perform­ance-enhancing substances dur­ing his major league career. 
"If true, it's just another exam­ple of Roger's pervasive prevari­cations which will be at the core of any defamation case," said McNamee's attorney, Richard Emery, in an e-mail to The Associated Press. 
The newspaper said Clemens sent cash to McCready to help her with legal issues and reached out to her when she was in jail last year in Tennessee. 

The 32-year-old McCready was sentenced last September for violating probation from a 2004 drug arrest and was released from jail last Dec. 30. The violation occurred in July when McCready was accused of scuffling with her mother and resisting arrest at her mother's home in Fort Myers, Fla. She still must serve two years' pro­bation. 

NBA 
Turkoglu nallled lllost illlproved 
Associated Press 
ORLANDO, Fla. -Hedo Turkoglu, whose 19 points, five rebounds and five assists per game helped the Orlando Magic win their first division title in 12 years, was selected as the NBA's most improved player Monday. 
Turkoglu's numbers marked career highs in each category, and dramatic improvements from 13 points, four rebounds and three assists last season. He earned back-to-hack Eastern Conference player of the week awards in late January and early February and was named player of the month for April. 
This was the type of season the Magic always expected from the 6-foot-1 0 forward, now in his eighth year. 
"Without him, I don't know where we would be," Magic general manager Otis Smith said. "I am happy to have him on our team and I'm happy that he is winning this award eight years late, but I am happy that he is at least win­ning this award. This is a sign of things to come for Turk." 
Turkoglu received 61 first­place votes and 380 points in the voting by a panel of American and Canadian sports journalists, well ahead of Memphis Grizzlies forward Rudy Gay, who earned i67 points, 23 for first-place, and the Portland Trailblazers' LaMarcus Aldridge with 128 points and nine first-place votes. 
Turkoglu was the fourth Magic player to win the award, handed out since the 1985-86 season. 

most prolific 3-point season in NBA history. The Magic made 9. 77 a game, behind only the Phoenix Suns' 10.21 a game in 2005-06. He also started all 82 regular-season games for the first time in his career. 
"I guess this year was the time for me to step it up and come this far, so I am just blessed that I was healthy this year and all the things went well for me, having a good coach, my teammates, everybody," Turkoglu said. "If you look at it, it is not just my improvement, it is the Magic's improvement too, comparing to last year." 
Turkoglu had two triple­doubles this season, also the first of his career. But per­haps most importantly, the Turkish-born pro has been key in the clutch. He hit win­ners with the clock running down twice against Chicago on Dec. 31 and Boston on Jan. 27 -and drained the go-ahead free throws with 2.4 seconds left 
on  Feb.  1  against  
Philadelphia.  
Turkoglu also  made  an  

acrobatic layup in traffic with 30 seconds left in Game 2 against the Toronto Raptors, the go-ahead bucket. 
"He is as talented a basket­ball player I have seen at 6­foot-10 in a long time. You feel comfortable with the ball in his hands," Smith said. "He can make decisions for your teammates -he is always at the top every night (in assists), and you can't ask for a 6-foot-10 guy to do that. 
"He has been asked to do a lot this year, and he has responded well. He has had these abilities all along, he just had to be brought out of them, and now he is able to do it."

Giants send Zito to bullpen 
Struggling lefty was 0-6 with 7.53 ERA 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -Barry Zito was demoted to the bullpen Monday by the San Francisco Giants, who hope the former ace can correct his problems by working in relief. 
Zito, who only 16 months ago signed a $126 million, seven-year contract with the Giants to lead their rotation, was informed of the move in a meeting with manager Bruce Bochy. 
The left-bander has lost his first six starts this season and has a 7.53 ERA that jumped considerably after Zito was tagged for eight earned runs in a 10-1 loss Sunday to Cincinnati. 
The 2002 AL Cy Young Award winner with Oakland, Zito lasted just three innings against the Reds and was booed frequently by the crowd at AT&T Park during his shortest outing of the year. 
A three-time All-Star and 
San Francisco's opening-day starter this season, Zito is only the third pitcher since 1956 to go 0-6 before May, joining Texas' Dave Stewart (1984) and Detroit's Mike Maroth (2003). 
The durable Zito has made 24 7 consecutive starts with­out missing a turn due to injury, the longest streak in the majors. He made his only big league relief appearance last season. 
Zito's next turn in the Giants' rotation would have been Saturday in Philadelphia.

Johnson scores 35, Hawks surprise Celtics again 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Forget about a Boston sweep. The Hawks are headed back to Beantown all tied up with the mighty Celtics. 
Joe Johnson scored 35 points -20 in the fourth quarter ­and Josh Smith added 28 points and seven blocks for Atlanta, which surprised the Celtics again 97-92 on Monday night to even the best-of-seven series at two games apiece. 
A Game 5 that many never expected to happen is now on, Wednesday night in Boston. 
The Hawks, who had the worst record (37-45) of any playon· team, overcame two dou­ble-digit deficits to beat a team that won an NBA-leading 66 games during the regular sea­son. 
The credit for this Atlanta stunner goes largely to Johnson, who took control in the final quarter. After Smith's jumper put the Hawks ahead to st~y 81­79, Johnson scornd nine straight points to keep the Celtics on the ropes. 
The knockout came when Paul Pierce drove to the hoop and left it short, then tumbled over a cameraman alongside the bas­ket. When the Boston star finally dimbed back to his li)et, he had a look of disbelief-which prel­ty much sums up the way the Celtics are feeling about this snries. 
Smith went to the other end and made two free throws with 26 seconds remaining for 93-87 load. Johnson -appropriately enough -fmished otr the Celtics by making two more foul shots with 14 seconds left. 

Ray Allen led Boston with 21 points, and Kevin Garnett added 20. 
Smith set an Atlanta playoff record with seven blocks, the last of them a key swat on Garnett after he backed down in the lane, looking for the easy shot, with just over 3 minutes left. 
"It's time to shock the world," the public address announcer screamed to the sellout crowd of 20,016. 
Al'tm getting blown out in the first two games, Atlanta turned feisty on its home court. Hookie AI llorford taunted Pierce after putting the Celtics away in Game :~. prompting the Boston forward to llash a menaeing gesture that drew a $25,000 fine from the NBA shortly before Game 4. 
Then, with 7? minutes left in the second quarter, things really got testy. Garnett threw an elbow at Zaza Pachulia while going for a loose ball. The rugged Pachulia got right in Garnett's face, going forehead to forehead with the Boston star. 
The officials stepped in quickly and llawks coach Mike Woodson charged onto the court to pull his players away. No punches were thrown and no one was ejected, though the officials did call offsetting technical fouls ­two on each team -after look­ing at a replay.

Magic make Raptors disappear in five games 
Howard leads Magic to second round with 21 points, 21 rebounds; earns his third 20-20 game in series 
Associated Press 
OHLANDO, Fla. -Orlando Magic coach Stan Van Gundy saw something different about Dwight Howard head­ing into the playoffs. 
The 22-year-old All-Star, usually the team's biggest joknster, suddenly got serious. So did his already-impressive numbers. 
Howard had 21 points, 21 n~bounds and three blocks ­his third 20-20 game in the series -and tlw Magie advanced to after the technical on Bosh put the Magic ahead 73-66 with just under a· minute left in the third quarter, and Orlando kept that cushion until midway through the fourth. Delfino hit a jumper and I3osh made two free throws in four trips to the line, plus a hook shot over Howard, to draw the Raptors within 84-82. 
The Magie, who shot the fourth-best percentage in the NBA from 3-point range this season, strug­gled again from long range (9-of­

seeond round 32). but made

92 in Game 5 layup as the on Monday Raptors center Magic answered 
night. 
"There was a different demeanor from him," Van Gundy said of his young cen­ter. "Dwight is a fun-loving guy and he likes to fool around. There are a lot of times during the year, not bad, but a lot of times during the year where I've got to try to bring him back to being serious when we're prepar­ing. 
"I did not have to say one word, from the start of prepa­ration for this series all the way through," Van Gundy said. 
Howard's game said it all. And with Orlando's usually steady 3-point shooting on the fritz, his inside power was enough to pull them through. 
"He's a phenom; he's the best center in the league," said Raptors star Chris Bosh, who was guarded by Howard all game. "He's probably the strongest guy in the league, and he knows how to use his body. It doesn't surprise me at all. I've seen him play this whole series, I've seen him play this season." 
Bosh, who posted career playoff highs of 39 points and 15 rebounds at Toronto on Saturday, had with an 8-0 run 
over 3:13 to 
open a 92-82 lead, then its largest of the game. 
It was enough room to let them coast. 
"We've depended on the 3 all year. It's going to make us or break us," Bogans said. "Coach just tells us to keep shooting them and don't stop." 
Nelson scored 19 points for Orlando and Rashard Lewis had 18 points and 13 rebounds. lledo Turkoglu just missed a triple-double with 12 points, eight rebounds and nine assists, while Maurice Evans scored 12 points and Bogans added 11. 
Orlando hadn't won a play­off series since 1996, when Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway led the team to the Eastern Conference finals. The Magic played 28 postsea­son games in the intervening years, winning only eight. 
Howard grinned broadly, still unable to believe it was true. 
"It's just an unbelievable feeling," he said. "We did something I feel that hasn't been done here in a while." 
Orlando looked

T.J. Ford and Carlos Delfino both scored 14 points for the Haptors, while Jason Kapono had 1:~ and Jose Calderon 12. Delfino added seven rebounds and Ford had five assists. 
"We knew in the regular season that every time we played the Orlando Magic that you've got to score, and we just couldn't scorn," Toronto roach Sam Mitchell said. "We didn't make enough shots."

Sports Writer 

Notre Dame's season took a stunning turn for the worse on Friday night after the Irish let an early 8-1 lead slip away into what became a 15-14 loss to Georgetown in triple overtime in the Big East conference semifi­nals. Irish players were visibly distraught after the gut-wreneh­ing loss that had such impor­tance to the season. 
Notre Dame's primary goal for the season, according to coach Traey Coyne, was to win the Big East championship. But with that now out of the question, the Irish must play for something else in their final regular season game. 
The Irish will have a week to regroup and focus, then will take on Cornell. The Big Red come into the game sporting a 1 0-5
