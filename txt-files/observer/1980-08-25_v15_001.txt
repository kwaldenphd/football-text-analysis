The bold Israeli government gave pre­liminary approval yesterday to a hydroelectric project that would channel water from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea. Arabs in the Israeli-occupied WestBankoftheJordanRiver and Gaza Strip are strongly opposed to the plan. 
energy Minister Yitzhak Modai said the station would save Israel $800 million in oil imports annually at current world prices. 
It could provide 18 percent of Israel's current peak-hour power needs without raising the level of the Dead Sea, where water evaporates so quickly that the lake is the highest in mineral content in the world, he said. 
A 67-year-old retired funeral home director who supposedly raised marijuana plants "as a di­version," has been fined $1,000 and placed on two years' probation for possession of 400 plants. Henry Zopf was 
sentenced Thursday after pleading guilty before Judge James Scullary in District Court. Defense lawyer Cynthia Spinola said 
Zopf started gardening after he retired. "He needed a diversion and turned to growing marijuana. They were small plants and I'm sure he had no idea what he would do with them once the plants matured," she said. 
A local television station in Travers 
City, Mich., was scheduled to show the 1940 Ronald Reagan film Knute Rockne: All-American, but pulled the movie at the last minute for fear it would be required to provide equal time for Presi9ent Carter and candidate John Anderson. Instead, WGTU showed The Story ofSea Biscuit, starring Shirley Temple, ,Ls its Tuesday afternoon movie. "It's a good thing she's not running for anything this year," said station manager Foster Winters. 
Campaign workers for Rep. John B. Anderson sa1d yesterday they'll have more than enough voters' signatures to get their candidate on Indiana's presidential ballot this November. Between 15,000 and 20,000 signatures had been filed with county clerks around Indiana this week in time for the Friday deadline, Ann Rogers, an Anderson campaign spokeswoman, said. By late Friday afternoon, 4,000 to 5,000 of those signatures were certified, Ms. Rogers said. The Illinois congressman needs ,6,982 certified signatures of registered voters to be placed on the Indiana ballot. 
A house resolution introduced yesterday urges state election officials to ensure that absentee ballots are sent to the American hostages in Iran. Rep. Thomas B. evans Jr., R-Del., said the resolution would ask state officials to check whether any of the 52 hostages held since last Nov. 4 are registered voters in their states. Ifso, an absentee ballot would be forwarded to the U.S. embassy in Tehran for the hostages to vote in the November general elections. evans said, "This action would show both our fellow citizens and their captors that America has not forgotten them, and their precious rights ofdemocracy cannot be locked out by a bunch ofinternational hoodlums." 


Consumer prices did not rise 
overall in July, the first month without an increase in more than 1 3 years. Buta new burst offood price increases signaled that more inflation is on the way. The Labor Department reported yesterday that the Consumer Price Index held steady in July, mainly because the cost ofbuying a home dropped for the first time in seven years. Food prices shot up by 0.9 percent-the biggest increase since March-and a dramatic rise in wholesale food costs in July has yet to work its way to consumers. When mortgages and the cost of homes are excluded, prices rose 0.6 percent during the month, a rate that, if continued for 12 months, would mean annual inflation of 7.4 percent. Overall consumer prices increased 13.3 percent in 1979 and at an annual rate of12.6 percent during the first seven months ofthis year. The index in July stood at 247.8 before seasonal adjustment. That means goods and services that could be bought in 1967 for $100 cost $247.80 last month. The 1967 dollar is not worth 40.4 cents. 

The first court-martial ofanAmerican returning from a Vietnamese prisoner ofwar camp was to begin today with Marine Pfc. Robert Garwood facing charges of desertion and collaboration during the nearly 14 years he spent in the Southeast Asia country. 
Outside the tiny courtroom at Camp Lejeune, N.C., where C ,rwood will be court-martialed is a bright red wall poster urging leathernecks to "Stay Proud, Stay Marine."

Inside Monday 


Your first taste of an all-nighter 
There's a lot to be said for composing prose at 4 a.m. One thing that certainly should not be said is that it is an ideal time to write or think. One thing that may be said is that you will find yourself doing it often. 
And that, perhaps, is the sagest "welcome" message I can give you. In fact, I find myself at · this very moment composing prose I thought­
for sure, for sure -I would write in the casual bliss of mid-afternoon. But these are the times that try men's souls. They are also the times when one digresses with frightening frequency, allowing one's thoughts to meander into literary allusions pertinent to the plight ofplans and the late hour's merciless rush toward deadline. For instance ... 
"The best laid plans of mice and men aft gang aglay" (Robert Burns of course). Or perhaps something appropriate to the late hour and deadline. Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom you should get to know, once said: "When a man knows he is to be hung in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully." Wonder­ful. 
Ah, but why do I stray from my subject. "Is it perfume from a dress ... that makes me so digress?" (that is T.S. eliot, but don't worry about him until you're either a junior or very sure ofyour sexual nature). One couldgo on, but mounds of literary allusions do not a piece of journalism make, and that is what I have been told to do: make journalism, not allusions. It's kind of like "make love, not war," only· in reverse. 
Now, just between you and me, we have probably lost ev~ryone at this point we wanted to lose along the way. So let's get to the point ofall this, which they wouldn't have been interested in reading anyway. 
No matter what you had been led to believe by well-meaning but hopelessly naive high school guidance counselors, college is not where one goes to earn a degree guaranteeing a high-paying "starting salary." That's utter crap. Anyone around here who tells you that, professors included (gasp), are people whom you shouldn't trust. 
No, if the truth be told, college will do more 
for you than simply show you the way to those 
gold paved avenues called "career opportunity." 
College will teach yo_u how to get yourself in a 
bind, then get back out again. This lesson will 
serve you well in "the real world," a concept 
bandied about quite a bit in college, a place 
never so neatly defined as a syllabus, an environ 
never quite so predictable as a South DiningHall 
dinner. 
A lot ofconcepts are bandied about in college. And most concepts, though they float and flail in the difficult realm of the abstract, sincerely attempt to arrive at a conclusion that makes the "real world" more concrete, more meaningful, 


Mark 
Rust 
Managing Editor 

more more, Journalism makes that attempt too. Sometimes it is ari exercise in simple concrete­ness; making economics comprehensible, put­ting Palestinian "terror into historical perspec­tive. Sometimes it is an exercise in commentary; shedding light on the human situation by showing the relationship between a ghastly fire and crowded dormitories. And sometimes it seeks to entertain by reflection; connecting thoughts in the night with an overall scheme ofa college education. Pretty presumptuous, huh? 
Our philosophy at The Observer remains one of staunch committment to.the ideals and cannons ofjournalism: accuracy, fairness, accountability. We also try to stir the coals of thoughtful criticism, as any intelligent publication needs to do. TheInside column is a little ofthat intellectu­al fire. Generally we will add to the reportage you may find on the frot).t page or substantiate the opininions you will read in the editorials. Or we may just accent the crisp perceptions that entertain on the features pages. Or, as in today's column we may just meander. 
But there's a method to our madness, and in it you may just find your first model of a time­honored collegiate exer.cise: writing under dead­line pressure. You see, the point of this column can be outlined as though it were a lecture on a blackboard. First, you do what you must to fulfill a requirement. Next, you reflect on your predic­ament until literary insight grabs hold and takes over. Then you feed yourself intellectually with the notion that most ofthe guidance you receive for your $6,000 plus per year is depressing but very, very wrong. Finally, you console yourself in the knowledge that the real world is real, its ebb and flow far removed from the mundane concerns of academia. Thus it can be said jour­nalism is the remedy for a multitude of non­sequiturial sins. 
But there is a larger lesson here. Within the next week you will look at each individual syllabus handed you by your professors. You will listen soberly to their wise and careful admon­ishments to "not fall behind" or to "start your paper now." You will nod gravely. You will absorb their countless examples of poor foolish students who, thinking they were immune to last minute dashes, entered upon the three-little­piggie syndrome, whereby they played until the wolfcame calling. Finally, you will forget every­thing they said and find yourself, as the sun comes up, resorting to analogies from childrens tales. 
There's a lot to be said for concluding prose at 7 a.m.

Reagan, Bush confer on apparent contradiction 
LOS ANGeLeS-George Bush, his mission to China in behalf of Ronald Reagan an ap­parent flop, arrived here yester­day to confer with the GOP presidential nominee and try to patch up their contradictory remarks over relations with the world'1> most populous nation. 
Reagan and Bush planned to meet privately today before holding a news conference on Bush's just-concluded three-day trip. 
The official New China News Agency said Bush had "failed to reassure China" about Reagan, and that his attempt was "can­celled out" by Reagan's renewed call for an official governmental relationship with Taiwan. 
In China, Bush had told re­porters that a Republican ad­ministration could not legally es­tablish a governmental liason office on Taiwan and, even if it could, had no intention ofdoing so. 
Bush bypassed reportersatLos 

Angeles International Airport, 
and was whisked away in a 
motorcade. At his hotel, he was 
brought in a back door, and 
refused to stop for questions.

According to Dedrick, re­construction work will attempt to approximate the original blueprints as closely as possi­ble. 
"We're going to try to be as faithful (to the original plans) as possible," Dedrick said. "We might even be able to install a mansard roof similar to the original one as cheaply or cheaper than a regular roof like the one on Cavanaugh." 
No cost estimates or com­pletion target dates were avai­lable, but Dedrick noted that cleanup work should be com­pleted within the next week, and rebuilding could begin as soon as Oct. 1. 
St. edward's Hall was built in 1882 to house Notre Dame's minim department, a type of boarding school for young boys. It was converted for use by University students in 1929 following the disconinuation of the minim department.

"We have confirmed that Stevens is not the man's real name. That name was traced to an obituary found in a looseleaf notebook, one of many obi­tuaries found. This man is a real slick operator, the slickest I've seen yet;" city detective Darrell Grabner said. 
The two were arrested Wed­nesday as they fled from a jewelry store in Mishawaka, 
apparently  conspirators  in  a  
scheme  to  acquire  diamonds  
from  area  jewelers by using  

either forged credit cards or cer­tified checks. The pair attempted to make their get-away in a car police say 
was stolen from New Mexico. 
The woman's role in the scheme is not clear yet, Grab­ner said. But so far police have discovered about 50 different names with birth certificates, drivers licenses and various type ofregistration in the man's belongings. 
The identities have linked him to Arkansas, Virginia, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Florida, Massachusetts, Alabama, New Mexico, Oklahoma and India­na. 
"The man apparently came to town, opened a checking ac­count at a Marshall County bank (20 miles south of South Bend) using a Bremen address that listed a SteRhens as a resident. He then apparently made up business cards iden­tifying him as a doctor," Grab­ner said. 
"The man would pick out his aliases from people who were roughly his age and who died in locations other than where they were born," he said. 
It appears that this may be the man's first arrest, Grabner said. FBI bureaus and police depart­ments across the country have been asked to help determine his identity.

Hesburgh entets 27th year 
Father Hesburgh's chief contri­bution on the national level has been in the area of civil rights. Appointed to the U.S. Commis­sion on Civil rights by President ~wight 0. bisenhower when the commission was established in 1957, he was named its chairman by President Richard M. Nixon in 1969 and served in that capacity until his resignation at Nixon's request in November, 1972. Notre Dame, with the assistance of the Ford Foundation, has es­tablished on campus a Civil Rights Center 'which will promote the cause of human rights in this country and abroad. 
Nixon's successor as, the na­tion's chief executive, Gerald Ford, appointed Father Hesburgh in 1974 to his nine­member board charged with ad­ministering clemency to Vietnam War draft evaders and deserters. 
Since leaving the~ civil Rights commission, Notre Dame's pres­ident has been very active as chairman of the Overses Devel­opment Council, a Washington­based private organization formed in 1969 to promote ef­fective aid to underdeveloped countries. He has also traveled widely in Third and Fourth World areas, often on assignment from the Rockefeller Foundation, which he joined as a trustee in 196 3 and of which he became chairman of the board in 1977. He formerly served on the President's General Advisory Committee on Foreign Assis­tance and is a director of the Council on Foreign Relations. 




Many of his recent writings, in­cluding The Humane Imperative, published by the Yale University' Press in 1974, stress interdepen­dence ofthe earth's peoples as the key to human survival in a time of shrinking resources. As a member of the board of the Chase Manhattan Bank, he has empha­sized investment by transnational corporations in underdeveloped countries. 
Two major developments at Notre Dame during his admin­istration were the reorganization of the University's governance under lay control, accomplished in 1967, and the introduction of coeducation at the undergraduate level in the fall of 1972. 
Father Hesburgh's leadership in education in recent years has been reflected in his work as president of the International Federation of Catholic Univer­sities, whichheheadedfrom 1963 to his resignation in 1970, and as a member of· the Kerr-Carnegie Commission on the Future of Higher r..ducation, the key na­tional study group on higher ed­ucation's problems and promise which completed his work in 1974 . 
Sixty-one colleges and univer­sities have conferred honorary degrees on Father Hesburgh, a­mong them Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, Danmouth, St Louis, UCLA, Michigan State, Northwestern, Illinois, Indiana, LeMoyne, Fordham, Wabash, Brandeis, the University. of Southern California, the 1Catholic University ofSantiago (Chile) and 
Notre Da_me Prestdent Fr. Theodore Hesburgh 
the University of Vienna 
(Austria). 

HighligHting a long list of special awards given Father Hesburgh is on the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest ci­vilian honor, bestowed on him in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Among groups which have honored him are the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Urban Coalition, the American Jewish Committee, the Indiana Bar Association, The United States Navy, and the National Institute of Social Sciences. He is an e­lected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of hdu­cation, and the American Phil­osophical Society. 
Father Hesburgh was born in Syracuse, N.Y., on May 25, 1917, the son of Anne Murphy Hesburgh and Theodore Bernard Hesburgh, an executive of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company. (A brother, James Hesburgh, was graduated from Notre Dame in 1955, received his M.B.A. from Harvard in 1960 and now is President of Intercole Automa­tion in Los Angeles.) Father Hesburgh has two sisters, Mrs. Robert O'Neill, Cazenovia, New York, and Mrs. John Jackson, Syracuse, N.Y. A third sister, Mrs. Alton Lyons, Oneida, New York, died in 1957. Both his parents are dead. 
He was educated at Notre Dame and the Gregorian University in Rome, from which he received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in 1940. He was ordained a priest of the Congregation of Holy Cross in Sacred Heart Church on the Notre Dame campus June 24, 1943, by Bishop John F. Noll of Fort Wayne. Following his ordi­nation, Father Hesburgh contin­ued his study ofsacred theology at the Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., re­ceiving his doctorate (S.T.D.) in 1945. He joined the Notre Dame fac1,1lty the same year, and served as -chaplain to World War II veterans on campus in addition to his duties in the theology de­partment. He was appointed head of the department in 1948, and the following year was named ex­ecutive vice president in the ad­
mmtstration  of  Rev. John  J.  
Cavanaugh,  C.S.C.,  University  
president.  

At the age of 35 inJune, 1952, Father Hesburgh was appointed the president ofNotre Dame. His administration has marked one of the greatest periods of physical growth and internal academic development in the University's 135 year history. Today he heads an institution with a beautiful campus of 1,250 acres, a disting­uished faculty of more than 700 scholars, and an enrollment of some 8,800 student.'> from every state in the Union and more than 60 foreign countries. 
Since Father Hesbur!!h became president, Notre Dame has erec­ted two dozen major buildings, including the 14-story, $9 million Memorial Library which opened in 1963; a $3 million Computing Center and Mathematics Build­ing; a $2.2 million Radiation Research Building built on cam­pus by the U.S. Atomic hnergy Commission; a $1.5 million Center for Continuing r..ducation; Lewis Hall, a residence for wo­men; an $8 million Athletic and Convocation Center; Hayes­Healy Center, the $1 million home ofNotre Dame's new grad­uate business administration pro­gram; a University Club and two high-rise residence halls, and the Paul V. Galvin Life S<j,ence Center, which includes the new quarters of Lobund Laboratory for germfree animal research and the departments of biology and microbiology.

ND, SMC tuition costs rise again 
Riehle will centralize SG 
By Tim Vercellotti 

A more centralized voice in student affairs is the immediate goal ofstudent government this year, according to student body President Paul Riehle. Riehle hopes to effect reforms in the current system, the official-
voice of Notre Dame students. 
His plans are based on the 
conversion of the Hall Presid­
ent's Council into a student­
senate. 
According to Riehle, the present student government is too decen-tralized. "I want to make the HPC the center of the student gov<:rnment. This would give the student body wider representation, as well as a more effective voice in the administration," Riehle explained. Also, Riehle feels that a student senate would give an element of continuity to the work of the student 
11;overnment. 
SMC student government 
The Saint Mary's Student Government is in a process of change and experimentation this year. According to Presi­dent Kathleen Sweeney, "We are experimenting with many new ideas. A !otis in the drawing 
stages  that should  come  to­ 
gether  in  the  next  week  or  
two."  

The judicial System under­went restructunng during the 1979-80 academic year. These changes will be announced and explained to the students in the first weeks of classes, according to Sweeney. 
The Student Assembly, de­scribed as the "congress" of the Student Government, was dis­banded last spring. The Student Government is nowJonducting 
. a self-study to decide if it will be 
reinstituted or replaced. 
"The Student Government brings many of the disjointed areas ofstudent life together. It is involved in community af­fairs, social justice and com­bining the academic life with the social life at Saint Mary's," explained Sweeney. 
The Board of Governance is the main governing body of the student government. Accord­ing to the Student Government Manuai,"The purpose of the Board of governance shall be to act as .1 steering committee by discussing problems relating to 
Student  Government  and  by  
making  recommendations  to  
student  committees.  It  shall  
(continued on page 8)  

Retorms in the make-up of the government would involve changes in the govenrment's constitution, which can only be done m a con-stitutional convention. Riehle hopes to gather ideas for governmental 
reforms through open meetings, to be held in the residence halls. 
The student government can be worked out through these for­ums and then it will be for­rmalized through the conven­tion," Riehle stated. 
The purpose of a student government, regardless of its form, is the service of students. Riehle said that this year's student government has both short and long term plans. Among these are a recycling program, and a student social center. 
Kiehle intends to establish office hours soon, and he en­courages all students, es­pecially freshmen and transfer students to stop in at his office on the second floor of La­Fortune. 
an average of$60 per semester. 
The cost increase at Saint Mary's is not as substantial as it appears, according to Student Accounts associate Diana Barnes. "The tuition increase is not yearly, therefore theunt is 
not unusually high,"  Barnes  
said.  
As  a  result  of the  cost in­ 

creases at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, more available funds have been allotted for financial aid, officials at both schools said.

Russo added that financial aid has always been a problem at Notre Dame. "There is never enough money to assist all of the students who apply," Russo said. "The problem worsened due to both the increase in tu­ition costs and the state of the economy."

Both the University ofNotre Dame and Saint Mary's College have increased tuition costs for the 1980-81 scho0l term. 
Undergraduate tuition at Notre Dame has increased $500, up to $4630 a year, while room and board costs increase $250 for an average fee of $1765. 
Salary and benefits improve­ments for University employees and higher food and energy costs were cited as contributing factors to the increase by the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh~ University president. Hesburgh added that a review of 35 peer institutions revealed that Notre Dame's tuition ranked 28th and room and 35th in board. The increase in tuition and room and board costs is more than in previohs yeah, according to Richard Conklin, director of Information Services. "The cost increase is more substan­tial than in previous years, but inflation has also increased more substantially," Conklin said. 
Tuition at Saint Mary's College increased from $1775 to $1975 per semester, while board increased $30 and rooms

"Precautionary security mea­sures are being taken. We're discouraging the girls from walking alone and at night," Ward said. 
Freshmen, however, reacted 
somewhat negatively to their 
residences. 

"I feel like I'll be left out of the excitement ofthe campus," one commented. 
Another woman said, "I didn't mind it (the arrangement) at first, but now that I'm here I see what I'll be missing." 
Freshmen further added that they think their living arrange­ments will hinder their social activities as well as their in­v()lvement in studentactivities. 
Heppen confirmed that an extensive shuttle program will be implemeted to enable the women to get to meals, classes and activities. 
"It is only for three months though,'' Ward commented. "I think that's why the girls are accepting this so well. They're looking forward to being in the new dorms next semester." Ward confirmed that Univer­sity administrators have "pro­mised" the women residences in the new dorms next semes­ter. 
Since the women must liter­ally hop on a bus to eat break­fast. freshmen also commented somewhat negatively on their eating arrangements at the South Dining Hall. 
"There's no food over here at all," one freshman commented. "It's an inconvenience to take a shuttle bus to dinner." 
Ward said that plans are underway to initiate a weekend breakfast program utilizing Villa Angela's operable kitchen 
and dining room. 
The rooms in which the freshmen are staying consist primarily of spacious singles. Several freshman did say, how­ever, that they would prefer having a roommate first semes­ter. 
"I guess will just be knocking on each other's doors a lot,'' a girl commented. 
To obtain her position as rector, Ward explained, she wrote a a letter to the University expressing an interest in "doing something." In the letter she included her work experience which was nursing, as well as her knowledge of the campus·. She said she was contacted lastJuly with the offer of Villa Angela rector. 
In addition to the situation at Villa Angela, campus dorms are also feeling the pressure of additional students. Residents ofSt. J:.dward's Hall are living at several dorms on campus. Stu­dents returning to dorms at both ND and SMC have ob­served that last year's baggage rooms and study lounges have now become student residen­ces. Housing authorities said a total of 20 rooms were renovated.

One of the common complaints of newly-enrolled freshmen is that they are not fully acquainted with the campus. New students can be con­fused by the hundred-odd buildings. 
; Many must ask older students ques­
tions like, "Where are the fourth-~" floor classrooms in O'Shaughnessy. 
To help the new students and to make them feel like a part of Du lac, we present a tour of the attractions 
on campus. 
Freshman Year Office (1). 

In this building, we find the offices of hmil T. Hofman, Dean of Fr~sh­men, and his staff. Dr. Hofman ts available on Wednesday afternoons for ring-kissing. (Phone for an 
appointment).

St. Michael's Laundry (2). 
The University is particularly 
proud of the service they afford the 
male students with this ultra-modern 
laundry facility. As a further 
improvement, the laundry has just 
this year added a new boiling caul­
dron and rock. 

Administration Building (3). 
Under the Golden Dome are many of the vital departments of the University, among which are the Admissions Office (who due to a massive clerical screw-up admitted this freshmen class) and the Office of Student Accounts which never screws up when it comes to promptly sending tuition bills). 
"Freshman year is a very special time for young people, a time of transition. That transition must have a special approach," broil T. Hofman, Dean of Freshman Year of Studies, maintains. The Freshman Year of Studies, located next to Brownson Hall, seeks to make transitions easier, helping freshman to arrange their academic schedules and pro­viding needed guidance in adjust­ment, academics, long-range acade­mic and career planning and personal problems. 
According to Dean Hofman, the Freshman Year of Studies is, in ef­fect, a college for freshmen who have not yet declared their majors and formally enrolled in a University 'college.' 
''We provide whatever assurance is needed by them to be successful in the freshman curriculum," Dean Hofman explains. 
The department has a staff of advisors, each of whom is assisted by six or seven seniors, readily available as counselors. "Our freshmen don't have serious psychiatric probl~ms, but common problems such as homesickness," Hofman remarked. Talking with students who have "been there" can ease freshman anxieties. All freshman are encour­aged to take advantage of this op­portunity for personal guidance and assistance. 
I 

The Freshman Year ofStudies also sends out monthly newsletters to freshmen and provides free tutoring service, as well as self-instructing 
media aids, in Brownson Hall, through the Freshman Learning Resource Center. Tutors provide help "over and above what can be reasonably expected of the teach­ers," Hofman claims, and canstreng·­then communication between pro­fessors and students. The Resource Center is directed by Sandra Har­matiuk. 
The Freshman Year ofStudies also sponsors a number of activities for freshmen because "they're fun, and good options to the drinking scene," Hofman said. These options include cookouts, shopping tours, and Fresh­man Date night, details of which can be found in the freshman newsletter. 
To provide further aid for fresh­men adjusting to college life, a booklet by Hofman offering tips from paper-writing to partying, will be distributed to every Notre Dame freshman. Hofman promises the booklet is backed by "thirty years' experience." 
The Freshman Year of Studies is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
Saint Mary's Freshman Office, located in Room 121 LeMans, is headed by Susan Vanek. The office counsels freshmen on first semester Bookstore (4). 
Here students can buy all those non-resalable books at prices well above cost. The lower floor has the finest selection ofOsmond albums in Northern Indiana. 
Infirmary (5). 
The Student Health Center prov­ides the best in modern medical care. Ifyou feel under the weather, be sure to stop by for a leeching. 
Rockne Memorial ( 6). 
Afternoons during the school year, "the Rock" is the site of many exciting on-court battles between students. Sometimes they play basketball. 
Security Office (7). 
This is the centrally-located head­quarters where our champions of justice work 'round the clock to protect the campus from that menace, the illegally-parked car. 
North Dining Hall (8}. 
"Quality Food" is not a foreign term to the Dining Hall cooks; they know what it means and work diligently to assure that none is served here. It is also a great place to practice your foreign languages when ordering entrees. 
Memorial Library (9). 
Later in the semester, the second floor ofthe "Sacred Silo" is the site of the nightly meeting of the ND/SMC Gossip Society. 
LaFortune Student Center (10). 
A multi-purpose building, LaFort­

une houses the offices of student government, where you gain valuable 
Mark Ferron 
experience as a lackey to the Ad­ministration. Also in LaFortune is the Huddle, fast-food restaurant par excellence. A favorite place for the over-30 crowd, it is world-renown for that savory grease-bomb, the Huddle-burger. 
O'Shaughnessy Hall (11 ). 
This is whete most freshmen classes are held. In the basement of the building is the grade-lottery machine which professors use to randomly generate the semester's grades. 
Notre Dame Stadium (12). 
Here is the site of last year's greatest victory: section 35's success at "passing up" Glenda "Fats" Donahue. 
Cushing Hall of bngineering (13). 
On Friday mornings, the hngin­eering Auditorium is a favorite hang­out ofstudents of hmil T. and others with masochistic tendencies. 
South Dining Hall (14). 
Like the North Dining Hall, the South offers a meal-time change of pace for those tired ofeating tasty or appetizing food. 
The Crossing ( 15 ). 
Most freshmen will make the trip 
"across Highway 31" within the first 
two weeks of the semester. For the 
fortunate, it will also be their last.

The South BendNobody Knows 
Brow:se through a South Bend telephone directory. One discovers that there are 61 apartment com­plexes, 1 3 architects, 8 billard rooms and clubs, one Arthur Murray Dance Studio, and 82 taverns (including one with the intriguing name of "Mar­ion's Hide-a-way"). The phone book hints at an area's activities: its bus­inesses, history, and pleasures. But what is the story behind those brief listings? How did these people, some of whom live in those 61 apartment complexes, find themselves in South Bend? 
Like Notre Dame, South Bend traces its roots to an enterprising Frenchman. It was the French ex­plorer Robert Cavelier Sieur de La Salle who first blazed trails in the area, travelling down the Mississippi from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico around 1675. A plaque in South Bend's Riverview Cemetery com­memorates LaSalle's visit to the area. The early French influence is reflec­ted in Indiana names: Vincennes, Versailles, Vevay and Lafayette. 
Despite La Salle's early explora­tions, it took the French more than a century and a half to establish a local presence --not until 1829 when fur trader Pierre Navarre arrived to establish a trading post for the American Fur Company on the south bend of the St. Joseph river. The trading post was originally known as "Big St. Joseph Station" or "The Bend". The present name was not adopted until 1830, when French settler Alexis Coquillard christened the post of 128 traders South Bend. 
Today, the population has reached almost 125,000. When the surroun­ding St. Joseph county is included, the number rises to 280,000. 
Almost seven percent of the pop­ulation is black. Another 15 percent is comprised ofwhat the census sheet labels "foreign stock". These are the ethnic groups of South Bend-the Poles, Hungarians, Serbians, Greeks, Swedes, and Mexicans -that proud­cling to their language and culture. (For example, one can still find church services in Polish.) 
Where do all these people work? Notre Dame is tbe town's second largest employer, with 2800 employ­ees. Historically, however, the Stu­debaker Corporation was the area's most important employer. Stude­baker was founded in 1852 when two of five Studebaker brothers started a blacksmith shop which srJon expan­ded into wagon and buggy making. By the end of the century, Stude·· baker was one of the largest wagon makers in the country, and in 1904, it expanded still further into auto­mobile production. 
South Bend was the heart of the Studebaker operation, acting as corporate headquarters and residen­tial territory for Studebaker's largest production plant. By 1949, 12,000 locals were employed for the com­pany. 
Unfortunately for South Bend, Studebaker suffered a series of marketing setbacks after introducing the streamlined body in 1949-50. By 1963, the work force dropped to 7 ,000, and finally, Studebaker left the region altogether in December !963. Today, the Studebaker factor; ts a wholly-owned subsidiary of 

McGraw-hdison where the Avanti a high-priced, custom-made sports c~r is still manufactured in very limited numbers. · 
Studebaker's departure left the Bendix Corporation as the town's major employer, with a work force of approximately 6,000. Founded in South Bend in the 1920's Bendix began as a manufacturer 'of auto parts, and later moved into aviation p~oduction. The South Bend plant sttll concentrates in these two areas alth~ugh Bendix has expandecl constderably beyond its South Bend beginnings and become a worldwide ~ongfomerate with many diverse mterests. 
But, as the number of taverns reveal, there is more to do than work. There are varied attractions for diverse interests. Take architecture for example. South Bend boasts tw~ buildings designed by Frank Lloyd 'Wright, a forerunner of the modern school of architecture. The Avalon G~otto, 705 W. Washington, is a pn~ate, ~orne designed during Wnght s fmal architectural period.· The other has recently been sold to a private party and is not open to the public. Information on these places can be obtained from the Northern Indiana Historical Society and the 
'South Bend Convention and Visitors Bureau. Another interesting building is the 
Michelle Kelleher 
Studebaker Mansion or Tippecanoe Place. Completed in 1889, it was the 
residence  of  company  president  
Clement  Studebaker.  
If  all  this  

history fails to catch your interest, there is always the great outdoors. The Freshman Year of Studies per­iodically sponsors trips to Bendix Woods where one can go hiking, skiing or picnicing.One sight not to miss: pine trees plant~d to spell out "Studebaker" (the park was formerly the Studebaker proving grounds). Other picnic places are the Rum Village Park and Nature Trails . 
The phonebook, radio and Sou,th Bend Tribune are useful ways of becoming acquainted with the area. Movie cinemas offer a reasonably good selection of both first-run and held-over movies, and the local theatres -the South Bend Civic Theatre, the Century Center, and the Morris Civic Auditorium, among others present an ambitious selection of comic, musical and dramatic entertainment. 
The four years at ND-SMC can be spent a lot rrore enjoyably if one 
takes ad vantage of what So-uth 
Bend has to offer.

Athletic and Convocation Center 

When Notre Dame's Athletic and Convocation Center o-. pened on December 7, 1968, NBC sportscaster Curt Gowdy called it "the best, most com­plete sports complex in the country." Many similar facili­ties have been built in the 12 years since, yet the ACC still ranks near the top of the list. 
A newcomer to the U niver­sity.might wander through the ACC's maze of stairwells and corridors for hours and still not see it all. The building's 464,800 square feet of usab)e floor space make it the largest exibition hall between Detroit and Chicago. 
Quite simply, the double­domed ACC is divided in two. Under the south dome is the 11,345 seat basketball arena, home of Fighting Irish basket­ball. Yet the arena's incredible flexibility permits it to house major concerts (The Cars, Bill Cosby coming up), guest speak­ers (former President Ford last winter) and more. 
Under the north dome is the 
fieldliouse, an even more flex­
ible facility used by over a half 
dozen varsity teams at various 
points during their respective 
seasons. The most notable 
fieldhouse residents are the 
hockey and track teams who not only practice there, but compete as well. Hockey seat­ing permits over 4,000 fans to watch the Irish and seating is provided for several hundred track and field fans. 
In addition to the dozens of phys ed students who use the ACC daily, the many facilities between the domes and around their perimeters are for the use ofall Notre Dame students and faculty. Four basketball courts, eight handball/racquetball courts and four squash courts are available. Unlike the Rock­ne Memorial facilities, how­ever, which are available on a first-come/first-serve basis, the ACC courts should be reserved. 

Also located between the domes and around their peri­meters are most of the athletic department's administrative of­fices. On the second floor are the ticket office, the sports information office, the student managers-office, the Monogram Room and the administrative offices. On the first floor are almost all of the varsity sports (and coaches) offices plus the varsity training facilities and weight room. 
Students may be asked to , present a valid Notre Dame identification card to be gran­ted admittance to the building. Those wishing to borrow e­quipment (i.e. racketballs, bas­ketballs, towels, etc.) must present a Notre Dame ID. 
The building's hours of o­peration vary with the schedule of special events, but basically, the ACC is open from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily. Check the ACC 
bulletin  board  or  your  hall  
bulletin  board  for  schedule  
changes.
