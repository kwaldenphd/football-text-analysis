Major issues mark first Senate meeting 
Brown warns against off­campus student rowdiness 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
Student body president Liz Brown warned student senators Wednesday that unruly off-campus behavior by students this weekend could jeopardize ongoing discussions between student and eity leaders about the proposed ordinance addressing large parties in South Bend. 
"Many of us have the mentality that by moving oil' campus we are automatically free from the rules and regulations that govern residence life on campus," she said. "However. we must realize that although we no longer have to check in with our rector and RAs. we do have a responsibility to behave as responsible residents of the South Bend community." 
Brown sent an e-mail to the student body on Aug. 4 to notify them of an ordi­nance drafted by members of the South Bend Common Couneil. The ordinance requires residents of boarding houses ­

Project awaits tax changes 
Eddy Street complex will include retail, restaurants, office, residences 
By MARCELA BERRIOS Associate News Editor 
During a time of town-gown tension, the construction of the $200 million, 25-acre Eddy Street Commons may help connect the campus to its surroundings with blocks of shops, restaurants, resi­dences and offices. 
"We hope Eddy Commons will be a place where students and South Bend residents alike can go to spend an afternoon shopping or enjoy a good dinner," said David Compton, vice president of Kite Realty Group, the project's developer. 
The South Bend Common Council approved the developer's proposal for the planned unit development on July 16, authoriz­ing the rezoning of the property near the intersection of Edison Road and Eddy Street, said Gregory Hakanen, Notre Dame's director of asset management and real estate development, said Tuesday. 
The first phase of the project, which will include retail, office and restaurant space, hotels and residential space, will be complet­ed during 2009. But ground can­not be broken until the city works out tax issues, Hakanen said. 
Developments such as the Eddy Street Commons, which allow for multi-purpose units, require spe­cial permissions from the city, he said. 
The Council unanimously approved the proposal Notre Dame and its Indianapolis-based developer, Kite Realty Group, sub­mitted in early May. 
Before the Council approved Kite's plans, the developer had to make concessions to receive the votes of council members who were skeptical about the project's

Hilton near SMC not set to open this weekend 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
The Hilton Garden Inn next to Saint Mary's will not open by this weekend's opening football game against Georgia Teeh. despite advertisements that it would. 
The hotel, located on Douglas Hoad. will aeccpt reservations beginning Nov. 1. But it's possible, said General Manager Nicole Smeltzer, that the hotel could open earlier. 
"We may be able to open for lthe Sept. 22] Michigan State !home game[." Smeltzer said. 
With that game only a month away, construction is continu­ing on the Gillespie Conference and Special Events Center, located on the northeast side of the hotel site. 
The center, which will open by Feb. 1, will be available for formal dinners, conferences, weddings and special events, Smeltzer said. It will seat 750 formal dinner guests and up to 8,400 J!leople when it is used as a banquet center. 
The Hilton was built after the Sisters of the Holy Cross were approached by the Holladay Corporation in late 2005 about constructing a 100-unit Hilton Garden Inn Hotel and a 350-seat confer­ence center. 
College President Carol Ann Mooney announced the con­struction plans to faculty, staff and administrators on Aug. 16, 2006. 
In order to provide parking without detracting from the College's main entrance, the College and the Sisters bro­kered a land exchange to pre­serve the green space in front of the College. 
The College has opted to deed one acre of land west of Angela Drive to the Congregation and will receive in exchange the land east of Madeleva Drive in front of the Welcome Center and Madeleva Hall. 
The Congregation's newly­. acquired land will allow addi­tional parking to the north and

Joyce Center and ND Stadium will now accept Domer Dollars 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
Concession stands at Notre Dame Stadium and the Joyce Center will now accept Domer Dollars, student body president Liz Brown and vice president Maris Braun announced Wednesday during the first Student Senate meeting of the academic year. 
Brown told members of the Student Senate that, after collaboration with Food Services and Vending Services, Domer Dollars could now be used in the two loca­tions. 
"This is obviously a great new program that we have," Brown said. 
The announcement was a political coup for Brown and Braun, whose campaign platform last year included the addition of Domer Dollars at the two largest venues for Notre Dame athletics.

I walked-no, shoved-my way in to a darkenml room full of sop­ping wnt bodies indistinguishablo from mu:h othnr, all moving to the boat of an unrecognizable song. The guys all fmd some sort of collar on, another memo I missnd, and the girls all had domwd somn sort of dub attiro. 
What fun is this? I had known every­OJJP tlwn~ for exactly one week and was in no hurry to entertain myself by dandng l(>r tlw nnxt two hours. Unfortunately. I had no ehoice, eonsid­nring I was envdoped in tho broiling­hot mob of pPople and lim:ed to move at tlwir disiTPtion.

Hventually all femalns wero evacuat­ed and my friends and I. along with everyone else still awake and on cam­pus, dnseendnd on Hm:kers.

Eventually, the party scene got better. We croated traditions for our parties.

So froshmen, before departing for your lirst evening experience in one of our illustrious residence halls, prepare to leave the premises soaked. Be ready to be thrnatcned by HAs you've never soen. Don't be surprised when the song changns every eight seconds. But most of all, make it your own. Find some friends to enjoy it with. 011'-campus has its meril"i; make sure to experience that too.

Burglar can't escape after Houdini heist 
SCRANTON, Pa. -A man accused of breaking into the Houdini Museum was unable to escape from police. 
Oflicers said they appre­hended the man about 2:30 
a.m. Tuesday, based on descriptions by three wit­nesses of two men seen flee­ing from the museum. One witness told police he chased the men for several blocks. One man remained at large. 
Charles Watkins. 25, of Scranton, was charged with a felony count of attempted burglary and misdemeanor charges of criminal trespass and loitering. 
Watkins was arraigned before District Judge Thomas J. Golden and lodged in the Lackawanna County Prison in lieu of $5,000 bail. It was not immediately known if he had an attorney. 

"He's going to need more than Houdini to escape from this problem," said Dorothy Dietrich, museum co­founder and director. 
Dietrich said nothing was taken or badly damaged in the break-in, and the muse­um devoted to early 20th century escape artist Harry Houdini was open on Tuesday.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -An elementary school has banned tag on its playground after some chil­dren complained they were harassed or chased against their will. 
"It causes a lot of conflict on the playground," said Cindy Fesgen, assistant prin­cipal of the Discovery Canyon Campus school. 
Hunning games are still allowed as long as students don't chase each other, she said.

Series to examine how policy affects Latinos 
Special to The Observer 
John Trasvifia, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), will open the Institute for Latino Studies' (ILS) Public Policy Lecture Series with a talk titled "Latino 
Immigrants in America: Our Past and Our Future" at 
4:30 p.m. Sept. 5 in 200 McKenna Hall. 
The series, titled "A Public Policy Agenda and a New Vision for the 

Future," will fe a-Trasvina ture world-renowned scholars and policy makers who will discuss the impact of public policy issues on the Latino population and the consequences for American society in general. The lectures are intended to stimulate thought and dia­logue on issues of immigration, educa­tion, philanthropy, political access, business and economic power. 
Trasvifia, who will explore the nation's immigration history and pres­ent policy recommendations for the 

future, is a graduate of Harvard University and Stanford Law School. He began his career at MALDEF as a legislative attorney in 1985 and was appointed to his current position last year. In 1997, President Clinton appointed him special counsel for immigration-related unfair employ­ment practices. In that role, he led the only federal government office devoted solely to immigrant workplace rights and was the highest ranking Latino attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice. He later taught immigration law at Stanford Law School and has testified before Congress in support of extending the Voting Rights Act and against "English only" legislation.

Ordinance 
continued from page 1 
defined as residences occupied by more than two unrelated people -to submit an applica­tion to the city 10 business days before holding any gath­erings in which more than 25 people would have access to aleohol. 
Brown urged the senators to tell their friends and class­mates that student govern­ment alone cannot change the ordinance. She said the stu­dent body must contribute to their efforts, because student behavior during the next few weeks could affect the out­come of the eventual hearing. 
Brown called the ordinance a "huge wake-up call for Notre Dame students." She told sen­ators she is not recommending an end to off campus student parties, but rather encourag­ing students to be respectful or their neighbors and other South Bend residents. 
"We need to see some improvements in student behavior -it's just a fact," 
Brown said. 
Community relations chair Colin Feehan reiterated Brown's stance during his committee report, saying that that student behavior during the first full weekend of the fall semester and for the next few weeks could have a decid­ing effect on the outcome of the ordinance. 
"Our ability to negotiate is dependent on student behav­ior," Feehan said. "So this weekend, especially, encour­age your friends and class­mates to be respectful to their neighbors." 
Brown said South Bend Mayor Stephen Luecke's oflice told her the South Bend Police Department will actively enforce the disorderly house ordinance, the existing ordi­nance that addresses noise violations. 
Brown and student body vice president Maris Braun began discussing the ordinance with city officials before most stu­dents returned to schools. They have met with members of the Common Council, the mayor and other city officials to discuss alternatives to the ordinance, which would apply to many students living off campus and would levy stiff fines against residents who did not submit applications. 
The Common Council decid­ed Monday to delay the public hearing for the ordinance, for the third time, until Sept. 17. The mayor's oflice also drafted a revised version of the ordi­nance with what Brown called "major changes." 
The mayor's proposal would require individuals living in boarding houses to notify the police department 24 hours in advance of a gathering of 25 or more non-residents. 
"This change is major," Brown said, "because it is a. notification, rather than a reg­istration process." 
Under the mayor's proposal.. there is no application to a city administrative office, only notification to the police department. Fines will, howev­er, still be charged to individu­als who do not observe the stipulations of the ordinance, Brown said. 
"This new version is at least. a step in the right direction, and I am encouraged that we have another week now to dis­cuss further developments that would bring us closer to our goal of moving away from this restrictive ordinance," Brown said. 
Brown said she plans to con­tinue to meet with city and University officials during the next few weeks. She said she has a meeting planned for Friday with city council mem­bers, the mayor and Vice President for Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman. 
Brown's address was deliv­ered from the podium -a set­ting she said should emphasize the importance of her message about good behavior by stu­dents. 
"I don't like to take the podi­um except for the three times a year that I address you in regard to the state of the stu­dent union," Brown said, "but I wanted to come up here today to draw some attention to an issue that has obviously been on the forefront of stu­dent minds for the past month."

WASliiNGTON -Idaho Sen. Larry Craig's political support eroded by the hour on Wednesday as fellow Hepublicans in Congress called for him to resign and party leaders pushed him unceremoniously from senior committee posts. 
The White House expressed disappoint­ment. too -and nary a .word of support for the 62-year-old lawmaker, who pleaded guilty earlier this month to a charge stem­ming from an undercover police operation in an airport men's room.

Frustration lingers for New Orleans 
Bush visits battered city on two-year anniversary ofKatrina as residents protest 
Associated Press 

NEW ORLEANS Prayers, protests and a lin­gering disgust with the gov­ernment's response to Hurricane Katrina marked the disaster's second anniversary Wednesday, with a presidential visit doing little to mollify those still displaced by the storm. 
Clarence Russ, 64, took a dim view of politicians' promises as he tried to put the finishing touches on his repaired home in the city's devastated Lower 9th Ward. 
"There was supposed to be all this money, but where'd it go? None of us got any," said Russ, whose house was the only restored home on an otherwise deso­late block. 
Not far away, President Bush visited a school. "We're still paying attention. We understand," he said before heading to the Mississippi Gulf Coast, also devastated by Katrina. 
But Gina Martin, who is still living in Houston after Katrina destroyed her New Orleans home, was uncon­vincecl. "Bush was clown here again making more promises he isn't going to keep. The government has failed all of us. It's got to stop," she said.

DaimlerChrysler profits down 14% 
FHANKFUHT -DaimlerChrysler AG said Wednesday that its second-quarter profit fell 14 percent and disclosed plans to spend about $10.2 billion buying back nearly 10 percent of its shares as it moves forward without its Chrysler division. 
DaimlerChrysler's profit decline excluding results from Chrysler and its finance arm ­which did better in the latest quarter than a year ago -was a steeper 20 percent. 
The automaker said it earned 1.44 billion euros ($1. 91 billion) excluding the opera­lions it sold, compared to 1.8 billion euros a year earlier. 
It now expects a charge of 2.5 billion euros for the year from the sale of Chrysler group and its financing arm, less than it had previously thought. 
DaimlerChrysler also said it expects vehi­cle sales to be in line with the 2.1 million it sold in 2006, with revenue on par with the 99 billion euros it reported last year. 
The company sold the Chrysler group and North American financial services units to Cerberus Capital Management LLC earlier this month in a $7.4 billion deal that saw the private equity group take an 80.1 per­cent stake in Chrysler. 

Hackers unlock iPhone from AT& T 
NEW YOHK -Hackers have figured out how to unleash Apple's iPhone from AT&T's cellular network, but people hoping to make money from the procedure could face legal problems. 
At least one of the companies hoping to make money by unlocking iPhones said it is hesitating after calls from lawyers repre­senting the phone company. 
Unlocking the phone for one's own use, for instanee to place calls with a different carri­er, appears to be legal. But if it's done for financial gain, the legality is less certain. 
"Whnther people can make profits from software that hacks the iPhone is going to depend very much on exactly what was done to develop that software and what does that software do," said Bart Showalter, head of the Intellectual Property practice group at law firm Baker Botts in Dallas.

Sikhs oppose changes in turban screenings 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A new air­port screening policy for turbans and other headwear has the country's Sikhs concerned they are being unfairly targeted. 
The federal policy change went into effect Aug. 4, subjecting trav­elers to secondary screening at security checkpoints if they are wearing head coverings, such as cowboy hats, berets or turbans. The screenings could include a pat-down search of the head cov­ering if the screener finds it nec­essary. 
The New York-based Sikh Coalition believes the new policy singles out Sikh~ and others who wear religious head coverings. More than 25 ethnic and religious organizations, such as the American-Arab Anti­Discrimination Committee and the Asian American Justice Center, have signed the coalition's petition against the policy change. 
In the Sikh religion, the turban is considered private, and remov­ing a turban would be like removing a woman's blouse, Neha Singh, the coalition's advo­cacy director, said Wednesday. Since 2001, federal policy has required screeners to search tur­bans only if they do not clear a metal detector. 
The Transportation Security Administration denies any use of racial or religious profiling in its security screening practices. The recent policy change applies to all head coverings that could be used to conceal something, said TSA spokeswoman Amy Kudwo. The change was not a result of any specific threat information about hiding explosives or weapons in head coverings, she said. And all travelers have the right to request a private screening. 
"Head coverings do not 'require' a search under the new policy," Kudwo said in an e-mail. "Individuals MAY be referred for additional screening if the securi­ty officer cannot reasonably determine that the head area is free of a detectable threat item." 
The Sikh Coalition has docu­mented 40 incidents when Sikhs were subjected to these searches since Aug. 4. And some of these travelers were not offered a pri-­vate area for screening, Singh said, adding, "This is going to lead to profiling." 
TSA will not disclose the details of new policy for security rea­sons. It broadly explains the screening procedures on its Web site with a picture of a white cow­boy hat and another picture of three young women laughing and wearing winter hats. 
The Sikh community was not notified of the screening changes as it has been in the past, the advocacy group said. The organi­zation met with TSA ofTicials on Aug. 22 and has another conf'er­ence call scheduled next week to discuss the issue, Singh said. TSA told the coalition the airport screeners decide to perform sec­ondary screening on turbans at their own discretion. 
If the policy remains broad and unregulated, it could lead to pro­filing, said David Harris, a racial profiling expert at the University of Toledo College of Law. 


Gov. previews Tech report 
Kaine troubled that violent essays weren't shared with law enforcement 
Associated Press 
RICHMOND, Va. -Seung-Hui Cho's violent essays-including one similar to the Vrrginia Tech massacre he carried out ­weren't widely shared with law enf'orcement, the governor said Wednesday in a preview of a key report on the shootings. 
Gov. Timothy M. Kaine said officers' lack of access to the student gunman's class compo­sitions before the attack is "a significant fea­ture" in the his life, that that information was unknown to anybody on the Tech campus," Kaine said. 
Kaine said he read about the writings in an earlier draft of the report. He is to publicly dis­cuss details in the final report for the first time Thursday. 
Virginia Tech turned over a compilation of Cho's writings to the review panel, including plays and other student writ­ings so bloody that they horri­fied teachers and classmates. One 2006 fictional

out there or different people had informa­tion where it needed to be put together," Kaine said. 
The governor said it was hard to understand why more was not done about a student who had shown a fascination with the 1999 Columbine High School shooting spree and, in his video manifesto mailed in the middle of the Blacksburg slayings, said he considered the two students who committed it martyrs. 
''I'm troubled that a student who had talked about Columbine at an earlier point in 
piece was not given to the review panel until recently because of an oversight by school officials, Tech spokesman Larry Hincker said. 
Some of the families of those killed and injured have demanded frank answers about how Cho was able to commit the worst mass shooting on an American college campus despite behavior that had alarmed fellow students, faculty and police. 
Among those questions: Why wasn't Cho monitored more closely after a judge deemed him a threat to himself more than a year before the shoot­ings? And why didn't Virginia Tech alert the campus more quickly and cancel classes after the frrst two shootings in a dor­mitory, two hours before the main massacre in a classroom building? 
"I know that some parents of the deceased are focusing on the mental health aspect of how Cho through all his life slipped through the cracks, and I understand that," said Suzanne Grimes, whose son Kevin Sterne was shot in the leg and sur­vived. "My focus is why they didn't cancel the classes that day." 
Grimes' 22-year-old son was shot in Norris Hall, where 30 people were slain and Cho com­mitted suicide. Sterne has returned to Virginia Tech to earn a master's degree in elec­trical engineering, but a bullet remains in his body and he still receives physical therapy. 
"If the panel report does con­tain some accountability in it, it will offer some closure to the families," Grimes said. 
Cathy and Peter Read, whose daughter Mary Karen Read was killed in Norris Hall, said they want the panel to hold responsi­ble parties accountable for the shootings. They also want the report to include recommenda­tions on privacy and mental health laws, gun availability and the safety of students at universities. And they want the panel to reconvene at periodic intervals to review and ensure progress.

If nothing else, Budy Giuliani has courage. Say the name "Budy" to any non­Notre Dame fan and the first image that comes to mind is Giuliani, in a dust mask, walking the streets of lower Manhattan on Sept. 11. While Prnsident Bush and Vicf~ President Cheney jetted around the country to undisclosed, secure locations, Hudy walked into the heart of the problem. 
Hecently, though, Hudy's couragA has bmm manifested in a very different, but very dangerous. way. After obscuring his view on abortion in the first Hepublkan primary debate, (;iuliani decided to be honest about his position that abortion ought to be legal. Hudy told Americans, "In my casA, I hate abortion. But ultimate­ly, because it is an issue of conseience, I would respect a woman's right to make a difl'erent choice." Giuliani would later definitively insist that he finds abortion "morally wrong." In an age when, as author Kevin Phillips reporl'i, "Evangelicals, fundamentalist<;, and Pentecostals" make up "some 40 percent of the I Hepublican] electorate," that sort of honesty takes courage indeed. 
Of course, Hudy is not alone in this illog­ical "personally opposed but should be legal" position. Former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, a Catholic Democrat, famously detailed the same argument in a speech at Notre Dame in 1984. Cuomo argued that Catholics need to "weigh Catholic moral teaching against the fact of a pluralistic country where our view is in the minority." In 2004, John Kerry said, "I oppose abortion, personally. I don't like abortion. l believe life does begin at conception." Still, Kerry main­tained, "I can't take what is an article of 

EDITORIAL CARTOON 
faith for me and legislate it for someone 
who doesn't share that article of faith." 
Surely, the list does not stop there; 
Democrats (and, in Giuliani's case, the 
occasional courageous Republican) fre­
quently take the "personally opposed, 
but. .." position. 

But thio;; position on abortion has a sig­nificant flaw. No matter where on the ide­ological spectrum you fall, you eannot honestly and logieally maintain that abor­tion is both a moral wrong and ought to be legal. Simply put. a person ean't have a right to do a definitive moral wrong, and that seems to be precisely what Cuomo, Kerry and Giuliani lind abortion to be. 
Presumably, Hudy believes abortion destroys a human life. His Catholic bark­ground, together with his lack of any ~~quivocation or eonfusion about tlw morality of abortion, suggeslo;; that this destruction is the reason he finds it moral­ly wrong. 
If abortion is "morally wrong" because it amounl'i to the destruction of innoeent children, though, nobody-no matter his "courage"-can daim it ought to be legal. In this view, abortion is tantamount to murder. And it is safe to say that nobody, religious or otherwise, would entertain the idea that you can be "per­sonally opposed" to murder but "respect a [person's] right to make a different choice." As speakers at the Miehigan Catholic Conference once asked, "If it is morally permissible for us to say every woman has a right to make her own deci­sion regarding abortion ... why can't everyone have an equal right to decide whether or not to shoot his neighbor?" If you believe abortion is the moral equiva­lent of murder, there is no room for nego­tiation on its legality. 
Maybe Giuliani's "courage" will carry him farther than Cuomo or Kerry, all the way to the White House in 2008. When Rudy says that he fmds abortion "morally wrong," he tries to maintain some credi­bility with the much discussed Christian base of the Republican Party. That is, even 
though he is pro-choice, he tries to speak 
the same moral language as docs the bao;;e 
to which he is trying to appeal. I can only 
hope, though, that America stops lauding 
politicians for their "courageous" igno­
rance a11d rndaims some critieal intelli­
gence as a nation of voters. 

The very fact that he is being seriously 
eonsiden~d suggeslo;; an even scarier reali­
ty for the so-ealled Heligious Hight: 

Perhaps, for most people, abortion is not 
as black and white as they want-and 
prodaim-it to be. It isn'tjust that soeie­
ty on the whole is confused about the 
morality of abortion. Many people arc 
eonflicted about whether abortion is 

"morally wrong." Most pflople don't "hate" 
abortion in the absolute sensn that "hate" 
implies. 

They weigh tl1n circumstances of the abortion to determine il'i morality and our fnnlings toward it. They want to know when, why and how the abortion is per­limned be lim~ they pass judgment. They're illy about the morality and legali­ty of abortion. And the moment they admit that. tlw position against th1~ impo­sition of a morality beeomns infinitely more logieal and appealing. 
No politieian, though, can admit this internal confusion publidy -lip serviee to soeiety-wide "complexity" notwithstand­ing. For most, abortion is not an absolute, but we always speak about it as if it must be. To admit personal eonflict about abor­tion, though, would be a demonstration of the sort of politieal -and personal ­honesty that we rarely sen in politics. 
It would be the most eourageous posi­tion of aU.

Catnpus Ministry lVelcotnes students 
In the name of the staff of Campus Ministry -and myself, I would like to welcome all Notre Dame students back to campus for a new academic year. All of us hope that this will be a great year for all of you and we look forward to being Richard with you in some of Warner, C.S.C our many Campus Ministry activities. FaithPoint 
Once again this yPar, we will offer an Ignatian Weekend Retreat early in October and we are also planning a five-day silent Ignatian Retreat at the time of Spring Break. A number of people are helping us to develop our team, including Father Frank Murphy. 
Father Lou DelFra has joined our staff and will share writing opportuni­ties for this column with Kate Barrett. He will also assist us in developing a new series of Bible studies. 
Finally, a long-term member of the Campus Ministry staff, Chandra Johnson, who served as associate director of campus ministry and direc­tor of African American student min­istry, has accepted a wonderful new opportunity in McLean, Va., working for a foundation that nationally sup­ports African American students. Since this development only took place in July, we did not have an opportunity to invite Judy Madden to join our staff to replace Johnson until recently. I look forward to working with Madden as she serves our African American stu­dents. 
We all look forward to a great new year in ministry as we work together with our student leaders and with all of you to build up the vibrant commu­nity of faith that is one of our wonder­ful mission values at Notre Dame.

Stick it to the tnan, avoid high-priced books 
At the start of each semester I head down to the basement of the Nebraska Union, and the sight I'm faced with is enough to make Chuck Norris cry. Dozens of students. no more deserving than me of 
the punishment we're  
all about to receive,  Dan Halverson  
apprehensively stand in  
line and await the  Daily  
opportunity to spend a  Nebraskan  
eouple hundred well­ 

earned American dollars on their text­books for the upeoming semester. 
On the surface, it seems like a fair trade; dead trees with ink on them for some dif­ferent dead trees with more ink on them. But I'm not eon tent with surfaee appear­ances here, because I'm getting ripped off. I presumably could do some kind of real investigative journalism into just how much money the University Bookstore aetually makes off us, but those findings would likely just further depress me. For my purposes here, I'll just assume the answer "a lot" is sufficient, and eontinue on. 
The point that needs to be made, howev­er, is that the bookstore sells thousands of dollars of books to students at the start of the semester, and four months later, at the end of it, those books are worth little more than a Snickers or a six paek -if that much. Do books really lose their value that quickly? Have the laws of physics, the ones that took centuries to figure out, all of a sudden ehanged in the past four months while you were sitting in class? 
Of course they haven't. But there is money to be made, and students are high­ly susceptible to the exploitation. Quite frankly, I think it is a seam. And pardon me if this sounds like hyperbole, but it is arguably one of the greatest ones this eountry has ever seen. The Mob eould never pull off something this good. 
It is not uncommon for a student to spend upward of 500 dollars on textbooks at the start of the semester. For many of us, this seems exeessive. By the time the semester is over and half the books haven't even been craeked (or is that just me?), it seems even more so. 
I walk down the stairs, ealrnly wait in line, show the cashier my NCard, and lo and behold, they will be using the 23 edi­tion next semester in place of the 22 edi­tion that I now feel like practieing my shot­putting skills with. I begin to wonder why I didn't just provide the bookstore a blank eheek and free reign over my credit cards four months ago. After all, they couldn't possibly screw me over fmancially all that mueh more, could they? 
I paid hundreds of dollars for some books, and now that I want to sell them baek in just as good of shape, I'm informed that begging for change on the eorner of 14th and 0 is a superior money­making seheme. 
So, how do they get away with it? Well, for starters, there are in faet some classes in whieh you do need the books assigned if you hope to suceeed. These classes are far fewer in number than the professors here on eampus would have you believe when they hand out syllabi on the first day of class, but they are out there nonetheless. 
For most of us, all the classes we sign up for are classes we will be taking for the first time, and therefore we are unable to know whieh ones we will need books for and which we won't; we usually just play it safe and buy them all. Combine this with the relative ease and availability of books at the bookstore, and you see a system that profits tremendously from a revolving door of naive college students convineed that they not only need every single text­book assigned to them, but that the book­store is the best plaee for them to pur­ehase these books. 
The truth is, there are other places you ean go to get your books, and I recom­mend you give one or more of them a try. 
For starters, there is the library. Books, at the library? I'm a source of immeasura­ble amounts of knowledge, insight and wisdom, I know. But seriously, so long as it isn't a textbook that you'll need every day of the semester, it is worth a try (middle of campus, just west of the union, if you come to CBA, you've gone too far). 
There is also the Internet. Two sourees that I've heard particularly good things about are Arnazon.com and Half.com. The availability of the books you will be looking for is quite good, and more often than not, the price will be significantly lower than what you could hope to find down in the bookstore. 
So long as you aren't a spoiled only child and can wait a couple days for the U.S. mail system to do its job and get you your purchases, I'd recommend this route. 
IdentifYing the "necessary" books from the "probably ought to have" books is no easy task. But one thing I have learned that you should keep in mind -the far­ther down the list a book is, the less important to the class it probably is. Much like a fantasy football drafter has his own style in selecting players, you too will have to develop your own style of selecting books. 
So there you have it. Three suggestions for beating the system. Or, at least, for giv­ing it a kidney shot as it drags you into a pit of financial despair. 
Good luck and happy reading.

All are experienc­ing serious disappointment in their lives, and the encounter and their circumstances force them to face their shortcomings and fail­urns. "Savage in Limbo: A Concert Play" will run in the Philbin Studio Theatre Oct. 8-12.

First there was Superman. Then there was Spider-Man. 
And now there is Optimus Prime ­the latest red, white and blue-clad hero to dedicate costume and cause to the defense of this great nation during a big screen summer blockbuster. Prime, in case you happen to have never played with toy action figures as a child, is undoubtedly the George Washington of robots -a founding father and freedom fighter who arrives on earth to defend all of humankind from vicious attacks from the evil Decepticons. 
Optimus Prime doubles as a tricked­out semi with more knick-knacks and doodads than the friendly folks at "Pimp My Ride" could ever hope to customize. Like Prime, the rest of the Autobots (the shape shifting robots dedicated to saving us all) arrive with a flurry of whirring clicks and grind­ing gears as a series of mechanized metal minions pop, lock and drop in and out of their covert and battle modes.

Dodgers rally from five down to complete sweep 
Phillies top Mets on controversial call at second base; Rockies stay in wild-card hunt with win over Giants 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Los Angeles has resuscitated Shea Hillenbrand's big league career, and the seven-year veteran is doing his best to recharge the Dodgers' season. 
Hillenbrand hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning and a sacrifice fly in the 12th as the Dodgers rallied from a live-run deficit to beat the Washington Nationals 10-9 on Wednesday and complete a three-game sweep. 
"''ve been through a bit of adversity this season that I never even thought would hap­pen in my career -especially with the success I've had," said I !illenbrand, who was reunited with former Boston manager Grady Little on Aug. 13 in L.A. after getting released by the Angels and Padres. "The game is very humbling, so you've got to takn advantage of every opportunity you can and every situation you gnt put in." 
James Loney drove in four runs for the Dodgers, who also got homers from Hussell Martin and Matt Kemp. Jeff Kent had four hits, including a leadoff single that started the winning rally. 
Los Angeles, which won its fourth straight, began the day 4 1/2 games back of NL West­leading Arizona, the closest the Dodgers had been to first place in three weeks. 
"We're excited about being able to come home and win three games, because we know we've got to play some catch­up and make up some ground here," Kent said. "We're all pulling on the same side of the rope, so we'll see how good we are." 
Washington wasted an 8-3 lead and lost its sixth straight game. Nook Logan drove in three runs for the Nationals and Ryan Church had four hits. Hobert Fick homered and drove in two runs, but also grounded into a pair inning-ending dou­ble plays with runners in scor­ing position. 
"We just ran into a team that's real hungry, and they showed it -especially today," Fick said. 
Phillies 3, Mets 2 
Marlon Anderson went a little too wide with his slide. 
Anderson's hard takeout attempt might have been enough to bust up a double play in the ninth inning and allow the tying run to score for the New York Mets. Instead, Anderson went far outside sec­ond base, knocked down Philadelphia's Tadahito Iguchi and was ruled out on a game­ending interference call in the Phillies' victory Wednesday night. 
Jimmy Rollins and Pat Burrell homered, and Brett Myers survived a wild ninth to help the Phillies win their third straight game against New York and close within three games of the NL East leaders. 
''I'm just glad the umpire made the call and took care of it," Iguchi said through an interpreter. "I think we were fortunate he was right on the play." 
The Mets had runners on the corners with one out against Myers when pinch-hitter Shawn Green hit a slow roller to Rollins, who shoveled the ball to Iguchi at second. 
Anderson made a rough slide 
. at Iguchi outside the line and knocked the second baseman down as he threw to first. Second base umpire CB Bucknor ruled interference and a double play, sending Anderson into a fit. 
He ripped off his helmet and jumped up in protest, and man-

ager Willie Randolph also rushed out to argue. 
"I know it shouldn't have been a double play, but at the same time we have to abide by the rule of the umpire," Anderson said. 
Rockies 8, Giants 0 
Jeff Francis provided exactly the kind of performance the Colorado Rockies so desperate­ly needed as they head into a key weekend series at first­place Arizona. 
Francis pitched a six-hitter for his second career shutout, Garrett Atkins homered twice and the Rockies beat the San Francisco Giants on Wednesday to avoid a three-game sweep. 
Despite their yearslong repu­tation for losing, the Rockies believe that this year they are clearly in the chase for the NL West going into the final month. Colorado came into Wednesday 5 games behind 
San Diego for the wild-card spot. 
"We still think we're in it," reliever Matt Herges said. "It's feasible." 
Francis' big outing sure helped matters. 
The left-bander (14-6) struck out three and walked one in his second career complete game. The other was a two-hit shutout against St. Louis on July 24 last year. 
He matched his career high with his 14th win -also accomplished in 2005 -and had two hits while making his 100th career start. Francis, who became just the sixth pitcher in franchise history with 100 starts, allowed only two batters to reach second base on the way to ending a three-start winless stretch. He is 12-2 since May 7 -and has won at least 13 games in each of his three full major league seasons.

AP A trainer helps University of Southern California quarterback John David Booty stretch during football practice in Los Angeles on Aug. 10. Summer workouts helped Booty beat recurring back problems. 
Back injury resolved for USC's Booty 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES -The back problems that bugged John David Booty for years are finally behind him. 
That being the case, the Southern California quar­terback was able to partici­pate in a rigorous training program administered by strength and conditioning coach Chris Carlisle this summer. 
The results are obvious. 
"I think the offseason program made a big difl'er­ence," Booty said. "The SC program, you see guys year after year looking like NFL players." 
Booty, a fifth-year senior, finally got his shot at play­ing last season after sitting and watching Matt Leinart star at quarterback for three years. He made the most of it, passing for 3,347 yards and 29 touch­downs with nine intercep­tions. 
For a while, it appeared Booty might not get his shot. lie underwent back surgery in March 2006 after experiencing prob­lems since his junior year in high school because of a herniated disc, and had to beat out freshman Mark Sanchez for the starting job last summer although he still wasn't in tiptop condition. 
He is now. 
"For the first time since his sophomore or junior year in high school, John David felt comfortable, and it opened up his ability to train the way we've trained quarterbacks here before," Carlisle said. "We did a lot of core work -abdominal, lower-back work. 

"He has more zip on the ball as a result because he has more power coming from the core and his legs. His body weight went up to 220 (pounds). He stands in the pocket now and knows he can take a shot without worrying about it. lie's pain-free and confident in what he can do." 
Trojans coach Pete Carroll has noticed a big difference. 
"The fact that he ean just work out regularly with coach Carlisle in the pro­gram where he couldn't do that a year ago makes all the difference in the world in his confidence and ath­leticism," Carroll said. "John David has had an incredible run since the springtime." 
Offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian said Booty reminds him of four-time Cy Young Award winner Greg Maddux because of his accuracy. 
"I think the thing that jumps out at you is his ability to lit the ball in tight quarters," Sarkisian said. "You ever watch Greg Maddux? He doesn't miss." 
IN BRIEF 

DeForf.(e now lead scorer in 
the WNBA 

INDIANAPOLIS -Anna DeForge, not Tamika Catchings, was the Indiana rever's top scorer in their playoff series win over the Connecticut Sun. In fact, DeForge leads the entire WNBA in playoff' scoring. The shooting guard averaged 25 points against the Sun, a surprise from someone who averaged 8.7 points in the regular sea­son. She hopes to continue her success against Detroit in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals Friday. 
DeForge was content with a second­ary ofl'ensive role this season before Catchings, an early favorite for the MVP award, suffered a left foot injury that kept her out for a month. While Catchings healed. DeForge started looking to shoot. Even with Catchings back for the playoffs, DeForge put up a scoring spree that brought back memories of her college days at Nebraska. 
Montoyjl dominates several 
NASCAR races 

NASCAR's Juan Pablo Montoya is $25,000 rieher, thanks to some good finishes at the right races. Raybestos, which normally pays $1,500 to the top rookie at each Nextel Cup race, increases that amount to $5,000 at seven designated events throughout the 2007 season. Montoya wound up taking top rookie honors at five of them, including Las Vegas, Darlington, lnfineon, Chicagoland and last Saturday night at Bristol. 
Overall, his 17th-place finish at the Tennessee track was the 11th time this season the former open-wheel star from Colombia has been the top rookie in a Cup race. Montoya leads David Ragan by 25 points. 216-191, in the rookie standings heading into Sunday's race at California Speedway. Montoya is 18th in the season stand­ings, also the best of any first-year driver. 
Jagodzinski to begin as BC's 
head coach 
Boston College's Jeff Jagodzinski ean't wait for the first kickoiT of his head coaching career. Miami's Handy Shannon is trying to keep cool -if only for a short while longer. 
It's finally game week for the two rookie coaches in the Atlantic Coast Conference, and the neweomers are approaehing their debuts differently. 
"It's not so much bein·g nervous, it's being anxious," Jagodzinski said Wednesday. "Everything I've done up to this point in my career has led me to this ball game, so I'm really excited about it, and I'm excited about getting out there and playing a football game." 
Jagodzinski, 43, spent 22 years as an assistant with live college teams and Atlanta and Green Bay of the NFL, leaving the Packers to take over at BC when Tom O'Brien left for North Carolina State.

PGA 
Boston ready for playoffs 
FedEx Cup will resume with Woods to make his debut 
Associated Press 
NOHTON, Mass. -The PGA Tour Playoffs figured to be somewhat of a homefield advantage for someone like Vijay Singh, a three-time win­ner at Westchester and a past eham pion at Tl'C Boston and J:ast Lake. 
Then he shot 40 on his open­ing nine holes and missed the eut in the first event of the play­niTs. 
Steve Stricker had not played at Westchester since 1995, when he tied for 60th and promptly told his wife, "Take a picture because we're not com­ing baek." He had little choice but to return under the FedEx Cup format, and Stricker warmed to the place rather quickly when he won The Bardays for his first victory in more than six years. 
"I think for the most part, most players feel like if they're playing well, they ean compete at any eourse," Stricker said Wednesday.

FIBA 

Unsung Canadians one vvin fron1 finals 

AP Canada forward Olu Famutimi, left, pump fakes two Mexican defenders during Canada's 97-80 win over Mexico Wednesday. 
Associated Press 

LAS VEGAS -Canada, the team without a star, needs one more win to reach the semifi­nals of the FIBA Americas tour­nament. 
Levon Kendall and Denham Brown, two former Big East players, both had double-dou­bles Wednesday in Canada's 97­80 victory over Mexico. 
A victory over Puerto Rico on Thursday in the final game of the second round would mean a semifinal spot for Canada and a chance to play for one of this tournament's two berths in the Beijing Olympics. 
The third-, fourth-and fifth­place finishers receive bids to an Olympic qualifying tourna­ment next July. 
"This was huge because we gave ourselves a chance to get there," said Kendall, who had 14 points and 11 rebounds. "We knew we dinched at least fifth today with the win and now it's the same tomorrow, another must win to get to the semifi­nals." 
Kendall, who played in the NCAA tournament all four of his years at Pittsburgh, got Canada (3-3) going in the second quar­ter-again. 
The 6-foot-10 forward had six points, six rebounds and two assists in the 22-5 run that gave Canada a 47-29 lead with 31 seconds left before halftime. It was the third straight game Kendall came into the game and gave his teammates a lift. 
"That's what my role has become the last few games, come in and be active if we start a little slow," he said. 
Canada's rough first quarter against Mexico {1-5) was because of poor shooting. Canada made seven of 25 shots in the opening 10 minutes and trailed 22-21. Kendall came in, tied it right away with a shot in the lane and after an exchange of baskets, the deciding run started and it was all Canada the rest of the way as it led by as many as 27 points. 
"You have to have different players in different games step up and Levon has been a dou­ble-double guy the last throe games," Canada coach Leo Rautins said. "This format, this marathon format of so many games means you need those other players. 
"We've been very conscious of depth and the players have been responding to that and that's what you're asking for." 
The loss was the sixth straight for Mexico since a win over Puerto Rico on the opening day of the tournament. Coach Nolan Richardson's uptempo, pressure style seemed to have caught up with his team. 
"We got here and played our 20th game in a month and with the style I play it's very difficult. We're a trapping team, a run­ning team and we're not blessed with big people so I was just hoping we would survive," said Richardson, who led Arkansas to the NCAA champi­onship in 1994 and is in his first year with the Mexico national program. "To play the first game against Puerto Rico the way we did, we still had it when we got here. But between the wear and tear and travel it backfired in that we didn't have legs." 
Brown, who played on Connecticut's national champi­onship team in 2004, had 11 points and 11 rebounds. Canada had six players score in double figures and it finished with a 61-30 rebound advantage. 
"We take pride in rebound­ing," Rautins said. "Our wings can really get on the glass. We did a great job today and 26 offensive rebounds puts a lot of pressure on people, especially on a team like Mexico who wants to run and get into tran­sition." 
Mexico's Rome! Beck, who played at UNLV, entered the game tied with Brazil's Leandro Barbosa as the tournament's leading scorer with a 23.3 aver­age. He was 1-f'or-6 from the field against Canada and fin­ished with two points. 
"It was fatigue, fatigue. I 
· couldn't even feel my legs in warmups," Beck said. "I was trying to run the pick-and-roll to get shots like I had been all tournament but today it wasn't there."

Jets will aim high with 'Mangenius' 
Associated Press 
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.-Eric Mangini had quite a rookie season. 
lie went from being known as Bill Beliehiek's ingenious assistant to becoming the "Mangenius," a suceessful and popular coach who could count Tony Soprano among his fans. 
Clever nicknames and televi­sion eameos aside, the ever­focused Nnw York Jets coach faces a big challenge following a I0-6 snason and a surprising playoff appear­anee.

While Mangini's waistline has been steadily shrinking since last year-he's lost at least 40 pounds -tlw hopes for this season are signilkantly higher. 
"Every season, there are teams that were disappointing that suddenly had very good seasons and teams that expnc­tations wnn~ high for that did­n't," a guarded Mangini said. "Yo~ sen it ynar in and ynar out. 
Thomas Jones, acquired from Chicago in Mareh, should play offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer said. "The No. 1 thing was bringing in Thomas and just trying to get a l'nel for the second year in the sys~nm and the things we can do. 
Pennington bounced back from career-threatening injurins last year to being voted the league's Comeback Player of the Year after throwing for a career-high 3,352 yards. 
"What we've done in the past has no bearing on the future," said Pennington, nchoing Mangini's thoughts. "It's a new season

Giant concerns raised in New York 
Coughlin on hot-seat despite two straight playoff appearances 
Associated Press 
EAST HUTIIEHFOHD, N.J. ­

Despite making the playoffs the 
past two seasons, expectations 
for the New York Giants aren't 
that high. 
Tiki Barber, the Giants' all-time leading rusher and ollimsive cat­alyst, retired for a television career. Thn wait lbr Eli Manning to live up to expectations contin­ues. And who knows what to expect from seven-time Pro Bowl defensive end Miehad Strahan, if anything. . Then there's the Tom Coughlin factor. The no-nonsense coach is on the hot seat after failing to get past the first round of the play­offs two straight years amid all kinds of turmoil. 
If the path gets bumpy again, things could get ugly fast. 
That's the Gianl<>, though. They were the defending NFC East champs and considered a legiti­mate Super Bowl contender a year ago. They got big heads, suffered a couple of injuries, pointed lingers and went 8-8 to barely squeeze into the playoffs. 
"One of the things we are striv­ing for this year is playing together as a team," center Shaun O'Hara said. "I think last year we had a lot of individual talent, but l don't know if we played well as a team every Sunday. That's our overall goal as a. team, to complement each other in every phase and make it a collective eflort." 
Whether the Giants can get back to being a title contender depends on three key issues: 
-Can Manning have a consis­tent season and avoid the big mistakes? 
-Can big, bruising Brandon Jacobs do as well as Barber, and stay healthy? 
-Will Strahan end a holdout 
and play a 15th season, and can 
the defense survive without him? 
The Strahan question was tho most unexpected. I lours before training camp opened, the NFI;s active sacks leader announced he was holding out while he mulled retirement. Five weoks later, and just a little mom than a week before the opener at Dallas, he was still mulling his options. 
On the field, the offensn has shown the potential to carry tho Giants, especially if Manning ean avoid a third straight second-half slump. Having former quarter­backs coach Kevin Gilbridl·l as the oflfmsive coordinator should hnlp Manning, who is also being tutored by Chris Palmer, another longtime quarterbacks guru. 
One thing that has changnd is Manning has emerged as one of the leaders of the Giants, thanks in part to Barber. 
Barber criticized the quartnr­back's leadership a few weeks ago during halftime on Sunday night football and Manning fired right back at his former team­matn. 
Not only did the retort prop him up in the eyes of his team­mates, but Manning followed that with good stints against Baltimore and the Jets. 
Manning should have plenty of help this season. 
David Diehl's ability to move from left guard to left tackle has strengthened the oflimsive line. It also should help Jacobs use his 6-foot-4, 260-pound frame to run over defenses. 
The receiving corps is dnep with Plaxico Burress, Amani T"oomer, rookie Steve Smith and Sinorice Moss on the field along with Pro Bowl tight end Jemmy Shockey. The eoncflrn is Burress, who missed much or training camp with ankle and back prob­
h~ms. 
"This tnam camn a long way," said Toomer, who has returned from major knee surgnry. "There wnre times early in camp where it was touch and go, but thn young guys stepped up and our dnfense playnd mal wnll." 
Aftnr a dismal pnrlilrmanen in the preseason opnnnr, the defense improved undnr new coordinator Stevn Spagnuolo, allowing one touchdown in the next two games. 
Justin Tuck, who likn Strahan missnd a good part of last season with a serious foot injury, has betm oul<;tanding filling in at left end. Osi Umenyiora has been a force on the other side. 
Mathias Kiwanuka has been adnquate making the transition from def(msive end to strongside linebacker, and fren agent Kawika Mitchell has looknd good as weakside linebackor. With Pro Bowler Antonio Pierce in the middh~. the linebackors are solid. 
The weakness is the seeond­ary, especially with veteran Sam Madison battling a hamstring injury. Hookie eornerback Aaron Boss should provide help at some point. 
"This is going to bo a tnam you can be proud of." Piercn said. "I know one thing you love in Nnw York is defense.

Associated Press 
The Detroit Lions have been the target of relentless verbal and written shots while compiling the NFL's worst record the last six years. 
It turns out, their own play­ers were delivering some of the worst blows. 
"There were knockdown, drag-out fights all the time last year," defensive tackle Cory Redding said. "There were cheap shots with guys getting leg-whipped and hit in the helmet." 
Jeff Backus, who has endured each of the 72 losses since 2001. said last season's team-crumbling behavior wasn't new. 
"It's happened as long as I've been here," the offensive tackle said. "My first couple of years, there were lazy vet­erans that didn't want to be touched in practice. If you blocked them, they would try to get you back in a dirty way for the rest of that practice." 
In his second year, coach Rod Marinelli seems to have gotten rid of the destructive culture that infested a fran­chise with one playoff victory since winning the 1957 NFL title. 
Marinelli's players believe that finally pulling in the same direction will produce positive results for a change. 
"We had no fights in train­ing camp because Rod changed the whole attitude around here," Redding said. "We know we have to fight, scratch, claw and kick our opponents -not teammates

-and I think that's going to make a difference. 
"We have so many winners on this team that are tired of losing." 
Detroit has won just 24 times -an average of four a year -against those 7 2 defeats since team president Matt Millen was given con­trol. 
Tampa Bay's 12 straight seasons of double-digit losses from 1983-94 is the only other stretch of futility in league history that compares. 
Detroit was 3-13 last year, Marinelli's first as a head coach, and only Oakland had fewer wins. 
Quarterback Jon Kitna pre­dicts this year will be differ­ent, claiming the Lions will win at least 10 games. 
If he's right, they likely will be in the playoffs for the first time since 1999. 
"[ was talking like that because of what I saw in the offseason," Kitna said. "We have great team cama­raderie. We don't have a whole bunch of individuals out here, and that's what Rod preaches. 
"That's what wins in this league, not the greatest tal­ent. New England has proven that." 
The Lions seem to have enough ability on offense to live up to Kitna's projection, but their defense will have to exceed expectations to vali­date it. 
Kitna led the NFL with 372 completions last season in Mike Martz's pass-happy offense and was the first quarterback in franchise his­
tory to take every snap in a season. 
Opponents probably will have a tough time slowing down Detroit if a reshaped line, with at least two new starters, can protect Kitna after he was sacked a league­high 63 times last season. 
Roy Williams had an NFC­best 1,310 yards receiving, earning a spot in the Pro Bowl, and Mike Furrey led the conference with 98 receptions. 
Not content with that pro­
duction nor worried about jokes, Detroit used the No. 2 overall pick to draft Calvin Johnson, marking the fourth time in five years the Lions used their top selection on a wide receiver. The 6-foot-5, 239-pound Johnson has a unique blend of size, speed, leaping ability and soft hands. And unlike his experi­ence at Georgia Tech, he shouldn't face double-team coverage. 
"There's a lot of talent here," Johnson said. 
Detroit also added depth at running back in the offsea­son, bringing in Tatum Bell and T.J. Duckett, because it was unclear when Kevin Jones would return from a serious foot injury that side­lined him for the final four games of 2006. 
Two new faces with starting experience will be counted on to open up holes for the running game and give Kitna time to find his talented wideouts. Guard Edwin Mulitalo and tackle George Foster will try to bolster a unit that has been consistent­ly shaky in recent years. 
"I don't think we can score 40 points a game, but aver­aging 28 is realistic," Williams said. "But the key is going to be our defense, which I think is going to sur­prise people." 
If the Lions are effective on defense, it will startle some 
because there are questions from the front to the back of the unit. 
Detroit gave free agent defensive end Dewayne White about $13 million guaran­teed, despite a resume with just 13 starts in 60 games in Tampa Bay and no more than six sacks in a season. 
The Lions made Redding the highest-paid defensive tackle in football, with reportedly up to $20 million in guarantees, after he had a breakout season that includ­ed eight sacks. Shaun Rogers, a two-time Pro Bowl tackle who struggled last season with injuries and was suspended for using a banned supplement. has to prove he's an elite player again. 
The linebacking corps has potential with Ernie Sims and Boss Bailey, but production from the group has been spotty. 
Standout cornerback Ore' Bly was dealt to Denver for Bell and Foster, and the Lions are confident their scheme will negate the loss. 
After defensive coordinator Donnie Henderson tried to teach the "Tampa Two" for the first time, Marinelli fired him and hired his own son­in-law, Joe Barry, away from the Buccaneers to implement the two-deep zone that has been emulated throughout the league.

while no season outcome is determined in August, this weekend's games should show whether Notre Dame can play with the top teams in the country. 
Judging by their 3-0 victo­
ry over No. 14 Northwestern on Monday night, the Irish certainly possess the attacking tal­ent to com­pete with the very best. Seniors Joseph Lapira and Kurt Martin put on

potential to make the Irish attack something special. Despite his solid contribu­tions the past two seasons, Martin has been stuck behind upperclassmen. This year, with seven points in two preseason games, Martin is ready to make his mark. 
What makes the partner­ship of Martin and Lapira so 
a show, combining for all three Notre Dame goals and setting up many other prom­ising chances. 
Lapira's impressive play is no surprise. After all, he won last year's Hermann Trophy-the equivalent of a lleismann Trophy in foot­ball. 
Martin, however, has the ers and slot through balls. Lapira's top-end speed is sure to allow him to run onto a few of Martin's pass­es.

One reason the Irish defensive linemen have been able to adapt so quick­ly to the 3-4 defensive front 
is because of Oliver,  Kuntz

"He's such  a  good  coach  

when it comes to knowing exactly what to do," Kuntz said. "I mean, he's had this defense before and having an experienced coach like him in a situation like this has been nothing but help­
ful." 

Although Oliver was brought to Notre Dame to coach in the 4-3 defense, he said, he has coached the 3-4 in the past -although Brown has brought some new changes to the forma­tion. 
Oliver also credited the willingness or the players themselves in the transition. 
"I think they've made the transition pretty good. I like this buneh, they're hungry, they're eager to learn. 
2007 Season Predictions 



This season is going to be ugly. Damn ugly. The finesse offense that produced prolific numbers is gone, as is the bend-but-don't­break mentality on defense that too often led to breaking. While the passing game is Charlie Weis' forte, something about hard­nosed football being run by a protege of Bill Parcells seems right. Notre Dame will start tho season 2-0, and the series with Michigan is underdog-friendly. But UCLA will trip up an undPI"fmted Irish squad in early October, reminiscent of the 2005 team's loss to Sparta. This year, however, Notre Dame will overcome Troy and enter the BCS full steam ahead. 
FINAL RECORD: 12-1, BCS bowl win 
The Irish bogin the year with a gutsy home win against Georgia Tech. but then head into Happy Vallny and drop their first of the year. Learning from that loss, the Irish go on to upset Michigan and their wnakennd defense. 
Notre Dame uses a combination of good defense and a solid running attack to handle their next two opponent<; boloro losing in a defensive struggle to UClA 
Atkr pounding Boston College, USC comes in and reminds everyone why they am"the presea­son favorites to win it all. The next !bur wins are easy wins and the kish gain a berth in the Gator Bowl where they finally break their bowl losing streak. 
FINAL RECORD: 10-3, Bowl win 



The season breaks dowu into thrne cate­gories: Michigan and USC, six middling opponents, and four easy wins at the end. Tho Irish probably don't have the experienc11 to beat the first two yet, and they will proba­bly be picked otT by one of the "second six," likely Georgia Tech. Penn State or UCLA. There is no way Notre Dame will lose to Navy, Air Foree, Duke or Stanford. 
Along with a win in the Gator or Cotton Bowl, that loaves the Irish with the oxact same record as last year. However, instead of finishing on our sour note, Notre Dame will finish on a five-game winning streak and with confidence for noxt year. 
FINAL RECORD: 10-3, Bowl win 
Notre Dame has one of its toughest tests in a few years this season. With away games at Penn State and Michigan back-to-baek along with home games against Boston College and Southern Cal. the Irish will have to work hard to repeat the success of the Brady Quinn era. 
The most important part of this soason is whether the Irish will reload or rPbuild. A now quarterback and a new dnfense could mean trouble for Notre Dame, but there's enough athletic ability and coaching talent to keep tho Irish a strong team, if not BCS-bound. 
Corwin Brown's defense and the five run­ning back stable will help the Irish more than anyone could think. 
FINAL RECORD: 9-4, Bowl Win

ND ATHLETICS 
Notre Dan1e, Con1cast launch free on-demand channel 
Meanwhile, Big Ten Network goes live, but not on cable giant 
By KEN FOWLER 
Sports Writer 

It just got a little bit nasier to follow Notre Damn athlet­ics. 
Cabin company Comeast and the University last week announced the start of a 
new "on-demand" channel that will f'naturn video of games, practiees and inter­views of all 26 Notre Dame varsity teams. The program­ming, which digital cable customers can view without charge through the "Get Local" portion of the on­demand feature, began last week for customers in 
Indiana,  Illinois  and  
Michigan.  
More than  half  of  

Comcast's customers in the region have digital cable 
and thus free access to the content, said Hich Huggiero, the Comcast vicH president for communications and public affairs in the Chicago and South Bend markets. 
Notre Dame did not charge Comcast a rights fee for the content. Boo Corrigan, the associate athletic dirHctor in charge of corporate rela­tions and marketing, said the athletic department views the agreement as a way of expanding the visibil­ity of Notre Dame's sports 
teams. 

"It literally will cover, ovHr the course of the year, all 26 varsity sports at Notre Dame," Huggiero said. "Naturally, given the very strong interest in Fighting Irish football, there's a lot of football content." 
Huggiero said post-game and mid-week news confer­ences with Irish coach Charlie Weis will be a staple of the programming. Comcast already has added practice reports from the

Notre Dame's year began on a sour note for thn first time in a deeade.

When asked how indicative his team's preseason per­formances were of what's to come in the regular season, Clark said that preseason games mean nothing and that he'd tell us in December.
