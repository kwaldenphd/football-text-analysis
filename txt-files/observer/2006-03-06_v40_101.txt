According to White, Parks is remembered in national folk­lore as a tired seamstress who refused to give up her bus seat to a white man and was subse­quently arrested. llowever, she was not just physieally weary, White said, and it is important to note exactly what Parks was really tired of-oppression.

The Saint Mary's class of 2007 executive board nine­lion, marked by intense cam­paigns and a rare runoff votn, came to an nnd Friday in similar dramatic fashion.

· Big East bid gives Irish hoops fans more hope 
By KAREN LANGLEY 
Assisrant News Editor 
After a frustrating regular season, Notre Dame fans found another reason to sup­port their men's basketball team after Saturday's win against DePaul propelled the Irish into the Big East Tournament. On campus, stu­dents lauded the outcome to the team's precipitous jour­ney towards a Big East bid, but predictions of the team's success in the tournament remain mixed. 
Freshman Chase Smerdzinski contrasted Saturday's game to 
many others throughout thn season. 
''I'm definitely excited," he said. "It's definitely niee to win a close game after so many tough losses." 
Smerdzinski applauded the student fans who attended the DePaul game, saying he was "pumped" to sen so many students enthusiastic about the game. 
Sophomore Amelia Ulmer, a member of the basketball band, was also glad to see a win after witnessing so many nailbiting losses.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Follo-wing m.y dad's advice 
It was Christmas break freshman year when all of this started. 
I had written for The Observer during the fall-covering inter hall football­but didn't feel like doing any writing after that finished. I was more interested in hanging around the dorm during my first semester at ND ­doing a little home­work, eating quarter dogs and heading over to TC with my buddies on the week­ends. College was relaxing and free ... but I wasn't doing much. 
It was on a run with my dad during that Christmas vacation that he gave me some of the best advice I've ever received-get involved. 
I'd waited my whole life to go to Notre Dame, he reminded me, and it would be a shame if I didn't at least do something with my time there. 
I went back to South Bend that January and signed up to work layout at the paper once a week. Today, after two years that sailed by in what feels like two minutes, I'm taking over as Editor in Chief of The Observer. 
My dad never told me during that December jog that I should spend 30 hours a week below South Dining Hall checking pages and calling writers -he just recommended I do more with my four years at NO than simply play DDR and drink beer. 
If I had known that this paper would take up more of my time than I would like, I might never have signed up to work in the first place. 
But I'm lucky I did. 
I am lucky to have made friends that I never would have known were it not for The Observer. 
Some I see for 10 minutes a week. Some I say hi to every morning when I walk into the office with my lunch to work on a story. And some I talk to every day and spend Saturday nights in April with chat­ting at Nick's Patio over eggs benedict. 
I am also lucky to work with a staff of about 150 people who give at least a part of themselves to this paper. 
Some work for just an hour or two writ­ing one short article a week. Some dream up a new cartoon every day. Some sit in the back of The Observer's office reading stories until two in the morning. Some go to Debartolo 101 on a Wednesday night to photograph a lecture. 
No matter who they are, I know that everybody at The '0' is proud when they walk into LaFortune on a Friday after­noon and see the paper in everyone's hands. 
The Observer has become a large part of Notre Dame since its beginning 40 years ago -and my biggest challenge over the next year will be to make sure it remains an integral piece of Notre Dame/Saint Mary's campus life. 
But with the people working here right now, I have no doubt the paper will be fine. 
Growing up with two little sisters and no brother, I spent a lot of time with my dad -iffor no other reason than we were the only people in my house who didn't watch E.R. 
The two of us talked about a lot over the last 21 years-with topics ranging from who should have won the 1995 Heisman Trophy (Tommie Frazer) to when I had to be home on New Year's Eve as a high school sophomore (too early) to whether Paul Simon was better solo or with Garfunkel (solo). 
But I never learned more from a con­versation than I did on that jog over Christmas break.

Bicyclist fakes blindness 
SAN RAFAEL, Calif. -A motorist accused of blinding a bicyclist in a hit-and-run acci­dent was cleared of charges after a doctor determined the victim was faking his injury. 
James Arrigoni, 45, of San Anselmo, had been accused of swerving his pickup truck into a cyclist who made an obscene gesture with his fin­ger a year ago. 
Torrin Arnold, 26, of San Anselmo claimed he hit his head on the pavement and lost his vision. 
He appeared at Arrigoni's court hearings wearing dark glasses and using a cane, and attended Braille school and

Park to play the classics 
HARTFORD, Conn. ­Residents of one Hartford neighborhood hope Beethoven and Mozart will help drive drug dealers and prostitutes out of a local park. 
Activists propose playing recordings of classical music in Barnard Park in hopes of annoying petty criminals so much that they'll leave. They also hope the music will make the park more pleasant for other people once it is cleaned up. 
Resident Carol Coburn said she came up with the idea after reading about similar efforts in West Palm Beach, Fla., where she said crime decreased as much as 40 percent in parks where clas­sical music was played.

Scientists struggle to save chimps 
MBIIIE-MOKELE, Congo -Scientists are struggling to save the fast-disappearing bonobo, the gentle "hippie chimp" known for rnsolving squabbles through sex rather than violence. 
Unfortunately, bonobos are prized by Congolese for their tasty meat, and many vil­lagers who are illegally hunting the wiry, wizen-faced apes don't realize how close their prey is to extinetion. 
"Bonobos are an ieon for peace and love, tlw world's 'hippie chimps,"' said Sally Coxe of the Washington-based Bonobo Conservation Initiative. "To let them die ofT would be a catastrophe." 
Tlw animals are known for greeting rival groups with genital handshakes and sensual body rubs. Bonobo spats are swiftly settled -often with a Fn~nch kiss and a quick round of sex.

Politicians call for a new leader 
Shiite prime minister al-Jaafari faces pressure to recall his bid for a new term 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -Sunni Arab and Kurdish politicians increased pressure Sunday on Shiite Prime Minister Ibrahim ai-Jaafari to aban­don his bid for a new term, while leaders of Iraq's Shiite m<~jority struggled to overcome growing internal divisions. 
Despite the squabbling, them wern reports the new parliament would be called into session for the first time as early as the end of the week, starting the clock on a 60-day period during which it would have to elect a president and approve a prime minister and Cabinet. 
Tho struggln to form a broad-basf~d governing coalition acceptable to all the country's main groups has bmm furthnr hampered by the surge in sectarian conllict. 
Targeted sectarian vio­lnnce killnd at least five peopln Sunday. Throe men died in a gunf'ight at a Sunni mosque in Baghdad and two relatives of a top Sunni deric were slain in a drive-by shooting. Sunnis accused deaths squads allied to the interim govern­ment, allegations denied by the Shiite-dominated Interior Ministry. 
U.N. envoy to Iraq Ashraf Johangir Qazi expressed serious concern Sunday about human rights in the country, citing reports of excessive use of force, ille­gal detention centers and disappearances -many of them the responsibility of insurgents. 
The political turmoil has left a dangerous leadership vacuum as Iraq's armed forces, backed by the U.S. military, battle to contain sectarian violence that has pushed Iraq toward civil war. 
The Pentagon's top gen­eral said Sunday he did not think a full-blown civil con­flict would break out, although he acknowledged "anything can happen." 

"I do not believe it has deep roots. I do not believe that they're on the verge of civil war," Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
A day earlier, the com­mander of the U.S. mili­tary's Central Command, Gen . .John Abizaid, said sflc­tarian divisiveness had been worsened by the bombing of a rcwered Shiite shrine in Samarra last month and was a threat to Iraq's stability. 
During a meeting with Iraqi leaders Saturday, Abizaid urged them to resolve the differences stalling the formation of a government. 
"The shrine bombing 
exposed a lot of sectarian fissures that have .been apparent for a while, but it was the lirst time I've seen it move in a direction that was unhelpful to the politi­cal process," Abizaid said afterward. 
The U.S. government sees a government with partici­pation across Iraq's com­munities as a key step toward improving security and weakening support for insurgents, which would allow Washington and its allies to lower troop num­bers. 
Under the constitution, the Shiites' United Iraqi Alliance, the largest bloc in parliament, has the first crack at forming a govern­ment and chose ai-Jaafari as its nominee for prime minister. 
But the Alliance has too few seats to ad alone. 1\nd it is facing a drive by Sunni, Kurdish and some secular parties that want to prevent ai-Jaafari from continuing at the end of the govern­ment, favoring instead cur­rent Vice President 1\dil Abdui-Mahdi. 
Abdui-Mahdi lost in tho Shiite caucus by one vote to al-Jaafari, who won with the support of radical doric Muqtada ai-Sadr. Abdui­Mahdi is backed by 1\bdui­Aziz al-llakim, a powerful Shiite leader who is fre­quently at odds politically with ai-Sadr. Both have strong militias bnhind them.

Childhood obesity slated to rise 
Associated Press 
LONDON -The number of over­weight children worldwide will increase significantly by the end of the decade, and scinntists expect profound impacts on everything from public health earn to e c o n o m i e s , a s t udy p u b I is h.e d Monday said. 
Nearly half of the children in North and South America will be overweight by 2010, up from what recent studies say is about one­third, according to a report pub­lished by the International Journal of Pediatric Obesity. 
In the European Union, about 38 percent of all children will be overweight if present trends con­tinue -up from about 25 percent in recent surveys, the study said. 
"We have truly a global epidemic which appears to be affecting most countries in the world," said Dr. Philip James, chairman of the

and author of an editorial in the journal warning of the trnnd. 
Tho percentages of ovnrwnight children also are nxpneted to increase signif'ieantly in tho Middle East and Southeast Asia. Mexico, Chilo, Brazil and Egypt have rates comparable to fully industrialized nations, James said.

Mittal Steel Co. plans merger 
Executives cater to European reporters in effort to promote bid for Arcelor SA 
Associated Press 

CIIICAGO -A rival's gibe comparing its product to cheap cologne sent Mittal Steel Co. executives to the southern end of Lake Michigan with foreign jour­nalists in tow last week to show oil' the expensive stuff. 
If the Dutch steelmaker's charm offensive suc­ceeds, the high-end "per­fume"manuf'actured at its plant in Burns I !arbor, Ind., will smell sweet enough to skeptics to ease resistance to its hostile takeover bid for European competitor Arcnlor SA. 
But even if it fails and the largest-ever proposed steel mergnr goes sour, experts say that won't stop Mittal's relentless global buying spree -or further consoli­dation of' the fragmented steel industry. 
"They're not done by any means," said stnel industry analyst Scott Burns of Morningstar Inc. 
Combining Mittal and Luxembourg-based Arcelor, the two biggest steel manu­facturers, would create a company with production capacity of nearly 130 mil­lion tons a year, 3 1/2 times the output of the nearest competitor.

West Nile virus does not increase defects 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO Pregnant women who get West Nile virus likely will have normal babies. although a small risk of birth defects can't be com­pletely ruled out, according to the first publishod report from a multistate registry. 
Researchers at the federal Centors for Disease Control and Prevention called their report "somewhat reassur­ing" but said pregnant womon still should bn espe­cially careful to follow pre­cautions, including staying indoors when mosquito activ­ity is high and wearing repel­lent during mosquito season. 
Of 72 infants in 16 states whose mothers had West Nile during pregnancy, only three had problems that might have been linked with expo­sure to the virus before birth, according to 2003-2004 data from the registry. 
Two had abnormally small heads and one was born with an extra toe. In all three eases, the mothers had fevers but otherwise relatively mild cases of West Nile. 
One of the small-headed infants had severe birth defects and died three days after birth, but the other appeared to grow out of the problem and was developing normally by age 1. 
None of the infants studied "had conclusive laboratory evidence" of developing West Nile virus infection from their mothers, although scientists are uncertain how effective current tests are at detecting West Nile infection at birth, according to the report, being published Monday in ·the March edition of Pediatrics. 
Because of circumstantial evidence, "we couldn't say with confidence they (birth problems) were not caused by West Nile virus," said CDC researcher and co-author Daniel O'Leary. 
That evidence includes tim­ing of the mothers' infections. The mother of the extra-toe baby had West Nile fever 
early in pregnancy, when development of fingers and toes occurs. The other two mothers got sick during mid­pregnancy. 
Seven. or 10 percent of the infants, had major birth defects including Down syn­drome and cleft palate, about double the rate in the general population, but prevalence of miscarriages and premature births was lower than in the general population. However, the researchers believe only the three cases might be linked to the virus. 
CDC-funded research is investigating whether any of the women had other factors that might have increased their risks for having chil­dren with birth defects, O'Leary said. 
The CDC collects nation­wide data on pregnant women infected with West Nile disease, the mosquito­borne virus that has been report­ed in humans in at least 42 states. 
The states involved in the new report are Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. 
Most infected people never get sick, but up to about 20 percent develop mostly mild flu-like symptoms. Severe symptoms, including some­times fatal brain inflamma­tion, are rare. Since 1999, when the virus first appeared in this country, 782 West Nile deaths have been reported nationwide. 
Dr. Shari Goldman, an obstetrician affiliated with Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital, said none of her pregnant patients have developed West Nile though some have asked how they can avoid the disease. 
"I raise it as a concern that they should think about, however I do not want to alarm my patients because the risk of them contracting West Nile virus is low," Goldman said.

High tuition troubles the poor 
Programs make college more affordablefor low, middle income students 
Associated Press 
The signs are everywhere, from the BMWs parked on campus, to the students' designer cell phones, to the number of families paying full price ~wen as tuition and fees climb past $40,000. The most prestigious colleges are over­whelmingly attended by the wealthy. 
It's a problem collnges are speaking about more frankly and have tried to address with more l'inancial aid, but with only mixed success. At the most selective schools, a 2003 study found, just 3 percent of stu­dents came from the poorest socio-economic quarter of fami­lies, while 74 percent came from the richest. 
Now, a small group of selec­tive colleges is turning its atten­tion to what may be an untapped reservoir of able, low-income students: the 6.5 million people who attend com­munity colleges. Historically, those students have been ignored by elite colleges, which recruit mostly at high schools and often accept few or no transfers because they want to offer a distinctive four-year experience. 
Five well-known private col­leges and three highly selective public schools -the flagship campuses of the Universities of Michigan, California and North Carolina -were to announce plans Monday to accommodate a total of about 1,100 more community college transfer stu­dents from low-to moderate­income families over the next four years. The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation will con­tribute about $7 million for support programs, while the colleges will spend more than $20 million of their own money on support programs and financial aid. 

The private colleges partici­pating are Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Bucknell, Cornell and the University of Southern California. 
Though the numbers amount to a relative handful -with Cal taking by far the most transfers -the hope is that the variety and prestige of the schools involved will persuade others to take a chance on students who have started at two-year schools for financial or family reasons. 
"There's a lot of focus at Harvard and lots of other places on the fact that there are no low-income students at those schools, or very few," said Joshua Wyner, the Cooke Foundation's vice president for programs. 'The place where a lot of them are that nobody senms to be looking is commu­nity colleges." 
A 2005 Department of Education study found more than one-third of 12th graders in 1992 who went first to com­munity college and earned more than 10 credits eventually transferred to a four-year col­lege. But few go to the most selective schools. On those campuses, typically only about one in 1,000 students trans­ferred from a two-year school, Wyner said. 
Some of the participating col­leges, like Cal and Mount Holyoke, already have close ties with "feeder" community col­leges and will expand existing programs. Mount Holyoke, a women's college in Massachusetts, will provide a full-time academic counselor inside nearby Holyoke Community College to identify transfer candidates and help them prepare. It hopes to add about 10 slots per year.

Just when it looked as though fierce partisanship and violent faction were going to leave America's democracy in shambles, two vastly different groups arose from the political mire and took the first steps toward ensuring that the States of America stay United well into the future. 
Who were they? Black H.epublicans (no, it's not an oxy­moron) and Catholic Democrats. 
It's no secret that GOP Chairman Ken Mehlman has been fighting hard to rally African-American voters back into "the party of Lincoln" since the realization that President George W. Bush's share of the black vote climbed from 9 to 11 percent in 2004. In the tumultuous aftermath of Hurricane Katrina -in which 59 percent of the victims were black -he has had to work extra hard, speaking in 46 minority communities and publicly schmoozing with influen­tial black leaders like boxing promoter Don King. 
While the fruits of his labors will go largely unnoticed until November, the emergence of several African-American candidates for major political seats this year is the first sign that the black vote may no longer necessarily be a lock for the Democrats. 
In Pennsylvania, for instance, former Pittsburgh Steeler Lynn Swann is attempting to become only the second black governor in U.S. history-and the first ever from the H.epublican Party. He is currently neck and neck with incumbent Ed Rendell, according to most polls, and the implications of a black H.epublican governor in a major swing state could certainly throw a wrench into Democrats' plans to take back the White House in 2008. 
The same situation goes for neighbor­ing Ohio, where the African-American Secretary of State Ken Blackwell is seeking the governorship in a state

where Bush's black support soared from 9 percent to an estimated 16 per­cent in 2004. 
While some Democrats might be shiv­ering in their boots at the thought of losing their most reliable voting bloc, the reality is that this shift in party loy­alty could work wonders for America's minority populations. After years of "entrenchment" in the Democratic Party -a period in which many argue that Democrats only paid lip service to black causes and never really legislated in their favor-African Americans have finally decided to make their vote mean something by giving up their sta­tus as single-issue (racial politics) vot­ers and shifting toward a moderate independent position. 
Of course, the memory of the implicit racism of the GOP's "southern strategy" will be hard to shake. (Who can forget H.epublican Senator Trent Lott's foolish decision to declare in 2003 that America "wouldn't have had all these problems over these years" if the segre­gationist Strom Thurmond had been elected president in 1948?) Still, if black voters are willing to put the past behind them and instead focus on real issues -like the fact that black unem­ployment has actually fallen under Bush's leadership-it will only force both parties to fight harder to receive their support. 
On the other side of the aisle, Catholic Democrats made a similar move toward moderation last week when they released a "Statement of Principles by Fifty-Five Catholic Democrats in the 
U.S. House of H.epresentatives." In an effort to fight back against being labeled "good Catholics" or "bad Catholics" based on the single issue of abortion, these 55 Representatives (who included some of the staunchest pro-lifers in Congress) tried to empha­size the importance of other issues ­like social justice, poverty, war and the death penalty -to their Catholic faith. 
While still admitting that they sought "policies that encourage pregnancies to be carried to term" because of "the undesirability of abortion," these Democrats seemed to be imploring the Catholic electorate to expand its voting decisions beyond the single issue of abortion in order to elect representa­tives who will light for a variety of faith-based issues in Congress. Not only does this send a strong signal to the Catholic bishops who unnecessarily campaigned from their altars in 2004 by claiming that John Kerry's pro­choice stance meant that he should not receive communion, but it also suggests to Catholic voters -who have been slowly shifting their loyalties toward the Republican Party since 1952 -that their political influence can be dramati­cally increased if they are not seen as a single-issue, "sure-thing" voting bloc. 
These shifts toward independence, moderation and multiple-issue voting represent an extremely positive move for both African Americans and Catholics. After all, history has shown that when a particular group becomes too entrenched in one political party, the issues that are most important to them are often ignored by legislators who no longer have to fight for their votes. 
Beyond these two groups, though, the significance of these tiny political realignments could suggest a coming end to the single-issue divisiveness that has made political conversations impos­sible and bipartisan agreement unimaginable over the past decade. Only when African Americans can step outside the sphere of racial politics, Catholics can step outside the box of right-to-life politics and neoconserva­tives can step outside the brave new world of global democratization politics will a majority of Americans be able to agree with the political direction of their democracy. 
Unless someone thinks that 34 per­cent of the public supporting the presi­dent constitutes a democratic majority.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Mendoza policy offends transfer student 
When I received my letter of accept­ance into the University this past sum­mer, I thought it meant that I was a Notre Dame student. Like all the fresh­man "star students" that were privi­leged enough to be accepted into such a prestigious school, I was issued an ID card, assigned to a dorm room and was helped when scheduling my classes. The only difference between my experi­ence and that of Notre Dame's other future alumni was that I was a transfer. No problem, right? I didn't think so. I fit right into the "Notre Dame family" but, apparently, the joke was on me. 
According to the recent Observer article "Mendoza rejects 'gates,' exter­nal transfers," (March 3) the Mendoza School of Business does not see stu-

dents from "external schools" as Notre Dame students. The article failed to mention, however, that transfer stu­dents cannot declare business as a major until completing a full year at the University. I cannot help but feel a bit offended by Dean Carolyn Woo's claim, "We're not obligated to take external transfers." What I fail to understand is why it should even be seen as an obligation to admit an intel­ligent, hard-working transfer student into a certain major. Woo continues saying, "We should serve Notre Dame students before external students." I am now enrolled in the University, which means that I am now a Notre Dame student.

I understand that Mendoza has to cut their numbers down. I do not under­stand why the incredibly diverse trans­fer class that I was fortunate enough to be a part of was offended. Don't get me wrong, I am happy reading my Aristotle and Shakespeare as I study the liberal arts, but please at least rec­ognize me as a Notre Dame student.

U-WIRE Music isn't what it used to be, but change is on the way 
It is often said that music is the universal language. That or math, I can't remember which one. Or maybe it's both. Whatever. 
Anyway, uni­versal language Doug Scott or not, music has found a way to

guistic bound­arins. 
This can be seen everywhere you look, such as kids singing "The Maearena" at a high school homncoming dance or the Mexican guys l'vn worked with lhn past two summers singing along to "My Heart Will Go On" during their luneh break. 
As beautiful a phenomenon as music is, it, along with pretty much everything in this world (nxcept for Chipotle), has a dark side. 
I'm not talking about rap music that critics say cause misogyny among youth (it doesn't) or indus­trial metal that others say cause teenagers to shoot up their schools (it doesn't). I'm talking about bad music. 
Heally bad music. 
What is really bad musie, you ask? The stock answer from most music elitists would be to simply turn on MTV, and they would be right. 
llowever, unless you tune your tnlevision to the "musie" ehannel early in thn morning, you will not see any music videos, and "Meet the Barkers" doesn't serve as a good ease study for the state of modern pop music. But if you've ever eaten a meal in Commons, you know what I'm talking about. 
Two years ago, when I lived in Blanding II, I was often subjected to the sonic filth that poured 

fourth from televisions around 
thA dining hall. As if "I Love the 
Way You Move" wasn't annoying 
enough already, it can truly drive 
a person mad when they hear it 
at least six times a day. 
But this column isn't meant to pick on OutKast, a group that I believe has good intentions at heart. I'm here to address the other senseless pap that most of you uncultured swine on campus listen to. 
I'm talking about bands like Niekelback, Creed, My Chemieal Homance, Simple Plan, Evanescence, Toby Keith, Ashley Simpson, Gretchen Wilson, Bright Eyes ... I could go on, but I don't think I need to. 
Whether it's prepackaged pop music or some random guy who plays guitar and only writes songs about ex-girlfriends, the standard by whieh music is judged today has been lowered dramatically from where it once stood in the past. 
Although some of this has to do with the democratization of musie and the availability of recording equipment, this sort of develop­ment should be a good thing. 
However, this revolution, along with giving many musicians the opportunity to make and distrib­ute music in an environment where they previously were unwelcome, also gives many unsavory musicians the opportu­nity to ravage your eardrums with what they will constantly refer to as their "art." 
For example, I'm sure at one point in your time at UK you've seen a poor soul playing guitar and singing outside White Hall, the Student Center or even your dorm on a sunny day. These peo­ple must be stopped. 
Don't think that by any means I'm advocating a return to listen­ing to "oldies" or what have you. Some of music's greatest traves­ties were committed before any of us were even born (think The Eagles, John Denver, post-Genesis Phil Collins). 
What I am proposing, however, is a return to what makes music music, such as, I don't know, playing your own instruments. Or, egad, writing your own songs. Or ... wait wait wait ... doing some­thing original for once. 
The John Mayer Trio may be superior to most live aets in the field of musieianship, but I've already heard their aet before when it was called Stevie Ray Vaughn. In much the same fash­ion, The Killers sounded a lot better when they were called 1980-1989 and rap only sounds good under the names De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, and the Sugarhill Gang. 
The Barenaked Ladies onee said in a song as equally moronic as their name, "It's all been done before." They're right. If I have to hear another band trying to be the next Incubus, Limp Bizkit, 
O.A.H. or Dashboard Confessional, I am going to gouge my ears with a skewer. 
There is a musical revolution on the horizon, and it doesn't involve guys wearing girls' jeans, cowboy hats, hemp necklaces or over­sized black jeans with chains. Prepare thyself.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 


Basketball response 

I am writing in response to the recent let­ter to the editor coneerning Mike Brey, the men's basketball coach, written by John F. Chute, class of' 1976 ("Higher standards for men's basketball" March 1). 
Before I begin, let it be known that I work at DeMatha Catholic Iligh School. Brey's alma mater. I also attended DeMatha with Brey so I make no bones about being an avid supporter of the basketball team. 
What surprises me is that the student newspaper would print such an Arror-f'illed, arrogant letter by an angry alum who clearly has an agenda. 
Permit me if you will as I would like to dispute a few of' Chute's points. 
1. 
This is Notre Dame's 11th season in The Big East (not 14th). Without question, The Big East is the best basketball confer­ence in the nation. Without taking anything away from Digger Phelps, but Coach Phelps's t~~ams played a much easier inde­pendent sehedule. 

2. 
The author's contention that he is not qualified to analyze basketball and tlwn proceeding to give his lengthy orror-J'illed analysis. I thought Notre Dame grads wore smarter than that. 

3. 
His assertion that a "prima donna" brought down the squads of '05 and '04 without recognizing what that same "prima donna" did in his first two years at Notre Dame. 

4. 
His absurd comparison of' the recent Marquette-Notre Dame game to that of a matchup of the Harlem Globetrotters­Washington Generals. If' you recall, Notre Dame was leading in the Marquette game in the second half and finally lost by eight points, thanks to the efforts of a gifted opposing player. Having attended numorous Harlem Globetrotter games as a youth, I can assure you that the games I saw were never close to being competitive, as we all know. 

5. 
His criticism of Brey's eoaching against Arizona in the Sweet 16 a few years back. Perhaps the author should understand that there is a shot clock in eollege basketball! Furthermore, the last time I checked, the purpose of the game is to outscore your opponent! 

6. 
Ilis criticism of Athletic Director Kevin White's hiring of Brey despite the tremen­dous success Brey achieved as a head coaeh at the University of Delaware and as an assistant at Duke. 

7. 
His comment that Duke University had an inferior history of achievement in men's basketball prior to 1982. I ask the author to go do his research and see that Duke had Final Four appearances in both tlw 1960s and 1970s. 

8. 
His comment that the program is in a "vegetative state." Excuse me'? Three NCAA appearances and two NIT appearances, a vegetative state? What color is the sky in your universe? 

9. 
llis criteria for the contract of a htutd basketball coach. I can assure you that no coach in America, including Coach K of Duke, would ever sign a contract saying that he must finish in the Top 10 of the national rankings each year. 

10. 
llis conclusion that Notre Dame was not going to make The Big East Tournament. Way to jump ship and support your alma mater. 


As I said before, I am a Brey apologist. I understand the losses have been very tough this year and home attendance is down a fraction. But let's l'aee it, Notrn Dame has been competing very well at the highest of levels and has missed success by the nar­rowest of margins. And I havn to belinvn that the Irish are getting good TV ratings. 
Go Irish!

CONCERT REVIEW 
Chieftains' powerful music energizes campus 
By SEAN SWEANY Scene Writer 
Young and old celebrated together when The Chieftains visited the Leighton Concert Hall in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center (DPAC) Thursday night. The four decade old group understands the power of collab­orative effort in music and included other musicians, dancers and even the audience to create a night of wonderful music and memories. 
The Chieftains, under the lead of the energetic uilleann pipes and tin whistle player Paddy Moloney, combined their legendary talent with Irish harpist Triona Marshall. guitarist Jeff White and fiddle player/Irish dancer Jon Pilatzke. They were also joined by The Cottars, two young brother-sister pairs from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia and the Notre Dame Symphony Orchestra. This diverse group was led by Moloney, who was in his element performing and leading the toe tapping songs. 
The concert began with The Chieftains playing some of their tradi­tional songs from various albums. The group is renowned for it's unique ability to combine Irish music with other forms of folk music and this was showcased when they performed the bluegrass song "Country Blues" with guitarist Jeff White. The group also played a lively song combining Oriental and Irish melodies called "Full of Joy" from The Chieftains' tour of China. 
When The Chieftains were joined by The Cottars, Moloney began telling jokes and the energy in the theater rose to a new level. The teenage group from Canada held their own sharing the stage with The Chieftains and won the audience with their remarkable talent for singing, dancing and playing their respective instruments at the same time. The most memorable song the two groups played was the Irish elassic "The Rocky Road to Dublin," complete with rock concert-like spotlights sweep­ing the theater. 
After an intermission, The Chieftains were joined by the Notre Dame Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Daniel Stowe. Together, the groups per­formed several pieces written by Paddy Moloney. First was "Long Journey Home" a song about the Great Famine composed by Moloney for a television series about the Irish in America. The musicians were joined by the Notre Dame choral group Collegium Musicum, who added renditions of "Shenandoah" and "Anthem" to the moving song. Afterwards, Moloney listed this as one of the best performances of "Long Journey Home" ever. 
Another of Moloney's arrangements called "Planxty Mozart" was a humor­ous song where a French horn player, backed by the Orchestra, played a Mozart tune in a musical duel with an Irish jig performed by The Chieftains. After several minutes of back and forth competition, the two sides found a har­monium and were joined by Irish dancers to finish the rousing song. 
After the main program, which will be performed again by all parties at New York City's Carnegie Hall on St. Patrick's Day, The Chieftains left the stage to thunderous applause. For an encore, Moloney asked that the house lights be brought up so that the audi-ence could join in an Irish jig per­formed by the entire ensemble. Before long, nearly the entire audience, both young and old, was in the aisles of the theater, dancing to the driving rhythm of the Irish song. Perhaps no one enjoyed the festivity more than Paddy Moloney, who was grinning from ear to ear while playing his tin whistle. After the song ended and the musicians departed, the entire audience gave The Chieftains a standing ovation long after the band left the stage. As the audience filed out of the Leighton Concert Hall Thursday night, the energetic music of The Chieftains had performed its expected magic by bringing the same youthful enthusiasm to every spectator in a night that will not be forgotten for a long time.

SHOW REVIEW 

Martin's 'new-age' comedy delights, appeals to young crowds 
By CASSIE BELEK 
Scene Writer 

Demetri Martin has some jokes and he tells them well. In addition to telling these jokes, Martin also plays instru­ments. He did both Saturday night at Legends to a room so packed that peo­ple were even sitting on the floor. 
Martin, who is well on his way to becoming an established comic, excels in the lost art of telling jokes. While other comedians present lengthy sce­narios with the punch line at the end, Martin, an observational comedian, presents a series of unrelated jokes like "I think the worst time to have a heart attack is during a game of charades," and "Sometimes I wonder what would Jesus do for a Klondike bar." 
As a graduate of Yale University, he dropped out of NYU Law School after only a few months because he thought it was boring. He became an intern for "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" and later worked as a sketch writer for "Late Night with Conan O'Brien." Recently he has made comic appear­ances on "Comedy Central Presents," "The Late Show with David Letterman" and "Late Night with Conan O'Brien." Martin is currently the resident trendspotter for "The Daily Show," which he has mixed feelings on because he said now he actually has to pay attention to trends. 
Martin's performance began with a short animated film he created high­lighting "Lesser Known Mythical Creatures." Then Martin emerged from behind the curtains and interacted with the audience before beginning his actu­al set. He thrives on spontaneity and improvisation, which was apparent as he pointed out audience members and made fun of them, even though he said he hates it when comics do that. Martin can take anything in the room and make a joke of it instantly, from a green exit sign to the name "Legends." 
Martin is among a new crop of alter­native comedians who rely on a more aware audience to understand their type of humor. They break tradition by including short films, musical instru­ments and various props to create comedy that makes the audience think rather than just listen and laugh. They are breaking the rules of traditional comedy and younger audiences are there to embrace them. 
On Saturday night, Martin played the keyboard and the guitar while deliver­ing some of his jokes. During his key­board segment, however, he seemed to lose his connection with the audience. One could almost picture him perform­ing alone in his bedroom rather than in front of a large crowd. Martin seemed bored and tired, but revived the show later with his guitar playing in which he shouted at and called up an annoy­ing audience member named James. It was a moment of intense awkward­ness, but Martin turned it into one of the funniest parts of the evening. 
After his set, Martin took audience questions, increasing the intimacy between him and the crowd. He spoke of run-ins with other comedians, including the recently passed away Mitch Hedburg, and he called Conan O'Brien and Jon Stewart two of the best bosses someone could have. After answering questions, he took pictures and signed autographs. 


Martin displayed his comedic talents to an eager and thankful audience. When he questioned why one audience member was recording his set, the young man answered that Martin was the best thing to come to Legends this year. 
A joke seldom failed, and when it did, Martin was as self-deprecating as Conan O'Brien, displaying his laid-back attitude but also great confidence that the audience wouldn't reject him. Students don't often get the chance to see professional comedians in person, and Martin provided his brand of humor and increased his growing fan base.

MOVIE REVIEW 

'Flores de Otro Mundo' goes beyond typical foreign fare 
By MICHELLE FORDICE 
Scene Writer 
"l."lores de Otro Mundo". or "Fiowr.rs J.'rorn Anothor World," addresses racism, the dillkultins in the search for compan­ionship and the meaning of family through the Inns of a small rural village in Spain. Despite these heavy underlying tlwmns, dirnctor and writer lefar Bollafn still allows the lilm a realistic balance with a littln humor, sweetness and hope. 
As the opening 
from the men who see her primarily as a sex object and comes to Damian, an unassuming and quiet man, whom she hopes can become a father to her two children. But Patricia is haunted by both her past and her struggles with Damian's domineering and disapproving mother. Finally, Marirosi and Alfonso begin a sweet courtship, but the long distance nature of their relationship and Marirosi's ties back to the city prevent them from taking further steps.

ply because they 
are hoping for a romantic lling, but rather because they need Spanish husbands who will protect them from the constant demand for identification papers that relentlessly debilitates their lives. However, these women are often seen as sex objects because of both their gender and their ethnicity. 
"Flores de Otro Mundo" is also a state­ment about the human need for compan­ionship, particularly the relationship between a husband and wife. "Flores de Otro Mundo" often does this by painting all the wrong ways relationships can exist, but also through the great celebra­tion that occurs when each bus full of women arrives -a band follows them as they are paradod through the stroots and children look on them with amaze­ment. 

"Flores de Otro Mundo" also approaches the subject of family. The audience watehes as 
Patricia takes great risks for the sake of her children after their father left them and struggles with Damian's moth­er, Milady longs for the family she tore herself away from for the chance of a better life and as people band together to make their own families, even if they aren't actually related. 
Despite its depressing themes, "Flores de otro mundo" does not devolve into melodrama and manages to remain a buoyant and enjoyable film. It is spiced with jokes (some dirty, some sweet) and an upbeat soundtrack. One cannot help but laugh at Milady's interesting choke of fashion or the two old men that wan­der the village, watching the escapades of all the movie's central eouples, just waiting for something intnrnsting to hap­. pen. Finally, "Flores de Otro Mundo" does not end without hope. Some things are left unlinished and some things arr. brokr.n, but love has not disappeared. 
Don't let the subtitles and foroign set­ting scare you, the themes of "Flores de Otro Mundo" and facets of life it reveals are universal.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The NFL and its players' union broke off talks Sunday evening, leaving dozens of veterans in danger of becoming salary-cap casu­alties before free agency begins a minute after mid­night Monday. 
The breakdown, though surprising, was typical of the topsy-turvy negotia­tions, so far: Just when things seemed darkest, they got back on track; and when it appeared a deal could be struck, talks broke down. As they did when the union called off the talks. 

"The talks ended after the NFL gave us a proposal which provided a percent­age of revenues for the players which would be less than they received over the last 12 years," said Gene Upshaw, execu­tive director of the NFL Players Association. "Arter suggesting we extend the waiver deadline from six o'clock to 10 this evening, they gave us a new pro­posal which was worse than their prior oll'er. Quite naturally, we rejected that proposal and saw no need to continue meeting." 
But llarold Henderson, the NI'J.'s executive vice president for labor rela­tions, said the union rejected a proposal that would have added $577 million for players in 2006 compared to 2005 and $1.5 billion in the six years of the extension. "It's an unfortunate situation for the players, the fans and the league," Henderson said.The cuts started almost immediately. 
Oakland eut quarterback Kerry Collins, saving $9.2 in cap space. Center Kevin Mawae was cut by the New York Jets, although he probably would have been gone anyway because he is 35 and missed the final 10 games of last sea­son with a triceps injury,

Offense struggles in the Metrodome 
By KEN FOWLER and 
HEATHER 
VAN HOEGARDEN 
Spons Writers 
Notre Dame suffered two shutouts and scored just one run in this weekend's Dairy Queen Classic at the Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minn., ending a streak of 215 games in which the Irish had scored at least once. 
After Nebraska blew out Notre Dame 11-1 Friday, the Irish sur­rendered eight runs to host Minnesota Saturday and lost an extra-innings affair with Arizona Sunday, leaving the team on a five-game losing streak. 
"Confidence is a very fragile thing," Irish coach Paul Mainieri said. "Obviously, it's frustrating when we only score one run in three games -it's hard to win." 
Arizona 2, Notre Dame 0 (10) 
Notre Dame found its pitching groove Sunday behind Jeff Manship's 10 strikeouts and Jeff Williamson's perfect inning in relief, but the bats failed to pro­duce for the Irish as they fell 2-0 to Arizona in 10 innings to drop their fifth straight. 
The Wildcats used a hit bats­men, a triple and a sacrifice fly in the tenth to score their two runs in the fmal contests for the two teams in the Dairy Queen Classic. 
With no outs in the extra frame, second baseman Brad Boyer tripled home third base­man Colt Sedbrook off Irish reliever Kyle Weiland, and Arizona's Jason Donald drove in Boyer with a sacrifice fly to cen­ter. 
"Kyle Weiland was really good," Mainieri said. "But sooner or later, something has to break." 
Notre Dame looked like it would get on the board early, but a strong defensive play kept the game scoreless. 
On a 2-2 count, Irish freshman first-baseman Jeremy Barnes lined a two-out single to right field in the first, but Arizona's John Gaston threw Brett Lilley out at the plate, ending the bot­tom of the inning. 
Barnes' single was the first Irish hit with a runner on base since Friday but failed to get Lilley across. Barnes finished 3-4 on the afternoon. 
"Unfortunately, the runner got thrown out at the plate, but that was a big hit," Mainieri said. "If he doesn't get thrown out at the plate, maybe when we get that first run, we relax a little bit more and pull through." 
Manship gave up just three hits and two walks in six innings before handing the ball over to Williamson in the· seventh. Manship's 10 strikeouts were a career high and the most by an Irish mound-dweller since Tom Thornton struck out 12 Golden Flashes in a 2004 NCAA elimina­tion game. 
"Jeff Manship today was absolutely phenomenal," Mainieri said. "Joey Willimason was great when he came in for an inning." 
Minnesota 8, Notre Dame 0 
The host team not only defeat­ed but shutout Notre Dame on Saturday, as Minnesota (1-4) righthander Cole DeVries threw six shutout innings, giving up four hits and striking out three. 

"Even though we got shut out, I think we showed good signs at the plate," Mainieri said of his team's seven-hit performance. "We really hit the ball hard, so we've got to remain positive." 
The Irish were unable to con­vert on multiple scoring opportu­nities, going 0-for-7 at the plate with runners on base. The shutout marked the first time the Irish have been held scoreless since the 2002 season. 
'Things just didn't go well for us;" Mainieri said. "We had a couple chances early in the game but d.~dn't take advantage of them. 
Notre Dame righthander Jeff Samardzija got the loss after allowing five runs in four innings of work, evening his record to 1­
1. The Golden Gophers got on the board in the bottom of the second, pushing three runs across after a two-run double by freshman Nate Hanson, followed by an RBI single by Tony Leseman. In the fifth, the Golden Gophers added two more after two RBI doubles by Dan Lyons and Mike Mee. Minnesota fin­ished off the scoring in the sixth when it scored three more runs. 
Meanwhile, the Irish offense struggled, registering only seven hits, two of which were by short­stop Greg Lopez. 
"I have all the confidence in the world that things will be all right," Mainieri said. "This is so normal for us, to start slow. The important thing is that we keep our chins up and keep battling." 
No. 4 Nebraska 11, Notre Dame 1 
Nebraska rode the arm of its ace Joba Chamberlain on Friday, as he struck out 11 of the 25 bat­ters he faced in seven shutout innings. Chamberlain, rated by Baseball American as the nation's No. 12 pro prospect, gave up just three hits -all sin­gles -and one walk for Nebraska. 
Nebraska got on the score­board early, pushing one run across in the first, two in the sec­ond and four in the third against Notre Dame starter Tom Thornton. Thornton, who pitched seven scoreless innings last week against Indiana State, gave up seven runs on 10 hits in 2.1 innings, picking up the loss. 
Nebraska cleanup hitter Luke Gorsett hit for the cycle, going 4­for-5 with a single in the first, a homer in the third and a double in the fourth and a triple in the eighth. He had a part in five of his team's runs. 
"When we have a tough game like we did against Nebraska and have to turn around and play the next day, you hope that they can put it behind them," Mainieri said. 
Notre Dame avoided the shutout in the eighth when left­fielder Danny Dressman hit a one-out triple and centerfielder Alex Netty knocked him in with an RBI single. 
Notes: 
+ Irish standout catcher Sean Gaston injured his arm in Saturday's game and sat out Sunday against Arizona.

Irish beat Illini in third shutout of the season 
ND stays undefeated on the year by beating Illinois in another dominating performance at the Eck Tennis Pavillion 
By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Writer 
The No. 5 Irish (11-0) kept their undefeated record in tact as they shut out the No. 49 Illini -their third shutout this season. The win extends Notre Dame's streak to five straight matches against Big Ten Conference opponents. 
"We don't look at it as a shut out as much as a big victory," sophomore Brook Buck said. "It took a lot of fighting from u s " The Irish began this hard­fought contest by claiming two of the three doubles matches to earn the doubles point.

In singles, No. 27 Catrina Thomspon recorded a 6-4, 6-3 win over Harkins at No. 1. The win improved Thompson's record to 15-6 on the season.

Tvvo extra innings losses lovver tea111's record to even 7-7 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 

The Irish continued their season with a disappointing performance in Tulsa, Okla., this weekend, losing three of five games played in the Best Western Airport Festival and dropping their record to 7-7. 
Notre Dame lost its first game against No. 17 Nebraska, 5-3, in eight innings Friday. Despite leading into the seventh inning, the Irish, behind pitcher Heather Booth, gave up a crucial sacrifice fly to pinch hitter Brittany Pascale in the top of the sev­enth. Notre Dame was unable to post the winning run in the bottom of the seventh, and the game moved to extra innings. 
Although Booth was able to get the first two outs of the inning, a misplayed ground ball by third baseman Linda Kohan extended the Huskers' eighth, giving them the one extra out needed to start a rally. Nebraska tacked on three unearned runs in the inning, and Notre Dame could not respond in the bottom half, adding only one run. 
Notre Dame's second game, a 2-1 loss to Tulsa, showed more frustration at the plate for the Irish. The squad was only 4-for-26 as a team and failed to record an extra base hit. Notre Dame's only run came in the fourth, on an RBI single by shortstop Sara Schoonaert. But the Golden Hurricanes responded in the bottom of the fourth with RBis by left fielder Brook Smart and catcher Leanne Pepper. 
After the rally by Tulsa in the fourth, the Irish could not muster any offense, despite pitcher Brittany Bargar ­now 3-2 on the year-holding Tulsa to only the two runs with nine strikeouts in the game. 
The Irish bats awoke in the third game of the tournament, a 10-1 win over Northern Iowa in five innings. The

pitching duties for the Irish were split by Bargar, who picked up the win, and Kenya Fuemmeler, who gave up the only run. 
But Notre Dame's real strength in this game was at the plate. The Irish hit .444 as a team, scoring 10 runs on eight hits. Cleanup hitter Meagan Ruthrauff led the offense with a three-run home run in the first to start the scoring. 
Booth improved her record to 3-4 in Notre Dame's fourth game, a 5-2 win against 
Kansas. Booth continued to pitch well, giving up five hits and striking out 10 batters in a complete game win. 
The Irish opened the scoring in the fifth inning with a two­out rally that lead to four unearned runs. Although Notre Dame did provide its own hitting throughout the game, the team was able to take full advantage of the poorly-timed Jayhawk mis­cues, especially in the fifth.

Despite Duffy's early strug­gles, the Irish offense did not share in her troubles as it had for much of the season, scoring 31 points and shooting 41.4% from the field in the first half. In the final 4 7 seconds of the half, Notre Dame erased a seven-point deficit, and junior Crystal Erwin's lay up as time expired -set up by a long pass from senior Courtney LaVere -tied the contest heading into the break, 31-31.

In large part because of know it's going to be a fight the its seniors, Connecticut shot 62 whole time. I feel as long as I percent from the floor in the first half. 
"Connecticut's a great team," McGraw said afterwards. "They were just on." 
Despite already having two fouls, LaVere reentered the game with 3:59 to play and picked up her third foul 1:40 later before she could take a shot. 
"We weren't getting enough offense [out of our other play­ers]," McGraw said, explaining the LaVere's first half re-entry. "We felt like she was scoring, we weren't getting any production out of the other posts, so we needed to come back with her. She's smart enough to play with two fouls." 
Duffy was held to just three points in the first half-her sec­ond consecutive sub-par first half of the tournament. But much like she did during Notre Dame's 73-66 win over South Florida, she exploded in the sec­ond half, shooting 5-of7 from the floor and scoring a game-high 20 points. Duffy, a 5-foot-7 guard, also pulled down a team­high six rebounds. 
"I tried to be a little more aggressive in the second half, but really, I've got to learn to put two halves together," DuiTy said. "Especially at this point in the season, I've got to be able to carry a load offensively in the first half as well as the second half." 
Although it trailed by as many as 21 points in the second half, Notre Dame continued to play hard until the fmal buzzer. 
"We fought hard. I don't think we ever put our heads down and quit," McGraw said. "[We] brought it back to 11, and really, it should have been a little closer if we had just gotten a couple of little things, so, I was really proud of their efTort." 
McGraw was especially pleased with her team's per­formance given the setting, which, though officially a neutral site, was a de-facto home game for Connecticut. 
"I was really proud of the sen­iors, I thought they really fought hard," she said. "I think it's a tough environment for our play­ers to come in here and experi­ence that kind of crowd, and then play well." 
The Irish, who anticipate an NCAA tournament bid, will now wait until Selection Monday on March 13 to see who and where they will next play.

play[," Lavere said. 
McGraw was pleased after the game with the way her team played during Duffy's funk. 
"I thought to go in [to half­time] with a tie without Megan IDuffy] scoreless was really a great job by the rest of the team," she said. "I think in the last 4:18 we scored a lot of points, more than we normally do, just by attacking the bas­ket, so I think the rest of the team is starting to kind of rise to the occasion." 
For the second time this sea­son, the Irish had five players in double figures, as Duffy, LaVere, junior Tulyah Gaines, sophomore Charel Allen and freshman Lindsay Schrader all scored at least ten points. 
Schrader, who has shot just 50 percent from the free throw line this season, added two crucial foul shouts with 5:13 to play that cut the USF lead to 62-59 and helped add to her total of 14. 
"I just didn't think about, I just shot it," Schrader said. ''I've been thinking about [my free throws] too much so I just shot." 
The Irish did an excellent job containing South Florida for­ward Jessica Dickson, the nation's leading scorer. While Dickson managed to score 16 points, the Notre Dame defense held her to just 6-of-21 shoot­ing. 
"Dickson's one of the best players in the nation," McGraw said. "She didn't shoot the ball particularly well, but she still had a great game with a dou­ble-double." 
While the Irish focused their primary efforts on shutting down forward Jessica Dickson, freshman guard Shanita Grace stepped up in a big way for the Bulls, scoring a game-high 24 points and shooting 4-of-5 from beyond the arc. 
"I thought she just played a great game," McGraw said. "I think maybe [she was] trying to prove that she belonged on the all-rookie team." 
Notes: 
+The last time Notre Dame had five players in double fig­ures was on Dec. 18 against Utah in the Dual in the Desert. The Irish won that game 68­55.

Saturday night's shutout. 
Notre Dame continued to 
struggle with the power-play 
after going 0-f'or-16 in man 
advantage situations. The Irish 
have failed to eonvnrt on their 
last 30 chances, a streak dating 
baek live games to a series with 
Bowling Green. 
Both teams combined for 72 
minutes in the penalty box, cre­
ating nunwrous man advantage 
and four-on-li>ur situations. 
"The power play is the com­bination of players, and if those players all go into a slump at the same time, then you're going to have probloms," Irish head eoach Jef'f' Jaekson said. "It's not the time of' the year to make adjustments and ehange personnel. It's boon a staple of ours all year long, and I don't think people recognized how important it was to our team until those last fhur games." 
The Irish penalty kill negated 11 out of 12 Nanook chances in the two games (a 91.6-pereent success rate) -the lone power-play goal proving to be the decisive one in the 1-0 shutout. 
Alaska-Fairbanks 3 
Notre Dame 1 
The Nanooks secured the game-winning goal Friday night midway through the third period in a game characterized by physical play and dump­and-ehasn battles for puck pos­session. 
Fairbanks' Kelly Czuy scored a garb<tge goal to give the Nanooks the 2-1 lead at 11 :55 of' the third period. Defense man T.J. Campbell released a slap shot from the high left slot on Irish goalii1 Dave Brown that rebounded oil' Brown's lnft pad to just above the ereaso. 
Czuy roofed the puek over a scrambling Brown for the game-winner. 
"In the third, it boils down to the discipline of our hockey team," Jackson said. "We had a long shift and ended up with thn winning goal in our net." 
Notre Dame got on the board first with VeNard's goal at 
13:31 in the first frame. Christian Hanson won the f'aee­off in the Nanooks' zone and drew the puck back to Tim Wallace on top of the left circle. Wallace quickly redirected the puck to VeNard along the left boards, who stepped in low and dodged a Nanook defender below the circle. 
VeNard let go a wrist shot that denPcted off a Fairbanks' player and Hogers left leg pad into the far side of the net. 
"You take them any way you can get them," VeNard said. "It was nice. I would have liked it to been a little bit prettier, but anything to get the team on the board and get us going." 
The goal would prove to be the only one that Hogers allowed to pass the goal line in the two games. He made 22 saves in the opening game. 
"Obviously we have a hot goaltender on our hands," VeNard said after Friday's game. "There's evidence to my goal that we have to keep try­ing to throw stuff towards the net." 
Fairbanks tied the game at 1­1 at 5:51 into the second stanza on a Curtis Fraser one-timer. 
A turnover in the corner of Notre Dame's zone allowed Kyle Jones to feed the puek to Fraser on the right point. Fraser one-timed the puck at Brown, who attempted to fight through a screen to make the savn. Nathan Fornataro rndi­rected the puek on its way to the net to noteh the goal. 
The Nanooks sealc~d the game at 19:23 of tho third to make it :{-1 when Lueas Burnntt seornd an empty netter. 
Notre Damn came out firing through the first pnriod and prevented the Nanooks from enforcing their physical, def'on­sive style. llowevor tho second period found the Irish dead­locked yet again in smash mouth battles along the boards. 
"That's their game," .Jaekson said. "Their averago age is about 23, ours is probably about 19. It's men against boys in some situations." 
Thn Nanooks stmggled to set up in the Irish zone and rolied on a dump-and-ehase strategy to work tho puek past the Notre Dame defense stacked four­wide in the neutral zone. 
"You have to get the puek behind their team. I don't earn how you do it," Nanooks lwad eoaeh Tavis MaeMillan said. "You ean skate it, you ean pass it, you can ehip it. You can do anything want -throw it for all I earn. It's just got to gnt behind their def'ensemon." 
Tht~ Irish went 0-f'or-6 on the power play with four shots in those situations on Hogers for the game. 
Alaska-Fairbanks 1 Notre Dame 0 
Saturday night's game could simply be labeled the Wylie Hogers Show for the Fairbanks' goalie's 39 save performance. But that would be to ignore a gritty speeial teams battle ­whose lone goal eame off a fluke play -and a serious injury to goaltender Brown. 
Midway through the first period on a Notre Dame pownr play, Brown rushed out of his crease to just halfway between the blue line and the top of the left circle to clear the puck away from a guaranteed Fairbanks breakaway. 
Hight winger Braden Walls ­who had been charging for the puck -took Brown out at the knees and was whistled for a charging minor. Brown was unable to stand under his own power and was helped off the ice after several minutes. 
Freshman Jordan Pearce quickly warmed up and entered his first game since Feb. 17. lie had 15 saves on the night. It was the sixth career shutout for the sopho­more. 
"It's a eheap shot," Pearee said of the hit. ''I'm sure the guy wasn't intending to hurt him, but at the same time, when a goalie gnts hit it's nmlly an intentional thing." 
Jackson was angered by the referne's eall on the infraction, while MacMillan was confused at handing out. a charge eall to a playor sliding into a goalie out of tlw protnrtPd zorw, which 11nds at tho top of the drdns. 

"'1\vo-minute JWnalty for run­ning a goaltender," Jackson said of tho call. "lie deliberate­ly slid into him and took his lt~gs out from undnrnoath him. Two minutes for eliminating a goalie from a series." 
Fornataro broko his stick ­and the seorelnss doadloek ­with his powflr-play goal at 
19:04 of the socond period. Freshman defenseman Tyler Eekl'ord corralled tlw puck along the left sidn of tlw Irish zone and sent a eross ice pass to Fomataro just. lwlow tho eontor of the right cirde.

The Irish eountornd in thn third with continuous prnssure in thn Nanook zorw, but Hognrs shut the door on any and all ehanees with 17 saves in tho last 20 minutes. The Irish had 
4:16 of man advantago play in the pnriod. 
Hogers allowed only thrno goals in I I poriods against the Irish sinen entering in rnlief of Chad .Johnson in a 4-1 loss on Feb. 24. 
"For the most part we were rotating wnll, reading what they were doing," MaeMillan said of the penalty kill. "Wh11n we did screw up, Wylie was there to bail us out. Yom bnst penalty killer is your goal­tender." 
Notre Dame cnmtod several mass scrambles in front of Hogers where, at some points, all 10 skaters became bundwd up in front of the net.

St. John's Sunday afternoon, the Irish became the No. 12-seed in the upcoming confenmce tourna­ment held in New York City. Notre Dame now is scheduled for a first­round match up with No. 5-sfled Georgetown at 2 p.m. Wndnesday at Madison Square Garden. 
"It's been an up-and-down sea­son, not exactly the way we want­ed it to go," Irish forward Tarin Francis said after the game, his limtl at home in a Notre Dame uniform. "But early on in the sea­son, we talked about [how] our main goal was to go to the Big East tournament. And even though we had to fight down to our last game to get in, we're still in it." 
Francis (1 0 points, eight rebounds) nearly cost Notre Dame a late-game lead with 40.4 sec­onds remaining and the Irish up a possession, 62-59. The senior for­ward missed the front end of a one-and-one after Notre Dame coach Mike Brey elected to inbound to Francis (62.3 percent foul shooting) and leave Kyle McAlarney (90.9 percent) on the bench in a foul situation. 
Blue Demons center Marlon Brumfield made a put back of a Sammy Mejia miss on the ensuing possession to cut the Notre Dame lead to 62-61. But Falls then sank two free throws, and Carter hit two more after a DePaul miss to seal the victory. 

Carter scored eight straight points during a stretch in the mid­dle of the second half. The run began with two free throws at the 
16:34 mark and ended on a 3­pointer at 13:19, which gave Notre Dame a 47-39lead. 
The junior, who has been refer­enced several times as a possible ~andidate for Most Improved Player in the Big East this season, also locked down Mejia (23 points, 3-of-5 3-pointers) when he guard­ed him for the game's fmal 20-to­25 minutes, holding DePaul's main scoring threat to seven second half points. 
"Rus waited to sign late his sen­ior year ... because he thought he was better than who was recruit­ing him at the time," Brey said afterwards. "He was very right ... And we're fortunate enough to have him." 
Carter's second half output maintained a lead the Irish grabbed and never relinquished following Francis' basket with just over five minutes remaining in the first half (23-21). 
DePaul threatened in the second half, forcing Quinn and Falls out of their individual offensive rhythms. 
The Blue Demons dosed the gap to two on a Wilson Chandler jumper to make the score 59-57 with 2:09 to go. But after an Irish miss, Quinn took a charge on Mejia, and then Falls hit the shot of the game -a deep 3-pointer to extfmd the lead to 62-57. 
"lie's been hitting big shots for us his whole career," Cornett said, "so it wasn't a shock to me." 
The Blue Demons scored again before Brumfield's put back but could not prevent Falls and Carter from sinking foul shots to hang on. 
"If you would have told me [after losing 89-86 to Louisville Feb. 4 and falling to 1-8 in the Big Eastl that we'd put ourselves in a position to play on senior day to get to New York, I would have thrown a parade," Brey said. "Are you kidding me?" 
Brey said he thought Quinn did a masterful job Wednesday of being patient and controlling the game's tempo, assisting on three straight possessions at one point and having the poise to defer to his teammates. Quinn was guard­ed the entire game by the 6-foot-6 Mejia. 
Notre Dame started out hot, making 7 -of-8 field goals to open the game and led 17-12 with 
11 :53 remaining in the first half.

indulge their imaginations­and that means looking beyond Georgetown. If Notre Dame can somehow win four consecutive games, a feat the team has not accomplished all season in league play, the Irish will receive an automatic NCAA Tournament berth. 
And there is a chance Notre Dame can get a spot even if it doesn't win out. If the Irish win three games, they have nine conference victories. That should be enough to give them some deserved consideration. 
In order to get those three wins, Notre Dame will have to beat Georgetown and Marquette. And if it does advance, Connecticut will likely be waiting (the No. 1-seed Huskies play the winner of No. 8 seed Cincinnati and No. 9-seed Syracuse). 

That would give Notre Dame three wins against teams that rank No. 3 (Connecticut), No. 18 (Marquette) and No. 22 (Georgetown) according to the NCAA men's basketball RPI (Ratings Percentage Index). 
It's a daunting challenge for Notre Dame. The Irish have struggled getting wins all season against the top teams in the league. Brey must know how difficult it will be to get to the NCAA Tournament. But that doesn't mean his team can't 
dream. 
Plus, Notre Dame has dealt 
with worse. The Irish have had 
their backs against the wall all 
season, especially in the last 
week. But they emerged from it 
as one of the biggest success sto­
ries in the Big East (Notre Dame 
was 1-8 following a loss at 
Louisville and won five of its last 
seven to end the season). 
And they know anything that 
happens in New York is icing on 
the cake. Notre Dame wasn't 
expecting to get here, evident by Mike Brey's post game interview Saturday when he said he would ·have been surprised to be in this 
position following the loss at 
Louisville. 
Of course the coach had confi­
dence in his team, but numbers are numbers. Eight losses in nine games to start the league schedule aren't conducive to playing in a tournament where the bottom four teams do not qualify. 
But Notre Dame bounced back. And because of that, the team has certain intangibles in its favor. 
The Irish are more relaxed knowing that they are not cur­rently on the bubble. The pres­sure will be on the shoulders of the higher seeds fighting for Tournament position. 
And after Saturday's win, the locker room attitudes reflected that laid back attitude. Irish guard Russell Carter said Colin Falls' 3-pointer to give Notre Dame a five-point lead reminded him of Mario Elie (retired NBA guard who played with the Houston Rockets in the 1990s). 
Notre Dame guard Chris Quinn was relieved, just happy to end his career at home with a win and be playing in New York. 
This team has been through a lot this season. Nothing fazes the Irish anymore, which could be the team's asset. And with an attitude where Notre Dame will hope for the best and dn~am of bigger things, the Irish could be in a very good position to turn some heads later this week.

Shrugging off the Demons 
ND defeats DePaul, earns No. 12-seed in Big East Tournament 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
It might as well have been Junior Night. 
Notre Dame junior guards Russell Carter and Colin Falls made key baskets down the stretch on Senior Night -and combined to score their team's final 10 points -as the Irish downed DePaul 66-61 Saturday at the Joyce Center. 
The win clinched Notre Dame a Big East tournament berth. 
On a night when seniors Chris Quinn, Torin Francis and Rick Cornett remained quiet in the scoring column, Carter led the Irish with 22 points, including 15 in the second half, to earn a victo­ry he said his senior captains deserved. 
"We want to keep these seniors playing as long as possible," Carter said after the game. "If we could have them play until next year and give them another year of eligibility, [we] would do that." 
Quinn scored just 11 points, but 
< dished 10 assists to two turnovers, and the seniors went out with a win despite a grueling regular season. Following Rutgers' victory over

Irish free to dream of bigger, better things 
Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said it best in his press confer­ence Saturday after the Irish beat DePaul and grabbed the final spot in 
the Big East tournament. He wants his team to dream. 
How quick­ly things change. Notre Dame's focus all season has 

been making Bobby Griffin the Big East tournament. Associate It was the Sports Editor team's pre­rogative before the season start­ed, and it continued to be with every league game. But now that the Irish have accomplished the goal they set out for, things are different. Sure, No. 12-seed Notre Dame is concentrating on beating No. 5-seed Georgetown Wednesday. The Irish want to prove to any remaining doubters they belong in New York and are better than their 6-10 conference record. And the seniors don't want the season to end. But now that they have locked up a spot, the Irish are free to

UConn knocks squad from Big East tourney 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 
1-IAHTFOHD, CONN. Megan Duffy had one shot at halftime of Notre Dame's first round Big East Tournament game with South Florida Saturday, and she didn't score a point until almost nine minutes into the second half. 
But that didn't stop the sen­ior captain from taking con­trol of the game's latter stages and ending the game as the team's leading scorer. 
Duffy, whose three-pointer with 11:05 left in the game finally got her on the board, finished with 16 points, and her free throw shooting down the stretch (7 -of-7 overall) helped the Irish take a late lead and hold on for a 73-66 victory over the Bulls in the first round of the 2006 Big East Tournament. 
"At the end of the game is when she seems to just play her best," Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw said. "No matter how tired she is, no matter how many minutes she's played, no matter how many times she's been on the floor, you know that she's going to step up, get to the line, and make free throws ... I think she's a really smart player, and that's something that doesn't really show up on the stat sheet."
