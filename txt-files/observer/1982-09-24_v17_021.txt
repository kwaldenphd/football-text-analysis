Judge Hugh D. McQuillan, who presided over the three-week trial, scheduled sentencing for Oct. 22. Death penalty cases are subject to automatic review hy Indiana's Supreme Court. 
During ahout 2~ minutes of prosecution arguments yesterday, Robert Pigman, chief deputy prosecutor for Vanderhurgh County, said two aggravating factors warranted-the death penalty. Pig­man said the Gilligans were killed in the course of a burglary and more than one person was killed. 
"It'~ not an easy thing" either to ask for or to recommend the death penalty. Pigman said. 
"There's only one sentence that even comes dose to doing justice" and that is the death penalty. he said. 
Pigman told jurors that if Wallace is executed, "You'll never have to worry about Donald Wallace hur­ting anyone again." 
Wallace's attorney, William G. Smock, leaned on the railing of the jury box and read several Biblical passages as he urged the jury to recommend his client's life he spared. 
Smock talked about the Bible's ac­
count ofthe first murder. when Cain 
slew Ahd, and said the Bible 
recounts that Cain was not killed in 
return hut had a mark put on on him. 
"lest am tlnding him should kill 
him." 
"If the Lord in the tirst murder did 
not take the life of Cain ...the Lord 
is against the death penalty," Smock 
McQuillan told the panel that they had had a "vny. very ditllcult deci­sion" to make and that they had hi' thanks and the community's thanks li>r their service. 
"I hope you never have 10 go though it again," he said.

Pigman was not surprisnl cicher. declaring. "That's the wav we thought it would come out from the beginning. We were always contl­dent we would get a conviction."

Bernard assesses Lebanon situation 
By CATHY PAX 
.Vews Staff 

Sister Francis Bernard, superior fo£ missions abroad for the Sisters of the Holy Cross, recently returned from Beirut. where eight of her nuns were stationed. 
Bernard, who resides at Saint Mary's College. was in Beirut for one week to access the situation in the war-torn country. 
The eight nuns have been in Beirut since early July working as volunteers for the Catholic Relief Services. The nuns administer to the needs of both the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples. They distribute food and help rebuild private hospi­tals, schools. and orphanages with money given hy the Catholic Relief Services. The nuns had distributed food in the Palestinian refugee camps ofSabra and Chatilia until the

Tuitions given for foreign study 
By TOM MOWLE 
News Staff 
Three Notre Dame seniors will study in foreign universities next year, thanks to scholarships provided by Rotary International. 
The scholarships indude full tui­tion, hooks, fees, and room and board at the universities, as "'ell as travel there and back and s_-~00 for personal travel. The Rotary Founda­tion also pays for any intensive lan­guage training needed. 
The students, Rich McLaughlin, Michael Mills, and Ann Butler, will attend school in Chile, Austrailia, and Belgium, respectively. However, education is not the main goal of the scholarships, according to Assistant Dean Dean Kathleen Weigert of the College of Arts and Letters, who represents the program on campus. The nrimarv purpose is to "act as goodwill ambassadors for the U.S. and to contribute to interna­tional understanding." 
McLaughlin, a theology and Arts & Letters Program for Administrators major who will study economics and management science at the Catholic University of Chile, sup­ports that idea. He says he wanted to go "to further my cultural education and to get to know more of the world." He has already been to Ireland with the Notre Dame program there. 
For those juniors and seniors who are interested in applying for a scholarship for the 1984-85 school year, there will be a meeting Thursday, September 30, at 4:20 in room I04 O'Shaughnessy Hall. Fur­ther information can be obtained at this meeting, through Dean Weigert, or through hometown Rotary Clubs. 
rnassacn: which occurred there last week. 
Heavy Israeli bombing has added to the destruction ifl one section of west Beirut. Bernard said. In that section, the damage is ~o extensive that a complete rebuilding is neces­sary. 
Bernard is contident, however. that the Lebanese people will even­tuallv rebuild. She found in their character both hope and determina­tion. "They are very resilient. They are u~ed to war," she said. "Tanks and soldiers are always parading down the street, hut the people just go around them." 
Bernard remarked that her visit came during a rare full week of peace. She said that from day to day the situation changes from war to peace. yet the people can he seen sweeping up the debris immediately after the bombing stops. 
Although Bernard did not have the opportunity to talk with the Lebanese often, she believes that they definitely wanted the PLO army to leave their country. 
Even though there are many t(>reign armies in Lebanon, Bernard believes that the French, Italian, and 
li.S. forces were welcome during their first occupation. She noticed that the people talked and waved to the troops on the streets. 
Bernard feels that the nuns' work has importance beyond easing the people's suffering, as they represent Christians who are willing to aid both Christians and Moslems. "The war i~ much more than a religious war o;· heliets," Bernard observed. "The pe ·>pie are very divided, social­ly, cultlll tlly, and politically. It is a war betwe.'n ways oflife," she said.

Inflation slo"Ws to 3.3 percent 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Con­sumer prices inched forward at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in August as falling gasoline and food costs returned inflation to the low levels of earlier in the year, the govern­ment said yesterday. 
Renewed restraint in nearly all categories of the Labor Depart­ment's Consumer Price Index meant that inflation for the first eight months this year was at an annual pace of 5. 1 percent. If that holds for the rest of the year, it would be the smallest yearly gain since 1976. 
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said, "The inflation figure has returned to the excellent perfor­mance we had in the beginning of the year t ." 
Allen Sinai, senior economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., attributed the better results to the weak economy and predicted small increases -maybe even a decline -in tht· remaining months of the year. 

"We're now returning to the lower plateau ofinflation because of the prolonged recession," he said. 
Evelina Tainer, economist at the First National Hank of Chicago, described the report as "good news" and said consumers should have more money in their pockets as a result of moderating prices. 
The administration has been counting on greater consumer spending to lead the economy out of tht· stubborn recession. 
In addition to the recession, analysts have attributed the better ligures on inflation to the worldwide oil surplus and, recently, good farm crops. 
The Labor Department also released figures yesterday showing that Americans' inflation-adjusted average weekly earnings rose 0.1 percent in August after falling 0.2 percent in July. 
But for the 12 months ending in August, inflation still managed t to outstrip those earnings. The report 
Senate ends attempt at prayer restoration 
WASHINGTON (AP) The Senate, in an apparent coup de grace to the entire agenda of the "New Right" conservatives led by Republican Jesse Helms, put aside yesterday an attempt to restore or­ganized prayer to the public schools. 
With the urging of Republican Leader Howard Baker, the chamber voted 51 to -18 to effectively call a halt to the week-long battle over Helms· proposal to strip the federal courts of their jurisdiction over the prayer issue. 
Helms, of North Carolina, had lost his fourth and final attempt earlier in the day to stem a liberal filibuster on the issue. The vote to limit the debate was 53 to 45, still seven votes short ofthe 60 needed. 
Though those tallies did not kill the prayer measure outright, Helms was left with precious little room for further maru:uvering. That setback follownl the Senate's dumping ofan anti-abortion package last week, in light ofa similar tllihuster by liberals. 
The third item on the "social issues" agenda of Helms and his allies, an anti-busing measure, did make it through the Senate. Hut it is bogged down in the House, with vir­tually no chance ofenactment in the remainder of the 9'"'th Congress. 
Sen. Max Baucus, D-.\llont., a leader of the tilihuster against the prayer measure, said yesterday's votes marked the tina! defeat for the New Right. 
"Their balloon has been punctured." B:nrcus said. "But these said inflation-adjusted average weekly earnings in August were 1.~ percent below what they were in the same month of 1981. 
Overall, consumer prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in August, after climbing 0.6 percent in July and I percent in May and June, the new report said. 
The August increase was in line with the small gains of 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent registered early in the year. Prices fell in March. 
If prices rose for 12 months at August's rate, the yearly advance would he 3.3 percent. The annual rate reported by the department is based on a more precise calculation than the individual monthly figures the department makes public. 
For the 12 months ending in August, prices rose 5.9 percent, the department said. 
Inflation was 8.9 percent in 1981 and 12.4 percent in 1980. 
Largely responsible for August's slow pace were the 0. 1 percent decline posted for gasoline prices and the 0. 3 percent fall in food costs. 
questions will still he around next year." 
Baker, of Tennessee, said that while he supports Helms' prayer bill, there was no way to break the filibuster. 
"At some point this has to end," Baker said, "and this is that point. It is time to move on... 
llelms' prayer measure would have stripped the Supreme Court of all jurisdiction over school prayer ca~es, although the justices ruled in 1962 that officially-sponsored voluntary prayers violated the con­stitutional separation of church and state. 
The proposal would have allowed state legislatures or courts to ef­fectively overturn the 1962 deci­sion, and permit school boards to draft prayers to he read ;md recited in the classroom. 
The prayer measure was attached to a federal debt ceiling bill which must dear Congress by Oct. I or the government will he without author­ity to borrow money to pay its operating costs. 
There are several other amend­ments stuck on that measure as well. Helms proposed that the Senate Finance Committee he in.~tructed to recycle the hill to the tloor. stripping all amendments except his prayer proposal.

after four day strike 
( AP) -Railroad engineers were hack at the throttle yesterday, tug­ging at a lo~-:jam ofcargo after a four­dav strike that the government stepped in to end before the nation·~ commerce was strangled. 
Commuter trains ran on time in Chi<.:ago. Hoston. San l'ranci~co and elsewhere where the walkout hy 26,000 members of the Brother­hood of Locomotive Engineers had created rush-hour chaos. 
The strike ended Wednesday when President Reagan signed a joint congressional resolution imposing a settlement on the

As  the  I I '7  privately-owned

"Amtrak will he back into training again," said a happy Kevin Shaugh­nessy, manager ofthe Amtrak station in St. Louis, the nation's second lar­gest railroad center. 
The striking engineers, who walked out in a dispute over dif­ferential pay and the right to strike, said they would abide by a mandate from Congress. 
"We're disappointed, but we'll have to live with the legislation," said E.E. Watson ofSt. Louis, an inter­national vice president of the en­gineers union.

Fall candidates 



Personal finances emerge as issue 
(AP) -Taxes are emerging as a big campaign issue this fall, but in some races it is the candidate's per­sonal finances, not Reaganomic tax policy, that is making the office seeker squirm. 
Mayor Pete Wilson of San Diego, the Republican Senate candidate in California, lost so much money in a California cow dung methanol in­vestment that he was able to avoid 1980 federal income taxes, despite income of S71,342. This hasn't ex­actly helped his Senate campaig~ against Gov. Edmund BrownJr.
It I 
Roxanne Conlin, running for 
! governor of Iowa, uttered a cam­paign broadside against tax shelters. Her poll ratings took it on the chin after she revealed that she and her husband benefitted mightily from one such investment. 
"Where is t:1e hypocrisy in advocating tax policies that will cost me money?" she asks now. "My per­sonal financial situation has no bearing on the tax policies I adv­ocate." 
In politics, there may be such a thing as paying too much tax. 
After Rep. Cooper Evans, R-Iowa, said he paid more than S116,000 in state and federal taxes last year on an income of S211,000, his Democratic opponent, Lynn Cutler, raised the issue. 
At a campaign rally, Ms. Cutler quoted her stockbroker as saying that, if Evans paid that much tax, "he's too dumb to be in Congress." Evans called the remark "degrading"; Ms. Cutler said it was made in jest. 
They are not jesting in Missouri, where a new tax break for law­makers has ignited a showdown be­tween two incumbents thrust into one congressional district.

Republican Rep. Wendell Bailey is ridiculing Democratic Rep. Ike Skel­ton for taking the SSO-a-day deduc­tion. Bailey's slogan: "Tax cuts for people, not for Congressmen." Skel­ton's irony: he voted against the deduction, Bailey voted for it. 
In these post-Watergate years, it is not unusual for a candidate to release his or her income tax returns. Some consider this an inva­sion of privacy, but a candidate's failure to release the IRS 1040s can turn into a liability with the sugges­tion that there must be something to hide. 
"There's no more basic issue in 
any campaign than .. .integrity," 
said Pennsylvania Gov. Dick 
Thornburgh on Wednesday. "I think 
my opponent's refusal to disclose 
the details of his personal finances 
speaks for itself." 

Even the president is no stranger to these controversies. 
When Ronald Reagan was fighting against income tax withholding as governor of California in 1971, one of his favorite punchlines was "Taxes should hurt." So far, so good. But then it was revealed that Reagan had not paid any 1970 state income taxes. He signed the withholding legislation into law.

As much as s20,000 
Benefitoverpaym.ent discovered 
CHARLESTON. W.Va. (AP) ­Federal officials say tht: govenment could save more than sI million a year by stopping black lung benefit overpayments to children of coal miners, including some cases where they were overpaid 520,000 over tlvc years. 
The overpayments were dis· covered by a Department of Health and IIuman Services check ofthe So· cial Security Administration's list of black lung bt:ndkiaries. 
l 'nder the black lung program ad· ministered by the Social Security Ad· ministration. children of miners arc eligible for monthly benefits ofup to SI I0 until the age of IH. or until 2.~ if in school. 
LaM year, about 29,000 children rc<:eivnl SI.., million in black lung benefits through that program. 
But a recently-released Health and Human Services inspector general's report showed that the So· cial Security Administration's mas· ter record for black lung bendkiaries contains "inaccurate and inomplett: data." !'or instance, the report said, some records omit· the date of birth of the recipient. meaning benefit checks could be issued for many years after they should expire. 
In other ca,cs. the report said, stu· dent benctits were being paid to dependents who had dropped out of school or graduated. 
According to the studv. bt:ndit payments to ineligible dependents \Vt:re ended immediately when thev were discovered through computer checks. 
The investigators said that under regulations approved by Congress last year. investigators should study 'i'i5 black lung benefit recipients to determine whether they are receiv­ing overpayments. Social Security ottkials have agreed to review those 
cases. 
Social Sccurity officials said steps are ·being taken to correct the over· payment problems. which had turned up in earlier audits.

Students on PACE are tokens 

On Sc:ptc:mhc:r I 0, The: Ohsc:rvc:r printed one: of my editorials which dealt primarily with the: lack of student input on the univer­sity's PACE (Priorities and Commitments t(Jr the Eighties} committee. Thanks to some: in­formation which was sent to me: by Richard \'f. Conklin. Dirc:cror of lnt(mnation Services tor the l 'nivc:rsity of Notre Dame. I was in­formed that some students were: present at the: meetings and did take: part in the: discus­sions. 
Randy Fahs 
Friday Analysis 

The: participating stutknts even drew up a report which stated the students' perspective: of the: PACE nHnmittee. This report. authored hy Tara Kenney (then ~tudent Body Vice: President). states most of the prohkms which we, the student body, have heen talking about in recent \-ears. It is all very neatly packaged and very well organized; I wonder if anyone: will take it seriously. 
If you dc:tine the Notre Dame community as the: faculty. the administration, and the: stu­dent body, the students make up 90 percent of it. The: student membership on the PACE com­mittee stood at 9.5S pt:rcent. I never expected proportional representation (I'm not that much of a dreamer). hut reciprocal representation was a major disappointment. Imagine: what the outrage: on the: national level would he if I 0 percent ofthe population received 90 percent of political power. 
Another major dbappointment was the fact that the student~ were not invited ro take part in the: discussions of all areas in which the PACE committee held discussions. In fact, the: student members participated in only six of the seventeen areas. Only one of the seven­teen areas, that dealing with alumni, seems to he remote from the: students. Almost all of specific areas which dealt with academics had no ND student members. · 
It is my tirm opinion that the: students on the PACE committee were merely token members so that the university hierarchy might once again apease the student body by paying lip-service to our requests. The report itself states, "All of the students' views were respected, and no issue was avoided." It all sounds wonderful, but where are the tangible results,or even the proposals for future im­provements, for the: students at ~otre Dame. 
The: report covers everything from alcohol abuse:, to academic pressures, to social lite, to housing problems, and even to minority in­volvement. It is very thorough and the: stu­denb involved should be commended, because they represented our views well. I question whether or not "Big Daddy," other­wise known as the university hierarchy, will act on any of the proposals which were presented. Notre Dame: is a highly traditional and oligarchic institution. I fear that it will once again hand down a decision based on the admir~istration's tired logic that, "W'e know what's best for the students." 
The closing paragraph ofthe: student report may best explain the tt:elings of the students with regard with their ability to adapt their environment to their needs. "Citizenship in the Notre Dame: community involves a per­son's total development. This includes the op­portunity to interact on all levels, fully developing our hearts, minds, and bodies. This enables one: to mature in a healthy en­vironment, and should not he considered a privilege, but an essential feature ofuniversity life." 
I lind it ironic that Notre Dame takes great pains to bring only the finest and most qualitied people into the: student body, yet it does not trust them enough to make: many im­portant decisions regarding their life here. In fact it's more than ironic; it's a sad and tragic situation.

Wisconsin peace proposal 
Dear Editor, 
On Wisconsin!...Our grand old badger state. The voters of Wisconsin made a monumental statement to the world Thursday, September 14 hy passing the Nuclear Freeze: referendum by an almost 5 to 1 margin. This is no astonishing fact. Many people in several states are attempting to tell our Congress and our administration that the Arms Race has gone far enough. And that we, the nuclear financeers, want this tragic boondoggle to end now. 
Our economy falters yet millions more are pumped into the totally inflationary defense industry. Thousands don't get jobs because the defense industry can't provide as much employment for the same amount ofmoney as any non-defensive industry. And what happened to the supposed security we gained from increasingly sophisticated weaponry? It slipped quietly away as our defense department directed its course towards a counterforce strategy, commonly known as a firs't strike capability. In other words, we are more apt to use nuclear weapons because they are so technological­ly precise that we can disable all Russia's nuclear weapons (and just inconvenience the people) in one strike. It's clean, efficient and will guarantee that all three of the sur­vivors won't strike back. 
The Nuclear l'rc:c:ze can be the tirst step towards stopping this genocidal course. Rigorous reduction talks must, ofcourse. fol­low the initial"freeze" step. Yet how can we, as a country or a world he expected to coherently and somewhat creatively ap­proach the negotiating tables when, as General Omar Bradley so insightfully pointed out, "Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about making war than we do about peace proposed institute that would edcucate stu­dents to become professional peacemakers, is one ofa number ofsuggested responses to the nuclear threat that a group ofconcerned professionals and itellect-u~ls, including our president, Father Hesburgh, developed in the past year. We have four schools devoted to making people professional war-makers, why can't we have an institute which ed­
- more  about killing than  we  do about  
living."  
The  National  Academy  of  Peace,  a  

ucates  people  in  creating  rational  al­ 
ternatives  to  violence  and  moreover  to  
nuclear  annhilation.  

Education for creating peace can, more immediately, happen right here at Notre Dame through organizations like Pax Christi, CILA, Campus Ministry, or the Coali­tion for World Peace. CILA simply states,"Think globally and act locally."

lyons Hall controuersy 
Dear Editor, 

Student apathy is often cited as one of the great faults ofthe Notre Dame student body. A recent controversy in Lyons Hall leads me think otherwise. 
The particular issue which sparked the controversy pales in importance when con­trasted with the handling of same by Lyons Hall President Kelly !'rank and Vice Presi­dent Rose Deluge. To briefly summarize; the Hall Council decided to hold a particular function in-hall, even though Lyons is the only dorm on campus which has no formal social space. The·event was to be held in the hall's corridors, on a football weekend, the night before the GRE's. Needless to say, there was much grumbling among residents. 
So much disagreement became apparent that resident Kathy Ellick and I started a peti­tion to move the function to an alternative 

· location. We obtained well over a majority ofhall residents' signatures. 
We brought our petition to the Hall Coun­cil, who promptly dismissed it. Prior to the meeting, Ms. Deluge told me (and I do quote), "Your petition won't do any good." To pacify us, Ms. Frank arranged, albeit as a token gesture, to have her section leaders informally poll the hall. Our signatures, however, refuted the need for such a "vote." Needless to say, the Hall Council stuck with their original plans even though we had in writing a majority of the hall expressing an alternative preference. 
Lyons Hall gm-ernmt·nt is clearly a tarce. and I. for one. will ne\Tr contribute my in­put to the: hall again. I can easily utilize my time in a much more productive tashion.

Questioning United Way collection 
Dear Editor, 
Well, United Way fundraising time is rol­ling around, and once again our fair univer­sity is being called on to donate its share in the name of charity. I guess my question is whether the Notre Dame community should respond as "spectacularly" as it has in the past. Maybe it shouldn't. 
In years past the motive for giving, in my old dorm anyway, seemed to be a concern with being the first dorm on campus to regis­ter one-hundred percent on the bar graphs published in the Observer. In order to insure that hundred percent on the first day, that dorm would collect money early and make up the deficit caused by anyone who would not or could not give. Now I don't mean to single out my old dorm as the only place on campus which resorted to base tactics he­cause other dorms used various pressures to 

get those donations hut I do think that my old dorm's actions point to a poor attitude campuswide towards charity. 
Charity, it seems to me, is some sort ofsin­cere giving of onc:sdf in order to help out those in need. This giving can take the torm ofgood works or tinancial help or whatever as long as it is done: sincerely to benefit the: needy. Charity is great, and the world needs more ofit. 
The llnitc:d Way Drive at Notre Dame: does not always strike me as being charitable. Charity is not the dorm that ex­ploits the: United Way Drive to exhibit its su­perioritv. Nor is it the standardized contribution of a few dollars which soothes the conscience::" I did my duty for the year." Nor is it the donation given out of guilt. These are not aspectts ofcharit}', hut they do characterize the United Way Drive at Notre Dame. 
So instead of embarrassing people into giving, maybe: dorms should inform students about charity and the different oppor­tunities available for lending a hdping hand. Such enlightening inhlrmation may even aid students in making a more well thought-out decision regarding United Way. 
As I say, charity is great, hut sometimes I really respect those who object to donating to the United Way Driv.e. Maybe it's because the llnited Way Drive at Notre Dame, with a few exceptions, is not charity. And please don't call it charity. Call it instead a "friendly competition" among dorms, or call it stron­garm tactics for swindling the most money out of the most people, or call it a farce:.

Inside: Going for two wins in a row 


By GLEN BAILEY 
.\ports Writer 

It is September 26, 19H I and Notre Dame's rookie coach, Gerry Faust, is about to become a victim ofone of those miracle finishes usally reserved for the Fighting Irish. 
After 5'"' minutes of play between Notre Dame and Purdue at Ross Ade Stadium, Notre Dame's Phil Cart'i:r broke a 7-' tie with a 30­yard touchdown run that appeared to ice the game for the Irish. 
It did not. 

On a risky fourth and one, Purdue crossed its own 30-yard line and picks up a precious first down. On the next play, Boilermaker Quarterback Scott Campbell fired toward the endzone where flanker Steve Bryant came down with the ball between two Notre Dame defenders. On the next play, Bryant caught the touchdown pass that lifted Purdue to within a point, 14-1 3. 
Play for the tie? Not on this day. Figuring if it worked once it would work again, Boiler-

The Observer Sports Supplement· 


Try to avoid letdown after upset win over Michigan 
maker Coach Jim Young instructed Campbell 
to call the same play that had resulted in the 
touchdown. 
It worked again. Two points. Final score: 
Purdue I5, Notre Dame 14. 
And Gerry Faust and his players still remem­
ber. 

Is it real? Are the Fighting Irish really as good as they looked in last Saturday's 23-17 win over Mich­igan? Or will the Boilermakers of Purdue once again burst the bubble and upset Notre Dame on its home field? 
"I was happy for our players Saturday night because it_ hadn:t been much fun during the summer remembering last season," said Faust, who didn't give his team long to savor the win 
over Michigan. 
"But we're a long way from where we want to be," Faust quickly added. "We did some_ things well but let's see how well we come 
back and do them this week."

Stopping the Boiler 
Irish can't let Scott Campbell establish the ground game 

weeney makes hismove 
Switch to tight end was his own idea 
By SKIP DESJARDIN 
SportsEdi:orEmeritus 
Last season, as the final seconds ticked away, Scott Campbell led the Purdue Boiler­makers to a come-from-behind win over the Irish. 
In 1980, Campbell came off the bench at the last minute to replace injured starter Mark Herrmann. He was 17-2H for 178 yards in that nationally-televised game. 
"Scott Campbell is an excellent quarter·
1 
back," says Notre Dame Coach Gerry Faust. "He scrambles well and he isn't afraid to throw on the run. Steve Smith was the kind of quarterback who'd always run ifwe broke the containment. But Campbell is different. He can, and will, run. But he throws well on the 
run, and that scares us." 
There is little question that Campbell is the key to Purdue's chances this weekend. His success, however, may hinge -not on his arm -but on the runners behind him. 
The Irish secondary is still somewhat of a 
question mark. They must prepare for an aerial onslaught on the part of the Boiler­.makers. If Campbell can establish a running game, he can keep Notre Dame's defensive backfield off-balance. They will not be able to hang back, waiting for Campbell to throw. They will have to give up a half step, just in 
case the Boilers run. 
Play-action passes by Campbell could freeze Irish defenders just long enough to free up a receiver. And that will mean trouble for Notre Dame. 
Purdue is led by tailback Mel Gray. In two games thus far, he has gained 164 yards on 32 carries. Had Purdue been closer to Stanford or Minnesota, they might have been able to run more, and Gray would have even more im­pressive stats. 
But his running ability is impressive as it is. The junior college transfer earned JC All­America honors at Coffeyville in Kansas. He

Versatilitv and enthusiasm are great assets for an athlete to possess. Ma;1y coaches would be pleased to have players with one or the other of these characteristics. Once in a great while a unique player comes along who is able to express both of these characteristic~. John Sweeney not only possesses versatilit}' and enthusiasm, but seem~ to have a never-ending supply of both. 
After starting at fullback for three seasons, Sweeney, a 6-2, 21 ~­lb. senior. began spring football practice at fullback, hut soon started to spend time practicing at tight end due to the discovery ofa much-improved Larry Moriarty at fullback. 
Some players might he upset about losing a position at which thev started .~0 games over three years, but Sweeney is phiiosophical. "It was hard to handle at first but I have accepted it now. If Moriarty can keep up like Saturday, then he definitely deserves to be in tht:re. I just want to play wherever I can help." 
Coach Tom Lichtenberg, offensive coordinator, praises Sweeney's versatility, "John is so valuable to us because he is an excellent blocker and can play fullback or tight end. Halfway through spring practice John appraoched Coach Faust and me with the proposal ofmoving to tight end. lie is such a team player, he onlv wants what is best f(Jr the team." 
A p1;sition change can often present a player with adjustment 
problems. However, going from fullback to tight end is quite 
natural f(Jr Sweeney. He has the experience of a blocking back 
and has good hands. 

"Although he has had no prior experience at tight end." Lichtenberg notes, "he has adjusted extremely well." 
Sweene\· has enjovnlthe adjustment. "I like playing tight end, especially .in this off~nse. Because the tight end sees the hall a lot. I feel it is somewhat easier than fullback because you don't take as many hard hits." 
John Sweeney 
adds an element of quickness to the Boiler backfield that has been lacking in recent seasons. 
Gray is only '5-9. 164, hut he's a durable. strong runner who can physically handle a pounding. 
Joining him in the backfield will be fresh­man power-runner Rodney Carter. The 6-2. 190-lb. runner is -like Gray -averaging over five yards per carry. He complements Gray's style, as well. While Gray is the speedster, the Boilers rely on Carter for the 
"must" yards. 
The Irish defensive line will have to play as well as the did last week to shut down the run­ning game. For the first time since 1974, Mich­igan was held to under 100 yards rushing. 
Kevin Griffith, who sacked Steve Smith three times last week, will be chasing Campbell out of the pocket again. That leaves much of the burden for stopping the run to Mike Gann. The sophomore lineman was im­pressive in his most extensive action to date last week. Like all the front men, he must 
repeat that performance. 
There is more good news for the Irish as well. Tackle Tim Marshall, who missed time with a sprained foot, is listed as "probable" for this weekend. 
"We knew we had to be quicker and more physical up front," said Faust of last week's game. "I think we've made progress in that direction. 
"But the key against Michigan was pressur­ing Steve Smith and keeping him from option­ing the way he likes to. Campbell presents an entirely different set of problems for us defensively." 
The secondary, which allowed Smith to pass for 1H6 yards last week, must be allowed to key on the pass. That means that Griffith, Gann and the other men up front for the Irish must shut down the Boiler running game.

DESIGNED AND EDITED BY 
Skip Desjardin 
Last week was the first time Sweeney plaved 
tight end in an actual game. "The tir~t series I 
wa~ in there I was so excited and nervous that 
I misread the defense a couple of times, hut 
the next series I was alright... 
With Mark Bavaro out of action f(Jr a few weeks, Sweeney will take on a more important role. "\X'e will use John as more of a primary receiver when he is in there this week -as opposed to a blocking tight end... sa\·s Lich­tenberg. 
Sweeney is also the spt·cial teams captain. 
another example of his versatility. 
As the lkertield. Ill.. native approaches the 
end of his stay at Notre Dame, he realizes he 
has a wide-open future..., plan to take the 
MCAT's this spring then look at mt·dical 
schools. As far as prokssional football is con­
cerned. I will just ha\T to wait until spring." 
For now, however, Sweeney will follow in the footsteps of former teammate Pete Buc­hanan. Last season, Buchanan moved from ful­lback to tight end as well. The reason? There was already a superb athlete ahead of him in the fullback slot, and Buchanan wanted to play. He knew he couldn't beat out the man above him on the depth chart. So he made a change. 
That man's name~ 
John Sweeney. 
He has come full circle in a short time. But Sweeney has lost none of the enthusiasm about which his coaches rave. lie's still out to do what he can -wherever he can -to help the Irish.

The Purdue Exponent 

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. -After 15 years of coaching, Leon 
Burtnett has made it to the top. 

Since becoming Purdue's 50th head football coach after Jim 
Young's resignation last year. Burtnett has found the job demand­
ing of both his time and energy. 

"The major change from assistant coach to head c:;oach is that it 
cJemands more time," Burtnett says. "It demands that you plan 
out your whole day. I have to make sure I leave time for the 
coaching end of the job." 

During the summer. Burtnett was kept busy speaking at various 
alumni functions. "It gave me a chance to meet a lot of new 
people," he says. "I had done it before as an assistant, so it wasn't 
as if I was going in cold. I ju~t hadn't done it as much before." 
Burtnett found that he must ;.~!so spend more time recruiting. 
"As an assistant coach. I was assigned a certain area to cover," says 
the :'>9-year-old rookie coach. "If! tlnished in my area, Jim had me

It seems like playing against Notre Dame does that to people anytime we play." 
If the new people Faust speaks of do come into their own. it would give Purdue its tlrst victorv at :'>Jotre Dame Stadium since 19"'-t, when the Boilers upset the Irish 51-20. 
At stake b the Shillelagh Trophy -given to the winner of the Notre Dame-Purdue game ~ince 19S-. During that time, :'>lotre Dame has won it 15 time~. the Boilers 12. 
The Shillelagh i~ one of many reasons this intra-state rivalrv alway~ ranks as one·of the most emotional games ofeach season for both teams. 
"After a year of experience, we know how he thinks and the type of players we have on this team. It would he foolish to let the talent we have on this team go to waste. We have to play at our maximum potential." But before anvone starts conjecturing about the Irish and ending their statements with the words "national champion~ ...

"Like the saying goe~. one game does not a season make... 
'"When a team play~ emotional games like we have the past two weeks, you can have let­downs," ~aid tlrst-year Purdue Coach Leon Burtnett. "That's what's happening to this t{)()tball team. they have doubts about their ahilitie~. The kid~ want to win so had it's ellecting their play. They have to relax and have fun." 
The Boilers shouldn't expect too much tun facing a :'>Jotre Dame defense that held .\lichi· gan to -11 yards rushing and sacked quarter­hack Ste\-e Smith eight times ti>r 5-t yards in los~es. 
"They have the personnel, there's no doubt," said Burtnett. "I think thev surprised even·one last year when they went S-6 with the personnel they have. Their dekn~e wa~ good last year. Now their oftt:nse looks much more consistent."

Kiel received the game hall from his teammates, Notre Dame's most valuable player award from ABC and a double do~e ofconfidence from himself. 
"Blair Kiel looked a lot better in his first "I kel that as head coach I have to see more 

students in more areas. Since January, I've 
flown -tO,OOO miles on recruiting trips. We 
had an excellent recruiting year last year, hut 
each year you have to try to do better." 
During the I 5 years he has been coaching college ti.>Othall, Burtnett has not stayed in one place for a long period oftime. In fact, the five years he has spent at Purdue is the longest time he has ever staved at one universitY. 
Born in Californi; and raised in Oklahoma, he and his family moved to Meade, Kan., before his sophomore year in high school. While in high school. Burtnett played tennis, made all-state in basketball and played foot­hall. 
On the football team, he played quarter­hack and running hack. After high school, Burtnett attended Southwestern College in Kansas, where he earned all-conference honors as a fullback and was captain of the team as a senior. 
Burtnett began his coaching career right out ofcollege in 196'; as head coach at Mount Hope High School in Kansas. "I was very ti.>r­tunate to get the joh," he says. "I wouldn't have gotten the joh if I had tried out for the pros. I didn't try out for the pros because I didn't think I was good enough." 
In 196"'. he moved on to Sterling High School in Kansas as head coach. After two years at Sterling, he received a job as a graduate assistant coach of the freshman team at Colorado State University. Despite wanting an offensive coaching job, he was given the joh ofddt:nsive coordinator. 
In the next eight years Burtnett spent time 
at six different universities. from 19"'0-"'2, he 
was secondary coach for one year each at 
Montana State, Washington State and 
Wyoming. In 19..,5. he took over as deknsive 
coordinator at Wyoming. 
In 19..,-c~ he joined Head Coach Darrell 
Rogers at San Jose State as linebacker coach. 
Burtnett considers Rogers the major in­
fluence in his coaching career. "Most of my 
coaching philosophy comes from Darrell," he 
says. 

Burtnett moved with Rogers to Michigan State llniversity in 1976. He spent one year at MStl and then became defensive coordinator at Purdue in 19..,.., when Jim Young took over as head coach. He moved up to assistant head coach in 19..,9. 
"The reason I moved around so much was 
because I thought each move was a step up," 
says Burtnett. "Each advancement exposed 
me to different philosophies. I learned a lot." 
The two coaches Burtnett considered most 
intluential on him are Young and Rogers. "I 
learned from Jim how to organize my time," 
he says. "While Jim was coaching. he was the 
best organized coach I've seen." 
Young and Rogers were both pass-oriented coaches. and Burtnett is no different. Burtnett recruits with a passing attack in mind. 
"I recruit according to my philosophies," he says. "I feel the passing attack is conducive to all positions. It gives the running backs a better chance of staying healthy. It also gives them a better chance of making the pros be­cause the scouts see them both running and catching the hall." 
Like Burtne t tt, Young and Rogers both were defensive coaches before becoming head coaches. "I fed it is an advantage to have been a defensive coach," Burtnett says. "I coached the secondary which gives me an advantage because I know how to hurt it the most. I feel I can also help the quarterbacks by recognizing the coverage being put on them." 
After years of moving, Burtnett, his wife Cecilia and his three children call Purdue home. "The area is an ideal place for raising a family," Burtnett says, admiringly. "Two ofmy children were horn here. I like the com­munity and the support it gives the team." 
But Burtnett has not gotten the breaks necessary in order to be a successful first-year coach. During the course of the year, Purdue lost seven players due to academic and per­sonal reasons, and injuries. 
Against Minnesota last Saturday, Purdue lost its eighth player, defensive lineman Paul Hanna, to a knee injury. 
But despite the two lopsided losses ( 5S-I-c~ to Stanford and :'-<·-1" to Minne~ota ). Rurtnett has not given up, at ll-a't not yet. "1\aturally we have a lor.~· way to go a!> 1 football team.," he nmcedes. "We played two good first halves in both games and we have totally fal­kn ·1part in the se,·ond h,,;f Tht· biggest con­

book review 

Once lipon a time (not so long ago) authors Toni lhara and Ralph Warner became frustrated with their lives as struggling law students. Rather than remain in law school and spend the next three years bar­ricaded in the 'brar, they decided to offer other hapless victims al­ternatives to a legal education. The result oftheir collaborative effort was the founding of Nolo Press, the nation's leading self-help law publisher. More importantly, however, is the publication of their most recent book, 29 Reasons not to go to Law ~chool (Nolo Press,

When we were children, one ofthe most exhiliratingexperiences was going to the circus. The animals, the clowns and the trapeze ar­tists excited us and brought to life some ofour wildest and most ad­venturous fanta.~ies. Cy Coleman, Michael Stewart and Mark Bramble have brought to life the story of the circus' greatest promoter, P. T. Barnum. The Tonv Award winning musical, Barnum, comes to the stage ofthe Morri~ Civic Auditorium this weekend; Friday and Satur­day at H p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. and "'::'>0 p.m. Their production relies upon the truth ofBarnum's immortal words, "There'sa sucker born every minute," to draw an audience. For the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's theatre community, this production whets the palates of those thespian afficiandos. Asuccess in New York and on tour across the country, it should equal its success here. Ticket prices range from SI0 to S22.50 for the evening performances and S9 to S20 for the Sundav matinee. To reserve tickts call 2.U-6954. They will ac­cept Mast~rCard and Visa; that is, ifyou're lucky enough to have plas­tic money. 
•MOVIES 

The takeover ofour tilm screen by foreign directors continues this weekend with]onah Who Will be25 in the Year2000, as part ofthe Friday Night Film Series. Awarded the I9"'6 National Society ofFilm Critics Award for Best ScreenplayJonah deals with eight veterans of I968, stranded between revolution and accommodation. Director Alain Tanner describes the film as "a dramatic tragi-comedy in politi­cal science fiction." Lights will go down in Annenberg Auditorium at "'::'>0 p.m. Admission is 52.00. 
Best B(~}'. a documentary by Ira Wohl about his 52-year-old retarded cousin, will be shown tonight in the Engineering Auditorium at., and 9::'>0 p.m. Based on his experiences of his cousin, Philly, Wohl presents a man who was cared for in his own home bv his mother rather than sent to an institution. As a result, Philly is·a happy man rather than a "ca.~e". The movie is slightly comi­cal in tone but is mainly a tribute to the strength ofthejewish family. A winner ofan Academv Award, the I98I New York Film Critics Award, the Presidential·Citation and over 100 others, Best Boy is a classic film which is one of the "don't miss" films ofthe Social Con­cern Film Series. 
Saturday evening in the Engineering Auditorium finds jack Lem­mon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe hoofing it up in the mad-cap comedy hit,Some LikeIt Hot. One ofthe most popular movies made bv Marilvn Monroe, and one beset by various stories concerning Monroe;s state of mental health during its filming, this film captures one of the classical plot concepts ofcomedy; mistaken identit~·-Cir­cumstances are complicated by the presence ofa beautiful woman and the outcome is a hilarious variation on the traditional method of discovery and claritkation. Showtimes are 7, 9: I 5 and I I ::'>0 p.m. 
Indiana University at South Bend (!USB), in its continuing film series, presents two movies this weekend. Friday evening, Roman Polanski's Tess will take the screen. Ba.~ed on the novel by Thomas Hardy, Tess ofthe D'Urben,illes, Polanski has translated the written word onto the s<:reen with creditable sensitivity to subject and im­agery. At times he has a tendency to hit the viewer over the head with his svmbolism but that can be excused, mainly due-to the per­
formance-given by Nastasia Kinski in the title role. Saturday night, Threepenny Opera will be shown. Both ofthese will be presented at Hp.m. at Northside I 58{Little Theatre/Recital Hall) at IllSB. Tickets t(>r each pert(>rmance are 51.25. 
•OUTLOOK 

Quickly becoming a monument to the prevalence offilm in our history and present lives, the Monday Night Film Series, parts Iand II, will fill Annenberg Auditorium again. Beginning at 7 p.m., Mas­culine/feminine will be featured a.~ a part ofSeries I. Director jean­Luc Godard explores the tensions that plagued the Vietman era. Such subjects as youth reactions to violence, political protest, suicide and birth control are focused on. Godard has based his film on two short stories by Guy de Maupa.~sant, "I.e Signe" and "La Femme de Paul". Don't let the french soundtrack discourage you. Thereare english subtitles. For only S2.00 how could anyone refuse to go. 
Any explanation ofan Alfred Hitchcock film would be extraneous. As a cinematic genius in mystery thriller, Hitchcock is incomparable. This man, once again, will prove to us why his films has attained the classical standing in movie archives in the feature presentation ofthe Monday Night Film Series 11. His I959 adventure, North by 
Northwest, starring Cary Grant and the faces of Mt. Rushmore, will hit the screen at 9 p.m. Admission is still an economical !2.00. 
Ticket reminder tor all Pure Prairie League fans: tickets are still available for their September 28 concert at the Morris Civic Auditorium through River City Records. At S9.50, they are one ofthe best concert ticket buys around the South Bend area River City Records is open until I0 p.m. to accept your cash, checks or other forms oflegal tender.

letters to a lonely god 
You mentioned you were afraid I would think you a moral monster; but, up to this point, you have always done the best you could for those you were responsible for. Now, with your fifty-fifth birthday closing in, you felt some change in lifestyle was necessary, ifyou were going to survive in peace. ''I'm not trying to excuse or defend myself," you wrote, "but I want you to under­stand that I have not lost my mind, and I haven't given up my family to marry a chorus girl." 
You do not want to defend yourself, and I am not 
attempting to change your mind. As one niddle-aged 
guy to another, I do understand being fifty-five. You've 
reached the point ofthinking: ''I've paid my dues. Now 
I'm entitled to a better deal. All my life,l've taken care of 
other people. Now it's time to take care of myself." I 
know the mood, because I've been there myself. 
I bet you think priests never get tired ofwhat they're 
doing. Catholics look at their clergy, and think "They 
have it made." It's as tiresome being a salesman of mys­
tery as it si being a salesman ofmachinery. The competi· 
tion is as keen among clerics as it is among junior 

executives. Once upon a time, I think, before the 
changes, it used to be e~ier. Prerequisities ofgracious­
ness came with getting old. No one talks any more of 
New Breed and Old Breed. That doesn't mean that if 
they catch you mumbling Latin, they won't judge you to 
be expendable. 
Fifteen years ago, I remember with embarrassment, I 
attempted a metamorphosis. I bought a turtleneck 
sweater and a coat of many colors. Hanging a cross 
around my neck a Ia Daniel Berrigan, I wore my new 
livery to a concert in Washington Hall. One ofthe older 
priests, on seeing me, asked: "What is Griffin trying to 
prove?" It was a fair question. Later, when the question 
was repeated to me, and I understood myself as a pat· 
hetic fat man trying to dress like a sport, I decided that 
image is not something you grow into from the outside. 
I can imagine myselfbeginning over in a less lonely 
life. I would like an occupation where I didn't have to 
talk so much. A priest spends a lot oftime being per­
suasive, defending God's honor. "The zeal ofthe Lord's 
house has eaten me up," Scripture says ofthe Lord's ser­
vant. When I was young, I prayed for such zeal. As I 
grow older, 1 realize there's no sense in praying for the point of burn-out. 
If you wonder why I'm writing this, it's because I'm trying to tell you, in a personal way, that I understand the need ofgetting out. After twenty-eight years ofthe ordained life, Icould enjoy waking up on Sunday morn­ing without being faced two or three times in the day with the duty ofbeing the chiefcheerleader in a pep ral­
ly of faith. I would like to be free of the feeling of help­
lessness that comes when troubled Christians ask for 
cousel: "Lately, I've been plagued with temptations to 
kill myself, and I was hoping, Father, you could tell me 
how to deal with them." I would like to answer a phone 
call at three o'clock in the morning, knowing it will be a 
wrong number, rather than a voice announcing: ''I'm 
having the most terrific crisis offaith. I'm wondering if! 
could come right over and talk about it now." I would 
prefer not getting the plaintive rambling letters that 
begin: "You don't know me, but ...",with a case his­
tory, written in pencil, that it would take the staff at 
Menninger's to figure out.­
The crisis comes, at fifty-five, when more and more is asked ofyou, and you feel you have less and less to give. Whatever you attempt to do, some younger colleague is doing better. 
There's no way a priest can leave his duties without hurting people. Any hope ofhappiness is contingent on my use ofgrace to be as faithful as I can. It is a sign ofage to worrv about salvation, but I have a feeling that it is foreshadowed by the peace of mind I experience at the end ofa day. Entertaining dark moods ofselfpity, I know I have friends, with problems of their own, who worry about me. I once attended the wake ofan elderly actress, to which nobody else came. I laid my rosary over her hands, so that she would seem less lonely in death. There, but for the grace ofGod, could be any per­son who has declared himself independent of human obligations. 
You told me your story, and now I've told you mine. 
I'm sorry you're getting a divorce. There must be a bet­
ter way. Adivorce would make all ofyou losers. So 
much pain to so many cannot be helpful. l.t must be a 
punishment, as well as a blessing, to have children who 
care enough to weep over your decisions. It shouldn't 
surprise you to hear that I am envious. 
I would not preach to you so directly, if I never 
preached to myself first. 
Scott is talking of transferring to a school closer to 
home, to be near his family. Is this something you really 
want him to do? Please tell me what Ishould say to him. 
The following paragraph was cut before the letter was mailed: "Would vou take it amiss if I told you, from one old timer to anoiher, that I'm on the verge of considering you a damn tool' Damn foolishness, when you're fifty-five, comes with the territory; it's not a proud credential to have. It can cost you every blessing asked for in the Nuptail Blessing: May you live together in peace to a ripe old age in the company offriend, with children, who will console and comfort you .. 
It's the kind ofparagraph I wish someone would write to me, if I ever announced I was leaving. 

A Ian Parker's The Wall lends ~redence to the notion that film is not a serious art form. Parker 
(Midnight £.--.:press, Shoot the Moon) directs in a surprisingly in­
competent style, eschewing any semblance ofcoherency in favor of cheap titilla-tion. And even the titil­
lation lacks conviction, if that's pos­sible. Are there any redeeming qual-
Patrick mulligan 
movie review 
ities to this film~ Not really. The set design (by <ierald Scarfe) ap­proaches mediocrity at times. Every­thing else in The Wall. from the gaudy animaton to the mindless camera work, reeks ofdil-ettantism. 
The Wall concerns itselfwith the 
rise and fall ofrock superstar Pink, 
apparently a nmum a clef for Pink 
Flovd singer--songwriter Roger 
waiers. In a re<:Cnt issue of Rolling 
Stone Waters described his {and 
Parker's) approach to the tilm: 
..we did wam a lot ofthis to he a 
punch in the face." A more ap­
propriate euphemism might have 
oeen "knee in the groin." All of the visual images pre-sented in this tilm 
engender a sort ofdime-store 
philosophy regarding the human 
condition. If the intention is to rou.,t: 
the audience from its imagin iti\T slumber, then the film fails mtst:rah­ly. There simply isn't enough sub­stance here; hence Parker continually reverts to facile se­quences ofgratuitous violence. Un­fortunately, supertluity does not a good film make. 
Alan Parker undertook this project without a shooting script. This whimsical approach to filmmaking is readily evident in the finished product. The sloppy editing, random narration, and heavy-handed imagery suggest a slapped-together production by the director. Consider Parker's use of the panning shot. In many scenes the camera is kinetic, leading the viewer down corridors, around a garden, etc. The idea is to "show" the audience what to look for -an ef­fective technique if used with dis­crimination. The Wall, however, emplo~·s the panning shot too fre­quently, implying a certain laziness on the director's part. Parker does 
not take the time to frame shots; he 
prefers simple expository shots 
requiring little jn the way of mental 
abstraction. Indeed it appears the 
makers of this film believe they are dealing with an intellect-ually in­ferior audience, though that could hardly he possible. 
There arc other examples of Parker's technical ineptitude (e.g. ir­relevant ground level shots, incon­sistent lighting, t:tc. ). Yet these inadequacies palt: in com parison to the thematic prett:nsions of the tllm. To obviate the necessity ofinnova­tion Parker presents blood, gore and guts. In conveying the simile of education as mass stultification the director presents a scene in which faceless children fall into a meat grinder. Naturally Parker feels this isn't enough -he ha.~ to show the sausage being produced at the bot­
tom of the grinder. The shot is cra.o;s, tasteless, and unnecessary. Anyone who ha.~ ever seen a film hy <lodard or Scorcese will be insulted by the obviousness ofThe Wall. 
Not much more can {or should) he said about The Wall. All would be well-advised to avoid this cinematic atrocity.

If Notre Dame's 5-0 tleld hockey team can, as coach Jan Bishop says, "iron out the wrinkles," it could be headed for a very ~1.1ccessful sea~on. The wrinkles showed yesterday as the Irish women slogged to a 5-0 vic­tory against overmatched Valparaiso University at Alumni Field.

The Saint Mary's volleyball team will take to the road tomorrow to meet Northeastern Illinois Univer­sity and Lake Forest College. Head Coach Erin Murphy is anticipating a good match against a tough Nor­theastern team, and is confident of victory over Lake Forest. 
The Belles are coming into these matches with a 1-1 record after losing their sea~on opener to Notre Dame. "Losing to a Division t team (Saint Mary's is in Division Ill) is no­thing to be ashamed of," comments Murphy. The Belles later defeated Grace College with two of their starters out of the game with shin splints and the flu. 
In these matches, Murphy is expecting team veterans to exhibit leadership to the less experienced players in terms of play and court leadership. The veterans will also he needed to help prepare the other players for the upcoming statt: tournament. 
"We've only been practicing for two and a half weeks," says Murphy, "and we still have a tong way to go befort: we will be ready for States." 
The teams new assistant coach, John Klebba, ha~ been doing an out­standing job. "He is extemely profes­sional in working with our athlete~.·· Murphy says. admiri•1glv. 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team is not the only varsity sport playing this weekend. The Belles tennis team, with a 2-2 record, will bt: playing at Indiana Statt: University against the Sycamores today and versus Eastern Illinois tomorrow, before returning to their home courts on Tuesday against Manches­ter College. 
Head Coach John Killen is an­could in the tlrst half. They were really aggressive, and that was som<:­thing to get used to, hut we were just as aggressive 
Ray broke the ice at the 16-minute mark with the tlrst Irish goal. Notre Dame missed several opportunities to score as the Valpo women employed an alignment featuring a defensive player positioned behind the goaltender, illegally stopping the ball in the net. Bishop explained "better to give up a stroke than a goal." The Crusaders' strategy paid off, as Jeanne (irasso missed all three of her one-on-one attempts. 
Giana Marrone scored at .~0:2:\ and two minutes later Clare Henry tallied to allow Notre Dame to carry a three-goal halftime advantage. The sloppy first-half play prompted Bish­op to make some adjustments, tel­ling the team to "concentrate more on the hall. Don't think goal, think control. They're making the plays but missing the ball." 
"We played pretty sloppily," agreed Molly McCabe, "but a good teamcan win no matter how poorly they play. We didn't play our worst, and we took advantage ofthe oppor­tunities when they were there." 
The Irish took advantage of op­portunities to add a pair of goals in the second half. Ray picked up her second tally of the game at 4: 12 and Janet Hlavin closed the scoring with a marker at 17 :30.

Are the prospects any better t<Jr this Irish team tonight' Perhaps ~o. "Indiana has already lost three games this year," Hunter says. "and they play SJli-Edwardsville, the number one team in the country, Wednesday night. 
"They're having a prettv rough time ofit. We'll have to play real well to heat them. but I think we can do it." 
One week ago. llunter might not have been so sure. A scoreless tie with <ieorgetown, in which his squad outshot the: lloyas 55-S, and a lackluster victory over Valparaiso had left an unsettled feeling with many ohserv<:r~. But a combination of spirited practices and encourag­ing game play since then have brightened the picture. 
"That loss to Ohio State ( 5-I last Friday night in a rain~torm) doe~n·t mean anything," llunt~·r says. "The \'1.-eather was so bad that we ap­proached the Ohio State coaches about rescheduling the game. But they refused, I guess t1guring to take a chance on getting some lucky bounces. And they did. I don't mind telling you, we would have beat them otherwise." 
As for the game on Tuesday, the Irish seemed to hit on almost all cylinders in the first halt; creating in­numerable excellent scoring oppor­tunities. Though things were slowed down in the second half by poor weather, the overall result only made the outlook for the game tonight more promisinK 
The only worry might be the lack ofa workout for the defense in Tues­day's game, as it wa~ never really threatened. But the whole Irish team should have no problem getting up for this game. 
As Hunter left Alumni Field on Tuesday, signing autographs and switching off the scoreboard, a young fan, age t about 12, asked him, "What will you do if you beat In­diana?" 
Hunter replied, "Well, we'll just come back and get ready for the next game. Indiana is just one game 
"You mean you won't jump up and down and yell'" 
Hunter paused for just the slightest instant and then said, "Well, maybe just a little bit," and smiled.
