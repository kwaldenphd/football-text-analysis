Democrats reclaim House in close election 
Students follow election results for Jwme state races

Gathered around plasma screen tele­visions, alternately cheering or biting their nails, the students lingering in LaFortune Tuesday night could have been watching a big game. But rather than waiting for the latest jumps in BCS rankings, these watchers were antici­pating midterm election results. 
Their reactions varied from cheerful­ness to apathy, as they tracked televised election coverage. 
Sam Chen, a graduate student from China who has lived in the United States for four years, said he learned much about American politics by watching the results.

Business students present tax proposal in D.C. 

ByJENNIFER METZ 
News Writer 
When Professor James Wittenbach asked his graduate students to develop a new tax law proposal, he never imagined what would result. 
What Tax Researchffax Policy students James Flaherty, Andree Johnson and David McCormick originally deemed an opportunity to meet classmates turned into a trip to ·washington D.C to poten­tially change a federal tax law. 
Wittenbach spoke to Notre Dame graduate Jim Jaeger, Deputy National Tax Managing Partner for Deloitte, over the sum­mer to expand his course's ice­breaker into a more serious aspect of the class. 
CSTV game broadcast limits watch options 
The 36 students in the class divided themselves into groups of three to develop tax law proposals they felt would benefit taxpayers, as well as the economy and the environment. 
Professionals from Deloitte & Touche along with Professor Ken Milani, advisor to the Tax Assistance Progam, judged the class' 12 proposals. 
Flaherty, Johnson and McCormick's proposal, focused on education and also on providing financial rewards for graduates and their parents, was chosen by Deloitte and Milani to be present­ed the National Tax Office of Deloitte in Washington D.C. 
The three winners put in a "decent amount of time" outside of the classroom doing research and developing their ideas, Johnson said. 
"Being graduate students, we have all been through quite a bit of education to date," Johnson said. "The assignment was to make one change to the way income taxes are computed, so naturally we turned our thoughts to education and whether or not there was room for a new credit in the current tax code." 
Flaherty said they "felt that this was a pressing need for our coun­try when looking at education lev­els across the board." 
The students' proposal includes a $1,000 tax credit for the parent or legal guardian of a high school graduate, a $2,000 tax credit for the student graduating with a bachelor's degree and a $1.000

Channel surfing, adjusting your antenna and even smack­ing the television set will not gain most local Notre Dame fans access to Saturday's Notre Dame-Air Force game. 
The game will be aired on the CSTV network -a channel that is solely available in select cable markets throughout the nation, excluding Notre Dame's campus and the South Bend area. 
CSTV -a three-year-old col­lege sports network owned by CBS Corporation -has rights to the game through a contract with the Mountain West Conference, of which Air Force is a member. 
This marks the first time since the Oct. 31, 1992 Notre Dame-Navy game that a Notre Dame football game will not be available on NBC, ABC, CBS or ESPN. The 1992 Navy game was broadcast locally by WNDU. 
On Saturday, however. South Bend Comcast Cable will not air the game locally. Fans can visit UND.com or CSTV.com to watch the game.

Exciting sites around the Bend

unique treas­ures that are often left unexplored by us part-time resi­dents. When dorm parties, the bar scene -or lack thereof-and the cold weather get old, start explor­ing the city of South Bend. 
Because I, too, have fallen victim to boredom in South Bend, I want to offer you a list of places to spend some time discovering and believe me, they have more to offer than just the usual Notre Dame para­phernalia. 
Some of the unique places that I have visited include the beautiful diamond of Coveleski Stadium, the home of the South Bend Silverhawks. A personal favorite of mine, Dollar Mondays bring in a wide array of baseball fans. 
From the casual baseball fans who are drawn in by the dollar tickets and the dollar hot dogs, to the diehard Silverhawks fans­yes, there actually are some who know the lineup-this evening at the ball park is a guaranteed good time. 
To get a little culture, be sure to visit one of my favorite restaurants on McKinley Avenue called Mazatlan. With wonderful authen­tic Mexican food, Mazatlan is staffed by waiters from various countries in South America. 
Although I wonder how in the world they heard of South Bend, Ind., and even more, why they decided to move here, I am thank­ful for the wonderful Larissa Quesadillas and suggest them to all. 
And now for the grand finale: my all time favorite, The View. Located on Jefferson Blvd, this establish­ment, which opened in the 1920s, is the home of the ghost Marley and delicious cheeseburgers. During prohibition, it is rumored that seven people were assassinat­ed here. But don't let this scare you from venturing into this small, quaint bar. 
The deals are reason enough to visit. On Tuesdays, burgers and pitchers are $2.50 each. If this does not bring you in, the townies will offer you plenty of entertain­ment and wonderful stories as well. 
Just remember when visiting The View there are four rules on the jukebox that apply to all. No Rap. No Heavy Metal. No Refunds. And No Whining.

Hill denies disappointment over CMA loss 
NEW YORK-Faith Hill insists she's no Kanye West. The country music superstar says she was just joking when cameras showed her screaming "WHAT?" in apparent anger when she lost the female vocalist of the year award to newcomer Carrie Underwood at the Country Music Association Awards on Monday night in Nashville. 
"The idea that I would act disrespectful towards a fel­low musician is unimagin­able to me," Hill said in a statement. "For this to become a focus of attention given the talent gathered is utterly ridiculous. Carrie is a talented and deserving Female Vocalist ofThe Year." 
Media outlets and blogs zeroed in on Hill's reaction after Underwood's name was announced at the cere­mony.

Megan Zacher, 22, of 
Delanco, N.J., fell at Calico Jack's Cantina on 42nd Street and Second Avenue on July 8, 2006, her lawyer, Lawrence Simon, said Tuesday. He said the fall caused a tom knee ligament that required surgery. 
Simon said Zacher and two friends were celebrating a birthday. She had been at the crowded establishment about an hour, was working on her second drink and was danc­ing on the bar, vying for the $250 "Shake-lt-Like­Shakira" prize, when she fell, Simon said.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
SUB explains game watch absence; Shirt president approved 

Legal complications prevent TV broadcast 
By KATHLEEN McDONNELL 
News Writer 

The lack of an Air Force game watch, record sales of The Shirt and an overview of student gov­ernment's role comprised Tuesday's Council of Representatives (COR) meeting in LaFortune. 
Student Union Board (SUB) director Pat Vassel explained to the council that legal issues pre­vent SUB from hosting a game watch for Saturday's football game against the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado. 
"Legal issues between Comcast and CSTV (College Sports Television Programming), the sta­tion that is broadcasting the game, will not allow us to broad­cast the game as of today," Vassel said. "All questions about not hav­ing a game watch should be directed to Comcast." 
Student activitiP.s advisor Amy Geist explained that the Comcast cable provider for Chicagoland and Northern Indiana, with whom Notre Dame has a contract, does not offer the possibility of carrying the CSTV channel. As of now, SUB has no way to show the game. 
Sophomore class president Lulu Meraz mentioned a link she saw on Facebook.com that would allow students to watch the game by signing up online. Geist offered the possibility of students paying for and downloading the game from CSTV, but "students must be careful to follow the University regulations for broadcasting," she said. Both Geist and Vassel expressed hope that the situation would improve before kickoff on Saturday. 
Along the lines of Irish football, The Shirt president Rich Fox informed the council of this year's record-breaking sales. 
"We sold 152,000 shirts so far, breaking the previous record by 17,000," Fox said, "so we're pret­ty excited with where we are." 
Fox presented his nomination for the 2007 The Shirt President, Brad LeNoir. The council unani­mously approved the Dillon soph­omore for the post. 
LeNoir's goals include making sales of next year's The Shirt just as successful a..'> this year's. 
"We're going to try and take the project a little more national, piggy-backing on Fox's initiative this year," LeNoir said. "Otherwise we're just going to try and live up to the impressive 152,000." 
LeNoir declined to admit a pref­erence for the color of next year's shirt, diplomatically vowing to abide by the preferences of the entire The Shirt committee. In other CLC news:

FACULTY SENATE 



Senators approve use of electronic minutes 
Members discuss use ofhonor code test 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Assistant News Editor 
Faculty Senate chair Seth Brown opened the group's meet­ing Tuesday night with a request that it be a brisk one so "we can go home to watch the election results with either pleasure or pain" -and brisk it was, with little debate accompanying the items discussed. 
The primary proposal of the night was for the electronic approval of Faculty Senate min­utes. Brown explained that the rationale for the distribution 
and approval of meeting min­utes by e-mail, rather than at the group's next meeting, was to "accelerate the process by which the min­utes are made available." 
The minutes -or the list of what was said by whom at each meeting ­are normally typed up within five days, but 
currently cannot be made avail­able for all non-Senate faculty members until they are approved by the group a month later, Brown said. 
The proposal calls for the min­utes to be forwarded to senators by e-mail, and unless any sub­stantive changes are made, they will be automatically approved 
after five days. 
"Historically, there is seldom any contention about the min­utes. Ninety percent of the changes are usually in regards to the attendance ros­ter," Brown said. "This change would stream­
line  meetings  
and  decrease  
the  time  

between when we have meet­
ings and when the minutes are available." 
If, in fact, a senator finds a point of contention in the min­utes, they would be able to request that the approval be made at the next meeting in order to allow for discussion. 
Brown also pointed out that switching to electronic approval does not require a change in the bylaws, so if the new system doesn't work, it can be tweaked.

Philipe Collon member Student Affairs Committee 
The proposal passed unani­mously. 
Philipe Collon, speaking for the Faculty Senate's Student Affairs Committee, brief1y recounted the committee's dis­cussion about Notre Dame's Academic Honor Code. Collon focused mainly on the test on the honor code required of every incoming freshman, indi­cating that the questions asked on the exam were "very inter­esting," and more complex than just "I looked at my neighbor's exam, was I cheating?" 
He said the committee has been looking at whether or not undergraduate students should take the test every year. 
"It's less because we're not trusting students, but because they're changing environments,

Car chase concludes at TC 
Police pursue, discover suspect on Ivy Court 
By KATE ANTONACCI and 
MARY KATE MALONE 
News Editors 
A late-night motor vehicle pursuit by the St. Joseph County Police ended at Turtle Creek apartments around 2 
a.m. Tuesday morning when the suspect exited his vehicle and took off on foot, South Bend Police spokesperson Phil Trent said. 
"It was a vehicle pursuit," Trent said. "When you get in a vehicle pursuit it attracts a crowd of cops." 
About 15 to 20 police officers -some from the county, oth­ers from South Bend -gath­ered at Turtle Creek to search for the suspect. 
"We searched high and low for the guy but we couldn't find him," Trent said. "The guy was in the area on foot, but we couldn't locate him. We knew he was there, so we stayed in the area." 
At 3:30 a.m.. Trent received a call from the Jamison Inn, located just south of Turtle Creek on Ivy Court, where someone was allegedly trying to break into a residence. The description of the suspect "loosely matched" the descrip­tion of the man they had been searching for at Turtle Creek. 
Using a dog, the South Bend police officers were able to find the suspect hiding in a dumpster. He was identified by police as David Pace -the same man St. Joseph County officers had chased into Turtle Creek. 
St. Joseph County Police spokesperson Jaimee Thirion was unavailable for comment Tuesday night. 
South Bend police became involved because Turtle Creek is within its jurisdiction and because the county police force is "thinly staffed" on late weekday nights, Trent said. 
"Because they were in South Bend, we came out and assist­ed," he said.

Terrorist given life for bomb plans 
LONDON -An al-Qaida operative was sen­tenced to life in prison Tuesday for plotting to bomb the New York Stock Exchange and other 
U.S. financial targets and blow up landmark London hotels and train stations with limou­sines packed with gas tanks, napalm and nails. 
The plans were designed to cause maximum carnage, the judge told Dhiren Barot, who stared blankly ahead as he learned he would not be eligible for parole for at least 40 years -one of the harshest sentences ever meted out in a British court. 
Barot, a 34-year-old British convert to Islam who pleaded guilty last month to conspiring to commit mass murder, remains wanted by the United States and Yemen on separate terror­related charges. Under British law, he could be temporarily transferred to the United States to stand trial.

She will replace American James T. Morris for a five-year term as head of the world's largest humanitarian agency. 
Founded in 1962, WFP provides food aid to an average of 90 million poor people, including 58 million hungry children, in at least 80 of the world's poorest countries. The United States provides more than 40 percent ofthe agency's budget.

Electronic voting failures reported 
INDIANAPOLIS, IN -Officials from two Indiana counties say early problems with elec­tronic voting machines had been fixed Tuesday, as residents cast ballots to decide three of the nation's most closely watched congressional races and to see what party controls the Indiana House. 
Indiana's voter ID law received its first test in a general election, but that was not what was causing the problems, clerks in two counties said. 
In Delaware County, an apparent computer error prevented voters from casting ballots in 75 precincts, County Oerk Karen Wenger said. 

Dems try to take over Congress 
Party denounces GOP over Iraq war and scandals; wants to regain majority 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON Democrats challenged Republicans for control of Congress for President Bush's final two years in office Tuesday in elections shadowed by war in Iraq and scandal at home. Thirty-six states elected gov­ernors, from Maine to California. 
All 435 House seats were on the ballot along with 33 Senate races, elections that Democrats sought to make a referendum on the presi­dent's handling of the war, the economy and more. 
Voters also filled state leg­islative seats and decided hundreds of statewide ballot initiatives on issues ranging from proposed bans on gay marriage to increases in the minimum wage. 
Glitches delayed balloting in dozens of Indiana and Ohio precincts, and Illinois officials were swamped with calls from voters complain­ing that poll workers did not know how to operate new electronic equipment. Voting machine malfunctions forced officials in Indiana to delay calling statewide races until 8:40p.m. EST while in Pennsylvania, Lebanon County extended polling hours because of machine problems.

The plan proposed by the students can easily be altered and piggybacked onto this law, Wittenbach said. 
"The problems associated with not graduating high school are astronomical ... think of what the government [can] earn in the long run," he said. 
If these incentives increase the high school graduation rate, this plan will initially cost the government up to $1.3 bil­lion, the students said. Ultimately, however, after the graduates become productive, federal and state income taxes.

Notre Dame's senior associate athletic direc­tor John Heisler said there is no record of the last time a Notre Dame game was not televised on campus or locally. 
Notre Dame has no control over broadcast rights of away games, he said. 
"The home team owns the rights to the game," he said. "The visiting team has nothing to say about it."

"It's a tremen­dous disappointment that this game won't be available to every viewer," Wade said. "Nobody at CSTV" would not want to make this game avail­able to the fans, she said.

Westwood One, the radio net­work that owns the radio broadcast rights to all Notre Dame football games, broad­casts in all 50 states on over 300 affiliates, he said. 
While this is a rare case for Irish fans, he said. it is not atypical for the rest of colle­giate football teams. 
"All of our fans ... have been extremely fortunate," Heisler said. "The fact that all of the games [since 1992] have been available on major networks is semi-remarkable."

losing by much to Chocola even in the strongly Republican areas. 
"This time [Donnelly] took advantage of St Joseph and LaPorte County," he said. "He also held his own and didn't get trounced in the Republican coun­ty." 
Colwell said Chocola had a per­fect storm against him, com­prised of public sentiment against Iraq, Republican scan­dals and economic problems. And although they were not national issues, Colwell said, Chocola was also hurt by opposi­tion to Indiana's daylight savings time change and the sale of the toll road by Republican governor Mitch Daniels. 
In addition to Donnelly, several other Notre Dame alumni per­formed well Tuesday. The follow­ing results were those projected at press time. 
Incumbents Democrat Peter Visclosky of Indiana's 1st district and Republican Mark Souder of Indiana's 3rd district both won their re-election bids. 
Notre Dame graduates Michael Ferguson of New Jersey's 7th district, Peter King of New York's 3rd district and Michael Lungren of California's 3rd district were also re-elected. 
Three Saint Mary's graduates were re-elected to their House seats, including Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas' 30th district, Donna Christensen of the Virgin Islands and Madeleine Zeien Bordallo of Guam. 
At press time, the Associated Press had declared a loss for Saint Mary's alumna Anne M. Northup, incumbent representa­tive of Kentucky's 3rd district. 

Colwell discussed the implica­tions of possible election out­comes on the U.S. Congress. At 2 
a.m. Wednesday, the House had been declared for the Democrats, but the control of the Senate remained undecided -though media outlets were tentatively giving the Democrats a very close win. 
He said if the Democrats had won some seats but failed to cap­ture the House of Representatives, it would not have been considered a victory. 
A Democratically-controlled House, Colwell explained, will likely have a major impact on the country by blocking President Bush's legislative agenda. 
"If they don't vote [with the President], he can't get what he wants," Colwell said. 
Colwell said a Democratic vic­tory in the House, but not in the Senate, would result in legislative gridlock. 
If the Democrats win both the House and Senate, it will be a monumental victory for the party, he said. 
"It would be a real message that voters were upset with Bush [and] the way the country was going." Colwell said. 
Colwell said the Iraq War, recent scandals among high­ranking Republican leaders and the economy were all issues that likely hurt Republicans in their efforts to hold onto political power. 
He said though the stock mar­ket was doing well and gas prices were down, many people seemed to feel their own salaries were not keeping pace with infla­tion and that they were losing benefits. 
Colwell also said scandals such as Rep. Mark Foley's inappropri­ate e-mails to teenage male Congressional pages might have disillusioned Republican voters -especially the "Religious Right." 
With at least half-if not both sides -of Congress now in con­trol of the Democrats, current national and international poli­cies could be re-evaluated. 
Colwell said based on prior statements, Democrats would, as a whole, not try to immediately withdraw from Iraq. 
Rather, he said, Democrats might push for different ways to attempt to stabilize the country and would criticize prior actions made there as mistakes. There may also be, he said, a strong push for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's resignation.

IN BRIEF 
Consumer borrowing takes large fall 
WASHINGTON -Consumer borrowing fell in September by the largest amount since the recession of the early 1990s, weakened by a huge drop in auto loans. 
The Federal Reserve reported Tuesday that borrowing declined at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in September, compared with a 4.6 percent rate of increase in August. Borrowing fell by $1.2 billion in September -· the biggest drop since a $1.78 billion decrease in April 1992. 
It was the first decline since March, when borrowing marked a far milder decrease of 
0.24 percent. 
Borrowing for auto loans slipped at an annu­al rate of 3.2 percent in September, reversed from an increase of 3.5 percent the previous month. September loans in that category dropped by $4.05 billion, the largest fall since the $4.81 billion decline in October 1991. 
The overall economy has lost momentum due . to the housing slump. The struggling auto industry slashed jobs last month, as did compa­nies involved in home building, furniture mak­ing and real estate -casualties of the souring housing market. 
FedEx dumps Airbus for Boeing 777 
PARIS -Boeing scored a victory in the airlin­er wars Tuesday when FedEx became the first customer to cancel an order for Airbus's much delayed A380 jumbo jets and said it will instead will buy Boeing 777s. 
FedEx Corp., the world's largest express transportation company, cited production delays for its decision to retract an order for 10 of the new double-decker A380's. Its FedEx Express unit has ordered 15 Boeing Co. 777 freighters with a Jist price of $3.5 billion (2.8 billion euros) and taken options on an additional15. 
The A380 cancellations leave just 15 super­jumbo freighter orders on the Airbus books ­from United Parcf'l Service Inc. and International Lease Finance Corp. -and a fur­ther 142 orders for the plane's passenger ver­sion. 
FedEx Chairman and CEO Frederick W. Smith said, 'The availability and delivery timing of this aireraft, coupled with its attractive payload range and economics, make this choice the best decision for FedEx." 
Los Angeles Times editor quits 
Baquet departs over cost cutting conflict; O'Shea named as his replacement 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES -Los Angeles Times editor Dean Baquet resigned Tuesday following a dispute with the paper's parent, Tribune Co., over cost cuts. The resignation came just weeks after the paper's publisher, Jeff Johnson, was forced to leave for the same reason. 
Baquet will be replaced Monday by James O'Shea, the managing editor of the Chicago Tribune, the Times reported on its Web site. O'Shea will be reunit­ed with David Hiller, who took over for Johnson after serving as publisher at the Tribune. 
Baquet, 50, was forced to resign by Hiller after refusing to cut newsroom jobs, according to the Times. The announcement was to have been made Thursday, but was rushed after the news leaked, the paper said. 
Baquet and Johnson had publicly rebuffed the par­ent company over possible job cuts. When Johnson was replaced, Baquet said he would stay on and try to convince the Tribune to increase its investment in the paper. 
Tribune spokesman Gary Weitman declined to com­ment.

Wall Street rises ahead of election 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Wall Street extended its November rally Tuesday, carrying the Dow Jones industrials to a new trading high as investors anticipated a business-friendly outcome of the mid­term elections and bought stocks across the market. 
Boeing Co. led the blue chips after winning a $2.3 billion order from FedEx Corp. Strong quarterly reports from both Toyota Motor Corp. and Emerson Electric Co. also lent strength to the market. 
The broad advance came as investors bought optimistically ahead of an election that could strip power from Republicans in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1994. Stocks often rally on elections as Wall Street bets change will lead to an environment more favorable to busi­ness; the theory on the Street is that a split in power in Washington will cre­ate legislative gridlock, slowing down regulatory change. 
"Gridlock is good, Wall Street doesn't like change," said Charles Gabriel, senior Washington analyst for Prudential Securities. "You're not going to have runaway spending increases, you won't have a repeal of the Bush tax cuts, and there's no leg­islative change that will roil industries. The green light is on for <>quity invest­ments because you've got protection against any major changes." 
The Dow rose 51.22, or 0.42 per­cent, to 12,156.77, building on Monday's 119-point gain. The index of 30 large-cap stocks rose to as high as 12,196.32 earlier in Tuesday's session, surpassing its previous trading high of 12,167.02. 
Broader stock indexes also advanced. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 3.06, or 0.22 percent, to 1,382.84, and the Nasdaq composite index added 9.93, or 0.42 percent, to 2,375.88. 
Bonds gained, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling to 4.66 percent from 4. 70 per­cpnt late Monday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices rose.

WHO prepares to select new chief 
U.S. controls group, some critics claim 
Associated Press 
GENEVA-The Bush adminis­tration's drug and sexual health policy is a key issue as the World Health Organization chooses its next leader, a post that wields great power in allocating billions of dollars in funds to alleviate misery around the world. 
After two days of closed-door deliberations, WHO is set to announce its new chief Wednesday. 
Contenders for WHO's top job include Dr. Margaret Chan, a bird flu expert and former Hong Kong director of health, Dr. Shigeru Omi of Japan, who heads WHO's Asia office, Mexican Health Minister Dr. Julio Frenk, Spanish Health Minister Elena Salgado Mendez and Dr. Kazem Behbehani, a veteran WHO offi­cial in Kuwait. 
The United States has not declared a preference for any candidate. 
Critics say the United States, WHO's largest donor, plays too large a role behind the scenes. They argue that the Bush admin­istration-is promoting the inter­ests of its pharmaceutical indus­try -at the expense of poor AIDS patients who could be saved by cheap generic medicines -and has adopted an ideological line on issues like abortion. 
President Bush has made more money available for AIDS research than any previous American leader, but that largesse has not extended to pro­grams in reproductive and sexual health. His administration has also challenged ideologically charged WHO programs such as needle exchanges and condom distribution. 
U.S. officials deny they are seeking to force the administra­tion's health policies upon the world. 
"We are not giving WHO money because we want to have influ­ence," said Bill I I all, a spokesman for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. "We're doing this because we want to improve the human condition around the world." 
Leading public health experts and senior WHO officials told The Ac;;sociated Press that Washington consistently interfered with policy under the U.N. agency's last director-general, Dr. Lee Jong­Wook, who died in May. 
"The U.S. government has a direct role in every significant decision made in Geneva, and even close to a veto role," said Dr. Hichard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal, The Lancet. 
In one prominent case of alleged interference, the United States requested the suppression of a book commissioned by WHO that criticized U.S. free trade agreement.;; for jeopardizing poor countries' access to cheap medi­cines. 
In a letter to WHO's acting director-general, a senior official from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the report "spuriously" character­ized U.S. trade policy. WHO has yet to make a decision on the U.S. demand. 
"Standing up to the U.S. is not the easiest thing to do at the WHO," said Sisule Musungu, a Kenyan intellectual property spe­cialist, who co-authored the report with a former WHO staffer. 
The episode sparked concern from two Democratic lawmakers, Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Rep. Henry Waxman of California, who have called for an investigation into how American trade agreements threaten the health of people in developing countries. 
"Attempting to suppress a report because it is critical of U.S. trade policy is unacceptable," Kennedy wrote in a letter to Mike Leavitt, Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
In a widely reported episode in January, WHO's top official in Thailand was stripped of his post after he said in an editorial that a U.S.-Thai free trade agreement would jeopardize Thai access to cheap drugs. leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands ofAIDS patients.

Al-Qaida claims attack attempts 
Thwarted bombings targeted Yemen sites 
Associated Press 
CAIRO-Al-Qaida has pur­portedly claimed responsibil­ity for attempted suicide attacks on two oil installa­tions in Yemen and vowed more strikes against the United States and its allies, according to a statement posted on the Internet. 
"Let the Americans and their allies ... know that these operations are only the first spark and that what is coming is more severe and bitter," the statement said. 
The statement was dated Oct. 13 but was posted this week. Its authenticity could not immediately be verified but it was posted on a Web site frequently used by Islamic militants. 
Suicide bombers tried to strike two oil facilities in Yemen with explosives-
packed cars on Sept. 15, but authorities foiled the attacks and four bombers and a security guard were killed, the Yemeni government has said. 
The attacks happened 35 minutes apart. targeting a Yemeni oil refinery in the northeast province of Mareb and a Canadian-Yemeni oil storage facility at the Dubba Port in Haramut province ­scene of a 2002 attack on the French tanker Limburg. 
The attempts came days after al-Qaida's No. 2, Ayman al-Zawahri, issued a video­taped threat of attacks on the Persian Gulf and on facilities he blamed for stealing Muslim oil. 
"These operations were carried out upon the direc­tive of our emir (leader) Osama bin Laden, may God protect him, in which h~ ordered Muslims to strike at Western economy and drain it, and to halt the robbing of Muslims wealth," the 
Internet statement said. 

The attempted attacks also coincided with an election campaign in which President Ali Abdullah Saleh faced his first real challenge since becoming head of state in 1978. 
Al-Qaida in the statement called on Saleh, who was re­elected to another seven-year term, to repent to God and to "stop believing in democracy, America's religion and to quit allying with the infidels and be in enmity with the believ­ers." 
Yemen is the ancestral homeland of bin Laden and was the scene of the 2000 bombing of the destroyer USS Cole that killed 1 7 American sa.ilors. 
After the Cole bombing and the Sept. 11 attacks, the West began pressuring Yemen to join the war against terror. Saleh launched several crackdowns against extrem­ists, winning praise from the United States.

Climate changes may damage sites 
Archaeological ruins threatened by floods 
Associated Press 
NAIROBI -From ancient 
ruins in Thailand to a 12th­
century settlement off Africa's 
eastern coast, prized sites 
around the world have with­
stood centuries of wars, loot­
ing and natural disasters. But 
experts say they might not 
survive a more recent men­
ace: a swiftly warming planet. 
"Our world is changing, there is no going back," Tom Downing of the Stockholm Environment Institute said Tuesday at the U.N. climate conference, where he released a report on threats to archaeological sites, coastal areas and other treas­ures. 
Recent floods attributed to climate change have damaged the 600-year-old ruins of Sukhothai in northern Thailand, the report said, while increasing tempera­tures are "bleaching" the Belize barrier reef and a ris­ing sea level is sending dam­aging salt into the wetlands of Donana National Park in Spain. 
Downing also said the ocean could eventually engulf 

ancient settlements such as 
the Old City on Kenya's Lamu 
island, which dates to the 
12th century and has been 
named a UNESCO World 
Heritage site. 
Lamu is vital to Africa's his­
tory; Omani Arab sultans who 
ruled the eastern eoast of the 
continent first settled there 
before moving to Zanzibar. 
They left behind winding 
alleyways and an unspoiled 8­
mile-long sandy beach that 
now attracts tourists to Lamu. 
Thailand's ruins of 
Sukhothai -which means 
"dawn of happiness" ­
include artifacts from ancient 
royal palaces, Buddhist tem­
ples and city gates. Founded 
in 1238, Sukhothai was once 
capital of a Thai kingdom. 
"Some of the developments we are faced with mean the parks of today may not be rel­evant tomorrow," said Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program. "Adaptation to climate change should and must include nat­ural and culturally important sites." 
He said the response cannot be to simply "lock things up in museums and zoos." Instead, he said, governments world­wide must act to stem global warming.

Men sentenced for deaths 
Rebels receive punishrnents for murder of tzvo American teachers 
Associated Press 
JAKAHTA -A separatist rebel who killed two American teachers at a U.S.-owned gold mine was sentenced to life in prison Tuesday and his accom­plices up to seven years, a judge said. 
The defendants -all indige­nous Papuans -have repeat­edly called their trial a sham and walked out in protest hours before the verdicts were read. 
Prosecutors claimed the men were all members of a small rebel army fighting for a sepa­rate state in the resource-rich province of Papua, in eastern Indonesia. 
They were accused of attack­ing a convoy heading toward a mine owned by Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Mine Inc. Killed in the 30­minute assault were Hick Spier, 44, of Littleton, Colo., Ted Burgon, 71; of Sunriver, Ore., and an Indonesian teacher. 
Eight other Americans, including a 6-year-old girl, were seriously wounded in the Aug. 31, 2002 attack. 
Antonius Wamang, 31, was sentenced to life in prison, though prosecutors demanded only 20 years. 
"This was premeditated mur­der. It was a gross violation of human rights," said Judge Andriani Nurdin. The judge later sentenced two other men to seven years for taking part in the ambush, and four to 18 months for providing logistical support. 
The defendants have 
remained silent throughout their five-month trial, refusing to make a defense plea and regularly walking out of the courtroom, saying the judges were biased against them. 
Their lawyer, Johnson Panjaitan, claimed Tuesday that he had not been allowed to meet with his clients for more than a month, but court offi­cials could not immediately confirm that. 
"Can you imagine that a client cannot communicate with his lawyer?" he asked. 
Spier's widow, Patsy, who suf­fered two gunshot wounds in the attack, praised the ruling, saying in an e-mail to reporters that she was "firmly convinced Wamang and the other defen­dants are guilty of this horrific and cowardly act of terrorism."

We have all seen one, want one, or have one. GPS vehicle navigation sys­tems seem to be the hottest new car accessory, and I cannot help but become obsessed with them myself. Who could not possibly desire to have a pleasant, comforting voice telling you when and where to turn, what to do if you've made a mistake, and where to go when help is 
needed? The rear A Word to the view camera is Wzse also a hot com­modity; a camera showing the driver exactly how far he or she can reverse so a nearby object is not destroyed. And most recently, Lexus released a luxury vehicle that parks itself. Thanks to technology, driving is now virtually effortless. No more acci­dents, no more getting lost, and no more wrong turns. 
Unfortunately, technology has yet to create a navigation system for life. This much-needed invention could be the answer to all of life's questions and the solution to everyday problems. There have been times when I could have used a rear view camera so I would not have crossed over the yellow line in an argu­ment with a friend or family member, and times when I needed the "park assist" gadget to take a midterm exam for me. And I am in dire need of a navi­gation system right now to tell me what classes to take and when to take them, as well as to put me on the right path to my dream job with no wrong turns or obnoxious co-workers standing in my 

way. 
Not only would a navigation system be beneficial to my career and academic success, but my social life as well. I could use a pleasant, comforting voice to tell me which boys to date, what group of friends is right for me, and when to make a U-turn when I walk out of my room wearing Uggs and a mini­skirt. Heartoreak could be avoided, friends would last forever, and fashion faux pas would no longer exist. 
Although this type of system could be the vehicle to lead us down the carefree road to happiness, it is a mere figment of my imagination. However, the resources and tools are available in our everyday lives to form our own person­al. non-technological, navigation sys­tems. 
Family can act as our rear view cam­era. They know what we want to do and will do everything in their power to help us get to our final destination safely. Family can set off the warning tones when they feel one of their own is becoming dangerously close· to some bad choices. Their voices of reason are quietly subtle at first, beep...beep... beep, but soon increase to the strong BEEP BEEP BEEP to let you know you could be making a huge life-altering mistake. 
Friends are our real life version of the "park assist" Lexus. While we are in control of our own lives, our friends are the ones that travel right along with us. Giving advice, helping with homework, and enjoying time together make us feel 
as though we are not on this journey alone. 
Faith acts as our GPS navigation sys­tem. When it comes down to it, the direction of our lives is placed in hands other than our own. A strong faith in any religion can provide guidance, security, and comfort as we make deci­sions or face defeat. While mistakes and wrong turns will be made, lessons will be learned and our faith is there to help us recognize our mistakes and place us back on the right track. Whether it is on the Holy Spirit, a Guardian Angel, or whatever higher power you place your trust, it is comforting to know that there is a guiding force looking out for you and leading you in the right direction. 
On the road of life, we are faced with many challenges; challenges that not even a navigation system could over­come. Each wrong turn and every fend­er bender builds character, strengthens relationships and teaches valuable les­sons. The fight with your best friend teaches forgiveness, the break up with your boyfriend or girlfriend gives strength, and the Don your theology paper inspires diligence. These lessons cannot be observed through a rear view camera and cannot be taught by a navi­gation system. Only real life experience, support from loved ones, and faith can lead you confidently down the road of life.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Plan B response speaks out of turn 
In his response to Charles Rice ("Women, students deserve apology," 
Nov. 2) Dan Hicks argues that it is incumbent upon columnists to respect 
their audience by offering them reasoned arguments rather than emotion­
ally manipulative rhetoric. It is a good principle, especially if you believe 
that a culture of civic argument is the lifeblood of democracy. 
However, just as a good law can become a bad law if it is selectively 
enforced, a good principle can become a bad one if it is applied in a parti­
san way. By appealing to the principle that respect requires rational per­
suasion in a letter devoted to criticizing a columnist with whom he clearly 
has deep disagreements, Mr. Hicks courts suspicion that the principle is · 
not being invoked in good faith. 
Has it really escaped Mr. Hicks' notice that the distinction between 
rational persuasion and emotive manipulation is widely acknowledged in 
our society, even amongst those who have never read "After Virtue'?" 
Emotional manipulation is frequently condemned; the problem is we tend 
to condemn it only when employed by our political opponents. 
· By applying our standards asymmetrically, holding those we believe to 
be wrong to a higher standard than those we believe to be right, we help 
to perpetuate a polarized political climate which inhibits the kind of rea­
soned democratic debate almost all of us claim to want. 
Mr. Hicks concludes his letter by asking "on behalf of the Notre 
Dame/Saint Mary's community" that Professor Rice apologize for failing to 
adhere to the argumentative standards that respect requires. He immedi­
ately goes on to say "I cannot speak for the women of our community," 
which rather makes nonsense of the previous claim. But it was nonsense 
anyway. As a single student who holds no representative office, he cannot 
speak for the men of this community either. If Mr. Hicks feels entitled to an 
apology then he should of course ask for one, but as for the rest of us, men 
and women, he should pay us the respect of allowing us to make up our 
own minds when to be offended.

Claim by "Big Love" proves false 
FTT's website says of its upcoming "Big Love" (opening on Tuesday) that it's based upon the oldest surviving play, "The Suppliant Women" by Aeschylus. Wrong. The discoveries at Oxyrhynchus provided evidence that "The Suppliant Women" is in fact preceded by both "The Persians" and "Seven Against Thebes." 
The idea that "The Suppliant Women" came before the others stems from a fallacy in talking about art. Because "The Suppliant Women" is in some ways Aeschylus' most stylistically-primitive play, some critics assumed this meant he wrote it first. This relies on a warped notion about art -that every innovation happens adventitiously and that use of that innovation will necessarily produce a better work of art. Since we now know that Aeschylus wrote more stylistically-progressive works before "The Suppliant Women," that makes us wonder why he used the form for it that he did. 
The answer is simple: the style best suited his artistic goals for the piece. The erroneous notion that led critics to provide an earlier composition date for "The Suppliant Women" creates a problem because it assumes that artists are constricted by the current conventions of their medium, instead of taking the position that artists can innovate at will. Why did Aeschylus seldom employ three actors'? Was it because the innovation wasn't around when he started writing, or that, when it did emerge, he was just too atavis­tic to jump on the bandwagon? Both of these theories are inadequate. If three actors had served the dramatic and philosophical purposes of Aeschylus' plays, he would have created the innovation rather than Sophocles. The fact that he not only lacked the initiative to create the three­actor rule, but that he seldom employed it afterwards demonstrates that­while it may have been a beneficial tool for playwrights in general-it did not serve his purposes. 
Certainly evolution in aesthetic approach opens up more options for play­wrights to express themselves, but it docs not mean the old form is inferior, and that we are positively evolving. Few would argue that French is an inherently-superior language to Latin simply becaus(~ it evolved from it. The critics who assumed that "The Suppliant Women" was older than Aeschylus' other surviving works just because its structure reflects a method that had been around longer is insulting to Aeschylus; it is akin to those offensive executives who colorize old black-and-white films for tv viewing, assuming that, had they the technology and financial resources, the filmmakers would have necessarily shot in color. The argument goes like this: color film devel­oped after black-and-white; therefore it is better; therefore everyone must want to use it. Ok, then I guess filmmakers from Bogdanovich to Welles, Fellini to Kurosawa, Woody Allen to George Clooney, among others, are just plain stupid. And, apparently, so was Aeschylus.

The facts on PlanB 
In order to form an opinion about Plan B, I must rely on the reports of 
researchers and drug companies. The evidence I have seen, including both reports 
cited in Dan Hicks's last letter, does not seem to prove that Plan B is not abortifa­
cient ("Plan B", Nov. 6). 
The first source cited by Hicks provides the most promising evidence for his 
assertion that Plan B is not abortifacient. This report discusses an experiment con­
ducted on monkeys. Plan B was given to these monkeys after having sex during an 
ovulatory period. The number of times an embryo implanted in the womb of a mon­
key was roughly the same for those monkeys who were and were not taking Plan B. 
Although this statistical similarity is suggestive, it does not tell us anything about 
the mechanisms that caused the failure of implantation in those monkeys who were 
taking Plan B. Different causes can achieve a similar outcome a similar number of 
times. 
This same source also provides a report about a study done on a group of women, 
who attempted to take Plan B during their preovulatory fertile period. 82 percent of 
the women taking Plan B did not ovulate for up to five days. Clearly these women, if 
sexually active during this tim~. would not have become pregnant-regardless of 
whether pregnancy begins at conception or implantation. Taking Plan B did not 
prevent ovulation for 18 percent of the women in the study. One of the researchers 
says: "We conclude that the effects exerted by Plan B, when it is taken before the 
onset of LH surge [i.e., before ovulation], may fully explain the pregnancies averted 
by emergency contraception. Failure to affect the LH surge, because treatment was 
begun too late in the fertile preovulatory period, explains the 20 percent failure 
rate of this method." The researcher seems to be referring to the roughly 20 per­
cent of women who take Plan B but still become pregnant (in the medical sense of 
embryo implantation). It does not seem to me that these two sets of statistics are 
comparable in the way that the researcher suggests. In the study that these scien­
tists conducted, 20 percent of the women ovulated but it is highly unlikely that 100 
percent of these women would have become pregnant had they been sexually active 
during this period. Yet, a comparison between the rate at which Plan B fails to pre­
vent pregnancy and the ovulation rate of the women in the study relies on making 
this assumption. 
Renee Woodward neither confirms nor denies that Plan B prevents the implanta­tion of an embryo ("A woman's view on Plan B", Nov. 7). She seems to hold that the evidence about whether or not Plan B prevents implantation is inconclusive at best. This may be the most reasonable conclusion, based on currently available research. Yet, if you will allow me to play the arm-chair pharmacologist for a moment, I will offer a reason for holding that Plan B might act as an abortifacient. Let's begin with two uncontroversial facts. First, taking Plan B only prevents ovulation in women who have not started the ovulatory phase of their fertile period. Thus, some women taking Plan B could potentially conceive a child. Second, hormonal contraceptives like Plan B alter the inner lining of the uterus in such a way that the uterine wall becomes a less hospitable environment for the implantation of an embryo. Plan B does not make implantation impossible but it does make it more difficult. It is hard to believe that the occasional failure of embryos to implant never has anything to do with the well-known effects of Plan Bon the uterine wall. To the extent that tak­ing Plan B plays a role in preventing implantation, a person bears a moral respon­sibility for acting in such a way that a human person is harmed, indeed, dies ­assuming, of course, that a human embryo is a human person.

Indecision 2006: why Chocola and Donnelly 
each lost a vote 
In recent. election years, a common complaint of voters has been that choosing between the Hepublican and Democratic candidates has been a decision between the "lesser of two evils." In 2004, for example, there was a sentiment among moderate lib­erals that although John Kerry wasn't an ideal candidate for the White House, "at least he's not Bush." In 2000, many conservative Americans acknowledged that Bush had some superficial deficiencies, but couldn't fathom the idea of AI Gore seizing control of the free world. I've never subscribed to the "lesser of two evils" theory -until this year. 
More so than any election I can remember, the local Congressional race has consisted almost entirely of mudslinging, with littlp, or no substance behind it. Chris Chocola's message was that Joe Donnelly is a man of low character and professional integrity. Donnelly's message was the Chocola has, in his current position, acted in ways that don't serve the best interests of Hoosier families. And you know what'? Both parties made their arguments very convincingly. As a result, yesterday, for the first time since I reached legal age, I exercised my right to not vote in a Congressional election. The can­didate that wins may well go on to accomplish some great things in vVashington, but he won't do so on the basis of any claims he made on the campaign trail. The~efore, he also won't be getting to Washington with the help of my vote.

'BORAT' A GLORIOUS, IRREVERENT ROMP 
By ERIN McGINN Assistant Scene Editor 

Every so often a movie will come around that is so offensively hilarious that there is no middle ground. The audience will either love it or hate it. In 1994, "Clerks" was that movie. In 1999, there was "South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut." And now there is "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan." 
Easily one of the most intelligent come­dies of the last couple of years, "Borat," starring Sacha Baron Cohen, has some­thing to offend -and amuse -basically everyone. 
Borat was initially created as one of the three characters that Sacha Baron Cohen portrays on HBO's "Da Ali G Show." Most recently, Cohen played the supporting role of Jean Girard in Will Ferrell's "Talladega Nights" and··stole almost every scene he was in. 
In this film directed by Larry Charles, shipped off on an anthropological mission of sorts to America. Although his docu­mentary was supposed to film solely in New York, he decides to embark on a cross-country road trip. His trip is inspired not only by his desire to learn more about Americans and their idiosyn­crasies, but also by his deep infatuation for former Baywatch sex goddess Pamela Anderson.

'BoRAT' Nor So NICE 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Scene Editor 

At its best, humor is offensive, off-put­ting and even a little subversive. "Borat: Culture Learnings of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" manages to be all of the above, but man­ages to forget that humor is actually sup­posed to be funny. Instead, "Borat" is a plodding mishmash of good ideas, bad ideas and everything in between, stretched out over a running time that feels longer than its 84 minutes. 
The biggest problem with "Borat" is that it's not very funny, but it thinks it is. This is a film that had everything going for it, but it fails to capitalize on its prem­ise, and, while there are several clever moments, too much of the film consists of a lot of poo and sex jokes, 11JR.1n which haven't gotten any~~. fresher or funnier since ... well, ever. The subplot concerning Pamela Anderson is merely distracting, and "Borat'' seems to have trouble extending into feature length. As a section of "Da Ali G Show," Borat's shtick worked, mostly because it was skit-oriented and came in a brief, punchy little segment. 
Accordingly, the best parts of the fea­ture film are those that feel like parts of a foreigner who just wants to be nice to them. ' 
The movie initially asks the audience to laugh at the preposterous naivete of a primitive foreigner from a backward country, but the movie is quick to balance that with poignant barbs at America's 
skit, without any emphasis on plot. Borat is effortlessly played by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, and his performance is easily the best part of the picture. He imbues the Kazakhstani reporter with an effervescent innocence, that is at times both charming and ingratiating -these qualities make Borat's constant un-PC behavior more bearable, but the film has an annoyingly winking atti­
satirize. As with "Fight Club," it's easy to think that people just 
won't get the irony. Those who 
imitate Borat and his bubbly 
racism and sexism are clearly

missing the joke, and while it's easy for critics (and Cohen) to contend that audiences aren't dumb enough to miss the obvious, remind them about all the fight clubs that sprung up back in 1999. 
Audiences laughed throughout "Borat," but too much of it was that kind of uncomfortable laughter, like watching a drunk fratboy in a room full of sober peo­

endless follies and shortcomings. One of the satire's strongest sequences is when Borat gives a rabble-rousing address to a rodeo, claiming he supports Bush's "war of terror" and expresses his longings for the day when Bush will "drink the blood of every man, woman and child in Iraq," but then he turns the crowds against him as he sings a version of the Kazakhstan national anthem to the 
"safe," with fairly pre­dictable outcomes and circumstances. The other half lead to the most uproarious moments, which truly have to be seen to be appreciated -and the bigger the crowd the better. Although the movie and the material is a little uneven in its pace, it stiJI contains enough caustic interactions and sharp observations to keep audiences entertained throughout the duration of the filin.

THE MANY GUISES OF SACHA BARON COHEN 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA 
Scene Writer 
Borat Sagdiyev's humor may be any number of things, but unintentional it is not. Unapologetic, uncouth and even unkind are more apt descriptions. But, as his originator freely admits, the infamous Kazakh journalist 
:·:.f._;.i<t 

first reared his gleefully crude, mustachioed j' head thanks more to mere chance than sheer

inventive genius. "Borat is based actually on a guy I met in
i 

southern Russia. I can't remember his name. He was a doctor," revealed Sacha Baron Cohen in a press junket touting Borat's feature film debut, "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan." 
"The moment I met him I was totally crying. He was a hysterically funny guy. Albeit, totally unintentionally." 
Still, Cohen, 35, deserves more than a little 
credit for transforming the good doctor's 
quirks into his own. In the 
born out of "Da Ali G Show," Cohen's satirical cult-hit series, with a single goal in mind -seek and annoy . 
Unscripted and unrestrained, "Da Ali G Show" was Cohen's first taste of success. Originally created for the United Kingdom's Channel 4, the show gained global recognition with its second and third seasons, both broad­cast on HBO. Cohen used his relative obscurity to fully inhabit his three creations. 
Whether he was assuming the guise of Briino, a limp-wristed, flamboyant fashion reporter, the obnoxious, misogynistic Borat or hip-hop poser Ali G -the self-proclaimed "voice of da youth" -Cohen turned journalis­tic integrity on its head. In each show, he badg­ered his interviewees while hiding behind a mockin6 ignorance. Long before Ashton Kutcher was adding Punk'd to the national lex­icon, Cohen was sho\\ing him how it's done ­with more intelligence and, consequently, far more significance. 
Born in southern England, Cohen was the second of three sons and attended the presti­gious University of Cambridge, where he stud­ied history. Crude humor may be his forte, but Cohen was on the path towards a PhD before taking a detour into comedy. Cohen's success across the pond prompted an invitation to deliver the 2004 Class Day address at Harvard University. Of course, he appeared in character as Ali G, but Harvard students surely had no complaints about their unorthodox guest. 
like all fine actors, Cohen is as methodical as he is hysterical. He's known for arriving on talk shows and in public as his oddball characters, not unlike more reputed thespians like Christian Bale. Bale maintained his American accent for "Batman Begins" press tours, and Cohen has done the same for every "Borat" appearance -reveling in his broken, faux­Kazakh English. 
While each of his creations is a distinct mani­festation of Cohen's comedic brilliance, it's Borat who's finally bringing the British comedi­an the mainstream acclaim he so richly deserves. His feature film opened at No. 1 at the box office this past weekend, despite the misguided apprehension of movie moguls at Twentieth Century Fox. 
Worried that the film's offensive humor would dissuade audiences, the studio slashed its debut from 2,000 theaters nationwide to just 837. Regardless, the film delivered an esti­
mated haul of $26,455,463 ­

crude but socially aware humor to win the hearts of fans for years. Although the man is a devout Jew, Cohen's Borat is as anti-Semitic as any character in fic­tion. These seeming contradictions are what separate Cohen from his peers. He's never shied away from revealing the truth-that racism is still an issue, as is the ugliness of big­otry -through uproariously tactless skits. 
The millions generated by Borat's feature­length foray reveals one indisputable fact ­Cohen can no longer be ignored. He has arrived in spectacular fashion, with as much flourish as any of his screen personas. Hollywood's finest have certainly taken notice. with Brad Pitt among those slavering at the chance to appear alongside one of the comic's zany creations. 
Cohen's journey since his fateful meeting with that Russian doctor has been a strange, circuitous one. And while Borat's birth may have been one of happenstance, there's noth­ing coincidental about Cohen's rising star sta­tus. After all, there are plenty of words -some not so niee, in Borat's words -to describe both the man and his counterparts. 
Uncharismatic is not one of them.

DVD REVIEW 












Masterful'Brazil' DVD accentuates classic 


By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 
Terry Gilliam's 1985 film "Brazil" was one of the most misunderstood pictures of its time, but its reputation has grown over the ensuing decades, and it is now regard­ed as one of the finest pictures of the 1980s. Uke Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner," it depicts a dystopian future that creepily resembles modern times, but it replaces that film's noirish tendencies with an absurdist vision of a bureaucratic dictator­ship. 
The Criterion version of "Brazil" is Gilliam's original director's cut, which runs 142 minutes and combines footage from both the American and the European releases. Gilliam is perhaps best known as a member of the comedy troupe Monty Python (he co­a complex, insular, often difficult picture about a bleak totalitarian future (though the film takes place "sometime in the 20th century"), which was a shocking shift from the absurdist comedy Gilliam imbued in the Monty Python films. Despite frequent flights of fancy, "Brazil" is mostly a down­beat f:tlm, with pointed satire and jagged political and social commentary -it's hard to explain how a film can be whimsi­cal and cynical at once, but "Brazil" com­bines the mentality of Orwell with the cre­ativity of "Star Wars" -era Lucas. It's also a maddening, oft-brilliant picture that stut­ters at times over the course of its two and a half hours, though the "Love Conquers All" cut demonstrates that shortening the film would only have a detrimental effect. 
What makes "Brazil" so powerful is not only Gilliam's creative vision, as stunning 
and encompassing as that 
is, but the talent with 

brainchild. 
Gilliam had control over the film and arranged a 142-minute cut, which was badly received by Universal executives, who then cut nearly an hour out of the film, to a running time of 94 minutes. This cut, commonly referred to as the "Love Conquers All" version, is avail­able on the third disc of the box set. Radically different from Gilliam's director's cut, it demonstrates just how much effect editing can have on a picture. 
Ultimately, however, it's easy to see why Universal was so apprehensive. "Brazil" is 
Dead," "Shakespeare in 

Love"}, and the film stars Jonathan Pryce ("Tomorrow Never Dies," "Pirates of the Caribbean"} and promi­nently features Robert DeNiro. The cre­ative production design is one of the movie's most appealing elements, though Gilliam admits on the DVD that some con­sidered it a sensation overload. 
"Brazil" was originally released by Criterion back in 1999 (spine No. 51), but has recently been re-released. The new release is, in many ways, the same as the old, with one major difference. The origi­nal transfer was not anamorphic (meaning it did not "stretch" properly to f:tll widescreen televisions}, which means a lot more in 2006 than it did in 1999. 
According to Criterion, the new release has an "all­new, restored high-defini­tion transfer, supervised and approved by director Terry Gilliam, with a 
remastered Dolby stereo surround soundtrack." In other words, "Brazil" looks and sounds great, which is really a necessity in a film that is so visual­ly and aurally loaded. 
The DVD is available in two versions, a single-disc version, and a three-disc "Ultimate Special Edition Box." Though the three-disc version may be slight overkill for casual fans of the film, ·it's a must for both fans of Gilliam and film enthusiasts. The most substantial special feature is the 56 minute documentary "The Battle of Brazil: A Video History," which explores the controversy that sur­rounded the film. 
Both versions of "Brazil" contain a fea­ture-length audio commentary by Gilliam, which is interesting and insightful -it's obvious that the director takes great pride in the film. 
The second disc also contains a thirty minute on-set documentary called "What is Brazil?" as well as storyboards, draw­ings, stills, behind-the-scenes footage, video interviews and the original trailer. The 94-minute "Love Conquers All" cut contains a feature-length audio essay by journalist David Morgan, who retreads a

lot of ground from "The Battle of Brazil" in explaining the controversy over the film and its numerous cuts. 
The packaging, an often overlooked aspect of a DVD's presentation, is also excellent. The box set comes in a slipcase that depicts clouds and the neon logo for the film. Inside the case are three individ­ual keepcases with varying angles of the same photograph. There is also a small booklet that contains an essay by Jack Mathews, movie critic and author of "Battle of Brazil." 
"Brazil" is an essential piece of cinema. Named the Los Angeles Critics Circle Film of the Year in 1985, it has since become regarded as a classic, with Time magazine recently declaring it one of the 100 great­est films of all time. An imaginative and creative examination of politics and socie­ty, it remains a high-water mark for its director, and 1980s cinema. While the sin­gle-disc edition may be enough for most, the lavish box set is, for once, an "Ultimate Special Edition" that lives up to its name.

Associated Press -University of Miami defensive lineman Bryan Pata was shot and killed Tuesday night, shortly after leaving the practice field, school officials said. The shooting occurred at the apartment complex where Pata lived, about 4 miles from campus. His death was ruled a homi­cide, Miami-Dade police spokesman Roy Rutland said. "Right now, we're just gathering ourselves and just trying to pull ourselves together," Miami athletic director Paul Dee said. Hutland said police were called at 7:30 p.m. to the 
scene and found Pata's body in the parking lot. The 22-year-old senior who grew up in Miami was pronounced dead at the scene. 
The circumstances around Pata's death were not immediately clear, and Miami-Dade police did not say who made the 911 call after the shooting. 
The 6-foot-4, 280-pound lineman was in his fourth year with the Hurricanes. He appeared in 41 games, making 23 starts, and was expected to be selected in next spring's NFL draft. 
Word spread quickly around campus, and grief counselors were quickly 
summoned to work with Pata's teammates. 
Annette Ponnock. Miami's student body pres­ident, said Pata -a fierce player on the field and a somewhat soft-spoken one off it -was well known and popular on campus. 
"Everyone is just more surprised than anything else," Ponnock said. "He's such a personality on cam­pus. It was just really, really shocking to have such a loss.... He was a big guy so it was kind of hard to miss him. He just had a presence about 
h. .. 
Ill. 
The Hurricanes used Pata primarily at defensive tackle this season, and he had 13 tackles and two sacks. 

Miami is supposed to play at No. 23 Maryland Saturday. There has not been any announcement about whether that game will happen as scheduled. 
Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner John Swofford was aware of the shooting and was working with Miami offi­cials to gather informa­tion, conference spokes­woman Amy Yakola said. 
It was at least the fourth time that tragedy involving a player has struck the Hurricanes in recent years. 
IN BRIEF 

Sanders convinces coaches of readiness and comes back strong 
INDIANAPOLIS -Bob Sanders watched his Indianapolis Colts team­mates get run over for five weeks. The Pro Bowl safety couldn't bear seeing it again. 
After convincing team doctors and coach Tony Dungy he could play with a solid pregame workout, Sanders helped Indianapolis produce one of its best defensive performances of the season in one of its most critical games. 
"I was pretty sure he wasn't going to play, and he was pretty adamant that he could," coach Tony Dungy said Monday. "So I let him run with the trainers before the game to see if he could go. We waited until about 10 minutes before we had to send in the inactive list." 
He gave Indianapolis' leaky run defense the backbone it had been missing in previous games when Tennessee, Denver and Washington overpowered the Colts on the ground. 
Rose signs one-year, $1.5 million deal with Suns 
PHOENIX -Jalen Rose signed with the. Phoenix Suns on Tuesday and is expected to be in uniform at San Antonio on Wednesday. 
The former Indiana Pacer, who received a $14.5 million buyout from the New York Knicks last week, will receive about $1.5 mil­lion in his one-year deal with Phoenix. just over the NBA veteran·s minimum. 
The 33-year-old guard-forward has averaged 14.7 points over 894 games in 12 NBA seasons. He is joining an offensive-minded, fast­paced team that has struggled to a 1-3 start this season. 
Rose had narrowed his choices to Phoenix and Miami, then announced on his Web site Friday that he decided on the Suns. He said he wanted to play for a team with a legitimate shot at the NBA title. 
"It's not about personal stats," Rose said Monday. 
Boxer and gang leader Tanner 
convicted on drug charges 
HAMMOND -Former light heavy­weight boxer Charles "Duke" Tanner, a reputed leader of Gary's Renegades street gang, was convicted of federal drug and conspiracy charges that 
.. 

could put him behind bars the rest of his life. 
Tanner, who won 90 fights as an amateur and was 19-0 as a profes­sional before his arrest in 2004, was found guilty Monday on two counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and a single count of possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine. 
The 26-year-old fighter was con­sidered one of the brightest talents to come through Gary's Police Athletic League gym. 
"When he wasn't boxing, Charles Tanner was busy becoming leader of one of the street gangs known as the Renegades," said Assistant U.S. Attorney David Nozick during his closing statement.

Players struggle in national tourney 

Four falter in first round at Ohio State 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Wrirer 

'-Notre Dame ran into some tough competition at the ITA National Indoor Championships this weekend at Ohio State. Four of six Irish players lost in the first round while the dou­bles team of junior Brook Buck and sophomore Kelcy Tefft lost 8-6 in the semifinals to No. 4 seed Megan Moulton-Levy and Katarina Zoricic of William and Mary. No. 24-ranked TCU's Anna Sydorska and Ana Cetnik bounced Notre Dame's No. 3 doubles team of seniors Christian

finals of the tour­nament grabbed eight of the next nine games for the victory. The Thompsons dropped to 6-2 on 
the year in doubles play. 
"TCU hit the ball big, and the indoor courts at Ohio State were very fast," Irish coach Jay Louderback said. "They were a good team and their game is suited for indoor play." 
Despite the early exit, Louderback is not worried about the Thompson sisters' play. 
The duo defeated Duke and Florida's No. 1 doubles teams in the tournament's consolation draw, before losing 8-6 to Cal's Susie Babos and Zsuzsanna Fodor. 
"They played very well there, so there are no problems," Louderback said. 
Tefft and Buck defeated Georgia Tech's Kristi Miller and Alison Silverio 8-5 in the open­ing round of play and knocked off Lauren Macfarlane and Nicola Slater of Florida State 8­4 in the quarterfinals, before losing to Moulton-Levy and Zoricic. 

"They had a great tourna­ment," Louderback said. "They just lost a heartbreaker in the semifinals. They've been play­ing great all year. We're hoping to get two teams into the NCAAs this year." 
Freshman Cosmina Ciobanu lost to Georgia Tech's Miller 6­3, 6-1 -who is ranked third in the country in singles play. 
"It didn't go so well. She was a really good player," Ciobanu said. 'The first set was a little closer, but once she got up on me, she got me."

Joining Hansbrough were juniors Joakim Noah of Florida, Ronald Steele of Alabama and Glen Davis of LSU and sophomore Brandon Rush of Kansas. 
The 2006-07 team was decidedly different from the season before when four sen­iors and a junior were picked for the preseason honors. 
Hansbrough was named on 65 of the 72 ballots, one more than Noah. Steele received 55 votes, while Davis had 51 and Rush 26. 
Hansbrough was the key to North Carolina's surprising season that saw the Tar Heels go from unranked to 1Oth in the final poll. He averaged 
18.9 points and 7.9 rebounds and made Carolina fans and coar.h Roy Williams very happy when he decided to return for a second season in Chapel Hill. "I've never really known a

Rielley and Ciobanu both dropped their first-round con­solation matches.

"It was really exciting that both Colleen and I qualified for this," Ciobanu said. "It was a great experience."

BLOOMINGTON -Terry Hoeppner has played the steady steward all season ­mostly holding his emotional pleas in check. 
With the Indiana Hoosiers now needing a late-season boost, it's time for the excitable coach to pull out his best pep talk. 
or anybody else." Indiana's collapse couldn't have come at a worse time. 
At 5-5 (3-3), the Hoosiers had seemingly built confidence after three October wins raised hopes of a bowl bid. Last Saturday's inexplicable per­formance, a 63-26 loss to the Golden Gophers, crushed that momentum in front of a repre­sentative from 
close.' So there is this unspo­ken pressure, and I've told them there is no pressure." 
But now the quest to become bowl-eligible for the first time since 1993 is more difficult. 
This week in their home finale, the Hoosiers face No. 2 Michigan, which escaped Ball State's upset bid last week and has one of the nation's top 
defenses. Then 
Indiana, and Wisconsin did the same as it jumped to a 52-0 lead on Sept. 
If it happens 
again, the 

Hoosiers' post­season prospects could be doomed. 
Hoeppner has already tried moving players, replacing starters, trying freshmen and changing coverages to plug holes. 
But, as Saturday demonstrat­ed, there's still a major prob­lem. 
"Defensive back was my posi­tion, and I hate to admit it now because people say I hope you were a better player than a coach," Hoeppner joked. "Before the Minnesota game, I said 'If I were them, I'd play­action pass and throw it deep.' Fifty-eight yards later... " 
So what's wrong and what's the solution? 
"We've spent hours trying to patch up and repair things, try­ing to replace individuals," Hoeppner said. 
Indiana has rallied before. 
It's come back from double­digit deficits three times this season, but what they must show now is more resiliency. 
Hoeppner has a plan. He wants his players and coaches to work harder, concentrate more and challenge themselves to perform better. 
And they must play with more emotion. 
"I was disappointed and have even used the word embarrass­ing ber:ause I didn't think we had a game like that in us," Hoeppner said. "We didn't play with the same energy and enthusiasm Saturday that we had playing with and we need to do that this week."

NFL 




Jets' punter discovered by Mangini after Down Under kick 
Former Australian soccer player Graham now in second season 

Associated Press HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.-Ben Graham's journey to the NFL began with a long kick over a big river in Australia. Sounds like the premise· of a heartwarming children's tale, except this one's true. New ..:_ York Jets coach Eric Mangini saw the tape that proved it. "He kicked the ball over the Yarra River, and that was it for me," Mangini said, recalling the jaw-dropping video he saw nine years ago. Graham was competing in a made-for-television event that featured some of the strongest legs in the Australian Football League, where he was a star for the Geelong Cats. He made it to the final of the competi­tion and had to kick it as far as he could into Melbourne's main river. "He kicked it over, and at that point, what he was doing with that ball, I was kind of curious to see what he could do for us," said Mangini, who was then an assistant with the Jets. Mangini offered him a chance to try out for the team and Graham briefly flirted with the idea. "Eric saw the footage before I sent the DVDs out to get my name out there on the radar in America, but he was the first one to see," Graham said in his warm Australian accent. "He worked me out and that start­ed the ball rolling." And just like a boomerang, the two are back together ­even though it took a while. Graham is in his second sea­son booming punts for the Jets, and ranks ninth in the NFL with a 38.6-yard net average. It would be higher if' not for 61-and 56-yard punts earlier this season that were negated by penalties. Not bad for a guy who knew nothing about punt­ing until last summer. "If someone had asked me two years ago and said that in two years time, 'This is where you'd be,' I would've taken it hands down," Graham said. The 33-year-old Graham was considered mostly a novelty last summer when Herman Edwards brought him into training camp to compete with veteran Micah Knorr. But with each left-footed, end-over-end thump, it became apparent Graham was the real deal. He had an impressive rookie season in which he had a net average of 37.9 yards. When Mangini took over as the Jets' coach, it was a no-brainer that he'd keep Graham. "He has incredible strength," said special teams coordinator Mike Westhoff, who previously coached Pro Bowlers Reggie Roby, Matt Turk and Rohn Stark. "Ben is really capable, not that he's one of those guys, but I'm familiar with very good football players and Ben Graham is a talented man and has really done. a heck of a job adapting to a skill that's in a lot of ways foreign to him." The Jets have considered using Graham on kickoffs because of his strong leg, but Westhoff said that will have to wait a while until he becomes more familiar with the kicking motion. The team has also 
entertained thoughts of getting the 6-foot-5, broad-shouldered Graham more involved in the offense. 
A punter lining up at tight end? It could happen, especial­ly with Mangini's penchant for trying new things. 
"We've worked on some of that stuff. and he has done some things situationally," Mangini said. "Punters are tough to get, and punters of his caliber are tougher to get. So there is always that risk­reward of getting too involved 
situationally and then losing them." 
Graham welcomes the idea of going out for a pass. 
"I know I've got the skills to contribute elsewhere," he said. "But it's a game where you concentrate on your job. If something happens down the track, we'll definitely work on that to the point where we know it's going to work in an NFL game." 
The precedent had already been set for Australians to come over to the NFL, with 
Darren Bennett doing it 12 years ago. But Graham had never actually punted before. 
''I've kicked a ball ever since I could walk, so the kicking technique was a natural thing," Graham said. "To con­fine the technique just to a punting action was the hard part. A consistent stepping pat­tern, a consistent drop." 
Graham was given some lee­way last season when it came to the types of punts he was asked to do, but refined his footwork and technique in the offseason. 
"I was just pretty much look­ing to get the ball down the field the best I could last year," he said. "So this year, there are expectations and standards and trying to capitalize on field position and the rest of it." 
One big surprise for Graham was having to hold the ball on field-goal attempts. So, he spent countless hours practic­ing with kicker Mike Nugent, taking snaps and learning how to place the ball down correct­ly.

Louisville not just about horses and hookshots anymore 
Associated Press 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -In a city hooked on long shots and jump shots, college football has long been a diversion, something for fall Saturdays before the horses start running at Churchill Downs and the 
Louisville  basketball  team  
packs Freedom Hall.  
"There  were  good  seats  

available, any day, any time with any number of people you 
wanted to bring as a guest," Mayor Jerry Abramson said. "Those days are over." 
Are they ever. 
Two decades ago, former coach Howard Schnellenberger -who led Miami to a national title in 198 3 -later took a decidedly lower-profile job with the Cardinals. He raised more than a few eyebrows when he said Louisville was "on a collision course with the national championship, the only variable is time." Those words have proved prophetic. 
With a month to go in the season, No. 3 Louisville (8-0, 3­0 Big East) controls its destiny in the chase for a berth in the Bowl Championship Series title game. 
And perhaps just as remark­able, football's popularity is making inroads in a basketball town where March Madness never really ends.

star players like quarterback Brian Brohm and the phrase "R U Ready?" line the free­ways. Jerseys with No. 12 (Brohm) or No. 19 (injured running back Michael Bush) are the clothing option of choice at sparkling Papa John's Stadium for home games. 
And Internet chat rooms hum with speculation and jubilation over Louisville's lofty ranking and the futures of Brohm and coach Bobby Petrino. 
The basketball team, mean­while, began practice three weeks ago with little fanfare. Rick Pitino's team was in the Final Four less than two years ago but is coming off a 21-13 season and was relegated to the NIT. 
Sure, there was the usual sellout crowd of more than 18,000 fans at Freedom Hall for an exhibition win over Georgetown (Ky.) College on Nov. 1. Yet most of the buzz wasn't over freshman forward Derrick Caracter, but the foot­ball team's chances against West Virginia the next night. 
After coaching under the microscope for ,years -first at Kentucky, now at Louisville -Pitino doesn't mind if the scrutiny shifts a little ways down the street from Freedom Hall to the aptly named Howard Schnellenberger Football Complex. 
"It's helping us in one sense in that it takes the attention away from us and let's us focus in on ourselves," said Pitino, whose team was not ranked in the preseason Top 25 in any major poll. "Our players see that kind of excellence and it only helps us." 
Former basketball coach Denny Crum led the Cardinals to NCAA titles in 1980 and 1986 and now co-hosts a sports talk show with former Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall. Normally this time of year the phone lines are jammed with Kentucky and Louisville sup­porters already debating the outcome of their annual bas­ketball clash. 
Instead, Crum and Hall spend most of the show talking 
to callers theorizing over what the Cardinals have to do to make it to the BCS title game. 
"The interest in the football team is off' the scale and bas­ketball's taken kind of a hind seat," Crum said. "I don't think you'll really start hearing about the basketball team until the football team loses." 
Which might not be until January, if at all. And unlike the football team's last bout with success Schnellenberger led the Cardinals to their only New Year's bowl victory by winning the 1991 Fiesta Bowl only to leave four years later -Crum doesn't think this year's team is an aberration. 
"I think where they're at right now is where they're going to stay," Crum said. "This is something that's only going to build." 
Literally. Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich is propos­ing a plan that would expand capacity at Papa John's Stadium _ which isn't even a decade old _ from 42,000 to 63,600 by 2010. For the first time in the program's history, there is a waiting list for sea­son tickets and merchandise sales have never been stronger, thanks in large part to national television appear­ances the last few years under Petrino. 
Pt}trino and Pitino insist th'ey're not trying to win a pop­ularity contest. While the foot­ball team has all attention right now, the basketball pro­gram has all the championship banners. 
"The tradition we have in basketball is something we're trying to get to," Petrino said. 
Both coaches stop short of calling Louisville a "football school" or a "basketball school." They feel there's plen­ty of room for both. 
"We're very secure in who we are and what we stand for and we're very humble about ourselves," Pitino said. "We're not looking to be king. Kings arc for people who are part of royalty. We're just looking to have our excellence when we play, that's it."

second big guy, the 'four man' guarding him." 
The sophomore forward was involved in even more plays where his name didn't show up in the stat sheets. Hillesland was a ball hound on Notre Dame's successful first-half full court press. He proved to be a great help defender. He also showed an ability to use his 6­foot-8, 225-pound frame to drive baseline. 
And those plays don't even account for the 360-degree pass he attempted in transition during the second half. Showtime anyone? 
"I don't know how fast Magic Johnson was, but I guess if you want to call me a little bit slow­er that's fine because I never played against him," Hillesland joked after the game. "I think [I could keep up with him in the race], especially nowadays because he's like eighty, so whatever." 
Irish senior Russell Carter smiled at the comparison Monday, saying that he doesn't mind going with Magic Johnson but he sees Hillesland more in the Larry Bird mold. 
"He's flashy, he knows what he's doing," Carter said. "It may not look like it, but he knows what he's doing. I see that every day in practice, I'm just happy he's out there." 
On a serious note, Hillesland could be a vital cog in Notre Dame's system this year with the regular season beginning Friday. The Irish have proven scorers in Carter and senior two guard Colin Falls, and a creative play maker in point guard Kyle McAlarney. 
They also have a trio of for­wards in Harangody, Kurz and sophomore Luke Zeller -a former McDonald's All­American who led the Irish in scoring Monday -who should handle most of the post duties. 

But a basketball team is only as good as its depth, and with Hillesland as the second or third man off the bench ­freshman point guard Tory Jackson has looked flashy and explosive this fall -he will create immediate mismatches against less athletic power for­wards when Notre Dame sees man defenses. 
"He's so creative like that, out there on the floor ... he does every thing, he passes, he can rebound it, he defends well, he can run the floor well," McAlarney said. "I love playing with those kind of guys because they get their job done." 
But more important than Hillesland's all-around ability -or his witty sense of humor -is his absolute command of the Notre Dame system. Brey has touted him as being the definitive leader in practice on 
the second team (the blue team). 
"When we go blue against white, Falls knows our system best on the · whites and Hillesland knows it really well on the blues," Brey said. "He's coaching all those young guys he's got with him on the blue team." _ 
And given Hillesland 's strong command of the offense so early in his Notre Dame career, the forward sees some improvements that need to be made as the Irish progress in their season. 
"I think we've still yet to put together forty solid minutes," Hillesland said. "We've had spurts here and there where we've played really well offen­J sively, really well defensively. Jl Now we've just got to start building on that."

Notre Dame finishes 11thinCalifornia Oassic 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 

Before the Irish teed off at the CordeValle Classic in San Martin, Calif. Monday, Irish coach Jim Kubinski said the field was tougher than any his team had seen all season. 
And unfortunately for the Irish, the competition in the event did not turn out to be any easier than it had seemed on paper. 
Despite recording a sea­son-low total score of five­over-par 869, the Irish fin­ished in 11th place out of the 17-team field -4 7 strokes behind the winner, Stanford. The Irish did, however, man­age to beat a top-25 oppo­nent, finishing five shots ahead of No. 22 TCU. 
Senior co-captain Cole Isban led the way for the Irish and finished tied for 19th place with a three­under-par 213. Isban, a sen­ior All-America candidate, also fired a career-best 66 during second round action Monday.
