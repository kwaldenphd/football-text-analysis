Father Van's unilateral pizza freeze 
The folks at Domino's are happy. No doubt, mirth is rampant at Godfather's, too. Not to mention Barnaby's, Aurelio's, Pizza Hut. Bruno's and Rocco's. Why are all of these people so happy? 
Because FatherJohn Van Wolvlear will likely han the sale ofstudent-made pizzas on campus next semester. 
That 12-inch pepperoni which used to be a phone call and a trip downstairs away will be replaced, if Van Wolvlear has his way, with Notre Dame's answer to Coney Island: the hot dog. 
Does all of this seem a little ridiculous? Why would Van Wolvlear shut down all of the pizza-making es­tablishments on the campus? And would Leprechaun Pizza Service benefit the most from the closing offood sales? 
Unanswered 4uestions abound -too many to believe that pizza sales may shut down only because of the violations contained in the recent inspection. 
For instance:

What is the sense in allowing hot dogs to be sold, but not pizzas? Hot dogs must he cooked, just as pizzas are, and hot dogs can he stored just as improperly as pep· peroni. By banning pizzas, Van Wolvlear will not ac­complish anything in terms of cleanliness; he will only get rid ofpizzas.

campus governments convinced Van Wolvlear that 
happy hours weren't as destructive as he had thought. 
hut not before weeks ofcontroversy and confusion had 
passed. 
Again, Van Wolvlear is threatening to take action 
without realizing the implications or merits of the act. 
His hot dog suggestion will not cure any of the ills of 
food sales. Banning the sales ofpizzas only will increase 
costs to students while cutting deeply into the funding 
ofhalls. 
The obvious solution would be for campus health of· ficials to assist food sales managers to maintain dean operations. The right thing to do would be: to give managers a chance to clean up. as many have done al· ready. 
But that seems too easy, doesn't it? Perhaps that's why everyone is so suspicious.

long distance calling company in the South Bend area, with about 2500 customers. 
Like lnfonet, Saverline also will not charge students a monthly users fee. Usually Saverline users are charged $7. SO per month. Charles Hutson, a Saverline representative, said, "Saverline calls are discounted up to 45/ with an average savings per call ofbetween 30 and 35/." 
When a student signs up for Saverline he receives a personal identification number and a local number to call when he wants to make a long distance call. This is be­cause Saverline has their switching facilities in South Bend, which 

· directs calls out. Because Saverline's switching facilities arc in South Bend, calls can be made on the Saverline network from any phone in the South Bend area. 
Saverline is offering a drawing for two free trips to Florida over Spring Break. Hutson says this is "to call at­tention to' our service." 
Students may also choose to receive MCl, which is the largest long distance company in the na· tion. A student also gets a local call­ing number as well as a S digit personal code from MCI. MCl, like Saverline can be used from any phone in the South Bend area, and the bill can be sent anywhere, as can Saverline's bills. 
MCI has three types of service to choose from. The fulltime plan al­lows a student to call at any time. It has a Sl 0 per month service charge, and calls on it save an average of 35­40/. Also available is the Supersaver plan, which has a $5 per month service charge. It lets a student call from 4 p.m. to 10 a.m. the next day, and all weekends and holidays. Calls on it are discounted the same as on the full time plan. 
The basic plan has a one time service fee of SI 0, however calls on it are discounted only S-IS/. Calling hours on the basic plan are the same a~> those on the Supersaver plan. 
The rates from all the companies are all fairly close. A call from Notre Dame to the west coast after I I p.m. will cost approximately I9 cents per minute on Infonet, I 7 cents a minute with MCI's Supersaver package, and I 5 cents on Saverline. 
A call from Notre Dame to the east coast is I7 cents per 60 seconds with Infonet, I5 cents on MCI, and I4 cents with Saverline. The same call to the east coast between 5 and I I p.m. costs 22 cents per minute, I9 cents per minute, and 23 cents per minute, on Infonet, MCI, and Saverline respectively.

Final exam code tests faculty patience 
It is easy to get the impression that certain ad­ministralOrs don't care about faculty and student opinion, especially in light of the Academic Council's review on final exams. 
The committee's primary goal is "just improving the 
University." To at least a few thousand people around 
<.:ampus, it is not obvious that reforming finals will reach 
that end. 

The proposal would eliminate senior exemptions, en­
force the final-exam mandate and increase the weight of 
exams to a minimum of one-third and a maximum of 
two-thirds of th~: semester grade. 

The University Academic Council chose to delay ac­tion on the proposal, and with good reason. Even Father James Burt<.:hadl, a supporter of the changes, admitted that the proposal "raises very large pedagogical issues, and it's been so long since the Council has had the op­portunity to discuss something pedagogical." 
The proposal seems ill-advised not only because ten­
sions between the administration and faculty already 
are strained, but because it would set a dangerous 
precedent. 

Many professors ignore Du Lac as it is. Several give 
non-cumulative tests, since comprehensive exams 
would force them to add another test a week or two 
before finals. Others prefer to substitute an extensive 
research paper for a final exam, believing that papers 
provide a greater learning experience than rehashing 
old material. 

In some classes, a final exam (let alone one that counts 33 to 67 percent ofthe final grade) seems out of place. Art classes, computer programing and some seminar classes come to mind. 
Few ofour nation's top schools enforce such policies, and those with similar restrictions allow a weeldong "reading period" before the start of exams. Still others 
require a senior thesis before graduation. In the end, individual professors are in the best posi­tion to decide whether a course should have a final ex­
am, how much such an exam should count and whether or not seniors should be exempt. Some professors have threatened the University's 
move, with a "just let them try it" philosophy. In order to enforce its decision, the University would have little choice but to fire teachers who fail to comply. Such a price seems unfair for such a dubious goal. 
Yes, the Academic Commission should be concerned with the academic quality of the University. But telling professors what to do -in short, dictating their teach­
ing philosophy -is the wrong way. And if anybody cares, students aren't too hot on the idea either.

prohkms whk·h alti:ct their welfare. The 
Knights of Columbus inddt·nt. The Obsert('T 
"St·andal" and the "go stand in the corner and 
kt·t·p qukt" mt·ntality. all reflect a dangerous 
and disturbing pattt·rn of paranoid pater· 
nalism. 
The fact that I only karned of Food sales prohlt-ms hy glancing at an Obsen<'T headline is tt·stimony to the breakdown ofcommunica· tion ht·tween studt·nts and the incrt·asingly is­
olated Dome. 
I am insultt·d, Fr. Van. that you did not consider my opinions or input important, or tvt·n pertint·nt -and I wonder how you ex· p<'l"t t'ooperation from a group of students you rduse to acknowledge. 
l'lThaps such language is a bit strong; howt·ver. tht"Sl' art· the unmistakahk li:elings gt·nt·rated by unilateral thrt·ats and doSt·d· door committt'l" mtt·tings. 
llad any Food sales managers bt·en con-suited, these are perhaps a few suggestions we 

would havt.· presented: 
First ofall, the reason conditions arc so atro­
cious is not due to the ddillerate efforts of 
food sales managers. On the contrary, the 
problem exists because students operating 
these facilities have littk or no background in 
the food-services business. The conditions ex­
ist out of ignorance, and the best solution to 
this is education. 
The University could hold workshops for 
food sales managers and their employees, ex­
plaining and demonstrating proper health and 
safety procedures. Student managers could 
learn what is expected ofthem and University 
personnel could be assigned the task of 
working with individual halls and the 
problems peculiar to their business. 
Secondly, a permit system could he in­
itiated by the University where, upon passing 
an initial health and safety inspection, a stu· 
dent manager would be granted a permit to 
serve his hall. Additional inspections would 
be done periodically, and retention of a per­
mit would be contingent on satisfactory in· 
spection reports. 
Eventually. once certain standards and procedures had been outlined, the permit sys­tem could be transferred to hall governments, who would administer to their respective halls. 
These are two reasonable and practical solutions to the food sales sales problem. Fr. Van and the Rectors Committee would be wise to consider them before taking action. An acceptable compromise can be reached if the University is willing to act responsibly and reasonably. 
We stand at a crossroads, Fr. Van -either accept the challenge ofcooperation and work with food sales managers to improve health and safety conditions, or act unilaterally to in­stall your own food sales policy, only further ceml·nting the University's image of being militant and reactionary, and isolating your office even further fro.n the respect and sup­port of the students.

bath!Ub gin. Although I applaud the University 
for taking a serious look at the use of alcohol 
on campus, I must consider the dry campus 
option as detrimental to an already serious 
and delicate problem. 
We must look at reality before we try to solve this problem; alcohol is a major com­ponent of the social life here and until we 
change that attitude, students will feel the need to drink to celebrate, cope and forget. 
By prohibiting the use of alcohol, we are not prohibiting the students to drink, we are only forcing them to work a little harder at obtaining and using it In essence, we are not solving the problem, just whitewashing it so we can not notice it so readily. 
We should take a positive approach towards addressing this problem, instead of the negative, prohibitive action. First, we can attack the alcoholic attitude by strongly encouraging and organizing nonalcoholic ac· tivities as a permanent solution. However, this takes time. Therefore, we also need a more direct immediate plan. 
Ifwe recognize alcohol abuse as a personal problem, not merely a disciplinary problem, even for the first-timer. and if we recognize that responsible drinking is a realistic ex­pectation and skill, we can begin to affect the situation immediately. 
Swift and strong response to anyone found intoxicated is necessary. This response should include counseling, retribution for any damage and a general discussion and possible reformation of the student's attitude towards alcohol. Of course, this must be strictly and very consistently enforced in order to have any effect. 
But we must be willing to invest the needed time, effort and money into our campus. In this manner we treat the cause, not the symptoms of the alcohol problem, and we talce a positive step towards mature and responsible handling of alcohol, instead of a negative step towards behind closed doors abuse.

Everybody says that it is a rebuilding year for us and it is hard to disagree. We like to use the word building, though, because our program is still aspiring." 
Northwestern now stands at 3-l, its one loss coming at the hands of Loyola of Chicago. 
Last year's NIT tournament was the first ever post-season ap­pearance for the Wildcats. Just making it to a tournament was quite a boost for Northwestern; conse· quently, its win over Notre Dame did wonders for the program. 
Northwestern's pressure defense. 
"We did something Saturday we had to do," says DiStanislao. "We played consistently for the whole game and the players did as they were told. We'll have to do the same thing against Northwestern. They have some real tenacious players 
and, despite losing five letterwin­ners, Northwestern has a tradition that always maltes them tough to beat." 
Much of that tradition which the Wildcat women's basketball program has comes from DiStanislao herself, who coached NU for five years before moving to Notre Dame. DiStanislao led the Wildcats from obscurity to national prominence in her five years there, compiling a 90­27 mark and leading the Wildcats to

"It (the NIT win) brought credit to our program," comments Falk. "We are labelled as a winner on the outside now. And once you are recognized for post-season acheive­ment," Falk continues, "it's uplifting. It's obvious. We see it every day in our players."

Revenge on their mind 
Irish travel to Northwestern 
ByJEFF BLUMB 
AssistantSports Editor 
With revenge on its mind, the Notre Dame basketball team travels to Evanston, Ill., tonight to face Northwestern. The Irish will be hoping to avenge last year's 7l·S7 NIT opening·round loss to the Wildcats, which ended a nine-game Notre Dame domination dating back to the 1960-6 I season. 
In order to beat Northwestern, Notre Dame will have to contain the fine forwards of the 'Cats, Art Aaron and Andre Goode. Northwestern's second-leading scorer last season with an average of 14. S points per game, the 6-8, 200-pound Aaron is the the 'Cats top offensive threat. 
Aaron started all 30 Northwestern games last year, shooting S 1 percent from the field on his way to being an honorable mention on the all-Big Ten team. A streak shooter, Aaron is also one of the Wildcats' top defensive players, as shown by the fact that he led Northwestern in steals last year with 47. 
"Aaron is a very, very quick for­ward who has good ability to get open and get a shot off," says Irish coach Digger Phelps. "Our concern is our matchup to him. He plays like a Magic Johnson with his size and ballhandling ability. We really don't have somebody that quick defensively to play him." 
Goode is the other big Northwes­tern threat. The 6-10, 22S-pound junior averaged 9.8 points per game a year ago playing out of position at the center slot. Playing in all 30 games last year as Aaron did, Goode also had a team-leading 6.7 
rebounds per game and was the 
Wildcats' top shot blocker with 22 on the season. 
"Goode is a dangerous shooter when he gets open shots in their transition game," says Phelps. "He's also very strong inside. 
"That's the key to beating Northwestern," Phelps continues. "I think if you can control those two people defensively, then I think you're controlling Northwestern." 
Playing at center for Northwes­tern tonight will be 6-8, 230-pounct senior Paul Schultz. As the NU sixth man last year, Schultz averaged only 
2.7 points and 2.1 rebounds per 
game. 

The Wildcats start a pair of fresh­man at the guard spots. One is 6-7 Chris Berg, who averaged 16.9 points as a senior in high school, and

DiStanislao's homecoming 
ND women take on Wildcats 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports /iclilor 
The Notre Dame women's basket­hall team, now that it is beginning to t·arn some national recognition after its victory over UCLA last Saturday, faces an evt·n tougher challenge than it did hdore it picked up the big win. It has to prove that it deserves 
to he among the top teams in the country. Tht· first test that Mary DiStanis­lao's squad must pass comes tonight 
when it travels to Evanston, Ill., to take on the Lady Wildcats of Northwestern in its first road game ofthe year. It will not be an easy task for the Irish, although Northwestern has already lost twice this season. Both of those losses came to nationally-ranked teams, including No. I Southern Cal which escaped 
from  Evanston  with  a  67-6S  
overtime  victory  - the  closest  
game USC has had this year.  

-·we don't want to be known as a flash in the pan," says DiStanislao. 
Saint Mary's falls to Hope College, 60-47 
By DAVE WILSON 
.\f}()rts Writer 
Failing to carry over the team spirit and drive they used so d­fectivcly against Franklin College on Saturday, the Saint Mary's basketball team dropped a hard-fought 60-47 contest to the Flying Dutch of Hope College last night at Angela Athletic Facility. The Bdles' record now stands at 2-3 as they prepare for a two-game road trip this weekend. 
"We just weren't mentally on top of our game tonight," said junior center Elaine Suess. "I think we were so fired up from the Franklin game that we just expected more than we actually put out." 
Plagued by turnovers and poor passing, Saint Mary's seemed to have a hard time concentrating on their offensive patterns. The Belles also found foul trouble right from the start, as forwards Cyndy Short and Beth Kreher each committed three fouls after just II minutes ofplay. 
"I think you can't point to just one reason for our losing tonight", com­mented Saint Mary's head coach 
see HOPE, page 5 
"We have to come out ready to play a consistent 40 minutes every game." 
DiStanislao will be looking for the same consistency that her team showed against UCLA when Notre Dame takes the court tonight. After seeing how close the Wildcats came to pulling a major upset against USC, she knows that Anette Lynch's team wiU be looking to bring the Irish back to earth. 
TheWildcats' impressive showing this far has been somewhat of a surprise. Lynch lost five letterwin­ners from last year's I 7 -I 0 team. However, forward Anucha Browne and guards Laura Wiesen and Connie Erickson return from last year's squad to lead the team this year. 
"Anucha Browne is a fine all­around player, but Northwestern plays to its strength, which is the guards," explains DiStanislao. "They'll probably be trapping and pressing a lot. They look to Erickson to score, but it's Wiesen that con­trols the tempo and she can score as well. 
"I think they'll probably usc a 1-3­l half-court trap. Ifwe don't turn the ball over out front, we should be able to punch it inside."

Irish to face Wildcats, start 'Big Three' week 
Chuck Freeby 
Sports Writer ~-· 
~-----------1-ri_s_h_l-te_m__ ·~·s-----~.--. ~~ 
Hello again, everybody! 
Seeking revenge for last year's NIT loss, Digger Phelps and the Fighting Irish take to the road tonight to dt·dicatc the newly­refurbished McGaw Hall and to take on the Northwestt·rn Wildcats. Following tonight's game, the Irish return home to start the 19H3·84 version of "Big Three" week, playing host to Lehigh Saturday after­noon before preparing for contests with Cornell and perennial patsy Valparaiso. 
However, the way things have been going ti>r the Irish lately, maybe we shouldn't brush off any team. Phelps entered this season worried about outside shooting and rebounding, and he hasn't seen anything lately to calm his fears. Hopefully, the Irish can get their act together in Evanston tonight and come away from that snake pit known as McGaw Hall with a victory. 
" 

The St. Patrick's Day Massacre ... After failing to get an NCAA tournament berth, the Irish entered the NIT tournament last year with an "easy" first-round game against Northwestern at the Rosemont Horizon. After all, what team could beat the Irish on St. Patrick's Day? 
Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell Rich Falk's Wildcats they weren't supposed to win. After trailing by four at halftime, the Wildcats simply outplayed Notre Dame in the second half. Northwestern outrebounded the taller Irish, 43-2S, helping them coast to a 71-S7 win behind Art Aaron's 17 points. It was Northwes­tern's brightest basketball moment in quite some time, but it is also a painful memory that the Irish would like to erase tonight. 
A Word on the Wildcats ...Northwestern has lost three starters from last year's team, but Coach Rich Falk has a pair ofgood players back in Aaron and Andre Goode. Aaron is a 6-8 guard ( d.at:s right ­guard!) who loves to drive to the bucket, as he showed in the Notre Dame game last year when he collected l 7 points and nine rebounds in a forward role. Phelps compares Aaron with Magic Johnson be­cause of his size and ballhandling ability, but don't expect to see Aaron raking in a seven-figure contract or making commercials with Willie Shoemaker after the season's over. 
The 6-10 Goode spearheads a tall Northwestern front line, which includes 6-8 forward Paul Schultz and 7-0 center Colin Murray. This trio will provide another big test for the Irish big men, who had their hands b.Jll all afternoon on Saturday against the front-court players from UCLA. The Irish cannot afford to be dominated on the boards as they were when these two teams met last March. 
Engineer's Notes . . . Since Lehigh's nickname is the "Engineers," I turned to my roommates, Tom and Jim (a pair offine engineers themselves) for a scouting report on Lehigh. Here's what they had to say: 
Believe us, this game won't he on any of the major networks. Our sources tell us that the Engineers have been losing with alarming frequency, starting their season with an 0-3 record, and an 0-2 mark in East Coast Conference circuit play. First-year coach Tom Schneider has been forced to integrate several young players into the lineup, after losing six players from his program to graduation. 
Lehigh will try to maximize the offensive potential shown by sixth-man Mike Androlewicz, who has been averaging H.6 points a game to lead the offense. He will receive some support from fresh­man Mike Polaha, whose current average is eight points a game from his guardposition. Overall, we have calculated that if the Irish play with any kind ofintensity at all, the Engineers should provide little resistance to a huge scoring differential. 
IrishTarget Practice ... As mentioned earlier, the Irish have had their problems finding the mark on their shots. Against UCLA, Notre Dame posted a dismal 34 percent mark from the floor, and only managed to improve that number to 40 percent against St. Francis of Remsen St. Monday night. 
Two bright spots for the Irish have been the steady play of for­wards Tom Sluby andJim Dolan. Sluby has led the team in scoring in three of the first five contests, while Dolan has been consistently good in the early going, usually finding his name listed among the rebounding leaders. Ifthe rest ofthe team can become as consistent as these two, Digger Phelps' job will be a lot easier by mid-season. 
Pick of the Week ... Since we picked the women's swimming team last Wednesday, it seems only fair to give the nod to the male swimmers this week. Coach Dennis Stark's team will he in action this Saturday morning at II a.m., taking on Cleveland State in the Rockne Memorial Pool. 
The veteran Irish mentor lost quite a few fine swimmers from last year's squad, but he ha.'> a wealth of talent returning. Cleveland State is always a tough meet for the Irish, and the guys would appreciate your support Saturday morning.
