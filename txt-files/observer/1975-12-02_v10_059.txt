Students to suggestnewcalendar 
by Terry Keeney Editor-in-Chief 

Student representatives to the Academic Council will recommend tomorrow to the Council new calendar-making guidelines to allow a pre-Labor Day start and a week-long mid-semester break. 
The proposed guidelines would be effective for fall, 1976 through 1978. They would permit a start of classes next fall as early as Aug. 
31. 

The guidelines follow the calendar choice of students ac­cording to a survey of 3000 Notre Dame students taken before Thanksgiving. In the survey the students were given a choice of six alternative calendars. A plurality of 37 percent favored Choice C which features: an Aug. 31 star­ting day of classes, a week-long October break, a regular (four and a half day) Thanksgiving break and a Dec. 21 end of classes. 
Choice C would be possible under the proposed new guidelines. 
Break more important 
In the survey 92 percent of the students believed a mid-semester break is more important than a post-Labor Day start. Sixty-five percent of those polled believed the mid-semester break should last a Government academic com­missioner, noted that the calendar Choice C was the first, second or third choice of 85 percent of those surveyed. 
week,  instead  of  an  extended  
weekend.  
Mike  Gassman,  Student  

Although <lloice C would provide only 69 class days, Gassman believes it to be a feasible calen­dar. 
"According to Leo Corbaci, all the calendars in the survey are feasible," Gassman said. 
Gassman will make a two-part proposal on the calendar at tomorrow's Academic Council meeting. Part I proposes that "The first class day of the fall semester be no earlier than the Tuesday preceding Labor Day." 
The second part includes provision for the mid-semester break. "The fall semester shall include a week-long mid-semester break in addition to the four-and­ahalf day Thanksgiving break. The guidelines as amended shall be used to prepare the calendar for the next three academic years." 
Dramatic opinion change 
The results of the student survey show a dramatic reversal of student opinion on the calendar issue from a similar poll taken just ten months ago. 
The Academic Council will tomorrow consider changes in the faculty appointments and promotions process in addition to voting proposed changes in the fall academic calendar. 
The Council, meeting for the first time this semester, will also name members of two committees and debate a revision in the policy of Appointment and faculty relationship provided in the Academic Manual. 
The proposed changes in the faculty appointment process, endorsed last April by the Faculty Senate, would make the Ad­ministration more resposible to the Committees oo Appointments and Promotions CCAP> in each department. 
Prof. Paul Conway, chairman of the Faculty Senate, ooted that the proposed changes would limit the power of department chairman to decide appointments and promotions. 
"Presently the CAP committee discusses the promotion and the chairman makes the decision," Conway said. Under the proposed changes, ''The chairman's weight 
Positive aspects of alcohol emphasized atconference 
by Lonnie Luna Staff Reporter 

The Alcohol Conference, held Nov. 21 through 23, emphasized the positive aspects of alcohol and removed the stigma placed upon it by society, according to Student Body President Ed Byrne. 
Alcohol can be used or abused and it can enhance or destroy a social gathering, explained Byrne. 
"What the conference did was remove the mystique placed on alcohol and place the blame on the individual," Byrne said. 
The problem with America is there is no tradition associated with drinking as in Germany or other European countries, he explained. 
As a result, when the drinking is done, it is done surreptitiously when the individual is not of drinking age, he continued. Con­sequently, drinking in this manner is done to the point of drunkenness, he said. 
Also, it is time college students reflected on their drinking habits because it is they who influence the drinking habits of America, he stated. Many high school students follow the drinking habits of college students, he added. 
"I think this conference will definitely help lower the drinking age because it shows the legislature that the students are doing something and that we can deal with alcohol responsibly," Byrne said. 
The conference was the first nationally-sponsored conference of its kind and it was fortunate for us to co-sponsor it, he added. 
"It can help us and it can't hurt us," said Byrne. 
Diana Merten, a member of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcobolism <NIAAA) 
editorial board, felt the conference was worthwhile because it "has affected my drinking habits." 
"The confereoce was not telling people not to drink but rather giving the individual the chance to decide on the use of alcohol," Merten said. 
The conference pointed out at many parties ooly alcobol is served, explained Merten. Rather, she suggested food, such as ham sandwiches and bors d'oeuvres be served, along with the drinks "because many people enjoy eating as well as drinking," sbe continued. ~ 

The Academic Council will meet tomorrow to vote on proposed calendar changes and to consider 
changes in the process of faculty appointment and promotion.

Also, non-alcoholic drinks should

The conference emphasized that drinking at a bar should be a social gathering to meet friends, not to get drunk, she said. 
Mrs. Mary Clare McCabe, director for Student Development Programs, felt the conference was important because it "was an opportunity for the representatives of the 63 universities to exchange information on alcohol education." 
The conference encouraged the use of the national clearinghouse as a resource, she added_.:·.· , . 
McDowell lecture stresses individual basis of peace 
by Lonnie Luna Staff Reporter 

Josh McDowell emphasized world peace must begin on an individual basis during his lecture on Christianity last night in the library auditorium. 
"Every problem we have to face is an individual problem," he told the audience of approximately 200. "These problems are racism, prejudice, envy and jealousy-but I don't call them problems; they're 
diseases." 

Individual problems gather collectively and then combine as a whole into society, explained McDowelL An individual is a product of his or her environment. 
Man is egocentric 

As such a product, he or she becomes an economic organism, he added. "Why is an individual an ­economic organism? Because he is ambitious," McDoweU said. 
"And he is ambitious because he is greedy; he is greedy because he is. self-centered," he said.

McDowell attended Wheaton Co11ege and Talbot Theological Seminary. He graduated magna cum laude from Talbot. 
He  is  the  author  of  Evidence  
That Man Is  a Verdict  and More

Technology misused 

McDowell also explained people's misuse of technology. 
"Technology has advanced mankind but has also instilled fear, tension and anxiety in humanity," McDowell stated. Through technology, we know more about killing people than helping them, he added. 
McDowell cited the common denominator in technology as being the individual and his or her misuse of it. We should use our technology for the good of mankind, not to create havoc and death and destruction. 
"Was it Einstein's atom bomb or the evil power invested in the heart which could use it that terrified many?" he said. 
McDowell cited humanism as part of the problem and not the solution.

Erlichman testifies 
Nixon moved files. feared FBI 'blackmail' 
WASHINGTON (AP) -For­mer President Richard M. Nix­on personally ordered secret files on wiretaps of newsmen and government officials moved from the Justice Depart­ment to the White House for fear that FBI Director J. Ed­gar Hoover would use them for "blackmail," John D. Ehrlich­man says. 
Ehrlichman, who was a top aide to the . resigned president, said Nixon had been urged to move the files to the White House by Robert C. Mardian, the assistant attorney general in charge of the records. 
In a deposition filed Monday in connection with a suit chal­lenging the legality of the wire­taps, Ehrlichman said Mardian was afraid of the late FBI di­rector and worried that he might send his agents to break into the office and remove the files. 
He said Mardian feared he might be harmed by Hoover or his agents. 
Ehrlichman testified that Hoover "was not above black­mailing the President" and that he might use the wiretap files "to secure whatever he wanted from the President," including a guarantee that his job would be protected. 
The wiretap files were re­moved from Mardian's office in 1971. They were found in 1973 in a White House safe. 
Ehrlichman 's deposition was filed in a suit by former White House aide Morton Halperin, whose telephone was tapped for 21 months in an attempt by the White House to halt information leaks to the press. The tele­phones of 17 newsmen also were tapped. 
The government contends the taps were legal and proper use of a president's authority to protect national security. 
Ehrlichman said Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger picked Halperin as one of those to be tapped because he saw Halperin as "singularly un­trustworthy" and noted "de­fects in his philosophy." 
Asked what was meant by "defects in philosophy," Eh­rlich man answered, "He was philosophically in disagreement with Dr. Kissinger and the President on matters of pol­icy." 
Ehrlichman recalled talks with Nixon in which it was de­cided that the wiretap data could be politically embar­rassing, "and Hoover wasn't above blackmailing the Presi­dent with this information." 
LaRasa focuses on plight of Mexican-Alnericans 
by Pat Cuneo Staff Reporter 

The Midwest Council of LaRasa, a non-profit organization, recently launched a fund-raising drive to aid migrant workers, United Farm Workers <UFW( ( AND Mexican-Americans. 
The goal of the council is to advance social change and human development in America, ac­cording to Ricardo Parra, executive director of the council. 
Currently, the Midwest Council of LaRaza needs money to qualify for the "two for one" plan a matching grant of $20,000 from the National Campaign for Human Development. In order to merit the grant, the organization must first raise $20,000 on its own. 
With several other money raising activities tentatively scheduled, the council will sponsor the film "Fighting for Our Lives" on Dec. 6 at Union Hall in South Bend. The movie will be preceeded by a receptionat the hall 
from 1 to 3 pm. 
The council operates a com­munication center for Mexican Americans in the Midwest. Theycurrently sponsor a day care center as well as Proyecto Nen­ceremos English as a second language program. 
'"The main purpose of the 
council is to focus attention on the present plight of Mexican Americans," explained Parra. The council strives to achieve justice and equal opportunity for 
Mexican-Americans, he said. 
In April, the Indiana Advisory Committee to the U.S. Constitution on Civil Rights issued a report
charging migratory farmworkers in Indiana have been systematically excluded from employment education and other 
opportunities routinely guaranteed to other Americans. 
Specifically, the report stated migrant families are excluded from the equal rights protection of state and federal laws and local, state and federal agencies have not protected their rights where the laws do exist. 
Parra, also a member of the Indiana Advisory Committee, said "The migrant's contribution to the state's agricultural economy is ignored even though each summer approximately 18,000 migrants come to Indiana to plant and harvest $26 million worth of a variety of the state's crops." 
He added, "They are among the lowest paid, least educated, worst housed and most medically im­poverished groups in Indiana." 
The advisory committee ob­served migrant children do not receive an adequate education during the u ! they are in Indiana 3s "most of the children speak Spanishand their Mexican-American culture is alien to local 
education agencies." 
"Federalfundsareavailablebut many schools don't apply for the money through lack of knowledge and many of those schools that do apply for the aid end up misspending it," noted Parra. 
"In the area of welfare we discovered that Indiana food stamp officials have denied food stamps to eligible migrant farm­workers because of misin­terpretations of the law, the illegal use of residency requirements and failure to operate the program in a manner required by law," he said. Currently there are over a million Mexican-Americans in the 
Midwest. Parra hopes through financial aid and social change their goals may gradually be 
achieved.

Revenue-sharing program 
may not be 
MIAMI BEACH <AP) -The 
nation's city officials and the 
White House are increasingly 
worried that Congress may not 
renew the federal revenue-shar­
ing program which one mayor 
has called "the best thing since 
ice cream" for the cities. 
This new concern has been 
demonstrated at the National 
League of Cities' annual con­
vention that began here last 
weekend. 
James Falk, associate direc­tor of the White House Domes­tic Council and the adminis­tration's chief lobbyist at the convention, said in an inter­view, "I am not immediately optimistic and I am more con­cerned than I was five months ago about the ultimate fate of the program." 
The nearly 3,000 city officials at the convention heard the league president, Mayor Carlos Romero Barcelo of San Juan, P.R., warn: "We cannot possi­bly risk that any laxness or ir­resolution on our part may al­low the critics of this essential program to score a 'victory' by defeating general revenue shar­ing." 
And Rep. Norman Mineta, D­Calif., former mayor of San Jose, Calif., and now chairman of the freshmen Democrats in the House, told them there is a "very real possibility that with­out substantial efforts on your 

rene'Wed 
part, the general revenue-shar­ing program will not be contin­ued." 
The league's board of direc­tors sent a telegram Saturday to Rep. L. H. Fountain, D-N.C., chairman of the House inter-. 
governmental relations &ubcom­
mittee, which has held hearings. 
on a renewal of the measure, 
and urged prompt approval of 
President Ford's proposal to 
extend revenue sharing for 5% 
years at a cost of $39.8-billion. 
Fountain has said he cannot act 
on the bill before the end of 
this year. 
A group of Democratic may­ors also sent a prodding tele­gram over the weekend to Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Tex., chairman of the parent Government Op­erations Committee. Mineta said Brooks has expressed ''strongphilosophical opposition to the program." 
The current $30-billion, five­year program expires at the end of 1976. It has provided cites and states with the first federal aid they could spend any way they chose. 
Mayoi Moon Landrieu of New Orleans, president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the league's sister, told a news con­ference Monday that without renewal, "There's absolutely no way I could balance my city's budget without revenue-sharing money."

over break 
by Shawn Scannell Staff Reporter 

Both Notre Dame and St. Mary's Security reported yesterday that no burglaries occurred on the campuses over the holiday break. This clean record parallels last year's safe Thanksgiving period. 
Arthur Pears, director of Notre Dame Security, said standard security measures were stepped up for the break. 
"Extra precautions were taken to ensure locked doors to keep the dorms safe. We issued keys to students in some d\lrms to prevent entry by anyone not permitted," he added. 
Pears noted that the number of students left on campus was greater this year than last, which "means the security measures were effective in preventing burglaries in view of this number." 
In a survey of rectors to find the number of students who remained 
o.n campus for Thanksgiving, a f1gure of about 12 per cent emerged. 
A further survey to determine Nhy students who stayed did pointed out two main reasons for not leaving. 
Either their homes were too 1istant to make a trip worthwhile economically, or the student felt 
the need to lighten their work load by doing a good deal of it and ~etting it out of the way. 
Often both factors had a ietermining effect on whether to stav or leave for the few days.

~uatican HVl ': ordination of women? 
This last weekend in Detroit, an event took place that has great import for the Church in the world. This event was a conference called "Women in Future Priesthood Now: A Call for Action." F­rom the few news headlines I had a chance to see women in priesthood was em­phasized more than the future of priesthood. This was an unfortunate oversight. . 
The conference, which I attended, was much more than trying to infiltrate the ranks of priesthood with women. It was a stepping back and looking at the Church, seeing where it was going and how close it was in following the guidelines it set out for itself in Vatican II and other pronounce· ments. If there was a slogan for the Conference, it was not "Women Priests Now," as much as "SOL--Stamp Out the Laity." What its objective seemed to be was not the handling a very particular and therefore limited problem, making women priests, but a transcendent problem, helping the laity fulfill the ministries they are called to by God and echoed in Vatican 
II. "We are a priestly people." 
Sister Kathleen Hughes of the Murphy Center for Liturgy at Notre Dame said it precisely in that, in that woman priesthood was "not a goal in itself but a means to an end." That end is the physical realization of Christ's call to each of us to minister to one another, a call formerly lost but newly found by Vatican II. 
The role of priesthood in the early Church was different than it is now. There were three official modes of priesthood <the leader of the Eucharist). These cons­isted of the Hierarchy <Bishops and Apostles), prophetic priesthood, and those who were appointed as leaders of the Eucharist in the absence of the abovementioned two. 
This ministry was not open only to men, which is a little known fact today. Our priesthood today is descendant from the Apostles. There was at least one female apostle explicitly mentioned by Paul. In Romans 16:7 Andromicus and Jumialare called apostles outrightly. 
According to Paul, an apostle was one who had eye witnessed the resurrection (1 Corinthians 9: 1-4). According to Luke, the apostle to replace Judas needed to have

You may have heard this story. It has been making the rounds lately. A mountain climber was high on a mountain and he fell. Fortunately, he grabbed a bush growing out of the mountainside and hung there with his feet dangling in space, hundreds of feet above the ground. He called to his friend below for help,. but the friend couldn't get to him. 
He then called out to anyone above for help: "Is there anyone up there?" A voice from above answered, "I am here." "Who are you?" said the climber. "I am God," came the answer. The man was overjoyed and asked for help. God said, "I will help you, but fir&t you will have to do what I tell you." "Anything, anything at all," replied the climber. Then God said, "Let go of the bush! " There was a long silence from the 
climber;  then  the  man  looked  up  and  
yelled  out,  "Is  there  anyone  else  up  
there?"  

That story says a lot about something all of us face. We find faith tough. By it God seems to demand the impossible: he keeps saying, "Let go of the bush." It couldn't be faith without some experience of God, yet we don't have the experience of sight. 
Faith is a delivering over of oneself in trust and surrender to God. We can't possibly do this unless he call to us and invite us; but still we don't see him. Faith is not sight. That's why there is no faith in heaven--where we see him "face to face." 
We can resonate with the words of the knight, in Bergman's film, Winter Light: "Faith is a torment, did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call." 
This was the cry of the Israelites: "How long, 0 Lord? I cry for help but yo~ donot listen." This is also the cry of the starving people of our world, the parents of the child born severely handicapped, those who have lost a loved one, and the student crushed in heart over rejection by a friend, or overwhelmed with loneliness. And it i~ the cry of Jesus himself. 
He had had an experience of the Father, and so had surrendered and delivered himself in the most complete way. But on the cross, he not only could not see the Father; he couldn't even sense his presence. It was like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call, "My God, why have you forsaken me?" Still, he was willing to "let go of the bush"; that is, to let go of his spirit in trust: "Into your hands I commend my spirit." 
It would be a lot easier if it were just a matter of being hung up with that bush once. If we just had to let go in trust one time. But we know better. Faith demands we let go frequently; it means abandoning our own blueprint; it means living in the midst of ambiguity and doubt. 
Graham Greene's play, The Potting Shed, focuses on a family dominated by an agnostic father who has tried to stifle all doubt and ambiguity in the lives of his wife and children. The spiritual life of the family is moribund until doubt begins to intrude in the form of an alleged miracle that threatens their unquestioned agnostic certitudes. "You've spoiled all our cer_. tainties," is the way Mrs. Callifer responds to her son who has made the miraculous claim. But, as a matter of fact, she welcomes the challenge: 
It was all right to doubt the existence of God as your grandfather did in the time of Darwin. Doubt-that was human liberty. But my generation didn't doubt, we knew. I don't believe in this miracle-but I'm not sure any longer. We are none of us sure. 
accompanied Jesus in his Galilean minis­try and eyewitnessed his resurrection <Acts 1:21). 
The first ones to fulfill Luke's requirements <so possibly the first apostles) were the women who came to dress Jesus' body on Easter Sunday. 
Tradition is how the Church un­derstands itself and Christ, it is God's revelation over the course of time. In the Conference Sister Ann Carr explained this tradition. 
Aft.er Paul's death, people realized the end of the world had been postponed and probably would not come within their lifetime. The tri-partite priesthood was then reduced to two parts, overseer <Bishop) and presbyter (priest). In the sixth century celibacy was introduced and spread by the religious orders. In the eighth century Latin become the official language of the Church and the Breviary was introduced. Priesthood had grown from the possession of Charisms, powers given by the Spirit to individuals for the good of all, to only the offering of sacrifice and the forgiving of sins. The role of priest had changed from preaching, healing and ritual to only one of rituaL The Council of Trent officially instituted the trans­formation along with a visible priesthood, a priesthood that was indelible on the individual, that was centered on cultic aspects and was formal in character. 
Vatican II returned to the New Testament philosophy of priesthood, Priesthood was to be reunited with preaching and healing. ·Diversity was reborn in ministry with the reinstitution of deacons. In the year 500 the act of Con­secration at Mass was taken from the Bishops and shared with the J)riests. Changing tradition is a tradition in the Church; it should not be renounced now. 
From the above it should be seen that the issue is much more than women priests but a revitalization of the ministry of the Church, a return to Christ and His call to liberation. As Paul expressed it, we are no longer limited, no longer "slave nor free man, Gentile or Jew, male or female." If we are to limit priestly ministry to those who match the twelve apostles' physical characteristics, not only men but only Hebrew men should be priests. 
What the movement toward woman's ordination is trying to accomplish is tearing down the division that separates the oppressed and favored within the Church. 
It is not only for women to be involved in 


importance of doubt 
But when you aren't sure, at least you are living. 
How right she is! And for that reason, 
we know we are living: we exist in the real 
world, where we are most unsure. It's 
hard to imagine a time when women and 
men were faced with such uncertainty and 
doubt about their futures. Compounding 
the sense of insecurity is the realization 
that there is no extreme to which faith and 
the gospel may not take us. 
The personal renunciation implied may 
go far beyond the renunciation of family 
about which Jesus spoke when he said, 
"He who prefers family to me is unworthy 
of me." To have a new life of faith 
necessitates death to the old. The moment 
we say "Yes" we begin to die. It's the 
paradox of losing life to gain it. 
Think what it must have cost the twelve apostles, to leave their. security and follow the penniless Jesus. The same pattern is traced out by the politician who loses his life <elected office) because he says what the gospel teaches about racial justice. Or faculty, students and administrators in colleges who find it necessary to die to old customs and values for the sake of . newly­discovered demands of justice and peace. 
When we confront the pains of a life of doubt and the unknown, we may naively turn to religion for escape. But then we discover (if we're lucky) that the gospel is not a pill to help us avoid the pain of life, but a revelation that shows the way to transform suffering into the birth pangs of something new. Adversity introduces a man to himself; and if what he meets is a person of authentic faith, somehow he is led to grow through the experience. 
. If we possessed certainty, there would be no need for faith. Faith is a wild risk; and sad are those who try to destroy it, and

priesthood, but also in the decision maKmg of the church, and the Magisterium. At present decisions are made for the whole Church by representatives of only one-half of the Church. Women should be represented on all decision bodies of the Church. This can only be seen as wrong if one believes that men and women have the same perspective on affairs that affect them, that women are the same as men <there is a difference between sameness and equality). Women should be able to bring their variety and insight into decisions, included because of their dif­ferences, not excluded because of them. Even the aforementioned study by the Bishops on Ordination recognized this "Women are called today to a greater leadership role in the Church~ their con­tributions are needed in the decision making process at the parochial, diocesan, 
national and universal level." The Roman Synod of Bishops said, " ... we also urge that women should have their own share of responsibility and participation in the community life of the Church" (Justice in the World, Part Ill). 
However, these words by our Natonal and Universal Church, when com­plemented by recent actions of the Church, seem ambivalent rather than full of conviction. With the creation of new lay offices of Lector, the directive from Rome was that these offices could only be filled by males. A position that had no tradition, since it had no prior history, was confined to only men. However, the U.S. Bishops were quick to modify the restriction to official installations only and the com­promise allowed women lectors. As Sr. Elizabeth Carroll stated at the Conference, "Is not skepticism warranted unless and until actions indicate seriousness about the structuring of women's participation in decision making bodies? Every Congregation in the Roman Curia is totally 
male.  Even  the  latest  norms  for  ec­ 
clesiastical  trials  of  marriage  cases  
formally  exclude  women  as  judges.  

Bishops Boards of Consultors remain male.. .if the women's movement is as Pope Paul declared <in hjs address on the International Women's Year), "A call of the Spirit," why have so few Bishops (and) so few theologians ... conceived it as a matter of conscience to address it seriously?" 
The other group that is oppressed within the Church is the laity. We are not op­pressed with the traditional clericism, but 
with a new form of clericism. Before Vatican II, the fact that every person did not seek out their ministry and live it could be considered as the ignorance of the in­dividual and the Church as a whole. But after the Council, when it realized and called the laity to fulfill its ministry, its role of priestly people, there arises responsibility. It is a joint responsibility, in one way, for the laities to search out their ministry. The other respon­sibility, and possibly a more serious one as it implies a selfishness for the power they hold, the failure of the Bishops and priests to fulfill their ministry of Magister, their teaching authority specifically given to them. 
This is a movement which will change the face of the Church. 'The Council changed the theoretical face, this movement will change the physical face. It strives to line up the Church's image with the Council's call and God's call. Father Richard McBrien, former President of the Catholic Theological Society stated that our unchanging· tradition of not ordaining women would be the most important consideration, if the world would end tomorrow. But if we see the Church in the light of eternity, today's Church may very well be seen as the infant Church in 20,000 years. 
The malady of creeping infallibility in to the ordinary Magisterium of the Church, where it does not belong, would be harm­ful. This Magisterium at one time con­demned democracy. Magisterium is not immutable. During the Council the Canon of the Mass was considered unchangeable. Then Pope John added St. Joseph to the Canon. Following Pope John's example., 
we  must  se~  what  is  unchangeable  
teaching  of  Christ  and  changeable,  
culturally  affected and tradition.  This  

tradition is Spirit guided, but to be guided something has to be going~ somewhere. 
Letters were sent to all 81 Bishops of the U.S., seeking to keep the dialogue open as called for by them. Of these 81 only 18 responded. At the beginning of the con­ference of the 81 invited none had come though five dioceses did send representatives). By the end of the Conference two auxilliaries from Detroit and one Bishop from Memphis were in attendance. 
eliminate its necessity, through their sick quest for signs and miracles, visions and apparitions. 
Faith needs doubt in order to develop. How can you be abeliever,without doubt? If you never doubted, If you never doubted, you wouldn't need faith, which is a hanging on in the midst of the insecurities and uncertainties of life. We know how often we resist walking with God into the unknown; we know how frequently he says, "Let go of the bush." And everytime we do relinquish control, we deepen· our commitment to him. He may ask that we let go in many ways-let ~o of our plans, directions, designs for the convenience and comfort of the "good life." He may ask that we let go of our favorite idols--our false notions of the meaning of gospel and what faith is all about. He may demand we let go of our bigotry and prejudice, our acts of pettiness and shallowness. 
The faith experience, that constant call to let go, will involve our willingness to leave the known and the familiar, for what is sometimes threatening and insecure. The doubts that will come along will cost us, but the transformation is worth the pain. Reflecting on the growth occasioned by doubt in his own life, Dostoevsky once exclaimed: "My hosannas were forged in the crucible of doubt." 
The only Christian answer to all our questions and doubts about this crazy world is that our God has fully celebrated and suffered all life has to offer in Jesus Christ. And through is victory, he calls out to us with hope. That, by the way, is the Advent message. Of all people, we are called to be rid of any misconceptions about this most fundamental fact: Faith plunges us into the unknown, yes; but that is the way to lull life.

Chinese warn Ford against Soviet detente 
PEKING <AP) -President Ford begins talks Tuesday with Chinese leaders who, at the start of his visit, warned him about what they see as the dan­gers of detente with the Soviet Union. 
The warning note was sounded by Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping in a toast at a lavish banquet at which Ford was honored just four hours after his arrival. 
·Teng, without mentioning the Soviet Union directly, referred to it as "the country which most zealously preaches peace · but is the most dangerous source of war." 
The vice premier, who is act­ing as premier during the ill­ness of Chou En-lai, added,

Helen W. Gandy told a House subcommittee that she and an­other secretary went through all the files in Hoover's inner offices, destroying every one that was marked "personal." 
"There were 30 or 32 file drawers. I did not keep a\ record of how many," she testi­fied. "I tore them up and put them in cartons. They were then taken to the Washington FBI field office to be either in­cinerated or shredded." 

Miss Gandy denied that the files she personally destroyed contained any official FBI busi­ness or information on the per­sonal lives of public officials. 
However, in contrasting com­ments, former FBI Asst. Direc­tor William C. Sullivan said Hoover's personal files were 

; filled with political and person­al information on public fig­ures. 
Miss Gandy also said that she did not consider her actions to have violated an order by then acting-Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst that Hoover's of­fices be sealed. Kleindienst tes­tified to the subcommittee on government information that upon learning of Hoover's death 

'\ on May 2, 1972, he ordered that Hoover's suite of offices "be locked and sealed."
