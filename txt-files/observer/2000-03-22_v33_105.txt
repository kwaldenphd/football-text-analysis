Profs: Papal visit a call for religious peace 
By ERIN PIROUTEK Associate News Editor 

For years, Pope John Paul II has prayed for the opportunity to walk in lhe footsteps of Jesus. Fragile health and political obstacles failed to keep the pope from realizing his dream of visiting tlw Holy Land and the most sacred sites of Christianity. flp arrived in Jordan \1onday and will remain in the Middle East until Sunday. 
"'Jr,rusalcm is thr holiest of cities for Chrislians because it is where Jesus suf­for!'d his passion and death and where he rose from the dead. In other words. it is the place whern the Hedemption or.currnd." said Father Richard McBrien, a theology professor at Notre Dame. 
The week-long pilgrimage includes visits to the Church of the Sepulchre ­the supposed site of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection -as well as the site of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem and his boy­hood home of Nazareth. The pope is also expected to say Mass at site of the Sermon on the Mount, with 100,000 worshipers anticipated. 
The long-awaited visit was timed to coincide with the jubilee year. 
"It is a Holy Year -and not just any Holy Year. It is the beginning of a new century and a new millennium." McBrien said. 
Jerusalem has a unique role in three religions: Christianity, Judaism and Islam. 
"John Paul's vision is of a Jerusalem that serves as the meeting place of heaven and earth, as a place where all humanity can come together." said Rabbi Michael Signer, theology profes­sor at Notre Dame. 
This is the first time a pope has visited Israel since 1964, when Pope Paul VI made a pilgrimage. This visit, however, came at a time when the Vatican had no diplomatic relations with Israel. Paul Vi's focus was to unify Christians in the Eastern and Western churches, not to improve relations with other religions. 
This year. the pontiff will also visit holy Jewish sites -the Western Wall ­

Roseland supports officers 
. Town attorney says police officers will not be disciplined in Denny's case 
By TIM LOGAN News Writer 
Asserting that race was not a fac­tor in the arrest of four black Notre Dame students at Denny's Diner on Sunday, Feb. 27, Roseland town attorney Peter Agostino firmly sup­ported the two officers who made the arrests at the Roseland Town Council meeting Monday. 
He said he had been investigating the incident for the past two weeks and recommended that no discipli­nary action be taken against the officers, Joseph Andrews and Eugene Woofter. who were off-duty and working security at the restau­rant. He said that his investigation was not complete, but that he had interviewed seven eyewitnesses who said the officers acted properly. 
"Of the thirteen witnesses who have come forward all 13 have been supportive of the police officers," Agostino said. "None of the witness­es have indicated that any of the officers acted in any unprofessional manner or used any racist remarks or otherwise did anything that could in any way be misconstrued as racist." 
The four arrested students did not attend the meeting, although they had been invited. Agostino also said he was still attempting to contact five students who were at the diner but not arrested. He was also trying to reach Lt. Robert Herron, a police officer at South Bend Regional Airport who was eating at Denny's at the time and assisted in the arrest.

Malloy: ND will not join Workers' Rights Consortium yet 
By KATE STEER Associate News Editor 
/\t a crucial time in the anti­swea tshop movement, University leaders and activists met Tuesday before a group of interested people to discuss lhe role that Notre Dame has taken and will conlimw to take in the near future. 
University president Father Edward Malloy opened the dis­cussion by expressing his satis­faction with the involvement of University members. 
"I am pleased, when I look at 

all the great issues of our time that we have people here who are paying attention to econom­ic justice," 

he said. 
Ma 11 o y recently established t h e University's task force on anti­sweatshop 
Malloy initiatives, and praised their work as well. Tfhe task forcet has been working very hard, periodically 
issuing reports, and I think I thus has been able to adapt the can say with some degree of organization to the University 
pride that we have played a very important leadership role in the conver­sation about this issue," he said.

standards to some extent. 
"We felt that our par­ticipation [in the FLA] would mean that much greater moni­toring [of sweatshops] would go on," said Carol Kacsebier, vice president 
counsel of the University. Kacsebier also serves as the co-chair of the university advisory committee of the FLA. 
Malloy also supported the University's actions in partic­ipating in the FLA and contin­ued efforts as a part of the organization. 
"One of the most significant ways we have been involved up to now is our participation and leadership role in the FLA," Kaesebier said.

The Friend 

Basket 

There was once something that my best friend back in California and I had in com­mon. We both knew a good number of girls, hut we never got anywhere with them. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can be a little frustrating at 
C.R. "Teo"

times when you know some of the hottest girls Teodoro 
around (and beliiwe me. I 
know some very attractive 
Illustrations

ladies) and all you end up 
Editor

in is the friend basket. 
The friend basket is actuallv a term that was given to my friend when he was asking out this one girl at his work. Now. this was a very attractive lady as well; she had four separate oITers to star on a Spanish soap opera (and the women from I.his kind of show were known to be incredibly sexy). Now when my friend. nanny by name, tried to ask her out, she immediately said to stop and told him straight off that there was no chance for him. Why? l3ecanse he was in the friend basket. 
Women usually have some rough way of classifying men they know and meet: the "date" basket, and "hate" basket, and the "friend" basket. In my friend's case. this lady had most guys in her date or hate basket, but no one reallv in her friend basket. She usual­ly had men moving from her date baskPt to her hate basket until Danny showed up. 
Nm.v if you know my friend Danny, you know he is a very likeable guy. He was so likeable that he ended up in the friend basket with this girl. She admits that she doesn't know how he got in there, and that no one ever gets into her friend basket, but by some flux in reality has Danny found himself in the friend basket and that was it. Well. she prob­ably wasn't his type anyway. 
As for me, I usually... eh. I mean always find myself in the friend basket. As I said before. this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It is a curse and a blessing for us both. You get advice and opinions for women that you can't get from guys. You get to hear some stories that usually circulates only among the female (and unfortunately some of these stories are things I really did not need to know, thank you very much!). You also get more chances to explore and embrace your feminine side that you really don't get when you are hang­ing out with the guys. 
Still, I wonder how long I'm going to be in the friend basket. I wouldn't mind going into the date basket every now and then, even if I do turn up in the hate basket afterwards. Of course. maybe it's that mentality that pre­vents me from getting into the date basket in the first place. Maybe women see me as non­threatening. t\1aybe they think of me as inca­pable of being a sex object (scary thought as that may be). Maybe they think I'm gay, which I'm not (at least, I don't think). Hell, I might as well be gay since my love life has been non-existent. 
Just recently, I got word from my friend Danny about the happenings back home. Other than the usual, I heard that he finally met a girl. We had an ongoing joke about the both of us being in the friend basket. But it seems that I will be the only one to carry on this joke a little further. Oh well, it was get­ting to be a bit too crowded in the friend bas­ket anyway.

It is not every day that Notre Dame students have to argue that the world would be better o!T with­out the discovery uf" A1rn~rica. 
But Notrn Dame dehatP tfrnrn members Mark Styczynski, .Joyce Bohnke and Willis McDonald, all sophomores. had to argue just that in a debate Tuesday night. 
The three students argued against thrne Irish debaters, Michael Deasy, Louise Rouse and Honan Mullen, who won the Irish Times Final Debate, a competition that began in October with 400 stu­denL"i. 
"In lrdand, it's a very prestigious thing to win," said Chris lluck, coach of the Notre Dame debate team. 
Many important leaders in the Irish governrnfmt arc previous win­ners of the compPtition. Huck said. All three current champions are pursuing Jaw degrees in Ireland. 
The team came to the United States about two weeks ago for an American debate tournamenl. They are currently visiting colleges and universities across the U.S. Notre Dame bid to be one of the host sr,hools and was accepted. 
"It's a great honor to have them here," Huck said. 
The statement the teams had to debate was: "This house regrets the discovery of America." The Irish debate team chose to oppose the proposal before Huck had actually read the topic. 
The teams had 15 minutes to plan its argument, before each team member presented his or her argument. 
"It was a little bit odd for me to be debating anti-American," Styczynski said. 
One issue the Notre Dame debaters focused their argument on was their claim that American for­eign policy is based only in American self-interest. 
"Our [foreign policy) motives have always been shady," McDonald said. "We always act in our inter­ests." 
The team also argued that the American culture is pervading other cultures. 
"Yon can go into China now and find a McDonald's on Ticnanwn Square," Hohnko said. "You cannot live your hornii C'ulture Iin a foroign country] ... You can't help but lw inundated ""ith American culturp." 
"We destroy other rnlturP.s," Styczynski said. 
/\nother isstw tlrn Notre Danw debaters argued was the fact that poor Americans are not benefiting fully from Amnrican prospnrity. 
Buth 13nhnke and McD011ald argued that a poor person would bP better off living in Cuba than in the United States because. Bohnkc! said, all Cubans have guarantnPd h<alth care. 
The Irish debaters opposed the proposition with argument<; such as the bcnP!its of American foreign policy, the possibility for cultures to be preserved within Anwrica's cul­ture and with th,~ possibility for all people to prosper in Amnrica. 
"People want to come here. People want to live hnrp," Deasy said. 
"We're not calling for the com­plete American colonization of the world," Rouse said. "i\m<irica isn't perfect but it is one of the best sys­tems available." 
Rouse pointed out that the U.S. helpfully intervened in Kosovo, even though it lacked self-interest in the region. 
In addition. during difficult eco­nomic times in Ireland. many of' the country's people waited for the "American letter" containing money from relatives who had immigrated to America, according to Mullen. He added that America gave immi­grants the chance to support their both relatives in America and those who remained in Europe. 
"All there would have been is death at home [without relatives in /\merica]," Mullen said. 
Unlike most debates, which are typically decided by judges, Huck let the entire audience vote to dnter­mine the winners. Most of the audi­ence, as well as the three Notre Dame debaters. voted in favor of the Irish team.

a remnant of the Jewish temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 
A.D. -and Yad Vashern. a Jerusalem Ilolocaust memorial. 
For nearly 2.000 years, rela­tions bt>tween .Jews and Christians have been strained. A major source of this tension was a formnr Church teaching regarding the Jews as killers of Christ. 
"Historically many of the evangelists created a negative image of Judaism in ordPr to demonstrate the lruth of Christ's leaching," Signer said. 
In this cPntury, the Church has taken steps to improve it.s rnlationship with Jews. 
"Pope John XXIII, as part of his desire to see the Church rPnew itsP!f, looked at the his­tory of the Church and the Jewish people and saw a tragedy." Signei· said. 
Pope John's r,onct~rn led to Nostra Aetate, or "In Our Age," a 196S papal document that denounced anti-Semitism and promoted dialogue between Christians and Jews. 
"John Paul II picked up the ltgacy of John XXJII." Signer said. Growing up in Poland, lhe pope lost Jewish friends during the !Inlocaust. He has written more extensively about rela­tions between the Jewish and Catholic people than any other pope. In 1979 the pope visited the memorial at Auschwitz and 
in 1986 he visited the Great Synagogue in Rome. But some Jewish leaders question if this is enough. 
Tho 1998 "We Remember" Vatican document on the Holocaust drew criticism for not emphasizing the wrongdo­ing of Church leaders. The pope's March 12 public apology for the sins of the Church did not mPntion tlrn llolocaust specifically. 
John Paul II supports a bal­anC'.ed approach, reC',ognizing both Jewish rights to security in their homuland and th(' Palestinian people's legitimate claims, explained Signer. 

"The pope is perceived by many in tlrn Middle East as a friend of the Arab world, and of the Palestinians in partir.ular," McBricn said.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
BOG subsidizes van lending progra01

Saint Mary's Editor 
The 1999-2000 Board of Governance held thnir last official meeting on Tuesday, and haHdled a varinty ol' small issues. 
At next week's meeting, both this year's and next year's boards will be in attendance lo turn over duties and privileges. 
Th<' Board votod on co­sponsoring Sister Linda Kors in Urn Spes Unica Hesource Center (SlJRV) office by donating $500 to subsidize the cost of' l1rnding campus vehicles for service projects. The Board approved the funds with two abstrntions. 
"Saint Mary's has a great tradition of' students volun­teering in the community and doing hands-on work," said Molly Kahn, missions commissioner. "Unfortunately, not every student has a car." 
Hose Lutzka, president of Residenco llall Association said the position for National Communication Coordinator will be open for next year. The current coordinator will be going to Ireland and will need a replacement. The coordinator handles all con­ferences tho Association attends and communicates 
wilh other schools nation­wide. 
The nursing departnrnnt will be hosting a health fair on March 30 from 2-7 p.111., said Student Activities coor­dinator Angie Little. The fair will include nutrition infor­mation and massage tlrnra­py, along with information ahout other health related issues. 
"There are going to he some amazing things there," Little said. "The fair should be µar,ked." 
Senior class president Anne Pangilinan explained that tho senior class is deciding on how lrnst to remember Kristi Morris at graduation. Morris died in a car accident on March 12. Class mmnbcrs will be con­sulted. along with the Morris family, she said. She also announced that plans for senior week arc well undnr­way.

"And it's not easy for anyone to look at the errors and sins of their trndition. So more discus­sion, I think, is the next neces­sary step." 
The most powerful aspect of' the pope's visit, said Signer, would be the visual gesture of John Paul II visiting Jewish sacred sites. 
But more than relations between Christianity and Judaism are under scrutiny. 
To further complicate mat­ters, Israel is the site of conflict between Israelis and the Palestinians, who have endured 50 years of Israeli occupation.

"!1. will be a spiritual journey for him -one filled with great meaning, givnn his age and state of health," Mcl3rien said. "I do not expect any major breakthroughs of a religious or political kind." 
The extensivP attPntion the trip is receiving creates an impression that the visit will erase centuries of conflict. Nonetheless. the pope cannot. work miracles. 
"This man is a religious pil­grim whose desire is for peace," Signer said. "But it's really up to all the parties involved to make the peace."

Judge refuses to block Elian from Cuba 
 Court denies U.S. relatives' appeal for an asylum hearing 
Associated Press 
MIAMI 

A f'<'dnral judge Tuesday refused to block the U.S. government from sending 6-ynar-old Elian Conza]Pz back to his f'ather in Cuba, saying the court has no right to sewnd­guess the attorney general on mat­ters of asylum. 
TwP!vr davs after hearing argu­ments in the case. U.S. Distrir,t Judge K. Michael Moore dismissed thn lawsuit filed by Elian's grPat­unc:le in Miami. The judge said that "e.Lrh passing day is another day lost between Juan Gonz,dez and his son." 
Elian's Miami relatives said they will app('al, whiln in Washington, Attornev General .Janet Reno said she will consult with other Justice Department officials on how to reunite Elian with his father in a prompt and orderly way. But she did not set any deadline. 
.I ustir.e Deparlnrnnt officials have made clear that thew want to avoid any steps that would traumatize the boy or provoke a c,onfrontation with Miami's large Cuban exile communi· ty. 
"It has been four months since Elian has been separated from his father and lost his mother," Reno said in a statement. "It is time for this little boy, who has been through so muc,h, to move on with his life at his father's side." 
Elian's fate has been debated since he was found dinging to an inner tube off Florida on Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other Cubans drowned when their boat capsized during an attempt to reach the United States. 
Since then. he has been living with relatives in Miami's Little Havana section and has been the subject of heated protests there and in Cuba. 
In early January. the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in a dedsion approved by Reno, ordered Elian returned to his father. The

NEW YORK 
The beleaguered tobac,co industry's remarkable sur­vival skills were on display as the Supreme Court ruled that the f Pderal government had no authority to regulate cigarettes as an addictive drug. 
tobacco industry is facing growing legal pressures in suits by smokers and the federal government. 
A jury in Miami is hearing evidence on what damages to assess after finding against the industry in a class-action suit on behalf of Florida smokers. A jury in San Francisco on Monday found the nation's 

regulation. such as enforce­ment of laws to curb smok­ing by minors, fedi:ral over­sight of cigarette manufac­turing and ingredients. 
Their victory on the FDA issue came even as the a case brought by a former smoker dying of' lung: can­cer.

"It clearly shows the intor­ference with Urn initial arrest and I think supports the dif­ference of opinion that we have with the prosecutor on that point." Agostino said. 
Freshmen April Allen and Tiffany Johnson, both of whom spoke at a press con­feren.. e on Wednesday, March 8, declined to comment on Agostino's findings. Barnes and junior rrancesca Milles­Dave could not be reached. 
There is still no clear pic­ture of what happened outside the restaurant. when the three students were arrested. although one eyewitness who spoke at the meeting said two of the students attacked an officer. He saw the incident both inside the restaurant, and in the parking lot and 
said they were attacking the officers. 
"They were all very rowdy," said the man, who declined to give his name. "IL just got very out of hand when they all got outside." 
Although the four did not attend and there were no rep­resentatives of the University present, the students did have some supportrirs. 
Thomas Bush, of the South 13end Chapter of the National Association for the: Advancement of Colored People, questioned both the validity of the arrest reports and the decision of Roseland to hire Andrews in the first place.

Bush and some others at the meeting agreed, pointing to problems with racial profiling nationwide, but Town Council members and their supporters said that the skin color of the students and the officers was not an issue. 
"I firmly believe that race did not play a part." Agostino said.

"85 percent of the time the person will deny the facts or b{i very angry," she said. If a friend refuses to get help she recom­mends being friendly and open to the possibility that the person may want help in the future.

Four other states Tennessee, Kansas, Delaware and Alaska -grant adoptees access to birth records, said MadPlyn Freundlich, executive director of the Adoption Institute, a New York-based adoption research organiza­tion. 
While the group doesn't advocate for or against records laws, she said, surveys indicate that adoptive and birth parents support the idea of opening records. 
"Those who not want contact have been found to represent a very small minority," she said. 
Adoptees who support the law say they should be given the same opportunity as every­one else to know who their parents are. They say that find­ing their birth parents could help detect potential health problems and give them a sense of identity. 
But opponents say birth mothers received promises from doctors, nurses, lawyers and adoption agencies that their identities would never be revealed and that most have no desire to be contacted by chil­dren they gave up years ago.

Clinton pushes for peace in India 
Associated Press 

NEW DEi.Hi, India 
President Clinton won India's pledge Tuesday to pursue peac!'ful means of resolving ten­si.ons with Pakistan in the face of new bloodshed in Kashmir. ''.Thero is nu threat of war," said Prime Minister /\tal Hihari Vajpayee. 
B u t I n d i a rej11cled

Clinton's call to slow its nuclnar weapons pro­gram. 
The president was pressing bis case for stronger U.S. ties with India in an address before members of both houses of Parliament, his last appointment in the capital beforn heading into farther rnaches ol' this vast land. 
"We have noglectnd this rnla­lionship for more than two decades." Clinton said after talks with Vajpayee. "It is too importanl to ever fall into disre­pair again." India aligned itself' with the Soviet Union during the Cold War while the United States tilted toward Pakistan. 
The president joined Vajpayee in denouncing the massacre of dozens of Sikhs in Kashmir and promised to press the point to Pakistani leaders -IL'> he has to India -that violence is not the solution to their dispute over the Himalayan territorv. 
Although India ·is one of the poorest countries in the world. Clinton was not exposed to the gritty side of New Dnlhi. Looking out f'rom his armored limousine, he saw instead a city of tree­lined boulevards and lush gar­dens and fountains, gated man­sions and colonial palaces. He also stopped to pay respects and drop rose petals at a marble memorial to Mohandas Gandhi, the revered pacifist and freedom leader. 

Leaving New Delhi. Clinton begins thnm days of sighl<;miing. lie will tour the Taj Mahal, go tiger watching in a game pre­serve and perhaps ride an ele­phant at a historic palace. 
Vajpayce called the killing ol' 40 villagnrs in Kashmir an act of "pthnic cl!~ansing" and said, "We have the means and the will to eliminate this nrnnacfl." India blamed the massacre on Pakistani-backed separatist organizations: those groups d1mied involvement. 
Clinton said he would urge military-rulfid Pakistan in his visit there Saturday to respect the line of control that separates tlm portions of Kashmir held by India and Pakistan, to show restraint anri to "stand against 
think that's right." He made his comments in an interview with ABC News. 
Despitci tensions, Vajpayec declared; "There is no threat of war. India is committed to peaceful means. We are pre­pared to solve all our problems, discuss all problems on the table. We do not think in terms of war and nobody should think in those terms in this subconti­11cnl." 
Refusing to cndorso thn Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Trnaty, Vajpayee, wary of thrflats from Pakistan and that country's own nuclear capabili­ty, said Im explained to Clinton "the reasons that compel us to maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent."

McCain returns to Senate after GOP race 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

John McCain, who joked with campaign audiences that he'd never win a Miss Congeniality award in the Senate, returned to the 
Capitol today say­ing he expected "a warm wel­come." 
A smiling McCain was swarmed 


b y McCain reporters as he approached his Senate office. The Arizona senator said he planned to catch up on paperwork and would meet later today with former Sen. Warren Rudman, the national co-chairman of his presidential campaign. 
"I'm looking forward to hav­ing lunch with all my friends tomorrow," McCain said. referring to the GOP luncheon held Tuesdavs when the Senate is in session. ''I'm told I will be extended a warm wel­come." 
Indeed, public displays of graciousness are sure to mark his return as a more formida­ble political force than when he left. It's the Senate's way, even though he ran a presi­dential campaign that rocked the Republican establishment and used fellow lawmakers as foils. 
McCain suspfmded his GOP campaign on March 9 and left for a vacation. Some support­ers want him to launch an independent campaign for the White House, though McCain has been cool to the idea. 
During his campaign, 
McCain pilloried "establish­
ment" Republicans and 
Democrats. saying they are 
out of touch with America and 
beholden to special interests. 
"Senators are in conflict every day with each other, in committee, ovflr issues, in let­ters, in the media, on the noor," said Paul Coverdell, H· Ga., Senate point man for like­ly GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush. "But it has a fraternal nature to it and you have to set the battles ... aside." 
Beyond the displays of sena­torial courtesy, the Arizona senator's allies say fellow Republicans will ignore his new political clout at their own peril. 
"There are only two United States senators who have a truly national constituency. One's name is Ted Kennedy and one's name is .John McCain," says former White House chief of staff Ken Duberstein, a McCain friend and senior adviser. 
Republican pollster Ed Goeas said a recent national survey pointed in the same direction. and that McCain can help GOP candidates in terms of fund raising and voter support.

Six people have also been arrested in tlrn Unitfld States for allegedly buying drugs from a Thai Internet pharma­cy. slrn said. 
"Many of these Internet pharmacies are fly-by-night operations set up overseas to avoid U.S. law," U.S. Customs Service Commissioner Haymond Kelly said in Washington. "They have little regard for patient safety. They'rn only interested in making a fast buck, then mov­ing on to the next victim." 
At one of the targets, Bangkok-based Vitalitv Health Products, 80 percent of onlin<) sales went to U.S. buyers, said Kevin Dfllli-Colli. director or Customs cybcrsmuggling cen­ter in Fairfax, Va. 
"We're seeing Valium, fen­phen [the diet drug], Viagra and a lot of anabolic steroids," Delli-Colli said. In some cases, the quantities involved "sug­gest people are buying them for distribution." 
Prescription drugs are readi­ly available over the counter in Thai pharmacies, despite growing government efforts to regulate pharmaceutical sales. 
The 22 suspects, arrested from November through January after almost six months of investigation, face up to five years in jail for vio­lating Thai export regulations, a Thai customs investigator said on condition of anonymi­ty. 
U.S. authorities are addition­ally preparing indictments, as the suspects are also liable for prosecution under U.S. law, the embassy spokeswoman said. 
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said his government, which is hosting a meeting this week of 20 Asia-Pacific nations on fighting cross-bor­der crime, pledged full support for further cooperation on ille­gal Internet sales.

Queilio,I:! regarding Obscroapolicit's shouldhe direttrd to Fditar m Chi(( Afike Ca,mol(~. 
Before I open up the l1oor lo shame­less name calling and finger wagging, let me be sure I've got this straight. 
More than thrne weeks ago four black Notre Dame students were arrested by two white securitv guards at the lociil Denny's after much Jason McFarley hullabaloo both inside and outside of the restaurant. 
The Bottom 
The charges against 
line

them were dropped, but short­ly thereafter the students under­standably cried race. And now some knuckleheads ... um, Roseland Town Council members ... want to see the charges reinstated? 
Did I miss something'? 

Not likely. After all, Denny's did find that the two arresting officers crossed the line in bringing the students into custody. According to restaurant man­agers. the "jai!house four" as well as their five friends (all of whom are blark) should have never been approached, let alone handcuffed and manhandled. 
Notre Dame administrators rallied behind the students. Father Mark Poorman, University Vice President for Student Affairs. calied the situation "a serious injustice." Poorman told The Observer earlier this month, "We all know this is more than an isolated inci­dent. It is symptomatic of a problem that pervades our society and our com­munity." Apparently he can smell a rat -or two. 
So can local authorities. St. Joseph County Prosecutor Chris Toth concluded that the Terrible Two were well out of order. After reviewing arrest reports and surveillance tape of the incident. Toth said the arrests were "clearly unjustified." 
To their credit, Denny's was quick in giving the officers the boot. And now area newspapers and broad­casters arf' reporting that it wasn't the 

first time that at least one of tlw officers fell far short of his duties to protect and serve. One man was a former Scmth Bend police officer who had been let go due to "unsatisfactory job perfor­mance." 
So what is the town council trying to pull'? Why the big stink over a pair of seemingly rotten apples? No, really, I'm bafffod. Is the council naive or just a bunch or meanies? 
Sure. they could be a group of mod­ern-day idealists, magnificently contfmt Lo see that everything's coming up roses in this happy world. Hey, ignorance is bliss, right? 
So maybe they're busy believing in the colorblind society where nine young blacks can walk into a public place and be perceived merely as a band of friends -not as a gang. Or where the same nine can stroll into a restaurant looking for a meal -not trouble. 
Of cours<~ in such a racially equal world when white officers scuflle with black patrons over knocking down small waiting area signs, it's completely warranted. 
But it's almost as ridiculous for me to consider the town council naive as it is l'or them to pursue the chargBs against thB students. Let's face it, we all know better. That's why what's happening alarms me. Roseland's elected govern­ing body wants to support two men con­demned bv no less than nine students and countiess university oflicials, com­munity membors, the county prosecutor and even their own employer. 
One question comes to mind: Why? 
Help me understand. What are they lighting for? For the positions of two men who conceivably aren't lit lo police or secure anyone or anything? For Denny's and the sake of eating estab­lishments everywhere? For the dignity of the five or six-mile stretch of Iloosier highway they call Roseland? 
Perhaps. though, it's a matter of what they're fighting against. That's certainly more easily answered. 
Let's ser:, given thdr stance on this situation, they must be utterly opposed io civil rights. That. then, means no venturing into any Roseland restaurant. J\t least not to sit down and eat. That is, ir it's a Saturday night. J\nd you're the wrong color. 
By the way. no arguing with Roseland's finest either. Police brutali­ty, what's that? Who cares on what grounds you're being arrested; shut up and go with the flow. 
Man, they sure are setting us back a good 40 or 50 years. And just when I thought the days of being tossed from the lunch counter wore ovor. Leave it to Roseland to give blacks not only a hard time but also a blast from the past. 
Now if I soem angry and sarcastic, it's because I don't want to be sad. Sad that college students had to resort to biting, scratching and spitting to avoid being steamrolled by some dirty cops' brand ofjustice. Sad that they am so much worse for the wear and that this ordeal will, ifit hasn't already. leave them more harsh, cvnical observers of and participants in life. 
[t's morn than a little distressing to think that they face the endless dil1\m­ma of being expected to respect the law while linding that the law in many instances dons not work for them. 
Want to bring tears to my eyes? Find me some intelligent prominent citiZPns willing to go out of their way to shatter the normalcy of a group of young adults' lives. Shouldn't be too difficult; 1 hear the Roseland Town Council meet­ings are open to the public. 
Bottom line: What two errant oflic11rs lost doesn't begin to compare to what nine college students surrendered three weeks ago -their innocence.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
We could use a little crisis 
Tlw sociologist C. Wright Mills speaks of indif'­fnrPnce and uneasiness as two major problems in sociPly. It seems that Notre Dame is a society to which this applins. Mills giwis four possible states: well-lwing, crisis. imlifl'Prence and uneasiness. Well-lwing is clwrishing a snt of values which are 1101 UmatPmid in any way. Crisis is clrnrishing val­ues which are threat1lncd lncliffrrence is defined as tlw slahl or not !wing awarn or eitlmr cherished valuPs or threats. Finally, unm1siness is the state ol' 11ot bPing aware of d{Prished values, but only of tlw thrNtl. Tim qtH'st.ion now is, when1 are Notrn DanH\ studm1ts on this scale? 
The ideal. of course, is that Notre Dame students would be in a statr of well-being. That is some­thing !'or which I am quite certain we all wish. If one·s idPals are n~al. one~ can do nothing less than hopl\ that them will be no t.hrnats to those ideals and tlwy will p11rvade society. 
Of cotirsP. it sef\ms almost impossible tn be in a total stall' ol' wr.11-bPing. Perhaps thern are those \Vho arP rnmplc\t.Ply salis!iPd with roality and soci­Pty as tlwy are. but it s1wms that for most peopl11, society dof)S not rnach their own idr.als nor hold tlwir own values. ;\t lr.ast, sodetv docs not hold tlw valuPs which most prol'rss ___: whetlwr or nol llwy aetually l\Old those values themselves is up to dPbatP. 
In any casr, a Catholic or Christian in g1meral could n·ot be in a statl' of wrll-being. There is poVPrty. war. murder and all kinds of evil in this society. A trur Christian could not possibly be con­tPnt with such a d1ipravrd world. 
It sePms that tlw Christian and thus tlw vast ma,iority ol' I\Jotn Dam,, studPnls must be in a statP of' crisis. As Christians we hold lofty values and idrals. For Catholics, legalized abortion, tlw d<'ath p('natty, s1mseless wars. the divorce rate, the multitude of broken homes and tlrn general depravity of lirP among much of America's poor can do nothing but threaten cherished values. 
Society seems in direct conf1ict to the Christian's values. Why then are Notre Dame students not up in arms'? It seems that any who felt their most fun­damnntal and cherished values threatened would d<i anything to protect tlrnm. /\.s the students of the pnrninr Catholic univm·sity in America, it seems that WP should be leading the defense of Christian valu1\s. This, of course is not the case. 
By far. it seems that Notre Dami' studrnts are co11Wnt with tlwir situations. On the surface it sPems that we am all in a state of' well-being. llowcver, it has been shown that no true Christian could possibly bl' in such a state of well-being in such a tim11 as this. Thus. perhaps we come to the conclusion that Notre Dame students arc, in gen­oral. not true Christians. 
Maybe this is harsh, but I believe deservedly so. Indifli-ircnce plagues this University. I do not con­demn llw olhm· students here. for I am certainly part of the problem. I have a certain indifferenc11 in myself -a certain lazin11ss rnally. I believe myself to have high ideals. but. in fact, ifl had those idmtls I would b<l protecting them from the throats of soci11ty. How could I stand by on the policies of Notrn Dame about sweatshops and homosexuality or sit idly by and watch the com­m unity of South Bend as a passive observer, never lending a hand. It seems more likely that I am in a state of indifference. 
I hav1' not a real awareness of the values I claim tn hold. and thus I can perceive no threat to them. Of course. every Notre Dame student is not like this but I do not believe I am alone in my indifference. 
Indiffornnrn takPs many forms in this llniversitv. Often it seems that it is sfmply an unwillingness to speak up. Whether it simply be pointing something out in class or writing a letter of protest to Monk, wn are unwilling to do it. It seems that the only way to combat this indifference is revealing th hypocrisy. No real Christian should be able to go lo Mass nvery Sunday in such a state of indiffer­ence. 
It seems odd to say, but perhaps we all need a little crisis in our lives.

What if they weren'tjust a few words, but a sentence, or two sen-. tences or a statement (if there's a differ-P,nce)? 
see what's really there -and for that instant nothing is clouded by the fe111ings of fear. 11, , doubt, or shame forced on us by today's ; t societv. And in these moments, we find ' , : ours~lves inspin~d to do what our heart really wants. Often, we let this inspiration slip away as the real world slowly creeps back into place. Sometimes, a tiny part of the 
-1.inspiration remains with us andImotivates us to follow our ' heart along a path we passed'Ii up before. Whatever the out-

I find myself lost in these thoughts when I notice my friend's mother is speaking. She fights back tears and occasionally pauses to regain her com­posure as she assures us my friend, if he could see us, would look each one of us in the eyes and tell us he is going to beat this thing. That's the moment-the moment that inspired this letter. The moment that makes life special, in my opinion. The moment that lets us pull back from all the influence society and the sur­rounding world has on our everyday thoughts and actions. 
Sometimes, not that oftP,n, someone says something

As I turn to leave, I start to think about "scrub down" again and remind myself to check the sign when I walk out the door. By the time l reach the door, however, I'm back on the subject of "good days" and "bad days." I'm not so sure today was a bad day ...

Criticism of Bob Jones hypocritical 
I appreciate Jim Kwiatt's letter (Thurs., March 9) regarding George W. Bush's campaign at Bob Jones University before the South Carolina primary. I agree with him that American politics is in a sad state where candidates are making "politically strategic moves" rather than caring for tlre welfare of the people they represent. However, I arri a bit alarmed at his conclu­sions. 
I have never set foot on the campus of Bob Jones University, but I do plan to visit it in the future. I have received a paper from their campus web site responses at www.bju.edu/response.htm. and have carefully read it. 1know many Bob .Jones graduates (including Bob .Jones IV who completed the coursework for a doctor­ate degree in history at Notre Dame a couple of years ago} and I have been impressed with their integrity and high morals. I have come to a different conclusion than Mr. Kwiatt based on personal experience rather than what the media leads us to believe. 
First of all, I am sure that if Mr. Kwiatt were to look at every university in America he would find something at each university that he would disagree. Each institu­tion has a purpose statement and policies it adheres to that helps it accomplish its purposes. That is part of the privilege and beauty of living in America. 
America is the most religiously diverse nation in the world, with all of the denominations and sects dis­agreeing with one another and yet getting along amaz­ingly well. I believe that---1mr forefathers called it free­dom of religion. When institutions do not agree on cer­tain areas, iL does not mean that one side hates the other. 
I was raised Catholic and have strong Catholic par­ents. I left the Catholic Church when I was a junior in 
. 

college. According to Mr. Kwiatt because I don't agree with my Catholic parents, I hate them. Do I? Most cer­tainly not! Do they hate me? I don't think so! Do I call my parents bigots or do they call me one? No. 
According to Mr. Kwiatt's reasoning and conclusions, because he disagrees with me, J should be calling him a bigot and a "member of a hate-espousing organiza­tion," (namely Notre Dame), which is like the Ku Klux Klan who misuse Scripture in order to justify its actions. (These are pretty strong words and seem to place Mr. Kwiatt on the same level as our name-calling mud-slinging politicians!) 
I hope Mr. Kwiatt is careful in throwing stones at Bob Jones University. He called BJll an "institution rooted in bigotry." The definition of a bigot is "one obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his own church, party, belief, or opinion." It was announced on the Larry King Show recently that BJU has dropped their inter-racial dating policy. I thought bigots obstinately didn't change. 
In closing, I want to ask two questions that will prove that both Notre Dame and Bob Jones University are not open-minded (and are therefore institutions of so­called bigotry). Would Bob Jones University allow a Notre Dame graduate who adheres to the Notre Dame doctrinal statement teach on its campus? No. Would Notre Dame allow a Bob .Jones graduate who adheres to B.JU's doctrinal statement to teach on Notre Dame's campus? No again. Please take the beam out of your own eye before taking a speck out of another's.

Nunnin' around 

Tlw nun costunw h1Ls long bren a thing that I have had qm,stions about. The coslunms seemt>d to make tlw wonwn bPhind tlwm sooo.. hard to gPt to. "Tlw Gn·ut Humun Empcr'or PPnguins" ruled the icebergs of Catholicism. and thrst~ righteous women would waddlP tlwrP ,var to sal\'atinn bnaring \\oodP11 ;-rossns. rosary hPads. and biblPs. /\l lr\ast that is thr old imagr that I had. Thr nuns of wdav. lwwt'VPr. an' way hip anldown to Parth and don'L wear the old gr.t-uµ any morP, at lea.-;t around hen'. 
rrvou'vp PVPr wondPrPd whv nun~ don"t wear a costume · b{~rf' at Notrr DamP. it is bN·ausP most rnligious orders dPcidPd that il wasn't necP.s­sm-v lf'vou want to know mon ab,;ut 1{unning. l rr:C'ommend that vou spPak to a nu11. Most ofth(m1 v.ill talk to vou. thal is. il'vou lmvP a srcret nun decodPr ring and know thP S('CTet nun handshakP. But somr don't even rcquirr that you havr accrss to that stuff. Thf' mPssagP hPn is. "talk to nuns." It nPver hurL'i to haw a few good nuns on your sidr. Pspr.cially thr.sP days with all that sin going around. 
Also. ifvou PVPr make a nun mnd. vou will have the µowP;. from other nuns tn countr.~·act thP nun ·s prayPrs against you. Just kidding around. "luns 1wwr prny against pPople.just on thPm. Just kidding again. Only vampin' nuns do that. The nun profes­sion is PxtrPmelv honorable and doesn't desrrvP to bP pokPd fun at~ but I reel lhat one can nevfir bn too humblP. 
Sometinws bPing friends or just talking with a nun can SPPm intimidating. In that case. the best lhing to do would bP to sPe a movie about nuns to grt warmed-up. A f'ew movies that have good represen­tations of nuns are "The Sound of Music." "Madeline" and TV's "The \Vr.ekend Nun". But reallv thr bPst representation of a nun can be found in a · movie called Sister Act. After watching thesP movies rou'll bP singing and dancing with Pvery nun you meet. 
A fun nun artifact that you rnn see on r.ampus is the nun r.hute. I think it is attar.bed to the First Yrar of Studies Building. Anyway. it is the building next to Lewis Hall. There is a cylinder attar.bed to the build­ing that served as a nun fire escape. It is a twisty slidf:. The door isn't locked eithP.r. and vou can stick your head up then~. or even dimb up there. and experience fire escaping the nun way. 
Nuns an' great. but I honestly wouldn't mind if somr. nuns took timf' to feed some of the birds. Then nuns could walk around campus with birds on their shoulders whistling happy songs. I think life would seem lots P.asier if I saw that kind of stuff everyday. That would bP really something. 
I have often thought it would br a fun idea to havP a nuns vs. priest.-; softball game. or water balloon toss. or BPngal Hout'i. I bet they could raise a lot of money doing something like that.

To enter I Inward Hall. on< must pass undrr thr often­quiet lloward Hall arclws. 
1 lowewr. the hall's entrance is not llw only quiet parl of thf' dorm. SituatPd sideways on South Quad. I Inward I !all has a reputation as bc\ing onf' of thP morn quiPt dorms on ('ampus. 
"I think wr. arc probably onf' of tlw morn consm-vatiVf! dorms on campus ... We take our studies seriously," said Sue Hinderlider. now in her lhird and final year as the dorm's rector. "We'rn not one of the run-around-and-act­like-fools kinds of dorms." 
Part of the reason that the dorm is mlativrly quiet is that 50 of il9 167 residents live in single rooms. 1-!inderlider said. 
"We get a lot of people who lloat in from other dorms for singles," she said, explaining that those residents tend to be less involved in the dorm. "I think that does make a differ­ence 
In addition. hardlv two rooms am alike, and few other dorms have two-roo;1 doubles. Hindertider explained. 
"It has a home-like feel." said freshman Veronica Kelleher, adding that it does n(Jt havP a "cinderblock atmosphere" like some newer dorms on r.ampus. 
"I think we're unique both architecturally and spirit-wise ... We're kind of here d(Jing our own thing," Hinderlider said. She also said that the dorm's small size allows il-; resi­dents to get to know each other better. 
"Just the fact that Howard is a small dorm encourages a close-knit sense," said Camille Fitzpatrick. a Howard RA. "Since it is small. it's totally dependent on social groups in the dorm." 
lloward residents tend to "move in and out of [each other'sJ rooms like ilc; one room." Kelleher said. 
''I've always really liked it ... This is where my closest friends have come from since the start of freshman year." said Fitzpatrick. who does not believe that the large num­ber oJ' single rooms affects thP social atmosplwrP of tlw dorm. 
Fitzpatrick's decision to become an R/\. during lwr st>nior year was easy. she said. 
"All my friends stayf1d in lloward. so it wasn't a big sacri­fice for me to stay on campus." Fitzpatrick said. 
lndm,d. 26 seniors live in I-Inward. which I lindt>rlidPr said is unusual. especially considering I loward·s size. 
Both Ilinderlider and Fitzpatrick did say that lack or social space wa.'i a problem in the hall. 
"I do wish that Iloward had more social spacP. Pspecially morr. 24-hour spacP.. If you have a bunch of' guy friends over. you pretty much have to go somewhPre rise," Fitzpatrick said. 
Nevertheless. the location of the dorm -on South Quad across from the dining halls and close to the lakes -is par­ticularly convenient, Fitzpatrick said. 
The dorm was built in 1924 and was converted to a women's dorm in 1987. the same year the dorm adopted il"> currr,nt mascot, the I toward Duck. 
The atmosphere of thP dorm has changed somewhat since it was a male dorm. 
According to KellehPr, whose father lived in Howard in the 1 %Os, the male rnsidenLi; used to play football in the hallways and often hit the exit signs. 
Another difference is that the dorm's "green loungP... now used as a study area. once served as a television lounge. Kelleher said. 
Despite the dorm's reputation for being quiet. Kelleher said she has noticed that many of the dorm's cnrr<'nt rPsi­dents enjoy playing music loudly. 
Unlikf: most dorms. Howard was not named after a priest or donor. Instead, the hall gets its name from Timothy Howard, a former dean of the Notre Dame Law School. Howard. who completed his undergraduate degree at the University in 1864. also served as Chief Justice of thP Indiana Supreme Court. 
Though seen as different from other dorms. the Howard Ducks enjoy their quiet place on the lake.

NCAA BASKETBALL 

Boeheim focuses on leading Syracuse to Final Four 
. Orangemen are determined to win despite dim odds 
Associated Press 
SYR\CL'SE, N.Y. 
The crowd will be aj{ainst ihPm and so will ttrn odds. Syracuse coach Jim Bocheim is unfuzed as he tries to lead his Orangcmcn back to tlw NCAA tournament's Final four for thf' sf'cond time in five years. 
··we're  plrrying  tlw  game  
wlwre they tell  us  LO  play it."  
Boeheim  said  as  he  began  
preparing  for  a  trip  into  

Micl1igan State's backyard on Thursday. "We're go.ing to go out and play. We're not worried about something we can't con­trol." 
Afti>r vict.or.ics over Samford and Kenturky in the Midwest Rrgional. fourth-sr,cded Syracuse (26-51 will play the top­SPPded Spartans f28-7l at the Palace in Auburn llills. l\1ich. That's just a short drive from the Mirhigan State campus and, to top it off. l\.lagic Johnson. who lPd Mirhigan State to the nation­al championship in 1979. is experted to be in the stands rooting for his alma mater. 
Spartans coach Tom lzzo is happy for that, but doesn't think the site offers his team that much of an edge. 
"We haven't played a game there," he said. "~one of the players have been there. The crowd could be an advantage a little bit. but nothing like what we went through in North Carolina" in a third-round loss in 

1998. 

The Spartans, !rd by point guard Mateen Cleaves, are on a seven-game winning stniak. with tournament victories over Valparaiso (65-38) and Utah (73­61 ). Sino the start of the new year, they are 19-3 and playing as well as any team in the coun­try. 
This, howpver. is not the regu­lar sAason. 

"Everybody understands it's a one-game situation," said Syracuse's Jason Hart. whose job will be lo neutralize C:Jraves. "The pressure isn't just on us. It's on them as well. Tlrny're supposed Lo do it. We'n, just going to be right here as a stum­bling block." 
Syracuse is coming off a difD­rult 52-50 vktnry iwer Kentucky. The Ornngemen, who had to play much of the second half without center Etan Thomas because of foul trouble, hit just 20-of-63 shoL-; from the field (32 percont) and were 4-of-21 on 3­pointers. 
"We shot pretty bad." said Preston Shumpert, who won the game with a clutch basket from the right corner in the final minute off a feed from Hart. "Sometimes that's going to ·hap­pen. \>\'e've just got to try to look forward to the next game and try to get that out of our minds." 
Because the Spartans are soaring and Syracuse has gone 7-5 since beginning the season with a flourish. the Orangemen are decided underdogs. That suits them just fine.

Padres' Al Martin faces charges of bigamy, assault 
Associated Press 
PEOHIA. J\riz. 

Thn San Dif!go Padrns· low­kPy spring training turned bizarre whnn /\I Martin was accused of' hPing a bigamist and chaq~Pd with nxchanging punchns with a woman who claims shn brcame his wife in a Las Vegas wndding. 
The outnetder. praised as a clubhousf' lP-ader after the Padres got him from Pittsburgh last month. and Shawn l-laggerty-Martin were arrested on assault charges late 1Y1onday night. 
The police report contained accusations of bigamy. threats with a gun and a wedding that Martin admits attending but didn't think was real. 

According to Clark County records, a Shawn M. Haggerty married an Albert C. Martin in Las Vegas on Dec. 11. 1998. The police report lists Haggerty's middle name as Michelle, but Martin's is listed as Lee. 

"Everyone's shocked," third baseman Phil Nevin said Tuesday. "He's a great guy." 
Martin and Haggerty-Martin were released on their own recognizance. and told to stay awav from each other. 
While the Padres were play­ing the Chicago Cubs, owner John Moores and general man­ager Kevin Towers met with Martin and his wife, Cathy, at their Scottsdale home for about 1 1/2 hours. 
"He's very emotional, very embarrassed," Towers said late Tuesday afternoon. "The last thing he wanted to do was be here (fourl weeks and be a dis­traction to this baltclub before we start our season." 
Towers and Moores left 
Martin with a copy of the police 
report "so he knows what's 
been said from the other side. 
"It's been kind of a shock, but 
I think we do owe it to Al and 
his family to wait 
and hear what 
as possible, but was probably going to go away for the night. 
Towers said Martin has known Haggerty-Martin for 4-5 years, and that Cathy Martin is aware or her. 
"This is something that I think they've had some prob­lems (with) in the past," Towers said. "He kind of got into a situ­ation where he really didn't know how to get himself out of it." 
In Scottsdale Justice Court, Martin was barefoot and wore the same ripped white shirt, speckled with blood. that he had on when he and Haggerty­Martin wern arrested. 
Haggerty-Martin was charged with assault-domestic violem;e, and Martin was charged with assault-physical injury and threatening or intimidating, all misdemeanors. 
Police will investigate 
Haggerty-Martin's allegation 
that Martin is married to two 
women.

through his agent. Jeff Moorad, categorically denying the charges against him. 
"Last night I had an argu­ment with a woman, Shawn Haggerty, whom I have known for several years. This argu­ment escalated and eventually led to police intervention," Martin said. "I take these charges extremely seriously and will continue to cooperate fully with the authorities inves­tigating this incident." 
Towers has known Martin since his days as a scout with the Pirates in the early 1990s. 
"This would be the last guy that I think this would ever happen to," Towers said. "He's always been a model citizen and a guy who represents him­self well."

the Padres are to play the Arizona Diamond-backs in San Oiego. 
The argument at a Scottsdale home started when Haggerty­Martin accused Martin <lf still being married to someone else. Oirren said. Haggerty-Martin began hitting Martin and he punched hrr in the jaw at least once, Dirren said. 
She called 911. and Martin left before police arrived. Martin later called the house, and police asked him to return. Two guns were confiscated. police said -one that a nanny had hidden in a dresser drawer when the couple started fight­ing and one that was in the glove box of Martin's vehicle. 
Haggerty-Martin had a swollen face and he had scratches across the bridge of his nose and behind his left ear. according to the police report. 
Haggerty-Martin told police 
she had had a couple of glasses 
of wine and took codeine and 
zanax, an anti-anxiety drug, for 
a headache. 
The Padres acquired Martin 
from the Pirates on Feb. 23 in a 
trade for utilityman John 
Vander Wal and two minor lea­
guers. Martin had wanted out 
of Pittsburgh and was eager to 
play for a West Coast learn. 
Towers said at the time of the 
trade that Martin was a 
"tremendous clubhouse pres­
ence" and a team leader. 
Haggerty-Martin told police 
she did not know that Martin 
was married to another woman 
when she and the ballplayer 
were wed in Las Vegas on Dec. 
11, 1998. 

Haggerty-Martin said that at 
some point she realized that 
Martin was still married, but he 
kept telling her that they were 
getting a divorce. 
Martin told police that he is 
not married to Haggerty-Martin 
but that she has been his girl­
friend for about six years. 
Martin told police that he 
attended a ceremony in Las 
Vegas a couple of years ago but 
didn't believe it was real.

Sean Lampley seems to save his biggr.st games for the NIT.

Irish need to maximize their bench production. Their reserves only scored five points in Mondav's win over Xavier, all from reserve point guard Martin Ingelsby. 
"We've been in situations before where we were coming oIT of a big game and a big win and we've won," sophomore forward David Graves. who led Notre Dame with 24 points Monday, said. "It's been a long season for us, and we've had a lot of ups and downs. We can't have anv more misfortunes. We need to ·come out and play with our "A" game the rest of the year." 
The Cougars will be smarting from the sting of losing home court advantage to the Irish. BYU had nearly 17,000 fans attend in their second-round game, but the Irish snared the home berth with only 9,000 fans in the crowd. The once silent Irish crowd has grown increasingl.y supportive this season, helping them win the home bid with their excite­ment. 
"We did a good job during the year, and were a strong bubble team if you will," Doherty said. "I think that may have helped get us the home games, but I think the Joyce Center fans have been great. The NIT likes to have big crowds. so I think we've earned the right, although BYU has had great crowds, too, so I'm sure they could complain and say that they deserved a home game. I think that maybe Coach Cleveland would. use that to motivate his team, that thev feel slighted that they didn't get a home game." 
Senior point guard Jimmy Dillon feels a little added moti­vation to play his best, since a loss means the end of his sea­son and his Notre Dame career. 
"It's more motivation and incentive for me to leave il all out there," Dillon said. "Bec;aus!l if the outcome doesn't Pend up a win, it ·will be my last game." 
Regardless of who wins tonight, the Irish have done better than most people expect­ed this yeilr. Even Dillon con­cedes that few would have pre­dicted in October that the Irish would be playing this late in March. Forecasts that may have seemed like pipe dreams five or six months ago are not good enough now. 
"We're not finished vet." Dillon said. "Coach has already talked about how if we lose now, people could say we've had a great year. And we have had a great year, but there's no reason we can't win a couple more big games and I think only one or two teams get to finish the year with a win. It'd be a real accomplishment of' ours to be able to hang a ban­ner."

"One or my goals is just to enjoy my final yPar playing tennis at Saint Mary's," Kremer said. "I also want Lo brat the teams that we lost to last year. especially the conf'Arcnce matches against I lope and Albion." 
"WP. want to win our confer­ence," Stevenson said. "Also, WP would want to qualify for the NCA region tournament -they only take eighL teams out of the Midwest. Our biggest goal, though, is to have fun."

7.4 seconds left. 
The Sun Devils {19-13) were held to their second-lowest point total of the season. 
N.C. State trailed 41-33 with 
14:15 left as House scored 24 of his team's 26 points during one span. But a 19-6 run highlight­ed by two 3-pointers by Tim Wells gave the Wolfpack a live­point lead with 5 1/2 minutes lef't. 
The score was tied twicn down the stretrh before Inge's winning shot. 
House scored 17 of Arizona State's final 19 points of the first half and assisted on the other basket. Over the last 3:50, he sank two 3-pointers. hit a baseline jumper. a shot in the lane and a three-point play.

win over Raptors 
Associated Press 
TORONTO 

Kendall Gill scored 24 points and held Vince Carter dunk­free as the New ,IPrsey Nets beat the Toronto Raptors 100­93 on Tuesday night.

Johnny Newman scored seven straight points on two jumpers and a three-point play to give the Nets an 84-75 lead early in the fourth quar­ter. 
The Raptors dosed within four on Tracy McGrady's dunk off a missed free throw with just under six minutes rema111111g, but Stephon Marbury made a driving layup and a three-point play to give the Nets a 91-82 lead. 
Toronto's Doug Christie fol­lowed with a 3-pointer to close within six. but Gill fol­lowed with a jumper to make it 93-85. Keith Van Horn ·s dri­ving layup made it 95-87 with 2:40 rema111111g, and Marbury's driving layup with 
1:29 to go made it 97-89. 
Marbury had 18 points and seven assists. Newman fin­ished with 14 points for the Nets. who shot 51 percent from the field to move within two games of Orlando for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East.

Jackson added two free throws with 6.3 seconds lert to clinch the victory. Ile finished with 15 points, as did team­mate Alan Henderson. 
Miami was noticeably ragged after losing 110-89 to the Los Angeles Lakcrs the previous night at home, snap­ping a fivfl-garne winning streak. This dP.feat was espe­cially crucial since the Heat began the night 3 1-2 games behind Indiana for best record in the Eastern Conference.

Jor Smith's baseline jumper gave Minnesota a 107-105 lead with 44 seconds left in overtime, and Cleveland's Andre Miller missed a short jumper with 10 seconds left. 
Garnett's two free throws at 
8.6 seronds made it 109-105. but Bob Sura's rebound bas­ket with two seconds left made it a two-point game again. Brandon was fouled with nine-tenths of a second left and sank both shot'i.

Irish pitchers prepare to take turns against Titans 

Pitcher Matt Buchmeier has helped lead the team to its best start {12-3) since 1963. The Irish host the Detroit Titans today. 
By NOAH AMSTADTER 
Sporrs Writer 
Coming off of a sur.r.cssful 7-1 showing over spring vacation, the Irish baseball team plays its s<~cond honrn game of' the SPason

min-ed  
variely ol'  
pitchers  will  rotate  on  the  

mound for the Irish against a dub that was 14-33 last season. 

"We don't want to pilr.h any­body an extended period of time," said head coach Paul MainiPrL "W<~ want our pitrhPrs to be fresh for this weekend (against Big East opponrrnt Villanova(." 
The Irish, who hold a 12-'.-3 record, are off to their best start sinr.e 1963, when they also opened the season with the samo record. At the Kennel Club Classic in ,Jacksonvillfl, Fla., Notre Damo beat then-rankPd University of Illinois twice, pro­polling the Irish to a No. 24 national ranking by Collegiate Baseball. 
During the Jacksonville trip, freshman Brian Stavisky stepped up to lead the Irish ollenso. The rookie led the team in batting averago, hits, and home runs during the final five games of' the tournament. Stavisky pro­duced at least one hit in each game of' the tournament, while moving around the batting order between the No. 2, No. 4, and 
No. 5 spots in the linnup. 
"I feel reallv comfortable at the plate now:" he said. "I fe11 l rnally comfortable up there. Tlw coac!H1s have brcn helping me be more relaxed and sne the ball and hit it. Hverything WPnl rnally well in tlw last !'PW ganws. 
Stavisky's play holppc] ignitn an olfnnsc that had brt'll some­what stagnant, at !Past in com­parison to the Wam 's successful pitching. The team's eanwcl run avrrago now stands at an unb<'­lievable 2.3'J. 
Leading tlw pitching staff in Florida was acn right-hander Aaron IIoilman. Tho junior co­captain dominatod Big T<'n oppo,rnnts Illinois and Iowa in· his two starts. Against Iowa, llliilman struck out 11 Hawk<1yps while allowing only two runs in tlw compl!'tP-gamc victory. 
But it was frr1shman pitch<'r 
J.P Gagnr who turnPd in prr­haps the most important perf'or­mancr of' the tournamrnt for tlrn Irish. The right-hander helped solidify thn questionabln Irish middh~-rdiel' c.orps as Im tossed eight shutout innings and picked up two wins. 
Senior right-hander Scott Cavoy started against Central Michigan and pitched f'ive shutout innings before being forced out when Im was hit by a line drive. Cavey had to miss his second start in Florida, but will start this werkend at Villanova.

Elizabeth Barger, Suddarth. Ni.xon and sophomore Kelly Hecking also swam to the best finish of any Notre Dame relay team, placing ninth overall. Winning the consolation final heat, the squad 
improved two spots from their 11th place finish a year ago, finishing in 
4:07.00. The swim earned all four swim­mers honorable mention All-America honors. 
Junior Alison Newell also made her second career appearance at NCAA finals, placing 12th in 2:13.24. The swim was Newell's first return to NCAA finals since her freshman season in 1997.

While ono of the goals for the team was to qualify more women for the championship than last season, the team managed to move up in the team rank­ings with fewer swimmers and divers. 
"We were able to move up to where we wanted to be, and we did that with fower swimmers," Weathers sctid. "Of course, when you get there, you always want to finish a little bit better. But we accomplished everything we wanted to." 
Overall, the finish marked a shift for the team they have been striving for all season. 
"It's important for the kids to know that they can be successful at this level," Weathe~s said. "No one can argue that they weren't well prepared for this."

SWIMMING AND DIVING 

Notre Dame captures more titles over spring break 
By NOREEN GILLESPIE 
Sporrs Writer 
There weren't too many honors the women's swimming and diving team hadn't earned during the 1999-2000 season. but they man­aged to notch a few more over spring break. 
After earning their fourth consew­tivc Big East title, six women trav­eled to Indianapolis to secure their last honor of the season: an 18th place team finish at the NCAA Division I Swimming and Diving Championships Marrh 15-17. 
The Georgia Bulldogs won the meet for the second year in a row. followed by runner-up Arizona. The Irish improved 10 spots from their 1999 finish. 
"Our finish at NCAAs was the most critical thing this team has acr,om­plished," said head coach Bailey Weathers. "We entered the meet wanting to be in the top 20 and have all the girls score in the meet, and we did that. It's a big step for this team." 

The honors didn't stop just at the team finish. Several swimmers and one diver earned All-America rank­ings for performances throughout the weekend. 
Junior sprinter Carrie Nixon placed fourth in the 50-meter freestyle, after winning the prelimi­nary heat in the morning. Nixon, who won the event and reset her own record at the Big East Championships, had placed six­teenth in Lhe event last year. She also earned an All-America ranking for her finish. 
Nixon logged in at 25.9 seconds in the finals, coming off a 24.99 mark in prelims. She finished .12 seconds
