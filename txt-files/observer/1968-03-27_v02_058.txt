Administration Suspends Four For Parietal Rules Violation 

By P.J. SCHROEDER Four st~dents, one from Alumni and three from Zahm Hall were suspended Wed. afternoon from the University for the remainder of the semester by Rev. James Riehle, Dean of Students. The suspensions were the result of two separate incidents involving violation of the Parietal Hours regulation. 
An Alumni Junior was found in his room early last Fri. morning with a co-ed from Indiana University, South Bend extension, by a campus security officer and the girl's father. The girl, he said, a singer for a local band, came uninvited into his room about 
9:30 pm the previous evening. He added that several other members of the band arrived soon afterwards aml they listened to recordings of songs they were planning to learn. About 1:00 am, he said, the others in the band left his room and he fell asleep in a chair while the girl slept on the bed. When he awoke the next morning he said that the girl's father, accompanied by a cam­pus security officer, knocked on the door and asked him if he knew where the girl was. He told them that she was in the room where­upon she left with her father and the student was told by the officer to contact his rector and Father Riehle. 
Unable to reach his rector, the student went to Riehle's office and was told to return later that afternoon. When he returned, Riehle told him that he would receive a hear­ing the following Monday afternoon by the Dean of Student's Campus Disciplinary Board. 
The Disciplinary Board is composed of J.ve Hall Rectors: Rev. James Flanigan of Dillon, Rev. James McGrath of Keenan­Stanford, Rev. Matthew Miceli of Cava­naugh, Rev. Thomas Blantz of Zahm, and Rev. John Dupuis of Howard. 
He presented his case before the Board Mon. and was told to return yesterday after­noon for the results. It was at this time that Father Riehle informed him of his sus­pension, emphasizing that the punishment was a result of a violation of the University regulation of Parietal Hours and not for a moral violation. 
The other suspensions were incurred by three sophomores from Zahm Hall who said that their offense took place eight wee~ ago, although action was taken by 
Rev. James Riehle, CSC 
Father Riehle only this week. 
The three said that they returned to their room after Semester Break to find three girls from Sm.th Bend waitin! there, un­
invited. They said that the giils had run 
away from home and were afraid to return 
home that evening so they allowed them to 
remain in the room until morning. The 
three sophomores say they think the vio­
lation came to their rector's attention be­
cause several other students who knew of 
the incident had "spread the story all over 
campus." 

They said that their rector called them into his office several days ago and told them that he had learned of the violation and was informing Father Riehle. Their testimony was also heard by the Campus­Disciplinary Board and the verdict was hand­ed down by Father Riehle yesterday. 
Student Body President, Chris Murphy, said he had been in close contact with air the parties involved and that he was "very .disturbed by the Dean of Student's ruling." 
"It is clear to me that the Administration wishes to persist in its policy of treating the students of this University as objects rather than human beings. I feel that this is highly indicative of the way they are begin­ning to deal with student problems. This crackdown came with absolutely no policy statement before hand. 1 am also disappoint­
ed that they refused to use the Campus 
Judicial Board; I really think it is hypo­critical that the Judicial Board was not allowed to handle It." 
"The Administration is always paying 
lip service to the theories of community ~ arrl greater communication, but in fact, nei­ther is being exercised. I consider the pun­
ishments most excessive. They are using these men as examples and.I don't like to see anyone made an example of." 
When contacted yesterday afternoon, Fa­
ther Riehle refused to comment about the 
offences or the suspensions saying only that 
he had not given the cases to the Campus 
Judicial Board because he felt that it was 
not yet organized enough to deliberate on 
matters this serious. He added, however, that 
he had recently handed on to the Board a 
>erious case of theft. 
Chuck Nau, Student Body Vice-President­
elect, said: "The timing of this whole thing 
is what fascinates me. First, Student Govern­
ment gets this massive stab in the back in 
the form of a letter, addressed to the whole 
campus, which humiliates our Student Body 
President, Chris Murphy. Then, immediately 
following that, you get four suspensions for 
violation of parietal hours. Why, the Ad­
ministration hasn't done a thing about Par­
ietal hours all year long. If this is their idea 
of 'getting tough' then I'm afraid they may 
have bitten off a little more than they can 
chew." 
Richard Rossie, who will succeed Murphy 
as Student Body President, spent almost 
three hours in conference with Father Res­
burgh and said that he was doing everything 
in his power to have the four students 
reinstated in the University "tomorrow, if 
not sooner." He said that Father Hesburgh 
agreed to meet with the four students 
yesterday evening and that he would prefer 
to await the outcome of that meeting be­
fore he made any final decision as to what · further action would be forthcoming on the part of Student Government. 
Father James Flanigan, membe! of Father 
Riehle's Disciplinary Board and Rector of 
Dillon Hall, said last night that while he 
would have prefered to see the cases go 
before the Campus Judicial Board he felt 
that the University was in a period of great 
change and that he regarded the current 
system as a "stop-gap" measure. He said: 
"I will welcome the day when the students 
show themselves both ready and capable of 
really disciplining themselves." 

Murphy Plans No Written Response 
Student Body President Chris Murphy said last night that he was "disappointed" in the letter which Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, CSC, President of the University, mailed to him and the student body on Monday. Father Res­burgh's letter was in response to a letter which Murphy and six other student leaders mailed to him accompanying the bills pass­ed at February's General Student Assembly. 
"I'm certainly not going to answer it in the tone that it was sent to me," Murphy said. "I don't feel the Student Body will deal on that level." 
"I hope that the students see it for what it is and don't let him create the division that he is try­ing to create." 
Murphy thought that in his letter Father Hesburgh was avoid­ing the main issue-the General Assembly. 
"Admitedly there were typ­ing mistakes," Murphy said in re­ference to one of Father Hes­burgh's accusations. He said, however, that he had to print up over 1000 copies of the thirty page document and that Student Government was pressed for time. 
The thirty page packet which Father Hesburgh received includ-_ ed copies of all the bills passed also said that there was no "Lo­at the General Student Assembly. cal Council" of the University. It also included a xeroxed copy Last night Murphy said that of a letter which explained the Father Hesburgh was not asked bills which the packet contained to make a decision on the mat­and outlined a suggested means erial by the date suggested.

The other two bills concern the draft and US policy in Viet­nam. Calling the succession of South Vietnamese governments "fabrications of representative democracy," and noting that "the war is more revolutionary in character than a matter of foreign invasion," McKenna and Higgins ask that "the Student Senate of the University of No­tre Dame condemn the present American policy in Vietnam. And, as concerned citizens we call on the United States' Gov­ernment to seek honestly a pea­ceful solution to the Vietnamese conflict, recognizing bombing ce­ssation and negotiations with Hanoi and the National Libera­tion Front as immediate prere­quisite conditions for that solu­tion."

The Best Man 
Robert Kennedy's decision to come down from the hills of New 

·Hampshire and do battle for the anti-Johnson turf complicates the anti-war movement more than it should. In one sense, his decision was the Movement's final goal: to organize the forces against the war into a group large enough to serve as a political base. The idea of selflessness in the political sphere was discarded years ago in the slum workings of Chicago and the jails of the South. As a result, the Movement accepted and hoped to use the goals which motivate political action, to speak the politician's own language until at one point, opposing the war would not be courageous but simple political expediency, a smart move. The Movement was speaking to Robert Kennedy. 
Eugene McCarthy's campaign threw all that out the window. Being opposed to the war involves more than rhetoric and Eugene McCarthy was acting when the rest were kept busy polishing the 
hearts they displayed on their cuffs. In the sphere of deals and doublecross, McCarthy emerged as the honest man, an American novelty who could interest the disillusioned young. There is no way to argue that Robert Kennedy's flip of the hat was anything more than a desire for part of that pie. 
Although Kennedy's nomination would be a far cry from the end of the world, Eugene McCarthy is more worthy, if only to keep the young from voting for Lester Pearson next year. Fortunately, the 
choice this year is between two goods, both seeking one important end. The important thing is still the war's end and most will take that any way they can get it. Robert Kennedy still has to demon­strate that his way is the most likely of success. 
In some respects, Robert Kennedy approximates Lyndon Johnson. Both are political opportunists, although Kennedy, at 42, bases his support on a different and younger age group. Lyndon Johnson's actions are partially excusable; alone in his cause, he has become insane. Robert Kennedy's actions, however, are calcu­lated. On the face of it, he would be the man to support; but instead he is, after Johnson, the man to beat. He proves that a moral position need not serve moral ends; and Lyndon Johnson proves that a president must have his eye on events and not on the 
history book. They are men of the same stamp on opposite sides of the fence. This nation cannot stand another politician, regard­less of his ends. 
Some argue that Robert Kennedy's last minute involvement involves the sacrifice of '72. That may be true; but it may also be true that the source of his support will not remain until that election. This time Robert Kennedy has miscalculated. The argument is made that he can win and that McCarthy cannot; but no one explains how that will come about. If Kennedy depends on the young, they already belong to McCarthy; and, if he depends on Mayor Daley or John Bailey, he has already lost the first and who needs the other? 
That two men should run on the same opposition to the war is a good sign. Still, one of the two is the better man and that man is Eugene McCarthy. McCarthy was the first to make Lyndon John­

. son worry, to hit him in his Achilles heel, to deliver the vote. Up until now, Lyndon Johnson could pursue a second term with little more purpose than a sure occupational deferment. Eugene McCarthy's campaign was the first real attempt to correct that 
enormous flaw. Just once, on this mad planet, the best man should be able to win.

ISO Students, I 0 Profs Consider Students And Draft 
One hundred fifty students and ten faculty members attend­ed a "colloquium on the draft and the future of students" in the Library Auditorium Sun. af­ternoon. The principal speaker, Ned Buchbinder, pointed to the need for draft counseling at No­tre Dame (due to the fact that many students have changed their stand on the war in Vietnam). "I started draft counseling be­cause no one else around here seemed to know the draft law­not even lawyers." The Office of Academic Affairs has a win­dow for selective service infor­mation, however, Buchbinder fe­els that most of the information distributed here is incorrect. 
Buchbinder says that too ma­ny students seem apathetic to the draft. "They seem to think it won't affect them for several years. This isn't a very sound position. I quote General Her­shey, '-a decision to send 200,­000 more troops to Vietnam wo­uld mean we would have to draft some college students.' " 
The longer the war continues, the harder it will be to get graduate school deferments. "I can't tell people to turn in their draft cards or go to Canada. But if we are to do anything mean­ingful, it must be together. Thr­ough appeals, one can delay in­duction for about a year. If we can get together and we do ap­peal and appeal together as a group,-gee, selective service will be fouled up." He also noted that, starting Mon., there will be ·draft counseling every night from 
7:00 p.m. to midnight in one of the group study rooms in the library. The number of that room will be posted on the library bulletin board. 
"We're not just telling people how to apply for a C. 0. classifi­cation. We also tell them about 
other draft classifications such as 1-Y, 4-F. Some are even sent to Colonel Ferrari to discuss 
R.O.T.C. programs that will en­able them to get through gra-
Kerner Says Split Is Not Inevitable 
Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner, chairman of the President's Com­mission on Civil Disorders which reported that America was gra­dually moving toward two sepa­rate societies, one white and one black, said Fri. night that the split was not inevitable. 
"The movement apart can be stopped by a committment to na­tional action. The solution to the urban problem will take time, mo­ney, and effort, but the most im­portant factor must be a change 
in the attitude of the whites­and that doesn't cost a cent," Kerner said. 
Kerner appeared along with 
U.S. Rep. John Conyers, Jr. of Detroit, on a panel which discus­sed Urban disorders Friday night · ashington I. 
duate school. You can't put all your eggs in one basket so it's best to have at least four of five things going for you at once." 
Buchbinder called for students 

and faculty members to support 
those who felt morally bound to 
resist the draft. Petitions signal­
ling draft resistance were circula­
ted to be signed by those who 
wished to do so. The session was 
closed with a brisk question-and­
answer period and the promise to meet again soon. 
Kerner said that the 1967 riots had no pattern. He felt that they could not be termed "race riots." He said that they represented a rebellion against a symbol of white society which Negroes in ghetto areas hold. 
"Increased communication with the ghetto must be accomp­lished. . .the white and Negro must confront each other at the discussion table, or we will con­front later as two hostile na­tions," Kerner reported. "We must end the destruction and vio­lence, not only in the streets, but in the lives of our people." 
Negro Congressman Conyers said that "Urban violence is a sign of hopelessness, not revo­lution. The moderate Negro is 
frustrated."
