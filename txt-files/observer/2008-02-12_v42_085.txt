New policy ignores abstentions in final vote count; Judicial Council pleased with voter turnout, condemns 'abstain' posters 

By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
Judicial Council officials said they were pleased with voter turnout in the student body elections Monday -but they took issue with posters dis­played around campus encouraging voters to abstain from the election. 
This is the first election in which abstentions were elimi­nated from the vote count so that candidates need receive only 50 percent of votes cast for a specific candidate to win the election. 
Judicial Council president Ashley Weiss said the change in tallying abstentions ensures the abstaining votes could not block a ticket from receiving the necessary 50 percent, as happened in the 2007 student body elections. That election was decided by a Senate vote, resulting in the election of stu­dent body president Liz Brown and student body vice presi­dent Maris Braun. 
"We introduced this as a safety net to make sure it doesn't happen again," Weiss said. Weiss and vice president of elections Danny Smith expressed disappointment with posters placed in dorms and South Dining Hall encour­aging students to vote "abstain." One such poster read: "Domers wants you to vote abstain. God save the Irish." 
Though the Judicial Council does not have jurisdiction over the matter unless the person 
responsible is a member of student government, both Weiss and Smith condemned the posters. 
"I think it's a little disheart­ening and almost disappoint­ing that individuals that have really invested themselves in the student body and are striving to achieve more have individuals that are proclaim­ing against that," Weiss said. "In the fashion that they've been putting up the posters, it's disrespectful to the candi­dates and to student govern­ment at large." 
Since none of the posters were approved by the Student Activities Office, Smith said posting around campus is a punishable offense.

Students assist tax filing 
Accounting majors earn credit to provide free help in community 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
As the April 15 deadline for filing income taxes looms, students in the Tax Assistance Program are helping mem­bers of the local community prepare tax returns as part of a two-credit course. 
The program provides free tax-preparing services of fed­eral and state income taxes for any individual or family with a combined income of less than $3R.OOO. 
The Tax Assistance pro­gram "gets students involved in the real world, applying what they are learning in the classroom to real help for real people," course professor Ken Milani said. 
Beginning Feb. 9 and con­tinuing through the tax sea­son, 90 students will spend three hours a week at one of nine designated centers in the South Bend-Mishawaka area. These centers include the Mishawaka Public Library and the South Bend Public Library as well as on-campus locations such as LaFortune Student Center and the Center for Social Concerns. The program extends beyond the area at another site in Plymouth. Ind. 
Assistance is also available for students and staff who have tax returns that meet the income requirement. 
Accountancy majors who have taken a federal tax class are eligible to participate in the Tax Assistance Program, and some students like senior Kevin Manning and Masters of Accountancy student Tricia DeGroot will be participating in the program for a second semester. 

"It just makes you feel good because you know that these people can't afford to have their tax returns done by any­one else," Manning said. 
The Tax Assistance Program was started in 1972 by a law student and an MBA student, and Milani has been instructing the course ever since. 
"The program started with one center and half a dozen students," Milani said. "Now, there are 10 locations and 90 students ... It has changed

Valentine's 

News Wzre Editor
Day is like 
Thank.shriving 
-they're 

both giving holidays. On Thanksgiving, 
we're supposed to give thanks. 
Meanwhile, on Valentine's Day, we 
should give love. 

Not necessarily love in a romantic way. 
And not necessarily lovn in a fmn way. 
I'm not sum in which "way" we should 
hrive love on Valentine's Day, but we 
should givn it. 

To our friends. To our family. To our 
dorm brothnrs. To acquaintances from 
da.ss. To the people we don't like from 
dass. 

Yes, even to the people we don't like 
from da.-.s. 
(Column Intermission #1: My friend 

Kyle the (;mat just stoppt~d by my room. 
She a.-.ked firr a shout-out.) 
.lust as we give universal thanks on 

Tha.nkshriving, we should try to give uni­
versallove on Valentine's Day. 

I know I may sound like a hippie, but I 
honestly have never smoked anything in 
my !if(~. (Some people say that's where I 
went wrong.) 
But hippies aside, Valentine's Day is 

more than a celebration !ilr lovers, a.-. the 
Kay .Jewelers commercial that just 
popped up on my TV suggest.-.. 

To me, the essence ofVahmtine's Day 
was best eaptured this weekend by 

Sunday's showing ofSaving Private Hyan 
on TNT. What love could be greater than 
that Captain John Miller (Tom I Ianks) 

shows li>r Privatn James Francis Hyan, 
some guy he never even met? 

As romantic a.-. those "every kiss begins 
with Kay" commercials may be, love isn't 
just about romance. It's about going 

above and beyond the call ofduty filr a 
friend, a stranger or an acquaintance. 

It's important to remember that non­
romantic love is just as deep as any other 
sort oflove, despite the lack ofattention it 
receives on Valentine's Day. 
According to the "Love is in the 

Moment" Facebook event, suicide rates 
are at their highest at thi..-. time of year. If 
we let our love for our fellow people 

show, we may be able to do something to 
change that. 

In 2005, 32,439 Americans committed 
suidde. But depression isn'tjust limited 
to those who commit or contemplate sui­
cide. The National Institute ofMental 
I Iealth estimates that 18 million 
American suffer from depression, and 

that 20 pen~ent of teenagers will experi­
ence it by the time they reach adulthood. 
Twenty percent of teenagers. As college 
students, approximately half of us are out 
of the teenage years. Look about you. 
One out of live people in your hallway, 

your room, your dorm, your class, your 
table in the dining hall ha.'i suffered from 
depression. 
Thi..'i Valentine's Day, remember to 

share the love. If you're in a relationship, 
don't limit your love to your significant 
other. If you're single, don't bitterly wish 
you had a girlfriend. 
Just love.

Denim sale raises funds for hospital 
By KATIE KOHLER 
Saint Mary's Editor 
Saint Mary's Dance Marathon pilot charity project "Charity Denim," which took place today, attracted nearly 400 students from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's and raised more than $1,200 for Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, fundraising chair Maura Clougherty said. 
Charity Denim sold discounted designer jeans from 40 to 70 per­cent off their original price. The California-based company is a non-profit corporation that part­ners with philanthropic organiza­tions, colleges and other charita­ble organizations. 
Dance Marathon charged $1 admission to see the jeans and raised $350 from admission alone. Sales from jeans and T­shirts raised $977, Clougherty said. 
"The entire total from today is going directly toward the total amount we are donating to Riley from Dance Marathon," she said. 

Clougherty, ·a junior at Saint Mary's, said she didn't know what to expect from the fundraiser. 
"We wanted to raise as much as we could and it went much better than I thought it could go," Clougherty said. "Notre Dame and Saint Mary's was the perfect place to have it because everyone loves designer clothes, but we can't always afford them with books and other college expens­

es." 

In Indianapolis, an average of $9 per pair went toward the prof­it, which equals about 10 percent of the total jean cost. One hun­dred and four pairs of jeans were sold, along with 42 T-shirts and designer jackets, Clougherty said. 
Due to its success, Clougherty is looking forward to welcoming Charity Denim back next year. 
"There are a few things we'd like to see happen differently, like having more guys come, but over­all, it was amazing," Clougherty said. "We are thinking about doing it once in the fall and once in the spring next year." 
While the event started at 2 p.m., students were lined up by 1, Clougherty said. 
Clougherty heard about the event through a friend from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio who participated through her sorority. 
"My friend and I pass ideas back and forth and when she told me about this, I thought Saint Mary's would be a great place to do it," she said. 
Charity Denim offered jeans from a number of brands includ­ing 7 For All Mankind, Citizens of Humanity, True Religion, Antik, Blue Cult, Joe's Jeans, Miss Sixty and Yanuk. 
The Dance Marathon will be held on April4.

Halls co111pete in RecycleMania 
Event raises waste reduction awareness on 400 college campuses 
By KARA COYLE 
News Writer 

With more than 400 col­leges participating in the 2008 RecycleMania chal­lenge, the 10-week compe­tition has propelled the stu­dents of Notre Dame to actively and even stealthily -collect as many recyclables as possible. 
RecycleMania, established in 2001, is a national com­petition to increase recy­cling efforts and raise waste reduction awareness on college campuses. 
Junior Lourdes Long, a member of the co-sponsor­ing Energy and Environmental Issues Committee, said the event is designed to increase con­sciousness of recycling and environmental issues. 
"Awareness is our No. 1 goal," she said. 
The competition is also sponsored by the Student Senate's University Affairs Committee. 
Long said it is the hope of these two committees that over the course of the com­petition, recycling "will become habit" for students at Notre Dame. 
While this is Notre Dame's first year partici­pating in RecycleMania, the University has already increased the competitive­
ness of the challenge by encouraging competition between residence halls. 
"Our goals are to have some fun," said Long. 

As RecycleMania contin­ues in to its third week, the results from the first week have been revealed. In the Per Capita Classic, which measures the amount of recyclables per student in a dorm, Notre Dame 
amassed 1.7 "Awareness is our way. pounds of No. 1 one goal. '' T h e recyclable Recycle Mania goods per competition

For example, Long, along with Ann Kelley, Students for Environmental Action member and Notre Dame's RecycleMania leader, sin­gle-handedly raided every dorm on North Quad last week for recyclables. 
"I'm encour­
aging it," 
Lourdes said. 
''I'm leading the 
ranking the University No. 21 among par­ticipants, according to the RecycleMania Web site. 
On the Notre Dame cam­pus, Farley, McGlinn .and Cavanaugh amassed the most recyclables during week one, while McGlinn, Cavanaugh and Howard were the three leaders dur­ing week two, Long said. 
Some students have gone to extremes to win the com­petition. Residents of some dorms have engaged in recycling raids, often involving costumes, while some editions of weekly dorm notes have encour­
increased 
University recy­
cling efforts. 
This fall, the 
University col­laborated with student vol­unteers to initiate coordi­nated recycling on the days of some home football games. By handing out recycling bags at Notre Dame tailgates, Long said the group "collected thou­sands of pounds of recy­clables." 
The 2008 Notre Dame forum will address the topic of "Charting a Sustainable Energy Future."

During the first four weeks 
of the snmester, the elass 
meets twice a week for

prnparn tax returns at local

"We go through difTernnt sit­

According to Milani, the pro­

"It's great to be able to offer serviens to tho South Bend community, nspecially the fact that it's done through a class that is organized ... you're well-trained and that makes you feel more prepared," DeGroot said. 
Thnre is also a group of snvnn students who will make house calls to individuals who are unable to get to the cen­ters. 
The program staff's a phone center Monday through Friday to answer questions about the service. 
"There aren't a whole lot of phone calls, but we think it's a really nice service for people to be able to speak with a live person," DeGroot said. 
DeGroot said one of the great features of the program is that students have some flexibility when they work at the centers during the week. 
"We have center operations nvery day of the week except Sunday and Friday, and some in evenings and afternoons," DeGroot said. 
Students end up working at the sitos about six times dur­ing the semester. 
The program advertises through Notre Dame and in local nowspapers and radio and television stations. 
"A lot of the people that como to tho sites come bocause tlwy have been bol'ore." DoGroot said. 
Manning has found that the learning nxpnrience extends bnyond just preparing tax returns. 
"It's a roally rewarding nxrwrimu:n to givn somnthing back to community," Manning said. "You get to moot a lot of intPrPsting people who have lived in South Bend thnir wholn lives and talk to you whiln you're preparing their tax return."

Schmidt said he and Reish were "pleased" with the results. The pair is looking for­ward to Thursday's election. 
"We're excited for Thursday," Heish said. "I think our supporters came out and we'll see what happens Thursday." 
Braun and Chamberlain said they were surprised by the results. 
"I think it's really hard to tell how things arc going to pan out, especially in this election with six tickets," Braun said. "I was surprised, but I really did-n't know what was going to happen." 
Though the Braun-Chamberlain ticket received 1,004 fewer votes than the Reish-Schmidt ticket, Chamberlain said he and Braun are not ready to con­cede and are looking forward to the run-off. 
"We're going to keep cam­paigning," Chamberlain said. ''I'm just excited about Thursday, really. We'll just do our best and hope the cam­paign goes well." 
Both tickets said they would evaluate the results and target the dorms where they think they can improve. 
Braun especially stressed the importance of a "grassroots" campaign. 
"I think we're going to take a look at the dorms where we feel we can make an impact and go from there," she said. "We'll focus on grassroots campaigning for the next few days and go from there." 
Reish and Schmidt also plan to visit dorms during the next few days. 
"We're going to reevaluate the dorms we contacted -see where our weak dorms are, see where our strong dorms are and go from there," Reish said. "I think the biggest thing is making sure people realize what we stand for." 
Schmidt said their major con­cern is maintaining the back­ing they already have. 
"Getting those 1,870 kids [that voted for us] to vote again is the biggest thing that we want to push," Schmidt said. 

Both sets of candidates said · it is imperative that students vote on Thursday.

Two CBS journalists missing in Barsa 
BAGHDAD -Two CBS News journalists were missing in the predominantly Shiite southern city of Basra, the network said Monday. 
CBS said all efforts were under way to find the journalists, who were not identified by the network. It requested "that others do not spec­ulate on the identities of those involved" until more information was available. 
Iraqi police said the journalists were taken away Sunday after masked gunmen entered the Sultan Palace Hotel in central Basra. The police spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media. 
"CBS News has been in touch with the fami­lies and asks that their privacy be respected," the network added in a brief statement from CBS Corp. headquarters in New York.

Dr. Len Notaros, the general manager of the Royal Darwin Hospital, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Tuesday morning that surgeons operated on President Jose Ramos-Horta for three hours overnight to remove the fragments and repair his wounds.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. -A feud between two higli school students that began off campus culminated at a gym class Monday when one student shot the other twice, then handed the gun to a coach, say­ing, "It's over now," authorities said. 
The victim, a 19-year-old senior, was in critical condition at a hospital, authorities said.

Bayh: Indiana primary still a factor 
INDIANAPOUS -Indiana's presidential primary is still nearly three months away, but Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh expects it could still help decide the race between I lillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obarna. 
Bayh, who endorsed Clinton last fall after he dropped his own presidential bid, said Monday he was not disappointed in her campaign and continued to support her because of her political experience. 
After primaries on Tuesday in Maryland, Vrrginia and the District of Columbia, the next major contests will be in Texas and Ohio on March 4 and Pennsylvania on April 22. An undecided Clinton­Obama race at that point would turn national atten­tion to the Indiana and North Carolina primaries on May6. 
"Given the nature of our rules, it's going to be very diflicult for either one of these candidates to get a very big lead, which makes it very likely that Indiana will be important," Bayh said.

Faculty, freshmen socialize 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame is embracing a program that creates a social bond between freshmen and some of the University's top faculty. 
No lectures. No reports due. The Hesidcntial Scholars Program provides food and conversation that ultimately help break down misconcep­tions and stereotypes between those members of the Notre Dame community on opposite ends of the academic spec­trum. 
"The program made me feel a part of the Notre Dame fam­ily right away," said Sara .Jaszkowski, a freshman from Boiso, Idaho. "The opportu­nity to befriend professors is unique, and it's a good feeling to know I could turn to any of them with a question or aca­demic struggle." 
The concept is simple. Faculty and freshmen meet rngularly to have dinner on campus and get to know one anotlwr as people. Some of tlwm stay in touch via e-mail. Others have taken it a step further by attending soeial events around campus. 
"The idea is to make the students comfortable in this environment and to help them build relationships and foster friendships with faculty," said Ann Firth, associate vice president for student affairs. "There are no programs at thn dinners. We pray together and then we eat." 

Found<\d in 2005 by Thomas Noble, professor of history and director of Notre Dame's Medieval Institute, the pro­gram is funded by the Offices of theJ:rovost and Student Affairs. It has e·xpanded from two r<~sidence halls in the first year to four '! Singfried, Cavanaugh, Welsh Family and O'Neill. Some 100 students and 35 faculty members currently partici­pate, and there are waiting lists in each of the halls in case any students drop out. Not many do. 
Noble began developing the program after hearing com­
plaints from his colleagues in 
the College of Arts and 
Letters about the lack of 
interaction between faculty 
and students outside the 
classroom. He modeled it 
after a program at the 
University of Virginia, where 
he taught for 20 years. 
"I have had a few serious 
intellectual discussions," 
Noble said. "Mostly, I've had 
lively conversations about the 
kids' families, my family, 
what it's like to be here and 
what it's like to be away from 
home, and I always make a 
point to say 'Go talk to your 
teachers. Get to know 
them."' 
Along with Firth, Noble sought input from Vice President and Associate Provost Dennis Jacobs, stu­dent leaders, dorm rectors and representatives from the First Year of Studies, which universally is regarded as one of the flagship programs for first-year students in higher education and is a key reason for Notre Dame's 98 percent student retention rate from the freshman to sophomore years. 
All participants, at the very least, are stepping out of their comfort zones. For some, the program's benefits have been obvious and invaluable. 
"Last spring I ate dinner with Chris Maziar (vice presi­dent and senior associate provost)," said sophomore Matthew Cossack from Shoreview, Minn. "I learned she used to be in charge of research at the University of Minnesota, which is near my hometown, so I told her I would love to do some type of research there over the sum­mer. She sent me names of her former colleagues who work well with students, and I wound up getting a full-time job in the biochemistry lab of a prominent resl\archer. I spent most days purifying protein samples to look for biomarkers of various dis­eases, which was very appli­cable to my biochemistry major at Notre Dame." 
Now a junior, Dennis Hankin 
of Valrico, Fla., was in the 
pilot program. 
"Before college, I imagined professors to be interested mostly in their own areas of expertise," he admitted. "I never imagined they would find our lives and thoughts intriguing. Professors Christian Moevs (Romance languages and literatures) and Susan Ohmer (film, tele­vision and theatre) still stand out in my memory for their enthusiastic interest." 
Also delighted by faculty fervor, Firth guesses most of the students won't fully real­ize for years the extent of this opportunity. 
"The faculty who are part of the program are world-class scholars," she said. "Although they have incredi­bly busy schedules, they have been extraordinarily gener­ous with their time and care deeply about students." 
For example, Dennis Snow, professor of mathematics, has immersed himself in students' lives by playing guitar during Mass at Welsh Family Hall. Stuart Greene, associate dean for undergraduate studies in Arts and Letters and associ­ale professor of English, and Hope I-lollocher, associate professor of biological sci­ences, took a group of stu­dents to a performance at the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts. 
"If we've made it easier and more comfortable and more attractive for students to talk to faculty members, and we did that for 100 kids in each class, we'd have done some­thing pretty good," Noble said. "I write lots of letters of recommendation, and when it's for a student that I've known for two or three years, had once or twice in class, and spoken to in and out of the classroom, I can write a much more meaning­ful letter." 
Noble hopes to continue to recruit faculty mentors so the program can be expanded to accommodate all interested freshmen.

IN BRIEF Homebuilders stocks rise amid unease 
NEW YORK -Wall Street finished higher in an uneasy session Monday as retail and home­builders stocks rose on expectations for more interest rate cuts, but banks and insurers fell on worries about further mortgage debt troubles. 
The Federal Reserve has been in rate-cutting mode this year and it is expected to lower the federal funds rate once more either this month or at its next regularly scheduled meeting March 
18. And the cheaper cost of money is beginning to register in the stock market. 
"A number of sectors like retail and housing stoeks have done better since the Fed acted, and they are leading the market again today," said Steve Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Co. "These stocks are called early bellwethers and they tend to lead a recovery." 
But investors continue to grapple with bad news in the credit markets. The stock market fell in early trading and remained volatile even after recovering, with Wall Street clearly concerned by news that American International Group Inc. might have more mortgage debt to write off. 

Starbucks joins AT&T to offer wireless 
SEATTLE -Starbucks Corp. and AT&T Inc. will start offering a mix of free and paid wireless Internet service in most of the international coffee retailer's U.S. shops, beginning this spring. 
The move announced Monday ends a six-year partnership with T-Mobile, which did not include tree Wi-Fi and charged higher fees than AT&T will. 
Starbucks said it will give customers who use a Starbucks card two hours of free wireless access per day. More time than that will cost $3.99 for a two-hour session. Monthly memberships will cost $19.99 and include access to any of AT&T's 70,000 hot spol<> worldwide. 
Nearly all of AT&T's broadband Internet cus­tomers, about 12 million, will automatically have unlimited free Wi-Fi access at Starbucks, the com­panies said. 
The deal boosts the number of AT&T hotspots in the U.S. to 17,000 -the most in the nation.An A<>sociated Prnss-Ipsos poll found that only 19 per­cent of those surveyed said they planned to spend their rebate checks. Forty-five percent said they would pay ofl' bills, while 32 percent said they planned to invest the money.

Are you a fascist? 
I have applied to write for The Observer every year since I graduat­ed. This year, I was finally fortunate to find a staff with enough pity to accept me. One of the sample pieces I used to trot out. was about the similarities between fascism and the modern Left. As a short essay must, it stayed on the sur­face in analyzing those similarities, whieh is about as much as I knew anyway. Those surface likenesses are pretty impres-Domer sive, though. In fact, what first lit that particular bulb for me was a speech by Hitler advocating strict gun-control. It was pure liberal boil­erplate. It got me thinking, and with­out much effort, I'd identified plenty more parallels. 
But anything I've written could only look ridiculous compared to Jonah Goldberg's new book. "Liberal Fascism." Jonah writes for the con­servative standard-bearer, National Heview, and is a syndicated colum­nist. lie's been known mainly for his sharp-but-light-hearted wit and pro­found knowledge of pop-culture triv­ia. So it comes as some surprise to many that he uncorked a master­piece, and not about "Star Trek" or "The Simpsons," but about politics and history. 
According to Jonah, what motivated him for this enormous effort was just what provoked my little sample tirade: he was sick of hearing "fas­cist" used reflexively by many liber­als for persons or policies that they do not like. If you have never come across this slander, you probably haven't been paying attention. It can be found at every level, from moron street demonstrators with their "Bush is Hitler" banners, to media professionals like Keith Olbermann and Bill Maher, to college professors. I remember even seeing it in my high school government textbook. There, 


on an illustration of the political 
spectrum, was "fascist" -two steps 
over from "conservative." Some of 
you, while praying publicly for the 
unborn, may have even been taunted 
with "Go home, Christian fascists!" Is 
a richer irony even possible? 
But Jonah argues that this is not a case of the pot calling the kettle black. No, it's more like the pot call­ing the snowflake black. 
To dismiss the notion that conser­vatism is somehow akin to fascism isn't hard. Fascism, like its cousin communism, is a form of totalitarian­ism. Anyone at all familiar with con­servative thought can tell you that two bedrock conservative prineiples are limited government and decen­tralization. Go far enough to the right, and you will end up with a near-libertarian order in which most of what little power the government has is concentrated at the local level. This is totally the opposite of a cen­tralized, all-powerful state. And there are many other enormous differences which space forbids discussing. 
Then why the smear? Liberals think that since conservatives are mean, and Nazis were mean, conser­vatives must be Nazis. They do not look in the mirror and see the nasti­ness and sheer vituperation regularly coming from Howard Dean, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, The New York Times, Air America, left-wing blogs, Hollywood, racist racial demagogues, etc. I could use the rest of my column this year documenting what George Will has labeled the "ferocity gap" between the Right and Left, and yes, I encountered it at Notre Dame, too. 
Besides, people will think you are a totalitarian if you try to restrict what they most cherish, even if otherwise you're completely anarchist. When she was little, I was far more indul­gent with my niece than her parents were -except when it came to candy. My niece really loved candy, so much so that she'd sometimes sit and meditate about it, and I tried to keep her away from it. Naturally, she considered me much meaner and stricter than her parents, no matter how much I allowed or encouraged her to do things her parents would not tolerate. Replace my niece with liberals and candy with abortion, and me with conservatives, and you understand why liberals see cons(~r­vatives as totalitarians. I do not wish to imply that liberals actually like abortion the way my niece liked candy; I would have to say, sadly, that based on my observation of · American politics over the past decade, abortion on demand is what's most important to most of the far Left. 
We have all seen those funny sur­veys showing how dangerously igno­rant Americans are, even (especial­ly?) college students-you know, 93 percent can't find Canada on a map, or something like that. But ignorance about facts and figures, like how many branches of government we have, is one thing. You can always just look that stuff up. Gross misun­derstanding of important phenomena like totalitarianism is something else. For instance, isn't it a common idea that the enemy of communism was capitalism'? As if the main right denied those tens of millions of poor souls crushed under the hammer and sickle -whether by Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Castro, Kim, or other monsters -was the right to own a business. 
It is my hope that liberal fascism will begin the long process of educat­ing Americans about the true nature of one of history's most awful move­ments, and the deep connections between it and more modern ideolo­gies. I do not mind if the angry Left continues invoking their conserva­tive-means-Nazi mantra, since it shows their own viciousness and their own ignorance. But I do hope conservatives will get better at answering it. Reading Jonah's book would be a start.

Dissecting the Democratic primary 
In the Democratic presidential race, after analyzing voter trends in South Carolina, the 22 states during Super Duper Tuesday, and last weekend's contests, one thing is perfectly clear-winning depends on slicing bits of support away from the opponent. 
Analysts commonly agree that both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are likely to remain neck-and-neck in the race well beyond March. The competition is between the sterling Clinton brand and the stimulating Obama movement. Both attract new voters to the process. Both draw equally impressive support across the nation as evidenced by the mere dif­ference of only 50,000 votes from among nearly 15 million cast a week ago. 
Yet each week brings new uncer­tainty. The demographics are so unique from state to state that the Clinton and Obama campaigns have learned how to peel off enough voters in select categories to win, but have yet to change their steady state-by-state trends. So long as Latinos support Clinton by 65 percent and African-Americans support Obama by 80 percent, both candidates will need to whittle at the edges of other support groups like women, men, union households, the well-educated or income categories in the various state primaries. 
Overall, the campaigns can best be shaded to indicate their pockets of support-Obama has his African-· American constituency with younger voters, the wealthy, highly educated liberals (the upscale elite Starbucks or McGovern/Kennedy wing of the party) who push environ­mental initiatives. Clinton, on the other hand, draws from a different spectrum with her Hispanic constituency and

older, less educated, union members and working class voters. Note that whenever either candidate can deny the other of the average of support in any of these constituen­cies, the primary election will tilt. 
It is also important to note that a primary election and a caucus are completely different creatures. Caucuses are community political theater held within full view of the public during a quite limited time frame. They restrict attendance to those who can venture out after routine work hours on a particular evening, sometimes during snow and ice storms. Participants enthusiastically display their support openly with their neighbors. That structure favors Obama. 
Primaries, however, are better indicators of general elec­tion support since voters privately indicate their choices during an ali-day time period-just like in th~oJ general elec­tion. They too can favor Obama ifthe electorate is signifi­cantly comprised with one of his core constituencies, such as African-Americans in Georgia and South Carolina. Possibly, the most telling primary results to study thus far are ones in which ethnic minorities more resembled the national average -or where one minority group equals the other -such as the Northeast primary splits in Massachusetts and Connecticut, or further west with the trio of Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee. 
How did Clinton win by 15 percentage points in the open Massachusetts primary where the governor and both U.S. senators opposed her? Obama was devoid of his core con­stituency with only 6 percent of African-Americans in the voter pool. Clinton won the women's vote by more than a two-to-one margin while nearly splitting the men's vote, losing by only one point. She also carried Obama's signa­ture strongholds, like the 18-to-24 year-old vote by nearly 20 points and upper-income voters by 10 points. 
Next door in the closed Connecticut contest, however, Obama edged Clinton by four points overall from among only Democrats. He chipped away at the Clinton core by 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Bishops take 
action 

The local shepherd of the Roman Catholic Church, Fort Wayne-South Bend Bishop John D'Arcy, recently informed University President Father John Jenkins that a theologi­cal seminar for Catholic bishops scheduled for Notre Dame has now been moved to the convent of the Sisters of St. Francis in Mishawaka. The reason for this change in venue is an embarrassment and a collective shame for the students and graduates of the University. 
There is a crucial moral point that our local bishop and his colleagues want "the culture" to understand about this decision by Jenkins. And moving the venue away from Notre Dame is certainly a timely and an effective way to create such a teaching moment. 
Sponsoring a public debate on the efficacy of abortion is a fine idea, and Notre Dame should encourage such expression on campus, even when certain pro-abortion viewpoints contradict Catholic teaching. But allowing its facilities to be used for performing abortions would be "acting" in a way that the Catholic Church condemns as unacceptable. To be sure, Jenkins, the University staff, and its board and trustees would never allow this to happen. 
Similarly, sponsoring a debate on the merits of the alco­hol-fueled seduction of a 16-year-old girl by a 24-year-old woman (described in the play as resulting in "salvation" and "a kind of heaven") seems compatible with academic freedom even at a Catholic university like Notre Dame. But allowing the facilities of Notre Dame to be used for the production of simulating sex acts and orgasms on stage and presenting for an audience "graphic descriptions of homosexual, extramarital heterosexual, and auto-erotic experiences" (Jenkins spoke these words during his Jan. 23, 2006 address to the faculty) is not just speaking against Catholic teaching, it is acting against Catholic teaching. 
And herein lies the big difference! John D'Arcy and his fellow bishops get it. Thank God they decided to do some­thing about it. Jenkins needs to seriously reconsider his mistake and cancel the March 26-28 production of "The Vagina Monologues" at Notre Dame. Perhaps this might give the University, its students and alumni reason to be proud again that our university is indeed a partner with the local and universal Catholic Church who welcomes the debate but abhors the conduct.

winning 57 percent of white men and 53 percent of Latinos. In this contest African-Americans and Latinos both equaled less than 10 percent. What makes Connecticut unique is the elite status of the voters, with nearly 80 percent college educated and three-quarters of the voters with above average incomes--strongholds of Obama. 
In Missouri, where Obama edged Clinton by one percent­age point, Clinton won 100 of 115 counties, yet lost the state. She carried white men (55 percent) and white women (59 percent), but Obama reached his threshold for winning a state by garnering 41 percent of white men. While the Obama campaign touts that their average for white men across the board is 41 percent, the statistic is skewed by his Illinois landslide and large upscale liberal support in coastal states like New York and California. His win in Missouri, with a near average pool of 20 percent African-American votes concentrated in the large cities, depended upon successfully slicing away Clinton's white male support. 
Missouri, Massachusetts and Connecticut netted Clinton 13 delegates even though Obama won two of those three contests. As Obama currently enjoys a streak of wins in smaller and middle-sized states, the coming months loom with Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania. Clinton can quickly counter his streak in those large states unless Obama slices into her core constituencies. The nomination may depend upon who has the sharper slicing technique.

'Monologues' promote 
non-violence 
Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge that this response to Christina Holmstrom's letter regard­ing "The Vagina Monologues" ('"Monologues' encourage mistreatment of women," Feb. 10) is not necessarily a refutation of her ideas, but an expres­sion of an alternate perspective regarding Eve Ensler's play. 
Holmstrom references the V-Day slogan and agrees that "violence again;>t women should be stopped." "The Vagina Monologues" initiate conversation every year about methods in achieving this exact goal. In contributing her valuable opinion about how best to stop violence against women, Holmstrom has begun this process at Notre Dame this year, and the tenta­tive upcoming production of the play will initiate even more conversation. 
In its portrayal of real women's experiences, "The Vagina Monologues" document the significance of sexuality as a part of womanhood. The women who speak of their positive sexual experiences in the play are examples of women as sexual beings, not sexual objects, as Holmstrom suggests. "The Vagina Monologues" do not condone the perception of women as sexual objects. Monologues such as "My Vagina Was My Village," in which a number of Bosnian women recount their stories regarding rape as a war tactic, and "Crooked Braid," an account of the prominence of domestic abuse in Native American communities, clearly discourage the per­spective of women as simply "walking vaginas." I am unable to see how these monologues encourage women to "treat themselves as sex objects." 
As a two-time audience member, I know that Notre Dame's productions of "The Vagina Monologues" conclude each year with the monologue entitled "I Was There In The Room," an account of Eve Ensler's emotional experience in watching her daughter-in­law give birth. The beauty of this marital moment is a facet of sexuality that every Catholic can embrace. 
"The Vagina Monologues" value all women's sexu­ality and allow each audience member to decide what is best for herself. The play does not encourage sex, but discourages violence against women, no matter how sexually active they are. These accounts are relevant to every woman and man, regardless of her or his religious beliefs. As a worldwide communi­ty, we should be concerned with every woman's experience with sexual violence, not just those who practice Catholicism. I hope all those who participate in this discussion have had the fortune of seeing "The Vagina Monologues," and that those who have not will attend a production on Notre Dame's campus, if it is approved to take place, at the end of March.

Cheer with class 
I strongly support Mike Coffey's remarks ("Reconsider 'suck it' cheer," Feb. 10) regarding recent off-color cheers at athletic contests. I would urge the student body to take a larger view of this question and eliminate cheers, such as "Suck it." 
First, it reflects badly on Our Lady's University. Maybe other schools exhibit such behavior, but we have always aspired to be different. 
Secondly, please consider the entire Notre Dame family, which encompasses a universe much larger than just the student body. Members of that family cherish and support their school and enjoy attending athletic contests and bringing their friends and fami­lies. Notre Dame sports events should be for all the Notre Dame family and not flaunt anything that we cannot feel comfortable exposing to our children and grandchildren. 
Often, visiting fans comment on how well they are treated with hospitality on the Notre Dame campus. Let this high-class spirit continue. Let's give our teams a great home field advantage in a classy way.

By JAMES COSTA Scene Writer 
In this ever-burgeoning age of tech­nological innovation and advancement, several popular musicians have turned to the Web, namely super popular video-sharing service YouTube.com, to share a few of the more obscure ele­ments of their personal lives and artistry. One singer-songwriter with a particularly impressive YouTube account is the famously prolific Cardinals front man, Ryan Adams. 
Adams' account, titled "Horion74," provides a fascinating insight into just how weirdly talented and excited the guy is. With more than 30 videos avail­able, the Jacksonville, N.C., native offers everything from acoustic songs lilmed in his New York City bedroom to tours of the Ilollywood Hills with none other than Mandy Moore, who seems adorably confused by Adams' assertion that Los Angeles was originally founded by pirates and spaceships. 
One of the more brilliant moments found within the account Horion 7 4 is Adams' acoustic version of the song "Everybody Knows" off of the Cardinals' most recent record "Easy Tiger." Clearly engaged in a subtle but playful mockery of the thousands of YouTube users who film themselves covering (usually quite badly) famous songs in the privacy of their bedrooms and basements, Adams works through a rather butchered version of his own song as if he were just an average guy with a guitar, a video camera and a YouTube account trying to emulate himself. It's restrained comic brilliance. 
A lot of the movies are weird and eccentric, to say the least. Most have a decidedly low-budget feel. It's likely that all were made only with the help of invaluable tools available to Adams on his Apple iBook -Garage Band and iMovie. Yet he uses the tools he's got to achieve a kitschy but endearing effect, showing how his rock star life is filled with the same bizarre and peculiar thoughts and impulses that the every­day artsy weirdo experiences. 

Of course, Adams could not avoid the subjects of heartbreak and emotional misery that dominate most of his offi­cial CD releases. A number of the videos are focused on his recent breakup with the redheaded Banana Republic model and writer Jessica Joffe. 
Apparently, the whole breakup didn't go well, and Joffe blocked Adams' cell phone and e-mail. In an effort to show her how sad he was, he started the YouTube account and loaded the video "Sad Days." Mainly just a slideshow of pictures of Jessica backed by sad music, the video was quickly taken down because "it was just too painful," as Adams wrote in the site's artist information area. 
However, Adams quickly came up with a few new sad ideas and posted them. These videos, titled "Like Yesterday," ''I'm a Sad Person," and "Broken Arrow" hit at the same emo­tional core as did "Sad Days." This is especially true in "Like Yesterday," where he sings, "With a belly full of sleeping pills I with a little less pain I oh it doesn't feel like yesterday." The songs are reminiscent of the darkest moments Adams has shown us before on albums like "Heartbreaker," "Love is Hell," and "29." So for those who enjoy getting their heart all ripped up by Ryan's sadness, these songs are for you. 
Much of the material is quirky and odd. Yet it's refreshing to get a glimpse into the life of an artist that hasn't been already filtered by record companies and the media. So check it out, it's a great mix of some pretty stark sadness mixed with bizarre home video fun.

NBA 
Injured Shaq practices for first time with Suns 
Associated Press 
PIIOENIX -Shaquille O'Neal practiced with the Phoenix Suns for the first time Monday, showing no sign of the hip injury that has sidelined him since Jan. 21. 
"It was different. It was very intense," he said after the one­hour workout. "I learned a lot. Now I can see why they can go at the pace they play at. When you just do short bursts like this, then you can save it all for the game." 
Just when he will play in a game remained undecided. 
"I haven't done anything in a month, but I'm in pretty good shape," O'Neal said. "It will probably take me a few more days to get in tune. The good thing about these guys here is they told me when I'm comfort­able, when I'm one-thousand percent, then I can join them." 
Phoenix has two games before the All-Star break -at Golden State on Wednesday night and at home against Dallas on Thursday. The first game after the break is at home against Shaq's old team, the Los Angeles Lakers, his for­mer coach Phil Jackson and his old teammate Kobe Bryant. 
"I think it's going to take a lit­tle bit," coach Mike D'Antoni said. "It's going to be an adjust­ment for our guys and for him. It's hard to think and play bas­ketball at the same time. Right now, he's got to think where he's going to go and all that. But it's going to be good chem­istry and it's going to change things up, hopefully for the bet­ter." 
D'Antoni said the Suns will "not rush him back for any rea­son." The coach said he will meet with O'Neal and trainer Aaron Nelson after Tuesday's practice to map out plans. 
Phoenix is 2-1 since the trade last Wednesday that brought O'Neal from the Miami Heat for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks. The Suns have the con­ference's best record at 36-15 but only 5? games separate the top nine teams in the West. 
O'Neal injured his hip diving for a loose ball against Utah on Dec. 22. He returned Jan. 16 but was sidelined again five days later. An MRI showed inflammation in the left hip, shutting him down from all basketball activity. 
In going ahead with the trade, the Suns were confident their staff would be able to get O'Neal in playing condition. 
"The hip's feeling pretty good, better than it's felt in a while," O'Neal said. "''m used to just getting injections and going back out there. They told me they have their style, and they want me to stick with it." 
O'Neal said he needs to get back in basketball shape and has to be comfortable with playmaker Steve Nash in a sys­tem far different from the one used by Pat Riley in Miami. 
''I'm not going to rush any­thing because this is already a fine-tuned machine, and any kink could throw it off," O'Neal said. "I don't want to be the negative kink. I want to step in like I've been with this team the last three years. I have to make sure that everything's right." 
He's been impressed by much of what he's seen, particularly the ability of Amare Stoudemire, named Western Conference player of the week on Monday. 


"I didn't know he was that good," O'Neal said. "I really didn't." 
O'Neal's arrival will allow Stoudemire to move to his more natural power forward posi­tion. 
"I think it makes my job a lit­tle easier," Stoudemire said. "If you look at me standing beside him I look more like a point guard than a center." 
The entire Phoenix team seemed energized by O'Neal's presence. 
"Most practices you don't want to be out there," Grant

Hill said, "but today everybody wanted to be out there and look forward to making it work. That's going to be the chal­lenge. That's going to be the fun part." 
O'Neal does not expect to be the star. 
''I'm a historian of the game, so I understand that on this team I'm probably a big role player, and I have no problem with that," O'Neal said. "I did my thing in my prime, and it's Amare's prime right now. I think it's my job to get him to the next level. Toward the end of my career, I have no problem coming here and just fitting in and just helping these guys get to the next level." 
He compares his job to the role of an aging Kareem Abdul­Jabbar on the "Showtime" Lakers teams of Magic Johnson and James Worthy. 
"Kareem was fortunate enough to have those style of players around him toward the end of his career, and I sort of feel like him now," O'Neal said. ''I'm no idiot. I'm not going to come in here trying to take over and take 30 shots. I'm going to fit in very nicely ­rebound, outlet to Steve, get some easy buckets, play some defense. That's all we need."

"He's out until after the All­Star break," Rivers said after the Celtics beat the San Antonio Spurs 98-90 to improve to 5-2 since Garnett was injured. 
Garnett was averaging 19.2 points and 9.9 rebounds per game before being sidelined two weeks ago after straining a stomach muscle on Jan. 25 against the Timberwolves. He will be his fourth All-Star appearance. 
The Pistons forward will have to alter his vacation plans after being selected to replace Garnett in the game. 
"This time I'll go for the kids," Wallace said to the Detroit Free Press. "I guess once I get older or out of the game, they can look back on it and check it out."

The No. 21 men traveled to 
Northern Illinois and DeKalb, Ill., 
last weekend fiJr their first of two 
eonfimmce play days. In a eonfer­
ence fi~aturing the national cham­
pions from each of the past thme 
years, the Irish had their work cut 
out fiJr them. 
The opening match was against last year's national runner-up No. 4 Lakeland. While the Irish knpt pace with the powerhouse for the majority of the match. they were unable to brnak ahead and grab a victory. Despite the strong outside hitting of Dan Zibton. the Irish began the day with a loss in straight sets, 21-25 and 1 S-25. 
Immediately after the loss to Lakeland. Notrn Dame was pitted Illinois State. In the first set, start­ing Irish middle Tim Goldsmith sufl'ered a groin injury that sent him to the lmnch fiJr the rest of the day, but junior Jason Gott was able to fill in and carry the load. Notm Dame dominated the young Illinois State team in straight sets. 25-1 <J and 25-20. 
The Irish then faced Wisconsin­Milwaukee and current No. 1 and two-time defending national champions Wisconsin-Oshkosh in consecutive matches. The Irish came out strong against UW­Milwaukee, but its quiek offense kept Notre Dame on iL'i heels. The Irish lost the first game, but ral­lied back in the second, winning 25-22. A small lapse caused the Irish to fall behind in the third, but they rebounded with a 15-11 win 
The Irish were greatly tested against the Titans. Notre Dame started with two straight aces, but struggled the rest of the match. 
UW-Oshkosh controlled the 
match, handing Notre Dame its 
second loss of the day, 25-22, 25­

In order to finish above .500, 
the Irish needed to dose out the 
day with consecutive victories 
against Ball State and Iowa State.

Irish succeeded and beat Ball 
State in consecutive sets, 25-18 
and 25-21. 
In its sixth and final mateh against Iowa State, Notre Dame was eyeing a respectable finish. Behind sophomore Arthur Kinsey's defense and Ted Grossestreuer's outside hitting, the Irish gained an early lead. The Cyclones eaught firo and pro­ceednd to take the lead and dose out a first game win. With their baeks against the wall, the Irish found the intensity they needed and pushed baek against ISU.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. -Nicky Anosike sank two free throws with two-tenths of a second left and No. 1 Tennessee ral­lied to beat No. 5 Rutgers 59­58 on Monday night in a rematch of last season's national championship game. 
Trailing 5S-57, Anosike grabbed an offensive rebound and was grabbed by Kia Vaughn from behind. Unclear whether the foul had come before time expired, the Hutgers beneh began to cele­brate, but officials reviewed the play and determined that the foul had been committed just before the buzzer. 
Television replays showed the game clock seemed to pause as Anosike came down with the ball and two-tenths remained on the elock, lead­ing to the controversial fin­ish. 
Anosike eamly stepped up and hit the two free throws to seal the victory. 
"It's unfortunate that those kinds of things happen," Rutgers coach C. Vivian Stringer said. ''I'm getting used to it now." 
Candace Parker had 27 
points and 10 rebounds, and Angie Bjorklund addnd 13. 
Epiphanny Prince had 21 points for Hutgers, and Essenen Carson added IS. 
The Lady Vols (22-1) enternd the second half with a 34-23 lead af'ter the Scarlet Knights (19-4) made only two field goals and two free throws in the 11 minutes before the half. 
The deficit was Hutgers' largnst of the snason. They had trailed by 10 to both Connecticut and Maryland before coming back to win both games. 
Tennessee eoaeh Pat Summitt warned her team at halftime that it <:ould happen again. 
"Hutgers is a second half team, all you have to do is look at all their comebacks this ynar," she said. 
But Tennessee went cold after the break, making only one shot from the field -a 3­pointer from Angie Bjorklund -in the first 14 minutes. 
Hutgers took a 39-3S lead on a Hashidat .Junaid layup with 10:08 to go. Vaughn's putback basket put the Scarlet Knights up 56-51 with 1:35.

'It's showtime' for Clemens 
But Pettitte, two others won't testify in Wednesday's Mitchell Report session 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Roger Clemens and his accuser, Brian McNamee, will be the main witnesses at a House hearing on the Mitchell Report after New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte and two others were dropped Monday night. 
Former Clemens teammate Chuck Knoblauch and con­victed steroids dealer Kirk Radomski also were dropped from the witness list for Wednesday's public session. One new witness was added Monday night: a lawyer who worked with former Senate majority leader George Mitchell to produce December's report on drugs in baseball. 
But all attention will be focused on Clemens, a seven­time Cy Young Award win­ner, and McNamee, his for­mer personal trainer, who alleged he injected the pitch­er with performance­enhancing drugs. 
"I guess it's showtime, isn't it?" Clemens' lead lawyer, Rusty Hardin, said in a tele­phone interview. 
Earl Ward, McNamee's lead lawyer, declined to com­ment on the changes. 
McNamee said in the Mitchell Report that he injected Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone at least 16 times in 1998, 2000 and 2001. Clemens' denials of those allegations drew the atten­tion of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
McNamee also accused Pettitte of using HGH ­something Pettitte acknowl­edged he did do for two days in 2002 to deal with an elbow injury. Before Pettitte spoke to committee lawyers under oath last week, Ward said he thought Pettitte would tell Congress he dis­cussed HGH with Clemens between the 2001 and 2002 seasons. 
With Monday's decision, 
Pettitte was spared the potentially difficult situation of having to deliver public testimony that could hurt the position of Clemens, a friend, past teammate and former workout partner. Radomski has said he had no direct contact with Clemens, and Knoblauch's knowledge in the matter appeared to be peripheral. 
Pettitte gave a sworn depo­sition last Monday, followed the next day by Clemens, and McNamee later in the week. Knoblauch, a former major leaguer who was a Yankees teammate of Clemens and Pettitte, was interviewed by committee staff last month, while Radomski had been sched­uled for a pre-hearing meet­
ing  with  the  committee  
Tuesday.  
All five  originally  were  

invited to testify Wednesday. 
"Mr. Knoblauch and Mr. Pettitte answered all the Committee's questions and their testimony at the hear­ing is not needed," commit­tee chairman Henry Waxman and ranking Republican Tom Davis said in a statement. "Mr. Clemens and Mr. McNamee have also cooper­ated with the Committee in its investigation." 
Following Pettitte's deposi­tion, his lawyers asked the committee to excuse him from the hearing, a person familiar with the talks said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the nego­tiations weren't made public. 
Pettitte's request to be excused was first reported by The New York Times on its Web site. 
Pettitte's attorney, Jay Reisinger, declined to com­ment ·after the announce­ment, while a lawyer for Radomski did not immedi­ately return a phone mes­.sage left at his office Monday night. 
''I'm not disappointed," said Knoblauch's attorney, Diana Marshall. "I know Chuck is not disappointed." 
The new witness is Charles Scheeler, a partner with Mitchell's law firm, DLA Piper. According to the firm's Web site, Scheeler mainly works in commercial litiga­tion and white collar crimi­nal defense. 
Asked about Scheeler's addition, Hardin said: "It's interesting. I look forward to hearing what he has to say." 
Clemens' camp disputes several elements of the Mitchell Report's sections about him. Clemens said he repeated under oath during his closed-door deposition what he previously had said in various settings publicly: "I've never used steroids or growth hormone." 
McNamee, for his part, arrived for his deposition with color photos of what his side says is evidence -and what Clemens' lawyers have called "manufactured" ­that was turned over to the Justice Department last month. McNamee's lawyers say the items include used needles saved for several years and that, when tested, they will prove Clemens used performance-enhancing drugs. 
While McNamee has been quiet, not speaking a word to reporters after his deposi­tion, Clemens has been criss­crossing Capitol Hill, speak­ing with nearly half of the members of the committee on a two-day tour last week. The 45-year-old pitcher planned to meet with more lawmakers Tuesday, a day before he testifies under oath at the hearing. 
Pettitte was supposed to be there, too. Now the left-ban­der is free to get ready to head to spring training. Yankees pitchers and catch­ers are to report Thursday. 
"Every witness should make the decision that's best for them," Hardin said . "Roger plans to be there and to answer every question fully and truthfully. Whatever anybody else did, that's their deal."

Asked Saturday whether he'd been contacted by Specter's office ur by the NFL, Walsh smiled and said, "I really can't answer that." 
Nor would Walsh say if he was under a gag order from his attor­neys, even though that seems obvious. On Wedi,lesday, NFL com­missioner Roger Goodell men­tioned that his staff was talking with Walsh's representatives, try­ing to gauge whether Walsh had any new information to offer and if Walsh was free to talk to the league. 
Does he have info? Is he free to talk? 
"I can't comment on anything," Walsh replied. "''m really sorry, but I can't." 
Goodell reiterated at a Pro Bowl practice this week that the case against the Patriots is not closed if any more information is uncov­ered about the team videotaping opposing coaches' signals. The

and we pursued some of them and we continue that. From Day 1, I said ifwe feel there is new information that's inconsistent with what we've been told [by the Patriots], I reserve the right to reopen it." 
Does Walsh expect that to hap­pen? 
A smile, and silence. 
Is he amused by all the ques­tions being raised, or all the phone calls by the media trying to track him down? 
"Don't think I can comment on that," he said. 
Walsh did ask a reporter how long he would be in Maui, whether he was in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl, and where the reporter · was staying. He nodded approval when told which hotel was media headquarters. 
"''ve been there," he said. "Very nice place." 
As is the Kaanapali course, which will host the Wendy's Champions Skins Game Three­Tour challenge later this month featuring Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Gary Player, Jay Haas, Loren Roberts, Fuzzy Zoeller and Peter Jacobsen. It's also the home course for the Golf Channel show "Big Break." 
Several times, Walsh answered the pro shop phone, but only to confirm tee times or give informa­tion about the resort. Asked how many phone messages he'd received in the last week, he once again smiled -silently. 
According to his bio on the Kaanapali Golf Web site, Walsh worked in Arena Football, for seven years with the Patriots, who won two Super Bowls in that span, and one year in NFL Europa. . 
He also trained with the U.S. Bobsled team. None of that was fodder for con­versation Saturday, either. 
Walsh was rumored to have attended last Sunday's Super Bowl, but offered no information on that. 
A<> for his future -other than giving golf lessons and playing when he gets the chance -Walsh wasn't about to speculate. 
"Do you expect to hear from Congress or the NFL or your lawyers anytime soon?" he was asked. 
"Can't say," he replied before asking tor the reporter's business card. "I have to get back to work. Thanks for coming out. I hope you enjoy Maui and the Pro Bowl."

season, and we're looking for­ward to having her back and ready to go rwxt season," she said. 
"I just cringed," junior guard Lindsay Schrader, who missed all of last s1mson aft1~r tearing her ACL, said Sunday of Peters' injury. 
Freshman forward Becca Bruszewski said she thought the play was a freak occur­rence. not the result of any con­taet with another player. 
"It just kind of looked like she went to cut back and just went down," said Bruszewski, who was standing near Peters when she fell. 
MeGraw said losing Peters will change the team's strategy at times. 
"It changes a little bit of what we do. I think we'll probably go smaller at times," McGraw said Sunday. "And the way Becca's playing, I'm very confident in her eoming in and doing a lot of good things. It ehangos the press a little bit." 
Poters was the driving foree behind Notre Dame's full-court, man-to-man press, using her !wight and long arm·s to disrupt opposing oiTenses. McGraw said thn prnss is bneoming loss o!Tec­tive for Notrn Dame, however. 
"At this point in the season, to am~. have f~gu.red out.. 1~ur press, she S<lld Sunday. 1 he half-court defense was really a lot better than our press tonight. We'll be able to get a good ganw plan without her." McCraw looked at the injury as an opportunity for bench 
players to increase their roles. 
"Part of the growing proeess in this game, and in life, is deal­ing with obstaeles that arc put in your path," McGraw said in the release. "This presents an opportunity for some of our other players to step in and contribute down the streteh in the Big East conference season and I believe they will passion­ately embrace that ehallenge and take advantage of it." 
The likely candidates, McGraw said Sunday, are Bruszewski and senior center Melissa D'Amico. 
"It's a great opportunity for [Bruszewski I to move to the perimeter a little bit more," McGraw said. "And it's a great opportunity for [D'Amico], and [she I has been waiting for her opportunity patiently since the beginning of the year." 
D'Amico, who averaged 20.4 minutes per game and eight points per game last season, averages 9.4 minutes per game and 3.3 points per game this season. The 6-foot-5 center has only started 10 games this sea­son after starting 29 of Notre Dame's 32 games last season. 
Bruszewski was optimistic about the prospect of inereased playing time, and McGraw was confident in Bruszewski's abili­ties to eontribute. 
"She gets a body on somebody and she does a good job of box­ing out," McGraw said Sunday. "[Panthers center Marcedes] Walker was hurting us early, we weren't rebounding and I felt like she was the one that could come in and make a differ­ence."
