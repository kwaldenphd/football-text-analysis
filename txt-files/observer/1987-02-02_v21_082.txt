Irish topple No. 1 Tar Heels 
Rivers, Voce key 60-58 comeback 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
Plain and simple, Notre Dame's 60-58 victory over number-one North Carolina Sunday was a Notre Dame Moment. It was one of those games that goes from the sports pages to the his­tory books. 
The Irish, down as many as 16 in the first half, fought and scrapped their way to victory. David Rivers' jumper from inside the foul line put the Irish ahead to stay with 1 :06 left to play, and then the Irish hung on despite the Tar Heels and their own fans.

Unfortunate incidents mar the finish of a great victory 
WOW! 
It was a victory worth savoring. Or was it? 
Three incidents occurred yesterday that took away some of the satisfaction out of Notre Dame's incredible win over number--one ranked North Carolina. To me, when a few stu­dents shouted a racial slur at an opponent, threw objects at the referees and tossed food around the dining halls, they embarrassed the Notre Dame student body. 
The first incident happened before the game even began. Flyers distributed around the stu­dent section instructed the fans to shout a phrase upon the introduction of each of Carolina's starting line--up. So, when the second player was announced, he was welcomed with the shouts of "Sit down, white boy!" 
My heart sank when l heard it. I hoped to God that the TV audience had not picked it up back home. 
What some would consider to be an innocent remark was, in fact, an embarrassment to the school. One must ask why it was necessary to taunt an opponent by making reference to the color of his skin. 
What was meant by "Sit down, white boy?" I can only take it to mean that only blacks are fit to play basketball and that one's skin color determines success in that sport. Furthermore, anyone from the South could tell you how loaded the term, "boy" is when talking about race. 
To whoever authored the flyers, I would like to know why race had to be injected into good, clean athletic entertainment. Frankly, when I watch basketball, I don't care whether the players are black or white, I go to see good basketball. It's obvious that the creators of the the flyer had something else in mind. It's also obvious that Minority Awareness Week held on campus just last week had no effect on student attitudes concerning racial issues. 
The second incident could have lost the game for the Irish. It really came home to me how many idiots attend this school when I saw a torrent of blue and gold placards descending on the court. Of course they knew it would stop the game. Of course they knew it would in­furiate Digger. But they did it anyway. 
No, in the end the technical foul didn't hurt us. But, imagine if just one Notre Dame field goal had been erased from the scoreboard. It could have happened. 
The third disappointing incident has hap­pened before and, I suppose, will happen again. What seems like harmless fun turned into a dangerous game of glass flying in all directions. The food fight that occurred in B-section of

North Dining hall left glass scattered over a large area of the floor. Is it any wonder that the residents of South Bend, like those who live in the Northeast Neighborhood, think of us as kids rather than adults? 
Let me be clear: I think that a general celebration was definitely in order yesterday. The team and the school deserved it. But I wonder whether many of us have too much pent up emotions waiting to burst into immature and destructive behavior. Celebrating and showing school solidarity is great --until someone gets hurt. The point is, these seemingly minor ac­tions have real and unintended consequences. At the very best, these students who shouted a  racial slur didn't know what they were saying --in which case they came off as unthinking. At worst, they knew exactly what they were saying --a proposition that I won't even consider. In any case, Notre Dame's student body ends up looking bad. For a moment, just a short mo­ment, one could catch a glimpse of who some of the students are who attend Notre Dame. 
The events I noticed Sunday don't dampen the exhilaration that I felt as the clock ran out and Notre Dame was on top. An ND moment had occurred. 
It was the kind of Notre Dame moment that I wouldn't mind repeating next time --but with a few less idiots in attendance.

MANILA, Philippines Filipinos cast ballots today to approve or disapprove a new constitution. The voting was seen as a crucial test of strength for President Corazon Aquino's 11-month-old admin­istration. 
Small explosions within 20 minutes occurred at three loca­tions in Manila the night before the plebiscite, but no one was injured, private radio station DZRH said.

Dooley winner tells of hardships 
By ERIC M. BERGAMO 
Staff Reporter 
For 1987 Tom Dooley Award winner Michael Novell, working in the Philippines as director of the Save Our Children program and as a Peace Corps volunteer have been difficult but rewarding ex­periences. 
Novell spoke about these ex­periences Friday afternoon at the Center for Social Concerns. 
"It was a very intense period of my life. My wife was working with me and it was very, very hard. The things you read about, the tortures, the people being abused were true. A lot of horrible things hap­pened." 
Novell, a 1975 graduate of Notre Dame, joined the Peace Corps after his graduation and worked for three years in the Phillipines. He spent most of that time working at a rural health unit that served over 29,000 people. 
"Conditions there are quite different from what you would find in developed countries. One time for five months there were only two of us there: myself and a sanitation ex­pert," Novell said. 
Despite the hardships of working in an underdeveloped an~'l, Novell found the work rewarding. 
"It was a good experience for me because during that time I made the decision to stay in the field of what we would call community development." 
Novell returned to the United States for graduate studies in public health at UCLA. It was during this time that he joined Save The Children. His first as­signment took him to Southeast Asia where he worked for two and a half years in the refugee program. Novell worked for six months as a nutrition program manager. He eventually be­came director of the program which included a language and cultural orientation program for those refugees who would be migrating to the United States. 
Novell returned to the Phil­lipines five years ago to start a new project in community de­velopment. His associates are currently working with three sites: one in a lowland rice farming area; one in a moun­tain area with an ethnic minority group; and one that is being started in Manila. 
Some of the goals of commu­nity development in these areas are "trying to decrease the death rate in terms of mal­nutrition. We have a commu­nity health workers program where you find someone who has basic reading and writing skills and someone who is will­ing to put in the time to teach them some low-level, simple areas of health," Novell said. 
"We're trying to increase rice production through the use of agricultural credit, giving a commodity loan. We work through farmer's aides; these are farmers who have a sixth grade or high school education and what they do is they act as a middle man with our staff," he said. 
The Save The Children pro­gram also works with women in expanding their role in the community, Novell said. 
"What we are trying to do is to improve the lives of children and their families and the com­munities in which they live through community self-help projects," he said. 
Save The Children depends mostly on nationals to run their programs in over 46 countries worldwide. 
Future plans for Save The Children are to locate new sites for community development in the countries that they are already in. Save The Children is also conducting extensive refugee assistance programs in Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan. 
Novell said that Notre Dame influenced his going into com­munity service and helping other people. 
"One of the things I left with, it wasn't clearly imprinted in my head, but I had this feeling that it was extremely impor­tant to keep thinking what it meant to be a part of the com­munity and a member of a group," Novell said. 
"Look at the alumni group, that's a community, that's a group of people working to­gether. The more I thought about it, the more I saw how it pertained to everything you do in life." said Novell. 
Novell said he was "surprised" at being given the Tom Dooley Award. 
"I haven't had contact with the University for so long."

Congress ready to override Reagan's water bill veto 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Reagan faces a major spending defeat this week if Congress, as expected, overrides his second veto in three months of popular $20 billion clean-water legislation. 
Nobody, least of all the pres­ident, will be surprised by the pending House and Senate votes over an aid-to-the-states issue that Reagan says is the "first great battle of the (budget) deficit in the 100th Congress." 
"I know this veto is going to be overridden," he said Friday at a ceremony that contrasted markedly with the quiet pocket-veto he used last Nov. 6 to scuttle an identical bill after Congress had left town and was unable to take override votes. 
There is one element of suspense this week on Capitol Hill: Will the House follow the lead of the Senate and reject a proposal to add $12,100 to the annual $77,400 congressional salary? 
Unless the House rejects them by midnight Tuesday, the raises, recommended by Reagan, are automatic for law­makers, federal judges, the Cabinet and top-level bureaucrats. The House won't start hearings on the issue until Monday, and the question isn't yet on the floor debate agenda.

UAWsigns new contract with Deere 
Associated Press 
MOLINE, Ill. -United Auto Workers union members representing more than 12,000 workers in six states on Sunday approved a contract with Deere & Co., ending a five­month work stoppage, the union said. 
Members of 14 locals at 13 idled facilities, most in Iowa and Illinois, voted more than 75 percent in favor of the pact, said UAW Vice President Bill Casstevens. 
He did not provide vote totals on the contract, which is to run through Sept. 30, 1988. At least one local voted against it. 
The contract, which con­cludes the longest work stop­page ever at the farm­equipment company, includes job security provisions but no immediate wage increase, said union spokesman Karl Man­tyla. 
Deere has committed $14.4 million to establish a "protected employee group" similar to one established last year in a contract with Peoria­based Caterpillar Inc., said Mantyla.

Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH United Steelworkers members, ending a six-month work stoppage at USX Corp. plants, begin re­turning to work today under a newly ratified contract that swaps pay concessions for job security. 
After a day of counting bal­lots, union officials announced late Saturday that their mem­bers had ratified the four-year contract by a vote of 19,621 to 4,045. 
The industry's longest work 
stoppage  ended  on  its  184th  
day.  
"We're  pleased  that  our  

employees have ratified the contract," said David Roderick, chairman of the na­tion's largest steelmaker. "Now we can get about the business of supplying the cus­tomers." 
But owing to poor business conditions that forced USX, formerly U.S. Steel, and five major competitors before it to negotiate labor concessions, work at 25 USX plants in nine states will resume only as or­ders warrant. 
"It will not be an immediate recall of all the people," said James McGeehan, chief union negotiator. 
Workers were to be called for orientation briefings Monday and production would resume within several weeks at the company's biggest operations, the Gary Works in Indiana, the Mon Valley Works near Pit­tsburgh, the Fairless Hills Works near Philadelphia, the Lorain Works in Ohio, and the South Works at Chicago, said USX spokesman Thomas Far­rell. 
Production at the Fairfield Works near Birmingham, Ala., was to resume in late February or early March, he said. Insuf­ficient orders would delay the restart of plants at Orem, utah, and Baytown, Texas. 
USX also has steel or iron ore plants covered by the pact in Minnesota and Michigan.

Way to go, Irish! 
Notre Dame's 60-58 victory over North Caroljna Sunday will live forever as a Notre Dame moment. It was one of those games that comes along once in a lifetime. 
Sunday's game helped ease the pain of several years of missed chances, close losses and losing seasons which have haunted Notr~ Dame athletics in recent years. Sunday, a Notre Dame team hung tough against the number-one team in the nation and with the game on the line, these Irish pulled out a win. 
When the horn sounded to end the game, Notre Dame erupted. The students mobbed the court, celebrating a game that they had been as much a part of as anyone who played. Notre Dame head coach Digger Phelps said afterward that although NBC named Gary Voce the game's MVP, the student body deserved to be named second. 
But at the end, those same fans came close to taking the game from the players they had so ably supported. From pregame warm-ups to well after the game was over, the fans had rattled the Tar Heels while exhorting the Irish. Then, they celebrated too early by throwing their ND placards on the court, which cost the Irish a technical foul. This action did not show the rest of the nation the class that Notre Dame students really possess. Moreover, it almost cost the Irish the game. 
But Sunday was a day fated for the Irish. They made the key plays and free throws necessary to make the game a Notre Dame moment. This season's edition of the Irish proved true the words Phelps spoke to a different squad six years ago, "Nobody leaves Notre Dame number one." 
The Notre Dame students, despite their one trespass, proved to the world what we have known for a long time: We AreND.

Chants lessen quality of supportive crowd 
Dear Editor: 

The victory over top-ranked North Carolina is one that will be savored for years, no doubt. The ·students' ·partici­pation and support played a postive role in it. Yet as we enter the month of February, set off to recognize the con­tributions of blacks to this country's history, I do not feel that the chants welcoming Carolina's starting lineup were appropriate as a beginning. "Sit down, white boy! Your mama! Two plus two equals five, right J .R.?" Such statements as these might be less dis­appointing if they were coming from the mouths of racially uneducated people but not from future leaders in our government and corporate America. Though the students probably felt that these chants were innocuous, I found them quite condescending. The black student-athletes that have graduated and will graduate from Notre Dame are not the only blacks that can do well academically. While I am sure that J.R. Reid can add and read, contrary to a particular chant, I also feel confident that tutors on most col­lege campuses do not work exclusively for the benefit of minorities, either stu­dents or athletes. 
A large part of the college experience comes from those things learned out­side of the classsroom. I would hope that those students so vocal in support­ing the Irish are as energetic in chal­lenging generalities they might foster about others. Toward this goal various activities have been planned for Black History Month to help complete our col­lege education.

Sailors deserve credit for work in victories 
Dear Editor: 
I was extremely disappointed with Marty Burns' article, "Please blow away Stars and Stripes, forever." Burns displayed a surprising lack of knowledge about the America's Cup. To those who have ever been to a real beach or wish they had, sailing is an enjoyable sport. 
Burns maintains that the "private beaches along the Eastern seaboard" choked on their caviar, formed a synd­icate, and rehired Dennis Connor to bring the America's Cup back. Obvi­ously, Burns did not do his homework. Connor is based in San Diego, Califor­nia, well over 2,500 miles from the East Coast. He was not alone on the West Coast, as Newport Beach, California also had a boat called "The Eagle." In fact, these syndicates are funded by corporate sponsorship, not the skip­pers' pocketbooks. The yachts come from numerous cities and countries to compete in the "Super Bowl" of sailing. Did you forget about "French Kiss" and "Italy", who were eliminated ear­lier? 
I and many other Americans hope that Dennis Connor and "Stars and Stripes" do recapture the America's Cup. This is something we, as Americans, can be proud of.

Packers select Braatz for front-office position 
Associated Press 
GREEN BAY, Wis. -Tom Braatz, named Saturday as ex­ecutive vice president of foot­ball operations for the Green Bay Packers, says he has no timetable for making the Pack­ers into winners again -but he welcomes the task. 
Braatz, who has been with the Atlanta Falcons organiza­tion since 1965 and was director of college scouting for the Fal­cons last season, said he was lured to the Green Bay job be­cause of what it entails. 
"It's just football. You don't have to fool with tickets and you don't have to fool with public relations," he said. "It's just football and that's what's fun about it. " 
He said his first priority is to get the Packers ready for the National Football League draft in April. 
Green Bay finished 4-12 last year and hasn't had a winning season since going 5-3-1 in the strike-shortened season of 1982. 
Braatz, 54, a Kenosha native, said he should have no trouble working with Packers Coach Forrest Gregg, whose respon­sibilities will be reduced some­what. 
"Forrest and I have had several discussions in In­dianapolis prior to me taking the job," Braatz said, referring to meetings while in In­dianapolis for scouring poten­tial recruits. 
"Everything was ironed out before I said OK," he said. "You can't initiate and you can't consumate trades unless you get with the coach. He knows better than I the needs of the football team." 
Braatz will begin his new po­sition Feb. 20 and will sign a four-year contract later this month, said Packers President Robert Parins. 
Parins said Braatz was selec­ted after an extensive search which included interviews wtih five people and evaluations of 20 other candidates. 
The hiring of Braatz will mark the first time since Vince Lombardi was hired in 1959 that the Packers head coach has not had complete authority over the football operations.

Phelps attributed the success of last night's full-court press to a technique he discovered while recruiting in Central New York. While traveling in the area, he said he watched a junior high school basketball game where he saw the press in action. Phelps named it the "Bucky Winters," after the coach he said in­vented it.

Voce had the potential, and Shumate, a premier center in his playing days, brought it out. 
"Shumate didn't think I was working hard enough or possesed the desire," said Voce. "He spoke to me about it, and it hurt. But then I started to work harder. He's really worked on my aggressiveness .. and consistency." 
Voce couldn't have picked a better time for his arrival on the court. 
"It meant a great lot to me," Voce said of Sunday's win. "My mom and friends (in Queens, N.Y.) saw it. They had to be saying, 'What's Voce doing in South Bend?' Now they know Notre Dame is good club. 
"We believe in ourselves, and this was definitely a confi­dence builder. We've been searching for our identity. We knew we could play. I'm not sure anybody else did." 
As for Shumate, it looks as if his search for a center is over.

Irish take second in Invitational as John Carroll's depth too much 
By STEVE MEGARGEEE 
Sports Writer 
To the casual fan, Notre Dame may have looked much better than John Carroll in yes­terday's National Catholic Wrestling Invitational at the ACC. Looks aren't everything. 
While the Irish turned in several outstanding individual performances en route to win­ning four individual champion­ships, John Carroll's balance and experience helped it even­tually capture the tournament title. Notre Dame finished in second place. 
"We have better people, but we just don't have enough of them. We don't have the bal­ance they have, so we needed to win the close matches," said Irish coach Fran McCann. "Their balance was a factor, but we still had the people to win it. We just didn't do it." 
Freshman 118-pound Andy Radenbaugh, ·and sophomores 126-pound Dave Carlin, 134­pound Jerry Durso, and 142­pound Pat Boyd won individual titles for Notre Dame. Raden­baugh, Carlin, and Durso won their final-round matches on major decisions, while Boyd took his on a pin. 
John Carroll's victories were a bit on the closer side, but the team still managed to take five individual championships to 
-
emerge victorious in what was essentially a two-team race be­tween John Carroll and Notre Dame. 
"They've got four or five seniors in their lineup. I knew they'd be tough," said McCann. "They dominated this tourna­ment for years." 
It was John Carroll's ninth 
Rebels win over Auburn 
Associated Press 
AUBURN, Ala. -Guard Freddie Banks scored 36 points -including 27 on 3-point field goals -and forward Armon Gil­liam added 31 as third-ranked Nevada-Las Vegas defeated No. 19 Auburn 104-85 in an in­tersectional college basketball game yesterday: 
Banks hit nine of 13 3-point attempts and 13 of 21 overall from the field as the Runnin' Rebels improved their record to 21-1. 
For the game, UNLV, a Pacific Coast Athletic Confer­ence team that was ranked No. 1 for eight weeks this season, hit 14 of 28 3-point shots. 
Chris Morris and Jeff Moore led Auburn, 12-6, with 17 points apiece and Mike Jones added 16 before 12,584 fans, the second-largest basketball crowd in the Tigers history. 
UNLV led 60-49 at halftime and Auburn's Frank Ford hit the first field goal of the second half with 19:04 left to cut the margin to nine. 
But the Rebels outscored the Tigers of the Southeastern Con­ference 29-10 over the next 12 minutes to build an 89-61 lead with 9: 13 remaining. During that stretch, Gilliam had nine points and Banks six. 
UNLV was able to stifle the Tigers' inside game in the second half with a tight 2-3 zone defense. 
championship in the last ten years. Notre Dame won the title last year to break John Carroll's string of eight con­secutive championships. 
Other wrestlers placing for the Irish included 150-pound junior Ron Wisniewski (third), 167-pound sophomore Chris Genes_er (second), 190-pound senior Dave Helmer (tnird), and heavyweight freshman Mike Crounse (third). 
Geneser's loss in the finals was only his third of the season, as he currently holds a record of 23-3. 
"We lost a couple of tough matches. Helmer lost a close one in the semi-finals, and that hurt us," said McCann. " "Chris still isn't looking really good since coming back from his injury. This could be a blessing in disguise for him. He's got to start working on some things, and he realizes it. He'll work through it. He's ded­icated." 
Despite having to settle for second place in the tourna­ment, McCann was pleased with the winning individuals, particularly Durso. Durso, re­turning after a two-week layoff because of a shoulder injury, was named the outstanding wrestler of the tournament. 
"Jerry hadn't wrestled in two weeks, and he looked like dynamite. Boyd didn't have a close match in the tournament, and I wouldn't quarrel with him being named outstanding wrestler either," said McCann. "Our first four guys <Radenbaugh, Carlin, Durso, and Boyd) are tough. I think they and Geneser can qualify for nationals. They just have to believe they can." 
McCann was also pleased with the way the tournament was run as a whole. 
"I'm pleased because I want to host some tournaments here in the future, and this tourna­ment was sort of a training ground for us," said McCann. "We want to host a regional next year. I think we'll put in for it, and I'm confident we'll get it." 
Notre Dame's next dual meet will be at home against Mic­higan State on Thursday.

Stars & Stripes sails ahead to 2-0 Cup lead 
Associated Press 
FREMANTLE, Aus. -Stars &Stripes, proving it can win in all winds, blew away Kookaburra III in stiff breezes yesterday for a one-minute, 10­second victory that brought the America's Cup halfway back to its home of 132 years. 
The U.S. yacht took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven finals and carried skipper Dennis Conner to within two victories of redemption for his 1983 loss of the prize. 
Much calmer conditions were forecast for today's third race. Kookaburra III skipper lain Murray, feeling his boat is better suited to light, shifty winds, decided not to call an off day.

SAB presents 
By PETE GEGEN 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Saturday afternoon Rick Muench was having one of those days where everything he did was going right. He had taken second in the high jump with a personal best of six feet, twoinchesandinthelongjump with a leap of 23 feet, 2 314 inches. 
But in the triple jump, the last event to finish the meet, Muench was unknowingly jumping for an Irish team vic­tory. Muench had finished his jumps before the results of the second-to-last event, the mile relay, were announced, which had left the Irish down by only two points. A first place in the triple jump would mean a team victory for Notre Dame. 
But it was not to be. After jumping 47 feet, seven inches in the preliminary jumps, he had scratched in the finals and the Wolverines' Butch Star­nack jumped 47 feet, nine inches to take the event and the meet from the Irish. 
"I scratched on my last three jumps," said Muench. "I broke down in the middle of my runs. It was just one of those things." 
But in the eyes of Head Coach Joe Piane, the scratches were insignificant compared to the day Meunch had. 
"He just had a terrific day," said Piane. "He's not world­class, but he competes every time he's out there." 
In fact, Piane had very few things to gripe about after losing to Michigan by the score of 67-64. 
"I'm not going to complain," he said. "This is one of the bet­ter teams in the Big Ten, and the difference was only two inches. You know, I bet if we ran this meet again, we would win it." 
The Irish jumped to a 10­point as they took each of the first four events. Shot putter Tom Kraus did not have one of 
Track team beaten by Wolverines despite banner outing for Muench 
his best meets but still 
managed to win the shot put 
with a toss of 51 feet, 11 3-8 
inches. 

Hurdler Glenn Watson then 
set a meet record and qualified 
for the IC4A's by taking the 60­
yard high hurdles. His time of 
7:35 also was just nine-one hundreths of a second shy of the NCAA championship qual­ifying standard. 
"I got off to a better start," said Watson, who had been slow out of the blocks in his two previous races. "I knew (Michigan's Phil Webb) was close. I just wanted to get away from him." 
Sprinter Tim Brown has also been working on his starts, and it paid off as he won the 60-yard dash in a hand-held time of 6.2 seconds. 
Dan Garrett made it four in 
a row for Notre Dame by win­
ning the mile run. He held off 
a charge by Michigan's Chris 
Brewster with 300 yards to go 
to win the race. 
The Wolverines then took a large bite out of the Irish lead when they swept the 800-yard run. Notre Dame's David Warth hit the wall after leading early, and Michigan's Matt Butler, Earl Parrish, and Rob Rinck passed him to finish one­two-three. The nine-point sweep gave the Wolverines a 32-31lead. 
Omar Davidson increased Michigan's lead to two when he out-ran Notre Dame's Robert Nobles in the 600-yard dash. But Brown and Tony Ragunas got the lead back for the Irish when they finished first and third respectively in the 300­yard dash. 
Michigan took the lead for good when Scott Crawford set a new meet record in the high jump with a leap of six feet, eight inches, and Rollie Hudson barely edged Notre Dame's Jeff Van Wie for an exciting conclusion to the 1000-yard run.

O'Conner qualified for the IC4A's in the two mile with a time of 8:58.35, but he finished second to the Wolverine's Chris Brewster, who set a meet record with a time of 8:53.88 
Notre Dame almost picked up ground in the pole vault when it appeared Michigan's Dave Irvine would not clear 14 feet, six inches. But on his third attempt Irvine cleared the bar and went on to clear 15 feet to take the event. Chris Matteo and Chris Componovo finish second and third respectively for the Irish. 
It appeared Michigan had wrapped up the meet when its mile relay team beat Notre Dame's. But Michigan's team was disqualified when its first two runners ran inside the in­side lane. As a result, Notre Dame found itself down by only two with the triple jump results yet to come. 
AFC takes defensive Pro Bowl 
Associated Press 
HONOLULU -John Elway threw for the game's only touchdown, and Denver 
-
Broncos teammate Karl Meck­lenburg spearheaded a smot­hering defense to lead the AFC to a 10-6 victory over the NFC in yesterday's Pro Bowl foot­ball game. 
Elway, who threw for 304 yards in the Broncos' 39-20 Super Bowl loss to the New York Giants the previous Sun­day, put the AFC ahead to stay with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Todd Christensen of the Los Angeles Raiders on the final play of the first quarter. 
That touchdown -and a 26­yard field goal by New En­gland's Tony Franklin just before halftime -were set up when the NFC's return special­ist, rookie Vai Sikahema of St. Louis, fumbled the ball away on punt returns. 
-
The victory halted, at least temporarily, the NFC's domination of the AFC in recent postseason play. The National Conference had won five of the last seven NFL all­star games and five of the last six Super Bowls, the last three by wide wargins. 
The AFC reduced the NFC's lead in the Pro Bowl series to 10-7. 
Seattle's Fredd Young recovered the first fumble by Sikahema, who had turned the ball over just twice during the regular season, at the NFC 17 to set up the touchdown. 
Miami rookie linebacker John Offerdahl fell on the second Sikahema fumble at the AFC 44, setting up Franklin's field goal and a 10-0 lead. 
The NFC was limited to a field goal of 38 yards by Morten Andersen in the third quarter and a 19-yarder by the New Or­leans kicker in the opening seconds of the final period. 
Defensive end Reggie White of Philadelphia was a standout for the NFC, logging a Pro Bowl record-tying four sacks. Although on the losing team, he was voted the game's most valuable player.

Notre Dame knocks off North Carolina, 60-58 
Voce's emerging offense keys Irish inside production 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
Mter Sunday's win was safely in the record books, Irish head coach Digger Phelps said that Assistant Coach John Shumate had found a copy of the Doobie Brothers' "Long Train Running," a song Shumate and his teammates had used to psyche themselves up to play UCLA. The Irish used that song to get them­selves pumped up to upset North Carolina. 
For Shumate, it was another find that really keyed the Irish win -Gary Voce. In the past eight days, Voce's play has been nothing short of amazing. 
Last Saturday, Voce scored six points and grabbed 13 rebounds against UCLA. He followed that performance with 14 points and 12 rebounds against Dayton last Tuesday. Just two days later, he had six and eight. Sunday, he had the game of his career for the third time in a week by scoring 15 points, including the game­sealing free throws, and hauling down 10 boards, includ­ing the one which sent him to the line for the final shots. NBC named him the game's MVP. 
Now Voce has become a threat inside which opens up a new look in the Irish offensive scheme. 
"I told Gary two weeks ago after the loss to West Virginia that he was going to have to step out and shoot from the baseline," said Phelps. "We did that against UCLA, we did that this week and we did it today. He can stick that shot. That's a new dimension in our offense." 
With the coaches showing confidence in him, Voce has shown confidence in himself. 
"I felt I could score if I wanted," he said. "Lately, Coach has told me it was OK to take the outside shot more because teams were not playing me as an outside player. That was putting more pressure on the guards. I've al­ways felt I could play the post. 
"I think maybe other teams will see this and say Voce is a threat now. Whether I get the ball in the post a lot or not, the other teams will have to keep Burns have complete coverage of the shocker

Irish win makes ACC crowd go crazy, almost too crazy 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame student body had come under fire of late for its less-than­enthusiastic support. Sunday the students put that notion to rest. If anything, they were over-enthusiastic. 
"When it's time for these mo­ments," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps, "(the students) don't let you down. Gary Voce was named MVP, but I think the second votes went to the student body. They were just

When something else came out, I said to (referee) Joe Forte, 'That was a North Carolina fan."' 
With five seconds remaining in the game and Notre Dame up 58-55, the crowd began to celebrate, and the signs rained down on the court. With Voce heading to the line, referee Gerry Donaghy whistled the Irish for a technical. "It would have been a tough situa­tion to to have your students lose the game for you," said Phelps. "It's just a question of who did it and why they did it. From that standpoint, we got away with it, but I think the students will be upset with each other."

Comeback victory even sweeter after previous last-minute losses , 

By MARTY BURNS Assistant Sports Editor 

Already on the season they had been blown out. In another game, they blew a huge lead in the last few minutes and lost. They came up short in two other close attempts at an up­set. They were at times snakebitten, at times careless, and often painfully dull. 
But Sunday afternoon, they were the best team in college basketball -at least for one day. 
This Notre Dame basketball team, which many felt lacked the talent and chemistry which characterized many of the past great Irish teams, had done what only five other teams in Notre Dame's history had been able to do on the hardwood of the ACC: They had knocked off the No. I team in the country. 
And when it was all over, and the crowd had spilled onto the floor to help the Irish players cut down the nets, the scoreboard stated the unbeliev­able: ND 60, No. Carolina 58. 
"We just really wanted to win this game," said Irish coach Digger Phelps in a post-game conference room located safely away from the melee on the floor. "We've lost four games this year in the last minute, but I told the kids, 'You can play with anybody', and today was an opportunity for us to go for our moment." 
And what a moment it was. The Irish trailed the contest at one point 32-16, and found them­selves down 53-44 with only six minutes to go. In addition, junior guard David Rivers and junior center Gary Voce were playing with four fouls apiece. 
"We didn't crack when it was time for us to crack and that's a sign of maturity," noted Phelps. "We did a better job of controlling their trap in the second half and we started to I go inside more." 
The task of breaking the Tar Heels' swarming half-court trap (which yielded only three turnovers in the second half compared to eight in the first) fell to Rivers, while the usually­timid Voce erupted inside to power the Irish offense. 
"I think this whole year we've been searching for an identity," said Voce. "We've had a lot of heartaches this year, a lot of close games that we've lost. I think we felt like we really needed to win a big game. We knew all along we could play, but we needed this for our confidenoe." 
If anything should be able to give the Irish confidence as they head into the homestretch of the season and their now almost-assured NCAA Tourna­ment bid, it should be the man-
