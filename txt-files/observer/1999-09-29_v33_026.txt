Panel discusses pregnancy options 
By KA TE WALTER 
News Writer 

Panelists provided informa­tion on options available to pregnant students at Notre Dame, which can help comfort expectant mothers and lessen the overwhelming feeling of impossibility that exists for many of them. 
Aiming to dispel the various perceptions surrounding preg­nancy at :'Jotre Dame and fos­ter better communication about on-campus support cen­ters available for exp ec tant mothers, student groups Jus Vitae, Feminists for Life and ND/SMC Right to Life spon­sored a discussion Tuesday. 
"When a woman finds out that she's pregnant, she often considt1rs it an overwhelming task and something that she cannot handle,., said Sister :vtary Louise Gude, assistant vice president for Student Affairs. 
The program featured a panel that included junior Lynette Vargas, a student mother, and representatives from six campus facilities that offer support for pregnant stu­dents including Student Affairs, University Health Services, the lniversity Counseling Center, rectors, Campus Ministry and the off­campus Women's Care Center. 
The major misconception conceroing pregnancy at Notre Dame is that pregnant students are required to move; off campus, Gude said.

INSIDE COLUMN 

More Hunting, Less Gathering 
In contemporary society, we arc faced with a multitude of problems that plague our everyday lives and affect the common good. This is true even of Notre Dame, where one might assume that the "bubble" protects us from issues we face in the outside world. Some of 
these issues are artually non-issues, such as whining about unchecked f'recdnm of speech or other such "rights" which private insti­tutions have no obligation to uphold. 
But then there are legiti­mate worries, like the over­abundance of vegetarians 
and vegans on campus. The Dustin Ferrell problem is not their exis· tence or their presence on campus, but rather the Assistant injustice done by not expos­Vieu1point ing these students to quality Editor meat. I've seen these poor, iron-deficient creatures around campus trying to convince everyone that tofu really does taste good or that rice is exciting on a daily basis. 
Ihave heard the statistics on how much grass cows eat and how, "ifwe would stop raising them for slaughter, we could eat the grass and be happy." But I am not content with allowing them to make such choices without giving them a full opportunity to enjoy meat. I want these indi­viduals to experience the thrill of dining with the realization that their meals once roamed the earth as living, breathing creatures. 
I feel an invigorating power trip every time I order stir-fry. It simply wouldn't be fair to exclude anyone from such a pleasure, not even the people who used to protest "donkey basket­ball" back in high school. 
For some students, the choice is one of health concerns, due to overstated risks ofeating meat or the simple desire to cut out all fat from their diet. But I say to you that I would prefer one year with ribs and chicken to a lifetime of tofu meat­loaf and garbanzo tacos. 
Others have moral qualms about eating meat, likening it to barbarism and cruelty towards fel­low creatures of the earth. I suggest spending about 10 minutes watching "Animal Planet" when tigers are featured. Then you can guilt trip meat-eaters on this point, or you can break free from your delusional ways. 
It might be of some importance to also note that none of our ancient ancestors were vegetari­ans. That's because all of the PETA fruitloops of the ancient world became tasty low-fat snacks for saber-toothed tigers that had a sweet tooth for gardenburger-eating, David-Spade-body­types who "felt the animals' pain." Unfortunately, it was the type of animal pain that zebras and water buffalo feel on those nature shows with crocodiles. 
The point of this column is to promote a healthy appreciation of feasting on our friends in the wilderness. We are -as we should be ­steak-and-egg-eating, milk-drinking hunters who have a God-given dominion over animals and the right to take advantage of it to sustain life. 
No longer must our big-hearted brothers and sisters suffer in martyr-like anguish over another meal served without poultry or beef. Let your­selves go, and harness the warrior spirit inside you. Take your rightful place in the food chain, let your biceps exceed your wrists in girth, and I'll see you at the steakhouse.

"I like this business IJNtcr," says Karen Bmwr owner of Molly McGuire's. "I have three tec:nagers and they all work here from timn to time." 
The renovations, which took nine months to complete, began three days af'ter the fated Jan. 30, 1998 raid that shul down Bridget's. 
In the days aft(ff the raid, Bauer got the idoa for a coffee house after soeing a 
Starbucks. 
She and her husband visited coffee houses all over the country tu get ideas. Other owners of java hut were very will­ing to share their ideas and opinions, which made the whole process a lot easi­er. 
They decided to go with a homey atmosphere -the closest South Bend can get to your grandmother's house, minus the plastic on the furniture, Bauer said. 
"Notre Dame students are from all over the country, We wanted a place where the students could feel at home," she explained. 

The renovation, done by the owners themselves, certainly was not easy. Aside from aesthetic changes, the entire kitchen had to be upgraded to allow for a dramat­ically inr.reascd menu, Bauer said. 
Structurally. the restaurant remained the same, aside from the brick floor and the brass bar. 
The menu was upgraded to include a full line of sandwiches, salads and w~ge­tarian options, along with a variety of

did all the fakf~ lD's come from?"' asked Bauer, who changed the bar into Molly McGuire's Coffee House. "The technology is just too good."' 
Bauer is not sure why that particular night was chosen for the raid.But she has her suspi­cions. 
She said she bas heard rumors that other bars were jealous of Bridget's business aml alerted pojice that under­age people were bt"ing served alcohol. 
She said she also heard that complaints came from a diffor­ent source. 
"I've hearrl there were two phontc! calls made that night requesting raids. I've he-ard [the rumor] about Notre Dame being involved, but I really don't know anything for cer­tain." Jeff Shoup. din~ctor of resilience life, sa.id Bridget's was well-known for serving people younger than 21. 
"It didn't take a rocket scien­tist to know they were serving minors anyway," Shoup said. "But was it us who called Bridget's that night? No." Chuck Hurley, of the Notre Dame security department, shed light on the controversy. 
"On a few occasions, we have warned police that bars have large numbers of underage drinkers," Hurley said. "That was the case with Bridget's." 
As for the reason that night was chosen, Hurley said that the South Bend police waited for a night when a large under­age crowd was anticipated. 
He also said that some rec­tors came to Bridget's in the weeks before the raid. "They saw students they knew that were obviously freshmen," he said. 
At any rate.' Bauer said she "will never sell liquor again," even though she is currently in a legal process to get the estab­lishment's liquor licence back. 
A liquor licence often war­rants a higher selling price in a city which is no longer issuing new liquor licenses, such as South Bend. They can go for around $30,000 in South Bend, but up to $100,000 in Mishawaka. 
As part of the hearing to gain her license back, Bauer said that there is a chance that "all the kids who were caught [drinking underage] might be called back to court to prove that they had showed some form of ID to a bouncer." 
Regardless, the memory of Bridget's lives on in the minds of many Notre Dame upper­classmen and alumni. "Every football weekend," Bauer said, "drunk alumni come in and get mad at me when I tell them we're not a bar any longer." 
The Irish Connection, or !CONN. is a more recent exam­ple of a bar with legal troubles. 
On Nov.12.1998, the bar was raided by South Bend police, and has never been t.he same. After inqueries by the police on different occasions. !CONN also lost its liquor license. 
Now it operates as a club without alcohol, catering to underage students. 
Leou Townsend, !CONN owner. said South Bt>nd police have 1.reaterl his bar unfairly, using a few fights on !CONN propr~rty as an excuse to issue the establishment with "failurr to kt>ep a high and fine reputa­tion." Townsend said race came into play in the police departmt'nt's choice of which bars to raid. 
"When white guys owned I hi? 
business a few years ago," he said, "their .licenses were renewed without a problem. But when I became owner again, for Saturday nights I tried to attract a black crowd that used to go to V.I.P. [a club with a predominantly black crowd. that was shut down last year]. 
"A police officer came to me in October of last year, and told me that the V.1.P. crowd could not start coming to !CONN," Townsend added. "They came anyways, and our bar was raid­ed." 
Finnigan's is another dance­oriented bar that has not manv encounters from South Rend police. 
"We am always worried about !trouble from the South bend police I, but we do our best to hire bouncers who check !D's well." said Dawn Kendall, manager of Finnigan's. 
She said that Finnigans' secret, which has allowed them to never get raided, is to cater to an older crowd. Kendall said they do this by offering "college seniors only night," and other specials aimed at upperclass­men from the University. 
HoweYer, Kendall secs trou­ble for bars in the f11lure. "1 think Igetting shut down] will happen to more bars. I've heard that they are really cracking down. Who is 'they?' Nolre Dame. There are always rumors you hear about Notre Dame giving tips," she said. 
Shoup handles many off-cam­pus concerns. "We actually have a specific path for that [underage drinking] informa­tion," he said. "If I hear about a certain bar catering to an underage crowd, I tell Notre Dame security my concerns." 
"Security are more friendly with South Bend police, and they talk to [the police) as a courtesy," he added. 
Hurley made it clear that the security department contacts South Bend police to get names of arrested students for the Univerity disciplinary depart­ment contact with South Bend police is in getting names of arrested students for the university's disciplinary depart­ment, Shoup's residence life. Hurley said that only rarely does the department suggest that South Bend police take a look at a certain bar.' After get­ting a list of arrested students from Hurley, Shoup meets with these students, who are often the most helpful tipsters. 
"Say you went to Finnigan's last night, and you got drunk, got in a fight, and you got arrested," he said. "Then you would meet with me. Kids who got busted give us our informa­tion most of the time." 
Sometimes the police don't have plans to raid a bar, but something happens there that brings the establishment to their attention. 
"If there is a fight or stabbing in the vicinity, the police will find that the culprits were in a certain bar minutes before a fight," Shoup said. "Then some­times they will raid the bar." 
Shoup and his office play an active rule in some off-campus activities, including keeping a watrh on off-campus student housing. "We have to respon<l if we are having problems some­where. If we hear intoxicated pnople are geUing mugged, we will call Lafayette scrurity. for instance, and ask them to be more aware of their surround­ings." 
Shoup recognized that some things arc be'yond Notre Dame's reach. 
"Living in the real world loff­rnmpus!," he said, "somelimes it's just 'if you get in Lrouble, you get in trouble."' 

Bars

cold beverages. Of course, this is in addition to an impressive array of r,offees and teas. 
"The health inspector says we're one of the cleanest restaurants in the county," Bauer proudly added. That includes the notorious bath­rooms -which any true patron of Bridget's c:an remem­ber vividly. 
As for the clientclc, students still remain a large part. The coffee shop is also frequPntPd by members uf the medical community, owing to Hrn large number of doctor and d<'ntist offices nearby, as well as St. Joe's Medical C,mter. 
"We do get a lot of students. Al night there's a lot of study­ing going on," Bauer said, adding that she normally turns down t.he music if people are studying. "If someone had told me I'd be doing this now, I'd say they were crazy," Baliflf said. 
Although the money isn't the same. the restaurant has s-ur­vived its first year -the tradi­tional test for eateries. This can perhaps be attributed to the fact that Molly's is one of the few restaurants of its kind in the South Bend ania. 
Another. more recent convert to the non-alcoholic scene is Irish Connection. Earlier this year management decided to place its liquor license in escrow after a disagreement with the Indiana Alcoholic Beverage Commission about a fight outside the establishment. 
"It's gradually picking up," said Irish Connection owner Leon Townsend on business since tJw changeovnr. "Surprisingly, there's a lot or under 21 people that just want to go to dance. It's not so much the alcohol. 
"Drinkers really didn't partic ipate. Tlrny just stood there drinking. It's more of a carefree atmosphere now -people just having fun," Townsend said. 
"From the standpoint of see­ing people have fun, this isn't a bad way to gu. It could be a blessing in disguise," he added. 
As an added bonus, !CONN also experiences less probh1ms with disorderly conduct from 
its patrons, Townsrmd said. The 
main challenge is having to 
generate revenue solely 
through cover charges and var­
ious games and concessions. 
Surprising !CONN managers, 
many ovcr-21 students visit 
!CONN lo dance after they've 
becm to other bars, he said. 
"We still have about 10 per­.cent of our customers over 21," 
he explained. "Not drinking is 
not as big a problem as people 
think," Townsend said. 
"Dancing is what's attracting 
thorn." 
The nstablishment's atmos­
phere remains largely 
unchanged, with two dance 
floors and a bar-like scene. In 
lieu ur alcohol, they now serve 
frozen drinks like virgin 
daiquiris and margaritas, as 
well as smoothies. 
As far as food, they have hot­
dogs, cheeseburgers and 
nachos. 
"Thursday night still seems to 
be the popular night for stu­
dents." said Townsend. 
"In spite of the talk that stu­
dents can't have f'un without 
alcohol, I've rrrnt a bunch that 
have proved that wrong." 
Townsend said.

Non-drinkers sometimes find themselves feeling alienated at parties. 
"The same people who during the week arc good for profound conversation, on the weekend, act like idiots," said freshman Brian Hartman. 
Alternatives to the alcohol culture are sought. The group Flipside offers alcohol-free entertainment 
"There are many things to do and go to on campus," Schmidt said. 
"People can overlook them easily, but going to perfor­mances like the recent 'Second City' production was as fun as most parties," he said.

hol is officially not allowed in dorm rooms." sophomore Steve Cantu points out. 
As some freshmen have already discovered. rectors and residence advisors are quick to act when someone drinks irre­sponsibly and is in physical risk. 
"It's good to have a rector who lives down the hall in case someone is out of control, which can happen with inexperienced people drinking," said freshman Jason Mathias. 
Still, at least a few people said soft rules are a contradiction when compared to other University policies. 
"It's funny how we hol<l our behavior to such high standards in some areas and then ignore a nation-wide law," freshman Jessica Schmidt said. 
There are others on campus in opposition the student body's focus on drinking as its prima­ry form of entertainment. 
The alcohol culture can be seen in piles of beer cans and bottles in the garbage cans and recycling bins in the dorm to the illegitimate Notre Dame T­shirts with slogans like "Absolut Irish," "Drink Like a Champion Today" and "God, Country, Notre Dame, Beer" seen on countless students.

Mourners paid tribute Tuesday to nine people, including two Roman Catholic nuns, killed on a mercy mission to East Timor refugees. 
The victims, whose bodies were dumped in a river, included a 69-year-old Italian nun, Ermina Cazzaniga, who had been in East Timor for 30 years. 
Also killed were a Timorese nun, live church workers and students, an Indonesian journalist work­ing for a Japanese news organization and a local driver.

Before this week, the "Generations" newsletter has sat untouched on my desk with only the headline, "Goal!" drawing any attention to it. 
1knew that the University, by ear­marking every sin­gle contribution by anvone over the last two years as part of "Generations," had reached its goal of $767 million. I also knew that a large amount of this would go to endowed chairs, some scholarships and the construc­tion of yet another science building. But, I wasn't sure about the full effect that this wealth would have on the University, so I final­ly broke down and read the pamphlet. 
What was written inside has forced me to recognize something apparently very, very necessary to this University: lots and lots of money. 
Now I realize that many of the fine structures that I had the privilege of working and living in needed large amounts of capital to be built. Some were built for good, necessary reasons. Some were built because an insanely rich alumnus decided that he ner.ded his name on an edifice and gave gener­ously to a tax-deductible cause in order that such glory could be his. I realize that, in order to survive as an institute of higher learning, this Cniversity has invest its time and effort into improving the quality of its facilities. 
A great many worthwhile programs will benefit from the "Generations" campaign. The newsletter devotes an entire page to The Institute for Church Life and its job as a training ground for priests and community volunteers. According to the newsletter, the !CL is scheduled to receive at least $1.865 million. I won't begrudge that. It sounds like a good program to help fill the altars and churches in this country that have stood vacant for far too long. 

Of course there is the proposed new Science Teaching Facility. This project is slated to receive $60 million. That is a full eight percent of the total cam­paign. Why is this building necessary? According to the newsletter, "to main­tain the University's status as a top­ranked teaching institution." 
I would advance the theory that any campaign as gigantic as "Generations" must serve two absolute goals. The first is to make the University a somewhat pricier, but still affordable, alternative to the ever-improving public university system. The second is to make the University appeal to a wider range of students. 
Originally I feared that this second goal was sacrificed in favor of graduate research laboratory space and the ever-increasing graduate schools at Notre Dame. My father, a 1966 gradu­ate, used to complain that Notre Dame was trying to turn into a sort of "Catholic Harvard" (i.e. formerly one of the greatest undergraduate universi­ties, now more known for its graduate schools and research). But, being a graduate student myself and seeing some of the wonderful benefits and prestige that graduate research can bestow upon a university, I cannot really accept that point of view any­more. Of course, Harvard is at the top of the U.S. News & World Heport rank­ings every year so how can we go wrong to emulate them? 
We have plenty of "science only" buildings on campus. But where are all of the Arts and Lett11rs ollices? Thev are in that run-down and paper-str.ewn closet of a building that is O'Shaughnessey Hail. 
Of course. as I said, lots and lots of morn~y is needed to fund these build­ings and to insure that the University is able to make a good showing amongst schools like Harvard and Stanford and Yale. Where does this money come from? It comes mostly from tuition. That is where my first supposed goal for the "Generations" campaign comes into effect. This campaign should be used to pay for these projects so that tuition is not caused to rise. As the newsletter says. "Keeping the Notre Dame experience affordable has been a recurring theme throughout the cam­paign and one which the University trustees have insisted upon." 
Every year, tuition goes up and every year the University rejoices that it has risen "by the smallest percentage in history." However, working out the numbers, that percentage incrnase almost always amounts to a larger increase from year-to year in real dol­lars. 
They say that scholarships are a main priority but do not note any. They say that keeping tlrn experience afford­able is the idea, but do not stop tuition at its already insanely high amount. 
I am not the one to stand in the way of learning on any level. But Notre Dame is special. It has a special char­acter and has had a reputation as a high-quality liberal-arts undergraduate school. Are we throwing that away just because of what some stupid magazine ranks as important factors amongst "national" universities? Is it worth the $767 million dollars? Is it worth thn sacrifice of that liberal arts reputation? 
I hope so.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

The following is a response to Sean Vinck's article, "Limits of the free sp1icch clausc," (9/28/99). Mr. Vinck argu11s that freedom of speech "leads to destructive and harmful ends for individual souls." tin may not be entirely justified in this conclusion. The fact that both sicllls, conservative and liberal, hypocritically object to the right frne spm1ch when that right is used to refute their arguments does not necessarily entail that free speech is in and of' itself, immoral. 
Thcrnforn, arguing that free spe1!ch should be constrained b11cause no one really follows it anyway is absurd. Granting him that point l10wever, and assuming that the f'ree exchange of' ideas endangnrs immortal souls, in one limit1id sense. he may be correct. I assPrt, howcve,-, that limiting the I\Xcha11g11 of" ideas might be equally as hazardous to our moral health. 
Lt!t's nssunrn that Notre Dame holds position A, and them is a contrary position B. We wish to ban B bncausn it is f"undamrntally immoral. wlwrnas /\ is lwlinved to b1\ true. This assurncs, however, that 1I we are certain that !\ is a corrnct and 2) thnre is nothing to b1! gaitrnd by discussil1g point B. Mr. Vi11ck argmis f'rom the assumption that A is supported by tlw Church and /\ is thnrn!"on1 true. Lnaving that can of worms aside l'or tlw monwnt, llrn f'act rnmains lhnt tlwrr is much to be gaim~d by discussing B. B could serve as a contrast to t\, hnlping us to better 11ndcrsland what is mmtnl when an authority asserts A. By dis­cussing B critically. adherents of A might be able to convince the "lwrNical" ncrowd or the error of their ways. If B is illogiral or wrong, by bringing it l'orth for dis­cussion we can refute it, thus mak­ing us cling morn Lightly Lo that trun idea /\.. tr we never hear B in a context where we can determine that it is false, then we stand more likely to be shaken by a weak argument for B. By acknowledging and discussing B, the soul will rest confident knowing that it has seen the opposition and its corrupting capabilities, and yet, the truth of A still remains. 
But. what if A is wrong! Simply citing an authority (here the Church, but the point applies broadly} does not make it correct. History is littered with the bodies of absolutely, 100 percent right, obvious, self-evident ideas that were provr,n wrong and discarded. In such a case, B might serve to help us revise our own beliefs so that they are more correct. It is presumptuous to behave as though one has a monopoly on truth, when so ol'ten that has been shown to be false. /\nd, when, as Sean Vinck assorts, immortal souls hang in the balance, you'd best be cer­tain that what you teach is absolutnly perfect before you· exdude all other ideas. 
Now, such a position as I have detailed above does not mean that I consichir all opinions equally cor­rect or worthy. 1bnlicve some things are right and others wrong. Rut allowing the proposition, explanation, or defcn!>e or a con­trary idea does not imply that you condone what it says. I believe then, that discussion, examinati.on and cv111 dissedion of ideas leads eventually Lo the synthesis of a new, bntter idea that mav well be the elusivn truth l'or whi(;h we all search. In that, freedom of speech contains its own intrinsic value.

Ticket tab needs to be trimmed 
From a studnnt who has lived his life right outside of Philadelphia and always was able to easily take advantage of all that a large (and culturally active) had to offer, I was a little dismayed coming out to South Bend to go to school. I don't Pven think about that any more, though, except in one case. The case of concerts. 
l frequented the many large names that routinely stopped in Philadelphia and in the neighboring metropolitan areas of the east coast. Names likP. Billy Joel, the Dave MaUhnws Band and Lilith Fair were within 20 minutes ofhomo. They were not only tra11sportalio11a!ly convenient, but also linancially convenient. Tir,kP,ts to such ernnts usually ran $30-35 for shows in real­ly grnat settings. Even smaller shows, like the PP-nn's Landing riverfront fost featuring bands such as Fastball and Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, would be only $10 or so for an all day event. 
Since I have been out in South Bend. though. the closest concerts are in Chicago. This, however, is a problem for a student who has no car, is not at all familiar to Chicago, and doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg for a concert. Imagine my excite­ment, then, when I heard that Elton John would be playing solo at the JACC' 
Determined to get tickets to this great event, I dragged myself out of bed at 7:30 on a Friday morning to guarantee that I would get a ticket. However, as I rode my bike along with about $40 in my pocket for the ticket (The price was not advertised in The Observer ads), I pulled up to the ticket gate at the JACC. My face, though, dropped when I saw that decent seats for the con­cert were $60! Now, I am not above paying for such a great performer, and if they want to charge that much and still can sell the JACC out, which will likely happen, then more power to them. 
However, from a student's pnrspnctivn, I was so surprised to seP. this exorbitant price for tickets. I do not know who is prn!"lenling the funding for the concert and what con­nection the University has with th<' concert. Maybe we only leased out the .IACC to make some money, which is what I am guessing would havB happened. But I am reminclnd of last year's Third Eye Blind concnrt. That was a great experience, a great conc~irt with two pretty popular bands, within walk­ing distance and for undnr $30. Even Acrosmith was around $40, which was around the price of Dob Dylan. 
Now, I am not saying that. them is any­thing wrong with the Elton John concert. I just want to offer up a proposal for thn University, and maybe they'll listen. 
Why nol make such a great concert more accessible to students'! Find some way to make thn tickets cheap onough that tlrn stu­dents can l.ake advantage of the biggest musical event to come this way that I've ever heard of. Maybe even offer student tickets. lley, it's a start. But when l sec a big performer like the Dave Matthews Band brought to campus to play for TIIE STU­DENTS that doesn't cost us the equivalent of almost a third of a semester in flex points. half of our season tickets, our math books, or two months of laundry service. then I will be totally thrilled with not only the University's choice but also the University's commitment lo bringing a little something extra to the students and doesn't try to make a buck off of them.

Do something you enjoy, don't work for money 
I read Mary Beth Eilis's piece about grad­
uate school in the Viewpoints section and I 
would like to offer an alternative view. As a Domer, I can remember the panic that set in during the spring of '83. With my psychology degree and my whopping 2.65 GPA I was neither a candidate for a high paying entry level gig nor a prime graduate school slot. What made it worse was watching all my engineer and accounting buddies getting offers left and right (at the high paying 1483 rate of $20,000). I wanted to 
be a counselor 
but shuddered 
at making $5 per 
hour in an entry 
level human services 
job Instead I tried a couple of business jobs 
and hated it. Eventually, I 
took a child care worker job that paid $4.65 per hour. At night, I went to 
local grad school. It look a few years, but with experience I became the clinical director and then exec­
utive director of addiction treatment pro­
gram. I made a decent buck and eventually 
took a promotion to work in hospital devel­
opment. My point isn't to say what a cool guy I am. The point I'm trying to make is that if there's something you want to do, go do it. Work hard, keep at it and money and the rnst will come. Not all majors provide for immediate job access. Some disci­plines take experience and pay less. Thero was area­son why you chose to study
Ii It what you
r did. There's more to life than making 
cash and making it right away. Do what you're 
intnrnsted in and work hard. Avoid "keeping up with the Jones" it sets up a precedent for unhappiness.

Must-See TV's days are numbered 
By PATRIC[A McHALE Scene Writer 
For the last five years, NBC has been guaranteed a solid night of loyal teJevision viewership e'.1ch Thursday night. Traditionally, their Thursday-mght lineup, wisely entitled Must-SeeTV, has been just that -a solid three hours of programming that sus­tained a following while attracting new devotees. 
Originally, "Friends," "Seinfeld" and "ER," alo~1g with two other sitcoms of the season thrown m for good measurn, were unbeatablP by other networks. Despite their best efforts, CBS, ABC and fox were never able to topple the powerhouse. 
No matter how many rip-offs they produced, from an endless barrage of "friends"-themed comedies tu nitty-gritty, real-life dramas, the riva_l netwoi:-ks' attempts always failed. Somehow, their stars Just did not have the right haircuts or their shows the right theme songs to make it. 
Now, with the departure of "Seinfeld" two years ago and the ever-increasing monotony of the remaining series, the competition may finally get its chance to steal the rug out from under NBC. 
Last Thursdav night signaled the start of another season of Thursday n'ight television. "friends" returned to its usual 8 p.m. timeslot. "Frasier," being the closest thing to a "Seinfeld" -type program that NBC could find after the latter signed off the air for good, also reclaimed the 9 p.m. position in the middle of the lineup. 
"ER" was absent for the night of premieres so that the network could introduce its new hopeful, "The Third Watch," and grab the attention of those view­ers that neglected to check TV Guide before tuning in for the nigllt. The plan, which usually is a suc­cessful one, entails sneaking a new show into anoth­er popular program's time-slot; so that hopefully the established audience will be too lazy to change the channel or do something else productive. Therefore, the network has established a following in one effortless swoop. 

In the two other less-hyped slots, "Jesse" and the new sitcom, "Stark Raving Mad", made their season pre­mieres. The 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. locations, despite their lead-ins,. tend to get the lowest ratings. This is why it is not surprising to see NBC play musi­cal chairs with its programming. 
Past shows that have called these timeslots home include ''Suddenly Susan'· and "Veronica's Clnset." Both have sinre been relocated to other nights, and both have lost a majority of their viewers. 
Though the progrnms have survived nonetheless, other sitcoms have fa.red worse. Forgot.ten programming includes "The Single Guy" and "The Naked Truth," which both disintegrat­ed after losing the coveted Thursday night locations. Once placed on a ran­dom night of the week, their ratings Photo courtesy of NBC slipped so dramatically that the net­The cast of "Frasier" made its season debut last Thursday. 

the end, though without the ceremony to make it official. With all these couplings, it is inevitable that the two remaining friends, Phoebe and Joey, will eventually pair off. Though this was the obvious intention of' the show from the very beginning, several more breakups and reconciliations must take place in order for the network to milk as much as it can from the show. 
NBC is already paying each of the six co-stars a pretty penny, so it is obvious that it has a lot invested in the success of the show. Only time will tell if their investment will pay off. 
On "Jesse," the title character, who refused a proposal from last season's love Diego, moves on with her life. She decides to go back to nursing school, accept a job as a nurse's aide in an infir­mary and take care of her young son. Photo cou~esy of NBC However, her duties begin to become too Neil Patrick Harris stars in the new comedy, "Stark Raving Mad." much for her as she questions her ability 
works removed them from the sched­ule all together. 
Every summer, while most people vacation and forget their troubles, television writers rack their brains to come up with new storylines to keep the shows interesting and unpredictable. What they came up with this season does not exactly fit those categories, particularly the unpredictability aspect. 
On "Friends," the entire gang continues its adven­ture in Las Vegas, where they went to meet up with Joey in the May's season finale. Of course, Monica and Chandler, having actually sustained a relation­ship for an entire year, consider eloping in one of the chapels, but discover that Ross and Rachel, in a drunken haze, have beaten them to it. When they sober up and realize what they have done, they have mixed reactions. 
Ross does not want to get a divorce, even if their actions were hasty, because he already has two 
failed marriages behind him. Meanwhile, 
Monica and Chandler stay together in to be everywhere al once, 
By the end of the premiere, she has become empowered again, realizing that she can accomplish anvthing if she puts her mind to it. She also reunites with Diego after he returns from refusing a job relo­cation. 
Christina Applegate, the show's star, has never been able to capture the same allure as her "friends" counterparts. The introduction of new supporting character Kurt, an extremely cynical registered nurse at the infirmary, may provide the much-needed comic relief to sustain the show for a little while. 
During an unusual episode of "Frasier," the good doctor becomes involved with a woman that bears a striking resemblance to his late mother.. Of course, he and his brother begin to analyze this choice in psychological terms. Not surprisingly, the relation­ship dissolves by the end of the half hour, leaving him a single man ... again. 
In the only comedy series premiere of the night, "Stark Raving Mad," a book editor is assigned to work under the famed-but-blocked horror novelist Ian Stark. The writm· is extremely eccentric and standoffish, while his editor is quite phobic and compulsive. Though the two clash in the beginning, it is obvious that their partnership will be beneficial to them both. Their opposite natures are catise for comedy, though it is difficult to tell this from the pilot. 
Though "ER" did not air, its absence is not the sole reason why the Must-See TV concept is slipping. All the shows are becoming a little too contrived at this point, a common side-effect of programming that is written exclusively for vicwership. 
Between the high price NBC is paying to keep the stars of its three big programs, "friends," "Frasier" and "ER" happy, and the departure ofbig stars from "ER," namely George Clooney, the network is at its most vulnerable. Most likely, rival networks also will sense, and capitalize on NBC's weakness. The Thursdays may he numbered for this former power­house.

SOAP OPERA COLUMN 

Hope Williams and Princess Gina (both played by Kritian Alfonso) will meet this week on "Days of Our Lives." 
'Days' builds up to Paris climax 
By COLLEEN WEIGEL 
Sane Writer 
The past week of "Days of Our Lives" has be1111 based on two days of real time as it has centtired mainly on the Ili,pe/Gina/Bo storyline in Paris. Ilope is CUlTl'ntly alternating between lmr Princess Gina pPrsona and her true sell', as she has dmw for tho last year. by "becoming" l'rinc.t)SS Cina with l'rincnss Gina's memories and ,~motions. 
llut al'l.lff lrnr parnnts Doug and Julici arrived 
in Paris. Ilope !rngan to remember her own 
past. Now il is up to lwr to keep up her cha­
rndt~ as Princc!ss Gina to keep Stefano from 
gPlling suspicious about her intentions. 
In a mrwling with Std'ano, they talk about their plan of stealing the last Herrnt again. Stefano says this will prove bor loyalty to him. But rnally. how many tinrns does she nocd to provri lrnr loyalty'? 
J\f'icr she gets tlrn last Benet, Stefano has promised her thn !'rendom to live her lifo as l'rincnss Gina. Slrn leavns Stefano to get back to llo, nrnanwhilc continuing to havB inter­twining nwmori1is of Ilope's and Gina's past. Upon IH'r return, Bo, like Stefano, promises to prnt1ict lwr. 
They tlH!n all get ready for the party in l'rinrnss Gina's honor. What none of them know is that tho real Princess Gina is lurking, planning to attend the party. The ma! princess plans to go as Kurl's mother. Clearly. them will lw some kind ol' run-in between Princess Cina and I lope at the party. What will hap­
p!!ll'.' 
Tim rPal Gina rnp<iatedly says that she will gnt lwr rnvongo aga.inst StPl'ano for stnaling so many years from hPr, so a heatNI confronta­tion is incvitubln. 
Elsl'whnr11 in Paris, Eric and Greta also pre­par<' ln go to tlw party, while trying to i.;on­viuw .John lo attnnd tlw party. Unlike John of y11swryPar, though. Im dons not want to intnr­forP in bringing Std'ano down. 
Gr1ta. in an ironic but typical soap opera twist, contirHws to whinP about how slw can't bnlinvn Urnt hor mothnr is dead. What 1wery­011n knows. though. is thal tlw real Princess Gina is rnully in tho samo housn in a secret room. 
Fri.c and Crnt.11 IMvn !'or the 1rn.rty, and Cireta cxprnssns her conc(Jrll about being able to go alo11g wilh the charade of µrctending that !lope is lwr motlrnr. They arrivP at the party and am w<dcorned by the Duchess and the llukP. Unknown to c;rntu and Eric. PrincP.ss Gina arrivt:s with Kurt in a not-so-convincing disguisn. Most liktlly, "Kurt's motlrnr" will attract morn attention with tlrn veil that is cov­
ering her whole face. 
As the real Princess Gina approaches Stefano, one must wonder why he does not recognize Princess Gina's voice, considering that Hope and Gina supposedly have the same voice. But perhaps the veil is more of a dis­guise than a smart person would have Lhought. 
Meanwhile, llope is dressed for the party, 
ready for Bo to introduce llopc as Princess 
Gina Von Ambert to her parents. 
Is it really Hope or Gina? It is hard to tell. Julie asks her if she is all right, and Hope says, "Of course." Bo then looks into Hope's eyes and reminds her that he loves her and that she should always remember Hope Williams. 
13ack in Salem, nothing important is going on. Sami and Lucas, Salem's parents-of-the­year, battle it out when Lucas confronts Sarni about a letter Nicole found, revealing Sami's deliberate attempt to keep him from attending Will's first day of school. Sarni basically denies the truth until she confesses -something that occurs often in the soap opera world. 
This of course makes her look like a liar to Austin, and everyone knows how Austin feels about liars. Thus, he leaves 'to go box at the gym, which makes Sarni fear that she has lost her chance with Austin. But when did she ever have one'? 
At the gym, Austin runs into -surprise ­Carrie. She wants to talk about the charity­boxing match and who his opponent should be. lie discards the majority of the candidates saying they will be too easy, but one must ask when the last time it was when he boxed in a professional boxing match. It is simply illogi­cal. 
Just before this confrontation, by the way. Carrie had been talking to Marlena about the !'act that she misses Austin. 
Can she ever make up her mind about who she loves'? J\.like or Austin'? She refuses to allow Austin to move on with his life with SamL but realistically, Carrie doesn't. have a choico. Sho is the one who clrnated on him. The choice twist would be for Sarni and Austin to Onally be together, mainly because Austin is stupid to believP. that Sarni can turn over a now leaf. 
Sarni also ltas a similar conversation with Marlena. in which she expnisses conrnrn that Carrie will convince Austin that she has rnturned to her evil ways. Is anyone else sick or thosn two sisters fighting over Austin? It has been at least three years' 
ElsewlwrP. in Salem, John returns honrn to Marlena. and they celebrate. What do they have to cnlebrato about? This io all they do. 
The big Friday clil'f11anger was Hope arriving 
a.t the party. Let the party begin. 
'Roswell' is alien to teen TV 
-----, 
By CHRIS ROBERTS Associated Press Writer 
ALBUQUEHQUE, N.M. 
Imagine you're a teen-ager and you don't know who your parents 
arc or where you came from. That's a ton of teen angst. 
It wa..c;n't enough for the creators of "Roswell," who have upped the ante. So, imagine all the above plus une more thing -you're an alien. 
But, rather than relying on the "Star Wars" approach of fantastic 
creatures and cutting-edge special effects, "Roswell" (premiering 8 
p.m. tonight on the WB) is a star-crossed teen-age love story with an otherworldly twist. 
The show is scheduled in the slot that follows the popular 
"Dawson's Creek" and matches the teen appeal of WB shows like 
"13ufiy the Vampire Slayer." 
"It is a wonderful metaphor for teen-age alienation," said executive producer and script writer Jason Katims ("My So-Called Life"). "As teen-agers, we all feel like aliens and some of us as adults (feel that way) too." 
While the show may be saving money on special effects, it is spend­ing some on the music. Tunes from such alternative bands as Eagle Eye Cherry, Dave Matthews, Garbage and Sarah Mclachlan are strategically placed in the pilot to accent the emotion ofthe moment. 
Set in Roswell, N.M., but filmed near Los Angeles with Roswell Daily Record newspapers in the racks, "Roswell" borrows heavily from the fabled high­desert crash of a UFO. It is sure to attract, at least for a while, the hard-core believers who think the U.S. government is still covering up the details of that crash. 

-
Three alien teens -who look human, but later reveal they can "change molecular structures" -came from an incubator on board the space­craft. Two of them, Max Evans (Jason Behr, who has appeared on "Dawson's Creek") and Isabel Evans (Katherine Heigl), were found walking naked along the road as small children and adopted by a loving family. 
The third, Michael Guerin (Brendan Fehr), was adopted by a man who "just keeps me around for the monthly check." 
The story begins with the Photo courtesy of the WB apparent death of teen-ager Jason Behr and Isabel Evans Liz Parker (Shiri Appleby). sta · th WB' "R 11 " 
Liz, a waitress at her rm e s oswe · father's diner, the Crashdown Cafe, is accidentally shot in the stom­ach when an argument between two patrons erupts into a struggle over a gun. Max risks revealing himself and his friends when he heals the gun­shot wound with a touch that leaves a silver palm print. He breaks a bottle of ketchup, smears it on Parker and tells her not to tell anyone what happened. It's the beginning of an impossible relationship. As Max reveals more of himself to Liz, he performs a mind meld that allows Liz to see the world through his eyes. This is an act of trust the alien teens believe could have deadly consequences She sees herself as well. "I could feel everything he felt, I could feel his loneliness," Liz says. "In his eyes I was beautiful." Some of the lines are cutely corny, and the incubator birth is never fully explained, but enjoying science fiction normally takes a suspen­sion of disbelief. Tongue-in-check humor that includes a few low-key special effects is intended to keep sci-fl fans from slipping into love-story ennui. Michael and Isabel chastiso Max for risking everything by saving Liz. "You use your p.owers all the time," Max says to Isabel. "Ilccreationaly," Isabel responds as shn melts .the cheese on hnr taco. Appleby says the new episodes will focus more on the threat of cap­ture. The alien teens establish in the first episode that tlrny believe they arr. in a life-and-death situation, avoiding government agents who will spirit them to a lab and dissect them. The suspicious sheriff (William Sadler of '.'The Sha.wshank Redemption") has personal reasons for digging out tlrn truth. llis father was a law enforcement utliccr in 1959 whon a body was found bearing a similar silver hand print. When he tries to report the incident at the cafe to a federal agent, he is met with skepticism and the warning, "Do you know what evriryone at the agency called your father? Sgt. Martian." The earnestly delivered lines help give the wrong-side-of-the-Milky Way love story and other plot twists a veneer of realism. "We don't want it to turn into 'My Favorite Martian,"' said executive producer Jonathan Frakes ("Star Trek: The Next Generation"), who makes a camP.O appearance in the pilot. "We're taking it Sf1riously." ·

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Swank: Tennessee's academic fraud could be serious 
Associated Press 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. 
Tennessee faces harsh penal­ties if academic fraud alloga­tiuns are proved, however, for­feiting its 1998 national football title would not bfl one of them, a former NCAA official said Tuesday. 
"Academic fn.md is one of the more serious violations because it really goes to the whole heart of the student-athlete and the athletic program," said David Swank, immediate past chair­man of the NCAA's Committee on Infractions. 
"Now, obvious1y you have dif­fernnt degrnes of fraud," said Swank, a law professor at the University of Oklahoma. 
New Mexico State, Michigan State, Texas Tech, Miami and Minnesota have all been hit with allPgations of academic viola­tions iu recent years. Penalties have incl.uded NCAA probation and loss of scholarships. 
Although the NCAA has with­drawn championships from schools that violate rules ­such as the UCLA women's soft­ball champions in 1995 ­Swank noted the national foot­bal1 title is created by the schools and howl games and "is not an NCAA championship." 
So Tennessee's 1998 football crown would not be affected, "regardless of what wonld hap­pen," he said. 
ThP NCAA. is aware of the alle­gations at Tennessee but has not started a formal investigation. Meantime, Tennessee has start­eu an· internal probe into whether tutors did schoolwork for athletes. 
Carl Asp, Tennessee's faculty athletics representative si.nce 1992, said the investigation could take several weeks and will be thorough. 
"We would like iL over in a day. But that is nnt rnalistic, is it?'' said Asp, a speech professor and principal in the university's intf'rnal review. 
Chancellor Bill Snyder said his concerns go beyond sports. 
"Academic dishonesty and plagiarism, if that is verified, we take a very strong position on that,'' he said. "Regardless of who is involved ... whether stu­dent-athletes or not." 
ESPN has reported that inter­nal memos show high-level administrators in UT's athletic department were told four tutors might have done school­work for at least five_unidcnti­fied football players, a baseball player and a female athletP. Three of the football players have transferred. 
None of this information was passed on to campus authorities charged with investigating pos­sible rules infractions, university officials say. 
ESPN quoted a 1997 memo from Linda_ Bensel-Meyers, director for composition in the English department, to the Faculty Senate alleging prob­lems in 1995 with freshmen athletes. 
She wrote that "several of these athletes submitted papers that were either co­written or entirely written by tutors" hired by tlrn athletics department. These athletes "claimed they had been told bv their tutors that thi.s sort of intervention was accept­able,·· she wrote. 
"The acts of plagiarism appeared to be institutionally mandated by the athletic department," wrote Bensel­Mcyers, who failed to return calis for comment Tuesday. 
Mark Mil]er, immediate past presi<lent of the Faculty Senate, said he never heard about the allegations before ESPN reporte<l them. 
ESPN also reported that rnligious studies professor Dan Deffenbaugh suspected in 1993 that about one-third of the papers turned in by football players were plagia­rized in some form. 
Deffenbaugh, who now teaches at Lyon College in Arkansas, said this week he was satisfied with the ath­letic department's efforts to address the problem, which included more frequently

Irish schedule rated ninth most difficult 
Special to the Observer 
Based on NCAA statistics including all games through Sept. 25, Notre Dame's 1999 foot­ball schedule ranks as the ninth toughest in the country to this point in the season. 
Notre Dame's '99 opponents have jointly compiled a 25-11 record (.694) against other Division I-A foes other than the lrish. 
Notre Dame's past opposition has been particu­larly strong at 9-2 (.818), with Oklahoma on Saturday mark­ing the fifth straight opponent in '99 that has met the lrish without a loss on its record. 
Since the NCAA began its toughest schedule rankings in

Sosa hits 62nd against Phillies 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA 
Sammy Sosa hit his 62nd home run Tuesday night, regaining his lead on Mark McGwire and passing Roger Maris' mystical old mark for the second straight season. 
Sosa, who had not homered since Sept. 19 against Milwaukee, hit a two-run homer to left on the first pitch from Philadelphia rookir, Anthony Shumaker in the ninth to make it 8-2. He became the first player in history to surpass 61 homers in consecutive sea­sons. 
Sosa was in an 0-for-9 slump and was 8-for-40 in the past 11 games. He played Tuesday after receiving news that his wife, Sonia, had been hospital­ized in Chicago. 
Sonia Sosa, 25, was released from the hospital after being admitted to the emergency room following a mysterious reaction to prescription med­ication. Sosa said his wife had been taking medicine for her menstrual cycle.

SANT A CLARA, Calif. 
Steve Young's latest concus­sion after a frightening hit sent him to a neurologist on Tuesday and left the San Francisco 49ers wondering about the futnre ot' Lheir star quarterback. 
Coach St1>.ve Mariucci said during a news confercncn that Young underwent an MRI and was going over the results with the neurologist. Tho outcome of Lhe examination was not avail­abli>. 
Mariucci said that he spoke with Young earlier in the day. 
"lie seemed to be OK. HP seemed to be liue. Weore hope­ful that heoll be able to go this week," Mariucci said. 
But the coach didn't rul11 out the possibility of holding him out against Tennessee on Sunday as a precaution, fwen if hP's cleared rnerlir.ally to play. 
"Obviously, if something shows up on thf1 MRI, the deci­sion will be easy," Mariucci said. 
Mariucci also raise<l the possi­bility that Young, who has a his­tory of concussions. might r,on­sider retirement if advised to do so by doctors. 
"I really don't know that that's on his mind just yet," Mariucci said. "But he may be in a situa­tion right now where he would be more receptive tu that. Obviouslv, the main considera­tion is Stti,e's health. That's the A No. 1 consideration." 
Young lost consciousness for several sernnds after the head­snapping hit in Mon<lay nightos 24-10 Yictory at Arizona. Ile loft the game with just seconds remaining in the second quarter and didnot return. 
Trying to dodge pressure, Young instPad caught the full force of a hit from bliizing cor­nerback Aeneas Williams. The violent blow knocked Young backward, and as he fell, his head hit tackle Dave Piorn's leg before smashing against the ground. 
Young lay motionless on tlw l'icld with his eyes shut, and tacklP. Derrick Deese tugged at his jersey to try to help him up. When there was no immediate

Undefeated No. ·11 f'urdue against undefeated No. 4 Michigan looks, and is, a huge game. Yet Purdue coach Joe Tiller said it's not the biggest in his turn­around of the Boiler­m a k er s program. 
That dis­tinction rests with a victory over Notre Dame in 1997, Tiller's first year at Purdue. 
"In '97 when we were able to beat Notre Dame after Purdue had lost to them for a dozen or more years in a row. That was a huge game for the program. and will probably go down as maybe the game that allowed us to kind of springboard into the future," Tiller said Tuesday. 
"From that standpoint, 
1 
[Saturday's] game is not the biggest that we've played in," he said. 
Purdue and Michigan both are 4-0 and 1-0 in the Big Ten. For Purdue, it marks the start of' a challenging string of games that continues with games against No. 12 Ohio top-ranked Seminoles 31-24 fol 

lowing a we,~k off. 
A year ago, the Irish capital­ized on their two bye-weeks with victories over Purdue and Arizona State. 
While the open date has given Davie a chance to work with his players and coaches, the rnal test comes Saturday. 
"We will know a lot better on Saturday afternoon how the open date went," said Davie, "but I think it came as a good time for this football team. I think we addressed some prob­lems we had and we arc a bet· tor team because of it."

been pretty good before." 
In recent memory, the Irish have had success in games fol­lowing bye-weeks. 
In this decade, Notre Dame is 9-1 after a week off. The lone defeat came in 1994 to Florida St.ate. Aftnr heating Navy 58-21, the Irish had a week to regroup before heading to Tallahassee on Nov. 12.

"This is an unbelievable stretch," Tiller said. "It will be a real test for us. but I think we've got to lighten up and enjoy the moment, the oppor­tunity to play this level or cal­iber of competition.... That's a dif'ficult draw for anybody, but that's the way the schedule has been set, so we plan on being there." 
Purdue is playing Michigan and Ohio State back-to-back on the road, two teams it hasn't played since Tiller brought his spread offense from Wyoming. 
Tiller sees a Michigan team that has changed its offensive philosophy away l'rom one that was dominated by a potent ground game. Statistics prove the assessment. Michigan is averaging 117.8 yards per game rushing and 223.8 pass­ing. 
"I don't see them attempting to rush as much as they have in the past. I see some differ­ent formations out of Michigan," Tiller said. "There's a lot of one-back stuff showing up, people spread out. I don't remember those formations at /\nn Arbor. I think thnir offense is diversified .... When I look at their overall physical scheme, it's set to throw the ball to big, physical wide receivers."

The McGlinn Shamrocks enter tonight's battle against Breen­Phillips looking for its first win. 
The Shamrocks, after battling Badin to a scoreless tie on Sunday, are 0-1-2, and feature a dominant defensive unit led by standout senior Bridget O'Connor, who anchors the defensive line. 
"We haven't allowed a point defensively in our last two games," '.VlcGlinn captain Jana Poscharsky said. "Our defensive line has played really well." 
Breen-Phillips will look to remain undefeated and unscored upon. The Babes have outscored their first two oppo­nents 26-0. 
With both teams boasting a strong defense, the talented BP offense should give the advan­tage to the Babes. 
indicative of the defense ­they're more indicative or a change in strategy and push­ing more people forward and taking risks in the hopes of scoring. That strategy worked against Connecticut when we scored with less than two min­utes to tie the game and we tried to do it again in California but it didn't work." 
The Irish need to start putting balls in the net if they plan to get back on track in the second half of tho season. The Irish devoted much of their preseason practice to solidify­ing the defense, but have since shifted gears to focus on devel­oping a more potent attack. 
The Irish look to  unleash  
that  attack  on  Eastern  
Michigan tonight.  

The Eagles, coming in with a 4-4-0 record, find their offense force in forward Max Sulla. Sulla. a powerhouse on attack, has tallied thrne of the team's eight goals and one assist on the season.

Notre Dame re-energizes for Oklahoma in bye-lVeek 
By TIM CASEY Spam Writer 
Thus far this season. Irish players have been chastised as not being able to win close games. Bob Davie's play-calling and <:0aching ability has been criticized. Allcgalions of academic fraud and possible NCM violations have called into question boundaries never heforn crossed in Irish historv. 
But for a· week, at least, the Irish could forget
-
about the distractions and set their sights on the rest of the season. 
''J think this open date really did come at a good time," Davie said at Tuesday's press confer­ence. "It can be beMficial to our football team." 
'Most weeks' emphasis is set on preparing for Saturday's opponent, but last week gave Davie and his staff a chance to work with players indi­vidually. Instead of worrying about Drew Brees or the Michigan defense. Davie was able to focus the attention on skill development and basir. technique. 
"It gave us a chance to practice without worry­ing about a game plan,"Davie said. "So much of what you do in college football these days is try­ing to match up and trying to keep up with your opponent. 
"Last week, we had a lot of time to spend just on individual technique and individual funda­mentals. I think we really needed that as a foot­ball team,"he added. 
Davie also stressed tbe importance that the off­week had on resting coaches and players -both physically and emotionally. 
Recharging for Oklahoma 
Two contributors on offense will return this week against Oklahoma. Tailback Tony Driver, who suffered a torn left shoulder muscle and flanker Joey Getherall (right shoulder separation against Purdue) will both look to add a spark to the offense. 
On defense. safety Ron Israel (right ankle sprain against Purduel and Ronnie Nicks (left ankle sprain against Michigan) are likely to be back for Saturday.

INTERHALL FOOTBALL 'Chaotic' match-up set for tonight 
By KEVIN BERCHOU Sports Writer 
The Cavanaugh Chaos enter tonight's game against Badin on the heels of a thrilling 8-6 victo­ry over the women of Farley. 
The Chaos will look to mount a win streak nn the strengi.h of a strong, "chaotic" defense led by Meghan Rhatigan and Heather Hoffman, whose interception 
.. and return of a Farley convf'r­sion attempt provided the win­ning margin on Sunday. "We hope to continue playing strong defense," Chaos captain Melissa Tacey said. "Then we'll look to try to move the ball a bit 
better on offense." 
Badin enters the matchup looking for its first win. The ladies of Badin are extremely strong on the defensiw, side of the ball, having shutout McG!inn in a scoreless game Sunday to improve to 0-1-1. 
The offense appears to need work and Badin will need to move the football if they are going to knock off the Chaos.
