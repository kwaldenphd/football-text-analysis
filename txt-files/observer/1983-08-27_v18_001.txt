Students must show proof of draft status to obtain federal aid 
By BOB VONDERHEIDE 
News Editor 
Students receiving federal finan­cial aid have until Oct. 1 to submit a form stating they have complied with Selective Service laws. 
Failure to sign the form will force the financial aid office to reverse the credit of federal assistance dispersed after July 1, according to Financial Aid Director Joe Russo. 
The new rule is the result of a two-sentence law that easily passed through Congress last year. The Education Department originally set July 1 as the deadline for sub­mitting the form, but financial-aid directors complained of too little time to handle the paper work. 
A month ago, the Education Department moved the deadline to Sept. I, but this week the depart­ment again extended the deadline one montP.. to Oct. 1. 
Under the law, male students between the ages of 18 and 22 will have to submit a form to the Office of Financial Aid stating that they have registered with the Selective Service. 
Female students receiving or ap­plying for federal assistance after July 1 will have to check the line stating, "I am female." Women are

...... 
not required to register with the Selective Service. Students born before 1960 will have to indicate that fact on the form. 
But being a "conscientious objec­tor" is not listed as a reason for fail­ing to register. Conscientious­objector status is recognized as a legal reason not to be drafted into military service. 
Except for additional paper work, Russo said the new law "is not a problem at Notre Dame," where about half the students receive federal aid -especially from the Guaranteed Student Loan pro­gram. 
Of the forms already submitted to the financial-aid office, no male student has refused to register. That means no aid will have to be denied, Russo said. 
The federal aid programs linked to students' registration status are: the GSL, the Pell Grant, the Work/Study program, the Na­tional Direct Student Loan and the Supplemental Education Oppor­tunity Grant. 
The original language of the law mandated that the forms signed by the students would have to be • verified against Selective Service records. But the law did not say whether the federal government or

Freshman orientation begins 
More diverse events added to program at Saint Mary's 
By ANNE MONASTRYSKI 
Saint Mary's Editor 
For whatever the. reason, and several were offered, 476 women are now Saint Mary's freshmen. 
"Notre Dame and the football team" attracted freshman Coquis Casavantes to Saint Mary's from El Paso, Texas. For freshman Tracy Caulfield of Grand Beach, Mich., it was the "beautiful campus." Saint Mary's "reputation as an all-around good school" and its "small classes," said Chris Schanne of Omaha, Neb., was the deciding factor for her. 
Enrollment is up one student from last year's 475 

students. 
Orientation week begins today for the Class of 

1987, providing general campus information and first 
impressions. 
In an effort to make Saint Mary's Oeientation 1983 a well-rounded program," and to "set the tone for the year," more educational and informative events were added to the list of activities, said orientation General Chairperson, Julie Strazzabosco. 
Complaints that previous orientation programs have been too lopsided -stressing social or cultural events more than other aspects of campus life -pro­mpted the additions, said Strazzabosco. 
One of the educational additions is the Nutrition 

Education program, a project designed to deal with 
Bulemia and other eating disorders becoming 
prevalent on college campuses. 
A Relationship and Sexuality series begins Sept. 8, and will integrate Christian values with decision mak­ing in relationships. 
A new social activity, a pre-dance party, will be in the Haggar College Center for both Saint Mary's and Notre Dame freshmen before the annual ACC dance tomorrow. Thw party will be the first major function in the new facility, according to Strazzabosco. 
"We want to take the emphasis off the 'party' at­mosphere," said Strazzabosco. "We don't want the flow (of Saint Mary's students) to go over there (Notre Dame)," she added. 
"Participation is vital to the success of orientation
' 

said Strazzabosco. I want to stress that freshmen take advantage of the program. If freshmen are willing to participate, we'll come through for them."

At ND, greater percentage of accepted students enroll 
ByPATSAIN 
Copy Editor 
An improved economy has caused more applicants to accept admission offers to Notre Dame despite the $8,660 price tag. 
Director of Admissions John Goldrick said about 6,300 students applied to Notre Dame this year, and 2;soo were accepted. 
Goldrick said the ratio of students who are accepted to the University to the number who enroll as freshmen has improved. 
A better economy has enabled more students to af­ford the cost of a private education, he said. 
The 1,775 freshmen at Notre Dame begin two days of orientation today, followed by registration on Monday at Stepan Center. During registration, students will receive their schedules, have I.D. photos taken and fix any scheduling problems. 
Goldrick said the 1,775 figure was set by the PACE report -a document released last year that analyzes the University's goals for the 1980s. The figure takes into account about 30 expected "no-shows," where students accept admission offers but do not show up to register. 
"This class reflects the good years of the last decade," said Goldrick. "Thirty-five percent of the in­coming freshmen are in the top five of their high school class, an many of them are quite accomplished in many areas." 
The student Freshman Orientation staff, which ar­rived Thursday and Friday, is profiding picnics, dances, social hours and other services for freshmen. 
Each residence hall also has an orientation staff which has planned activities for the new students. The hall-orientation staff members are essential in getting freshmen settled into place before classes get under­
way,  supplying  transpsortation,  information,  and  
friendhsip.  
Freshmen  reported  yesterday  to  begin  taking  

guidance tests used by the Freshman Year, and to take placement tests for course credit. 
Emil T. Hofman, dean of the Freshman Year of Studies, said the freshmen are encouraged to be open and friendly, and not to remain isolated. 
There are 250 transfer students thisyear, down con­siderably from 390 last year. There are few "no­shows" with transfer students, Goldrick said, because "they really want to come her."

Housing Shortages 
ND uses study 
lounges to relieve 
campus demand 
By VIC SCIULLI 
Assistant News Editor 
An unusually high number of room reservations this year means only one thing to 34 freshmen: tem­porary housing.

and Flanner halls. 
Father Michael Heppen, director of housing, said that the study lounges will be restored as soon as other rooms on campus become available. 
Heppen said that the 94 female and 136 male transfer students awaiting on-campus housing will be taken care of after all the freshmen are placed in regular rooms. 
Heppen said he does not like the idea of taking the study lounges away from the students, but he con­siders it a better idea than a housing lottery. 
The lottery was averted last April when Student Government Hous­ing Commissioner Jorge Valencia suggested that study lounges in some of the women's dorms and in Flahner and Grace halls be used as dorm rooms. 
Off-campus Housing Director Brother John Campbell said that although there is still a waiting list for the Campus View and Turtle Creek apartment complexes, there is an ample supply of apartments available in other areas.

19 freshmen in dorm parlors at Saint Mary's 
By ANNE MONAS1YRSKI 
Saint Mary's Editor 

A housing shortage has forced 19 Saint Mary's freshmen to live tern· porarily in dorm parlors, leaving other residents with almost no recreational space. 
McCandless' basement will house nine students, six will stay in the LeMans guest rooms and four will be placed in one of Holy Cross' three parlors until permanent housing becomes available. 
Last year eight students Jived in all of Holy Cross' parlors, and one par· lor served as temporary housing un· til second semester. 
"It's monetarily better for the College to fiJI to capacity," said Director of Residence Ufe Pat Ris· smeyer. "A lot ofpeople like to come to Saint Mary's. Unlike several col­leges in the country Saint Mary's is not underenrolled and we don't want to discourage students from coming." 
This year only freshmen were guaranteed housing. "We told a number of students that we don't have space," said Rissmeyer. 
Rissmeyer said the College will have to wait to see how many stu· dents withdraw before deciding when freshmen will get permanent housing and when recreational areas will become available.

A lawyer's primary goal should be to "keep client out of court," Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Warren Burger, told a Notre Dame audience in London this summer. 
Speaking at a July dinner dedicating the University's London Law Center, Burger said lawyers should return to their role as the healers rather than the warriors of society. 
"Other methods must be used to resolve disputes, but to do that we must change the attitude of a good many lawyers." 
"In America, the current genera­tion of lawyers or at least far too many of them, seems to act more like warriors eager to do battle than healers seeking peace. Our society is indeed a litigious one with over 600,000 lawyers and over 25 million new lawsuits each year," he said. 
"We desperately need a genera­tion of lawyers -and law teachers ­who understand that access to justice does not invariable mean ac­ces to courtrooms," he said. 
Burger also charged that the pro­blem is not what the U.S. system of legal education teaches, but what it doesn't teach. 
"American law schools for the most part perform very well the task of training in the law and in· legal analysis," he said. "But a system of legal education that teaches lawyers to think brilliantly yet fails to ~each them how to act with civility and according to high professional standards with a com­mitment to human values has failed to perform its mission." 
The American legal system itself must be subjected to adversary ex­amination; if not, "it may be too fragile to survive the stresses of the 21st century," he said. 
Law student ts recovenng after wreck 
By VIC SCIULLI 
Assistant News Editor 
William Kovalcik Jr., a second­year law student, is in good condi­tion following surgery yesterday for injuries incurred during an acci­dent near the Grotto Wednesday. 
Kovalcik was riding his bicycle on the road between the Grotto and St. Michael's Laundry when he was struck by a car driven by Notre Dame quarterback Blair Kiel. 
Glenn Terry, director of security, said that Kovalcik failed to see the stop sign located where the road in­tersects the lake road. Kiel's car was moving east, coming from the direction of the ROTC building. 
Kovalcik underwent surgery at the St. Joseph Medical Center to repair muscles and tendons in his fractured left leg. 
Terry said the intersection has been a problem in the past. The stop sign has become obscured by trees and shrubs, and there have been "many near misses" as a result of bikers and runners not stopping before they cross the raod. 
Terry is not sure what can be done to remedy the situation but emphasized that no one should cross the path without checking traffic. 
schools. 
Notre Dame students would have paid $206 more on the average if college costs had risen the same as the rest of the nation. 
Saint Mary's students will pay 
11.9 percent more than last year. That figure covers tuition, fees, and room and board, accourding to Karen Heisler, spokeswoman for the College. 
In a letter to the parents of undergraduates, Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president, said the increase is necessary "if Notre Dame in all its dimensions is to grow in excellence." 
And, Hesburgh said, the increase in tuition and fees is "considerable less than in recent years." 
Last year, the cost of Notre Dame -tuition, room, board and fees -rose by 13.4 percent, almost twice this year's increase. In the 1981-82 school year, college costs increased by 10.48 percent. 
This year's increase, which was fee. 
Tuition is $6,450-up $500 or 8.4 percent. Room, board and laundry fees increased $145 or 7 percent to $2,210. 
Still, college costs are rising faster than inflation. Consumer prices were up 3.9 percent last year and grew at only a 3 percent annual rate for the first five months of this year. 
Nationwide, colleges and univer­sities increased prices by an average of 10 percent, according to a survey released this summer by The Col­lege Board. Costs rose by an average of 11 percent in both 1982 and 1981. 
Kathleen Brouder, associate director of the board's College Scholarship Service, explains that "many colleges are still playing 'catch-up' after a decade of infla­tion." She argues that college costs during most of the 1970s rose at a slower rate than consumer prices.

the universities would have to 
verify the students' statements. 
"It's kind of difficult to object to 
the law," Russo said yesterday. 
"But higher-education institutions 
did object to having the burden of 
verification." 
But Russo said a "massive outcry 
" by financial-aid directors forced 
the Education Department to scrap 
the verification procedure until the 
1985-86 school year. 
The basic idea of tying federal 
aid to students' registration status 
has firm support from the White House and in Congress. President Reagan has supported the law as a way to force male students to corn­ply with Selective Service registra­tion. 
But a federal district judge in Minnesota overruled the new law, calling it unfair because only students who need assistance are in­volved. 
The Education Department ap­pealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and in late June one justice ruled that the law should remain in effect until the entire Supreme Court hears the case.

3 buildings 
renovated

ByPATSAIN 
CopyEdttor 
LaFortune Student Center, Wash­ington Hall and the Engineering Auditorium received major renova­tions this summer. 
Also renovated was the old library at Saint Mary's, now the Haggar Col­lege Center, and the tunnel between Holy Cross and LeMans halls. 
But at Notre Dame, only the work on the Engineering Auditorium is complete because, shipments of materials were delayed. 
Lafortune should be completed in two weeks, and Washington Hall will be ready to use by Nov. l, said Physical Plant Director Don Dedrick. 
Workers were on the job 24 hours a day for two days to complete the work in the auditorium, Dedrick noted. The work was finished yester­day morning at 7:30. 
The renovation included install­ing cushioned seats similar to the ones in the Annenberg Auditorium. The auditorium also has provisions tor handicapped people. 
To compensate for the level floor in the auditorium, the movie screen and the stage were elevated. A slanted floor would reduce the num­ber of seats and would cost too much, said Dedrick. 
A new sound system and lighting were also put in, Dedrick said, as well as carpeting in the aisles and on the walls to aid the acoustics in the room. 
LaFortune's first floor and the women's restroom in the basement were redone. The main entrance and lobby were made "more pleas­ing and useful," Dedrick said. 
The entrance had alreadv un­dergone some work last year: with bushes and greenery planted around it to make it more appealing. 
The lobby was divided lengthwise by a walkway paved with bricks, and an information and ticket counter are to the immediate left of the entrance. New furniture and interior decorating will be completed in two weeks. 
Caron Court, the sunken court­yard in the center of LaFortune, was filled in and made level with the rest of the first floor. The main entrances to the Huddle are now through doors in the rear of Caron. The for­mer Tom Dooley room has been made into an extension ofthe eating area of the Huddle, similar to the area presently between the Hufidle's serving counter and the Deli. 

The Little Theatre, on the op­posite side of Caron, was also refur­bished. "It is mostly paint work to make the place look better," Dedrick said. The main entrance to the theatre is now from the side of Caron Court. The old entrances to hoth the former Tom Dooley room and the auditorium were filled in. 
The round lounge on the side of Lafortune's lobby has been con­verted into a "formal little area, similar to a motel-type lounge," said Dedrick. "We put in a nice floor and wooden doors," along with new furniture." 
The downstairs ladies room was redone completely. "The situation down there had gotten a little out of hand," Dedrick said. 
"~'e looked carefully at the stu· dent use of the place before we made a major financial committ­ment," Dedrick said. "It is a versatile building with many possibilites." 
The Lafortune renovation cost around S 1 50,000. 
Washington Hall will take two years to completely renovate. On the ground floor, the lobby and stairs were redone, and an elevator was added for handkappt."c! people. The restrooms and costume ar~a w~re also redone. 

,, ... ,_M' ______________ 
In the theatre area, the air system, the electrical system and lighting were replaced. A light dimming sys· tern and a sprinkler system were also added. 
New chairs, identical to the one~ in the Annenberg Auditorium, will be put in. "The auditorium is used a~ a classroom, and the students were using lapboards to take notes, which was bad," Dedrick said. "The new seats have note boards." 
The new chairs are staggered so the line of view to the stage from all seats isn't blocked. The steps in the balcony have been reconstructed. and more chairs have been added. 
Dedrick said work should be done by Nov. 1 -two months later than originally planned. 
Next summer, the band wing of Washington Hall will be redone. The complete renovation is expected to cost S 1.2 million.

While states and schools around the country have been instituting stricter policies governing the com­suption of alcohol, Notre Dame has not changed its rules. 
But Dean of Students James Roemer ~aid that "we will be even more vigorous and diligent in en­forcing the present alcohol policy." 
That policy has been outlined in a directive from the dean which dic­tates the rules concerning alcohol consumption on campus. 
The following violations will result in a minimum $100 fine: 
Possessing or drinking from a pony or a keg on campus. Such containers will be impounded by Security and will not be returned. 
Consuming alcohol outside of private dorm rooms or residence hall party rooms. Alcoholic beverages are not allowed in the football stadium nor the ACC, and are not permitted outside on the campus. 

Entering or attempting to enter of anyone under the age of 21 into the Alumni-Senior Club (Senior Bar). 
Entering the club by any entrance other than the front door, or open­ing a door to allow others to enter. 
Bringing alcoholic beverages into the club on certain announced non­alcoholic nights. 
In addition, Roemer stressed that parietal will be enforced just as diligently as the alcohol policy. Some violations could result in the expulsion of the students involved. 
"Our parietal regulation has been that serious violations -such as overnight stays -will involve the separation of the student from the University," Roemer said. He believes that some students do not realize how seriously the Universi­ty will handle such situations, even on the first offense. 
A full treatment of the Univer­sity's disciplinary rules is contained in the 79-page Du Lac , the guide to student life. The booklet, which will be distributed to freshmen by the hall staffs, also covers Notre Dame's policies on drugs, adademic dishonesty, theft, injuries to per­sons or property and human sex­ualtiy. 
One key regulation restricts the height of elevated beds, or lofts. Students who build lofts in their rooms must obtain permission from their rector, and sign and return a form . ·

Suspect arrested for '82 hit-and-run 
By DIANE DIRKERS 
Assistant News Editor 
The driver of the vehicle that al­legedly struck two Notre Dame stu­dents last fall has been arrested after 
police  enlisted  the  help of South  
Bend's  new  Crime  Stoppers  
program.  

Russell Micinski, 28, of South Bend was arrested Aug. 18 in con­nection with the hit-and-run of stu­dents Beth Mcinerny and Kerry Mannion on Sept. 26. 
Micinski has plead innocent to charges of two felony counts of driving under the influence and causing serious bodily injuries, and a misdemeanor count of leaving the scene ofan injury accident. 
Police had exhausted all leads when they handed the case over to Crime Stoppers in May. 
Crime Stoppers, a new program in South Bend, re-enacts local crimes on television and in local newspapers, and offers cash rewards for tips leading to arrests. 
A tip received by South Bend Police Sgt. Sam Walsh on July 8

helped police track down the suspect. Police said a piece of grill found at the accident site matched that of Micinski's vehicle. And, police said, paint chips from Micinski's car matched samples taken last September. Traces of the victims' clothing were found on the car, police added. 
Micinski had allegedly been driving back from the Linebacker's Club, a tavern on South Bend Ave. He recalled having "a little bit more than I should have to drink," and could not remember clearly what happened that evening. 
"It's hard to believe they (the police) really did anything," said Mcinerny. "I thought the whole inci­dent was over, and now it's being stirred up again. I'm not looking for­ward to going through it again. 
Mannion agreed. "It's almost a year gone by now. I can walk. My head is fine. I don't have any bad feelings now. I want to forget about the whole thing. Actually, I feel more sorry for him ( Micinski) than I do for me."

SBPs see vital role for freshmen 

Notre Dame 
ByTOMMOWLE 
Copy Editor 
Notre Dame student government officials hope this year's freshmen will get involved in the many ac· tivities planned. 
These activities include --for the first time in many years -a Homecoming celebration in addi· tion to the traditional events such as An Tostal, Mardi Gras and the Mock Convention. 
Student Body President Brian Cal­laghan said it is important for fresh­men to help plan these events because "freshmen haven't been around long enough to forget their ideas." 
Callaghan will continue the programs that were successful last year and encourages freshmen to participate. The Chance to Dance program, which "satisfied a need for a lot of people," will be continued, but the coordinator hasn't been chosen yet. 
More exchanges with colleges are being planned; Callaghan plans to schedule schools similar to Notre Dame. 
Saint Mary's will also sponsor the Homecoming celebration, which will be the weekend ofthe Pittsburg football game. A men's and women's hall will work together on floats, and the festival will include a concert and a bonfire. 
Student Body Vice President Peg· gy Prevoznik said a political conven­tion will be a another major event on campus -probably in March. This convention is held every presiden­tial election year to inform students about the candidates running for office. 
Student government, she said, will try to keep the students more in· formed of its activities than it has in the past by publishing a newsletter every two months. The Student Uni­on will also keep a comprehensive calendar of events on campus to aid scheduling. 
Callaghan said that the goals of student government this year are "concrete and realistic." Among these are a teacher-evaluation program to help students decide which classes to take, the use of Senior Bar by undergraduates on certain nights, and a greater variety of electives for science and engineering students. 
Saint Mary's 
Saint Mary's Student Body Presi­dent Elaine Hocter expects this year's freshmen to quickly come to· gether as a class. 
Student government and the halls have planned several activities that will enable the freshmen to get to know each other. These include so­cials, hayrides and movies. 
Freshmen should have an easy 
time getting involved in student 
government, Hocter said, because 
the officers in Regina Hall, where 
most freshmen live, will be elected 
in the fall, as will a freshman council. 
Major social events set for next month include the dedication ofthe new student center and a five-hall dance, said Vice President for Academic Affair Madeline Hoch. 
The dedication week will begin on Sept. 10 with an outdoor concert by a variety of area bands, and will conclude with the dedication itself on the 16th. That night the celebra­tion will feature an Irish Band, Jim Coor & Friends. 
The dance will be Sept. 24 in the college center and will be "similar to the Chance to Dance at Notre Dame," Hocter said. 
This year many of the events on campus will be preceded by lead-in activities to encourage participa· tion. Student government is keeping a schedule to coordinate the various hall and government-sponsored events. 
Additional events include Senior Father-Daughter Weekend on Sept. 30, Women's Opportunity Week in November, and the Performing Arts Series. 
Hoch noted that this year a social­justice commissioner will work to get the students "more involved in commu_nity service." Hocter added that she is "looking forward to working with Notre Dame on ac­tivities, especially Homecoming."

Such are the pains of freshman who have to pay some early dues in their careers. But the players agree that the pleasant welcome from up­perclassmen made the initial suffer­ing bearable. 
"I've known people who have gone to other colleges and have said that the freshmen there have to serve the upperclassmen are treated like dirt," says Riley. "Here they (upperclassmen) definitely help you out."

"My father was instrumental in my my decision to come here," says Wilson, "because he pointed out that a degree from here would real­ly help me in the future." For Banks, who was named as national high school "Player of the Year" by the Columbus (Ohio) 
Touchdown Club, the attraction came down to the coaching staffs concern for the well-being of the 
players beyond the gridiron. "Coach Faust seems to be concern­ed about athletes on and off the field," says banks. 
That concern in important when freshmen at Notre Dame step on to the football field for the first time.

After Parseghian resigned in 1974, Stock was given the position of offensive coordinator for Wisconsin from 1975-77. He next served as the head coach Eastern Michigan from 1978-82 before becoming the offensive backfield coach for the USFL's New Jersey Generals. 
In other news, junior offensive tackle Larry Williams and senior cornerback Stacey Toran are the Irish players whose names appear most frequently in the pre-season 
all-America selections of various big-name publications. 
Williams, who comes off a sterl­ing sophomore campaign in which he played more minutes than any other Irish offensive player, and Toran, who will begin his fourth year of starting duty in the secon­dary, were both tabbed for the Sporting News All America squad. 
Toran was also selected as a second-team pick by Street & Smith and an honorable mention pick by Gamble Plan. Williams was an honorable mention choice in both of these publications. 
Senior kicker Mike Johnston, who set a Notre Dame record last year by kicking 19 field goals in 22 attempts was also an all-America pick by Sporting News as well as an honorable mention selection by 
Street & Smith. 
Despite sitting out all of last season with a foot injury, Sporting News thought enough of nose tackle Tim Marshall to select him on their all-America squad. Game Plan also chose him as an honorable mention pick. Marshall, incidentally, weighed in at a svelte 235 pounds after having weighed as much as 282 pounds during the off­season last year.

seasons in a row have hardly tar­nished the image of Notre Dame throughout the country. 
"No one said anything about Notre Dame while I was being recruited," says Rheder. "In fact when I mentioned that I was con­sidering Notre Dame, other recruiters seemed to have gotten worried about it and did a double­take." 
"Basically, this is the place to be," says Miller. "This is family. The talent is her and you just know that things are going to get rolling around here." 
Maybe it is a coincidence, but the upperclassmen have been saying the same thing since spring.

Freshman football players attempt to deal with college pressures 
By THERON ROBERTS 
and LOUIE SOMOGYI 
Sports Writers 

For some 1,800 Notre Dame freshmen, the next four years will offer a challenge of mental and spiritual growth. 
For the last two-and-a-half weeks, 28 of those freshmen have already experienced some of the pains and pleasures that come with adjusting to the collegiate scene at Notre Dame. 
The 28, this year's scholarship freshman football players, corn-prise Head Football coach Gerry Faust's third straight freshman class that features talent good enough to be ranked among the very best recruiting crops in the na­tion. 
Of all the talented players, however, perhaps none matches the talent of Kirkwood, Missouri native, Alvin Miller. The 6-4, 205­lb. flanker was selected a magazine "Player of the Year" this past season -an honor that has per­viously been bestowed on last year's 
h 1Heisman Trophy . Hersc

wmner e Walker, last year's Heisman runner-up Eric Dickerson, and last year's first sophomore offensive 
lineman in recent memory to make first-team all-America, Bill Fralic of Pittsburgh. 
The athletic prowess of Miller was perhaps best demonstrated in last spring's Missouri state track meet where he won the 100-and 200-meter dashes along with the 110-and 300-meter hurdles to win the state crown for Kirkwood High School.

Pinkett started on the third 1987 as a whole. "We haven't got it squad last year, but was soon the 
together yet. We're still learning. 
You realize real quick when you're 
out there on the field that you're a 
freshman." 

Nevertheless, Miller has been one 
of six freshmen who are or have 
been working with the second-team 
units this fall, and who can perhaps 
make a strong impact on the team 
as the season progresses. 

Other freshmen who have seen 
action with the second units so far 
this fall include 5-9, 172-lb. split 
end Alonzo Jefferson; Steve 
Beuerlein, a 6-3, 195-lb. quarter­
back; 6-5,235-lb. defensive end 
Robert Banks; Steve Lawrence, a 6_ 
o, 180-lb. cornerback; and 5_11 , 
170-lb. cornerback Troy Wilson. 
Under the tutelage of first-year offensive coordinator and secon­year quarterback coach ron Hud­son, Beuerlein, who hials from the same high school as last year's backup, Jim O'Hara, has been ex­pecially appreciative of the transi­tion to collegiate level football. 
"I'm getting coached more and am working more on technique," says the Fullerton, California native. "In high school I was always team-instructed, now I'm in­structed as an individual. Coach Hudson really knows what he's talking about and has shown me new ways to do old things. Beuerlein completed 150 of 226 passes (66 percent) for 2,244 yards and 21 touchdowns last year while being chosen as one of the top 100 freshmen for 1983 by Sporting News, Football News, and several

Francisco," H," as he is dubbed by teammates, has also been working with the third unit this fall and ac­cepts it gracefully. 
"I realize they're talented," says Francisco of the compeuuon playing ahead of him. "I'm not expecting to walk in and take over." 
Like the rest ofhis classmates, like Pinkett last year, "H" is simply waiting for the chance to compete. He and other members of Notre Dame's freshman class could probably stan and even star at other institutions by their second year. But football is just part of the package at Notre Dame. 
James Bobb, a safety from Texas, perhaps best summarized the attrac­tion and lure of Notre Dame. 
"I took it in perspective," says Bobb, a National Honor Society member. "I was looking for a school
