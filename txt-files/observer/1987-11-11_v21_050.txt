Reagan declares dollar has fallen to lowest level 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-President Reagan, seeking to shore up the embattled U.S. dollar, declared Tuesday that the cur­rency had fallen enough and that his administration is "not doing anything to bring it down." 
Reagan's remarks, seeming to contradict recent sugges­tions by other officials that the administration would let the dollar fall, helped fuel a rebound in foreign exchange markets, where the dollar had plunged to new 40-year lows. 
"I don't look for a further decline, don't want a further decline from where it is right now," Reagan told reporters in off-the-cuff remarks at the start of a meeting with visiting Israeli President Chaim Her­zog. 
A weaker dollar makes U.S. goods more competitive abroad but reduces Americans' purchasing power and standard of living. Too sharp a plunge can rekindle in­flation and drive away foreign investments needed to finance the..f.ederal budget deficit. 


Although Reagan's com­ments buoyed markets, at least temporarily, analysts sugges­ted the remarks did not neces­sarily signal a shift in U.S. policy. They said the adminis­tration may have little choice but to accept further declines in the dollar, despite criticism from Europe and Japan. 
The alternative is raising

Lay Catholics advocate more 
By REGIS COCCIA 
Assistant News Editor 
A conference of four Catholic lay leaders said Tuesday night that the Vatican should con­tinue consultation with Cat­holics worldwide regarding the role of the laity in ministry. 
The symposium, the first of its kind at Notre Dame, was in­tended to promote awareness of lay issues and dialogue with church leaders following last month's Vatican synod on the laity, said Father Robert Pel­ton. 
"I think it was a good and appropriate follow-through on the synod, which just ter­during his recent U.S. visit. minated,'' said Pelton, director "Eight of 11 (lay) discussion of Notre Dame's Institute for groups in San Francisco this Pastoral and Social Ministry, year chose to talk about the re­which sponsored the event. lationship between laity and

Even as the president sought to bolster the dollar, his new commerce secretary, C. William Verity, said the markets should set the proper level for the dollar. 
"We can do an awful lot of things, and we probably will, but in the end it is the market­place that will determine how far the dollar will fall if it will fall any further. And I happen to be a believer in markets," Verity said in a question ses­sion at the National Press Club after his first major speech as commerce secretary. 
The dollar gained ground after Reagan's statement, rising to 134.15 Japanese yen in New York from 133.60 yen in earlier trading. The dollar closed in New York on Monday at 134.18 yen and fell in Tokyo on Tuesday to 133.65 yen, the first time it has ever tumbled below the 134-yen level. 


Panel discusses AIDS prevention 
By KATHLEEN CROOKS 
News Staff 
A panel of speakers stressed 
the need for protection against 
AIDS in a discussion entitled 
"Sex on Campus" at 
Theodore's Monday. 
All the speakers said the 
most important thing to know 
about AIDS is how to prevent 
it. 
Several methods are avail­
able to protect oneself from 
AIDS infection, according to 
Dr. James Moriarity of Univer­
sity Health Services. They in­
clude having sex with only one 
partner, avoiding anal inter­
course, and using contracep­
tives such as condoms, sper­
micidal jellies, and 
diaphragms, he said. 
Sally Coleman, a nurse at the infirmary, said the infirmary is going to start a support group for victims of infectious dis­eases. She said the group is to be called "Life Raft" and would provide total confiden­tiality. The group is scheduled to begin meeting in January. 
A victim of AIDS calling him­self "Rick" listed symptoms generally associated with AIDS. These include flaking skin, insomnia, night sweats, 
dialogue 
to open ourselves up to other cultures, particularly across ideologies in the wide range of cultures," said Holland. "We do need to be careful, espe­cially in world cultures. We carry a lot of weight," he said. "We're an important part of the Church." 
Other panelists in the sympo­sium included: Patricia Crowley, co-founder of the worldwide Christian Family Movement and member of the first couple to receive Notre Dame's Laetare Medal; and Loretta Jancoski, theologian and visiting scholar at Notre Dame. 
and significant weight loss. 
"I don't want anybody to go through what I am going through right now," he said, giving this as his reason for wanting to speak to people about AIDS. 
A second victim, who identi­fied himself as "Allan," des­cribed his illness, telling the au­dience about his weekly hospital visits. He also des­cribed how he contracted the AIDS virus through sexual con­tact in 1983 at the age of 23. 
Dr. Robert Hunt, a specialist in infectious diseases, noted that the medical community has been unable to find a cure for the disease, only methods of treatment for the symptoms. 
Father David Tyson, vice president for student affairs, said that in a community like Notre Dame it is important to emphasize both individual and public health when considering infectious diseases. 
At the University, the pri­mary concern would be to help the individual deal with the dis­ease spiritually, emotional­ly ,and physically, while protecting the Notre Dame community, said Tyson.

Chivalry in the 1980's: Frankly, my dear ... 
"Guys at Notre Dame are so rude. What ever happened to chivalry? Where are the guys who thre'Y their coats over puddles and spent evemngs serenading their girlfriends?" remarked a friend of mine at dinner the other night.
All I could muster up in defense of males at N~tre Dame was the tired cliche, "Don't you thmk you're being a little demanding? Besides chivalry is not dead." ' "No, I hate to disappoint you, but it died years ago," she replied. Now I was on the spot. I wasn't prepared to defend ye ol' cliche. After a few silent seconds all I coll;ld ~orne up with was, "No, it's still around; It's JUSt harder to find. Modern society complicates it too much." That, thank God, was enough to satisfy her for t~e d,uration of the me<U. _I don't know why she didn task, "How do you mean complicates it?" It's just as well, because I didn't have an answer for it. With the thought of chivalry still on my mind, I m~de an effort to open a door for my com­pamon on our way out of the dining hall. I was confronted with the dreaded double door dilem­ma: How do you open the first set of doors and get to the second set without running or having the woman wait? All of a sudden I realized that I had a reason why chivalry is more difficult --doors probably weren't as close together in the old days. Two da;ys w~nt .b~ without further examples of chivalry s difficulty, and I was giving up hope of finding more. That night, however I hit a gold mine. ' Some friends and I went out for dinner with our dates before a SYR. Upon arriving at our table, I pulled out the chair for my date. After that show of chivalry I tried to push the chair in, but the chair wouldn't move. I'm hardly acc';lsing my date of being heavyset, but she obviously didn't realize that it would be of im­mense help if she did not let all her weight rest on the chair. I had found my second reason -­women today are not as prepared for chivalrous deeds. After dinner I paid for the both of us. I was happy to do it. All of a sudden I realized what a long-term financial commitment a steady girlfriend would be in college. I'd have to pay for a lot of meals and flowers if I wanted to treat her the way I thought she deserved. In the middle of my financial sorrow I realized that I had found reason number th;ee co~lege students cannot afford to be overly chivalrous, thus making chivalry appear less often than some guys would like. I was really getting carried away with this renewed interest in being chivalrous. Women

were· really charmed with the extra attention. 
About two days later I discovered problem number four. By this time I'd become over­zealous in my attempts to be chivalrous. I spotted a woman carrying a large load of bags, and I offered to help carry them. 
"What, do you think women are inferior to men?" she said curtly. I was taken aback. "I was just trying to help " I replied in my defense. ' She only said, ''Oh, so you think women are weaker then men." 
It was no use. I had run into an avid feminist. Although I must admit she probably didn't need the help, the encounter left an impression on me. From then on I was more wary of what I did and for whom I did it. Whose dinner do I pay for? Whom do I open doors for? This was yet another difficulty with being chivalrious -­you don't know how some women will respond to your actions. 
A week had passed, and I found myself walking back from dinner with the girl who had started this whole chivalry problem. As we en­tered her dorm I opened the first set of doors for her, and I just made it to the second set without looking rushed. Despite our conversa­tion a week ago, she didn't seem to notice this chivalrous act. After we were inside she turned to me and said, "My girlfriends and I were discussing your remark about chivalry .the other day. What do you mean by more compl­icated?" 
"Well, let me tell ya ..."

WASHINGTON-Judge An­thony Kennedy's selection to the Supreme Court appeared all but certain Tuesday, but White House officials went to unusual lengths to guard against the failures that brought down President Reagan's previous two choices. 
Administration officials ar­ranged courtesy calls with leading senators for Kennedy amid Republican bickering over the defeat of Robert Bork and the withdrawal of Douglas Ginsburg. 
Republican Sen. William Cohen compared conserva­tives' criticism of White House chief of staff Howard Baker to a mugging "on the back stairs of the White House." 
On Tuesday, Cohen, R-Maine, said, "The truth is that Howard Baker was shoved overboard by the ideologically pure because he was recom­mending a 'confirmable con­servative,' " adding, "That phrase suggested compromise or, worse, appe:.:.sement."

Kennedy, a federal appellate judge from Sacramento, Calif., spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. The nomination an­nouncement would be forthcoming before the week was out, he said. 
A face-to-face session with the president is customarily the final step before such an announcement. But Fitzwater said it had been agreed that "more consultations would take place" first, particularly with members of Congress.

Meese and other conserva­tives are widely reported to have persuaded Reagan two weeks ago to select Ginsburg for the court seat after the Sen­ate voted down Bork. 
Baker is said to have favored Kennedy, and he has been ac­cused by conservatives of un­uproar followed Ginsburg's ad­mission he smoked marijuana in the 1960s and 1970s. 
Cohen said the conservatives took the view that in Ginsburg, "We've got a man who will make the Bork haters beg for a chance to recant." 
But the Maine senator said that after the marijuana dis­closure, it "was a group ot con­servatives who gathered on the floor and came to the conclu­sion that Judge Ginsburg had to go, not any liberals or not any moderates."

Petition proposes library reforms 
By MIMI TUOHY Staff Reporter 
Three programs for the Cushwa-Leighton Library at Saint Mary's were proposed in a petition distributed at the Saint Mary's Board of Gover­nance meeting Monday night by Julie Parrish, vice president for academic affairs. 
Requested are opening the li­brary at 11 a.m. on Sunday, staffing the circulation desk with a student or graduate stu­dent and conducting a survey of students using the library after 8 p.m. on Friday and Sat­urday. 
The petition will be circ­ulated in the dormitories until Thursday, Parrish said. They will be available for signatures in the dining hall on Friday. 
"This (the library schedule) is a continuing problem," said Student Government President Eileen Hetterich. "It was a problem two years ago, and it is still one today. We would.ap­preciate the help of the student body in finally solving the sit­uation concerning the library hours," she said. 
In other business, Counseling and Career Development Com­


missioner Mary Welsh said that the Carnival of Career:s will be Thursday, Nov. 12, from 3-6 p.m. in Angela Athletic Facility. Volunteer organiza­tions and businesses pertaining to all majors will be represented. 
"We are looking for a good turnout. Many interesting com­panies are coming, and I hope .the student body will take ad­va!ltage of this opportunity," satd Welsh. 
Hetterich announced that next week the student govern­ment will present a slide show and a movie showing how the people of Chile are affected by the recent poll tax. The slide show will be presented Monday afternoon in Stapleton Lounge of LeMans Hall. Also Monday night the movie "Missing" will be shown in Carroll Hall at 7 
p.m. The Chilean project will conclude on Tuesday with a mass in LeMans chapel at 12: 15 p.m. 
· "This is our way of doing something for people in need," said Hetterich. "We hope that the student body will partici­pate in the events that we have planned," she said.

The 71 year­old, tuxedo clad gentleman who turned up at Notre Dame's ACC last night is simply not content with such relaxation. For Frank Sinatra still loves the spotlight the stage. the microphone. and yes, of course, the ladies. 
Notre Dame is certainly an Interesting place for Sinatra to turn up. Sinatra's sporadically few performances during the last few years have been reserved for places like Car­negie HaiL or at the Stardust in Las Vegas. Nonetheless, an arena full of curious fans were glad to pay the $27.50 to get a glimpse of the controversial singer known simply as "The Voice."

The scene at the ACC was tame, and in stark contrast to previous Sinatra settings in Las Vegas. The audience was primarily comprised of older patrons, and for the first time I almost felt uncomfortable in a concert setting. I guess I know how my mother felt when I took her to an Echo and the Bunnymen show. No fights broke out with Sinatra's burly bodyguards, no drinks were thrown in the faces of reporters, and no sleek, blond­haired vixens sporting minks dotted the front row. 
Sinatra opened up with a ver­sion of Stevie Wonder's "You Are The Sunshine of My Life", and demonstrated the impec­cable phrasing that made him famous. Having lost much of the range of his early days, fans didn't seem to care. Backed by a superb orchestra, and an excellent sound system, Sinatra's baritone voice, periodically lacquered with

whiskey, hit the correct notes on "Mack the Knife," "For Once In My Life," and "New York, New York." 
Saying that, "I finally got to Notre Dame," Sinatra spoke about his time growing up In Hoboken, New Jersey, and that "drinking and singing" was still a great way to live. 
Hampered by a knee injury, Sinatra required assistance to get on stage, but once finding it, quickly established his charismatic rhythm. At 71, Sinatra has mellowed with age, and proved to his audience that he has not lost that remarkable presence that has characterized his half-century career. 
Despite the volatile and sometimes unsavory events that have peppered his past, Sinatra remains the consum­mate performer and boasts an impressive resume of creden­tials. Sinatra has sold millions of records and has appeared in over 50 films, winning an Academy Award for his perfor­mance in "From Here To Eter­nity."

}\ II right, I've been getting a ~ot of questions about the WVFI Top Ten every week, I.e. "Come on, you're making up these band names yourself, aren't you, Ann?" Well the an­swer is "no," and to prove it, I am going to give you a little information about this week's Top Ten which might make them seem more real to you. 
The BoDeans are from Waukesha, Wisconsin and recently released their second album, Outside Looking In. The song "Only Love" is the first single off that album. You might also have heard of the BoDeans because they were the opening act for U2 all fall. They're sort of a country­sounding rock band with lots of guitars. 
Paul Kelly and the Mes­sengers are from that musical mecca Australia, and "Before Too Long" is their first single. It features good harmonies and melodic "R. E. M. ish" guitars. 
Philadelphia's The Dead Milkmen score big with "Instant Club Hit" off their third LP en­titled Bucky Fellini. These guys 
Bill Watterson 
are very satirical and hilarious as they cut down basically all aspects of society with catchy music. 
"Sweet Fire of Love" is by Robbie Robertson, former vocalist for The Band, a '60's group which played alongside the likes of Bob Dylan. U2 pro­vides backing instruments and vocals here and the resulting sound is very balanced and soulful. 
England's Aztec Camera had not released anything in four years, but they come back now with "Deep and Wide and Tall." The song is pop, but not too sweet. Let's just say it's "pop"­ular. 
"Everything's Explodin"' by The Flaming Lips is one of those all-too-rare songs which become very popular, even though the band is virtually unknown. The Flaming Lips really rock out and could be called a hardcore band. They're loud!

the legendary singer from Roxy Music. "The Right Stuff' is part of his current solo effort, and It was cowritten by former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. It is up­beat and typical of Ferry and Roxy Music. "The Right Stuff" Is good stuff. 
"Fangs" Is a song by the Min­neapolis foursome Trip Shake­speare, who took Notre Dame by storm last Friday night. It features good guitars as well as good harmonies by three of the members. 
The Edge of U2 took off for awhile and did a solo movie soundtrack project. "Rowena's Theme" is a cut off that soundtrack. It is not much like a U2 song at all In that there are no vocals, but the guitar work is very beautiful. 
"Three cards" Is by a group called The Balancing Act, and this band is one of the up and coming names in college music today. Critics love them and obviously, so do WVFI listeners!

Goals of club do not threaten others 
Over the last few years, the issue of homosexuality has gradually come to be seen as a topic worthy of discussion by members of the Notre Dame and St. Mary's community, creating tensions between religious beliefs and the realization that many of the communi­ty's members are gay or lesbian. Rather than tackling this difficult issue directly, the community has, for the most part, decided to ignore it in the hope it would disappear. 
Michael Dini 
guest column 
On Nov. 3, however, the Observer, on its own initiative, took a bold step toward resolving these tensions, chal­lenging all of us to examine and discuss homosexuality in an intelligent and open-minded manner. The Observer proposed that official recognition of Gays and Lesbians at Notre Dame-St. Mary's College is consistent with the overall Catholic foundation of the Uni­versity and is, in fact, essential to aca­demic freedom. This recognition would not imply acceptance by the adminis­tration of a homosexual lifestyle. 
The members of GLNMMC would like to extend their thanks to the Ob­server for its support. The Nov. 3 edi­torial indicates a genuine effort to un­derstand and discuss homosexuality wtth the sense of intelligence, maturity and compassion it deserves. The Ob­server has come to understand the goals of GLNMMC and should be com­mended for its work. 
In light of subsequent columns and letters, however, it is evident both that there are still those who imagine gayAesbian people in terms of uni­dimensional stereotypes as well as those who have little or no idea of the purposes of GLNMMC. If an appropri­ate discussion is to occur concerning the recognition of our organization, it is necessary to define that for which we stand. 
First, to become aware of the struggle and suffering that many gay and lesbian persons face in coming to grips with their sexual orientation in the homophobic atmosphere at Notre Dame and St. Mary's, GLNMMC seeks to support those who are gay or lesbian or who are examining their sexual orientation, and does so with the assurance of confidentiality. 
Second, GLNMMC seeks the on­going education of its members and of the non-gay members of the community concerning gay and lesbian issues. Educational efforts in the past have in­cluded public lectures on campus by such speakers as John Fortunato (on the spiritual journeys of Christian gays and lesbians), Sr. Jeannine Gramick (on homsexuals and dissenters: can Catholics be either or both?) and Ann Mueller (on the important roles played by parents of lesbians and gays). On Nov. 21, Sue Hammersmith, Dean of Arts & Sciences at Ferris State College in Michigan (formerly of the Kinsey In­stitute at I.U. Bloomington) will speak on the sociology of homosexuality at 7:00p.m. in 117 Haggar. Over the past two years, GLNMMC has provided speakers for classes on both campuses. We believe that in order to bring about an atmosphere free of prejudice, edu­cation is essential. 
Third, GLND!SMC provides opportu­nities for gay and lesbian persons to socialize and get to know one another in an environment free of tension and hostility --an atmosphere necessary for the development of the individual. 
Fourth, GLNMMC seeks to be an effective instrument to advance justice and to achieve equality for gay and les­bian persons. As the only student or­ganization on the campuses which ac­tively strives for this justice (GLNMMC representatives have met with staff members of Campus Mini­stry as well as with representatives of student government on both campuses in pursuit of this goal), GLNMMC is essential in this endeavor. 
Do any of these purposes conflict with the mission of a Catholic university? Not only are these goals consistent with those of Catholic institutions such as Notre Dame and St. Mary's; they are characteristic. Apparently, misconcep­tions about our organization have led some to believe that we exist for quite different reasons. Advocacy of a par­ticular "lifestyle" is by no means pro­posed by GLNMMC. The manner in which an individual decides to lead a life is a personal choice. We are brought together by the fact that we are homo­sexual people who need the support commonly required by members of reviled minorities. One's "lifestyle" is independent of the organization. GLNMMC provides the necessary in­formation and resources for individuals to make informed, moral decisions con­cerning their development as persons. We don't provide the decisions. 
Were GLNMMC to become a recog­nized organization on both campuses, there would be no more homosexual students than are already here. However, it happens, one's sexual ori­entation is irrevocably determined long before one arrives at college. Only the way in which homosexual persons are perceived and treated as part of this community will have begun to change -and change in a manner which is far more consistent with the Gospel that is presently the case.

Gay debate sorely lacking in morality 
The recent Viewpoint columns of Nov. 3 were incredible. Not only were we bombarded by letters urging us to accept homosexuality as a legitimate alternative lifestyle, but we were so urged under the guise of some en­lightened form of Catholicism. 
William J. Sammon 
guest column 
Conspicuously absent from the rhet­oric of homosexuality promulgated by William Storey, Ann Pettifer and the Observer staff is any reference to spir­itual morality and salvation. To these messengers of modern "enlighten­ment" spiritual morality and salvation are dead relics of an oppressive age. Mr. Storey, a professor emeritus of the­ology, strangely skirts the issue of morality. Ms. Pettifer, on the other hand, advocates immediate gratifica­tion of the self, provided that it is sheathed. For her the entire notion of an eternal soul is the fanciful historical creation of insecure men to justify op­pression. The Observer editorial started its lecture with what appeared a statement of fact, indisputable no doubt in their eyes: Notre Dame has a commitment, as a Catholic university, "to education through an active explo­ration of all facets of our life." Wrong. Notre Dame, as a Catholic university, has no more a commitment to active exploration of homosexuality than it

does to active exploration of the occult. 
The spiritual barrenness of homosexuality is what the university has a commitment against. By its very nature the only product of homosexual union is raw eroticism. The product of heterosexual union, however, aside from the raw eroticism, is the poten­tiality of procreation, the creation of a new spirit. It is precisely this fact of procreative spirituality that makes het­erosexual love and union more special, or spiritual, than the momentary orgas­mic bliss of either heterosexual or homosexual eroticism. 
Homosexuals do indeed populate our campuses, perhaps in substantial num­bers. Nonetheless, it is better that they are here without a Gay and Lesbian Society, for they may be more restrained and reflective in their indul­gent desires than at a secular institu­tion devoid of any moral ethos. The cross that they bare (sic) indeed makes their life more miserable and lonely. The pain and suffering that they feel is real, but it is not the mission of the Church to make people feel good about themselves. We are all sinners in the eyes of God, homosexuals included. God also loves us all unconditionally, but His love does not allow us to commit any act we desire. The Church's mis­sion is to help us save our souls for eternal salvation. Homosexuality cer­tainly always has and always shall ex­ist as alternative sexual behavior. Nonetheless, as Catholics we must acknowledge that homosexuality

creates only transitory pleasure; it is not the only avenue to a spiritual was­teland, but it must be condemned. 
It is not at all surprising that adv­ocates of homosexuality divorce them­selves from discussions of morality. Homosexuality is not immoral, they say, who said so anyway --a bunch of celibate old men in some monastery in the fourth century. They are unwilling to recognize that they are engaging in immoral acts; they desire to be told that it is all right to indulge their urges. Morality is all a matter of relativism, they say. There is no absolute right or wrong, it is all relative to the individual. By our personal musings we can dis­cover our own morality. This message is nauseous not wholly because of its content, but because of its wrapping. They would have us believe that their beliefs fall within the realm of Cat­holicism. They can believe what they want, but thev l"annot stand there preaching secularized hedonism telling us we are intolerant because of our in­dignation at their noxious brand of liberation tainting our faith and the faith or our fathers and our mothers. 
Who ever thought that they would see the day when Glory's mantle of Our Mother, Notre Dame, was cloaked around the spiritually naked corpse of the raw eroticism of indulgent homosexuality. What is most troubling, however, is not how far the homophiles have fallen, but how far we may have as a community. Have we become so callous to their moaning tirades that we might actually succumb to their poisonous rhetoric? Only time will tell if we acknowledge their complaints as valid and recognize GLNMMC, a time when there is no longer any right or wrong but a time when morality is all relative.

P.O. Box Q 
that ''recognition of one commonly ob­innocence, Christ overlooked the sinful comunity. He is correct in inadver­
flaws in this woman's persona. He ac­tually believed, in full blown naivete, that one should be compassionate to all. 
Yes, I do understand that Jesus Christ did become a human being in order to set an example for all of us and that while in that form, did ask us to love one another. But, as has been pointed out in previous articles, there is an ob­vious limit to the compassion we are to show others who are not like us. Re­member, as Matt Crowley so eloquently said (in the November 4 issue), they "have tossed aside one of our Christian values." We should not tolerate these infractious members at the NDSMC community. 
Those of you who believe that people, such as homosexuals, have a place in our wholesome community are sadly mistaken. Granted, Jesus Christ did stress to love our neighbor, but he ob­viously meant it within reason. To fully accept and officially recognize a group with different sexual beliefs is just too much. We also must not allow other groups with the like cause of attempt­ing to form and thereby break up our community of sameness. Those with preferences, be they sexual, political, or religious, that differ from our views should be expelled from our tight-knit community. After all, a community is an entity that is composed of like­minded people. Those that do not hold the same beliefs ought to be quelled through expulsion, or at the very least, have their privileges restricted. 
We do not want those with lifestyles different from our own to live among us. Since they are of a different lifestyle it is obvious that a serious erosion of the moral character has occurred. We cannot forget that our community is fa­mous for its wholesomeness. 
There are not many people with enough courage and conviction who will publicly criticize a proposal. I am very pleased that Mr. Crowley, through voicing his own humble opinion, has spoken for "our community as a whole." He, of course, did not include gays and lesbians in this broad state­ment, they think differently and are, therefore, clearly no longer part of our tently saying that there is no place for homosexuals in the NDSMC communi­ty. 
If you agree with the previously stated views, I, for one, am terrified that you are the future leaders of our country. Hitler himself began his reign of terror by subtly imposing restric­tions upon the Jews, Catholics, and homosexuals which eventually led to extermination in later years.

Keys to symbolize drunk driving week 
Dear Editor: 
This is the third day of the Notre Dame Designated Driver Week, organ­ized by the senior class. We have in­itiated the program in memory of Mi­chael J. Cogswell, our classmate who was killed in a drunk-driving related incident last December. 
We are promoting more than just awareness, we are promoting respon­sible action and concern for others. By extending the program to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students, faculty, and staff as well as members of the South Bend Community, we emphasize the importance of a concerted community effort building upon the concern and respect for others. 
Members of the senior class will be distributing designated driver keys during lunch on Friday and at the Block Party. These keys can be used by des­ignated drivers for free soft drinks at participating local bars and restau­rants. 
Please take a key and place it on your key chain. Our hope is that as you reach for your keys, you see the N.D.D.D. key and renew your commitment to respon­sible drinking by designating a driver for the evening. Remember: drunk driving is not a personal choice, but a public danger.

Fear of gays still inhibits dialogue 
Dear Editor: 
From behind the faultily-erected bar­rier of a false or feeble liberalism, Matt Crowley took several cheap shots at gay people in his Nov. 4 guest column. Despite his disclaimer about being homophobic, he clearly harbors many elements of homophobia within his per­sonality. Mr. Crowley's defense that "someone close to me is an admitted homosexual" is the second major evidence of this. The first clue is that "as...a Christian" he must dissent to ''The Observer's opinion on the recogni­tion of the Gays and Lesbians at NDSMC.'' The clear implication is that recognition of the group (not to say a decision to let others live as God or na­ture has seen fit to create them), is an unchristian stance. 
But to return. The use of the word "admitted" as an adjective for homo­sexual presupposes that homosexuality is a crime to be confessed. Crowley's assertions that he does "not wish to in­stigate any sort of witchhunt" and that he does "not intend to condemn or degrade homosexuals" are clearly belied by the phrase "admitted homo­sexual" and the clause "my values lead me to speak against such a club." The use of the word "values" clearly un­derscores the <in his opinion) valueless­ness of both GLNDSMC and homosexuals. 
Mr. Crowley's objection to what he perceives as the advocacy by GLNDSMC of a gay lifestyle is further evidence of homophobic projec­tion-paranoia. Clearly, as Professor Storey suggested in his Nov. 3 column, administrative recognition of GLNDSMC would "coun­teract. ..homophobia," encourage healthy self-acceptance by gay people and a "safe atmosphere" for that ac­ceptance, and contribute to shaping healthier, happier sexual attitudes." GLNDSMC "ministers to the special needs" of gay people. I fail to see Mr. Crowley's evidence for (or indeed the relevance of) his statements that: members of this club "are very certain in their minds and hearts that they are homosexual;" that "they are not 'exploring their sexuality' or debating the morality of alternative lifestyles. They are not concerned with the debate on 'a proper Catholic response to such a life.'" What support group or gather­ing of people with a common iden­tity1nterest on campus makes dysfunc­tional self-loathing a requirement for membership? Where do the other agenda Crowley cites come from? 
His further statement that "the club is an advocacy group, looking to promote their lifestyle and encouraging others to consider 'gay' life," raises the same questions. This last also sounds suspiciously like Anita Bryant's hys­terical homophobic campaign in Dade County, Florida, of several years back. Just as the existence of gays in the schools there did not constitute "recruitment," so the existence and ad­ministrative recognition of a sup­jectionable group" would open the door for destructive anti-Semitic hate organ­izations like a "Nazi club," or would encourage the formation of an "Atheist club." "Commonly objectionable?" I beg your pardon? But he is not homop­hobic. 
I await with baited breath the revela­tion from Mr. Crowley of which of "our Christian values" shall have been "tossed aside" when GLNDSMC is for­mally recognized. Is that the one about loving God with the whole heart, soul, mind, and strength, or the one about loving our neighbor as ourselves? Are there any Christian values inconsistent with or not covered by these two laws, given by one who claimed that therein were summarized the Law and the Prophets (Matt 22:37-40), both of which he and his followers claim he has ful­filled? Does the reputed wholesome­ness of this campus include the tossing aside of the second of these commands by refusing to respect and listen to those whose views differ from the opinion of the majority? 
Finally, Mr. Crowley asks how we can "prevent further erosion of the moral character of Notre Dame, if GLNDSMC is recognized. Yet he fails to demonstrate how recognition of the group would compromise anything but the obvious homophobia of which he partakes. I would suggest that the false­ness of his pseudo-liberal position on the issue is much more immoral than would be addressing the issue fairly and honestly, from a clearly stated rather than a deviously constructed po­sition. To begin any honest dialogue on any issue, it seems to me, we must begin with an honest self-awareness of 
where we stand on that issue. To argue a homophobic position behind a facade of non-homophobia does nothing to ad­vance the free exchange of ideas, which after all is the primary purpose of any university.

Narrow minds lead only to disaster 
Dear Editor: 
It is a disconcerting feeling to know that there are people in the wholesome NDSMC community that would like to see the administration acknowledge the existence of a gay and lesbian club. NDSMC is a pure island in a world full of degenerates who wish to band to­gether and force us to give up our het­erosexual preferences. How can these people actually think that we, as Cath­olic heterosexuals, will allow them to band together in an organized, offi­cially recognized group? To allow such an insidious act to occur, would be like recognizing a club made up of Protes­tants in our Catholic utopia -or worse yet, Buddhists (for they do not even believe in the same God as we do.) 
The Catholic Church is not wrong in ignoring the most inclusive statement Christ made, which is to love your neighbor. As any upholding Catholic knows, Christ lived and interacted with us on this earth as a human being. Part

buddies get together and order a pizza for this one. 
And it seemed everyone had a friend coming out for this game. New England accents were everywhere, especially when Boston counterparts couldn't find a place to 'pahk the cab.' 
The fan interest is there, the competition is strong, and the shared religion provides the common background. Here's one vote for an annual Boston College-Notre Dame game, even if Golden Girl Missy can't make the trip. 
The Irish could be pickin' Cotton very soon, but don't count out the possibility of two straight trips to Miami -one to play the Hurricanes and, ifthey have enough fun on that trip, a return visit for the Orange Bowl. 
"We are only loking at four teams to play the Big Eight champion," said Pete Wil­liams, chairman of the Orange Bowl Team Selection Commit­tee. "They are Notre Dame, Miami, Syracuse and Florida State.'' 
Williams also added that Miami has not pressured the Committee to give them an un­conditional bid prior to playing Notre Dame and South Carolina. 
The most probable location for Notre Dame's New Year's Day party is Dallas. The Cotton Bowl wants Notre Dame and Dallas-native Tim Brown, while the University appears ready to take the big money of the Cotton Bowl. It's been a long time since the last payoff from a New Year's Day bowl. 
A big win over the Southwest Conference Champion would also be a positive springboard 
-
48, Kronenberger put together a two minute scoring drive giving PW a chance to tie with no time on the clock. A tough Farley rush forced Kronenberger to rush a pass which fell incomplete, ending PW's title hopes. 
"We thought we might have trouble with their defensive line," said Farley coach Greg Rowe, "but our offensive line played great. It really opened up the passing game for Carol. 
Facing Farley in the finals will be BP, an easy winner over Lyons by a score of 30-0. 
If game balls were handed out, Carolyn Burke would definitely deserve one. She scored all four BP touchdowns and helped BP rack up 207 yards of total offense. 
On its first offensive play from scrimmage, BP quarter­back Teresa Coombs pitched back to Ann Curoe who hit Carolyn Burke for a 42 yard touchdown completion. 
"That was an old play which we added a new twist to in prac­tice,'' said BP coach Dan DeBoer. "I can't believe it worked that well." 
While Coombs let Curoe help in the passing game, she still finished the game 7-of-9 for 107 yards and two touchdowns. 
Late in the first half, BP ex­tended its lead to 16-0. Facing 4th and goal at the six, Burke broke free in the cornor of the end zone to haul in Coombs throw. Scoring on the last play of the first half gave BP the momentum it needed as it coasted to the shutout victory. 

While the offense scored every time it touched the ball, the BP defense was just as good. Lyons was able to gain only 43 yards of total offense and three first downs. The BP secondary held Lyons' quarter­back Mary Bohmer to 2-of-8 passing for only 14 yards. De­fensive end Maggie Citarella had two sacks in leading the way. 
The two rivals meet at 1 p.m. Sunday at Notre Dame Stadium for the women's Inter­hall championship. 
for next season and a boost for Notre Dame's recruiting ef­forts. 
But speculation now just leads to blowing off homework, or it least it has for my room­mates and I. The Cotton Bowl is probable, the Orange Bowl is possible, but as Head Coach Lou Holtz said Tuesday, "Right now all I'm concerned about is playing Alabama-nothing else matters." 
The Big Three. 
Alabama. Penn State. Miami. Anybody who scanned the schedule in August must have raised their eyebrows at the sight of these three finish­ing off the 1987 Notre Dame Saturday. The Crimson Tide is fulfilling its traditional cheer by rolling past their opponents in recent weeks, most recently lOth-ranked LSD, to silently move up the Associated Press poll to No. 11. 
Saturday's game will be an all-out war. 'Barna is hungry for the Sugar Bowl, while an Irish win over the Tide would dispell anyone's thoughts that Notre Dame is not for real. 
Penn State and the ever­present bad boys from Miami come next. One only needs to be reminded of two things to prepare for these contests­Paterna's "the mystique is gone from Notre Dame" quote and the ugly 58-7 score of two

In its first competition in several weeks, the Notre Dame women's tennis team travels to Madison, Wis., today for the Rolex Regional Qualifier. The four-day single elimination tournament will run through Nov. 15. 
The tournament will include "the best of the Midwest," ac­cording to Irish head coach Michele Gelfman. 
"Indiana, Northwestern, and Wisconsin all have a full team and are ranked both nationally and in the Midwest," said Gelfman. 
Other schools competing will be Miami <Ohio), Western Mic­higan, and the majority of schools in the Big-10 and Mid­American conferences. In total, more than thirty teams from across the Midwest will compete. 
"It's a huge draw, to say the least," said Gelfman. 
Freshman Ce Ce Cahill leads the way for the Irish. As the number-one singles seed in the tournament, Cahill will at­tempt to improve on her spot­less 21-0 season record. 
''Ce Ce is physically prepared for the tournament," said Gelfman. "What is impor­tant is that she is mentally prepared. In past tournaments she has always been seeded number one. There's always that pressure. But as a fresh­man, that pressure is doubled." 
Completing the singles field for the Irish will be senior Mic­helle Dasso, sophomore Step­hanie Tolstedt, and freshman Kim Pacella. CahiUDasso and Pacella-Tolstedt will pair up in the doubles competition. 
Despite the lack of recent matches, Gelfman said the team looked very well in prac­tice. She has been especially pleased with the progress of the doubles teams, which under­went re-shuffling following in­juries to sophomores Alice Loh­rer and Resa Kelly. 
"I think the improvement will take hold," said Gelfman. "Our goal is to get someone in the finals.

"And the meek shall inherit the earth..." Almost. 
The Off-Campus Hoobers, defending champions and league powerhouse, received the scare of their lives Sunday from unheralded Flanner F.C. Falling behind for the first time all year, the Hoobers for a 2-1 victory in a penalty-kick shootout. 
Shawn Mastic shocked the Hoobers with a goal midway through the first half --the first score O.C. has given up all season --and for thirty minutes it looked as if seventh-seed Flanner might pull off the up­set. But O.C. regrouped and tied the score on a penalty kick by Mike Johnson. Then the defenses took control, holding the opposition scoreless through a five-minute sud­den death period. 
In the ensuing shootout, Off­
Campus clinched the victory by 
converting all five, while Flan­
ner could only manage four. 
The win moved the Hoobers into the second round to face Zahm, a 2-0 winner over Stan­ford. Off-Campus again proved that it was a legitimate con­tender for the title with a 2-0 shutout. Ron Yuro scored the gamewinner on a penalty kick midway through the first half, and goalie Pat Marschall turned away the few shots he faced. 
In the remaining first round matchup, fourth-seeded Fisher met fifth-seeded Morrissey, with the winner earning the right to play top-seeded Holy Cross in the second round. 
Morrissey jumped out to a 1-0 halftime lead on a goal by Gerry Quinn but came out flat after the intermission and lost 2-1. Fisher capatalized on de­fensive lapses by Morrissey and scored twice in the second half on goals by Chris Crossen and Pat Murphy. 
Morrissey slips into the 
loser's bracket to face Flanner 
B, who dropped a 3-0 decision 
to Holy Cross in the opening 
round, today at Stepan Field. 
In other loser's bracket ac­
tion, Flanner F.C. finally did 
pull off an upset, knocking 
third-seed Stanford out of

Notre Dame and BC will not meet again until 1992 when the Golden Eagles come back to Notre Dame Stadium. 
Why? 
Notre Dame and Boston College should play each other every year, and not just because the Irish won Saturday, although that's pretty important too. But think of it. Notre Dame plays Navy every year, and beats them badly every year. Twenty-four straight victories does not make much of a rivalry. I'm not sure anybody gets up for this game anymore. Not even the Pentagon. 
But Notre Dame-Boston College stirs emotion. It did Saturday, and not just because the ninth-ranked Irish were down 17-6 at the half. And also not just because the Screamin' Eagles have Missy Johnson, the "Golden Girl" and National Baton Twirling Association champion. 
When these two schools go head to head, Notre Dame's strong Boston following taunts BC faithfuls, and Bean town, with its strong Irish Catholic tradition, becomes a city divided. I bet even His Holiness at the Vatican and his
