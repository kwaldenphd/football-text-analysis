Holocaust survivor earns Nobel 
Associated Press 
OSLO, Norway -Eiie Wiesel, who survived the Nazi Holocaust to become the voice of its victims and a champion of dignity for all people, was chosen Tuesday to receive the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize. 
The Norwegian Nobel Com­mittee praised the naturalized American author as a spiritual leader in an age of violence and hatred. 
"Wiesel's commitment, which originated in the sufferings of the Jewish people, has been widened to embrace all repressed peoples and races," its citation said. 
Wiesel, 58, lost his parents and younger sister in Nazi death camps during World War 
II. He has chronicled the suffer­ing of the Jews under Hitler and their problems in the Soviet Union today. 
"I have devoted my life to a certain cause, the cause of memory, the cause of remembrance, and now I feel that maybe I will have a better opportunity to say the same words. I'm not going to change now, for more people," Wiesel said in New York. where he lives. 
"I owe something to the dead. . .. That was their obses­sion, to be remembered. Anyone who does not remem­ber betrays them again." 
The committee's citation said: "Eiie Wiesel has emerged as one of the most important spiritual leaders and guides In an age when violence, repres­
sion  and  racism  continue  to  
characterize the world.  
"Wiesel  is  a  messenger  to  

mankind; his mes~e is one of peace, atonement and human dignity. His belief that the forces fighting evil in the world can be victorious is a hard-won belief." 
In 1944, Wiesel was among 15,000 Jews deported by Ger­mans and Hungarian fascists from his native town of Sighet in what is now Romania. It was

University of Oklahoma linebacker Brian Bosworth has taken back his statement that he put stray bolts In cars while working at a General Motors Corp. plant, the university says. The president of the University of Oklahoma, Frank Horton, talked to Bosworth after former co-workers protested his com­ments, and Bosworth denied putting the loose bolts In the cars, according to university spokeswoman Catherine Bishop. Bosworth was quoted In Sports Illustrated magazine's fall football Issue as saying that at a summer job last year at OM's Oklahoma City plant, co-workers taught him how to Insert the bolts In hard-to-reach places so they would rattle. -Associated Press

College. friendships easily erased by time and distance 
A very large package came In the mall for me last week. The outside was covered with printing In Spanish; Inside, amongst a bale of hay, was a birthday present from one of my best friends. 
The box surprised and excited me, and yet tears ran down my cheeks as I opened it. The gift was from Erin who Is studying In London this semester and was In Spain for a travel break. Although she lived next door to me last year, I called her my roommate and thought of her as a sister. To say I missed her as I opened her gift would be an understatement. 
However the tears were not just because I missed her. I was saddened to think that Erin had been gone for six weeks and I had only written her twice. 
Does absence make the heart forget? Have I gotten so caught up In my life here under the Dome that I only have time to write and share the latest football score or a brief account of last weekend's SYR? Last year's .3:.30 a.m. pC\)ama par­ties after a crazy night have been watered down to a short paragraph explaining the barest details. I feel almost as If I'm losing touch and yet am comforted to know that Erin will return from Lon­don and take her place In my life again senior year. , 
But what about after senior year, I have to stop and ask myself. Will occasional letters be all that Is left of the friendships I will have worked so hard to nurture In my four years here? It seems every time you open the paper, some senior Is scared about graduating. Maybe some ofthis comes from their sophomore or junior year, when some of their classmates studied abroad and were not the part of their lives they were the year before. 
Before Erin left I had never been separated from a friend In quite the same way. Leaving my high school friends was different: I can easily say that I was never as close to a high school friend as I am to most of my friends at Notre Dame. The only separations I've had from them have been vacations in which I counted the days until I'd be back popping the midnight popcorn with them. 
The line from "The Big Chill" haunts me when­ever I think of graduation. Nick, the cynic, says of his college friends, "A long time ago we knew each other for a very short while." A very short while? I guess I like to think of these four years in terms of quality not quantity. I'm hoping the quality of my friendships here will be enough to stand the tests of time and distance after gradua­tion. 
It's hard to imagine my college days being "a long time ago," and yet I already feel very removed from my high school years. Years from now photo albums and scrapbooks will bring back great memories, but the only way to truly relive the good times or the bad will be with the college buddies who were there. 

Notre Dame seems a place well-suited for build­ing these lasting friendships. Although the admis­sions office takes some abuse, they somehow gat­her 1, 750 students· each year that have a great deal in common. There Is almost always someone around to share a hobby, a meal or a late-night cram session with. 
These unusual things are the fringes of friendships that build on the underlying founda­tions. These foundations are formed by living with and learning with those around you in a way unique to this time In your life. Take advantage of the personalities that surround you as go about your dally routines. Realize that all too soon scat­tered letters and phone calls will be the means of keeping friendships alive. 
Until then I have something to be thankful for. Thank goodness I'm only a junior and have 19 months to enjoy the wonderful friends I've made the last two years. And although I won't miss my books or classes or studying over October Break. I'll once again be sampling life without my college companions. Maybe I'll have time to write some letters.

Serial killer preying on drifters

throughout streets of Los Angeles 
Associated Press 
LOS Angeles -A serial killer ap­parently has begun to prey late at night on drifters and other lone men on streets throughout the city In a fast-developing case that one detective says has vic­tims "popping up all over the place." 
Homicide detectives were trying to determine whether two more bodies found Monday, In­cluding the brother of All-Pro football great James Lofton, might be the work of the same person tentatively tied to nine other killings, said pollee Lt. Dan Cooke. 
It Is the second spate of serial killings to hit Los Angeles recent­ly. The first killer, the so-called "Southside Slayer" who also remains at large, has been tar­geting prostitutes In south­central Los Angeles. 
There Is no apparent connec­tion between the two crime sprees which, together, have taken the lives of more than two dozen people, Cooke said. 
One notable difference be­tween the two serial killers Is the rate of the deaths. The 17 South­side Slayer murders began just over three years ago and have been sporadic, with some kll­lings separated by months of in­activity. 

However, In the latest out­break. the nine killings have all occurred in the past six weeks, beginning Sept. 4. 
"Victims have started popping up all over the place. This Is a case that's developing quickly," said Lt. John Zorn, a .39-year-old detective who Is In charge of both Investigations. 
While five of the victims In the latest series appear to be drifters, Cooke said four others, Including a vacationer from Texas, cannot be classified as transients. 
An autopsy was scheduled on the body of Emanuel "Michael" Lofton Jr., .37, said county coroner spokesman Bill Gold. The brother of the .30-year-old Green Bay Packers wide receiver was found In a small park In south-central Los Angeles where he had been sleeping, according to his father. 
Lofton's father, 71-year-old Emanuel Lofton, said his oldest son had "been drifting for eight or 10 years. He just decided to do it. He didn't bother nobody In his life." 
The decomposed body of the other victim, known only as John Doe No. 244, also was found Monday, under a freeway over­

P.O.BoxQ 
Church and followers agree on birth control 

Dear Editor: 
You report Father McBrien as saying that only a tiny minority of Catholic theologians support the Vatican teaching on birth control. I have been unable to verify whether that report Is accurate; In any case, the statement as It has been published calls for a rebuttal. 
First, the term "Vatican teaching" Is loaded rhetoric, suggesting that the Issue is over the position of a particular power bloc within the Church. The wrongness of artificial contraception has been held by Popes, Bishops and theologians with Impressive unanimity for centuries. By any serious standard, it is a teaching of the Church as such. 
Secondly, in regard to the views of theologians, those of other ages have a right to be considered along with those of the present moment. By such a count, the overwhelming majority stands with the Holy See. 
Even as regards contemporary Catholic theologians, I am unaware ofany serious, systematic attempt to assess their stand on this topic. A great deal of publicity has been given to those who reject the Church's teaching, and I do not deny that there are many of them. But I know for a fact that there are also numerous others, faith fully and competently teach­Ing with the Church. As they are not making controversial statements, they don't make the headlines. Before declar­ing who Is in the majority, one needs to make a serious effort to count heads. 
I remember a theology student doing research on reactions to Humanae Vitae. On the basis of newspaper reports and the talk going around, he expected the reactions to be nearly all negative but was surprised to find much strong support for the encyclical. Such Is often the experi­ence of anyone who makes a systematic Investigation of what supposedly had been settled in public opinion. 
Was Father McBrien perhaps referring 

simply to American theologians? 
Americans have certainly been in the fore­front of the rt;jection of the doctrine on contraception. Even so limited, the asser­tion in question would probably be an exaggeration. In any case, America is not the Church. A statement about Catholic theologians has to take account of En­glish, Irish, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Canadian, Latin Americans, African, and how many others! It would be a remarkably well-informed person who knows what the majority of them think on any controversial issue. 
Finally, it must not be overlooked that, during the last fifty years, when the pres­sure in favor of artificial contraception has become particularly strong, every Pope to deal with the topic has reaffirmed the Church's position: Pius XI. Pius XII, Paul VI, and John Paul II. This unanimity on the part of the pastors who, in God's providence, have been commissioned to give the Church its supreme direction is far more impressive that a dubious 'majority opinion' of theologians.

Peaceful actions are a a voice for memorial 
Dear Editor: 

I note with Interest that on Friday the University will dedicate a new Peace Memorial. It is a fine idea to work for peace. Our government Is presently waging an illegal war against the govern­ment of Nicaragua, a war which bears no rational relationship to our national se­curity or our national Interest. 
If we are "to Jive and work for peace in our times," as Father Hesburgh has sug­gested, we might begin by speaking out against United States aid to the so-called "Contras." I urge that. as we pray for peace on Friday afternoon, the University administration speak out publicly against this undeclared twilight war on Nicaragua. It would reqube some courage, but there could be no more timely contribution to the cause of world peace.

It's like knocking on the door ofa house and finding out that nobody's home. 
What is so discouraging about writer's block is that here is a topic that I want to write about, something very serious that I want to inform the campus about and express my views on. But the problem is that my brain is stuck in neutral f.tnd spin­ning its wheels furiously in creative limbo. I stare at the screen, wondering how I'm going to write this editorial. Until I manage to shift my thoughts into first gear, the editorial is not going to get writ­ten. 
Sometimes, It isn't the writing that proves to be so hard, it's the search of a topic to write about. A number of ideas run through the mind as I remind myself, 
"Hey, I've got to write my Viewpoint column this week." And I realize a few moments later that I have nothing to write about. Writer's block Is bad enough, but edi­torial topic block Is the absolute pits. Some of the probable ideas for edltrolals that I think of, like abuses In college athletics and nuclear disarma­ment. have already been expounded upon so many times that they have been driven Into the ground. Other Ideas aren't timely. An editorial about Christmas during October? Nah. Other topics are of very little Interest to the Notre Dame au­dience. Instead ofan editorial on the right to bear arms, how about one on the right to arm bears? I hardly think so. It is a terrible thing to admit that the well of topics runs very dry at times. But that is Indeed the challenge of being a writer. It is the challenge to find something to write about and it is the challenge of getting past that Immensely thick writer's block in the middle of your mind and writing that hard-hitting edito­rial. Writing is not something that is mas­tered overnight. The only way to become better at writing Is to write and write fre­quently. 
Bill Glavin of the Newhouse School of Journalism at Syracuse University says this about writing, "Bad writers think that writing Is easy; good writers think writing Is hard." 
Writing Is hard. It takes a lot of thought and a lot of struggle to put out an edito­rial, or a news article or a features article. It Is a fact that most people find writing to be easy; fewer find It to be hard. It Is those who think writing Is hard who are the best writers. They are the writers who are reporting the news and writing the novels we read. They are the Red Smiths, the James Klrkpattlcks and the Art Buch­walds. They are the James Mlcheners and the Hermann Wouks. 
I myself believe that writing Is hard. It takes thought and concentration to write well. I make mistakes, as do all of us when we write. We may Interpret the topic Incorrectly, or not be as accurate as we should be. All reporters and all writers have made these mistakes In their lifetimes. To admit to these mistakes Is to admit that writing Is not easy. To stand 
back and criticize, while not admitting·. that we too can make those same mis­takes, Is to admit that writing Is easy. A few professors at this university should consider that when grading those next batch of papers. 
Whenever an article I have written Is printed, I read It over and always find numerous places where I could have made certain points clearer or find an­other word that would have been more specific. I will do the same with this article and will likely to find places where I could have written better. 
At age 75, Carl Sandberg said that he would become a good writer "If God gives me five more years." 
John Steinbeck wrote In a letter to his editor: "Sometimes I have felt that I held fire In my hands and spread a page with shining, but I have never lost the weight of clumsiness, of Ignorance, of aching inability." 
If those great writers felt writing was hard, then It truly Is. You may become the most acclaimed writer of your time, yet you will still feel that Inadequacy, that feeling that you could have written a sen­tence that would have more easily con­veyed what you meant. 
It takes many years to become a good writer. Hopefully I have started down that path to being a good writer. I know that It is going to be a hardjourney,·but writing Is the hardest art of all. Don't let anyone tell you that it is a piece of cake. 
Guess what? I think I just got past that writer's block.

Political debater must explore all arguments 
In his Viewpoint article of October lO­ll, 1986 Jurgen Brauer asserted that the United States Is lying about its Involve­ment in Central America. But in present­Ing his case, Brauer omitted important relevant facts and distorted other to suit his own purposes, and as a result, it is very difficult to accept his conclusions. I will address each of the six "lies" that Brauer attributes to the United States and point out where omissions and distor­tions have occurred. 
James Bechwith 
guest column 
1. 
The U.S. promotes democracy in Central America 

Brauer claims that the Sandinistas are the only freely elected government In Central America. In fact. the opposition parties in Nicaragua boycotted the 1984 elections because they were nbt allowed to mount even token election campaigns, and the resulting elections were "free" only as compared to elections In other one-party, Marxist nations. Brauer Ig­nores the election of President Jose Napoleon Duarte In El Salvador who at the very least had to run against several other candidates in his election victory. 

2. 
U.S. policy in the region is a response to a Soviet threat 


Brauer failed to mention the $500 mil­lion of Soviet military aid the Sandinlstas 
'Louie,Louie' lyrics are not sexually explicit 
Dear Editor: 
I had to agree with columnist John Far­ley when he blasted the administration for outlawing the song "Louie, Louie" at Notre Dame football home games. But my anger soon turned to laughter when I realized the administration, along with the morally upright woman from Rock­ville, goofed! Their perceptions of "Louie, Louie" are hilarious and coincide with the ridiculous myths that most of the counrty believed about the song almost .30 years ago. 
Richard Berry originally recorded "Louie, Louie" in 1956, and the song be­came a modest hit. selling 1.30,000 copies. The song was about a man in a tavern telling a bartender named Louie how he was going to sail to Jamaica someday to capture the girl of his dreams. 
In 196.3, a Top 40 cover band from Portland, the Kingsmen, decided to re­record Berry's classic. Having little 

r 
r money, the Klngsmen had to settle for a cheap recording studio and some inex­perienced engineers. "Louie, Louie," 
therefore, was recorded in a primitive 
r 
way. Microphones were placed next to 

r 
amplifiers muffled with coats and 

r 
blankets, and the lead vocal mikes were suspended 15 feet in the air from the

' 
ceiling. Klngsmen lead singer Jack Ely literally had to shout his lead vocals! This

~ 
~ 
resulted in a poor recording with heavy bass and unintelligable muffled vocals. r As the record creeped onto the charts r later that year, a stir was being created r across the nation: "Just what is he sing­r ing?" Since the vocals could not be decip­r hered, many rock antagonists insisted, r "There must be obscenities in there r somewhere!" The FCC conducted an in-
r 
have received, Including tanks and helicopters. He ignores the presence of .3500 Cuban military advisers In Nicaragua. He also fails to point out that the Sandinistas are currently constructing a large military air field and a deep-water port whose most logical use would be as bases from which Soviet planes and sub­marines could patrol the U.S. coastline. .3. U.S. Policy has improved the human rights record in Central America 
In El Salvador, Duarte has clearly lead the effort to improve his country's human rights record, but Brauer does not give the Salvadoran people any credit for their efforts. Basically, Brauer focused his at­tention on the alleged human rights' abuses of the Contras and of U.S. allies in Central America while falling to point out the dismal human right record of the Sandinista regime. The International League fo~ Human Rights strongly criticized the civil rights record of the San­dlnista regime. The Sandlnistas have at­tempted to repress any and all opposition to their regime within Nicaragua including groups such as the Catholic Church, labor movements, business organizations, and the free press. 
4. The U. S. government is not preparing for deeper military involvement in Central America 
Brauer falls to point out that it could also be argued that the Soviet Union is preparing for deeper involvement In Central America based on the facts that I have mentioned above in statement number two. 
5. U.S. actions in Central America are in accordance with international and domestic law. 
Brauer fails to mention that the Sandi­nistas are also engaged in the same type of activities that he claims are illegally carried out by the U.S. and other Central American countries. For example, Brauer omits the fact that the Sandinistas have carried out a brutal, genocidal campaign against the Miskito Indians in Nicaragua, including the destruction of their lives­tock and villages, while he does not hesitate to cite similar attacks alleged to have been carried out by the Salvadoran and Guatemalan military. ,Brauer claims that U.S. funding of the Contras violates international law, but he does not point out that the Sandinistas fund their own "Contras" by providing assistance to rebels in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Colombia, and that the Sandinistas are therefore also guilty of violating lnterna­tionallaw. 
6. The U.S. has supported the Contadora peace process 
Brauer does not mention that the San­dlnlstas have a poor track record in regards to keeping their promises. They failed to live up to the democratic prom­ises that they made after the 1979 revo­lution. Indeed, the Contras' political lead­ership Is made up of former Somoza foes who became disenchanted with the San-
P.O.BoxQ 

vestigatlon and found no evidence to sup­port such a claim. In fact, it was this false perception that made "Louie, Louie" such a huge hit with the teenagers of that era. 
Here are the actual lyrics to "Louie, Louie": 
Louie, Louie Me gotta go now Louie, Louie Me gotta go now 

A fine little girl, she waits for me Me casts a ship across the sea I sail the ship all alone I never think I'll make it home 
chorus 
Three nights and days, me sailed the sea Me think of girl who comes to me Through all the ship I dream she's there I smell the roses in her hair 
chorus 
Me see Jamaica moon above It won't be long, me see my love Me take her in my arms and then I tell her I can never leave again 
chorus 
What a farce the woman from Rockville has created! And what a flub by Fr. Hes­burgh to believe her! We haven't seen such a stuffy attitude since Elvis wasn't allowed to wiggle his waist on the Ed Sul­livan show in 19571 C'mon guys, lighten up! Let the University band perform one of the students' favorite dance and party tunes.

Church dissenters need to quietly seek truth 
Dear Editor: I will be the flrst to admit that, as far as knowledge of the Church is concerned, I am like a flea compared with a theolo­gian like Father McBrien. Perhaps, then it is a result of my ignorance that I dis­agree with him about so many things. Nevertheless, child though I may be, I -suspect my parents are up to no good. As all Catholics know, tlie Church is the living Church of Christ which is guided and instructed by the Holy Spirit. While the Holy Spirit is perfect in every way, guiding we who are so imperfect, we nevertheless pray fervently for a correct understanding of God's will. Throughout the Church's history, the Holy Spirit has given us some very explicit directions (e.g., Jesus is both fully man and fully God, and Mary was assumed into heaven.) Then there are others which are pronounced as infallible or absolute, namely such issues concerning birth con­trol, sexuality. et al. The liberal move­ment. It seems to me, has taken these two different types of Church rules and made one black and the other white. Can this be? Is everything not written in stone open to argument? As I reflect upon the Church's past, it seems rather that they are varying degrees of cogency in moral and theological doctrine, that is to say, things are not either black or white. Hasn't this been a tacit assumption throughout the Church's history? Ifit hasn't, I wonder how the Church has survived for 2. 000 years. When the bulls of its teaching are, as the liberals see it, "open to question." If the American liberals were to have it their way, what would evolve would not been an enlightened Church guided by the Holy Spirit, but rather outright Protes­tantism, where majority defines truth. 
dinistas failure to live up to their prom­ises, which included trying free, demo­cratic elections. Taking this into consideration, it is quite understandable that the U.S. is not anxious to rely solely on the Contadora process. Perhaps if the Sandlnistas cleaned up their human rights record and made an effort to fulfill their earlier promises their sincerity at the negotiating table would receive more credence. 
Certainly, Brauer has raised several im­portant points about U.S. policy, past and present. in Central America. But his criticism of U.S. policy should not be ac­cepted on face value because he only told half the story. Brauer accused Rep. John Hiler and Senator Dan Quayle of lying about U.S. Central American policy. Based on the points I have mentioned above, this would not appear to be the case. Indeed, it is Brauer who tried to deceive the readership of The Observer by only mentioning the facts which sup­ported his preconceived ideas while ig­noringany evidence that might contradict his view. Since Brauer has endorsed the candidates running against Hiler and Quayle, it Is a safe bet that his choices are only aware of half of the story in Central America and are therefore not very well Informed. 
James Beckwith is a graduate student in the Department ofChemical Engineering. 
Another facet of all this turbulence I find rather Intriguing concerns how leaders like Father Hesburgh and Father McBrien see a necessary tension between the university and the ChUrch. Why is this? Hesburgh, if I read him correctly, does not see how rigorous investigation can be compatible with static church teaching in every case. Why? Granted, we need investigation of all sorts at a uni­versity, but the investigation must be done-in a proper way. Theological dis­cussion becomes incompatible when publicity hounds like Father Curran are dealing with it. There is no tension be­tween a well thought-out moral, theologi­cal, or whatever type argument which dis­agrees with the doctrine of the Church until that theology is done in an improper fashion. Do we ever find St. Thomas call­ing all the -cameras to him? Do we ever find St. Thomas waving his fist at Rome whe one of his ideas is rejected? Why is this? Perhaps we can clear the air from all this Curran and Hunthausen noise by a quiet reflection on what the Church meant to St. Thomas, the Angelle Doctor. Maybe he understood something Curran and the rest of his crew don't.

CHRISTI HOLTZ 
features writer 

Athletics are an Important part of the Notre DamE'/Salnt Mary's community. Intramural and club sports give the students a chance to continue participating In a sport that they e11loyed In high school or to learn a new one. 
One Intramural sport that Is ac­tive .at Saint Mary's Is flag foot­ball. LeMans, Holy Cross, McCandless, and Regina halls all have teams which compete against each other. Practices begin In the middle of Septem­ber and play continues Into early November. Games are usually played on Tuesdays and Thursdays ofevery week. Anyone who lives In the dorms Is eligible to play on her hall team; no ex­perience Is necessary. Dedicated Notre Dame men coach the teams, and run practices several times a week. They teach the wo­men fundamentals, create differ­ent plays and strategies, set up scrimmages, and offer basic moral support throughout the season. 
The competition Is tough; each dorm has an eye on the cham­pionship at the end of the season. Holy Cross Hall was the champion last year, and the team Is working hard to repeat that feat. This won't be easy, as the other dorms are hungry to take the crown. 
Cathy Bove, of Holy Cross, gives her coaches a lot of credit for leading their team, "Our coaches are really good. They make playing a team effort, and we have a lot of fun." 
She also adds praise for the dedication of her head coach. "Mark Neronl is very excited about the game and coaching. He takes it seriously and works hard on our plays. He coached the All-Star team last year against Notre Dame, too. Hopefully, we'll be able to do it again." 
The coaches seem to enjoy flag football as much as the wo­men who play for them, and they believe strongly in their teams. 
Jeff Chiesa, a coach for LeMans is Impressed with the competitiveness of the teams, "Last year most games were very close-the competition was tough. This year it's true too. I believe the quality of football at Saint Mary's is comparable to that of the Notre Dame women. I would like to see them play to­gether more, so there would be more than three teams to com­pete against." 
Many of the players· would also like the opportunity to play more teams and think it would be fun to set up scrimmages with Notre Dame. Such practices would give the women a chance to get to know each other better before they play in a real game. 
Maria Dati of Regina feels it would be nice to set up a system similar to that of bookstore bas­ketball, "This would give us more teams to compete against and expand the intramural sport. If we got support from the women at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's we might be able to get this started." 
Denise Regent of Holy Cross adds, "Right now, the object of the whole season is to play Notre Dame. Playing Notre Dame throughout the season would be nice, and perhaps take some of the pressure away. We're friends with the other teams; in the games we play for real, but we leave as friends. It would be great to expand that." 
Coaches and players agree that the main goal offlag football Is to have fun. 

Eric Scheuermann, a LeMans coach, says, "It's great. We do have a lot of fun. The tlrst prac­tice Is taken pretty seriously with drills and all that but now that we all know each other well and have a good time the women won't take us too seriously­they'll never run when we tell them to." 
Everyone participating agrees that flag football Is great to get Involved In, but wish they could get more support. 
'We would like to see the games and scores covered in The Observer. That way more people would hear about us and come out and support their dorms," states Chiesa. 
Dorin! echoes this sentiment, "Yes, we'd like more support, and let people know flag football is going on as a real activity. We're enthusiastic and the games are exciting to watch." 
Flag football is alive and well on both campuses and people are encouraged to get out and get Involved in the sport, either as a player or a spectator. 
All the girls agree, 'We just want to stress that flag football Is a lot of fun, a good way to get some excerclse, vent some ag­gression, and meet new friends which last long beyond the end of the season." 

The French 
exercise in utility 
So, did you pick up a game of hoops or take a jog around the lakes today to clear your mind after Economics or work off last night's Domino's? Even if you're not a Domer, I wouldn't be surprised if you had. 
In the past ten years or so, Americans have become ex­tremely health conscious. They are more aware of the many positive benefits one can receive from following a dally regime of eating well, exercising regularly, and limiting vices such as alcohol and cigarettes. 
I have found, though, that is phenomenon has yet to fully 
·.a. 
reach France and much of Europe. People here eat balanced meals and balance them well into their day, but they do not exercise as a rule and consume more alcoholic beverages and smoke more than Americans. 
Mary Berger 
C'est Ia Vie 


In this country reknowned for its cuisine, one can find few faults with the food and meal planning from a nutritional point of view. Breakfast Is very light: bread and coffee or tea. Lunch Is the hot main meal of the day: usually meat or fish and vegetables, while dinner Is another light meal: pasta, eggs, or a cheese-tilled pastry for Instance, and perhaps vegetables. Bread accompanies every meal with cheese and either fruit or a sweet dessert Is eaten after lunch and dinner. 
From an American stomach's point of view, there Is never enough food. But If the French people can thrive on such a regimen, this seemingly sparse amount must be suf­ficent. By French Standards, Americans are a bit gluttonous and quite overfed. I overhead one person say we Americans are not healthy because we eat so much. · 
But what do we do after we have consumed all of those calories? We burn them offl 
Whether It be a walk after dinner, an aerobics class before work, or a stop at the gym during lunch, many Americans take the time to exercise. Not only does a good workout help keep us in shape, it also relaxes us and relieves the pressure 

Here, some people do participate In team and individual sports such as soccer or go to a gym but they are a minority. Physical education classes are rare In school curriculums and even more rarely are they mandatory. 
One of my professors told a story of her grade-school days when her P.E. class was scheduled between two academic classes. She told us that she hated having to change her clothes, run around or play games and get sweaty, and then change her clothes again for her next class. So, her father wrote a note excusing her from class. Imagine if she went to Notre Dame and had to slip in a swimming class at the Rock between an 8 a.m. class In the Engineering Auditorium and one at 10:10 a.m In the library! 
It is true that perhaps the French do not need to burn as many calories as we Americans, but they could benefit from the stress-relieving aspects of exercise. 
I am sure living here Is as stressful as life In the United States. In the states, students are faced with SAT's and ACTs as they prepare for college. Similarly, In France, high school seniors must study for hours to pass the Baccalaureate exam, and I have been told that great pressure accompanies this test. 
Likewise, single parent families and women In the work force are present In this societyjust as In America. The prob­lems ofabortion, unemployment, and other worries also con­cern the French as much as they concern Americans. 
So, how do the people cope? The leisurely two-hour lunch that everyone takes Is very relaxing. Quite often, families go to their homes in the country on weekends and find respite there. I'm sure there are many other ways people find to relax, but exercise does not seem to be a very popular one. 
If one wishes to exercise here, h«: may consider his walk to the bakery or local cafe as enough and can't see why we "crazy Americans" spend so much time wearing ourselves out sweating and suffering so we can feel good and look better.

Interhall soccer action heats up as teams drive for playoffs 
By GEORGE TRAVERS Sports Writer 
As the NVA Interhall Soccer League finishes Its regular season, the best teams prepare to battle for the championships. Every playoff team will be In a dogfight for the right to call Itself champion. 
In the North American Divi­sion, Fisher was the first team to clinch a playoff spot. It beat Cavanaugh In a dramatic shootout on Monday. It appeared Fisher had the game In hand, but Cavanaugh scored with only 14 seconds left In regulation time, to tie the score at 1-1. Fisher then won the game In the shootout. 
The other North American Dlvi­slon team In the playoffwill most likely be the winner of Holy Cross 'A' and Alumni. Both teams are .3-1 and will battle for the final spot today. 
Tom Schlesser, stopper for the Fisher squad, feels his troops will be ready to face any team. 
"Our defense has been awesome," Schlesser said. "We have done a goodjob at limiting our opponents' scoring oppur­tunltles. If we can combine our defense with an offense and mid­field, we will be unstoppable. We're confident we can take It to anybody." 
There Is a three-way logjam In the Western European Division for the two playoff spots. Zahm beat Dlllor:t II, 2-1, last week to raise Its record to 4-1. Flanner 

F.C. blanked Keenan 'B' to up Its record to 4-1 also. Both teams have a good chance of making the playoffs. 
Keenan 'A' plays Dillon II after fall break In a must win make-up game If It wants a chance at get­ting a playoff spot. 
The South American Division already has Its playoff partici­pants set. It will be the Off­Campus Hoobers at 5-0 and Grace 'A' at 4-1. Both teams have played extremely well In one of the toughest divisions. 
The Hoobers are last year's champs and one of the best teams In the league. They are undefeated and have given up only two goals all season. Led by forward Tommy Walker and halfback Steve Kranz, the Hoobers defeated the Grace 'A' team earlier this year. 
Grace 'A' Is also very strong and has Its eyes on a champion­ship. Sparked by goals from Dave Gullott and Tom Loftus, It toppled Morrissey 'A' by a 2-0 score In Its final regular-season game. Coach Jack Lee feels his team has a good chance at going all they way. 
"Our defense and fan support have gotten us this far," he says. "Now If we can score some more goals and get some strong play at midfield we could surprise a few people." 
The Eastern Europen Division Is dominated by the Off-Campus been scored on and are confi­dent they can win. 
The two teams fighting for the final playoff spot In this division are Stanford and Dillon I. Dillon has a crucial make-up game after break against Pangborn that It must win to get Into the playoffs. Stanford has had an up-and­down season. With a .3-2 record following a loss to the Off­Campus Splelphs last week. they can only hope that DIIIon I loses to catapult It Into the playoffs. 
Splelphs coach Dave Thompson feels sweeper Norb Knapke could play a crucial role In the playoffs. 
"We would like to get more goals than we've been getting." he says. Our ball control has

Griffin's return helps Irish defense 
Hurricanes remain on top 
6y fiRIC SCHeUeRMANN 
Sports Writer 
With the Notre Dame football 
team entering this year's cam­
paign with a shortage of defen­
sive linemen, the return of nose 
tackle Mike Grlffln after a year's 
absence because of 111]ury has 
been a welcome one. 
With the 1986 season five 
weeks old, Grlffln has returned 
to his starting nose-tackle slot 
and has contributed 1.3 solo 
tackles and nine assists while 
helping the Irish become more 
consistent up front on the defen­
sive line. 
Saturday against Pitt. Grlffln came up with the first blocked field goal for the Irish, blocking JeffVan Home's .36-yard attempt In the second quarter. It was the first block for the Irish since Brandy Wells did It last year against Michigan State. 
Grlffln broke his ankle during last fall's preseason drills, and had to sit out the entire 1985 season as well as spring practice. 
"It was sort of a freak accident during a drill with the offensive linemen," says Grlffln. "My foot got caught In the grass or some­thing, and I broke two bones In my ankle. I had to have seven screws and a plate put In during surgery." 
Griffin had been looking to continue In 1985 where he had left off In 1984, when he re­corded 40 tackles for the Irish as a sophomore. In fact. Grlffln

system by suggesting that the 
Chicago Cubs play all post­
season games In St. Louis. Why 
hasn't anyone thought of this 
brilliant Idea earlier? 
football games are offlclated by video tapes Instead of men In 
striped shirts.
h1Juries Used to SOUrlcl drastic 
and painful, like a separated 
shoulder ~ a broken leg. Some­
how turf toe just does not cut it. 
In fact. some oftoday's remedies 
sound much more painful, such 
as arthroscopic surgery. 
It has been so long that Gerry 
Faust has finished his term here, 
and we know how long that 
seemed. 
But that could all change with a win on Saturday. After another tough loss against Pitt. the Irish are trying to show how well they can bounce back. Again. 
Of all the monkeys that have jumped on Notre Dame's back In the past few seasons, the failure to beat Air Force Is near the top of the list. 
It would be nice to slowly lighten the load, starting Satur­day. 
Correction 
Due to a reporting error, Fa­ther James Riehle was Incor­rectly quoted In a column In yesterday's Observer. It should have read, "(The foot­ball alumnus) said that the players (In 1970-71) never thought about having to flap their arms around to get the fans going." 
In the story on Interhall football, Morrissey beat Dil­lon, 6-0, on a pass from Joe Fuqua to Tom Hardiman In the second quarter of the game. 
Due to an editing error, Pete Gegen was Incorrectly Identi­fied as Club Comercolumnist. Gegen's position Is assistant sports editor. 

made a big Impact as a fresh­
man, playing In 10 of the team's 
11 games, and finishing second 
to linebacker Mike Kovaleski In 
tackles among first-year players. 
"I was looking for a good foot­ball program coming out of high school," he says, "and I felt It was Important to come to a place like Notre Dame where they'd push me to get an education. I didn't expect to get a chance to play much on defense as a fresh­man. I was just looking to help out on special teams or some­thing, but an 111]ury to (since graduated) John Autry opened the door for me. 
"I thought I had a pretty good freshman year. The only prob­lem was that I started the season at 254 pounds and I weighed only 22.3 pounds when I went home after the Liberty Bowl. I didn'tplay as well as I would have liked my sophomore year, though." 
The ankle 111]ury halted any plans for an Improved junior campaign, however, and pushed Grlffln's career back a year. 
"At first they thought I could come back In six months," he says, "but the bones didn't heal very well. That pushed the rehabilitation process back. forc­Ing me to miss spring practice. 
"Sitting out the season was the toughest part. I had a lot of friends that were seniors, and I had to watch all the away games here on TV. But there wasn't a lot I could do. I wore a portable bone-healing stimulator 18 hours a day, but besides that there wasn't much to do but walt." 
So walt he did, and when fall practice started under the new coaching staff -which Included defensive line coach Joe Yonto  he was ready. 
"I was a little rusty when I came back In the fall, but we had some long practices so I had a lot of time to work some of that rust off," Griffin says. 
Sophomore Marty Lippincott 
had played nose tackle during 
spring drills, so Griffin found 
himself In a fight to regain his 
old starting position. 
"Marty had played In the spring, and he started the Mic­higan game at nose tackle," says Griffin. "But they moved him to offense after that and I moved back up. 
"My ankle hasn't really been a problem at all. There was some pain after two-a-days during the preseason, but It hasn't bothered me since. I still don't think I've played all that well, though. I've just got to work a little harder. I think the defensive line as a whole has done a decent job, but we aren't yet where we have to be." 
With six tough games remain­Ing, Griffin and his Irish team­mates will be looking to close that gap.

Notre Dame field hockey plays host to Michigan State 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame field hockey team will try to gain Its fifth vic­tory today as It hosts the Mic­higan State Spartans. 
The Irish have improved their record to 4-5 and steadily are gaining momentum as they prepare to face the Division I Spartans, who stand :3-8-1 over­all and 1-4-1 In the Big 10. 
Coach Jill Lindenfeld is pleased with the team's perfor­mance thus far. 
"The whole team is really start­ing to gel and play well to-

gether," she said. "They've kept their concentration on the field and played very well mentally. We've had a good scoring attack. especially from my three cap­tains in the forward line." 
Senior tri-captains Corinne DIGiacomo, Meg McGlinn and Mary Wagner have helped the Irish develop a physical style of play that has made the defense more aggressive in getting to the ball and denyingthe offense pos­session. 
To be successful, Notre Dame will have to control Michigan

Air Force jinx_ has lasted a long time 
Notre Dame has not beaten the Air Force Academy In a long time. A long, long time. 
The Irish beat the Falcons in 1981 by a :35-7 score. Since that game, the Falcons have made life miserable for the Blue and Gold. 
In 1982, It was the Falcons winning 30-17 at Colorado Springs. Notre Dame Stadium was the sight ofAir Force victories in 198:3 (2:3-22) and 1984 (21-7), and last year the Irish were beaten on the Falcons' home turf again, 21-15. 
That's four straight victories for Air Force folks, if you're scoring along with us at home. 
Only two teams have ever beaten the Irish in five straight seasons-Michigan State, from 1959 to 196:3, and USC, from 1978 to 1982. 
It sounds all right to lose to Michigan State or USC five times in a row, but not Air Force. Alumni often remember fondly the big games against Michigan State and especially USC. Many of those games had possible national championships and major bowl­game Invitations to add to their importance. 
How many Notre Dame-Air Force games have had such ramifications? 
Air Force has a good squad this year. Many of its teams In the past four years have been excellent squads as well. But that's not the point. Air Force Is not supposed to beat us. They have a coach named Fisher DeBerry, for Pete's sake. 
Even though the Falcons are 5-l, and the Irish only 1-4, Notre Dame is being tabbed a nine-and-a­half-point favorite. That Is typical of the odds of past games. No matter how well Air Force Is doing and 

no matter how bad the Irish are, Notre Dame Is ex­pected to win. That's what makes this whole deal more frustrat­ing. 
Four straight losses to teams that are good, yet should be beaten, is a lot of losses. And a long time. 
A lot of things have changed in four years that put

some perspective on how long it has been since the Irish have beaten the Falcons. Notre Dame has changed football coaches, which Is always a monumental occasion. 
The Irish have played a home game in a domed stadium, perish the thought, and even graced the gridiron in Hawaii. 
Indianapolis even got a professional football team, well kind of. At least they still run a good race there. 
George Steinbrenner hired Lou Pinella last year and has re-hired him for this year. Time mellows all, I guess. . The Boston Red Sox actually held onto a lead to win the American League East. And the Cleveland Indians finished higher than sixth. 
Rehabilitation no longer refers to injuries In most sports stories. , 
"The Incredible Hulk" has gone from a comic-book character to a television series to a professional wrestler to a cartoon character. 
Point-shaving returned to the news, as did running up the score on departing coaches. 
A spring football league has come and gone, and another one is preparing to launch an Ill-fated at­tempt to win the out-of-season activity award cur­rently held by Christmas in July celebrations. 
It has been so long since Notre Dame beat Air Force that Dave Duerson has gone from a Notre Dame captain to an NFL pro-bowler. 
Assistant coaches, not only head coaches, are now subject to rides off the field atop their players' shoulders after Super Bowl victories. 
Quarterbacks used to be named Bobby, George, Johnny and Sonny. Now we have guys like Boomer and Bubby. 
The Toronto Blue Jays won the American League East. When did they stop beingjust another harmless expansion team? At least the Seattle Mariners give us the feeling that things haven't changed so much. 
Nicknames have changed from tranquil handles .such as "Boog" and "Scooter" to appliances and pe­troleum containers . 
The National League has changed its boring policy of having its division winners play post-season games at home and changed to a more exciting
